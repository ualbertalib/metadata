ACKNOWLEDGEMEHTS 


Members of the staff of the Department of Political 
Economy at the University of Alberta have contributed gener¬ 
ously of their time and efforts to assist in this study. Pro¬ 
fessor J.R.S. Jorgens offered valuable guidance in organizing 
the study and advice and assistance in the field work for ob¬ 
taining the data. Professor W.D. Gainer was also available 
from time to time for guidance. Professor Wm. Mackenzie has 
assisted greatly in the final stages of the work with valuable 
advice and with painstaking effort in checking the theory and 
the details of the statistical analysis. This does not in any 
way absolve the author from the responsibility of the contents. 

Members of the staff of the Economics Division, Mar¬ 
keting Service, Canada Department of Agriculture, at Edmonton 
also assisted greatly. Dr. C.C. Spence and Mr. G. Haase offered 
considerable advice and encouragement from time to time. Mr. 
Knud Elgaard did most of the work on the statistical analysis 
and organization of the primary data. 

The Federal Department of Agriculture through its 
Economics Division and through P.F.H.A. contributed the finan¬ 
cial and clerical assistance which made the study possible. 

To all of these individuals and groups I wish to make 
sincere and grateful acknowledgement for their contributions to 
this study. 






















SYNOPSIS 


The additional development of irrigation in Western Canada is 
currently a moot question which involves some estimation of returns to pro¬ 
posed investments in construction of irrigation works* An estimation of 
the incres.sed returns to agriculture is essential* Any information which 
will lead to a better understanding of the changes in farm organisation 
and income, which are likely to occur in the project areas after they re¬ 
ceive the water, will aid in estimating the increase in returns to agricul¬ 
ture which will likely follow* 

A few methods for studying the farm organization and income in 
any chosen area have been developed by students of farm management. One 
of the more recent of these has been an adaptation of the production func¬ 
tion analysis developed by Cobb and Douglas in the late nineteen-twenties. 

By a study of the theory and the literature concerning this type 
of analysis, and by applying it to a selected group of farms in an irri¬ 
gation district of Alberta, this thesis attempts to furnish certain infor¬ 
mation on farm organization and income in the area studied and to ascertain 
how reliable and useful the method is in farm management research of this 
type* In the course of applying the analysis certain refinements have been 
introduced in choosing a sample and in categorizing inputs* 

The conclusions derived from the study are, briefly: 

(1) Under present conditions the farms in the area will tend 
to increase their land input, probably by land improvement. 

(2) Under present conditions the number of livestock on each 
farm will tend to increase*

(3) Within the range of the data the amount of money the 
average farmer in the area spends annually on buildings 
has little effect on output. 

(4) Labour is being used efficiently under present conditions 
in the area. 

(5) The analysis offers no reliable conclusions regarding the 
machinery input of the farms. 

(6) All inputs are apparently being used under conditions of 
diminishing returns. 

(7) Mo reliable conclusions as to the condition of returns 
to scale existing among the farms can be made from the 
analysis. 

(8) The output of a given farm within the population can be 
estimated from the regression equations determined in 
the study within certain fiducial limits. 

(9) If the method is applied with a thorough knowledge of 
its limitations it can supply reliable information useful 
as a guide in farm management advisory work and in agri¬ 
cultural policj/-. However, the results cannot be applied 
to the budgeting of farm organization for any individual 
farm in the area studied.

I. INTRODUCTION 

During recent years there has been an increasing interest In the 
expansion of irrigation in the Prairie Provinces, particularly in Alberta 
and Saskatchewan* The St. Maiy and Milk River Development in southern 
Alberta is already well underway* At present the so-called Red Deer Develop¬ 
ment Project in Alberta and the South Saskatchewan Project in Saskatchewan 
are being considered seriously by the governments concerned. The completion 
of these three projects would bring another million acres under irrigation 
in Alberta and Saskatchewan. 

One of the first problems arising in the establishment of irri¬ 
gation in a physically suitable district is that of capital expenditures 
on dams and canals* In most of the existing irrigated areas on the prairies 
private enterprise bore the original cost of the system* However, in the 
majority of cases the users of the system have been unable to meet the costs 
of maintenance and at the same time repay the capital costs. Recent develop¬ 
ments in public policy have resulted in the governments* accepting the re¬ 
sponsibility of paying for the installation of works in a new irrigation 
project, after which the users of the system would pay maintenance costs. 

Because the size of the capital expenditure involved in the estab¬ 
lishment of the proposed irrigation schemes is large the government is seri¬ 
ously considering whether or not these schemes offer the most profitable 
way to invest limited public funds. To decide this the returns on the in¬ 
vestment in each alternative opportunity must be ascertained. Any calcula¬ 
tion for this purpose requires an estimation of future returns.

Bringing irrigation to an area may give rise to a number of 
changes which benefit the whole economy as well as the area concerned* 

The output of agricultural products may be considerably increased, adding 
to the national product and giving rise to increased trade and transpor¬ 
tation opportunities. Although the gross agricultural product would increase, 
the number of farms may also increase. Thus there may be little or no in¬ 
crease in the gross or net income for individual farms. Some hydro-electric 
power may be developed for pumping or rural electrification. Certain re¬ 
creational facilities may develop. The density of population may increase, 
bringing attendant social benefits in schooling, community activities, and 
similar endeavors. 

A projection of returns involving these possibilities raises the 
problem of methodology. The use of the best methods available is desirable. 

It is therefore important that possible methods be evaluated so that the 
best possible estimates can be made. 

This study will be concerned with a problem in methodology for 
one phase of projection. To focus on specific objectives certain limitations 
are placed on the scope of the study. It is concerned with only one group 
of the above mentioned possible benefits. This group consists of the benefits 
which may arise in agricultural production. Further, of the various possible 
developments within this group of benefits, the study will be concerned with 
the output of agricultural products in relation to the inputs used in the 
production process. A further limitation exists in that this input-output 
relationship will be analyzed by the use of the analytical tool which has 
become known as n the Cobb-Douglas production function”. The study should 
then provide a basis for predicting certain developments in farm production

and income, and a.t the same time provide an opportunity, to arrive at some 
conclusions regarding the suitability of this analytical tool to enquiries 
of this nature. 

Given the natural resources available to agriculture in the area 
anticipating irrigation, to attempt an estimation of possible increases in 
production one must know the number of farms that likely will develop in 
the area and the amount of their gross returns. If the size, and therefore 
the number, of farms is predetermined by governmental decree then one must 
attempt some judgement of the likely production and income of each farm. 

Once these estimates are available a comparison with the existing situation 
should reveal what the effect of irrigation is likely to be. 

Our only bases for predicting, other than chance, are past ex¬ 
perience and theoretical reasoning. Any judgement made must be based on 
both of these sources of information. The accuracy of the estimate will 
depend upon the suitability of the methodology involved. 

The procedure for this study will be to apply the Cobb-Douglas 
type of analysis to farm data obtained from an area which has been irrigated 
for a number of years and which is similar in physical respects to certain 
areas involved in the proposed irrigation developments. The analysis pur¬ 
ports to give information not only on returns to scale but also on the 
marginal productivity of productive factors responsible for the output of 
the farms studied. In addition it establishes an equation by which output 
can be predicted if the productive (input) factors are known. Information 
of this sort would be very useful in predicting likely input requirements 
and also the size and the output of farms likely to develop in the proposed 
irrigation areas.

The study will examine first the theory contained in, and back¬ 
ground of, the applications of the analytical tool. It mail then proceed 
to apply the analysis to data obtained from irrigated farms in a selected 
area, in an attempt to obtain information on marginal productivity and re¬ 
turns to scale. Following this analysis there will be some discussion of 
the reliability of the method and its possibilities in making forecasts 
for the projected area.

II* THE THEORY OF THE APPLICATION OF THE COBB-DOUGLAS PRODUCTION FUNCTION 

TO FIRMS IN AN INDUSTRY 

A. Production Theory 

The entrepreneur in economic society faces the problem of combinr¬ 
ing the scarce resources which he has at his command to produce a product 
or products which consumers will buy. The general assumption is that he 
combines the available resources in such a way as to maximize his net re¬ 
turns. Assuming that he has perfect knowledge of the physical product from 
all the varying combinations of resources he may use, and of the relative 
values of the units of the resources and the product, and that he cannot 
influence the prices of the factors he buys or the product he sells, how 
will he arrive at the combination yielding greatest net returns? The 
following discussion will outline briefly two approaches to the answer to 
this question, which have developed in economic theory. The first, known 
as n the three variable analysis of the firm” will be dealt with more 
thoroughly than the second, which is known as ”the marginal analysis” • 

The latter will be treated briefly merely to show its relationship to the 
former. 

1* The Three Variable Analysis 

The three variable analysis of the entrepreneur’s theoretical be¬ 
havior, when all inputs are continuously variable, requires two assumptions 
in addition to those mentioned above. The first is that he uses the 
factors at maximum capacity and efficiency obtainable under existing

conditions.^- Second, he may group his inputs (resources or factors of pro¬ 
duction) into two homogeneous groups of continuously divisible factors, 
labour and capital, which substitute for each other to a certain degree. 

With these two variables, labour and capital, and a third, the 
resultant physical output, we can set up a three-dimensional diagram to 
illustrate the relationship of the three variables to each other* However, 
as it is easier to visualize, a two-dimensional diagram, which is a pro¬ 
jection of the three-dimensional production surface, is usually used. (See 



Figure I.— Input-output relationships between the two input variables, 
capital and labour, and the variable, output* 


^This assumption is necessary to give some constant point of reference upon 
which to base the logic. If an entrepreneur does not fulfill this assump¬ 
tion, using the same given quantities and quality of each factor he may pro¬ 
duce a number of different outputs. The assumption implies that for a given 
amount and quality of each input he can only produce one ‘’sensible” quantity 
of output. Cf. Bressler, R., Economics for the Natural Scientis t* mimeo. 
1945 9 Univ. of Conn., Storrs, Conn., pp. 13-14*

If the abscissa represents capital input and the ordinate represents 
labour input, we can represent the production surface in two dimensions by a 
series of M contour lines” which are called iso-product curves (l^> I2, etc.), 
because each curve is the locus of all points on the surface which designate 
equal output. Any one iso-product curve depicts all the combinations of 
labour and capital that give the quantity of output represented by that par¬ 
ticular curve. Moving along this curve labour substitutes for capital or 
vice-versa at a diminishing or increasing rate, the rate of substitution at 
ary point on the curve being the quantity of one input which will replace a 
unit of the other in combination without changing the output. If the curve 
is a straight line the rate of substitution remains the same all along the 
curve. This depicts perfect substitutability between the two factors. If 
the curve forms a right angle the rate of substitution of one for the other 
is zero, depicting the fact that no substitution is possible between the 
two factors and that they combine in fixed proportions. The usual case in 
economic production lies somewhere bet??een these two extremes because factors 
are not perfectly substitutable yet combine in variable rather than fixed 
proportions, and the rate of substitution changes all along the curves. 

That the law of diminishing returns is acting in the combination 
of these two input factors can be illustrated by a line AB drawn parallel 
to one axis intersecting all the iso-product curves. This line represents 
a plane, in the three-dimensional figure, which is perpendicular to the H 
plane and "slices” the production surface. The line of intersection between 
this plane and the production surface gives us the familiar total physical 
product curve, from which average and marginal physical product curves can 
be derived (for one factor holding the other constant).

(a) The lowest cost combination .- A "family" of iso-product curves 
therefore depicts the relationship between the physical output and the com¬ 
bination of physical inputs. However, this does not tell the entrepreneur 
which is the best combination of factors for any given output. The next 
step is to apply prices to the input variables. 

Pricing the inputs tells him the rate at which they exchange for 
one another in the Market. This rate can be depicted by an "iso-cost" curve, 

CC, which is a straight line joining the amounts of one input factor that 
will exchange for one unit of the other input factor. This iso-cost curve 
is the locus of all combinations (of the factors) having equal total costs. 

It is a straight line because the rate of substitution (in the Market) re¬ 
mains the same all along the curve. An infinite number of these iso-cost 
curves exists, all parallel to each other because the same rate of substi¬ 
tution exists at any "scale" of combination of factors. 

Now if this group of iso-cost curves is superimposed upon the group 
of iso-product curves we can see that on every iso-product curve there is a 
point, T, at which an iso-cost curve is tangent. This means that the slopes 

of the two curves are the same at the point of tangeney, and that the rate 

of substitution of factor's combining to produce the output represented by 
the iso-product curve i3 equal to the rate of substitution of the two factors 
in the Market. This point of tangencv gives the lowest cost combination of 
the two factors at that output.^* Boulding shows that the lowest cost combina¬ 
tion exists when marginal productivity of labour s price of labour 

marginal productivity of capital price of capital 

because the left-hand side of this equation gives the slope of the iso-product 

o 

curve while the right-hand side gives the slope of the iso-cost curve

(b) The highest profit combination .- The final step in the analysis 
is to find the highest profit combination* The line, SS, joining the points 
where the iso-cost curves are tangent to the iso-product curves is the locus 
of all the lowest cost combinations for the relevant outputs. By applying 
price to the product and the inputs we can calculate the total revenue and 
the total costs for any particular output. The highest profit point is 
reached when total revenue minus total cost is greatest. The point of tan- 
gency between the iso-cost and the iso-product curves at this output gives 

us the best combination of capital and labour. In the marginal analysis 
this point is reached when the marginal net returns (marginal revenue minus 
marginal cost) for all input factors are equal.-** 

( c ) Returns to scale .- The locus of the points of lowest cost 
combination has been called the scale line because it depicts the relation¬ 
ship between the inputs (when they are combined in their lo?/est cost com¬ 
bination) and the output, when the inputs are varied to scale. 

The scale line corresponds to the aggregate total cost curve for 
firms of varying sizes but otherwise homogeneous. The total cost curve for 
a single firm is derived by holding some factors (usually those associated 
with size, such as plant and equipment) fixed. One point on this curve 
corresponds to the lowest cost combination of factors. %en all factors are 
permitted to vary so that we have an array of individual total cost curves, 
the aggregate total cost curve is the locu3 of the points of lowest cost 
combination of the individual total cost curves, at given outputs for these 
curves. As Bressler states, M In a sense, we may refer'to it as a curve showing

economies of scale.Regarding this relationship, Boulding^ states that 
’Whenever we draw up a total cost schedule or plot a total cost curve, a 
complex problem of finding the cheapest combination of inputs must be solved 
before the total cost figure is reached. To say that the total cost of pro¬ 
ducing twenty-four tons is $150 implies that this is the cheapest way of 
producing twenty-four tons and that $150 is the total cost of producing 
twenty-four tons in this particular way. With other methods (or) other 
combinations of input quantities, the total cost of producing twenty-four 
tons would be larger than $150. n 

The scale line is always a "line* 1 , on the production surface (when 
we are using three variables)• If the price of one of the input factors 
changes relative to the price of the other the slope of the iso-cost curves 
will change. This will change the location of the points of tangency be¬ 
tween the iso-cost curves and the iso-product curves, thereby causing a 
shift in the scale line away from the axis of the input for which the cost 
has risen. This expresses geometrically the fact that the entrepreneur 
will use less of the costlier input and more of the now relatively cheaper 
input. 

The same reasoning may be applied to more than three variables, 
each variable having one dimension in space, but "the scale line is always 
a ®line®, even in ®n-cpace 3 , no matter ho?/ many inputs there are 1 ®.^ This 
is because it results from the points of tangency of the iso-cost surface 
with the iso-product surface. 

good explanation of the relationship of these curves is given by Dr. R. 
Bressler, op* cit . pp. 22-26,

ables we must turn to mathematics to describe the relationships.

It is this scale line and its related production function with 
which this study is concerned. The foregoing analysis has served to relate 
the factor combination to the scale line. Boulding argues that it is a tool 
by which we may roughly separate the problem of proportions of input quantities 
on the one hand from the problem of scale of operations on the other,but 
Chamberlain^ argues that the phenomena of returns to scale and of diminishing 
returns cannot be separated. 

The firm may exhibit increased, constant or decreasing returns to 
scale. If increasing returns to scale exists, doubling each input mail more 
than double the output, i.e. the output increases proportionately more than 
the inputs. Decreasing returns to scale means that an increase of each input 
by the same relative amount mail give a less than proportionate increase in 
output. Constant returns to scale depicts the fact^that increasing each in¬ 
put by the same relative amount will increase output proportionately.3 Al¬ 
gebraically we can say that if P = F(a, b, c . . . . n) represents the pro¬ 
duction function then a function showing constant returns to scale may be 
described by MP - F(Ma, Mb, Me ... . Mn). 

2. The Marginal Analysis 

The marginal analysis of the firm indicates that the lowest cost 
combination of factors is achieved when the 

marginal physical product of factor A marginal physical product of factor B - 
price of A price of B 

.... the marginal physical product factor of n ^ 

price of n •

We can see that raising the price of one input will reduce the 
quantity of that input demanded because price is the denominator in the 
above fractions. (If MPP is to become larger to balance the equation, and 
if the factor is giving diminishing returns, less of the factor will be used.) 
This reduction is due to substitution effect. There will also be a reduction 
(in the quantity of the factor demanded) due to an output effect, i.e., when 
the price of the factor rises the firm ? s marginal product cost will rise and 
the firm will therefore reduce output.1 The magnitude of the substitution 
effect depends upon the degree to which the inputs can be substituted. The 
magnitude of the output effect depends upon whether or not the input factor 
plays a large part in the production process. If the prices of all inputs 
rise in proportion there is no substitution effect but there will be an out¬ 
put effect 

The highest profit combination for the firm obtains when the marginal 
revenue product (MPP x marginal revenue) of each factor equals the price of 
that factor.3 (Marginal revenue equals price of product under pure competition.) 

Implicit in both types of analysis is the idea, that we must obtain 
first the production functions expressing the physical relationships between 
inputs and output. Knowing these we then may apply prices to the inputs and 
the output to find the most profitable combination of resources. 

From this discussion we see that the intelligent allocation of re¬ 
sources by the firm requires a knowledge of the marginal productivity and the 
marginal revenue product of each resource. These we obtained from the pro¬ 
duction function and the demand curve for the product.

The highest profit combination is an equilibrium point toward 
which firms are always striving. This does not mean that the marginal re¬ 
venue product must always equal the price of the factor. Changes in the em¬ 
ployment of a factor go on continually, and are due to variations in the mar¬ 
ginal productivity of the factor in question. These changes are initiated 
by divergences between the marginal revenue product and the price level of 
the relevant factor.-*- These divergences can seldom be measured precisely, 
there being a range of indeterminateness present. The firms do not make 
instantaneous adjustments either. Yet the principle is functioning con¬ 
tinually. If the price of a factor is less than its marginal revenue pro¬ 
duct for a length of time which permits adjustment then entrepreneurs' have 
an incentive to expand their use of that factor and their output. Similarly, 
if the price is more than the marginal revenue product, the incentive to 
contract exists. 

B. The Mathematical Tool 

Having briefly sketched the development of the production function, 
P = F(a, b, c • . • • n) let us proceed to the theoretical considerations of 
the mathematical tool for applying it to the real world. Throughout the dis¬ 
cussion we will use “output 11 as the dependent variable on the left-hand side 
of the equation, and “inputs” as the independent variables on the right-hand 
side of the equation. 

1. The Production Function 

To begin let us abstract somewhat from the real world and assume 
that we carry on a controlled experiment with one firm over time, or a number 
of similar firms at a given point of time. All the variables are controlled

except output. To the resulting data we fit a function by mathematical methods. 
This function depicts output as a function of the controlled variables. 

If the regression equation for the function contains all the vari¬ 
ables, then by the partial differentiation of the total product (the dependent 
variable) with respect to each independent or input variable we obtain the 
marginal productivity for each input.^ Euler* s Theorem shows that if the 
function is homogeneous and of the first degree then at a given level of 
input the sum of the amount of each input variable times its marginal pro¬ 
ductivity at that level, taking these products all together, will give us 
the total productv 2 

Such a function depicts constant returns to scale.3 If the sum 
of the above products were greater than the total product then we would have 
increasing returns to scale, while if the sum were less than the total pro¬ 
duct we would have decreasing returns to scale.^ Under conditions of constant 
returns to scale after each factor of production has been paid according to 
its marginal revenue product there remains no residue, i.e., the total pro¬ 
duct is just used up. 

Douglas in his Theory of Wages^ reasons that, according to the 
marginal productivity theory of distribution, if increasing returns exists 
in a firm, the sum of the marginal productivity of the input factors mul¬ 
tiplied by the -units of the relevant factor exceeds the total product. There 
would be distributed to the factors more than would be produced if the factors

were paid at the rate of the value of their marginal products, resulting in 
a loss to the firm. The firm would have to close down, if this condition 
continued. 

On the other hand, if decreasing returns obtained, all the total 
product would not be distributed to the factors of production. This would 
result in surplus profits. More people would enter the industry,1 The mar¬ 
ginal costs would rise due to increased bidding for the factors. At the 
same time the marginal revenues would fall due to a lower price created by 
a rise in supply. The firms would arrive at a new equilibrium situation 
where Euler 1 s Theorem would be applicable, i.e., where a condition of con¬ 
stant returns to scale existed. Douglas therefore concludes that, holding 
technical changes constant, constant returns to scale is the most probable 
condition, under perfect competition. 

Stigler points out that Euler*s Theorem is applicable in the case 
of constant returns to scale only at the minimum point on the long-run aver¬ 
age cost curve,2 and this point is the long-run equilibrium point of the 
firm in perfect competition.3 This, of course is implicit in Douglas* argu¬ 
ment. 

Chamberlain^- states that constant returns to scale will not operate 
in the long run. The "envelop 1 * or long-run average cost curve depicts unit 
average costs for varying outputs when all inputs vary freely in their combina¬ 
tions. Due to economies (followed by diseconomies) of proportion and scale 
combined, the "envelop" cost curve is U-shaped. Any point on this curve re¬ 
presents a plant with a given output, a portion of the average cost curve of

this plant being part of the ”envelop 11 curve. If the plant expanded or con¬ 
tracted its scale of inputs while maintaining the proportion of these inputs 
constant, the plant’s lowest average-cost curve would be above the "envelop” 
curve on either side of the point of tangency. Thus constant proportions, 
implied by constant returns to scale, would cause the U-shaped "envelop” curve 

•7 '"s 

to be more concave than when proportions vary all. along the curve. Neverthe¬ 
less, at the point of tangency between the curve of the firm and the "envelop” 
curve, at the output corresponding to the lowest point on the latter, Euler 1 s 
Theorem still holds under pure competition. Chamberlain goes on to explain 
that if along the "envelop” curve the proportions of factors change very 
slowly with variations in output, the average-cost curve of the firm varying 
all inputs at constant proportions will diverge more slowly (on either side 
of the point of tangency) than will the average-cost curve of the firm if 
it held one factor (plant) fixed and varied the others. 

2* Statistical Methods 

When considering conditions in the real world we do not find per¬ 
fect data because we can seldom perform controlled economic experiments. 
Neither are we able to measure a great many variables involved. There are 
also a number of factors which vary jointly with each other. However, if 
by controlling some of the variables,1 holding others constant,2 and group¬ 
ing other independent variables, we may reduce their number to manageable 
proportions,’ and if we can obtain independence among the groups and eliminate 
those which, a priori, have little or no influence on the variability of the 
dependent variable we choose, then by a statistical equation we may be able 
to draw some conclusions which have a good probability of coinciding with

real events. The conclusions will have a sounder basis if along with the 
mathematical logic there exists supporting economic theory, in other words, 
if the statistical equation is in some way related to economic reasoning. 

(a) Relation between the multiple regression equation and the pr o¬ 
duction f u nction .- We make use of multiple correlation methods to fit a re¬ 
gression function to the data when more than two variables are involved. 

From the multiple regression equation we can establish (1) how well the func¬ 
tion fits the data, (2) the amount of variability in output which is associ¬ 
ated with the variability in the input factors taken all together and taken 
separately (in other words the influence of the input factors on output), 
and (3) whether the relationship betvfeen output and the input factors is 
linear or curvilinear, using closeness of fit as a criterion. 

This multiple regression equation shows output as a function of 
the inputs. Thus we have a production function, which depicts returns to 
scale, as it shows the physical output of the firm at various scales of in¬ 
puts. The multiple correlation coefficient, R, tells us how closely inputs 
are related to output. The coefficient of multiple determination, R?, tells 
us what proportion of the variance in output we have accounted for mathemati¬ 
cally by the concomitant variance in the input factors we have chosen.The 
net regression coefficient for each input factor shows the average change ob¬ 
served in output with unit changes in the input factor in which we are interested, 
holding constant the variation in output accompanying changes in the remaining 
input factors.^ (One must exercise caution in interpreting the net regression 
coefficients for "they ascribe to any particular independent variable not only 
the variation in the dependent variable which is directly due to that inde¬ 
pendent variable but also the variation which is due to such other indepen-

dent variables correlated with it as have not been separately considered in 
the study.Thus, the less correlation there is between the input factors 
the more accurately the net regression coefficient expresses the influence 
of the relevant input on output.) 

In the real world it is difficult to obtain data from a single firm 
which contains sufficient range in variations of input combinations to exhibit 
effects of varying proportion and of scale. Studies of this type must utilize 
data obtained from a cross-sectional survey of the industry, assuming that the 
variations in factor combinations among firms are typical of the hypothetical 
variations facing ary single firm. A production function is obtained from 
this type of data by multiple regression methods. 

This production function, which is better known as ”the Cobb-Douglas” 
function, because it was developed by Cobb and Douglas in the latter*s Theory 
of Wages, is not the production function which appears in economic theory, 
specifically partial equilibrium theory. The latter function is applied to the 
choices of organization open to the single firm. Reder has called it an f, intra- 
firm” production function. He calls the function in which we are interested an 
”interfirm” production function.^ 

(b) Intr a firm-interfirm relationships .- In economic theory the pro¬ 
duction function of the ”intrafirm” type expresses the relationship between 
the quantities of inputs and their corresponding outputs for a firm. Given 
the demand curve for the firm , s product and the supply curves of the factors 
of production which go into the product, only one point on this production 
surface represents (an actual situation) the point at which the firm^s profits 
are maximised, and which, in the long run, is the point of lowest cost com¬ 
bination for the firm in pure competition. The other points on the surface

are hypothetical in that they tell us what the output of the firm would 
have been had it maximised profit at other output and input levels; in- 
other words they represent the firm t s temporary or short-run positions. 

The ”interfirm” function relates the output of any one of the 
firms studied to the quantities of inputs which that firm actually uses. 

The positions (on the production function) of hypothetical firms within 
the range of the data, but not included in the study are interpolated from 
those firms which were included. Thus each point on this production function 
refers to an actual input-output relationship. The function is the locus of 
all such points, each of which is on a separate intrafirm production function. 
Douglas and Bronfenbrenner offer an explanation of these intrafirm-interfirm 
relationships! which also touches on Chamberlain*s discussion dealt with 
above In essence, they point out that when each firm is in long-run equili¬ 
brium under pure competition, at the point of minimum average cost the relevant 
iso-cost curve (of the firm*s family of iso-cost curves) is tangent to a 
homogeneous function of first degree, even though the production function is 
not of this type throughout. And only this point on the firm*s production 
surface represents an actual entrepreneurial decision, all the other points 
being temporary or short-run positions. 

If a number of such points are obtained, each of which is on a 
homogeneous first degree function, and a production function is fitted to 
them, the latter interfirm function may take the form of a homogeneous func¬ 
tion of first degree, differing from the intrafirm function in that each 
point on it represents an actual rather than a hypothetical decision and 
therefore has relevance to the real world.

There is another difference between the intrafirm function of 
economic theory and the Cobb-Douglas interfirm function, which we have im¬ 
plied but not stated explicitly* The theoretical function relates physical 
input quantities to physical output quantities- The Cobb-Douglas function, 
as it has been used, relates the monetary values, or indexes of these values, 
of inputs and outputs. 

The entrepreneurs have already applied prices to the data for the 
Cobb-Douglas function. Economic theory states that the scale line passes 
through the lowest cost combination of factors for each output, otherwise, 
in pure competition, the firm could better its position by adjusting the 
combination of factors for ary given output. Thus the scale line is the 
locus of the long-run equilibrium position for each output. For the inter¬ 
firm -production function each output contour is the locus of the actual 
positions of a number of firms. To be on the scale line all the firms having 
the same output would have to operate at the same position on the curv^ that 
is, with similar combinations of input factors. 

If the firms were in fact operating at their lowest cost combina¬ 
tions under pure competition, the independent variables of the equation of 
the empirical production function would be determined and the position of 
the scale line could be found. If we could find the physical production 
function of all combinations at all outputs, to locate the scale line in 
this system of “hyper-surfaces n would require the superimposition of the 
price function. The points of tangency would locate the scale line.

a linear homogeneous first degree function.-^ Such a function describes a

surface which looks like a half cone with its vertex at the origin, A line 
from the origin, 0, to any point, P, on this surface would touch the surface 
at every point along OP. Any such line could be located by substituting for 
the variables in the equation, once the constants are kno??n. Such a line be¬ 
comes the scale line only when it is the locus of the points of tangency be- 
tween the factor-price function and the physical production function. 

The equation z - ax 4 by is another linear homogeneous first degree 
function describing a conical surface with the vertex of the cone at the ori¬ 
gin. Everything we have said above applies to this function. The equation 
of the type z « k4 ax 4- by, which some have used in this method of analysis 
is a particular kind of first degree linear homogeneous function. This is 
the equation of a homogeneous surface which is fixed in relation to the Gxy 
surface by the constant k. It is the equation of a straight line, but if 
all the straight lines which one obtains by substituting in this equation 
with positive values of x and y were combined into a surface the surface 
would, be the same as the conical surface described above. 

This then is the type of function which is fitted to data by 
linear multiple correlation methods where we use the equation: - 

* a + b 3 X 3 + • • • • 4 b n X n* TOiere X 1 is output and X 2 , X 3 etc. are 

input factors the net regression coefficients, b£, b^etc., give directly for 
each input factor, the change in output resulting from a unit change in the 
input. The change in output is the average change while holding the remain¬ 
ing input variables constant (at their arithmetic means)• This change in 
output gives an average marginal productivity for that particular input. 

The linear equation does not allow for the phenomenon of diminishing marginal 
productivity because with it the marginal product remains constant.

A function linear in the logarithms allows for diminishing marginal 
returns* The net regression coefficients in this case give immediately the 
elasticity of the product with respect to the input factors, i.e., they tell 
us by how many per cent the product increases on the average if a given in¬ 
put factor increases by one per cent.-*- Douglas and his associates have de¬ 
monstrated the usefulness of this function in spite of some criticism* 

Using this function we assume the elasticities remain constant 
while the marginal productivities vary* We can calculate the marginal pro¬ 
ductivity on the average for any one input by partial differentiation of the 
product with respect to the input factor. By doing this we see how changes 
in the,selected input change output, when the remaining inputs are held con¬ 
stant. (We hold them constant at their geometric means, because of the use 
of logarithms in the analysis.) Causality between the input change and the 
output change is established a priori. 

For the statistical analysis the equation used is: 

Log = log A4 b 2 log X 2 + 03 log X 3 + • » • . 4b n log X n * In natiral numbers 
this equation becomes: s KX^^X^ . . . . X n ^ n » (The equation used by 

Douglas and Bronfenbrenner was P =* bC^L«l.)^ 

The sum of the net regression coefficients (the elasticities) de¬ 
notes returns to scale. If this sum is less than one it indicates decreas¬ 
ing returns to scalej if greater than one it indicates increasing returns 5 
if equal to one, constant returns to scale. 3

A function in the second degree would fit data exhibiting decreas¬ 
ing marginal productivity but it necessitates more than twice the regression 
coefficients and hence a substantial loss in degrees of freedom,-^ 

3* The Assumptions Basic to the Use of This Analytical Method 

Whenever economists have used this method they have made deductions 
from empirical data. They have desired to test economic theory, as in the 
case of Douglas and his associates, or to apply economic theory to suggest a 
better organization of resources in firms or the industry concerned, as in 
the case of Tintner, Brownlee, and others in farm management studies. 

Because of difficulties involved in a temporal study of a single 
firm, the above analysts have obtained their data, in most cases, from cross- 
sectional surveys. The use of the survey-type data assumes that each firm 
has the same pattern of production techniques, i.e., that the quality of 
labour is homogeneous among firms, that the type of capital equipment is 
the same, and that other conditions of the production environment are homo¬ 
geneous. In other words, the assumption is that the production function is 
the same for the firm as for the industry, that inter-firm and intra-firm 
re3_ationships are the same. 

Another assumption is that the output in fact may be expressed as 
a function of the inputs selected. Does the function chosen express the re¬ 
lationship between the input factors, as chosen, and the output? Have the 
true inputs been chosen? If not, then we assume causality where it does 
not actually exist. 

This study is concerned with the marginal productivity theory as 
it applies to pure competition, which assumes the existence of pure competi¬ 
tion among the firms concerned, both for the sale of their products and for

the purchase of resources. This implies that employers are able to measure 
and estimate in advance the marginal productivity of any one factor, that 
the owners of the factors know the marginal productivity of the factors, 
that there is pure competition among owners of the factors, that all the 
factors are able to find employment, and that the factors of production are 
divisible, mobile, and to a certain extent, substitutable for each other. 
Along with these we may include the assumption that the entrepreneurs have 
operated and continue to operate to maximise their net monetary returns. 

The basis for all the studies has been the static theory of general or par¬ 
ticular equilibrium which does not consider the effects on inputs and outputs 
in the periods of time stiidied of the inputs and outputs in other periods of 
time. We also assume the state of arts as constant. 

Another assumption implied in the described theory and method for 
deriving a scale line from a cross-sectional survey is that each firm is 
combining its resources to obtain the economically optimum output with the 
lowest cost combination of the input factors at that output. This is an 
equilibrium position for each firm. The method has been used with data that 
was monetary rather than physical, i.e., prices had been applied to inputs 
and outputs. To derive an equation which fits the data and assume it to be 
the equation of a scale line shoivlng returns to scale, it is necessary to 
assume that all the firms are operating under pure competition at their 
lowest cost combination of factors. Without the assumption of lowest cost 
combination, substituting any set of positive values for the variables in 
the equation would give a line, but this would not be the scale line unless 
the values substituted were those of the lo7/est cost combinations. As the 
empirical equation can only have value if it can be located, the assumption

of lowest cost combination must be accepted in its construction. In order 
to make this compatible with the actual data it is necessary to derive points 
of lowest cost combination from an average of a group scattered about each 
point• 

All of these assumptions are connected with the economic theory 
underlying the development of the method. There are also certain assumptions 
and limitations involved in the use of the statistical device which we have 
described. 

It is important to remember that the net regression coefficients 
are meaningful only insofar as the independent (input) variables are a.ctually 
independent of each other. The procedure has been to group the inputs into 
a few categories, such as land, capital, and labour, to provide an equation 
of manageable size. The relationships between the inputs grouped into one 
category and the proportion in which they are combined, affect the (calculated) 
productivity of that category. 

If we are to test the significance of the coefficients involved in 
the equation we must assume that the residuals or errors are distributed 
normally throughout the data. In this connection it is well to remember that 
even a statistically significant correlation coefficient is no proof that 
causation exists. We also must rely upon reason. 

If all the variability in the dependent (output) variable is not 
accounted for by the independent (input) variables selected, we must assume 
that the remaining variability is due either to errors in the data or to in¬ 
puts which we have not included in the categories of input variables. When 
using an equation which is linear in the logarithms, the regression analysis 
gives, in a certain sense, the best estimate of the dependent variable (Log Xi)

if the independent variables (log X 2 , log X 3 , etc,) are known; but it is not 
designed to give the best estimate of the net regression coefficients.^ 

If we attempt to make use of deductions we must remember certain 
other limitations. The parameters which we estimate from the data apply 
only to the population from which the sample was drawn and to the time period 
at which the sample was taken." We also must recognise that the marginal pro¬ 
ductivity calculated for any input (independent variable) is derived by hold¬ 
ing all the other inputs constant at their means. Therefore the marginal 
productivity thus calculated applies only to a limited range of the data 

about the means at which the other factors are held constant. To apply it 

* 

over the whole range of the data would give unrealistic relationships at 
the extremities. Certainly we could not extrapolate beyond the upper or 
lower extremity of the data. 

C. Some Practical Applications of the Method 
Once we have defined the input factors and derived the marginal 
value product for each, we may then attempt to make use of the information 
in considering the organization of the firms which we have studied. We must 
bear in mind the limitations which have been outlined briefly above. 

Before one can make use of the marginal value productivity infor¬ 
mation, a serious obstacle must be overcome. We must calculate the prices 
of the input factors, i.e., the monetary value of a unit of the input factor 
in which we are interested, which unit must correspond in size to the unit 
giving us the marginal value product. Herein we have a difficult accounting 
problem to solve.

Assuming that we are able to arrive at the price of any input 
factor as defined above, we may then compare it with the marginal value 
product of the relevant input. If the marginal value product at any par¬ 
ticular level of input chosen exceeds the price then “the firm” may increase 
its net return by expanding the use of that input. If the marginal value 
product is less than the price then “the firm" may increase its net returns 
by contracting the use of that input until marginal value product and price 
are equal. 

We must note here that because of the statistical procedure used 
in calculating the marginal value product, we may not apply it to input levels 
outside a small range about the mean of that input. Note also that “the firm" 
means an average firm having a level of inputs at or close to the mean of each 
input. If it is evident that an input must be expanded (or contracted) to a 
level close to the extremities of the data then we cannot precisely say how 
far to expand or contract. We can only indicate that it would likely pay 
the firm to move in the direction which will more nearly equate marginal 
value productivity to the price of the input, but we cannot say how far to 
move. 

To make arry statements about other time periods, in which price re¬ 
lationships are different we must obtain a new production function to obtain 
new marginal value products. That is to say that any conclusions we make 
from the data applies only to that data and the population from which it is 
drawn. However, these conclusions may be useful if relative price relation¬ 
ships do not change very rapidly. 

We may also use the results of the analysis to estimate gross income 
from representative firms at various levels of inputs. If our production func¬ 
tion is homogeneous and of the first degree we are able to add together the

products of the marginal value product multipled by the number of units of 
input for each factor at selected levels of input, to obtain the total re¬ 
venue. (TR - MVP a x units of A+MVP b x units of B .... etc.) This 
does not apply to conditions of increasing or decreasing returns. The above- 
mentioned limitations on the use of the data apply to the estimation of gross 
income also. 

Another way in which we may estimate total revenue is to substitute 
for the independent variables in the regression equation. This is only valid 
over the range of the data to which the regression equation applies. 

The statistical analysis may be used also to ascertain the importance 
of the average effect of the individual input factors on the total revenue. 

In this case a comparison of one factor between groups of firms means more 
than a comparison of different factors within a single group of firms. 

The Cobb-Douglas function generally discussed in the literature 
has been derived from industrial data. Thus conclusions from its use have 
been applied to industry. If we consider the farm as a firm we are able to 
make a similar application of the method in agriculture. The validity of its 
use depends upon the assumptions and limitations discussed above.

III. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE 


The previous chapter, in reviewing the theory behind the Cobb- 
Douglas function, has dealt with some of the literature concerning this 
function* There are other discussions which have not been mentioned but 
these are concerned chiefly with the application of the method to industry* 

The method has been applied to farm management problems also* It is this 
latter use of the function which we shall review in this chapter* 

Students of farm management have long realized the possible ad¬ 
vantages to obtaining input-output curves from physical data for farms under 
study. Because techniques change relatively slowly over time these curves 
would be valid for a medium length of time, say five to ten years. The appli¬ 
cation of prices to these curves would reveal the lowest cost and highest 
profit combinations of inputs at which to operate. This aid to decision 
making, compared to the budgetary method, would save considerable time for 
the entrepreneur* 

However, numerous difficulties arise in attempting to relate phy¬ 
sical inputs to output*i There is the problem of measuring the physical 
input of capital equipment. Mary farms have more than one product, creating 
a problem in measuring physical output. Joint relationships exist which make 
it difficult to separate the effects of certain inputs on output. Neverthe¬ 
less there seems to be no good reason why these problems should be insur¬ 
mountable, given time for improvement of knowledge. 

One of the first efforts to establish input-output relationships 

%achlup, F., Exploration in Economics . McGraw-Hill Book Go., Inc., 1936. See 
Chapter IV, "On the Meaning of the Marginal Product tt . Professor Machlup’s 
discussion herein indicates a number of the problems arising, some of which 
we have mentioned.

from empirical farm data appeared in 1924*1 The authors were interested in 
presenting a method of analysis. Thus the analyses they made from empirical 
data were illustrative and fell short of what thej^ could have been had the 
authors been able to use data designed for the purpose. 

The3^ were concerned with the adjustment of detailed farm practices 
in each farm enterprise rather than with the adjustment of combinations of 
enterprises. This simplified their problem in that they dealt with only one 
product wherein the measurement of physical output is possible. 

The thesis of the bulletin is “that there is actually no such thing 
as a definite unit requirement (of inputs)2 for a specified production”• The 
authors demonstrate by the use of farm data that “there is a range, frequently 
a wide one, in the amounts of the cost elements which enter into a given pro¬ 
duct”. Thus varying amounts of input factors can enter into the same output, 
giving, of course, varying costs. 

The authors first outline a method for studying variations in inputs. 
They illustrate from empirical data how the net effect of selected inputs on 
each other can be derived by using partial correlation methods, thus estab¬ 
lishing the relationships between the various inputs. By multiple curvilinear 
correlation methods the authors determined the net effect on output of each 
individual^quantity of each input element selected, in the range of variation 
throughout the data. They then illustrated the application of price to the 
input-output relationships for arriving at the least-cost and highest-profit 
combinations of inputs.

The authors did not attempt to answer the question of how to determine 
the highest total returns from a combination of severaJ. different enterprises. 
They did suggest, however, that to deal with this problem budgetary methods 
could be used. These methods would utilize the input-output relationships 
for each enterprise modified by the intereffect of enterprises on these re¬ 
lationships. These intereffects along with certain cost values, would have 
to be estimated, ^he authors did not suggest a method for making these es¬ 
timates. 

In the bulletin it is suggested that input-output relationships de¬ 
duced by the method outlined may be used for various purposes, ^his type of 
information is absolutely necessary to any calculation of the best combination 
of inputs in a single enterprise. $uch information also may be used in cal¬ 
culating results from various combinations of enterprises. The effect of 
varying farm practices can be found by the method described, ^he authors 
also indicate briefly how the type of information obtained by their method 
may be used to set up a production standard”, in planning the overall farm 
organization on individual farms, in setting up cost indices for selected 
farm products and in making estimates of the elasticity of supply of various 
products. 

The method is subject to certain weaknesses. As the authors in¬ 
dicate, the various inputs do not vary independently of each other. Grouping 
associated inputs may eliminate part of the errors due to these joint re¬ 
lationships. Some input variables with which the authors did not deal, e.g. 
capital, are difficult to allocate to the output to which they contribute. 
Quality of inputs such as labour or capital is not taken into account, neither 
is the effect of management.

Although these and other weaknesses pointed out by the authors 
exist, the study was a step in a desirable direction. It outlined a method 
for deriving physical input-output curves to which prices can be applied. 

The method has a sound statistical basis which produces results comparable 
to experimental procedures. To quote the authors: 

The use of this method ( multiple correlation )^ secures 
results from the farm data comparable with those obtained under 
experimental conditions. In an experiment all factors were held 
constant except the one whose effect it is desired to measure. 

This can not be done under farm conditions. The use of multiple 
correlation does eliminate the variations in other factors and 
obtains results from which the effects of all other (measurable) 
factors have been eliminated. Such results reveal the net effect 
in actual farm practises of variations in an individual input 
practically as accurately as those obtained in the artificial 
setting of controlled conditions in the laboratory or test-plot. 

A number of studies patterned after the above analysis took place 
in ensuing years.- Usually they tried to establish input-output relation¬ 
ships by statistical treatment of data obtained from farm survey records, 
dairy-herd improvement records, and supervised accounting records. 

Because of dissatisfaction with the reliability of the data and the 

’• X , 

range which the data covered, Jensen, et al, designed a study to obtain more 
reliable original data.3 By holding other factors constant under experimental

for dairy herds at ten different stations in central and eastern United States. 
The inputs and the outputs were measured accurately. The data covered a wide 
range of grain and roughage inputs. The experiment was conducted over a 
period of three years. 

This study is unique in that it combined the research of both tech¬ 
nicians and economists to obtain data which would be useful to the producer 
in calculating his best returns from available resources. However, the study 
concerned itself with a single input category, namely feed, and with a single 
output, milk. The chief problem was that of holding "other things" constant, 
which was done by the experimental technique and not by statistical methods. 

To conduct similar studies for other products and other inputs would 
be expensive but data gathered therefrom would be useful for a number of years, 
although it would be more difficult to study certain inputs and their relation¬ 
ship to outputs by this experimental method. 

In 1943 Tintner and Brownlee applied the Cobb-Dcuglas type of pro¬ 
duction function to farm survey data in an attempt to separate out the net 
influence of selected input categories on output.! The data were obtained 
from 1939 business records of 468 farms belonging to the Iowa Farm Business 
Associations. These associations were composed generally of above-average 
farmers and therefore were not typical of all Iowa farms* The annual inputs 
of each farm were grouped into six categories: land (acres in the farm), 
labour (total months, including family and operator), farm improvements 
(buildings, fences, etc.) liquid assets (livestock, feed, seed, fertiliser, 
etc.), working assets (farm machinery, breeding stock, equipment other than 
buildings and fencies used in producing livestock, etc.)., and cash operating

expenses (equipment repairs, fuel, oil, feed purchased, etc.)* The output 
measurement was gross profits. The farms were divided into five types accord¬ 
ing to the product from which they obtained the largest share of their incomes. 
With the input categories as the independent variables and output as the de¬ 
pendent variable a function was derived to fit the data for each type and 
for the whole sample. 

The investigators used a function which is linear* in the logarithms. 
Of this function they say: 

Such a function implies substitutability between the 
various productive agents. In addition to the fact that the func¬ 
tion fits the data reasonably well, this form of function has been 
chosen because (l) the regression coefficients are the elasticities, 
i.e., they indicate the percentage change in output which will on 
the average result from a one percent increa.se in the input of the 
various factors} (2) it permits the phenomena of diminishing mar¬ 
ginal returns to come into play without using as many degrees of 
freedom as would be required by a quadratic function} (3) such a 
logarithmic transformation of the variables will presume to a sub¬ 
stantial degree normality in the distribution of errors in the data 
(assuming that such errors are small and normally distributed)• 

Even though the errors are not independent and are not normally 
distributed, one still obtains the best linear estimate of the re¬ 
gression coefficients by using the method of least squares, al¬ 
though test of significance are no longer reliable 

By this analysis the investigators arrived at a number of con¬ 
clusions regarding the data. In all cases the coefficients of multiple 
correlation were high and significant which meant that it was highly prob¬ 
able that the input categories chosen had an influence on the output. About 
74 per cent of the variation in gross profits was explained by the factors 
included in the analysis. Of the thirty-six coefficients of net regression, 
twenty were significant at the 5 per cent level or lower, sixteen were not 
significant, three of these being negative in value. Cash operating expenses 
and land had a significant effect on gross profits in all cases, while working

assets had no significant effect in any case. Of the factors having a sig¬ 
nificant effect on output, the elasticity of output with respect to land v^as 
greater for the crop type than any other type. The same could be said of 
labour. This was interpreted to mean that land and labour had the highest 
marginal productivity in the crop type farms. Similarly, other deductions 
were made regarding the marginal productivity of other factors. 

All elasticities were less than unity which meant that the factors 
all exhibited diminishing returns, and the marginal product would decx*ease 
with added units of the factor in each case. 

By partial differentiation the marginal product for each input 
factor was actually calculated, holding the other input factors constant. 

It appeared that the marginal product for improvements was less than for 
cash operating expenses, liquid assets and working assets. The authors 
therefore concluded that the farms, on the average, were overimproved and 
that each dollar spent in the latter input categories would bring greater 
returns than if it were spent on improvements. Because the marginal pro¬ 
ductivity of cash operating expenses was greater than that of working assets 
they concluded that this may indicate that equipment was being replaced before 
it had depreciated to an economical point and that it might have been better 
to spend money on fuel, oil, and repairs rather than replace machinery so soon. 

The three cases for which negative elasticities occurred were dis¬ 
carded as being economically meaningless, ^he reason given was that w it 
seemed unlikely that production should actually decrease if certain factors 
of production are increased®. 

For all types but the crop type, the sums of the elasticities were 
less than one. This meant that all but the crop type exhibited diminishing 
returns to scale. The authors pointed out that this might be expected, since

management was not included as an input. If it could have been included the 
returns to scale may have been constant or even increasing. 

Another aspect of the analysis, as the authors state, is the fact 
that the marginal productivities are estimated at the geometric means. In 
other words, in holding all the factors constant but one, they are held con¬ 
stant at their geometric means. Therefore the marginal productivities cal¬ 
culated apply only to changes in inputs of the various factors at these 
geometric means. 

During the same year in which the above study was done, Tintner 
carried out a similar study with different data.2- He derived the data from 
farm business records of 609 Iowa farms for the year 1942. As in the pre¬ 
vious study, these farms belonged to the lows. Farm Business Associations 
and therefore cannot be considered typical of all Iowa farms. As Tintner 
states, they could be considered to have the same relationship to average 
farms as yields on experimental stations have to average yields. 

He dealt with these farms in the same way as he and Brownlee 
dealt with the farms in the previous study. He grouped the farms into four 
types, according to the product which produced the largest share of the in¬ 
come for each farm. He also used the same input categories as used in the 
previous study. This, he explained, was an arbitrary choice of variables, 
easily replaceable by another categorization. Again, output was expressed 
as gross profits. He used the function linear in the logarithms for the 
same reasons given above and because it does not assume homogeneity, i.e., 
the sum of the net regression coefficients need not equal unity. Tintner 
cautions that **it should be remembered that ‘cur 1 regression analysis is 
not designed to give the best estimates of the regression coefficients. It 
only gives, in a certain sense, the best estimates of the dependent variable

(the logarithm of the product), if the independent variables (the logarithms 
of the factors of production) are known.” 

Briefly, the results and conclusions are as follows: With the 
tests for significance based on the assumption of normality of the residuals, 
all of the multiple correlation coefficients were significant, i.e., it is 
very unlikely that they could have arisen by chance if the true correlation 
coefficients in the hjrpothetical population were zero. The inputs, taken 
together, accounted for 62 per cent (in the case of hog farms) to 72 per 
cent (in the case of beef feeder farms) of the variability in the dependent 
variable (output). All types except the dairy type showed diminishing re¬ 
turns to scale. The omission of management may have had an influence on 
the findings, as is pointed out in the previous study and again in this study. 

Besides obtaining a function for each type of farm, Tintner also 
fitted functions to all the farms, with and without working assets. Con¬ 
sidering the total of the 609 farms the factors of production in the order 
of their elasticities were: land, liquid assets, cash operating expense, 
labour, and improvements. Working assets seemed to have a negligible in¬ 
fluence on gross profits. He points out that ”these elasticities are not 
equivalent to marginal productivities. They have, however, a close relation¬ 
ship to them. Their importance for economic policy is obvious.” -All factors 
showed diminishing returns to scale. 

Tintner also devised a statistical significance test for returns 
to scale. An analysis of variance did not refute the hypothesis that the 
sum of the regression coefficients is unity. He established confidence 
limits from the data for the sums of the regression coefficients. Neverthe¬ 
less, he points out that, although there were diminishing returns to scale in 
every type but dairy production, if management were included as a factor

there very well could be constant or even increasing returns to scale. (He 
suggested that perhaps dairy production shows increasing returns because of 
the discontinuities introduced by the labour factor. These discontinuities 
exist in other types in which labour is not so important as in dairy pro¬ 
duction. ) 

No further studies of this type appear in the literature until 
1946. The results of a study by Heady-*- published that year constitute the 
latest to be published along these lines. 

Heady used data obtained from the business records of a random 
sample of Iowa farms for the year 1939. The data were taken by the survey 
method from 782 farms. This survey was primarily for another study but 
Heady made use of the data for his production-function analysis. Tintner 
and Brownlee had analyzed a group of above-average farms but Heady was in¬ 
terested in the average farras for Iowa. The sample had been designed to ob** 
tain unbiased estimates of certain crop and. livestock inventories and pro¬ 
duction. Inventory estimates for most categories of resources used by Heady 
should be unbiased. However, there was probably some memory bias on the part 
of the farmers for such items as income and expenditures. 

The account of this study devotes more space to describing the input 
categories than had previous studies. The inputs were classified partly on 
an n a priori ,, basis and partly on the basis of preliminary analysis. 

The categories of variables used by Heady were as follows: 

(1) Output (the dependent variable) - total product in dollars as measured 

by cash sales plus farm production consumed in the farm home plus in¬ 
ventory increases plus government payments. The expression ox the

efficiency of the resource combination in terms of total product is 
not a limitation. To quote the author, "obviously the operator who 
realizes a gross product of $1.40 per $1.00 of input will have a 
greater net profit than one who realises $1.20. 11 

(2) Real Estate - the value of land and improvements on each farm measured 

in dollars. The dollar value allows for variations in productivity 
from farm to farm. Errors in the evaluation of real estate were prob¬ 
ably greater than for any other asset since only a small fraction of 
the farms is on the market in any one ye ar. 

(3) Labour - measured in months. This included hired, operator, and family 

labour. The measurement did not provide for variations in hours per 
day, in days per month, nor in the quality of labour. Neither did it 
afford a means for comparing the productivity of labour at different 
seasons of the year. 

(4) Machinery and Equipment - in dollar values. The measurement ireluded 

the beginning inventory, repairs, and fuel and lubricants for the year. 
A preliminary analysis revealed a high correlation between these in¬ 
dividual items. 

(5) Livestock - the dollar value of livestock on hand plus livestock purchased, 

plus livestock expenses plus feed fed to livestock. A high correlation 
existed between livestock and feed fed. 

(6) Gash Operating Expenses - the dollar value of fertiliser, twine, custom 

work, and other miscellaneous operating expenses not already designated. 
The function fitted to the data in this study was of the same nature 
as that used by Tintner and Brownlee. It was used for the same reasons given 
by these two workers in their previous studies. A function was derived for

each of several subgroups designed to reveal differences in input-output 
relationships among five types of farms, among five types of farming areas, 
and between "large” and ”smell” farms. 

All multiple correlation coefficients were found to be statistically 
significant. For the whole sample. 78.8 per cent of the variance in output 
was associated with the variances in the input categories used. Crop types 
showed the least variance to be accounted for,, (67.8 per cent), while special 
farms and dairy dual-purpose farms showed the greatest. Comparing ”iarge n 
farms to ”small” farms, a smaller percentage of the variance in output was 
explained by variations in input for the ”small” than for the "large” farms. 
The author points cut that ”a study based on the * large 1 farms alone Y/ould 
thus lead to the erroneous conclusion that scale of operations is relatively 
more important in determining 1 total product than actually holds true on 
all farms or for 1 small* farms.” The "unexplained” portion of variance in 
the total product can be attributed partly to variations between farms in 
techniques employed, weather conditions, and perhaps to some extent prices 
received for the products. Part of the variance "not explained” may grow 
out of errors in reporting original data. 

Each input factor showed diminishing returns for all types. The 
"Livestock and Feed” input category showed the highest elasticity and mar¬ 
ginal productivity. "Labour” was not statistically significant in any case. 
"Real Estate” was significant in all cases, as was "Cash Operating Expenses”. 

A few negative elasticities appeared to which no economic significance was 
attached, for the reason given by Tintner and Brownlee. 

Diminishing returns to scale appeared to exist for all cases but 
management was not included as a factor. Had it been included the results 
regarding returns to scale may or may not have been different. Inability to

a 


measure management, however, is a weakness which is not unique for this type 
of analysis. 

Heady devoted some space to some of the limitations of the method 
which had not been discussed in the reports of previous studies. Grouping 
the inputs into (assumed) homogeneous categories presents a problem. Certain 
factors which are complementary tend to be used jointly on the farms. Statis¬ 
tical results for any one of them taken individually have little practical 
significance. However, when the gross correlation is high between two or more 
factors they should be combined and considered as one type of input. 

It is also pointed out that: 

The functions which have been derived in this study are 
of the interfirm rather than the intrafirm variety. Although they 
may be looked upon as averages for all farms, they do not necess¬ 
arily coincide with that for any one farm. Some homogeneity has 
been introduced by grouping farms according to type or location. 

Even then it can be expected that a multitude of functions exists 
even with these groups because of the varying combinations of 
techniques employed and commodities produced. 

Comparisons of statistical results mean more when made for one 
factor between farm groups than between factors in one group. In some 
cases the classification of resources used includes a complete accounting 
of inputs for the production period, while in others it probably does not. 
Therefore the comparison between input categories for one group is not as 
meaningful. For example, labour was measured in months and therefore corres¬ 
ponds to the inputs for the year. Machinery was measured in dollar value of 
inventory but the real input for the year is depreciation and related expenses. 

The study suggests the use of this analysis to establish the pro¬ 
ductivity of each resource for use in calculating net productivity figures

(management return or labour income). The use of market rates when charging 
out returns to each resource does not necessarily reflect the actual pro¬ 
ductivity (and therefore the rate of charge) for a resource. 

This analysis eliminates problems growing out of ownership of pro¬ 
duct or resources. All inputs are related to total output for the year 
selected, regardless of who owns the resources (landlord or tenant) or where 
the product goes. 

Heady does not state whether or not this analysis offers the best 
of several alternatives. This is yet to be proved. He says that it does 
offer interesting possibilities. 

This type of analysis was the subject of a thesis (unpublished) 
submitted by H.W. Harries to the Graduate Faculty at Iowa State College in 
1946.^" The purpose of that study was to analyze the cost structure within 
the agricultural firm; or more specifically, within wheat farms for which 
operating data were available. Only one production period was considered 
so that the immediate concern was the short-run situation. Harries attempted 
to measure costs and output and to relate them through some mathematical 
function. 

The selection of a sample from a straight wheat-farming area in 
Saskatchewan removed some of the problems which existed in previous studies. 
Market conditions for the products and the productive agents were essentially 
similar, for various farms, as were methods of production. The farms were 
subjected to reasonably uniform weather and soil conditions. These conditions 
affecting the sample offered good grounds for the assumption that variations 
in output among farms was due to variations in inputs.

The problem of measuring output was simplified by two conditions. 
First, the farms were essentially single-product farms. Secondly, marketing 
of wheat was under the control of the Canadian Wheat Board at the time of 
the study, which subjected all the farms to more uniform market conditions 
and price. 

The data were obtained by the survey method. With this method, 
although the sample is randomized to give unbiased estimates of population 
parameters, other biases may result. Harries mentions some of theses 

(a) A memory bias on the part of the respondent. 

(b) Dishonesty on the part of the enumerator. 

(c) Deliberate distortion of facts by the respondent, 

(d) Incomplete records leading to faulty cost appraisals. 

(e) Poorly constructed questionnaires. 

The study utilized three types of functions. A linear homogeneous 
function and a function linear in the logarithms (the same as used by Heady, 
Tintner, and Brownlee) were fitted to the data from one group of 194 farms 
on Land Class III. Another function, a quadratic function, was fitted to 
data from 9S farms on better land, Land Class V, in the same area. The 
selection of a function to describe a relationship is based upon two con¬ 
siderations: (1) What 11 sense” does it make in terms of economic theory, and 
(2) how well does it n fit n the data? Economic theory suggests that a pro¬ 
duction function may exhibit characteristics such as diminishing marginal 
productivities, but marginal productivities which are positive throughout 
that part of the function which is of economic significance. The fit may 
be described by the correlation coefficient. 

The variables (input categories) used in the two linear equations 


were as follows:

Average real estate investment - the farmer 1 s estimate of the 
value of the land only. 

Average livestock investment - this did not account for trans¬ 
actions occurring during the year but assumed little diffi¬ 
culty on this account on these wheat farms. 

Average machinery investment - the farmer*s statement of the 
value of his farm machinery. Depreciation less cost of 
repairs was added to the end-of-the-year estimated value. 

Months of labour - hired labour plus family and operator*s 
labour. This measurement of labour is distorted by the 
inclusion of the operator’s labour on the basis of farm 
residence. No consideration is given to intensity or 
quality of labour. 

Cash expenses - fuel, lubricants and repairs, custom work, 
seed, and miscellaneous expenses. 

These were the independent variables selected. The dependent vari¬ 
able was output, which was calculated from the current receipts from crops, 
livestock, custom work, change in inventory of livestock, feeds and supplies, 
and seed, to give a gross figure. To this was added the farm perquisites 
after which capital expenditures on livestock were deducted to give a net out¬ 
put figure. (Note that this is not a net returns figure.) 

The variables for the quadratic function were fewer. Fixed costs 
(those costs which were not dependent upon the output of the product during 
the period considered) and variable costs (those costs which were dependent 
upon output) were used as the independent variables. Fixed costs were made 
up of n total farm capital” as calculated from the farmer’s evaluation of land, 
buildings, machinery, livestock, and miscellaneous equipment. Variable costs 







45 


were composed of cash expenditures, depreciation expense, and labour expense. 
The dependent variable was output as calculated previously. 

For all three functions the multiple correlation coefficients were 
statistically highly significant. For the linear function all net regression 
coefficients were statistically significant at or beyond the 5 per cent level. 
For the function linear in the logarithms, two of the five net regression 
coefficients were not significant. For the quadratic function, fixed costs, 
n variable costs squared”, and ^variable costs cubed” were significant, but 
”variable costs” was not. 

In deciding which function best described the data, both from an 
economic standpoint and from a statistical standpoint, Harries discarded 
the linear function because of the necessary assumption that the marginal 
productivity of the factors remains constant, thus denying the existence of 
diminishing returns. He states that we might be able to assume constant 
marginal productivities if there were complementarity in the data and if 
effective management were to increase as the size of the enterprise increases 
so that as additional units of input are subscribed they are not utilised 
less effectively. For the linear multiple correlation analysis to have 
validity these two conditions must be in evidence. That these rather exact¬ 
ing demands were met in the area studied was questionable. 

The function linear in the logarithms assumes one of the three 
conditions of increasing returns, constant returns, or diminishing returns, 
and no more than one of these conditions in the data. That is to say, the 
function does not allow for an inflection point in the production function. 
This limitation was not serious enough to require disregarding the function. 

The quadratic function permits diminishing returns. The degree 
of curvature depends upon the relative importance of each term in the equation. 
This analysis should thus provide a test for the hypothesis that the data 
follow the law of diminishing returns.

At this point the writer cautions against an extensive application 
of the quadratic analysis. Quoting the author: 

To derive a function as we have done and then vary one 
factor while holding the other constant can only have validity 
within some small segment of the function range of the variables. 

Thus if we follow the procedure of varying variable costs while 
holding fixed costs constant at the arithmetic mean we obtain 
not the actual relationship at the extremities but some unreal¬ 
istic one. ... to hold fixed costs constant and attempt to 
vary the variable cost throughout the data range will be non¬ 
sensical. 

The study concludes that the quadratic function using inputs 
classified as "fixed” and "variable” costs gave the most satisfactory re¬ 
sults from both an economic and a statistical viewpoint. The serious gaps 
in the use of this function can be closed only by more accurate data, which 
would enable a more rigorous selection of the various cost categories. 

Thus the study concludes that the cost curves within the wheat 
farms studied were definitely U-shaped. This means that there is a definite 
limit to the economic size of firm for these farms. 

Another conclusion which followed from the linear logarithmic 
analysis was that "the marginal productivity of land, machinery and current 
cash expenses is relatively high at the mean value of each of these items, 
which would suggest that risk and uncertainty may play a significant role in 
limiting the use of these resources and hence the average size of the firm.” 

The brief account above of the work that has been done in the field 
of the present study illustrates some of the problems which arise in attempt¬ 
ing to use production functions. It also illustrates the type of conclusions 
the workers have attempted to draw, to help solve organization problems 
arising in farm management. 

The study by Jensen, et -al,l was restricted in scope in that it was

concerned with only one variable factor (all other factors being held constant) 
within one enterprise* The study by Black, et al,^- did consider a few more 
variables but only as they concerned a single enterprise. 

Both studies illustrate methods of attempting to note the effects 
on output of certain selected input variables, by eliminating the effect of 
remaining input variables. Jensen, et al, accomplished this by the experi¬ 
mental method while Black, et al, used statistical methods applied to data 
from cross-sectional surveys. 

These two studies derived production functions which showed the 
effect on output of each additional unit of input over the range of the data. 
By using these input-output schedules the authors were able to calculate 
the lowest-cost and highest-profit combinations. This means that they could 
tell the farm operator how far to go in expanding or contracting the inputs 
included in the studies. An answer to the problem of adjusting inputs for 
a combination of enterprises was not attempted in either study. 

This type of stvdy should, find its greatest usefulness in extension 
work with farmers. It could be used to draw up n standard” plysical production 
functions for various types of enterprises and for various input factors. 

These standards would be useful in applying the budgetary method to the prob¬ 
lem of adjusting inputs to best advantage for a combination of enterprises. 
However, it may be that deriving standards for various enterprises in vari¬ 
ous areas and under various conditions, which would be necessary to make a 
valid application of the production standards, would be an expensive pro¬ 
cedure. 

The four studies that utilised the Cobb-Douglas production function 
were attempts to study input-output relationships on a more general basis,

where a combination of enterprises existed. This creates certain inherent 
difficulties in the study. For instance, the physical outputs of different 
enterprises such as crops and livestock cannot be added together. They 
must be converted to the common denominator of dollar value first. The use 
of the dollar value exposes the application of the measurement of output to 
all of the effects of variations in prices and money value. 

This type of study, which combines the enterprises, avoids the 
problem of allocating inputs to each enterprise. A study of input-output 
relationships for a single enterprise necessitates deciding what proportion 
of certain inputs actually goes into producing the output of that enterprise. 
However, as in the single enterprise type of study, the Cohb-Douglas type of 
study does encounter the problem of joint-relationship in allocating inputs 
to selected input categories. 

The Cobb-I)ouglas analytical tool gives results which are not as 
useful in helping the individual farmer adjust his inputs as is the other 
type. The marginal productivities which were obtained are valid only at the 
geometric means of the inputs. This means that the analysis may indicate 
only the direction in which to adjust inputs and cannot indicate how far to 
go with the adjustment. However, a knowledge of these marginal productivities 
should be useful in decisions involving agricultural policy. 

All of the above studies have one or two common weaknesses. None 
of the studies took into account the variations in quality or the indivisib¬ 
ilities which existed in certain input factors. 

The studies involving the use of the Cobb-Douglas type of function 
all used the equation linear in the logarithms and discarded the linear equa¬ 
tion. The latter was discarded because it did not allow for diminishing mar¬ 
ginal productivity. Hoi^ever, if the equation fits the data as well as or

better than the logarithmic equation it seems possible that over the range 
of the data studied constant marginal product1vity did in fact exist. Harries, 
using the logarithmic equation and a quadratic equation (after discarding the 
linear equation for the reason given above even though it fitted the data 
better) concluded that the cost curve for the firms studied was U-shaped, 
thus indicating a limit to the size of firm. A U-shaped cost curve follows 
if a logarithmic or quadratic equation is used. It is possible that over 
the range of the data a horizontal cost curve may have existed. 

Heady attempted to deal with some of the problems which had been 
raised by previous studies. He used data which were more representative of 
all Iowa farms* He also tried to classify input categories (on the basis 
of a preliminary analysis and fl a priori” reasoning) to obtain more inde- 
pendence between input variables, by including in the same group variables 
showing joint relationships. He also attempted to account for variations 
in quality of the real estate input by measuring it in dollar values. 

Harries was able to eliminate to a considerable extent certain 
sources of error occurring in the data analyzed by the other studies. The 
data in his study came from crop farms raising wheat predominantly. These 
farms likely had a more uniform production pattern than the Iowa farms, al¬ 
though the studies of the latter achieved some homogeneity by grouping the 
farms into types. The data from the wheat farms reduced the problem of 
measuring output in that the output in each case was predominantly wheat. 

All of the data for these studies came from surveys which were de¬ 
signed for other purposes. In the case of random samples the data were not 
taken so as to ensure uniform scatter along a regression line. Thus any 
application of the conclusions drawn from the extremities of the data would 


be unreliable

Although no farm management studies involving the Cobb-Douglas 
approach appear in - the literature since those reviewed above, a number of 
articles have appeared recently in the Journal of Farm Economics 1 in which 
this type of analysis is discussed. We will therefore review these articles 
briefly, touching only on ideas contained therein which are relevant to this 


study• 

Fellows- takes the position that the type of study done by Jensen, 
et al, which derives production functions for physical production response, 
can be more helpful than the type of function used by Tintner, Brownlee, 

Heady, and Harries. The latter type can be criticized for its weakness in 
not being able to tell how far to go with adjustments which it indicates are 
necessary. This is the same criticism which is often made of the widely used 
cross-tabular approach to factor-analysis. Fellows suggests using physical 
production functions as building blocks to which price and cost data may be 
applied to sythesize economic models. The chief drawback at present is that 
very few physical production functions are available, n nor will they be in 
the reasonably-near future unless there occurs a marked change in agricultural 

research. ^

Hopkins-** discusses briefly several methods which have been used 
in attempts to solve the problem of M identifying, isolating, and measuring 
the inf line nee that each independent factor exerts on the dependent factor 11 
in analyzing farm management data. Several conditions inherent in farm 
management data tend to make the problem very complicated. There are usually 
many independent factors to be identified. In nearly all cases the influence 
is not linear but responds to diminishing returns within the range of a given 
study. Most of the distributions are not normal but are skewed to the right. 
The relationships are not additive but joint, i.e., the influence of one in¬ 
dependent factor on the dependent variable is influenced by the size of another 
independent factor. There is also the problem of causal relationships when 
a change in the magnitude of one independent variable is the direct result 
of a change in the magnitude of another independent variable. 

In discussing the technique of mathematical correlation, Hopkins 
points out several advantages and disadvantages: 

The advantages of mathematical correlation are: (l) it 
makes more efficient use of data than the other methods, (2) it 
measures the degree of correlation between the factors being 
studied, and (3) measures of reliability, and the standard error 
of estimate, can be computed from the calculations required for 
the regression equation. 

The disadvantages of the method are: 

. . . (1) it is difficult and tedious to work . . . ; (2) the 

biggest weakness of this method is that the selection of the for¬ 
mula determines the general nature of the line .... Thus he 
(the analyst ^predetermines his answer a great deal by his selec¬ 
tion of a formula.3

In discussing the problem of causal relationships between inde¬ 
pendent variables, Hopkins states: 

... when a causal relationship exists between two inde¬ 
pendent factors, the net effect of one of the independent fac¬ 
tors on the dependent factor cannot be determined. The true 
combined effect can be determined using multiple joint corre¬ 
lation, provided the correct mathematical formula is selected. 

... If the purpose is to determine the most favorable com¬ 
bination of highly inter-related factors, should we concern 
ourselves with trying to isolate and measure net effects of 
each factor? From the multiple joint correlation regression 
equation the most favorable combination of factors can be 
arrived at mathematically by use of the integral and differ¬ 
ential calculus. 

Hopkins concludes by suggesting the combined use of the various 
methods so as to avoid their weaknesses and utilize their advantages. 

In his article the following year. Fellows^ briefly describes 
three models which may assist in solving farm management problems. These 
models are: the single variable analysis, where all inputs but one are 
assumed fixed; the three variable analysis, such as described in Chapter II 
of this thesis; and the multivariate analysis with more than three variables, 
such as described in Chapter II. 

Each model is useful when applied to conditions within its scope. 
For instance, the single variable analysis is limited to instances where 
one is interested in the consequences of changes in one input factor, it 
can be used as an analytical tool in such studies as that made by Jensen, 
et al, in the effect of feed input on output. The second model is more 
practical in that it can be used to study the effects of two varying inputs 
which are substitutable for each other to a certain degree. An example of 
a problem where this' model may be used lies in the adjustment of roughages 
and concentrates in a feeding program* The last model is even more practical

Problems", op. cit .

in that it may be used to study the effects of a number of variable inputs, 

^Output can now be expressed as the complex function of a great many vari-

ables ♦ . . .” 

Fellows believes that in farm management it is not yet possible 
to use the last analytical tool. Physical production functions in approp¬ 
riate form are not readily available from physical sciences. We need more 
development in calculating equipment. We also need among present day econo¬ 
mists a better understanding of mathematics. Until these obstacles are re¬ 
duced or removed we must rely on more tedious budgetary methods of synthe¬ 
sizing mod-els for farms of different organization. 

The above theories and models do not solve problems, but assist 
in the application of the scientific method to farm management problems. 

James*s article-*- points out some limitations of certain methods 
of farm management analysis and of static economic theory. Some of the weak¬ 
nesses of static economic theory place severe limitations on any method of 
farm management analysis which is rooted in that. base. The set of assumptions 
which underlie static analysis remove it from the conditions of the real world 
so that most of our farm management studies are from an w ex post” position 
whereas the farmer must make decisions from an tt ex ante” position. Uncertainty 
is a major factor here, and static economic analysis does not provide an ans¬ 
wer to questions of risk and uncertainty. 

Some interesting discussions follow Fellow*s and James’s papers,* 2 
S.A. Engene takes the view that theories and models should be sufficiently 
complete and realistic so that close approximations to solutions of problems 
can be obtained from them, at least this should be the goal toward which we

move* Theories should be something more than n simplifying devices which 
help us to grasp concepts”. 

^ngene takes a more pessimistic view of static analyses than does 
Fellows in that at best they are approximations. These approximations may 
not be good enough for practical use. Nevertheless, ”static theory can pro¬ 
vide a stepping stone to a more adequate theory”. 

L.C. Cunningham opposes the attitude of "that new fraternity of 
economists, the members of which talk about 1 theoretical models 1 * . . , 

1 production functions® • • • and * firms® meaning farms”, which is extremely 
critical of the farm management research of the past forty years. Rather, 
he would not cast past results aside but use them as part of a basis for 
future work and continue to improve our hypotheses, sampling procedures, 
and methods of analysis* 

Heady-*- discusses some of the shortcomings of empirical research 
in production economics to date and indicates some of the fields of theory 
the application of which may reduce these weaknesses and improve the results 
of empirical research. Development in the application of theory to the prob¬ 
lem of empirical research has lagged behind the development of the theory. 

He proposes "that the problem of empirical observations is more serious than 
lack of theory for applied research”, and points out some developments in 
theory which thus far workers in empirical research in agricultural production 
economics have failed to utilise, at least to ary extent* 

Some of Heady®s comments are relevant to this study. In discussing 
returns to scale and farm size he points out that "farm management studies 
historically have suggested highly increasing returns to scale in agriculture, 
e.g., consistently greater residual profits to larger farms”. Yet even in

highly mechanized areas farms change size at a slow rate. This "suggests 
the hypothesis of constant returns to scale; hence that small farms can com¬ 
pete successfully with large farms". %sk and uncertainty and immobility 
of the human resource possibly influence this condition. There is as yet 
no existing study in farm management which gives a clear understanding of 
the nature and extent of economies of scale in farming. The public argument 
centering around farm size is actually one of variable proportions (the 
possibility that more and more acres can be farmed with a given amount of 
capital and labour). But to obtain more objective analyses of farm size, 
"there is a need for empirical estimates under both concepts". 

In dealing with model building, Heady mentions the lack of 

... 1 general production functions 1 for estimating the produc¬ 
tivity of broader categories of resources, such as labor, capital 
and land. The single equation production functions of the Cobb- 
Dotglas category has been little used and meagerlv appraised. 

(ihile the specific form of the Cobb-Douglas function was logarith¬ 
mic, alternatives such as linear, quadratic and other functions can 
be applied in single-equation form.) 

Johnson, in his article^ mentions a few aspects of the problem 
of estimating value productivit}*- functions for different categories of re¬ 
sources. (Some of these are discussed in Chapter II.) 

The proportions in which the inputs making up a resource 
category are combined affect the productivity of the category. The 
logical, nonarbitrary procedure is to combine inputs according to 
the proportions dictated by the scale line. But the scale line de¬ 
pends on relative prices and the function re3.ating specific inputs 
to outputs. Thus, investigators tend to use data gathered from 
firms operating at one point in time, hence at one set of relative 
values. This procedure defines a definite scale line. But a point 
in time is a very short run and, unless the resource category is 
carefully defined, many of its components are fixed.- 

In the discussion following Johnson*s paper. Haven reports a study 
recently carried out at the North Dakota Agricultural College which utilized

the single equation approach as well as the simultaneous equation approach 
to identifying and measuring variables. He points out that the study suffers 
from a lack of knowledge about the management function, which, in his opinion, 
needs a great deal of emphasis because the entrepreneur has to use ary con¬ 
clusions from these studies in a dynamic setting. Nevertheless the results 
should be useful as a first approximation of such things as the optimum size 
and the nature of returns to scale of operations. 

Bachman*- touches on problems in using production theory. He points 
out that when a farmer changes techniques there is a shift in production 
functions, which may result in changes in output for the same quantities of 
input factors. New varieties of crops, improved types of equipment, and 
methods of pest control are examples of technological factors which may give 
varying outputs for the same quantity of inputs. In economic theory the 
techniques of production are assumed to be constant. This is unrealistic, 
and raises complications when attempting to apply theory to empirical in¬ 
vestigations .2 

Bachman also suggests that by the joint use of imagination, obser¬ 
vation (or n facts n ) and theory (or logic) analysts may select from the in¬ 
finite variety of possible input-output relationships, those relationships 
which have a significant effect on farm organization. This enables concern 
tration on problems which have major influences in farm management. 

Among some of the problems spoken of by Nesius in his article^ 
is the problem of the accounting system used for inductive analysis. To 
maximize allocative efficiency among resources by equating marginal value 

^Bachman, K.L., op, cit . 

^Some of these technological causes of output variation can be held constant 
by sampling methods, an example of which appears in the present study.

productivities requires the true inputs of the resources. Constant real 
estate values, straight-line depreciation, flat rates of interest, valuations 
of resources according to the market values, actually or subjectively de¬ 
termined, produce data which are of questionable value in determining marginal 
value productivities of resources. "By the manner of subjective determination 
of value and assumed straight-line costs, how can the researcher derive any 
set of cost or income curves corresponding to the theoretical models? 11 Modi¬ 
fication of the accounting system to fit specific purposes, i.e., to be able 
to use the data to verify hypotheses, is needed. 

D. Gale Johnson conducted an empirical analysis of some 1939 data 
in an attempt to find the marginal productivities of capital and labour em¬ 
ployed in agriculture in four agricultural regions in the United States*^ 

He utilized the Cobb-Douglas function of the form P = aL^C3, making much the 
same analysis of agricultural data as was made of industrial data by Senator 
Douglas and his associates. He incorporated the results of this analysis 
into his recent book, Forward Prices for Agriculture.^ T.W. Schultz also 
makes use of the results of this analysis in his book. Production and Welfare 
of Agriculture.3 

Measuring labour (L) by man-years, capital (G) by value of land 
and buildings, and output (P) by value added, Johnson found the regression

He notes the evident increasing returns to scale and that if the fac¬ 
tors of production were paid according to this marginal productivity the total 
payments would exceed the total value of the product. However, ”capital ration¬ 
ing by limiting the size of the firm can force a discrepancy between the rates ' 
of payments and the value of the marginal productivity without excess profits 
existing”. Similarly, the firms could be operating under conditions of in¬ 
creasing returns to scale with no further increase in size. 

Schultz used the results of this study to partially support his con¬ 
clusion that “American agriculture by and large is very inefficient”. From the 
analysis it appeared that for the average output of the farms (a weighted mean) 
of |800 the marginal productivity for capital was 12 per cent and for labour 
f>390. ”The latter marginal productivity is almost identical with the average 
farm wage rate for 1939.”^" Thus the marginal efficiency of capital in agri¬ 
culture was well above the going rate of interest, even with a liberal allow¬ 
ance for risk and uncertainty, while the marginal efficiency of labour was far 
below the going rate of comparable labour in other fields. This is one part 
of the evidence which led Schultz to his conclusion regarding the efficiency 
of American agriculture. 

This lengthy review of the literature is an attempt to cover the 
published material which is relevant to this study. Undoubtedly there exists 
more unpublished work along these lines but it has not been available for re- 
view. Enough material has been included from each study to give the reader 
some idea of the way in which the various economists have attempted to incor¬ 
porate production theory into empirical research. We have tried to note the 
difficulties encountered by those attempting to apply the Gobb-Douglas func¬ 
tion to agricultural data. Specific conclusions from various studies have been 
included to indicate the possible areas in research where the analytical tool 
may be usefully applied.

IV. ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE POPULATION FROM MICE TEE DATA COMES 

A. The Farm Is A Firm 

Basic to our study is %he assumption that the farm is a firm in 
the economic sense. Boulding defines the firm as 

. . * an institution which buys things, transforms them in 
some way, and then sells them with the purpose of making a pro¬ 
fit. The things a firm buys we call * inputs*. The things it 
sells we call Outputs*. The process whereby the things it buys 
are transformed into the things it sells we call the 'process of 
production* 

The firm is often called a business. It is the process which 
defines a business, not the individual who conducts it, ”a process whereby 
certain inputs valued in dollars in some way, are transformed into outputs, 
also valued in dollars in some way”.*- This process calls for decisions as 
to ¥irhat product or combination of products to produce, what combination of 
available resources to use and to what size to build the enterprise. The 
theory of production attempts to explain what occurs within the firm as a 
result of these decisions when they are rationally made, the criterion for 
a rational decision being profit maximization. 

The farm is a producing and decision-making unit. The farmer, 
as manager of this firm, allocates resources according to the theory, to 
the best of his knowledge. No farmer deliberately misuses the resources 
over which he 1ms control, for too many mistakes will eliminate his busi¬ 
ness. The farmer is aware of the principle of diminishing returns and, in 
effect, equates marginal cost and marginal revenue when making his decisions. 
The extent to which he approaches the true equality does not depend upon the 
principle but upon the farmer's knowledge of prices, costs, and the technical

coefficients. As his knowledge of these things increases he will be able 
to apply the principle more effectively."** 

Apropos these thoughts, Heady made some interesting remarks in 

1948: 2 

The rational use of resources and the maximisation of 
returns is, of course, the very core of the economics of produc¬ 
tion or the theory of the firm. It sets forth the necessaiy con¬ 
ditions for the most efficient use of resources or the maximiza¬ 
tion of profits. Some few reject the idea that any relationship 
exists between farm management and the principles or theory of 
production. It is difficult to understand why this should be so. 

There are few if any agricultural economists who question that 
supply and demand determine prices in a competitive market or 
that this concept is of va.lue as an analytical tool. Yet the 
conditions which are given as necessary for profit maximization 
are as commonly and widely accepted in economics as is the law 
of supply and demand. Furthermore, these necessary conditions 
are as exact in the sense of mathematical proof as the law of 
supply and demand, and empirical verification is perhaps even 
more readily possible. 

Economists can accept the fact that the farm is a producing, de¬ 
cision-making organisation but theories recently advanced do not accept 
profit maximization as the sole criterion of rational decisions by the farmer. 
His efforts to maximize net returns may be modified by a desire to minimize 
risks, in which case he may sacrifice some profit to diversify to a greater 
extent or to reduce the scale of his enterprise(s). He may also value con¬ 
sumption or leisure highly and therefore be influenced to maximize utility, 
rather than net returns alone, thus affecting his use of capital and his own 
labour. A great deal of work is necessary to test the application of these 
ideas to farm management by empirical research.-

In dealing with our specific problem, however, we are more in¬ 
terested in the results of decisions made by the farmers (under all these 
influences) rather than how the operators have arrived at these decisions. 

We have mentioned before that the only bases for forecasts are past experi¬ 
ence, theoretical reasoning, and chance. Of these, the first two are gen¬ 
erally accepted as the better. In basing our forecasts on past experience 
and reasoning we must take cognizance of the dynamic influences mentioned 
above on the farmers 1 decisions. For the period of survey the data are re¬ 
sults of the actual risk and uncertainty ?>rhieh the farmers had. faced up to 
that time, of the effects of results of past decisions on current decisions, 
of the changes in the state of the arts, and so on. In using ary conclusions 

obtained from the data to make forecasts we must remember the dynamic nature 

* 

of the economy. 

B. Perfect Competition 

The assumption of perfect competition includes a number of assump¬ 
tions some of which we cannot validly make without modifications for the 
farms in our stridy* We can assume 'with confidence that for the farms in 
the population in which we are interested the prices of their products and 
of the resources or production factors which go into that output, are given. 
Neither the individual firm nor the entire group is able to influence these 
prices by the quantity of product sold or of any factor purchased. This 
would not apply if we were considering agriculture, or any sector of it, as 
an industry, where the demand curves for the product and the supply curves 
for the factors are usually sloping. 

The marginal productivity theoiy assumes that the entrepreneurs 
are able to measure and estimate in advance the marginal productivity of the

factors which they use. Farmers do make such estimates and in measurable 
terms, for they certainly want to know whether or not an additional input 
will at least pay for itself. However, the accuracy of these estimates de¬ 
pends largely upon the farmer's knowledge of prices and technical coeffici¬ 
ents. This knowledge varies among farmers, yet few of them make large mis¬ 
takes and continue to operate as a going concern very long. 

The theory also assumes that the owners of the resources have a 
knowledge of the marginal productivity of the factors of production. This 
thejr must have in order to price the factors correctly under competitive 
conditions. Our study is not concerned with testing how closely the factor 
prices have approached the marginal productivities, therefore we need not 
make this assumption. 

As this study is not concerned with testing the marginal produc¬ 
tivity theory we need not be concerned about the assumption of perfect know¬ 
ledge. We are interested in what has occurred under the influence of what 
knowledge the farmers and the resource owners have possessed. Nevertheless 
we will make some reference to this assumption when we come to apply our 
findings to forecasting. 

The use we make of the scale line involves the assumption that 
each firm on the production function is operating at its lowest cost combina¬ 
tion. This implies that the factors are divisible, substitutable, and mobile. 
We cannot claim them to be perfectly so in agriculture, but a good deal of 
divisibility, substitutability, and mobility does exist. Capital has cer¬ 
tainly been able to substitute for labour, particularly in recent years. 

When dollar values are placed on such things as buildings or machinery, a 
fair degree of divisibility may be achieved. True, one man is an indivisible 
unit of labour but certainly he can alter the number of hours he puts into 





63 


the productive process, Mobility of certain resources, such as land, may 
be low but alternative uses to which they may be put do exist. Dynamic 
conditions of the past decade have served to increase mobility of resources 
by providing a high degree of employment in our economy, making it easier 
for factors of production to move into better alternative opportunities. 
Nevertheless, such influences as psychic income and habit still maintain 
certain immobilities for labour and management in agriculture. These in¬ 
fluences have been offset to a degree by an increase in knowledge among 
farmers in recent years. 

In vie?f of these considerations it seems reasonable to assume 
that the firms, given time to settle into their production pattern, do 
approach their theoretical lowest cost combinations, i.e., the best pro¬ 
portions of input factors. At least they are as close to it as the know¬ 
ledge of their entrepreneurs enables them to be. As knowledge increases 
we may expect a closer approach. We do know that the firms are not using 
exorbitant amounts of certain factors to the near exclusion of other factors. 

In terms of our model, if the iso-product curves are not curved 
very sharply there would be an arc near the point of tangency (between the 
iso-cost and iso-product curves) over which a change in combination of 
factors (while remaining on the iso-cost line) would not produce a notice¬ 
ably large change in output. In this case the firm might deviate to some 
extent from the lowest cost combination without having any practical effect 
on output. Our interfirm production function under these conditions could 
be visualized more as a "tube” than a straight line, a tube which would permit 
inclusion of most of the firms because their deviation from the true line 
wouldh*t make much practical difference. The size of the n tube ,! could be 
measured in terms of the standard error of estimate of the multiple regression

The slope of the iso-product curves at any particular point on 
the curve expresses the rate of product substitution^ between factors. If 
the curvature is small then the rate of product substitution at different 
points on the curve would not change rapidly, (if the curve were a straight 
line the rate of product substitution would remain constant as we move along 
the curve.) If the curvature is great, the rate of product substitution 
changes, rapidly as we move along the curve. Since the rate of product sub¬ 
stitution of factor A for factor B is equal to the marginal physical pro¬ 
ductivity of factor B divided by the marginal physical productivity of factor 
A,^ from a knowledge of the marginal physical productivities we may obtain 
an idea of the curvature of the iso-product curves. With this knowledge we 
may get some idea of the practical importance of the departure by the firms 
from their actual least cost combinations. 

C. Output Results From Inputs Chosen 

A full discussion of the input categories we have chosen will 
appear below. We will attempt to hold constant the unmeasurable natural 
factors. ATI other inputs except management will be included in our categori¬ 
zation. The output we have chosen is, a priori, a result of natural factors, 
management, and the inputs we have chosen. 

Management has not been measured as an input. The results of many 
of management 5 s decisions will be included in the other input categories. 
Timing is a decision of management which is often important. We believe that 
the timing decisions in crop production are fairly homogeneous throughout 
our population because the environment dictates when to carry out certain 
practices. Those farms diverging very far from this timing of cultural prac¬ 
tices either fail, or are so unique that we have not considered them representa-

tive. A similar condition exists with the livestock enterprise. Farmers 
that have operated long enough to be settled in their production pattern 
are fairly uniform as to the time of breeding, the best feeding period, and 
so on. There may be small variations among managers in timing but for those 
who have settled into a pattern of production in a restricted locality the 
practical effect of these variations on output is probably negligible. True 
enough, the timing of the purchase and sale of feeders affects the revenue 
derived but this is because of price variations. The actual physical output 
would not be affected to any significant extent. 

Decisions as to which crops to grow may create some variation in 
output but there exists a limited range because of climate and soil. There 
are factors which limit the types of livestock which a farmer may choose to 
produce yet he does have some choice. We will discuss these decisions, as 
applied to our sample, when we describe the population. 

We believe, and assume in this study, that by restricting our 
sample and making certain adjustments (which we will discuss later), the 
input factors which we have chosen take into account all of the decisions 
of management which have a practical effect of any importance on output. 
Therefore we have excluded management,"per sd ! , as an input factor, i.e., we 
have assumed it to be constant in the same way that natural factors are con¬ 
stant. That is to say, we are holding constant those intangible qualities 
which do not show up in our other input categories. The amount of capital 
currently in use by the farmer is a measurable result of his ability to save 
and borrow. The labour he puts in is a measurable result of his decisions 
on work versus leisure. True, we cannot measure the hours he lies awake at 
night making decisions but the tangible results of his decisions show up 
in the machinery, livestock, buildings, labour, etc. which he owns or uses.

(Also, under pure competition the quality of these input factors is recog¬ 
nized in their evaluation*) The results of decisions will vary and this 
variation will produce variation in outputs among farms. The unmeasurable 
part of management we assume applies in equal proportion to all farms in 
the sample. Just as rainfall per acre is the same for all farms so the 
”amount” of this unmeasurable factor is the same per common unit. As farms 
vary in size so the total “amount” of management varies. 

It seems opportune here to consider the matter of returns to scale. 
Some economists postulate decreasing returns to scale in agriculture, while 
others make a fair case for constant returns. The former theorists point 
out that management is a fixed factor which, when all other factors are vari¬ 
able, gives us eventually decreasing returns to scale of use of other factors. 
This is a matter of variable proportions and is feasible when considering 
the organization of an individual firm. But when we consider a number of 
firms in the industry and permit management to vary we may conceivably get 
constant returns to scale. The very few empirical studies dealing with re¬ 
turns to scale certainly do not prove decreasing returns to scale.^ 

On the other hand Douglas*s reasoning2 may be used to argue that 
constant returns to scale likely exists in agricuLture.3 Jones^ also argues 
for constant returns to scale in agriculture, the major premise upon which 
his paper is based. As pointed out by Stigler5 and by Chamberlain^ Euler*s 

^Tintner, G., op. cit . See also. Heady, E.O., n Production Functions From a

Theorem applies at the lowest point of the long-run "envelop” cost curve. 
Considering Chamberlain*s discussion briefly outlined above,it may be that 
in agriculture the proportions of inputs change very slowly along the "envelop” 
curve. Thus over a certain range there may be a sector near the point of 
tangency between the average cost curve of the constant proportions firm and 
the "envelop" curve, at the long-run equilibrium point on the latter, over 
which, for practical purposes, Euler*s Theorem would apply. "Since in long- 
run competitive equilibrium every point P (the equilibrium point in the long 
run under pure competition, i.e., the point of minimum average cost)^ corres¬ 
ponds to a point on a homogeneous production function of the first degree, 
the entire family (comprising the *distributive* or * interfirm* production 
function)^ may take such a functional form. "3 

We should note that the empirical studies and the theories to 
which we have referred are dealing with the industry and not the individual 
firm in agriculture. Our study is concerned with the industiy-type situation, 
i.e., a number of firms, not with the individual firm. Under these conditions, 
where constant returns to scale presumably exist, the accompanying presumption 
is that the u nines,surable portion of management varies in proportion to size 
of farm. 

It therefore seems reasonable to assume that, by holding natural 
factors and the "unmeasurable" portion of management constant, the variations 
in output among farms is due to the variations in the input categories we 
have chosen.

D. Homogeneity of the Sample 

As we have mentioned above, the use of the scale line assumes that 
each of the firms studied is operating at or near the lowest cost combination 
of input factors. Two firms may be using identical amounts of input factors 
but because of different efficiency in their use of these factors their out¬ 
puts may differ. This means that they would have different production func¬ 
tions. The use of the scale line therefore also assumes that the firms dis¬ 
tributed along the line have similar technical environments and approach 
similar levels of efficiency. 

The validity of this assumption as far as our study is concerned, 
can be judged best by a description of the environment surrounding the farms 
studied. The farms are located in the Eastern Irrigation District of Alberta 
(see the accompanying map). They are in so restricted an area as to be 
affected by the same climatic and weather conditions. Relying upon the best 
information available from the Dominion and Provincial soils experts, the 
farms were selected from an area over which the soil type is fairly uniform. 

It is a heavy soil of silty loam or silty clay loam texture, in the Brown 
Soil Zone (Alberta). Soil and topographical conditions affecting irrigation 
do vary somewhat but, as discussed later under "Land Input”, we will attempt 
to hold these factors constant. 

All farms in the area rely upon irrigation for moisture. Except 
for unusual years if there were no irrigation there would be no crops. All 
farms obtained plenty of irrigation water so that there were no shortages in 
the period under study. Farmers with experience in irrigation know when water 
is needed and when the land has had enough. These limits are dictated by 
weather and climate, plant requirements and soil conditions. In view of these 
considerations we can say that for all practical purposes the crops throughout 
the area received the optimum amount of moisture.

Another technical factor which may cause variation in output 
among farms having the same quantity and quality of inputs is the cropping 
pattern* Here we found a certain uniformity among the farms but variability 
did exist. Data on practices in previous years were not taken, but from 
discussions between enumerators and various farmers it appears that there 
was very little planned rotation, at least there seems to be little variation 
in productivity which can be attributed to varying rotations. What rotation 
did exist ?,ras forced onto the farmers interviewed by the exigencies of irri¬ 
gation. Keeping the heavy soil friable necessitates the use of legumes and 
grasses to a certain extent. The maximum length of time for cropping with¬ 
out legume or grass rotation is difficult to state but from Table I it appears 
to be about five years. One farmer had used land for grain, with some summer- 
fallowing, for seven years, but he stated that the land was in such poor 
condition that he could no longer postpone seeding it down to alfalfa or clover*

70 


About one-fifth of the land is summerfallowed. The farmers claimed 
this to be a necessary minimum to achieve ary control over weeds. 

From Table I it appears that on the average about three-fifths to 
two-thirds of the land was used for grain and/or potatoes, (There were only 
a few small acreages of potatoes grown. They are inc3.uded with grains be¬ 
cause they do not return any fiber or fertility to the soil.) This seems to 
be about the maximum acreage the farmers could devote to grain. For several 
reasons, during the past five to ten years the farmers have tended to raise 
as much grain as possible. This probably has been due to price relationships, 
habit or custom, and a lack of technical knowledge about their alternative 
opportunities. Some years the acreage in grains on individual farms may be 
higher than this average but this cannot be maintained for long because of 
the effect of irrigation on the soil. 

The degree of uniformity in cropping practices which does exist 
among the farms is evident. Although there is some variability which may 
produce unaccounted-for variability in output, there is justification for 
the assumption that, for practical purposes, there is uniformity among the 
farms studied. 

' There is a greater degree of uniformity in cultural techniques 
practiced among farms. For drawbar power they all use tractors, almost ex¬ 
clusively. These tractors vary in size somewhat, but a large number of farms 
have three-plow tractors. Variation in size of tractors and other machines 
is accounted for in the input categories we have used. The tillage equipment 
used on the land is fairly uniform among farms. Variation in the amount of 
work done on the land is accounted for in the inputs selected. Harvesting 
methods are also fairly uniform for ary particular type of crop, although 
there is more variability here, in the type of equipment. For the small,

acreages of grain, as compared to dry farms in neighbouring territory, the 
variability in costs caused by differences in harvesting equipment is neg- / 
ligible. Some custom work is done, and this is all of the same nature* 
Variations in quantity exist but this will be accounted for in the inputs 
used in our analysis. 

The question of the effect of differences in types of livestock 
on variation in output also arises* One farm may have a daily enterijrise 
while another farm mtrj have a beef enterprise. Both could have the same 
input quantities, as measured in most farm surveys, yet derive different 
outputs. Another case where unmeasured variation may exist would be where 
two farms each has a beef enterprise but one farmer raises grade stock while 
the other raises purebred stock. These farms would have different production, 
functions. 

Ho farms in our study had clear-cut cattle enterprises of the 
types mentioned above. Usually, the cattle were all grade animals and of 
"common” quality. Ho distinction was made by the farmers between dairy and 
beef stock. Economic factors influence the location of specialized dairy 
farms in the area. In selecting the sample such farms were not considered 
representative and therefore were excluded. 

A great variety of livestock enterprises cannot exist in the area 
because of the limitations in feed crops grown*and in grazing available. 

Most of the farms having livestock had some cattle, a few hogs, and a few 
chickens. This pattern was quite uniform throughout the sample so justifi¬ 
cation exists for assuming the population to be homogeneous throughout in 
its livestock production pattern. 

The location of a farm with respect to a market may cause variability 
in output for which a production-function analysis cannot account. However, 
the farms in this study are reasonably homogeneous in this respect.

Each of the factors which we have discussed probably cause some 
variability*in output. But, within the limits of the accuracy of measure¬ 
ments available and of the size of variations necessary to influence farmers* 
decisions, there is considerable justification for assuming homogeneity among 
the farms in the population studied. 

The empirical data used in the analysis are concerned with one 
production period. Variations due to technological change thereby are 
avoided. This procedure also gets away from the problem of measuring costs 
over time, but on the other hand there is the problem of allocating the 
fixed costs or long term costs to the annual period. 

The survey method used assumes that the homogeneous firms operating 
at lowest cost combination (having had time to settle into their production 
patterns at that combination of factors) represent the various organizational 
alternatives of a single firm all of whose inputs are variable. The accuracy 
of the survey method w per se” has been demonstrated adequately by research 
workers in farm management.^

V. SAMPLING PROCEDURE 

The method of analysis used herein imposes restrictions upon the 
sample which are unnecessary with completely random sampling. The popula¬ 
tion itself must be restricted, to utilize the method. The discussion in 
the previous chapter shows that achieving some degree of homogeneity among 
farms necessitates confining the population to a fairly uniform soil type 
and topography, to a small area which is subject throughout to the same 
climate and weather, and to an area in which all farms are at a uniform 
distance from the important markets for their produce. Within the area 
selected the cultural methods practiced must exhibit some degree of uniformity. 

The sample came from just such a restricted population. Extra¬ 
ordinary farms, such as those for which specialty crops constituted a high 
proportion of their output, and those which, because of their economic loca¬ 
tion, were engaged in dairying as a main enterprise, were excluded. 

Fitting a regression line to the data imposes another restriction 
upon the population. If there are few farms at the extremities of the data 
their influence on the slope and position of the regression line is unreli¬ 
able. These farms are usually at the extremities for extraordinary reasons 
which do not apply to most of the farms in the area* Therefore these farms 
were excluded from the population* 

In view of these restrictions the population comes from the area 
shown in the map (page 67a). Information pertaining to 1946, obtained from 
the Eastern Irrigation District office at Brooks, Alberta in 1949 by the 
Economics Division, Canada Department of Agriculture, gave a basis for select¬ 
ing the population and the sample. This information was somewhat out of date 
by the summer of 1950, being nearly two years old, but it was the best advance

information available. This data gave, for each farm in the Eastern Irri¬ 
gation District in 1943, the location, the payer of water rates, the acre¬ 
age improved and unimproved, and the livestock existing on the farms at the 
time. Acreages and livestock numbers were ditchriders* estimates and there¬ 
fore subject to error. 

The area studied contained a total of 353 farms. On the basis of 
the advance data these farms fell into tvfo types, crop and livestock. The 
criterion for a crop farm was that it should have no more livestock than 
those necessary to supply the family with meat and livestock products. As 
an objective measure the number of livestock for a crop type farm was set 
arbitrarily at a not more than two beef animals, two dairy animals, two sheep, 
two hogs, and 100 poultry”, ^he criterion for a livestock farm was ”any farm 
that had more livestock than stated in the criterion for a crop farm”. Accord¬ 
ingly the 353 farms divided into 86 crop farms and 26? livestock farms. 

To achieve some uniformity of "scatter* of farms along the regression 
line necessitated some control of the independent variables. (Certain types 
of experiments permit the independent variable or variables to vary under 
control to observe how the dependent variable behaves.) The size of farm as 
measured by productive acres seemed to have, a priori, more influence on out¬ 
put (the dependent variable) than any other independent variable. Achieving 
control over the variation in productive acres should enable us to note the 
influence of this factor on output, We will also attempt to find the effect of 
variation in livestock numbers on output by controlling this variation. Stra¬ 
tifying the population according to size as measured by the two input measures, 
productive acres and numbers of animal units, provides a method for controlling 
the variation in these two input factors. However, when the farms are grouped 
into ty pes on the basis of animal units the range of the variation in livestock

numbers within each group is narrowed, so that the farms will be distributed 
uniformly along the regression line only with respect to the size of the 
land input. 

The 86 crop farms fell into the following frequency distribution 
when stratified according to irrigated crop acres (the only productive acres 
of importance in the area)s

The farms in the tails of this distribution, 0-40 acres and 241 
and over acres, were not considered typical and therefore were discarded. 

This left a population of 83 farms from which to choose a sample. 

A similar treatment of the livestock farms revealed a new problem. 
Twenty-four of the 267 livestock farms had so many dryland acres as to border 
on a ranch-type farm, using irrigated land for a supplementary source of feed. 
To ensure the inclusion of only those farms on which irrigated crops consti¬ 
tuted the prime enterprise the 24 farms having over 320 acres dryland pasture 
were excluded from the population. 

The remaining 243 livestock farms were stratified according to 
animal units per 100 irrigated crop acres and irrigated crop acres, as

To ensure a suitable distribution along a regression line those 
farms belo?f 5*1 and above 30.0 animal units per 100 irrigated crop acres 
were excluded, along with farms having below 41 and above 240 irrigated 
crop acres. The scatter of farms over the tails of the distribution was 
too thin to draw a suitable sample. This left a population of 165 livestock 
farms from which to choose a stratified sample. 

After defining the population, a sample was chosen in the following 
manner. Those farms below 5.1 animal units, which were discarded from the 
livestock farms, were included in the crop type farms. Thus the stratifi¬ 
cation of the population from which the sample came appeared as fo3.1ows:

This gave a population of 265. From these farms it was desirable 
to choose 30 crop type farms, 30 "mixed" farms (light in livestock - 5*1 

to 20*0 animal units per 100 irrigated crop acres), and 30 livestock farms 
(relatively heavy in livestock - 20.1 to 30.0 animal units per 100 irrigated 

crop acres)• This grouping would afford an opportunity to study the effect of 
increasing livestock on output for the whole 90 farms. It would also enable 
a comparison between crop type and the heavier livestock type, between which 
there is a definite break. 

The farms in each stratum were randomised to avoid bias in sampling. 
An attempt was then made to enumerate eight farms from each crop type stratum 
and five farms from each livestock type stratum* 

With reference to this sampling procedure. Heady states: 

... Obviously, this ( the 1 block* sample )^ is not the most 
efficient sample for estimates of regression coefficients. Instead 
the appropriate sample is one which gives (approximately) an equal 
distribution of the independent variate throughout the entire range 
of the data (as many cases in the tails of the distribution as at 
the mean, mode, or other point of the distribution). The sample is 
still random but it is stratified in the sense that an equal number 
of cases are drawn at random at each point (or within each interval) 
over the entire range of the data. ^ 

Because of rapidly changing conditions the probability was great 
that the farms in 1950 would differ from their position in 194& in size, as 
measured by irrigated crop acres, and in livestock intensity, as measured, 
by animal units per 100 irrigated crop acres. It was decided to proceed 
with the enumeration, adhering to the random pattern, allocating each farm 
to its relevant stratum on the basis of findings during enumeration, until 
the required number of farms in each stratum was obtained.

Unless advance information about the population is up to date 
some adjustment between existing conditions and the sample as designed is 
often necessary. Soon after enumeration began it became necessary to use a 
criterion for a ^settled pattern”. An arbitrary decision was made to use 
only those farms on which the land had been irrigated and farmed for a mini¬ 
mum of ten 'years and on which the operator had had at least three years 1 
experience as an operator of an irrigation farm, The latter minimum time 
limit should have been extended to five years but it appeared doubtful 
whether or not 90 farms would be available under these conditions* 

After visiting 132 farms the enumerators obtained 39 records that 
were useful in this study* Fifteen farms were excluded after a preliminary 
visit with the operator because they were represented by some of the farms 
previously taken. Of the other 73 farms, seven were excluded from enumera¬ 
tion because their organization was too complicated to permit enumeration 
without large errors, five farms were larger than the limit of size accept¬ 
able in the sample, three were being farmed as a speculative side-line, 
three operators refused to co-operate, and about 60 farms had had a change 
of operator so recently that the production pattern was not settled* Some 
of these might have been suitable if the operator previously owning the farm 
could have given a record of the 1949-50 operations with the relevant inputs 
he had developed to that time* 

From the difficulty encountered in obtaining the sample we can see 
that any deductions made from the data apply only to farms falling within 
the restrictions which define the sample. 

The records of the 89 farms which were obtained were distributed 


as follows:

*Th© six farms over 240 acres in size were used in the study to reduce the 
travelling necessary to obtain the sample. The size of these farms ranges 
from 241 to 303 acres. This also applies to the five farms having over 
30.0 animal units per 100 irrigated crop acres. 

Crop type farms. 

Taking all the farms together there is a reasonably good distribu¬ 
tion along a regression line for size as measured by animal units and by 
productive acres. To obtain some idea of the effect of livestock, the farms 
were grouped into "crop type”, "mixed type", and "livestock type". All farms 
but those in the crop type, defined above as being below 5*1 animal units per 
100 irrigated crop acres, were arbitrarily allocated to mixed and livestock 
types. Those farms having between 5*1 and 17.5 animal units per 100 irrigated 
crop acres were grouped in the mixed type, and those having over 17.5 animal 
units per 100 irrigated crop acres were grouped in the livestock type. This 
basis for typing should afford, for comparison purposes, a distinct difference 
in organization between the crop type and the livestock type. 

Anyone who has enumerated data on farms for economic studies will 
appreciate the fact that exigencies occur in the field which cannot be fore¬ 
seen. Such exigencies make it difficult to adhere rigidly to original sampling 
plans. One common difficulty arises from lack of information about the popu- 







































lation beforehand. Another obstacle in obtaining useful data is the length 
of time each individual farmer is able or willing to give to the enumerator. 
Three hours is the maximum to expect from a patient farmer while many farmers 
become restive after t?/o hours. Both of these obstacles prevented the enuin- 

♦ 

erators for this study from obtaining the desirable quality and amount of 
data. As occurs in most research work, some compromise was necessary between 
theory and practice in order to obtain any conclusions. From the above de¬ 
scription of the sampling procedure one may glean some idea of the extent 
of the compromise.

VI. THE ANALYSIS OF THE DATA 


A. Selection of the Categories of Variables 
1. The Criteria for Selection 

The multiple regression equation relates a dependent variable to 
two or more independent variables. Since the purpose of this analysis is 
to find the effect of inputs, separately and collectively, on output, it is 
necessary to let output be the dependent variable and to let inputs, however 
categorized, be the independent variables. 

The farm f s production process is complicated. There are numerous 
variables which have an effect on the output. To obtain a manageable equation 
it is necessary to group these variables into categories in order to reduce 
the number of variables in the equation. The usual number of variables 
appearing in previous studies of this type has been six or seven. An attempt 
will be made in this study to use only six, one dependent variable (output) 
and five independent variables (input categories). 

Deciding just how to group the numerous variables into six categories 
first requires some criteria as a basis for the grouping. It appears desirable 
to approach as nearly as possible a physical measurement of inputs and outputs. 
The production functions upon which the theory of the firm is based are ex¬ 
pressed in physical terms. Another reason for attempting to obtain physical 
measurements or their equivalent is that most farmers attempt to produce all 
they can (within the limits of their knowledge, their techniques, and the in¬ 
puts available to them) from their farm, whether the price of their product 
goes up or down, unless the fall is great and prolonged, and they have alterna¬ 
tive opportunities. Thus a physical measure of the variables would tend to

be more stable than value measures* The latter are subject to price fluctu¬ 
ations as well as the physical fluctuations. 

The other criterion used in this study, as a basis for classifying 
the variables, is that the input variables should be as independent as possible. 
The degree of validity of the measurement of the influence of each independent 
variable on output depends directly on the degree of independence. 

It will hardly be possible to obtain complete independence among 
the input categories because of the joint relationships existing in the agri¬ 
cultural production process. Nevertheless by grouping together those vari¬ 
ables which have a close relationship, as determined a priori and by the gross 

correlations between variables, some degree of independence should be obtain- 

* 

able. 

With these two criteria in mind we may proceed to classify the vari¬ 
ables into suitable categories. Certain further criteria will appear but 
these will be specific to individual categories, appearing as the relevant 
category is dealt with. 

2. The Categories of the Variables 

(a) Output .- It appears reasonable to discuss the dependent variable, 
output, first, because knowledge of the composition of this category may 
assist in defining certain of the input categories. 

This variable will be measured by, and expressed as, the gross out¬ 
put of the firm for the relevant production period. This corresponds to the 
measurement of output used for the theoretical production functions in equili¬ 
brium theory. Also, Heady*s argument appearing above-^ is pertinent here. 

So far no worker who has used this type of analysis has suggested 
a physical measurement by which the outputs of different products can be

added together. Such a measurement would be easier to achieve for single 
product farms but for mixed farms, such as we find in the irrigated area 
with which this study is concerned, the problem has not been solved. The 
only way by which the outputs of the various products can be added together 
is by converting them to the common denominator of money value. Inis has 
been necessary also in the present study. 

One advantage of measuring outputs in terms of value is that such 
a measurement accounts for variations in quality of outputs occurring among 
farms. 

The output measurement for each farm in this study is the value 
of gross output for the production period. This gross output is made up of i 

(1) Total crop yields minus the amount of that yield 
that was fed; 

(2) Garden produce and fruit used and sold; 

(3) The livestock products used and sold; 

(4) The pounds of meat produced during the relevant 
^year” of the record. (This figure was calculated 
by subtracting livestock purchases from the change 
in livestock inventory plus the livestock sales, 
plus the deaths plus livestock consumed on the farm.) 

Only that output for the production period was included. For in¬ 
stance, any payments received on grain marketed during previous years were 
not included. Also., only the output from the farm*s production process was 
measured. Any returns for work off the farm other than for custom work and 
exchange labour, were not included in the farm*s output. (The labour for 
this type of income was not included in the farm 1 s labour input.) 

The effect of rising or falling prices was eliminated b 3 ^ using the 
prices which existed at the beginning of the year. This is important particu¬ 
larly in the case of livestock, for which prices fluctuated relatively more, 
seasonally, than did grain prices.

(b) Land input * - The only land inputs associated with output are 
the productive acres. The climate and the weather were the same for all 
farms. The moisture input is assumed the same for all farms because all 
the farmers were experienced in irrigation and each operator has strong in¬ 
ducement to use the optimum amount of water* 

The productive acres on these farms were the irrigated cropped 
acres and the dryland pasture. 

Assuming moisture, sunshine, and other weather conditions constant 
the sample was taken from areas with similar soils, in an attempt to elimi¬ 
nate the variability in output due to soil variations. All the farms were 
located on heavy soils so that justification exists for considering the 
soil textures the same for all farms, for all practical purposes. 

Here the similarity ended. When the study began, the intention 
was to assume soil, climate, etc. constant for the farms studied, and to ex¬ 
press land inputs in irrigable acres. However, it became apparent, as enum¬ 
eration progressed, that other serious causes of variation in physical pro¬ 
ductivity existed. These causes seem to be associated together and in turn 
associated with the rate at which the operator could irrigate his land with 
an optimum coverage. 

The rate of irrigation (in acres per ten-hour day) is influenced 
not only by the topsoil texture but also by the subsoil, the slope of the 
land, the degree of levelness,^ and the spill facilities available to the 
fanner. 

^Levelling land refers to removing the larger high spots and filling in the 
low areasj floating refers to the annual process of smoothing the ruts, etc. 
out of the land so that the water will spread over it without “washing 1 ' out 
gullies.

If the subsoil were impervious the fanner could use less water, 
but he must exercise greater bare to avoid too much water (and thus bring 
the alkali salts to the surface) than on land having a porous or well- 
drained subsoil. 

Land that is very flat must be carefully irrigated to avoid too 
much water, although it can be irrigated rapidly. With some slope and good 
spill facilities the water does not need such close attention. 

However, the main factor affecting the speed of irrigation seems 
to be the degree of levelling existing at the time. When the land is "rough" 
the irrigator must do a great deal more work to get the water to the higher 
spots. Also, the low spots usually get too much water. When the land is 
level the water can be turned in at the head of the field and it spreads 
smoothly over the plot. Little or no shovelling is required. While it is 
spreading itself the operator is free to work at something else. He can 
11 set” the water and let it run for a few hours at a time. On rough land the 
water requires constant attention and a great deal more labour to ensure an 
even coverage. The saving in labour due to level land is considerable. Dur¬ 
ing the grooving and harvesting season when the farmer is very busy those 
farmers with rough land are continually "behind" with their work, compared to 
those who have more level land. In other words it requires a great deal more 
work for a bushel of grain on the rough land. 

Until the past two or three years most farmers were doing their 
levelling (not floating) themselves and at a slow rate. Some land required 
little levelling to begin with, while other land required a great deal. These 
conditions make it very difficult to measure the amount of capital expenditure 
for levelling which has gone into the land. It was thought that by using in 

4 

the sample only those farms on which the land had been under irrigated culture

for a minimum of seven years the condition of the land for irrigating would, 
be the same for each farm, for all practical purposes. However, levelling 
on an appreciable scale has taken place only in recent years, beginning 
approximately in 1948. Prior to that time the farmers evidently had been 
unable to accumulate enough capital to permit any extensive levelling of 
their land. There has not been enough time elapse yet to permit enough 
levelling throughout the district to create uniformity among most of the 
farms. However, it seems possible to approach the problem from the other 
direction, that is, the amount of levelling yet needed to put the land on 
each farm in a comparable condition. The rate of irrigation should be closely 
associated with the condition of the land as measured by this chief factor, 
the amount of levelling yet required to get the land into optimum condition 
for irrigating.^ 

The condition of the land has an influence on its market value. If 
the market were perfect and expressed the productivity of each parcel of land 
and if the levelling needed were the only factor causing a difference in land 
values, then the land could all be brought to a common denominator of pro- 
ductivity, and land input could be expressed in productive acres. 

^Admittedly, subsoil, slope, and spill facilities are influences in the ease 
with which a parcel of land can be irrigated but these and levelness are all 
allowed for in the rate of irrigation per day. 

The gross correlation coefficient between ’’the rate of irrigation per ten-hour 
man day” and ’’the levelling yet required in dollars per acre” was -0.3* The 
relationship is apparently low because of the factors unaccounted for in the 
data. Each farmer was asked how much levelling was required on his farm to put 
his land into ”good shape” where he would spend no further money on levelling. 
This point was arrived at subjectively and therefore variation occurs due to 
the differences in farmers 1 estimates of what ’’good shape” is. Refinements 
in measuring the rate of irrigation per ten-hour man day could also be achieved, 
for these and other reasons, corroborated by field observations, the relation¬ 
ship between levelling yet needed and rate of irrigation per day is likely 
much higher. 

Slope, subsoil, and spill facilities seem to be of minor importance to rate of 
irrigation in that they influence the amount of water turned onto the land, 
which can be regulated at the head of the field. But levelness influences the 
amount of time the irrigator must stay right with the water to watch its dis¬ 
tribution.

To clarify this by illustrations suppose optimum land to be worth 
$50 per acre. Under the assumptions stated above land worth $40 per acre 

t 

should require $10 per acre in levelling; land worth $30 per acre should re¬ 
quire $20 per acre in levelling; etc. An acre of $40 land will produce four- 
fifths of what an acre of $50 land produces, or it takes 1.25 acres of $40 
land to produce the same amount as one acre of $50 land. An the land could 
thus be expressed in terms of land of any designated productivity or value. 

This is a simplified illustration of the approach taken in this 
study to attempt to put the land of each farm on a comparable basis so as to 
be able to express land input in irrigated crop acres of a certain level of 
productivity. 

The assumptions involved require some discussion. The per acre 
value of each farm* s irrigated land was estimated by the operator. Because 
of the low rate of land sales in the district this estimate is subject to 
grave errors. Another cause of error is due to the great variation in farmers 1 
estimates of the value of their buildings. A n d when they estimate land values 
(apart from buildings) they usually estimate first the value of the unit, then 
subtract from it their estimate of the value of the buildings. However, it 
will be seen later than an attempt is made in this study to somewhat reduce 
the errors in these land-value estimates. 

The assumption that differences in land values among farms are due 
chiefly to differences in the rate of irrigation on each parcel of land is 
based upon the association, apparent to enumerators in the field, between 
good, easily irrigated land and the prosperous condition of the farm, as well 
as the better, more uniform crops. These farms were generally valued higher 
than farms having rougher land. 








88 


The gross correlation coefficient between rate of irrigation and 
value per acre of irrigated land was only 0.2 and. was not significant. In 
view of the errors likely existing in estimating land values this is about 
what we would expect. 

In order to reduce some of the errors in land value estimates the 
regression of "value per irrigated acre* 1 on "rate of irrigation” was fitted 
to the scatter diagram. From the enumerators * personal knowledge of the 
farms and from the farmer* s estimate of levelling needed, each farm was re¬ 
valued, if necessary, to come more in line with the average values on the 
regression line. Some farmers refused to estimate their land value so the 
regression line value was used. Although this procedure is subject to con¬ 
siderable error it is felt that the resulting values are better, i.e., more 
expressive of the land 1 s value productivity than are the farmers 8 estimates. 

The modal value (per acre) was then calculated and used as a 
"standard value” of one productive irrigated acre. This modal value 7/as 
149.00 per acre. The land input of each farm was then calculated in pro¬ 
ductive irrigated acres of $49 land, e.g., 100 acres of $35 land equals 

100 x ~ * 71.4 acres of $49 land; or ICO acres of $60 land equals 

49 

100 X — = 122.4 acres of $49 land, etc. This land input was called "ad- 
49 

justed irrigated acres". 

Summerfallow created a problem. The summerfallow associated with 
the current year*s output was that of the previous year. In most cases a 
good basis for estimating last ye ar*s summerf allow was available. Where 
the difference between this year 8 s and last year 8 s summerf allow exceeded 
five acres, last year 8 s was the acreage included in the land, input. 

Taxes were not included because their amount compared to the 
amounts of other inputs and output was not significant. Water rates 
were not included in the land input because they were the same for all

farms per irrigated acre and therefore created no differential effect between 
farms on output. 

The practice of using commercial fertiliser was not prevalent among 
the farms in the sample. Previous studies have included fertilizer as a 
cash input. It seems reasonable to assume that fertiliser input is associated 
more with land input than with the miscellaneous unrelated factors that have 
been grouped previously into "cash expenses”. 

For those farms to which it applied, fertilizer input ?ras converted 
into adjusted irrigated acres to give some expression of how many more acres 
of the same quality of land (on any particular farm) would be needed to raise 
a yield equal to the increase in yield due to the fertiliser. 

Dryland pasture on each farm was converted to adjusted irrigated 
% acres by use of the relationship between the carrying capacity of dry land 
and the carrying capacity of irrigated pasture on each farm. 

Some farmers purchased feed. These purchases were also converted 
to adjusted irrigated acres on the basis of the yield of .that feed grain 
which the farmer experienced on his farm that year. 

This method of measuring land input avoids the problem of over- 
evaluation or under-cvaluation of land, which often arises when land prices 
do not move as rapidly as other prices. If the input were measured in value 
terms and the land were undervalued the value of the marginal product of land 
would be lower (by the calculations) than it is in reality. The method de¬ 
scribed above compares the land of all farms according to its relative pro¬ 
ductivity, whether it is all undervalued or overvalued. 

Another problem arising when using the value measurement of land 
input, which is avoided by the method used in this study, is that an aggregate 
value of the land of a farm doesn*t indicate, e.g., whether there is 100 acres

of $50 per acre land, or 200 acres of $25 per acre land. The measurement 
of "adjusted irrigated acres" does differentiate as to quality of land be¬ 
tween farms. 

( c ) Labour input The previous studies, discussed in Chapter III, 
expressed labour input in man-months. Such a measurement does not allow for 
differences in actual productive labour occurring among farms. Some farmers 
may have been sick part of the time, or on holidays. Some may have done a 
considerable amount of work during the slack season while others may have 
done very little. 

No allowances were made, in these studies, for differences occurring 
in the quality of labour. Some farms may have had inexperienced, inefficient 
workers, while others did not. 

In the present study an attempt is made to measure labour inputs 
that are actually associated with output. To do this, records were taken of 
the farmers 1 estimates of the time spent on various operations during the year. 
This break-down included time spent, winter and summer, on care of livestock. 
The productive labour input is expressed in ten-hour man days which is accurate 
enough to take care of errors occurring in the farmers* estimates. 

The greatest cause of variation in the amount of productive labour 
between farms was the labour attached to livestock. Some farms had very 

i 

little livestock and therefore had less productive labour than farms with 
more livestock. Differences in labour on irrigation was another important 
factor contributing to variation in productive labour among farms. 

The operations on the land during the growing season were more or 
less uniform and were used chiefly as a guide in calculating the labour input 
for each farm. They could not be used directly because they did not account 
for a considerable amount of labour done by the operator over and above the 
time actually spent on the various operations.

Some errors may arise due to the fact that time spent on machinery 
and building repairs, fencing, etc., was not measured. Major repairs on 
machinery are usually done by repair shops in town, and the labour is included 
in the repair bills. The labour on incidental repairs done in the field is 
included in the labour of the various operations. Labour on building repairs 
and new buildings is accounted for in the building input, discussed below. 
Labour on fencing and other incidentals is not accounted for, but was con¬ 
sidered likely to cause very little difference in productive labour input 
among farms. Therefore these sources were considered to create a negligible 
amount of error in measurement of productive labour. 

The errors due to variations in the quality of labour were possibly 
reduced somewhat by the method ccommonly used in many farm management studies. 
The operator was asked to estimate how many days he would have had to hire a 
man if the unpaid labour on his farm had not been available. As most operators 
have a good idea of mfaat the average paid labourer can accomplish, the estimate 
of the unpaid labour in terms of paid labour does put unpaid labour on a more 
uniform basis although most farmers tend to overestimate the efficiency of 
their unpaid labour. No allowances for differences in quality of operators 1 
labour were attempted. 

The share of labour in the custom work done for and by farmers was 
subtracted or added wherever custom, ?/ork was done. 

No attempt was made to account for the leisure time of each farmer 
as this was not considered productive labour. However, some of what ordinarily 
might be called leisure time is likely spent in making decisions, planning, 
and other management functions, in which case this type of effort is an input 
which probably affects output.

(a) Machines input .- It is impossible, without a great deal of 
detailed work by technologists, to measure the actual physical input of a 
machine associated with the output of the production period studied. It is 
therefore necessary, in a study of this kind, to use a dollar measurement, 
while attempting to approximate a physical input. The actual physical input 
of a machine is the wear and tear on it during the production period. In 
dollar terms this may be expressed by the cost of annual depreciation and 
repairs• 

Any attempt to measure the depreciation and actual repairs associ¬ 
ated with the output for a particular production period raises many problems. 
One method of calculating depreciation allows for obsolescence so that the 
annual depreciation for the first few years is large, decreasing rapidly to 
a relatively smaller amount for the majority of years of the life of the 
machine. However, obsolescence does not affect output differently in different 
years. To illustrate, a five-year old machine has about the same amount of 
physical input as a ten-year old, or a one-year old machine. Therefore it 
seems reasonable to use the n straight line method 13 for calculating the annual 
depreciation associated with output. 

I 

Repairs to a machine in any one year are ms.de up partly of regular 
annual wear and tear and partly of repairs which last for a number of years. 

It seems reasonable therefore to attempt to determine an annual figure which 
will account for only those repairs which recur annually. A number of studies 
have been done which express this annual repair cost as a percentage of the 
replacement cost. 

Repairs and depreciation require another adjustment. Two farms 
may have the same machinery yet because of differences in the amount of 
use ma.de of this machinery there will be different amounts of wear and tear

in a comparable time period, A straight line depreciation and a straight 
percentage figure for repairs does not express this difference in input. 
Therefore an adjustment was applied to depreciation and repairs to allow 
for the actual amount of use made of the machinery and equipment. 

Interest on machinery and equipment capital is another annual cost 
which must be considered as an input, A rate of five per cent was used as 
it corresponds closely to the rate on loans made by the Canadian Farm Loon 
Board. 

Depreciation, repairs, and interest were calculated on the basis 
of current replacement cost rather than average present value. The age com¬ 
ponent in the average present value has no effect on the variation in output, 
i.e., an older machine puts out about as much horsepower per unit of time as 
a new machine of the same size. The size component is the part that affects 
varis,tion in output. The age component of value is eliminated and only the 
size component is expressed by current replacement cost. 

Costs of fuel and lubricants for the production period were included 
in the machinery input because of the high relationship apparent between fuel 
and lubricants on one hand and repairs, depreciation, and replacement cost 
on the other. The gross correlation coefficient between n fuel and lubricants” 
and “repairs and depreciation” was 0.6, and the coefficient between “fuel and 
lubricants” and “replacement cost” was 0.6. 

Other small items were added to machinery input because of "a priori" 
relationships existing. The farm share of costs of licences and insurance, 
the rent paid out for machinery, and the cost of twine used, were all included. 
Costs of blacksmith work and small hardware were included also, because they 
were obviously a component of annual repairs* To summarize, the machinery 
input is a measure of the annual cost of the machinery and equipment. The 
components of this cost are:

( e ) Buil din g input *- To obtain a measurement of tne annual building 
input which is as near to the actual physical input as possible involves much 
the same problems as were encountered in the measurement of machinery input* 

It is necessary to use a value measurement of the annual wear and tear on the 
buildings, which wear and tear is expressed by annual depreciation and repairs 
to the buildings. To this the interest on the capital in buildings should be 
added to give a total annual building cost. 

As with machinery, depreciation was calculated by the straight line 
method and repairs were calculated in a similar manner. The cost of total 
repairs to a buiMing (past repairs plus estimated future repairs) was divided 
by the life-time expectancy of the building to find the annual repair charge. 

iTlie straight-line depreciation was based on the life of the machine and its 
-current replacement cost. Tractors, trucks, combines, and other items of 
"special M equipment were treated separately, while plows, discs, and other 
items of 11 general” equipment were taken all together. The average lifetime 
of the machine was estimated from the results of two unpublished studies, viz., 
Farm Powe r and Machinery Costs in Albert a 1950 » by H.K. Scott, Economics Divi¬ 
sion, Marketing Service, Canada Department of Agriculture in co-operation with 
the University of Alberta, and Some Econ omic -Aspects of the Proposed Lower 
Marias Irrigation Project , prepared by the Department of Agricultural Economics 
and Rural Sociology, Agricultural Experimental Station, Montana State College, 
in co-operation with the Bureau of Reclamation, United States Department of 
the Interior, in June, 1946. 

The following depreciation rates were used: tractors 8 per cent, trucks and 
cars 6.5 per cent, combines and swathers 9 per cent, threshing separators 5 
per cent, general equipment 6 per cent. 

The straight line depreciation thus calculated was adjusted for the amount of 
use during the year of each machine, based upon the average use by all farms 
of each machine. 

^The following rates were used to calculate annual repairs on the basis of current 
replacement cost of all but "general equipment”: tractors 3.2 per cent, trucks 
and cars 5 per cent, swathers and combines 3*1 per cent, threshing separators 
3.0 per cent, general equipment 6 per cent (of present value of old equipment 
assumed half depreciated and 3 per cent of present value of new equipment)• 

These repair costs were adjusted for the amount of usage of the machine in the 
same way in which depreciation w &s adjusted.

The usual survey method takes the farmer* s estimate of the value of 
his buildings. This is a great source of error, particularly when the house 
is included with the other farm buildings. To establish a basis for compari¬ 
son the replacement cost was used for the calculation of depreciation and in¬ 
terest.^ 

The replacement cost was calculated according to the accommodation 
the buildings offered, rather than the actual cost of material required to 
duplicate the buildings in every respect. The ’’extras” on buildings were 
not considered unless, on an ”a priori” basis, they affected output. Regard¬ 
less of the ’’extras” on a building, certain fundamental requirements are all 
that affect output. Therefore the replacement cost wa.s calculated on the basis 
of these fundamental requirements for each type of building, having regard to 
the characteristics of the actual structures on each farm and the uses to 
which they were put.^ For example, in the case of a dairy barn, hen house, 
or hog brooder house, double boarding was considered as contributing more to 
output than single boarding. In the case of beef feeding double boarding 
contributes no more to output than does single boarding. 

Certain improvements, such as straw and mud buildings, corrals, 
fences, stock ponds, ana root cellars were included in the building input. 

The annual cost of repairs on these improvements was used, allowing no depreci¬ 
ation, as they are being rebuilt continually by the repairs. 

The farm house was excluded from the building input for two reasons. 

. ... r / 

The estimate of the value of the farm house accounts for a large proportion 
of the error in farmers* estimates of their building values. The other reason 

^Interest was calculated on replacement cost because the age component of the 
present value of a building does not affect output much, unless the building 
is so old as to be totally unusable. 

-Labour was included as part (one-third) of the replacement cost.

is that the house seems to be an expenditure of residual income rather than 
an input expense. Farmers use their net returns in different ways. Some 
take holidays, or purchase luxurious cars, sacrificing a comfortable home to 
do so. Others would rather have a comfortable home with some of the utilities 
in it -enjoyed by urban dwellers. The house may have some effect on the input 
of unpaid and operator's labour and management, and therefore may affect out¬ 
put somewhat. But the variation in size and value of farm houses would seem 
to have little influence on the variation In output. 

The straight line depreciation calculation was based upon an esti¬ 
mate of the life expectancy of the building, which in turn was based upon 
the type of structureThe farmers were asked to estimate the lifetime of 
each building but in most cases their answers were uncertain and stereotyped, 
and so they were used merely as a guide. 

(f) Livestock input .- It would be extremely difficult to arrive at 
a physical measure of the actual annual input of the livestock. Depreciation 
on breeding stock perhaps would approximate the input from breeding stock, 
but this is difficult to measure quantitatively. Algo, this would not allow 
for stock purchased for feeding. 

One measurement of livestock input used in past studies has been 

"animal units", where all livestock is measured or adjusted on a basis of 

what feed is consumed by a type of animal (e.g. a mature dairy cow) selected 

for a criterion by which all other animals are measured. This measurement 

of input is rough and does not make allowances for differences in quality. 

__ / 

’Hjsual estimates of life expectancy of farm buildings for studies in the 
Prairie Provinces are: 

Buildings on cement foundation 40 years 

Buildings on brick or stone blocks 30 years 
Buildings on wooden foundation 20 years.

Usually farm management studies take the average inventory in animal 
units as a measure of livestock input. Average inventory does not include 
animals purchased and sold between inventories. 

For these reasons the measure of livestock input used by this study 
is the value-of the livestock on hand at the beginning of the year plus the 
value of livestock purchased, both of these values being taken for the portion 
of the year over which the operator retained ownership. For instance, if a 
farmer began the year with $2,000 worth of cows and sold them six months later 
he would have the equivalent of $1,000 for one year tied up in capital. Simi¬ 
larly, if he purchased $2,000 worth of feeder steers three months before the 
end of the survey year he would have the equivalent of $500 for one year tied 
up in capital. 

The capital value on this basis correlates highly with n animal units”. 
It also has the advantage of including quality in the measurement. All live¬ 
stock was valued at the beginning-of-the-year prices in order to eliminate 
the effect of rising or falling prices. 

3. Discussion of the Categorization of Variables 

Although output and the machinery, building, and livestock inputs 
were measured in value terms, in a certain sense they have a quantitative 
relationship similar to that existing among the physical measurements of 
these inputs. Variations due to relative price movements during the year 
have been removed by using single prices for each input and output item for 
the year. Variations among farms which would arise, if one firm were studied 
over a period of years, because of different natural, political, and economic 
conditions in different years, have been eliminated by the cross-sectional 
survey, which takes all farms in a single year, thus subjecting each farm to 
more or less the same environment.

With these sources of variation eliminated the inputs and output 
for each farm, as measured above in value terms, could be related in a 
quantitative fashion similar to that achieved by physical measurements, by 
a system of indexing these values for each farm. This study will not pursue 
this idea further 5 it is introduced only to suggest that it may be possible 
to achieve from the value measurements used in the study, measurements of 
inputs and output which are akin to a physical measurement. 

The independence of each input variable is difficult to measure. 
Nevertheless the following table of gross correlation coefficients indicates 
the gross relationship which existed among the variables used in the regression 
equation.

The coefficients in the "output 1M column show the relative associ¬ 
ation between the various input variables and output. This association be¬ 
tween output and the various inputs is more carefully analyzed later by 
multiple correlation methods. 

Looking at the gross relationships between pairs of the input 
(independent) variables, n land n has a closer association to "machineiy costs” 
than to any other input. This conclusion has a sound "a priori” basis in 
that the actual amount of use of the machinery, the size and the amount of 
machinery, depend directly upon the acreage to be covered more than do the 
other input variables. 

"Labour" is associated more closely to "machinery input” and "live¬ 
stock” than to "land” and "building costs". Livestock requires considerable 
labour for which machinery and buildings have not been able to substitute as 
freely as machinery has substituted for labour on land. Part of the association 
between "labour" and "land" is likely due to the association between "land” 
and "machinery”. The correlation coefficients between pairs of input vari¬ 
ables have relative magnitudes which are to be expected on a purely "a priori” 
basis. 

Under the categorization of inputs used above there appears to be 
a fairly high relationship between "land” and "machinery", "labour’ 1 and 
"machinery", and "labour" and "livestock". These associations show up because 
of the way the inputs have been selected and grouped. Another system of 
grouping may give smaller correlation coefficients but the relationships 
would remain, as "juggling” of inputs cannot change the relationships existing 
in the actual production process. With these apparent joint relationships in 
mind, which on an "a priori” basis, seems to approximate the real relationships, 
the study will proceed to analyze input-output relationships by multiple 


correlation methods

B. Selection of the Equation 

A discussion of the criteria for selection of the equation of the 
regression line which is to be fitted to the data in such studies as the 
present one, is covered in the review of the literature above 

For the reasons mentioned by Tintner, as quoted above,^ the equation 
linear in the logarithms has been fitted to the data in the present study. Be¬ 
cause the ordinary linear equation fits the data in Harries 1 study as closely 
as the equation linear in the logarithms, the former equation has been fitted 
to the data also.- A comparison of the results obtained from the two equations 
indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between them 
in the closeness with which they fit the data. Because the logarithmic equation 
is a more realistic description of the notion of diminishing returns, it was 
decided to use it in interpreting the data. The fit obtained by the linear 
equation can be found in Appendix B. 

C. Results of the Analysis 

The product-moment method4 was used to set up the equations for de¬ 
termining the net regression coefficients. The Doolittle method^ was used to 
solve for the net regression coefficients. The multiple correlation coefficient 
was calculated from the net regression coefficients.^ The F-test^ was used

for testing the significance of the multiple correlation coefficient. The 
significance of the net regression coefficients was tested by the t-test.-^ 

1. The TOiole Sample of 89 Farms 

(a) Regression and correlation results .- The multiple correlation 
coefficient for the analysis was 0.8718 and was highly significant. That 
is to say, the probability is less than 1 per cent that it could have arisen 
by chance if the true correlation coefficient in the hypothetical population 
were zero. This test assumes, first, that the distribution of the deviations 
is normal, and second, that the errors in the value of the dependent variable 
are errors of observation.^ The adjusted coefficient of multiple determina¬ 
tion was 0.760. This shows the percentage of the variance in the dependent 
variable which, on the average, was associated with the independent variables. 
For the 89 farms on the heavy soil area in the Eastern Irrigation District 
which are included in the study, 76 per cent of the variation in the logarithm 
of output was associated with the variation in the logarithms of the input 
factors defined in this study. •

The regression equation is:

X 3 is the labour input in ten-hour man days, 

X^ is the machinery input in dollars, 

X^ is the building input in dollars, 

X^ is the livestock input in dollars of investment. 

In terms of the production function described by this equation these 
net regression coefficients represent the elasticities of the various input 
factors.These elasticities remain constant while the marginal productivity 
calculated from any one of these elasticities varies.^ 

The marginal productivities were calculated for those factors which 
had significant net regression coefficients. The method of calculation is 
shown in Appendix A, using the land input factor for the 89 farms to illustrate. 
These marginal productivities were calculated by selecting values for the in¬ 
dependent variable factor throughout the range of the data and substituting 
them in an equation with all other factors held constant at their geometric 
means• 

(b) Returns to scale .- The sum of the net regression coefficients 
for all farms is 0.9284, which indicates that a condition of decreasing re- 
turns to scale exists, on the average.-'

heavy livestock group in a similar fashion. The following results were obtained. 


(a) Crop type - 25 farms .- The multiple correlation coefficient for 
this group of farms was 0.790, which is highly significant. The adjusted co¬

Both crop and livestock types appear to have decreasing returns to 
scale. The sum of the net regression coefficients for Crop Type farms was 
0.3065 and for Heavy Livestock Type farms, 0.8002.

D* Interpretation of the Results of the Analysis 

The multiple regression coefficients in each of the three groupings 
analyzed, i.e., (a) All Farms, (b) Crop Type Farms, and (c) Livestock Type 
Farms, indicate that the variation in the input factors chosen for this analysis 
account for most of the variation in the resultant output. 

There is considerable difference between the closeness of association 
existing in Crop Type farms and that existing in Heavy Livestock type farms. 

This difference can be accounted for by the fact that the input factor ”Live- 
stock” is used in the analysis for both types. With more livestock on the 
Livestock farms, the livestock factor would have a greater influence on output 
than it would in the case of the Crop Type farms. 

This close association exists only when the input factors are taken 
together. Thus the regression equation can be used to calculate output from 
a given set of input factors derived from similar data, despite the fact that 
severe,! of the net regression coefficients have no statistical significance. 

Some of the variation in output has not been accounted for by the 
input factors used - for Crop Type, 38 per cent; for All Farms, 24 per 
cent; and for Heavy Livestock Type, 13 per cent. This portion of the variation 
may be due to errors in enumeration, to natural factors which could not be held 
constant, and to that portion of the management factor which has not been 
measured• 

The effect on output of each factor, taken separately, must be con¬ 
sidered carefully. No reliance can be placed on those factors with net re¬ 
gression coefficients which were not statistically significant. The relation¬ 
ship to output which they exhibit could have occurred by chance. However, the 
relationship of the land factor to output is highly significant statistically 












•3

for all groupings. This means that we can place considerable reliance on 
the net regression coefficients of this input factor. 

From the size of the net regression coefficients for land it appears 
that this factor has a much higher association with output than any other 
factor. This bears out the results of the analysis of the gross correlation 
between the variables calculated from the All Farms group* 

When the marginal productivities of land for the three different 
groups are compared it appears that the land under the Crop Type form of organi¬ 
sation has considerably lower productivity than it has for either of the other 
two groups* The productivity of land is highest under the Heavy Livestock 
type- of organisation. 

It is very difficult to calculate the marginal cost of an acre of 
land for one year but the customary crop share rental agreement in the area, 
gives some idea of the annual opportunity cost of an acre of land. Generally 
crop share renters in the district pay one-third, of the crop to the landlord. 

The landlord must pay the taxes and the renter must pay all the other expenses. 
The predominant cash crop is wheat, which on the average yielded about 34 
bushels to the acre (on irrigated land) in the year of this study. The 
Canadian Wheat Board price of wheat to the farmers in that area averaged out, 
over the past six years, to about fl.62. This makes the gross returns on the 
crop for an acre of land for the year to be about $55*08. Cne-third of this 
is $18.36, Using this figure as the marginal cost to the farmer of one acre 
of land for the year of the study and comparing it to the marginal productivity 
of land in the different groups at the geometric means, the following results 
appear:

These results indicate that for the Crop Type farm the land input 
is too high for the amounts of the other inputs. In other words more inten¬ 
sification would seem advisable. On the other hand the remaining two groups, 
particularly the Heavy Livestock group, show marginal revenue productivities 
considerably above the estimated marginal cost. There is no real indication 
of how quickly the marginal, revenue productivity of land would fall off if 
the land input were increased. However, these results seem to indicate that 
on the average more land should be used with the same amount of other inputs 
in use at present in the Heavy Livestock and the All Farms groups. 

For the n Labour input” of the All Farms group, the geometric mean 
was 3,120 hours. The marginal productivity of labour at this level of input 
was about 54 cents per hour. %th 26 ten-hour working days in a month, this 
would amount to $140.40 per month. The labour input of the average farm was 
largely that of the operator and his family. Labour mas hired for harvesting 
and perhaps for haying, but this only amounted to two or three weeks in the 
year. For a permanent hired worker this $140 per month would just about cover 
the going wage plus room and board. In other words the marginal cost just 
about equals the marginal revenue. This would indicate that on the average, 
for All Farms the labour input was at Its most economic level, if we assume 
the labour to be hired. It is difficult to arrive at a marginal cost for 

operator 1 s labour. However, the marginal productivity measures the returns for 















t 




108 


his labour and compares favourably with the alternative opportunity at the 
time (90 cents per hour) for ordinary labour other than on farms. (Ninety 
cents per hour for a 40 hour week amounts to $145 - $150 per month.) 

The geometric mean level of "Livestock input” for the Heavy Live¬ 
stock'group was $3,673* At this level one dollar invested in livestock was 
returning about 3£ cents. Again it is difficult to calculate the marginal 
cost associated ?fith this annual marginal product. Part of the dollar invested 
in livestock is tied up in breeding stock, the lifetime of which may be a 
number of years. For this stock only the input for one year is relevant to 
the marginal productivity figure. The annual cost, if thought of in terms 
of what must be sacrificed to produce the output, is very small. A breeding 
cow, which may be expected to yield eight to ten calves, only depreciates 
about one-third of its value over the years, prices remaining the same. It 
is doubtful if brood sows depreciate at all over the average productivity 
period of three to four litters because they put on in weight what they lose 
in quality and therefore price. So normally If prices remain fairly constant, 
when a fanner Invests in livestock he gets back a large proportion of his or¬ 
iginal investment plus the gains in weight and/or in progeny. The only cost 

V 

to him is the interest on the money invested and the depreciation which does 
occur, ^o be generous, an allowance of 5 per cent for interest and 5 per cent 
for depreciation would give an annual marginal cost of 10 cents. On this basis 
it appears advisable for the farmers in the Heavy Livestock group to increase 
considerably the "Livestock input" (investment in livestock). Again this must 
be qualified by the fact that there is no adequate measure of how fast the 
marginal revenue product will fall off as the number of livestock units is 


increased.

The net regression coefficients indicate that diminishing returns 
exist for each input category, as the coefficients are less than unity within 
their fiducial limits. However, less reliance can be placed on the results 
which indicate returns to scale. When the net regression coefficients are 
added together to determine returns to scale, the fiducial limits of each 
net regression coefficient permit a sum greater than unity. This would in¬ 
dicate increasing returns to scale. These limits also permit a sum consider¬ 
ably less than unity, indicating decreasing returns to scale. Therefore one 
cannot say from these results whether increasing, constant, or decreasing 
returns to scale exist." 

These interpretations of the data cannot be taken as they are with¬ 
out a more thorough examination of the logic upon which they are based. Their 
reliability will be discussed in the next and final chapter of this thesis.

VII. CONCLUSIONS 

Most research in ary branch of knowledge has as its final objective 
an increase in our knowledge of our environment to enable us to control our 
environment or adapt ourselves to it. The idea of predicting is involved in 
this control. .All farm management studies have been conducted with the end 
in view of developing or helping to develop some basis for predicting what 
may occur in the future under certain conditions. As has been indicated in 
the introduction, the present study constitutes a consideration of a method 
which offers a basis for predicting certain developments in farm organization. 
To facilitate this consideration the method has been applied to farms in a 
selected area. A knowledge of the extent to which the predictions applicable 
to these farms are reliable, should aid in an examination of the application * 
of the method to studies of similar areas. 

In considering the meaning of the results in terms of returns to 
scale, it has been pointed out in the previous chapter that any conclusion 
based on the statistical analysis is unreliable. Tintner set up a statistical 
method for testing the existence of increasing, constant, or decreasing returns 
to scale in empirical data of the type used in the present study. The test 
is satisfactory if management ”per se” were considered unimportant, as in 
Harries® study, or if it were measurable. Where management is not measurable 
and where it is important in the timing of activities, ary condition of returns 
to scale may in fact exist. Harries argued that timing was not an important 
factor in determining size of output among the farms which he studied, where 
the timing of activities is dictated by the natural environment. However, 
among irrigation farms timing may be more important, particularly in applying 
the water to the land. Leaving the water on a crop twenty-four hours too long.

or not applying the water within a day or two at the time the grain is filling 
may reduce the yield considerably. 

The analysis has provided three equations which may be used under 
certain conditions with some confidence.^ These conditions are first, that 
to make a reliable prediction of output from inputs of a given farm in the 
area, the inputs must be measured in the same way they are measured in this 
study, and second, that the size of the inputs must be within the range of 
the data used herein. Lastly, the farm must be subject to the same physical 
conditions as were the farms which supplied the data for the relevant re¬ 
gression equation. The same applies to the technological conditions. 

The conclusions regarding marginal productivities, and therefore 
adjustments in farm organization, must be carefully considered. For instance, 
what effect on output have the input factors which were not significant 
statistically? It does not appear sound to conclude that within the range 
of the data it makes little difference what is the size of the "Machinery" 
input, or the "Labour” input. Field observations, borne out by the gross 
correlation analysis above, indicate that the joint relationship between these 
two inputs and the !, Land ,T input is fairly high. Apparently it is the degree 
of interdependence which prevents obtaining statistical results which are 
significant. 

This interdependence also helps to explain why the variation in 
"Land” input accounts for such a large proportion of the variation in "Output". 
This has some bearing on the conclusions regarding land. The "Land" input as 

^The standard errors of estimate of the logarithms of output were as follows: 
Crop Type, 0.0884$ All Farms, 0.0839$ Heavy Livestock Type, 0.0663. In terms 
of units of output this means that the output can be estimated within the 
following limits: Crop Type, ±$1,226; All Farms, ±$1,213$ Heavy Livestock 
Type, ±|1,165.

measured herein, likely would not have such a high marginal productivity, 
compared to its marginal cost, if its effect on "Output" could be isolated. 
However, the large difference between the marginal cost and the marginal 
productivity of "Land" probably more than covers the intereffect of "Machin¬ 
ery" and "Labour". 

It therefore appears safe to conclude that in this area, under pre¬ 
sent conditions, the size of the "Land" input as measured in the present study, 
will tend to increase. This will occur either by adding more irrigable acres 
as a result of gradual consolidation or as a result of land improvement in the 
form of levelling. The latter route seems more likely to be used. If land 
levelling does occur more widely in the area this will increase the efficiency 
of the use of other factors, particularly "Labour", which will increase "Out¬ 
put". This will amount to an increase in scale of operations. 

To what extent this tendency will proceed cannot be deduced from 
this analysis. There is no accurate indication of ho?? rapidly the marginal 
productivity for any of the significant factors will change as the size of the 
input factor departs from the (geometric) mean. To ascertain how far the ten¬ 
dency for expansion of "Land" input would go, a similar study would have to 
be made later, perhaps at intervals, to discover the new marginal productivities, 
at new geometric means. 

Because of the joint relationship between "Land" and "Labour", and 
of the high influence "Land" has upon "Output", it appears reasonable to con¬ 
clude that the marginal productivity of labour may actually be somewhat higher 
than the calculations indicate. This means that relative to other inputs, 
"Labour" may be increased somewhat, although this conclusion is subject to 
error. A safer conclusion would be that labour is being used fairly effici¬ 
ently by the farms in the area studied. However, if the "Land" input is 










i\T ■ 





ones 








113 


. increased as indicated above, the efficiency of "Labour” will undoubtedly in¬ 
crease. This will bring about an increase in the marginal productivity of 
"Labour" and, unless the marginal cost increases, an increase in "Labour" 
input, relative to other inputs. 

It appears safe to conclude that, within the range of the data, 
the size of the "Building" input may vary with little significant effect 
on "Output". The "Building" factor is fairly independent of the other 
factors and therefore the results are more reliable. 

The analysis indicates two reasons why it seems safe to conclude 
that the "Livestock" input will tend to increase under present conditions 
in the area. One of these reasons is because of the effect of livestock on 
the marginal productivity of "Land", comparing Crop Type to Heavy Livestock 
Type, and the other is because of the fairly large difference between the 
marginal cost and the marginal productivity of the "Livestock" factor in 
the Heavy Livestock group. It is well to remember that, since this analysis 
is based on static theory it may be that risk and uncertainty will continue 
to induce this wide discrepancy between marginal productivity and marginal 
cost. However, because the difference is so large, the conclusion that the 
use of livestock will tend to increase appears sound. 

All of the above conclusions as to likely developments in farm or¬ 
ganization in the population studied must be qualified to conform with the 
static analysis. If technology changes, then a different interfirm pro¬ 
duction function will exist and marginal costs and marginal productivities 
will be different. If the relationship) between the prices of the various 
inputs changes for such a length of time as to permit changes in farm organi¬ 
zation generally in the area, then a new interfirm production function will

develop. If market conditions change to reduce risk and uncertainty, ^ or 
if the price of grain products change relative to the price of livestock a 
new production function will arise. If the quality of average management 
changes, a change in the interfirm production function will be induced. Under 
each of these sets of conditions 'ipnly another similar study can determine the 
new relationships. However, under conditions where prices change proportion¬ 
ately so that the same relationship is maintained, the present production 
function may be applied. 

Such changes do not come about overnight, however. It takes a 
fairly permanent change to induce the majority of farmers to reorganize. This 
consideration may permit the conclusions from the data in the present study to 
stand for a reasonable length of time, say three to five years. 

The tendency to make the adjustments indicated above may be counter¬ 
acted by such factors as risk, capital rationing, etc. If the effects of 
some of these counteracting factors are reduced by certain government policies 
then the farmers will have a greater inducement to change in the directions 
indicated. Or if agricultural policy results in retarding changes in the 
environment, particularly the economic environment, then the changes indicated 
will proceed according to the degree of stability created. 

The conclusions permitted do not apply to any individual farm except 
insofar as the interfirm and intrafirm production functions are the same. In 
this regard the Crop Type farms and the Heavy Livestock Type farms are more 
homogeneous than are the farms in the All Farms group. Caution in applying 
these conclusions should be exercised accordingly. 

The conclusions of this study cannot be applied to farm anywhere in 
the Eastern Irrigation District because of this lack of homogeneity among farms, 


^For example, if the government stabilized livestock prices.

creating an entirely different population than that from which the sample 
was drawn. If a knowledge of average marginal productivities were desired 
for the district, or for irrigation farms in southern Alberta, the population 
would have to be stratified to obtain homogeneity and a similar study made of 
each stratum or homogeneous group. Such a stratification to obtain more homo¬ 
geneity is particularly necessary in irrigation farming because of the wider 
scope for management and because the timing of operations by management is 
more critical than in most farming elsewhere on the Canadian prairies. 

Certain weaknesses have appeared in the present application of the 
method which are innate to it* Two flaws may prevent reliable conclusions 
regarding returns to scale. One is the fact that there exists a certain portion 
of the management factor which cannot be measured. The extent to which this 
portion affects outpiit determines its effect on conclusions regarding returns 
to scale. As Heady pointed out,^ this inability to measure management is not 
unique to this particular method of analysis. The other flaw which may appear 
derives from the fact that any conclusions about returns to scale are based 
on the assumption that the average farm organisation at any level of output 
is at the lowest cost combination. If for some reason common to most of the 
farms, they are biased in the same direction then the regression line will 
not represent the scale line. 

The static nature of the method is a weakness. Changes in the 
interfirm production function caused by changes in the physical technological 
and economic environment, will reduce the degree of usefulness of the conclusions 
according to the degree of change. 

This analytical method does not provide physical production functions 
useful to the farm manager in planning changes, in his organization. The

schedules of marginal productivities which are provided are valid only at 
the geometric mean of each input factor and lose accuracy as the input de¬ 
parts from the mean. Thus, if the results are significant only one reliable 
marginal productivity is available for each input factor. 

Nevertheless, it should not be concluded that the results of the 
analysis are not very useful. The information which is obtainable is valu¬ 
able as a guide to extension workers and to policy makers. This information 
can be made more reliable by additional refinements in sampling, in measur¬ 
ing the contents of the data, and in categorizing independent variables. 

Some refinements have been introduced into the present study which were 
necessary to apply the method to the hetrogeneous group of farms in the 
irrigation district of which the population was a part. 

This study has been a consideration of the application of the 
Cobb-Douglas type of production function analysis to irrigated farms in 
a selected area. From the study it is apparent that care must be exercised 
in the use of the method. Ho??ever, with a knowledge of its limitations the 
method has a useful application in obtaining reliable information for guid¬ 
ance in farm management and in agricultural policy.
