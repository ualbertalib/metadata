PART A 



INTRODUCTION 




CHAPTER I 


ALBERTA'S SCHOOL BUILDING* PROBLEM 

"But now you live under one school of architecture, 
and worship under another." John Ruskin (te, p.67) made 
this observation in the course of a lecture in the Tom 
Hall, Bradford, Xorkshire, while discussing a proposed 
new Exchange. His statement is equally applicaole to the 
school 'building situation in Alberta to-day. Most of our 
buildings were designed and built for the traditional 
type of education of a generation ago. On the other hand, 
modern philosophy, psychology, sociology, and teaching 
methodology are indicative of an altogether different 
type of education. 

As a result of our changing thought, new courses 
of study have been and will continue to be designed em¬ 
bodying many of these changes. They recognize such char¬ 
acteristics of school-age children as : (l) the innate 

need of all children, especially of elementary age, for 
activity; (2) their tendency to work and play in groups; 
(3,) their natural curiosity and eagerness to learn, explore 
and discover; and (^) their persistent employment of the 
hands in the urge to construct. No school plant of to-da.y 
can afford to overlook these interests of the school child 
if society is to receive full benefit therefrom. Hence 
the architecture of the modern school building should 
mirror the educational philosophy of the time, and in that 


-2- 





-3- 


mirror will be seen larger classrooms for smaller classes, 
movable furniture, reaming rooms, workrooms and shops, 
a theatre stage, playrooms, lunch-rooms, and, as a con¬ 
sequence, happy, eager, and interested hoys and girls. 

The early Alberta school of the rural areas reflected 
the philosophy of the pioneer as faithfully as did the 
curriculum of the day. It consisted of a simple one room 
log structure whose perimeter was broken with small windows 
at regular intervals. Its ideals were simplicity, economy, 
and a narrow program of study embracing reading, writing, 
and arithmetic. Later the program widened to include a 
little history, geography, and health, but the box-like 
structure with its regimented rows of desks securely fast¬ 
ened to the floor and its narrow aisles through which 
pupils marched to and from classes with military precision 
remained unchanged. 

Many of these structures are present in our education¬ 
al system to-day. Such buildings must be replaced or modified 
since they are inadequate for the most successful application 
of' a modern program of education—an education of the child 
in and for citizenship, and a wider education of the whole 
community for social living. 

Our problem then at the present time is the relation¬ 
ship of the Alberta school plant to modern education. Ob¬ 
viously, a work of this nature cannot deal adequately with 
all types of buildings, both urban and rural, needed in 
this province. Since most Alberta children attend smaller 





































schools, as indicate-, by the figures in the next paragraph, 
it is with these smaller schools that this work will in 
bhe main be concerned. 

In June, 19^+0, there were in Alberta 6,ISO class¬ 
rooms (2, Annual Report, pp.83-101). Of these, 3 j 004 or 
4s.b0 per cent were in one room schools, while 4,595 or 
75.36 per cent were in school systems of eight classrooms 
or less. The enrolment in these smaller schools constituted 
65*7$ per cent of the province's total. This group includes 
thirty-five town schools as well as village, consolidated 
rural high, and rural public schools. These figures ex¬ 
clude schools of eight rooms and smaller in the cities. 

In the city of Edmonton the Public School Board operates 
fourteen smaller schools comprising fifty-sight classrooms, 
and probably enrolling more than two thousand pupils. 

•Parts of the Edmonton Roman Catholic Separate School system 
and the smaller schools in Calgary, Lethbridge and Medicine 
Hat will also boost the above totals. Therefore it is 
evident that more than three-quarters of Alberta, teachers 
are employed in the smaller schools of eight rooms or less, 
and over 65 per cent of all pupils enrolled attend these 
smaller schools. 

It is to this group of schools that this work will 
apply. A discussion of larger school buildings would not 
be as pertinent in Alberta, since the proportion of pupils 
and classrooms in such buildings is relatively small. It 
must oe oorne in mind that one room schools almost invar- 
































- 5 - 


iably house Grades I to VIII or IX; two room schools 
Grades I to X or XI, and three to eight room schools 
Grades I to XII. Hence, classrooms in such buildings must 
usually accommodate more than one grade. This type of 
classroom organization calls for a different type of 
design from that of the one-grade classroom in the city 
school.

SCHOOL BUILDING- QUESTIONNAIRE TO TEACHERS 

In order to obtain concrete evidence regarding 
Alberta school buildings and their equipment, questionnaires 
were distributed to two hundred schools. In the case of 
the larger schools, they were mailed directly to the prin¬ 
cipal concerned. A number of divisional superintendents 
distributed them to the one and two room schools. In 
order to secure the validity of the findings, as even a 
dispersal as possible was maintained. Figure 1 shows the 
eventual distribution over the province, each dot represent¬ 
ing one classroom about which information was obtained. 

The response to the questionnaires was fair, since 
one hundred of the two hundred school principals made re¬ 
turns, as indicated in Table I.

The data indicate that 6l per cent of the schools 
are of frame construction and 30 V er cent of brick. In 
Schools of four rooms and larger there could well be a 
greater proportion of the more fireproof buildings. Then 
too', greater permanence is often desired in the larger 
schools. 

Fifty-two of the eighty-three schools whose principals 
answered the question regarding future additions are so 
constructed that additional classrooms cotild be built 
xfithout using basement area. Every school should be so 
designed, since ours is a new country where expansion is 
to be expected not only in population but also in the 
number of teachers per hundred pupils.

The data gathered regarding school grounds speahs 
for itself. Far too many of the schools have inadequate 
play, athletic and ornamental areas.

For this representative group of schools the class¬ 
room size varies greatly. The smallest of the 33& class¬ 
rooms is 16 feet by 20 feet in size, and houses Grades I 
to VI, part of a two room school of 39 pupils. Consider¬ 
ing the fact that in rural schools of this size the junior 
room usually has enrolled in it about two-thirds of the 
pupils, this room would afford only thirteen square feet 
per pupil. The senior room housing Grades X to XII of 
the 71 pupils at Czar is 10 feet by 3^* feet. This oddly- 
shaped classroom is also extremely crowded. However, the 
most crowded of all the classrooms is fou#d in the one room 
school at Gunn. Here an average-size classroom, 22 feet 
oy 30 feet, houses 56 pupils, Grades I to VIII. It is 
difficult to imagine the teacher in this room attempting 
the present curriculum in the manner suggested. 

The one room high scho:1 eh Hudson Heights, Acadia 
Division, with nine pupils in: .a spacious room thirty feet 
square affords a striking contrast to the crowded rooms 
depicted above. In this room one hundred square feet of 
space are available per student as contrasted with approx¬ 
imately twelve square feet per pupil in the most crowded 
room. This would seem to indicate that a vs.riety of build¬ 
ing provisions places a notable limitation on Alberta*s 
equality of educational opportunity.

The presence of these other accommodations and their 
frequency is indicated in Table VI on the following page. 

In smaller schools it is desirable that all rooms, 
other than the classroom, be designed for multiple use. 

This practice has been followed in a number of c as e s 1n 
these schools. For instance, science laboratories have 
been combined with the library, the office, the lunch¬ 
room and the kitchen. 

The proportion of schools having accommodations 
for g,eneraJ. shop and domestic science is very small, con¬ 
sidering their importance in the curriculum. In one three 
room school the shop is located in an old rented building, 
while in one of the five room schools both shop and domestic 
science sire taught downtown. 

From the information submitted it seems apparent 
that 36 per cent of the schools have no cloakrooms, built- 
in wardrobes or lockers. A few of the teachers, however, 
mention hooks in hallways. The rest probably make Shift 
with hooks in the basement playrooms or in the classrooms.

In any case, far too many of these schools have in¬ 
sufficient accommodation for cloaks. 

The situation regarding auditorium-gymnasiums is 
particularly bad. The gymnasium in the three room school 
is an extra classroom converted to the purpose, while the 
one serving the seven room school at Bow Island is situated 
one-quarter of a mile from the school. As a result, the 
usefulness of the hall is virtually nullified because of 
its location. Thus only three out of the hundred schools 
have auditorium-gymnasiums which could possible be of maxi- 
imum multiple use . 

Only 29 per cent of the schools have any equipment 
for the teaching of typewriting. Six out of the twenty- 
nine schools have separate rooms for this purpose, although 
one principal complained that it was not only too small 
but also unhealed. One two room school uses the bach porch 
instead of the classroom for typing in suitable weather. 

One school uses the hall-way, one the office, one a cloak¬ 
room, one the teachers 1 room, one the students’ union room, 
and two the science laboratory. Although in these canes 
necessity has proven the mother of invention, it would be 
much better if necessity would produce more accommodation 
in the form of actual additional flogr area.

Table VII indicates that all but 13 per cent of the 
schools have reasonably good flooring. Fir, spruce and 
pine are unsatisfactory because they splinter under the 
moving of modern movable school furnishings, while hardwood, 
on the other hand, is noisy when desks and tables are moved 
about. None of the reporting schools had classroom floors 
of battleship linoleum, asphalt tile, or rubber tile, any 
one of which tend to reduce floor sounds.

These figures indicate that a good proportion of 
these classrooms have a movable work-table necessary,for 
activity and group work, but that there are too many school¬ 
rooms with no tables.

Table IX indicates that work-table areas vary wide¬ 


ly. A work-table area of 20 square feet is inadequate in 
the classroom of average enrolment because such a small 
area will of necessity cut down the number of possible 
activities. 

Question 5 

Pupils’ desks: Movable?.Fastened to floor?. 

Fastened to slats?. 

Information was available regarding classroom sea-t¬ 
ing from 312 of the 33 $ rooms returning the questionnaire. 
This information is set forth in Table X on the following 
page. 

Desks fastened to slats, although better than those 
screwed to the floor, are usually fastened in groups, and 














































hence are too heavy to move easily. Consequently, a class¬ 
room having desks fastened to slats is often nearly as 
rigid as one in which the desks are fixed. The trend 
toward movaole seating is noteworthy, but the data do 
show too many classrooms attempting an integrated curriculum 
in surroundings entirely too rigid.

Lighting: Fully satisfactory.? Unsatisfactory?.. 

Why? . . .Have you window blinds?.Attached at top? ....

The data available on this question are presented 

in Tables XI and XII on the pages following. 

It seems odd that the lighting was found to be 

unsatisfactory in only 121 or 40 per cent of the 3^5 rooms 

reporting. Seven of the thirty-four rooms without olinds 

reported curtains, which are unsatisfactory for schoolrooms, 

not only for light control but also for hygienic reasons. 





















- 20 - 


Some of these rooms without blinds may face north, in which 
case blinds are not desirable. In many instances better 
light control can be obtained from blinds attached at the 
middle of the window. Only 20 per cent of the blinds are 
so placed.

The glass area, data displayed in Table XII on tne 
next page show the median area per classroom to be 12J.5 
square feet. To have actual glass area equal to 20 per 
cent of floor area, as shown by American Recommended Practice 
of School Lighting (l, p.20) is good procedure. Since the 
median floor area, as shown in Table IV is 689 square feet, 
the median glass area should be 13S square feet. It is 
probably safe to conclude that school lighting in Alberta 
schools is a matter deserving of immediate 
sideration.

people, five one room school teachers, two principals of 
two room schools, one of a three room school, and one of 
an eight room school found the blackboards unsatisfactory 
in their twenty rooms. Hence the reasons for unsatisfact¬ 
ory boards are those of a small group. Only two schools - 
one of four rooms and one of seven rooms - are using tilted 
blackboards to help overcome glare. This deficiency could 
easily be corrected in the other rooms. It is interesting 
that only two principals, one of two rooms, and one of 
four rooms, reported that their rooms had too much black¬ 
board. Probably their surplus blackboard is being used 
as a tackboard, as it should be.

that this amount is enough for the average modern classroom, 
the rest of the available wall area, side and rear, being 
required for tackboard. Consequently it can be said that 
approxiiately half of these classrooms have too great an 
area devoted to blackboards. On the other hand it is appar¬ 
ent from Table XV (following) that very few schools have 
enough tackboard area.

four or more rooms, showing either that the schools in the 
larger villages and towns have enough tackboard area, or 
that the principals believe they have. The median tack¬ 
board area of 22 square feet is very low. Actually, each 
classroom should have as a minimum a piece of tackboard 
four feet wide extending across the whole of the rear 
wall - in all an area of ninety-tiro square feet. Consequent¬ 
ly, it can be seen from Table XV that only six rooms have 
sufficient tackboard. These six rooms are located in two 
one room and two two room schools whose interior wall finish 
is fibre-boardWhich makes excellent tackboard. One is 
justified in concluding, then, that an extremely small 
number of classrooms have sufficient tackboard.

From the data displayed in Table XVI on the foll¬

are there sufficient books in the classroom library. The 
median number of books per classroom (102) would possibly 
be enough for a one-grade classroom, if the books were the 
right ones. It is encouraging to see that the range above 
the median is much greater than below it.

Bookshelves are necessary for both books and magaz¬

pupils to use them. The author has found from personal 
experience that the median length of 22 feet per classroom 
is insufficient.

Table XVIII indicates that many schools are obviously

193 ^-^! the Board of Walker School, Bruderheim, where the 
author was principal, spent $25 per year for books and 
magazines for each of the four rooms. Nevertheless, the 
teachers often felt that more library books were required.

The circulating library is probably the best sub¬ 
stitute for adequate library facilities in the school it¬ 
self. Hence it is encouraging to note that 25 per cent of 
the hundred smaller schools herein considered are mailing 
us of this service. Some of these boxes of books are 
owned by the divisions and some by the Department of Ex¬ 
tension, University of Alberta. The chief difficulty with 
travelling libraries seems to be that they do not circulate 
quickly enough owing to transportation difficulties in rural 
areas. Exchange of the circulating library five times a year 
rather than three times a year would be more desirable.

It Is apparent from Tables XX and XXI (following) 


that although thirty-six different periodicals are sub¬ 
scribed to in sixty-two of these schools, too many schools 
have either none at all or too few. The sixty-two schools 
receive only 142 periodicals - an average of 2.3 per school 
or .42 for each of 33^ classrooms. Without a doubt this 
is a deplorable situation.

Question 10 

Are there kitchen facilities sufficient to provide at least 

a hot course for the noon lunch? .... 

Is this sufficient? 

Kitchen facilities are necessary in most schools 
of eight rooms and less because pupils attending such schools 
often must carry a lunch, A hot course included with this . 
lunch is a necessity for these pupils. Consequently, a 
situation where only 16 per cent of the schools have kitchen 
facilities is serious, especially at a time when so much 
attention is being paid to the nutrition of the Canadian 
people.

The fact that 3& of these schools as indicated in 
TableXXIII have radios is a good sign. Their number will 
probably increase along with the increase in school radio 
programs. Pianos and phonographs are also fairly frequent 
but other audio-visual aids are less plentiful. 


































The projection lantern and the movie projector are 
both valuable aids in education. Of the eighteen movie 
projectors five are used in one school only, and hence are 
available all the time. Some of the others are owned by 
Alberta Teachers’ Association Sub-locals, while one is 
owned by a Divisional Board. The latter rotates from 
school to school and is available once a year* Of the others 
six are available once a month, three twice a month, one 
every three weeks, and one occasionally. One rural school 
teacher admitted that his only map was one advertising 
Neilson’s Jersey Milk Chocolate Bar. Of the schools 
possessing maps J2 per cent report that all are very 
old. Other audio-visual aids seem rather limited in 
variety and distribution. It is possible that many of the 
principals answering the questions overlooked some facil¬ 
ities, and this, rather than scarcity of audio-visual 
aids, may partially account for the apparent lack of 
such facilities.

The tabulation of the factual data up to this point 
sets forth a picture of the average pupil's school environ¬ 
ment in Alberta's smaller centres. Kis school has a three 
to two chance of being frame and an even chance of being 
so constructed that an extra classroom can be added. He 
ha.s a 50 per cdnt chance of being able to perform scientific 
experiments in some type of a laboratory , but only a 31 per 
cent chance of being able to play indoors anywhere but in 
in the classroom on a ra.iny day. Ke has the use of twenty- 









- 32 - 


three square feet of the floor area in a box-like classroom 
24 feet by 30 feet. His overcoat more likely than not 
hangs on a hook in a cloakroom, rather than in a locker or 
wardrobe. Most of his work is completed at a movable desk, 
probably at some strain to his eyes for at least part of 
the day. This desk of his, can however, be moved at will 
to evade bright sunshine or to take part in group study, 
but only after making a disturbing noise on the fir floor. 
He has ample opportunity to work at the large vertical 
blackboard, but very seldom has the privilege of posting 
one of his interesting clippings on the overcrowded tack- 
board. In preparing reports to present to the class he 
continually has difficulty, since the hundred books in 
the classroom library do not include enough up-to-date 
reference volumes, nor are there enough modern maps or 
magazines. This classroom is a typical one in a typical 
small Alberta school of to-day, and as a result of its 
inadequacy for modern educational aims and practices 
Alberta teachers want additional accommodations, as in¬ 
dicated in their answers to questions 12 and 13 ®

table XXIV 


TEACHER OPINION REGARDING 

SUFFICIENCY OF PRESENT ACCOMMODATIONS FOR PRESENT CURRICULUM 


Have you sufficient accommodation 
to carry out the present Alberta 
curriculum? 

Yes 16 teachers 

No SO teachers 


It is quite evident that the vast majority of the 
Alberta school teachers herein considered feel the need 
for additional plant accommodations and equipment* 

Since the answers to the last two of these questions 
tended to overlap, the data, collected has been combined, 
and is set forth in Table XXV on the following page. The 
seventy-six* requests of these teachers and their frequency 
are indicative of the types of facilities most urgently 
needed. 

The principal of the three-roomed school at Bawlf 
writes in part as follows: 

"The intermediate and junior rooms should be 
designed for activity; study tables, work tables and 
chairs which are movable would tend toward co-operative 
activity. Classrooms are too small, too conventional 
and too academic. They are workrooms for individual 
academic study, not a real living room decorated and 
designed as a home." 

The principal at Wembley, also a three-roomed school 
writes as follows: 

"I feel that there is much too little spent on books. 
The equipment for physics is practically nil, while in 
chemistry the situation is a shade brighter. .We have 
not even a globe in the entire sfahool. The board kicks 
like a rusted shot-gun to advance $20 for chemicals. 
However, they pay their janitor for a three-roomed school 
$^5 per month for 12 months, more than teachers in 
Saskatchewan are getting and very little less than the 
junior teacher receives here."

It is commendable to find some scnools trying to 
surmount difficulties imposed upon them by the lack of 
school plant facilities essential to modern education. 

I quote from the letter of Mr. B. E. Walker, principal of 
the six room school at Athabasca. 

11 This year we made the following changes and 
additions with respect to our physical plant in an 
attempt to permit a more progressive type of education: 

1. We made all seats in one high school room movable 
and bought some tables. This room is used for 
social studies, dramatics, i&usic, sociology, etc. 

2. The teachers 1 office has been converted into a 
combination typing and chemistry lab room. To' 
accomplish this, folding shelves have been built 
around the walls and a long low table has been 
procured for the centre of the room. 

p. Beginning next fall a much larger appropriation 
for books, magazines and science eo;uipment will 
be budgeted. 11 

An exerpt from the report of the principal of the 
six room school at Big-Valley follows: 

"There should be a separate small room associated 
with each classroom where s. committee working on a 
project could go to carry on an activity without dis¬ 
rupting the work of the whole room. 

"There is more equpiment needed in this school; 
more science equipment for physics; we have little or 
none for any course in physics; we are fairly well off 
for Chemistry 2. We need paper, scissors and all kinds 
of supplies to give children in the lower grades the 
afetivities that they need; the teachers are commonly 
buying the material that just must be had for this 
work - paper, paste and things for various projects. 

Art in the high school requires a certain amount of 
material and the students must group together to get 
it; the same holds for library reference books; always 
the students pay fees for library books and thus some 
reference books are obtained. It seems that there 
should be some way of earmarking a, certain part of the 
government grant for school equipment. Perhaps more 
definite recommendations from the inspector regarding 
equipment and necessary repair to building would help." 







- 36 - 


The principal of the six room school at Mirror writes 
in part as follows: 

11 1 do not believe that we can even approach the 
ideals of the ’new progressive’ type of education with 
our present facilities. I have watched some of our 
teachers attempting a project in a room containing 
43 youngsters, with one table, about two reference books 
related to the topic, desks on slats, and a din that 
would completely week me in afew hours. 

"I maintain that our philosophy and ideals are away 
ahead of our outdated buildings. 

"I’d like a new 'school and I’d like to have more say 
in what it requires than school teachers have had in 
the past. An addition built on our school two years 
ago was thought up mostly in the minds of three trustees 
who haven’t been axmre that schools have changed at all 
in the last forty years. Their main object was to get 
four walls, a roof, a blackboard, and a piece of chalk. 

It was also built out of current revenue." 

When returning the questionnaire, Mr. D. T. Oviatt, 
principal of Barnwell School, consisting of eight classrooms, 
attached a most interesting note. The snapshots of the 
room referred to in that note were taken by Mr. Leo Kunelius, 
at that time school inspector in that area. What Mr. Oviatt 
and his vice-principal have done is most noteworthy and 
shows a realization of the needs of modern education. His 
note follows: 

"Our school is definitely not suitable to provide 
accommodation essential to a satisfactory rendition and 
interpretation of the progressive mode of education. 

It was built during the lush days of the last war, of 
dubious workmanship, and on old-fashioned patterns. 

It is a four-roomed affair, with full basement, and steam 
heating, which in itself is very inefficient. Additional 
accommodations were provided by moving into town an 
old rural frame school, partitioning it to provide 
two classrooms. They are the most unsatisfactory of the 
entire school, yet there our primary pupils spend the 
first three years of their school life. Built in 
approximately 1910? with ordinary standard house-sized 
windows, miserable floors, no ventilation, a shack at 
the back housing a half-submerged hot-air furnace, 
it has served over thirty years with absolutely no re¬ 
novation, if we except the construction of a new 








BARm/tlL PRIMARY ROOM

chimney installed during the past summer. In 19^1 
it became nedessary to provide further accommodation. 

A modern four-room addition could have been added to 
the brick building at a cost of $15,000. Finding 
financing impossible, the board was forced to content 
itself with the erection of a third building. This time 
it was a neat two-room cottage school, of good design 
and appearance. Its only difficulties are the lack 
of a basement, and the severe overcrowding it is under¬ 
going. 

Despite all that has been said so far, this district 
could, with a few thousand dollars emerge with a desirable 
set-up. The four-roomed addition, mentioned above, could 
be built, providing besides the classrooms, a library 
(a little small perhaps, but still better than nothing), 
indoor toilets, an auditorium suitable for dramatics, 

P. T., literary meetings, etc., separate entrances for 
boys and girls (if desired), and an air-conclitioning 
unit. The old building (frame) could be converted into 
a shop and house ec. room, thus releasing the present 
basement rooms for play rooms. The primary grades could 
be moved into the small frame school, where they would 
be free to carry on their own special schedule of inter¬ 
missions, out-door games, rhythmical games, etc., without 
interfering with the advanced grades in any way. All this 
could be ours for $15,000. Yet this district, rated as 
one of the best irrigated sections of the province, and 
entirely debt-free, found it impossible to finance the 
necessary building fund! 

During the yean 19^0-4-1, desperate to do something 
to alleviate the condition of the primary grades, we em¬ 
barked on an experimental re-modelling of our G-ra.de I 
room. The desks were ripped out, and consigned to an 
unused cubby-hole under some stairs, (R. I. P.), and we, 
the principal and vice-principal, undertook to become 
carpenters. We built rough, but sturdy tables, with 
ipi hy 4 n legs, and ply-wood tops, - equally rough, but 
equally sturdy chairs of our own invented pattern. 

Liberal applications of varnish and enamel, in all the 
bright colors that catch a child’s eye, finished to job. 
Presto! We had refurnished, and in our own opinion at 
any rate, greatly improved what had been a most unsatis¬ 
factory room. It is still not satisfactory, as witness 
the lighting and heating, but it is scarcely recogniz¬ 
able by one expecting to find what had been.. The cost? 
Accommodation for thirty-six pupils for an expenditure 
of less than twenty-five dollars. Less than 75jf per 
pupil! The cost was about equal to the cost of three 
of the old standard desks. We feel that the refreshed 
appearance and atmosphere of the room was well worth the 
time and effort that went into our work.”

These six quotations are included as a sample of 
the thinking of the hundred teachers who answered this 
questionnaire. The consensus of opinion is that changes 
in building structure and additional facilities suitable to 
the type of education proposed in the Alberta school curri¬ 
culum are long overdue.

A questionnaire was sent to all the divisional super¬ 
intendents to supplement information received from the teachers

and intermediate school inspectors representing thirty-three 
of the forty-eight divisions in operation at that time*

The data set forth in Tables XXVI and XXVII (following) 
serve to indicate that the construction of schools built by 
the divisions is showing improvement. One school built during 
1941 included a gymnasium and two contained shops. Thirteen 
of the 116 one room schools built previous to 1941 were construc¬ 
ted of log, fifteen had full basements, while two were portable. 
Of the 46 one room schools built during 1941, none were of 
log, eight had full basements, and one was portable. All the 
rest were frame in construction, finished in stucco, insul- 
brick or lumber siding. The fact that no log schools were 
built in 1941 is indicative of progress in this field. 

The data shows a wide range in the average cost per 
classroom - from $1,601 to $3,400. It can also be seen that 




















for every size of school there seems to be a definite upward 
trend in the cost per classroom unit. This may be an en¬ 
couraging sign, or again, the increase may have been largely 
due to the increase in wages, and in the cost of building 
material.

The range of cost of one room schools, as indicated 
in Table XXVIII (following) is entirely too great. The most 
expensive one room school built previous to 19^*1 cost almost 
eleven times as much as the §375 school. In 19^1, the entire 
range moved up the scale, but the most expensive one room 
school still cost over seven times as much as the cheapest at 

















$70°* This condition forcibly brings attention to the matter 
of equality of educational opportunity,

Table XXIX sets forth the fact that since their formation 
fifteen of the thirty-three reporting divisions have built 
24 additions totalling in value $60,^12. They ranged in cost 
from $75 to $9,000 and with two exceptions were one room 
additions. One superintendent also reported that two one 
room schools in his division were completely renovated and 
had basements and workrooms constructed. In one of the 
new outlying divisions it is the policy to renovate the log 
schools by sheathing the inside walls, building cupboards 
and workbenches, and siding and painting the exterior.

- 114 - 


In a number of divisions in southern Alberta no additions 
are being built. Instead, unused schools, if their condition 
warrants it, are moved to new locations, renovated, and used 
for additional accommodation. For instance, an unused one 
room school was moved into Picture Butte by the Lethbridge 
School Division. After renovation, it provided a room for 
domestic science on the main floor and a gBiieraJ. shop for 
the boys in the basement. This division has remodelled old 
schools to provide teachers’ residences in larger centres. 

The judicious use of additions could ease the school build¬ 
ing situation greatly, but the above method of attack is 
only applicable in some of the more or less dried-out areas 
where the population has decreased.

The superintendents of twenty-six out of thirty-three 


divisions started that new schools were required within the 
next five years. The requirements ranged from 25 to 1 per 
division, (cf. Table XXX). The total number of schools 
which needed replacing was 2*1-6. Seven divisions required 
no replacements, while fifteen divisions returned no inform¬ 
ation. 

Some of the divisions had no definite plans or est¬ 
ablished policy regarding replacements* Others plan to 
build a definite number each yesir. As a group the following 
construction was planned: 19*1-2 - 36 schools; 1943 - 27 school 
1944 - 26 schools; 1945 - 26 schools; 1946 - 27 schools; 
later - 16 schools.

Table XXXI emphasizes the fact that most of the divis¬ 
ions depend upon current revenue for the financing of build¬ 
ing programs. Seven divisions use various combinations of 
methods. One of these divisions pays for 50 V er cent of 
construction costs out of current revenue, another SO per cent. 

A number depend largely on current revenue assisted by short 
term bank or private loans of three or four years. In one 
instance one mill has been added to the tax rate. The amount 
thus raised is set aside as a building fund. This seems to 
be a forward-looking policy and one capable of wider application,. 
Question 7 

Is your division following the policy of amalgamating school 


districts and providing school bus facilities?.If so, 

how many amalgamations have been effected?.How many 


buildings have been moved to the central location?... 

How many school buildings are not in use at the present time? 
Have you found that amalgamation has reduced or increased

Tills question of amalgamations was not pertinent to the other 
seventeen divisions returning questionnaires. 


Mr. Wilson, Calgary Division, says, "Centralization offers 
! solution in low enrolment schools and could be applied in 
bout half of this area; i.e . in its prairie portion, not in the 
Ido thills. 


In Neutral Hills Division only forty-four out of the eighty 
jbganized districts are operating schools. Newer buildings, when 
loccupied, are moved to replace old buildings as the need arrises. 

In the Vermilion Division the nine amalgamations effected to 
ate have resulted in two room schools. The superintendent states 
nat as tea.cher supply is reduced, more amalgamations will be 
ffected. 




















Mr. Munroe MacLeod, Wheatland Division, makes the 


following comment: 

"Payments on mileage up to §200 per family per 
year - two regular school vans - savings run up to $>£>00 
on a single school. The children gain more social exper¬ 
iences with larger groups, while the parents are generally 
satisfied with the arrangements. Small schools are often 
inefficient, - no games, no competition, no life." 

In the Lethbridge Division, amalgamations have pro¬ 
gressed to the point that more than half of the rural pu¬ 
pils are now receiving schooling at central schools. This 
not only allows for specialist instruction in Music, Drama¬ 
tics, Domestic Science and General Shop, but also allows a 
better type of school building to be used. The central 
school building should and can provide facilities such as 
auditorium-gymnasium, special subject rooms, shops, and 
library. 

Question g> 


How many schools built during the last year have conscious¬ 
ly incorporated in the design of the building provisions 

for the activity program?.. What provisions were 

made?. 


Table XXXIII (following) indicates that a number of 
the divisions ha.ve made a start in this dlredtiori. In a 
few instances, however, little has been done to meet modern 
demands except to provide full basements. Nine divisions 
have built one room schools with activity workroom-libraries 
to encourage the committee method of study, in intermediate 
grades especially. These vary in size, being g feet by 9 
feet, 6 feet by g feet, 10 feet by 12 feet, and 10 feet by 
17 feet. One division has glazed pant of the partition 













- 














-IL 9 - 

between activity room and classroom, and fitted it with sliding 
windows to aid in supervision. Most of these rooms have been 
separate, although a number were merely alcoves. In one of the 
southern divisions a commendable effort has been made to provide 
24- feet by 2S feet of floor space for an average enrolment of 
fourteen pupils, or 4-S square feet per pupil. In one division, 
bulletin board space has been consciously Increased, while four 
divisions have been mailing greater use of tables and chairs in 
lieu of desks. Edson Division has used plan No.LCF 3&, a low 
cost one room frame school designed under tne supervision of the 
Department of Education. This plan provides two or three small 
spaces which could be used for committee work, but the super¬ 
intendent reports them to be unsatisfactory. Mr. Owen Williams, 
Superintendent, Lethbridge Division, has provided libraries, 
manual training, domestic science and science rooms in four 
schools recently. In contrast, seventeen of the thirty-three 
divisions have done nothing at all to meet this need in any of 
their new buildings. One superintendent, referring to activity 
rooms, says, "It is questionable whether special fooms for such 
work are necessary and desirable."

Question 9 

VJhat physical provisions for an activity program are you intend 
ing to incorporate in new school buildings of your division in 
the near future? 

The greatest demand seems to be for more space, since 
twelve inspectors want work-activity-science-library rooms, 
and one wants a classroom sufficiently large to accommodate 
the pupils easily and permit space for tables and chairs, and 
library-reading tables. One superintendent wants larger work¬ 
rooms, while another suggests that tney be 10 feet by 17 feet. 
Tables and chairs of appropriate size instead of desks will be 
used for all replacements by eight inspectors. One inspector 
intends to use the side walls of one room schools for bulletins 
cupboards, display shelves, workbench with vice, fretsaws, etc. 
Another plans to provide accommodations for shop and household 
economics in the basements of one and two room schools. A 
numoer intend to provide more cupboard space to take care of 
reference bookd, science equipment, drawing apparatus, etc., 
and anotner is placing, in addition to the bookcase, two or 
three small sets of shelves at convenient study corners in 
the room. 

Question 10 

Are alterations or the ouilding of small additions to exist- 
structures contemplated in the near future to further the 

practice of our present program of studies?. 

¥hat is the nature of such contemplated changes?... 

To this question nine inspectors answered in the affirm¬ 
ative and twenty-two in the negative. Two felt that funds 
available and the war-time shortage of materials would affect 












- 51 - 


practice in this respect for the near future. Alterations of 
or additions to existing buildings planned oy these nine men 
are listed as follows: 

1. Addition of activity rooms with glass, partitions. 

2. Where size of structure and enrolment permit, a rear 
end partition to provide a workroom. 

3. Addition of more cupboards. 

4. Alteration of lighting facilities. 

5. Venetian blind light control. 

6. Rearrangement of rooms used for community purposes. 
Question 11 

Have you any suggestions regarding school building design and 
classroom equipment which would be helpful in facilitating the 
newer teaching practices?. 

Table XXXIV (following) summarizes the replies made to 
Question 11 by twenty-six divisional superintendents. In con¬ 
sidering their suggestions it must be kept in mind that the 
majority of schools under the jurisdiction of these superint¬ 
endents are of one and two rooms. This colours their suggest¬ 
ions and accounts for the fact that little interest is dis¬ 
played regarding auditorium-gymnasiums and certain of the other 
suggestions made by principals of larger schools in answering 
the teacher questionnaire. 1

on group work. 

"A system of providing all schools with old magazines 
which could be cut up if required' was introduced, and 
approximately three tons of old magazines were supplied 
throughout the fifty schools of the division." 

.R. E, Rees, Edson Division 

"I like the idea of glazed partitions, plenty of 
small book corners where material may be set out as 
certain topics come to the fore, and movable furniture 
which can be moved aside to clear floor space for act¬ 
ivities which demand it. 

"One room which I visit has a false wall with fold¬ 
ing doors and a built-in stage."

11 1 should like to see some school with one of the 
larger buildings partition off two back corners, each 
provided with at least one window. I would like one 
fitted as a library with table, chairs, bookcasses, and 
magazine racks. This would provide an opportunity to 
introduce a library system. It would also provide a 
place to which groups could retire for special activities. 
The other corner room would serve for science laboratory 
and workroom where constructive problems could be left 
uncompleted without fear of havod before the next enter¬ 
prise period and where biological or scientific experi¬ 
ments could be left to develop for observations. 11 

.E. W; Hinman, Fincher Creek Division 

11 G-et a building well lighted, well heated, well 
ventilated, and provide tables and chairs. A library 
of up-to-date reference books- is a necessity in every 
school. Numerous bookcases, supply cupboards, shelves, 
bulletin-boards, sandtaole, reading table, magazines, 
phonograph, typewriters, pamphlets, piano, films, sports 
equipment, clay, building paper." 

.Kunroe Macleod, Wheatland Division 

"For this division and its low enrolment per class¬ 
room, it is proposed to concentrate effort upon equipment 
rather than on the buildings themselves, save in respect 
zo the activity room, work-counter and storage space. 

"This division is now turning to chairs and tables 
to replaxe the old type standard desk. Tables are made 
by a factory, of first-grade material with masonite tops. 

"In view of the fact that many old type buildings 
can be improved by stucco, new inside sheathing, etc., 
and by reason of the centralization in the course of time, 
i&ajor changes in buildings are not proposed—save in the 
matter of cupboard space and Venetian shades. With the 
future in mind, it is probably correct to avoid expensive 
building programmes for one-roomed schools. Buildings 
ahould probably be so constructed as to permit moving— 
at least in power-farming areas where population is 
thim."

PART III 


BUILDING FOR ALBERTA 1 S NEEDS 



CHAPTER IV 


THE SCHOOL PLANT 

RELATED TO ALBERTA’S EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY 

The problem of designing school buildings for our soc- 
jiety must take into consideration many more factors than enrol¬ 
ment and timetable. The educational needs - administrative, 
physical, mental and social - of the child and of the whole 
community - must be represented by true architectural forms. 

!The planning should be the result of the fullest cooperation 
'on the part of doctor, teacher and administrator with the archi- 
tect. For example, the principal and teacher should study the 
needs of the various activities and tea.ching procedures, thus 
.determining the space requirements in relation to seating, shelv 
ing, storage facilities, exits, and light sources. The doctor 
| should determine the school building requirements for head thy 
!living. The architect should then reduce the requirements of 

I teacher, .administrator and doctor to a harmonious whole so that 

| 

(good proportion, colour and detail are attained as stimulants to 
.learning. The design should then provide the best conditions 
known for the free development of mind, body, and spirit of both 
the student and the community. 

i 

However, during the past few decades, all too often the 
! school was a monumental and not functional structure, wherein 
; education -was a mechanical curriculum-centred procedure. The 
layman and many educationalists firmly believed that the child 

I . 

who followed the educational assembly line would emerge as a 
well-rounded and well-educated member of society. Education 










- 56 - 


was merely a factory-like process apart from living, not an in¬ 
tegral part of community life. 

Today the Alberta citizen is not concerned with monument¬ 
al! sm in school structures, as he once was in the older type 
of building, since monumental ism is a was*ce of money which can 
be put to better educational use. The school ouilding should 
not be used as an advertisement for the community. It must be 
an attractive place for democratic living and not nedessarily 
a monument to gaze upon. Hare objects are preserved in museums 
and public squares. The school building is not meant to live 
forever, but is to be worn out with use. If it were not, it 
would become a symbol of failure. It must be attractive but 
not ornamental, intimate and not overpowering to even the 
smallest child. 

"The teacher should think of the classroom as the pupils’ 
living room. The freedom and happiness in school living which 
should characterize this integrated program demand a set-up in 
the classroom that is both flexible and adaptable." This quot¬ 
ation from Alberta.’s Programme of Studies ( 37 * P- 36 ) emphasizes 
the fact that ours is an activity curriculum, requiring a build¬ 
ing designed for the purpose. It should be a laboratory-workroom- 
classroom for the pupils, and a community centre for both adults 
and children. The Alberta programme brings into play three 
types of creative work or special activities, all demanding 
special equipment and facilities: (l) bench work, mostly car¬ 
pentry, (2) art work, graphic and plastic, and (3) group 
projects on a large scale. The equipment called for by these 






- 57 - 

activities must De varied and the space accommodations ample. 

But space facilities in the majority or our Aloerta 
schools at the present time are behind the educational program 
by ten, twenty or thirty years. One solution is the construction 
of new buildings to meet modern needs. Ooviously, all poorly 
constructed building cannot be replaced at one time. The other 
method of meeting the issue is to adjust old buildings to meet 
new requirements. For example, three conventional classrooms 
in line might be converted into two units with workrooms by alter¬ 
ing some partitions. However, application of this principle is 
somewhat limited in its scope. 

The educational program has a practical and direct bearing 
on both the design of the building and the details of construction. 
Not only the types of activities but also the way tney will be 
taught affect the planning of the rooms. For example, if art 
or science is to be taught in an ant or science room, the plans 
for special built-in facilities will be quite different from the 
plans for the facilities in an all-purpose classroom. 

The new school structure should also be flexible and be 
built with the idea that with future changes in educational 
philosophy and practice, future changes in building will be re¬ 
quired. In 1939 the wonds of Roger Babson, statistician, (20, 
Hilton, p. Ill) forecast a better day when "gradually, as parents 
and taxpayers have more sense, the size of classes will be re¬ 
duced to thirty, to twenty, to ten”. Accordingly, the decrease 
in the number of pupils per class will influence the dimensions 
of the future classroom, and the school structure. 




New school design is also being influenced by the phil¬ 
osophy that the whole environment has a great influence on learn¬ 
ing. Education should not be merely preparation for adult life, 
but participation in the life of the community itself. Today 
the public expects more of the school than the three 11 H" outcome, 
since the development of skills, abilities, and attitudes in many 
fields is deemed essential. This can only be met by a community- 
centred school designed as an integral part of community living. 

A parent-teacher organization can do much to integrate 
school and community life by promoting a better understanding 
of modern education. These groups, meeting in the schools, 
may often have the lack of building accommodations and teaching 
facilities forcefully brought home to them, so that, as rate¬ 
payers and sometimes as board members, they are more willing 
to bring about the necessary changes. In a complacent or apath¬ 
etic community a parent-teacher group can arouse interest in 
educs.tion and hence in school plant requirements. It can help 
to bring the public to realize that education is a continuous 
process developing from within and from without the school - 
a co-operative enterprise in which the school shares the resp¬ 
onsibility of the community forces shaping the child. 

The day is fast disappearing when the school stands out 
as a separate institution in the community. This separation of 
school and community can no longer be allowed, since the schools 
are now charged with the heavy responsibility of preserving our 
British democracy by acting as the focus of a co-operative 
community life. The community centre or hail should ho longer be 



- 59 - 

be separate from the school plant. It is foolish to leave an 
expensive school plant idle for many hours of the week. More 
important, however, it is being realised that the combination of 
school and community centre offers better facilities to both > 
at smaller cost and with greater efficiency. This combined plant, 
the community-school, should then meet the needs of child, youth 
and adult by the addition of new services , by making the building 
a community workshop open many hours a day. 

Let us glance for a moment .at the services rendered in a 
typical Alberta town of eight hundred people by a community- 
centred school deliberately developed as such. Because of the 
many activities grounds of at least two full blocks are required. 
Here the school playground, the community athletic field and the 
separate play area for the primary children are closely related. 
Here we find the tennis courts, area for softball, the baseball 
diamond with a few bleachers for the annual town sports’ day 
and inter-town games, the skating and hockey rink, the curling 
rink, and the bowling green. The unsightly tennis court fence 
and bleachers, the rink dressing rooms and the barn-like curling 
rink are suitably - camouflaged with trees of heavy foliage. 

Since the whole is under the care of one caretaking staff, service 
is provided from early in the morning to late at night. The 
multi-purpose rooms in the school are available for school act¬ 
ivities during the day and for community use outside of school 
hours. The gymnasium, showers, and dressing room facilities 
are available to both groups. So with the auditorium and its 
stage. Such community activities and clubs as the Home and School 



-60- 


Association, the Boys' Band, the town orchestra, the local chap¬ 
ter of the I. 0. D. E., the town service club, the local Board 
of Trade, Scouts, G-uides, the Drama Club, Badminton Club, and 
Bridge and Social Club use the school for meetings. The audit¬ 
orium is even used on occasion on a Sunday night for combined 
all-denominational church services. The central library is used 
by the school during the day, and by the rest of the community 
certain evenings of the week. All in all, it is no longer a 
curriculum-centered school; it is no longer a child-centred school 
it is now a community-centred school. 



CHAPTER V 


THE CLASSROOM-LABORATORY-WORKROOM Ui.IT 
The classroom unit has more signigicance for the ult¬ 
imate success, or failure of the school In its purpose than any 
other part of the school plant. Because of this great import¬ 
ance, the present chapter is devoted to a description of the re¬ 
quirements of the modern classroom unit. Since the traditional 
classroom is becoming a classroom-laDoratory-workroom, consider¬ 
ation is given to classroom size, seating, scale of furnishings, 
and the great variety of other equipment essential to the new 
unit. Finally, an ideal unit for a small Alberta school is 
briefly described. 

The formal classroom of yesterday and even, to a large 
extent, of today must be M de-institutionalized n by making it 
attractive, homelike and colourful. It should not only be attract 
ive from tne point of view of the adult out also from that of the 
child. In the room should be much interesting material in the 
way of suitable and attractive attornments, things to work with, 
visual materials, provisions for the enjoyment of nature and of 
music as well as adequate books and publications. In short, 
it should be an attractive and interesting place - the kind of 
room in which children enjoy staying. 

As the child grows up in such an atmosphere traits of 
self-reliance can develop. We should see an independence in 
regard to personal problems and difficulties, a self-sufficiency 
in work and use of leisure, wider personal responsibility, and 
wider resourcefulness in group situations. The cls^ssroom-lsbor- 
atory-workroom should and will provide a number of different types 
of life situations giving opportunity for practice in n standing 


-61- 




-62- 


on one’s own feet". This quality of self-reliance, however, will 
only be attained in proportion as the child grows up in a demo¬ 
cratic atmosphere, not only in the school, but also in the home 
and elsewhere. 

Many of our old standard classrooms have lacked aeeth- 
etic quality in that they have been too barren and drab. In 
the general field of design many of our modern materials such 
as inlaid linoleums, plywood and acoustical materials, can be 
used as a medium to add interest and variety. These offer great 
possibilities for surface design, texture and colour. Colour 
has emotional possibilities,- since judicious mixing in the 
paint pot can avoid dullness and monotony. There is a danger, 
however, in too great extremes. Consequently, the high colours 
which delight children had better be confined to small areas and 
to their own work. 

The activity unit has grown out of the traditional classroom, 
in which the working out of unit assignments has been found to 
be more or less impractible. For the traditional academic subjects 
a classroom-laboratory-workroom is being required, rather than 
a rigid classroom. For the non-acs-demic courses, a classroom 
workshop is an essential. Here opportunity is given to arouse 
a wide range of interests and to develop manipulative skills 
on a relatively low level. Tnis is our purpose now, rather than 
the promotion of a few highly developed skills for pseudovocational 
purposes. Our Alberta programme today is primarily designed 
to develop meanings, insights, concepts and resultant apprecia¬ 
tions along with certain fundamental skills. Hence our need 






- 63 - 

for reading-room activity, lecture, discussion, demonstrations, 
and group and individual projects. 

The fundamental feature of the classroom-laboratory- 
workroom is that of a clearing-house. for the outcomes of all 
educational activities in a unit of study, in the classroom, 
extra-curriculum, home and community. This room should be 
made flexible By the use of movaole fixtures. In contrast 
with ba.re walls, meagre library facilities, few specimens, 
there should be a richness about its interior. Consequently 
the child will be able to find out for himself to a large 
extent instead of having everything 11 spoon-fed H to him. For 
example, the social studies clearing-house should have tables 
and chairs, file cases for the classified storage of pertinent 
clippings and pictures, generous bulletin board space, rele¬ 
vant books, magazines and exhibits ready for use, and audit¬ 
ory and visual aids. So too, the English classroom or labor¬ 
atory in the intermediate or high school acts as a clearing¬ 
house, and requires much the same sort of furniture and fix¬ 
tures. This requirement was emphasized recently by the 
Superintendent of Schools, Chicago, William H. Johnson (2^, 
pp. 31-33), who in referring to the English laboratory said, 

"The term connotes activity:- round-table and panel discussions, 
committee meetings,'small-group work, supervised study, 
minor research, dramatization, demonstration managed by teacher 
and student." His plan of the new Chicago high school English 
laboratory shows in addition to the teacher 1 s desk and thirty 
movable desks, a table and recording-playback phonograph, 


































































a movable book cabinet, built-in bookcases, a file, a magazine 
rack, more corkboard than blackboard, and a conference table 
and eight chairs. 

To accommodate the greater variety of equipment and 
activities, the new classroom must have a greater area. 

Present day practice in standard classroom size is whown 
in Ontario's General Regulations (17, p. l 4 ): "A standard 
classroom for 40 pupils shall be 3 2 feet long, 23 feet wide 
and 12 feet, 3 inches high; with a floor space of IS. 4 - square 
feet for each child and an air space of 225 cubic feet for 
each pupil." This of course is a standard classroom for more 
or less conventional education as shown by the fact that it 
is intended for the use of forty pupils. Expert opinion, an 
summed up by Krahmer, ( 26 , p. 3 &)> seems to agree that more 
space is necessary for modern education. 

" 96 % of 269 competent judges indicated that class¬ 
room size should be increased from one-fifth to one- 
quarter the length of the standard classroom to provide 
sufficient space for an activity program. 10 % of 273 
judges suggested that part of the room should be part¬ 
itioned off for the more noisy activities in the act¬ 
ivity program". 

Accordingly, the classrooms in the highly praised Rolph Road 
Public School, Leaside, Ontario, which are 23 feet by 33 feet, 
could only be suits-ble for modern education for a class of 
twenty-five or thirty pupils. This is also true of the 
classrooms 36 feet in length in the G-lenora School in Edmonton. 

One suggested length for the work type classroom is 
37 feet. Two such classrooms would share one large workroom 
IS feet by 23 feet located between them. On the other hand, 




-65- 

Lincoln Elementary School, Redlands, California, Is using 
a single activity room 23 feet by 40 feet without any separate 
workroom. Their kindergarten, however, is 46 feet long plus 
an L-shaped alcove 23 feet by 20 feet. Kindergarten and 
primary grades naturally need more area for each classroom 
unit. Sherman Elementary School ( 4 , Barrows, p. 21 ) illustrates 
this by making its kindergarten 23 feet by 5^ feet plus a small 
workroom. 

Another California school, the Huntington School at 
San Marino, has ten classrooms, each 25 feet by 45 feet (19, 
Haydis, pp. 21 - 24 ). Each unit consists of three parts not 
entirely separate. Large archways are used to cut down the 
apparent size and to create a more, intimate atmosphere. 

The College Elementary School, Central Washington College 
of Education at Ellensburg Washington (9) has a larger class¬ 
room unit. Each of the nine units is 23 feet by 60 feet 
and in most cases consists of a recitation room, a workroom, 
a small office and a storage alcove. 

Another excellent example of a classroom unit is that of 
the Laboratory School, Eastern Washington College of Education, 
Cheney, Washington. This unit is illustrated in Figure 2. 

These larger classroom units allow for necessary shift¬ 
ing without loss of time, confusion and disorder. In modern 
education, sometimes all the pupils in the class are participat¬ 
ing in a single activity such as dramatics, lecture-discussion, 
recitation, debate, open-forum or demonstration. At times all 
are working on individual tasks. At another time, some are 
at individual tasks and some are in committee work.

all are working in groups. This degree of flexibility cannot 

I 

be attained in the traditional classroom. 

Formal seating arrangements conflict with the new 
active space-consuming projects. Screwed-down seats should 
disappear, since the modern classroom needs furniture which 
may be grouped to allow either discussion or group activities. 
Hence the small unit, shown in Figure 4, consisting-of table 
and chair gives the greatest degree of flexibility in room 
combinations. Other possible variations are: (l) the single 
movable desk and seat, (2) the tablet-arm chair, (3) large 
tables of uniform size and chairs, (4). a variety of movables 
combined with a few fixed desks of the traditional type. 
However, the single table and chair give maximum flexibility. 
Individual tables can fit together to make tables of various 
sizes as required. In addition, one or two large tables are 
necessary for exhibits, reading from spread-out newspapers 
end magazines, and large scale graphic work. 

Purchases of classroom furniture reflect this trend 
towards movable seaicing. Sumner (50, P* 37) states that 
whereas only 25 % of the seating sold ten years ago was movable, 
today the proportion is 90£>. It might be a good policy to 
start providing the newer type of furnishings only to teachers 
successfully doing unit work in whole or in part. For some 
teaxhers and for some courses it might be better to start 
with a variety of movables plus a few fixed desks. 

Incidentally, it is important to realize that modern 
furniture for unit work is undesirable in an over-crowded 


classroom. Here, movable seating would be a hindrance rather 











-6S- 

than a help. In the overcrowded classroom the more firmly 
the seats are fixed to the floor the better. The first move 
should be a reduction of the pupil teacher ratio to at least 
thirty to one; then the change in furnishings can follow. 

Scale as well as flexibility in furnishings must not be 
overlooked. Preferably they must be built for, or adjustable 
to each age and size of child. This factor has always been 
of importance, but it has taken on a new significance in the 
activity room, where so many operations relate to height and 
reach of the child. Height changes very gradually during 
primary years, - about one inch per year, while in Division II 
the growth is two inches per year. If the adult designing 
the room would sit on the floor, look around and be governed 
accordingly, a better perspective would be gained and the 
result would be more suitable to children of these ages. 

Thus windows should be low enough for the child to look out. 
Furniture, shelving, coat-hangers should also take the height 
of the child into consideration. Since a child.’s easy reach 
is only 10 per cent higher than his height, mucin shelving 
in use today is far too high. The child* s free access to 
tools and materials is inherent in the program. Therefore 
the lower zone should contain all his various needs, library 
books, tools, utensils and materials. Nothing need be provided 
above this level except for decorative features, and general 
storage space for the exclusive use of the teacher. 

The classroom-laboratory-workroom needs more than furn¬ 
ishings to scale, movable seating, greater floor area, per pupil, 






- 69 - 


and an attractive and homelike atmosphere. It requires con¬ 
venient storage space for equipment and supplies, adequate 
pinning space, filing cabinets, bookshelves, display areas, 
built-in easels, workbench and running water. A work-counter 
on the window side can serve many purposes. In addition, 
individual storage cubicles, tables, saw-horse, vice, tools, 
cabinet under sink, zinc-lined clay chest, tool cabinet on 
castors, electric plate, drawers large enough for imperial 
sheets, lumber storage space, a book corner with ample shelving, 
ana display cabinets for exhibits of natura.1 history would be 
necessary in any rural or small town laboratory-workroom. 

One of the most important of these additional require¬ 
ments is sufficient tackboard. Few teachers ever admit having 
enough. It was important in the traditional school, but is 
more so in a modern one, since it is indispensable as display 
space. For this purpose, cork tackboard is generally consid¬ 
ered to be the best. It should replace much of the black¬ 
board at the rear of the traditional room, should cover the 
upper sections of the doors; and should be located above 
all blackboards;—in short, wherever a few square feet of 
space are available. Excellent use of tackboard is illustrated 
by Crawford (10, p. 51) in four elevations of one San Diego 
classroom * The area of the tackboard, some located on all 
four walls, is approximately three times that of the black¬ 
board area. Some schools finish the walls in panelling of 
pine, or some sort of fibre board. Thus thumb-tacks can be 



- 70 - 


used anywhere. 

Much space can be saved for added facilities and employed 
to better advantage in the activity room by using wardrobes 
instead of the old cloakroom. A built-in wardrobe 2-g- feet 
deep and 15 feet long can easily accommodate the wraps of forty 
pupils. Six two-foot sections are enough for the average class. 
Coat hangers can be permanently attached by means of a ring 
to the horizontal rod, whose height from the floor will depend 
on the grade. A shelf can be located above the rod, while 
foot gear can be placed on the floor. Each two-foot section 
will have a separate door, either of the disappearing type, 
or of single hung sash sliding upwards. However, the latter 
tends to be nois 2 f. The upper half of either type may be faced 
with reversible panels of cork and blackboard. Ventilation 
may be obtained by means of a grill at the bottom of the door 
and a vent at the top back inside of the wardrobe. Tnis plan 
also has the advantage of eliminating the quite common cloak¬ 
room scuffle since the pupils are all under the eye of the 
teacher. It is a good idea to divide the wardrobe into two 
blocks, and locate them in different pants of the room to do 
away with some of the congestion in the one area at dismissal 
time. 

In large intermediate and high schools lockers a_re 
generally preferred. However, in buildings eight rooms and 
less outside Alberta’s cities, where single grade rooms ane 
rarely found and consequently not the same degree of moving 
about is experienced, built-in wardrobes opening into the 
classroom or opening into the corridor near the home room 





-71- 

would possibly look after the cloaks as efficiently as do 
lockers. A good example of built-in wardrobes in a single 
block opening into the classroom may be seen in the G-lenora 
Elementary School, Edmonton. 

By way of summary, a brief description of an ideal 
classroom unit will illustrate the main features of the 
classroom-laboratory-workroom unit. Suppose that it houses 
Grades V to VIII in a three room school. This spacious unit, 

23 feet by 42 feet, is partitioned into three rooms. The 
largest, 23 feet by 3 2 feet, contains thirty movable tables 
and chairs of the type illustrated in Figure 4. There is also 
a conference and work-table at which eight pupils may be seated. 
Each pupil has extra storage spa.ce allotted to him at the 
rear of the room in the form of individual cubicles, 12 inches 
square by 9 inches. A storage closet, 4 feet wide and 2 
feet deep, and a built-in chest of drawers large enough to 
hold an imperial sheet of paper are located on the corridor 
side of the room. On either side of the closet and drawers, six 
foot blocks of built-in wardrobes provide ample cloak facilit¬ 
ies. The wardrobe doors have the upper part faced with revers¬ 
ible panels of tackboard and blackboard, which when removed 
can also serve as easels. On a number of small corner shelves 
topical book displays are in evidence. Toward the back of the 
room in a bay window is located a small aquarium and conserva¬ 
tory. The space to the rear of the main room is divided into 
two smaller rooms each about 12 feet by 10 feet. The partition 
between them and the main room is partly glazed to facilitate 
better supervision. One small room contains book shelves, 






- 70 _ 

i •- 


a magazine rack, a reading or conference table and chairs. 

The other room has a work-bench against all four walls, and 
a number of stools. Storage cupboards and shelves for tools 
and supplies are located below the benches. Each of the three 
rooms.has some blackboard space. The interior walls through¬ 
out the unit are finished attractively in patterned fibre- 
board, thus providing an abundance of tackboard area. The 
floors are covered with mottled maroon-colored linoleum with 
a contrasting yellow-green inlaid border. The whole unit 
provides a pleasant place for the eleven to fourteen ye^r old 
child and a functional centre for modern education. 












CHAPTER VI 

THE SCHOOL-COMl-IUNIT Y LIBRARY 


The general responsibility of the library for its share 
in the national program of education is interpreted by the 
American Library Association and reported by Joeckel (22, p. 1) 
as follows : 

"To assemble and preserve books and related matter!als in 
organized collections and, through stimulation and guidance, 
to promote their use to the end that children, young people, 
men, and women may have opportunity and encouragement; 

"To educate themselves continuously; 

"To aid in the advancement of knowledge; 

"To improve their capacity for appreciation and prod¬ 
uction in cultural fields; 

"To improve their ability to participate usefully in 
activities in which they are involved as citizens; 

"To equip themselves, and keep themselves equipped, 
for efficient activity in useful occupations and 
practical affairs; 

"To keep abreast of the progress in the sciences and 
. other fields of knowledge; 

"To maintain the precious heritage of freedom of ex¬ 
pression and a constructively critical attitude to¬ 
ward all public issues; 

"To make such use of leisure time as will promote per¬ 
sonal happiness and social well-being". 

The relationship of the school library to the public 
library is an important issue, especially since few public 
libraries are in existence in Alberta towns and rural centres 
havihg schools of the size considered in this work. The public 
library is supported by the municipal government and the school 
library by the school district, ea.ch a separate legal entity. 
However, it is the same public which supports both; therefore 
co-operation between the two is. desirable in the town and village. 
A combined library supported by both would benefit both the 
school and the community. 


- 73 - 





- 7 ^- 

This practice has begun in a number of the smaller 
centres in California. In some, the general public are given 
access to the school-community library at all times; in others, 
outside of school time; and in yet others, which are located 
in smaller centres, the library is open only on certain even¬ 
ings. In some, pupil and adult boohs are kept entirely separ¬ 
ate, while in others most books are available for either group, 
except for those most needed by the school. Each group thus 
has access to a larger number of volumes. A further advantage 
is that the problem of staffing the library is simplified. 

Modern education with its school library service is 
training tne youth of today to use books and libraries as 
tools. Much of this value will be lost if there is no library 
service available to the school graduate. For this reason 
library service throughout life-is as necessary in Alberta’s 
smaller centres as elsewhere. The majority of people buy 
few books. The Lynds, whose surveys of social phenomena in 
the small American city of Middletown have become authorita¬ 
tive, came to the conclusion that r, book reading in Middletown 
means...... overwhelmingly, the reading of public Horary books”. 

( 31 , p. 232 ). 

Educators are also emphasizing the importance of the 
school library to the present day curriculum. Pupils are 
encouraged to read widely in books, magazines, newspapers, 
pamphlets and bulletins rather than to limit their activities 
to. one book. The child becomes at home in this world of books ? 
magazines, newspapers, pamphlets and bulletins, and is trained 





- 75 - 


to read discriminately and to think independently. n Read 
not to contradict and confute, not to believe and take for 
granted, not to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and 
consider." (3, bacon, p. 3^ 2 )* The school library in present 
day education has the important function of providing material 
for teaching the pupils to read as Bacon would have them do. 

The school library aJ.so encourages reading as an enjoyable 
activity in the well-rounded life. It is only through books 
that man can inherit the legacy of man from his forefathers. 
Demiashkevich (13, p. 17°) calls this right to use books 
"the right to share in the accumulated experience of humanity". 

In relation to the actual school building, this school- 
community library should be centrally located in the school, 
close to an entrance for the convenience of the public. 

Thus people will not be passing classrooms during school time. 
In the. small one room school there should be a small separate 
room, or at least a nook where the school’s own books and 
books from circulating libraries are made available. 

To be effective the school-community library must have' 
the active co-operation of tne classroom teacher, the principal 
and the divisional superintendent, it is their duty to inter¬ 
pret the school-community library concept to the school board, 
the municipal council, and the community, so that new school 
buildings will have proper library facilities and old ones 
will receive the necessary alterations or additions. The co¬ 
operation of a library supervisor is also needed. There is 
room for a number of these officials throughout the province 




- 76 - 


in the employ of the Department of Education. The supervisor 
should be a specialist in liorary work, wno can assist to 
plan and unify the library programs of various schools, co¬ 
ordinate use of materials, and encourage greater co-operation 
between the school-community, extension, and larger public 
libraries. 

A number of small schools of 250 to 350 students 
having school-community libraries employ full-time librarians. 
Thus better library service is given to both school and 
community. The librarian should have both professional and 
educational training, and should never be expected to per¬ 
form these duties and 'teach a full day. In small schools, 
the library should have definite part-time service of a 
teacher-librarian, or of an itinerant librarian who visits 
schools in three or four towns situated close together. 

In addition, services of student-ansistents could be avail¬ 
able wnen the part-time teacher or travelling librarian is 
away. The teacher-librarian should teach part-time, serve 
in the library part-time, and have some half-days o.ff to 
compensate for duty in the library during some evenings. 

Thus, for example, a school of eight classes would have a 
staff of nine persons, the librarian-teacher and the principal 
teaching only half-time. Thus time will also be made available 
for the principal to do necessary guidance work and to attend 
to required administrative duties. 

The school-community library must have ample space. 
According to the requirements of the Association of Colleges 


























- 77 - 


and Secondary Schools of the Southern States (23,' Johnson, p.12) 
thd school library should be large enough to accommodate at 
least 10 per cent of the students enrolled. However, in most 
of the schools dealt with in this work the percentage should 
be higher since the schools are small. In any school-community 
library the seating capacity should be such that one whole 
class may use it for a library period. This capacity will 
then be sufficiently large to accommodate the general public 
outside of school hours. 

In addition to suitable space accommodation, books 
and a certain amount of equipment are essential. The books 
should be both contemporary and classic, chosen on the re¬ 
commendation of children, parents, teachers, principal, super¬ 
intendent, and library-supervisor. There is needed in these 
small libraries plenty of open shelves, a charging desk, 
reading tables and chairs, a card-catalogue case, magazine 
and newspaper racks, some enclosed shelves for reserved books, 
files for pamphlets, clippings and pictures, tackboard, 
a movable blackboard, dictionary stand, and files for both 
lantern slides, picture slides and phonograph; records. This 
central library, thus equipped, will act as a clearing house 
for much of the classroom-library material. 

The fundamental shift away from the single text-book 
method of teaching necessitates the existence of classroom 
libraries apart from and in conjunction with the central 
school library. iJhile the central library is the real heart 
of the school, each Glassroom is an artery. A rich and per¬ 
tinent classroom library is a necessity in the classroom- 





laboratory-workroom. Tne extensive reacting list is better 
than the single text since the latter has one vocabulary 
burden, one level of sentence structure, one literary style, 
one point of view, and one fixed set of topics. Thus une 
single text does not provide for individual differences in 
reading ability.,, reading interest, and taste in the same 
manner that five or six best texts plus an extensive read¬ 
ing list can provide for them. 

The classroom library will contain some permanent 
oooks, while otner groups of books from the central library 
will be lent for tne duration of* a unit of study. In addit¬ 
ion it will contain some lent by the teacher and some by 
pupils and their families. Here, on occasion, will also be 
found books from circulating libraries. This small library 
unit should in addition contain a file of clippings related 
especially to work of the particular grade or subject, and 
racks of pertinent magazines. A separate well-lighted small 
room for this unit with a glazed partition on the classroom 
side is preferable, since students of one group could use 
it as a library, conference, or reading room while the 
teacher is busy with another. This is especially true in 
an ungraded school. 

It is recommended by the North Central Association of 
Colleges and Secondary. Schools (U.SA.) that at least seventy- 
five cents per pupil be spent on library books per year by 
those schools desirous of maintaining accredited status. 

(25, Koos, p. 541). This means JO for a class of forty 
pupils and is far above the $11 median for the group of 




- 79 - 


schools considered in Chapter II. According to the law 
it is the responsibility of the school authorities to provide 
for the essential needs of their schools. Since the purpose 
of the school library is identical with that of the school 
itself, and since it is part and parcel of all activities 
and not a separate entity, it then becomes the duty of the 
school authorities to provide more library facilities in 
smaller Alberta schools. This principle is- being accepted 
in part in certain regions in Canada today, for the Protest¬ 
ant section of the Department of Education, Province of Quebec, 
has recognized that with the advent of the activity program, 
classroom libraries are becoming more necessary. Accordingly 
in 193 o and 1939 library grants totalling ;j55 per classroom 
were given to high and intermediate schools benefitting from 
the Superior Education grants. (46, Spotlight, p. 7 )* Before 
however, adequate support will be given, the school board and 
municipal council must have become convinced that the school- 
community library is an essential to modern living. 










CHAPTER YII 


SCHOOL LIGHTING 

Because of its general importance, a separate CxOapter 
is herein devoted to the question of classroom lighting. 

Although classroom lighting does not affect the particular 
problem of school building design in relation to modern educ¬ 
ation, it does affect the general problem of designing good 
school buildings, and consequently will be dealt with in 
this chapter with particular regard for conditions in schools 
in smaller centres in Alberta. 

Four of the chief factors affecting the light avail¬ 
able to classrooms are: (l) orientation and surroundings, 

(2) area and height of window, (3) width of room, and (k-) colour 
of the interior. 

(l) Orientation and Surroundings . For our latitude 
and our climate orientation of the unilaterally lighted room 
has its difficulties. Since for most months of our school 
year the sun is seldom very high in the sky, its control 
is difficult in all but rooms having a northern exposure. 

The sunlight is too bright and difficult to control in a 
south room; in an east room conditions are bad for an hour 
or two every morning, since the sun’s rays shine directly into 
the pupil’s eyes; in a west room the low sun’s rays not only 
bother the teacher but also tend to cause a blackboard glare. 

A north room does not suffer from this problem. Here, however, 
the room will be too dank, dull and cheerless if north windows 
are the only source of light. The school site should thus 


-SO- 








-gi¬ 


be large enough to allow the best possible orientation, 
and to prevent surrounding buildings and trees from cutting 
out too great a proportion of sky shine. The amount of- illum¬ 
ination received in the classroom through the windows varies 
directly with the amount of sky visible. Adjacent buildings 
and heavy foliage tend to reduce this drastically. According¬ 
ly, buildings and trees should not be too close to classroom 
windows. 

( 2 ) Area and Height of Windows. It is generally 
accepted that the ratio of glass area to floor ares- should 
oe from one-quarter to one-sixth,depending on the intensity 
of illumination. (17, C-eners.1 Regulations, p. 4, 1, American, 
p. 20 ). It is a good plan, to have metal framed windows; 
thus the maximum amount of light can be received for the size 
of the opening. If the glass is kept thoroughly clean, a 
surprising improvement can be noted. 

In rooms having windows facing either north, northwest, 
or northeast, no blinds are required. If roll blinds 8-re 
used in the other rooms, those mounted at the middle are pre¬ 
ferred.. The purpose of blinds, of course, is to cut out the 
glare caused by direct sunlight without eliminating illumination. 
Therefore, except when the shade is being used to cut out 
some direct sunlight, there is absolutely no reason to cover 
any part of the glass area-. By misuse of window shades, many 
teachers have not only rendered useless a portion of window 
expenditure, but have deprived thirty or forty pupils of 
their rightful share of illumination, probably aggravating 

4 

eye trouble in many instances. 




Although natural classroom lighting is the best, if 
sufficient, it must sometimes b e controlled by shades. Roll 
blinds attached at the top are most commonly used in Alberta, 
yet these are unsatisfactory, since tney not only cut out 
the glare but eliminate too much light at the same time. In¬ 
direct solar lighting by means of Venetian blinds of aluminum 
strips is the most satisfactory. These blinds are adjustable 
to retain illumination and eliminate gloom caused by drawn 
roll blinds. The initial cost is greater, but the life of 
the blind is longer; service is better; upkeep costs are less, 
since they never need scrubbing or refinishing. Most import¬ 
ant, there is less eye strain and discomfort. Thus in recogn¬ 
ition of their value, we find that the use of Venetian blinds 
in classrooms has been increasing in this continent. 

(3) Width of Room. The width of a classroom also affects 
lighting and .depends upon the height of the window. The 
norma,! ceiling height is 12 feet, and as a. result, the upper 
sash will probably be 11-|- feet from the floor. The width of 
the room, then, will be 23 feet — twice the distance from the 
floor to the top of the window glass. The width of the room 
is important, because it affects the amount of illumination 
available on the desk at the pupil’s work. The illumination 
measured in foot-candles on the desk tops of six rows of 
desks starting from the window side of the room were as foll¬ 
ows: (l) on a bright day —- 9°> 35> 20, 12, g, 5? (2) on 

a cloudy day — 50, 22, l4, S, 5> 3« (l> American, p. 24). 

This serves to illustrate that the gres/ter the width of a 








-S3- 


classroom, the less the illumination from natural means on 
the last row of desks. Many authorities now recommend 25 
foot-candles of illumination for regular classrooms, and 35 
footcandles for sight-saving rooms, shops, drafting and art 
rooms. Therefore the width of the classroom must not be too 
great. 

(4) Colour of the Inferior . Colour in the school 
is important, and is pertinent to the problem of school 
lighting. In the first place, eye-straining reflections 
can be eliminated by the use of dull finish paint and varnish. 
Secondly, both warm and cool colours have their place in the 
school. The warm colours, red, orange, and yellow, give 
an advancing effect; the cool colours, green, blue and purple 
a receding effect . The cool colours should, probably be used 
in rooms having south and west exposures. These greens and 
blues are more restful, less exciting, and because of their 
receding effect tend to make a small room appear larger. 

A classroom exposed to the north or northeast, or a very large 
room, needs the advancing effect of the warm buffs, and hues 
of red, orange or yellow. Generally speaking the cool colours 
and the neutrals are recommended for larger areas. In working 
areas, tans, browns, reds, and yellows may be used in small doses. 
The corridor is also a good place for some exciting colour 
combinations; the entrance way, however, should be a flat 
white to allow for easier eye adjustment. The colour scheme 
of the school should vary from room to room, depending upon 
window exposure, age-level of pupils, and particular size 






and use of the room. Thus throughout the grades will appear 
a procession of colour harmonies; there will be something 
distinctive about each room; each will assume a personality 
of its own to the child. 

To overcome direct blackboard glare and to bring the 
light over the child’s left shoulder it has been recommended 
that the rows of seats be no longer parallel to the window 
wall, but be placed at an angle. Johnson ( 24 , p. 32 ) uses 
this principle in arranging the seating in his high school 
English laboratory! Garden Oaks School, Houston, Texas, 
(Rogers, 4l, p. 35) a six room elementary school with an 
auditorium, carries this principle one step farther. The 
blackboard wall is placed at an angle of'67 degrees to the 
window wall rather than $0 degrees. Schools using the same 
idea are also illustrated in Plates 4, 6, and 9 in Chapter VIII 

Because of the difficulty of controlling bright sunlight 
north light and clerestory sunshine is being used extensively 
in a number of the smaller new schools in the United States. 

(If the reader is unfamiliar with the principle of clerestory 
lighting, he may refer to Figure 5> following). Direct side 
lighting is annoying to a pupil, while rear lighting is not 
the best for reading -- hence the use of bi-lateral clerestory 
lighting. 

One application of this principle shows a row of win¬ 
dows at the back of the room, which has a northern exposure. 
This is the work area of the room. On the east side are the 
high clerestory windows, lighting the blackboard on the south 
wall. Light combined from the two sources, high left and 




- 35 - 


rear, affords good illumination.on all the pupils' desks. 

Another use of clerestory lighting is illustrated in 
Figures 5 and 6. Figure 5 shows the classroom in section 
viewed from the rear. The windows on the left extend to 
10 feet from the floor, while the clerestory windows, upper 
right, extend from 10 feet to 13 feet 6 inches. The ceiling 
slopes from 1*1- feet to 10 feet 6 inches, thus providing an 
average height of 12 feet 3 inches. The orientation is such 
that the large windows at the left require no blinds since 
the exposure is either northeast or northwest. Sunlight 
would never directly enter these windows during school hours. 
It can, however, come in through the smaller clerestory win¬ 
dows, where it can be controlled by means of the aluminum 
Venetian blinds. Orientation is shown in Figure 6, and 
schools designed to utilize this method of lighting are shown 
in Fls_tes S and 10. 

Somewha.t akin to this is the saw-tooth factory system 
of lighting as illustrated in Figure S. Since direct sunlight 
would be hand to control when coming through the slanted por¬ 
tion of gla.ss, a, northern, northeastern, or northwestern 
exposure is preferred for this method. 

A sloping ceiling has been successfully used to improve 
lighting conditions in Oakdale Union School, Oakdale, Calif¬ 
ornia,. (32, Mayo, p. M-) . The ceiling slopes from the top 
of the windows, which are somewhat higher than usual , to 
the opposite wall at a 12 degree angle. By adjusting the 
Venetian blinds light can be directed to the ceiling and then 
to the dark side of the room. In this school the window

area equals ko per cent of the floor area. Photometric 
tests proved the Illumination to be more satisfactory than 
it was in the older type of room. 

Prism light-directing glass blocks, as shown in Figure 7> 
work for better illumination. Areas near the windows in the 
room are illuminated by daylight coming directly through 
the transparent glass. The upper two-thirds of the trans¬ 
parent glass window has light control by means of light¬ 
directing aluminum Venetian blinds. Pupils 'may see outside 
through the lower third, and thus rest the eye muscles with 
a distant view. Areas in the room farther removed from the 
windows are lighted indirectly by the light from the prismatic 
glass blocks as indicated. Because this is diffused lighting 
the glass blocks may extend the full length of the room. 
Ordinarily, windows should not.be closer to the front of the 
room than the front seat. Since glass blocks allow only 
80 per cent light transmission, one-fourth more area must 
be utilized than the area of clear glass displaced. Glass 
blocks are never recommended as the sole means of lighting 
in a classroom, nor should they be used below the pupil's 
eye level because of an objectionable glare. Judiciously 
used, they are of value in the lighting of corridors, stair¬ 
ways, lavatories, halls and especially the gymnasium. Their 
generous use in a gymnasium is recommended since the unsightly 
protective window grill-work can thus be eliminated. A good 
example of the correct use of glass block in buildings is 
illustrated by Holmes (21, p. 19) in the useful bay window 






-SS- 


in a kindergarten at St. Clair, Michigan. 

The solutions to classroom lighting discussed so far 
would undoubtedly improve conditions in Alberta 1 s rural schools 
where no artificial lighting is available. The only real 
solution, however, is to implement the suggested improvements 
with proper artificial lighting, automatically controlled by 
means of the photoelectric cell. Only in this way can the 
pupil sitting at the desk near the wall opposite to the win¬ 
dows be assured of sufficient illumination for proper reading 
conditions. If incandescent lighting is used, best results 
will be obtained from indirect units. Indirect lighting 
does a better job of light distribution than other methods, 
as well as eliminating direct and reflected glare, and shad¬ 
ows . 

A good Canadian example of artificial lighting in the 
classroom is to be found in the Holph Road School, Leaside, 
Ontario. The large steel-framed window and Venetian blinds 
provide controlled natural daylight. In addition artificial 
lighting is provided by six indirect units in three circuits, 
an inside row, an outside row, and a circuit above the black¬ 
board. The whole is controlled by means of a photoelectric 
tube set to produce twenty-five foot candles of illumination 
on all the pupils 1 desks without glare or shadows. 

Since 3ts introduction in 193^> fluorescent lighting 
has proven to be the most efficient type of artificial light¬ 
ing. It can not only be operated more chea.ply but it provides 
in the classroom a closer approach to nature's intended envir- 

























onment. For classroom use 4-0-watt daylight Mazda F fluor¬ 
escent lamps have proven suitable. Their efficiency of 4-5 
lumens per watt compares more than favorably with the effic¬ 
iency of the 300 and 500-watt Mazda C incandescent lamps of 
20 lumens per watt. The rated laboratory life of the Mazda 
F lamp is 2500 hours. The life of the 3°0 and 500-watt 
Mazda C lamp averages 1000 hours. (12, Darley, p. 7)• 

Thus tne effeciency of the fluorescent lamp is more than 
twice that of the incandescent, While its life is two and 
one-half as great. 

In the not too distant future, the germicidal lamp, 
a "first cousin" of the fluorescent lamp, may become standard 
equipment in the classroom, destroying air-borne bacteria 
indoors just, as sunshine does out-of-doors. In addition, 
there are available today good sunlight lamps which can pro¬ 
vide healtn-giving ultra-violet radiation in our classrooms 
during the winter months. Thus, step by step, indoor classroom 
conditions are approaching man’s natural outdoor environment. 







CHAPTER VIII 


PROPOSED DESIGNS OF 

ONE TO EIG-HT ROOM SCHOOLS FOR ALBERTA 

The blueprints of proposed schools discussed in this 
ciis.pter summarize in graphic form the preceding part of this 
work. Ideas from various sources, in addition to the author’s 
own, are embodied in their design and applied specifically 
to Alberta, conditions. 

Plate 1 

Two One Room S choo ls - Remodelled 

Obviously, all schools poorly constructed from the 
point of view of modern education cannot be replaced with 
up-to-date buildings. Hence old buildings, where soundness 
of construction permits, should be adjusted to meet modern 
requirements. We must get away from the one room chalk-box 
type of school. Attractiveness is as important for a one 
room rural school as for any type. In any community, the 
school building should be as attractive and comfortable as 
the best home, and in many a rural area, it should set a. 
higher standard. 

Plate 1 shows two typical one room schools with which 
the author happens to be acquainted, and indicates what could 
be done to modernize them. The plan at the top of the page 
starts with the cla.ssroom and cloakroom at Blackmud School, 
southeast of Leduc. An addition 10 feet by 3° feet on the 
north end provides two extra well-lighted, rooms. The work¬ 
room is separated from the classroom by a partly glazed part-

ition to facilitate supervision. Under these windows have 
'been placed individual cubicles which provide extra storage 
space for each pupil. Section A-A, Plate 10, illustrates 
this type of glazed partition and cubicle. The workroom 
contains a solid bench on three sides, cupboards under the 
Dench, and a storage closet for equipment. The other room 
is the library and reading room, and contains an open shelf 
bookcase and more storage space. Both small rooms can be 
used for group conferences and committee work. 

The other plan of Plate 1 starts with Good Hope School, 
east of Fort Saskatchewan, which,in contrast to the Blackmud 
School, already has a basement. The windows are moved to 
the west side to provide unilateral lighting and to allow 
for an addition, 10 feet by 3^ feet 6 inches on the east 
side of the school. The workroom here is slightly larger 
and/bebause of its east and south windows,will be bright 
throughout the school day. 

Plate 2 

Two Room School - Remodelled 

For this example of remodelling a typical two-room 
building, the Jaroslaw School northeast of Bruderheim, has 
been chosen. At the present time its entrance faces north. 

It has a junior room with east inlndows, a senior room with 
west windows, separate cloak rooms, and a full basement with 
furnace room, fuel room, and playrooms with concrete floors. 

The proposed remodelling consists in placing cubicles 
in each classroom and building an addition l*k feet by 50 feet 

























































- 9 ^~ 


on the south side of the school. Each class is then provided 
with a well-lighted workroom and a library-reading-group con¬ 
ference room. The liorary rooms each contain a built-in 
low counter with cupboards underneath and open-shelf book 
area above. For the junior room, glazed partitions between 
the small rooms and the classroom are obviously impossible 
since this wall is the front of the room and supports the 
blackboard. In any remodelling of schools tilting of the 
blackboards by moving out the bottom by four inches will do 
much to cut down glare and improve blackboard legibility. 

The most important part of this dissertation lies in 
the following plates. They set forth architectural designs 
in plan for completely new school buildings. 

Before erecting new school buildings the location and 
layout of the site should be considered from the point of 
view of safety and common sense. Location and plot plan are 
influenced by the following factors: 

1. The terrain should be nearly level, yet possess enough 
slope to provide good drainage. 

2. The school should be in clear view from all highway and 
street approaches. In villages and towns it is prefer¬ 
able not to locate schools on main thoroughfares. 

3. It is inadvisable to locate a school near a railroad or 
factory. In this way potential physical dangers, dis¬ 
turbing noises or disagreeable odours are avoided. 

4 . The site should be large enough to provide play area;, 
landscaping, driveways and parking area. The latter

two should be so located that they do not constitute a 
danger to the children in their playground activities. 

Under no condition should a driveway extend from street 
to street because of the danger of its becoming a public 
thoroughfare. 

5. The building should be so located as to provide adequate 
play area of suitable shape and to provide the best poss¬ 
ible lighting for the classrooms. These are more import¬ 
ant than placing the building from the most artistic stand¬ 
point, although this too should receive consideration. 

6. It is advisable in all schools to set aside special play 
area for the primary children, where the small child will 
not run the risk, cf injury because of contact with the 
larger pupils in their vigorous play activities. 

7. Wherever a play area is adjacent to a road or street, 
a durable and strong fence of good height should be 
erected to prevent a child in the excitement of the game 
from dashing into the street to recover a ball. 

2>. In schools where some of the pupils come and go on the 
school buses, safe loading and unloading arneas are a 
necessity. 

Plate 3 

Two One Room Schools 

Plan 1, Plate 3 shows a one room school having separate 
entrances, separate playrooms, and separate cloakrooms for 
boys and girls. The classroom is 23 feet by 30 feet plus the 
cubicle alcove. There are three smaller rooms,—a workroom,

a library and a teacher-group conference room. The school 
is built high above ground level to provide the necessary 
illumination in the basement playrooms. The many steps re¬ 
quired to get to the classroom from the outside are located 
inside the building. Ground level entrances eliminate many 
accidents due to slippery steps because of snow, ice and 
rain during many months of the year. Also in our severe 
climate it is better that the pupil get inside as soon as 
possible and climb steps afterwards. 

The second plan on this plate goes only part way in 
modernization. The reading alcove, the sma.ll separate teachers’ 
room which can be used for group work, the cubicles above 
which is located ta.ckboard and the divided playroom in the 
basement save it from being one of the fairly new but tradit¬ 
ional one room schools found in many parts of Alberta today. 

Plate 4 - 

One Room Rural School 

The one-teacher school should no longer be a. one 
room building. A teacher skilled enough to handle nine grades 
alone, as many do, is skilled enough to keep the pupils 
occupied in more than one room with various kinds of activ¬ 
ities. There must still be the main classroom of ample size, 

23 feet by J>0 feet, plus wardrobes, storage closets, lavoratory- 
washrooms, separate boys’ and girls’ basement playrooms and 
a number of adjunct rooms. Three rooms 10 feet by 12 feet as 
follows would, be ideal: first, a shop-workroom containing 
bench, toolcase and supply cabinet; second, a library-reading

room equipped with a large table, chairs, shelves and a 
magazine rack; third, a combined kitchen-domestic science 
room containing a sewing machine, cooking utensils, cupboard, 
small stove (either oil, gas or electric), and lunch equip¬ 
ment. However, in Plate 4 this floor space has been cut into 
two small rooms. An alternate arrangement for the rear of 
the room could be that shown in the junior room, Plate 6. 

With such rooms and the equipment as described, a capable 
teacher could do excellent work. 

Plate 5 

One Room Rural School 

It has been argued that the long unit simils.r to that 
in Plates 4 and 2> presents in some cases supervisory diffic¬ 
ulties, and for that reason an L-shaped unit has been recommend¬ 
ed. Plate 5 shows such a unit and introduces left rea.r corner 
lighting which has been found successful in a number of new 
schools, among them the Grow Island School, Winnetka, Illin¬ 
ois. (35> Perkins, pp. 33-36). Since the main room has 
30 linear feet of window openings, whose area equals 27 per 
cent of the floor area, it is proposed to eliminate ugly 
wainscotting and high ceiling by using a 10 foot rather than 
a 12 foot ceiling. Plenty of air space is provided by the 
unit for a class of thirty pupils — J>lS cubic feet per pupil. 
Ontario’s G-eneral Regulations ( 17 , p. 4) require 225 cubic 
feet per pupil. Hence this factor need not prevent the lower¬ 
ing of the ceiling. Incidentally this measure reduces heating

costs by one-sixth* The absence of regimented rows of anchored 
desks and the presence of ample light permits freedom of 
arrangement so that table desks can be well lighted in a 
number of places. A corner window seat of 26 feet provides 
an excellent story corner. Storage space is provided under¬ 
neath these seats as well as under the work benches, in the 
teachers’ closet, in the cabinet under the low book counter, 
in the large drawers and bins, and in the sports equipment 
closet in the hall. An interior finish of pine panelling 
or durable fibre-board provides an abundance of tackboard 
area. Separate wardrobe cloak rooms and lavatories as shown 
would be good, for one room rural schools. 

Plate 6 

Two Room School 

. This plate Illustrates a two room school having the 
blackboard wall at an angle of 67 degrees to the window wall* 
Each classroom has wardrobes, generous s'corage accommodations, 
and a workroom. The workroom connected with the senior room 
is equipped for intermediate and Grade X science as well as 
other group activity. The junior room has its library-reading 
group study room while the senior students can use either 
the hall stuciy alcove, or the kitchen for quiet reading and. 
committee work. The bookshelves for the senior room are in 
the classroom itself. The office, 9 test 6 inches square is 
necessary in a two room school and is ample in size. In all 
schools, rural village or town, a kitchen is a necessary acijunct

for the preparation of at least one hot course for tne noon 
lunch. In a small school such as this every small room 
must serve as many purposes as possible; hence the combinetion 
of kitchen and group-study room. Lavatories with well screened 
doors are located adjacent to the entrances. 

Inadequate entrances and exits are the major cause of 
death in school fires in tne United States. (Quarterly of 
the National Fire Protective Association, 35 , p. 170).

Consequently all workroom, classroom and entrance doors should 
open outwards, and all schools should oe amply provided with 
entrances. This two room school has two entrances with storm 
vestibules. In all the proposed building designs of two and- 
three room schools,.the author has planned two entrances, while 
in all schools four rooms or larger there are three or more 
exits in case of fire. Whenever new schools are being built 
and running water is available, sprinkler systems should be 
installed. This ready method of warning and fire fighting 
combined with adequate exits should eliminate the loss of 
any life in school fires in Alberta.

school of Plate 5 applied to a two room building;. The class¬ 
rooms are practically the same except that tne senior room 
has a reading corner, as well as a conference room and a 
science laboratory workroom. The sink in the small kitchen 
is available for the use of either classroom, since its doors 
open in each direction. The corridor is well lighted from 
both ends. It can be noted that tne girls' entrance and 
lavatories are placed on tne junior room side of the school. 
This principle has been carried out in all proposed plans 
so that the small girls do not come in contact with the large 
boys who are unconsciously rough at times. In this school 
wardrobe-cloakrooms are shown. It should be noted, too, 
that the office is centrally located. 

Plate g 

Two Room School 

This is a two room application of northeast, north¬ 
west, and clerestory lighting as described in Chapter VII 
and illustrated in Figures 5 and 6. This plan provides ex¬ 
cellent clerestory lighting for the inside workrooms as well 
as second hand, light from the library-reading rooms by way 
of the intervening partition, which is glazed from a height 
of four feet to the ceiling. A small kitchen, well equipped, 
and a principal's office aj?e provided. Wherever possible 
in a small school it is good practice to locate the office 
adjacent to the principal's classroom. From tne two entrances 
stairs go to the divided basement where toilets, furnace 
room and separate playrooms ajre located. With a full base-

ment each playroom can be 2b feet by *1-1 feet, ample space 
for most group games and activities. 

Plate 9 

Three PlOoiii School 

This three room school is designed for a small Al¬ 
berta village. All rooms have the front blackboard walls 
at an angle to the window wall; thus providing better black¬ 
board lighting. The junior room has a good-sized, bright 
workroom with south windows. Since the reading room is small 
the bookshelves are placed in the rear corner of the room. 

A small amount of tackboard and blackboard in the smaller 
rooms is indicated. These blackboards are necessary for 
written instructions regarding workroom projects. Tackboards 
in library-reading rooms can be made both attractive ana in¬ 
formative. Access to the principal's office can be gained 
from the corridor or from his classroom. The partitions 
between classroom and library, and between library and science 
laboratory are each partly glazed to allow a greater degree 
of effective supervision. The small science room provides 
six square feet of work area, for each of fourteen students 
and a demonstrator’s table. In such a classroom as this, 
which would probably contain Grades IX to XII,there would 
seldom be more than fourteen students taking the same course 
in science. Tne one.room can be used for general science, 
chemistry, physics and biology in tnese grades, as well as for 
general science in the lower grades. Supply cupboards, 
a fume cupboard, and a chemical supply room are provided. 















































- 109 - 


Entrance can also be gained to the kitchen from this room. 

In these proposed schools it is never possible for a 
classroom door to open through ldO degrees into the corri or. 
This would be a dangerous practice since it cuts down effect¬ 
ive corridor width. In these schools classroom doors can 
only swing 90 degrees against either a dead end of a corridor, 
as in Plate 7* or a LI in a door-well, as indical 

for the senior room in Plate 8>. 

An excellent safety measure in small schools naving 
steam or hot water heating systems is the unit ventilation 
system. This method not only provides more efficient ventil¬ 
ation but eliminates the fire hazard of air ducts throughout 
the building. The modern unit of this type, which provides 
ventilation for one classroom only, is under thermostatic 
control. It is superior, also, in that it regulates the 
air in each classroom unit according to particular conditions; 
window exposure and wind direction can thus be taken into 
account. 

Plate 10 

Four P.oom School 

In orientation and general appearance this school, 
like that in Plate 2>, is rather unconventional. The principles 
of lighting governing its orientation have already been dis¬ 
cussed in Chapter VII. This school is designed to accommodate 
four, five, or six classrooms and community activities. Four 
classrooms are shown, while the fifth and sixth can be 
added at the ends of each wing without major structural changes. 









- 111 - 


In plan, these units are similar to those in Plai:e 3. The 
office unit contains a principal's office a jacent t 
classroom, a storage room, and lavatory and coat room for 
the men teachers. This unit is large enou h for a sc..ool 
of this size. The addition of public s>ace, 1 

office, and workroom (shown in Figure 3 ) is desirable in a 
larger school. 

The women teachers 1 room and the health room are com¬ 
bined* This too is provided With coat room and lavatory, 
pantry, sink and counter. Connected to this is the kitchen 
and student lunch room, a necessity in a village school. 

A student union activity room where council meetings may be 
held, records kept and school paper published is also shown. 
This is a room which the students can feel is their own. 

The science laboratory is located between the intermediate 
and high school rooms and is accessible from the corridor 
and from either classroom. 

Inside the front entrance two stairways lead to the 
basement. The staircase at the left lea.ds to the manual 
training and general shop room located under the lunch and 
women teachers’ rooms. Since the shop is located under these 
rooms no classroom can be disturbed by any of the noisier 
shop activities. The domestic science room is located on 
the other side. Except for these two rooms the basement 
under the school proper is unexcavated. _he boiler room 
is at ground level, while the auditorium-gymnasium is, 
as indicated by Section A-A, at basement level. 


Connection 




- 112 - 


is made from the north corner of the auditorium to the dom¬ 
estic science room to facilitate the serving of lunch at 
community evening affairs* This would bo a useful arrangement 
in all community schools. 

Section A-A illustrates the high school room, a storage 
closet, the corridor, and the auditorium- 

The classroom section shows the rear of the room, the indiv¬ 
idual cubicles and shelves, the partially glazed partition, 
the half-glazed door entering the library-reading room, and 
the fluorescent lighting units. The top of the boys' entrance 
door is seen at the end of the corridor. The auditorium 
section shows the stage opening, doors under the stage to. 
storage space, and the door leading to the stage. 

The boys' and girls' lavatories illustrate a. sound 
principle regarding lavatory entrances. Two doors sj?e pro¬ 
vided for each room, one opening in and one opening out. 

In addition the entrances are so placed that no view of the 
interior can be obtained from the corridor. This latter 
principle has been carried out in almost all cases through¬ 
out this work. An effective modern trend is the use of 
mechanical blow driers, thus eliminating the use of paper 
towels and the resulting untidy mess on the floor near the 
wast paper container. In locating lava.tories, it is advis¬ 
able that they should be a s near as possible to entrances 
and play areas. 

The proposed plan on this plate provides two playrooms, 
each 23 feet by 4-0 feet. They are separated by folding doors, 
which lA/hen opened form an auditorium-gymnasium 4-0 feet by 



- 113 - 


4-6 feet. Thesi l 3 rooms not only provide play space f 
use during wet or cold days but also much needed accommodation 
for physical education in all the grades. Classes for boys 
and girls can be carried on at the same time, thus simplify¬ 
ing time-table structure. Separate entrances are provided 
for each playroom. 

Some general remarks regarding the provision of 
auditorium-gy$nasium-playrooms seem pertinent at this point. 
Because of the expense involved, it would be impractical 
to provide a separate auditorium and gymnasium in the smaller 
schools herein considered, yet these facilities are deemed 
essential for modern education. However, where the facilities 
are unified and made available to the community as well as 
to the school, they become factors of high rather than of 
low utilisation. Moreover, this combination of facilities 
is quite practical, since a sloping floor is not required 
in a small auditorium. However, it is recognised that in 
larger schools a dual purpose room is not practical, owing 
to the larger number of extra-curricular activities and the 
continuous conflict, between,groups wanting the stage, and 
groups wanting the gymnasium. Where the combination of 
gymnasium and auditorium i£ attempted, it is advisable to 
have the auditorium-gymnasium as a separate unit connected 
to the main building by means of a corridor. Thus noise 
from physical education classes will not disturb other rooms, 
while for community use only one section of the school need 
be opened. If the room is to be converted from gymnasium to 
auditorium, and motion or still pictures are to be shown, 










- 114 - 


detachable hangings of some heavy dark material should De 
provided for the windows. 

Plate 11 
Five Room School 

This plate shows a five room school of the familiar 
K-pattern. Unlike many schools of this pattern, however, 
no c lassrooms depend on light from either north or south 
windows. The south light is suitable, however, for the office, 
science laboratory, and library. The large south bay window 
in the science room makes an excellent place to observe and 
experiment with plant life. The north light is used for the 
auditorium-gymnasium at the back of the school. This room 
(60 feet by ^0 feet) is divided into two playrooms. In each 
is a.window of clear glass which can be opened, and in add¬ 
ition a fourteen-foot section of the outside wall consists of 
glass blocks. G-ls.ss bridk windows of the same size are re¬ 
peated in the partition between the auditorium and corridor. 

The girls’ playroom is close to their lavatory and to the 
stairway to the basement where their showers are located. 

The same is true of the boys' playroom. 

The primary c3_assroom is isolated from the rest of 
the school. These small pupils have a separate entrance 
from their own playgrotind and a separate lavatory. The 
fixtures should of course be suitable in size for primary 
pupils. Separate toilet rooms adjacent to the classroom 
for younger pupils allow for more effective supervision by

tlie classroom teacher. They not only conserve time by elim¬ 
inating the long and often slow trip down the corridor just 
for something* to do, but also segregate the young children 
from the possible bad influence of older pupils. Moreover 
they offer a closer approximation to residential conditions. 
Isolation of the primary unit allows the younger upils to 
become gradually accustomed to institution life. Tnelr own 
entrance eliminates the possioility of accidents as a result 
of bigger boys*“horseplay”. This classroom unit das a library¬ 
reading room to the front, a good-sized workroom and playroom, 
and a well-lit alcove at the rear. The whole unit is very 
light and only requires light control in tne from of Venetian 
blinds on the east side. The good quality inlaid linoleum 
floor has an alphabet circle. Inlaid linoleum of different 
colours forming borders, pattern?, 2 me lines, and elementary 
number concepts are particularly adaptable to a primary floor. 

Incidentally, new flooring materials such as linoleum, 
asphalt tile, and rubber tile are recommended for use through¬ 
out this entire school. They are less noisy than wooden 
flooring, more resilient, longer wearing, and more economical, 
for cleaning and maintenance. These new materials allow for 
impressive and artistic designs in entrance nails, corridors, 
and principal’s office, and 1 1 individual character 

to each classroom. The lavatories ana shower rooms should 
have terrs.zzo or burned tile flooring because of tneir suit¬ 


ability for this purpose. However, in the auditorium-gymnasium 
good quality heavy hardwood flooring is pro Dandy still the best 



r

- 117 - 


for the varied activities of play, ;ymnastics, 1 
badminton and dancing. 

The other four classroom units in this school are each 
provided with two small rooms in addition to the cl;. ■ room 
proper. All rooms are equipped with cubicles, built-in ward¬ 
robes, drawers, st ce, tilted blackboard^ and ample 

tackboard area. 

The central part of the school is the only section 
of more than one floor. It extends the full width of the 
school over classroom, auditorium, stage, and lunchroom. 

Thus it is possible for tne auditorium to receive light by 
means of clerestory glass block windows facing south. 

The building is designed so that future additions 
may be added if necessary. One room can be built to the 
north of the Division III room, and one above it. The stair¬ 
way leading from the corridor near the boys' entrance up 
to the community room and gallery is quite wide enough to 
s-dcommodate the extra traffic. The addition of this class¬ 
room above the Division III room would not detract from the 
general appearance of the building, since it would be behind 
the high central portion of the building.

equipped with a fireplace on either side of which are low 
open-shelf bookcases, and plenty of storage space. Tne unit 
is also equipped with a separate entrance and lavatory for 
the small children. Room 2, Grades III and IV, has a larger 
workroom and a smaller library-reading alcove. Rooms 3 , 4 , 5 , 

6 and g all have two small auxiliary rooms to be used for 
whatever purposes are suitaole to the grade. The rooms used 
as workrooms in the elementary and intermediate grades will 
in the higher grades probably be used more for group study 
and conferences. Room 7 bas a stage, 10 feet 6 inches by 
l6 feet instead of the second small room. This high school 
room is the one designed more particularly for the teaching 
of Dramatics, English and Social Studies. Much of the regular 
classwork in Dramatics will be more effective when a small 
stage is at hand; so,too, will panel discussions and short 
deDates in social science. To turn the small tables and 
chairs around when attention is directed to the stage is but 
the work of a moment. The location of a reading table or 
two on the stage will increase its utility so that it can 
also be used during other periods. 

For the pupils of the seven rooms other than the prim¬ 
ary room, there are four entrances, one at each end of the 
main corridor, and one on each side of the auditorium corr¬ 
idors. In case of fire there is, in addition, the front 
entrance and the emergency exit at the rear of the auditorium. 
Note the steps at either end of the corridor. They extend 
the full width (eleven feet).. , but are divided into three 





- 120 - 


sections by using two banisters. The glass Diock walls from 
floor to ceiling at the ends of the corridor provide excellent 
diffused lighting. 

The basement is unexcavated except for the mechanical 
room, the manual training and general shop room, and the 
domestic science room. The latter two rooms are each much 
larger than the classroom units on the main floor. In a 
school of this size these shops should be in use two full 
days per week, a half day each for llanual Training VII and 
VIII, llanual Training IX, General Shop X, General Shop XI, 
and the corresponding courses for the girls. The facilities 
should also be used to a certain extent in the evening in 
a town wide awake to the possibilities of a community school. 
One of the be,st solutions to the problem of properly trained 
instructors for these technical' subjects is the itinerant 
teacher employed by a number of adjacent towns and villages. 

The central part of the school, main floor, basement 
and second floor, is as much for community use as for school 
use. The fire-doors across the main corridor on either side 
of the foyer cut off entirely seven of the eight classrooms. 

In this way the central area is segregated for evening use. 

One classroom, Room is available for evening classes. 

The office suite is located to the right of the main entrance, 
while on the left is the school-community library served to 
a certain extent by a trained librarian travelling the sarnie 
circuit of towns as the shop and domestic science teachers. 

The auditorium-gymnasium with its folding doors will,, for a 





- 121 - 

great part of the time, be divided, into two playrooms for 
play and physical education in cold or wet weather. Shower 
rooms are provided close to each playroom. The auditorium 
is built at ground level and is providect with ample lighting 
from from high windows on either side. To reach the stage, 
steps lead from the corridors at auditorium level to the 
classroom level. Entrances to the stage are located at both 
sides. Incidentally, the floor on the stage should be of 
soft wood to enable the use of screws for scenery. 

A stairway with wrought iron banister leads from the 
foyer to the upper floor. Here is located the women teachers’ 
restroom, coat room and lavatory, combined with the health 
inspection room and community social room. There is also 
a small kitchen alcove and a storage room where folding chairs 
may be stored. Here some of the teachers may eat their noon 
lunch; here the doctor and nurse will make their periodic 
examinations of the pupils; and here also small community 
groups will meet for lectures, discussions, and club and ser¬ 
vice organiza-tion meetings. For some activities of this nature 
such as Scouts or C. Gr. I. T. , the students’ lunchroom and 
the students’ council room, also located in this central 
block can be used. On the whole, this school has been de¬ 
signed to give the maximum in service to both school and 
community. 


Some may s.rgue that such a school plant is too expensive 
The author is not, it is true, advocating cheap schools for 
either the rural community, the village, or the small town 





- 122 - 


in Alberta. He is advocating, and believes he has shown in 
plan good schools, well designed and suitable not only to 
our program of studies for school children but also the post¬ 
school section of our Alberta society. Considering the ex¬ 
treme importance of the educational task, the expense is not 
too great and the funds will be forthcoming once its import¬ 
ance is realized. It is well to remember also that the 
multiple use of the buildings for both school and community 
reduces what at first seems to be too great an expenditure. 

If there is to be a community at all, it is one duty of comm¬ 
unity, province and dominion to provide the best possible 
community-school for the use of its primary asset—its children 
its young people and its adults.

It is hoped, that a planful attach upon this vital

curing better physical facilities for the newer educational 
practices which they are endeavoring to carry forward.

Letter Accompanying Questionnaires to Divisional Superintendents

Edmonton, Alberta, 
February 27 , 1942. 


TO DIVISIONAL SUPERINTENDENTS: 

Some of you are already acquainted with the pro¬ 
ject I have in hand. For the benefit of the others, 

I am endeavoring to estimate the suitability of present 
Alberta school structures for the newer educational pro¬ 
cedures currently recommended to teachers and school 
authorities. I believe that this question of the relation¬ 
ship between school buildings and educational programs 
is vital to the improvement of teaching practices in 
Alberta today. 

The resulting Master’s thesis will be confined 
to schools of eight rooms and less in town, village, 
and rural areas. In this group are found 7 5f° of the 
teachers of the province and 65 $ of the pupils. 

The first questionnaire is being answered by 
teachers from widely scattered points of the province. 

The second one is printed below. I would greatly apprec¬ 
iate your assistance in,carrying forward tnis enquiry 
through the careful completion of the following quest¬ 
ionnaire. 

In anticipation of sn early reply, preferably 
before March Ilth, and of your wholehearted co-operation, 

I thank you. 


Yours very truly, 


F. B. Facey
