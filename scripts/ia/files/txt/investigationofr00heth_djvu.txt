A large nu ber of investigators have made 
easurements on the het&-ray spectrum of hat* The 
majority of these investigations were carried out 
to ascer tain the end-point energy and the * ost 
probable energy of the spectrum* 

Investigation of the low energy end (0-60 hev.) 
of the spectrum was not attempted until 1&34 when 
H*0*h. Richardson (1) made measurements of the 
range cf the low energy rays using a Wilson 
Cloud Chamber i and converted thee# ranges to 
energies* He used a Bah source deposited on gold 
and silver leaves. The source was centrally 
placed in the chamber and stereoscopic photographs 
were "taken of toe tracks t using a double camera 
arrangement* 

His results showed a surprisingly large 
number of low energy tracks f which exhibited a 
broad maximum between 15-30 hev. and a higher one 
at approximately uS hev*(Flat© 1). The maximum 
at approximately 55 Kev. mas higher than that 
between 200-400 hev. predicted by toe existing

Richardson discarded the apparent excess of 
particle*? in the region less than 15 Key. a3 being 
due to back scattering from the source support# 

This left unexplained however 9 the surprising 
number above 15 Kev. and : to the 30 dev. peak, 
and this behavior is in disagreement with theory. 

In 1934 Ferri published his theory of beta- 
disintegration (3). This theory was based on ti e 
assumption that beta-decay took place according 
to the nuclear reaction.

F(E) = S 0 ~ 1 


Hence the plot should give a straight line, 
cutting the E-axis at E a which gives the end¬ 
point energy* 

The experimental data did not support the 
Fermi theory at this time*(Plate 4). The thick 
target curve is typical of the experimental 
evidence which lead Konopinski and Uhlenbeck to 
introduce their alternative theory (8)* iy a 
modification to the Fermi theory they obtained 
the result that

line portion was accidental* Also from the mass 
iiffereaaee# of nuclei the values of sy Hie 
f. U« theory were such too high in all cases but 
that those given by tire Perui theory agreed with 
the measured mass difference* 

In liSt a* Flamers ted (8) investigated the 
effects of heavy source supports by mean# of a 
speetrogruph and Geiger Pibller counter* lie found 
that heavy source supports gave a large amount 
of back-scattering and hence a false tmximm

lie obtained a complete energy spectrum which he 
plotted by the Kurle method for both the Ferial 
and h* U* theory* (Plate €)* ihe high extrapolated

^ore recently Taltrer..and Angers (9) and (10)

(Flute ?}• Aaltrier and Rogers used a RaE source

additional evidence.

place before full compression has occurred* This 
is done by regulating the' length of the timing

table top, and used to vi£w the tracks (Plate II ). 
The bakelite was fastened to a steel hemisphere 
which fits into a machined bowl, with an 
electrorragnet in the middle that makes close 
contact with the hemisphere* Hie electromagnet 
clamx s the hemisphere solidly at any angle* The 
table was limited to a ten degree tilt by means 
of an adjustable co!3.ar on the hemisphere* This 
limiting angle was calculated using the boundaries 
of the illumination at the Incite walls as

made the 3ame as the lens to source distance in 
the chamber* The developed film was replaced in the 
camera in the same position that it occupied 
when the photographs were taken and the tracks 
reprojected on to the white table top, by means 
ox tne projector lamp. (Mate ±1). The source 
image was placed centrally on the levelled table 
top and the three views made to coincide as each 
frame was brought under the lamp* ly tilting the 
table tii© three photographs of a given track 
could be made to coincide over most of the track 
length. Since care was taken to assure that the 
camera lens was not touched, the track image so 
obtained was a very close approximation to the 
original track in the cloud chamber. The track 
range was then measured by means of a divider.If 
the track, was curved the divider was set at about 
three millimeters and the track length stepped off. 
The divider spacing was determined by the amount 
of curvature px^esent. 'die tilting table was 
limited to a 10 degree tilt. Thus all tracks 
measured were within a.10 degree solid angle, which

was just within the defined edges of the beam at 
tx.e iucite walls. (Plate 13). Without this lirait 
on the tilting angle a much larger solid angle 
was available to short tracks near the source (a 
and b Plate 13) but the longer tracks were still 
limited to this 10 degree solid angle by the 
boundaries of the light beam, (c Plate 13). This 
assisted in getting a more representative cross 
section of the spectrum. If a track appeared to 
end but the three photographs could not be made 
to coincide, the track was discarded. A weight 
between 1-5 was assigned to each track, depending 
on the clarity of origin and ending. The tracks in 
each frame were numbered, starting at one side of 
the source and going in a clock-wise direction. 
(Plate 14). This assisted in re-checking the 
measured tracks in the projector or on the tilting 
table. For the method of numbering the track® see 
(Plate14). All the tracks in each frame, except 
those considered as old tracks, were counted and 
recorded, which gave a norraalizing factor,to use 
in combining the distributions from the various

Flates 2/ to 24 show the low energy tracks 
in tiie various gases and give an idea of the 
weighting process* After ail the tracks of one 
roll were measured they were re-examined in a 
projector where each of the three stereoscopic 
views could he examined separately* In this way 
an additional check on the certainty of origin 
and ending of the tracks was obtained* 

The measured ranges were converted to 
energies using the two formulae: 

(1) E = 24330 ( n, K ) 2 * when hydrogen was

used*(Thompson-khidding ton relation) 

(2) S = 2460Q( ft, B ) 0 * 55 for the remaining 

mixtures as the stopping power was due 
roainly to oxygen. (Williams) (14).

From p ail 5, corrected for RaD, a half lift 
of 5*1 days was calculated for the decaying 
substance. This agrees well with tiie accepted 
value for BaB of 5#0 days«(2) 

The distributions for the various gases and 
mixtures as calculated were plotted on graph 1. 
Then the distribution of each gas was raised to 
make it equivalent to 1250 disintegration, (the 
number of disintegrations counted in the oxygen 
series), and the resulting frequency distribution 
was plotted, (graph 2). The rraximum occurring 
between 15-20 Kev. is quite evident, but the peak 
at 65 Kev., reported by i&chardaon (1) was not 
found. 

The distributions as given by the Fermi and 
K. U. theories were calculated and normalized 
using the total number of measurable tracks as 
representing the coi^plete BaE spectrum. These 
results along with the observed data, corrected 
for tie presence of FaD and branching, were 
plotted (graph S), and indicate the relative

The low energy particles may be due to one 
or more of several effects,namely: 

1) rackscattering from the source

2) The presence of PaD* These would 
only appeal* in the range 0-25 Kev. since the 
ma;d.ffium energy of HaD beta particles is 25 Kev. 

3) Branching. is effect would only 
be unnoticed in a small volume surrounding the

For a distance cf 0*5 cm. on either side of 
the source no track droplets were formed because 
in this region the expansion is not adiabatic* 

Lew energy branch tracks formed in this region

Preparation of vinylite i'll ms for source supports, 

A solution of 250 nqg. of vinylite with 10 c. c. 
of pure chloroform was prepared using vinylite 
discs obtained from la*. . orrison of the Department 
of Chemistry* A 1000 ml. beaker was carefully 
cleaned with KNO 3 and filled to within of the 
top with distilled water* Then by using a fine 
tipped eye dropper the solution of vinylite and 
chloroform was placed on the top of the water one 
drop at a time. A thin layer spread out over the 
surface, and when the chloroform evaporated a 
thin vinylite film was obtained* The thickness 
and uniformity of the film was determined by the 
interference of the reflected light* The desired 
thickness of film could be obtained by adding 
either more chloroform or vinylite to the 
solution* when a film of desired thickness and 
uniformity was obtained it was lifted off on the 
support described under Apparatus* Three source 
supports were prepared at one time in case of 
later breakage* The film used in these 
experiments r as C.> u thick*
