INTRODUCTION 


While the medicinal properties of cod liver oil had 
been known for centuries, it was not until 1914 that Osborne 
and Mendel (1) demonstrated the presence therein of a growth- 
promoting, anti-xerophthalmic factor - vitamin A. In 1922 
McCollum (2) established the separate identity of a second 
fat-like factor in cod liver oil - the anti-rachitic vitamin D. 

Today the cod liver oil industry is an important 
one* The geographical source of cod liver oil does not un¬ 
failingly determine its vitamin potency. Variations in methods 
of fishing, refining, storage and handling also contribute to 
the character of the finished product* Newfoundland and Norway 
are the two principal sources of the oil used in this country. 

For many years the belief has prevailed, particularly amongst 
British pharmaceutical houses, that Norwegian cod liver oil 
was superior to the Newfoundland, but Drummond (3) of the 
University of London, in 1930 showed that the latter product 
was generally the richer source of vitamin A. 

Cod liver oil, as defined in the British Pharm¬ 
acopoeia (4) isj- 

"The fixed oil, expressed from the fresh liver of the 
cod, (Gadus morrhua, Linn.) and freed from solid fat by filtration 
at about 0° • ** 

The British Pharmacopoeia (1932) and other standards give 
minimum and maximum values for the physical and chemical 






2 


characteristics of cod liver oil. The League of Nations 
Health Organization meeting in London in 1931 (6) and 
1934 (7), outlined a method for the determination of vitamins 
A and D and also defined the units of each. 

The International Unit of Vitamin A is defined as, 
the vitamin A activity of 0.6 micrograms (0.6*6 ) of pure 
£ carotene. 

Daily doses of 2 to 4 International units of 
vitamin A, when administered to young rats, suitably prepared 
on a vitamin A deficient diet, have been found adequate to 
restore growth; somewhat larger doses are required for the 
cure of xerophthalmia. 

One International unit of vitamin D is equivalent 
to 1 mg. of a solution of calciferol (vitamin D) in olive oil 
which contains 0.025 micrograms (0.025^ ) crystalline calciferol. 

The United States Revision Interim (5), in an attempt to 

eliminate low grade oil, fixed the minimum value for vitamin A 

(600 units) and for vitamin D (85 units)• 

Vitamin A is much less stable than vitamin D, and 
is more likely to be destroyed by methods of preparation and 
storage requiring heat or permitting oxidation. Hence there is 
no constant relationship between the vitamin A and D contents 
of commercial samples of cod liver oil. Various methods are 
employed to preserve vitamin A. Drummond (3) pointed out that 
the use of inert gases, such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide, to 
replace the air in containers used for transport and storage 
of cod liver oil, in order to protect against oxidation, was 
of little use. However, he considered that certain simple 
precautions should be taken. In filling the containers with 
cod liver oil, as small an air space as is practicable should 
be left. To prevent the action of light, cod liver oil should 






- 3 - 


not be "put up" in white glass bottles, but in bottles of a 
dark amber color. 

It is the common practice of wholesalers and 
retailers to purchase large quantities of oil in bulk and 
to repack smaller quantities in clear glass bottles as 
required. It is very probable that marked deterioration of 
the oil results from the continued exposure of the reserve 
supply to the air and that photochemical destruction of 
vitamin A takes place during the period that the bottles 
stand on the shelves in a warm room. 

PURPOSE OF INVESTICATION 

Drummond (3) has stated that "at the present time 
a considerable portion of the cod liver oil sold in England 
is relatively low in medicinal value. In some cases these oils 
are sold with a guarantee of vitamin activity that is virtually 
worthless, as the figure or Units’ given are often based on 
unreliable methods of testing". It was with these facts in 
mind that we undertook to investigate the relative purity and 
quality of various medicinal cod liver oils sold by different 
drug stores throughout the City of Edmonton and district 
during the winter season of 1934-35. 

Various samples were purchased on the local market. 
The information on the labels was recorded. A large number 




4 - 


of the samples were labelled simply "Cod liver Oil", with the 
retail pharmacists name. Usually there was no vitamin A or D 
potency stipulated, but often a statement to the effect that 
the source was either Newfoundland or Norway. It was also noted 
that a few pharmaceutical houses expressed the vitamin content 
in the units which were most impressive to the public, in spite 
of the fact that the units of vitamin A and D have been defined 
by the league of Nations Health Organization (7). The purchaser 
has therefore no means of knowing whether a given sample of 
cod liver oil is above or below average vitamin potency. 

As this study progressed, it was decided to include 
cod liver oils of poultry and cattle grade. It was hoped that 
the results would indicate their relative value as supplementary 
feeding stuffs. 

The source and other particulars regarding the oils 
which comprised this study are given in Table 1. 


the physical and chemical characteristics of cod liver oil 


The free acidity, saponification value, iodine 
number, specific gravity and refractive index of each of the 
oils, and the amount of unsaponifiable matter in a few of the 
oils was determined by the standard methods of the British 
Pharmacopoeia (1932)• 

The values obtained were always within the range 
given for cod liver oil by a number of standards. It was,

therefore, considered unnecessary to record herein the detailed 
results. The results summarized in Table 11, include only the 
maximum, minimum and mean values. 

COMMENTS ON RESULTS 

It is obvious from Table 11, that the physical and 
chemical characteristics of the medicinal cod liver oils, meet 
the requirements of the British Pharmacopoeia (4) and the 
United States pharmacopoeia X (5). None of these oils was 
adulterated. It is the practice of some manufacturers to 
increase the vitamin content of cod liver oil by adding the 
unsaponifiable fraction prepared from other fish oils. One 
of these oils, (117A), was advertised as vitamin fortified 
and accordingly was found to have slightly more unsaponifiable 
material. 

The acid values of the medicinal oils were 
determined shortly after purchasing and again about six months 
later. It was found that in some cases the results were 
actually lower after storage of the oil. Drummond (3) has 
made a similar observation. 

The percentage of free fatty acid was found to be 
generally less than 0.5 but a few oils gave slightly, though 
not significantly, higher values. Drummond (3) states that, 
T, with very little trouble it is a simple matter to prepare 
oils with free fatty acidities as low as 0.05 to 0.1% (oleic 
acid). There is no excuse for the production of medicinal oils 






- 6 - 


with values higher than 0*5 fo. Such figures mean carelessness 
and dirty methods”. 

Of the crude cod liver oils, three were found to 
contain less than 1 f> free fatty acid. Drummond (3) has also 
pointed out that poultry oils can be prepared with less than 
Ifo free fatty acid. The Feeding Stuffs Act of Canada does not 
provide any standard for the free fatty acid content of poultry 
and cattle grade oils. 

The four pilchard oils examined all contained less 
than Ifo free fatty acid. 

The manufacturer of cod liver oils adds to the 
low grade cattle feed oil varying amounts of the stearin 
fraction chilled out of the medicinal oil. This fraction 
contains a considerable quantity of vitamin D. It is not 
unexpected, therefore, that the saponification value, 
iodine number etc. of these oils as shown in Table 11, are 
subject to variations outside the limits of medicinal oils.

THE DETERMINATION OF VITAMIN A 

A number of methods for estimating vitamin A 
have been proposed# The procedures outlined below are applied 
either to the oil itself, or to the unsaponifiable fraction 
prepared from the oil. 

1. BIOLOGICAL ASSAY - rat units. 

11. COLORIMETRIC METHODS:- 

(a) Carr and Price Method (8) - measurement 
of the intensity of the blue color produced by interaction 
of vitamin A and antimony trichloride -blue units. 

(b) Rosenthal Test (9) - modification of the 
Carr and Price reaction using catechol and antimony trichloride 
and measuring the intensity of the violet-red color produced. 

111. SPECTROMETRIC METHODS:- 

(a) Direct measurement of the ultra-violet 
absorption of the oil or unsaponifiable fraction therefrom - 
E 328mu (extinction co-efficient) values. 

(b) Measurement of the intensity of the two 
absorption bands (572mu and 606mu) of the antimony trichloride 
blue color. 

(c) Measurement of the intensity of the ab¬ 
sorption at 54-5mu and 475mu of the violet-red color produced 
by a modified Rosenthal reaction substituting guaiacol for 
catechol (10). 

In the present investigation the antimony trichloride 
test and the ultra-violet absorption spectra were used. These

two methods alone will be considered. 

the carr-price method 

REAGENTS 

Oil Solvent - chloroform according to B.P. 
containing 2% alcohol. 

Antimony Trichloride Solution - 30 gms. SbClg 
in anhydrous chloroform. The suspension is allowed to stand 
and the clear solution decanted and measured from a burette. 

PROCEDURE 


The colorimetry is carried out with a lovibond 
Tintometer. A glass cell, 1cm. thick, containing 0.2 ml. of 
the chloroform solution of the oil, is placed in position in 
the tintometer and 2.0 ml. of the reagent are rapidly added. 
The blue color develops to a maximum in from 10 to 30 seconds, 
then commences to fade. The color is quickly matched with the 
tintometer glasses. On account of the instability of the color 
it is necessary to carry out at least three determinations to 
obtain dependable values. 

The concentration of the solution of the oil is 
adjusted so that the color measured lies between the limits 
of 4.0 and 6.0 blue, and preferably between 4.8 and 5.2 on the 











Lovibond scale* As the color produced on mixing the cod 
liver oil solution with the antimony trichloride reagent 
is not always a pure blue, it is frequently necessary to use 
red and yellow glasses in addition to the blue, in order to 
obtain a perfect color match, but in the recording of the 
results, the blue units only are taken into account. 

The standard concentration is 0.04 gm. oil in 
0.2 ml. chloroform (i.e. 20 fi> solution) and from the readings 
obtained all results are thus expressed on this basis, known 
as the "Carr-Price Value". 


DISCUSSION 


Carr-Price values in duplicate for sixteen samples 
of medicinal cod liver oils are recorded in Table 111, from 
which it is seen that the vitamin A content of these oils, thus 
expressed varies from 4.8 to 84. A comparison of these values 
with those obtained on the same oils by the spectrographic 
method is obtainable by an examination of Chart 1 (page 16). 

THE SPECTROPHO TOMETRIC METHOD 

Heilbron and Morton (11) in 1928 observe d that 
highly purified concentrates of vitamin A showed an absorption 
band in the ultra-violet region of the spectrum with a maximum 
at 328mu. The same absorption curve was obtained with many 
samples of cod liver oil. The curve shown in Fig. 1, is that

obtained by the method to be described on the U.S.P. Reference 
Cod Liver Oil. 

That there is a direct correlation between the 
vitamin A content of cod liver oil as determined by the rat 
assay and by intensity of absorption at 328mu is evident from 
the work of many investigators, particularly Drummond and 
Morton (12); chevallier and Chabre (13); Coward, Dyer, Morgan 
and Gaddum (14); Gillam and Morton (15). 

The vitamin Standardization Conference (7), in 
adopting the spectrophotometrie method as a standard, stated that, 

" within eertain defined conditions, measurements of the co¬ 
efficient of absorption (E) at 328mu affords a reliable method 

for measuring the vitamin A content of liver oils, and concentrates. 

flfo 

To convert the values obtained for Eyi cm. 328mu into a figure 
representing the International Units of Vitamin per gramme of 
the material examined, the factor 1600 is recommended for 
adoption"• 

The arbitrary factor, 1600, is the extinction 
co-efficient (E) of the purest concentrate of vitamin A yet 
prepared. (Carr and Jewell (16) ). 

Under "certain defined conditions" it was under¬ 
stood that the measurements be made on the unsaponifiable 
fraction prepared according to the method outlined in the 
report (7). In the original paper on this subject, Heilbron 
and Morton (11) had pointed out that absorption measurements 
on many fish liver oils did not always give a complete curve 
as shown in Fig. 1, but absorption only in the region of 328mu. 




c 



11 - 


At wave lengths shorter than 328mu, it was assumed that in 
such cases the typical absorption of the vitamin was masked by 
the presence of free fatty acids, or other material removed by 
the preparation of an unsaponifiable fraction. From more recent 
work, Notevarp (17) considers the preparation of the unsaponifiable 
fraction unnecessary in the case of medicinal oils and even with 
crude oils, saponification is only advised where a high degree 
of accuracy is desired. The vitamin assay is carried out with¬ 
out regard to the absorption at regions other than 328mu. 

APPARATUS 


A Bellingham and Stanley quartz spectrograph 
fitted with a rotating sector photometer mounted directly on 
the instrument, was used. The light source is a condensed spark 
between tungsten steel electrodes 4 mm. apart, obtained from 
A.C. mains by the use of a transformer and a condenser yielding 
a voltage of 10,000. 

In front of the photometer are mounted two 1 cm. 
cells with quartz ends, one for the solution and one for the 
solvent. The light from the spark, after passing through these, 
is refracted by a suitable arrangement of prisms to produce two 
spectra which are recorded alongside each other on a photographic 
plate. 

Behind each cell is a rotating circle with two 90° 
sectors cut from each. The circle behind the solvent cell is 
adjustable and sector openings of 90° - o° 


are obtained 



























. 


* 




by moving the shutter with a scale. The 90° openings are sub¬ 
divided into 100 divisions reading directly in densities, that iss- 

log Intensity of Incident light (I) 

Intensity of Transmitted light (l 0 ) 

The sector opening is varied with the time of exposure in such a 

manner that the series of photographs through the solvent are of 

approximately equal intensity, whilst those through the solution 

of the oil in the other cell with fixed sectors vary with the 

exposure* A quantitative means of matching the density of the 

photographic images is thus obtainable* The circles carrying the 

sectors are rotated at a speed of about 80 revolutions per minute, 

by a small motor* 

ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY OF COD LITER OIL 

The first determination was made on the Reference 
Cod Liver Oil obtained from the U.S.P. Revisions Committee. This 
oil has been biologically standardized by numerous laboratories 
in the United States and in England and found to contain 3000 
International Units* 

A 2°/o solution of this oil in absolute alcohol 
(2 gm. in 100 ml.) was prepared. In order to determine a suitable 
strength of solution for spectrographic measurement, a series 
of photographs was taken with, of course, the photometer and cells 
removed, through different thicknesses of the solution obtained 
by means of a special Baly tube, in the manner suggested in 
Table IV. From this plate (Fig. 2) the required concentration was 


calculated

Tig. 2 















Faint transmission at the head of the band (328mu) 


was obtained with a depth of *2 ems. Since a layer 1 cm, thick was 
to be used with the photometer, the solution had to be diluted 
five times, and as a 2 u ,b solution was used in the 3aly tube, a 
0.4^o solution was used with the photometer. 

The Baly tube was then replaced by the photometer. 

The two photometer cells were filled with the solvent and the 
first exposure made. The solvent, in the cell in front of the 
non-adJustable sector openingjWas then replaced by the solution 
and a series of photographs taken, with increasing exposures, 
and correspondingly decreasing sector openings behind the solvent 
cell, in the manner already indicated and illustrated by Table V. 
The last photograph taken on the plate is another control, with 
solvent in both cells and sectors in both circles fully open. 

In such controls, the density of the spectrograms should be a 
match throughout; a condition obtainable only when everything 
is set in perfect adjustment. The position of the spark, as 
regards height and horizontal relationship to the slit, is of 
special importance in this regard. The plate-holder is moved on a 
scale with fifteen divisions, so that each pair of photographs 
is accurately placed on the developed plate. 

The plate which is now developed, fixed and dried, 
is examined against a suitable background. If the top and 
bottom pairs of controls match, then differences in the 
intervening pairs are valid. The image from the solvent cell 
(and adjustable sector) does not remain quite constant, but 



fades slightly throughout, but uniformly from the long to the 

short wave length end. The image from the solution cell, may 

appear only towards the long wave end of the plate in the 

first photograph with the short exposure - all the shorter 

waves being absorbed. Or in the case of the cod liver oil 

the image is faintest in the region of 328mu. As the exposure 

is increased (with the constant sector), the image becomes 

more intense# With suitable dilutions and exposures a negative 

(of which Fig.3 is an example of the positive) is obtained 

with adjacent spectral images of the same intensity at certain 

points# Thus a curve, such as Fig# 1 is constructed. In the 

vitamin A assay however, it is necessary to examine the 

adjacent spectral images only at the position 328mu. When the 

intensity of the image of the solvent and solution is equal, 

at this wave length, the sector opening corresponding to this 

photograph is noted, and from the concentration of the oil 

in the solution, the extinction co-efficient is calculable. 

In the case of the Reference Cod Liver Oil Fig. 1, 

for example, there was a match at 328mu when the sector opening 

was 20. The extinction co-efficient is therefore:- 
f.4$ 100 

E (jL cm. = log 20 " .6990 

f¥ io 

Thus E (l cm. * .6990 X 4 = 1.75, which multipled by 

the arbitrary factor (1600) gives 2800 I.U. of vitamin A. 

The above method was used to determine the vitamin 
A content of a number of medicinal cod liver oils, and a few 


other medicinal fish oils. Some determinations were carried out

on the unsaponifiable fraction prepared according to the method 
outlined by the league of Nations Health Organization (7). 

The values for vitamin A expressed as International Units 
on a variety of oils are recorded in Table VI 


DISCUSSION 


In the same class of oils great variations in vitamin 
A content, ARE seen from Table VI* It will be observed,where the 
determination has been made on the unsaponifiable fraction, that 
in all cases there is a reduction in the number of units of vitamin 
A* The reduction is not constant but varies from 8-28 G /o. Where the 
unsaponifiable fraction of the oil has not been analyzed, the 
results can only be taken as representing maximum values. At 
least half of the oils examined are of relatively low vitamin A 
potency* It is of interest to note that the poor oils are in¬ 
variably those which have been bottled by the local pharmacist 
from bulk oil. 

In Table Vll we have compared our results with a 
few assays advertised by the manufacturer. In the case of oils 
111A and 124 A , the actual vitamin A content is markedly lower 
than that stated on the container. On the other hand, the 
manufacturer of oil 130A is apparently unaware of the value of 
his product. 

Our analysis of the Reference Cod Liver Oil 
(2554 I.U*) is 446 I*U* below the biological value. This 
result is however, in p^f e e - t agreement with that of Morgan,

Extinction Co-efficient 

Oil Unsaponifiable Fraction 

Morgan et al. 1.74 1.58 

Writer 1.75 1.596 

These workers consider that this discrepancy indicates either 

that the factor 1600 for converting the extinction co-efficient 

into International Units is incorrect or that some substance is 

present in this oil which is biologically active as vitamin A 

and does not absorb at 328mu. 

Vitamin A determinations on fifteen oils, expressed 
as Carr-Price values, taken from Table 111, and as International 
Units obtained spectrographically and taken from Table VI, are 
plotted on Chart 1, using 1 cm. on the ordinates for each oil. It 
will be seen that with two exceptions (100A and 101A), the values 
obtained by the spectrographic method are higher than those of the 
Carr-Price method. There is no constant difference between the 
two values. A greater difference appears to be common with the 
better oils. 

On other evidence, the spectrophotometric values are 
more trustworthy than those obtained by the Carr-Price method, but 
the concordance here obtained is good enough to lead to the 
conclusion that the Carr-Price method gives a rough estimate of 
the vitamin A content of an oil. 




VITAMIN A DETERMINATION ON OILS OF POULTRY AND CATTLE GRADE 


INTRODUCTION 


Whilst the spectrophotometric determinations on the 
medicinal oils were in progress, it was decided to analyze some 
fish oils used for cattle and poultry* Infomation regarding the 
vitamin A content of these oils was desired in connection with 
certain feeding experiments being conducted by the Departments 
of Animal and of Poultry Husbandry* 

The vitamin A determinations were carried out as 
described for the medicinal oils; on both the untreated oil and 
the unsaponifiable fraction* 


DISCUSSION 


It is evident from the results in Table Vlll that 
the majority of the crude oils are poor in Vitamin A* Two, at 
least, of the oils were however, richer in vitamin A than many of 
the medicinal oils. Once again the unsaponifiable fractions as 
compared to the oil always yielded lower results. It is doubtful 
whether the values found for the unsaponifiable fraction of these 
particular oils (Table vlll asterisk) represents their true 
vitamin A content. It is certain that the amount of vitamin A 
in these oils does not exceed the values given. 

It is to be expected that there might be a distinct 
correlation between the percentage of free fatty acid in an oil

and the percentage decrease in the apparent vitamin A content of the 
oil following saponification. This is however not "borne out by our 
results as summarized in Table IX. Nor is there any evidence of a 
relationship to the degree of unsaturation of the free fatty acids 
as indicated by the iodine number. 

THE VITAMIN A CONTENT OF PILCHARD OIL AS DETERMINED 
BY SPECTROSCOPIC AND BIOLOGICAL METHODS 

Gutteridge (19) In feeding experiments with chicks, 
found that the vitamin A content of a pilchard oil (F.F.A. - .66 fo) 
was equal or slightly superior to that of a sample of cod liver oil 
which was "fairly typical of the better grade of cod liver oils 
for poultry feeding (F.F.A. -3.69$)". This result is not in 
accordance with our spectroscopic findings (Table Vlll). 

There can be no doubt that the spectrophotometrie 
data at least established the maximum amount of true vitamin A 
in pilchard oil. Refined pilchard oils are, however, highly colored 
by a golden brown pigment which does not appear to be present in the 
refined liver oil of the cod fish. The question naturally arises 
as to how far this pigment of pilchard oil (assuming the pignent 
has pro-vitamin activity for the chick) would account for the 
discrepancy in the results. 

The efficacy of carotene as a substitute for vitamin 
A in the diet of the rat and the chick, is well known (20,21). 

The transformation of dietary carotene into vitamin A is believed 

to take place in the liver. It is now generally conceded that 







vitamin A, as such, does not occur in the plant kngdom. Grasses, 
legumes, carrots etc., are relatively rich sources of vitamin A 
by virtue of their high carotinoid content. The pro-vitamin 
activity of carotinoids other than carotene is not so definitely 
established. The vitamin A activity of yellow corn appears to be 
due, not to carotene itself, but to a related pigment, kryptoxanthine 
(22). The carotinoids of butter, egg yolk and cow’s blood serum 
include kryptoxanthine as well as carotene and xanthophyll (23,14,25). 
The latter is biologically inactive for the rat but may be active 
for the chick (26,27,28). Thus the biological assay measures the 
total growth-promoting effect due to the sum of the contributions 
of vitamin A and that fraction of the carotene and kryptoxanthine 
which is transformed into vitamin A in the rat; and in the case 
of the chick, xanthophyll may also contribute. 

It did not seem possible that the amount of pigment 
in pilchard oil could account for the large discrepancy between 
the biological and the spectroscopic results. It was decided 
however, to fractionate the carotinoid pigments in pilchard oil, 
measure their absorption, and from the data obtained, calculate 
the vitamin A equivalent, assuming that all the pigment was 
biologically active for the chick. The method used, is outlined 
below. 




20 - 


THE FRACTIOKATION OF THE CAROTINOIDS 
PIGMEETS OF PILCHARD OIL 


PROCEDURE 

The procedure outlined below is based upon the 
observation of Wolff, Overhoff and Eckelen (29) that carotene 
can be separated from vitamin A by shaking a petrol-ether solution 
of the two with 90% alcohol; the vitamin goes into the alcoholic 
layer. 

Pilchard oil, 372 gms., was saponified by boiling in 
an atmosphere of nitrogen with 176 ml. of a saturated solution of 
potassium hydroxide and 800 ml. of alcohol (95%) for fifteen 
minutes. The hydrolysate was then extracted with ether (5 litres). 
Of the total pigment in pilchard oil, the greater part was not 
soluble in ether, and therefore was not carotinoid pigment. The 
ether extract was concentrated to 250 ml# An aliquot 1.34 ml. was 
evaporated in vacuo and the residue dissolved in 10 ml. absolute 
alcohol. This represented a 2% solution of the original oil. The 
vitamin A content as determined by the spectrophotometer was 249 
I.U. per gram of oil. 

The entire ether extract was taken to dryness in vacuo 
and the residue dissolved in 250 ml. of petrol-ether. The petrol- 
ether solution was then extracted five times by shaking in a 
separatory funnel with 200 ml. portions of 90% methyl alcohol. 

The two fractions were then evaporated in vacuo and 
each residue dissolved in 50 ml. of sulphuric ether. Baly tube

determinations were carried out on "both these solutions to 
determine the dilution for the sector photometry. 

1. METHYL ALCOHOL PEASE 

fljs 

(a) VITAMIN A - the absorption value, E(l cm. 328mu, 
of the 90 fo methyl alcohol fraction was found to be .114 which is 
equivalent to 182 I#U. of vitamin A per gram of oil. 

(b) XANTHOPHYLL - the pigrient in this fraction was 
assumed to be xanthophyll, which according to Gillam (33) has an 
absorption maximum at A. 455mu in chloroform solution. To get a 
measurable absorption at 455mu, a strong solution of the pigment 
was used. The intense absorption of vitamin A masked the absorption 
curve, (Fig. 4, curve c) due to the pigment. An indication of the 
xanthophyll content of this fraction, at least the maximum amount, 
was obtained from the measurement of the intensity of absorption 

at 455mu. According to G-illam (30) a 1 fo solution of xanthophyll 
in chloroform in a 1 cm. tube has an extinction co-efficient of 
1570 at 455mu. using this factor the xanthophyll content of one 
gram of the pilchard oil was calculated to be no greater than 
.019 mgms. Since 1 International Unit of vitamin A is equal to 
.001 mg. carotene (16), it was assumed that .019 mgns. of 
xanthophyll would be equivalent to 19 International Units. 

2. PETROL-ETHER - CAROTENE PHASE 

The absorption curve of crystalline carotene* in 
ether, as obtained by us, is shown in Fig. 4 curve a. The head

In Figure 4 curve b, the absorption curve of the 


petrol-ether phase is given. It will be observed again that a 
selective absorption band for the pigaent was not obtained due 
to the presence of some substance absorbing strongly in the region 
of 400mu but which was not extracted by 90 G /o methyl alcohol and 
therefore, does not appear to be vitamin A. The extinction co-efficient 
at 448mu was taken as a measure of the maximum amount of carotene 
in this fraction. Employing factor 2180, the carotene content of 
1 gn. of the pilchard oil was calculated to be of the order of 
.00076 mgms. which is equivalent to .76 International Units of 
vitamin A. The results summarize as follows:-

DISCUSSION 

From absorption measurements before and after oxidation 
of the oil at 90°C, Shram and How (31) calculated the vitamin A 
content of a sample of pilchard oil to be 160 I.U. Two samples of 
pilchard oil were assayed on rats by Bailey (32) and found to 
contain 120 and 175 I.U* of vitamin A. These results agree well 
with the vitamin A content of pilchard oil as calculated by us 
from the absorption measurements on the 90% methyl alcohol phase 
of the unsaponifiable fraction. 

A possible explanation of Gutteridge’s finding is 
suggested in the recent results of feeding trials with cod liver 
oil and pilchard oil obtained by Miss Milne of the Department of 
Poultry Husbandry* through whose courtesy the writer is permitted 
to make the following observations. 

Five groups of 15 newly hatched Barred Plymouth Rock 
chicks were placed on a vitamin A deficient diet composed of 
ground white rice 61%; middlings 15%; milk 5%; meat scrap 10%; 
yeast 5%; irradiated yeast 0.5%; calcium carbonate 1.5%. 

The ration of two groups of chicks was supplemented 
with a quarter percent and a half percent respectively, of pilchard 
oil (400 I.U. vitamin A). A weighed amount of the oil was diluted 
with olive oil and mixed with the feed. Similarly two other groups 
received a quarter percent and half percent respectively of cod 
liver oil (131D) which contained 1018 I.U. of vitamin A. A fifth 
control group received olive oil as a supplement. 

The average weight of the chicks at the end of the 
seventh week is given in Table X.

While there is no significant difference in the 
growth rates of the chicks in the various pens, it is evident 
that a difference in the growth-promoting value of these oils is 
greater on the smaller amounts (a quarter percent). This 
experiment is at present being repeated but feeding oils at 
even lower levels. 

These findings have been commented on at this time 
because they do indicate that Gutteridge t s results are of no 
significance since he compared the growth-promoting effect of 
pilchard and cod liver oil at levels (one and two percent) 
considerably in excess of the minimum requirements for chicks.

the determination of vitamin d 

1. MEDICINAL OILS 

As yet, no chemical or physical method for the 
quantitative determination of vitamin D has been developed. The 
biological method is used; the time required for such an assay 
being from seven to eight weeks. Up to the present time, it has 
been only possible to carry out assays on four of the medicinal 
oils. 


PROCEDURE 


The details of the method used are outlined in the 

U.S.P.X (5) . 

The diet used was Steenbock’s diet 2965:- 

Whole Yellow Maize (ground) 76 percent 
Ground Gluten 20 " 

Calcium Carbonate 3 n 

Sodium Chloride 1 tT 

The gluten was prepared by washing flour free from starch, accord¬ 
ing to the method outlined in Hawk and Bergeim (33). 

The cod liver oil to be tested was diluted with olive 
oil and fed to the rats with a pipette in amounts not exceeding 
0.1 ml. The rats, after they had been on the rachitogenic diet 
for three weeks, were divided into groups, and kept in individual 
cages. For a further ten days, they were fed the rachitogenic diet 
supplemented with the oil under investigation. Individual daily 
food consumption records were kept. No rat ate less than four grams 





daily and none lost weight. On the eleventh day, the rats were 
killed and the line test carried out. Four degrees of healing 
were recognized and are indicated in Table XI by the use of one 
to four plus signs. 

In a preliminary experiment, the amount of the 
U.S.P. Reference Cod Liver Oil (95 I.U.) required to give an 
average degree of healing, was determined by placing three groups 
of rats on different levels of the oil. It was found (Table XI), 
that .005 gns. of the Reference Oil administered daily for eight 
days gave the best degree of healing. The unknown samples of 
medicinal oils were administered in .005 gm. quantities. The 
results indicate that the vitamin D content of each of the four 
oils studied exceeded that of the Reference Cod Liver Oil. This 
finding is not significant since the Reference Oil is known to 
be abnormal insofar as its vitamin D content is concerned, 
containing as it does 9 5 I.IJ. as compared with 150 I.U. in a 
good grade cod liver oil. 

11. POULTRY OILS 

In collaboration with Miss Milne of the Department 
of Poultry Husbandry, the vitamin D content of two of the poultry 
cod liver oils, and of a pilchard oil, relative to that of the 
U.S.P. Reference Oil has been determined in assays with chicks.

The chicks were kept on this diet for three weeks. At the end of 
this period, the diet of the various groups were supplemented 
with different levels of the oils (Table Xll)• They were maintained 
on the supplemented diets for ten days. On the eleventh day, the 
chicks were killed and the line test carried out. The results 
of the assay are recorded in Table Xll. 


DISCUSSION 


The vitamin D content of pilchard oil is equal to, 
if not greater than that of the Reference Cod Liver Oil. The 
two cod liver oils examined were definitely poorer in vitamin D 
than the Reference Oil.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

A report of an investigation into the quality, purity 
and therapeutic value of medicinal cod liver oils, and of 
poultry and cattle grade oils has been recorded. The methods 
used, for the determination of vitamin A, the colorimetric 
and spectrophotometric, have been outlined. A few vitamin D 
assays were carried out, using the rat and chick as experiment¬ 
al animals. 

The results of the investigation are presented in 
various tables and indicate**” 

(1) That the medicinal cod liver oils studied were 
pure oils. 

(2) The Reference Cod Liver Oil contains 2554 I.U. 
instead of 5000 I.U. of vitamin A, as stipulated by the 
U.S.P. Revisions Committee. 

(3) The medicinal cod liver oils sold throughout 
the city vary widely in their vitamin A content. 

(4) The cattle and poultry grade oils, sold to 
farmers by the local wholesalers, also vary widely in their 
vitamin A content. 

(5) Provided the vitamin A content of the oil is not 
too low, there is no reason to doubt that the spectrophoto- 
metric method applied to the unsaponifiable fraction of the 
oils, gives accurate results. So far as the better grade 
medicinal and poultry oils are concerned, the absorption 
measurements have been satisfactory, and all these oils have

given characteristic vitamin A curves. 

(6) with the low grade oils, both medicinal and 
poultry, the results obtained may be still too high. 

(7) Pilchard oil appears to contain more vitamin D 
than poultry cod liver oils. 

(8) The growth-promoting value of pilchard oil can 
not be accounted for from its content of true vitamin A and 
of carotinoid pigments. 

As a general conclusion, particularly insofar as the 
study of medicinal oils is concerned, it may be said that the 
only safeguard the purchaser has is the reputation and the 
integrity of the manufacturer. Medicinal oils preduced by 
well established firms generally conformed to the standards 
of a good cod liver oil. Althou^i a much smaller number of 
cod liver oils of feed grade have been included in this study, 
it would appear that a similar conclusion is warranted. 
Obviously, cod liver oils should be required to conform 


to some standard
