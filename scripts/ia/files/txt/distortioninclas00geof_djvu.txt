DISTORTION IN CLASS *B f AUDIO AMPLIFIERS 


INTRODUCTION 

With the increasing public demand for high 
quality broadcasting, the subject of distortion in 
transmitters has become an important one, and much 
research is being done along this line at the present 
time. A number of careful investigations have been 
made in an effort to determine the amount of distor¬ 
tion of one hind and another that the human ear is 
capable of detecting. A still further investigation * 
has been carried on recently under the direction of 
Stuart Ballantine, in which efforts have been made to 
determine an acceptable and economically realizable 
standard of performance for high quality broadcast 
systems. Current Radio literature shows that manu¬ 
facturers are making every effort to design transmit¬ 
ters that meet such requirements, while operators of 
stations equipped with older transmitters are attempt¬ 
ing to make the necessary improvements, as far as 
possible, themselves. 

A perfect broadcast system would faithfully 
reproduce the input and add no extraneous sounds. Un¬ 
faithful reproduction of the input occurs in three 
forms.

1. The ratio of input to output amplitude may 

* 

not be independent of frequency. This is known as 

frequency distortion and is one of the most important 
forms of distortion occuring in sound transmission. It 
was not, however, considered in this work as it is in 
no way peculiar to class B audio-frequency amplifiers. 

2. The phase relations of components of var¬ 

ious frequencies may be altered. This form of distor¬ 
tion is known as phase distortion and is unimportant in 
the transmission of sound. Therefore this also was 

neglected in this work. 

3. The ratio of output to input amplitude may 
not be independent of amplitude. This is know/ as 
amplitude distortion and is a very serious form of dis¬ 
tortion occuring in class B audio-frequency ampli¬ 
fiers. It was therefore considered in this investiga¬ 
tion. An actual input-output curve for CKUA was run in 
May, 1935, and is shown in Graph I. In this case 
amplitude distortion begins with 50 per cent modulation 
and becomes quite serious for 100 per cent. Oscillo¬ 
graphic records show that such non-linearity is due to 
a flattening of the output wrave. 

The addition of extraneous noises is also 
a serious form of distortion in class B audio-frequency 
amplifiers. The noises occur in the form of harmonics

of the signal frequency, as can he predicted from a 
Fourier analysis of the flattened output wave. 

The two forms of distrotion that were con¬ 
sidered in this investigation are therefore interrelat¬ 
ed. Stuart Ballantine, in the above mentioned article, 
states that, rT The linearity should be such that the 
total harmonics at full load are less than 5 per cent". 
Frank Massa of the RCA Victor Company Inc., has 
carried out a detailed investigation of the permissible 
amplitude distortion of speech. He found that greater 
distortion is permissible when a single tube amplifier, 
producing a strong second harmonic is used, than when 
a push-pull stage producing a strong third harmonic is 
used. He also found that the permissible harmonic con¬ 
tent of an amplifier decreases as the frequency range 
of an amplifier is increased. A frequency range up to 
8,000 cycles may be set for the purposes of this in¬ 
vestigation, as a greater range is seldom considered 
necessary, even for high quality radio braodcasting. 

For this frequency range and for push-pull 

amplifiers, it is found from Massa f s article, that an 

harmonic content of 5 per cent is just noticeable when 

the distorted output is compared with an undistorted 

output. It is also found that an harmonic content of 

7 per cent is just noticeable when no comparison is

made. Thus it is seen that the 5 per cent maximum 

permissible harmonic content set by Ballantine is 

* 

conservative. Interesting articled are still 
appearing, treating this matter in still greater de¬ 
tail. In the United States the sum of all audio 
harmonics present in a modulated radiation is limited 
to 10 per cent by the Federal Radio Commission. 

Because of the interrelation of Amplitude 
distortion and harmonic content in radio broadcast 
systems, it is possible to take care of both forms of 
distortion with this one requirement, but it must be 
applied to the entire broadcast system. 

In modern design of transmitters class B 
modulators have become very popular because of the 
large amount of audio-frequency power that can be gen¬ 
erated at a reasonable cost, making high level mod¬ 
ulation practicable. In operation, the grids of class 
B modulators are driven decidedly positive on the 
signal peaks for the larger outputs. In such trans¬ 
mitters the modulators are by far the most important 
source of amplitude distortion. Other sources may 
therefore be neglected. 

The purpose of this investigation was to 
determine the causes of amplitude distortion in class 

to 

B audio-frequency amplifiers, and also the rules^be 
followed in design and operation to make it a minimum.

This was done as follows: 

1. Different loads on the output transformer 
of a class B audio-frequency amplifier were tried. For 
each load, curves of output, efficiency and harmonic 
content were plotted on an input base. The effect on 
each, due to the difference in load, was noted. 

2. Various resistances were added to the 
plate supply of the class B amplifier; curves of out¬ 
put and harmonic content were plotted on an input base 
for each resistance; and differences were noted. 

3. Various resistances were added %o the 
grid circuit of the class B amplifier. The same curves 
as in part 2 were plotted and the differences noted.

DUSCRIPTIOH OF APPARATUS 

A diagram of the amplifier actually used is 
shown in figure I. It is an audio-frequency system de¬ 
signed by The Hammond Manufacturing Company of Guelph, 
Ontario, and is capable of modulating a 100 watt carrier 
100 par cent when operated with 500 volts on the plates 
of the output tubes. The tubes used in the modulation or 
output stage were type 210 with metal plates, and they were 
operated with 425 volts on the plates, their maximum rat¬ 
ing. The maximum rated plate voltage for type 210 tubes 
with graphite plates is 600 volts and these would have 
met the Hammond specifications. 

The grid bias required to operate the output 
stage as a class B amplifier was determined as - 45 volts, 
from the curves of Graph II in the manner described by 
B. 1. Thompson.* These curves are the actual character¬ 
istics of the two tubes used and they are seen to be well 
matched.

Type 45 tubes were used in the driver stage as 
recommended by the Hammond Company. They were operated 
with 250 volts on the plates. The proper grid bias for 
class A operation was determined, from the average charact¬ 
eristics given by the Manufacturers in the RCA - Cunning¬ 
ham Radioiron Manual, as - 45 volts. 

The power to the plates of the two stages was 
supplied by a d-c generator designed to supply a 500 
watt trasmitter. Thus the power drawn by this relatively 
small piece of apparatus was negligible, giving splendid 
voltage regulation. The voltage onthe output stage was 
held at 425 volts with a control in the field of the 
generator. 

250 volts on the plates of the drivers was ob¬ 
tained from a potentiometer across the 425 volt supply to 
the output stage. A current of about 1 ampere was drawn 
by the potentiometer which consisted of a ban! of lamps 
and a slide wire rheostat placed in a suitable portion of 
it. This large current gave the required voltage drop 
(425 volts to 250 volts) through a much smaller resistance 
than would be required in series with the plates. This 
gave splendid voltage regulation on the drivers. This 
was found necessary, although the drivers were operated 
class A, because the current drawn was not quite constant 
after the grids went positive. 

The generator had a large amount of capacity 
connected across its terminals, thus giving a smooth volt-

age over the audio cycle. 

The transformer used in each position was that 
recommended by the Hammond Manufacturing Company, and was 
in each case as follows: 

Input transformer - Hammond, type 426, line to 
push-pull grids. 

Interstage transformer - Hammond, type 2150, 
push-pull plates to push-pull grids. 

Output transformer - Hammond, type 2155, push- 
pull plates to load. (8,000 ohms, plate to plate, to 
4,000 or 6,000 ohms load). 

The transformation ratios are given in figure 
I, and are in each case, the ratio of the total primary 
winding to the total secondary winding. 

It was decided that all measurements should be 
made at 1000 cycles, as this is about the average audio¬ 
frequency that a Radio transmitter is required to handle. 
The source used was a 1000 cycle, vacuum tube oscillator. 
The output was analysed with an harmonic analyser, and 
the harmonic content was found to be about 0.6 per cent. 
This was considered satisfactory.

The oscillator was coupled to the amplifier 
through a pich-up coil and potentiometer, as shown in 
figure As the resistance of the potentiometer was 
small relative to the input resistance of the first 
stage of the amplifier, the load on the oscilbtor remain¬ 
ed nearly constant for all settings of the potentiometer. 
This guaranteed a reasonably constant frequency. 

A pure resistance load, including the harmonic 
analyser, was connected across the output transformer. The 
harmonic analyser used is described in the appendix. 

It was a type which measures the combined effect of all 
harmonies as a per cent of the total output. This was 
satisfactory, as in high quality transmission of sound, 
it is the total harmonic content that the engineer is 
interested in. The analyser was capable of reading 
harmonic contents of 0.5 per cent and upwards with an 
error of about 3 per cent.

NORMAh OPERATIC!! 0? THE AMPLIFIER 

The amplifer was set up for normal operation 
as shown in figure 3. It was driven by the 1000 cycle 
oscillator, through the potentiometer as explained above. 

The load connected across the secondary of the output 
transformer was 4,000 ohms, as recommended by the Hammond 
Manufacturing Company* This gave a load of 2,000 ohms on 
the plate of each tube in the output stage* 

The input, measured at the potentiometer, was 
increased through 18 steps from 0 to 7.5 volts. For each 
step, the output current was read on a milliammeter, and 
the harmonic content of the output was obtained from the 
harmonic analyser. The curves of output current and 
harmonic content were then plotted on an input base, as 
shown in Graph III. Another curve, of output voltage from 
one half of the interstage transformer with no load on it, 
was run and also plotted in Graph III. This curve was 
run with a cathode-ray oscillograph because the input 
impedance of this instrument is very large. The points 
obtained do not give as smooth a curve as might be expected, 
because it is difficult to read this instrument accurate¬ 
ly* 

Curves of output against input in audio-freq- 
ency work are usually plotted in decibels. It was found 
impossible to follow this rule in this case. The input 
impedance of the amplifier was non-linear as the grids 
of the input stage went positive in the range covered. 

This means that the power drawn from the oscillator by the

amplifier was not a linear function of the applied voltage. 

Yet the output of the amplifier for linear operation, must 
be a linear function of the applied voltage. Therefore, 

n 

since the decibel is a measure of power level, curves plott¬ 
ed in decibels would not be satisfactory. Because of this 
the output was plotted in milliamperes on an input voltage 
base. 

Milliammeters were inserted in the grid circuits 
of both stages, and the inputs at which the grids went 
positive on the signal peaks were found by noting the 
points at which grid current began to flow. It was found 
that the type 45 tubes went positive at an input of 4.6 
volts and the type 10 tubes at an input of 2.15 volts. 

These points were marked on Graph III. 

As the harmonic contents of the larger outputs 
were much greater than the permissible value, the range 
covered was considered wide enough. It must be remember¬ 
ed that the input from the oscillator to the amplifer had 
0.6 per cent harmonic content in it to start with, and that 
the 5 per cent permissible harmonic content set by Eglantine 
is conservative. Then, since sources of amplitude dis¬ 
tortion other than the modulation stage are relatively 
unimportant in the usual broadcast system, 5 per cent 
harmonic content will be considered permissible in the 
output of this amplifier. 

It is at once noticed from Graph III that amp¬ 
litude distortion starts and harmonic content starts to 
increase, almost immediately after the grids of the type

10 tubes go positive. Similarly, after the grids of 
the type 45 tubes go positive, the amplitude distortion 
becomes more pronounced and the harmonic content in¬ 
creases at a rapid rate. It is clear then that distor¬ 
tion may be introduced in either stage after the grids 
of that stage swing positive on the signal peaks. The 
nature of this distortion will be brought out more 
clearly later on when the question of resistance in the 
grid circuit is dealt with. 

It is noticed too, that the curve of output 
voltage from the drivers with no load attached is lin¬ 
ear until after the grids of the tubes in this stage 
swing positive. Thus all distortion introduced before 
this point is reached may be attributed either direct¬ 
ly or indirectly to the output stage. 

It is found from the curves of Graph III, 
that the odput current at which the harmonic content 
reaches its maximum permissible value of 5 per cent, is 
56 raa. This gives a power output of 12.5 watts for a 
4,000 ohm load. It should be remembered, however, that 
the Hammond Company recommends 500 or 600 volts onthe 
plates of the type 10 tubes instead of 425 volts, as 
was actually used. The type 45 tubes, also, could have 
been operated at 175 volts on the plates instead of 150 
volts. These higher plate voltages would have permitted 
a greater bias on the grids of both stages, and a greater

input before the grids would go positive on the peaks. 
Thus the permissible power output would have been con¬ 
siderably increased, since it varies approximately as 
the square of the signal voltage. 

Well designed drivers for class B modulators 
are operated class A and the grids do not go positive, 
except perhaps a little for 100 per cent modulation. 

In some stations, however, the operators may find that 
the grids of the drivers are swinging quite positive 
on the peaks for the larger outputs, as shown in Graph 
III. In such cases it is probably better to operate 
the driver class AB or even class B and thus keep the 
grids negative throughout the cycle. There will then be 
a small increase in harmonic content for the smaller 
outputs, where it can usually be tolerated; and a con¬ 
siderable decrease in harmonic content for the larger 
outputs, where decrease is needed. The plate current 
to the drivers is usually drawn through a voltage 
dropping resistor, and sucM a resistor cannot be used 
when the drivers are changed from class A to class AB 
or class B operation, because the plate current is no 
longer steady.

It can now be shown by differentiating equation (3) with

Then for maximum power output each tube should operate 
into a load equal to its plate resistance. This can be 
compared with class A operation of a single tube where 
current flows throughout the cycle. 

In the above analysis no allowance was made for 
variation in plate resistance. This is actually far from 
constant, especially in the neighborhood of cut-off where 
it rapidly increases and finally becomes infinite. When 
the bias is adjusted to cut-off for the composite charact¬ 
eristics (See Graph II), current is actually flowing in 
each tube and the actual operating point for a single 
tube is on the curved portion of a single tube character- 
is tic. Thompson shows that the optimum load is actual¬ 
ly equal to one-half the plate resistance of a single tube 
at this operating point. This load resistance is some¬ 
what less than the plate resistance given in Vacuum Tube 
Manuals. Thompson further shows, that when this optimum 
load is used, "each tube operates into an effective load

resistance equal to its own internal resistance at 
every point throughout the cycle TT . 

There are two points that should be noted here 
in passing* 

1. The optimum load is not critical. Referr¬ 
ing again to Thompsons article (figure 4) it is seen 
that decreasing the load from its optimum value of 
4,000 ohms to 2,000 ohms, or increasing it to 7,000 ohms, 
only decreases the power output of the amplifier about 

8 per cent. This gives the designer ^'considerable range 

I ("» / n o 

to choose a value from. 

2. While the optimum load gives the maximum 
power output for a given signal input, the plate effic¬ 
iency of the amplifier is low and increases rapidly as 
the load resistance is increased. This point is only 
of importance ?/hen considerable amounts of pow-er are 
involved.

DIST0RTI0N AT DIFFERENT LOADS 

The optimum load on a class B audio-frequency 
amplifier was determined in the preceding section, but 
this is not necessarily the best load to use when the 
harmonic content is to be held below a certain fixed 
amount. In fact optimum load may not even give maxi¬ 
mum output for a given signal input after amplitude dis¬ 
tortion sets in. 

The optimum load on two type 10 tubes operat¬ 
ing class B may be found from G-raph n. it is the slope 
of the tangent aQB at the operating point 0 of a single 
tube, and is approximately 4,000 ohms. In Graphs IY 
and Y the results of tests runfor a 2,000 ohm load and a 
5,000 ohm load are shuwn. In both cases the operating 
conditions were normal. 

Curves of power output and efficiency are 
plotted in Graph l¥ for both loads. The power output 
curves are plotted in watts on a voltage input base and 
are not straight lines, since, in the region of linear 
operation, output in watts varies as the square of the 
input in volts. These curves give an excellent comparison 
of power output for the two loads, for given voltage 
inputs; but cannot be used to study distortion. There¬ 
fore, curves of output in milliamperes have also been 
plotted on a voltage base in Graph Y, along w^ith curves

The curves of Graph VI are simply the Ip - Ep 
characteristics of a type 10 tube. It was found necess¬ 
ary to extend these curves well into the positive grid 
region for this work. The usual static method of obtain¬ 
ing vacuum tube characteristics cannot be used in this 
region, since large plate voltages draw excessive plate 
currents when the grid is positive, sometimes damaging 
the tube and at least distorting the results from those 
obtained in practice when the grid swings positive for a 
small part of each cycle. 

A condenser - discharge - oscillographic 
Method of obtaining these characteristics has been pro- 
posed by Mouromtseff and Kozanowski.^ A condenser is 
charged to the desired positive potential and then 
suddenly discharged through a resistance from grid to 
filament. Thus the desired potential is instantaneously 
applied to the grid and the peak of the rush of the 
current in the plate circuit is caught on an oscillo¬ 
graph. This method has the following disadvantages. 

1. It is difficult to read an oscillograph 
accurately. 

2. A non-inductive power supply is required 
for the plate circuit. The inductance in the choke of 

a power supply filter, or even in the armature of a gen¬ 
erator, tends to smooth out the rush of plate current, 
and thus the values of current read from the oscillo¬ 
graph are too small.

Because of these disadvantages the charact¬ 
eristics in the positive grid region were obtained by the 
usual static method, but positive potentials were applied 
to the grid only while readings were being taken. 

The composite operating point of the two tubes 
has been taken from Graph II and marked on Graph VI. 
Through this point,load lines for 2,000 ohms and 5,000 
ohms have been drawn. 

Since the 5,000 ohm load is nearer the opti¬ 
mum load of 4,000 ohms than the 2,000 ohm load, the out¬ 
put for the former should be greater than for the latter 
over the region of linear operation. These outputs may 
be calculated from Graph VI for a given input, for ex¬ 
ample, a signal of 45 volts amplitude on the grids of the 
type 10 tubes. This signal brings the grids to zero on 
the peak and is still in the linear region. For the 2,000 
ohm load we get a peak plate current of 57.5 ma. and 
a peak plate voltage of 115 volts. This gives a power 
output of 3.31 watts. Similarly for the 5,000 ohm 
load the power output is found to be 3.54 watts. The 
latter is somewhat greater as predicted, but the differ¬ 
ence is less than 7 per cent showing again that the opt¬ 
imum load is not critical. 

The actual power output is read from graph 
IV as 3.11 watts in both cases. When a correction is made 
for power losses in the transformer windings (Iron losses

are negligible) the OTxtputs become 3*22 watts for the 
2,000 ohm load and 3*14 watts for the 5,000 ohm load* 

The error in the former is 2*80 per cent and in the latter 
12*7 per cent. Thus the measured output for the 2,000 
ohm load is quite reasonable while that for the 5,000 
ohm load is clearly too small. Time did not permit 
finding the cause of this error* 

The calculated output for the 2,000 ohm load 
with the grids swinging 30 volts positive is 9,14 watts 
and the actual power output is 8.17 watte. The error 
in this case is about 12 per cent, but no allowance was 
made for distortion. It is seen that power cutout can¬ 
not be safely calculated by this method in the positive 
grid region where distortion is usually serious. 

When it is desired to measure power output 
from a class B amplifier (push-pull) with more accuracy 
than was obtained in this work, a set-up similar to 
that in figure 5 may be used. The output transformer 
is replaced with a centre-tapped audio-freqnen y choke. 

The load is connected across the ends of the choke. It 
can be shown, by a simple analysis of this circuit, that 
all alternating current flows through the load while all 
direct current flows through the choke.

Thus the losses in the choice add in with the losses in 
the power supply and the plates, while the entire a-c 
output is dissipated in the load, in this manner a-c 
losses in the output transformer are entirely avoided. 

Referring again to Graph IV, it is seen 
that the output for the 2,000 ohm load is much greater 
than that for the 5,000 ohm load in the region where 
distortion is pronounced. This is the opposite to what 
would he expected from a consideration of optimum load. 
Referring now to Graphs IV and V together, it is seen 
that when the harmonic content of the output is limited 
to 5 per cent, the maximum permissible output for the 
2,000 ohm load is 12.5 watts while that for the 5,000 
ohm load is only 9 vrntts. Therefore the 2,000 ohm 
load, which is only one-half the optimum load, gives 
an output 59 per cent greater than the 5,000 ohm load, 

Y/hich is near the optimum load, without exceeding the 
permissible harmonic content. This increased output, 
however, is at a greatly decreased plate efficiency; 
the efficiency for the 2,000 ohm load being only 35 per 
cent and that for the 5,000 ohm load being 50 per cent. 

The reason for this increased output without w>oclue 
distortion is readily discovered from the vacuum tube 
characteristics of Graph VI. It is at once noticed 
that the characteristics in thepositive grid region 
tend to crowd together, and the lower the plate voltage 
the greater the crowding. This leads to a number of

empirical rules such as Preisman f s "that the minimum 

plate voltage-.-should be from two to three 

times the amount by which the grid is positive with 
respect to the cathode". Such rules are very rough 
and take no account of the difference in conditions 
for different load lines* Graph YI shows that the 
larger the load, the less steep the load line, and the 
poorer the positive grid region becomes for a given 
grid swing. In fact, in this work, it was found pos¬ 
sible to cut the plate voltage practically to zero 
on the peaks of the grid swings, and to thus obtain 
an output wave math flat tops, by applying a large 
signal to the grid *nd using a large load. This is a 
most important source of amplitude distortion. McLean^* 
claims that it is the final limit in reducing non¬ 
linear distortion in a class B audio amplifier, as 
all other sources may be reduced by adequate design to 
amounts well below the limits set by the curvature 
and irregularities of the plate current curve. 

Then in conclusion it may be said that the 
best load to use on a class B audio amplifier must be 
determined from a study of operating conditions for 

a number of loads around optimum load, and from a

consideration of the radio-frequency stage to be mod¬ 
ulated. A load larger than optimum load will give an 
output only slightly smaller but at a higher efficiency 
for a given input. This is clearly brought out by 
the curves of efficiency shown in Graph IV. The har¬ 
monic content, for a given output will in most cases 
be larger, when the load is greater than optimum. 

On the other hand, a load smaller than 
optimum will have a considerably decreased harmonic 
content for >a given output. The output for a given 
input will only be slightly decreased, but the effic¬ 
iency will be decreased considerably. Then the best 
load for the modulator in a small transmitter, where 
efficiency is unimportant, is generally less than the 
optimum load.

THE CALCUMTIOH OF HARMONIC CONTENT 

The general problem of the calculation of 
the harmonic content in a given wave is of course bas¬ 
ed upon a Fourier analysis of the wave. Since the 
determination of Fourier coefficients is tedious, and 
since harmonic analysis is a problem frequently occur¬ 
ing in the design of radio transmitters, a number of 
short-cut methods have been devised. These methods are 
shorter because simplifying assumptions are made at the 
start and generality is thus lost. Therefore, in apply¬ 
ing these short-cut methods, one must be sure that 
these fundamental assumptions hold for the particular 
ease in hand. 

In the following work, the harmonic content 

for the 2,000 ohm load and an output of 12.5 watts is 

calculated as a rough check on the measured content of 

5 per cent. The analysis used is a short-cut method 

* 

devised by Mouromtseff and Kozanowski, modified in 
such a way as to apply to this particular case. Two 
simplifying assumptions are made. 

The first is that the signal voltage impres¬ 
sed on the grids of the amplifier is sinusoidal. In 
the case under consideration this assumption,does not 
hold since the grids are going quite positive on the 

peaks and the regulation of the drivers is not perfect.

Therefore the system must be modified. A study of 
Graphs III and IV show that the voltage generated by 
the drivers for an output of IE.5 watts from the amp¬ 
lifier, has an amplitude of 93.0 volts and is sin¬ 
usoidal. Then the instantaneous voltage applied to the 
grids of the output tubes is 

e g = e g “ i g R i 

where e is the instantaneous voltage developed by the 

o 

drivers, ig is the instantaneous grid current and R^ 
is the equivalent driver resistance viewed from the 
grids of the output tubes. The equivalent driver imp¬ 
edance also has a small reactive component, which is 
neglected in this work. R^ is readily calculated and 
i„ can be estimated from its average value and the 
angle through which it flows. For more accurate work 
it is necessary to know the exact wave shape of ig. 

The second assumption is that the amplifier 
is balanced, so that all even harmonics balance out and 
do not appear in the output. This assumption is seldom 
strictly true in practice, but may be made in this work 
since the tubes were found to be well matched. For cal# 
culation of harmonic distortion where unbalance exists 
the reader is referred to "Electric Circuit Analysis", 
by M. G. Haiti. 

The method used is as follows. In the first 
column of Table I, angles over a quarter of a cycle are 
■iisted. This is all that is necessary because of the

the operating point ver half a cycle for some given 
power output, and is not to be confused with the out- 
put-input curves of similar shape, shown in other Graphs 
In this work. 

The equivalent driver resistance is calculated 
as follows. Since the driver tubes are operating class 


f they ore equivalent to two 
generators connected in series

instantaneous voltage generated by the drivers. There¬ 
fore an analysis of this curve will give the total har¬ 
monic content introduced by the output stage. The 
harmonic eontent,thus calculated, by the method devised 
by Mouromtseff and Kozanowski is 4.80 per cent while the 
measured content is 4.40 per cent. The calculated 
value is the maximum possible since the per cent con¬ 
tent of each harmonic is calculated separately and 
all are added together arithmetically. The measured 
value is the minimum possible since it is obtained by 
subtracting 0.6 per cent, the content in the oscillator 
output, from 5 per cent, the content in the amplifier 
output, as though the harmonics introduced by each are 
exactly in phase. The eheck then is close, in spite of 
the approximate values of grid current used in obtain¬ 
ing the modulation characteristic.

LISTORTIOR WITH RBSISTAHCB IL T THE FLAT# SUPPLY 

Many different forms of impedances are 
found in the plate supply of class B amplifiers; de¬ 
pending upon the type of supply, generator or rect¬ 
ifier, and the type of filter used. The problem is 
further complicated when the same supply serves the 
radio-frequency stages of the transmitter as well as 
the audio stages, A general solution of the problem 
is difficult , if not impossible. in this work an 
attempt was made to study the effect on distortion of 
resistance in the plate supply. Large values of re¬ 
sistance were used so that the effects of other im¬ 
pedances in the power supply would be relatively small. 

In Graphs VIII and IX, curves of output 
current and corresponding curves of harmonic Content, 
for various resistances added to the plate supply, are 
plotted on an input voltage base. The curves of Graph 
VIII are for a 2,000 ohm load and those of Graph IX 
for a 5,000 ohm load. A knowledge of the current 
drawn from the power supply by a class B audio amp¬ 
lifier is necessary, however, before the curves can 
be analysed. 

A rough consideration of the problem might 
lead one to expect that this current would be closely 
represented by a sine wave with the negative half 
cycles turned up. An oscillographic record, however, 
showed that in this case it consisted of a large d-c 
componentAof twice the signal frequency impressed on

top of it. (See figure 7) 

This d-c component was much 
larger than the normal d-c com¬ 
ponent flowing when no signal 
was impressed. It is due to an 
effect Inown as self-reotifica- 
tion occuring in the vacuum 
tubes. Eli %±H±—l 

Preisman* states, "In the general case of 
a tube with curved characteristics, the plate current - 
when a signal voltage is impressed upon the grid - 
contains not only a-c components, but often a d - c 
component in addition to the normal d-c component". 

When the characteristics are concave upwards - as in 
the case of a triode - the former is additive and 
the total d-c component rises when a signal is impres¬ 
sed. When the load resistance is small the plate 
current is large, and self-rectification is in general 
large T 

The characteristics shown in Graph II are 
quite curved. Thus each tube in the amplifier used 
in this work would be expected to draw a considerable 

d-c component of current, and this current would 

r 

account for the large d-c component occuring in the 
plate supply circuit. 

Preisman shows that even for normal opera¬ 
tion, with no impedances added to the plate supply, 
the operating point shifts away from the quiescent

point and off the load line. The decrease in the 
slope of the linear portion of the output curves of 
Graphs VIII and IX as resistance is added to the 
plate supply is very noticeable. This shov/s that the 
resistance added to the plate supply decreases the 
amplification factor of the stage; or in other words, 
shifts the load line over in the direction of increas¬ 
ed load. It is easily shown, however, by calculations 
from the tube characteristics and load lines of Graph 
VI that this shift is not as great as it would be if 
the same resistance were added directly to the load. 

The difference is indirectly due to the d-c component 
of current through the added resistance. Thus this 
case is very complicated and needs further investiga¬ 
tion before it can be thoroughly analysed. 

The curves of harmonic content in Graphs 
VIII and IX sho?? that resistance in the plate circuit 
increases the distortion, slightly for a given input 
and considerably for a given output. This increase in 
distortion can be accounted for in the same manner as the 
increase in distortion with increased load was account¬ 
ed for in a preceding section. The shift in the load 
line is downward, toward a more distorted portion of 
the positive grid region.

imother factor contributing to distortion in 
this case is the regulation in the power supply. The 
large d-o component of current referred to above, causes 
a d-o voltage drop through the added resistance. Thus 
the plate voltage changes with load, but the grid bias 
remains fixed; and if the grid bias is correctly adjust¬ 
ed for no load, the operating point will be beyond cut¬ 
off, under load# Distortion increases rapidly as the 
operating point is pushed into the class 0 region. 

Curves of the drop in plate voltage under load, 
are plotted in Graph VIII and expressed as a percentage 
of no-load voltage. These curves show that an harmonic 
content of 5 per cent, increases to 6.5 per cent for a 
resistance of 1250 ohms in the plate supply* and a volt¬ 
age drop on the plates of 20 per cent. Similarly, an 
harmonic content of 5 per cent, increases to 7.7 per cent 
for a resistance of 2,500 ohms in the plate supply, and 
a voltage drop on the plates of 52 per cent. It should 
be noted, however, that the increase in harmonic content 
for the same output is much greater. Thus, in the first 
case the harmonic content increases from 5 per cent to 
18 per cent for the same output and a voltage drop on 
the plates of 40 per cent. There is also a considerable 
decrease in efficiency.

An important point to notice here is that 
relatively large resistances were required to obtain 
these effects. Therefore, it should be possible, in 
the design of a power supply, to keep distortion from 
this source small enough to be neglected.

DISTORT I ?T 1'ITH R :M , Itt Til . GRID ‘IUCUIT: 


Resistance in the grid, circuit is one of the 
most important causes of distortion in class R audio 
amplifiers. Fortunately, however# distortion from this 
source can be reduced by careful design to a point 
where it is negligible relative to the distortion 
introduced in the plate circuit by the curvature and 
irregularities of the plate current curve. 

This distortion in the grid circuit 1 b caus- 
©d by the non-linearity of the Impedance offered to the 
drivers by the grids of the class B amplifier* For 
largo power outputs the class B amplifier ie operated 
with its grids swinging decidedly positive on the sig¬ 
nal. peaks. Thus the grid of each tube goes positive 
over a part of the cycle# offering a relatively small 
Impedance to the drivers: while over the remainder of 
the cycle the grid in negative# offering an almost 
infinite Impedance to the drivers, as a result of this, 
current Is drawn from the drivers on the signal peaks 
only? and unless the regulation of the drivers is Eero, 
the voltage impressed on the grids will not equal the 
voltage developed by the drivers over the entire cycle. 
The peak voltage impressed on the grids ia therefore less 
than the peak voltage developed by the drivers when the 
gride are swinging positive. This results in amplitude 
distortion and increased harmonic content in the output 
when the Input is great enough to drive the grids posit¬ 
ive on the peaks. 











' 




























































- 37 - 


These effects were brought out in the sec¬ 
tion on the normal operation of the amplifier, when the 
effects of the grids of the drivers going positive were 
discussed. The same results are shown more clearly by 
the curves of Graphs X and XI. The output current and 
the corresponding harmonic content are plotted on an 
input voltage base for several different resistances 
added to the grid circuit of the class B stage. The 
curves of Graph X are for a 2,000 ohm load and those of 
Graph XI for a 5,000 ohm load. In both sets of curves 
the increase in amplitude distortion and harmonic con¬ 
tent for increased resistance in the grid circuit is 
very marked. Both set in just after the amplitude of 
the signal becomes great enough to drive the grids of 
the class B amplifier positive on the peaks. The 
TT humps TT in the curves of harmonic content are clearly 
due to the resistance in the grid circuit, and the small 
hump in the curve for no added resistance is due to the 
resistance already in the circuit. 

It was shown in the section on the calcula¬ 
tion of harmonic content that when the drivers are 
operated class A this resistance is given by the formula 

Rp = (2 R p -hi R ) j ^2 

1 2 

where Rp is the plate resistance of a driver tube 

R^,^ is the resistance of the total primary winding 

of the coupling transformer 

R- is the resistance of the total secondary winding 
x 2 

and n is the turn ratio.

The problem of the designer is to make this equiv¬ 
alent driver resistance a minimum. 

The first factor to consider is the plate 
resistance of the driver tubes* This must be as 
small as possible and so tubes with a low plate resist¬ 
ance should be chosen* Such tubes also have a small 
amplification factor; but when they are operated class 
A, as is usually the case* they may be driven through 
a transformer with a large step-up turn ratio* This 
gives the stage a reasonable over-all amplification. 

The step-up ratio of the transformer is limited chief¬ 
ly by the distributed capacity of its secondary wind¬ 
ing. 

The Hammond Company recommends type 45 tubes 
as drivers for the amplifier used* This tube has a 
plate resistance of only l # b50 ohra^ but an amplifica¬ 
tion factor of only 3*5. This driver stage is driven 
through a transformer with a step-up turn ratio of 1:10, 
total primary to total secondary* 

The second factor to consider is the turn 
ratio of the transformer coupling the drivers to the 
class B stage. This ratio should be as small as possible, 
and in practice it is usually found possible to use a 
step-down ratio. The transformer actually used in this 
work had a step-down ratio of 5: li » 

There is one other factor to consider here, and 
it is the operating point. It was pointed out in the

section entitled Normal Operation, that the grids of the 
class A drivers should not go positive on the peaks* 
Furthermore, the step-down turn ratio of the coupling 
transformer demands that the class A stage develop® a 
large voltage output* It has already beeh shown that 
this voltage is developed largely in the input trans¬ 
former of the class A stage and the voltage swing on the 
grids of the drivers is therefore relatively large* This 
is compensated for by the fact that a tube with a small 
amplifies-* ion factor ha*- a low grid out-off voltage and 
large swinge are possible without driving the grids posi¬ 
tive* 

The resistance of the transformer windings 
should .also be as small as possible, but the subject of 
transformer design cannot be treated here. 

The resistance of the source of bias on the 
class B tubes should also be added into the equivalent 
driver resistance. It was neglected in this case be¬ 
cause new batteries were used and it was relatively 
small* When the bias is obtained, from a generator, the 
Inductance of the armature must also be taken into con¬ 
sideration*

A few rules to be followed in the design and 
operation of class B audio-frequency amplifiers, brought 
out in this v/ork, are as follows, 

1. The tubes of both the amplifier and the 
driver stage should be operated at the highest possible 
plate voltage. When this is done the cut-off grid vol¬ 
tage has its maximum possible value and the signal that 
can be applied to the grid Y/ithout driving it positive 
is a maximum. 

E. The drivers of a class B audio amplifier 
should be operated class AB or even class B rather than 
class A with the grids going very far positive. Such 
cases are sometimes found in practice. It should be 
rememb^*ed, however, that the reduced voltage required 
by the plates of the drivers can be obtained from the 
plate supply of the output stage, through a volt¬ 

age dropping resistor, only when the drivers are operat¬ 
ed class A. 

3. Optimum load is not necessarily the best 
load to use on a class B audio amplifier. It is not 
critical and a good output can be obtained for any load 
that is near optimum. A load considerably less than 
optimum will usually give the maximum possible power 
output when the harmonic content cannot exceed a fixed 
value. This output is obtained at a considerably reduc¬ 
ed efficiency, but this is unimportant in small trans¬ 


mitters.

4. Resistance in the plate supply of a 
class B amplifier should be small. 

5. The type of tube selected for the driver 
stage should have a small plate resistance and the turn 
ratio of the coupling transformer should be step-down 
when possible. Other factors, such as the resistances 
of the transformer windings, and the impedance of the 
grid bias should also be as small as possible to give 
the drivers the smallest possible regulation. 

6. The input transformer to the drivers should 
have a large step-up turn ratio to balance the low 
amplification factor of the driver tubes, selected for 
low plate resistance. 

In conclusion, the author wishes to express 
his sincere thanks to Dr. H. J. MacLeod for supervising 
this investigation.

APPE1DIX 


The Harmonic Analyser 

The system of harmonic analysis used, in this 
investigation is known as "The Resistance Bridge Method". 


It is described by E. E. Terman, in his book "Measure¬ 
ments in Radio Engineering". A diagram of the bridge 
is shown in figure 8. 



Each arm of the bridge contains a total 
predetermined resistance R. Two opposing arms also 
contain an inductance and a capacity tuned to the 

fundamental frequency of the wave to be analysed. Thus 

A 

each arm offers a pure resistance impedance R to the 
fundamental component of current, while the arms con¬ 
taining inductance and capacity offer a veiy large im¬ 
pedance to the harmonics. The potentiometer P is a 
pure resistance and is usually taken equal to R.

When the switches S are open, all components 
of current are forced through p. The potentiometer is 
set to give a convenient reading on the milliammeter 
in the plate circuit of the vacuum-tube voltmeter. 

When the switches S are closed the bridge is balanced 
to the fundamental frequency and only the harmonic com¬ 
ponents of current flow through p. The potentiometer is 
set to give the same reading as before on the milliammeter. 
Then the ratio of the r.m.s. value of all the harmonic 
components of current to the r.m.s. value of the total 
current is the inverse ratio of the potentiometer sett¬ 
ings. Thus this bridge measures the total harmonic 
content only. 

The first step in the design of the bridge 
is to determine P, which has to be large enough to 
give a voltage that can be read conveniently on the 
vacuum-tube voltmeter, when the smallest harmonic con¬ 
tent to be handled is passing through it. Now the 
ordinary vacuum-tube voltmeter will not measure less 
than about 2 volts accurately, since the tube is operat¬ 
ed at cut-off to obtain anode rectification. Condi¬ 
tions can be improved some, by using heater type tubes 
which cut-off more sharply. With this bridge, however, 
it is possible to place a stage of amplification ahead 
of the voltmeter since no calibration is necessary. 

In this case it was found possible to do 
away with the voltmeter entirely, since the amounts

of power being analysed were relatively large, a 
multi-range milliammeter, reading down to one tenth 
of a milliampere, was simply placed in series with p. 
The total output current was then read directly on a 
high range and the total harmonic content on a low 
range. This method was found to be much less tedious 
than the other. 

The resistances R and P were arbitrarily 

set at 1000 ohms each. Terman states that jp should 

be at least 10. Thus the inductance was set at about 

4 henry making — equal to 25 at 1000 cycles. The 
K 

capacity required to resonate at 1000 cycles with an 
inductance of 4 henry is about .006 ^ , and it was 
obtained with a variable condenser which made tuning 
possible. 

The inductances used were of the non-magnetic 
type, and were wound with #30 enamel wire. They were 
designed to give a fixed inductance for a minimum 
length of wire , according to the rules in "Radio Engin¬ 
eer ing n , by F. S. ferman, Appendix A. This reduced 
the effect of distributed capacity to a minimum. A 
variable resistance was added in series with each coil 
to bring the total resistance up to the required 1000 
ohms. A resonance curve of one arm of the bridge is 
shown in Graph XII. It is a curve of the current 
passed by the arm for a fixed voltage across it, taken 
from 500 cycles to 10,000 cycles. At the fundamental 
frequency of 1000 cycles the response is excellent,

while at all the odd harmonics of 1000 cycles the 
response is too small to show. This is what was 
required. 

Iron core inductances cannot he used in a 
circuit such as this. The iron losses in high grade 
transformers are said to be negligible, but this is 
not true of iron core inductances for the following 
reason. When the voltage on the primary of a trans¬ 
former is constant, the alternating flux in the core 
of the transformer is constant regardless of load, 
and the iron losses are thus constant. These losses 
are taken care of by the exciting current which is 
also constant, and quite small relative to the load 
current. Thus losses which are negligible referred 
to the load current, may be quite appreciable referr¬ 
ed to the exciting current. How an iron core induct¬ 
ance may be thought of as a transformer with its 
secondary open, and the current it draws is thus 
equivalent to the exciting current of a transformer. 

The impedance of this bridge to the 
fundamental frequency is 3R when the switches S are 
open, but only R when the switches are closed. In 
this investigation it was important that the load on 

the aplifier be held constant. This was done by plac- 

A 

ing a resistance 2R, with a short-circuiting switch 
across it, in series with the bridge. The short- 

circuiting switch was opened when the switches S were

closed, and closed when the switches S were opened. 
This corrected the circuit for the fundamental freq¬ 
uency, but not for the harmonic frequencies. Thus 
the load on the amplifier was held constant, but the 
readings of harmonic content had to be corrected by a 
simple multiplier.
