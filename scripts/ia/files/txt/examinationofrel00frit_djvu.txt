ABSTRACT 


This study was designed to discover whether variations in oral 
and written performance are associated with factors such as age, sex, 
intelligence and academic achievement, as well as with biological and 
sociological variables. 

When oral and written performance are examined in the light of 
the ’operational thought 1 concepts of Piaget it appears that the upper 
end of the maturational scale is characterized by the superiority of 
the written over the oral technique. At the lower end of the scale, 
however, where oral experience precedes written experience by several 
years, the oral technique would be expected to dominate. Hence one 
is led to postulate a point of equidominance and a maturational move¬ 
ment away from the oral dominance of the early years to the written 
dominance of the adult years. 

On the basis of the theory, a number of hypotheses were put for¬ 
ward for testing. 

H^: There exist sex differences in the 0, W and 0+Xf scores. 

H 2 : Oral performance (0) is to some extent different from written 
performance (W). 

Hg: With advance in age and grade the reasoning activity involved 
in problem solving changes from a state of oral dominance in the 
direction of equidominance. 

H4: Since females are assumed to be more advanced in maturation, girls 
will tend to exhibit a greater progress away from oral dominance in the 
direction of equidominance.

Hgi The oral reports given by girls for correct solutions tend to be 
rated more highly than the oral reports for corresponding correct 
solutions given by boys* 

Hg: Written as opposed to oral dominance is positively related to 
intelligence and achievement. 

The experimental procedure required the individual testing of 
301 grade four and grade five students in Burt’s Reasoning Test. In 
addition, a wide variety of achievement and intelligence scores were 
available from the Glover Bar Survey. 

Strong evidence was obtained in support of the first five 
hypotheses while the sixth appeared to be untenable, although the 
evidence in this case was far from conclusive. 

Two findings emerged clearly from the thesis. All the evidence 
supported the hypothesis of a rnaturational movement from oral to 
written dominance, a movement in which the females maintained their 
initial advantage. At the same time the superiority of males in the 
oral reasoning, and to some extent in written problem solving, was 
evident. Both findings were seen to have important implications for 


the classroom,

CHAPTER I 


THE PROBLEM 

In the elementary school oral activity precedes written work. 
Before grade three written language is fragmentary; yet, from this 
point on, there is usually a steady increase in the proportion of time 
devoted to written work as compared to oral performance. At all stages 
of a pupil’s school life, however, he is appraised according to his 
proficiency in both oral and written work. Thus there seems to be an 
unstated assumption of similarity, almost of equivalence, between the 
two types of performance. Whether such an assumption is soundly based 
is a question to which a review of the available literature does not 
yield a ready answer. 

The problem may be stated in other ways. Is oral performance 
different from written performance? Many teachers have asserted that 
this is so. "Johnnie can’t express himself in writing;” ’’Mary can’t 
think on her feet;" and so on. Do such differences exist? Are these 
differences permanent, or can they be overcome? Are there many Johnnies 
and Marys? Are such discrepancies found more frequently in certain 
grades, or at specific ages? Are there two distinct types of performance? 
If so, is one type more likely to be found in one sex than in the other? 
Do pupils of certain grades vary in the relative superiority of one type 
of performance over the other? Are Johnnie and Mary different from 
George, who as everyone knows, ”... can get the answer but can’t ex¬ 
plain how he does it?” If such differences do exist, do they so appear

in other measurable performance such as achievement on academic or 
intelligence tests? Are there sociological, familial, economic or 
other factors associated with degrees of competence in each type of 
performance? 

These questions suggest some of the many unsolved problems 
relating to oral and written verbal facility which are of vital impor¬ 
tance to the classroom teacher. The first problem is whether the two 
facilities exist as separate abilities. Another is whether one ability 
is more prominent than the other in a given child. Is it also possible 
that a child may exhibit oral facility in one subject matter field and 
written facility in another field? Answers to these and comparable 
questions have not yet been reported in the available literature. The 
only studies of any relevance deal with the role of verbalization in 
problem solving. Fea (1953) compared the oral and written reports of 
what was remembered following the oral reading of several stories. 
Flanders (1948) recorded questions and oral comments made by pupils 
during seventeen hours of regular classroom instruction, and later 
classified them according to the level of operation. There are many 
other studies in which the subjects were instructed to "think aloud" 
as they solved problems in order to reveal methods of attack and causes 
of difficulty, error, or misunderstandings. None of the more than two 
hundred separate studies investigated provided adequate answers to the 
questions which have prompted this study. 

Factual answers to the above questions could shed light on many 
of the problems in the present day classroom. If it were shown that oral

performance was more closely tied to intelligence and achievement, a 
fairer appraisal of pupil ability would be an evaluation of his oral 
performance. On the other hand, if written performance was demon¬ 
strated to be closely related to maturation, the emphasis on this 
activity might increase with age and grade. Various changes in pupil 
activity during learning might be desirable if answers to many of the 
above questions were available. The amount and quality of seatwork, 
for example, could be tied to the individual differences between pupils. 
If it were demonstrated that optimal performance is represented by equal 
oral and written performance, deficiencies in one of these areas could 
receive special attention. It is obvious that answers to the questions 
posed in this study could influence the work of teachers and pupils in 
many aspects of instruction and learning.

CHAPTER II 


RELATED STUDIES 

This chapter presents a review of the studies which seem to shed 
light upon the oral and written verbal activities involved in the 
reasoning performance of school children. While none presents evidence 
bearing directly on the present study, they do provide a background of 
insights of value in the planning of research into the relationships 
between the oral and written ability manifest in the reasoning of school 
children. 

Meaning 

The relation of language to meaning has been frequently investi¬ 
gated, Noble (1952) defined meaning as a purely empirical construct. 
Meanings were postulated to increase as a simple linear function of the 
number of 8-multiple R connections established in an organism’s history. 
In his experiment he presented a list of ninety-six dissyllables to a 
sample of U.S.A.E. recruits. By defining meaning in terms of mean 
frequency of written associations made within a sixty second time 
interval he developed a scale of M-values. 

Holloway (1951), too, explored the meaning associated with verbal 
symbols and stated that while words acquired meanings through a process 
of conditioning, routine and chance could not account for intelligent 
behavior, and that action was intelligent to the extent that it was 
related to the purposes of the agent. The functions of language were

purposive, and thus language constituted a systematic means of bringing 
about those results desired by the agent. 

A third type of attack on the problem of meaning is that of 
Sherover (1954) who deals with remembering. To him, learning language 
involved learning and remembering certain patterns and forgetting some 
others; and it was the repeated exposure to the correct sounds of a 
language, uttered in meaningful contexts, which seemed to be most 
effective. He believed that the speech habits which constitute a 
language were best learned in wholes but did not recommend this method 
for analytic subjects such as mathematics. 

Thorndike (1949) explored the creation of new meanings. He had 
his subjects write meanings for a number of difficult real words mixed 
with a dozen novel words constructed for the experiment. Invented or 
wrong meanings were highly specific, few being given by more than one 
individual. Most of the wrong responses exhibited a rational origin 
in that meaning became associated with parts of each word. He concluded 
that creations, in the brain or elsewhere, could be as truly determined 
as the formation of water by the union of oxygen and hydrogen. 

An additional aspect of meaning was explored by Cunningham (1949) 
who raised the question as to whether vague language could be meaningful. 
He answered his own question by stating that since vague language was 
often the only functionally available language, vague language qua vague 
must be said to be meaningful. He agreed that making language precise 
exhibited its meaning more clearly but insisted that this did not 
necessarily make it more meaningful.

An experiment having elements in common with each of the last two 
views is that of Campbell and Freeman (1955). Their purpose was to 
study the effects of experimentally induced language in perceptual 
learning—paired associate learning of a sequence of drawings. One 
hundred and two subjects were divided into three groups representing 
three conditions of language, while fifteen subjects formed a control 
group which did not have a learning trial prior to matching the pictures 
into the original pairs. The results suggested that (a) increasing the 
meaningfulness of visual stimuli facilitated learning if meaningfulness 
was relevant to the task, and (b) attention to crucial aspects of the 
stimuli aided learning. There was no support for the generalization 
that language in any form facilitated perceptual learning. 

Verbal Behavior in Problem Solving 

In studying the thought processes of children during problem 
solving Kato (1942) found that, in the search for patterns in unbroken 
tracings thoughtful solutions appeared xvith growth in perceptive 
ability, and that concrete thinking preceded abstract thinking. To 
explore the same topic Cofer (1951) performed a series of experiments 
which demonstrated that the amount of relevant verbal material available 
to a subject, its associative strength, and its value to him were all 
related to his ability to solve problems. 

The value of graphical materials was investigated by Vernon (1952), 
who concluded that a written argument would not be made easier to under¬ 
stand and remember by presenting factual data graphically, except perhaps

in certain special circumstances* The most important special condition 
was that the readers had sufficient intelligence and experience to handle 
it. 

According to Jorgensen (1954) all problem solving processes 
involve thought. While some problems could be solved by mere manipula¬ 
tion of real things, others required imagining or intending changes. 

This presupposed the use of symbols. In abstract thinking symbols 
seemed to be necessary; yet it was doubtful whether linguistic symbols 
formed necessary parts of the more concrete thinking of animals or 
small children or primitive people. A similar but more recent study 
of symbolism is that of Nesbit (1955) in such diverse spheres as the 
dream, myth, graphic art, history, politics, and mathematics. He 
concluded that God, nature, mind, matter and cause had as their 
referents large parts or aspects of reality as a whole, that they were 
part of reality, that reality was all that existed. Reality had two 
realms; one was that of physical things, the other was that of words, 
symbols, ideas and imaginings. 

The study of symbolism has caused Kaldegg (1950) to postulate 
two types of language growth. Essays of children from grades three to 
eight on "My Vacation" were analysed with respect to abstract nouns 
referring to measures of time. The results apparently supported the 
idea of two types of language growth: external and quantitative as 
revealed in vocabulary counts, and the internal and qualitative aspect 


involved in symbolism,

Oral and Written Language 

This section may well begin with the exemplary report of the 
measurement of understanding in the language arts as discussed by 
Greene and Gray (1946), They defined language arts broadly enough to 
include the written and oral expressional skills and the receptive 
skills of listening and reading. They gave suggestions for methods 
of evaluation designed to measure pupil accomplishment in terms of 
verbal behavior. They defined the purpose of instruction in expression 
as the development of the power to use language effectively in communica¬ 
tion, whereas the aim of instruction in the receptive language arts was 
the cultivation of the ability to understand and react intelligently to 
all that the individual heard and read in customary life situations. 

A slightly different approach was that of Carlton (1950) who 
studied substantive modifiers in the oral language of fourth and fifth 
grade children. In order to obtain a sample of the spontaneous every 
day speech of average children he selected a group having I.Q.*s ranging 
only from 90 to 110. The children looked at a series of pictures 
through a peep-show and told stories about the pictures which were taken 
down in shorthand. Approximately six per cent of the words used were 
substantive modifiers, but only 105 different substantive modifiers were 
used. These modifiers could be classified under seven types. There was 
no difference between the number of modifiers used by boys and girls; 
yet the girls used more descriptive modifiers which made their oral 
language superior in quality to that of the boys.

The relationships between written and oral expression were 
investigated by Fea (1953). In his study three language samples were 
secured for each of 140 pupils in the fifth and sixth grades. These 
were the transcription of oral reading, the oral reproduction of what 
was read, and the written reproduction of the passage. Analysis of 
the records indicated that certain measures, including number of words, 
number of different words, and number of phrases, might be used as 
indicators of developmental level in all three cases, but that different 
norms were required for the different media. The level of development 
shown in the oral or written reproduction appeared to depend more on 
the level of material read than upon the reading level of the pupils. 

A very similar study is that of Harwood (1955) entitled "Listen 
Ability and Read Ability." He stated that the principal purpose of the 
study was to investigate some relationships between written and spoken 
language of various levels of difficulty. Seven stories were constructed 
to represent each of seven different levels of reading comprehensibility. 
Each story was accompanied by a set of test questions about the informa¬ 
tion in it. All stories were presented orally to one group and visually 
to another group. The results were that the series of language samples 
was only insignificantly more comprehensible when presented for reading 
than when presented for listening. 


Set 

Research in the area of set has concentrated upon flexibility, 
rigidity, functional fixedness, and direction. The experimental

analysis of behavior during problem solving began with Maier’s 1930 
experiment on "direction,” One problem involved constructing supports 
for a pendulum which made chalk marks on the floor. Another was the 
equally well-known Maier two-string problem in which the task was to tie 
together two strings supported from the ceiling but at such a distance 
apart that while one string was grasped the other was out of reach. 

The question of whether set or rigidity is found in all problem 
solutions has been widely explored. In a study utilizing factor 
analysis KLeemeier and Dudek (1950) failed to reveal such a flexibility 
factor. Cattell and Tiner (1949) suggested three factors making for 
rigidity in problem solving in addition to low intelligence. Other 
factor analyses have yielded contradictory results. A brief listing 
will illustrate: Cowen, Wiener, and Hess (1953) reported "... a 
tendency toward a generalized mode of problem-solution has been 
demonstrated and the likelihood that this tendency is ’personality- 
related* strengthened" (p.102); Goldstein (1953) concluded "(a) it is 
difficult to maintain a concept of rigidity, even intellectual rigidity, 
as a unitary psychological trait, and (b) intellectual rigidity . . . 
is not a necessary concomitant of extreme or stable social attitudes" 
(p.352); Solomon (1952) found rigid and non-rigid groups (critieals) 
differed significantly in scores and tests of "ability to utilize the 
elements of the scientific method;" Pitcher and Stacey (1954) suggested 
that the more rigid in problem solving were more submissive; Wesley (1953) 
suggested that the rigid were slower than normal in forming new concepts. 
Sometimes rigidity was defined as a function of the atmosphere in which

the group worked, whether ego-involved, or relaxed and free. These and 
other experiments caused Brown (1953) to state that rigidity is, "a term 
which should always be written with an operational subscript." (p.469) 

The effect of atmosphere was indicated by Beier (1951) who showed that 
perceived threat, i.e„, anxiety induced by unfavorable interpretation of 
Rorschach protocols, was followed by a "loss in flexibility of intellectual 
function and a disorientation of visual-motor coordinates" as measured by 
standard tests of vocabulary, abstract reasoning, concept formation, and 
mirror tracing. Difference in water jar solutions given by control, mild 
stress, and strong stress groups convinced Gowen (1952) that increasing 
degrees of experimentally induced psychological stress elicited increasing 
amounts of problem solving rigidity. In another study Gowen (1952) 
reported that the strong stress group revealed more rigidity than was 
found in a group in which stress had been reduced by praise. Similar 
findings were reported by Combs and Taylor (1952) who stated that the 
introduction of a mild degree of personal threat in the course of the 
solution of a simple task resulted in an increase of time needed to 
complete the task and in an increased number of errors. 

Critical Thinking and Logical Reasoning 

Morgan and Morgan (1953) found that performance on the Morgan 
Test of Logical Reasoning of a group with at least one semester of logic 
was superior to that of a matched control group. An increase of sixty- 
two per cent in performance by pupils taking a course in functional logic 
was noted by Melzer (1949). Somewhat contradictory results were achieved

by Brembeck (1949) who compared matched experimental and control groups 
in eleven colleges on a battery of four Watson-Glaser Tests of Critical 
Thinking, administered before and after a course in argumentation. 
Significant differences favored the control groups in some cases, the 
experimentals in others. 


Sex Differences 

In investigating sex differences on performance in problem solving, 
Moraes (1954) found the achievement of boys slightly superior, but only 
significantly so for one of the three age levels tested. Her data led 
her to suggest that girls reason as well as boys, but that they were 
either less quick or more careful; this suggestion was supported by 
Sweeney’s finding that larger sex differences are obtained with shorter 
time limits. Using card tricks involving retention and transfer, 

Hilgard (1954) found the performance of boys to be superior to that of 
girls. Cofer (1951) found significant differences between men and women 
on the Maier two-string problem. Saugstad (1952) obtained a correlation 
between incidental memory and problem solving of -.41 (Ps.01) for forty- 
nine high school boys, but of only -.10 for twenty-one girls. 

Sweeney (1953) tried to determine whether sex differences could

special abilities, or specific knowledge or training. Significant 
differences favoring men were found in each of four tests of logical 
reasoning for 100 pairs matched in verbal aptitude scores. For 90 pairs 
matched in mathematical aptitude and for sixty-nine pairs matched both

in verbal and in mathematical aptitude, a difference was obtained only 
for scores in arithmetic reasoning. In two experiments in which subjects 
equated for intelligence and specific knowledge attempted the Alcuin 
problem, the men achieved a larger percentage of solutions (P-.005). 

In an extremely elaborate experiment Sweeney (1953) matched sex 
groups for general intelligence, spatial ability, mechanical comprehen¬ 
sion, and achievement in mathematics. On verbal tool problems, puzzle 
book problems, mathematic-logic problems, as well as Terman's Concept 
Mastery Test, Thurstone f s Flag Test, an Abbreviated Mechanical Comprehen¬ 
sion Test, and a Mathematics Achievement Test the males displayed signifi¬ 
cant superiority. In general the results supported the hypothesis that 
sex differences will occur in problems which involve difficulties in 
restructuring, but not in similar problems which involve no such diffi¬ 
culties. 


Specific Factors Affecting Reasoning and Problem Solving 

In reporting the results of a study of verbal behavior in reason¬ 
ing, Cofer (1951) stated that the amount of relevant verbal material 
available to a subject, its associative strength, and its value to him 
were all related to his ability to solve problems. Reporting a study 
of the contributions of graphic representation to learning and problem 
solving, White (1953) suggested that all students could learn to 
represent situations, ideas, and emotions in a non-realistic, abstract 
form; and that such experiences might have a favorable influence on 
thought processes involving generalization. The effect of varying degrees

of reality was explored by Lorge at al. (1955) in the Mined Road Problem. 
The subjects were members of the Air Force Reserve Officer Training 
Corps. The problem was presented in four settings, representing degrees 
of remoteness from reality; a verbal description, a photograph of the 
problem, a miniature scale problem with manipulation, and the real 
situation. The results were that no significant differences in quality 
of solutions were found; but written solutions presented by teams were 
always better than those presented by individuals. 

Method of presentation and its possible effect upon solution was 
studied by Cobb and Brenneise (1952). Two hundred twenty-two college 
students were used in varied presentations of Maier’s string problems. 

The authors found that the frequency of solutions depended upon the degree 
of abstractness of the problem setting, the material available to solve 
the problem, and the sex of the subject—men were significantly better 
than women. 

Fattu, Eapos, and Mech (1954) investigated the relationship 
between the variables of age, sex, practice effects and anxiety on the 
one hand and certain response variables like error distance in solving 
mechanical problems and behavioral rigidity during trials on the other. 

The definite findings may be summarized: no general sex differences; 
no gains in problem solving from practice as such; an inverse relation¬ 
ship between anxiety and behavioral rigidity; and negative but complex 
relationship between age and problem solving. 

In considering how children learn the principles and techniques 
of problem solving, Thorndike (1950) came to the conclusion that problem

solving was variable and complex behavior, consisting of integration of 
particular knowledge, skills and attitudes, but with no simple pattern 
or routine. He stated that the role of the school lies in helping the 
pupil acquire a wide range of interests and experiences, an organized 
and functional stock of background information, efficient skills for 
locating and organizing needed information, perseverance yet flexibility 
in attacking problem situations, a willingness to suspend judgment until 
the evidence is in, habits of testing critically any proposed solutions, 
attitudes of critical appraisal of the reliability and bias of sources, 
and finally, skill in "if-then" thinking. 

In reporting the course of successful thinking, Lehner (1939) 
reported that for problems in which the more remote solutions were 
obscured by obvious facts, the process of solution showed that definition 
of the facts and trial and error behavior were characteristic of explora¬ 
tion, while definite insights were associated with successful solution. 

After studying the behavior of good problem solvers, Fattu, Mech, 
and Kapos (1954) concluded that time might be a dubious criterion of 
problem solving efficiency; that a strong inverse relationship existed 
between magnitude of error and problem solving proficiency; and that the 
Miller-Frick index indicated that the poor problem solvers were consist¬ 
ently more stereotyped in their problem solving behavior than the good 
problem solvers.

which bear a resemblance to the present study. They do, however, shed 
some light on the relationship of the two types of verbalization which 
is the major concern of this investigation. In addition, they give the 
setting in which reasoning activity is placed. As used in this study, 
reasoning is one of the activities associated with the more general 
term problem solving. 

Under the title "Meaning” were included studies illustrating 
meaning in language. Those studies of verbal behavior in problem 
solving were listed because of their close relationship to reasoning 
activities. Similarly research dealing with oral and written language 
was included. In order to illustrate how pupil performance on reason¬ 
ing tests might have been influenced, the studies on rigidity were 
included. So also were those dealing with critical thinking and logical 
reasoning and studies dealing with specific areas of problem solving. 

It was discovered early in the present study that the sexes were perform¬ 
ing differently and thus previous studies on sex differences in problem 
solving have been included. 


Evaluation 

This review of related studies reports no research directly 
comparable to the present study. It does, however, summarize earlier 
findings on which this study is based. 

It deals with the following factors influencing reasoning and 
problem solving behavior: 

1. The importance of meaning.

2. The role of verbal behavior and symbolism. 

3. The relative importance of oral and written language. 

4. The influence of set, rigidity and flexibility. 

5. The place of critical thinking and logical reasoning. 

6. Sex differences. 

7. The complexity of the variables involved in this type of mental 
activity. 

The planning and execution of the present study was influenced by 
the research in each of these areas. The fact that the earlier studies 
did not yield definitive answers to the problems which this study 
attempts to solve is, probably, its strongest justification.

CHAPTER III 


THE RESEARCH PLAN: RATIONALE, DEFINITIONS, 

AND EXPERIMENTAL HYPOTHESES 

The study of the relationship between oral and written performance 
in school activities requires an academic setting or orientation. After 
preliminary experimentation it was decided to use the solving of reason¬ 
ing problems as the activity in which these types of performance could be 
studied. In particular, it was decided to employ Burt’s Reasoning Test 
(Appendix A) with students drawn from grades four and five. To clarify 
the approach to the study, this chapter attempts to establish a rationale, 
to define the terms which will be employed, and to state the specific 
problems to which answers are sought. 

Rationale 

When we attempt to provide a theoretical basis for the discussion 
of differences between oral and written performance in the solution of 
reasoning problems, we are obliged to give some attention to develop¬ 
mental theories of intelligence and to consider in particular the theoret¬ 
ical position of Piaget. 

Piaget postulates the existence of a maturational sequence which 
is characterized by an increasing ability to reason about situations 
independent of actual sensory contact. During the period of "informal 
operations,” which Piaget confines to the age interval from 7 to 11 years, 

(l)Recent experimenters, while supporting the hypothesis of a 
maturational sequence in logical operations, have disputed the validity 
of the concept of rigid age boundaries.

the child is able to reason only about situations which are immediately 
present, while in the later "formal operations" stage, there evolves the 
capacity to deal imaginatively with systems not actually present. At 
the same time the physical presence of the system being reasoned about 
renders the reasoning process easier even at the formal operations stage. 

Translating into the language of this thesis, it would appear 
that there occurs a maturational increase in the capacity to reason 
orally (i.e., without such auxiliary aids as a pencil to draw diagrams 
or to otherwise reduce the complexity of the problem). However, the 
mature adult who can utilize the writing technique effectively renders 
mental problems easier through his ability to represent these problems 
in a manner which brings them closer to direct sensory contact. Thus 
the drawing of an adequate diagram dispenses with the necessity of 
retaining a complex configuration in memory, and writing down intermediate 
steps of a complex argument again reduces the memory load. There can be 
no question of the superiority of written over oral performance at the 
upper end of the maturational scale. 

A somewhat more complex picture emerges at the lower end of the 
scale. In the first place, the child begins to speak several years be¬ 
fore he begins to write, so that whatever logical behavior is exhibited 
in this period is of necessity oral rather than written. Consequently, 
oral performance must be superior to written performance in the earlier 
years. As the child matures, the ability to perform orally increases, 
but at the same time the child learns the mechanics of writing and the 
technique of employing written solutions in such a manner as to reduce

the mental effort required in the solving of problems. Consequently, 
somewhere between the oral superiority of the logical behavior of the 
earlier years and the written superiority of the later years we may 
expect to find a point at which the child is equally effective in the 
oral and written techniques. Thus as the child moves toward this point 
we could hypothesize the existence of a decrease in oral superiority and 
the gradual emergence of equal effectiveness. 

The situation is further complicated by the assumed differential 
in maturational development between the sexes, and such sex differences 
as may exist in reasoning ability. Since it is usually contended that 
females are somewhat in advance of males with respect to the maturational 
sequence, we might expect that any cross-sectional sample, at a specific 
age or grade, would show the females to have made greater progress toward 
equal effectiveness in the oral and written techniques. 

The discussion so far has dealt solely with what the student is 
able to do in terms of oral or written procedures, what we might term his 
logical output. There is the further question of the assessment of this 
output. In this respect, school situations may be roughly divided into 
two categories. In the first category are subjects such as mathematics 
where assessment of the logical product involves primarily a considera¬ 
tion of the correctness or incorrectness of the argument. In the second 
category, embracing such situations as essay writing, no absolute stand¬ 
ard of right and wrong exists and assessment of the student*s product is 
made on the basis of the judged adequacy of the arguments advanced. Since 
the female tends to possess a greater facility in the use of language, we

might expect that her verbal report of an argument would receive a higher 
assessment than that of a male with an equal logical grasp of the prob¬ 
lem* 

From this discussion emerge several experimental hypotheses which 
will be elaborated in the following sections. 

Definition of Terms 

(1) Oral Score (0). Oral score refers to the number of problems 
in Burt’s Reasoning Test correctly solved by oral report by each pupil. 

(2) Written Score (W). Written score refers to the number of 
problems correctly solved by written report by each pupil. 

(3) Derived Scores, (a) Oral + Written, or 0+W score refers to 
the sum of the correct oral and written scores for each pupil, (b) Oral- 
Written, or 0-W score refers to the difference for each pupil when the 
written is subtracted from the oral score. 

Subjects whose 0 scores exceed their W scores will be said to b© 
orally dominant . Subjects whose 0 scores are equal to their W scores 
will be called equidominant . Subjects whose W scores exceed their 0 
scores will be classified as written dominant students. 

(4) Interviewer’s Rating Score . Each answer, whether oral or 
written, was evaluated for adequacy on a five point scale. Adequacy is 
defined as the completeness of the report from the point of view of its 
thoroughness or adequacy in explaining the solution obtained. This 
rating was not completely determined by the correctness or incorrectness 
of the answer to the problem.

Restatement of the Problem 


To ensure clarity and to give direction to the experimental 
procedures, the problem has been divided into a series of subproblems 
expressed as hypotheses* 

: There exist sex differences in the 0, W and 0*W scores. 

H 2 : Oral performance (0) is to some extent different from written 
performance (W). 

Hjj : With advance in age and grade the reasoning activity involved in 
problem solving changes from a state of oral dominance in the direction 
of equidominance. 

H 4 : Since females are assumed to be more mature, they -will tend to 
exhibit a greater progress away from oral dominance in the direction of 
equi dominance. 

Hg : The oral reports given by girls for correct solutions tend to be 
rated more highly than the oral reports for corresponding correct 
solutions given by boys. 

Hg : Written as opposed to oral dominance is positively related to 
intelligence and achievement.

RESEARCH INSTRUMENTS AND ADMINISTRATION 

The research instruments used in this study and the specific 
details governing their administration require some clarification. 
Burt’s Reasoning Test was selected as being most suitable for the com¬ 
parison of competence in oral and written verbalization of solutions 
to tests of reasoning. The Clover Bar Testing Program provided excel¬ 
lent data concerning the intelligence and achievement of the pupils in 
the experimental population. 


Sample 

It was decided to use pupils drawn from grades four and five as 
the experimental population. At this level, the mechanics of writing 
could be expected to be reasonably well mastered by all pupils. On the 
other hand, it was hoped that, in these grades, the imposition of formal 
statements and solutions in problems of Arithmetic and Science would not 
have structured or formalized greatly the nature of the pupil’s oral or 
written responses. The sample was drawn from schools in the Clover Bar 
School Division because of the wide variety of data which would be 
available for the students arising out of the current Clover Bar School 
Survey reported by Black (1958). The grade four and five population of 
the three schools chosen, Ellerslie-Mill Creek, Campbellton, and Fort 
Saskatchewan, consisted of three hundred four pupils and comprised 
approximately half the grade four and five students of the school division.

The Instruments and Data 

It was decided to have each pupil work alone with the experi¬ 
menter and alternately solve problems of similar difficulty with oral 
and written procedures. These problems were paired in order of ascend¬ 
ing difficulty and were taken from Burt’s Graded Reasoning Test, Short 
Form No. 29 (1922), which is included in Appendix A. After consulta¬ 
tion with the classroom teachers prior to the study, the wording of the 
original items was changed slightly to make them more compatible with 
local language practice. 

Burt’s Reasoning Test 

Burt’s Reasoning Test (1922) consists of brief questions preceded 
by the data necessary for answering them. From the premises given the 
solution of each problem can be deduced by ordinary logical inference. 

No special knowledge is required apart from that which can be presumed 
common to all normal children at the ages tested. There are seventeen 
problems in all, the first of which is a practice problem and is used to 
familiarize the subjects with the type of question to follow. They are 
arranged in order of difficulty and allocated in groups to successive 
mental ages, two to each mental age level, from ages seven to fourteen 
years. Each problem is assigned to the age group at which fifty per 
cent of the children can successfully answer it. Age is taken as age 
at last birthday. 

This test was chosen because there were two problems of equal

difficulty for each year, and thus one problem could be solved by oral 
explanation and the comparable problem by a written solution accompanied 
by a written statement of the method by which the solution was achieved* 
Very minor changes were made by substituting place names, objects, and 
activities more appropriate to the Canadian scene: "Jasper” for "Geneva," 
"mud” for "clay,” "dime” for "sixpence,” and "ball" for "cricket," The 
test was administered by having each pupil read each question aloud. He 
was then given the opportunity to ask about the meaning of any word or 
phrase. He was not told to solve a question by either procedure until 
the experimenter had reason to suppose that he understood all the facts 
which had been given. Thus the Reasoning Test permitted a record and a 
comparison of a pupil’s proficiency in solving problems under the two 
procedures. Two separate scores, designated as oral scores and written 
scores, were achieved by adding the number of problems correctly solved 
by means of the oral and the written methods. An oral-written dominance 
score was obtained by subtracting the written score from the oral score. 

The Observers’ Rating Scale 

The rating scale used in this study (Appendix B) was developed 
from the literature on problem solving. The survey of previous studies 
revealed that problem solving could be appraised according to "method,” 
as was done by Burack (1950), or could be investigated through the 
difficulties met or the errors made, as was done in the experiments of 
Bloom and Broder (1950) and others. For this study the latter alter¬ 
native was chosen as the one most likely to yield the type of informs-

tion sought. The rating scale is thus a check list of difficulties met 
or errors made. Refined through experimental use, it permitted the 
rating of both oral and written explanations of how the problem was 
solved as "excellent, w "good," "fair," "below fair," and "poor." Each 
experimenter had ample training in the use of the rating scale prior to 
the study, and data relative to the reliability of the raters* use of 
the scale are presented in a later chapter. 

Otis Intelligence Test 

The Otis Quick Scoring Mental Ability Test (Beta) for grades four 
to nine was used in the Glover Bar School Testing Program, and its scores 
were incorporated in this study. These tests have the advantage, as 
claimed by the publisher, that the score is not materially affected by 
the amount or quality of reading skill of the pupil. The test is com¬ 
posed of multiple choice items graduated in difficulty from familiar and 
concrete to more abstract problems. 

SCAT-STEP Tests 

The tests used in the Clover Bar Testing Program were those of 
the SCAT-STEP Series. The School and College Ability Tests (SCAT) con¬ 
sist of two tests yielding three scores. SCAT Verbal is designed to 
measure ability to understand sentences and give the meaning of words— 
an ability closely related to school success in English, foreign 
languages, and Social Studies. SCAT Quantitative is designed to measure 
ability to perform operations with numbers and to solve mathematics

problems stated in words. This ability is closely connected with school 
success in mathematics and science. SCAT Total is a single score 
designed to give the best single prediction of general capacity to do 
the work of the next higher level of learning. 

The Sequential Tests of Educational Progress (STEP) are a recent¬ 
ly published series of achievement tests with a new approach. They are 
designed to measure critical skills through applications of learned 
principles and generalizations in six major academic areas including 
Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Writing, Listening, and Reading. 
The Essay Test, which is part of the battery, is a standardized test of 
demonstrated writing skill and provides a score comparable to the other 
STEP tests. These are specifically designed to measure the ability of 
students to use what they have learned in the classroom in the solving 
of problems in the specified subject fields. 

A major advantage of the SCAT-STEP series, particularly for their 
use in this study, was the fact that the converted scores on all tests 
permitted easy comparisons from test to test without further statistical 
treatment. 


Clover Bar Survey Data 

The last instrument was the Clover Bar School Survey Student Data 
Assembly Sheet (Appendix C). This sheet was filled in for each pupil by 
the classroom teacher. There were six major subdivisions of information 
thus supplied. The identifying data included name, age, sex, birthplace 
of pupil and parents, as well as languages spoken in the home. The

family section yielded information concerning parental and sibling 
membership in the home as well as the length of time the home had been 
in the present locality, and the ownership of home, car, or T.V. The 
educational data dealt with age of school entrance, school progress, 
school attendance, and whether the pupil had changed schools frequently. 
The economic division dealt with the occupation of the parents, location 
of place of employment, and financial return. The medical section 
covered features considered as having an influence on school performance, 
which, unlike the other information, was provided by the Ledue-Strath- 
cona Health Unit. The final section permitted the rating of each of six 
prominent behavior characteristics on a five-point scale ranging from 
"slight” to "very marked." The characteristics were social participa¬ 
tion, aggressiveness, honesty, truthfulness, cooperativeness, and 
emotional stability. 

Test Administrators 

The five test administrators who worked on this study shared 
common backgrounds in that all were former teachers. All had taught 
English, and two were former school principals. The fifth had been 
teaching until less than three months before this study began. Each 
had shared in the various phases of preparation for the testing program, 
in the choice of the Reasoning Test, the improvement of the rating scale 
and techniques of administration, and the various test trials of the 
scale. Procedures of administration and scoring were the results of 
much cooperative effort. Many sessions were devoted to securing

uniformity in use of the rating scale in order to permit precise classi¬ 
fication of the oral and written reports. Little time was needed to 
decide upon any latitude of permissible variation in acceptable solutions. 
Tentative regulations were drawn up governing the initial motivation of 
each pupil and the maintenance of the necessary rapport. The extent of 
explanatory remarks by the experimenters, as well as all details of 
administration which could be foreseen, were tentatively defined. All 
were familiar with the objectives of the testing and the anticipated 
difficulties attending administration. The few additional questions 
which arose during the testing program were easily settled by group 
agreement as they came up. Each pupil solved problems alternately by 
oral and written report until the sixteen problems were solved or three 
consecutive failures had occurred.

CHAPTER V 


RESEARCH DESIGN—PROCEDURES 

The first step of the study was to secure an adequate sample. 
Through the kind cooperation of Mr. L. A. Walker, Superintendent of 
Clover Bar School Division, No. 13, the grade four and five classes 
of Ellerslie-Mill Creek, Campbellton, and Fort Saskatchewan were made 
available for testing. These schools furnished a sample of 304 pupils 
which included approximately fifty per cent of the total grade four and 
five population of the division. An explanatory letter was composed by 
the experimenter which was sent to all principals and teachers involved. 
Before the beginning of the testing period in the schools a personal 
visit was made to meet the principals and teachers in order to explain 
any features of administration which might temporarily interrupt class¬ 
room instruction. 


Administration 

Within the facilities provided in each school, the experimenters 
worked individually with each pupil. Preliminary plans for promoting 
rapport were very successful. On frequent occasions pupils voluntarily 
stayed during recess periods and after school to finish or even to start 
the work. Often they wished to continue trying to solve problems which 
their lack of success at previous levels had shown were beyond their 
ability. The experimenters made doubly clear that the pupil knew that 
his proficiency in oral and written reporting of how he solved each

problem was a primary objective of this study. He was also told that he 
could not be informed whether his solution was correct or incorrect, but 
that he would be stopped when it was certain that he had given a clear 
picture of his performance. While these explanations did little to 
reduce the confidence of the pupil who did well, it probably permitted 
the pupil who did less well to be less displeased with his achievement. 
Each of the experimenters was impressed by the sustained eagerness of 
every pupil to excel. As a consequence, the time spent with each pupil 
averaged between one and two hours. This time permitted maximum per¬ 
formance for every pupil, ranging from the correct solution of only one 
problem for five pupils to the other extreme where two pupils had 
correctly solved fifteen problems and one had solved the entire sixteen. 

The order of administration was such that a pupil who reported 
orally how he worked out a given problem would next write out how he 
solved the succeeding problem. The first problem was a trial problem, 
permitting the experimenter to check on the degree of rapport established, 
the pupil’s understanding of the directions which he had been given, and 
his understanding of the completeness of the explanations which were re¬ 
quired. The succeeding problems were paired according to difficulty. 

Thus, questions two and three were at the seven year level of difficulty, 
questions four and five were at the eight year level, and, finally, 
questions sixteen and seventeen were at the fourteen year level. An 
illustrative order in which the problems were solved by a pupil would be 
question two with oral report on how the problem was solved, questions 
three and four with written report, questions five and six with oral

report, and so on. 

The next pupil would solve question two with written report, 
questions three and four with oral report, questions five and six with 
written report. Thus, each question had as many potential oral solvers 
as written solvers. As each pupil worked orally on a problem the 
experimenter used the check list to maintain a record of that perform¬ 
ance, In addition, comments were made concerning anything descriptive 
of a pupil’s characteristic performance not covered by the check list* 
When a pupil finished the oral solution of a question his rating was 
recorded at once; evaluation of the written reports was completed later. 

When a pupil worked on a problem involving a written report his 
performance was likewise checked on the check list, but appraised later 
as to quality. The correctness of the solution in both circumstances, 
however, was always marked immediately. 

Thus, at the end of a pupil’s problem solving session there was 
one descriptive sheet on his performance for each problem attempted. 
These sheets were used later in a qualitative analysis of problem 
solving performance. 


Rating Consistency 

Yarious means were employed to ensure consistency in the marking 
of the different experimenters. Besides certain preliminary precautions, 
there were checks on intra-tester and inter-tester consistency. These 
are discussed in turn.

consistent marking included the following: 

(a) The setting up of a definite rating scale to aid in assess¬ 
ment of problem solving performance* 

(b) A review of this scale at the beginning of each day f s testing. 

(c) A preliminary trial run in which all testers took part. 

(d) Periodic comparisons of the assessments of individual per¬ 
formances by all members of the testing team* 

(e) The referring of unusual or unexpected problems of assess¬ 
ment to the judgment of the whole testing team. 

(2) Intra-Tester Consistency * Periodically each tester reassessed 
individual performances which he had scored at an earlier period. In 
the case of verbal solutions, this was made possible through the use of 
tape recordings. Intra-class correlation coefficients (Haggard, 1958) 
between separate markings ranged from .70 to .90 said centred about .80* 
This would indicate that for each interviewer the ratings assigned to 
the same question on successive markings showed a very slight amount of 
variability* Thus it seemed to be a safe assumption that each experi¬ 
menter maintained a consistent rating standard over the experimental 
period. 

(3) Inter-Tester Consistency . A further important consideration is 
the consistency among the individual testers in rating individual 
performances. In this respect periodic remarkings of the performances 
of individual pupils in both oral and written solutions by all members 
of the group were undertaken. Intra-class correlation coefficients

again clustered about .80 indicating that the variability in the rating 
of individual questions by the separate interviewers was small. 

In summary, it appeared that the formal rating sheet together 
with the precautionary methods employed resulted in a self consistency 
among the several testers and a consistency of rating between the 
interviewers which was adequate for the purposes of the experiment.

CHAPTER VI 


ANALYSIS OF GROUP PERFORMANCE ON BURT’S REASONING TEST 

The purpose of this chapter is an analysis of the scores on 
Burt’s reasoning tests in order to test certain experimental hypotheses 
which were advanced in Chapter III. 

H]_: There exist sex differences in the 0, W and OfW scores. 

Hg: With advance in age and grade the reasoning activity involved in 
problem solving changes from a state of oral dominance in the direction 
of equidominance. 

H 4 : Since females are assumed to be more mature, they will tend to 
exhibit a greater progress away from oral dominance in the direction 
of equidominance. 

A further hypothesis was added for completeness: 

H^: There exist grade differences in mean 0, W, 0-W, and OfW scores. 

Preliminary Statistical Analysis 

(1) Distribution of Scores 

Table I presents the distributions of raw 0, W, and OfW scores as 
well as the distribution of the 0-W scores increased by a constant of 10. 
The constant, added to simplify subsequent calculations, changed the 0-W 
values from their initial range of -5 to +0 to a final range of +5 to 
*fl5. On the corrected distribution a score below 10 indicated that the 
written score of the student had exceeded his oral score, while a score 
above 10 indicated the superiority of the oral over the written score.

(2) Tests of Normality 

Two motives prompted the testing of the individual distributions 
on Table I for normality. In the first place, Burt’s test purports to 
measure reasoning ability, a trait which one would expect to be normally 
distributed in the general population. Thus the normality or non¬ 
normality of the distributions is of interest in its own right. More¬ 
over, many of the subsequent statistical tests assume that the variables 
involved are normally distributed. 

When the test described by Walker and Lev (1950) was employed, 
the null hypothesis that the distribution does not depart from normality 
was rejected for all but one of the distributions at the .01 level. On 
the other hand, a study of the observed frequency distributions revealed 
that they tended to be platykurtic or leptokurtic rather than skewed and 
that the deviations from normality did not appear to be radical. Under 
these circumstances it was decided to treat the departure from normality 
as falling within the permissible range (Kenny and Keeping, 1951), and 
it was further decided to employ the more powerful t-tests to test 
significance of difference. 


(3) Test of Significance of Mean Differences and Differences in Variability 

Means and standard deviations were computed for the four variables 
0, W, 0+W, 0—W, and are presented in Table II. 

The significance of mean differences and of differences in varia¬ 
bility were made by employing t-tests.'*' The results may be summarized as 


^-The question of the strength of the scale provided by the reason¬ 
ing variables (and the 0-W variable in particular) is somewhat debatable. 
Parametric tests, which include the t-test, assume that the variables in 
question are measured on an interval or ratio scale. The general plan in 
this thesis was to employ parametric statistics as a first test for 
significant differences and to retest borderline cases using a non-parametric 
statistic. In the present case the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (Siegel, 1956) 
was used to recheck the significance of mean differences.

follows: 

(1) All grade five mean scores, oral, written, and combined 
(OfW), were significantly greater than the corresponding grade four 
scores at the .01 level of confidence. 

(2) No significant differences were found between male and 
female mean scores for 0, W, or 0+W within either grade level. At 
the same time, the boys showed a slight superiority in oral scores at 
both grade levels while the girls showed a slight superiority in 
written scores at the grade four level. 

(3) The grade four male 0, 0+W and 0-W scores were significant¬ 
ly more variable (at the .05 level of confidence) than the corresponding 
grade four female scores. All other differences in variability were not 
significant. 

(4) There were no significant differences in the 0-W scores 
either between grades or between sexes. 

The tests of the experimental hypothesis thus led to the accept¬ 
ance of H 7 , namely that grade differences exist between 0, W, and 0+W, 
and while the other hypotheses were not sustained at the .05 level, 
several supporting pieces of evidence were noted in the data. 

(a) The grade four males were orally dominant to the extent that 
the difference between mean oral scores and mean written scores approached 
significance at the .05 level. At the same time the difference between 
mean oral and written scores for males at the grade five level was not 
significant and was appreciably smaller. Thus a movement toward equi- 
dominance is apparent here. 

(b) A similar movement was observed for the females, who seemed 
to have almost attained equidominance by grade five. 


Further Examination of Hypotheses H 3 and Bq, 

The significance tests provided some supporting evidence for 
hypotheses Hg and H 4 . A further study was made by dividing the population 
into equidominance (fO-Wf<2) and non-equidominance (J0-Wl£2) groups.

*The distribution here was that of the reduced sample for which 
complete data were available. 


A further statistical analysis of the tabulated results employing

revealed the following results: 

(1) The proportion of grade five students found in the equi- 
dominance group was significantly larger at the .05 level of confidence 
than the corresponding proportion of grade four students. 

(2) This trend toward equidominance was found for both sexes, 
although the increase in the proportion of students in the equidominance 
group was significant for the females at the .05 level but not signifi¬ 
cant for the males. 

(3) Some evidence was found for the hypothesis that females tend 
to be further advanced in the maturations! trend toward equidominance. 
Not only did the females show a larger initial proportion in the equi¬ 
dominance group at the grade four level, but by grade five they showed a 
significantly greater proportion at the .05 level in the equidominance 
group than did the males* 

In summary, it may be argued that sufficient evidence has been 
advanced to warrant a reasonable belief in the existence of a matura-

CHAPTER VII 


THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE ORAL AND WRITTEN SCORES TO THE RATINGS 
OF PROBLEM SOLVING PERFORMANCE 

Two kinds of measure of problem solving performance were employed 
in this thesis. The first yielded 0 and W scores which measured the 
number of problems solved orally or in writing in a battery of problems 
of increasing difficulty. The second score was not determined by the 
correctness or incorrectness of the answer but rather by the experi¬ 
menter’s assessment of the adequacy of the oral or written report of 
the solution* 

The relationship between these two measures posed certain prob¬ 
lems of theoretical and practical importance. One of these problems was 
raised in Chapter III, where we were led by theoretical considerations 
to suspect that the female’s superior vocabulary and general facility in 
the use of language would allow her to display the logical products of 
her reasoning in a particular problem to greater advantage than a male 
who possessed an equal logical grasp of the problem. 

The data allowed a tentative exploration of this important prob¬ 
lem, The 0 and W scores can be taken as representing the logical ’level’ 
at which the student operates; the rating scores represent the outward 
impression made by the student operating at this particular level. In 
this section three experimental hypotheses were put forward for testing: 

Hg: The oral reports given by girls for correct solutions tend to be 
rated more highly than the oral reports for corresponding correct 
solutions given by boys*

Hq: The written reports given by boys and girls tend to be rated 
equally. 

H 9 : The oral and written reports given by grade five students for 
correct solutions tend to be rated more highly than the oral and 
written reports for corresponding correct solutions given by grade 
four students. 


Procedure and Preliminary Analysis 

Implicit in the definition and employment of the interviewers* 
rating scale is the assumption that its score is not identical with the 
0 and W scores. In other words, it was assumed that the interviewers* 
scale score would not correlate perfectly with the right-wrong assess¬ 
ment of the answer. It is of interest to enquire to what extent the 
measures are correlated, since if the correlation approaches unity, the 
rating scale provides little new information. 

In order to test this relationship, four questions were picked 
at random from the complete battery of 16 problems in Burt*s Reasoning 
Test. For each question, the scores were dichotomized in two dimensions, 
( 1 ) right or wrong, ( 2 ) a rating of fair or above, or a rating below fair 
Phi-coefficients were calculated for each of the four questions and are 
reported in Table IV. 

It is evident that for problems of easy or moderate difficulty 
the assessed quality of the reports of correct solutions is somewhat 
variable, while for difficult problems the quality rating of the reported 
solution is quite clear-cut (either excellent or poor).

Testing H 5 and Hq 

The five categories of the rating scale (poor, below fair, fair, 
good, and excellent) were assigned numerical ratings 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 
respectively. Median values were computed for the ratings given to the 
reports of solutions for problems correctly answered and are reported in 
Tables V and VI. Questions 13 and 16 were combined to give ratings for 
easy, moderately difficult, and difficult problems. 

The significance of the difference between medians was tested in 
each case by the median test (Siegel, 1956), and the results may be 
summarized as follows; 

A 

Separate phi-coefficients were calculated for questions solved 
by the oral or written technique as well as for individual grades. Since 
no marked differences were found, the results were pooled to yield one 
coefficient for each question.

(a) The hypothesis Hq of no sex difference in the written reports 
is supported by the data. The median ratings of correct written solutions 
over the four problems were nearly equal for the males and females. For 
the difficult problems, the median interviewer ratings for males were 
noticeably higher than the median ratings for females, although the small 
numbers precluded the possibility of establishing significance. 

(b) The hypothesis Hg of a sex difference in the oral reports was 
rejected at the .05 level although the median interviewer ratings for the 
female oral solutions exceeded the median ratings of the male oral 
solutions, with the difference approaching significance at the .05 level. 
However, an interesting trend was observed in that while the female 
ratings were significantly higher than the male ratings for the easy 
problems (P<.01), the ratings shifted to the advantage of the males as 
the problems became more difficult. When the oral and written solutions 
were combined, the male ratings for correct solutions to the difficult 
problems were significantly higher than the corresponding female ratings 
with confidence at the .05 level. 

(c) There was a tendency over the four problems to rate oral 
solutions higher than written solutions. The difference in ratings 
between oral and written solutions was significant at the .05 level for 
females and approached the .05 level for males.

Application of the median test revealed the following results: 

(a) The increase in the median rating of oral reports between 
grade four and grade five just failed to reach significance at the *05 
level. 

(b) The increase in the median rating of written reports between 
grades four and five was significant beyond the O 01 level. 

(c) The difference between median ratings for oral and written 
reports is significant at the grade four level (P^.01) but is not 
significant at the grade five level. The movement toward equal ratings 
seemed to parallel the maturational movement toward equidominance which 
was observed in the previous chapter. 

Summary 

In this chapter we have examined further the relationship between 
the 0 and W scores and the assessments of the solution of problems 
correctly answered. The 0 and W scores represent the subject’s ability

with the oral or written techniques; the latter score represents the 
subject’s effectiveness in showing the adequacy of his argument. 

A series of phi-coefficients indicated that over the whole 
population, the interviewers 1 assessments of the reports of solutions 
of difficult problems which were correctly answered, using either the 
oral or written report, were invariably high, while the assessments for 
the easier problems showed considerable variability. In addition, the 
females showed a significant superiority in the ability to present 
their oral solutions effectively; a superiority which could be linked, 
in theory, with their supposed superior facility in language usage. 

As the problems become more difficult, this verbal ’halo 1 —which was 
apparently superimposed on the logical framework of the solution—broke 
down, and the males received higher assessments at this level for both 
oral and written arguments. 

A further comparison of median assessments of both grades 
indicated a maturational movement which paralleled that previously 
observed for the 0 and W scores. For not only were the grade five 
assessments for oral and written solutions significantly higher than 
the corresponding grade four assessments, but the movement toward the 
equality of oral and written assessments was also found. 

This chapter is offered as a preliminary introduction to what 
appears to be a very important problem. For the existence of sex and 
maturational differences in the ability to present logical arguments 
effectively has many implications for school and real life situations 
in which one cannot judge logical behavior against a right-wrong

CHAPTER VIII 


QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OP PERFORMANCES ON BURT’S REASONING TEST 

This chapter seeks to examine in greater detail the reasoning 
performance of groups of students displaying different patterns of 
verbal dominance as revealed in the comments and ratings of the 
experimenters* 

It is recalled from the preceding chapters that the performance 
of each student for each item was rated on a special form* A typical 
rating form for one such item is presented in Appendix B. It will be 
noted that besides the indication of the correctness of the response 
the form provides for an evaluation on a five-point scale of the 
student’s overall performance on this particular item and allows space 
for comments by the experimenter. 

This chapter will attempt a preliminary examination of the 
distribution of verbal dominance scores as presented in Figure 1. The 
examination will also review the evidence concerning each pupil recorded 
by the interviewers when the reasoning tests were administered. The 
subsequent chapter will attempt a statistical analysis of the data. 

Graphical Distribution of Verbal Dominance Scores 

It was reasoned that a student with an oral score of seven and a 
written score of five which yielded a verbal dominance score of twelve 
(0 - W f 10) presented a completely different picture than a student who 
had an oral score of two and a written score of zero. Consequently each

score was located on a grid with ascending oral scores on one axis and 
written scores on the other. This device permits graphical representa¬ 
tion of each pupil’s reasoning performance in terms of oral and written 
score and the relationship existing between the two. This distribution 
of scores is presented in Figure 1. 

The oral and written scores ranged from zero to eight permitting 
development of a grid of nine horizontal and nine vertical lines 
enclosing eighty-one cells. For convenience these cells we re regrouped 
into cells four times as large, beginning at the origin. The four 
enlarged cells in the vertical or oral axis were labelled A, B, C, and 
D; the corresponding cells on the horizontal or written axis were 
designated a, b, c, and d. 

The cell identifying low oral coupled with low written perform¬ 
ance is cell Aa, whereas the cell representing superior performance in 
both categories is Dd. A cell with an extremely good oral performance 
but with a poor written score is Da, and so throughout the diagram. The 
figure contains a total of sixteen "cells" or categories indicating vary¬ 
ing degrees of relationship of oral or written dominance. To permit the 
qualitative analysis of problem solving behavior, a random sample of ten 
students was selected from each cell for further study. Where less than 
ten subjects fell in a cell, all cases were used. 

Qualitative Analysis of Cells 

A qualitative analysis was made of the reported problem solving 
behavior of the pupils in each of the sixteen cells in order to deter-

mine characteristic features of similarity and difference. When each 
cell was examined in detail, surprisingly few common characteristics 
were found. In order to accentuate any points of comparison the cells 
were combined in two ways. First, those cells, in which oral and 
written performance were approximately equal, were subjected to careful 
study. The cells involved are Aa, Bb, Cc, and Dd and represent a con¬ 
tinuum of increasing efficiency in problem solving in which the pupils 
are roughly equal in oral and written reasoning scores. Second, a 
contrast was made of the two cells, Ca and Db, which showed the largest 
oral dominance with the two cells, Ac and Bd, which revealed marked 
written dominance. In the interest of clarity the two comparisons will 
be restated. First, what points of similarity or difference characterize 
the four cells which constitute the progressively improving continuum of 
reasoning capacity and in which oral and written dominance are relatively 
equal? Second, what points of similarity or difference are evident when 
the cells which reveal marked oral dominance and written dominance are 
compared? 


Cells of Equal Oral and Written Performance 

Cell Aa comprised scores for eleven pupils falling into the 
following patterns: Oral 0, Written 0; Oral 0, Written 1; Oral 1, 
Written 0, Oral 1, Written 1. There were eleven cases falling in this 
cell of which ten were randomly drawn for detailed description. 

The oral and written reports on cell Aa showed that of all 
problem solutions reported by the entire group, only three received a

broken," and "expression, whether oral or written, seems an effort." 

The group was also considered as "unable to grasp this problem," "unable 
to visualize problem," "unable to deal with all parts of the problem," 
and similar criticisms. In the problem whose correct answer was "Jasper," 
the answer given several times was "I will go to Hawaii because I like 
Hawaii." Yet the problem related to where a friend should go under cer¬ 
tain conditions. On the occasions where diagrams might have been an 
assistance in solutions, detailed pictures were sometimes drawn. 

Cell Bb comprised the scores for fifty-nine pupils which fell 
into the following patterns of oral and written achievement: 2,2; 2,3; 
3,2; 3,3. Of the sixty-two scores, ten cases were randomly selected. 

Since the range in I.Q. points in this group was from 79 to 127, it was 
difficult to make observations that refer to the complete group. Poor 
reading was a general cause of poor answers, as witness the examiners* 
comments of: "read stumbling several times," and "question whether he 
understands what he reads." Another feature which came out even more 
generally was the factor of uncertainty; for example, there were many 
comments such as these: "rereads, but is flighty," "too quick; changes 
answers often," "very nervous, lacks confidence," "slow, then not sure of 
answer," "guesses, rather than works out ... quits too easily," and

"may not be able to keep ideas in mind." There was a common logical 
difficulty that appeared to be indicated also in such comments as 
"disregards facts that didn’t appear easy to incorporate," "often shifts 
to ’some* facts related to own experience," "can’t see problem apart 
from himself," "with harder problems, uses own experiences," "relies on 
own experience," "considers only ’part’ of what was given," "rarely 
gives a full explanation." 

The quality of the reports marked by the examiners showed a 
distribution of ratings which differentiated between this group and the 
group already studied. If we disregard ratings for each pupil on prob¬ 
lems the pupil couldn’t do, we find that the ratings "excellent," "good," 
"fair," "below fair," and "poor" occurred in almost equal proportions for 
the cell as a whole. 

Cell Cc comprised scores of oral and written achievement of 4,4; 
4,5; 5,4; 5,5; and was the largest, numerically, of all cells having 
sixty-two cases from which the selection was made. The average number 
of problems solved correctly by this group was 8.7. This was above the 
total group average of 7.8. This group was thus slightly above average 
in number of correctly solved problems and almost equal in the number of 
problems solved with oral report and written report. 

The supplementary comments again failed to indicate clearly defined 
common attributes. The brightest and the dullest pupils in the group did 
have some similarity. Some of the comments on the brightest were, 
"nervous, false starts, omits too much;" critical comments included, 
"changes mind too often, uses diagrams but lacks confidence."

The examiners 1 comments appeared to deal with two common aspects 
of the cell population. First, they seemed to praise good work, and, 
second, they appeared to describe clearly a common weakness in perform¬ 
ance. Illustrations were: "careful logic, usually illustrated or 
diagrammed," "beautiful argument, yet occasionally misses a ’part* that 
was given," "good, but too short, thus a part is omitted," "very fluent, 
but omits what should be said," "incomplete too often; could have ex¬ 
plained more." A final comment has been met in previous sections, "when 
stuck he substitutes his own experience for something similar." 

Cell Dd comprising scores of 6,6; 6,7; 7,6; 7,7, is composed of 
scores of individuals found in row 6 column 6 and row 7 column 7. (See 
Figure I.) To avoid omission of children whose scores fell in row 8 
column 8, cell Dd was enlarged, bringing its total to twenty-three rather 
than nineteen cases. From this total a sample of ten was drawn for 
further study. 

The quality of the oral and written answers was generally very 
good. From a total of 160 answers ninety-one were marked "excellent," 
twenty-seven marked "above average," eleven marked "average," nine 
"below average," and twenty-two were marked as "poor." The supplementary 
comments of the examiners revealed considerable diversity. There was 
general agreement that diagrams were used very effectively and that the 
elimination of extraneous or incorrect possibilities was very adequately 
done. Reading was commented on with such phrases as "quick reader," 

"slow careful reader," "indicates quick understanding." Writing received 
the comments "very slow writer," "good penmanship," "writing is rapid,

uses language fluently,” "beautiful composition,” "speaks ungrammatically, 
writes well*” The quality of logic exhibited drew frequent comment, for 
example, "clear thinker,” "systematic,” "logical in excluding wrong 
possibilities," "clear explanations," "exact treatment," "eliminates each 
in turn,” and similar phrases. 


Summary 

This section attempted to discover the trend of student performance 
in the continuum of four cells: Aa, Bb, Cc, and Dd, in each of which oral 
and written performance was relatively equal for each pupil, and in which 
from cell to cell reasoning scores steadily improved. It has sought to 
determine the relationship of each student’s actual score to the 
examiners 1 evaluation of his problem solving behavior on the reasoning 
test. The quantitative performance expressed as a relationship of oral 
to written scores had been used to group students for analysis in Figure 
I. 

For students whose oral performance was approximately equal to 
their written performance, i.e., their scores indicated no definite 
"oral or written dominance" in problem solving, the expected improvement 
from the low performance to high performance groups was reflected in the 
examiners 1 ratings of the "quality of problem solving." The examiners’ 
supplemental comments on the rating form seemed to suggest steady im¬ 
provement in efficiency on the part of successful problem solvers while 
the unanimous comment on the poor problem solving group was "poor read¬ 
ing ability” and "reading without meaning." The examiners usually didn’t

specify the particular reading difficulty. Speed of reading was apparent¬ 
ly not a factor as both slow reading and rapid reading were associated 
with both successful and unsuccessful solutions in each cell. 

Logical treatment of the problem seemed to occupy space in all 
reports. The examiners* comments suggest steady improvement in logic 
through the sequence of cells from Aa to Dd. When a single reading did 
not suggest a solution, pupils reread—perhaps made a diagram or illus¬ 
tration, or in some cases a list, so that extraneous items could be elimi¬ 
nated. If the difficulty were more severe the rereading was more frequent 
until, finally, a decision apparently was reached to disregard facts that 
could not be made to fit. Thus, the solution evolved was usually in¬ 
correct or partial. An even more difficult problem produced continuous 
rereading until some one apparently familiar fact stood out and all others 
were disregarded. The most difficult problem of all appeared to produce 
the result that some fact in the problem called to mind a similar fact 
from experience, which then was used as if it bad been included in the 
original problem. 

The above summary, which attempts to evaluate performance along 
the continuum of cells Aa, Bb, Cc, and Dd as reported by the experi¬ 
menters, may be rephrased as follows: 

1. There was steady improvement in quality of performance 
from cell Aa to cell Dd. 

2. In the lower cells the mechanics of reading were poor, 
and reading without meaning resulted. 

3. The quality of logic exhibited improved steadily from

Cells of Unequal Oral and Written Performance 

The next aspect of analysis attempts to find similarities or 
contrasts between the cells showing greatest dissimilarity in oral and 
written performance. Two cells, Ca and Db, comprise the cases where 
oral performance markedly exceeds written performance, while the two 
cells, Ac and Bd, include the cases where the reverse situation prevails. 

A detailed analysis of these cells follows. 

Cell Ca contained scores of 4,0; 4,1; 5,0; 5,1. No scores were 
either 4,0 or 5,0; yet seven were either 4,1 or 5,1. The quality of the 
verbal reports was not considered to be high in this cell. To slightly 
less than one-quarter of the reports did the examiners give values of 
"excellent" or "good." The oral work received this rating more frequently 
than the written work in the ratio of 15:4. A slightly smaller per cent 
of the oral reports received marks of "fair" and "below fair," and the 
ratio of the marks for oral and written work was again in favor of the 
oral work, being 11:5. That is, an oral report was more than twice as 
likely to receive these marks as the written report. 

Comments of the examiners yielded a common criticism of attitude 
toward the problem at hand. Representative ones were,"unsure, rereads 
often," "casual attitude, sure her methods are correct," "a tendency to 
guess, to make false starts," "too brief; thinks this is desirable . . . 
hurries and makes mistakes," "tried to out-wait the examiner for clues, 
etc. . . . seemed to guess a lot.” There were the usual criticisms of

poor logic and failure to include or consider pertinent facts. However, 
the examiners apparently felt that the pertinent factor was an attitude 
of uncertainty and devoted little criticism to other characteristics. 

Cell Db comprised such scores as 6,2; 6,3; 7,2; 7,3; and the 
single score of 8,3. There were eight cases in this cell. These cases 
indicated quite good performance with oral report and noticeably poorer 
performance with written report. 

In this group the examiners appeared reluctant to give "excellent” 
to either the oral or written reports. While the pupils had correctly 
solved over sixty per cent of all the problems on the test, in less than 
one-sixth of the reports was an "excellent" mark given by the examiner. 

Out of almost eighty reports twenty-one oral reports and only one written 
report received this rating. The "good" rating was given to approximately 
twenty-two per cent of the reports with eighteen oral and ten written 
reports receiving this grading. Similarly the intermediate rating of 
"fair" was given to less than seven per cent of all reports. The general 
pattern was to rate the report either "excellent" or "good" on the one 
hand and "poor" on the other. No other cell group showed the same 
dichotomous characteristic. 

A careful perusal of the examiners 1 supplementary comments 
stresses this "all or none" tendency but fails to reveal contributing 
causes or explanatory descriptions of distinctive behavior for this 
cell. l?/hen the pupils made "excellent" or "good" reports it was apparent¬ 
ly for the same reasons that have been previously noted for other cell 
groups. When they failed to do so, the causes were again the common

causes repeatedly referred to above. 

In summary, it may be stated that the examiners 1 rating in each 
of the orally dominant cells, Ca and Db, indicated two common charac¬ 
teristics: 

1, The quality of the report was often poor regardless of 
whether the report was correct or incorrect, 

2. Uncertainty in attack was a common criticism of the pupils 
in these two cells. 

When attention was turned to the written dominant cells, viz, 

Ac and Bd, cell Ac comprised the group which did extremely poorly on 
oral work and better on problems with written report. Typical scores 
were 0,4; 0,5; 1,4; and 1,5; with the oral scores in each pair being 
mentioned before the written scores. Only six pupils had such scores. 

Descriptions of this group were doubly difficult. First, the 
group comprised but six members; and second, the group appeared to con¬ 
tain two separate types. One type made up of two individuals had a 
definitely higher I.Q. rating than the average for the rest of the cell 
group, being 114 and 140 I.Q. points; yet few, if any, of the twelve 
scores on the testing program were superior to the cell average. Their 
work was marked by the examiners as either "excellent” or "poor,” with 
intermediate rankings completely absent for the brighter pupil, and 
almost completely so for the other. The brighter pupil repeatedly drew 
from the examiner an abrupt comment relative to the omission of important 
facts in the given problem. One of the concluding statements of the 
examiner was "very good" or "very bad.” 


In each case the latter rating

was due to the complete disregard of an important aspect of the problem. 
The other pupil was also reported as "doesn’t always read with meaning." 
The fact that emotional as well as poor reading factors may be involved 
is found in "good diagrams, but oh, so hesitant." 

But these comments give no clue as to why, when solving a problem 
with oral report, a pupil of I.Q. 140 should fail to get a single correct 
answer, yet when solving an almost identical problem with written report, 
should each time get the correct answer as well as make an "excellent" 
rating on the description of how it was solved. A further analysis of the 
ratings of the verbal performance and the supplementary comments of the 
examiners shows that none of the remaining pupils received a rating of 
"excellent." Repeatedly the correct answer was accompanied by a "poor" 
report. Comments were "apparently can’t keep details in mind," "quick 
but superficial," "reads one word at a time, considers ’part’ only," 

"goes over and over the same explanation, or gives an answer and no 
explanation." In three cases the poorer pupils were reported as having 
"poor attitude," "hesitant," "when in difficulty substitutes self for 
person involved." 

Cell Bd comprised the typical scores 2,6; 2,7; 3,6; and 3,7; and 
included six cases. These pupils did much better with written report, 
in one case getting two problems correct with oral report and seven 
correct with written report. Few "excellent" gradings were given to 
either written or oral reports. The written reports received a "good" 
rating in the ratio of 16 to 3 when compared to the oral reports. In a

in the ratio of 11 to 1. As marked by the examiners the quality of the 
written reports was thus considered superior to the oral reports. 

The supplementary comments of the examiners were almost unanimous 
in their reference to the efficient use of diagrams. Since the examiners 
were not likely to be aware that more problems were being solved with 
written report than by oral report, no reference to the reason for this 
difference was included. Another general comment related to efficient 
rereading. There were the usual comments regarding incomplete explana¬ 
tions, explanations based upon "part" of the given problem, and instances 
of identification of the pupil and problem. Effort was commented on for 
every pupil. There were phrases like "such a tremendous effort," "tries 
so hard," "very eager to cooperate." At present there seems no reason 
why this should influence written report to a greater extent than oral 
report. 

The examiners' comments of the above two cells of written dominance 
indicate two salient features: 

1. "Excellent" or "good" ratings were seldom given. 

2. An attitude of uncertainty in the pupils characterized the 
reasoning performance. 

When the two groups, Ga and Db, of greater oral problem solving 
success were compared with the two groups, Ac and Bd, of greater written 
problem solving ability, it was noticed that features of similarity stood 
out. The first of these is that of attitude. For both cell Ca and cell. 
Ac there was the common statement by the experimenters of insecure atti¬ 
tude while problem solving. Cell Bd students seemed to impress the

examiners strongly with their desire to do well, to please, and to co¬ 
operate. 

The ratings of both oral and written reports for the cells Ca and 
Ac were again similar. In very few cases were "excellent” or "good” 
ratings given. In nearly all cases the experimenters considered that the 
logic exhibited was very weak, in spite of the correct solutions achieved 
thereby. 

Cells Db and Bd, of slightly better performance, were also similar 
to the previous two cells as regards attitude, logic exhibited in both 
oral and written reports, and ratings received. In spite of success in 
solving problems, the pupils appeared uncertain and the quality of their 
oral and written reports indicated a hesitancy in expression. There was 
evidence of understanding in the efficient diagrams developed, but 
expressions of logic were otherwise poor. It is thereby concluded that 
where differences in oral and written problem solving ability exist, they 
are accompanied by feelings of uncertainty frequently taking the form of 
a tendency to guess. As a consequence the reasons given for a solution 
are generally fragmentary or incorrect. 

Summary 

A brief recapitulation of the comparison of performance in cells 
of equal oral and written dominance follows: 

1. There was a steady improvement in quality of performance 
and quality of ratings of both types of verbal report from 
the poorest to the best.

2. There was a progression from poor reading in the lowest cells 
to efficient reading in the highest cells. 

3. A similar improvement in the quality of logic exhibited was 
revealed from the lowest cell Aa to the highest cell Dd. 

The cells of unequal oral and written dominance yielded two out¬ 
standing similarities and no outstanding dissimilarities. 

1. In all cells, high ratings were infrequently given by the 
examiners. 

2. A common attitude of uncertainty, perhaps a tendency to 
guess, was exhibited in each of the four cells.

CHAPTER IX 


THE RELATIONSHIP OF ACHIEVEMENT PERFORMANCE ON THE 
CLOVER BAR TESTING PROGRAM TO PERFORMANCE ON 
BURT , S REASONING TESTS 

In this chapter three distinct and separate studies were made of 
the relationship between performance on Burt’s Reasoning Test and tests 
of intelligence and achievement included in the Clover Bar Testing Pro¬ 
gram. Again the data were organized on the axes of oral and written 
dominance employed in Figure 1 in the previous chapter which permitted 
the quantitative comparison of cells representing groups of pupils of 
varying degrees of oral and written dominance. 

The four problems to be studied included: 

1. A general exploration of the relationships existing between 
reasoning scores and scores on the Clover Bar Testing Program. 

2. A study of the intelligence and achievement of the four 
levels of equal oral and written dominance on the continuum 
of reasoning scores. 

3. A comparison of the intelligence and achievement of the 
markedly orally dominant and the markedly written dominant 
groups. 

A General Evaluation of the Relationship Between Reasoning Scores 
and Scores of Intelligence and Achievement 


At this stage a comparison was made of pupil performance on Burt’s

Reasoning Tests and achievement on the Clover Bar Testing Program 
variables. Since in Figure 1 in the preceding chapter a pupil’s oral 
and written scores had already assigned him to a cell location indica¬ 
tive of his oral and written performance, the procedure was to compute 
the mean performance of all pupils within each cell on each of the Clover 
Bar Testing Program variables. The next step was to discover whether 
such means differed from the total group means on each variable. It was 
noted that two cells indicating extremely poor oral and good written per¬ 
formance (Ad) and good oral and poor written performance (Da) had no 
cases. The data are reported in Table VIII. 

In the above table oral performance holds constant in the first 
four rows, while written performance has improved from row to row. In 
the next four rows oral performance has again held constant at a higher 
level, while written performance has varied. A similar pattern has been 
observed in the remainder of the table. If performance is divided so 
that rows 2 to 9 refer to low oral performance and rows 10-17 refer to 
high oral performance, certain relationships become more apparent. It 
is obvious that chronological age does not appear to be a dominant factor 
in performance. When the I.Q. column is referred to it is apparent that 
every mean of the low oral performing group is below the total group 
mean, while only one mean of the high oral performing group is similarly 
below the average of the total group. 

An almost identical picture is revealed for the three SCAT scores. 
The low performing oral group is usually below the total mean while the 
high performing oral group is above the total mean. There is of course

a general increase in SCAT scores and I.Q. scores which accompanies 
improvement in good oral and written performance. 

Similar comparisons are revealed when the three STEP scores on 
Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies are compared to the three SCAT 
scores just mentioned. On a numerical basis the low performing oral 
group contains ten cell means which are significantly lower at the .01 
level than the total mean, while the three STEP scores contain eleven 
means which are significantly lower at the .01 level of confidence. 

In the high performing oral group there are six cell means 
significantly higher than the total group means for the SCAT scores, 
and three lower and ten higher at .01 level in the STEP scores. 

The communication scores appear to show similar but less vivid 
relationships between performances in the low oral and high oral groups. 
As in the previous comparisons no group mean is significantly higher for 
the low oral group than the total group mean. Yet the high performing 
oral group does not show as much superiority over the total group as 
might be expected. This high performing oral group had in the Writing 
scores two means significantly lower, and two significantly higher; in 
the Listening scores one mean significantly lower and three significantly 
higher; in the Essay scores one mean significantly lower and one mean 
significantly higher; and in the Reading scores two significantly lower 
and three significantly higher. All comparisons were at the .01 level 


of confidence

Comparison in Cells Having Equal Oral and Written Performance 

As illustrated in Figure 1, cells Aa, Bb, Cc and Dd contain 
students of approximately equal oral and written performance. The num¬ 
ber of correctly solved problems increases steadily from cell to cell, 
ranging from one or two correct solutions in Cell Aa to the highest 
performance in Cell Dd. 

A comparison reveals that the cell means for I.Q., C.A., SCAT, 
and STEP scores show progressive increases from cell Aa to Dd in all 
cases save for chronological age, and for Writing scores at the first 
two levels. The SCAT scores are more noticeably increased than the 
STEP scores on Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies, and somewhat 
less than the communication scores of Writing and Essay, Specifically 
a comparison of the last three lines of the preceding table illustrates 
that cell Bb has higher mean performance than cell Aa on Mathematics, 
Science, Social Studies, Listening, and Essay with confidence at the .01 
level. When compared to cell Bb, cell Cc makes mean marks which are 
higher with significance always at the .01 level. When compared with 
cell Cc, cell Dd has very slightly, but not significantly higher marks 
on the Otis Intelligence Test, and significantly higher marks with con¬ 
fidence at the .01 level on all academic tests with the sole exception 
of Essay. 

It may thus be concluded that when groups are selected at four 
levels of the equal dominance continuum they reveal progressively rising 
scores for I.Q., for V, Q, and T, SCAT scores and for all STEP achieve¬ 
ment scores save for ?<Triting in the first two levels. These increases

comparisons shown in Table IX and confirm the association between 
intelligence (Otis), academic capacity (SGAT), and achievement (STEP) 
and rising scores on the continuum of even or equal oral and written 
Reasoning scores. 

Comparisons of Cells Indicating Unequal Oral and Written Performance 

The following comparisons deal with unequal oral and written 
performance. Cells Ca and Db represent performance in which the oral 
solutions are superior to written solutions. Cells Ac and Bd, on the 
other hand, represent better written performance (Table X). 

?/hen the combined means of the orally dominant group are compared 
to the combined means of the written dominant group they show that the 
oral group is slightly younger, slightly more intelligent and does less 
well on all the tests except Essay and Reading, While none of the 
differences is statistically significant, the group which has written 
dominance tends to be slightly superior except in Essay and Reading, 

The total number of correctly solved problems is almost the same 
for cell Ca and cell Ac, temporarily called "low written” and "low oral" 
respectively. They differ only in the excess of orally solved problems 
over problems solved with written report, or the reverse. The "low 
written" group is slightly younger, less intelligent, and does less well 
on all tests except Essay, with the most noticeable difference being in 
the Qualitative score of the SCAT, Science, Writing, and Listening of 
the STEP series. The Writing difference is in accord with the classifi-

cation of oral dominance. The "low written" means are lower, at the .05 
level, on SCAT Qualitative and on Listening scores. 

A comparison of the means of the Db and Bd cells, temporarily called 
"high oral" and "high written" respectively, reveals that here the "high 
written" group is older, but less intelligent (at the .01 level) and per¬ 
forms better on the test with the single exception of communication scores. 
The "high oral" group do noticeably better than the written group on Essay 
and Reading (at the .05 level). 

If the cells Ga and Ac are classified as low problem solving cells, 
and cells Db and Bd as high problem solving cells, the final two lines of 
the above table may be summarized in two statements: 

1. In the low problem solving group a comparison of the orally 
dominant with the written dominant pupils reveals that the oral pupils 
are younger, less intelligent, do less well on the tests of the SCAT-STEP 
series, with especially low performance on the Writing and Listening 
tests. 

2. In the high problem solving group, the orally dominant pupils 
are younger, but much more intelligent, have relatively the same Verbal, 
Quantitative and Total SCAT scores; and Mathematics, Science, and Social 
Studies STEP scores, yet do much better than the written dominant group 
on the communication tests, particularly on Essay and Reading. 

The above findings must be viewed with caution due to the fact 
that we are attempting to generalize concerning an extremely deviant 
group, and because of the relatively small number of individuals concerned. 

It is thus apparent that where dominance mounts, either oral or

written, the I.c^. and achievement scores fall far below the upper levels 
of the equal dominance group. It may be noted also that the scores of 
the written dominant group are superior to those of the oral dominant 
group in I.Q. and achievement, save for Essay and Reading. While the 
above conclusions are tentative because of the low number of cases in 
each cell, they bear a relationship to later findings.

CHAPTER X 


THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE REASONING TEST VARIABLES 
AND THOSE OF THE CLOVER BAR SURVEY DATA 

In the preceding chapter the relationship between the achievement 
and intelligence variables of the Clover Bar Testing Program and those 
of the reasoning test were examined. In this chapter it is intended to 
explore the possible relationships between the variables of the Student 
Data Assembly Sheet and reasoning test performance. As in previous 
chapters, this comparison will be done in two stages. First there will 
be a comparison of data from cells of equidominance. Second the data 
from both the orally dominant and the written dominant cells will be 
scrutinized. 


Social and Economic Correlates of Equidominance 

The six major subdivisions of the Clover Bar Survey yielded data 
under the following headings: identification, family, education, 
economic, medical, and behavioral characteristics. These data were 
studied in the effort to identify characteristics which distinguished 
the equidominant group from the orally and written dominant groups. 

Survey Data: Family 

When data of each of the four cells of equidominance were com¬ 
pared, no clear difference was found with regard to birthplace of 
parent. Nor was the use of one or more languages in the home a dis¬ 
tinguishing factor. While the number of brothers and sisters varied 
from cell to cell, they did not do so in any discernible pattern, being

3.4 for cell Dd, 1.9 for cell Cc, 3.8 for cell Bb, and 5.0 for cell Aa. 
This was true for length of residence in the community, employment of 
parents, and ownership of home, car, or T.V. Thus while performance in 
the equidominance group of cells ranged from very low to excellent, none 
of the items referring to family was positively related to success on 
the reasoning test.

Age at school entrance was very much the same for all four 
sections of the equidominance group, with few pupils entering before 
the age of six. While each cell group contained pupils who had repeated 
a grade, there was more likelihood that retardation would be found among 
those who had entered before six years than among those entering at six 
years or older. The number of retarded pupils was greatest in cell Aa, 
each of the other cells containing only one repeater. Whether a family 
had moved from one school section to another had usually not affected 
school progress, but repeated movements were sometimes associated with 
retardation. 

Survey Data: Economic 

The data regarding the occupations of the parents for each of the 
four equidominance cells were quite similar. However, income was below 
|3000 only for cases in the two lowest performing cells. The parent in 
cell Dd seemed slightly more likely to be a proprietor than the parent 
in cell Aa, but in general there was little difference in this respect 


from cell to cell

Survey Data: Medical 

The same uniformity reported in the preceding paragraph was found 
in the medical data. Premature births were rare, being found once in 
cell Aa and once in cell Dd. No cases of visual or hearing defects were 
present. All were negative to the Tuberculin Test. Two cases of enuresis 
were found in each cell group with the sole exception of Cc which had none. 

Social and Economic Correlates of Oral and Written Performance 

Next the two most marked orally dominant cells and the two cells 
of most marked written dominance were examined for patterns of simi¬ 
larity and dissimilarity. Here again no clear picture emerged. This 
might possibly be explained by the small number of cases in each cell. 
Information which appears pertinent is reported below. 

Survey Data: Family 

There was little discernible difference from cell to cell in the 
birthplaces of pupils or their parents. The two orally dominant cells 
contained a slightly larger number of homes in which a second language 
was spoken. Pupils in these same two groups reported more brothers and 
sisters than did those in the written dominant group. The orally 
dominant children appeared to differ from those who were dominant in 
written solutions in length of residence in the community. While the 
children of the orally dominant group frequently belonged to families 
which had recently moved to their present locality, only two families 
in the written dominant cells had changed location. Ownership of home 
and car was the same for both groups. All the families in the written

group owned T.V. sets, but only about two-thirds of the families in the 
oral group. 

Survey Data: Educational 

All cells showed a similar age for school entrance and a similar 
amount of retardation. Several families in the oral group had moved 
from district to district, but only two families in the two written 
cells had lived in another district. The average number of school days 
lost was 7.2 for the oral group and 12.0 for the written group. 

Survey Data: Economic 

The economic data were almost identical for both groups with 
respect to occupation of father and reported family income. Apparently 
orally and written dominant pupils share common economic backgrounds. 

Summary 

The above data reveal the following relationships: 

1. Repeated changes of family residence were frequently associated 
with retardation of the children. 

2. Children of the orally dominant group frequently belonged to 
families which had recently moved to their present locality. 

3. Low income of the parent was found only in the lowest perform¬ 
ing cells of the equidominance group. 

4. All the families in the written dominant group owned T.V. sets, 
as compared to about two-thirds of the families in the orally dominant 


group

CHAPTER XI 


CORRELATIONAL STUDIES OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ORAL AND WRITTEN 
SCORES AND INTELLIGENCE AND ACHIEVEMENT VARIABLES 

This chapter seeks to establish the relationship of a variety of 
academic measures to performance on the oral and written problems of the 
reasoning test. The test score data were obtained from the Clover Bar 
School Survey Testing Program conducted shortly after the administration 
of Burt f s Reasoning Tests was completed. The tests administered to the 
students of grades four and five were: The School and College Achieve¬ 
ment Test (Level 4); The Sequential Tests of Educational Progress: 
Reading, Writing, Listening, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies and 
Essay; and the Otis Quick-Scoring Tests of Mental Ability (Form Beta). 
This provided twelve variables to which chronological age was added 
making a total of thirteen. 

The Reduced Sample, Means and Standard Deviations 

Complete scores from the Clover Bar Testing Program were available 
for 265 of the 301 students in the original sample. Means and standard 
deviations for the thirteen variables are presented by sexes in Table XI. 

Tests for significance of mean differences and for differences in 
variability between the complete sample of 301 and the reduced sample of 
265 pupils failed to reveal any significant difference either in means or 
standard deviations. It was therefore concluded that the reduced group 
adequately represented the original sample.

Zero Order Correlations Between Intelligence, 

Achievement, and Reasoning Variables 

The intercorrelations of the thirteen variables for the combined 
male and female groups are recorded in Table XII. 

Several observations may be made with respect to this table: 

(a) The correlation between 0 and W over the whole group was .55, 
indicating that approximately 30$ of the variance was common to the two 
variables. The absence of a high correlation between 0 and W offers 
support for experimental hypothesis Hg (Chapter III) of the partial 
independence of the logical processes underlying 0 and W. The 0 and W 
correlations with Otis I.Q>. were not high, .44 and .38 respectively. It 
is apparent that intelligence itself does not play a dominant role in the 
psychological processes involved in the reasoning scores. 

(b) The average correlations^of the four reasoning scores with 
intelligence and achievement variables are as follows: (1) t q m .48, 

(2) r w s .50, (3) r Q+w = .58, (4) r Q-w r *03. It would appear that oral 
dominance (or written dominance) in itself is not highly related to the 
standard intelligence or achievement variables used in this study. 

(c) The correlations of the 0 and W scores with the other tests 
yielded almost identical coefficients indicating that none of the standard 
tests employed here required one ability to a greater extent than the 
other. 

(d) The low (non-significant) correlations of C.A. with the four 
reasoning variables indicated that G.A. was not an important factor in 

^In each case, correlations were averaged by converting to 
Fisher’s Z.

the determination of these scores within the restricted age range of this 
sample. 

The intercorrelations were next computed individually by sexes, 
in the hope of uncovering sex differences. The results are presented in 
Tables XIII and XIV. 

The most prominent relationship found in these tables may be 
listed as follows: 

(a) Ten of the twelve 0 correlations were higher for the males 
than for the females. Although differences in individual coefficients 
were not significant, the null hypothesis that the two samples were 
drawn from populations in which 0 covaried to the same extent with 
achievement and intelligence variables was rejected at the .05 level 
of confidence. At the same time, the 0 correlations with achievement 
variables tended to be higher for males than the corresponding W 
correlations. It would appear that the factor or ability underlying 
the other test scores, perhaps a logical-spatial factor, enters into 
the 0 scores to a greater extent for males than for females. The 
higher male correlations are particularly noticeable for the subjects 
in which males usually excel, viz., mathematics and science. 

(b) A majority of the W correlations tended to be higher for 
females than for males although the trend was not well enough defined 
to be statistically significant. Moreover, the W correlations with 
achievement variables tended to be higher in the case of females than 
the corresponding 0 correlations for females. It would seem plausible 
to argue that the factor underlying W played a more prominent role in

determining the female test score than the ability involved in the 0 
score. 

(c) Related to (a) and (b), a statistically significant trend 
was found toward positive 0-W correlations with achievement variables 
for males and negative correlations with the same variables for females. 
One outstanding instance is found in the Science scores which correlated 
with 0-W to the extent of -.21 for the females and .15 for the males, a 
difference which was significant at the .05 level. 

Partial Correlation Studies 

The partial correlation studies were undertaken in the hope that 
further patterns of sex differences would emerge. The analyses encom¬ 
passed two stages. In the first stage each of the reasoning variables 
0-W, 0, and W was correlated with each of the other achievement and 
intelligence variables, while the latter were held constant one at a 
time. In the second stage, the partial correlations were calculated 
separately for each sex and for each of the variables 0-W and 0 with 
the intelligence and achievement variables again held constant one at 
a time. The tables of partial correlations have been placed in 
Appendix D. 

Consistent patterns of the following type emerged: the decrease 
in the correlation coefficients (reasoning scores with achievement 
variables) between the zero order and the first order partial coef¬ 
ficients with 0 held constant was larger for males than for females. 


This is illustrated in Table XV where the zero order and first

order partial correlations between 0-W and V are shown. However, since 
this and similar results can be traced back to the initial sex difference 
in the zero order coefficients, the results did not seem to reveal new 
information, and are not discussed further.

Multiple Correlation Studies 

Two motives prompted a further calculation of multiple correlation 
coefficients. On the one hand it was felt that patterns of sex differ¬ 
ences might be observed in the predictor variables. Again there was a 
desire to determine the extent to which the reasoning variables, 0, W, 
and 0-W, could be predicted from the battery of intelligence and achieve¬ 
ment tests employed in this study. 

The Horst (1954) iteration method was used to calculate the relative 
beta weights and the multiple coefficients of correlation. These are 
presented in Table XVI.

Dealing first with the extent to which prediction of the reasoning 
variables was possible, the written scores for the whole sample showed 
the highest predictability with 42 % of their variance being attributable 
to the thirteen predictors of the battery. At the same time these 
predictors explained 37% of the variance of the oral scores and less 
than 1% of the variance of the oral dominance scores. 

Certain sex differences were observed in the relative size of the 
predictors. This was particularly clear in the case of the 0-W variables 
where high beta coefficients were contributed by Science (-,35), V (,35), 
and W (-.33) scores for females while the corresponding beta coefficients 
for the males were small to the point of insignificance. For the oral 
scores the principal sex difference lay in the fact that the largest 
predictor for the females was the SCAT Total score, while Mathematics 
was the best predictor for the males. There is a suggestion here, that, 
in addition to the quantitative differences between scores with respect 
to the ability underlying the oral scores, there may be qualitative 
differences between the sexes in this ability as well. 

Summary 

This chapter presented the results of the studies of zero order, 
first order partial, and multiple correlations between the reasoning 
scores and the achievement and intelligence variables of the Clover Bar 
Survey. A reduced sample was employed consisting of the 265 students 
for whom complete data was available. Tests of significance revealed 
that this sample adequately represented the original sample of 301 subjects.

The most important results may be summarized as follows: 

(a) The correlation between 0 and W over the whole group of 265 
pupils was .55, which is in agreement with the hypothesis that oral and 
written performance are to some extent psychologically distinct. This 
position was further supported by the markedly different pattern of 
predictors for oral and written scores which emerged from the multiple 
correlation studies. The low correlations of 0 and W with Otis I.Q. 

(.44 and .38 respectively) indicated that intelligence did not play a 
dominant role in the psychological processes underlying these scores. 

(b) The correlations between oral scores and the intelligence 
and achievement variables were higher for males than for females in 
such a large proportion of cases as to dispel any doubt that this effect 
could have occurred by chance. Since, in addition, the 0 correlations 
with achievement variables tended to be higher for males than the corres¬ 
ponding W correlations, it would seem a reasonable deduction that the 
factor or ability underlying the achievement and intelligence scores 
enters into the 0 score to a greater extent for males than for females. 

(c) Although not quite so well defined the picture for females 
was completely reversed. A majority of the W correlations with achieve¬ 
ment variables tended to be higher than the corresponding female 0 score 
correlations. 

(d) A further result which was apparently related to (b) and (c) 
appeared in the tendency toward positive 0-W correlations with achieve¬ 
ment variables for males, and negative correlations with the same 


variables for females

(e) Holding 0 constant consistently led to a greater increase in 
the differences between zero order and first order partial correlations 
for males than for females. Similarly holding W constant led to con¬ 
sistent and increasing differences between zero order and first order 
partial correlations for females than males. 

(f) The thirteen predictors of the Clover Bar Survey yielded 
multiple coefficients of correlation of .607, .647, and .091 for the 
variables 0, W, and 0-W respectively. In addition, there were marked 
sex differences in the relative importance of the different predictors.

CHAPTER XII 


A FURTHER STUDY OF SEX DIFFERENCES 

The correlation studies of the last chapter employed the reduced 
sample (N=265) for which complete Clover Bar data were available. In 
order to make comparisons between the sexes, means and standard devia¬ 
tions were computed for each of the thirteen experimental variables. 

Each difference was tested for significance and the results are shown 
in Table XVII. 

It is evident from Table XFII that the females scored higher in 
all the achievement variables. However, since the females enjoyed a 
highly significant superiority of more than four points in I.Q., their 
superior scores in variables which themselves correlate moderately with 
intelligence is not at all surprising. 

The one noticeable difference in favor of the males was found in 
the 0 scores. While this difference was not statistically significant, 
it seemed reasonable to believe that since the males scored higher than 
the females, despite their lower intelligence, the males might con¬ 
ceivably be significantly superior in 0 to females of equal intelligence. 

Again, it seemed likely that the females* slight advantage in W 
might be solely attributable to their superior intelligence in the sample 
used in this investigation. 


The Matched Groups 


While the sex difference in intelligence posed no serious obstacles

to the correlational studies, the question of sex differences in the 
reasoning variables could only be fairly assessed by comparing groups 
of equal intelligence. 

For this purpose, male and female students were matched on Otis 
I.Q. and as closely as possible on M.A. Since I.Q. was first held 
constant, matching on M.A. was equivalent to matching on C.A. It was 
possible to match 50 pairs of students at the grade four level and 41 
pairs at the grade five level, yielding a total population of 182 sub¬

respect to I.Q. and M.A., and therefore with respect to G.A. as well. 

The means and standard deviations for the reasoning variables 
are presented in Tables XIX and XK. 

The significance of the male-female differences between cor¬ 
related means of scores in the four reasoning variables was tested by 
the ’difference method’ (Garrett, 1953). The significance of the 
differences between uncorrelated means (male-male and female-female 
comparisons) was tested by the t-test. The Cochran and Cox test was 
employed in cases bordering upon significance. Because of the pre¬ 
viously mentioned uncertainty as to whether the 0-W or the Q+W scale 
can be regarded as true interval scales, the significance of the 
differences for these variables was tested in addition by the sign 
test (Siegel, 1956). The results may be listed as follows: 

(a) The grade four males were appreciably superior to the 
grade four females in 0, and Q+W, and slightly inferior in W, although 
none of the results was significant at the .05 level. 

(b) The grade four males scored significantly higher at the 
.05 level in 0-?/ than the grade four females. 

(c) The grade five males were significantly superior at the 
.01 level of confidence in 0 and 0+W to the grade five females and 
scored higher in W and 0-W, although the two latter results were not 
significant at the .05 level. 

(d) When grades four and five were combined, the males scored 
significantly higher than the females in 0, 0+W and 0-W (P^.05), and 
were slightly superior in W.

(e) The combined grades four and five male scores in 0, W, 0-W, 
and OfW were significantly more variable at the .01 level of confidence 
than the corresponding female scores. The largest differences in 
variability were observed at the grade four level where the males were 
significantly superior in 0 and OfW at the .01 level of confidence, and 
in W at the .05 level of confidence. At the grade five level the female 
0-W scores were significantly more variable than the corresponding male 
scores. 

(f) For both males and females, the grade five scores in 0, W, 
and OfW were significantly higher than the corresponding grade four 
scores at the .01 level of confidence. 

The evidence for sex differences is unequivocal. The suspected 
male superiority in 0 and OfW was realized and it appears that the small 
female superiority in W which was observed in the larger sample (Nr301) 
disappeared when intelligence was controlled. 

The Maturation Sequence in Verbal Reasoning 
In this section we return to the two central hypotheses of the 

thesis: 

Hg: With advance in age and grade the reasoning activity in¬ 
volved in problem solving changes from a state of oral dominance 
in the direction of equidominance. 

H 4 : Since females are assumed to be more advanced in maturation, 
girls will tend to exhibit a progress away from oral dominance in 
the direction of equidominance. 

A raaturational movement beyond the equidominance point in the 
direction of written dominance is entirely consistent with the above

hypotheses, which might in fact be revised as follows: 

H 3 : With advance in age and grade, the reasoning activity in¬ 
volved in problem solving changes from a state of oral dominance 
through a state of equidominance to a state of written dominance. 

H^: Since females are assumed to be more advanced in maturation, 
girls will tend to exhibit a greater progress away from oral 
dominance in the direction of equidominance and written dominance 

The findings of the chapter are in excellent harmony with both 

hypotheses. The complete results are somewhat difficult to grasp by 

mere inspection of the numerical data and for that reason are presented 

graphically in Figure 3. 

The eight mean values for the 0 and W variables at grade levels 
four and five were plotted on the vertical lines. When corresponding 
grade scores were joined (e.g. grade four 0 male and grade five 0 male) 
and the joining lines extrapolated,^* the straight lines shown in the 
diagram resulted. 

The diagram reveals clearly the postulated maturational movement 
away from oral dominance in the direction of written dominance. It 
also reveals the postulated female superiority in progress in the move¬ 
ment toward equidominance; in fact, for the sample under consideration 


^The extrapolation downward beyond grade four is equivalent to 
the assumption that the students* progress in the oral and written 
techniques of problem solving is a linear function of time. This 
hypothesis would require further checking by taking additional cross 
sectional samples (at grade three for example), and is not crucial to 
the argument here. The linearity assumption is merely the simplest 
one which can be made, and the discussion which follows is not in¬ 
validated if the lines in question were subsequently proven to be 
curvilinear.

the equidominance point occurred near the grade four level^ with the 
grade five females actually showing a slight tendency toward written 
dominance. 

The diagram also reveals that the male point of equidominance 
is at a much higher level than the females, a result which follows 
from the fact that the males are superior in the 0, and to some extent 
in the W, scores. 

In summary the study of groups matched in intelligence presents 
a picture of maturational progress away from oral dominance with the 
females leading the males. Both results were in entire agreement with 
the basic hypothesis of this thesis. 


In the earlier study with the reduced sample the direction of 
movement for females was away from oral dominance toward the point of 
equidominance, a position which they had nearly reached by grade five. 

In the present study the point of equidominance for the females 
occurred near the grade four level, and by grade five the female 
students had progressed slightly beyond into the region of written 
dominance. Although both results are in agreement with the experimental 
hypotheses H 3 and the apparent lack of coincidence of the two equi¬ 
dominance points for females needs further explanation. In the first 
place the two studies employed different samples so that one would not 
expect complete agreement. However, the principal cause of discrepancy 
lay in the fact that the earlier study classified as non-equidominant 
only those students who were markedly oral or written dominant (i.e. 
for whom the difference between the oral and written scores was two or 
more), while the present study classified all students for whom 0> W 
as orally dominant and all students for whom 0<W as written dominant.

CHAPTER XIII 


FINDINGS AND IMPLICATIONS 

This study was designed to discover whether variations in oral 
and written performance were associated with factors such as age, sex, 
intelligence, and academic achievement, as well as biological and 
sociological variables. 

Rationale, Definitions and Hypotheses 

When written and oral performance are viewed from the point of 
view of the ♦operational thought’ concepts of Piaget, it appears that 
the net advantage must lie with the mature use of the written technique. 
This is true because the written technique, in permitting the drawing of 
diagrams and the elaboration of intermediate steps of an argument, effects 
a partial sensory recreation of the system reasoned about, and therefore 
to some extent dispenses with the necessity of a purely imaginative 
recreation and retention of the system. Thus at the upper end of the 
maturational scale, we would expect to find that written performance 
would allow problem solving at a higher difficulty level than would 
oral performance, while at the lower end, where oral experience precedes 
written experience by several years, the oral technique would be expected 
to dominate. Hence, we are led to postulate a point of equidominance and 
a maturational movement away from the oral dominance of the early years 
to the written dominance of the adult years. The picture is further 
complicated by a commonly accepted hypothesis of a maturational advantage

possessed by females. 

The theoretical considerations gave rise to several experimental 
hypotheses which directed the course of the experimental investigations. 
H-j_: There exist sex differences in the 0, W and OfW scores. 

Hg: Oral performance (0) is to some extent different from written 
performance (W). 

Hg: With advance in age and grade the reasoning activity involved in 
problem solving changes from a state of oral dominance in the direction 
of equidominance. 

H 4 : Since females are assumed to be more advanced in maturation, girls 
will tend to exhibit a greater progress away from oral dominance in the 
direction of equidominance. 

H 5 : The oral reports given by girls for correct solutions tend to be 
rated more highly than the oral reports for corresponding correct 
solutions given by boys. 

Hg*. Written as opposed to oral dominance is positively related to 
intelligence and achievement. 

The 0 and W scores refer to the number of problems correctly 
answered in Burt’s Reasoning Test by the oral and written techniques 
respectively. A student who performed equally well in 0 and W was said 
to be equidominant. If the 0 score exceeded the W score, the student 
was said to show oral dominance, while if the W score exceeded the 0 
score, he was said to be written dominant. The rating score was not 
determined by the correctness or incorrectness of the answer to the 
problem, but represented the interviewer’s assessment of the adequacy

of the oral or written report in explaining the solution obtained. 

Tests, Administration, and Statistical Techniques 

In addition to Burt’s Reasoning Test, the study employed all the 
tests and student information sheets of the Glover Bar Survey, including 
the Otis ^uick-Scoring Test of Mental Ability, the School and College 
Aptitude Test, and the Sequential Tests of Educational Progress. The 
student information sheet yielded data which were largely of a social 
and economic nature. The sample consisted of 301 students of grades 
four and five. 

The individual testing sessions were conducted by a team of five 
interviewers, and statistical checks indicated that the measures intro¬ 
duced to ensure uniformity of marking resulted in a self-consistency on 
the part of each interviewer and a consistency between the interviewers 
which was adequate for the purposes of the experiment. 

Among the statistical techniques employed were parametric tests 
of significance (t-tests and F-tests), non-parametric tests of signifi¬ 
cance (sign test, median test, Kolmagorov-Smernov test), parametric 
measures of relationship (zero order, first-order partial, and multiple 
coefficients of correlation) and non-parametric measures of relationships 
(^ coefficient and^). Since the adequacy of the 0-W scale was some¬ 
what in question all results yielded for this variable by parametric 
tests were checked by non-parametric tests as well.

Results 

The major findings became more intelligible when listed under 
their appropriate experimental hypotheses. These are dealt with in 
turn. 

(A) There exist sex differences in the 0, W and OfW scores. 

The experimental findings are quite conclusive in this area. 

A preliminary comparison of means for the entire sample (N=301) showed 
a slight superiority (non-significant) in favour of the males in the 0 
scores despite the fact that the females possessed on the average a 
four point advantage in Otis I.Q. 

Next ninety-one male-female pairs were matched on Otis 1.^. which 
resulted in equal group means for M.A. and C.A. The results of tests of 
significance can be summarized as follows: 

(a) The grade four males were appreciably superior to the grade 
four females in 0, and 0+W, and slightly inferior in W, although none 
of the results was significant at the .05 level. 

(b) The grade four males scored significantly higher at the .05 
level in 0-W than the grade four females. 

(c) The grade five males were significantly superior at the .01 
level of confidence in 0 and 0-fW to the grade five females and scored 
higher in W and 0-W, although the two latter results were not significant

(e) The combined grades four and five male scores in 0, W, 0-W, 
and OW were significantly more variable at the .01 level of confidence 
than the corresponding female scores. The largest differences in 
variability were observed at the grade four level where the males were 
significantly superior in 0 and 0-W at the .01 level of confidence, and 
in W at the .05 level of confidence. At the grade five level the female 
0-W scores' were significantly more variable than the corresponding male 
scores. 

Further evidence of sex differences in the reasoning variables was 
found in the correlational studies. The correlations between oral scores 
and the intelligence and achievement variables were higher for males than 
for females in such a large proportion of cases as to dispel any doubt 
that this effect could have occurred by chance. Since, in addition, the 
0 correlations with achievement variables tended to be higher for males 
than the corresponding W correlations, it would seem a reasonable de¬ 
duction that the factor or ability underlying the other test scores 
enters into the 0 score to a greater extent for males than for females. 
Although not quite so well defined, the picture for females was complete¬ 
ly reversed. A majority of the W correlations with achievement variables 
tended to be higher than the corresponding female 0 score correlations. 

Sex differences were also found in the partial correlation studies, 
but it appeared that these differences could be traced back to the 
original difference in the zero order coefficients. 

The findings reviewed to this point deal largely with quantitative 
sex differences in 0 and W. Some suggestion of qualitative differences

in the abilities underlying the 0 and W scores ms found in the distinct 
pattern of beta weights which emerged from the multiple correlation 
studies* 

(B) Hg: Oral performance (0) is to some extent different from written 
performance (W)• 

The 0 and W scores for the combined grades correlated to the extent 
of .55 indicating that the relationship between the variables was not high. 
This fact, coupled with the markedly distinct pattern of predictors, sug¬ 
gests that the psychological processes underlying the two scores may be 
somewhat different, aside from the quantitative differences already dis¬ 
cussed. 

The exact nature of these psychological processes was not revealed 

by this study. It turned out that the average correlations of 0 and W 

with the achievement variables centred about .5, while their correlations 

with Otis I.Q. were in the neighbourhood of .4. It is, therefore, 

apparent that intelligence itself does not play a dominant role in the 

psychological processes involved in the reasoning scores. 

(G) H 3 : With advance in age and grade the reasoning activity involved 

in problem solving changes from a state of oral dominance in the 
direction of equidominance. 

Since females are assumed to be more advanced in maturation, 
girls will tend to exhibit a greater progress away from oral 
dominance in the direction of equidominance. 

These hypotheses are discussed together since the results of three 
experimental studies bear upon both. In a preliminary study employing 
the entire sample (N=301), the tendency towards equidominance was observed. 
It was also apparent that the females had approached more closely to equi-

dominance than the males at both the grade four and grade five levels. 

Since none of the results of the preliminary analysis was 
statistically significant, a further analysis employed the members of 
the reduced group (N*265) who were markedly oral or written dominant 
to the extent that they showed a difference of two or more points 
between the oral and written scores. When the sample was dichotomized 
at each grade level into equidominance and non-equidominance groups, the 
trend toward equidominance between grade four and grade five was signi¬ 
ficant at the .05 level. 

The third attack on the problem came in the study of matched groups 
(N*162). When the mean scores at each grade level were plotted and the 
trend lines drawn, a graphical picture emerged which showed remarkable 
agreement with the basic hypotheses of the thesis. The females in this 
group had actually passed the point of equidominance and had entered the 
region of written dominance, while the males had made significant pro¬ 
gress toward the equidominance point between grades four and five. 

(D) Hg: The oral reports given by girls for correct solutions tend 

to be rated higher than the oral reports for corresponding correct 
solutions given by boys. 

While this hypothesis was substantiated at the .05 level over a 
series of problems which included (1) an easy problem, (2) a problem of 
moderate difficulty, (3) two difficult problems, closer examination 
revealed a somewhat more subtle relationship. 

The female interviewer ratings for correct answers to the easy 
problems was significantly higher (P< .01) than the corresponding male 
ratings, but as the problem difficulty rose, the assessment of the

reports of solutions for problems correctly answered shifted in favour 
of the males. The overall ratings for written solutions showed no 
significant sex difference, although male ratings for the difficult 
problems were again markedly higher than the females. 

If we interpret the 0 and W scores as the subject’s logical out¬ 
put, and the interviewer ratings as the subject’s effectiveness in 
presenting his arguments, then it would appear that the female, through 
her superior facility in the use of language, is able to present her 
arguments more convincingly than a male who possesses the same logical 
grasp of the problem. 

When the result is considered in the light of the observed male 
superiority in 0, there emerges the possibility that the female may be 
attempting to balance her relative weakness in oral reasoning (0) by 
relying to a greater extent on her verbal facility. 

A further result not directly related to H 5 was obtained when 

median assessments of problems correctly answered were computed for both 

grade levels. Here, a maturational movement was found which parallelled 

that previously observed for the 0 and W scores. For not only were the 

grade five assessments for oral and written solutions significantly 

higher than the corresponding grade four assessments, but a movement 

toward equality of oral and written assessments was found. 

(E) Hg: Written as opposed to oral dominance is positively related to 
intelligence and achievement. 

This hypothesis was not supported by the data; indeed, it was 
oral rather than written dominance which correlated positively with the

intelligence and achievement variables, although the coefficients were 
extremely small, averaging .03. In addition, the entire battery of 
thirteen predictors in the multiple correlation study explained less 
than one per cent of the variance in the 0-W scores. The only other 
evidence bearing on this hypothesis was found in the study of equi- 
dominant, oral dominant, and written dominant cells, where it appeared 
that the optimum distribution of total logical output (0+W) occurred 
when the 0 and W scores were equal. The further indication that extreme 
written dominance is a somewhat superior condition to extreme oral 
dominance was very tenuous since it was based on a small number of cases. 

The study of correlates of oral and written dominance was prob¬ 
ably doomed to failure because it happened that the experiment was con¬ 
ducted with an age group in which many students were close to the equi- 
dominance point, with the result that the dominance scores were necessarily 
small. Moreover, since every student presumably passes through stages of 
oral dominance, equidominance, and written dominance, no consistent or 
permanent relationship could be expected between written dominance and a 
variable such as intelligence within the transition period. It is pos¬ 
sible, however, that such a study might yield valuable insights at a 
later stage in the maturational process, when sizable and permanent 
differences in dominance could be observed. 

Implications for Further Research 

This thesis has attempted to explore an area which has been 
virtually ignored by workers in the field of psychological research.

The present study raises more questions than it answers. Two problems 
seem to possess particular promise. 

(a) The Maturational Continuum. This thesis investigates only 
two points on the maturational continuum which seems to pass from 
oral dominance through equidominance into written dominance. 
Similar studies of the reasoning performance of students in the 
junior and senior high schools would yield a more complete picture 
of the maturational pattern. Classroom practice would undoubtedly 
be affected by the findings. 

(b) Sex Differences. Evidence of systematic sex differences in 
oral and written reasoning revealed by this study warrant further 
examination. The projected pattern of sex differences before 
grades four and five and afterwards is hypothetical and demands 
confirmation or denial. Further exploration of this area would 
add appreciably to our increasing insight into this problem.

BURT'S GRADED REASONING TESTS 


1. Tom runs faster than Jim: Jack runs slower than Jim, Vi/ho is the 
slowest—Jim, Jack or Tom? 

2. Kate is cleverer than May: May is cleverer than Jane. Who is the 
cleverest—Jane, Kate or May? 

3. I have bought the following Christmas presents: a pipe, a blouse, 
some music, a box of cigarettes, a bracelet, a toy engine, a bat, a 
book, a doll, a walking-stick and an umbrella. My brother is 
eighteen; he does not smoke, nor play ball, nor play the piano. 

I want to give the walking-stick to my father and the umbrella to 
my mother. Which of the above shall I give to my brother? 

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

4. I don't like sea voyages: and I don't like the seaside. I must 
spend Easter either in Hawaii, or Jasper, or on the West coast. 

Which shall it be? 

5. The person who stole Brown's purse was neither dark, nor tall, nor 
clean-shaven. The only persons in the room at the time were: 

(1) Jones, who is short, dark and clean-shaven. (2) Smith, who is 
fair, short and bearded. (3) Grant, who is dark, tall, but not 
clean-shaven. Who stole Brown's purse? 

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

6. Three boys are sitting in a row: Harry is to the left of Willie; 
George is to the left of Harry. Which boy is in the middle? 

7. In cold, damp climates, root crops like potatoes and turnips grow 
best: in temperate climates there are abundant pastures, and oats 
and barley flourish; in sub-tropical climates, wheat, olives and 
vines flourish. The ancient Greeks lived largely on bread, with oil 
instead of butter: they had wine to drink and raisins for fruit. 
Which climate do you think they had? 

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

8. The doctor thinks Yiolet has caught some illness. If she has a rash, 
it is probably chicken-pox, measles or scarlet fever. If she has 
been ailing with a cold or cough she may develop whooping-cough, 
measles or mumps. She has been sneezing and coughing for some days, 
and now spots are appearing on her face and arms. What do you think 
is the matter with Yiolet?

9. There are four roads here. I have come from the South and want to go 
to Melton. The road to the right leads somewhere else: straight 
ahead it leads only to a farm. In which direction is Melton—North, 
South, East, or West? 

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

10. Esther has just come home in a brand new overcoat: there is mud on 
his boots, and flour on his hat. The only places he can have been 
to are Northgate, Southgate, Westgate or the City. He has not had 
time to go to more than one of these. There is no mud anywhere in 
the streets except where the pavement is up for repair. There are 
tailor shops only in Southgate, Westgate and the City. There are 
flour mills only in Northgate, Westgate and the City. I know the 
roads are not being repaired in the City, though they may be in the 
other places. Where has father been? 

11. Where the climate is hot, aloes and rubber will grow: heather and 

grass will only grow where it is cold. Heather and rubber require 

plenty of moisture: grass and aloes will grow only in fairly dry 
regions. Near the river Amazon it is very hot and very damp. Which 
of the above grows there? 

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

12. Field-mice devour the honey stored by the bumble-bees: the honey 

which they store is the chief food of the bumble-bees. Near towns 

there are far more cats than in the open country. Cats kill all 
kinds of mice. Where, then, do you think there are most bumble¬ 
bees—near towns or in the open country? 

13. I started from the church and walked 100 yards; I turned to the 
right and walked 50 yards; I turned to the right again and walked 
100 yards. How far am I from the church? 

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

14. A pound of meat should roast for half-an-hour; two pounds of meat 
should roast for three-quarters of an hour; three pounds of meat 
should roast for one hour; eight pounds of meat should roast for 
two hours and a quarter; nine pounds of meat should roast for two 
hours and a half. From this can you discover a simple rule by 
which you can tell from the weight of a joint how long it should 
roast? 

15. What conclusions can you draw from the following facts? Iron nails 
will not float in a pool; a cup of pure gold dust weighs nearly 
twenty times as much as a cup of water of the same size; if you 
drop a silver dime or a copper coin into a puddle, it will sink to

the bottom; a cubic inch (about a tablespoonful) of water weighs 
less than half an ounce, a cubic inch of brass weighs over two 
ounces; a leaden weight will drop to the bottom of the ocean. Sum 
up all these observations in one short sentence of the following 
form: "Most-are---."

16. John said: "I heard my clock strike yesterday ten minutes before 
the first gun fired. I did not count the strokes, but I am sure it 
struck more than once, and I think it struck an odd number." John 
was out all morning, and his clock stopped at five to five the same 
afternoon. When do you think the first gun fired? 

17. Captain Watts and his son James have been found shot—the father in 
the chest, and the son in the back. Both clearly died instantaneous¬ 
ly. A gun fired close to the person,—as; for example, when a man 
shoots himself—will blacken and even burn the skin or clothes; 
fired from a greater distance it will leave no such mark. The two 
bodies were found near the middle of a large hall used as a rifle 
range. Its floor is covered with damp sand, which shows every foot¬ 
print distinctly. Inside the room there are two pairs of footprints 
only. A third man standing just outside would show no footmarks. 
Under Captain Watt’s body was found a gun; no such weapon was found 
near James. In each case the coat, where the bullet entered, was 
blackened with gunpowder, and the cloth a little singed. Captain 
Watts was devoted to his son, and would have died sooner than harm 
him purposely; hence it is impossible to suppose that he killed him 
deliberately, even in self-defence. But some think that James 
secretly disliked his father, and hoped to inherit his fortune at 
his death. (1) Was Captain Watt’s death due to murder, accident or 
suicide? (2) Was James’ death due to murder, accident or suicide?
