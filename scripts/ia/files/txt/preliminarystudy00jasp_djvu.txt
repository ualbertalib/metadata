INTRODUCTION 


The beneficial effects of entrained air in concrete have 
been recognized for many years, but possible losses in strength had 
been sufficient reasons for delaying investigations. Later, the 
scaling effects of calcium chloride for ice removal from pavement 
surfaces greatly revived interest in the possibility of using air- 
entrainment in concrete. The use of air-entrained concrete has 
increased rapidly since it was realized in 1938 that the durability of concrete 
highways was greatly improved by the presence of entrained air in the 
concrete. Investigations ^ on the resistance of concrete to 
freezing and thawing in the presence of chlorides and in the presence 
of plain water, have been carried out. In the investigations to be 
reported in this paper, the durability of concrete beams and manufactured 
bricks was evaluated. Comparisons were made, using three Portland cements, 
and six eir-entraining agents.

CHAPTER I 

PRESSURE AIR METER 


Introduction 

The amount of air entrained in concrete has become of major 
importance. Whatever else may be their effect on the properties of concrete, 
there seems no doubt that air-entraining agents will increase its cohesiveness, 
reduce bleeding, and greatly improve resistance to freezing and thawing; 
including resistance to scaling. Excessive air-entrainment will reduce 
strength without any substantial improvement in the properties benefited. 
Consequently, it is generally agreed that the total air in the concrete 
should be kept within certain limits, defined on the one hand by a minimum 
which will give the full effects on durability and on the other hand by a 
maximum above which serious losses in strength may be expected. 

Air content of fresh concrete may be determined by the gravimetric* 1 
method (A.S.T.M. C 138-44), by the "volumetric" method (A.S.T.M. C 173-42T), 
or, in common use today, the "pressure" method. ^ The "gravimetric" 
and,“volumetric” methods are not practical for field determinations of air 
content, as they require cumbersome equipment and accurate measurements. 

The “pressure” method makes use of Boyle l s Law, in that the volume 
of a gas (at a given temperature) is inversely proportional to the pressure 
to which it is subjected. The volume of air in concrete can be determined 
by the amount it is compressed by a given increase in pressure. 

A pressure air meter was designed and calibrated at the University 
of Alberta to indicate directly the gross air content of fresh concrete. ^

Description of Meter 

The apparatus consists of a container of about 0.5 cubic foot 
capacity to hold the sample of concrete, a funnel-shaped cover capable of 
being attached in a waterproof manner, a ■§■ inch bullet-pointed rod for 
consolidating the sample, and a bicycle tire pump for applying air pressure* 
The funnel-shaped cover has a rubber gasket where it comes into contact 
with the container. Upward from its center extends a 1^ inch diameter 
standpipe, closed at its upper end with an attached pressure gauge. Near 
the upper end are also a pet cock and a tire stem valve. In its side 
there is a water glass for indicating the level of water in the standpipe. 

The upper end of the water glass is closed, while the lower end has a pet 
cock for adjusting the level of water in the standpipe. At the side of the 
water glass is a scale graduated to show the total air content of the sample 
in % when the applied pressure as indicated by the gauge is 15 p.s.i. 

Attached to the funnel-shaped cover is a i inch diameter pipe, terminated 
at its upper end by a valve and funnel. The cover and standpipe are filled 
to mark with water by this inlet. 

Procedure 

In determining the air content, the container is filled with 
concrete in 3 equal lifts, each being rodded 25 times with the bullet- 
pointed rod, and the container struck 10 times sharply on the sides, to 
bring the mortar to the surface and prevent excessive quantities of air 
being trapped by the succeeding lift. On completion of filling, the concrete

is struck off level with the rim of the container. The cover is attached 
firmly to the container, a water and air tight seal being obtained with the 
rubber gasket. With the lower pet cock closed and the upper one open, 
water is introduced until it stands level with the zero mark on the scale, 
upon which the filler valve is immediately closed. The lower pet cock is 
used to adjust the level if necessary. The upper pet cock is then closed, 
and the air pressure is applied until the gauge reads exactly 15 p.s.i. 

The gross air content is noted on the scale, indicated by the lowering 
of water level when the pressure is applied. 

Entrained Air Content 

The air content measured as described includes not only the entrained 
air, but also the air held in the pores of the aggregates, an amount for the 
expansion of the meter, and another term called the recovery factor. Hence 
corrections have to be applied. 

Having read the glass gauge, the applied air pressure is then 
released slowly by the upper pet cock, until the water comes to rest near 
the zero mark. This difference from zero is the '’recovery factor", which has 
to be subtracted from the gross reading observed. An additional 0.1? 
is subtracted also, which is the "expansion factor" for this meter. If the 
aggregates are in a saturated state, or saturated surface-dry, there need be 
no correction for compression of air in the aggregates.

CHAPTER II 


LABORATORY CONCRETE MIXER 


Introduction 

The small mixer used in the laboratory was built as a scale model 
of mixers used on the Grand Coulee Dam. Efficiency tests ^ run on the 
mixer indicated that a mixing period of 5 minutes gave the most consistent 
results, and that it entrained air comparable to those obtained with a 
0.5 cubic yard field mixer. 

Description of Mixer 

The mixer is a 0*5 cubic foot tilting drum type mixer, powered by 
a i H.P., 220 volt, 3-phase motor, and operated at a speed of 20 revolutions 
per minute. 

Procedure 

All materials are weighed accurately, in this case to the nearest 
ounce. Half of the water is added to the mixer, followed by the coarse aggregate. 
The cement and sand, pre-mixed by hand, is then added, followed by the 
remainder of the mixing water. Liquid admixtures are added to the water, 
while powdered ones are added to the sand and cement mixture. The 5 minute 
mixing period is begun when all the materials are in the mixer. If two 
identical batches are made for the same mix, they are mixed in quick 
succession in the mixer, and then recombined by hand in a damp steel tray.

Consistency Checks 

Checks were kept on the consistency of the mixes by the slump 
test; it was attempted to maintain the slump as near 4 inches as possible. 
A point worthy of note is that a significant amount of mortar remains in 
the mixer if it is not cleaned out by hand, especially with the non 
air-entrained mixes.

CHAPTER III 


SONIC EQUIPMENT 


Introduction 

In the past few years the modulus of elasticity determined by 
means of vibrations has been used as a measure of deterioration of concrete 
beams subjected to accelerated tests of various types. The deterioration 
appears to be of two main types: 

(1) That characterized by weakening of the cement 
paste, the bond or the aggregate, or combinations 

of these. Such deterioration is usually encountered 
in freezing and thawing tests, upon which this 
investigation to be reported is based, 

(2) That characterized by the development of cracks, usually 
encountered in wetting and drying tests. 

One of the most important dynamical properties of an elastic system 
is its natural frequency of vibration. In the case of a vibrating beam of 
given dimensions, the natural frequency of vibration is related mainly to

Description of Equipment 

The dynamic apparatus consists of a variable frequency oscillator 
with a frequency range of 550 - 6000 cycles which is amplified and fed into 
a magnetic driver; a magnetic pickup connected to an amplifier, and an output 
meter which registers the amplitude of the vibration* 

The author wishes to point out that considerable changes were made 
since the reports ^ of previous investigations* 

The oscillator is a Hewlett Packard, No* 11012, calibrated to read 
within 1 7$ of the true frequency over its entire range* It is coupled through 
a transformer to a Model MAH Driver unit, manufactured by "University 
Loudspeakers, Inc* M * This driver unit contains a screened diaphragm about 
flinch in diameter. Previous speaker units gave considerable trouble with 
a light aluminum rod cemented to the voice coil, and, the author suspects, 
erroneous results due to distortions if the needle became slightly bent upon 
contact with the concrete specimen* It was decided to machine a hard rubber 
air column which could be threaded onto the driver unit at one end, the other 
end containing a light 1-inch steel diaphragm as used in head phones. Centred 
on this steel diaphragm was a light bolted needle which came in contact 
with the concrete specimen. A series of tests showed that numerous peak 
frequencies occurred, and it was uncertain at times which was the natural 
frequency of the beam. This air column contained a sharp lip at the inside 
lower end, it is possible that the vibration waves were being deflected, 
and reflected, this action causing the source of distortions. 

Another air column was machined from aluminum, similar in 
attachment to the first; this time, however, the inside expanded smoothly 
to a 3-inch diaphragm contact, figure 2. Centred onto the diaphragm was a 






13 


























































ih 


bolted aluminum rod with removable steel tip. Two steel tips were machined, 
one inch in length for vibrating beams on the sponge rubber supports, and 
one 1-inch in length for beams supported at the nodal points* 

A thin steel diaphragm was tried, but this proved too sensitive, 
and chattered vehemently, and was soon discarded. A sheet of 3/32-inch 
Lucite was fitted, and proved very satisfactory* 

Four advantages became clear with this type of driving mechanism: 

(1) the weight of specimens could not damage the driver unit 
diaphragm, as was noted in previous investigations; 

(2) the 3-inch Lucite diaphragm responded clearly to any 
signal applied to it through the expanding air column; 

(3) the Lucite diaphragm was capable of withstanding considerable 
pressure without damage or distortion; 

(4) no damage could be done to the driver unit* 

One disadvantage with the Model MAH Driver unit is that its resonant 
frequency is about 2650 cycles. This point may interfere with readings of 
certain specimens, if, during their course of deterioration, their natural 
frequencies approach or pass through the resonant point of the driver* 

No interference is encountered with Standard Beams 
3 r t n x Ai n x 16 M , as their resonant frequencies wereusually below 2300 cycles* 
However, bricks vibrated flat will range from 2000 to 5000 cycles* If their 
resonant peak is weak as compared to the peak of the driver, interference and 

uncertainty may result. However, another method is to vibrate the bricks 
on edge until the frequencies on the flat are past the range of interference.

The driver unit is attached to a wall of the beam supporting box 
by a hinge in such a way that the driving steel tip will protrude through a 
hole in the top, and can be brought in contact with the underside of the 
supported beam by means of an adjusting screw. 

The pickup circuit consists of a pickup unit, an amplifier, and 
a meter. The pickup is a soft rubber ,f Amperite ff contact mike, which when 
placed on the vibrating specimen, generates a voltage which is amplified 
and detected on an output meter. 

Previous to this investigation, the beams were supported at their 
nodal points (.224 of their length from each end) and the pickup attached to 
the end of the beam by a strong rubber band. Standard beams gave no trouble, 
probably due to their massiveness, but considerable difficulties were 
encountered with bricks, due to chattering and a weak signal response. 

It was decided to remove the supports and place the specimens directly on a 
sheet of sponge rubber which covers the beam supporting box. The pickup was 
encased in a 4-lb. steel ring in such a way that the rubber contact mike 
protruded about 4 >»inch beyond the ring so that the latter did not rest upon 
the specimen. 

Beams and bricks were vibrated: 

(a) Supported on the sponge rubber, specimens dry and soaking. 

(b) Supported at their modal points, specimens dry and soaking. 

(c) The above conditions with -* 

(i) pickup attached by rubber band at end of specimens

(c) (iii) pickup in 6-lb. ring placed at centre, and at ends 
of specimens 

(iv) pickup in 4-lb. and 6-lb. ring, placed at end of 

specimen, with and without a counterbalancing weight 
on the other end. 

In no instance whatsoever did the resonant frequency of the specimens 
visibly alter when vibrated under the above conditions! 

True, the means of support should permit the specimen to vibrate 
in the free mode without restriction. The author will endeavor to show that, 
under these conditions, specimens are vibrating unrestricted in the free mode. 
Admittedly, a damping effect has been produced, but damping, only affects the 
amplitude of a vibration. 

An interesting experiment was devised, whereby a Standard. 

3 i 41 x 4s 4 ’ x 16 M beam was supported on the sponge rubber or at its nodes, 
with the 4-lb. pickup on one end, anda 3 n x 3 M steel plate of about the same 
weight on the other end. A change of about 50 cycles was noted in the 
resonant frequency, normally 1600 for this particular beam, which is about % % 
But, with a strip of rubber, or even a *|-inch strip of wood, placed between 
the steel plate and the beam, the resonant point immediately returned-to its 
original position* With the 3-inch plate resting on the beam, vibrations 
appeared definitely restricted, in that the steel plate would not follow the 
same wave pattern of vibration as the beam* But with a strip of rubber between 
the plate and beam, the rubber 1 s thickness appeared to be able to contract 
and expand to suit the wave pattern of the beam.

The same must be true with the sponge rubber supporting the beam 
throughout its entire length. The rubber can expand and contract to suit 
the wave pattern of the beam*s vibration. 

This method of vibrating specimens indicates many advantages: 

(a) Chattering with small specimens is eliminated. 

(b) The signal picked up by the contact mike is greatly 
increased due to the pickup being in closer contact with 
the beam. 

(c) Hate of reading specimens is greatly increased, due to the 
elimination of accurately centering the specimens over the 
nodal supports, and attaching the pickup to the specimens 
with a rubber band. 

(d) Less amplification is required. 

(e) Pickup can be either centred on the specimen, or placed 
on the end of the specimen. 

It was also decided to place a flat brass plate between the supporting 
box and the sponge rubber, and ground both the brass plate and the steel ring 
which encases the contact pickup. This had a small, but significant effect. 

The resonant peak, as indicated on the output meter, became sharper and increased 
in magnitude. A possible explanation is that stray broadcast waves and static 
disturbances were grounded. 

Since many specimens will vibrate at their natural frequency when 
excited at half or one third, or even one fourth their natural frequency, care

must be taken that the oscillator and specimen are vibrating at the same 
frequency. This is readily ascertained by using an oscillograph in conjunction 
with the output amplifier and meter. The input signal from the oscillator 
can be attached to the vertical plates of the oscillograph, and the output 
signal of the pickup to the horizontal plates, or vice versa. With the use 
of the proper controls on the oscillograph, frequencies are matched when the 
signal becomes a circle on the screen, or an oval, depending on the 
amplification used. Familiarity with the relationship existing between 
beam size, concrete strength, and resonant frequency make the use of an 
oscillograph unnecessary* 

Procedure 

The dimensions of the specimen are determined with considerable 
accuracy ( f 2$ ) because they are used to a power in the equation relating 
resonant frequency to modulus of elasticity. The density is best obtained 
by weighing the specimen in air, and then obtaining its weight while 
submerged. The density is best obtained in the original state, before the 
specimen undergoes freezing and thawing, and can be used in all subsequent 
calculations as the cycles of freezing and thawing have little or no effect 
on the beam*s density* 

The specimen is placed on the sponge rubber, or supported at the 
nodes* The pickup is placed on the specimen at its centre or end* The driver 
unit is brought into contact with the beam. The frequency of the oscillator 
is then varied until the amplitude of vibration of the specimen reaches a 
maximum as shown by the output meter. The reading on the frequency dial is 
then noted.

The amplifiers in the driving and pickup circuits should be adjusted 
to provide a satisfactory meter reading. To avoid abusive use of the driver, 
the driving force should be maintained as low as is feasible for good resonance 
response. The pressure of the driving rod and tip against the beam should 
be kept as uniform as possible. Altering this pressure on beams in their 
original state will not alter their resonant frequency, but as the beams 
deteriorate, an alteration of pressure has indicated a change in resonant 
frequency of about 1$. This is very likely due to vibrations of the local 
aggregate in contact with the driver tip. 

Results 

When the elastic behavior of concrete is studied under the action 
of a deteriorating agent, it is often sufficient to present the results in 
terms of the frequency of vibration. If the results are to be compared with 
the findings of other investigators, it is desirable to present them in terms 
of the modulus of elasticity which is a physical property of the material*

CHAPTER IV 


AUTOMATIC ACCELERATED FREEZING - and - THAWING 

APPARATUS 


Introduction 

The resistance of concrete to frost action depends on many variables 
potentially present in the composition of the hardened material and the method 
of test* Such factors are: 

(1) chemistry of the cement 

(2) degree and rate of hydration 

(3) nature, grading, and thermal properties of the aggregates 

(4) homogeneity of the mixture 

(5) rate of cooling, degree of cooling 

(6) rate of warming, degree of warming 

(7) size and shape of specimen 

(8) relative degree of moisture saturation of the aggregate and 
matrix* 

It is impossible to reproduce in the laboratory conditions of 
weathering to which any particular structure or part of a structure will be 
exposed, and to standardize a test procedure which will correlate with the 
service of a structure* However, a procedure which is reproducible and 
sufficiently severe and rapid to permit determination of the relative

durability of the concrete in question in sufficient time to make the data usable 
as the basis of an acceptance test would be of great value. 

With this in mind, Charles E. Wuerpel and Herbert K. Cook^ 
have devised an automatic freezing-and-thawing unit* Similarly, the University 
of Alberta^ has instaHed a unit which will contain at one time, 12 specimens 
3i H x 4i’ M x 16"* 

Description of Apparatus 

The apparatus^ consists essentially of three tanks: a specimen 
tank, cold tank, and thaw tank; with means for cooling the cold fluid, heating 
the thaw fluid, and circulating the cold and thaw fluids at the right 
temperatures in and out of the specimen tank during the specified intervals 
of time. 

Freezing and Thawing So7a.ition 

A mixture of 60$ glycol and 40$ water is used for both the thaw and 
cold solution* The concentration is the same for both mixtures because of the 
intermingling which occurs, and also because of the possible necessity of 
storing all the fluid in two tanks for repairs or alterations. About 
150 gallons of solution are required to fill the system. 

Cold Tank and Refrigeration Unit 

The cold tank is 18 gauge galvanized iron , 24 n x 24 M x 48 M , insulated 
by 4 inches of cork and vapor barrier of asphalt. Four refrigeration plates 
are supported 6 inches above the bottom of the tank. The refrigeration 
is performed by a 3 H.P. water-cooled condensing unit using Freon (F-12) 
as the refrigerant. The fluid is pumped to the specimen tank by a motor

driven centrifugal pump, and returns by a gravity line through the overflow 
drain of the specimen tank. 

Motor valves direct all fluid leaving the specimen tank to the cold 
or thaw tank as required* 

Thaw Tank and Heating Equipment 

The thaw tank is 16 gauge galvanized iron, 24 inches in diameter 
by 48 inches in height. Two 1000 watt, 220 volt immersion heaters are 
installed, 6 inches above the bottom of the tank. The fluid is pumped to 
the specimen tank by an identical centrifugal pump, and is returned by gravity 
line through the overflow of the specimen tank. Since only one solution is 
circulated at a time, common pipes are employed in the overflow and drain 
lines from the specimen tank. 

Specimen Tank, Racks and Containers 

The specimen tank is IS gauge galvanized iron, 21 inches in depth 
and width, by 27 inches in length, insulated with two inches of cork and 
asphalt vapor barrier. The tank is designed to hold 4 racks, each rack holding 
3 containers. Containers are IS gauge galvanized iron, 3f” x 4i 4f x lS ,f , 
capable oflclding each one Standard Beam 3i n x 42'” x 16”, or 4 bricks 
2i« x 3i” x 7i*. The racks are such that there is free circulation of- 
the solution around the specimen containers. Deterioration is produced by 
plain water in the containers, into which the specimens are immersed. 

Automatic Controls 

Since all valves and pumps are electrically operated, circulation 
of the cold and thaw solution is made entirely automatic by means of a 


circuit timer,

The author wishes to point out that some minor changes were made 
to the automatic timer, for improved efficiency* 

The timer consists of 4 properly shaped Lucite cams, bolted on 
a common shaft, and driven, through proper gear reduction, by a "Green Flyer” 
phonograph electric motor* The advantage of this motor is that it contains 
a friction governor, and the length of cycle can be varied from 2 to 4 hours* 
As the cams revolve, they raise and lower roller-equipped spring-steel 
leaves which open and close 10-amp* "Micro-switches”* These micro-switches 
each activate a relay coil, and the contacts of the relay complete the circuit 
to the various pumps and valves. There is a cam, micro-switch, and relay for 
the cold-pump, hot pump, drain valve, and hot-and-cold return, the latter 
being operated by a double-throw relay* 

The timer is also fitted with a four-circuit, double-pole, double¬ 
throw switch which, when thrown to the right makes the control automatic, 
and when thrown to the left makes manual control possible. 

Safety Device 

Without an automatic liquid level control device, it is possible 
for any of the three tanks to be filled to overflowing due to failure of 
any of the valves to operate. Overflo?/ and loss of solution is prevented by 
a pair of liquid level probes installed in each tank just below the point 
where overflow might occur. When the probes are shorted by the solution, the 
apparatus, excluding the refrigeration unit and the thaw tank heaters, will 
automatically shut off.

Temperature Records 

Figures 6 and 7 represent actual temperature records, with and without 
a circulating pump in the cold tank. Temperatures were recorded by 
thermocouples attached to an automatic "Browning” temperature recorder. 

The "numbers” stamped identify each thermocouple, and the small "cross" 
beside each number represents the temperature at that time. Following 
is a list of the location of each thermocouple. 

No. 1. Top of cold tank solution. 

2. Bottom of cold tank colution. 

3. Temperature near cooling plates. 

4. Temperature of thaw solution in thaw tank. 

5., 6. Maximum and minimum temperatures of solution in 

specimen tank, as previously determined by investigation# 

7. Temperature at centre of a Standard beam in coldest 
area of specimen tank. 

8. Temperature at centre of a Standard beam in warmest area 
of specimen tank. 

The effect of a circulating pump for the cold tank solution is 
very pronounced. It has not only practically eliminated the temperature 
gradient, in the cold tank, as shown by the records, but has greatly reduced 
the vacuum on the low side of the refrigerant line, thus reducing the load 
carried by the compressor.

The records also indicate that with the circulating pump operating, 
the beams do not freeze to the same minimum temperature. As can be seen, No. 1 
in Figure 6 is about 2 degrees warmer than No. 2, which indicates heat gained 
during circulation* The circulating pump was installed on an experimental 
basis, and neither pump nor lines were insulated at the time of these records* 

Temperatures of No. 7 and No. 8 cannot be compared directly on 
both figures, without knowing the room temperature at the time of the recordings. 
Room temperature is not recorded here, due to abrupt changes at the time, 
necessitated by other investigations in the laboratory. However, previous 
records have clearly indicated that the entire temperature scale is nearly 
directly proportional to room temperature. If the average room temperature 
varies, say 5 degrees, all temperatures vary proportionally by about the same 
amount. The compressor is operating continuously for the 2-hour cycle used. 

This indicates the necessity of a larger refrigerating unit, or possibly 
larger cooling plates only, in order to obtain colder temperatures in the 
solution. 

Maintaining the thaw solution temperature between 75° and 80°F. 
is required, under present operating conditions, to melt the ice cap that 
forms over the specimen© in the specimen tank. This condition could likely 
be eliminated by altering the design of the specimen tank* The temperature 
variation in the specimen tank could be reduced by altering the design of 
the incoming lines. An alternative method of ensuring ice-removal from 
specimens during the thawing portion of the cycle would be by having sealed 
containers, completely immersed.

Suggestions for Apparatus Development 

The freezing-and-thawing apparatus was built at the University of 
Alberta on an experimental basis, to determine its effectiveness and usefulness* 
At the time, space was limited, and it was decided to maintain expenses to 
a minimum* 

Freezing-and-thawing tests have proven themselves invaluable in 
determining the relative durability of concrete mixes. Air-entrainment 
is rapidly becoming an important factor in the concrete industry* 

With this in mind, and with increased laboratory space in sight, 
it appears certain that a freezing-and-thawing apparatus will continue to play 
a major role in the laboratory* 

The author wishes to include some suggestions for further 
development of the apparatus. 

1. Increase the unit to handle at least 18 specimens in 
the specimen tank* 

2. Maintain about 120 gallons of solution, for each the hot 
and cold. At present there are 75 gallons of each solution, 
and the specimen tank, with containers, require about 25 gallons 
for proper circulation* With a larger specimen tank for 18 
containers, about 35 gallons will be required* Experience 

has indicated that a larger reserve of fluid in the cold or 
thaw tank is required for better efficiency. As shown by the 
temperature records, unless circulation is used, any fluid 
above the refrigerating plates will not cool. For maximum 
efficiency of a refrigerating unit, the cooling plates should 
be placed near the top of the solution, but this is impossible 
here, due to the necessity of periodically drawing down the

cold tank to fill the specimen tank* A larger reserve amount 
of fluid below the cooling plates would give a colder average 
temperature in the specimen tank during the cold half of a 
cycle. Similarly, a larger reserve of hot solution would give 
warmer average temperatures in the specimen tank for the other 
half of a cycle. 

3. Cold tank designed large and shallow. 

This would reduce the amount of drawdown to fill the specimen 
tank, thereby reduce the variation in temperature from the 
cooling plates to the top of the solution when the cold tank 
is full. With this type of design, and a larger reserve of 
fluid, the author does not see the necessity of maintaining 
a circulating unit for the cold solution. Cold tank should 
also be built large enough to hold all the solution of the 
system, in case of repairs to the system. Figure 8, represents 
a sketch of a possible design. 

4# Refrigerating Coils 

The use of coils for refrigerating a large shallow volume may 
prove more efficient than long, narrow cooling plates. 

5. Hot tank design. 

The present hot tank is satisfactory and does not need insulation 
because the thaw fluid is maintained near room temperature. 
However, this tank should also be built large enough to hold all 
the solution of the system. For simplification of design.

it could be built identical in size and shape to the cold 
tank* For protection to the immersion heaters, the outlet 
pump line should be just above the level of the immersion 
heaters, to ensure the heaters being under fluid at all times, 

6, Level of Probes, 

Probes in the cold tank should be set at such a height so that, 
with the specimen tank full, the level of the remaining 
solution in the hot tank will remain above the outlet pump 
line. Similarly, probes in the hot tank should be set so the 
solution in the cold tank will remain above the refrigerating 
coils. Probes in the specimen tank should be maintained* to 
safeguard against overflowing, and should be placed about 2§- rt 
above operating level, 

7, Specimen tank, pump lines, overflow. 

Specimen tank should be of such a size to allow free 
circulation around all the containers. 

Specimen containers should be increased to 20 inches in 
height, to allow the operating level of the circulating 
fluid to be above the level of the top of the specimens by 
at least one inch. Under present conditions, with the fluid 
below the level of the specimens, it is difficult to freeze the 
upper region of the specimens, and if freezing is accomplished, 
it is difficult to melt the ice cap forming over these specimens.

It is advisable to maintain screens, preferably in the 
specimen tank, to ensure proper functioning of the motor valves 
and check valves. Screens should be placed on the overflow 
line and on the bottom drain line. 

The overflow line, that is, the horizontal portions with 
upper halves removed, should be increased to 2-inch pipe, to 
allow a larger screening area and reduce the possibility 
of air locking at the screens. A reducer W T W fitting could 
be used to allow the remainder of the overflow line to remain 
14 -inch pipe, to accomodate the present motor valves. The 
screen on the drain line should be of sufficient area to 
allow proper drainage at all times, even when comparatively 
dirty, and be easily removable for cleaning. 

The incoming pump lines should be combined into one 
just before entering the specimen tank, and enter the bottom 
centre of the tank at right angles to the overflow line. 
Perforations in the pump line in the specimen tank should 
direct the fluid horizontally in both directions. This 
would reduce the temperature variation in the tank that exists 
presently by circulation in one direction only. 

Under present conditions, there is a check valve just 
above each pump, to prevent the fluid from returning to the 
wrong tank through the pump line. The possibility of using

two motor valves was investigated. This would ensure more 
positive closure of the pump lines, but would entail Increased 
expenses. However, if screens are maintained at all times 
in the specimen tank, check valves with about 10 feet of head 
should be satisfactory. Overflow and drainage by gravity 
line has shown no difficulty. Maintaining the specimen tank 
at a higher level than the cold and thaw tanks is a satisfactory 
arrangement. 

A sketch of a possible design of specimen tank and lines 
is shown in Figure 8. 

8. Switches 

The present arrangement of timing unit is satisfactory, except 
in size of relays. The drain valve is operated by a 1HXX 
tungsten contact relay, and the hot-and-cold return valves 
are operated by a double-throw 1XAX relay, with tungsten 
contacts. These are satisfactory, except that each relay 
should be completely enclosed to prevent dust or dirt from 
depositing on the contacts, thereby causing arcing, overheating, 
and periodical failure of operation of valves. These contacts 
are rated at 6 amps, which is ample for motor valves in present 
use. 

Normal current of the pumps is under 5 amps, but the 
present 6-amp, 1HXX tungsten contact relays are arcing due

to high starting current in the neighborhood of 40 amps. 
Relays of about 30 amps, completely enclosed, should prove 
satisfactory® A 30-second time delay switch has been placed 
in the pump relay circuits to allow motor valves to fully 
re-open after a power shortage stops the system. This is 
required to prevent a second stoppage by short-circuit on 
the probes in the specimen tank, due to pumps operating 
before motor-valves have fully re-opened* 

9® Refrigeration Unit 

A 5-H.P., 4-cylinder, low speed, water-cooled unit with the 
proper capacity, would likely be required for refrigeration. 

10. Freon (F-22) would have the advantage over Freon (F-3,2), 
in that it has a lower boiling point* 

These points are suggested by the author on the basis of 
experience gained during this investigation, and are not 
to be regarded as necessarily the most efficient design 
of operation. A thorough investigation would have to be 
carried out regarding such factors as dimensions, capacities, 
and heat transfer®

CHAPTER V 


TESTING MACHINE 


The load testing machine for measuring compressive strength 


of cylinders and flexural strengths of beams and bricks is a Baldwin 
Southwark Tate-Emery Testing Machine. It is a hydraulic, reaction-type 
load testing machine with a maximum capacity of 200,000 pounds. It has 
a pneumatic load indicator, and a load-pacer which enables the adjustment 
of the rate of loading. The load indicator has three ranges: 


(1) 0 - 10,000 lbs., in 10 lb. graduations 

(2) 0 - 50,000 lbs., in 50 lb. graduations 

(3) 0 - 200,000 lbs., in 200 lb. graduations. 


This enables the selection of the proper range of load for the testing 
required*

LABORATORY INVESTIGATION 




SYNOPSIS 


The purpose of the laboratory work carried out was to investigate: 

1. The effect of air-entrainment In manufactured brick, 
using Calgary materials* 

2. The effect of 2 cements (Type I and Type V) in manufactured 
brick, using Calgary materials* 

3. Comparison of water and steam curing in manufactured brick, 
using Calgary materials* 

4* A repeat of 1, 2, and 3 above, in bricks of plastic mix, 
using Calgary materials. 

5. Comparison of 3 cements, using Standard beams and 3*g- ,? x 8 W 
cylinders, with Edmonton materials* 

6. Comparison of 7 admixtures, using Standard beams and 
yk n x 8 H cylinders, with Edmonton materials. 

Cylinder compression tests, and beam or brick flexual tests were 
used to determine the effect of air-entrainment and cement on the strength 
characteristics of concrete* 

The effect of entrained air on the workability of the concrete was 
evaluated by the slump test and by visual inspection* 

Freezing-and-thawing tests were used to evaluate the durability 
(D.F.E.) of the concrete mixes, the modulus of elasticity being obtained by 
use of the sonic apparatus*

CHAPTER II 


TESTING PROGRAM 

A. Concrete Briekg 

Bricks were manufactured, using Calgary aggregates, in a Calgary 
concrete block manufacturing plant. A duplicate series of mixes were 
conducted, using: 

(1) Exshaw cement, no admixture. 

(2) Exsnaw cement, Darex A.E.A* 

0 

(3) Kalicrete cement, no admixture 

(4) Kalicrete cement, Darex A.E.A. 

Three different types of curing were applied to each mix* This 
gave, in reality, twelve lots of bricks, molded by n Vibra-pak” machine. 
From each lot, the following tests were conducted: 

(1) 4 bricks for Durability (D.F.E.) evaluation by the 
freezing-and-thawing test. 

(2) 2 bricks for flexural test. 

(3) 2 bricks for compression test. 

(4) 2 bricks for 3-day absorption test. 

The same materials were used in the laboratory to conduct two 
series of mixes of wet plastic concrete, with two conditions of curing. 
These were tested similarly to the manufactured bricks*

CHAPTER IV 


MIX DESIGN. SPECIMEN MANUFACTURE. AND CUBING 

Mix Design 

Mixes for manufactured bricks vary considerably from laboratory 
procedures. The workability is governed mainly by two conditions: 


(a) Mixes must be wet enough to enable stripping upon 


completion of molding* 

(b) They also must be dry enough to maintain their 

molded form after stripping is completed, and firm 
enough to be carried on racks or trays to the curing 

roora 0 


The workability of plastic concrete was controlled mainly by 
the slump test, (A.S.T.M. C143-39)# In the laboratory, all mixes for 
this investigation were designed for a slump as near 4 inches as possible* 
The design of a normal mix was carried out according to the 


A.C.I, Mix Design , s follows:

Weight/cubic yard 


Z 4000 lbs. 


Eighty lb. mixes were calculated by ratio of the weight (80 lbs.) 
to the weight/cubic yard of each mix. 

Normal mixes were redesigned for use as air-entrained mixes 



as suggested by M. A. Gordon. The sand content, by weight of total 
aggregate, was reduced about one percent for each percent of air-entrained. 
Water content was reduced to give a slump similar to that of the normal - 
mixes. Entrained air contents of A% was the objective. 


However, due to overcrowding in the laboratory during the day, 


all mixing was done in the evening. Under these circumstances, there was 
not sufficient time to discard any mixes that fell short of the objective in 
slump or percent entrained air. Duplicate mixes were adjusted to give 
quantities closer to the 4-inch slump and 1$ entrained air.

Bricks 


Plastic Concrete Bricks were cast in greased wooden molds, 
2 i" x x 7g- n . They were poured in 2 layers, each layer 
being rodded 25 times, and the sides spaded with a trowel.

Standard beams 3i n x 4i H x 16" were poured, using the 
same procedure as with bricks* 

3o Cylinders 

All cylinders poured were 3i n x 8”. They were poured 
in 2 layers, each layer being rodded 15 times* 

All specimens were stripped about 24 hours after molding, and 
cured until time of test. 

Four bricks were moist cured, and four hot-water cured. Two 
bricks from each lot were used for freezing-and-thawing tests, while the 
other two were used for flexural and compressive strength tests* 

Two beams from each mix were moist cured, one for freezing- 
and-thawing test, the other for a spare or control beam. 

Three cylinders were cast from each mix, and were broken in 
compression either 2 at 28 days and 1 at 45 days, or all 3 at 28 days, 
depending on which day freezing-and-thawing test began* 

As an added investigation, it was decided to compare the change 
in modulus of elasticity with the change in compressive strength, using 
the deteriorated beam from the freezing-and-thawing test, and the spare 
beam. This however, was not done in all cases, as the change in modulus 
of elasticity and change in modulus of rupture was compared in other 
instances.

doors are closed, and steam is introduced one hour later, 
for three hours. The following morning, doors are 
opened again, and specimens are evacuated t© open-air 
storage from one to three hours after the opening of 
the doors. Bricks for this investigation were packed - 
in sawdust for shipment to the laboratory, then air 
stored at room temperature. Specimens for compression 
and flexural tests were tested dry, while those for 
durability were immersed in water for 2 days before 
freezing-and-thawing test.

CHAPTER V 


TESTING PROCEDURES 


Compressive Strength Tests 

The cylinders were capped with a mixture of sulphur and fire¬ 
clay (3 to 1 by weight) to ensure square and level bearing surfaces. 
Their areas were obtained by averaging two diameters measured at right 
angles to each other near the centre of their length. Cylinders were 
tested in a moist condition in the Baldwin Southwark Emery-Tate testing 
machine, at a load application of 35 p.s.i. per second* 

Bricks were similarly capped on their flat surfaces and tested 
in the same machine. 

Beams tested in compression were first cut in two by a rotary 
diamond saw. 

Flexural Strength Tests 

Centre-point loading was applied by the Baldwin Testing 
Machine, with the beams or bricks supported at each end. The clear span 
for beams was 12 inches, while for bricks 6.5 inches. The modulus of 
rupture was computed from the following formula: 













. 









63 . 



( 2 ) 


where: 

ft - Modulus of rupture, p.s.i. 

M S Maximum bending moment due to applied load, ins.-lbs. 

y s -g- depth of specimen, inches. 

I - Moment of inertia about neutral axis 

= _“L , i„s/ 

12 


Durability Tests 

Beams and bricks were tested in the freezing-and-thawing apparatus, 
and sonic readings were taken with th© Sonic Apparatus. Volumes were best 
determined by weighing the specimens in air, then weighing them while 
submerged in water. An initial sonic reading was taken. Specimens were 
then put in the containers, which, in turn, were filled with water and 
placed in the specimen tank. Specimens went through a cycle of freezing- 
and-thawing every two hours. Sonic readings were taken at such intervals 
to enable intelligent plotting of Modulus of Elasticity against cycles of 
freezing-and-thawing. Normal mixes were read every cycle whenever possible, 
while air-entrained mixes were read two or three times the first day, then 
once daily till testing was completed. Specimens were tested until their 
Dynamic Modulus of Elasticity had decreased to 50 of its original value, 
or until 200 continuous cycles had been completed.

Number of cycles at which P reaches 50$, or 
the ultimate number of cycles of the test. 
Ultimate number of cycles of the test 


- 200 cycles* 


The Durability Factor (DFR) was evaluated from the formula:

where: 

DFR - Durability factor in percent, ratio of Modulus of 
Rupture of freeze-thaw beam to control beam*

Compressive Strength 

A. Plant manufactured bricks (runs #1, #2) 

The variation in strength from mix to mix, and from brick 
to brick of the same batch, does not enable any detailed 
comparison in compressive strength* In general, there appears 
no difference between Exshaw and Kalicrete cement, nor between 
air-entrained and normal mixes 0 However, on the basis of 
water-cement ratio, all strengths appear low. 

The effects of curing are more discernable, 28 days moist 
curing indicating somewhat higher results than 6 days moist 
curing followed by a period of air curing. Steam curing, 
tested dry, compares to the 6 days moist curing, tested moist. 

B. Laboratory specimens(runs #3, #4$ plastic mix) 

For water-cement ratios much higher than the ones for 
manufactured brick mixes, strengths are above those obtained 
in the plant manufacture. This indicates that the low strengths 
obtained lie not in the materials used, but in the manufacture, 
or the curing. 

Bricks hot-water cured show an average increase in strength 
of 4-iSS over the 28 days moist cured series. This increase 
is not, however, due entirely to the curing, as these were 
broken in the dry condition.

Two mixes show adverse cylinder results. Mixes ”K—4”, 
and "ED-6 n in the cement investigation, were mixed the 
same evening. All cylinder results are exceedingly low. 
However, the control beams of both mixes were broken in 
compression; and these gave normal results. This indicates 
an adverse reaction in the cylinders only, but no apparent 
cause was indicated. 

Specifications (A.S.T.M./C55-37) for bricks broken flatwise 
call for a minimum average compressive strength of: 

(a) 2500 p.s.i. for Grade A (bricks intended for use 
where exposed to temperature below freezing in 
the presence of moisture). 

(b) 1250 p.s.i. for Grade B (bricks intended for use 
as back-up or interior masonry). 

(c) individual results to be at least 80 % of the 


above in both cases

Flexural Strength 

A # Plant Manufactured 

Flexural strengths are low, for the w/c ratios of the mixes . 
Again, 28 days moist curing shows improvement over the 6 days 
moist curing followed by a period of air curing. Steam-cured 
bricks show the lowest results in flexural strengths, even 
though they were tested dry. 

B. Laboratory mixes 

The hot-water cured bricks, tested dry, show a reduction in 
flexural strength, compared to the 28 day moist cured ones, 
tested wet. The laboratory series indicate an average decrease 
in flexural strength of 10%, while the plant manufactured 
ones show an average decrease of 57%. 

A.S.T.M. Specifications for flexural strength: 

(a) 450 p.s.i. (Grade A) 

(b) 300 p.s.i. (Grade B) 

(c) Individual results 67% of the above values,.

Durability ip Freeze-Thaw 

A. Plant manufactured 

Figures 12 to 23 indicate the variation in durability, not 
only from mix to mix, but from brick to brick of the same mix* 
This is understandable when one views the variation in 
strength and in Modulus of Elasticity, the latter denoting 
also some variation in density. In general, the higher the 
Modulus of Elasticity of a specimen, the better the durability 
in freezing-and-thawing. 

Figure 24 is a plot of durability (D.F.E.) of the various 
mixes. From this plot, it appears that: 

(a) Exshaw and Kalicrete produce similar results* 

(b) Air-entrainment increased durability in the moist- 
cured series, but not in the steam-cured ones* 

(c) Steam-curing has lowered the durability.

B. Laboratory mixes 

Figures 25 to 32 represent the durability of the laboratory 
mixes. In general, 30 hours hot-water curing has slightly 
increased durability, compared to 45-days moist curing. 
Increased durability with air-entrainment is in the order 
of 5000 - 8000$. 

A 45-day moist cured 3 j> n x 4ir n x 16 ,! beam was frozen-and~ 
thawed at the same time as the bricks. Results compare 
favorably, the beam indicating a slight increase in durability 


Three-Dav Absorption 

An absorption test for the plant manufactured bricks was also 
conducted, as a further aid in analysis. The smaller value shown, Figure 10 
is the average absorption of the moist cured series, while the larger 
value applies to the steam cured specimens.

Conclusions 

Two main factors are indicated from all results: 

(1) A “Vibra-pak” machine is incapable of producing bricks 
of consistent density and strength. 

(2) Steam-curing and storage under present plant operation 
likely produces extensive surface cracks in the specimens 
which considerably reduce modulus of rupture and durability* 

"Vibra-pak" machines have interchangeable heads and molds, with 
the smallest specimen manufactured being the brick. Bricks are molded 
32 at one time, and 40,000 to 45,000 are capable of being manufactured 
during an 8-hour shift. 

The 32 molds form a grid, 4x8. These are filled by vibration 
and gravity alone, the materials being made available by a chain-driven 
belt. After a certain length of time, the material is brushed level with 
the top of the molds, and the 32 heads, all attached to one block, compact 
the ingredients by vibration and pressure, for three seconds. Following 
this, the molded specimens are lowered through the bottom end of the molds, 
onto a tray. Trays are stacked onto a rack and carried to the steam-curing 
room. 

It has been noted during plant operation, that some molds do 
not get completely filled before being compacted. Others, which appeared 
full and were brushed off level?ith the top of the molds, contained excessive 
air-gaps due to material piling up along one side of the mold. This is the 
main reason for the large variation in densities noted in the specimens 
brought back for laboratory investigation. Variations in strength are the

direct result of the variations in densities, coupled with the variation 
in voids being produced. 

The present method of steam curing and storage may have some 
effect on strength also. As previously stated, when a steam curing room 
is filled, doors are closed and steam is introduced one hour later, for a 
three hour period. Doors remain closed overnight, and are opened the 
following morning. From one to three hours later, specimens are brought 
out of the curing rooms and stockpiled in the open air. 

When the doors are opened, specimens are still very moist, at 
a temperature around 170° F. The atmosphere, coming in contact with the 
specimens, quickly brings the bricks to a surface-dry condition. This 
sudden contact with the outside atmosphere, coupled with a sudden reduction 
in temperature, causes excessive volume changes near the surface of the 
specimens. The central part of the specimens being still highly moist 
and not so readily susceptible to a reduction in volume, introduces the 
undesirable fact that extensive surface cracking may take place. This 
surface cracking is not so readily noted by visual inspection, but the 
matter is indicated by the reduction in flexural strength, in durability, 
and by the apparent increase in absorption. 

To reduce this undesirable condition, specimens, after steam- 
curing, should be cooled and dried slowly before being stockpiled. This 
matter, though increasing the overhead of plant operation, warrants 
further investigation.

Air-entrained plant mixes show very little increased durability. 

This is likely due to the comparitively dry mix required for plant manufacture. 
For an air-entraining agent to properly function, there must be sufficient 
moisture available in the mix to enable a foaming action to take place, 
for it is the foaming action which entrains millions of minute air bubbles 
between the sand particles. In plant mixes, there likely is not sufficient 
moisture available to enable the forming of many of these minute air bubbles. 

The small increase in durability of the air-entrained mixes 
suggests that some additional air has been incorporated. However, with 
the steam cured series, no apparent increase in durability has taken place. 
Air-entrainment has likely increased durability as in the moist cured series, 
but this increase has been counteracted by the disruptive frost action 
within the surface cracks. 

Another factor in steam curing should be investigated, the 
humidity in the rooms during curing. High temperatures with insufficient 
moisture available for rapid curing will not produce the desired strength 
qualities. Vapor-sealing of curing rooms would be one method of reducing 
moisture losses during steam curing.

CHAPTER VII 


DATA AND RESULTS OF, INVESTIGATION OF APICEXTURES 

Figure 33 contains a summary of data of mixes with various 
admixtures. This chapter refers primarily to cylinder compressive 
strengths and durability. Further reference to admixtures is made in 
Part III,which contains an investigation of beam compressive strength 
and dynamic modulus of elasticity. The amount of testing performed is 
insufficient for a full evaluation of air-entraining agents, but serves 
merely as a guide for further investigation.

Cylinder Compressive Strength 

It must be mentioned at this time that capping procedures considerably 
affected the ultimate strength of cylinders reported. Unfortunately, it was 
not until the latter part of this investigation that this factor was fully 
realized. An investigation of caps on specimens has clearly shown that 
ends of specimens must be surface dry before a cap will properly bond. 

If any moisture remains, the entire moist area will not be bonded, and 
a small, but very significant void will remain between the cap and the 
specimen. Once this factor was known, the variation in compressive 
strength of specimens was reduced from some 350 p.s.i. to less than 100 
p.s.i. in most cases. 

Pozzolith 5A, Pozzolith 8, and Ayr-Trap, indicate highest 
compressive strengths within the limits of this investigation, followed 
by Darex and Orvus, with Cheecol the lowest. Due to too great a variation 
in wettness of mixes, it is not possible to indicate the relative reduction 
in water wibh the use of the various agents. 

The addition of Calcium Chloride to a mix, both with and without 
Darex, has shown no increase in compressive strength, after 28 days, with 
neither the cylinders nor the beams. Two percent calcium chloride was 
combined with Darex in a mix to investigate the possibility of this combination 
offsetting the strength losses of air-entrainment. 

Figures 34 and 35 are graphs of cylinder compressive strength 
plotted against Water-Cement and Void-Cement Patios. Results of Cement 
Evaluation (runs #5, 6, 9, 10) were also plotted to indicate the relative 
strength obtained with the air-entraining agents.

Attention must be called to mixes ED-5 and ED-6, E-5 and'E-6, 
in the Cement Evaluation series, Figure 47. Mixes ED-7 and ED-3, E-7 
and E-3, are identical mixes. However, there appears a considerable 
reduction in w/c ratio in the latter. Sieve analysis of a sample of 
fine aggregate indicated only a minor change in grading, the Fineness 
Modulus having decreased from 2.3 to 2.7. 

E-7 and ED-7 have increased in strength, but these two mixes 
have a cement factor higher than 5*0 bags/cu.yd. 

But ED-3, E-3, ECC-7, EDCC-7, EDCC-8 indicate no increase in strength on 
the basis of w/c and v/c. This matter is more clearly indicated in 
Part III; it appears that the calculations of water content are in error, 
which may have been caused by free water in the mixer before ingredients 
were added.

Durability 

Figures 36 to 42 are plots of Modulus of Elasticity vs Cycles 
of Freezing-and-Thawing. 

The Durability (D.F.E.) was evaluated and plotted against 
Total Air Content, Figure 43. Durability appears to increase linearly 
with increase in air content, up to an optimum value of air content, 
after which the increase in durability begins to diminish rapidly, as 
indicated definitely by the Pozzolith 8 mixes. Optimum air content 
for any given mix is dependent, among other things, upon the quality of 
the concrete, and increases as the quality is reduced. The increase in 
durability for air contents above 5 to 6% for concrete containing J-inch 
aggregate and a cement factor of 5 bags/cu. yard does not warrant the 
consequent reduction in strength for higher air contents. It would have 
been advantageous, in this investigation, to have a third series of mixes 
at 7 to ® air content, to better determine an optimum value for each 
air-entraining agent. 

(1 o ) 

R. F. Blanks and W. A. Cordon v ' have shown that beyond the 
optimum air content of a mix, durability will begin to decrease. 

Pozzolith 5A, Ayr-Trap, Darex and Orvus show higher durabilities, 
with Cheecol again being the lowest. However, all air-entraining agents 
reported in this investigation show similar qualities, with Pozzolith 5A 
indicating about 25% increase in durability over Cheecol. 

Mixes previously mentioned showing no increase in compressive 
strength also show a decrease in durability. Since the fine aggregate 
was of similar quality throughout, it was decided to analyse the coarse 
aggregate. A check of mixing dates indicated that these mixes were the

last ones batched for this program. It was found that the coarse aggregate 
remaining in the bottom of the storage bin contained a significant amount 
of deleterious material in the form of nuts. An examination of the 
freeze-thaw beams showed that many of these nuts had expanded, powdered, 
and popped out. These nuts are the only evident reason for the low 
strength and durability of these mixes. 

The durability (D.F.R.) was also evaluated, based on the modulus 
of rupture of the control beam, which is not necessarily representative 
of the change in modulus of rupture by freezing-and-thawing, due to the 
use of two separate beams which may possess different qualities of strength, 
as indicated by their difference in dynamic modulus of elasticity. However, 
Figure 44 indicates an increase in durability with increase in air content, 
Pozzolith 8 again indicating the existence of an optimum air content. This 
increase in durability (D.F.R.) does not mean an increase in flexural 
strength with increase in air content* On the contrary, an increase in 
air content reduces the flexural strength, this statement being indicated 
in this report, and confirmed by reports of other investigators (14)^ 

Data available at the time indicated that each percentage increase in the 
amount of air above the amount which exists in plain concrete will reduce 
flexural strength 2 to 3$* These comparisons are based on the assumption 
that the percent of sand and the amount of water have been reduced in each 
case to the minimum consistent with satisfactory workability, also that the 
concretes have the same cement content.

Figure 45 represents Durabilities D.F.E. vs D.F.R. 

Durabilities vary nearly directly within limits of test. However, there 

is indication from Figures 44 and 45 that D.F.R. approaches 1 at air

contents greater than 5 $, while at 3% the same ratio is approximately 
3/2. Beam ,! E-9X n at C.F. 2 7.6 had a D.F.R. value of 53; there is 
reason to believe that normal mixes at C.F. s 5 would have a D.F.R. value 
in the neighborhood of 40 , as indicated. 

Figure 46 is a supplement to Figure 45 showing the effect 
of n recuperation” of dynamic modulus of elasticity if specimens are 
stored for a period after completion of freeze-thaw. Little is known 
to date about the subject. For the investigation in Part III, some 
beams, which had been stored after completion of 200 cycles of freezing- 
and-thawing, were again re-soaked and returned for further freezing-and 
thawing. It was noted that, not only had the modulus of elasticity 
increased from the final reading at 200 cycles, known as ”recuperation”, 
but that it remained constant for the first week of additional freezing- 
and-thawing, and then began to decrease very slowly. Whether a similar 
”recuperation” occurs in compressive strength is not indicated.

CHAPTER VIII 


DATA AND RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION OF CEMENTS 


Figure 4? contains a summary of data of the investigation of 
three Portland Cements, at cement factors of 5 and bags/cu. yard. 
Darex A.E.A. was used in all the air-entrained mixes. Insufficient 
testing does not enable a thorough evaluation, but work was performed 
as a guide to further investigation.

Cylinder Compressive Strength 

As previously mentioned, capping difficulties have caused 
undue variations in the reported cylinder strengths. As a further guide, 
compressive strengths of beams (column S^, Figure 47) will be helpful for 
analysis of results. 

Figures 48 and 49 are plots of cylinder Compressive Strengths 
vs Water-Cement and Void-Cement Ratios. Air-entraining agents discussed 
in Chapter VIII also appear in the figure, to indicate the relative 
strengths obtained with these. 

Figure 50 represents Compressive Strengths of cylinders and 
beams plotted against Cement Factor. Average results indicate a slight 
gain in strength with the use of Darex air-entraining agent, at a Cement 
Factor of 5 bags/cu. yard, and a loss in strength at the higher Cement 
Factor of 6r|- bags/cu. yard, the gain per percent entrained-air being 

about 1$, and the loss about 2$, respectively. These results are in 

........ . .. . .. . (10) (12) (15) (16) 

accord with findings of other investigators.

Durability 

Tests performed do not indicate conclusive results at the higher 
cement contents* Figures 51 to 57 are graphs of Durability (D.F.E.) vs 
Cycles of Freezing-and-Thawing. Figures 53 to 56 indicate a rapid 
reduction in dynamic modulus of elasticity after 100 cycles, in some 
beams. Inspection of these beams indicated a few nuts close to the 
surface of the beams which had expanded and popped out. It is thought 
that this would readily affect the dynamic modulus of elasticity. Other 
than this, beams appeared of good quality and showed no evidence of 
increase in surface spalling over other beams. 

Figure 58 is a plot of Durability (D.F.E. at 200 cycles) 
against Total Air Content. Circled mixes are those which showed a 
rapid reduction in dynamic modulus of elasticity after 100 cycles. 

However, at a cement factor of 5 bags/cu. Yard, there 
are two definite indications, within the limits of tests 

(1) the existence of an optimum 5-6$ total air content, 
above which durability is not appreciably increased. 

(2) using Darex A.E.A., mixes with Kalicrete Portland cement 
indicate a higher durability than those with Exshaw or Winnipeg Portland 
cement. 

As a further aid to analysis, D.F.E. was evaluated at 100 cycles, 100 
cycles being chosen arbitrarily as the point where the effects of the 
nuts had not become too disruptive. 








126 


Durability factors at the higher cement content were considerably 
increased, but at the air contents of these mixes, there is no conclusive 
evidence of increased durability over the 5 bag mixes. The one air- 
entrained mix at bags does not indicate any increased durability. 

However, with reference to data obtained by R. F, Blanks and 

( 12 ) 

W # A. Cordon, the optimum air content of a mix is reduced as the 

quality of the mix is increased, beyond which air content, there will 
be a reduction in durability. But the durability factor used was ’’number 
of cycles of freezing and thawing to failure”. No further explanation 
is given, but it is not thought that the durability factor used was 
evaluated by the dynamic modulus of elasticity. 

It is not certain whether durability (D.F.E.) will be reduced 
with mixes at air contents higher than the optimum value reported. 
Durability (D.F.E.) is dependent primarily on air content, but since it 
must depend also to some degree on the strength of the concrete, due 
to stress reversals during freezing-and-thawing, it may be possible to 
have durability reduced at high air contents, due to the reduction in 
strength with excessive air contents. This matter requires further 
investigation, not only at higher air contents than those reported 
here, but also at lower air contents for the rich mixes. Figure 59 
represents Durability (D.F.E.) at 100 cycles, with the dotted lines 
representing possible durability curves, based on the aforementioned 
article by R. F. Blanks and W. A. Cordon. Further investigation is 
required to definitely establish these durability curves, at air contents 
ranging from 3 to

ConclusIons 

The strength of air-entrained mixes, using Darex A.E.A. with 
the three Portland cements, Exshaw, Winnipeg, and Kalicrete, is increased 
by about ]$> per percent entrained air at a cement content of 5 bags/cu. yard, 
and is decreased about 2$ per percent entrained air at a cement content 
of % bags/cu. yard. 

For mixes using f n aggregate, and a cement content of 
5 bags/cu. yard, a total air content of 5 - 6$ appears the maximum 
desirable for durability. 

Using Darex as the air-entraining agent, mixes with Kalicrete 
cement indicated a higher durability than those with Exshaw or Winnipeg 
cement. 

Insufficient data does not permit an evaluation of durability 
at a cement content of 6g- bags/cu. yard; further investigation is 
required at air contents ranging from 3 to 8$. 

Cements affect the quantity of air entrained in a mix, for 
a given amount of air-entraining agent. Using Darex A.E.A., similar 
air contents were obtained in mixes with Kalicrete or Winnipeg cement, 
but with Exshaw cement, a higher quantity of agent was required. Also, 
the richer the mix, the higher the quantity of agent required for a certain 
desired air content. Figure 60 represents the amount of Darex used in 
this investigation, for mixes with aggregate.

PART III 


Investigation of Strength-Modulus Relationship, 

and 

Factors Affecting Durability of Concrete 



139 . 


CHAPTER I 

INVESTIGATION OF DYNAMIC MODULUS OF ELASTICITY AND COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH 

As an added investigation, it was decided to compare strength 
and modulus of elasticity before and after freezing-and-thawing. 

Specimens used were the spare beam and the freeze-thaw beam from the mixes 
reported in Chapters VII and VIII, Part II. All data and results are 
included in these chapters, and figures 33 and 47. As much data as 
possible was tabulated on each sheet, for easier comparison between 
mixes, and is not repeated here. 

Specimens will be hereafter referred to by their code name, 
and terms used will refer to their compressive strength or modulus of 
elasticity. Spare beams were moist cured 28 days, then stored at 
room temperature for a period varying from one to three months. They 
were immersed in water for two days before testing. "BJ, represents 
their dynamic modulus of elasticity, and W S£, their compressive strength. 

Freeze-thaw beams were moist cured 43 days and immersed in 
water for two days before freezing-and-thawing test. Some beams were 
stored for a period upon completion of freeze-thaw, and were re-soaked 
for two days before being broken in compression. Other beams were 
broken in compression upon completion of freeze-thaw, while, still 
others were given additional freezing-and-thawing before their compressive

strength was determined. "S 2 " denotes their compressive strength, and 
M E 2 n their dynamic modulus of elasticity just prior to compression. 
"E2( or ig # )" refers to their modulus at 45 days, just prior to freezing- 
and-thawing, and "E£(final) n > "their modulus at completion of freeze- 
thaw (either at 50$E or at 200 cycles), this value being used in the 
Durability Factor (D.F.E.) which has been previously discussed. Beams 
that were stored for a period after freeze-thaw have a value E 2 greater 
than E 2 (final); this increase in modulus has been referred to as 
'•recuperation 11 . Beams that were given an additional period of freezing- 
and-thawing are indicated by a value of "E 2 " smaller than "E 2 (final)", 
while those that were broken at completion of 200 cyles of freezing-and- 
thawing have the same values of r *E 2 " and (final)"* 

All specimens were vibrated, then cut in two with a "diamond- 
point" rotary saw. Portions were capped and broken in compression 
at a rate of load of 20,000 lbs./min. Specimens could not be cut into 
equal lengths with the rotary saw, consequently one portion of each 
beam had a length greater than twice the width, the other portion 
having a length to width ratio about 1.8. The majority of companion 
portions broke within 60 - 100 p.s.i. of each other, with the longer 
portion of specimen exhibiting the lower value. An average stress 
was arbitrarily chosen 20 - 40 p.s.i. below the maximum value. If 
the shorter portion exhibited end or capping effects, a value slightly 
higher than that of the longer portion was chosen. If the longer portion 
exhibited adverse effects, its strength value was discarded; and if 
both portions gave low values of strength, the average value was 
nevertheless plotted. 




» C S« 



Relation of Dynamic Modulus of Elasticity 

to Compressive 5trength 


The equation used for computations was:- 

- Ultimate Stress _ ^ S 

E - k Ultimate ’‘Strain" Factor " * q 

where 

E - dynamic modulus of elasticity 

S - average ultimate stress, as previously 
described 

s - "ultimate strain factor" 

k - variable, depending on conditions of test. 

For this report, it was simpler to let k s l.o, and explain 
relationship in terms of an arbitrarily named "Strain Factor", 
because there appeared no definite relation between dynamic "E" and values 
obtained from stress-strain relations in compression. 

The "Strain Factor" therefore became 

s - Ulti m ate Stress - S 
Dynamic "E" E 

An examination of "s" values indicated that, for equal cement 
contents, this value was influenced by air content. Therefore the Strain 
Factor was plotted against total air content, Figure 61, using the cement 
series at 5 and 6J- bags/cu. yard, with Darex as the air-entraining agent. 
It became apparent that, within the limits and accuracy of test, a linear 
relationship existed between compressive strength and dynamic modulus of 
elasticity. However, it would be advantageous to have results covering 
the full range of air contents to better conclude whether the relationship

also varied linearly with air content, A few beams from the brick 
investigation series were also similarly tested; since these mixes 
had normal air contents ranging from 2 - 2.5%, results would serve 
as a guide in deciding whether "Strain Factor" varied directly with 
air content. Within the accuracy of results from the graph for the 

mortar (runs #3, 4,), it appeared reasonable to assume a straight line 
relationship for the f" aggregate. 

Since it was also evident that cement content affected the 
Strength-Modulus relationship, best-fit straight lines were drawn 
through the points, allowing for the fact that some mixes were above 
or under the 5.0 and 6.5 cement content. 

It appears that the slope of the "Strain Factor" line 
becomes steeper with increasing cement content, other factors being 
constant. This cannot be definitely confirmed without further 
investigation. However, it seems reasonable that at increasing cement 
contents and higher strengths, air content would have a smaller effect 
on the strength-modulus relationship. 

From Figure 61, it is a simple matter to plot the strength- 
modulus relationship. Figure 62, Knowing the cement content, air content, 
and Dynamic "E" of a specimen, one may estimate its strength by the use 
of Figure 62, This chart, however, was developed from the average 
results contained in this report, and therefore will apply solely within 
the limitations and conditions of this investigation. Figure 62 warrants

further clarification. Though this graph has been drawn for dynamic n E u 
values ranging from 3.4 x 10^ to 4*8 x 10^ , there are limiting values 
of f, E" which can be obtained. For example, within the conditions of 
this investigation, it is highly improbable for a specimen at a cement 
content of 5 bags/cu. yard, and an air content of 'S, to ever obtain 
an ,r E H value of 4.8 x 10^ p.s.i. Similarly, a specimen at a cement 
content of 6^- bags/cu. yard will not likely ever have an ,r E H value as 
low as 3.4 x 10 6 p.s.i. 

Limiting values were not plotted due to insufficient data. 

At a cement content of 5 bags/cu. yard, dynamic ”2” has varied from 
3.5 x 10^ p.s.i. at an air content of 5%, to 4*3 x 10^ p.s.i. for a 
normal mix. At a cement content of 62 bsgs/cu. yard, dynamic "E 11 has 
varied from 3.3 x 10^ p.s.i. at an air content of 6$, to 4*6 x 10^ p.s.i. 
for a normal mix. 

An estimate of the range of M E 11 values to be expected, for 
the conditions reported, would be: 

(a) at a cement content of 5 bags/cu. yard 

(1) 3.7 x 10 to 4.3 x 10 p.s.i. for normal mixes 

(2) 3.5 x 10^ to 4.0 x 10^ p.s.i. for mixes

Factors Affecting Strength-Modulus Relationship 


Various factors affecting this relationship are noted in this 
report, some of which are confirmed by findings of other investigators* 

These factors are: 

1. Cement Content 

This is clearly indicated in Figure 61 and confirmed 
by other findings. 

"An increase in the quantity of cement in the batch causes 

an increase in values of modulus of elasticity and strength. 

The modulus of elasticity is affected somewhat less by 

(17) 

changes in cement than the strength.” 

”In general, the richer the mix, other things remaining 

(IS) 

constant, the higher the modulus of elasticity.”' ' 

”For a given aggregate, an increase in the ultimate strength 

(19) 

is accompanied by an increase in the modulus of elasticity.”' 

2. Moisture Content of Specimens 

, Though variations due to this factor are not indicated 

here because all beams were immersed in water for two days, 

moisture content will have a definite bearing 

on the strength-modulus relationship. 

”Other things remaining equal, the modulus of elasticity 

of a given concrete when the pore spaces are filled with 

water is materially greater than for the same concrete when 

air dry. That is, while the effect of free moisture within 

the mass is to decrease the compressive strength, the modulus 

(13) 

of elasticity is thereby increased.”

"Evidence that the dynamic modulus varies with the moisture 
content of the specimens is shown by the fact that the 
dynamic modulus increases during water curing and decreases 
during air curing*" 

3* Size and Quality of Aggregate 

The effect of aggregate is shown in the two series at 
cement content of 5 bags/cu. yard, namely the f-" aggregate 
and the mortar. Various reports ( 18 )(21)(22)(23)(25) 
have indicated the effect of size of aggregate, and their 
quality. 

"It appears that, other things being equal, concrete for 

which the coarse aggregate is a dense metamorphic sandstone 

has a higher modulus of elasticity than does a concrete for 

which the concrete aggregate is a crushed granite*" 

"Aggregates produce a decided effect on the elastic 

properties of concrete, stone having a high modulus of 

elasticity developing correspondingly higher moduli in 

(2l) 

the concrete than stone having low moduli*"' 

"The modulus of elasticity varies with the coarse aggregate 
used-/ 22 ) 

"In tests conducted on slag concrete the modulus of elasticity 
by the dynamic and compression methods was considerably less, 
for the slag, than for standard aggregate concrete, although 
the compressive strengths were not materially different 
at 28 and 90 days."^ 23 '

Though, for this report, the size of specimen was identical 

throughout, it is a known fact that size will affect both the 

modulus of elasticity ^ and the ultimate strength, but it 

is not definitely known whether these will be affected to 

the same degree. 

5. Curing and Age of Specimen 

For this investigation, all spare beams were moist 

cured 28 days, then stored in air for one to three months. 

The period of air storage will have little or no effect on 

compressive strength after 28 days moist, as is indicated 

( 2 /.) 

by curing curves published by the A.C.I. ' 

Curing temperatures will affect the strength of 
concrete. At early ages, the higher the curing temperature, 
the higher the strength; however, high curing temperature 
may result in relatively low strength at later ages,' 

To what degree these factors will affect the strength- 
modulus relationship is not definitely known. 

”Both the modulus of elasticity and strength increase with 
the age of the concrete, so long as the specimens are kept 
moist during curing. The strength increase is proportional 
to the logarithms of the age. The modulus of elasticity 

(17) 

follows approximately the same relation.” 




"For a given aggregate, hatch proportions, type of cement, 

and water-cement ratio, the relationship between the development 

of the dynamic modulus of elasticity and the age in days 

(25) 

appears to be consistent for practically all specimens!! 

"For a given set of conditions, the relationship between 

the dynamic modulus of elasticity and the flexural strength 

is a linear function, with this relationship being different 

for different coarse aggregates, and probably for different 

(2 

cements, proportions, and slump also."' 1 
"Proper curing, including the avoidance of drying of the 
test specimens and care in their early handling to prevent 
cracks, is very essential in avoiding a distortion of both 
the dynamic modulus of elasticity-age relationship and 
the dynamic modulus of elasticity-flexural strength 
relationship."^ ^ 

"The factors which affect the dynamic modulus-age relation¬ 
ship also affect the dynamic modulus-flexural strength 

(25) 

relationship, although not in the same degree."' ' 

6. Mixing Time 

"Tests for mixing times varying from i to 10 minutes 

xhow both the modulus of elasticity and strength to be 

(17) 

greater for longer mixing times.-"' 





39 






30 







_ r n 




: I 





However, it has not been shown whether these are affected 
to the same degree. 

7. Fineness Modulus of Sand 

M For sand gravel concrete, there is a decided tendency 
for the value of E to increase with an increase in 
fineness modulus. No relation between E and fineness 
modulus within limits of test."(19) 

Fineness modulus also has some affect on strength of 
concrete; whether both E and strength are affected 
proportionally is not known. 

8. Brand of Cement 

It is thought that brand of cement may affect the 

(25) 

modulus-strength relationship, but there is no 
indication of this within the limits of this 
investigation. 

9* Air Content of Mix 

This factor has been established beyond reasonable 

doubt in this investigation, the ratio of S varying 

E 

proportionally with air content, at equal cement contents. 
Though this factor has not been directly referred to by 
other investigators, the effect of air entrainment on 
strength and on dynamic modulus has been separately 

shown. (15) 

At a cement factor of 5 bags/cu. yard, air-entrained 
mixes have shown a slight increase in strength over 
the normal mixes; therefore if S is increased and E is 




' / '' ■- 


,1 " 


", '! , 






r*?Oi iOicf 




o;r b 3 ■' 1 3 


* **<■ 




decreased, the ratio S should increase with increasing 
E 

air content, within the air content obtained in this 

report. At the 6£ bag mixes, the air-entrained mixes 

have decreased in strength compared to the normal mixes, 

by about 2$ per percent air, and E value has decreased 

by about 3% per percent air. The ratio of S will 

E 

still increase with air content, but not so much as 

with the 5 bag series. This is a further substantiation 

of the steeper "strain factor" line in Figure 61, at 

the 6§- bag cement content. Citing a specific example, 

6$ air content (mix ED-10), has reduced the strength 

about 300 p.s.i. (10$); E value has been reduced some 

0.76 (17$); therefore, the ratio S is still increasing 

E 

with air content, but not as much as at 5 bag cement 
content, where E is decreased by air content, and S is 
slightly increased. 

Air-Entraining Agent 

The ratio S was also plotted for the various admixtures 
E 

at a cement content of 5 bags/cu. yard. Though results 
are not numerous enough for a definite conclusion, there 
is a clear indication that air-entraining agents will 
affect the strength-modulus relationship. It is interesting 
to note that Pozzolith 5A and Ayr-Trap which showed an 
increase in strength over Darex, and an increase in

durability, also show the same increase in "strain 

factor" S ratio^at similar air contents. In other 
E 

words, it appears that the dynamic modulus, once the 

factors which have a direct effect on it are known, can 

be a definite indication of strength and quality of 

the concrete. Durability in freezing-and-thawing, which 

is dependent primarily on air content and quality of 

mix, may also be judged, on a comparative basis, by the 

dynamic modulus of elasticity. It is interesting, and 

very encouraging, to note that strength, durability, 

and S ratio show the same order of comparability, at 
E 

equal cement contents. Pozzolith 5A, which indicated

indicates the highest S ratio. Cheecol which indicated 

E 

the lowest strength and durability, also indicates the 

lowest S ratio. Cheecol, Darex and Orvus, within the 
E 

limits of test, produced nearly equal strength results. 

In Durability, Qrvus indicated a slight increase over 

Cheecol and Darex, and the same slight increase is 

indicated by the S ratio.

These factors have some effect on the modulus-

inconsistent in S ratio, but appeared erratic on the

S ratio may be some indication that these factors have

Water-Cement and Void-Cement Ratios 


Compressive Strengths were plotted against Water-Cement and 
Void-Cement Ratios, Figure 63. 

For this analysis, various mixes will be referred to by their 
code names. 

In Figure 61, ED-3, KD-5, and ECC-S show an S ratio considerably 

E 

lower than required. It was mentioned earlier that these mixes were 

also plotted, even though both portions of the beam exhibited some 

capping and/or end effects. The fact that these mixes also appear 

considerably low in strengths, Figure 63, bears substantiation to the 

importance of the Strain Factor, S ratio. For example, ED-3 should have 

E 

an S ratio of 5.43 x 1CT H in/in. With its E value of3.65 x 10 p.s.i., 

E 

its compression strength would be I960 p.s.i. In Figure 63, this 

value of strength would plot very well on the basis of Water-Cement 

and Void-Cement Ratios. Similarly for KD-5 and ECC-3. 

Two mixes, however, have shown the reverse trend, that of 

higher than average strength. KD-6 and E-7, allowing for their cement 

content of 5*00 and 5.13 respectively, appear to have too high an S ratio, 

E 

Figure 61. It would be a simple matter to say that their calculated dynamic 

modulus may be in error and that the Strain Factor S should be reduced. 

E 

In Figure 63 though, both mixes appear to have a higher than normal strength 
both on the basis of Water-Cement and Void-Cement ratios. The only 
deductible explanation is that these two mixes have shown higher than 
normal strengths for some unknown reason, or else there may be an error

in calculation or weighing, of the mix proportions, which would alter 
the indicated values of cement-content, n /c and v/c ratios* 

However, before the validity of calculations is reproached, 
another important factor must be brought to light. Different specimens 

from the same mix or batch may give different strengths. This has 

* (21) 

been indicated throughout this report and is confirmed by H. A. La Hue. 

’’Values of modulus on individual cylinders of -any single mix often varied 

( 21 ) 

more widely than that exhibited by any two sets of different proportions.” 

If one accepts the strength-modulus relationship, then it is evident 
that specimens from the same batch can vary in strength, as is clearly 
indicated by the variation between E^ (spare beam, 28 days moist cured), 
and E 2(ori») ^ reeae “^ aW ^ eam > 45 days moist cured), shown in Figure 47. 

The change in E value from to E 2(orig)’ has varied from -3? to +22$. 

This variation in E value and strength in specimens of the same mix is 
further borne out by the fact that some freeze-thaw beams had higher compressive 
strengths after 200 cycles than their companion spare beam. 

It is therefore, evident that strengths of specimens cannot 
be compared on the basis of Water-Cement and Void-Cement Ratios by the 
result of only one specimen per mix, as indicated in Figure 63. However, 
results do indicate that at equal w/c, air-entrainment reduces compressive 
strength, and at equal v/c, the opposite is true. This is in agreement 
with other investigators. 

Mixes E-3 and ECC-7, though they appear correct in S ratio, 

E 

are low in strengths on the basis of w/c and v/c ratios. Based on the 
fact that these mixes should be identical to E-5 and E-6 except for the 
addition of CaCl 2 in ECC-7, there is reason to suspect the accuracy of 
the w/c ratio for mixes #7 and #8. Since E-5 and E-6 had w/c ratios 



over #80, and in view of the fact that the strengths of E-8 and Ecc-7 

appear correct by their S ratio, it appears that their w/c ratios should 

E 

be in the neighborhood of .80. However, this would also increase the w/c 
ratio of E-7 which already has higher than average strength. As mentioned 
before, E-7 has a cement content higher than 5#0 bags/cu. yard, which would 
increase it strength somewhat above that of mixes with the same w/c ratio, 
but slightly lower cement content. 

During the latter part of this program, the author acquired a 
new laboratory assistant, who operated the mixer while the next batch was 
being weighed* It was noted at one time that the mixer, which was 
dampened before each mix, was not allowed to drain entirely before ingredients 
were added. A small amount of free water, though appearing insignificant 
in the mixer, can be an important factor in the calculation of results 
of the small mixes made for this investigation* It would have been better, 
had time permitted, to have made a trial mix to "condition 11 the mixer 
before the mixes for this report. Another improvement would be the 
batching of larger quantities at one time, so that the effects of water 
in the mixer and amount of mortar remaining adhered to it would be reduced 
to an insignificant percentage of the mix proportions. 



W: 



Compressive Strength Before and After Freeze-Thaw 


Figure 64 is a plot of percentage change in compressive strength 
after freeze-thaw vs percentage change in dynamic modulus of elasticity. 

Though there appears a large variation in results, it is evident 
that change in strengths do not vary directly with change in the dynamic 
modulus as calculated herein. 

An average relation between change in strength and change in 
dynamic modulus for results presented here would be: 

% Sa/Sn = % (§2) * 

where E^ and are the values obtained before freeze-thaw, and and 
S 2 after freeze-thaw. 

Results presented may not be very accurate. E 2 was computed 
using the dimensions obtained before freeze-thaw. However, deterioration 
in the form of surface spalling will have a marked effect on the vibration 
of a specimen. 

Compressive strength, S^, was calculated using the outside 
measurements for the calculation of area, which again can easily be 
in error. Beams were cut in two with the diamond saw, capped and broken. 
End effects were noticed throughout due to the surface deterioration at 
the exposed ends of the portions* Had time permitted, it would have 
been better to cut about one inch off the ends of the specimens, in 
order to obtain a solid bearing surface for compression.

Compressive strengths shown are therefore, on the low side, 
not only due to the end effects mentioned, but also due to the fact 
that ‘’effective area” of specimen would be somewhat smaller than the 
’’gross area” measured. 

”E” values shown should probably be increased, if effective 
dimensions could be accurately measured. For example, suppose surface 
spalling had reduced all original dimensions by 0.2 ins. (0.1 ins. on 
all surfaces). This would reduce ”1^” about 5$, and decrease ”d 2 ” 
about 21$. This would increase the dynamic modulus about 20$ above 
that obtained using the original dimensions. On the same basis, 
strengths obtained would be increased about 5 - 10$. 

There may be more factors than these enumerated which affect 

the values of dynamic modulus and compressive strength after freezing- 

and-thawing. Though the S ratio appears constant before freeze-thaw for 

E 

given conditions the same relationship does not apply after freeze-thaw, 
at least not by the present method of calculation. 

Flexural strength and dynamic modulus appear to vary more 
directly, as indicated in Chapter VII. This is understandable, due 
to the fact that both the dynamic modulus and flexural strength depend 
largely on the surface conditions of the specimens. E. F. Preece' 1 
has found a fairly linear relationship between dynamic modulus and 
flexural strength.

Summary and Conclusions 


With such factors constant as cement content, size and quality 
of aggregate, moisture content, curing, age, consistency, mixing time, 
and air-entraining agent there appears a linear relationship between 
compressive strength and dynamic modulus of elasticity, this relationship 
varying uniformly with air content, within the air contents used in 
this investigation* 

On a comparative basis, this relationship can be a valuable 
aid in analysis of reaults, not only in the comparison of strengths, 
but in the estimate of relative durability without the use of a freeze- 
thaw apparatus* The relationship can be written in the form: 


S Z KE 

where 

S - compressive strength, p.s*i. 

E - dynamic modulus of elasticity, p.s.i, 

K ~ a constant for a given set of conditions, with its 

absolute value depending on: 

(1) cement 

(2) cement contents 

(3) air content of mix 

(4) air-entraining agent 

(5) size and quality of aggregates 

(6) workability, consistency, slump 

(7) age and curing 

(8) moisture content of specimen 

(9) size and shape of specimen 

(10) mixing time*

However, the same relationship does not appear to apply 

after a period of deterioration in the form of freezing-ard-thawing, 

using the method of calculation presented herein. It could be possible, 

though, to have the same relationship be true, if the dynamic modulus 

(27) 

were allowed to "recuperate” fully. R. C. Valore, Jr. has shown that 
specimens, which were stored in water for one year after having been 
subjected to freezing-and-thawing, had recovered up to 75 % of their 
loss in dynamic modulus during freeze-thaw. Further investigation 
is required to determine the effect of recuperation after accelerated 
freezing-and-thawing before any conclusions could be drawn on the 
strength-modulus relationship after freeze-thaw.

CHAPTER II 


FACTORS AFFECTING DURABILITY OF CONCRETE 


Methods of freezing and thawing of concrete in the laboratory 
will affect, to a considerable extent, results obtained by the dynamic 
modulus of elasticity, change in length, or loss in weight. 

A summary of various factors brought out by previous 
investigations will serve as a further guide to others carrying on 
laboratory investigations. 

Determination of relative durability by: 

1. Loss in weight of specimens. 

(a) porous, low-strength concrete will exhibit loss 
in weight as freezing-and-thawing progresses. 

(b) most high-strength concrete will lose little weight until 
they are in the stage of incipient disintegration, 

at which stage they have lost nearly all their 
strength. 

(c) loss in weight is much greater when the freezing 

specimens is in contact with water than when it 

is in contact with air* 

(27) 

2. Expansion of specimens. 

Investigations were carried out by R. C. Valore, Jr. on 
volume changes of concrete cylinders.

(a) Air-dry specimens 

Volume-temperature relationships were virtually 
lines whose slopes were the thermal coefficients 
of cubical expansion for the concrete. Linear 
expansion coefficients are considered l/3 of the 
cubical values. 

(b) Vacuum-saturated specimens. 

For totally saturated specimens, the phenomenon 
is not a linear relationship. During a slow cycle 
of cooling from +40° F, specimens contracted 
uniformly to approximately +25° F, at which point 
considerable expansion took place, due to the 
freezing of water within the pores. During this 
time, the temperature of the specimens rose to 
about 31° F 1 , and then returned to equilibrium at 
25°, indicating a ’’supercooling 11 effect, that is, 
as indicated by volume changes, specimens were 
cooled below the apparent freezing point of water 
without inducing freezing. The resumption of 
cooling to -25° F produced further increases in 
volume. 

Heating produced first, additional increases in 
volume up to about +15°F, then contractions to

31°F, at which point the specimens were completely 
thawed. Further heating produced uniform increases 
in volume. 

Maximum volume expansions were- 0.80$ at -25°F 
for the plain concrete and 0.75$ for the air- 
entrained concrete. Residual expansions at 40°F, 
at completion of one cycle, were 0.40$ for the 
plain and 0.31$ for the aerated. 

One week after the test, the decrease in dynamic 
"E" was about 65$, and it was estimated that 
immediately after the test, the decrease in 
had been about 90$, indicating, for practical 
purposes, the almost complete destruction resulting 
from one cycle of freezing and thawing. 

This high degree of saturation is not likely to 
be attained in masses of concrete exposed to 
natural weathering; however, a fairly complete 
saturation may occur in upper layers of horizontally 
exposed surfaces. Volume changes of the magnitude 
indicated could then injure the surface as to promote 
scaling. 

(c) Partially saturated specimens. 

Volume changes during slow cooling indicated not 
only the normal thermal contraction, but also that 
of a "shrinkage ?, factor, this latter phenomenon

occuring as an effect of freezing, having been 
absent in the behaviour of air-dry specimens. 

Some expansion was also noted when the water froze, 
but not to the extent of the vacuum-3aturated 
specimens. After freezing, with equilibrium attained, 
additional cooling produced continuous, but not 
always uniform, contraction. After heating, there 
remained a certain amount of residual expansion. 
Additional cycles produced additional residual 
expansions. 

Specimens were subjected to various types of cycles, 
slow and fast cooling, combined with slow and fast 
heating. It was noted that the faster the rate of 
cooling, the smaller was the contraction during 
cooling, and it also appeared that slow thawing 
may be more destructive than fast thawing. 

One type of cycle (slow cooling - fast heating) 
produced residual contractions in the specimens, 
but it is doubtful that specimens were improved 
by the treatment. 

The following ranking of some of the cycles, in 
order of increasing residual expansions, was given: 

(1) slow cooling - fast heating 

(2) slow cooling - slow heating 

(3) fast cooling - fast heating 

(4) fast cooling - slow heating

Transient and residual expansions for partially 
saturated specimens were very much smaller in 
magnitude than those observed for vacuum-saturated 
specimens, and appeared to depend on: 

(1) degree of saturation 

(2) rates of cooling and heating 

(3) degree of supercooling before freezing, 
for the slow cycle. 

Differences between plain specimens and those 
containing an air-entraining agent appeared to be 
limited to differences in degree of saturation. 

Such variables as brand or type of cement, type of 
aggregate, and curing, were not included in this 
study, also the range of temperature used was from 

+40°F to -25°F. 

3. Change in dynamic modulus of elasticity, 

(a) It has been shown that, other things being equal, 
a lowering of the thawing temperature accelerates 
the decrease in dynamic E. 

(b) Degree of saturation of aggregates, and of the 
concrete. 

(c) Rate of freezing-and-thawing. 

(d) Type of freezing-and-thawing, whether in air or 
in water. 

(e) Behaviour of aggregate particles at or near surface 


of specimen,

4® Summary of factors influencing the resistance of 
concrete to freezing-and-thawing.

(b) degree of saturation of aggregates 

(c) degree of saturation of concrete

(f) quality of aggregates 

(g) temperatures employed in freezing-and-thawing 

(h) duration of freeze-thaw cycle 

(i) type of freezing 

Freezing in air is much less severe than 
freezing in water even though the specimen is 
saturated when frozen, and freezing in water exposed 
to cold air is less severe than freezing in water 
in contact with brine. 

0) surface of concrete 

It has seemed that surfaces that are molded 
against oiled forms have a tendency to be more 
resistant than trowelled surfaces or surfaces 
formed by exposing the interior of the concrete 
by sawing.

(k) cement-aggregate combination 

Some combinations of cement and non-reactive 
aggregates have shown poor resistance, while com¬ 
binations of other cements and the same aggregates 
have shown very good resistance. 

(l) presence of salts and crystal growth 

The sulphates and chlorides of calcium, magnesium, and 
sodium are apt to give the most trouble; their 
interaction with calcium aluminate to form double 
salts with volume expansion is a cause of worry. 

Probable greater harmful effect is often produced 
by oriented crystal growth. As temperature is 
slowly lowered in the concrete, opportunity is 
provided for the crystal growth of many salts 
predominantly along one axis, and the forces 
involved in such crystal growth are of the order 
of 100,000 p.s.i. or more. 

However, in the actual exposure of most concrete, 
variable moisture conditions are encountered, which 
may produce a variety of effects: 

(1) detrimental sulphuric acid of winter 
rains or soluble salts may be carried in, 
under certain conditions. 

(2) a beneficial leaching action may be 
brought about whereby deleterious salts 


are removed 





171 , 


(3) with moisture changes, the growth of 
crystals is often found immediately 
behind the surface of the concrete. 

Any surface skin or crust is often pushed 
off by the developing crystals. 

(4) moisture in the concrete promotes 
autogenous healing so that the harmful 
effects of the various disintegrating 
forces are often more or less repaired, 
given moist conditions and time. 

Laboratory freezing-and-thawing tests are not a direct measure of 
the durability to be expected of concrete in the field. What is actually 
determined in the laboratory is the relative ability of specially fabricated 
samples to withstand the effects of rapid and continuous alternations of 
artificial freezing-and-thawing. These effects cannot be expected to be 
consistently similar to the effects of outdoor exposure. Other weathering 
processes, such as wetting and drying, and daily temperature changes, 
without freezing or thawing, also are known to affect concrete. Therefore, 
the freezing-and-thawing tests purport to measure only one phase of concrete 
durability. It has not as yet been found possible to accurately estimate 
durability from an analysis of any of the more easily measured physical 
properties of concrete.
