CHAPTER 1 


PURPOSE OP THE INVESTIGATION 

At present, in Alberta, students enter High School 
with a grading of H, A, B or G. The average student, in 
the A and B group, seems to be well provided for in our 
curriculum; the two extreme groups, (the H and C students) 
do not seem to be so fortunate. 

Generally, it is taken for granted that the ,} H fJ 
student, being, as a general rule, of high intelligence, can 
look out for himself. The tt C M student is the real problem. 

The Alberta school curriculum states that the ,f C* ? 
student can not offer any of the regular mathematics courses 
until he has obtained satisfactory credit in General 
Mathematics 1. The General Mathematics course must thus 
serve a double purpose. It must be worthwhile in itself and 
at the same time it must give the student the proper ground¬ 
work for Algebra and Geometry. 

Very few students take this course unless they are 
tt C M students. A H G 91 grading implies a weakness somewhere. 

Of course we may have a very capable W G W student. The low 
grading may be due to sickness or too many outside interests. 
Nevertheless it is a generally accepted fact that the "G® 
student is usually much below normal in ability to do school 
wo rk. 

Since we live in a democratic country we must try to

give even these weaker students a fair opportunity. The 
General Mathematics course must be so planned as to meet the 
needs of these failures in the academic race. 

We must not take too much for granted in this course. 
We will find students who do not know the multiplication 
tables, who add by some form of counting, who place decimals 
by guess, and who try to solve most problems by attempting 
to apply some rule that was memorized while the meaning of 
that rule is to them what the fourth dimension is to most 
of us. 

What has all this to do with graphs in General 
Mathematics? It is of fundamental importance; for one must 
use methods suited to the particula,r group with which one is 
working. An explanation of the radio to senior engineering 
students and to children in the lower grades will naturally 
be much different* Our treatment of graphs should likewise 
be different. 

The next question which someone may ask is, w Why 
teach graphs?” Without entering into the age-old question 
of the value of discipline subjects and transfer of training, 
I think we answer this question best by saying that we teach 
graphs because this is one of the best ways to help the 
student really understand what he is doing. Instead of using 
abstract symbols he can visualize his problem. He has a 
chance to really grasp the essentials. It gives him a chance 
to test his results in an objective manner.

Graph s are not something to be found only in school 
and in a particular subject, but they are met early in life 
and they are with us to the grave. The baby expresses how 
much he wants by a primitive form of graph; the fi she man 
describes the fish that got away in a like manner. It is a 
form of expression which is so simple, so understandable, 
that it can be used to convey messages even to those who 
understand little or none of our language. It is a 
universal language in itself. 

The essential purpose of this investigation is to 
take one field of work in General Mathematics and try to 
discover a suitable program for this particular field. That 
is, we hope to learn from this study in the one field, methods 
which will serve as a guide to the problem of successfully 
treating the entire course.

CHAPTER 11 


EARLY TESTS IS GRADES Vll TO Xll 

In an attempt to find out what the various classes 
of students knew about graphs I gave three short tests. 

Though the tests were not comprehensive enough to give 
conclusive evidence of graphical abilities, still, I believe 
they give us a fairly good indication of these abilities. 

The first test consisted of twelve graphical terms 
which were to be defined. Probably several of these terms 
should have been deleted and more appropriate terms 
substituted, but it was only after X had received the answer 
papers that I realized some of these points. 

In test two, I tried to make some of the problems 
easy enough for all students and some of the problems 
difficult enough for any student. How well I succeeded is 
shown clearly by the results. 

The third test dealt with interpretation of graphs. 

To learn how to read a graph and to learn how to construct 
one, are two different, though related, problems. After 
receiving the returns I regretted the fact that this test had 
not been comprehensive enough. 

Copies of the tests were given to the students and 
they were allowed as much time as they needed to finish all 
the questions. They were asked to answer every question 
even if they were uncertain as to the correctness of their 
response.

These tests were given to a fairly large number of 
students in various classes before the topic of graphs had 
been taken up this year. The same tests were then given to 
similar classes later in the year, after the topic of graphs 
had been taken in the school. 

The tests were given to Grades VI, Vll, Vlll, and 
IX in this school as well as to General Mathematics students. 
The records for Grade VI are omitted since they seemed to 
show that the tests were too difficult for them. I am 
including Vll and Vlll records to show the comparison between 
these grades and higher grades. 

The tests were given to village, town and city schools. 

* 

The various classes tested were Grade IX, Algebra 1, General 
Mathematics 1, General Mathematics 2, Grade Xll Mathematics. 

In my own school*s records X kept each pupil f s score 
separate and also found the I.ft. of the pupil. The results 
of the tests when compared with the I.ft. ratings furnish much 
material for speculation, but since I could not obtain this 
information from all the other schools X have omitted it in 


the records given here

Test 1 - Definitions. 

Give a definition of each of the following terms. 
Give an example if it will aid you in explaining the term. 

(a) Graph 

(b) Pictogram 

(c) Horizontal Axis 

(d) Broken Diagram or Broken Axis 

(e) Round Humber 

(f) Drawing to Scale 

(g) Negative Humber 

(h) Average 

(i) Ratio 

(j ) Independent Variable 

(k) Dependent Variable 

(l) Inverse Variation 

In scoring the test, the definition was considered 
correct if it showed that the student had a reasonable idea 
of the meaning of the term. Incorrect and omitted answers 
were scored separately.

Comments on Results of Teat 1 in Grad e s Vll, and Vlll .- 
These tests were given in the first part of December before 
the topic "graphs” was taken up in these grades. 

Most of the pupils gave the definition for a broken 
line graph when required to give the definition of a broken 
axis or broken diagram. One pupil knew what a broken axis is. 

Very few students in grade seven could correctly define 
"round numbers". Several of the answers indicated that a 
round number was a whole number or a vulgar fraction, not a 
mixed number. One pupil in grade eight showed he had a sense 
of humor at least, for his definition was, "an example of a 
round number is 0". 

The definitions of the terms; Drawing to Scale, 
Negative Humber, and Average were reasonably good. The tern 
"Ratio" proved to be quite difficult. Most of the incorrect 
answers here were due to the confusion of the term with 
"radius”. The pupils did not know the meanings of the last 
three items on the test*

Comments on Grade IX Teat 1,- The only items that 
seem to call for comment are "d" and "i M . In place of the 
definition of "Broken Axis or Broken Diagram" nearly all of 
the students gave the definition for a broken line graph. 

As to the definition of "ratio" I believe some of the answers 
given will best indicate the type of errors made; 

Ratio is the sum which equals two sides. 

Ratio is the difference between two numbers. 

Ratio is the proportion 2=2 the ratio is 4, 

Ratio is to divide the sum of anything. 

Ratio is to find the sum of anything. 

Ratio means approximately.

Commen ts on Algebra 1 in Teat 1 .- Three items on 
the list proved difficult for the Algebra 1 students* The 
first was that of the broken diagram* In grade nine many 
incorrect answers were given for this item, but in Algebra 1 
the pupils realized that they did not know the answer, so it 
was omitted. The few incorrect answers of the Algebra 1 
group were much the same as those given by grade nine. 

Ratio still proved to be a stumbling block for many 
students. The chief error was that of saying it represented 
a sum. 

Very few students attempted a definition for inverse 
variation. Since the meaning of variation was known, as 
shown by their previous answers, this omission indicated that 
they failed to understand the term w inverse”. This shows a 
weakness in language work, for they should have noted the 
likeness to the word ^invert”, which they probably knew.

Comments o n Resu lt s of > Grad es Vll and Vlll in Test 11 ,- 
Except for the first two items the Grade Vll class could do 
little with the test. They attempted most of the problems 
but allowed little knowledge of correct methods. 

The Grade Vlll class knew how to solve the first five 
problems. They did well with the last problem. It would 
seem that their comparative failure on problems 7, 8 and 9 
was due to inability to form an equation. 

No one knew how to make use of a broken axis, to 
place the units in problem 6. Most of the students used 
10 as their unit, but showed a distance from 0 to 7000 
equal to that from 7000 to 7010.

Comments on Re sults of Grade IX on Tes t 11.- The 

e 

Incorrect answers for the first problem were chiefly 90 , with 

0 

a few of 180 . Some students said there were no degrees at 
the centre of a circle. 

In problem 2 the chief error was due to confusing 
horizontal with vertical. 

Problem 3 was omitted by a fairly large number of 
students. It is quite probable that the question was too 
easy, and the students, not being able to find anything 
difficult to solve, decided that they couldn’t find the catch, 
so left the problem alone. The incorrect answer given most 
commonly was, “Use a circle graph.” 

Problems 4 and 5 were answered fairly well. An 
answer of 500 or 1000 was taken as correct in the case of 
problem 5. 

Most of the errors in problem 6 were due to taking 
the interval between 0 and 7000 equal to that between 7000 
and 7010. A very common error was that of showing a scale as 
follows; 0, 1000, 2000, etc. 

Problem 7 did not give as much trouble as I had 
anticipated. Some of the errors were; 

Both cars started from the same point. 

One car went farther than the other. 

Units were given in time and speed rather than time 
and miles. 

In problem 8, very few pupils could decide correctly 
what to do about the first 15 minutes. The majority ignored

this information; some used a curved line and others a broken 
line with varying slopes to allow for it. 

Only two students correctly solved problem 9. The 
errors were of various kinds. As shown by the table, a very 
large number omitted this problem. I classed those problems 
as omitted when a drawing was made and then crossed out. 

There were quite a few cases of this crossing out of the 
attempt. The pupil© realised that their graph was incorrect. 

The last problem, which I had expected the students 
to find rather easy, proved to be too difficult for almost 
everyone. Over half of the incorrect answers were due to 
the use of 3x+5 as the unit for one axis. That is^ the first 
number given was 3x+5, and each succeeding number was a 
multiple of this as* 6x+10, 9x-KL5 and 12x-*20 #

Comments on Algebra 1 Results in T est 11.- On 
problem 7 this class did not do as well as the Grade IX class. 
The errors were much the same as those made by Grade IX. 

The students realized that their attempts were not 
successful in problem 9 and many crossed out their results. 
Practically all of these attempts were straight line graphs. 

In some cases a student would correctly plot the points and 
then cross out the solution. Several students said, that if 
the points were correctly plotted, the graph would be a 
straight line.

Comments on Results o f G r ade X I1 Mathematics Claes es 
on Te s t 11 .- Problem 7 proved to be quite difficult for them. 
The errors previously noted for other classes were found here 
as well. Many of the students made several incorrect attempts 
before the correct solution was found. It was rather 
surprising that more of the students who turned in incorrect 
answers did not realize that the problem was incorrectly done. 

The question of what to do with the first 15 minutes 
in problem 8, proved to be quite a stumbling block. Most of 
the students who turned in incorrect answers failed to take 
account of this factor. 

In problem 9, quite a large number started a straight 
line graph and then crossed it out. As in the Algebra 1 
class, some plotted the points correctly, then crossed them 
out, apparently thinking the graph was incorrect if it were 
not a straight line.

Comments on R esults of Grades Vll and Vlll on 
Teat 111,- I tried to follow the general practice of 
starting the test with a relatively easy problem, but the 
results convinced me that I had failed quite badly* These 
pupils could not see what had taken place between the second 
and fourth hours in the first problem. 

Most of the pupils failed to give any satisfactory 
explanation for 2(b), Some acceptable answers were; 

The water began to boil* 

The heat was turned low. 

The temperature would not go higher than 100° . 

Q 

Water will not get hotter than 100 , 

Those who failed to get the correct answer in 
Problem 3 said that all points should be in a straight line. 
Several pupils divided two hundred by three, instead 
of multiplying, and so obtained an incorrect answer, I 
accepted as correct any answer between #500 and #7 00, 

In problem 6, three pupils in Grade ¥111 said there 
was no scale. In Grade Vll most of the incorrect answers 
were*. * It is not accurate*.

Comme nton Resuite of G rade IX o n Tes t 111,-As in 


Grades Vll and Vlll the pupils do not know what has happened 
between the second and third hours in problem one. live 
pupils had the following answer; 

In 1 hour he went 20 miles, 

« 2 hours " • 40 « 

« 3 « i< « 6 0 " 

m 4 on ti 100 n 
« 5 « « M 150 " 

h e « « « iao « 


I have tried to find some explanation for this answer, but 
the only one I can see is that one pupil put down these 
figures and the others copied them. Upon checking these 
papers 1 found that two of them had exactly the same error on 
problem 3 and two of them omitted this problem. The other 
problems were correct. 

Most of those who were in error on problem 2(b) said 
that the heat was taken away. They failed to observe that 
the temperature remained constant for four minutes. If you 
took the heat away the temperature would fall. Eight pupils 
gave 1.03 as the answer for 2(a). 

In problem 3 two pupils pointed out an error on my 
part. These pupils said that the parachutist would fall 
farther during the first minute since the parachute would not 
open immediately. Most of the errors were made by saying 
that the point should be on 6 not between 5 and 6.

The common error in problem 4(c) was that of 
dividing $200 by 3, thus obtaining $67 for the answer. Six 
pupils gave $6 for the amount spent for food - an error in 
placing the decimal. 

The grade nine pupils found little difficulty in 
showing why the graph in problem 6 was not a good one.

Problem 1 is still found to be very difficult* Comments made 
for the other grades seem to apply here as well. 

In problem 2(a) a fairly large number of students 
failed to read the horizontal scale correctly. The time was 
given as 2 o’clock. 

Of the errors in problem 4(c)* all but five of the 
students made the mistake of dividing by three to get their 
answer. Three students said there was no way of telling how 
much was spent for food.

Com me nts o n R esult b of Grade Xll Mathe matics Cla sses 
on Test 111.- Many of these pupils found difficulty with 
problem 1. Two of them gave the same answer as the five 
previously mentioned in the Grade IX results. Since these 
two were not in the same school as those in Grade IX, these 
similar incorrect answers were not due to copying. 

In problem 2(a) most of the errors were due to taking 
the numbers on the horizontal axis as representing hours, not 
minutes. 

In problem 3, four pupils said, M The horizontal lines 
should equal the vertical lines; therefore the last two 
points are incorrect, M 

Most of the errors in problem 4(c) were the same as 
those for the other classes - they divided by three instead 
of multiplying, Pour students placed the decimal incorrectly. 
General Co mmen ts on Results of Tests," All classes 
seem to know very little about a broken axis or a broken 
diagram. Very few could give a definition of the term; and 
on the second test, where this device could have been used, 
only a few made use of it. 

In test two, problems 7, 8 and 9 proved too difficult 
for most students, I believe these problems should not have 
been so poorly done. These results seem to prove that, while 
many can read certain graphs and make others, still, they 
fail to really understand them. 

Results of all grades on 4(c), test 3, shows us that

check the answer to see if it is reasonable. I believe that

CHAPTER 111 


PRELIMINARY TESTS IN GENERAL MATHEMATICS CLASSES. 

All of the pupils who were in General Mathematics 1 
were "C" students* The pupils who took the tests were from 
various types of schools; city, town and village. The 
tests were given early in the year before the topic "graphs” 
had been taken up. 

In the case of General Mathematics 2 students, some 
were "C" students and some were those who had failed to 
obtain a "B" standing in Algebra 1. There were a few students 
in General Mathematics 2 who had satisfactorily passed 
Algebra 1, but who did not wish to take Grade Xll Mathematics. 

The tests were the same as those listed in Chapter 11. 
The instructions and marking were the same as for the other 
classes. 

The average I.Q,. of my General Mathematics 1 pupils 
was 93. I would like to have obtained the I.Q,. ratings of all 
the General Mathematics students in other schools but I could 
not get these, so I have not recorded mine individually. My 
reason for not using the I.Q,. ratings of my own classes as a 
basis for various arguments is that the total number of 
students is too low to give reliable results. 

I think it will be readily agreed that the pupils in 
the General Mathematics classes are of fairly low intelligence 
as compared to those of other classes in the High School. 

The opinions of the teachers who teach these classes seem to 
be quite uniform in this respect. When I asked one teacher

Conmients on Results of General Mathematics 1 c l asses 
on Test 1,- Practically all the student© know what a graph 
is, and they can properly define it. Not many know what a 
pictogram is, and few of them tried to define it. 

Only 58$ of the students tested could define or 
illustrate the term "horizontal axis’*. Sixteen gave the 
definition of a vertical axis and eight said the horizontal 
axis was "lines running across the page". In three cases of 
the latter, illustrations were given of bar graphs running 
horizontally. 

As in other classes, most of the attempts to define 
a broken axis or broken diagram resulted in a definition of 
a broken line graph. 

The majority of mistakes in defining, " a round 
number" were made because students gave it the meaning of 
"approximately" and then showed that there was no effort made 
to simplify the number. As an example of this, some gave 7 
as the round number for 6. Another common answer given by 
these students is "any number divisible by 2 is a round number." 

Drawing to scale was well understood by this group. The 
most frequent example given was, "let one inch represent 1 mile." 

To illustrate the mistakes made in defining a negative 
number, I give here some of the answers* 

"A negative number is one number which cannot be 
divided by another number." 

"A negative number is the minus sign, e.g. 5-8. -8 can 
be changed to positive by adding."

*’A negative number is one in which no two numbers 
when multiplied together will divide. An example of this is 
19." 

"A negative number is the answer to a subtraction 
question." 

M A negative number is a number which can be divided 
by two, such as 6, 8, 10.” 

I conclude that this problem gives us a clue to 
General Mathematics students’ troubles. They do not under¬ 
stand the term but know, from experience, that they are 
expected to do something. They get a hint from one example 
and then apply this to every case. 

The following are some answers given as definitions 
of ’’ratio”; 

’’Ratio is part of a circle.” 

"Ratio is a short way to show how a problem is done. 
The ratio of a circle is 2 r ." 

"Ratio is one number after another - 5, 6, 7, 8*” 

"Ratio is what one thing is to another. Por example 
l; 2 equals 9; 10. « 

"Ratio is what one number is to another as in 

: I -£•” 

The students in general did not know the meaning of 
the last three terms. One student said, "A dependent variable 
is one you can depend, on to change and an independent variable 
is one that might change but probably won’t".

Comments on Re sul ts of G en eral Ma t hematics 2 Class 
on Test 1.- Ae in all other classes very few knoiv the meaning 
of a broken axis. The last three terms are not known but all 
the other terms are known quite well.* 

An interesting case was that of a student who said 
that the average was the middle term of a group of numbers, 
and who then gave the following as an example: ”7, 6, 1, 3, 

10; the average is 1." 

The pupil who incorrectly defined a negative number 
said, W A negative number is an odd number." 

Another interesting point was the fact that when the 
General Mathematics 2 students did not know the answer, it 
was omitted, as a general rule; whereas in General Mathematics 1, 
some answer was given. Examples (j ), (k), and (l), illustrate 
this quite well.

Comments on Results of General Mathematics 1 on 
Test 11.- Errors on problem 2 were chiefly due to the 
confusion of the term "horizontal axis" with the term 
"vertical axis". 

In problem 4 the incorrect answers, as well as the 
number who made each error are given below; 

20 gave 80000 

8000 

76848.000 
10000 
76000 
100000 

It is fairly evident how each incorrect answer has been 
obtained* 

Following a rule thoughtlessly is well illustrated 
in problem 5. A fairly large number of students made errors 
of this type -- "Let the page be 9 inches. Then 
1 " 

9 

Another common error was "1" s 10 . M in several cases, 
this was explained by saying that, since the paper was ruled 

in i - inch squares, 1 inch must equal 10. 

10 

As in other classes, the error most commonly made in 
problem 6, was in taking equal intervals for 0 to 7000 and 
7000 to 7010. Ten students used the following scale; 

0 , 1000 , 2000 ,. 8000 . 

Problem 7 proved to be very difficult. A great 
number of different types of error were found.

Nearly everyone neglected the initial 15 minute© in 
problem 8. Several students made a graph which showed 
SO minutes time for each pound* 

In problem 9 most of the students tried to get a 
straight line. Six students tried to construct a circle 
graph. 

The units for the two axes proved to be the big 
obstacle in problem 10. Ten students used 3x+5, 6x+l0, 
9x^15, • • • • for the vertical axis; and 1, 2, 3, 4, . . 
to represent A on the horizontal axis.

C omments on Results of G e neral Mathematics 2 Classes 
on Test 11*- On problem 4 most of the incorrect answers 
were 76000. The students in this class did much better on 
problem 5 than those in General Mathematics 1. In problem 6 
no one used a broken axis or broken diagram. The error most 
commonly made was that of giving equal intervals for 0 to 
7000 and 7000 to 7010. 

The most noticeable thing in the work on problem 8 
was, that of those who obtained the correct graph, six had 
drawn an incorrect one at first and had then crossed it out* 
I think this shows that the pupils have learned something of 
value in General Mathematics 1 or in the early part of 
General Mathematics 2 - namely, to check their results* It 
is lamentable that more students in all classes do not learn 
to do this® The only check most students use is the answer 
in the back of the text*

Comments on Results of General Mathematics 1 Claeses 
on Test 111 #- As in other classes these students do not 
understand what has taken place between the second and 
fourth hours in problem 1. 

In problem 2(a) eighteen students said the heat was 
turned on at 1 p.m., and twenty-one students said it was 
turned on at 2 p.m. In the first case they fail to observe 
that the graph descends for one minute and then for one 
minute there is no change; after this the graph begins to 
rise rapidly* The heat must have been turned on at 2 minutes 
after 1 p*m* or shortly before this* I accepted answers of 
1*01 or 1*02 p.m* 

Not many of the students could give an acceptable 
answer for 2(b). 

In answering problem 3, two students said the graph 
should go up for awhile after the parachute ©pens. 

A very interesting point is brought up by the answer© 
to problem 4. Practically every student had the answer to 
4(b) correct, yet thirty-two students said that the cost of 
food would be $66. That is, they can correctly observe the 
relative differences in size when this problem is isolated, 
but when another factor is introduced, they fail to keep 
track of this relative difference* I have noticed that where 
numbers are introduced students have a tendency to do some¬ 
thing with the numbers and then give a reason afterwards, if 
a reason is required.

industries; hut, knowing they are expected to write something, 
and not knowing the correct reason, they give this answer as 
an easy way out.

Comments on Results of General Mathematics 2 Classes 
on Test 111,- The students have learned to read graphs 
fairly well* The first problem however still causes 
difficulty. Some of the answers for problem one included 
these statements; 

"The car stopped for one hour for repairs at 2 o’clock." 

"The car slowed down between two and three o’clock." 

"The car travelled 20 miles per hour for the first hour, 
40 miles per hour for the second hour, 20 miles per hour for 
the third hour and then kept speeding up after that." 

General Mathematics 2 students are much better than 
the first year class in problem 4(c). Several of them got the 
incorrect answer #66 at first, but crossed it out and got the 
correct result* One student divided #200 by 3 and then 
changed the decimal in order to get a reasonable answer, $666. 

General comments on the results of the tests in the 
two General Mathematics Classes. *- General Mathematics 2 
students show that they understand the terms; horizontal 
axis, round numbers, negative numbers, and ratio much better 
than the General Mathematics 1 class. 

While the last three terms to be defined are not 
known any better by the second clas^ still, the students 
realize they do not know* This indicates that they have 
learned something-- ?f ’tis a wise fool who knows he is a fool." 
One would hardly expect the Mathematics 2 class to define 
these terms if they were not known before these pupils took 
Mathematics 1. In teaching General Mathematics 1, teachers

would avoid as many technical terms as possible. 

It is surprising to find that so many of the General 
Mathematics 1 students do not really understand what the 
horizontal axis is. This deficiency is well taken care of 
later, for nearly all of the General Mathematics 2 students 
know the term. 

The results of test 2 show that students in these 
classes cannot solve problems graphically. I believe that 
they should be able to solve these problems, and that it is 
our duty to find out how to give them this skill, so that 
they will succeed in work of this kind. 

General Mathematics 1 students have much difficulty 
in reading graphs. The majority of General Mathematics 2 
students can read graphs fairly well.

CHAPTER IV 


TEACHING- GRAPHS IN GENERAL MATHEMATICS 1 

After studying the results of the tests given to the 
various classes of students, I decided that the Lest approach 
to the topic of graphs was by the method of analysis. That 
is, I believe that by a study of many examples of various 
types of graphs, the student will learn the graphical language. 

While it is true that one learns by doing, one must 
not forget that this is also the way one learns to do things 
incorrectly. Though this method fails to develop the creative 
instinct, still, some psychologists put little faith in 
transfer of training. Even if transfer of training is sure 
to take place, I believe the method is still the correct one 
to follow. Since we are dealing with pupils of lower than 
average intelligence, it is wise to teach them to understand 
what others create, rather than to try to develop a talent 
for original work. 

Taking this method as a basis for my work in General 
Mathematics 1 classes, I started the course with newspaper and 
magazine pictograms. My reasons for using these are: they are 
interesting, they are the type of graph the students are most 
likely to meet outside the school room, they are easily 
obtained by the students, they well illustrate the good and 
bad features of graphs. 

We secured picture graphs of all kinds -- armaments, 
wheat production, death rates, occupations, business increase,

and many others* The pupils did not need to he told what the 
good points of these graphs were. As an illustration of one 
of the had points we took a graph which showed the relative 
standing armies of the world, previous to the war, depicted 
as soldiers in battle dress. Some of the pupils noticed the 
distortion of the true figures hut others did not. We took 
the accompanying figures and showed that the comparisons were 
made for height alone. We then cut out two figures and 
traced them on squared paper. When the squares were counted, 
the pupils could see that where one was supposed to represent 
an army three times the size of another, its area was nine 
times the size. We took several other cases to show that the 
actual difference in size on the paper, is the square of the 
ratio of the heights. 

We then took two similar shaped containers and filled 
the larger one with water. Then we filled the smaller one 
from the larger one. The pupils could see that the true 
difference where volumes were concerned is the cube of the 
ratio of the heights. (incidentally, we had to take up the 
meaning of ratio.) 

Then we went hack to the picture of the soldiers. 

The pupils easily agreed that height alone was not an 
indication of the true strength of an individual hut that the 
weight is more truly an indication. Thus the soldier who was 
three times as high as the other would tend to give the 
impression that he was twenty-seven times as strong as the 


other

Then we showed how a bar graph could be used in place 
of the figure* To avoid the error in the picture graph we 
saw that the widths should all be the same. In this way- 
height alone was the factor which we must use for comparisons. 
The bar graph alone showed the comparative sizes but, 
unless a scale was introduced, we did not know the actual 
amounts, We then took up the placing of a scale on the 
vertical axis. In this regard, we took various examples of 
good scales and practised getting answers to different 
problems, based on the scale. Then we took up the case of 
several types of bad scales, Next we took different examples 
where the scales were omitted and the pupils filled in the 
scale. These scales were considered and good and bad points 
brought out. 

Then we showed that, since height alone'was the 
deciding factor in a bar graph, the tops of the bars were all 
that was necessary. We joined these with a broken line and 
so illustrated the broken line graph. 

We took a number of broken line graphs and discussed 
what each one represented. Then the students drew broken 
line graphs based on information given them. The fact that 
each top of a bar gave us a point on the graph was brought 
out, to show that the line between the paints had no meaning 
except as an aid to the eye in going from one point to the 
next. 

At this point, the scale for the horizontal axis had

to be considered. Examples of good scales were taken. 

Faulty scales were shown and the bad points discussed. Then 
problems were given on placing of scales on the axis to 
satisfy certain given conditions. 

The same method was followed throughout the whole 
period in which graphs were taken up. Briefly it is; 1. Take 
up a great number of good examples. 2. Discuss the points 
carefully. 3. Test on reading this type of graph. 4. Point 
out errors that could easily be made. 5. Work out with the 
class certain problems involving the principle. 6. Set 
problems for the students. 7. Check the problems and dis¬ 
cover errors. 8. Discover cause of errors and give method to 
avoid this error. 9. Hew set of problems with special 
emphasis on any weak points discovered in first test. 

We then took up the following; 

1. Cartograms 

(The Alberta Wheat Pool Hail map is quite good). 

2. Circle Graphs 

3. Axes of Reference and Plotting Points 

4. Straight Line Graphs 

5. Solution of Problems by Straight Line Graphs 

Then we took up some applications of graphical 

principles as; 

The Stadia Hairs in a Transit 

Angles of Elevation and Depression 

Similar Triangle Method of Solution

Evaluation, of the material use d in teaching graphs 
in General Mathematics 1 *- I believe that the most important 
part of the whole teaching program was that of concentrating 
on the study of actual graphs* Most of the graphs studied 
were taken from newspapers, magazines and books, which were 
brought to school by the students* Since they had brought 
these from their homes, they could realize the value of 
learning to read them* That is, they could see that they 
were learning something which they could use in actual life* 

I believe that the study of these graphs is of high 
practical value. Students who have learned to read them 
will be able to glance at a graph in a newspaper and really 
understand what it represents. This ability is particularly 
valuable for the **C W class students, since they are noted 
for getting confused when they have to obtain their inform¬ 
ation from the printed page. 

This is an age of speed and there is no doubt that 
graphs represent one of the best means of giving information 
quickly* If more people could read graphs intelligently, 
more graphs would be used. 

Another value derived from the study of actual graphs 
is the training given to the pupil in detecting flagrant 
misrepresentation. Pictograms are the chief culprits in this 
regard. The correct interpretation is made when heights

alone are considered, but, to the unwary, the area is the 
basis on which conclusions are drawn. A few illustrations 
of this error will train the student to avoid this danger. 

One error 1 made in teaching graphs in this class 
should be avoided. I used too many technical terms. The 
pupils learned these terms, but X believe the time could 
have been used to better advantage in other work. It is 
much better to be able to do something correctly than to be 
able to use correctly the technical terms which may be 
applied to the problem. 

Some of the examples of graphs were too difficult 
for the students. This was unwise as it tended to confuse 
some of them. This class generally need to develop more 
self confidence, so problems should not be given which are 
too difficult for them. 

The example of the use of graphical methods to 
determine distance, as shown by the stadia hairs in a level, 
proved to be quite useful. Of course the level itself aroused 
interest and the students were anxious to use it. After they 
had learned to estimate distances with it, they were given 
an explanation of the principle involved. Then they used a 
ruler held at arm ? s length to further illustrate this device* 
They easily learned how to estimate various heights and 
distances* 

X must admit that this method required quite a lot 
of time. More time was spent on this topic than would be

allowed in other classes. I believe that the extra time spent 
is justifiable since we are dealing with pupils of lower than 
average ability in school work. We must choose between two 
evils. We must take more time than is given in other classes, 
or we must be satisfied with inferior results. I prefer the 
former. W C W grade students generally lack self-confidence 
and sure knowledge of a subject is one of the best ways to 
restore confidence. 

The pupils learned to read graphs and to use simple 
applications of them in their everyday life. This, 1 believe, 
was the chief value obtained from the course.

CHAPTER V 


PINAL TESTS TO ALL CIASSES 

After the topic "graphs" had been taken, in the manner 
just described in Chapter IV, I gave final tests to the class. 
First I gave the three tests which had been given earlier in 
the year. Then I gave a new set of test© to this class. 

I gave tests 1, 2, and 3 to various classes that had 
finished the topic "graphs** for the year in their regular 
school course. 

I gave both sets of tests to Algebra 1 classes after 
they had completed work on the topic "graphs" for the year. 

The reasons for giving all these final tests were: 

1. I wanted to secure a comparison of the two sets 
of tests. 

2. I wished to judge the progress made by various 
classes in a year 5 s work as shown by their results on the two 
sets of tests. 

3. I wanted a comparison between General Mathematics 
students who had not followed my method and my own students. 

4. I expressly wished to see if General Mathematics 
students were capable of forming the graphical concept. 

The results of the two sets of tests, which were given 
to Algebra 1 classes, show that the second set of tests is 
more difficult than the first. This is as I wished, for I 
wanted to avoid the criticism that the second set of tests 
was easier than the first.

I did not have many students in General Mathematics 
so I included in this testing program all students who had 
obtained a M C M grading. The ”C M grade students, who were not 
regular General Mathematics students, would not have better 
mathematical ability than those who were regular students. 

I am giving all the results of these final tests in

Comments on the results of final Tests 1 and IV i n 
General Mathematics 1 >- The students have learned the meaning 
of the terms fairly well. They took test one early in the 
year and then tried it again five months later. 

In test two the pupils show a very marked improve¬ 
ment* Of course, they may remember the solutions given at 
the time of the first test; in fact, the lower marks on 
test four would indicate this, nevertheless, the results 
on the final tests two and four, show that the pupils can 
draw graphs reasonably well. 

Results of tests three and six give us evidence that 
the students have learned to read graphs. Problem 5(a) in 
test six. still gives difficulty but this is a problem in 
equations rather than a problem in reading graphs.

Comments on the results of similar classes in 
General Mathematice 1 on T es te 1. 11 and 11 1, give n early in 
the year to the first class, and after graphs were studied 

in the othe r,- Some of these students were ,! C U grade students, 

while s©me were “A" and "B" students who were taking the 
commercial course. The "A" and "B" students had about fifty 
per cent more correct answers than the "C M students. 

Two definitions which proved to be quite difficult 
were those for a "round number 11 and a "negative number". Some 
answers given as definitions of a round number were: 

"Zero is a round number." 

"360 is a round number." 

"A number divisible by 2 is a round number." 

"A number divisible by 24' is a round number." 

Even more varied were the answers given for the definition of 
a negative number: 

"Negative numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7." 

"Numbers divisible by 2 are negative numbers." 

"It means subtraction; as, 451-28." 

"It is the right number." 

"It is not the right number." 

"A negative number has at 
"A negative number is 3- 

"It cannot be divided if it is negative." 

"It is the opposite number." 

"It is a number more than one."

"It iB all numbers after the decimal." 


"It is a number only divisible by itself and 1." 

"It is a number that isn f t there." 

It is plainly evident that these General Mathematics 
students do not understand the meaning of negative. This 
is shown in problem 1, Test 111, as well, for very few students 
realized that the direction of the vehicle had changed. 

Poor spelling was found in all grades, but it was 
particularly noticeable in this class. Here are a few examples 
of the ways in which "graph" was written: graff, grafp, 
grahp, graffe, graf, graft. 

In problems 7 and 8 in Test 11, several students 
correctly plotted the points and then tried to make a 
straight line fit these points and zero* Several students 
said that if the points had been plotted accurately the graph 
would have been a straight line.

Comments on the result s of the c omp arison of 
Algebra 1 c lasses before a nd after study! ng graphs.- 
Apparently the use of a broken axis (or broken diagram) is 
not stressed very much in schools* Undoubtedly this device 
has its dangers but it has its value as well. 

A considerable number of students still confuse 
ratio with radius. The students have a great deal of 
difficulty with problem 7, test 11. They generally make the 
mistake of starting both cars at the same place. In problem 9, 
test 11, most of the errors are due to the pupils* efforts to 
make a straight line graph. 

Problem 1, test 111, still proves to be too difficult 
for the majority of students in this class. The idea of the 
negative direction does not seem to be understood.

Comments on the resu i ts of the comparison of Grade IX 
c lasses i b efore and after studing graph sOn the test in 
definitions there is little improvement in the results of 
classes that have taken the topic of graphs* The results of 
test 11 show that there is a fairly good improvement in ability 
to solve problems graphically* The pupils show a better 
reading knowledge of graphs after having taken the topic in 
this grade. 

I believe that the results of these tests show that 
more attention should be given to the topic of graphs in 
this grade. Many topics covered in a short while may make 
a subject more interesting, and for the clever student may 
lead to wise stimulation of mental activity; but for the 
average student this method is not conducive to clear 
thinking.

Comments on t ine res ults of t he compari son of General 
Mathematics 2 cla s ses befor e and after studing graphs *- In 
General Mathematics 2 the topic "graphs" is given an important 
place in the year’s work, and the results of the teste show 
that there is a corresponding increase in the standard of work 
done. 

The classes were rather small in comparison with 
some of the others but I believe they are large enough to 
give us fairly reliable information* The results on all 
three tests are of a reasonably high standard* The extra 
time spent on this topic, in this class, proves that it 
pays to devote enough time to a topic to make it clear* 

I believe that most mathematics teachers will agree 
that the graph is one of the most useful devices that can 
be employed to clarify a problem* When one draws a graph, 
he not only puts his problem in a form which can be under¬ 
stood by others, but he probably clears up his own doubts at 
the same time. 

In this more or less orphan subject on our curriculum 
we find very well handled a topic which is very poorly 
treated in the other mathematics courses of the high school* 

The students in General Mathematics 2 are not likely 
to have a higher-than-average I.Q,. If the problem of graphs 
can be mastered so well in this class, it should not prove 
too difficult for other classes. 

Graphs are well bandied in this class* The

unfortunate thing is that so few students take General 
Mathematics 2. This optional course is given in only a 
few centres, for the majority of schools seem to regard the 
General Mathematics courses as not being of value sufficient 
to warrant their inclusion in a crowded curriculum. I 
think otherwise; I believe that everyone should learn some 
mathematics in high school even if the course is not a 


standard mathematics course

Commente on the comparison o f the results of the first 
set of testa with those of the last se t as given to Algebra 1 
classes*- The second set of tests proved to be more difficult 
than the first set* This indicates that graphical terms and 
problems are not well understood by this class* It is not a 
case of poor results due to an unrepresentative type of test 
but of poor results due to a distinct lack of knowledge. 

The straight line graph still proves to be a 
difficult one to read* The students fail to grasp the idea 
of the negative direction. 

The students can draw a graph of a given equation 
reasonably' well, but the fact that they cannot read a 
similar graph, proves that the problem has been solved by 
routine methods, not by intelligent reasoning.

CHAPTER VI 


CONCLUSIONS 

The results of the various tests I have made show that 
the problem of graphs has not been very well handled in the 
Alberta school system* I may be expecting too high a level 
of attainment, but I do not think so. 

Results prove that the General Mathematics Classes 
are quite capable of learning the graphical concept. They 
probably require more time and different methods of 
instruction in order to achieve results comparable with other 
classes. 

The idea of negative numbers is quite confusing to 
many students. I believe that the use of the graph is a good 
way to clear up this troublesome problem. 

The method of analysis, as employed in this school, 
in teaching General Mathematics 1, gives good results. I 
used more time on this topic than is given in most schools; 
but I believe that more time should be given to each topic 
in General Mathematics classes than to corresponding classes 
composed of "A” and M B M grade students. H C H grade students 
require more time to master a problem than do the average 
students. 

The f, C H student has been forced to try to keep up 
with others of higher intelligence, and he has been compelled 
to go on to new problems before he has mastered the basic 
principles of the old. The result is that the whole structure

is insecure since it rests on a weak foundation. 

If we take fewer topics and treat them more thoroughly, 
not simply more exhaustively, we will tend to restore the 
student’s self confidence. Having acquired more self con¬ 
fidence, he will face the world with a much "better chance of 
success. 

I believe we should endeavor to make good followers 
rather than leaders of the M C W students. Notice the adjective 
♦’good”. By this I mean intelligent followers,not blind follow¬ 
ers. The students should be trained to see clearly what the 
problem is, even if they cannot solve it. As applied to 
graphs this means that they should be able to read them 
intelligently even if they do not learn how to construct them. 

The topic of graphs is taken up in all grades from 
seven to twelve. I believe that the results of the tests 
prove that the graphical concept is not well enough under¬ 
stood even by senior high school pupils. I believe that the 
topic should be treated more fully at one point in the high 
school course, possibly* at the grade nine level.
