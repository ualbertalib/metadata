HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION - GENERAL, 


i 








HISTOR ICAL INTRODUCTION - GENERAL , 


For a considerable tine it has been known that porous 
substances like wood charcoal can take up large quantities of gas. 
Scheele, in 1777, observed that vapors brought into contact with 
charcoal at low temperatures in some way combined with it, but 
these vapors could be recovered by the application of heat. Gas 
so taken up is said to be adsorbed and the charcoal or other sub¬ 
stance is called the adsorbent. 

Although numerous observations of a si m ilar nature 
were made by other workers, the subject received little serious 
consideration until nearly 50 years later. 

The phenomenon of adsorption of gases by solids re¬ 
ceived considerable attention in connection with catalysis. 
Faraday ([ 5 ), in 1355, described experiments on the reaction of 
hydrogen and oxygen at the surface of platinum. He believed that 
molecules of the gases, being condensed on the surface, were in 
far closer proximity to one another, and so in a more favorable 
condition for the reaction to occur. 

As a result of this and similar experiments a system¬ 
atic study of the phenomena related to catalysis was begun, in 
which adsorption was considered to be of fundamental importance. 

Also related to adsorption 13 the xoroduction of electric 
lamps with filaments which will have considerable life. This

often requires that the residual gas be removed. Many researches 
on thifi problem have been undertaken, particularly by Langmuir 
for the General Electric Company. The object of those researches 
was to remove the adsorbed layers of gas from the glass walls 
and metal surfaces, also to produce a final vacuum by removing 
the last traces of gas by adsorption on suitable surfaces. 

At liquid air temperatures,the adsorption of gases by 
wood charcoal is almost complete. Dewar used this phenomenon to 
produce a very high vacua by placing charcoal, cooled to the 
temperature of liquid air, in an already partially evacuated space. 

At higher temperatures, however, a definite equilibrium 
is set up between the adsorbed substance and the gas. It is 
found that for a given mass of gas at a given temperature, the 
mass of adsorbed gas is projjortionai to the pressure. This is 
usually expressed in the form of an isotherm, a relationship be¬ 
tween pressure and amount adsorbed at constant temperature. 

The early theories of adsorption assumed that the layer 
of adsorbed gas was of considerable thickness, becoming grad¬ 
ually less dense with increasing distance from the surface. 

There were, however, serious errors possible in the measurements 
on which such theories were based. 

Most of the original experiments were carried out with 
porous materials such as charcoal. The nature of these adsorbents

made it impossible to determine the area of the effective adsorb¬ 
ing surface. In determinations where metal foils and similar 
adsorbents of known surface area were employed, layers were 
closely packed in order to obtain a sufficiently large adsorb¬ 
ing surface. As a result, enormous numbers of capillary spaces 
were formed. The saturated vapors and high pressures used then 
brought about condensation to the liquid state in these capill¬ 
aries. Another serious error consisted in the use of substances 
which actually dissolved the gas thought to be only adsorbed. 

As a result of experiments where the above difficulties 
were eliminated, Langmuir ( 5 ) proposed the theoiy that the ad¬ 
sorbed film generally is not more than one molecule in thickness. 
This theory indicated a sharp boundary between the adsorbed layer 
and the gas phase. It is supposed that when a molecule impinges 
on any solid or liquid surface, it does not rebound elastically, 
but condenses on the surface, being held by the field of force 
of the surface atoms. Some of these molecules may subsequently 
evaporate from the surface. Thus adsorption is considered to 
be a balance between evaporation and condensation processes, the 
amount of gas adsorbed depending upon the time interval between 
these processes. 

Langmuir ( 4 ) first worked with freshly cleaved mica 
surfaces, and later with drawn metal filaments. He found that 







properly drawn tungsten wires have a real surface area very close 
to the apparent surface area. This property makes such a wire 
a very desirable material as an adsorbent. 

Roberts (12) has developed a technique through which the 
nature of the adsorbed films on tungsten can be elucidated. It 
consists of determining the change in the accommodation coefficient 
during the process of adsorption. Roberts and coworkers have 
studied heats of adsorption, isotherms, rates of adsorption and 
the kinetics of formation of adsorbed gases on tungsten (14,9,16). 
Their observations indicated that there are at least two films 
of oxygen on tungsten. Referring to the paper of Morrison and 
Roberts (.9), the first film is shown to be composite and complete 
at all pressures. Most of it is stable up to a temperature of 
1700°K; the remainder of this film becomes unstable at from 900 ° 
to H00°X. This composite film is directly in contact with 
tungsten. On top of it is adsorbed another film, presumably 
molecular oxygen. 

The amount of heat evolved when a gas adsorbs on a 
solid surface, called the heat of adsorption, indicates the 
nature of the forces holding the gas particle to the solid sur¬ 
face. In the case of oxygen on tungsten, Roberts ( 14 ) found the 
heat of adsorption of the more stable part of the first film 
to be about 135,000 calories per gram molecule of oxygen, and of 




-5- 


the less stable part, about 50,000 calories. Thi3 indicates that 
the binding between oxygen and tungsten in the more stable part 
of the film is chemical in nature, that is, similar to that be¬ 
tween two atoms in a stable molecule. Also, the forces holding 
the less stable part to tungsten are considerable. 

It is the purpose of this thesis to present measurements 
of the heat of adsorption of the second, molecular oxygen film. 
This film is not directly attached to tungsten, but rather to 
oxygen already adsorbed on tungsten.

INTRODUCTION TO HEAT OF ADSORPTION MEASUREMENTS.

INTRODUCTION TO HEAT OF ADSORPTION MEASUREMENTS. 

Suppose a gas is admitted to an adsorbent in success¬ 
ive small quantities, so that the amount adsorbed increases by 
Ai, A 2 , A 3 .... ; the corresponding quantities of heat evolved 
will be Q 2 .... . The integral heat of adsorption for a 

concentration A is the limiting value of Q when the increments 
are indefinitely small. The differential heat of adsorption is 
the limiting value of dCj/dA when dA is indefinitely small. 

Measurements of heats of adsorption by the method inp 
dicated above are usually termed direct measurements. A known 
quantity of gas is admitted to the adsorbent contained in a cal¬ 
orimeter, and the heat produced is measured by the temperature 
rise. 

Kruyt and Modderman (2) have reviewed all available 
data on heats of adsorption prior to 1930. Charcoal and silica 
gel form the adsorbent in most of the determinations and the 
measurements are direct, the adsorbent being contained in the 
calorimeter. It is, however, possible to use the adsorbent 
itself as a calorimeter. 

Roberts (14) determined the heat of adsorption of 
hydrogen on tungsten, also the first layer of oxygen on tungsten. 
In these measurements, a tungsten filament was used both as a

calorimeter and adsorbent. Variations in the heat of adsorption 
of oxygen on a tungsten surface partially covered with hydrogen 
were also determined. 

In determinations where the heat of adsorption is 
small,for instance inert gases on solids, it becomes necessary 
to find some means, other than the calorimetric one, for measur¬ 
ing the heat produced. Such methods are usually termed indirect, 
as the heat of adsorption is calculated from the pressure and 
amount adsorbed using the well known Clausius Clapeyron equation. 
This equation is applicable to systems in equilibrium; in this 
case it gives a relation between the equilibrium pressure, 
temperature and heat of adsorption for a definite surface covered 
or constant amount adsorbed.

Orr (10) used this method to determine heats of 
adsorption of inert gases on salt crystals. Even at the low 
temperatures at which he worked, the adsorption as well as the 









- 8 - 


heat of adsorption is small.. Isotherms are determined at sev¬ 
eral different temperatures and the heat of adsorption is cal¬ 
culated from these, using the Clausius Clapeyron equation. 

In the present investigation the heat of adsorption 
of the upper layer of oxygen on tungsten Is determined by means 
of the latter method. Isotherms are determined at two different 
temperatures, approximately 25°C and 100°C. 

The 25°C isotherm has already been determined in 
connection with Morrison and Roberts ( 9 ) work on the general 
features of the oxygen film on tungsten. In order to determine 
the isotherm at 100°C certain changes in the apparatus were 
mecessary. These changes, along with the consideration that the 
tungsten filament has not necessarily the same surface area, 
make it desirable to redetermine at the same time the 25°C

THE ACCOMODATION COEFFICIENT METHOD OF MEASURING ADSORPTION 









- 9 - 


THE ACCOMODATION COEFFICIENT METHOD OF MEASURING ADSORPTION . 

The determination of any well defined isotherm re¬ 
quired that the pressure of the gas, the temperature, the area 
of the solid surface and the amount of surface covered by the 
adsorbed gas be known. The first three factors are relatively 
easily determined but the extent of surface covered is often 
quite obscure. 

In this work, the accomodation coefficient technique 
originally developed by Roberts (]£) is used. The accommodation 
coefficient is a measure of the efficiency of interchange of 
heat between a metal surface and an impinging gas molecule. 
Knudsea (3) defines it in the following manner. 


Ti 



T 


-Q. 



figure 1 











- 10 - 


Consider a metal surface at a temperature T x and a 
gas molecule at a temperature T 6 (Fig. I). This molecule strikes 
the surface and rebounds at a temperature 1 • Then the accomod¬ 
ation coefficient ‘a* is equal to ~ - ° the ratio between the 

Ti - To 

two temperature differences. If the temperature T 2 of the re¬ 
bounding molecule is equal to H , the temperature of the solid 
surface, the accommodation coefficient is equal to 1. As T 2 
approaches % , the temperature of the impinging molecule, the 
accommodation coefficient approaches aero. 

Roberts (L2) found the accommodation coefficient of an 
inert gas on a freshly cleaned tungsten surface to be consider¬ 
ably lower than previously had been indicated. In addition he 
found that it decreased with decreasing temperature, approach¬ 
ing aero at CPK (13). At a constant temperature the value also 
was noticed to increase with time, but after heating to a high 
temperature, always returned to the same value. This suggested 
that the accommodation coefficient was very sensitive to the 
presence of an adsorbed film. The gases, neon and helium, used 
in his determinations are chemically inert and they do not 
adsorb on tungsten at ordinary temperatures. The increase in 
the accommodation coefficient with time must therefore be due 
to the presence of other adsorbed gases on the tungsten surface. 







- 11 - 


Roberts (14) used this fact to study the adsorption 
of known gases on tungsten filaments, the basic assumption be¬ 
ing that the change in accommodation coefficient is proportional 
to the amount of gas adsorbed. 

The accommodation coefficient is measured by using 
tungsten in the form of a fine wire, which is set up in an 
evacuated glass system and is made one arm of a wheatstone bridge 
arrangement. The wire is heated to a temperature T x by means of 
a small current, the gas being at a temperature T 0 • 

The energy from this small current is dissipated in 
three ways. It raises the temperature of the wire above that of 
surroundings. At this temperature some of the energy is lost by 
radiation, some through the leads, and the remainder is lost 
to the gas by conduction. 

Knudsen ( 3) relates the heat loss qg to the gas, with 
the accommodation coefficient in the following manner. 


-4 




1.74 X 10 P 

4TEF 


Where M is the molecular weight of the monatomic gas, neon in 
this case, P is the pressure of the neon in dyne cm; 2 and T 
is the absolute temperature of the gas. 

The radiation and end loss is constant for any one 
temperature and temperature excess of the wire, so can be 


determined by an experiment in vacuo. The sum of the radiat- 












ion and end losses and the heat loss to the gas gives the total 
heat loss of the wire. This total heat loss is related to the 


temperature excess of the wire as previously mentioned, so that 
if one is known the other may be determined. 

The relation between t, the temperature excess of the 
wire and X, the temperature coefficient of resistance is 
Ti - T 0 = t = £ >■ 

X r o 

where r x is the resistance of the wire at the temperature excess 
t and ij, is the resistance of the wire at the temperature of 


the gas. 

For each resistance r 19 a value of the accommodation 
coefficient can be deduced. In an experiment, the change in 
resistance, and thus, the change in the accommodation coefficient 
with time is measured. 

Figure 5 shows the initial drift of the accommodation 
coefficient with time for a clean wire at both 25°C and ICKfC. 

The accommodation coefficient is always found to increase slowly 
with time, due to the presence of adsorbable gases in the system. 
The initial value at 100° C is found to be somewhat higher than 
that at Zf? C, which is in agreement with results of previous 
investigations (13). The arrow indicates the time at which the 
gas to be adsorbed on the tungsten filament is admitted to the 
system.

In the present investigation, oxygen is admitted to a 
clean tungsten wire. The pressures required are of the order of 
from 10~ 6 to lGT 8 m.ra. Hg. To obtain and measure these extremely 
small pressures a new method, devised by Morrison and Roberts ( 9 ), 
is employed. By means of this method a supply of oxygen, at 
practically constant pressure, is available to the wire for periods 
of at least two hours. 





COHTBQL OF THE QXTGEN PRESSURE, 






- 14 — 


CONTROL OF THE QXYGEH PRESSURE, 

It is essential that the pressure at the wire remain 
constant throughout & determination. As the adsorption of gas by 
the wire causes a decrease in pressure, a method employing a con¬ 
stant flow of gas past the wire forms the most satisfactory means 
of obtaining constant pressure. 

The oxygen system (Fig. Z) consists of a large reser¬ 
voir B connected to the main part of the apparatus by a capillary 
tube K. C, C M are charcoal traps which can be immersed in 
liquid air. W is the tungsten wire on which the adsorption takes 
place. 

The pressure of oxygen at the surface of charcoal at 
liquid air temperatures is very nearly zero (Page 6, (9)). Oxygen 
diffuses from the reservoir B through the capillary tube to D, 
where it divides into two streams a and b flowing towards each of 
the charcoal traps where the oxygen is removed. The wire W is 
placed in the path of one of these streams of oxygen. 

The design of the apparatus is such that the resistance 
to the flow of gas through the capillary tube is due mainly to 
collisions with the walls of the tube, collisions with neon 
molecules being only a correcting term. Conversely, the resist¬ 
ance to the flow of gas from D to the charcoal surface through

a and b is primarily due to collisions with neon molecules, a 
correction being applied for wall collisions. 

It is known that the flow of gas through a tube is proport¬ 
ional to <sP/K where &P is the total pressure drop and R is the 
sum of the resistances to that flow. At equilibrium the flow 
through the capillary tube equals the flow through from D to the 
charcoal traps. Then

D to the charcoal surfaces, ^c is the sum of the resistances 
to flow through the capillary and a, A b the sums of the resist¬ 
ances to flow in the respective tubes a and b. 

Since all the molecules ?<hich strike the charcoal sur¬ 
face are not immediately adsorbed, the pressure at the charcoal 
surface is somewhat greater than zero. This effect can be re¬ 
presented as an additional resistance to the flow of oxygen, 
and appears as a correcting term in the denominator. 

Corrections are also made for parts of the traps be¬ 
ing at the temperature of liquid air, altering the effective 
length of the tubes.

can be calculated, knowing the dimensions of the tubes. Since in 
the pressure range used ^ r d is only 1/1000 the magnitude of & t, 
it can be neglected in comparison. ^ p t is then the pressure in 
the calibrated reservoir B. 

In terms of° d, the pressure P at the wire is

where R^ c is the resistance to the flow of gas on the side b, 
from D to the charcoal surface where the pressure is zero. R wc 
is the resistance to the flow of gas from the wire to the charcoal 
surface where the pressure is zero. 

The ratio R /^ p t is calculated for several definite 
neon pressures over the range used. This relation is represented 
in figure 3, and is specific for each apparatus used. From this, 
and knowing the oxygen pressure in the bulb B, the oxygen press¬ 
ure at the wire is obtained for any known neon pressure. 





APPARATUS AND EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE, 









- 19 - 


APPARATUS AND EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE. 

The apparatus and method is essentially the same as 
that employed by Morrison and Roberts (9). Some alterations in 
dimensions were necessary in order to do experiments at 100°Cl» 
The length of wire used is 15.72 cm, as compared with 3,67 cm. 
end radius 5.19 X 1C” 3 cm. as compared with 5.55 X 10” 4 cm. This 
altered wire cell is shown in figure 4. 

Before each experiment the charcoal and glass surfaces 
are thoroughly degassed by heating to approximately 500°C. The 
essential parts of the apparatus (Fig. 2) are then protected 
from mercury vapor and tap grease by liquid air traps beyond C* 
and C 11 , between K and B, as well as between D and the McLeod 
gauge. As soon as the best possible vacuum has been attained, 
the apparatus is shut off from the mercury diffusion and Hyvac 
pumps by means of mercury cut-offs. The charcoal traps C, C 1 
and C 11 are then immersed in liquid air, removing practically 
all the remaining gas by adsorption. 

A measured sample of neon is purified by allowing it 
to remain in contact with charcoal at the temperature of liquid 
air. This is then admitted to the main system where it is con¬ 
tinuously circulated through the charcoal traps C 1 and C f| for 
half an hour. This removes traces of adsorbable impurities

The wire cell

which might still be present on the glass surfaces* During this 
process of circulation a tube of larger dimensions is used to 
by-pass the capillary tube in order to hasten attainment of equil¬ 
ibrium throughout the system* Upon completion of the circulation, 
the by-pass is cut-off, leaving the capillary tube as the only 
connection between B and the wire cell. 

The wire cell is completely immersed in a thermostated 
oil bath. In this bath, a special oil is used which has high 
insulating properties. The temperature of the bath is deter¬ 
mined by means of a standardised thermometer, determinations 

o o 

being made at 24.8 C and 100.5 C. 

The wire W forms one arm of a Wheatstone bridge which 
is arranged so that the other three arms may be shorted with 
suitable switches. By means of such an arrangement, a current 

o 

sufficient to heat the filament to 2200 C can be passed through. 

The filament is flashed at this temperature for two 
one minute periods. Between these flashings, the wire is allow¬ 
ed to cool for one minute. This gives sufficient time to en¬ 
able the circulating neon to clean up impurities released from 
the wire by the flashing process. 

o 

In determinations at 100 C the neon is not kept cir¬ 
culating during the course of an experiment. Instead, the wire 
is flashed after the neon has circulated 20 minutes. The neon

is circulated for a further 10 minutes, allowing sufficient time 
for the adsorbable gas to be removed before it is stopped cir¬ 
culating. When the neon has come completely to rest, the wire 

o 

is again raised to 2200 C for one minute. Then a smell current 
(25 milliamperes), sufficient to raise its temperature 20 in 
excess of the oil bath, is passed through the wire. 

As the neon is left circulating during each experiment 

o 

at 24.8 C, the wire is flashed for two one minute periods after 
the neon has circulated for half an hour* The current is then 
reduced to the small value and the wire connected to the bridge. 
The change in resistance of the wire with time can be followed on 
the galvanometer scale. 

The deflection of the galvanometer with time is re¬ 
corded every 15 seconds, the value of the heating current being 
kept steady. If there is only a slight amount of adsorbable gas 
present, the initial drift of the galvanometer is very small. 

This drift is followed for a few minutes, sufficient readings 
being taken to insure an accurate extrapolation to zero time 
(Fig. 5). 

At a definite time the oxygen, obtained by heating 
KMnCU* is released from a gas pipette into the two and one half 
litre reservoir B. Galvanometer readings are continued every 
fifteen seconds. As the adsorption approaches the equilibrium

state readings are taken less frequently, the final value being 
recorded 120 minutes after admission of the oxygen. 

Neon pressures are measured with the McLeod gauge 
immediately before admission of oxygen as well as at the end of 
an experiment. 

Galvanometer sensitivity and zero resistance r o is 
determined for each experiment. The latter is accomplished by 
measuring the resistance at 5 milliamperes and 25 miiliamperes 
then extrapolating to zero current• 

The temperature coefficient of resistance of the wire 
is determined for both of the bath temperatures used. This is 
accomplished by determining the zero resistance above and below 
each of the bath temperatures normally used. From these values 
the change of zero resistance with temperature can be plotted 
andX* the temperature coefficient calculated from the slope. 

Similarly radiation and end losses of the wire are 
determined for each bath temperature. To do this, the heat 
losses are measured with no gas present. This is done at three 
different temperature excesses so that the radiation and end 
loss for any temperature excess of the wire may be calculated.

EXPERIMENTAL results. 

The average values of the accommodation coefficient for 
the clean tungsten wire at the beginning of an experiment are 
0.043 at 24.8°C and 0.048 at 100°G. A sharp rise in the value 
occurs upon admission of oxygen to the system, the rate of in¬ 
crease varying in the same direction as the oxygen pressure. The 
initial parts of two experiments are shovn in figure 5, oxygen pre¬ 
ssures being 2.83 X 10 ~® dyne cm.-3 for the 100°C experiment and 
5.17 X 10 -® dynes for the 25°C experiment. 

In each determination the accommodation coefficient 
reaches a fairly steady value about 120 minutes after admission 
of oxygen. Typical examples of this are sho?zn in figure 6. Curve 
II is the accomodation coefficient-time relationship at 25 U C, 
for an oxygen pressure of 3.17 X 10~s dyne cm.* 2 . Curves I and III 

o 

show final values at 100 C for which the oxygen pressures are 
5.88 X 10'® and 1.3 X 10'® dyne cm. - * respectively. 

The obvious dip incurve I is a phenomenon common to 

O 

all 100 C experiments at lower oxygen pressures. The value of 
the accommodation coefficient at the minimum, if it occurs, is 
consistently 0.183 irrespective of the pressure. The length of 
time that the accommodation coefficient remains at this minimum 
value, before starting to rise again, varies inversely with the 















- 25 - 


oxygen pressure. Also, the time taken to reach the minimum in¬ 
creases with decreasing pressure. The height to which the curve 
rises before dropping back to the value of 0.183 is dependent 
on the oxygen pressure, maximum effect being obtained at approx¬ 
imately 1 X 10 ' 4 dyne cm.' 8 oxygen. At higher pressures the 
effect is reduced to a sharp levelling off, with a definite 
change in slope as the value rises again. At still higher pre¬ 
ssures the effect is masked by rapid adsorption of oxygen by 
the wire and a resulting rapid rise in the value of the acc¬ 
ommodation coefficient. At lower pressures than IX 10 " 4 dynes 
the effect is minimized by a slow change in the value of the 
accommodation coefficient with time. This is represented in 
curve III which has an oxygen pressure of 1.3 X 10dynes. 

At this low pressure a value of 0.103 is only reached 120 min¬ 
utes after admission of oxygen. Indications are that it would 
take several hours for an equilibrium value to be reached. 

A suggestion of a similar phenomenon at 25 °C is shown 
over a restricted pressure range. This takes the form of a 
quick change of slope in the accommodation coefficient-time 
curve, as shown in curve II figure 6. 

In a normal experiment the value of the accommodation 
coefficient does not change greatly beyond 120 minutes after 








- 26 - 


the wire has been cleaned. Final values a^, at 120 minutes, are 
determined for several oxygen pressures both at 24.3°C and 100.5°C. 
These are given in Tables I and II. 

The flow of gas through the capillary cannot be accur¬ 
ately calculated when the mean free path of the gas becomes less 
than the diameter of the capillary tube. This is true for 
pressures above 1.5 X 10~ 8 dyne cm! 2 ; so that the last two re¬ 
sults shown in Tables I and II give only an approximate measure 
of the pressures. The method of dosing oxygen, however, insures 
that these are about 5 times and 10 times the pressure of the 
last accurate result (Page 9(9)). 

Some of the values are plotted against the oxygen 
pressure in dyne cm.‘ 2 . The pressure spread as seen in Table I, 
makes it impossible to plot all the values of a f 1 s in one dia¬ 
gram. For comparison the isotherm determined by Morrison and 
Roberts (9) at 25 °C is included as curve III in figure 7. 

The best extrapolations for the 24.8°C isotherm are 
= 0.1845 at zero pressure and a^ = 0.530 at maximum pressure. 

o 

Corresponding values for the 100.5 C isotherm are a^ = 0.2008 
and = 0.560. 

Letting Q be the fraction of available sites covered 
and assuming that 0 changes linearly with change in the accommo¬ 
dation coefficient, these values then correspond to 0 = 0, 
no upper film, and 0=1, the complete upper film respectively.

low the 24.3°C curve, the two approaching each other at a value

one diagram the pressure range was compressed on a logarithmic 
scale. In figure 9, 6 is plotted against log P for both tem¬

values of 0 obtained by Morrison and Roberts (9) are plotted 
as points for comparison. 

Dimensional considerations of the tungsten lattice 
and oxygen molecule area previously indicated that there is 
only sufficient space for half the available sites to be covered 
with oxygen molecules (fig. 10). Such a molecular layer would 
then be completed at Q * 0.5 (page 10, fig. 4 (9) ). To plot 
these values on the same chart one scale is superimposed on the

Figures 8 and 9 are actually forms of adsorption iso¬ 
therms. From these isotherms, corresponding pressures are taken 
for constant values of B and substituted in the Clausius Clapeyron 
equation (page 7). 

In the following calculation, the heat of adsorption 
is given at 0 = 0.2 the pressures are 9.3 x 10*® and 
2.43 x 10* 4 dyne cm. * for 24.8°C and 100. i? C respectively. As 
the temperature of the wire is above that of the bath, an average 
value for the temperature excess of the wire is added to the bath 
temperature of each isotherm.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS 



























-37- 


DISCUSSIQN OF RESULTS. 

The values of the accommodation coefficient for the 
clean wire are of the correct order of magnitude. The value 
a = 0.043 at 24.8° C compares with 0.057 for the wire used by 
Morrison and Roberts (9). A different roughness factor would 
account for the observed difference which is always found when 
different wires are used (14)• The higher value a = 0.048 

o 

obtained at 100 C for the same wire confirms the observation of 
Roberts (13) and Van Cleave (16)• 

The final values reached by the accommodation coeffic¬ 
ient in 120 minutes are given in Tables I and II and are plotted 
in figure 7. As has been shown in the work of Morrison and 
Roberts (9) the first film on tungsten is composite and probably 
is made up of oxygen atoms directly over tungsten sites, with a 
percentage of sites occupied by oxygen molecules. The irrevers- 
ability of the adsorption of this first and composite film is 
shown by its high heat of adsorption (14) and the fact that it 
forms at any pressure of oxygen. The amount of oxygen in the 
film above this composite, initial film depends on the pressure, 
and the value for the accommodation coefficient obtained by 
extrapolation to zero pressure will give a bare upper film 
(in other words a film with 0=0). This has been done at both 










-38- 


temperatures in figure 7. It will be seen that the 100°C extra¬ 
polation is farther than that at 25°C. This was necessitated by 
the fact that an experiment at 100°C and pressure of 1.5 x 10 5 
dyne cm. -■ (curve III fig. 6) did not go beyond a = 0.183 in 120 
minutes. This is quite consistent with other observations at 
100°C, which will be discussed later, but nullifies this deter¬ 
mination in so far as the final isotherm is concerned. 

At the highest pressures a^ seems to be coming to a 
steady value, at which 0 = 1, the complete upper film. Follow¬ 
ing Morrison and Roberts (9), extrapolations are made to what 
appear to be the final values attainable. This requires carry¬ 
ing out determinations whose pressures are not knoyfli accurately, 
but are of the order of 5 and 10 times the highest pressure 
accurately measurable. 

The relative positions of the a f * s for the 2 £ C and 

O 

100 C indicate that at the highest pressures the film is approx- 

o o 

imately of the same population at 100 C as at 25 C. For instance, 
if the ratios of the accommodation coefficient at 2J? C to those at 
100°C for the clean wire, for the wire without upper oxygen film 
and for the complete upper film respectively, are compared. 


similar results are obtained, 





































-59- 


0.043/0.048 * 0.900, 

0.1845/0.2008* 0.322, 

0.550/0.560 = 0.317, 

Thus the extrapolated values a^* 0.530, 0.560 become equal to 

0 * 1 . 

0 is calculated for each intermediate a^, assuming a 
linear relation between 0 and the change in a^. The initial 
values of 0 are not very sensitive to the final value of a f 
chosen as the extrapolation, but are very sensitive to the init¬ 
ial extrapolation. The importance of this extrapolation is em¬ 
phasized when 6 is plotted against the log of the pressure as in 
figure 9. The crosses shown are the values obtained by Morrison 
and Roberts. If one examines the initial a^* s obtained by 
Morrison and Roberts (curve III, fig. 7), it will be seen that 
they vary linearly with pressure. The present results do not 
confirm this, and as these give a self consistent log P - 0 
curve, as well as being carried out with lower oxygen pressures, 
it is considered that they are more reliable. Moreover, the 
Morrison and Roberts values give inconsistent variability in the 
log P - 9 curve. A somewhat different initial a f , for 0=0, 
would straighten out the initial part of their results.

values obtained for the heat of adsorption, it is convenient to 
introduce and discuss recent theoretical and experimental material 
concerning nature of forces between adsorbed particles and ad¬ 
sorbing surfaces. 

Several theoretical papers have been published in rec¬ 
ent years, which attempt to account for adsorption forces. 
Lennard-Jones (8) draws attention to the variation of adsorption 
with temperature. For instance in the case of hydrogen, with 
certain metals there is considerable adsorption at very low 
temperatures, diminishing to a minimum between -18<f C and 0°C, 
and increasing again to a maximum, followed by another minimum, 
and at very high temperatures a third maximum. Here, there 
appears to be at least three different kinds of adsorption. The 
first type, at very low temperatures, is usually called van der 
Waals adsorption> being due to van der Waals forces; the second 
type is called w chemisorption” or "activated” adsorption, re¬ 
quiring a certain temperature to permit its occurrence. 

Further, Lennard-Jones (7) shows that the cohesive 
forces between atoms and molecules also fall into definite cat¬ 
egories. All rare gases are monatomic and difficult to liquefy. 
Hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen are diatomic stable molecules at 
room temperatures; oxygen for instance requires 117,000 
cal./gm. molecule to dissociate into atoms. The forces holding

together the atoms in these homopolar molecules are very large* 
let these molecules are like the monatomic inert gases in re¬ 
sisting liquefaction. However they do eventually cluster to 
form liquids, the heat of evaporation for oxygen being 1,650 
cal./gm. molecule at its boiling point, end for argon 1500 cal¬ 
ories. The attractive forces between argon atoms in liquid argon 
and oxygen molecules in liquid oxygen axe similar in magnitude 
as both are electrically symmetrical particles. 

The next step is the assumption that forces operating 
between like atoms are similar to those operating between diff¬ 
erent atoms. That is, there should be categories of adsorption 
heats paralleling cohesional energies between like atoms. This 
is bom out by experience. Heats of adsorption of the order of 
50,000 to 150,000 cal./gm. molecule are observed, and on the 
other hand heats as low as 500 to 5,000 cal./gm. molecule are 
observed. The latter occur in low temperature adsorption. Pre¬ 
sumably the higher heats are associated with chemisorption and the 
lower ones with forces related to van der Waals attractions. 

Lennard-Jones (l) has examined the second virial coe¬ 
fficient in the equations of state of various gases in order to 
determine the energy constants for these gases and from this 
the van der Waals energy. The van der Waals energy is of the 
form - - (where r is the distance between the particles), end

arises from mutual induced polarisation of the inert gas atonis or 
homopolar molecules. To complete the picture of the approach of 
two particles to each other, repulsive forces are considered, and 

are of the order of - . The net potential energy at a distance

Such treatment gives good agreement with observed properties 
such as heats of sublimation and interatomic distances in the 
crystal. Moreover, the depth of the potential trough parallels 
the boiling points of the liquids, the more diffictalttyliquif- 
iable having shallower troughs. In this way the nature of van 
der Waals forces has been quite clearly elucidated. 

Applying the ideas of Lennard-Jones to low temperature 
adsorption Orr (11) calculated theoretically the adsorption be¬ 
havior of argon on alkali halide crystals. This is an ideal 
system since there will be no tendency to chemical combination, 
and any cohesion between the inert gas and solid surface will 
be fairly simple in nature. He includes three terms in the 
energy of adsorption (l) the van der Waals potential (2) the 
electrostatic potential (5) the repulsive potential, in each 
case between the adsorbed atom and the crystal surface. A fur¬ 
ther consideration enters as the film is being built up to 0= 1, 
namely the interaction between the induced dipoles (argon atoms 
held by van der Waals attraction) - which interaction may be 
positive or negative. 

In a later paper (10) on the adsorption of non polar 
gases on alkali halide ciystals, he determined the heats of 
adsorption from very low temperature isotherms. He found 





-44- 

coinplete confirmation for his theoretical treatment. In the case 
of the adsorption of oxygen on KC1, up to 0 a 1 the heat of adsor¬ 
ption was from 1,700 to 2,200 cals./gm. molecule, and it fell 
asymptotically above 0 s * 2 (2 molecular layers of oxygen) towards 
the heat of vaporization of oxygen (1,750 cal./gm. molecule at 
the temperature of measurement) • This means that the interactions 
between oxygen and the surface becomes negligable beyond 5 or 
more molecular diameters, and the adsorption becomes a form of 
lie uef ac tion. 

In the present ?/ork, the average magnitude of the heat 
of adsorption for oxygen on top of the first film is about 550 
cal./gm. molecule. This clearly points to van der Waals adsorp¬ 
tion. No comparison can be made to theoretical values because the 
force constants for oxygen are not worked out. However, some 
speculation is possible. 

Resistance to adsorption can arise from lateral re¬ 
pulsions of the induced dipoles (6) and the temperature or 

O O 

kinetic energy of the gas molecule• Above 500 to 400 K the 
upper f ilm begins to become unstable (14) and between that and 
1100°K there is a temperature above which, no matter what the 
pressure of oxygen, the upper film cannot exist even in part. 

This may be ceiled the critical temperature of the film, to com¬ 
pare it to the critical temperature of a liquid, above which the

thermal energy resists any cohesion irrespective of the magnitude 
of the pressure. 

The critical temperature of oxygen is - 118.8°C. Above 
this temperature the heat of vaporization is zero, and the kinetic 
energy is greater than the cohesive energy. Orr (10) carried 
out experiments at a much lower temperature than this so the 
the rm al or kinetic energy is negligible in comparison to the coh¬ 
esive. At this low temperature adsorption is favored rather than 
reduced by the temperature. 

The present isotherms are for oxygen molecules on top of 
oxygen atoms which in turn are on top of tungsten. At the temper¬ 
ature at which the present experiments are carried out, the 
lateral interaction forces, if existent, would be positive. The 
thermal energy itself would oppose the van der Vfaals attraction 
to the underlying oxygen atoms and consequently only small heats 
of adsorption may be expected. 

The variation in the heat of adsorption observed up to 
6 ~ 0.15 is not significant because it depends too much on the 
extrapolation of the lOCf C isotherm to zero pressure, which extra¬ 
polation is fairly large. Beyond 0 = 0.15 the heat of adsorption 
is about 550 calories, and it begins to decrease significantly 
beyond 0 = 0.52 until it is less than half at 0 = 0.5. Beyond

0 = 0.5, it is not easily determined but is never greater than 
200 cal./gm. molecule. Actually, if one examines the log P -0 
curve (fig. 9) which give the complete isotherm in one diagram, 
it is seen that the character of the isotherm changes at about 
0“ 0.5. This is very interesting and lias a possible explanation. 

It is confirmed by the 25°C isotherm obtained by 
Morrison and Roberts (shown by crosses in figure 9). Orr (10) 
finds a similar change over in adsorption of non polar gases on 
alkali halides. A minimum occurs in the heat of adsorption at 
0 s 0.5 and this is confirmed by theoretical considerations. 

From 0 = 0 to 0 = 0.5, the gas molecules adsorb in the centres 
of the lattice cells, but as 0 tends to unity, the arrangement 
passes over to a close packed hexagonal pattern. 

It is possible that in the present case, oxygen 
adsorbs superimposed on tungsten atoms or in the centre of a 
set of 4 tungsten atoms (the same coverage would result in either 
case, the case chosen being one of minimum potential energy). 

But obviously (fig. 1^) this is not the closest packing possible, 
and so after such a film has built up with an ordered square 
arrangement (assuming the 100 tungsten plane underlying) it would 
gradually change over to some close packed arrangement. Such a 
phenomenon could change the character of the isotherm and also 
the heat of adsorption. It will be noted that this interpretation

makes the complete film 0 ** 1, not 0“ 0.5 as suggested by 
Morrison and Roberts (9)• 

Wang (17) calculated theoretical isotherms for the 
adsorption of molecules without dissociation on surfaces, with 
positive interactions (repulsion) between the adsorbed particles. 
That such repulsion can arise from the depolarizing effect of 
parallel dipoles on each other, is pointed out by Langmuir (6). 

Wang showed that such interaction affects the isotherm so that a 
relatively large increase in pressure is required to reach 0 = 0.5. 
In the present investigation it is found that a hundredfold in¬ 
crease in the pressure is required to change 0 from 0.05 to 0.5, 
another hundredfold increase completing the film. With a neg¬ 
ative or no interaction the isotherm would pass 6 - 0.5 with an 
increase of a few times the pressure which gives 0= 0.05. 

In summary, the heat of adsorption of oxygen in the upper 
oxygen film as measured from the isotherms determined at C and 
100 °C indicate that molecular oxygen is adsorbed on top of the 
tightly held oxygen film on tungsten by means of van der Waals 
attractions together with lateral repulsions which become effect¬ 
ive after the film is about one third complete.

SUMMARY. 

Using the method of Morrison and Roberts, the change 
in the accommodation coefficient of neon on a tungsten surface, 
at both 24*8° C and 100.5 °C, has been measured as affected by 
the adsorption of oxygen, over a pressure range of 1 x 10 -• to 
10 dyne cm.’ 8 . 

From the final values obtained for every pressure de¬ 
termined, Pressure - &f curves were plotted and extrapolated to 
zero and maximum pressure. 

Using these extrapolations, 0 the fraction of surface 
covered has been calculated for each pressure and plotted as 
isotherms. 

The heat of adsorption has been calculated from the 
two isotherms at various values of 0 using the Clausius Clapeyron 
equation. 

The nature of the forces holding this second film to 
the atomic film as well as the variation in the heat of adsorp¬ 
tion with©, the fraction of surface covered, has been discussed 
and compared to the work of Orr (10) on alkali halide crystals.

Removal of the Second Film. 

o 

At 100.5 C, the extrapolation of the a^* s to zero 
pressure gives a value of 0.2008 for the accommodation coeffic¬ 
ient* The value of 0.183 at which the minimum occurs in the 
lOCf C adsorption curves indicates a surface not completely cov¬ 
ered by the first film. In order to fix the position of the 

o 

minimum in the 100 C experiments, the accommodation coefficient 
is determined for a surface from which all molecular oxygen is 
removed. 

To do this, the wire is heated to a temperature of 

o 

approximately HOG K for one minute in the presence of small 
oxygen pressure. The temperature of the wire is determined by 
measuring its resistance and calculating from the resistivity. 
The wire is allowed to cool and readings are taken for several 
minutes. Extrapolation to zero time (at which heating was 
stopped) gives the value of the accommodation coefficient at 
cessation of the heating. This value is determined for several 
temperatures from l}.0Q o to 1800 °K, data for which are given in 
Table IV.

oxygen, a minimum value of the accommodation coefficient occurr- 
o 

ing at 1500 K. Above this temperature the value rises, a max¬ 
imum being apparent at 170u°K. At higher temperatures atomic 
oxygen is removed from the tungsten surface. 

Below 154CPK there is a gradual drift in the value of 
the accommodation coefficient with time, due to the presence of 
oxygen in the system. At higher temperatures there is no drift

in the accommodation coefficient up to at least 8 minutes after 
heating. The increase in accommodation coefficient at these 
higher temperatures together with the disappearance of drift 
indicates a rearrangement of the film so that the surface be¬ 
comes completely covered with atomic oxygen (16). 

It is interesting to note that at 100°C, the maximum 
value of the accommodation coefficient obtained at 1700°K is the 
same as the value at the minimum (0.183) in an ordinary experiment. 

In order to investigate the problem of this minimum, 
a tungsten wire with a surface area smaller than the one used in 
the present determination is required. This is necessary so that 
the percentage of oxygen adsorbed by the wire in the initial part 
of a determination will be negligable in comparison to that going 
to the charcoal surface. However, as the end loss of such a wire 
at 100° C would be large in comparison to the heat loss to the gas, 
it appears impractical at present to attempt such measurements. 

Suggestions. 

In order to determine the heat of adsorption of the 
second f ilm of oxygen on tungsten two isotherms were necessary. 
Since one had already been obtained at 25° C it was thought 
advisable to determine the other at 100 °C. This was chosen so

that the temperature difference T a - T x in the Clausius Clapeyron 
equation (page 7) would be as large as possible, increasing the 
accuracy* 

It is apparent from the results that this bath temper 
ature neither gives optimum experimental conditions nor results. 
Due to a possible rearrangement at 100°C, giving an underlying 
surface different to that at 25°C, the calculations of the heat 
of adsorption from the isotherms are somewhat in doubt. In 
addition, the extrapolation of the 100°C a^ 1 s to zero pressure 
cannot be accurately done due to the time taken to reach a 
final value of the accommodation coefficient at low pressures. 

As the pressure in the reservoir B decreases at a rate 
of about 5% per hour it was inadvisable to make determinations 
beyond 120 minutes. Incorporation of a second 2^ litre reser¬ 
voir in the oxygen system would double the capacity as well as 
the time to which determinations could be made. 

Considering the above difficultues and the resulting 
questionability introduced into the data, it would be advisable 
at some future date to redetermine the isotherms at lower tem- 

o 

peratures, say 0 V and 55 C. At such temperatures the end losses 
are small enough to allow the use of a short, fine wire, the 
resistance of which preferably would be about 15 ohms. In such

a determination, many of the difficulties encountered in the 
present experiments could be eliminated, the result being 
greater accuracy of measurement.
