PREFACE 


The knowledge of God as used in the Old Testament has not been 
set forth in English to any great extent by Biblical scholars’^. As a 
result, the almost exclusive sources used in this thesis are texts of 
Old Testament Scripture. The authorized and Smith-Goodspeed American 
Translation , as well as the Hebrew text, have been used. The quotations 
have been taken mainly from Smith-Goodspeed. The letters A.V. designate 
when the authorized version has been quoted, and M.T., where the Hebrew 
text has been translated. 

The Hebrew text used was the received Massoretic Text as pub¬ 
lished by the Hebrew Publishing Company, Hew York. Translations made 
in this text were made with the use of A Hebrew and English Lexicon of 
the Old Testament , edited by Francis Brown, S. R. Driver and Charles 
A. Briggs, 1906. 


Recent European scholarship has dealt with this subject, for example, 
Die Srkenntnis Gottes bei den Alttestamentlichen Profeten , von 

Sigmund Mowinckel.

INTRODUCTION 

When approaching a Hebrew word, idea or concept one must be aware 
of the differences that exist between Hebrew and modern thought. The 
modern mind has been influenced by Greek analytical thought. This in¬ 
fluence has taught us to approach problems with a logical reasoning process. 
First we define the problem before us, then we analyze it, and finally we 
make our generalizations. The Hebrews lack this process and as a result 
they do not think in the same logical manner that characterizes the modern 
mind. They lack abstract generalization almost entirely. Indeed, if we 
were to look in the Hebrew dictionary we would not find any abstract 
generalizations worth mentioning. 

Another distinction to be made between the Hebrew and modern mind 
is that they did not have the same categories of thought that we have. 

Norman H.Snaith says that the difference between primitives and us is not 
in their application of reason but in their lack of categories^-♦ We 
classify everything under the categories of mind and spirit. The Hebrew 
mind, however, had no corresponding set of categories. He just didn*t 
make the distinction. We also have the categories of mind and body, but 
for the Hebrew there was no sharp distinction between the mind and body. 

They never asked whether the mind controlled the body or vice versa. We 
have also our famous three-fold division of will, emotion and intellect. 

The Hebrew did not use these categories but saw man as a unit or a total¬ 
ity.

The early Hebrew did not have the formal education of schools and 
colleges. His schoolmaster was the father of the family. His school 
room was life itself. The only formal training he had was that of learn¬ 
ing a trade. His knowledge then was gained from the schoolroom of life's 
situations with the result that it was experiential and practical. He 
thought in totalities and never or rarely analysed or divided the thing 
of which he was speaking 1 . The Hebrew, then, when he spoke of a subject 
spoke of it in totalities. These totalities were pictures or images drawn 
from his sensory experience of life, for example, the family. He had seen 
that the family was in many respects a totality. Consequently, when he 
thinks of a group he sees it as a family. We see these word pictures 
throughout the Bible. The Bible translates, “appease God,” but for the 
Hebrew the same idea is expressed in the image, “make God's face shine. M 
The word picture the Hebrew makes for prayer is that of a man prostrating 
himself before God. Thus we can see how the Hebrew speaks in words that 
are pictures of what he has seen, felt or heard. 

These pictures or totalities may gather together into a whole com¬ 
plex of ideas centred around a single word. This whole group of totalities 
or pictures gathered up and brought to one word is one reason why it is 
often so difficult for us to define a Hebrew word in our terms. The bond 
that binds these groups of totalities to the one word is association. 

These totalities or images are gathered into groups ty the process of 
associated thought with the result that there is a wide range and indeed 
often a bewildering array of possible meanings for any word.

With this pattern of Hebrew thought in mind, this paper will examine 
the various passages related to the topic in an attempt to bring the basic 
ideas forward. 

The basis for the outline has come from Proverbs 2:1-6^. This par¬ 
ticular section, however, has not been selected arbitrarily. In studying 
other passages it has been found that in general they can be fitted into 
the outline as found here, that is, the desire for wisdom (2:1-3) and the 
strenuous search (2:4) > resulting in an understanding of reverence for 
the Lord and a discovery of the knowledge of God (2:5). This is followed 
by wisdom which comes not as an attainment but as a gift from God (2:6). 

To this outline has been added another section called, The Results 
of Reverence and Knowledge of God . This paper is concerned chiefly with 
the knowledge of God, therefore there will be a special emphasis made on 
this particular subject. 


The beginning of the outline elaborates on Wisdom. 

p 

These have been placed under the heading, M The Pursuit of Wisdom and 
Its Results.”

CHAPTER I 


THE HEBREW CONCEPTION OF WISDOM 
1. Knowledge ( ^ ^ T - daath) 

Wisdom for the Hebrews was, in its broadest sense, the ability to 
get things done In a proper way^. This conception differs in some res¬ 
pects from our modern ideas of wisdom. When we think of a man of wisdom 
we are inclined to think of one who has gained a great deal of knowledge 
from books, or perhaps a man who has had years of formal education. The 
Hebrews had no idea of a formal education, at least not until later times. 
Their wisdom was not a book wisdom. They thought of wisdom more as prac¬ 
tical knowledge. A knowledge that was not so much the study and knowing 
of facts as it was knowledge through experience. The Hebrew did not think 
in terms of theories or abstract ideas. Knowledge, as something to be 
acquired from books, although it was a factor (Is. 29:11-13), was not the 
characteristic that lay behind the Hebrew conception of wisdom. A man of 
wisdom is a man whose knowledge is acquired through experience (Josh.23:14)• 
There is an intimacy about their idea of knowledge ( J) y T). God is 
spoken of as knowing the hearts of the sons of men (I Kings 8:39)> and 
knowing his true servants (II Sam. 7:20). This knowledge through experi¬ 
ence comes to a point where it is natural and almost instinctive as a 
beast would know its master or its own stall (Is. 1:3). 

Knowledge, to the Hebrew, as for other mental acts, involves the 
whole man. When a man had knowledge of something, that is, knew it through 

Proverbs 8:7. Wisdom is the pre-existent power by which God accomplished 
His creation.

intimate experience until it became natural and instinctive to him, then 
it involved his whole nature not just part of his nature, David was "a 
knower of playing upon the harp" (I Sam. 16;16 M.T.), and Esau, "a knower 
of hunting, a man of the open country" (Gen. 25:27 M.T.), These two ex¬ 
amples probably best portray what was behind the Hebrew idea of knowledge. 
To know something a man must become at one with what he knows, as a musi¬ 
cian knows his instrument or a hunter the out-of-doors. It is not just 
one part of his nature, but part of his whole nature. When a musician 
strikes a chord his whole personality becomes absorbed in the music. His 
entire person, physical, emotional, will, intellect, are involved in his 
performance. Similarly with the hunter, as he reads the signs of the 
trail his whole body is attuned to the pursuit. He is instinctively con¬ 
scious of the trampled leaf, the fresh footprint by the water*s edge, the 
direction of the wind and the warning call of the wild bird. A more 
modern illustration of what a Hebrew would call a man of knowledge might 
be a baseball player who moves about the ball diamond easily and confi¬ 
dently. His every movement shows that he is at home in his surroundings, 
that he knows the game intimately. Before the pitcher winds up for the 
pitch he has sized up the batter and the situation, knowing just where 
to throw the ball if it should come to him. Instinctively, he places 
himself strategically for the play and then half crouches as the arm of 
the pitcher comes do?m with the delivery to the batter. With the crack 
of the bat he shifts gracefully to one side, effortlessly sweeps up the 
ball and in one smooth motion throws to the base. To the onlooker it 
looks easy, but behind the XI hf T of the musician, the hunter and the 
athlete lies much practical experience, skill and personal involvement.

We have seen the knowledge element of wisdom in that it involves 
becoming so acquainted with something that it is known intimately and 
naturally. There lies behind this very intimate relation through practical 
experience another element in the Hebrew comception of wisdom and that is 
] ^ 1 (bin)• The man of wisdom must have bin. We see this in Proverbs 

10:13, where it says, "On the lips of a man of _ ~j 1 2 j ^ wisdom is found. 

The verse goes on to say, "But a man without sense needs a rod for his 
back." The Hebrew words for the translation "without sense" are ip'WOTl 
which mean literally, needy or lacking in heart. The term "heart" for the 
Hebrews means the whole inner life. We have seen already how the whole 
personality is involved in wisdom. A man, however, ?/hose inner life shows 
any marked deficiency, or is not integrated purposefully, is not a man of 
wisdom. The man whose life is integrated purposefully, and not deficient 
in inner life, is a man upon whose lips wisdom is found. 

Through acquaintance with facts by practical experience the® must 
underly the ability to separate or pick out the essential from the non- 
essential. The Hebrew word for this discriminating process seems to be 
gathered up in this verb ]'ZL . The words we use to designate this pro¬ 
cess are such verbs as *to discern* or 'to discriminate.* In Proverbs 7:7 
we see bin used in connection with the senses in discriminating or dis¬ 
cerning "a lad devoid of sense." i G Jonah 4:11 the people of Nineveh 
cannot discern between their right hand and their left (between right and 
wrong). In I Kings 3:9, Solomon in asking for wisdom asks to be able to

discern ( 'plilp between good and evil. In Isaiah 40:14 we see the 
noun used with regard to distinguishing the right path from the wrong 
path. From this discussion we are able to see that the basic meaning 
of )‘2 seems to be that of making things distinct, as discerning the 
good from the evil, the proper course from the improper course. The 
picture we get from the Hebrew term is that of a man standing at a fruit 
stall in the market place, picking from the many articles offered for 
sale the things he wants. He discerns and picks out the good from the 
bad. 

One notices that activity is involved In ] 1 2 3. • Besides the 

discerning, the making of mental distinctions, there is positive action. 

We are inclined to think of wisdom as the studying and sifting out of 

facts from books whereas for the Hebrew there must always be the positive 

activity. Ha does not merely look for the right way but he looks for the 

right way so that he can actually go the right way. In Solomon's prayer 

(I Kings 3*9- ) be asks for discernment not only for the intellectual 

power but that he might use this power. We see his ] ’1 in operation 

2 

in the case of the two women and the baby (I Kings 3:16-18) . 

"A man of understanding hath wisdom" (Prov. 10:23 A.V.), and again 
in 17:24 (A.V.) "Wisdom is before him that hath understanding." In 14:33 
(A.V.) "Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding." In 
each case the word 'understanding* derives from the root ") 1 1 . A man 
with the ability to discern good from evil has wisdom. He is a man whose 
inner life Is whole or integrated purposefully and ethically because of 

1 Hiphil infinitive construct of 

2 

This is the Deuteronomic position read back into the time of Solomon 
by the composer of the prayer.

his ability to distinguish good from evil (Prov. 10:13). 

It is interesting to note that in each of the above passages wisdom 
is contrasted with the ways of the fool. The Hebrew word used here for 
fool is 03 which means literally thick one, one who is too dense to 
discern the right from the wrong. J?' D 3 is not an intellectual foolish¬ 
ness but rather a moral foolishness. This is the type of fool who is mis¬ 
guided. The fool who has not the sense to see that what he is doing is 
shameful; indeed he is a malicious type of fool delighting in evil. His 
life, if it is in harmony, if it is integrated, then it is on a low 
ethical level. . .it is like sport to do ?/rong” (Prov. 10:23). His 
true powers have been held in bondage as he waste fully pursues folly. He 
has subjugated himself to a low aim (Prov. 17:24) and he cannot shake it 
off. Frederick the Great once said, 11 Glory .... is folly, but it is folly 
that you cannot shake off, when once you get it fastened upon you.” This 
type of fool has not the strength of y 2 which enables him to apply 
his life to high purposes. His inner life is deficient, out of tune, off 
key. The man of tebunah (noun of bin) discerns the values that are su¬ 
premely worth striving for. His life becomes steady, one“directional, 
and coherent. He is a man of wisdom. 

There is a fallacy in our conception of what the ideal should be 
in modern education. Whether we acknowledge the fact or not our ideal 
seems to be to arm our young men and women with a smattering of knowledge 
in many fields and a great deal of knowledge in a few selected branches 
of study. Now this may sound like a very worthwhile emphasis but the fact 
of the matter is that in our emphasis on factual knowledge we have dis¬ 
regarded what should be the primary emphasis in every educational program

and that is character. The best educated people in the world may still 
have deteriorated morals. Nazi Germany serves us as an example of a 
highly educated people who stooped to the merciless slaughter of thousands 
of innocent men, women and children. The goal of every educational pro¬ 
gram should not be robots of learning, but men and women of wisdom. Men 
and women who have a stable and integrated life built around a firm tebu- 
nah or value judgment. Wisdom does not entail being an intellectual giant. 
The number of degrees does not measure the v/ise man. A man of wisdom may 
be a man with little or no education. This does not mean one should be¬ 
come less concerned in his search for knowledge, indeed we should always 
strive for greater knowledge in all fields of life; but the principle 
behind it all should be the harmonious, well integrated person whose whole 
life is based on high values. 

The great problem that confronts our world today is not that we 
lack knowledge but that we lack wisdom. We have the knowledge but it has 
outrun the proper inner attitude toward life. 


3. Skill 

There remains one more characteristic that should be considered 
under the Hebrew conception of wisdom. Wisdom used in a narrow content 
may mean nothing more than skill in bringing about a humanly desired result 
whether it be good or evil. A man who sets as his aim to seduce a woman 
♦and knows how to do it is considered a wise man”**. The serpent in the 
garden of Eden was "wiser than any beast of the field 11 because he was able 

^ II Sam. 13:3. Jonaaab is called "very wise" (A.V. translates D3 P 
here as "subtle"). T r

to carry out his purpose of tempting Eve\ Wisdom seems to mean here noth¬ 
ing more than being able to get things done to plan as a workman would 
make an article to suit a blue print. Indeed the skilled tailor who is 
able to make vestments so that they will come up to specifications for the 
buyer is called "wise hearted 51 or "filled” with the spirit of wisdom 
(Ex. 28: 3). Other examples of skill or of practical know-how are the 
pilots or stearsmen of boats (Ezek. 27:8). In technical work the carpenter 
and the goldsmith (M.T.) are men who are called skilled men because they 
are able to get things done according to requirement (Jer. 10:9). Joseph 

in Egypt had the skill or the know-how of administrative affairs and was 

2 

spoken of as a man "discerning and wise" . One who knows and is able to 

tell the meaning of dreams or to weave the proper magic spell is also a 
3 

wise man . In general, all those who know how to do something in the way 
that it should be done are called wise^". 

In the discussion thus far we have seen how wisdom was used as the 
practical knowledge of doing certain things in a proper way. This char¬ 
acteristic, that is, the practical knowledge of doing things in a proper 
way, expanded to take in all realms of life. In this larger realm of all 
life it soon took on an ethical complexion. So important did wisdom, in 
the ethical- sense for the whole of life, become that it became a recognized 
pursuit among the Hebrews. There came to exist among them a special class 
or school of persons who devoted themselves especially to wisdom study. 

The title of "The Wise" was accordingly given to this type of study. They

a bad sense. T

were observers of life. They saw the problems of life and how people 
responded to them. They walked among the market stalls, through the busy 
streets, and in the quiet places. These men attempted to penetrate every 
corner of life and from careful observation and consecrated thought they 
aimed to reveal the proper way in life so that men might follow it more 
readily. From the practical knowledge of every nook and corner of life 
they attempted to show men, through the wisdom literature, the straight way, 
the good way. 

In the discussion thus far we have seen that wisdom ( D HDfl) 
used in a general sense, means to get things done in a proper way. It 
may be used to mean skill in the ordinary affairs of life, for example, 
seamanship, technical work, administration, explaining dreams, etc. We 
have seen previously in our discussion of ]' IL how it passes from the 
practical know-how to a moral knowledge. Likewise with skill, it passes 
from ordinary skill until it takes on a moral connotation. This is typical 
of all the Hebrew words connected with wisdom ( n Q3(J ). A diagram 
will illustrate this principle:

The wise man then, besides having the characteristics described 
previously, is one who has the skill or the practical knowledge of how to 
direct his life worthily and well. His life is lived in the way it should 
be lived, just as in a narrower sense a skilled seaman knows how to pilot 
his ship. 


4• Consistency in Action 

The above argument has led to the conclusion that the man of wisdom 
is a man who is predictable, a man who is consistent in his actions. Once 
a skill has been learned then the performance of that skill is predictable. 
There will be a general consistency in action, as a highly skilled weaver 
will ordinarily weave a better than average piece of cloth. Similarly, 
once a pattern of life has been learned then the life becomes predictable 
and consistent in action. In Proverbs 15:21 we read, “Folly is joy to a 
man lacking in heart\ but a man of tebunah (discernment) keeps a straight¬ 
forward course.* 5 ‘Straightforward* is used here in an ethical sense, that 
is, the good course as distinguished from the evil. A man of tebunah, 
which as we have seen is a characteristic of wisdom, is a man who is con¬ 
sistent in following the right way. 


5. In Summary 

The Hebrew conception of wisdom has many component parts. All 
wisdom starts with experience whose bounds take in the ?/hole range of

life and action. From the experiences of life wisdom comes to mean the 
integration of the whole personality about something^. It means the 
intimate knowing of it as David knew his harp. Wisdom also includes the 
power of discernment, the ability to distinguish one thing from another 
as the man standing over a fruit stall selecting fruit. Within its bounds 
wisdom also includes skill, or the practical knowledge of how something 
should be done, as a skilled craftsman going about his work. Wisdom is 
also consistent in action. These elements are all associated under the 
Hebrew concept of wisdom and are given,as we have seen, a peculiar moral 
significance. We noted it was the moral significance that was important, 
not the intellectual. 

The man who acts so as to bring about good is the wise man; the 
man who acts so as to bring about evil is the fool. Wisdom then becomes, 
in general, the ability to get things done in a proper ethical way by in¬ 
timate knowing through experience. 

Wisdom can mean proficiency in humanly designated good. We must 
remember here, however, that the Hebrew starts with the axiom that there 
is a Supreme Being, a Creator, Sustainer, Ruler and Judge of all. With 
this axiom the Hebrew can make his Tsdsdom transcend the narrower reference 
of proficiency in humanly designated good to the stage where it is the 
knowing and serving the purposes and designs of God. Wisdom then, in its 
highest sense, is to know and do God’s will in all the complex relations 
of human life and conduct. 

A man may be wise in one sense and yet foolish in another. He may 
be wise in that he does what human designs call for and yet foolish in 

The reader will notice vagueness on such points as ’something*, ’proper', 
’the good way’, etc. The reason is that the discussion is not ready to 
deal more specifically with these points as yet.

that he runs against the will of God, Once again we see that under this 
concept of wisdom the most educated and talented person can be a fool in 
that he uses his abilities for selfish human ends (II Sam. 15:lff). 

In the discussion to follow it will be seen that true wisdom is 
to come into relation with God and this not through man’s power alone.

CHAPTER II 

THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM AND ITS RESULT 

1. The Desire for Wisdom 

Wisdom for the Hebrew was of inestimable worth and greatly to be 

desired. The Wisdom writers expressed the import of wisdom and their 

aspiration for it in many ways. rt She is a tree of life to those who 

grasp her, and happy is everyone who holds her fast” (Prov. 3:IS M.T.). 

The Wisdom writer says, as honey comb is sweet to the taste so is wisdom 

to your whole inner life ( 2? ). M If you find it, you will have a future, 

and your hope will not be cut off tt (Prov. 24:13-14). Indeed the Wisdom 

School saw the desire for wisdom as the principle desire of life. In 

Proverbs 4*2 the father instructs his son to get wisdom above all things. 

He teaches his son the way of wisdom so that when he walks, his steps will 

not be hampered. When he runs he will not stumble (Prov. 4*12)^. 

In Proverbs 8:11 wisdom is of more value than the corals and of 

all things that may be desired there is no treasure that can be compared 
2 

to wisdom ♦ It is much better to get wisdom than gold (Prov, 16:16). In 
these expressions the Wisdom writers attempt to portray the inestimable 
worth and desirability of wisdom. 


1 Wisdom and uprightness are used in parallel here. They are virtually 
synonymous, meaning to go the straight way. 

Similarly, Job 28:18.

2. The Strenuous Search 

Although wisdom is desirable it is not easily attained. It is too 
high for the fool, the impious, wicked person (Prov. 24:7)\ It is above 
attainment for the man who is so lacking in insight and judgment that he 
has missed following the straight path. No, wisdom is not easily attained. 
It cannot be given by one man to another. The father in Proverbs 4*12 may 
teach his son the way of wisdom but he cannot actually give him wisdom. 

In Proverbs 2:2 the son is told to incline his ear to wisdom. We have 
here the picture of a youth causing himself to listen intently as though 
he were, with hand cupped to his ear, straining to catch the sound of 

p 

wisdom'". In Proverbs 5:1 we visualize something of the same picture of a 
man attending attentively to wisdom. These examples all shoitf that wis¬ 
dom is not something that is easily acquired. Indeed wisdom is to be 
gained only through strenuous search and effort. It must be sought for as 
one would seek silver (Prov. 2:4) . Here the verb to seek implies a strenu¬ 
ous searching. Wisdom must be searched for as one would search for a 
hidden treasure (Prov. 2:4)^. Here we have the active searching out, or 
the exploring as one would to find a treasure. One might visualize from 
these words a man with shovel in hand actively digging in the sand for a 
hidden treasure. Once again the idea is conveyed of strenuous searching. 

In Proverbs 4:5,7 the command is given to n get wisdom.” The verb used 
here comes from the root, a to acquire, or to purchase”'*. The idea is 

^ P * 1 Y? P - from *p 1 7) - to be foolish. Noun means a fool, an im¬ 
pious wicked person, one^who has missed the straight path. 

^ Hiphil of .1 W j7 - cause to incline, attend. 

3 UJ jl 2 - always used in the intensive form. 

^ Qual of 3 !] “ the active form of the verb.

conveyed of one searching for and purchasing something. From this we 
visualize a man seeking for an object he wants to buy and laying down 
his hard earned cash in the purchasing of it. Thus in the expression 
**get wisdom 1 ' there is conveyed to our minds the impression of a man seek¬ 
ing out wisdom and gaining it at a cost to himself. Once again we see wis¬ 
dom is not to be easily attained but costs man something to acquire. In 
Prov. 7:4 one is to search for wisdom until it becomes as imtimate as 
one's own flesh and blood. 

In these passages we see something of the nature of the strenuous 
search and effort to achieve wisdom. In Proverbs 2:2 one is to cause 
himself to incline, or attend, as to listen for wisdom. In 2:4 the idea 
is conveyed f&rst of intensive seeking as for silver, and secondly, active 
exploration as for a hidden treasure. In Proverbs 4*5*7 the impression 
is one of searching out and acquiring wisdom at a cost to oneself. Finally 
in Proverbs 9:4 one is commanded to know wisdom ao well that it becomes 
as one's ov/n flesh and blood. 

But what happens as a result of this strenuous search? Does one 
attain to wisdom through his own efforts? 


3* The Search Met by Divine Revelation : 

In Job the young man Elihu makes the statement, n I thought days 
should speak, and many years should teach wisdom. However, it is a spirit 
in man, and the breath of the Almighty, that makes them intelligent.... 
(Job 32:7,8). It is the spirit in men and the breath of the Omnipotent 

Intelligent is from the root y2

that causes men to be discerning and men of wisdom* 

The Hebrew word ruach ( fl ) translated spirit, also means wind, 

T 

breath, etc., words that signify animation, movement, vigour, life"^. There 

2 

is within all men this God-given living power . Elihu is saying that there 
is this God-given living power in all men, but he emphasizes that it is 
the "breath of the Almighty" that causes them to be men of discernment, 
men of wisdom. The term, "breath of God" to the Hebrew was the creative 
power God was able to give man, as a breeze kindles a smouldering fire to 
a blazing flame. So Elihu is saying in effect, like so many have said 
before and since, that he thought the age of a man would make him wise, 
that years of knowledge and experience would teach him true wisdom. He 
discovers, however, that this is not the key to true wisdom, for there is 
a living power within each one of us, despite the number of years, which 
needs the touch of the creative power of God before we even begin to be 
intelligent, before we even begin to be men of wisdom but the final reve¬ 
lation must come from God. 

Many professors and Varsity students today feel that they are men 
and women of wisdom. They have, after all, several years of schooling, 
a B.A. degree, perhaps even an M.A. or a doctorate. Surely they are people 
of wisdom. The truth of the matter is, however, that they are not intel¬ 
ligent people, are not truly men and women of wisdom, unless there is room 
in their curriculum, the whole curriculum of life, for seeking with all 
one's heart and soul and mind and strength "the deep things of God." Even 
then the attainment is not theirs. Wisdom is not a conojiest of man but it

judges were said to be inspired by ruach, too.

is a God-given gift. It is God who gives wisdom (Prov. 2:6). It is God 
who tells the secrets of wisdom (Job 11:6). Man does not know the ways 
of wisdom nor from whence it comes. It is concealed from the eyes of the 
living and the birds of the air 1 . Wisdom is known only to God. If man is 
to climb to the highest ranges of Wisdom, then one must have the guidance 
of divine revelation. There is the assurance that those who go in the 
straight way, and who have integrity of heart, soul, mind and strength 
will find help in God . The Lord forsakes not those who seek Him (Ps. 9tl0). 

The result of the strenuous search then is the realization that 
man cannot attain wisdom by himself. He sees that wisdom is a necessity 
for life and yet he cannot succeed to it through his own striving. It is 
when man reaches the point where he realizes his own inability, that God 
intervenes. We visualize a man travelling a road and then suddenly coming 
to a dead end. He realizes that he can go no further, but instead of 
turning back he waits patiently for God to open a way for him. We picture 
God taking the initiative and suddenly the man sees a narrow path that he 
had never noticed before. He takes the path which leads him out into the 
open road of God’s highway. 


4. The Heart Near to God 

When a man comes to the realization of his own inadequacy in at¬ 
taining unto wisdom, then God responds by bringing the whole life of man 
into closer union with Him.

^ Prov. 2:7 (M.T.) - O’lW’ - from root 7I(J' - to go in the straight or

The heart near to God through divine initiative becomes the spring 
board for true wisdom. In Jeremiah 24:7 we read, "And I will give them a 
heart to know me as the Lord; and they shall be my people, and I will be 
their God; for they shall turn to me with all their heart," When the people 
turn to God with all their heart, realizing their own inadequacy, he res¬ 
ponds giving them a heart to know Him, The nation’s realization of its 
own insufficiency will result in its true wisdom because it is then that 
God takes the initiative and brings their life to know Him as the Lord. 

The heart near to God is essential for true wisdom. 

Jeremiah says that a New Covenant, a covenant of the heart will be 
written on the hearts of the people by the Lord, and'they will be God’s 
people and He shall be their God (Jer. 31:33). Once again we see divine 
initiative resulting in the heart of the nation Israel being brought near 
God. The whole life of a nation is to be brought near the purposes of God— 
not only the individual lives, but the nation’s economy, resources, foreign 
policy and social welfare. To bring these into harmony with the purposes 
of God should be the goal of every nation. Nations must seek to bring 
every aspect of the national life into harmony with God. let to speak of 
the inner life of a nation is to be rather vague. The inner life of a 
nation cannot be changed until the inner lives of the individuals in that 
nation are changed. The individual is the key. This is what Jeremiah saw 
so clearly when he said there must be a New Covenant of the heart. It 
must take place in the individual before the nation will be affected. 

God’s response to such a change of heart is to bring a nation into harmony 
with His will. As such, that nation becomes an instrument in God’s hand 
for bringing the whole world unto Him.

Solomon standing before the altar of the Lord raises his voice in 
praise and says that there is no God like thee in the heavens above nor 
upon the earth beneath, who keeps covenant ( J1'1 J. 11 ) and loving kind¬ 
ness ( TO H D ) with thy servants who go before thee with all their heart^. 
God maintains a close relation with those who go before him with their 
whole inner life. Here we picture a man approaching the throne of God in 
fear and trembling, and laying his whole life frankly before the Lord, yet 
knowing that in this act God will keep the bond between Himself and man. 

Man treads the heights of wisdom when he comes before God, openly 
and unreservedly, knowing that somehow God will reveal his nature. Know¬ 
ing that in this act of throwing himself upon God’s mercy God will keep 
covenant with him and cement the bond with loving kindness. The act of 
sacrificial presentation of one’s life involves the certainty that God will 
show His loving kindness to men. This certainty is not arrived at by- 
logic but it is the knowledge that Christianity speaks of as faith. One 
knows it in the sense that one knows that his faith is true. A man of 
wisdom must have faith, the faith to throw his life upon the mercy of God, 
confident that those mercies exist. ’’Faith has filled the night sky with 
stars. 15 ^ 

God meets man openly and without reservation, with a covenant, 
whose nature is that of loving kindness which brings the heart of man near 
to God. 

In Psalms 119:9-12 the young man says that he has sought God with 
his whole heart. He asks that he may not wander from God’s commands and 
that he may not sin against Him. Sin (7) L3 fl) for the Hebrew was to miss

the mark, to miss the right way, to fail to find God's way. This Hebrev/ 
thought inevitably leads to the conclusion that to sin is to display a 
lack of wisdom. This young man has stored God's message in his heart so 
that he may not miss the true way. He realizes that the life away from 
God is one of missing the right and true way of life. The heart away from 
God is wide of the mark, it misses wisdom. In Isaiah 1:4>5> the prophet 
attributes the evil and corruption of Israel to the fact that they have 
forsaken and departed from the Lord. The inner life is diseased because 
they have spurned and rejected God. They have estranged themselves from 
God and as a result the heart is remote from Him. Here is an example of 
the reverse process, the result of a heart not being near God. These 
people are not wise because they have turned from the Lord. 

Again in Isaiah 29:13f(A.V.), we have a fine example of the heart 
distant from God: 

13. "‘Therefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near 
me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have 
removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is 
taught by the precept of men: 

14. "Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work 
among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder: for the 
wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of 
their prudent men shall be hid." 

The people are merely worshipping God with their mouths. They are giving 
God honor through unappreciative lips. Their inner life is far from God. 
Their reverence for God has become a commandment of men. A commandment 
which they have become so accustomed to that they know it ty rote. Isaiah 
says that their wisdom v/ill perish. It will perish as a natural result of 
their inner life being distant from God and their lack of true reverence. 
In this passage the heart distant from God and the lack of reverence are

closely associated. The withstraining of the heart from God produces the 
corresponding loss of reverence. The loss of reverence destroys the foun¬ 
dation upon which wisdom is built. If you lose reverence for the Lord 
you have lost wisdom (Jeremiah 28j28).

CHAPTER III 

REVERENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 

1. The Same Religious Experience with Different Connotations 

The result of the pursuit of wisdom is not wisdom but rather rever¬ 
ence for the Lord, The pursuit of wisdom also leads to the discovery of 
the "Knowledge of God 1 2 3 ' (Prov, 2:5). The heart near to God results in 
reverence and knowledge; the feeling of awe and the feeling of intimate 

relationship. Indeed, the fundamental principle of wisdom is to fear God^ 

2 

and know the All Holy . 

The Hebrew had no expression for religion so he used these t?/o 
terms: the fear of the Lord (D’TV?/? or fl) R 1 ) and 

the kno¥/ledge of God ( D' Tl '*? t) XI ^ T ). The former is used more fre¬ 
quently than the latter yet they are so closely related that it is dif¬ 
ficult to distinguish the meaning of the two by definition. They are not 
exactly synonymous but describe the same religious experience from diffe- 

3 

rent viewpoints . Fear of the Lord, however, seems to come more properly 
before the Knowledge of God. The Hebrew had to have personal experience 
before he had the knowledge of something. The knowledge of God must come 
as a result of the personal experience which comes through the fear of the 
Lord.

2. “Fear of the lord. 11 

(a) What is “fear of the Lord"? 

The term "fear of the Lord" is not to be misunderstood as an attitude 
that is craven or cowardly. The term means rather a reverential awe in 
the presence of the Holy. The Hebrew words £ Yi and , which 

are translated as God in the Bible, gather up this idea of the Holy. God 
was everything that was bound up in their conception of holiness and the 
pages of the Bible tell of man’s striving to bring himself into communion 
with the holiness. 

The xford for holiness is "godesh** and in the Old Testament it has 
two distinguishable aspects. In one aspect it was considered as being at 
least semi-personal and perhaps wholly impersonal, while in another it is 
considered as being entirely personal. The distinctive Hebrew development 
began with the use of the root in its personal sense with reference to God 
alone and it comes to stand for the positive activity of that Personal Other 
whom the Hebrews recognized as God. Here we move into the realm of the 
’numinous’ as described by Rudolph Otto\ Otto uses the term ’numinous* 
to stand for’the holy’. Among the elements in the ’numinous’ or ’the 
holy’ we find the component which is fundamental to true religion and that 
is the creature feeling in the presence of the Diety. The emotion of a 
creature abased, and overwhelmed by its own nothingness in contrast to that 
which is supreme above all creatures (Gen. 18s27). Everything turns upon 
the character of this overpowering might, a character which cannot be ex¬ 
pressed verbally, and can only be suggested through the tone and content 
of a man’s feeling response to it. There lies also in this ’numinous’ the

element of awefulness. An emotional response that is distinct from fear 
although it resembles fear—a religious dread or awe. It just begins to 
appear in the feeling of something uncanny, wierd or eerie. Otto believes 
that it is this feeling emerging in primitive man which forms the starting 
point for the entire religious development in history. It is this feeling 
that the Hebrews took and gave its full fruition in the work of the eighth 
century prophets. 

Besides the element of absolute unapproachability there is another 
factor stnd that is the element of absolute overpoweringness. There is a 
feeling of abasement, of being but dust and ashes and nothingness. Another 
element is that of energy or urgency—a force that knows no stint nor stay— 
a force which is urgent, active, compelling and alive. There is also the 
feeling of the ‘Wholly Other*. The ‘Wholly Other* is beyond the sphere of 
the usual and the familiar. It is outside the limits of knowledge, fil¬ 
ling the mind with bland wonder and astonishment, something of whose 
special character can be felt but never completely expressed. Finally, 
there is in the experience of the Holy One the element of fascination. 

The divine may appear to the mind as an object of horror or dread, but at 
the same time it is no less something that allures with a potent charm, 
and the creature who trembles before it has the impulse to turn to it, 
even to make it somehow his own. It has an emotional, positive and speci¬ 
fic character. Otto explains it as a bliss which embraces all those 
blessings that are indicated or suggested by “any doctrine of Salvation* 1 ; 
it quickens all of them through and through, but then do not exhaust its 
character. It appears as a strange and mighty propulsion toward an ideal 
good known only to religion and in its nature fundamentally non-rational.

This sense of being in the presence of, and under the control of, 
an awful majesty and overpowering Other is the condition which underlies 
all religion. It is a feeling which makes a man realize his own nothing¬ 
ness and creaturehood, bringing him to his knees in dread and yet in 
fascination. It is the mingling of the desire to escape and the allure 
of a potent charm. The force of this tremendous majesty, power and 
authority, making him feel his own insignificance and smallness, and yet 
moving him to an ideal good, is the basic meaning of the Hebrew expression, 
“the fear of the Lord* 1 , which is the beginning of wisdom. 

Another criticism of our educational system today is that there is 
little sense of reverence. Our educational system makes no definite pro¬ 
vision for instilling in youth a deep sense of the Jt fear of the Lord 0 . 

We must have as our ideals men and women who not only have a firm back¬ 
ground of knowledge as we use the term, but also within them a deep seated 
reverence for God. We have one of the highest educational standards in 
the world but it needs a shift in emphasis, a shift from a stress on 
knowledge to a renewed emphasis on wisdom. 

Knowledge today has become in many cases nothing but a spring board 
for a good job, a new car, and an early retirement. Time magazine carried 
this interesting account in an article on youth: f, 0n a sunny Sunday not 
long ago, Sociology Frofessor Carr B. Lowell of George Washington Univer¬ 
sity took one of his students on a fishing trip. He is a brilliant student, 
president of his class, a big man on the campus, evidently with a bright 
future in his chosen field, medicine. In the bracing air, professor and 
student had a quiet talk. Why had he gone into medicine? asked the prof¬ 
essor. Answer: Medicine looked lucrative. What did he want to do as a

doctor? Get into the specialty that offered biggest fees. Did he think 
that a doctor owed some special service to the community? Probably not. 

“I am just like anyone else,” said the student, 11 1 just want to prepare 
myself so that I can get the most out of it for me. I hope to make a lot 
of money in a hurry. I'd like to retire in about ten years and do the 
things I really want to do.” And what are those? ‘ , 0h,’* said the brilliant 
student, ^fishing, travelling, taking it easy.” 

One does not live in a university environment very long ?;ithout 
realizing that this is the attitude of many students. Too many students 
have no sense of reverence about their work or their abilities. They do 
not see these as instruments to be used for the moral purposes of God, 

The Hebrews found it impossible to have any education without religion. 

The contemporary picture is not all black, though, as one finds often 
where one least expects, youth ??ith a deep sense of reverence and as a 
result a consciousness of a high calling about their work. 

I am firmly convinced that a man never sees the full beauty and 
scope of his work until he has "the fear of the Lord” within him. With 
this profound and abiding sense of reverence for Almighty God, distinctions 
between men’s labours no longer exist because labour is no longer looked 
upon as a task for task’s sake but rather an important part of God's 
moral universe. 

Lack of reverence has resulted in many students coming out of our 
institutions of higher learning with a fantastic estimate of their own 
worth, powers and importance. This pride, which is basically self-worship, 
is one of the greatest causes of obscured moral vision. C. S. Lewis calls

pride “the complete anti-God state of mind” 1 . The virtue opposite is 
humility which comes only in its truest form when one stands in “fear 
of the Lord.” When a person or a nation becomes a god unto itself then 
the result is enmity toward God and inevitable disaster. As long as a 
man is proud he cannot know God. Consequently, “fear of the lord” is 
essential for knowing God. 


(b) What “fear of the Lord” leads to: 

A man with the “fear of the Lord” within him can do nothing 
else but respond with the proper moral conduct. This is the natural res¬ 
ponse of a man to “the Holy.” If you are going to bring a person to follow 
a moral pattern in his life steadily and consistently then your whole 
inner life must be touched with reverence. As a small boy I used to be 
ashamed of doing anything that would displease my father. If I did some¬ 
thing wrong the thing that bothered me was not so much the fear of punish¬ 
ment, but the guilt that I felt in the presence of my father. On e might 
say that an element of reverence for one’s parents has guided many a youth 
along the right path when the wrong way opened as a great temptation. 
Similarly, a man’s reverence for the Lord becomes the basis for moral con¬ 
duct. In the Old Testament itself “the fear of the lord” came to have a 
distinct moral content through the influence of the prophets. They saw, 
through their own experience and profound religious insight, that reverence 
was a necessity for proper moral conduct. Through the experience of “the 

Holy” they associated righteousness with a special emphasis. Before the

time of the eighth century prophets the word ‘holiness 1 had come to be 
conditioned by a man’s understanding of the Nature of God, but it was the 
eighth century prophets who brought this distinctive moral development. 
Amos, Isaiah, Micah and Hosea all stress that God by His very nature 
demands right conduct and will be content with nothing else. One of the 
best examples of this is Isaiah 6:1-5. This passage is charged with the 
sense of God, and in the words of John Paterson, “nowhere do we find the 
’otherness' of God so clearly set forth. Nowhere else do we feel so 
strongly the presence and pressure of God. Sight and sound are combined 
to emphasize the ineffable, all-embracing holiness. 1 ’^ Isaiah’s response 
is: 

“Woe is me, for a man of unclean lips am I, and I dwell in 
the midst of a people of unclean lips: For the King, Jehovah 
Sabaoth, my eyes have seen." (6:5 M.T.) 

The idea of the holy as used by Isaiah brings a distinctive element 
to the “fear of the lord.” He becomes convinced of his own and of his 
people’s sin, and all this because he has seen a vision of the King, 
Jehovah, the Holy One. The connection between holiness and righteousness 
is unmistakable. Isaiah sees in the holiness of God moral perfection, and 
the dread and awe he feels is a sense of sin. A sense of moral unworthi¬ 
ness is experienced in his encounter with God. Gan there be any other 
response on the part of man when he meets God? What would happen in a 
church which had something of this sense of reverence? We would hesitate 
to say, but one thing is certain and that is, there would be some changes 
like a smouldering fire kindled into a blazing flame. Reverence brings 
action. God asks, "Whom shall I send?” Isaiah responds, “Here am I,

send me. 11 (6;8) God, say these eighth century prophets, one and all, 
because of His nature, demands right conduct from His worshippers. This 
means justice, honesty and fair dealing among men. 

There is, however, in “the fear of the Lord" no rigid code of 
ethics to be followed, but a natural response of man to the Holy One— 
the God of moral perfection. Some people live according to certain stan¬ 
dards of conduct by which the Christian refuses to live. The reason he 
refuses is not because he believes in a certain code of ethics, however 
fine that code may be, but the reason lies in the Nature of God, in whom 
the Christian believes and holds in reverential awe, the God whom the 
Christian sees revealed in Jesus Christ. 

The “fear of the Lord” due to His holy nature is always the deciding 
factor. The “other cheek” and the ,f second mile” are always part of the 
"fear of the Lord” and then they are not a code to be followed but a plain 
minimal duty. Christian ethics involves more than decent honourable living 
The God of the Christians is more than proper action, honor and truth. 
Honesty that merely will not steal, purity that does not act, humanity 
that takes no unfair advantage, these fall far short of the Christian ethic 
When we slip into that sort of thing we have lost true reverence for God, 
true “fear of the Lord.” 

When the Hebrev/ came before his God it was not only to tremble in 
the presence of His awful majesty, or to be filled with fascination; but 
he knelt before his God and then “turned” and strove to live the good life. 
This should always be the proper attitude in prayer. One kneels before 
God, not to place a list of requests, but to present one’s whole inner

life to be touched by the holiness of God, Then one rises and goes out 
into the world to meet life’s situations with the proper moral conduct, 

A reverence for the tremendous and awful majesty of God, an ear 
open to his words and the response of the whole heart in proper moral 
conduct are all gathered into the concept of "the fear of the Lord,” In 
such an attitude there is no place for pride, no place for a man who 
trusts only in himself and no place for a superior race. The 11 fear of 
the Lord” sets aside selfish pride and the false gods of wealth and power 
and concentrates all one’s energies, all one's inner life, upon God. 

A person must have reverence before he knows what is the right 
way and the true good. Only then can he perceive what God desires him to 
be. Only then can he receive the power to go towards the mark which God 
has set before him. The fear of the Lord is the first step toward wisdom^. 


3. The Knowledge of God 

(a) The Content of the Knowledge of God 

We turn now to the knowledge of God, remembering that it is 
intimately related to the ”fear of the Lord.” Each term is different, 
however, in connotation. 

The first question we ask is just what is the content of the know¬ 
ledge of God? What does the term include? Deuteronomy 7:9-10 sums up 
neatly what for the Hebrews constituted the knowledge of God.

fl Know^ therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the 
faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them 
that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand 
generations; 

And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to 
destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth 
him, he will repay him to his face. 11 (7:9-10 A.V.) 

We see here that to know God was to know Him as the sum total of 
divinity who was worthy of trust and whose moral law ruled the universe, 

(i) The sum total of divinity 

God for the Hebrews came to be the sum total of divinity. 

In the discussion of the n fear of the Lord* 1 we have seen how the holiness 
of God resulted in the development of a transcendental moral God, parti¬ 
cularly under the influence of the eighth century prophets. Indeed God 
became for the Hebrews the centre of all life, permeating and sustaining 
every aspect of it and yet lying behind the natural world as a mighty power. 

To get a clear picture of what the divinity, or the Holy One, 
meant for the Hebrews we must trace briefly the development from early 
days. 

The idea of the Holy was fundamental to all ancient Semitic reli¬ 
gions. The concept was too great to be held by the Semites in its purest 
form, however, so in order to understand and control the Holy they re¬ 
duced the deity. They felt that if the tremendous awe-inspiring and 
fascinating holiness of their deity was broken down into segments then 
it would be more easily approached and understood. This division took 
place in many ways. It took place along localities wherethe deity was

supposed to reside, for example, the tops of mountains or other high 
places, and shrines. There was something awe-inspiring about these places, 
thus their selection. The division also took place along national lines 
and the deity became associated with a particular country or area, for 
example, the god of Ammon, the god of Tyre, and the god of Syria—each of 
these gods being a separate deity. There was also a division along the 
lines of sex—the gods were to control such things as war and hunting 
while the goddesses were used in connection with the homes and the ferti¬ 
lity of the soil. There were gods of function, for example, the storm 
gods, war gods, and gods of the field, etc. Natural objects became 
associated with deity. Anything that expressed power or majesty, or 
filled men with awe—like the river because of its moving power, or the 
trees and leaves with their strange movements in the wind. The sky, the 
sun, the moon and stars were also personified and treated as gods because 
they, too, brought the feeling of awe and wonder. 

The Canaanites had a regular pantheon of gods which followed along 
the lines of their own social organisation. Their gods were called Baals. 
The head Baal was El, who was the father of the gods and of mankind. 

Under him was a hierarchy of gods which were baalim with definite names. 
These included such gods as the gods of the storm, thunder, sun and moon. 
These could be gods or goddesses. Under these were the baalim which were 
unnamed and which were very near to the life of the people like the lepri- 
cons of Ireland. Each Baal had a female partner whose principal function 
was to control the fruition of crops. Their baalim also became associated 
with cities and shrines. The religion of the Canaanites was concerned 
with bringing themselves into a beneficial relation with this hierarchy of 
gods.

The Hebrews did divide and localize to a degree, but they never 
completely identified God with one object. God the the Hebrews was always 
an over-all power. At its worst the Hebrews had a monarchial polytheism, 
i.e., many gods but one God the supreme and controlling deity. They also 
recognized the gods of other tribes but felt theirs was superior. 

At Mt. Sinai something happened which prevented the religion of 
Israel from developing along pagan lines. An incident took place here 
which was to make the Hebrew God distinct from the pagan. A covenant was 
made between God and the people of Israel. The basis of this covena nt was 
the ten commandments which formed the foundation for a complete monotheism. 
The first three commandments in particular laid this foundation (Exod. 20: 
1-17). The first stipulated that there was to be no other God considered 
or used in all the worship of Israel except Yahweh^*. The second stated 
that there should be no graven image of God. They were not to reproduce 
God in the stars, storm, pillars, trees--on anything. The God of Israel 
is his own likeness and his own image. Thirdly, the Hebrews were not to 
take the name of their God in vain. This meant that all attempts to seg¬ 
ment or control God were prohibited. His name was not to be used in any 
ceremony of magical nature, which was a common device used by other Semitic 
people to control the deity. The Hebrew was not to worship or show devo¬ 
tion to any God but lahweh. These commandments were to give the Hebrew 
religion a distinctness which was to result in the deepest realization of 
the divine personality. 

It must not be forgotten that the temptation to revert to pagan 
influences was strong, particularly during the early settlement in Canaan.

Thanks to the work of such God-inspired men as Elija and Elisha and the 
later writing prophets, Hebrew monotheism was kept to the fore. Gradually 
the transcendental holiness of a righteous and just God who met the actual 
needs of men became the foundation of the Hebrew religion. The Hebrew God 
in its essential features still lives in and is the basis for the larger 
Christian civilization. 

With this brief background sketch we can see how the Hebrew God 
rose above the surrounding gods of the pagans. When the writer of Deuter¬ 
onomy said, f, the Lord thy God, he is God,” he was saying that everything 
that was attributed to all the pagan gods was summed up in God. The Hebrew 
Yahweh gathered in all the attributes of other gods, but also due to the 
fact that God was the one and only Holy One^ the content of the divine 
enlarged still further, bringing in new concepts; whereas the pagans in¬ 
vented new gods for new attributes the Hebrews were always including them 
in their own God. 

Some of the concepts that became attached to the divinity can b© 
seen in an examination of the names used of God. The Hebrew looked upon 
’the name’ as descript jive of the character or nature of the person or 
object described. Israel meant the 3 *upright of God. 11 Jacob who was some¬ 
what of a scoundrel before his conversion was a name that meant ■a cheat 1 *. 
So for the Hebrew, God’s name is equivalent to his revealed character. 

One of the words that is translated in the Bible most often as God 
is P tl (El), ?/hich conveys from its root meaning the idea of being be¬ 
hind yet working through nature. El was the head God of the Canaanite 
pantheon, but for the Hebrews this same term became the proper name for

their God and eventually stood for all that was gathered up in the idea 
of the holy (see "fear of the lord"). El with the definite art5_cle 
( p t) fi ) was a term with perhaps a little more definite meaning. It 
meant the true God, the universal God, the one God of all the universe. 

The Hebrews, wishing to emphasize some special aspect of God, used 
descriptive words with El. Among these were such descriptions as the 
Everlasting God ( ^ PY\ ), which meant, the creator of the ends of the 

earth, a God of eternity, not meaning unendingness but a God who was 
independent of time, a God who was completely out of the realm of nature. 
One of the fundamental conceptions of God in the Old Testament was the 
Living God ( Ptl ). This term meant a God who was present continually 
with power in all events of human history. He is a living God, outside 
the earthly circle of death as contrasted to the dying gods of the pagans. 
Other terms that were used to describe special aspects of the divine nature 
were God Almighty ( ' T UJ *?*??), the all-powerful, all-sufficient one, and 

God Most High ( 1V ? if ‘P't)) • An interesting description of God is given 

* : t 

in Genesis 16:13, "Thou God seest me.." This is mistranslated in the 
Authorized Version and should read more correctly as "God the Watcher", 
or "God, the One who sees." This term ( 1 # T V £ # ) appears only once 

in the Bible but while the name disappeared, the function remained in the 
content of the divinity. God, God of Israel, was another descriptive 
term for the divinity. God was a God of a people instead of a particular 
place. He was not a God of a habitation or a particular area but wherever 
his people were there he was also. This concept enabled the Hebrews to 
think of their God as being with them after the destruction of the temple 
and even during the exile in Babylon.

Another name used in a slightly different sense from the rest in 
connection with God was the term translated as lord in the Authorized 
Version ( ' T7 ft )• This word conveys the idea of overlordship. God is 
overlord or master of human affairs. 

Finally there is the word that is translated over two thousand- 
times in the Bible as God and this is the Hebrew word, Elohim ( O' ). 

This term is unusual in that it is the plural form of the noun, El, and 
would properly be translated, ”Gods w . When it is used in connection with 
the Hebrew God it is almost always used with a singular verb (Gen. 1:1). 
This means that it is to be used as the first person singular. There are 
many theories as to why the plural form of the noun is used. The term 
could be used to take in the multiplicity of action of God. It could be 
a summary of the pantheon, i.e., every characteristic belonging to the 
gods of the pantheon are gathered up in Elohim. The name could mean God‘s 
large sphere of action or the plural of majesty. Otto Procksch suggests 
that the Hebrews originally consisted of twelve tribes, each with its own 
god. When the tribes came together the term gods of Israel was used as a 
collective expression to include the god of each tribe. In time the 
original collective word took on a singular conception. Eichrodt suggests 
that the word is an abstract plural so that Elohim means a totality of 
everything that can be called divine. This view seems to be characteristic 
of the Hebrew mind. Elohim seems to be used to bind all the ideas con¬ 
cerning the divine into one unity. No one idea alone is sufficient to des¬ 
cribe the Hebrew God. The term Elohim is used to bind all the concepts 
together.

Attributes that were applied to pagan gods were gathered up in the 
Hebrew God. Some of the ideas that found their roots in early centuries 
and in the pagan tribes were gradually sloughed off. Other ideas came 
which, through experience, were found to be in accord with eternal truths. 
These were retained and through the centuries were often given a larger 
content. 

In general, the Hebrew God was behind nature and yet working through 
nature. He was a living God outside the circle of death. Their God was 
a God of a people and not a particular habitation. He was a God who sees 
or watches. Indeed, He was the totality of everything that could be called 
holy or divine This is the God the writer of Deuteronomy commanded his 
people to know when he said, n Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is 
God. M This is what the Hebrew discovered in his quest for wisdom—he 
discovered something of the nature of his God. 

(ii) Worthy of trust 

This was not all the Hebrew discovered about the nature of 
his God. He found that his God was a personal God, a God who ?;as worthy 
of trust. He found that to know something of the nature of God was to put 
one’s trust in Him (Ps. 9:10). “He is a shield unto them that put their 
trust in him. 11 (Prov. 30:5)* The experiencing of the nature of God led 
the Hebrew to believe that He was “the faithful God, which keepeth covenant 
and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments... 11 (Deut. 7:9). 
This, too, is what the Hebrew found in his quest for wisdom—a personal 
God who was worthy of trust. 

^ The personal name Yahweh is ascribed to God as well. It will be dealt 
with In a later discussion.

In speaking of God as worthy of man’s highest trust we must examine 
one more name attributed to Him. This is the word, Yahweh or Jehova, the 
name of God that was given to Moses by God. This is translated in the 
Authorized Version as Lord and is used over sixty-seven hundred times as 
the personal name of God. 

A personal name implies a personality. Because the Hebrew God had 
a name he became a distinct personal individual being. This fact not 
only laid the foundation for a strong monotheism but also because He was 
a God of a personal nature he could deal with men in a personal way. What 
eternal truths did the Hebrews come to attach to this personal nature of 
God? 

Probably one of the most revealing passages concerning the personal 
nature of God in the Old Testament is in Exodus 3s13-14. This relates how 
when Moses was commissioned to go and deliver the Israelites from Egypt, 
he asked, "Behold, when I come unto the Children of Israel, and shall say 
unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you, and they shall 
say unto me, What is his name? What shall I say unto them? 11 God’s answer 

was, M I am that I am. Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, 

I am hath sent me unto you,” (This eighth century text may be quoted as 
one of the eternal truths that the Hebrews came to associate with God). 

The interpretation of the words, "I am that I am,” generally regarded 
as the best Is, ”1 will be that I will be.” What the word Yahweh originally 
meant we don’t know, but by the eighth century it had come to have the 
meaning n He will be. n If God spoke of Himself, He called Himself ”1 will 
be” ( FP fl Yl ). If men spoke of God they called Him ”He will be” (fj ) H 1 )“.

The verb 'to be' for the Hebrews has not the same meaning that we 
associate with 'to be.' The meaning is more 'to become' or 'to happen.' 

It must be noted that rt I will be** has a present sense as well as an im¬ 
perfect sense. In the present sense the idea is conveyed that this is 
your condition and I am coming into it. This is a basic idea for the 
Hebrew. God is not bound to a shrine, a definite locality, or a particular 
place, but is moving with His people. He is a God who is ever present. 

He is not a God whose phone number one dials when needed, but He is present 
for every situation one is moving into. There is something rather start¬ 
ling and yet wonderful about a conception like that. Startling to think 
of God being at your elbow at all times, and wonderful in that for every 
situation in life God is there. A God who is present for every need as a 
trusted friend whom one can always rely on for support. God, after all, 
cannot be worthy of trust unless he is present in every situation of a 
man's life. This is the eternal truth that the Hebrews discovered about 
God, 

n I will be M used in the imperfect sense means continued action. 

A God who is moving in history. For the Hebrew, God meets his people in 
the course of history and will continue to do so. God is the great "I am”, 
continually present and moving in human affairs. 

Moses asks for the nature of God and he is answered, not by what 
God is, but by ho 11 he acts. God's nature is not something to be discussed. 
The important thing about God is that He is with men in the crises of 
their lives) indeed. He brings about crises in their lives. History is 
His medium of revelation. He is known for what He is by what He does.

What does He do? If God is continually present and yet moving in history, 
what does He do to be worthy of trust? 

Probably the greatest single thing that made the Hebrews aware of 
the trustworthiness of God was the covenant He made with them at Mount 
Sinai ( Exod. 24:Iff). The gracious trustworthiness of God was inscribed 
upon the memory of the Hebrews as they thought of God's deliverance of them 
from slavery in Egypt and the covenant He made with them^. 

The covenant was not a crude bargain nor was it purely a legalistic 
transaction. It actually was an intimate and tender relationship. The 
sealing of the covenant itself showed this close relationship between God 
and man. The people and God shared in a common meal whieh for the Semite 
was a sign of brotherhood. Under such a seal every individual was import¬ 
ant. Every individual stood in direct and personal relationship with God. 

The Hebrews, we remember, derived their categories from life, not 
from abstract philosophical ideas. So we find Hosea and Jeremiah pic¬ 
turing the relationship of God and His people under the figure of the 
marriage bond. Again the relationship is described on a Father-son basis 
(Hosea 11:Iff), and frequently as a King-subject relationship (more so in 
later times). In each case we gather something of the close relationship 
that the covenant was intended to have. We cannot see the relationship 
without seeing the bond of loyalty and faithfulness that existed. This is 
even more clearly sho?m when we examine the word used by the Hebrews to 
describe the cement of the covenant relationship. 

This cement or tie that bound God and His people together in the 
covenant was expressed in an almost untranslatable word 'hesed' ( TOT! ), 

^ Besides the deliverance from Egypt and the covenant, the raising up of 
the Persian conqueror, Gyrus, to deliver them from exile was a real 
crisis inscribed upon the Hebrew memory.

which is one of the most significant words in the Old. Testament. This 
word is translated in the Bible not too correctly ds loving kindness. In 
many instances it is translated as mercy and again it does not give us a 
true picture of the cord of the covenant relationship^. Besides these 
words, others used in the Bible to probe its inner meaning ares goodness, 
kindness and merciful kindness. 

We might come closer to the true meaning of the word ty translating 
it as loyal love, or devotion, with the emphasis being on loyalty, i.e., 
if you keep faith with God, He will keep faith with you. This 'hesed* is 
a reciprocal concept, that is, it not only proceeds from God to man and 
from man to God, but it is also between men. Our concern at the moment 
is God's 'fiesed' towards man. 

This devotion or loyal love of God to man conveys the idea of sta¬ 
bility (Is. 40:6) and trustworthiness as one who keeps an agreement 
(Ps. 89:28). It has behind it the idea of a pact of friendship as shorn 

on David's kindness to Jonathan’s son because of his friendship with 

2 

Jonathan (2 Sam. 9:1-13) . This pact moved to the relationship between 
God and His people takes on a more powerful meaning. 

This loyal love, faithfulness or devotion that lay within the cove¬ 
nant of God and His people ?/as for the Hebrew one of the most important 
ideas in their concept of God. Because of this 'hesed' towards His people 
God was a God who was worthy of the Hebrew's highest trust. Had He not 
delivered them out of evil, had he not chosen them to be His people. He 
had confronted them in crises and delivered them during a thousand years 
of history? Was this not a God worthy of a man's highest trust? A God 

^ Hebrew word for mercy is O'OFIl

who walked with man in every situation and had shown His loyal love and 
devotion time and time again on the stage of actual history where and where 
only God’s relation to man is significant. 

It was as a Deliverer or a Savious that the Hebrews first came to 
know their God Yahweh. It was a Savious God who had been with them in 
the Exodus and at Mt. Zinai, indeed in the return from the exile. This is 
right at the centre of the Hebrews' concept of God. The Old Testament 
and the New are one in placing Deliverance at the centre of their message, 
for has not God's loyal love to man been shov/n again in the realm of hist¬ 
ory in the Incarnation, when God provided the perfect Mediator. In Christ 
God once again comes face to face with man and establishes a personal re¬ 
lationship In Jesus Christ ¥/ho tells us that God loves us, seeks our good, 
bears our sorrow and suffering and demands our exclusive obedience. In 
Christ the Hebre?/ God has spoken again to man, fulfilling the hopes of 
past ages, and reaching forth with power to fulfil the hopes of all time. 

Let us never forget that the measure of a nation or an individual 
is in what it places its trust. If the trust is in oneself or in pov/er 
and force then it becomes as a wooden pole eaten by termites. In outward 
appearance it looks whole but when pressure is brought to bear it crumbles. 
The only security for a nation or an individual is its security tinder God, 
who is the creator and sustainer of the universe. Christians put their 
trust in a different pole—a wooden cross—which to many looks like defeat. 
Yet this gibbet has its security, for there was the third day. 

Know therefore that the Lord thy God, He is God, the faithful God 
v/hich keepeth covenant and loyal love with all His people. God is God, 
and He is worthy of trust.

(iii) God’s moral law controls the universe 

God, for the Hebrew, was the sum total of divinity. He was 
a personal God, a God who met men on a personal level, and He was trust¬ 
worthy. God also, because of His transcendant moral nature (see 51 fear of 
the Lord) ruled the universe with a moral law. The Hebrews, especially 
the prophets, held that there was a way of life in which a man should live. 
There was a principle or spirit of living approved by God. The basis of 
this was the ten commandments whose whole tone was moral. These were the 
cornerstone of God’s moral universe. The prophets kept calling the people 
to return ( TH 14/ ) to these ancient principles which were the foundation 
of the relationship between God and His people. 

Isaiah who expressed so vividly the Hebrew conception of a trans¬ 
cendant moral God (Isaiah 6:If), sees the whole universe permeated with 
God’s moral authority. The natural world, histoiy and human life are all 
places of the activity of God’s moral power. 

Amos, the lowly shepherd in the hills of Tekoa and a tender of 
sycamore trees gives us some of the highest expressions of God’s moral 
authority. This prophet, moving in the realm of nature, comes to the 
conclusion that just as surely as there is a natural law in the universe, 
so there is an effective moral law. He identifies the power that controls 
the natural universe with the moral power of the universe. Amos stresses 
not only the universal Providence of God but also his moral nature. He 
sees clearly the certainty of judgment upon the man who attempts to stand 
against God’s moral universe. God’s righteousness is like a mighty stream, 
it cannot be stopped, it rolls down as a mighty judgment upon those who 
attempt to stand in opposition. 









, ’ ’ i 

■ x . • • <. r 





- 43 - 


Even Hosea, whose message is touched with redeeming love, acknow¬ 
ledges that God's moral laws cannot be broken. Hosea, whose Father-son 
relationship we have mentioned previously, states that sonship for its 
validity depends on the moral action of men. God cannot overlook sin and 
rebellion against his moral law. Obedience and service to God's commands 
are necessary for the filial relationship. 

The prophets, though they climbed many mountain peaks in describing 
the compassion, mercy and redemptive grace of God, still stressed over and 
over again that God's moral law ruled the universe. Injustice (Hosea 6: 
4-11), impurity (Hosea l:l6ff) and inhumanity (Mieah 6:12) were all viola¬ 
tions of God's moral laws and as a result would be punished. This prin¬ 
ciple is reiterated again and again throughout the pages of the Old Testa¬ 
ment. 

The New Testament brings a gospel of forgiving love and redemption, 
but the note that the Hebrews struck is still there. God is not mocked, 
for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap (Gal. 6:7). This 
note of divine judgment is one we often forget in our emphasis upon God's 
love. We must not forget this element of the nature of God. Religion is 
not a cheap sentimentalism. No one ever breaks the ten commandments. We 
may think we are but "we are only violating them—they break us. Just as 
the law of gravity is never broken, so never are the ten commandments. 
God's moral law rules the universe and we are engulfed in it as though 
we were swimming in a mighty river. Tie have the freedom to go with the 
stream the way we choose but we cannot turn against it. We may try but we 
will be submerged. So with evil living—the whole tone of the universe is 
against such living. 






- 44 - 


The pages of history have shown that God is not mocked. We are 
still digging civilizations out of the dust that were not God-centered, 
that flaunted God’s moral rule. Recent history has shown the once proud 
and ruthless dictators, Hitler and Mussolini, destroyed on God’s moral 
anvil. These men and their regimes violated God’s moral laws—they at¬ 
tacked and overwhelmed helpless nations and after each victory they 
strutted more arrogantly, veritable gods unto themselves. It looked as 
though a judgment was not forthcoming but the debts accumulated and the 
Nazi superman were wiped out, and M I1 Duce” was hung upside down in front 
of a garage, his body riddled with bullets from the guns of his own people. 

God is not mocked—I wonder if there is not going to be a judgment 
on the Western World for our use of the atomic bomb to kill thousands of 
helpless men, women and children in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. 

Whatsoever a nation sows so shall it reap. If we sow the fruits 
of war, and the present armament rate of the nations seems to indicate we 
are, we will reap the harvest—WarJ 

Our nation has been entrusted with much. Ours is a land of tremen¬ 
dous wealth of natural resource. A land given much to do much with. True 
patriotism goes beyond national boundaries to a world wide vision. Our 
true patriotism is to be a sharing with the world our wealth of resource 
and standing always for righteousness and justice in the councils of 
nations. If we turn our eyes from the world scene to a narrower national¬ 
istic view—if we refuse our responsibility of standing firmly for world 
peace and co-operation—then we will be another of the broken instruments 
on the floor of God’s workshop which he could not use. 






- 45 - 


Nations nor individuals can go at cross-purposes with God’s moral 
laws and survive. There is nothing sentimental or indulgent about God's 
love. He is not our heavenly grandfather. To those who obey Him, He is 
an exceeding great reward, but to those who reject Him He is a consuming 
fire. 

God is God and He keeps covenant and loyal love with them that love 
Him and keep His commandments. Re destroys them that hate Him. God because 
of his trustworthiness is consistent in action. How this consistency 
affects man depends upon his response. If he loves God and keeps His com¬ 
mandments, then there is the certainty of divine blessing. If there is 
rebellion, or hate, which is the opposite of love, then the same consist¬ 
ency expresses Itself in destruction. This was the Hebrew picture of God’s 
universe. He saw man as under obligation to follow God’s moral way--if 
not, he met with impartial justice. 

The Hebrew summed up the content of the knowledge of God by saying 
God is complete, trustworthy and without crookedness. God is a trans- 
cendant moral person, ??hose moral la?/s control the universe. He is a 
moral God and therefore He is a Saviour. This is the content of the know¬ 
ledge of God in the Old Testament. This is the Hebrew ’’doctrine 1 ' of God. 


(b) Intimate Moral Relationship 

The Hebrew God was a transCendant moral being. In his quest 
for wisdom the Hebrew came to have the knowledge of such a God (Prov. 2;5). 
We ask now, what exactly was the Hebrew knowledge of God.

Knowledge for the Hebrew, as we have seen, Involves an intimate 
relationship that is arrived at only through experience, as David was 
‘‘playing upon the harp 11 and Esau ”a knower of hunting.**^ The whole man 
is involved in knowledge. His mind, will and intellect, indeed his whole 
being, through experience come into intimate relationship with the thing 
known. Before one has knowledge of God there must be experience. The 
knowledge of God becomes the intimate relationship through experience with 
God, It is a close conscious relationship with Him; a personal experience 
of His nature as one would come to know a loved one. The knowledge of God 
involves the whole man. It is not a mere intellectual knowledge of God 
that comes through study, but it is something that has become bone of 
one's bone, flesh of one’s flesh. 

Knowledge of God is an intimate relationship through experience 
with a God of transcendant moral nature. To be in intimate relationship 
with His transcendant moral nature is to be in intimate moral relationship 
with Him. 

(i) Examples of this relationship 

This relationship Is shown in the usual simple, straight¬ 
forward, picturesque way of the Hebrew in Isaiah 1:2-3: 

“Hear, 0 heavens, and give ear, 0 earth. 

For the Lord has spoken: 

’Sons have I reared and brought up, 

But they have rebelled against mej 
The ox knows its owner, 

And the ass its master’s crib; 

But Israel does not know, 

My people show no understanding.’■ 

^ See pp.1-2 for a more detailed discussion of knowledge.

Isaiah speaks of Israel as being in relationship with God as sons 
whom He has reared and brought up. They have been in association as a 
son to a father, and consequently they ought to know God as completely 
and as intimately as a son would know his father. But they have rebelled— 
and have broken the intimate relationship. Isaiah says that even the beast 
knows its owner and its master’s crib, but Israel does not know God. This 
states simply the principle involved in the knowledge of God. The people 
chosen for sonship have broken the close union of Father and son. They 
have rebelled from God and as a result they no longer know God through 
personal moral experience, and therefore it can be said they know Him not 
at all. 

There is no knowledge of God apart from relationship with Him. 

The evidence for this is their non-moral ways, they have become a brood 
of evil doers, a children who deal corruptly (Isaiah 1:4). In Hosea 4t6, 
the people are destroyed for want of knowledge^. They have treated as 
worthless the intimate moral relationship that comes with knowing a trans- 
cendant moral God. The result Is a cursing, lying, murderous, thieving 
and adulterous people (4il). 

Hosea continually holds the knowledge of God before the people. 

In Hosea 6:6, he says: 

’’For I delight in piety, not sacrifice; 

And in knowledge of God, rather than burnt offerings.” 

The people have been offering sacrifices and burnt offerings in an arti¬ 
ficial way. These acts have come to the point where they have displaced 
the deep spiritual relationship that should be between God and the worship¬ 
per. Their sacrifices and burnt offerings have become their religion 

^ Knowledge of God is implied here.

instead of an abiding personal relationship with God. As a result, this 
so-called religious people are in actuality a depraved people. Even their 
priests commit murder and vice. Herein lies a warning to all ministers. 
When a minister becomes so wrapped up in the externals of Trorship that he 
forgets the necessity of a deep spiritual relationship with God, then he 
is no bettor than the man of vice or the murderer. He is slaying the one 
thing that he is to give birth to in the minds of his people. To have a 
deep intimate moral relationship with God is life itself—to deliberately 
destroy that is worse than any wickedness. 

Hosea uses piety in parallelism with the knowledge of God and in 
doing so he gives us an insight into what true piety is. It is not the 
pious look, or the ceremory or the external actions, but it is like unto 
the knowledge of God. The important thing in worship is the deep inner 
experience of God. 

Amos, the great prophet of righteousness, although he does not use 
the term knowledge of God, which is Hosea's favorite term, reckons with 
the presence of this knowledge in the minds of the people^. Amos says, 
n Seek good and not evil that you may live. Lord, the God of hosts, is 
with you, as you have said. 13 (5s 14)* Here again the emphasis is upon God 
being with man so that he seeks good as a result of the intimate moral 
relationship. The term good ( A) ) for the Hebrew meant to come up 
to specifications, as a boat would meet the specifications of the builders 1 
design, or a house, the architects blueprint.. The only way that a man 
can come up to specifications in moral goodness is to have knowledge of 
God. Amos implies this when he says, a that it may be so that the lord the

God of hosts is with you. that you may live.” Amos comes near the 

New Testament here, for Eternal Life in the New Testament is defined as 
knowing God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent (John 17:3). tfhile Amos 
is not referring to the Eternal Life as stated in John, he is stating 
the principle. 

(ii) The nature of it 

The nature or character of the knowledge of God is admirably 
described in Isaiah 40:30-31 (A.V.): 

”Even the youths shall faint; and be weary, 

And the young men shall utterly fall: 

But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. 

They shall mount up with wings as eagles; 

They shall run and not be weary; 

And they shall walk, and not faint. 43 

Here the man living to God and the man living to himself are con¬ 
trasted. Here the stumbling life and the soaring life are compared. The 
poet uses young men as his key—youth for the Hebrew typified strength 
and vigor. He paints a vivid word-picture of even the youth stumbling 
along and falling. The strongest and finest, when they depend on their 
own inner resources and their own strength, will stumble and fall. A man's 
life, for the Hebrew, must have that union with God or he will fall ex¬ 
hausted by the roadside. The power of life came from the Giver of life 
and was received only when a human being was bound in fellowship with his 
God. The Hebrew knew the ultimate end of the man who trusts only in his 
own strength--the man who is a god unto himself. He will be as a man 
wandering in a desert without drink—the stumbling, falling life.

Mary people today feel that because they have as their ideal right 
thoughts, right action and right speech, that there is nothing more that 
could be desired. They claim that they don't need God and that they have 
just as high moral ideals as the man of God. The point they miss is what 
the Hebrews saw early, and that is that only with knowledge of God is 
there the power of living these ideals, indeed the power of life. Isaiah 
shows this very fact and also describes the nature of the knowledge of 
God when he says in vivid poetical language, "But they that wait upon the 
Lord shall renew their strength." The word translated 'to wait' ( fl T ] p ) 
comes from the root meaning to twist or bind. This suggests the tension, 
or the vigorous straining of a life to maintain the knot or bond with God. 
To be in intimate relationship with God means exertion on man's part. 
Knowledge of God is not easily maintained. We see this clearly in Christ 
whose uniqueness was his knowledge of God. Throughout his life he con¬ 
tinually sought to maintain an unbroken bond between himself and God. We 
see this vividly in Gethsemane where Christ in great inner turmoil as to 
what his course should be prayed, as he did on many, many occasions, and 
then rose to do God's will. Even on the cross, as his life was slowly 
slipping away midst pain and agony, he still turned to God so that the 
union between son and Father would never be broken. 

The search for wisdom results in knowledge of God but therein the 
effort to maintain that relationship begins. Man must always strive to 
keep the union between God and himself. Yet despite man's effort to keep 
this intimate personal relationship with his God, he finds himself inade¬ 
quate to do so. God. responds, however, to that life by bringing about 
the right relationship. A power comes into that life. It becomes a soar-

ing life as the eagle soaring fee and powerfully over the ordinary life 
below him. The eagle metaphor is one of the finest II Isaiah could have 
chosen. In the soaring life there must be the strain and effort of the 
whole man to keep the right relationship with his God. Every muscle of 
the eagle is straining to keep him in the air, and though the soaring eagle 
may look as though he is flying effortlessly, in actuality every muscle, 
fibre and feather--indeed his whole being is straining to keep him aloft. 
Tension, yes—but what freedom, what liberty, what power, in the soaring 
life* 

The life bound to God is like a powerful runner who strides on and 
on without tiring, on the great mission of life. The life bound to God 
is as the man who starts on the journey of life and continues to the end 
without exhaustion or fainting. This is the nature of the knowledge of 
God, and that nature is the difference between the stumbling and soaring 
life. 

It is not too much to say that the man who does not know God is not 

truly living. In this respect- the fortieth psalm speaks to all generations 

M I waited patiently for the Lord; 

And he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. 

He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, 

Out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon 
a rock, and established my goings. 15 (40:1-2 A.V.) 

The expression ^waited patiently 51 means, in the Hebrew, bound together. 

The man who is living the abundant life is bound together with God. Once 
again we see the pattern of the intimate relationship and God's response. 

He has knowledge of God and because he has knowledge of God he has the 
power of life. He who knows God walks upon firm foundations and not upon 
miry clay. His steps are directed in right ways wherein lie no pitfalls.

(iii) The Hebrew ideal 

In beautiful poetry Isaiah 11:1-9 sums up the ideal hope 
of the Hebrew people. He envisions the spirit of the Lord resting upon 
the Messiah with life giving power'*'. The power of wisdom and understand¬ 
ing, council and might, knowledge and fear of the Lord, are all part of 
the energizing power of the moral holiness of God. This moral holiness 
of God goes, by means of the Messiah, out into the world, permeating it 
in every aspect. We cannot help but think of Christ in these words. This 
is likely something of what Paul had in mind when he said, ’’Christ the 
power of God, and the wisdom of God” (I Cor. 1:24,A.V.). 

In verses 6-9 (A.V.) we read: 

’’The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the 
leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf 
and the young lion and the fatling together; and a 
little child shall lead them. 

And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young 
ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall 
eat straw like the ox. 

And the sucking child shall play on the hole of 
the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand 
on the cockatrice’ den. 

They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy 
mountain: for the earth shall be full of the 
knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea." 


There shall be no harm or destruction in all God's holy mountain. 
There shall be no violation of God's moral lav; because the land will be 
full of an intimate moral relationship between God, man and beast. "For 
the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover 
the sea."

CHAPTER IV 

THE RESULT OF REVERENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 

"1. The Obedient. Character 

Fear of the Lord and Knowledge of God cannot be broken up into 
two distinct experiences. The Hebrew experienced them both as he came 
into close communion with his God. The experience of awe, fascination, 
submission, trust, intimate knowing, etc. were all interwoven in his 
religious experience. These experiences all came as a result of the heart 
near to God. 

Through reverence and knowledge of God the Hebrew had come to know 
the nature of his God. This nature of God is where his religion began 
and where all religion must always begin. The nature of God must be known 
before man will respond in the proper way. God's nature is the model 
and guide and power for the nature and action of the redeemed man. The 
Hebrew ethic sprang from this focal point. He did not start with man 
and then work up to God, as many contemporary philosophers are prone to do, 
but rather he began always with God and from there he looked at life and 
its problems, 

There is a Greek Proverb which says "The singer comes to resemble 
what he sings". ?lhen the Hebrew came to know and fear his God then his 
actions became as the actions of the God he knew and reverenced. 

Deuteronomy 32:4-6 gives us a clear picture of the Hebrew view of the 
nature of his God, and how as a result of knowing that nature he was led 
to imitate it. The writer describes the nature of God of whom he has 
felt constrained to preach. This man, through personal experience with

God, that comes only through reverence and knowledge of Him, has come to 
know something of His nature. This knowledge determines all man's actions. 

He describes God in the usual picturesque style of the Hebrew when 
he says: 

He is a rock, complete in His activity 
For all his ways are justice 
A God steady and without crookedness. 

He is righteous and upright. 

(Deut. 32:4 M.T.) 

In this single verse the writer has taken in almost the complete 
scope of the Hebrew concept of the nature of God. To see how the writer 
derives his ethic from God's nature it will be well to have in mind the 
characteristics of God that he has experienced. 

He is a rock. In all Semitic religions the rock is a symbol of 
deity. The rock represents protection and security. During fierce 
storms it was to the saving shelter of the rock that the Hebrew fled. The 
rock also represented massive and permanent strength, unmovable and not 
subject to change or decay. With this background of ideas the rock became 
for the Hebrew a natural description of his God. To make certain that God 
would not appear to be a static being the writer says that God is complete 
in His activity. ( □' dJl ). The Hebrew word for complete means well 
rounded, full, perfected. The writer is saying that there is no lack of 
any kind in God's activity. God is perfect in every detail. He goes 
on to describe God's nature by saying, "All his ways are justice". The 
Hebrews saw whole creation as ruled by God's divine justice. This justice 
is binding on men whether they obey it or not. The writer is stating that 
there are moral laws ruling God's universe just as there are natural laws. 
There was no distinction in the mind of the Hebrew, one was just as certain 


as the other.

God is steady and without crookedness. The Hebrew had experienced 

his Creator as a trustworthy and faithful God. He reinforces this by 

saying God is without crookedness or a never deceiving God. Finally God 
is righteous and upright. God is righteous ( P ' 7 3 ), He is irreproachable 
in all His acts. He cannot be found guilty in anything he does. He is 

beyond reproach. God is upright ("llz)' ). This means to walk straight, 

T T 

evenly and purposefully to the proper goal. God’s actions are straight 
and even as they move towards His consummation. 

The writer has described God’s nature and then in the characteristic 
Hebrew manner he suddenly points his finger and asks how do you measure up 
to that nature? In doing this he tells us of the inevitable response of 
man when he comes to fear the Lord and know Him. 

The 'writer states that the people have become a twisted and crooked 
generation. They have turned away from the nature of the Father who 
created them. They are no longer sons because their character is not like 
their Father’s who fashioned them. 

For the Hebrew, man is to be complete in his action as God is complete 
in his. Man is to be steady, firm, a rock, a shelter and protection of 
other members of the human family as is the God who created him. Man is 
to be righteous and upright as his Father. He is to be straight and level 
in all his dealings not because it is good for society, or will benefit 
him, but because this is the response to the nature man has come to know 
through his religious experience (reverence and knowledge) of God. The 
whole ethic of life is based on God’s character. The Hebrew, if religious 
experience was genuine, saw men as little replicas or sons of the Father who 
created and fashioned them. The experience of God’s nature made obedient 


sons

"Harkening and obedience" is an Arabic saying which seems to sum up 
neatly the response of the Hebrew to his God. He harkens to God's nature 
and then turns and obeys that nature by trying to become as the nature itself. 
Rebellion is the exact opposite of obedience. We have already seen this 
in Isaiah 2:Iff. Here we see rebellion and the understanding and knowledge 
of God’s nature at opposite poles. ?/hen rebellion rules the personality 
then self deification results. A person who turns from the nature of God 
usually turns himself and therein finds his God and his ethic. Obedience 
means humility. It means always putting oneself second and God first. 

What is sin other than that? To put self first is to rebell against the 
very nature of God. The Hebrew realized that the experience of God's moral 
nature was the basis for moral obedience. True ethic must always be the 
response to God's character. Christian ethic is man’s response to the 
love of God revealed in Christ. 

Obedience comes from man's religious experience and is the result 
of rapport with the nature of God. This rapport affects the entire being 
producing conduct in harmony with the moral nature of the Holy One. 

Nowhere do we see this union with God more vividly than we do in Jeremiah 
when he said "His word 1 -was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my 
bones". Y/hen a man has experienced something of the divine nature in his 
life then it becomes like a burning fire shut up in his bones. He has to 
act in obedience to God's will. He has to take a firm stand, like Jeremiah 
who, because of his obedience was beaten and imprisoned and threatened with 
death. 

Obedience is action. One does not revere and know God without action. 

%ord 1 2T when used with God meant that something of his divine nature 
was present.

Isaiah, because of his religious experience, said, “Here am I send me". 
Religious experience does not result in arm chair piety. It is not pious 
frowning on certain vices nor is it the performance of a stated round of 
duties. A man who reveres and knows God is a man of positive action. The 
obedient man rings changes in a world that is out of tune with God, as the 
ancient prophets did when even in the midst of the most obscure and trying 
situations their words rang out "thus saith the Lord". 

Christ v/as in complete harmony with the nature of God. He knew 
and revered God as no other man, and we see his complete devotion and 
obedience as he goes to the cross. In an act of supreme obedience to the 
will of God he threw himself upon the wheel of time and it turned and 
turns and moves onward and his figure is hanged upon it still. Nineteen 
wide centuries have passed and this one obedient spirit, who because of his 
intimate personal relation with God, stcrods against what was wrong in 
society and became the centre piece of the human race. 

Life today is a thing to be bravely hazarded and freely given. 
Confident that obedience to God’s way of life is not misplaced. Confident 
that such devotion of our energies and our thoughts will not lead to genuine 
loss. 


2. Faithfulness and Stability 

We have seen how the Hebrews had come to know God as a trustworthy 
God.'*' He had revealed his trustworthiness in their deliverance from Egypt, 
in the covenant and indeed throughout their history. To come into

communion with such a God was to impart a faithfulness and stability into 
one’s own life. We see this in Psalm 40:1 where to be bound to God is to 
put ones life on solid and firm foundation. In Deut. 32:4 we saw how man 
through his relationship with God is to have such characteristics as 
trustworthiness and faithfulness. He is to live a steady and purposeful 
life - a more God-like life. 

Probably one of the finest examples of the life of faithfulness and 
stability through knowing and revering Him can be seen in the Hebrew prophets 
themselves. Even in the most trying times there was a faithfulness to God’s 
way and a stability in their lives that kept their faith ever flaming. 

Never was faith so supremely tried and never was it more splendidly vindicated 
might well be said of these men of God. 

Fear does not shake the foundations of the person who knows and fears 
God. To have experienced God is to banish fear. In Deut. 7:21 (M.T.) we 
read ”You must not stand in terror of them, for the Lord your God is in 
your midst, a God great and to be feared”-**. The fear of God casts out 
fear of men. Reverence for God extinguishes cowardice and terror of all 
things. 

To fear God is to have a strong weapon against the terror of men. 

We see the contrast in this verse in Deuteronomy. Here fear of men is 
expressed by the Hebrew word meaning to terrify, or cause to tremble, and 
fear of God is expressed by reverence. The New Testament says ’’perfect love 
casteth out fear” (1 John 4:18), but here we have reverence casting out fear. 
Churchill once said, ’’Fear God and nothing else”. Perfect confidence in 
God casts out all fear and brings to life a faithfulness and stability.

The Hebrew,through genuine religious experience, came to realize 
that his life had these characteristics. He was confident that there was 
with him and sustaining him the greatest power in the universe. Indeed 
the universe itself was behind him. With such an experience of God's 
nature the Hebrew walked with faithfulness and stability, confident that 
n He will guard the feet of his pious ones".(l Sam. 2:9). The wicked, 
who have cut themselves off from God, shall be cut off in darkness. The 
contrast is as the man who built his house upon the rock and the man who 
built upon the sand. 

There comes into a life which reveres and knows God something of the 
confidence and stableness of an old negro Christian. This old man always 
maintained a calm and serene attitude towards all of life's annoying 
experiences. He was approached one day by one of his white friends and 
asked why he could be so confident when many others all around him were 
disturbed. The old negro replied, "I formed the habit several years ago 
of saying to myself every morning when I got out of bed, 'Aint nothing going 
to come up today what me and the Lawd. can't handle'". 

Through experiencing God's nature there comes into one's life something 
of the faithfulness and stability that the late King George expressed in 
his message to his people on Christmas of nineteen thirty-nine. Those were 
dark days for England indeed, but the King's reassuring message was "Go 
out into the darkness and put your hand into the hand of God. That shall 
be to you better than a light and safer than a known way."-*-

3. Concern and Love for the H um an Family 

The knowledge of God shows man the good in life and puts on him the 
obligation to carry out that good in his dealings with men. In Jeremiah 
22:16 we read, “He defended the cause of the poor and the needy; .... Is 
that not how to know me? Is the oracle of the Lord. 11 To know God is to 
have concern for other members of the human family. 

The Hebrew, as we have already seen, sought through knowing God to 
become as Him. God was perfect—so they sought to bring their lives into 
perfection as His. God was a rock, a shelter and safety for men, so the 
Hebrew, by being as his God, was to be a shelter and safety to others. 
There must exist, however, something divine in man before he can begin to 
resemble the nature of his God. To the Hebrew, man was made in the image 
of God (Gen. 1:26). They had no statues or images in their temple to rep¬ 
resent their God. They believed that man himself v/as the true revelation 
of God. Man was the only true representation of the potency of God upon 
earth. He has a nature which bears genuine resemblance to the divine 
nature. The significance of this idea makes it one of the most momentous 
statements made in the Bible. This concept of man being made in the image 
of God is the basic thing underlying the idea of brotherhood. Under this 
concept, there is no distinction between the man of yellow, black, brown 
or white skin, for each is fashioned in the image of God which breaks down 
all barriers. This fact was accepted by the Hebrews but it did not strike 
a responsive cord in their lives until the Hebre-w sincerely came to know 
God. 

Is this then not the central fact about brotherhood? There is no 
use talking about brotherhood if it is to be merely a set of rules. You

can know the n golden rule” backwards and forwards and you can preach 
brotherhood until you are blue in the face, but you still have not brother¬ 
hood. If you see a Jew, or a communist, or a tramp, in the street and you 
are nice to him because someone told you to be nice to him, that again is 
not brotherhood. There are two ways of being together. One way is by 
being frozen together like two blocks of ice. The other, is by being 
melted together until one is indistinguishable from the other. Brother¬ 
hood is similar to the latter situation. 

The Bible says you cannot have brotherhood until you have fatherhood. 
There must be that intimate relationship as between father and son before 
there is brotherhood. Not until one knows God by coming into such communion 
with Him does one see Him as Father of all men. Clement of Alexandria once 
said, "If hast seen thy brother, thou hast seen God. ?l Our eyes must be 
directed toward God before we become genuine3.y concerned for others. Be¬ 
cause a man knows God he has concern and love for the human family. 

One loves his wife, his parents, his brothers and sisters—but how 
about the bum on the street, or the Korean Red who is shooting at your 
boy? No set of rules is going to make you love them. Yet if one believes 
that the image of God that lies within all men becomes fully realized, by- 
coming to know God, then he looks at people not for what they are in 
society right now but what, through knowing God, they might become. We 
must realize, that in every man there is something of the divine image from 
the most despicable person to the most noble and that this can be nur¬ 
tured until it blooms forth in all its beauty. 

As mentioned previously, the Hebrew stressed that man was to be 
perfect as his God was perfect. This was his basis for concern in other

men, Jesus realized this divine truth when he said, “So you are to be 
perfect as your Father is (Matthew 5:4B), Jesus took this old truth and 
then re-emphasized it with an extravagance. In the verses proceeding he 
relates what happens as a result of man being perfect as his father in 
heaven is. Man loves his enemies and prays for his persecutors. In the 
Parable of the Prodigal Son, Jesus brings a new tenderness and love to 
the concern for the human family. As God is benevolent, so man must be. 

Out* actions are not determined by man's actions to us. Our actions are 

determined by a higher obligation. As we have come to know God and have 

seen how He has dealt with us, so we turn and deal with others. One has 

to act as God has acted. We are sons of God and we must be like Him. 
Thus, when everything turns on the nature of God, actions towards other 
men are not bound up in legalistic ethical codes, but relation towards 
men becomes a vital dynamic thing going to extremes in concern and love 
for them.

CHAPTER V 

WISDOM AS A GIFT AND NOT AN ATTAINMENT 

Wisdom is the alliance with the designs of God, In our earlier 
discussion we saw how wisdom on a narrower plane was proficiency in carry¬ 
ing out human design. Then we saw how wisdom moved from this realm to the 
ultimate service of God’s appointed ends. To have wisdom in this sense 
was the Old Testament test of character. In this sense, too, even the 
lowliest person could be wise if he was committed to good as revealed by 
God. 

Wisdom involves the whole man committed to God’s standards. It is 
a thing of the heart, not only governing his inner life but all his actions 
actions which are consistent in that they always follow the straight path 
of God’s moral purposes. 

The Hebrew saw God as the central fact in all life. To come into 
the design of God, which was wisdom, was the pursuit of the Hebrew. Wisdom 
as the Hebrew saw it was not an intellectual wisdom but rather a striving 
to get things done as God desired. It was regarded as the most valuable 
of all human treasures and to be sought as such. Wisdom was the fountain 
of life (Prov. I6i22), and to get it required a diligent search. It was 
not easily attained. One had to incline his ear toward wisdom, and to seek 
it out as one would silver or a hidden treasure. Wisdom was to be sought 
in an unending powerful quest. 

It was, however, not to be found by man’s searching, indeed the 
quest was met with divine revelation. The Hebrew realized the eternal

truth that it is God who meets the questing spirit by bringing the inner 
life or heart of the seeking person near to Him. Man's staying devotion 
to wisdom is met by God who brings the heart of man near to Him. It is 
the heart that makes the difference between wisdom and folly. Out of a 
man's heart come the important issues of life for it is the heart near to 
God that brings fear of the Lord and knowledge of Him. 

The fear of the Lord and knowledge of God stand together as parts 
of the total experience of God. Together they stand as the beginning of 
wisdom. Life must be touched with a spirit of reverence for God and an 
intimate knowing of Him. To realize this is wisdom indeed, to miss this 
is to lose all. 

The man of pride, irreverence and brutish nature cannot attain 
wisdom. Total surrender to God is the result of knowing and revering 
Him. This is not a casting aside of human liberty, on the contrary to 
surrender to God is to be given the soaring life. Wisdom results in the 
realization of full self-hood. It becomes an intimate moral relationship 
with God which results in an obedience to His moral will. From this re¬ 
lationship with God there comes a faithfulness and stability into one's 
life. There comes, too, a wider outlook, an outlook that takes in all 
sorts and conditions of men. Into one's life comes a genuine concern 
and love for the human family. 

The experience of God, of which 'fear' and 'knowledge' are the 
Hebrew description, is not the end result of wisdom. Indeed they are 
only the beginning. With them comes the full realization that v/isdora 
cannot be attained through one's own strength. The attempt to bind oneself

to God takes up all the fibre and power of one*s personality and brings 
man to the realization that he cannot reach wisdom alone. 

Wisdom is unattainable. Is it denied to men? Is it a goal that 
cannot be reached? No, by no means. 1 When a man through fear and knowledge 
of God realizes his own inadequacy God takes the initiative and wisdom is 
given as a free gift. Wisdom is a gift and not an attainment. Wisdom is 
a divine gift, ”For the Lord gives Wisdom 11 (Prov. 2j6).
