INTRODUCTION 


A crop grown for seed must be harvested at the right 
stage of growth if the greatest possible seed yield is to be 
obtained. Thus, as high a percentage as possible of the 
seeds must have reached such a stage of growth at the time 
of cutting that they will later produce seedlings of high 
vitality. The danger of cutting too late must also be 
guarded against. While cutting too early will result in 
underdeveloped seed, seed left on the flower head for too 
long a period will result in shattering and a considerable 
loss in the seed yield per acre. Thus a record of the course 
of seed growth and the effect upon seed quality of premature 
harvesting should aid in determining the time at which a crop 
must be cut in order to obtain the maximum yield of seed and 
the optimum quality. A considerable amount of work has been 
carried out on the development of cereal seed but enquires 
into the growth of forage plant seeds have not been extensive. 

It was therefore decided to carry out experiments 
on the growth of timothy seed since it is a grass that has a 
very wide distribution and use. 






The aims of the investigation were as follows 


1. To study the growth of the seeds from 
pollination to maturity so that stages of seed growth could 
be defined* It was decided that the growth of the seed could 
be followed by observing changes in fresh weight, dry weight 
and water content* 

2* To harvest seeds at different stages of growth 
and to observe their germinating capacity, the incidence of 
dormancy and the vigour of seedling growth* 

3* To carry out such preliminary studies on the 
pollination and self-fertility as were necessary for under¬ 
taking the above projects*

REVIEW OP LITERATURE 


Hyde (1950) obtained white clover seed of known 
age some of which he used to determine the average weight 
and water content while the remainder was dried and kept for 
germination studies. He recognized three stages in the 
development of the seed, which from pollination to ripeness 
occupied about twenty-six days. These three stages were 
listed as growth, food, reserve accumulation and ripening. 

Hyde studied the effect on seed quality through 
harvesting at different stages of seed development, and. lists 
viability, seedling vigour and storage life as the aspects 
of most interest. The viability, obtained by him, was six 
and ninety percent respectively in seeds harvested' ten and 
fifteen days after flowering. 

He stated that vigour Is represented in speed, of 
germination, size of seedling, rate of seedling growth, and 
d.epth of the soil through which the seedling can emerge. 
Samples of seed which he harvested at different stages of 
development were scarified and placed in the incubator, the 
speed of germination increasing slightly with advancing age 
at harvest, ninety percent of the viable seeds germinating

in three and a half days for seed harvested twelve days after 
flowering and in two days for mature seed* 

Seed harvested twelve days after flowering gave 
seedlings, which after growing for six weeks in a greenhouse 
had approximately half the fresh weight of those from mature 
seedo Hyde believed that the most satisfactory indicator of 
maturity is seed weight and he recommended its use in Hew 
Zealand for judging seed quality* 

Whyte (1946) stated that growth denotes the increase 
in weight and volume of the plant at any particular stage, 
while development consists of certain stages followed in 
serial order, these stages being described by Lysenko (1935) 
as “qualitative 11 changes occurring in the plant, each of which 
must be traversed before seeding can take place* The complexes 
of external conditions necessary for the plant to pass 
through the developmental stages and those necessary for the 
growth of the plant at any particular developmental stage are 
often not identical, not only as regards the factors required 
but also as to their intensities* Consequently this distinction 
between the conditions required for growth and development 
make it possible to have conditions which lead to any of the 
following states; (a) rapid growth of the plants but slow 
development (b) slow growth and rapid development (c) rapid 
growth and rapid development•

Lysenko (1935) distinguished between the "morpho- 
logical 1 ’ changes occurring during plant development and 
the "qualitative” stages* The two may or may not coincide, 
thus some qualitative changes may be associated with 
morphological, though morphological changes do not necessarily 
imply qualitative stages* The stages require for their 
completion, a definite set of external factors such as temper¬ 
ature, light, humidity and aeration. Frequently, one factor 
may be insufficient to meet the requirements of a particular 
stage of development. Thus the thermoperiod and photoperiod 
have both been named with reference to their limiting factors. 
The application of vernalization attempts to provide arti¬ 
ficially those conditions necessary to excelerate the time 
required for maturity to be reached. 

Lysenko (1935), experimenting mainly with cereals, 
found that the processes Conditioning their sexual reproduction 
may occur not only in growing plants, but also in a seed with 
an embryo which has just commenced development but not broken 
the seed coat. This principle forms the basis of vernalization 
in which the thermo-stage is effected not in growing plants, 
but in seeds which have just begun their development. 

Hyde (1950) explained what meaning he attached to 
the terms maturity and ripeness. He stated that seed is 
mature when it has acquired its maximum dry weight.and that it 
is spoken of as being ripe when it has dried out to a moisture 




6 


content in equilibrium with the atmosphere. 

Regarding the relation of the stage of seed 
maturity to dormancy, Thompson (1935) found that immature 
lettuce seed gave a marked increase in germination following 
exposure to light but that mature seed showed little increase. 
He suggested that plant nutrition affects the number of 
flowers and seeds produced by individual plants which in 
turn is correlated with dormancy. Kearns and. Toole (1939) 
found that freshly harvested and immature seed of Festuba 
required a low temperature, but that as the seed aged it 
germinated over a wider range of temperature, Sprague (1936) 
made periodic samplings of immature seed corn and. found that 
normal germination did not occur until the moisture content 
had been reduced to 25 % or less. Timothy seed, according 
to Toole (1939), when freshly harvested was! partially 
dormant, and after-ripening occurred more rapidly in cut 
head.s than in threshed, seed. 

Whyte (1946 and 1948) reported that Gregory and 
Purvis (1938) obtained seeds of winter rye and winter wheats 
only five days after fertilization that were capable of 
germinating and ultimately producing perfectly normal plants. 
ITutman (1941) confirmed these observations of Gregory and 
Purvis (1938) with rye and similar ones made earlier by Harlan 
and Pope (1922 and 1926) ?/ith barley. 





7 


Whyte (1946) stated that an embryo which has not 
entered the dormant state may be as sensitive to 
vernalization as an embryo brought from the resting condition 
by soaking. He also reported that dormancy is characterized 
by a fall in the vital activity of the embryo to a minimum, 
and by a maximum increase in its insensitivity to environmental 
conditions. He reported that low temperatures are said to act 
only on ripening grain, which are in the milk-ripe or wax-ripe 
state and contain an active embryo. Capacity to react 
decreases as dormancy approaches. 

The Reports of the Special Committee on Standardized 
Tests (1943-4) show that in 1944 the Committee on Standardized 
Tests of the Association of Official Seed Analysts adopted 
the following definition of seed garminatioh: M In seed 
laboratory practice, germination is defined as the emergence 
and development from the seed embryo of those essential 
structures which for the kind of seed in question, are 
indicative of the ability to produce a normal plant tinder 
favourable conditions* 1 . This definition was also approved and 
adopted by the United States Department of Agriculture. Porter 
(1949) stated that botanically, a seed is a ripened, ovule, 
which implies a completely developed structure capable of 
reproducing its kind. 

Kains and McQuesten (1951) statedthat germination 
or sprouting is the resumption of growth by the dormant

embryo or young plant In the seed, it being complete when 
growth has ruptured the seed coats and the embryo has 
emerged* According to Hill et al. (1936) a seed has 
germinated when the radicle has emerged from the seed coat, 
but that germination is usually considered complete only 
when the seedling has become an independent plant. 

Barton and Crocker (1948) defined dormancy as a 
general term which may be applied to any condition which 
prevents germination when ordinary requirements of moisture 
and temperature have been met. They report that, as concerns 
seeds, it has been applied most often to the condition of the 
embryos or endosperms, or both, of many temperate-zone plants 
which will germinate only following a period of after¬ 
ripening in a moist medium at low temperature. Weaver and 
Clement (1929) stated that dormancy is usually more pronounced 
in seeds produced in late summer or autumn. 

Porter (1949) stated that environmental conditions 
which facilitate germination include soaking seeds prior to 
germination, alternate wetting and drying, coat-disintegrating 
action of soil agents, drying the seeds and alternating 
temperatures. He notes that the requirements for germination 
depend on age, storage temperature and humidity, response to 
light and oxygen, and that tap water sometimes contains 
chemicals that are injurious to germination. Shuck (1935) 
reported that repeated growth of batches of lettuce seeds on the

same filter paper leads to the accumulation of inhibiting 
substances on the paper that inhibit later sowings. 

Crocker (1948) believed that a period of dry storage 
may be quite as important a factor in after-ripening dormant 
seeds as is low-temperature stratification, since most seeds 
of cultivated grains and other grasses after-ripen in dry 
storage• 

Kains and McQuesten (1951) defined after-ripening 
as the term applied to the period between the maturity of 
the fruit of certain plants and the time when the seeds will 
germinate. After-ripening is defined by Barton and Crocker 
(1948) as a general term which embraces the changes v/hich take 
place inside the seed, making it ready to grow when planted 
in the ordinary manner. They report that these changes may 
involve actual growth and development of the embryo itself, 
and that they may^and usually do, include increasing acidity 
and altered enzyme activity within the tissues of the embryo. 
Crocker (1948) reported Barton (unpublished work) as having 
found that certain seeds that after-ripen in dry storage 
increase greatly in the initial rate of water absorption and 
somewhat in the final total amount held by them when fully 
imbibed as the dry storage period increases. 

Hill et al.(1936) defined stratification as the 
placing of seeds between layers of sand, sawdust, peat, or 
other material and keeping them moist and at a low temperature. 
They report that it has been found that many seeds can be 








10 


made to germinate if stratified at low temperatures, a 
temperature range of 0 to 10°G having been found the most 
effective for the majority of species studied. Kains and 
McQuesten (1951) and Crocker (1948) report that the Boyce 
Thompson Institute has proved mixing to be far better than 
stratification, though this term is still used for the new 
method. Crocker (1948) stated that a single period of moist 
low-temperature stratification by imitating nature 1 s methods 
of after-ripening seeds in the temperate zone causes some 
seeds with dormant embryos and some with non-dormant embryos 
to germinate. 

Porter (1949) believed that the most important of 
the factors concerned with the longevity of seeds are stage 
of maturity when harvested, viability, kind of seed (Including 
genetic factors), moisture content of the seed when stored, 
air temperature and humidity in the storage room, rate of 
water absorption or loss by the seed in storage, respiration 
rate of different temperatures and atmosphere in which the 
seed is stored. Lafferty (1931) reported that when seeds were 
stored in paper bags at room temperature, a small but gradual 
decrease in germination occurred the first few years, followed 
by rapid deterioration until all were dead. The number of 
years required for complete loss in vitality was nine for oats, 
meadow fescue and timothy, and fourteen for white clover. 
Boswell et al.(1940) found that a humidity between 45^ and 
50/o was a safe level for most kinds, of seeds.

Hollowell and Tysdal (1948) stated that the seed 
yields of legumes and grasses may be adversely affected by 
unadapted varieties, poor cultural and management practices, 
diseases, unfavourable weather, soils deficient in major or 
minor nutritive elements, harmful insects, lack of beneficial 
insects, and losses in harvesting. They believed that, in 
harvesting seed, time and method are the important factors^ 
and that the degree of shattering, length of blooming and 
seed-setting period, and the amount and conditions of growth 
differ widely among legumes and grasses.

MATERIALS 


Three clonal plants of both H. 77/30 Aberystwyth 
(pasture-hay type) and H. 62/26 Aberystwyth (hay type) were 
removed from a plot at Grasslands Division, Palmerston North 
on the 22nd November 1950. Each of these clonal plants were 
then divided into four sections. By this method, twelve 
clonal plants of each of the two types of timothy were 
procured. The reason for this procedure was to assure that all 
seed resulting from the cross-pollination between any two 
plants would be as similar as could be obtained under a crossing 
program. 


The twenty-four plants were put into eight inch 
pots which were then placed under a portico. The H. 77/30 
Aberystwyth clonal plants, although from a pasture-hay type, 
were more erect in their growth form than were the plants of 
H. 62/26 Aberyswyth which were from a hay type. The leaves of 
the plants of H. 62/26 were rougher than those of the plants 
of H. 77/30. After transplanting, the H. 62/26 plants required 
three days to return to their normal condition whereas the 
plants of H. 77/30 appeared unaffected by the divisioning and 
potting process. 


The plants of E. 77/30 Aberystwyth were marked A,

representing the clonal type and the plants of H. 62/26 were 
marked B. Each original plant was marked 1* 2 or 3 and the 
subdivisions of these plants were lettered a,b,c, or d. The 
plants were watered twice every day,once in the morning and 
once in the evening• On 8th December the plants were removed 
from the portico into an open cold frame. 

On 11th January 1951, when the spikes were almost 
ready to flower, the plants were transfered to a pollen-proof 
greenhouse with an earth floor^(See photograph on page 13). 

The next day the greenhouse was given tiro coats of white-wash 
in order to reduce the heat inside the greenhouse. Felt 
covers were placed over the three ventilating windows in order 
to prevent outside pollen from entering# A fan with four 
propellers (prongs) was situated in the side of the greenhouse 
thus helping to reduce the temperature within the greenhouse, 
and a felt cover was placed over the fan ventilating exit 
when the fan was not being operated. The door into the .green¬ 
house was kept shut and locked# 

The dimensions of the ventilating windows were as 
follows. One large window near the top of the wooden side of 
the greenhouse was 2 T 2 ,f in height and 5 ! 10 tf in length with a 
4-inch wooden partition in the centre. The two ventilating 
windows at the bottom of the opposite side of the greenhouse 
were each 1’ 8 {t in height and 2* 9 n in length. The ventilating 
exitj which contained the fan, had a diameter of 1* 4§ !t and was 






15 


situated between the two small windows. 

On 16th January four spikes of 'Clone A had florets 
which were in flower. Two of these spikes had one floret with, 
three stamens extended, one spike had two florets and one 
spike had four florets with stamens extended. On the same day 
plant Alb and Bib were taken to the seed testing laboratory 
at Palmerston North where floret counts were later carried 
out. The plants of Clone A were further advanced in development 
than were those of Clone B, the latter being unsatisfactory in 
the development of spikes. 

The spikes of each plant of Clone B were then placed in 
glazed semi-transparent glasslne... bags, cotton wool being 
bound around the stem below the spikes and string tied around 
the base of the gl as sine bag and against the cotton wool. 

In this manner the transfer of pollen between the plants of 
Clone A and Clone B was prevented. 

The intention had been to cross-pollinate the two 
clones and to carry out separate tests using the seed formed on 
each clone. owever, as a result of the unsatisfactory 
development of Clone B, it was only possible to carry out 
the tests with Clone A as the maternal clone, since it was 
correctly anticipated that there would be insufficient seed 
formed on the plants of Clone B with which to carry out tests. 

The spikes of done B were used merely as the paternal parent 
when cross-pollination was undertaken.

METHODS 


Flowering and Seed Setting 

As mentioned above, two plants in pots labelled 
Alb and Bib were handed over to the Seed Testing Station 
at Palmerston North so that an investigation into the flowering 
and seed setting habits could be undertaken. It was impossible 
for the writer to undertake these Investigations as well as 
the weight growth studies since they both had to be carried 
out at the same time. The officials at the Seed Testing 
Station therefore kindly undertook to obtain the information 
required* 


The two pots were kept in the greenhoiise on. the 
roof of the Seed Testing Station. Plant Alb had three heads 
tagged, each head being divided into four equal portions 
designated the Top, Upper Middle, Lower Middle and Lower. 

Two heads were similarly treated on plant Bib. The heads 
were examined daily from the start of flowering, the anthers 
being counted and removed both In the morning and the after¬ 
noon. When ripe, all the tagged heads were harvested and 
counts were made of the number of florets on the head and the

number of seeds set. 

Daily observations were recorded on the weather at 
the Seed Testing Station^(see Table H on page S6) 5 and on the 
temperature and humidity at Grasslands Divisionj(see Tables 
I and J on pages 67 and 68). 


Self-Sterility 

In order to determine the amount of self-fertility 
occurring within Clone A the plants of this clone were selfed 
and crossed among themselves. Thus one plant from A 1, A 2 
and A 3 was selfed, and one plant from each of them was crossed 
with one plant of another original plant. The procedure 
adopted was to bag two spikes of each plant on the 17th January 
and to count the number of seeds present when the glassine 
bags were removed on the 3rd April. Gith the selfed spikes 
two spikes of one plant were enclosed in a glassine bag, 
whereas with the crossed spikes two heads from each of two 
different clonal plants were enclosed in a bag. 

At the same time as the flowering and seed setting 
tests were being carried out, two heads on plant Alb and 
one head on plant Bib were tagged at the Seed Testing Station 
for self—sterility tests. They were each covered with 
glassine bags and when ripe, the heads were harvested and 
the seeds and the number of florets per head counted. 




18 


Growth 


(a) Pollination 

In order to obtain an accurate analysis of seed 
growth it was necessary to cross pollinate on one specific day. 
The timothy florets flowered at approximately 8 a.m., few 
florets flowering after 10 a.in. A count was not made at 
Grasslands Division to substanciate this statement which was 
based on observation alone. However, this statement was 
supported by the investigations on the two plants under 
observation at the Seed Testing Station (See Table I on page 
25). 

Prom the above remarks. It can be seen that the 
majority of seeds would start their grov/th, following 
pollination, at the same time even if stray pollen remained 
viable in the greenhouse after the main pollination was under¬ 
taken in the morning. 

Thus on the morning of the 29th January, which was 
anticipated to be the day when the maximum flowering would 
occur, the . glassine bags were removed from the plants of 
Clone B and the pollen from the spikes of these plants was 
shaken over the spikes of Clone A.

Since it had been considered that there would be 
insufficient pollen from Clone B to fertilize satisfactorily 
the florets of Clone A, spikes from the other plants of Clone 
B, which were outside in the plot, had been cut two days 
previous to the date when pollination was carried out* These 
heads had been kept in another greenhouse in a glass jar full 
of water* This procedure avoided the chance of pollen 
other than that of Clone B being introduced onto Clone A since 
pollen of other plants adhering to the spikes of Clone B, when 
they were removed from plot, would die within the two days of 
their being removed. 

On 29th January, the spikes of Clone B were removed 
from the other greenhouse and the pollen from these spikes 
as well as that of the plants of Clone B which had been grown 
in the greenhouse, were shaken over the heads of the plants of 
Clone A. 


(b) Dissection and Weighing 

Prior to cross-pollinating on 29th January three 
spikes were removed for the dissection and weighing of the 
unfertilized ovules. One thousand ovules were dissected, 
weighed, oven dried and weighed again. Only one of the 
thousand was found to have developed into a seed. Thus there 
was -a ppr-o^ .1$ self-fertility, which was a similar 





20 


percentage to those obtained later in the self-fertility 
trials• 

The ovules were dissected under a Reichert microscope 
at a magnification of 20X. Ten ovules were dissected at a 
time and were then placed in an aluminium dish and a metal 
cover placed over the dish in order to minimise the amount of 
evaporation occurring* After fifty ovules had been dissected 
and placed in the dish in this manner, the dish with fifty 
ovules in it was weighed on a Sartorius weighing scale* By 
subtracting the weight of the dish, which had previously been 
determined, from the total weight, the weight of the fifty 
ovules was obtained. This procedure was repeated* If an 
interval between dissections occurred the dish with its 
contents v/as placed with its lid off in a dessicator so as 
to evaporate the moisture in the ovules* When dissection 
was renewed the dish was removed from the dessicator and shortly 
afterwards re-weighed previous to the introduction of a fresh 
batch of ovules into the dish* 

After one thousand ovules had been dissected and 
weighed, the dish with the thousand seeds was placed in a 
vaccuum oven for five hours at 65°G in order to evaporate off 
the moisture in the ovules. The dish was then removed from 
the oven and placed in a dessicator for twenty minutes until 
it had cooled to room temperature. It was then removed and 
weighed. The ovules were immediately removed after the 
weighing and the dish was weighed with its lid. The difference

21 


In weight between the dish, lid and ovules, and the dish and 
lid, gave the total dry weight of the thousand ovules. 

A similar procedure was undertaken every two days 
thereafter the only alteration being that five hundred seeds 
were dissected and weighed two days and four days after 
pollination and that from six to sixty days two hundred and 
fifty seeds were dissected every two days* The reason for 
using the large number of ovules and seeds in the earlier 
stages of growth was to obtain a weight sufficient to 

obviate errors induced by small weights. 


Germination 


Every two days, that the weight growth tests were 
made, seed v/as retained for use in a germination test to be 
carried on later. Although the weight growth test was started 
on January 29th, the germination test did not start until 
April 9th at 5 P.M. 

Fifty seeds were prepared in envelopes representing 
each two days from January 29th to March 30th. A trial.shovm 
in Table F on page 64, was commenced on April 3rd. When it 
was apparent, after two days of the trial, that almost complete 






22 


germination was being obtained, on April 9th the main test was 
commenced • 


Thirty-one petrie dishes were collected and unprocessed 
cotton wool was placed in the bottom section of the dishes• 

A filter paper was placed on top of the cotton wool. On each 
filter paper was written the number of days from pollination 
to harvesting of the particular seeds to be placed in the 
petrie dish. Distilled water was then poured into each dish 
and the cotton wool and filter paper allowed to absorb' the 
moisture in such a manner that there was only a small surplus 
of water in the dish. 

When the above procedure was completed the fifty 
seeds for each of the thirty-one two day selections were placed 
in their individual petrie dishes on the filter papers as 
rapidly as possible in order that they would each start 
absorbing the v/ater at the same time. The covers to the petrie 
dishes were then placed on the petrie dishes and over the 
seeds. 

glass-topped 

The -petrie dishes were then placed in one * incubator, 
which was kept at 20°Centigrade and at a hundred percent 
humidity. 1‘he dishes lay on glass slabs which ran across a 
tank filled with water. 


At twenty-four hour intervals^after placing the seeds 
in the germinator^a count was made of the number of seeds

germinating in each dish* When the plumule and radicle was 
visible to the naked eye the seed was considered to have 
germinated. 


hffect of Chilling On Dormant Seeds 

Those seeds that did not germinate after forty-three 
days in the incubator were subjected to seven periods of 
chilling, ‘i'he first three, and the sixth and seventh, chilling 
treatments consisted of placing the ungerminated seeds in the 
refrigerator at 3°C for seven days and then replacing them in 
the incubator at 20°C for varying periods of time. Those 
seeds that did not germinate after the first chilling treatment 
were later subjected to a further treatment of chilling 
followed by incubation. The fourth chilling treatment was 
continued for nine days and the fifth for sixty-six days* 




Seedling Growth Jrom Chilled Seeds 


The seedlings developing from the chilled seeds 
were kept in petrie dishes in the incubator until their 
maximum growth had been obtained. They were then removed* 


and measured

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 


Flowering and Seed Setting 

(a.) Flowering 

The results obtained from the flowering counts are 
shorn in Table I on page 25. Figures* such as 23+1 on the 
2l/l* represent the morning count plus the afternoon count. 

Where only one figure is shown it represents a morning count. 

The morning counts were undertaken at 8 a.m. and the afternoon 
counts at 4 p.m. The counts showed that the maximum flowering 
took place in the early morning. 

It can be seen that flowering was abundant on certain 
days* but that between these popular days there were days 
when practically no flowering occurred. These popular flowering 
days were the same for each, of the three heads of plant Alb 
under investigation. However* by referring to the weather 
records shown in Tables E and I on pages 66 and 67 there 
appears to be no readily noticeable correlation between 
maximum flowering and maximum temperature. 






27 


The popular flowering days Of the heads of plant 
Bib under investigation did not occur on the same days as 
did those of plant Alb. An exception to this occurred on 
29th January when there were numerous flowers on the three 
A 1 b heads and also on one of the two B 1 b heads. The two 
heads of plant Bib had different popular flowering days 
between each other throughout their periods of flowering. 

Flowering continued on all four segments of all 
the tagged heads of both plants for an average of twelve and 
a half days. The minimum and maximum duration of flowering 
for any segment of any of the heads observed was 9 and 16 
days for plant Alb and 7 and 17 days for plant Bib. 

However, on every tagged head, the Top segment had the shortest 
duration of flowering, the minimum and maximum being 7 and 
11 days. 

The main purpose of the flowering test was to 
determine if there was any difference between the time of 
flowering of the different parts of the timothy head. The 
Analyses of Variance'' of the flowering counts for January 21, 
22, 25 and 29, 1951 are shown in Table A on page 58. abide59 # the 
differences between the flowering parts of the head not being 
significant on any of the dates in quiestion. 


* in all analyses of variance the following abbreviations are used: 

N.S. « not significant at the 5i level 

= significant at the level but not at the 1% level. 
® significant at the 1 % level.

(b) 5eed Setting 

When the tagged heads were ripe they were each 
harvested in four separate divisions, namely Top, Upper Middle, 
Lower Middle and Lower. Counts were then made of the number 
of florets and the number of seeds set in each division of 
each head. The results of these counts are shown in Table II 
on page 28. Included in this table is the total number of 
florets seen to flower' during the flowering test. The 
percentages of flowers' 1 " to florets, seed to florets and seed 
to flowers is also shown. The mal-formed and incomplete florets 
at the base and at the top of the head were not included in 
the sectioning or in the counting undertaken in these flowering 
and seed setting tests. 

The Analyses of Variance of the percentage seed to 
florets, flowers to florets and seed to flowers, all for the 
four positions of the timothy heads, are shorn below.

Hence, the Lower part of the heads gives significantly less

Lower Middle but does not differ significantly from the seed 
set of the Top.

Hence, there is no significant difference between the mean 
percentages of seed to flowers for the four positions on the 
heads• 


It can be seen from Table II on page 28 that the 
total average of the florets on the five timothy heads was 
1899, of which 868 flowered and 355 set seed. Thus the total 
percentages of flowers to florets, seed to florets and seed to 
flowers for plant Alb plus plant Bib was almost 46, 19 and 
41 percent respectively.

Self"Sterility 


The individual plants used in the selling and. 
crossing trials of Clone A and the results obtained are 
shown in Tables III and IV on page 32. 

Only three seeds were obtained from the six heads 
used in the self-pollination trial and no seeds were procured 
from any of the twelve heads used in the trial on cross¬ 
pollination within clonal plants. 

Table V on page 32 shows that, from the three 
heads tagged at the Seed Testing Station, three seeds were 
obtained and that this represented a seed set of .09 percent 
in relation to the florets present on the heads. 

It is thus assumed that any self-fertility likely 
to occur within Clone A would, not affect to any significant 
extent the results obtained, from the Growth or the Germination 
Experiment.

Growth 


The lists of the total and the average fresh 
weight, dry weight and water content and the percentage com¬ 
position of dry matter and water are shown in Table G on 
page 62. In Table B on page 60 is also shown the fresh 
weights for each, fifty seeds. Figure A on page 34 portrays 
the relative fresh weight, dry weight and water content of 
the seeds during their growth. 

(a) Fresh Weight 

The over-all seed weight increases comparatively 
slowly until the sixth.day, when an almost three fold increase 
over the fourth day occurs. After this the weight increase 
is rapid but in the form of gradually decreasing increments. 

On the thirty-fourth day the peak is reached at an average of 
.8128 milligrams per seed. From this day onward the fresh 
weight decreases in the form of an increasingly steep curve 
until the forty-second day is reached when a flattening of 
the curve occurs. On the forty-sixth day the minimum mature 
fresh seed weight is reached. 






36 


(b) Dry Weight 

The dry weight increases to the maximum average 
of o566 milligrams thirty-six days after pollination. After 
this time the weight remains approximately constant at 
.55 milligrams, although an inexplainable decrease occurs 
to .5188 milligrams on the forty-sixth day. 

(c) hater Content 

The water content of the seeds is obtained by 
subtracting the dry weight from the fresh weight. Thus the 
two curves described above have a direct bearing on the 
water content curve* 

The weight of the water content Increases slowly 
until the fourth day but increases considerably on the sixth 
and on the eighth day. On the tenth day there is an inexplain¬ 
able lag in the water increase. On the fourteenth day the 
approximate peak is reached at an average of .287 milligrams 
per seed and the curve levels off. An absolute peak occurs 
on the twenty-fourth day at .3016 milligrams per seed. From 
the twenty-fourth day a gradually increasingly steep descent 
occurs until the forty-second day when the curve flattens out, 
the approximate minimum being obtained after forty-eight days. 
An inexplainable jump occurs on the fifty- ourth day.

38 


Germination 

The first seeds to germinate was obtained from 
seedsremoved ten days after pollination (see Figure B on page 
37 and Tables S and F on pages 63 and 64). This seed was 
slow in germinating as the earliest germinated only after 
four days in the incubator and developed into weak seedlings. 

It was observed that the allowance of an increased number of 
days from pollination to the harvesting of the seed resulted 
in a stronger seedling. This is bom out by measurements made 
later on the length of seedlings germinating after the 
application of a period or periods of chilling, (See Table G 
on page 65). 

The germination after twelve days in the incubator 
jumped from ten percent for seed removed ten days after 
pollination to seventy percent for seed removed twelve days 
after pollination. Seed removed eighteen days after pollination 
gave eighty-six percent germination after five days in the 
incubator. 


Seed harvested twenty-two days or m.ore after 
pollination never gave a lower termination percentage than 
ninety-four after six days in the incubator. Only one of these 
seeds germinated between the eighth day of incubation, and the 
commencement of the chilling experiment. 






39 


No seeds germinated within twenty-four hours of 
being placed in the incubator, but seed removed sixteen days 
after pollination gave thirty percent germination after two 
days. Seed removed twenty-two.-days after pollination gave 
seventy-four percent germination after two days incubation. 

Seed allowed less than thirty-six days between 
pollination and harvest gave a maximum germination of eighty- 
two percent after two days in the incubator. Ho?/ever, an 
interval of thirty-six days gave ninety-six percent germination 
after two days incubation and only two seeds removed at periods 
greater than this did not germinate ?/ithin two days. 

Golumns 3 and 4, in Table I ? on page 64, show the 
seeds that germinated to?/ard the end of the forty-three days 
of incubation. These seeds were all very feeble in their 
growth.

Effect of Chilling on Dormant Seeds 

Since no seed removed twenty-two days and longer 
after pollination gave a lower percentage of germination 
than ninety-four after six days incubation, the effect of 
chilling upon the ungerminated seed referred chiefly to 
seed which had been harvested less than twenty-two days after 
pollination. 

Seed removed on the tenth day after pollination 
produced only ten percent viable seed either before or 
after the application of periods of chilling. The unviable 
seeds were soft and yellow in appearance. 

The effect of chilling is shown in Tables VI and P 
on pages 40 and 64. It can be seen In Table VI, that, of the 
twenty-eight seeds which remained firm but did not germinate 
previous to chilling, 42.9 percent became viable after the 
first period of chilling and that over two-thirds became 
viable after five periods of chilling. Only one seed that 
germinated after the chilling treatments remained very feeble. 
This seed had been removed twelve days after pollination and 
germinated. follov/ing the second period of chilling. In Table 
P, the grand total of seeds germinating shows that at least 
80 percent of the seeds removed twelve days or more after 
pollination eventually germinated.

Seedling C-rowth F r om Chilled Seeds 

While the number of seedling used in this measure¬ 
ment test had of necessity to be small, nevertheless, the 
length of the seedlingsfor any particular number of days after 
pollination was in all cases approximately the same* In no 
instance did the length of a seedling from a particular day's 
harvest exceed the length of a seedling which had been allowed 
a longer period to develop after pollination had occurred. (See 
Figure C and Table G on pages 42 and 65). 

The Analyses of Variance, by which shoot lengths at 
twelve and fourteen days, and fourteen and eighteen days are 
compared, are shorn below. (The data used are the results from 
the First and Second chilling).

The statistical analyses show that for the 
results of the first two chillings, there was a highly signi¬ 
ficant difference between the mean lengths of the seedlings 
from seeds harvested at twelve days and at fourteen days after 
pollination and also between those harvested at fourteen days 
and eighteen days# 





45 


CONCLUSION 


Under natural conditions in the field environmental 
influences would be considerably different to those existing 
in a greenhouse, which contained only two different timothy 
clones* In the greenhouse, pollination was carried out by 
shaking the heads of the two clones together whereas under field 
conditions, pollination would take place through the medium of 
the wind* Many ecological factors, such as temperature, 
humidity arid precipitation, would be such that entirely 
different results might be obtained under field conditions* 

Flowering took place over approximately tviro weeks 
within which days of heavy or light flowering occurred. Of 
the total number of florets, less than half flowered, and of 
the flowering florets, approximately forty percent set seed. 

The timothy plants under observation showed almost complete 
self-sterility. 

The growth of timothy seed until the fourteenth day 
was mainly the result of moisture increase. From this interval 
of time until the thirty-sixth day, the dry weight continued to 
increase whereas the increase in water content slowed down to 
such an extent that by the twenty-eighth day It had started to 
drop. Both the increase and decrease of the water content 
was rapid whereas the dry weight increased more 







slowly but for a longer period. After the thirty-sixth day 
the dry weight remained approximately stationary. However, 
as a percentage of the fresh weight, the dry weight increased 
from approximately thirty-four percent during the first twelve 
days of growth until it reached over ninety-one percent fifty- 
eight days after pollination. 

Since all the seeds tested were placed in the 
incubator at the same time, the seeds harvested in the 
earlier stages of growth had up to two months longer than the 
last seeds harvested to overcome any after-harvest dormancy 
which they might have possessed. This could affect the 
results of germination capacity obtained, from the earlier 
harvested seeds. 

It would appear that in order to obtain high- 
germination, timothy seed should be allowed twenty-two days 
from pollination to harvest* However, in an emergency 
harvesting could be carried, out only twelve days after 
pollination and this might result in as high as seventy percent 
germination under favourable conditions. Eight days of 
incubation appears to be the period that is required to test 
the germinating capacity of seed harvested twenty-two days or 
longer after pollination, although six days incubation might 
be a sufficient duration. The incidence of dormancy after 
twelve days incubation was very low, occurring 




47 


mainly in seed harvested twenty or less days after pollination. 

The test on the chilling of timothy seed was not 
extensive since it included only those few seeds that had not 
germinated during forty-three days incubation, but it is 
apparent that immature timothy seed is affected in its 
germinating capacity by chilling. 

Although the seeds germinating toward the end of 
the forty-three days incubation were very feeble in their 
growth, all except one that germinated after one or more 
periods of chilling were normal and vigorous in their growth. 

It had been observed during the main germination 
test, that there was a steady increase in the Initial vitality 
of the seedlings corresponding to an Increase in the times 
allowed for seed growth after pollination. This was 
substantiated by the observations on the seedling growth of 
chilled timothy seed. The viability and initial vitality 
of the timothy seed during its period of growth after polli¬ 
nation appear to be correlated. 

It is probable that seed size, speed of germination 
and seedling vigour will all improve as growth progresses up 
to the stage of full maturity, which, in these experiments, 
appeared to occur on the thirty-sixth day*

SUMMARY 


1. Records were obtained of the order and 
duration of -flowering of florets on different segments of the 
timothy flower heads, of the number of florets per head and 
per segment and of the number of seeds set per head and per 
segment . 


The differences between the time of flowering of 
segments of the timothy heads were not significant* The Lower 
part of the head gave significantly less seed set per floret 
than either the Upper Middle or the Lower Middle but did not 
differ significantly from the seed set of the Top segment. 

The percentages of flowers to florets in the two Middle 
segments of the head were significantly greater than the 
percentage in the Lower segment, and almost significantly 
greater than in the Top segment. There was no significant 
difference between the mean percentages of seed to flowers 
for the four positions on the heads* Of the total florets 
present, less than half flowered and of the flowering florets, 
approximately forty percent set seed. 

2m Three trials were carried out to determine the 
degree of self-sterility occurring within clonal plants of 











































49 


timothy. These self-sterility trials showed that less than 
•1 percent of the timothy florets set seed following selfing. 

3. The increase in weight of the timothy seeds 
following fertilization was determined. The fertilization 
was undertaken manually in bulk on one specific day and seed 
v/as removed every two days thereafter at which, time the seeds 
were dissected and weighed to obtain their fresh and dry 
weights and thereby their water content. 

The growth of the seed increased mainly by means 
of moisture increase until the fourteenth day when the water 
content levelled off. After this period, the dry weight 
content continued to increase and it was this factor which 
was responsible for an increase in the over-all fresh weight. 
The water content started to drop on the twenty-eighth day 
but the increase in the dr 3 r weight was sufficient to maintain 
an increase in the fresh weight until the thirty-sixth day 
when the decreasing v/ater content lowered the fresh weight. 

It was on this day that the dry weight had reached its peak 
and henceforth remained at this approximate weight. 

4* Seed heads were retained every two days during 
the growth experiment for use in a later experiment that was 
undertaken to determine the germination capacity of seed at 
two-day intervals during growth.

The average dry weight of seeds harvested twenty- 
two days after pollination was found to be .404 milligrams 
whereas the maximum dry weighty on the thirty-sixth day after 
pollination.was .566 milligrams. This represents an increase 
of forty percent. However, on the twenty-second day after 
pollination and after only five days in the incubator, ninety- 
six percent of the seeds germinated. Thus a very high 
percentage of the seeds germinated rapidly, although they had 
not remained on the timothy plant for sufficient time to 
obtain their maximum dry weight. 

5. The timothy seeds that did not germinate 
within forty-three days were subjected to periods of seven 
days of chilling.in order to determine the effect of chilling 
upon germination. In the intervals between these chilling 
periods the seeds were replaced in the incubator. 

Of the seeds that had been removed twelve days and 
more after pollination, and had not yet germinated after forty- 
three days in the incubator, thirty-three were soft unviable 
seeds and twenty-eight were firm seeds. Prom the latter, over 
two-thirds germinated after one to five periods of chilling at 
3°C. 


6. The timothy seedlings developing from chilled 
seeds were measured at their maximum growth in the incubator 
in order to ascertain if there was any difference in the initial 






51 


vitality of seedlings developing from seed having different 
periods of growth before harvesting* 

An increase in the length of seedling was found to 
correspond with an increase in the length of time between 
pollination and harvesting*

RECORD OF RELATIVE HULIDITY 

Conditions in the Timothy Greenhouse 
at Grasslands Division 

The relative humidity fell rapidly each day from a 
maximum of 83 % to 90 % during the night and early morning to a 
minimum of 42 % to 60 % at approximately 3 P.i... From 3 P.M. 
until 10 P.M. there was a rapid increase in the relative 
humidity, although this increase was not as rapid as was the 
decrease in the morning. From 10 P.M. until 8 A.M. or 10 A.M. 
the humidity remained approximately the same. The maximum 
varied only 7 degrees between March 22 and 29, but the 
minimum varied by 18 degrees.

A record of the Relative Humidity was recorded for only one 
week because the hygrograph was mainly used by the writer in 
another greenhouse on an experiment with Montgomeryshire Red 
Clover that was being carried out concurrently-with the 
Timothy experiment•
