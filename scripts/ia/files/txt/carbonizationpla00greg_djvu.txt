I. INTRODUCTION 

This thesis deals with the development, in 
tne laboratories of the Researcn Council of Alberta, 
of a low-temperature-carbonization plant for the 
treatment or Alberta subbituminous coals to produce 
a char which can be briquetted to give, relatively to 
the coal used, a high-grade solid fuel suitable for 
transport to and marketing in Eastern Canada. 






















A. Na ture or Coals In the Province of Alberta. 

Coal-bearing beds in Aloerta occur in three 
different geological formations namely, the Edmonton, 
the Belly River, and tne Blairmore-Kootenay. 11) Tne 
first two formations are of Upper Cretaceous and the third 
of Lower Cretaceous age* The Blairmore-Kootenay coals of 
Loxfer Cretaceous age are more mature than the Belly River 
or Edmonton coals of Upper Cretaceous age* The degree of 
maturity, however, appears to have been dependent more on 
the pressure to which the coal oeds have been subjected 
than upon the geological age of the deposits. Speaking 
generally,the rank of Alberta coals increases from east to 
west, that is, from the plains to the foothills and mountains, 
the mountain Duilding forces which resulted in the formation 
of the Rocky Mountain barrier apparently being the effective 
agents in the maturing of the coals. 

. The Research Council of Alberta has divided the 
Province into districts known as coal areas. These are shown 
in a key map on Plate I. The coals of Alberta are also 
divided for convenience into five broad groups, each containing 
coals of the same general character and used for the same 
purposes. These groupings are also shown on Plate I. The 
characteristics, occurrence and analyses of the coals of tne 
different groupings are given below. Cl) 

Uroup I - Loxf volatile, non-coking coal from mountain areas; 
commonly called steam coal.

Goals of this type have good storage properties, 
resisting weathering and burn with a short, slightly smoky 
flame. These coals are used for railways and for steam 
raising in general. When briquetted they find a market for 
domestic heating. 

Important areas where this type of coal is mined 
are Cascade, highwood and Nordegg. 

Group II - High Volatile, coking bituminous coal from mountain 
areas; also commonly called steam coal. 

This class of coal has also good storage properties, 
is weather-resisting but burns with a medium to long, smoky 
flame. Coals of this class are used for railways and for 
steam raising in general, for the manufacture of coke, as 
smithy coal, and in the manufacture of cement. 

Group III - High volatile, non-coking coal, principally from 
foothills areas, with good storage and weather-resistant 
properties. Coals of this type are non-coking and burn freely 
with a long, slightly smoky flame. They are for domestic and 
for steam raising purposes. In general, they withstand hand¬ 
ling and transport well and can be shipped and stored satis¬ 
factorily for a considerable period x^itnout marked deterior¬ 
ation to size and properties. 

Important areas in which coals of this group are 
mined are Goalspur, Lethbridge, Prairie Greek and Saunders, 
Group IV - A so-calJed domestic coal with fair storage 
properties mined in prairie areas. 

With care, this class of coal can be stored under 











- 3 - 


cover. It is a free-burning, non-coking type which ignites 
easily and burns with a long, smokeless flame. The principal 
uses are for domestic heating and steam raising. It can be 
shipped in box cars without undue breakage. 

Important areas in which coals in this group are 
mined are Garoon, Drumneller, hdmonton, Pembina and Taber. 
Group V - A so-called domestic coal with poor storage proper¬ 
ties mined in prairie areas. 

This class of coal will not store well. It is a 
free-burning, non-coking type of coal, igniting easily and 
burning with a long smokeless flame. As with coals in Group 
IV the principal uses are for domestic heating and steam 
raising. 

Important areas in which coals within this group 
are mined are Camrose, Castor, Sheerness and Tofield. 

Table I gives typical analysis for the various 
groups of coals enumerated but it must be understood that 
since each group comprises a wide range of coals the analysis 
given for any one group is merely typical. The analysis of 
a particular coal within one group may thus differ somewhat 
from the analysis given below as representative of that group.

B. Classification of Alberta Coal s 

Since 19 3&, coal in Canaaa has been classified according 
to tne system used by the American Society for Testing Materials. 
This classification seeks to define broadly the stage in the 
metamorpnosis of the original piano material from lignite 
towards anthracite* Tnis stage is known as rank, the less mature 
coals being termed low rank coals and the more mature coals 
high rank coals. 

In tne classification according to rank, as shown in 
Table II (lj nigh rank coais are characterized primarily by 
tne percentage of fixed carbon in the dry, mineral-matter 
free coal; whilst lower rank coals are characterized by the 
neat value or the moist, mineral-matter-free coal, that is 
to say with coal containing that amount of moisture which 
the mineral-matter-free coal might be considered to contain 
in tne seam. Secondary distinctions are made according as 
























to whether the coal is agglomerating, that is forms a firm button 
of coke when the coal is carbonized under standard conditions 
as m the volatile matter test, and according as to whether 
the coal is weather resistant as indicated by the extent of 
its disintegration in an accelerated weathering test.

5 , There are three varieties of coal in the high volatile 0 
bituminous coal group, namely, 

Variety 1, agglomerating and non-weathering 
Variety 2, agglomerating ana weathering 
Variety 3> non-agglomerating and non-weathering 


In addition to the A.S.I.M. classification and the 
five groupings enumerated a system of classification according 
to common usage has been adopted in AloertaA 2) Table III 
gives all three methods of subdivision and indicates the 
extent to which they agree, disagree and overlap.

D. Consumption of Alb e rta Coal 

The consumption of Alberta coal for the period 
1924 to 1944 inclusive is shown in Figure I. (2) The railways, 
utilizing bituminous coals are by far the largest consumers. 
Consumption of Alberta coal within the Province, except for 
the period 1929 to 1940, the depression years, has remained 
in the neighborhood of 1.5 million tons per annum. Saskatchewan 
has consumed about an equal amount of Alberta coal but during 
the past few years the curve for Saskatchewan consumption has 
fallen away from that for Alberta and will probably continue 
to do so as the production in Saskatchewan increases. For the 
past 20 years, Manitoba’s consumption of Alberta coal has 
fluctuated slightly but generally speaking it is about one-half 
million tons per annum. Consumption will probably not change

appreciably unless there is some unforeseen alteration of 
conditions in the Province. The curve for the consumption 
of Alberta coal by British Columbia rose rapidly after the 
outbreak of war. During the war period,coal distribution 
was centrally directed and western supplies of coal for eastern 
markets were directed to markets in the west. After a period 
of post war adjustment, consumption by British Columbia may 
be expected to rise. 

Ontario showed a small but steadily-increasing 
consumption of Alberta coal until 19^2 and consumption would 
undoubtedly have increased still further but for the re¬ 
direction of shipments ordered in 19^3 as a war measure. 

Because of its large population and the relatively high 
concentration of industry in Ontario, consumption in this 
Province of both industrial and domestic coal is very sub¬ 
stantial. Over half of Ontario 1 s requirements, however, 
amounting in 194-1 to more than 14- million tons is imported 
from the United States. 

Ontario, therefore, is potentially the largest 
market for Alberta coals. Considered Taoadly, the industrial 
needs of Ontario can be met by the supply of bituminous coals 
whereas domestic needs might reasonably be satisfied with 
supply of subbituminous coal or of solid fuels manufactured, 
from them. 

The investigation to be described in this thesis 
is concerned with the production from Alberta subbituminous 
coals of a solid fuel which would meet the requirements of 
the domestic coal market in Ontario in particular and Eastern 
Canada in general.

E. Occurrence and Resources of Alberta SubPituminous Coals 

T ne subbituminous and lignitic coals of G-roups 
IV and V occur in 30 of the 50 coal areas already named. 

From Table IV it will be seen that these areas are responsible 
for J(% of the total coal production of the province. 

These coal areas lie as a band through the middle 
of the province as is shown in Plate I. The largest producing 
centres are Drumheller, Edmonton ana Tolleld; the Lethbridge 
area is excluded because the coals in this field are in 
general more mature than those mentioned in the former areas. 

Although the known reserves of bituminous coals 
are much larger than those of the subbituminous and lignitic 
types, production of bituminous coals in mountainous regions 
is limited to those areas which are serviced by railroads. 

This perhaps is one of the main reasons why the coal produc¬ 
tion in the subbituminous areas as a percentage of the total 
reserves in these areas is greater than the comparable figure 
for the mountain regions. The prairie coal seams in the 
regions lie under relatively shallow cover and in contrast 
with the sharply folding and steeply pitching seams in the 
mountain regions, they occur in beds which have not been 
greatly disturbed. In certain areas the seams may be worked 
by open-strip mining, but elsewhere the seams are worked 
from portals or shallow shafts or by means of fairly gentle 
inclines.

F* Characteristics of SubDltumlnous Coals { 3) 

The subbituminous coals are characterized by the 

following properties: 

1. As they occur naturally they contain a large amount of 
water. The moisture varies from about 12.7 per cent, 
in the Champion Area to about 29.6 per cent, in the 
Sexsmith Area. On losing moisture by air-drying the 
coals usually disintegrate, either crumbling to a powder 
or developing well-marked, laminar cracks. 

2. They are non-coking. 

3. In general, the ash fuses at a relatively low temperature. 

4. On the dry, ash-free basis, they contain more oxygen and 
lees carbon than any of the bituminous coals. 

5. Their high oxygen and moisture contents, which of course 
infer low calorific values, account for the relatively 
low flame temperatures ana. calorific intensifies which will 
be developed when these coals are burned. 

6 . Borne typical analyses are:

G-. Economic Factors Affecting the Marketing and Utilization 

of Alberta Subbltuminous Coals" in ffasterhdTanada. 

A number of economic factors are involved in the 
marketing of the subbituminous coals of Alberta in Eastern 
Canada. 

Since 1933> the freight rate for Alberta coal 
from any place in Alberta to all points in Ontario has been 
set at the flat rate of $5.00 per ton. ( 2) The Dominion 
Government contributes a flat subvention rate of $ 2.50 per 
ton so that a net freight rate of $ 5*50 per ton has to be 
provided for in marketing. 

The I 2.50 per ton subvention rate is not a long 
term arrangement but is renewed yearly and can be withdrawn 
oy the Dominion G-overnment at any time. This situation nas 
naturally a very detrimental effect on the movement of 
western coal to Ontario, The coal dealers in Ontario 
hesitate to discontinue relations with American coal operators 
with a v5ew to handling Alberta coal in case the subvention 
is withdrawn. For the same reason the operators of Western 
Canada are reluctant to promote sales by extensive advertising 
of their products in Ontario. 

In the case of coals imported from the United 
States, the distances encountered are much shorter and here 
the freight rate varies with the length of haulage. The 
lowest price for American coals occurs at the cities on the 
north shore of the (Great Lakes. Inland areas, however, 
must bear the ada.ed cost of railway shipping charges.

* The higher cost of Alberta coal in Timmins is due to a 
larger profit margin to the dealers in that city. 

It will be seen that the price of Drumhelier coal 

in Toronto was $2.35 less than the price of U.S. Anthracite 

and 15 ^ more than tne price of Pocahontas coal. The margin 
increases in favor of Aloerta coal as tne distance inland 
from Toronto increases. The price of Drumhelier furnace 
lump coal at the mine in 1943 was S4.65 P er ton. With a 
net freight rate of $ 5 * 5 ° and a dealers gross margin of $ 3*00 
the price of this coal to the consumer came to $ 13 * 15 » 

From a competitive standpoint it is also necessary 

to compare tne analyses of the imported American coal and 
Alberta Domestic coal. Table VII gives a comparison of 
tne proximate analysis, the calorific values and the price 
per therm of these coals.

It must, however, be pointed out that the price 
per therm is not necessarily an exclusive measure of value. 

In fact, it is a minor issue with the average householder. 

The features sought for in a domestic fuel are, in general, 
a minimum of smoke produced on burning, cleanliness in handling, 
low ash content and ease of initiation of combustion. The 
Alberta subDituminous coals have these features and it is 
for these reasons that for domestic heating they may be 
preferred to both Alberta and American bituminous coals. 

However, in spite of these merits of Alberta 
subDituminous coals for domestic purposes, their high freight 
rates per therm and their poor storing and shipping prop¬ 
erties present serious disadvantages to long distance 
shipping. This situation has led the Research Council of

Alberta to consider the possibility of converting these 
coals by carbonizing then and then briquetting the 
resultant char with a suitable binder into fuels of a 
convenient size, with good, storage properties ancl having 
a more concentrated heat value. 

It should be mentioned that a situation exists 
particularly in the Drumheller area which has an important 
bearing on the above situation. In that field about l4 
per cent, of the total coal produced is in the form of 
slack coal, that is, generally spesiting, below 3/& ~ 3/^ 
inch mesh size. At present a certain amount of the slack 
coal is disposed of to various power plants. Should these 
power plants, however, convert their installations to gas 
firing the market for this class of material will become 
yet more restricted. The Alberts. Subbituminous Coal 
Association indicated that the market for briquettes is 
very favorable.

II. History of the Development of Low Temperature 
Carbonization P rocesses for Treating Li gni tes 

Certain of the so-called subbituminous coals 
occurring in the Upper Cretaceous formation of Alberta 
have been regarded by investigators elsewhere as well- 
matured, laminated, black lignites which may contain in 
the raw state up to 25 per cent, water. The large amounts 
of water in the raw coals greatly limits their value as 
fuels and common practice, especially in Germany, with 
coals of this kind has been to dry them by means of hot 
comoustion gases, steam or even hot air and then to 
briquette the dried material or to use it directly for 
steam raising. The heat available in the dry lignites 
can be substantially increased further by moderate heat 
treatment of the coal up to a temperature of between 300 ° 
and 400° C.,at which temperature oils are first produced. 

. Investigations by Bone and his collaborators (3) 
on the heat treatment of coals of this kind shows that by 
heating up to a temperature of between 275° 0* and - 375° 0* 
results in the removal not only of a considerable proportion 
of oxygen as steam but also of a very large amount of 
oxygen as carbon dioxide in the gases which are produced 
at these temperatures. It will be seen that the percentage 
of carbon dioxide in the gases evolved ranges from 70 to 
as much as 93 per cent, and that the weight of the gas is 
approximately four to seven per cent, of the coal substance.

It snould be noted that these quantities refer to the 
dry coal substance exclusive or extractable matter in the 
form of wax, etc. The composition of the gases evolved 
up to this temperature, and at higher temperatures from 
coals of this kind are indicated in Table VIII.

From the above table and from Figures II and III 
it will be seen that 600° C. is a temperature below which the 
gases contain a preponderance of carbon dioxide, a moderate 
proportion of carbon monoxide, a relatively small amount of 
hydrogen and. a fairly large percentage of unsaturated and 
paraffin hydrocarbons. This temperature, however, is one at 
which carbonization can be carried out on an industrial scale. 
Generally speaking, at temperatures of the order of 400°C., 
considerable practical difficulties arise which are not encounter¬ 
ed at the higher temperature. It might thus he found economical 

« 

not simply to dry such coals in the conventional way, hut, 
in addition, to remove a large proportion of the oxygen at the 
expense of a certain proportion of the original available heat 
in order to produce a solid product in which the available 
heat is concentrated. Such a treatment appears to he the

conception underlying the work of the Lignite Utilization 
Board of Canada in its attempt to design a low-temperature 
carbonization plant suitable for the treatment of Canadian 
subbituminous coals. 

Comparable data are given by Stansfield (6) and 
his colleagues relative to the stepwise carbonization of 
a sample of Black Diamond coal, an Alberta type C sub- 
bituminous coal mined in the Clover Bar district of the 
Edmonton coal area.

The above results are depicted graphically 

in Figure IV 

Comparison of this Figure with Figure 

II shows that: 


1. Up to a temperature of 110°C* the increase in the 
calorific value is the result essentially of the 
loss of water only. 

2. Judging by Figure II, up to 300°C, the increase in 
calorific value apart from the further loss of water, 
is. due principally to the large amount of oxides of 
carbon which are evolved at temperatures of the 
order of 400°C. It should be noted, however, that 
over this temperature range there is a considerable 
loss of heat due to the evolution of quantities of 
unsaturated hydrocarbons.

3. Table X shows that 600°C. is an optimum carbonization 
temperature if a char of the maximum heating value is 
to be obtained* Prom Figure II it will be seen also 
that with immature coals of this nature, when a carbon¬ 
ization temperature of 600 °G. has been attained, the 
bulk of the carbon dioxide has been evolved. At higher 
temperatures considerable amount s of carbon monoxide 
are evolved together with some quantities of paraffin 
hydrocarbons but the major loss above 600 ° 0 . appears to 
be due to a fairly copious evolution of hydrogen* This 
occurrence accounts for the calorific value of the char 
diminishing slightly only when carbonization temper¬ 
atures of 600 °C. are exceeded. 

Whilst these results bring out clearly that the 
optimum temper at lore of carbonization for obtaining a char 
having a maximum calorific value is approximately 600 °Q., 
other important considerations arise, of course, if such a 
carbonization treatment of lignites or subbituminous coals 
is to be carried out on an industrial scale. It might, 
for example, be found more advantageous to increase the 
yield of the product at the expense of producing a char 
with a calorific value somewhat below the maximum value, 
if of course such was economically feasible. Moreover, the 
actual throughput of a plant, provided a reasonably satis¬ 
factory product is obtained is, of course, an over-riding 
consideration in plant operation.

coals, at temperatures of tJae order of 600°C. on a large 
scale has been attempted on numerous occasions but few of the 
plants which have been designed and operated have been found 
to work satisfactorily. Carbonization up to temperatures of 
about 600 °C. is commonly spoken of as low-temperature carbon¬ 
ization, in contrast to high-temperature carbonization which 
refers to temperatures generally speaking above 1,000°C. 

In 1919 1 the Lignite Utilization Board ( 7), after surveying 
the plants then available for the low-temperature carboniz¬ 
ation of materials such as lignites and subbituminous coals, 
arrived at the conclusion that no plant then existent was 
entirely suitable for the purpose. 

Accordingly, after several tentative designs for 
a suitable retort had been considered by the Board, a design 
by Stansfield ( 7 ) was adopted and a small-scale experimental 
retort was erected in Ottawa and put into operation. The 
retort was designed to treat dried lignite and lignite con¬ 
taining a considerable proportion of slack could be treated 
satisfactorily. The design provided for the recovery of 
oy-products, but owing to the retort not being air-tight, 
the gas had to be allowed to escs.pe into the atmosphere and 
city gas was used to heat the retort. Later the design of 
this retort was modified, particularly with regard to the 
method of removing the gas and tne tar vapours. Also the 
base of the retort was reconstructed, carborundum replacing 
the refactory tiles which had been employed earlier. The 
final design of the retort is shown in Figure V.

As a result of tests carried out with this plant 
it was concluded that basically the plant was Doth workable 
and satisfactory. The parti ally-drled lignite could be carbon¬ 
ized to any desired extent. It will be noted that the steady 
flow of material through the retort was controlled simply by 
the speed of rotation of a discharge mechanism operating at 
the bottom of the retort, and that apparently no particular 
operational difficulties were met with in this respect. The 
chief trouble, however, appeared, to be the maintenance of the 
retort in a gas-tight condition. 

As a result of the experience gained with the 
small-scale experimental retort erected in Ottawa, a large- 
scale plant was in aue course built at Bienfait in the 
Province of Saskatchewan, The carbonization unit consisted 
of six retorts arranged in three pairs, each retort being 
designed to have a production capacity of lb tons of char 
per working day of 24 hours. Actually this production was 
never attained, the maximum being 8 tons daily. Ti^o rotary 
ariers were installed to dry the lignite before carbonization. 
Arrangements were made for the removal of the gas ana the 
tar vapours from the retort for the recovery or oy-products. 

Typical figures for the proximate analyses of the 
lignite used and of the char produced rrom it are given 
in Table XI.

as charged. The gas recovered amounted to 3940 cu. ft. per 
ton of lignite as cnarged or 2910 cu. ft. per ton of the 
raw lignite, which contained 30 per cent of moisture. 

Considerable difficulties were encountered in the 
operation of this plant, some of the more notable being the 
following: 

1. The baffles weroftnclined at 45° to the horizontal, and this 
angle of inclination was found to be insufficient to permit the 
lignite to slide freely. The lignite used at Bienfa.it con¬ 
tained a considerably higher proportion of fine material than 
that used in the Ottawa experiments. The presence of this fine 
material markedly increased the angle of repose of the entire 
bulk of the lignite. Finely-divided material was retained on 
the base of the retort and this, presumably in a carbonized 
condition, substantially reduced tne rate of heat transfer.

2. The clearance beneath the cast iron baffles* which regulated 
the thickness of the material undergoing treatment was too 
small, and the passage of the lignite between the baffles 
was stopped oy large pieces of lignite and foreign material. 
It was not possible to clear the blockages by rodding from 
the top or the bottom of the retort. After a period of 
operation the cast-iron baffles became warped. Diffic¬ 
ulties due to warping have been commonly met with in low 
temperature carbonization retorts constructed of metal 
which have been designed since the work of the Canadian 
Lignite Utilization Board ceased. 

3* Carbonization conditions were not flexible. Satisfactory 
operation depended on close adjustments of the rates of 
feeding, discharge of material and on the maintenance of 
steady temperature and pressure conditions in the retort. 

If any of these varied slightly the entire operation of 
carbonization was affected adversely. Ho experimental, 
details have been found in the literature descriptive of 
the operations of the plant which state specifically the 
effect on the operation of the retort of alterations in 
the rate of carbonization and the temperatures and 
pressures in the carbonization system. 

4. The design of the plant was so intricate that skillec^nen 
were required for its operation, thus substantially adding 
to normal carbonization plant labor costs. 

5* The original carbofrax (carborundum) floor tiles cracked 
badly and had to be replaced with fire-clay tiles of

greater thickness. This reduced the capacity of the plaht 
even below that attained when the carbofrax tiles were 
used. The maximum capacity with the carbofrax construction 
was only 50 per cent of the estimated capacity and when 
fire-clay tiles were used the capacity diminished still 
further. 

Ultimately these limitations and, in particular, 
the failure of the carbofrax construction led to the entire 
abandonment of this type of retort. 

Meanwhile American investigators (8) had been 
carrying out experimental work of a similar type with a view 
to the exploitation of the lignite deposits of North Dakota. 

As a result of this experimental work, a plant known as the 
Hood-Odell had been constructed and had given more promising 
results than those obtained at Bienfait. Accordingly, the 
Canadian Lignite Utilization Board arranged for tests to 
be made on the Hood-Odeii plant using lignite mined in the 
Bienfait area. Details of the design of the Hood-Odell plant 
are shown in Figure VI. The plant operated on an entirely 
different principle to that employed in the retorts designed 
and operated by the Canadian Lignite Utilization Board. In 
principle, the Hood-Odell plant was a shaft carbonizer 
working essentially on the principles of operation of a 
producer plant, 

The upper portion of the carbonizer had a relatively 
large capacity and served essentially for the drying of the 
lignite before its passage through the carbonization and 
gasification zones. At two separate lower levels in the 
carbonizer, air was introduced through tuyeres passing through

the wall of the carbonizer. The lower section of the carbon- 
izer was suitably tapered to provide for the decreased bulk 
of the lignite after passage through the drying and carbon¬ 
ization zones. The treated material passed from the lower 
section to a cooling chamber fitted with baffles and a 
mechanically-operated extractor to direct the flow of the 
material and to remove it from the carbonizer. In the early 
designs of this plant, it was found that the air flow tended 
to follow the sides of the carbonizer and accordingly, 
baffles were placed centrally to direct the flow of the 
material, towards the centre of the carbonizer and to bring 
it into more intimate contact with the air. In later designs 
the top baffles were replaced with a slotted pipe through 
which gas and tar vapours could be withdrawn. 

The plant was started up by igniting the lignite, 
introducing air through the tuyeres and then gradually 
building up the bed of fuel until the carbonizer was filed. 
Extraction was commenced and operations continued until steady 
conditions were obtained. Partial gasification of the lignite 
occurred, the heat from which served to carbonize the lignite 
above the gasification zone. This principle of operation is 
similar to that employed in the McLaurin plant (9) which was 
constructed along the lines of a blast furnace for the low- 
temperature carbonization of bituminous coal. 

Results obtained on the Hood-Qdell plant appeared 
to justify the erection of a similar plant at Bienfait. 

Typical figures for the proximate compositions of the lignite 
used and of the char obtained from it are given in Table XII.(7)

The char yield was 42.3 per cent, by weight of the 
lignite carbonized. 16,000 cu. ft. of gas with a gross 
heating value of 110 B.t.u. per cu. ft. were recovered per 
ton of lignite treated. The tar recovered amounted to 2.5 
to 3*5 gallons per ton of lignite. 

The results obtained with this plant were considered 
encouraging, but unfortunately by this time, December 31* 1923? 
the Canadian Lignite Utilization Board had to cease operations 
owing to lack of financial resources. After a period of 
about 5 years, the plant was disposed of to a private company 
for the nominal sum of one dollar. 

Whilst these developments were proceeding on the 
North American Continent a considerable amount of experimental 
work in the low-temperature carbonization of lignite had been 
taking place in Germany. It is not necessary to attempt even 
a general account of these developments but only to make 
mention of two retort systems which have a direct bearing on 






















































the design and operation of the retort developed by the 
Research Council of Alberta and described in detail later. 

The Limberg retort was developed in Germany after 
the First Great T .far, Figure VII (.10) shows the construction 
of this retort. The drying and carbonizing is carried out by 
means of clean hot gases circulated through the charge. 

Gas from the carbonizing zone is cooled in a heat 
exchanger, cleaned, and then used for cooling the coke. It 
later passes in counterflow through the same exchanger, and 
is then heated and passed to the second drier. From the drier 
it divides into two streams, one flowing to a gas heater where 
the gas is burned and the second to the same heater where 
this portion of the gas is pre-heated and returns to the 
retort for carbonization of the coal. A small producer is 
maintained to supply auxiliary gas for starting up the process. 

A second cycle occurs in the first drier. The 
saturated gas leaves the drier and is divided into three 
streams. Part of the gas is circulated back to the drier, 
a second portion is sent to the gas heater, and after being 
heated joins the first stream and thence to the drier, and 
the third stream is bled to the atmosphere. 

The second retort of which mention must be made 
was also designed in Germany at a later date by Lurgi. (.11). 

The Lurgi retort has within recent years been considerably 
modified and brought to the stage of successful operation 
on an industrial scale. A diagram of the Lurgi plant is 
shown in Figure VIII. (12)

It will be seen that in the Lurgi plant while the 
general principle of the shaft carbonizer has been retained, 
very considerable modifications have been introduced. Essen¬ 
tially the plant is divided into two portions, the upper a 
drying portion and lower a carbonizing portion. The dry 
material is carbonized by means of the sensible heat of hot 
combustion gases derived from the burning of a portion of the 
gas recovered during the process of carbonization and gasific 
ation. The gas is withdrawn ffom the carbonization zone by 
means of an exhauster, Gleaned by passage through scrubbers 
and. a part of it is then burned, in a combustion chamber 
built alongside the carbonizing section of the plant. 

The heat requirements of the whole process are said, 
to be such that there is an appreciable surplus of gas. G-as 
introduced at the base of the carbonizing portion of the 
retort serves to cool the coke. This gas along with gas 
from carbonization of the lignite passes to the scrubbers 
for cleaning. Thus in this portion of the plant there is a 
continual circulation of gas of which a relatively small 
quantity is burned to provide the heat for the carbonization 
of the lignite. It should be noticed that, besides the 
sensible heat derived, from the combustion of a small portion 
of the gas produced, some heat is also generated by partial 
gasification of the material which takes place in the 
carbonizing section of the plant, owing to the oxygen necess¬ 
arily present in the combustion gases.

A second small part of the gas is burned in a small 
combustion chamber built along the carbonizer at the level 
of the bottom of the drying section. The combustion gases 
are caused to pass through the drier by means of an exhaust 

fan which delivers these gases and water vapor from the drier 

to a stack and so to the atmosphere. 

For the purpose of starting the plant, a separate 
gas oroducer is provided and producer gas is burned in the two 
chambers already mentioned. 

It is stated that: (12) 

1. The temperature of the exhaust gas in the dryer is 

such that the sensible heat of the gas is fully utilized. 

2. The temperature of the carbonizing zone is approximately 
6 ^0°C. 

3. The cooling of the coke is efficient since its temperature, 
on leaving the extractor, is only slightly in excess 

of 100°C. 

4. The principle heat losses of the plant are due to the 
cooling of the gas during its cleaning. 

Two such Lurgi retorts were installed at Bienfait 
following cessation of operations by the Canadian Lignite 
Utilization Board and are still in operation. 

Development of the Lurgi system of low-temperature 
carbonization has continued in (Germany. Reports obtained by 

v 

investigating teams after hostilities ceased shoxtf- that 
development has been in two directions.

In one instance the retort has been modified to 
carbonize briquettes. Brown coal is first dried and then 
briquetted without the addition of any binder. The briquettes 
are then carbonized in a retort of the Lurgi type now known 
as the Lurgi-SpUlgas retort. (13) A diagram of this retort 
is shown in Figure IX. 

Each Lurgi-SpUlgas unit of two separate vertical 
shafts is placed one on each side of central combustion 
chambers supplying the heating gases. The capacity of a 
plant comprising ten such units is stated to have been 
3000 metric tons per working day. As in the case of the 
Bienfalt plant the heating of the charge in both the drying 
ana carbonizing sections is effected by means of the products 
of combustion of a portion of the gas produced in the 
retorts after the by-products have been recovered. 

The second type of the Lurgi retort, developed in 
Germany during the last war is known as the Krupp-Lurgi. (14) 
This retort is externally heated and operates on the batch 
system. A diagram of the Krupp-Lurgi retort is shown in 
Figure X. Each retort has seven hollow heating chambers 
through which heating gases are circulated to effect carbon¬ 
ization. The heat for the retorts is obtained by burning 
the gas from carbonization after it has been cleaned. The 
combustion gases enter tne heating chambers at a temperature 
of 620°C. the time of carbonising of one charge of lignite 
or coal is sts/Ced. to be 5*3^ hours. A plant of this type 
situated near Velsen, in the Saar, consisted of 16 retorts 
and had a total capacity of 180 tons of coal per day.

III, Design and Construction of the Research Council of 
Alberta Retort . 

My research commenced in March 1946 under the 
direction of Mr. Edgar Stansfield, Chief Research Engineer 
of the Research Council of Alberta. From a survey of 
relevant literature and from past experience it had been 
concluded that a satisfactory retort could be constructed 
which would carbonize slack coal. The features considered 
necessary in the design were: 

1. Continuous operation by internal heating in a retort 
of vertical design to allow of gravity flow. 

2. The retort need be designed to carbonize non-coking 
coals only. 

3. No attempt snould be made to recover by-products. 

4. The period of carbonization should be as short as 
possible. 

5* To provide for maximum heat transfer, the volatile 
products should be burned in the closest proximity 
to the coal, this to be accomplished by the controlled 
introduction of air into the retort. 

6. In order to minimize the extent of combustion or 
gasification of the char, contact with air or combustion 
gases should be minimized. The heat required for carbon¬ 
ization and derived from combustion of the volatile 
products, should be transferred to the coal without 
having to pass through a furnace wall*

A retort thought to embody all these features 
had already been designed and built on a small scale and 
nad been operated for a short period. It was at this stage 
that I was called on to assist in the design, construction, 
operation and testing of a plant of a similar design but 
with an estimated throughput of approximately 200 lbs. of 
coal per hour. The essential features of the retort had 
already been established, but the construction of the 
larger-retort necessitated recalculations particularly of 
the size of the flues which would be required for the larger 
quantities of volatile matter. 

Figure XI shows a cross section of the retort 
with constructional details. This design of retort seems 
to have been developed from the various designs used by the 
Canadian Lignite Utilization Board, where a system of 
baffles was repeatedly employed. In addition, the retort 
embodies the principle of the Hood-Odell and the L u rgi plants 
in which the air or flue gases used in the carbonization 
process are brought in direct contact with the lignite 
undergoing carbonization. The novelty of the design lies 
in that whilst combustion gases are brought into contact 
with the material, the contact is not as intimate as in 
the Lurgi process and thus partial gasification of the 
material is minimized. The use of baffles overcomes the 
difficulty of obtaining an even flow of gas through a solid 
fuel bed, a matter which Is especially important when the 
coal undergoing treatment contains a considerable portion

of fine material. In brief, the retort represents an attempt 
to utilize the valuable features of retorts designed by the 
Canadian Lignite Utilization Board and of the Hood-Oaell and 
the Lurgi systems. Its construction shows a fairly close 
similarity to the Limberg retort but the principle of oper¬ 
ation is essentially different. 

In the description of the retort in the succeed¬ 
ing pages, the various parts are de si‘grided by letters corres¬ 
ponding to those used in Figure XI. 

1. Divisions of Retort 

The retort could be divided along its length 
into three zones. In the top zone of the retort, the coal 
would be dried and preheated, in the middle zone carbonization 
ifould take place and in the bottom zone time would allow of 
completion of the carbonization. No air was supplied to 
the lowest section of the retort. 

At the time the plant was designed it was not 
possible to say what would be the lengths of the drying, 
carbonizing and equalizing zones. The length of these zones 
had to be assumed in the light of experience and on the 
assumption that drying, preheating and carbonisation would 
take place substantially in the zones already enumerated. 

2. Baffles 

The baffles (T) were made of carborundum and were 
supported by slotted carborundum end plates (U). The baffles 
were 9 in. x 6 in. x 3/4 in.; the end plates were 6 in. x 
3 3/4 in, x 1 in. with slots 25/32 in. wide and 3/£> in. deep

set at an angle of 60° with tne horizontal. The baffles 
were staggered, to prevent bridging. One end plate was cut 
in half to provide a support 3 in. high for the first baffle. 
This first baffle consisted of a '’pliCEst 11 block cast 
between the two small end plates. Carborundum was chosen 
as the building material because of its strength, non¬ 
reactivity with hot char, high conductivity ana its ability 
to withstand abrasion. The plates and baffles were purchased 
ready made from the Canadian Carborundum Co., Niagara Palls, 
Ontario. 

3* Calculation of Flue Spaces 

In order to calculate the size of the flues 
which would be required, it was necessary to know the quantity 
and quality of the volatile matter produced by carbonization 
of the coal at a temperature of approximately 600°C. From 
previous experimental work, it was assumed that the carbon¬ 
ization of 100 lbs. of a C type subbituminous coal having 
a calorific value of S>,500 B.t.u. per lb., would produce 
approximately 50 lb. of char with a calorific value of 13,000 
b.t.u. per lb., that is to say the carbonization of 100 lb. 
of coal would make available 200,000 b.t.u. on complete 
combustion of the volatile matter. 

It was further assumed that, under normal conditions 
of working, complete combustion would not be obtained and 
that only 75 per cent, of the total heat available would 
be developed in the flues. This would be equivalent to 
150,000 B.t.u. for every 100 lb. of coal treated. The 
composition of the volatile matter was not known precisely, 
























- 48 - 


and. no exact allowance could be made for heat available 
in the tar vapours. The broad assumption was, therefore, 
made that the gas would be similar to a low-temperature gas 
from this type of coal, out its available heat would be 
somewhat increased because of the tar vapours. 

One volume of a typical low-temperature carbon¬ 
ization gas has a theoretical air requirement of approximately 
8 1/4 volumes of air. (15) Tne gas has a gross calorific 
value of about 900 B.t.u. per cu. ft., measured under 
standard conditions which, distributed in the theoretical 
combustion products represents approximately 100 B.t.u. per 
cu. ft. of combustion gas. In other words, by the addition 
of 8 1/4 volumes of air, 9 1/^ volumes of flue gas would be 
produced under theoretical conditions of combustion equiv¬ 
alent to the development of approximately 100 B.t.u. per 
cu. ft. of air. This makes no allowance for excess air 
but in view of the lack of precise data, it was considered 
that a round figure of 100 B.t.u. per cu. ft. would be 
satisfactory for the calculation of the size of the flues. 

Accordingly, for the combustion of the volatile 
matter per 100 lb. of coal, that is, for the development of 
150,000 B.t.u. 1500 cu. ft. of air at N.T.P. would have to 
oe supplied. Correcting this volume to a basis of measure¬ 
ment at 20°C. and 700 mm. mercury pressure, the amount of 
air required per 100 lb. of coal - 1500 x 293 x 760 -1150 cu.ft. 

273 Too 

If the maximum capacity of the retort is assumed 
to be 200 lb. of coal per hour, the total air required is 




















thus 3500 cu. ft. per hour or 58 cu. ft. P er min. 

The total volume of the flue gas is thus approx¬ 
imately 9/8 x 1750 - 1970 cu. ft. per 100 ID. coal carbonized. 
A round figure of 2000 cu. ft. was talien as the volume of 
flue gas which would have to be handled. The exit temper¬ 
ature of tne flue gas was, of course, unknoira but it was 
assumed that it would oe approximately 150°G. It was also 
assumed that the retort would operate with the pressure at 
the top or the retort approximately atmospheric. The flue 
gas volume unuer these conditions would oe: 

20uu x 423 or approximately 3200 cu. ft. per 100 ID. 

233 

coai or 6400 cu. ft. per hour for a maximum coal rate of 
200 Id. per hour. This is equivalent to 1.78 cu. ft. per 
second. It was considered aesiraDie to maintain a reason- 
aoly slow upward velocity of gas in tne flues in order to 
give the maximum time ror combustion to take place and to 
allow of the drying of tne eoai. In determining tne 
diameter oj. a chimney, tne velocity of tne chimney gas gener¬ 
ally employed is of tne order of 15 or 16 feet per second, 
rising m exceptional cases to 20 feet per second. Since 
it was -desired to maintain tne not gases in contact with the 
coai for tne longest possioie period of time, it was decided 
to work on the oasis 01 a velocity or about 3 feet per 
second. 

With tne length of the flues determined d y the 
length of tne carborundum Daffies, tne width of tne flues to 
give the desired gas velocity of about 5 f ee t per second was 
round to De 3 inches.

4. Dimensions or Retort 

Tne neignt or tne caroonizer, as determined by 
tne available space in tne laboratory, was 224 incnes. in 
order to obtain tne maximum space for cooling tne cnar, tne 
longest traverse of tne coal tnrougn tne drying and carbon¬ 
izing zones, and in order to leave sufficient space for a 
nopper containing at least 3° minutes supply or coal witn 
probable rates of discnarge, tne dimensioning of tne plant 
was as follows: 

(a) Stand supporting retort ano. containing tne cooler - 
36 incnes in neignt. 

Co; overall neignt or retort irom top of stand to exit 
of hopper -17^ incnes. 

{ c) Height of hopper - 1^4- inches. 

It was considered that the three zones in the 
retort would be represented by: 

(fi) 3k inches from the outlet of the hopper for the drying 
and preheating zone. To permit greater contact be¬ 
tween the coal ana tne baffles in unis zone, tne 
number or baffles nere was increased, tnis being made 
possible oy bringing tnem closer together vertically. 
Sna plates 41/2 ins. nign, instead of b ins. as in tne 
carbonization zone, were, tnererore, used, fnese end 
plates were cast in tne laboratory from Piicast cement. 
To allow tne coal to remain in tne drying and pre¬ 
neat mg section ror a longer period of time, tne coal 
passage in tnis zone was made 2 1/2 incnes wide

compared with 1 1/2 In. in the carbonization zone. 

^d) The carbonization zone was 140 incnes long* Exactly 
where the demarcation line between the drying and pre¬ 
heating zone and the caroonization zone would occur in 
operation was, of course, unknown. 

(c) The equalizer zone consjsted of the remaining 36 inches 
of the retort. Here too, the width of the coal passage 
was increased by one inch in order to allow a greater 
length of time for the larger pieces to lose their volatile 
matter. The end plates used in the equalizing zone were 
of the standard carborundum type and were cemented in 
place with Plicast cement. 

5* Construction 

The retort was insulated by means of £ - 26 porous 
fire brick. .As viewed in Figure XI, in the front and back 
of the coal passage the insulation consisted of one and 
one half bricks on end - a total thickness of 3 3/^ inches. 

The #iole bricks were grooved to hold the end plates; the 
half bricks were set behind the whole bricks in a staggered 
manner to produce a more gas-tight setting. The sides of 
the retort were insulated by means of fire bricks laid flat 
as shown at (Gr) for a distance of 3b inches to 62 inches 
as measured from the base of the retort. In the next 5^ 
inches the bricks were set on end as shown at (F) and in the 
top 3b inches half bricks were used as at (D). The thickness 
of the insulation was reduced as these separate steps were 
made in order to provide larger flue spaces towards the top

of the retort and to make provision for water vapour evolved 
in the drying zone. 

The whole of the retort was enclosed in a 
24 l/4 ins, x 16 3/4 ins. galvanized 22 gauge sheet iron 
casing (0). This casing was made in two &7 inch sections 
set one above the other. Each section was made up of a 
three-sided enclosure and a front plate. All metal sections 
had one inch flanges, so that the two sections could be 
oolted to one another and the front plate could be bolted 
to the three-sided enclosure. The sections were fastened 
together with 1/4 inch stove bolts spaced two inches apart. 
0ne-half inch, iron straps were used on both sides of the 
flanges for increased strength. 

The metal enclosure was lined with asbestos 
paper, this paper being carried out to the ends of the 
flanges. The ends of the asbestos paper were smeared with 
furnace cement to provide an air-tight seal. A drawing of 
the casing and flanges is shown in Figure XII. 

The hopper (A) was 20 inches square and g> inches 
higxh, sloping to an S in, by 8> in. neck into the retort. 

The top of the neck was welded to a plate (B) which was 
Doited to the top of the metal casing. The neck protruded 
three inches into the retort to prevent any coal falling 
past the baffles. 

The bottom of the casing was bolted to a 1/4 
inch steel plate (0) shown in Figure XII. In this plate 
an g in. x 6 l/4 in. opening was cut out to allow for the

discharge of coal; two inch diameter holes (V) and (P) 
were drilled as air inlets and the holes (2*Z) as observation 
ports into the combustion chambers* Two inch lock nuts were 
welded to the plate around the holes to enable two inch pipes 
to be screwed in. The plate was covered with 1 1/4 inch 
thick firebrick (N) with openings cut to correspond with those 
in the steel plate. A sheet of asbestos paper was placed 
betideen the steel plate and the firebrick. 

In order to preheat the combustion air, the air 
was admitted through the two 2 inch inlets (V) and (P) into 
preheater sections (M). The preheating passages were 1 1/2 
inches wide and % inches high and were made by partitioning 
the flue space with baffles (L). The preheated air was intro¬ 
duced into the combustion chambers through the three passages 
iH) on each flue side, and then through the small openings 
(I), which were spaced a brick distance apart over a vertical 
distance of nearly four feet* 

Into the observation holes (Z,Z) were screwed 
two inch nipples. These were covered with glass windows 
which were kept in place with metal rings retained by springs. 

6. Pooling System 

The char was cooled by passing through a water- 
jacketed cooler (W). Two 3 inch passages provided a super¬ 
ficial cooling area of 1770 square inches and a volume of 
23SO cu. inches. Gold water was introduced through a half 
inch pipe (X) at the bottom of the cooler and withdrawn 
through two half inch pipes at the top. To the bottom of the 
cooler was welded a pan (Y) to house the discharge rakes.

The cooler was bolted to the bottom of the carbonlzer base 
plate. Figure XIII shows the construction of the cooler. 

7* Stand 

The retort rested on a two inch angle iron stand, 
36 inches high. 

80 Method of Discharge 

The cnar was removed by the reciprocating motion 
of a rake shown in Figure XII. This rake consisted of 5 one 
half inch metal strips spaced 4 inches apart and held at the 
ends by similar strips at right angles. To the metal strips 
were bolted other thin strips of metal in such a manner as 
to give a toothed effect. The spaces were filled with furnace 
cement to provide extra strength. This rake was suspended 
from the top of the stand by four metal strips and could 
swing freely. 

The rake was driven by an eccentric which was 
directly connected to a Graham variable reducer, which in 
turn was directly connected to a 1/4 H.P. motor. The stroke 
of the rake was four inches. The Graham variable drive could 
oe controlled to give any desired rate of throughput, 

9. Flue Gas Removal 

The combustion gases entering the flues were 
by 

removed/two 5 inch pipes (,S) each ten inches long, leading 

to a common main. The top of the main led to the stack by 

means of a six inch pipe and the bottom to an overflow 

container to catch any condensed moisture. A side arm from 

a 

this lower pipe led to an exhauster and thence by four inch

pipe to a second chimney. A diagram of the exhaust system 
is shown in Figure XIV. 

10. Air Supply 

The air was supplied by a DFC air blower driven 
oy a 1/2 H.P. motor rated to supply 140 c.f.m. at a pressure 
of 10 inches water gauge. The flow was measured by a 2 inch 
Fischer and Porter rotameter. From the rotameter the air 
flow is divided into two 2 inch lines leading to the retort. 
Three valves were set in the lines, one just above the 
rotameter and one on each of the two individual streams. 

11. Temperature Control 

Temperatures were measured at six points down 
the coal stream by means of chrome1-alumel thermocouples. 

The thermocouples were encased in closed silica tubes, insert 
ed through holes in the metal casing, insulation bricks and 
carborundum plates and protruded 3 inches into the coal 
stream. The thermocouples were connected by means of 
compensating leads to a central switch and then to a manually 
operated potentiometer. The positions of the thermocouples 
are shown in Figure XV and are referred to in this thesis as 
T.C. 1, 2, 3, etc. 

The flue temperatures were taken by means of 

2 iron-constantan thermocouples placed centrally in the 

of the 

flue gas streams, 9 1/2 inches below the centre exhaust 
outlets (S). These were connected to a Leeds-Northrup 
automatic recorder which gave continuous readings in degrees 
Fahrenheit. The readings are referred to later as 7 and 2, 
respectively.

Pressures were measured at two points in the 
combustion chambers of the retort by means of inclined 
manometers calibrated in inches of waiter. One point was 
16 1/2 inches below the centre of the west flue outlet and 
the other 28 1/4 inches above the base of the east flue. 
The pressures are designated P^ and Pg respectively. 

13. Other equipment included a 240 Id. weighing 
scale calibrated to 1/4 lb., loading buckets, pulley and 
rope for filling the hopper with coal, char pans and so 


forth

IV. PRELIMINARY TESTS 


The retort was erected originally in a position 
where space was very confined and where the fire hazard was 
such as to make it undesirable to leave the plant filled 
with hot material overnight. In addition, the pressure of 
the natural gas available was not high and difficulties arose 
accordingly in heating up the retort; to a working temperature 
within a reasonable period of time. 

The retort was filled completely with Beverly 
stoker coal, sized 'below one in. and above half in. mesh* 

The total capacity of the retort was 280 Ids. ox coal. 

In starting up the plant the natural gas burners were lit 
and inserted in trie retort through the observation holes, 
owing to the short length of the cooler, air was induced 
through it into the retort and that portion of tne coal in 
closest proximity to tne natural gas flames burned readily. 
With tne coal burning as well as undergoing carbonization, 
when the extractor came into operation, the char removed from 
the plant was in an incandescent condition. 

In order to provide against this occurrence, 
efforts were made to restrict the flow 01 air through the 
cooler by fitting dampers in tne chimney flue. Also, finer 
size oi coal was employed in the hope that this would restrict 
tne amount of air finding its way up through the material 
in tne cooler. In addition, a one quarter inch brass tuoe 
with perforations in its under side was inserted just above 
the.cooler so that water could oe directed on to the two 
streams of char. None of these measures were effective in 
cooling the cnar to the point at which it wouiu. not easily

ignite and again become incandescent on exposure to air. 

In one tesu perioa immediately before extrac¬ 
tion or material commenced, measurement of temperature in 
the coal bed showed that at a point about 12 incnes below 
tne outlet, oi tne gas burners, tne coal temperature was 
614°0. and J>b inches higher it was 64&°G. Tne riue temper¬ 
atures 17 and TS at that time were fI0°G. and 330°U. 
respectively. About 25 minutes after char extraction 
commenced, tne Hue gas temperatures had fallen to 5 °G°g. 
ana 240°G. respectively and 15 minutes later the flames 
from the ignited volatile matter expired. The char removed 
from the retort during tne whole period, from tne commencement 
of extraction to the time wnen tne flames in tne flues 
expired, was in an incandescent condition. 

In a second test, after a perioa of six hours 
required for heating up the retort with natural gas, efforts 
were made by reducing the rate of extraction ox the cnar 
to reduce its temperature on removal from the cooler but 
the material was still incandescent. On this occasion the 
flue gas temperature varied from 450°C„ to 3^0°U. and the 
coal temperatures, as measured by T 5 fell as much as 100°G1 
over a period of one hour. These temperatures are given as 
indicating that even a substantial reduction in tne temper¬ 
ature of tne cnar within tne retort was insufficient to 
give the material at the extractor, tne temperature which 
was sufficiently low to prevent its active combustion taxing 
place Ttfhen it was exposed to tne atmosphere. 












Up to tins stage operation had been quite inter¬ 
mittent. Alter eacii day's run the retort was emptiea completely 
ana aliowea to cool. One test was maae to determine ir plant 
operation could oe continued from day to day after a snut- 
aown overnight so tiiat a mucn snorter period for neating tne 
retort witn natural gas would oe necessary at tne start of 
tne following day*s run. Accordingly tne retort was left 
fully cnargea overnignt witn tne dampers of tne flues entirely 
closed and tne extractor exit sealed witn plugs of thoroughly- 
wetted and compressed paper. After standing overnignt, tne 
temperatures T5 and T6 respectively were 284°u. and 350°G. 

Tne following morning tne paper plugs were removed, tne 
dampers opened and tne natural gas burners lignted. Observ¬ 
ation of tne ignition of tne volatile matter had been t alien 
formerly as an indication tnat tne plant nad re acne d tne 
operating conditions at wnicn tne extraction of the char might 
oe commenced. On tills particular occasion, however, no sucn 
ignition occurred, even after prolonged neating witn natural 
gas, the coal presumably having already lost the bulk of its 
volatile matter. It was considered tnat to operate tne char 
extractor at this stage would only result in cold coal being 
brought into tne heated zones wnicn would, of course, simply 
give rise to conditions similar to tnose wnicn obtained when 
tne retort was women intermittently from day to day. 

Wnen a charge or dried coal was used it was 
found tnat tne temperature at which tne volatile matter 
ignited could be attained after a heating period of tnree 
instead of six hours. Under these conditions with an air

supply or 40 c.r.m. tne average riue gas temperature Has 
580°C. Working the retort: at tills temperature ror any 
considerable lengtn ox time, however, caused tne motor 
which drove tne exnauster to overneat, Wnen the exhauster 
Has shut down, a positive pressure developed in tne combustion 
Hues, tne gas round its way through the coal hopper and 
into tne room and it became necessary to again shut down tne 
plant. The mcanaescent condition or tne cnar on extraction 
necessitated tne excessive use of tne water spray. This, 
together with additional water used in quenching the merging 
char, gave rise to considerable mechanical difriculties. 

Tne rase railed completely to remove tne wet material and 
simpiy ploughed ridges through it. 

In oraer to overcome the difficulty of the over¬ 
heating of tne exnauster, the pipe to the exnauster was 

and a 

extended and cooled with a water spray/ three inch diameter 
exit pipe or tne exnauster replaced oy one of six inches 
diameter. In addition the number of rakes on the discharge 
mechanism was increased to seven and steam was used for quench 
ing tne char in tne cooler in place of tne water used prev¬ 
iously. The steam was admitted through several small tunes 
introduced at tne base of tne extractor. Whilst the cooler 
on tne exhaust system was round to be erficient, the char 
as it came out or tne plant was still at a temperature at 
xfhich it readily ignited on exposure to air. 

At this stage or development, it was decided 
that the nre hazard with tne plant in its then location 
was too great and. accordingly tne wnole plant was dismantled

and reasseiiiujLecL on a more convenient site in the Boiler Room 
or the University Power Plant. Tile opportunity was taken to 
make rurther modifications in the design of the plant, me 
cooler was redesigned to provide a greater cooling surface 
oy extending its length, tne superficial area being increased 
from 17 (0 to pnOO square incnes and volume from 23SO to 4200 
cubic incnes. 

Tne rake form of extractor was replaced witn one 
of a rotary compartment cq type. Tne form of tne extractor 
and tne manner of driving it is shorn in Figure XVI* 

Tne new site required tne installation or a six 
inch diameter galvanized flue pipe po feet in lengtn to convey 
tne gases to the exhauster, which was conveniently situated 
near to tne main stack of tne University Power Plant. The 
cooling surface of tne pipe was such that it became: possible 
to discard entirely tne water cooler fitted previously to 
tne plant. To provide for any condensate from tne cooled 
flue gases a condenser trap was provided between the exhauster 
and tne retort just prior to the gases entering tne exhauster. 

Tne pressure of the natural gas stream now 
available was considerably greater than formerly. Accordingly, 
the natural gas burners to the retort x-rere fixed permanently 
in a horizontal position in the flues, approximately three 
feet above tne base of the flues, nearly level witn tne lowest 
air imet. Holes were drilled in tne casing of the retort 
to make it possible to light-up tne natural gas burners more * 
easily. No provision was made for measuring tne gas used.

out the volumes burned were considerably in excess of tnose 
employed rormerly. 

For tine purpose of cnarging the report with coal, 
a platform was erected, to give easy access to the coal hopper 
at the top of the retort ana tne coal was eievatea from 
rloor level to the hopper in Duckets raised by hand by means 
or a rope ana pulley. In order to reduce the heat loss due 

to radiation, tne outer case was lagged with sheets of 
asbestos board cut to size and moiaea to the shape of the 
retort. These sheets were fixed in position by means of 
cheese cloth impregnated with a flour* adhesive. 

A coal bin x^as constructed to hold about S tons 
or coai. This quantity or coal was screened to pass a one 
inch mesh screen, so that during carbonization the now or 
material would not cease aue to any large pieces or coal 
resting between tne oai'rle places. 

In staroaxig up tne plant, tne natural gas burners 
were lighted the night prior to the day*s run and were left 
burningfhr about 15 hours. By next morning typical temper¬ 
atures along the length of the retort were as follows:

At the commencement of a run the retort was 
filled entirely with coal, the extractor being stationary 
with the whole charge of coal resting on it. Almost immed¬ 
iately after charging, volatile matter was observed to fire 
in the vicinity of the burners. As soon as this occurred, 
the supply of natural gas was turned off and extraction 
commenced at a predetermined rate* At the same time the 
air blower was started, the rotameter adjusted to give the 
desired air rate and the exhauster turned on. 

The exhauster speed could not be varied. With 
changes in the rate of the air supply, pressures in the 
retort could not be maintained constant. Some infiltration 
of air through the cooler occurred even though the length 
of the cooler had been extended, producing, as in former 
cases, a char which fired upon exposure to air. Accordingly, 
a six inch square hole was cut in the exhauster pipe on the 
retort side of the system and this hole was fitted with a 
movable cover plate so that the pull of the exhauster of 
the retort could be controlled. 

A positive pressure was desirable in the flues 
of the retort to guard against infiltration of air into 
the system and also in order to give the maximum length of 
time for contact of hot combustion products with the coal 
charge. Unfortunately, with a slight positive pressure 
at the top of the retort, it was found that the vapours 
passed through the hoal hopper into the room. Accordingly, 
•che pressure at the top of the flues of the retort was 
adjusted to a negative pressure of 0.03 ins. water gauge.

Settings of the opening on the exhaust pipe were determined 
for these pressure conditions and for suitable rates of air 
flow as measured by the rotameter. 

At the outset, Beverly slack coal was employed 
since supplies of it were tnen readily available, this coal 
being used at the site for steam raising purposes. No 
particular flow difficulties were encountered in using this 
slack coal in its normally dry condition. On one occasion, 
however, the coal delivered was superficially wet and when 
this wet material was used it was found that it would not 
flow freely through the retort. This particular batch of coal 
was sampled, precaution being taken against any water loss. 
Determination of the water contents of this sample and of a 
sample of the coal as usually delivered in the dry condition, 
showed that where^as the wet coal contained 27 per cent, of 
water the water content of the dry material, was 25 per cent. 
This relatively small difference requires emphasis, since it 
shows that a relatively small amount of water held super¬ 
ficially by the coal may give rise to very considerable oper¬ 
ating difficulties in a plant of this kind. It was found 
moreover, that when blockage of the retort occurred, since 
it was clearly undesirable to clean the passage by redding 
because of possible damage to the structure of the retort, 
the only satisfactory way of cleaning the retort was to heat 
it with natural gas to a sufficiently high temperature and 
then to provide ample supplies of air to burn out the char 
choking the retort.

At a later stage, a supply of Black Diamond slack 
coal was received. This coal has a much more glossy appearance 
than Beverly coal and it flowed more freely tnrough the retort. 
Black Diamond coal in a wet condition, however, caused a like 
olockage of the coal, passage in the retort. 

Beverly slack coal was in use on the first occasion 
on which the plant operated over a complete working day of 
about eight hours. The proximate analysis and calorific value 
of Beverly slack coal is given in Table XIII.

of the flue gas temperatures, T7 and T$ were made at half- 
hourly intervals between 9*00 a.ra. and 4:00 p.m. To maintain 
the retort in operation, Doth the rate of air supply ana the 
rate of discharge were varied from time to time. 

A record of the observations made is given in

It was observed that the volatile matter was 
burning in only one flue. 

The exhauster was started at a slow rate with 
tne extractor dial setting at 6 but a half hour 
later this was increased to 10 . 

The natural gas was turned off and the coal gas 
was found to be burning readily in both flues. 
Charging of the retort continued at approx¬ 
imately hourly intervals. 

It was observed that the flue temperatures were 
falling rapidly and in an effort to maintain 
the flue temperatures the extraction rate was 
decreased from setting 10 to 8 to 5 and the 
air rate changed from 40 to 20 to 25 c.f.m. 
according to the combustion conditions observed. 

luring the last 2 1/2 hours of the run tne weight 
of the coal carbonized was 295 and the weight of the 

char produced was 144 io. giving a yield of 48.8 per cent. 

By measuring the number of filled buckets of coal processed 


and char produced a rough approximation of tne volume ratio 
was found to be 1.5 to 1 .

V, TRIAL RUNS 

All experimental work described hereafter was 
carried out on Black Diamond slack coal, in a superficially 
ary condition, as normally delivered from the mine. The 
screen analysis, proximate ana ultimate analyses and calorific 
value of this coal are given below. According to the 
A,S,T.M. classification it is a C type subbituminous coal.

A. Series 1 

A series of six runs was carried out at an average 
coal tnrougnput of 92 lb. per hour. During the first three runs 
the air supply as measured oy the rotameter was maintained 
at 20 c.i.m., and in the next three runs at 7> 30 and 0 
c.r.m. respectively. In the last case no air was supplied * 
oy trie blower, only such air being available as could infiltrate 
through leaks in the retort. 

Shortly after the commencement of carbonization, 
the extracting mechanism was started in order to obtain as 
soon as possible reasonably steady conditions of carbonization. 
The termperature readings in the coal stream' as measured oy 
the thermocouples fluctuated as much as 30 to 50 degrees 
over a period of a minute. Three readings were, therefore, 
taken of the temperatures registered by each thermocouple 
at intervals or one minute and these results averaged to give 
the halr-nourly readings. The pressures Pi and ?£ were 
maintained as closely as possible at -.03 and -.10 inches 
of water respectively. In each run the char was bulked and 
sampled and the proximate analysis and calorific value 


determined 








































- 75 - 


Tne pi am; operated satisfactorily for a working 
period or about 7 tours, details of tnese results are 
given in Tables XVln to XXI. Three runs were made at an 
air rate of 20 c.f.m. to see now closely tne results would 
cneck unaer trie same operating conditions. Since tne results 
obtained xfere considered to oe reasonably reproducabie, oniy 
tne mean of tnese tnree runs is presented for an air rate 
of 20 c.f.m. 

Figure XVII shows tne variations of flue gas 
temperature witn time. With air supplied only tnrough sucn 
leaks as occurred in tne setting, tnat is witn tne exnauster 
fan in operation, Qur tne air inlet fan stationary, one 
nour after cnarging tne retort tne flame in one flue slowly 
expired altnougn tne flame in tne otner flue was maintained 
tin uue end of tne test, tne total period of tne test being 
5 nours. 

It was observed tnat wnereas tne flame in tne 
former case at tne commencement of tne run was of a turbulent 
nature and completely filled tne flue, as time went on tne 
degree or turbulence lessened and tne flame slowly recreated 
from tne wail to tnu baffles. Ultimately tnere appeared to 
be a tmn sneet or flame along tne baffle wan and eventually 
tne flame became patcny ana ultimately tnese patcnes 
diminisnea in size and tne. flames died completely. In 
experiments to be described later, it was noted tnat wnen 
tne flame in one flue expired tne temperature in tne otner 
fiue increased., for a time at least.

It is considered, therefore, not unreasonable 
to represent the flue gas temperature in this instance 
in Figure XVII by the average of the temperatures shown 
by thermocouple 7 and g, as in cases where the flue temper¬ 
atures over the whole period of operation were approximately 
parallel and only about 20°C. apart as a maximum. Figure 
XVII indicates that the general tendency is for the flue 
gas temperature to increase as the rate of air supply 
increases. When the combustion of the volatile matter is 
complete, an increase in air supply infers a proportionate 
increase in the volume of the flue gas and with a higher 
flue gas temperature there is then a greater loss of heat 
up the stack and hence a smaller amount of heat expended 
in drying and carbonizing. 

Figures XVIII to XXIII show the variations 
of the temperature in the coal stream as measured by thermo¬ 
couples T1 to T6 during the carbonization period. Only 
when the rates of air supply are low, i.e. curves 0 and 7 
is it possible to indicate even approximately where drying 
ceases and carbonization commences. Under these conditions 
drying of the coal by hot gases prior to carbonization is 
seen in Figure XVIII and to a leaser extent in Figure XIX. 
Sven under these conditions incipient thermal decomposition 
seems to be evident in the early stages of carbonization, 
before the flow of fresh coal through the retort has given 
rise to a state approaching steady conditions, that is

as represented by the curves in Figure XVII becoming 
parallel to the time axis. With these rates, the drying 
zone apparently extended at least five feet into the retort. 

A further two feet dox^rn the retort carbonization of the coal 
had obviously set in with the attainment of temperatures 
exceeding 700°C. 

No precise explanation can be attempted of the 
nature of the temperature variations which are shown in the 
curves for all thermocouples up to T4 and most marked in T2 
in the first three to five hours of operation of the plant. 
Holdings and Cobb (lo) have shown that in coals of a high 
oxygen content exothermic reactions are most marked when 
coal is carbonized at low temperatures, that is from 2S>0 to 
^80°0. owing to the thermal decomposition of oxygenated 
compounds. Since with particles of considerable si z e 
carbonization takes an appreciable time, temperatures of 
this order may be considered to obtain in the interior of 
the particles even though the exterior may attain temper¬ 
atures of 700°C. These exothermic effects must continue 
during carbonization over a considerable length of the 
retort and to develop in a perfectly regular manner. 

Carbonization of the material with the low 
rate of air supply of seven c.f.m. appears to continue well 

past thermocouples T5 and T6, that is well into the equalizer 

zone and it appears that in the equalizer zone at a slow 
rate of air supply cooling of the material is not very rapid. 

As is to be expected and as shown by the 

analysis of the char, the greater the proportion of the

heat available in the carbonization and drying processes, 
the greater the actual degree of carbonization. Thus with 
20 cubic feet of air per minute the yield of char is 40 
per cent, and the char has a volatile matter content of 
6.1 per cent, whereas with 30 c.f.m. the yield is 53 per 
cent, and the volatile matter content of the char is 6.0 
per cent. With an air rate of 7 cubic feet per minute, a 
high yield of char was obtained and this result could only 
be ascribed, at this state, as due to incomplete combustion 
of the volatile matter. 

Summarizing as shown by this series of experiments, 

1. Steady conditions of operation of the plant are 
approached only after the retort has been in operation 
at least three to five horn’s. 

2. In the initial period of three to five hours, the 
passage of the fresh coal down the retort and the 
varying size of the material may account for the 
variations in the temperatures measured along the 
length of the retort. 

3. These temperature variations, however, develop quite 
uniformly as the material passes through the retort. 
Their occurrence makes it impossible to differentiate 
clearly the drying and carbonizing zones except at the 
lowest air rates. 

4. W ith a throughput of 92 lbs. of coal per hour, the 
optimum air supply is of the order of 20 c.f.m. Above 
and below this supply,larger quantities of heat are 
lost in the flue gases, either as sensible or undevel- 
°Ped heat.

B. SERIES II 

A series of ten trial runs was made with an aver¬ 
age throughput of 157 lbs. of coal per hour whilst the air 
rate was varied from 20 to 5° c.f.m. Mechanically, the 
discharge mechanism operated quite efficiently at this rate 
and, as far as was noted, the char was not discharged at any 
appreciably higher temperature than at the lower rate 
employed in Series I. In general, operation continued much 
as in the first series of trial runs. 

The temperature readings during this series of 
runs and the proximate analysis and calorific values of the 
chars are given in Table XXII to XXXI. The results are 
expressed graphically on the same basis as previously in 
Figures XXIV to XXX. The graphs represent averages of two 
or more runs at the same air rates. 

In Figure XXV the temperature curve indicated by 
thermocouple T1 for runs at 20 c.f.m., represents sub¬ 
stantially the normal conditions in the drying process. 

The onset of carbonization is only perceptible. At 40 c.f.m. 
at the position in the retort represented by T1 carboniz¬ 
ation phenomena, became quite pronounced. At 50 c.f.m. the 
drying conditions again become apparent as in the case with 
20 c.f.m. The curves in Figure XXV take up the position 
which would be anticipated and these curves correlate with 
those in Figure XXIV which show the average flue gas temper¬ 
atures. It should be noted that the curve for 50 c.f.m.

characteristics does show somewhat excessively high 
temperatures in the initial three hours of carbonization 
with respect to T1 in Figure XXY as xfell as with flue 
gas temperatures in Figure XXIV. 

The flue gases in passing out of the retort 
change direction at the top of the flues and a certain 
amount of turbulence necessarily occurs here. Invariably 
in these trial runs, temperature T2 is lower than temper¬ 
ature Tl. With the relatively high rate of discharge 
it is preferable in this series, to assume that the bottom 
of the drying zone is best approximated from the thermo¬ 
couple T2. Reference to Figure XXVI shows that at an air 

the bottom of 

rate of 50 cu. ft# per minute, the drying zone is somewhat 
below this position although, as in previous cases, carbon¬ 
ization effects are also observable here* If the curves 
for the 50 c.f.m. rate are compared with those for the 
40 c.f.m. rate, it will be seen that at 4-0 c.f.m., which 
relatively represents optimum conditions of operation of 
this retort at this rate of throughput, the temperatures 
shown by T2 are much higher in the latter case. With 
40 c.f.m. , the drying zone appears to be well past the 
position of thermocouple T2 and the curves for temperatures 
at T3 show that at this rate, carbonization is well 
advanced at this position in the retort. At lower and 
higher rates of air supply, the carbonization zone 
obviously extends much farther down the retort. Apparently 
at 50 c.f.m. the amount of excess air is such as to reduce

material obtained in the last hour and one half in eacn run. 
One sample, namely tnat obtained from run g>, with an air 
supply of 30 c.f.m., shows a low volatile matter content 
and the yield is correspondingly low. The samples of char 
obtained in the other runs do not, on the whole, show 
marked differences. Excluding tne former sample, volatile 
matter contents for rates of 20, 30 , to and 50 c.f.m. of 
air are respectively 13 .S, 15*4, 14.3 and 15*3 per cent. 

Examination of the actual hourly observations, 
taken during run 8 have not disclosed any particular 
reasons for the low volatile matter content of the char ip 
this case, out it will be observed in FiguresXXV to XXX 
that particularly in the lower portion in the retort the 
temperatures were relatively high and that these temper¬ 
atures were maintained down to the position shown by 
thermocouple T6. The positions of the Itaermccouples T5 
and T6 are well below the lower level of the air inlets 
and the readings of these thermocouples indicate conditions 
after the material had been raised to its full carbon¬ 
ization temperature. 

Judging by the volatile matter contents and 
yields obtained in this series of runs, if the temperatures 
in the equalizer section of the retort are not too high.

a char can be obtained which contains a relatively high 
quantity of volatile matter. If, However, these temperatures 
are somewhat higher tne cnar appears to lose its volatile 
matter rapidly. 

It should be noted that, generally, the volatile 
matter content of the chars in this series of runs is very 
much higher than in Series I. It would seem, therefore, that 
to obtain a char of a high volatile matter content, a high 
rate of discharge is essential. This applies equally to the 
yield of char. However, it would be necessary to continue 
each run for a much longer period of time than about eight 
hours to determine whether such a high rate could, be maintained 
indefinitely. Initially, the temperatures given the retort 
by heating with natural gas are so high that sufficient reserve 
of heat is contained by the retort to maintain a higher 
throughput than is possible by the process itself. This is 
evidenced by the general fall in.temperatures throughout the 
retort. The calorific value of the char obtained at both 
rates is approximately the same. 

The optimum air rate as determined by the quantity 
of coal carbonized, appears to be reasonably in line with the 
results of the runs in Series I. Whereas in the former case 
the quantity was 13-0 cu. ft. of air per lb. of coal, in 
Series II the rate was 115• 2 cu » f£• of air per Id. of coal.

C. SERIES III 

In speaiding of the design of the retort three 
zones have been distinguished, namely dryingjand preheat¬ 
ing, carbonizing and equalizer zones. When the retort is 
charged with coal, the retort is already at a relatively 
high temperature. Before the discharge of the char commences 
and folloitfing the cooling of the retort momentarily, the 
whole of the coal charge at least above the air inlet 
commences to dry from the exterior to the interior of the 
charge and drying is followed almost immediately by carbon¬ 
ization ana evolution of the volatile matter. 

The volume and composition of the volatile matter 
vary with the degree of carbonization. When the volatile 
matter ignites and commences to burn, the rate of drying 
and of carbonization will increase so long as the heat 
required for these processes does not exceed the sum of 
that derived from the combustion of the volatile matter 
and the neat already available in the heated retort. If 
the heat required for drying and carbonization is in excess 
of this sum, then the system will slowly cool and the cooling 
will continue until a balance is reached between the heat 
required and the heat generated by the combustion of the 
volatile matter. In time, if the latter is insufficient 
for the drying and carbonization of the incoming coal 
the whole process will eventually cease. 

Up to this state no data had been obtained which 
would allow of even an approximation of the distribution 
of the availaDle heat generated in the retort.

In this series, six runs were made during which 
hall* hourly analyses of the waste gases for caroon dioxide, 
oxygen and caroon monoxide were carried out systematically 
using a Hays' modification of the Or sat apparatus. Owing 
to the variaole operation or the discharge mechanism, 
measurements of the throughput were made over regular inter 
vals following the commencement of the discharge of the 
cnar. The period elapsing between the time when the dis¬ 
charge mechanism came into operation and the time when 
char commenced to be discharged varied, of course, with the 
throughput of the material. When discharge of material 
was commenced, coal and not char was, of course, removed 
from the retort. 

(a) In Hun 17, the retort having been heated to carbon 

ization temperature and then filled with coal, heating 
with natural gas was continued for one half hour, after 
which time the gas was turned off and the discharge mechan¬ 
ism started. Although in the initial period of a run, 
uncarbonized and later, partially-carbonized material is 
discharged, it is possiole by measuring the rate of dis¬ 
charge at this time to make a reasonable approximation of 
the rate of discharge which will be obtained over still 
later periods of operation. In this instance a measure 
of the rate of discharge during the first 55 minutes after 
turning off the gas indicated a rate of throughput of 180 
Ids. of coal per hour, which is some 20 lbs. per hour in 

































- 114 - 


excess of that desired. At the end of the 55 minutes, 
therefore, the discharge was stopped. After a period of 
20 minutes to allow of necessary adjustment of conditions 
in the retort the discharge was again started at a lower 
rate, which on measuring over the next 40 minutes was 
found to De 161 lbs. per hour which was approximately 
the rate desired. This rate was maintained throughout 
the remainder of the test while the discharge was in 
operation. 

Experience having shown that when the flue gas 
temperature commenced to fall rapidly, the period during 
which the retort would operate further was very limited. 
'After three hours of operation, the average flue gas temp¬ 
erature having fallen from S20°C. to 600°G., it was decided 
at this stage to discontinue the discharge of the char 
and to raise the flue gas temperature by again heating 
the retort with natural gas. After a period of one hour 
the flue gas temperature had risen to S60oC. At this stage 
the bulk of the volatile matter in the coal had been driven 
off and burned, the remaining volatile matter being in¬ 
sufficient to maintain operating temperatures. It was, 
therefore, decided to again commence discharging the char 
and to turn off the supply of natural gas. Thereafter the 
caroonizer was allowed to run without further alterations 
to the discharge rate. It will be seen that shortly"after 
the recommencement of discharging, the temperatures of 
the Hue gases responded slightly oxfing, presumably, to

larger quantities of combustible gases from the coal 
burning in the retort flues. Table XXXII ana Figure XXXI 
show the results obtained in this run . 

As will be seen from Figure XXXI, 4 3/4 hours 
after the discharge was fixed at approximate! y 160 Ids. 
per hour, the flue gas temperatures had fallen rapidly to 
330°G., the flame in one ilue had expired and the flame 
in the other one was on the point of expiring. 

Figures XXXII and XXXIIi show the relationship 
of the carbon dioxide and the temperature respectively, to 
the oxygen contents of the waste gases. Referring to 
Figure XXXII it will be seen that a fair number of points 
fall below the curve which has been drawn as representing 
substantially complete combustion of the gases in the 
retort. The curve cuts the axis at 15 per cent, caroon 
dioxide and, of course, 21 per cent, oxygen. The points 
falling below this curve represent conditions where either 
the retort was heated with natural gas or where over 
one per cent, of carbon monoxide was present in the flue 
gases. 

In the combustion of a fuel, a diminishing 
caroon dioxide content in the combustion gases is indicative 
or Increasing quantities or excess air. Accordingly, m 
order to obtain a high thermal efficiency efforts must be 
made to control combustion conditions so as to maintain 
a high carbon dioxide content in the combustion gases and 
at the same time as low a flue gas temperature as possible,

commensurate xfith complete combustion of the fuel. When 
combustion is incomplete this is indicated by the presence 
of carbon monoxide in combustion gases. The carbon monoxide 
may be accompanied by appreciable quantities of hydrogen 
and possibly hydrocarbons. The quantities of the latter 
gases are not usually determined because the determination 
involves explosion as well as absorption analysis. 

In this experimental run, apart from the 
carbon monoxide in the flue gases, combustion of the 
distilled gases apparently was complete, save when operating 
conditions were abnormal, that is at times represented by 
points falling below the curve in Figure XXXII. Sven when 
oxygen which, of course, represents excess air falls to as 
low as six per cent., the combustion was fairly complete 
apart from the gases represented by the carbon monoxide. 

The amount of oxygen in the- flue gases, 
that is to say the amount of excess air, can be related 
to the waste gas temperature as in Figure XXXIII. Again 
it will be seen that a fairly large number of points are 
above the straight portion of the curve in the graph and 
that these points represent periods in the run which fall 
below the line in Figure XXXII, that is to say periods 
when abnormal conditions of operations applied such as when 
the retort was being heated with natural gas or shortly 
after such a heating period. With regard to the point 
representing one hour after commencement of operation.

•since in this case there was a large production of carbon 
monoxide, this naturally is represented on a position 
falling below the curve* 

(b) Run number IS was a repetition of run number 17 

except that the period between charging the retort with coal 
and the commencement of operation of the discharge mechanism 
was varied. It was recognized that if reasonably high flue 
gas and carbonization temperatures were to be attained, the 
coal undergoing carbonization in the initial periods must 
not lose too large a quantity of volatile matter before the 
discharge was started and an approach made to steady con¬ 
ditions of carbonization. Accordingly, during the first 
part of the run when the flue temperatures had fallen rapidly, 
in an effort to regain high temperatures in the retort, the 
discharge was turned off and the retort heated with natural 
gas. The discharge was started before the flue gas temper¬ 
ature had passed its peah and the flue gas temperature 
commenced to fall again due to the excessive loss of the 
volatile matter from the stationary coal in the retort. 
Unfortunately, the oxygen of the waste gases under these 
conditions fell to a very low figure so that it seemed 
possible that combustion of the whole of the volatile matter 
distilled from the coal might be far from complete. There¬ 
after, the retort was run with a constant air supply and 
discharge rate until the temperatures fell so low that the 
flames in the flues expired. The results are shown in 
Table XXXIII and Figure XXXIV.

No explanation can be given of the high carbon 
monoxide content in the waste gases between third and fifth 
hours of operation. This may be due to low temperatures 
in the retort flues or may represent unusual conditions 
of coal distillation. 

The relation of caroon dioxide and flue gas temper¬ 
ature to the oxygen contents of the flue gases are shown 
in Figures XXXV and XXXVI, respectively. Comparing Figure 
XXXV with Figure XXXII it will be seen that the curve on 
Figure XXv falls appreciably below the one in Figure XXXII, 
the distance between the curves increasing asthe Quantity 
of excess air increases. The curve on Figure XXXV has been 
drawn as reasonably representative of the points on the 
graph and the scattering is no doubt due to the presence 
of unburned gas. The origins of the curves on Figures XXXII 
and XXXV must obviously oe the same for theoretical air 
conditions, that is to say at 15 per cent, carbon dioxia.e. 

With regards to Figure XXXVI, as far as the points 
falling below six per cent, oxygen are concerned, that 
representative of 4-f hours can be ascribed to low temper¬ 
atures and the high carbon monoxide content of the waste 
gases; with respect to the positions at 1/2, 1 and 11/2 
hours, at these times, although the volume of gas from the 
freshly charged retort was nigh, due to the high temper¬ 
atures in the flues through the heating with natural gas, 
combustion conditions were good and in spite of the high 
volume of gas, the carbon monoxide content was low.

c) In order to confirm the conslusions arrived 

at from tne results of the two preceding runs, four further 
trial runs x*rere made with variations on throughput and 
air supply* The results obtained are shown in Tables 
XXXIV to XXXVII and Figures XXXVII, XL, XLIII and XLVI. 

Figures XXXVIII, XLI, XLIV and XLVil show that 
in all four experimental runs, combustion of the volatile 
matter was substantially complete but over the entire 
periods of runs there were progressive increases in the 
oxygen content and hence the quantity of excess air in 
the Hue gases. Figures XXXIX, XLI I, XLV and XLVI 11 show 
that at the initial stages of the runs there was a consid¬ 
erable shortage of excess air, but that after a period of 
two hours excess air conditions gave straight line relation¬ 
ships with the flue gas temperatures. It will be noted also 
that, as the rate of air supply per pound of coal increased, 
the curves tended to move to the right, that is representing 
an increase in the quantity of excess air.

The ultimate composition and the calorific 
values of the coal used and or the char produced by 
carbonization of it in the pilot plant may be used to show 
the considerations which govern the continuous operation 
of the process. The analysis of the char obtained in 
Hun No. 9 (Series 2, Page 93) may be employed for this 
purpose. The sample of char analysed represented the 
material obtained during the last one and one-half hours 
of operation during this run. The yield of char, as 
determined directly by weighing was 55*1 per cent. The 
data are given in Table XXXVIII.

Figure XLIX shows the relationship of the carbon 
dioxide in the combustion gases to the excess air quantities. 

In order to calculate the heat losses in the flue gases the 
mean specific heats of the water vapor and the dry combustion 
gases between 200°C. (392°F.) and 1000°C. (l832°F.) are taken 
respectively as 0.4g and 0.24-1. 

The heat loss due to water vapor in the combustion 
gases = Weight of Water x ((212 - t) -f 970 7* 0.4-B (T - 212)) B.t.u* 
The heat loss in the dry chimney ga.ses = 

Weight of gas x (T - t) z 0*24-1 B.t.u. 

Where T is the temperature of the exit gases 
and t is the atmospheric temperature. 

The total heat losses in the flue gases may now be 
calculated for flue gas temperatures of 200°0. and 1000°C 
respectively, with excess air quantities in stages 02 20 per 
cent, up to 100 per cent. These calculations follow: 

With theoretical air and with a waste gas temperature 
of 200°0., the heat loss in the water vapor = 

0.419 (212 - 80 + 970 ■» 0.4S ( 392 - 212)) = 49g B.t.u.

Figure L shows the total heat loss in the flue gases 
plotted against the temperature of the flue gases for differ¬ 
ent quantities of excess air. 

The total heat developed in the retort is equivalent 
to the net heat value of the coal less the net heat value of 
the char produced from it. Thus assuming complete combustion,

the heat released per pound of coal carbonized equals 
7660 - (0*551 x 1122>0) = l44o B.t.u. Of the heat developed, 
a certain quantity is lost as sensible heat in the char, as 
radiation from the plant and as heat which may be required 
for carrying through the reactions during the actual carbon¬ 
ization of the coal. After allowance is made for these losses, 
the remaining heat can be divided between the heat required 
in the process and that passing out of the retort in the flue 
gases. 

Efforts have been made to determine the extent 
of the former losses as accurately as possible. No heat is 
recovered as air preheat after the char enters the water 
jacketed cooler. If it is assumed that the temperature at 
which the char enters the cooler is 500 °G. and that the mean 
specific heat of the char is 0.4 the sensible heat lost in 
the char is (932 - go) 0.4 x 0.551 - 1&7 B.t.u. 

The radiation losses of the plant have been est¬ 
imated to be 72 B.t.u. per lb. of coal carbonized at a coal 
throughput of 65 lbs. per hour. 

It has already been mentioned that Holdings and 
Cobb have shown that with high oxygen containing coals, exothermic 
reactions occur at low temperatures of carbonization. Estim¬ 
ation of the actual amounts of heat generated by such reactions 
presents considerable difficulties. An examination of the 
literature indicates that according to the most careful 
measurements by Davis, Place and Edeburn (17) the exothermicity 

























- 152 - 


of the hind of coal used in these carbonization experiments 
would amount to approximately 40 B.t.u. per lb. of dry coal 
or 9 ) x 4o « 30 B.t.u. This quantity receives 

general confirmation from the results of experiments by Burhe 
and Parry on the Keat Distillation of Various Types of Coal (l£). 

Summarizing, the total heat available in the car¬ 
bonization of one pound of coal, assuming complete combustion 
of the volatile matter is thus 

l44o - (1S7 * 72) 4- 30 = 1211 B.t.u. 

Figure L shows a relationship of the flue gas 
temperatue to the total heat loss in the flue gases with 
different quantities of excess air. Across the figure is 
drawn a line for 1211 B.t.u. per lb., which represents the 
total heat available for carbonization and drying. Any 
plant conditions which can be represented on the figure by a 
point above the line drawn across the figure will indicate 
conditions under which it is not possible for this plant to 
continue to operate since too great a quantity of heat is 
being lost in the flue gases and accordingly drying and 
carbonization cannot continue; for example, if, when the 
plant, was approaching a steady state of carbonization the 
temperature of the waste gases was 2>00°C. and the amount of 
excess air was 20 per cent., then unless the waste gas temp¬ 
erature fell to a region of 650°C., the process must inevitably 
stop. An increase in the quantity of water in the coal will 
mean a depression of this line of total availaole heat so

that naturally a condition must arise eventually at which the 
plant ceases to function. The waste gases must, in any case, 
leave the plant at temperatures in excess of 212°F., that is 
above the dew point. 

Although the actual rate of air supply may be 

varied, the temperature of the flue gases will obviously vary 

principally according to the calorific intensity of the 

combustion gases in the region of carbonization. Accordingly, 

it should be possible to draw a second line parallel to the 

heat loss in the flue gas axis, to the right of which will 

be represented a region in which the temperatures of carbon- 

and 

ization will be such as to produce combustible gas/to the 
left of which, owing to the lower temperatures of carboniz¬ 
ation and the consequent production of gas from the coal of 
high carbon dioxide content, combustion cannot occur in the 
cmstomary plant conditions of air supply. 

In order to obtain some estimate of the probable 
temperature in the carbonization zone, the Rosin IT diagram 
has been employed. Since this diagram is based on the net 
calorific value of the fuels it has seemed reasonable to use 
the net calorific value of the volatile matter, namely, 

144*0 B.t.u, per lb. coal and the dry flue gas quantities 
with different amounts of excess air. For different quantities 
of excess air it is possible to calculate the calorific 
intensities and to read the corresponding flame temperatures 
from the diagram.

The variation of the flame temperatures with varying 
amounts of excess air are shown in Figure LI. 

Since with larger quantities of excess air the flame 
temperatures are correspondingly lowered, if the carbon 
dioxide content of the flue gas continues to decrea.se, a 
condition must be reached when carbonization ceases more 
quickly than when a high percentage of the carbon dioxide in 
the flue gases is maintained, Under the latter conditions, 
heat transfer rates from hot gas to coal will be high end 
the actual rate of carbonization increased accordingly. 

The application of the above principles may be illustrated by 
considering them in relation to the results of the preceding 
runs. 

For example, if Figure XLII from Run 20 be compared 
with Figure XLVIII from Run 22, whereas in the former case 
the percentage of excess air as, indicated by the percentage 
of oxygen, varies only approximately between 12 and 14 per 
cent, in the latter case the variation is between approximately 
4 and 10 per cent. 

Referring to Figure L it will be seen, therefore, 
that in Run 2 2 the tendency is for a more pronounced movement 
toifards the heat loss axis than in Run 20. In Run 20 the 
tendency is for the changing conditions to be represented to 
a greater degree along the lines representing the particular 
excess a.ir quantity. 

Generalizing the situation, therefore, one may say 
that unless there is close control of the quantity of excess

air used in starting up the plant and in its continued oper¬ 
ation, a condition may be reached represented by a position 
above: the line oi‘ total available heat and with the temper¬ 
atures of the waste gases such that the carbonization of the 
coal is no longer producing an adequate quantity of suitable 
gas* In this event stoppage of the carbonization process is 
inevitable. 

If, however, there is control of the excess air 
quantities, whether these be well above what may be at the 
outset an economic rate, say 50 per cent., and the control is 
such as to be represented by descent along an excess air 
quantity line on Figure L, then presumably a condition will 
be attained below the line of total available heat at which 
the process will continue. 

( a) In order to provide the most favorable conditions 

for testing out the above considerations on the plant it was 
decided, at this stage, to reduce the water content of the 
coal as much as existing facilities permitted and then to 
operate the plant, so adjusting the air supply that a high 
carbon dioxide content was present in the waste gases. Approx¬ 
imately 1700 pounds of coa~l were elevated on to the top of 
the boiler setting in the Power House and allowed to remain 
there for 36 hours. Unfortunately at the end of this period 
a slight quantity of the coal fired and the remainder had to be 
quickly removed and stored over night. A sample of the 
partially-dried material gave a moisture content of 16.6 per 


cent 





- 164 - 


The coal rate and air rate at the commencement of 
run 23 were adjusted to give approximately 65 pounds per hour 
and 20 cubic feet per minute respectively. Measurement of the 
coal rate, from the start of discharge of the char over a 
period of three hours, showed a throughput of 77*7 lb* oer 
hour. An adjustment to the discharge was made which gave a 
rate which was later measured as 67.2 lbs. per hour and this 
rate was then maintained for the remainder of the operating 
period. 

A minimum carbon dioxide content of 10 per cent, 
was selected and adjustments of the air rate were made in 
steps from 20 c.f.m. to ip, 12 1 / 2 , 7 l /2 and 5 respectively 
to maintain this quantity. Measurements of the air rate below 
5 c.f.m. were difficult because of the limited calibration 
of the rotameter at the zero end of the scale. After the 
final setting of the air rate at 5 c.f.m. and of the discharge 
rate 20 minutes later, no further adjustments to the conditions 
of the plant were thought necessary. The results of this run 
are shown in Table XL VI and Figure LI I. 

It will be seen that after the final adjustments 
were made, apart from one rather sharp drop of two per cent, 
in the caroon dioxide content of the waste gases, the general 
tendency of the carbon dioxide content was to increase 
slightly over the last eight hours of the test. The carbon 
dioxide content over this period ranged approximately from 
ten to twelve per cent, representing an excess air quantity 
of 70 to 4o per cent. 

After the attainment of a maximum some one and 
one—half hours after starting up the plant, the ^lue gas

temperature fell consistently over a period, of about twelve 
hours, with the exception of relatively short periods during 
which the temperatures remained approximately constant due 
probably, to the adjustment of air and discharge rates, uver 
approximately the last three hours of the run the flue gas 
temperature was substantially constant at 3&0°G. Over this 
period also, there was present in the waste gases slightly 
more than one per cent, carbon monoxide. The temperatures as 
measured o y T4 remained suost anti ally constant during this 
time. 

Figure Llii, relating the percentage or oxygen to 
caroon dioxide in the waste gases shows that the points 
representing the various readings are grouped in the area from 
five to seven per cent, oxygen and ten to twelve per cent, 
caroon dioxide. 

Figure hiV shows the relation of the excess air to 
the flue temperature. 

Since the flue temperatures over the period of the 
run, following the plant adjustments, fell steadily in the 
region of about six per cent, oxygen, not only over this 
period is the condition following substantially the line on 
Figure L representing 50 per cent, excess air, out the end 
conditions of carbonization as shown by Figure L represents 
an accumulation of available heat in the caroonizer in excess 
of the total heat required for carbonizing end drying. 

Reference to Figure LI suggests that the temperature 
in txde vicinity of the carbonization zone is in.the naghbor- 
hood of 1250°0. With the amount of heat in excess of tnat

required for the process, presumably increasing quantities of 
volatile matter are being evolved, from tne coal, and the 
excess air is being correspondingly reciucea as shown by the 
increasing carbon dioxide content oi the gas. The temperature 
in the flue in the vicinity of carbonization is slowly increas¬ 
ing despite the fact that over a considerable period of the 
run the waste gas temperature is falling. 

This run, in which operating conditions were 
reasonably steady for the last ten hours of operation, indicated 
that at least with partially dried coal, carbonization in this 
retort could be maintained for that length of time. The plant 
was shut down because of the limited quantity of partially 
dried coal and because no provision was made to operate the 
retort continuously. 

(b) The successful operation of the retort in the 

preceding run, using partially-dried coal made desirable a run 
under similar conditions using the coal in the uridried condition. 
Tne intention throughout was again to maintain the carbon 
dioxide content of the flue gas at a minimum of ten per cent. 

The results of the run are shown in Table XLVI1 and Figure LV. 

With an air rate initially at 25 c.f.m. and reduced 
after one and one half hours to 12*5 c.f.m, the carbon dioxide 
content of the waste gases averaged about 12 per cent for six 
hours out thereafter this increased slowly and when the plant 
was eventually shut down it had reached 14 per cent. _ne 
measured throughput rate, over a period oi three hours,was 65 
pounds per hour out it must be understood that unis simply

(a) Run 25 

In this run, the rate of excess air quantities, as 
determined by the percentage of carbon dioxide in the flue 
gases was varied as far as possible in a regular manner. 

At the outset it was decided to operate with the 
carbon dioxide in the waste gases in excess of ten per cent., 
i.e. with an excess air quantity less than about 70 per cent.

Reference to Figure L shows that with a flue gas temperature 
of approximately 600 ^ 0 . ~J0 per cent excess air represents the 
maximum excess air quantity allowable for plant operation. 

Since a throughput rate of approximately 70 pounds per hour 
had been siiox-ra with both partially-dried and undried material 
to be satisfactory over a working day, this rate was decided 
on for a long period run. 

The period of time from the starting up to the 
shutting down of the plant was 76 hours. During the test, 
half-hourly readings were taken of the flue gas temperatures 
and of the temperatures in the coal stream as measured by 
T4, 5 and 6. The flue gases were analyzed every half hour 
for carbon dioxide, oxygen and carbon monoxide contents. After 
a period of 21 hours, when it was considered that steady 
operational conditions had been obtained, measurements were 
made of the weight of char every half hour. Samples of ciiar 
were taken immediately preceding the alteration of the air 
supply as representative of the char produced during a period 
with a selected air supply. 

eventually, some hours before shutting down the plant, 
the air supply was greatly increased and under these conditions, 
prior to the conclusion of the run, the flames expired in one 
of the flues as has already been reported as occurring in 
earlier experiments. Throughout the whole period of the run 
the pressures in the retort were maintained substantially 
constant. Since actual readings taken during the test are 
very numerous, these are not recorded in the tnesis but are presented 
graphically in Figure LVI.

The following observations can be drawn from the 
results of this run: 

1 . Provided close control is maintained so that the quantity 

of excess air used is not excessive the plant can be operated 
quite satisfactorily for long periods. In this run the total 
period was approximately 76 hours, at the end of which time 
the plant was shut down purposely. 

2 . A3.though no actual mechanical difficulties occurred with 
the discha.rge mechanism, it will be seen from Figure LVI 
that the actual discharge rate was variable and that, with 
the exception of a period of about two hours when a very 
marked variation occurred, the average variation was about 
four pounds per hour, equivalent to an average variation of 
approximately ten per cent, of the coal throughput. Although 
it is not possible from Figure LVI to correlate the variations 
in the discharge re,te with the variations in the carbon 
dioxide content in the flue gases, oresumaomy with a constant 
air supply the variation of the discharge rate is the

principle reason for the variation in tne caroon dioxide 
content. 'Tiie variations in tne discharge rate indicate 
that if the plant should be designed on a larger scale 
considerable attention should oe paid to the design of a 
discharge mechanism which would give smoother operations. 

3. The variation of the caroon dioxide content or tne waste 
gases with a constant air supply averages approximately two 
per cent, except during the period when an excessive amount 
or air was used:. Tne oxygen contents of the flue gases 
correlate satisfactorily with the carbon dioxide contents. 

4. The carbon monoxide content of the flue gases varied between 
0.2 and 0.8 per cent. In general, the caroon monoxide content 
decreased as the air supply increased, due principally to 
direct dilution and possibly, in part, to the greater avail¬ 
ability of oxygen. 

5 . The relationship between the quantity of air supplied and 
the flue temperature is not sufficiently precise to allow of 
a conclusive, correlation. Generally speeding, over a fairly 
long period of operation, the flue gas temperature tended to 
rail oy about 100°G. but when the air was increased, the 
temperature increased rapidly by 100°0. and thereafter, 
with increasing air supply, the temperature fell slowly. In 
general, the flue gas temperatures throughout the run were 
approximately 600°C. At this average temperature, JO per 
cent, excess air must not be exceeded if the plant is to 
continue satisfactorily in operation for any considerable time.

6. It will be notea that in tne final period. with the use of 
a large quantity of excess air, widen the flame in one flue 
expired, the carbon dioxide content of the combined gases 
from the two flues increased.. This occurrence has been 
commented, on previously. Jhe increased carbon dioxide 
content is due probably to improved combustion conditions 

in the one flue in which active combustion is still maintained 
and to the evolution of the large quantities of carbon dioxide, 
in the flue in which the flame has expired. 

7. The calorific values for the four samples of char do not show 

any 

sufficiently wide differences to allow/conclusion to be drawn 
from them, but differences in the volatile contents are prob¬ 
ably of some significance. The samples pay be considered to 
be representative of reasonably steady operating conditions 
on the plant with the air rates shown. 

Reference to Figure IV shows that while variations 
in the calorific values of chars, produced from coals of a similar 
type between 5Q0°G. and 600°0. differed only by about 300 3.t.u. 
per lb., the volatile matter content varied between S and 14 per 
cent. These variations are of the order of those obtained with 
the above samples. In the above run the higher volatile matter 
content is obtained with tne highest air supply and trie explan¬ 
ation may lie in that with a higher rate or air supply, a lower 
calorific intensity and flame temperature is obtained and the 
temperature of carbonization decreased accordingly. In snore, 
the data in Table XLIX are of the order which might be 
anticipated. 

it should be pointea out that with an air rate of

1 ( c.i'.ra. the plant dia not operate for any substantial length, 
of time but that at 15 c.f.m. operation was possiole so that under 
these conditions of plant operation the limiting percentage of 
the volatile matter in the char would appear to be about 13 per 
cent. Whether this is the limiting volatile matter ofthe char 
which can be produced with this plant could not be determined 
until a further long period run was carried out with varying rates 
of discharge of char. 

(b) To cfefcenfiine the maximum throughput of the retort 

a second long run was made in which the throughput was successively 
increased with a corresponding increase in air supply such as to 
maintain the desired carbon dioxide content in the waste gases. 

The results obtained in this run are shown in Figure LVII. 

initially, the plant was started up at the same rate 
as in run 25, i.e. at about 75 Ids. coal per hour. However, in 
this run the initial heating of the retort with natural gas was 
to a much lesser extent and some four hours-had elapsed perore 
operations became normal, i.e. until the carbon dioxide content 
in tne flue gases had risen to the order of 15 pen cent, or in 
excess of that amount. 

After a total period of operation of approximately 
9 hours, the coal rate was increased from 75 ' co 92 Ids. per hour. 
This rate was continued for 10 hours. It should be noted that 
the flue gas temperature fell over the whole of this period, and 
that the temperature as measured by T.G. 4 increased by about 
100°C. indicating the falling of the zone of highest temperatures 


in the coal stream.

Over tnis period the car do n dioxide contents oi' tne 
flue gases nad risen at times to over lb per cent, tne oxygen 
content nad rarlen to as low as one naif of one per cent* and 
tne carbon monoxide content avera.gea approximately one per cent, 
it oeing considered that a careful increase in tne excess air 
might reduce tne carbon monoxide content of the waste gases, 
the air supplied was stepped up on two separate occasions. These 
increases in excess air resulted in a fall in the carbon monoxide 
content in the first stage but later the carbon monoxide again 
increased in amount to about one per cent. With the second 
increase in air supply the temperature at T.G. 4 increased by 
approximately 60 °C. and the flue temperatures which had fallen 
steadily throughout the run to 320 °C. at this point rose to 
400°C. 

During the next period of seven hours the retort was 
operated at an increased rate of 121 lbs. coal per hour, the air 
during this time being correspondingly increased. The flue gas 
temperatures rose fairly rapidly a further 100°G. to approximately 
500 °G. and this temperature was maintained to the end of the 
test some l4 hours later. Apart from variations in the carbon 
dioxide content in the gas of about two per cent, and variations 
in the caroon monoxide content from one to as low as C.2 per cent., 
flue gas conditions over the next seven hours remained approx¬ 
imately the same but the temperature at T.G. 4 fell by about 
100°C., the lower temperature being attained after about tnree 
hours and. thereafter remaining constant. Finally, in the last 
stage of the test with a coal rate of 144 lbs. coal per hour, 





i.e # almost double that at the Initial stages and of course 
with a corresponding increase in air supply, the plant operated 
for approximately five hours at the end of which time the flames 
expired in both flues and the plant was shut down. 

The shut down of the plant was very rapid. Over the 
last two hours of the test the carbon dioxide content of the 
flue gases fell very quickly, although the flue gas temperature 
was maintained to within about 1/2 hour of the shut down of the 
plant, whilst the temperature at T.C. 4 fell rapidly over the 
last 11/2 hours. The low carbon monoxide figure over this 
period appears to be due to dilution. 

Prior to any changes of throughput samples of the 
char discharged were taken over a period of one hour of operation. 
The results of the analyses of these samples are shown in Table L. 

The operation of the retort is dependent on a number 
of factors such as the rate of throughput, the rate of air supply, 
and the temperature of distillation of the coal which last faxtor 
in conjunction with the rate of air supply, determines the 
composition of the flue gases and also their volume and temper¬ 
ature. These in turn determine the quantity of heat transferred 
to the coal stream. It ispossible to interpret the results which 
have been obtained in relation to Figure IV which shows the 
results of the earlier work of the Mines Branch in Ottawa (6) 
obtained by the caroonization of Black Diamond Coal under 
laboratory conditions. From this figure data have been calculated 
which show the variation of the volatile matter and calorific 
value of the char over the temperature range from 350°C. to 
700°C., on the dry ash-free basis. The data are given in Table LI

Making allowances for differences in the methods 
of carbonization in the two c ases and for possible variations 
in the samples of coal used, it is considered that the results 
obtained in Hun 2 6 can be compared with those shown in Table LI. 
When the volatile matter contents and calorific values on a 
dry, ash-free basis in Table L are related to the curves in 
Figure LVIII they take up the positions shown respectively at 























- 188 -

A, B, C, D, these letters corresponding to the sample numbers 
in Table L . It will be seen that the order of the positions 
on the two curves is the same. If, with respect to a particular 
section of Run 26 a mean line be drawn between the position on 
the volatile matter curve and the position on the calorific 
value curve, perpendicular to the temperature axis, this gives 
an approximation to the mean temperature of carbonization to 
which the coal over this period of the run has been subjected. 

It will be seen that for samples A, B, G, D, these temperatures 
are respectively 500 , 530 , 455 and 395 ° 0 . 

It should be recognized that these are simply 
representative temperatures and not the actual temperatures. 

That these are simply representative is substantiated by an 
examination of the actual curves obtained in Run 26 as shown 
on Figure LVII for it will be seen that with a coal throughput 
of 92 lbs. per hour and with the lowest excess air quantity, the 
flue gas temperatures were approaching 300 °G. but at higher rates 
of air supply the temperatures approached 400°C. When, however, 
the coal rate was increased to 120 lbs. per hour the temper¬ 
ature rose to 500 °G. and despite the high carbon dioxide 
content in the flue gases, the heat losses in these gases must 
have been substantially increased. 

The latter state of affairs is represented by position 
3 in Figure LVIII; the coal was presumably subjected to a carbon¬ 
ization temperature of 530°G.- In the earlier period, represented 
by position A, larger quantities of heat were lost in the flue 
gases and conceivably this is coincident with the treatment 
which, in Figure LVIII, was represented at A by a temperature 
of 500 °C. 














- 190 - 


When the rate of throughput was increased to 121 
Ids. of coal per hour, it will be seen that the curves in 
Figure LVIII, representing the volatile matter content and 
calorific values in tne char produced, become steeoer, 
i.e. for equal temperature differences there is an increase 
in the rate at which the volatile matter content increases 
ana the calorific values of the char produced falls. Eventually, 
when the coal rate was increased to 144 lbs. per hour as 
represented Dy position D in Figure LVIII, the quantity and 
quality of the volatile matter distilled from the coal was 
reduced to such a degree that continued operation of the process 
was impossible. 

In the actual operation of the plant, a caroon dioxide 
content in the flue gases in excess or about fifteen per cent, 
may be ootained when tne coal is carbonized at the lower temper¬ 
atures. At these temperatures the relative proportions or 
caroon dioxide derived from tne combustion of the volatile 
material and the carbon dioxide derived as such from the 
distillation of the coal are altered and the ratio of these 
two quantities decreases. 

This may be explained in a rather different way by 
saying that under conoiitions in which the throughput begins 
to exceed 92 lbs. of coal per hour, the length of the zone over 
which gases containing large volumes of carbon dioxide are 
produced, is increased and consequently with a diminishing 
amount of available heat, the heat transferred to the charge is 
reduced accordingly, resulting in a higher heat loss in the 
waste gases. Presumably a time is reached when the zone, from

which gases containing large quantities of carDon dioxide are 
evolved, is so extensive that comoustion or the gas even under 
the best conditions or air supply becomes impossible because 
the limit of inflammability is exceeded. 

The addition of inert gases to combustible gases 
materially alters the limits of inflammability ( 19 ), the curves 
ror the limits of inflammability with varying percentages of 
combustible gases in the mixtures being thrown towards the 
higher limit, i.e. larger quantities of combustible gases are 
required for the mixtures to oe inflammable when consio.erable 
quantities oi' non combustible gases are present. In simplest 
terms the effect is to blanket the flame and extinguish it. 

Considering the results or this run as a whole one 
must conclude that the maximum throughput of the run is about 
92 Ids. or coal per hour. Generalizing, the maximum throughput 
of the plant is in the region of IOC lbs. of coal per hour but 
this throughput would be obtained only by a careful control of 
operating conditions.

VI. CONCLUSIONS 


1. The pilot-plant-scale, low-temperature caroon- 
ization retort described in this thesis will operate contin¬ 
uously for considerable periods of time to produce from a 
low-rank suboituminous coal (Black Diamond,Edmonton), yields 
of char from approximately 50 to 3 b per cent, by weight of 

the coal carbonized, containing approximately 8 to 10 per cent, 
of volatile matter respectively. 

2. For continuous operation as low an excess air 
quantity for combustion of the volatile matter as possible 
should be employed. It has been shown that quantities of excess 
air of the order of less than five per cent., which quantity 
corresponds to fifteen per cent, carbon dioxide in the flue 
gases, gives good operating conditions. with a very wide 
range of excess air quantities the amount of undeveloped heat 
due to carbon monoxide surviving in the flue gases does not 
vary greatly. The carbon monoxide content throughput is of 

the order of one-half to one per cent. It is not clear as to 
the zone from which this carbon monoxide arises. If the carbon 
monoxide survives from the early stages of carbonization, in 
the upper regions of the caroonizer, its survival can well be 
understood. 

3. For further development of this system or 
carbonization, the satisfactory utilization of the waste heat 
Is a matter of importance. This waste .heat could be utilized 
for providing natural draft thus probably dispensing with 


; 3u‘v:r' J'.'.u. i: 






jeo * ‘ ■ . ■ ■ 

















existing forced, and induced draft fans. An aluernative would 
be its use for preheating air for combustion purposes, out the 
effect of preheating the air on the throughput of the plant 
and upon the nature of the product requires further invest¬ 
igation. The heat in the waste gases might alternatively be 
utilized for predrying the coal prior to its passage to tne 
caroonizer. The utilization of the waste heat for the pre¬ 
drying of the coal would presumably have a marked effect upon 
operating conditions. For reasons which are not understood 
in the one run in which considerably less moisture was present 
in the coal, the flue temperatures were lower than when coal 
of normal moisture content was employed.. These methods of 
waste heat utilization are subjects suitable for further in¬ 
vestigation. 

4. The throughput of the plant is related to the 
quality of the char. Under good operating conditions the 
■plant will carbonize approximately 21 1/2 hundredweights per 
24 hour day. Development of this system of carbonization to 
a point at which industrial operation might be considered, 
depends obviously not simply on a multiplication of a unit 
of present dimensions, out on the -redesigning of this unit, in 
such a way as to provide tne basic constructional data for a 
plant to work on the industrial scale. Initially, the question 
of suitable materials of construction would have to be determined 
and thereafter it is conceivable that the throughput of the 
caroonizer would oe increased perhaps by designing a battery 
broadly on the lines of a conventional modern by-product coke 


oven 











- 194 - 


5 * With regard to the specific constructional 
features of the pilot plant: 

(a) Over the whole of the experimental period ciescrioed, the 
carborundum Daffies and end plates have showed very little 
wear and have proved entirely satisfactory. This does not 
apply to the end plates made of n Plicast n which periodically 
gave rise to trouole oiling to breakage. 

{ b) In any new design arrangements should oe made i'or contin¬ 
uous feed of coal'to the charging hopper. 

(c) The existing discharge mechanism operates at a. rather 
variable rate and in any new design efforts should be made to 
design a discharge mechanism which wouid give more regular 
working. 

{ d) The cooling system might also receive attention since 
occasionally difficulty has been met in cooling the charge 
sufficiently to prevent the cnar firing upon discharge. 

6 . In the matter of the redesigning of tne plant, 
experiments should be ma.de previously on the flow of material 
m a oafrle system or the type employed and of the influence 
of the fineness of division or coal on such flow. Experiments 
of a rela.tively simple na/cure could be designed to determine 
the maximum allowable clistance for free flow of material of 
varying size. 

7 . On the several occasions when wet coal was in¬ 
advertently introduced into the retort, free flow- of the coal 
was impeded and operation of trie retort ceased. Even an amount 
of superficial water of only two per cent, was found to cause 
choking of the plant. This is one of the severe limitations

VII. Gomparision of Performance of tne Research 
Council. Experimental Plant with that of tne Lurgi Plant 

at Bienfait 

Finally, it nas oeen tnougnt desirable to mane some 
oroad comparison Detween tne resuius of tne n.u.A. experiments 
ana tne results ootainea on tne estaolisnea Lurgi process 
wnien is in operation in.Sfuthern Sasxa tone wan lor a like 
purpose. 

Full details of tne Bienfait plant are not avaiiaole, 
duu it is understood me Lurgi plant will not operate satis¬ 
factorily with material less than one quarter inch mesh size. 

This can readily 'be understood since in the Lurgi there is a 
large and deep bed of material undergoing treatment and the 
satisfactory operation depends on the free passage of gas 
through such a bed, as in the case of a producer or to a lesser 
extent a boiler fire bed. The R*C.A. experimental plant is 
not subject to the same limitations and will carbonize satis¬ 
factorily material containing approximately 5° P er cent, by 
weight below one quarter inch mesh size. The limiting percentage 
of specific particle size with the R.G.A. plant has net been 
determined, but that material containing so la.rge a proportion 
of fine coal can be treated is a marked advantage as compared 
with a Lqrgi carbonizer.

It should be pointed out, however, that the present 
R.C.A. retort will obviously not threat pieces of coal of a 
size greater than the free distance between two successive 
baffles. Throughout the experimental work, although the coal 
had been screened at the mine to minus 3/^ inch mesh size, it 
was found necessary to rescreen it since it contained a few 
large pieces which could cause a blockage of the baffle system. 

In any'large scale plant it would be essential to install and 
carefully operate a plant for screening the coal prior to its 
carbonization. 

At this stage, any comparison of the cost of manufactur¬ 
ing briquettes from a char from the type of subbituminous coal 
used in the experimental retort with the cost of manufacture in 
the Lurgi process is previous, but an estimate may be of interest 
of the price at which coal would have to be purchased for use 
In the Lurgi system to make that system as economical as the 
R.C.A. plant. 

The following assumptions are made: 

1. That coal which can be treated by the R.C.A. plant at the 
present time Is almost a waste product at the subbituminous 
mines in Alberta. A reliable estimate of the value of this 
material is fl .25 per ton. Coal of the size which can be 
treated by the Lurgi plant, i.e. between 1/4- inch and 4 inches 
could presumably be costed at a higher figure. 

2. The yield of char on the Lurgi plant is per cent, as 
compared with the 5 0 pen cent, yield with the R.C.A. plant. 

3. In the Lurgi plant a yield of 5*^ gallons of tar per ton 
of coal is recovered and if the tar has a specific gravity of 












- 197 


one, the weight or tar per ton of lignite is 5 8 IDs. This 
58 Ids. or tar on distillation may oe considered to yield 
23*2 lbs. pitch and 4.0 gallons of tar acias. It is assume a 
that there is no surplus gas in the process. 

4. In briquetting, it is assumed that the same quantity of 
binder, this amount being 10 per cent., would De required for 
the chars from Doth the Lurgi and R.G.A. plants. Asphalt 
binder would oe used entirely in the R.U.A. plant but in the 
Lurgi plant it would be reduced by the amount of pitch recovered 
from tne carbonization process. The cost of asphalt binder is 

talien as 530.00 per ton. 

5 . The briquettes from both the Lurgi and R.U.A. plants would 
command the same market price, say 510.00 per ton. 

The positions of the two plants can be 
summarized as follows:

Per Ton of Coal as Carbonized 
Expenditures 


At this stage, the price of coal of suitable size for carbonization 
in a Lurgi plant being unknown will be taken as ,, x M . 


Lurgi 

R.C.A. 


Coal $ x 


$1.25 

Asphalt Binder used 0.048 

Pitch recovered 0.00116 

Asphalt purchased 0.0364 

at $30.00/ton $1.09 

0.050 tons 

0.050 tons 

$1.50 

Total $x 4 $1.09 


#2.75 


The income from the Lurgi plant exceeds the income from 
the R.C.A. plant by $0.18. Therefore, if the two plants are 
compared on this basis 

x 4 1.092 - 0.18 = 2.75 and x - 1.84 

i.e. for the Lurgi plant to. operate as advantageously as the R.C.A. 
plant the price of the much larger size coal that is used by that 
plant must not exceed $1.84 per ton. 

This conclusion is, of course, a very simplified state¬ 
ment itfhich takes no account of capital expenditures, interest and 
running costs. It is presented simply as indicating that the 
R.C.A. plant offers some possibilities, provided a design can be 
evolved which will allow of operations on a large scale a.s 
advantageously as is indicated by the experimental work described 


in this thesis.
