COMBUSTION CHARACTERISTICS OF ALBERTA COALS

FOR USE IN AUTOMATIC DOMESTIC STOKERS 


INTRODUCTION 

Object of Tests * A tendency of the age, the elimination of trouble 
wherever possible, has led to the increasing use of oil and gas for 
domestic heating. These fuels only require the turning of a tap 
instead of the shovelling of coal and ashes. House temperature con¬ 
trol by means of thermostats has made the operation of oil and gas 
furnaces almost automatic. 

Coal interests have met this actual and prospective loss of 
markets by the development of automatic domestic stokers. These 
stokers use a cheap size of coal and are very easily controlled by 
thermostats. However shovelling of coal is still necessary, although 
at less frequent intervals, and ashes must still be removed. 

Purchasers of stokers In eastern and central Canada are often told 
that only United States coals are suitable. Hence the installation of 
stokers there has done little for Albertans coal sales. 

This investigation therefore was undertaken to find Alberta 
coals suitable for use in the existing type of stokers. The 
investigation was not intended to test the efficiency of the stoker 
nor to devise possible improvements in stoker design. A study of the 
literature shows that the aim in the majority of stoker investigations 













- 2 - 

has been the study of the stoker rather than of the suitability of coals 
for stoker use* 

Construction and Operation of Stokers . There are two main types of 
stokers used on this continent, both of which have been developed 
mainly in the United States. The underfeed stoker was originally used 
principally with low volatile (non-coking) bituminous coals. It has 
since been modified to make it adaptable to many kinds of coal and is 
widely used right across the continent. The overfeed stoker was 
developed in the West to burn the free-burning western coals. 

In all stokers the coal is fed from a hopper into a retort in the 
furnace by means of a motor-driven auger. The same motor also supplies 
air for combustion by means of a fan. The motor is thermostatically 
controlled and thus the coal feed, and active combustion, only proceed 
when the house requires heat, although slow combustion by natural draft 
does proceed with the coal left in the furnace at the end of a firing 
period. Stokers are also equipped with an adjustable automatic hold-heat 
control which operates the stoker for a few minutes each hour in order 
to keep the coal alight in mild weather when the house temperature 
remains above the thermostat setting for long periods of time. 

The motor drives the coal feed auger through belt-driven pulleys 
and reducing gears. By changing the size of the pulleys the rate of 
coal feed can be suited to the heat needs of the house and to the 
calorific value of the coal. The air blast fan is connected directly 
to the motor shaft. Dampers are used to control the air blast to the 
retort area in the furnace to suit the coal feed. Some stokers, partic¬ 
ularly the underfeed type in which the combustion bed varies in thickness. 






- 3 - 


are equipped with an air flow damper which automatically opens wider as 
the combustion bed becomes thicker. 

With any stoker incombustible matter in the refuse must be removed 
either intermittently or continually from the retort. The regular 
procedure with the underfeed stoker is to remove the ash as clinker 
through the fire door by means of tongs, this being done from time to 
time as required. No other method of removal is commonly provided in 
the domestic sized models. In the overfeed stoker the refuse is pushed 
off the end of the retort by the advancing coal and is collected in an 
ash pit below the furnace. 

Characteristics of Stoker Coals . Desirable properties common to coals 
suited to either type of stoker are: freedom from dust, fly-ash,and 
smoke, proper coal-sizing, and the ability to stay alight in mild 
weather. There are specific differences however. In the underfeed the 
coal ash must form a clinker which is strong enough to permit removal, 
but porous enough to allow the passage of air for combustion to the 
unburned coal above the clinker ring. This requires that the fusibility 
of the coal ash must be within narrow limits. The ash percentage must 
also be moderately low since a high ash coal necessitates too frequent 
removal of clinker with consequent disturbance of combustion. 

The underfeed stoker can burn satisfactorily coals of a wide range 
in rank, if the ash content is moderately low and if the ash clinkers 
suitably. However a satisfactory performance is not obtained with a 
strongly coking coal. 

In the overfeed stoker the specifications for coal are notably less 
stringent than for the underfeed, but the coal must be free-burning!

otherwise a large proportion of unburned coal will drop into the ash 
pit. Although a low ash coal is desirable, a high ash coal can be 
burned in an overfeed stoker but requires more attention and more 
frequent emptying of the ash pit. For an overfeed stoker, the ash may 
be clinkering or non-clinkering, but trouble may result if the ash 
clinkers too readily. With such a coal an agglomeration of fused and 
unfused refuse may bridge the gap between the retort and the opposite 
wall of the furnace. This * clinker-bridge* blocks off the air supply 
and much of the coal fed on to the retort may drop into the ash pit 
unburned. 

r 

Development of Test Procedure . Before a coal was tested in either 
stoker a preliminary run was made to select a suitable coal feed and air 
setting. The test runs, which were then begun, were designed to study 
how the coal would behave in the stoker under the following three 
conditions: 

(a) Cold weather conditions. Will the coal burn at the necessary 
rate of operation without giving clinker trouble, excessive fly-ash or 
disturbed fuel bed conditions? 

(b) Medium winter weather conditions. Does the coal burn well 
without trouble of any kind? 

(c) Very mild weather conditions. Will the coal stay alight and 
burn up quickly again when the stoker only operates in response to the 
hold-heat control for a few minutes each hour? 

It was very difficult to ascertain typical conditions in houses, 
but test periodicities of stoker operation were decided upon as follows: 




















- 5 - 

(a) Cold weather - 15 minutes on and 15 minutes off. 

(b) Medium winter weather - 10 minutes on and 30 minutes off. 

(c) Very mild weather - 2 minutes on and 58 minutes off. 

Published work on stoker tests indicates that the usual method of 

operation in testing stokers is to use continuous operation. In the 
few cases where intermittent operation was used, a certain rate was 
apparently selected with no particular typical household periodicity in 
mind • 

For this investigation a recording device was put on two residential 
stokers: on an overfeed stoker during the winter of 1943-44 and on an 
underfeed stoker in the winter of 1944-45. The results from this 
periodicity recorder indicate that the original choice of the three 
periodicities listed above is reasonable. 

Special Features. These included investigations of: 

(1) Clinkering characteristics of the ash, involving chemical 
analyses, fusion tests, physical studies of clinkers, blending of coals 
and the chemical treatment of coals, and coal washing. 

(2) Fly-ash and dust - this included oiling of coals to reduce dust 
and the design of a flue trap to catch fly-ash. 

(3) Smoke- an apparatus has been built which measures quantitatively 
the amount of smoke given off by a coal during its combustion.

CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDING 

No accommodation could be found on the university campus to house 
the equipment for this investigation. A small temporary building, of a 
size suitable for a garage so that it could be sold later as such, 
therefore was erected just north of the main laboratories of the Research 
Council. 

The floor plan of this building is shown.in Figure I. It was 
erected by a contractor and has shiplap and cedar drop-siding walls, a 
double pitch shingle roof, and no floor. Two garage-sized windows were 
put in the south side of the building and a three foot door in the east 
side. Two coal bins, each built to hold a ton of coal, were built inside 
the building against the south wall and were fitted with lids and coal 
openings. Another bin was later placed outside but was used only 
occasionally. 

In designing the chimney it was deemed necessary to have a separate 
flue of eight by eight inch tile (inside measurement) for each of the 
two furnaces. It was also thought advisable to separate these two flues 
by a four inch brick wall. Thus the tiles were enclosed with a four 
inch wall of bricks and were separated by a four inch thickness of 
brickwork. 

The available formulae for calculating chimney heights for a selected 
cross sectional area are not applicable to chimneys of less than 
thirty-five feet. A brick chimney this height could not have been built- 
except at great cost. An approximate calculation using the formula on 
page 84 of Speers, H.M., Technical Data on Fuel (3rd edition) for the 
estimated draft needs of the furnaces, gave twenty-five feet as the 




- 7 - 

least possible height for the chimney. The bricklayer advised that 
twenty-five was the maximum height that the building could support. 
Accordingly a twenty-five foot double flue chimney was erected, 
although it was expected that it would have to have a temporary extension 
if stoker tests were to be carried on in warm weather. Such proved the 
case, and an eight foot length of galvanized sheet iron pipe was added 
to each flue of the chimney, these being fastened to the projections 
of tile left for the purpose. 

In making the approximate calculation noted above recognition was 
given to the fact that a stoker-fired furnace with forced draft through 
the fire requires less chimney draft than does a hand-fired furnace. 

That is, in a hand-fired furnace the chimney draft must pull the air 
for combustion through the fire-bed and then must remove the excess air 
and flue gases from the combustion space in the furnace. In a stoker- 
fired furnace, however, the chimney draft needs only to remove the 
excess air and flue gases from the space above the fire bed. 

A double roof jack was fastened to the roof conveniently above 
each furnace inside the building. The inside pipe allowed the heated 
air to escape, whilst replacement air entered into the building through 
the annular space.

EQUIPMENT AND INSTALLATION 


A. Furnaces . 

Two warm air coal furnaces of the usual hand fired type were 
installed. One was a new cast iron Empire Hy-power No. 18D furnace 
and the other was a second hand Torrid Zone 210B steel furnace. To 
adapt these furnaces for stoker use the grates were removed and other 
adjustments made. Each furnace was approved as satisfactory for the 
stoker to be installed by the representative for that stoker. 

The steel furnace was set on a cement base as shown in Figure I 
(labelled Underfeed Furnace Base); the furnace is twenty-three inches in 
diameter at the grate level and thirty-seven inches from grate level to 
crown. The sectional elevation of this furnace is shown in Figure III. 

A rectangular radiator, slightly curved to fit the curvature of the back 
of the furnace, is fitted inside with a baffle plate extending the 
whole width of the radiator and almost all of its length except for about 
nine inches at the bottom. This baffle plate forces the flue gases to 
travel twice the length of the radiator when the direct flue opening 
is closed, as it is in normal operation of the furnace. The steel 
furnace has an estimated radiation surface of approximately thirty-four 
square feet, which is rated as corresponding roughly to 25,000 cubic 
feet of house space. 

The cast iron furnace was set on another cement base shown in 
Figure I (labelled Overfeed Furnace Base). Further details of this 
base are.given in Figure II. The sectional elevation of the furnace 
is shown in Figure IV. The furnace has an inside diameter of fifteen 
inches at the grate level and an inside height of thirty-two inches

grate 

from/level to crown. The radiator of heavy cast iron is a circular 
ring in plan, shaped to fit around the dome-like crown of the furnace. 

In cross section the radiator is triangular in shape. In normal 
operation, i.e., with the direct flue damper closed, the flue gases 
can pass to the chimney only by travelling through this radiator. This 
cast furnace has an estimated radiation surface of twenty-five square 
feet which corresponds roughly to a rating of 14,000 cubic feet of house 
space. 

Figure IV shows the installation of this furnace as it was first 
installed in the stoker building. Later, however, the top part of the 
furnace was turned clockwise through 120° so that an observer could 
look through the fire door and see the fire on the overfeed retort. 

Each furnace jacket, of galvanized sheet iron, has two outlets on 
its conical crown, the outlet at the crown of the casing being 
connected by a 13" pipe with the outside atmosphere through the roof 
jack and the other outlet opening into the room for use in cold weather. 
These outlets are equipped with dampers so that the temperature in the 
building can be controlled within reasonable limits. 

Each furnace casing has an opening near its base connected to a 
large fan, in order to absorb furnace heat by blowing air through the 
furnace jacket and out through the crown of the casing. In this 
equipment this forced draft replaces the usual natural circulation of 
air through the furnace jacket and into the house. These fans are 
used only when a large amount of heat is being released during the fast 
rates of operation.

These fans circulate approximately 2100 cubic feet of air a minute. 
Consequently replacement of this amount of air in the building is 
necessary. Replacement air enters the building through the annular 
space of the double roof jack. 

B. Fairbanks Morse Stoker - Underfeed . 

The underfeed stoker used in this investigation ms a Fairbanks-Morse 
Victory model andw.as rated at 25 pounds of coal an hour with a hopper 
capacity of approximately 400 pounds. A diagrammatic drawing of this 
stoker is shown in Figure III. 

Under the coal hopper is housed a quarter horse power motor, 
reducing gears, blower fan and part of the auger. The blower fan is 
connected directly to the motor shaft while the auger is connected to 
the motor shaft through reducing gears and a set of pulleys. 

The rfetort is cast iron, rectangular in shape, and has overall 
dimensions of 10 3/4” (width), 12 l/4 n (length) and 9 1/2” (height). 

In section the retort, as shown in Figure III, is constructed of 
double walls and bottom with an average air space about 1 1/2” between 
these viralls. The top of this air space is covered by replaceable cast 
iron sections in which the tuyeres, each 1 3/4" long and 3/16" wide, 
are located. There are three rows of tuyeres on the inside edge of 
the retort and one row on the outside edge. The air blast from the 
blower fan through the air duct to the retort tuyeres is controlled 
by two dampers: firstly, the air inlet damper-which regulates the 
amount of air allowed to the blower fan, and secondly, the air flow 
damper which automatically allows more or less air to reach the 
combustion bed, thus compensating for varying resistance in the fire bed.

The opening of the air inlet damper was divided into twelve equal 
divisions so that a record of the setting for this damper could be 
recorded for each run. The air flow damper is regulated by means of a 
turnbuckle. Sixteen full turns of this turnbuckle gives the maximum 
opening in the air duct; hence the air setting on this damper also could 
be recorded for each run. 

The record of these air settings gives a poor measure of the 
quantity of air supplied to the retort for any coal. However these 
records were useful whenever repeat runs were made. 

The coal is fed by the auger from the hopper to the retort through 

the auger tube. The rate of coal feed can be suited to the coal by 

varying the size of pulleys which connect the motor shaft to the 

reducing gears. The rate of coal feed in the runs made varied from 

13.6 to 28.6 lbs. per hour (continuous operation). The auger feeds by 
volume; therefore the weight per hour of any setting varies with the 
size of the coal and its density. The auger is approximately 3 l/2 n 
in diameter and fits snugly in the auger tube. This latter point 
renders close sizing of coal advisable for this stoker. 

When the coal reaches the end of the auger tube, it is pushed 
up inside the retort and is subjected to a gradual preheat before it 
reaches the combustion zone. This preheat is furthered by the air 
blast through the coal from the inside rows of tuyeres. The preheated 
coal then reaches the active combustion zone, where it burns. The 
refuse left after combustion is pushed aside by the fresh coal arriving 
in the combustion bed. This refuse, in the form of loose ash and 
clinker piles up on the hearth surrounding the retort.

As noted before the refuse is commonly removed from, an underfeed 
stoker as clinker, this being done by lifting the clinkers out through 
the fire door by means of tongs. Clinkers only are removed, the loose 
ash being- left on the hearth or raked into the fire to be included in 
clinkers formed later. 

The gradual preheat to which the fresh coal is subjected before it 
reaches the active combustion zone distills off the moisture and much of 
the volatile matter; the latter must pass through the fire bed where it 
is mixed with air supplied by the air blast and is usually almost 
completely burned. Thus the underfeed stoker is designed to burn the 
volatile part of the coal substance with greater efficiency and less 
smoke than in ordinary hand firing. This point will be dealt with in 
greater detail under the description of work done on the smoke propertie 
of Alberta coals. 

The tuyeres and air space between the walls of the retort may 
become blocked up with dust and small pieces of clinker after prolonged 
use. A clean-out tube, attached to the retort, permits this obstruction 
to be blown out to allow again the uniform distribution of air to all 
parts of the combustion bed. 

This underfeed stoker is equipped with two safety devices which 
come into use when a foreign body in the coal, such as a bolt or spike, 
jams the auger in the auger tube. A shear-pin in the reducing .gear 
system breaks, thus stopping the rotation of the auger before undue 
strain can be put on the motor. The other device is a trap at the 
junction between the hopper and the auger tube in which the foreign 
body is caught and from which the body can be removed. In the one case 


























.

when this happened during this investigation, no trouble was encountered 
in removing the bolt, renewing the shear-pin and continuing the 
operation of the stoker, although it has been reported that small spikes 
and bits of mine prop timber may work their way past the trap and lodge 
between the auger and the auger tube wall, necessitating partial 
dismantling of the stoker to remove the obstruction. 

This Victory (war-time) model was not equipped with the tightly 
fitting hopper lid previously supplied. Smoke sometimes, when the 
hopper was empty, backed up the auger tube and issued from the hopper 
causing inconvenience. In regular practice this would seldom happen. 

The underfeed retort was installed in the steel furnace and was 
packed in with sand, the latter serving as a heat insulator. As indicated 
in Figure III, rectangular holes 10 l/2” high and 12” wide were cut in 
the outer casing of the furnace and in the side of the steel furnace 
proper. Into this opening a galvanized iron box 10 l/2” high, 12” wide 
and 14” long was tightly fitted. This constituted a passage through 
which the retort and its connections could be inserted into the furnace. 

One end of this box was attached to the furnace walls and the other end, 
fitted with a tongue and grooved cover, projected about six inches out of 
the furnace casing. The retort rested on about one inch of sand on the 
furnace base; sand was packed around the retort and into the box around 
the air duct, auger tube, and clean-out tube. On top of this sand packing a 
hearth, 2” thick of fire clay and cement,was laid. This hearth at the 
periphery of the retort was at the level of the lower edge of the outside 
ring of tuyeres and sloped up from the retort to the furnace walls at 
an angle of about 15° from the horizontal.

♦ The hopper with the motor, fan, gearing, etc. was set on a cement 

base which was built to the proper height so that the whole length of the 
stoker was level. All joints in the auger tube, air duct and clean-out 
tube were sealed with furnace cement. 

The height from the tuyere ring of the retort to the lower edge 
of the opening into the flue pipe is 24 n and from the tuyere ring to 
the crown of the furnace is 39”. The effective grate area at the 
tuyeres is approximately one half of a square foot. 

C. Alberta Goal Stoker - Overfeed 

The overfeed stoker used in this investigation was an f Alberta 
Coal Stoker 1 made by Coutt T s Machinery, Edmonton. It was rated at a 
maximum of thirty pounds of lignite per hour and its hopper capacity was 
about three hundred pounds. This stoker was lent by the manufacturer 
to the Research Council for this investigation. 

Figure IV shows the essential details of this overfeed stoker. 

The coal feed and blower fan are driven by a quarter horse power motor, 
the blower fan being connected directly to the motor shaft. The auger 
is driven through reducing gears and through a belt and set of pulleys. 

The cylindrical metal coal hopper, fitted with a lid, has a cone 
bottom in the center of which there is a rectangular opening where the 
coal can fall down into the auger. The auger, larger In diameter than 
that in the underfeed stoker, fits loosely in the auger tube with about 
one half inch to spare all around. In consequence this stoker does not 
require as close a sizing of coal as the underfeed stoker requires. The 
rate of coal feed in the runs made varied from 18.2 to 27.2 pounds per 
hour (continuous operation).

The retort is a flat platform covered from one end for about half 
its length; this covered end is connected to the auger tube. The grate, 
at the other end, is comprised of forty-five steel bars with spaces 
between them, giving a grate area of approximately one half a square 
foot. There is an air chamber below the platform through which air 
from the air duct passes up through the grate. A short clean-out tube 
is also connected to this air chamber so that any refuse falling between 
the grate bars can be blown out when necessary. A bleed-off tube from 
the air duct to the auger tube between the coal hopper and the retort 
carries a small by-pass current of air along the coal auger to the 
retort and prevents a back-draft of smoke to the hopper. 

The coal fed on to the retort platform is pushed forward into the 
active combustion zone over the grate area; combustion is supposedly 
completed here and the refuse is pushed off the end of the retort into 
the ash pit. The coal is subjected to a short preheat in the covered 
part of the retort just before it reaches the grate. The coal flow is 
distributed over the full width of the grate by means of one or more 
spreader pins. This preheat will.be -discussed later in the section on 
smoke. 

The air blast of this overfeed stoker is adjusted by a damper in 
the air duct. An indicator was put on this damper so that a record 
could be kept of the air blast used for each run. The ninety degree 
movement of the damper was divided into twelve equal divisions. 

The retort was inserted through the ash door of the cast iron 
furnace as shown in Figure IV and was held in place with a collar of 
sheet steel. All openings around the steel collar were sealed with

furnace cement. The discharge end of the retort platform is ten 
inches from the opposite wall of the furnace, and is 1 directly above 
the pail in the ash pit. The grate is forty inches below the crown 
of the furnace and twenty-two inches below the bottom of the flue exit. 

This stoker is not equipped with any protective device to prevent 
overloading the motor if any foreign object should lodge between the 
auger blades and the wail of the auger tube. Such protective devices 
as have been described for the underfeed stoker apparently are not 
necessary for the overfeed. The larger auger and the half.inch space 
between the auger blades and tube may allow spikes, bolts, etc. to 
be pushed through to the retort and into the ash pit. No interruptions 
in operation of this stoker were experienced during this investigation. 

D. Testing Equipment . 

Testing equipment was provided (a) to facilitate correct adjustment 
of coal and air prior to test runs, (b) to give the desired on and off 
periods of the test run to be made, (c) to record any irregularities 
during a test run, (d) to prevent overloading of motors and overheating 
of furnaces and equipment, (e) to collect fly-ash, (f) to measure com¬ 
bustion bed temperature and (g) to record the distance that a coal 
burned back into the auger tube during the 58 ? off periods. 

(a) A Ranarex density balance COg recorder was used in the preliminary 
work on each coal to secure a suitable air setting for the selected coal 
feed. This recorder was also used in many runs, particularly in the 
underfeed stoker, as a check record on the regularity of furnace operation. 

(b) The regular means of controlling the operation of a stoker, 
i.e., by a house thermostat, "was impossible in this investigation.

A device for timing the on and off periods of the two stokers used 
in this investigation was constructed from a large clock. A drum, driven 
by the clock’s mainspring through gears, was covered with a sheet of thin 
metal over which was placed a layer of celluloid. This drum., etc. is 
shown in Figure V. The operation of each stoker is controlled by an 
electric current through a relay switch, connection being made through a 
metal finger resting on the rotating drum. Slots cut in the celluloid 
permit periodic electric contact between the finger and the drum, thus 
closing the relay switch. The drum rotated once in two hours, so it 
was easy to adapt the length of the slot to the desired time of operation. 

Seven paths were made on the arum, with slots to give two each of 
15’ on 15’ off, 10’ on 30’ off, and 2’ on 53 1 off, and one of 4’ on 
56’ off. The latter path was to be used only if a coal did not give a 
satisfactory stay-alight fire with a 2’ on 58’ off periodicity. 

The resistance in the relay circuit was high so that sparking as 
the metal finger contacted the metal on the drum was small. To further 
minimize this sparking quick makes and breaks were arranged by raising 
one end of the exposed metal above the surface of the celluloid ana by 
aepressing the other end below the celluloid level. Thus the metal 
finger dropped about a thirty-secondth of an inch as it made contact 
and again as it broke contact. 

Each stoker was equipped with a switch by which the timing device 
could be by-passed to give continuous stoker operation. This switch 
was used in the preliminary work prior to a test run being started. 

(c) Recording thermometers (°F.), were used to record both the 
flue and warm air temperatures of each furnace. It was not intended 
that these thermometers be used in calculating efficiencies, but rs.th.er

that they should act as a record of the regularity (or irregularity) of 
furnace operation. 

(d) The warm air temperature recording thermometers, having a 
comparatively low maximum temperature, were protected by means of 

1 airstats' which were set to stop the operation of the stoker before 
the range of the recording thermometers was exceeded. 

Thermal cut-off switches were included in all motor circuits to 
prevent overloading of motors. 

(e) The variable density of the fly-ash produced by coals under 
forced draft accounts for the fact that, no trap of simple design will 
retain all the fly-ash produced in the combustion bed. A fly-ash trap 
for each furnace, illustrated in Figure VI, was designed to give a 
relative measure of the tendency of coals to produce fly-ash. 

The two main features of this trap ares the baffle placed crosswise 
to the flow of flue gases and the removable bottom which permitted 
weighing the fly-ash collected. 

These fly-ash traps were not installed until after tests on the 
first eleven samples were completed. Until this time fly-ash had been 
measured by weighing the amount deposited in a small silica dish 3" in 
diameter and 1/2" deep. In the overfeed furnace this dish was placed 
inside the fire door directly under the flue gas entrance to the radiator. 
In the underfeed furnace the dish was placed in the clean-out pipe at 
the bottom of the radiator. 

(f) A chrome1-alumel thermocouple in a protective case was first 
used to measure the combustion bed temperatures. The life of a'thermo¬ 
couple was very short and hence an optical pyrometer was used in most 


tests.

(g) Numerals were painted on a white background on the auger tubes 
of both stokers at two inch intervals; a temperature sensitive paint 
was used which changed colour at approximately 160°F. These numerals 
served as a check on how far back into the auger tube a coal burned during 
the 58 1 off periods. This paint was made by mixing an oil paste of two 
parts of mercuric iodide (Hglg) with one part of cuprous iodide (Cu^Ig)*

DESIRABLE A HD UNDESIRABLE PROPERTIES OF STOKER GOALS 

Desirable properties in a coal for either an overfeed or underfeed 
stoker are: freedom from dust and fly-ash, proper coal sizing and the 
ability to stay alight in mild weather. 

Dust created in shovelling coal into the stoker hopper is very 
obnoxious to the householder. This dust, worse from some coals than 
from others, can be reduced by screening and oiling. Oiling a coal, 
besides diminishing the dust, increases the calorific value by 70-100 
B.t.u. per pound. 

Fly-ash . Burning a coal under forced draft necessarily produces more 
fly-ash than does ordinary hand firing. This fly-ash, composed of ash 
and carbon, sraries greatly in particle size and density and hence settles 
out progressively in the furnace, flue, chimney, and outside the building. 
Fly-ash, besides representing the loss of a small amount of combustible 
material, insulates radiation space occasioning loss in efficiency of 
heat transfer. While all coals produce fly-ash, a coal to be well 
suited to stoker use, should not produce an excessive amount since, even 
with a normal amount of fly-ash, this must be removed from the furnace 
and flues at the end of each heating season. Ordinarily a high ash coal 
produces more fly-ash than does a low ash coal. 

Sizing . Correct sizing of coal is very important in keepihg fly-ash 
to a minimum. -The larger pieces of coal should go - through the auger 
without excessive fracturing. However, excessive fines, whether originally 
in the coal or produced by fracture in the auger, will cause fly-ash 
trouble. The size of coal suited to stoker use depends on the dimensions

27 


of the auger and. auger tube of the individual stoker, but sizing between 
l/4” and 1 3/4 M limits is usually satisfactory, although closer screening, 
e.g., between 3/4” and 1 l/4 M , produces less fly-ash. 

Another difficulty sometimes encountered with a poorly sized coal is 
the bridging of coal in the hopper, which prevents the coal going 
through the auger tube to the retort, and usually results in the fire 
.going out. The danger of bridging is much increased when the coal is 
wet. This bridging happened once during this investigation. In this 
case the coal was poorly sized - from 0 to about 3 l/2 n - and was very 
wet when received. 

Stay-alight . The ability of a coal to stay alight in mild weather 
when the stoker operates only on the automatic timer is a very important 
characteristic. This property is related to'the ignitability of the coal 
and depends on its rank. However, considerable leeway is provided by 
most of the automatic timers superimposed on the thermostat since they 
are adjustable and can usually be set to give a satisfactory stay-alight 
fire for any coal. 

Other desirable properties which vary notably with the type of stoker 
are; smoke, combustion characteristics, and ash and clinker formation. 

Smoke issuing from a chimney is lost heat value in addition to being 
a nuisance to the neighbourhood. Smoky fuels also cause the radiation 
surfaces of the furnace and flue pipes to be covered with an insulating* 
layer of soot, thus occasioning a further and more serious loss of heat. 

In the underfeed stoker the volatile matter driven off during the 
preheat is largely burned during its passage up through the active 
combustion zone, and consequently the underfeed stoker is adapted to burn

the smoky coals. In the overfeed stoker there is no such provision, 
but this stoker is only intended to burn free-burning lower rank coals 
that are smokeless or only slightly smoky. 

Combustion Characteristics . The difference in the combustion bed 
thickness and heat holding ability between the underfeed and overfeed 
retorts accounts for the fact that (non-coking) high rank coals are 
suited to the former but not to the latter. High rank coals, which are 
more difficult to ignite and take longer to burn than low rank coals, 
would drop from the overfeed retort into the ash pit with a prohibitive 
loss of combustible material, since the coal is in the active 
combustion zone for not more than one hour at -a periodicity of 15’ on 
15 T off. High rank (non-coking) coals can be burned efficiently in the 
underfeed stoker, since here the fire bed is much thicker and holds its 
heat better. In the underfeed nothing is supposedly removed except 
clinker. There is usually every chance that a piece of coal, which may 
escape burning for a time, must eventually burn! the loss of combustible 
in ‘the clinker is ordinarily very small. 

Strongly coking coals cannot be efficiently burned in the ordinary 
underfeed stoker. The coke formed in the lower zone of the fire is far 
more difficult to burn than the coal and therefore passes up through 
the combustion zone only partially burned. This coke may build up as. 
much as two and. a half feet above the fire. Such a formation is known 
as a ’coke-tree’. When it collapses much of the unburned coke, falls 
outside of the hot fire zone and does not burn. 

Ash and Clinker Formation . For the underfeed stoker a coal with a 
low percentage of ash ? with satisfactory clinkering properties ? is required. 
A high ash coal results in the rapid accumulation of clinker and ash in

the furnace. This disturbs the smooth and efficient operation of the 
stoker regardless of whether it is allowed to accumulate until the 
normal cleaning period or is removed at more frequent intervals. A 
coal with more than one pound of ash per therm (100,000 B.t.u.), i.e., 

10f 0 on a 10,000 B.t.u. coal, is.inadvisable. This method of rating the 
ash relative to the calorific value of the coal seems a much fairer 
criterion than as a straight per cent of ash. For this reason Table V 
lists^the pounds of ash per therm for each coal. 

A satisfactory clinker is one which is strong enough to allow 
removal Yfith tongs, but porous enough to permit the passage of air for 
combustion to the unburned coal above the cLinker ring. The word 
porous is ambiguous? clinkers in which there are passages through which 
a fluid can pass easily, and clinkers with enclosed air spaces might both 
be described as porous, but only the former would permit the free 
passage of air to the fire-bed. In this report a clinker with visible 
air passages is defined as porous, while a clinker with.enclosed air 
spaces is defined as cellular. No method was found for determining the 
porosity-of a clinker other than by visual observation. The percentage 
air space of the clinkers in Table IX are calculated from their 
determined true and apparent specific gravities. 

Ash and clinker specifications for the overfeed stoker are notably 
less stringent. A low ash coal is desirable but not required. The 
coal ash, however, must not be too fusible or trouble in the form of 
a * clinker-bridge T may result. This is an agglomeration of fused and 
unfused refuse whichbridges across the fire pot and lodges against the 
opposite wall instead of dropping into the ash pit. This ’clinker-bridge’ 
blocks off the air supply causing most of the fresh coal to drop into

the ash pit before being more than partially burned. Small clinkers are 
not detrimental to the smooth operation of the overfeed stoker. 

In conclusion, coal for: 

n underfeed stoker should be closely sized, free from dust, preferably 
oiled, non-coking, of low ash content with ash forming a coherent and porous 
clinker. 

An overfeed stoker should be closely sized, free from dust, preferably 
oiled, free burning, smokeless, and the ash should not form a strong. 


hard clinker.

OBJECTS OF TESTS 

The Research Council of Alberta has received enquiries from time 
to time from stoker owners as to good Alberta coals to purchase for 
stoker use. It is evident from the foregoing discussion of the desirable 
properties for a stoker coal that it is difficult to predict from its 
analysis whether or not a particular coal would burn satisfactorily in 
either type of stoker. This is especially difficult for the underfeed 
stoker. A more reliable prediction can only be given after a stoker test 
has been made on the coal. 

Accordingly, the objects of the tests can be stated thus: to find 
the Alberta coals suited to the overfeed stokers in common use in 
western Canada, and to find Alberta coals suited to underfeed stokers 
in common use in both western and eastern Canada. For the latter, two 
types of coal were considered: lower rank coals for domestic markets 
and high rank coals for either domestic or distant markets.

SELECTION OF TEST PERIODICITY 

As noted in the introduction it was desired to test each coal under 
three different conditions and three different stoker periodicities were 
chosen. These rates were: 15* on 15 T off, 10* on 30* off and 2’ on 53* 
off. No precedent could be found as to what periodicities should be used 
and for this reason a recording device was placed on two residential 
stokers, on an overfeed stoker in the home of Dr. R.F. Shaner during the 
winter of 1943-44 and on an underfeed’stoker in the-home of Mr. Colin 
Campbell in 1944-45. Figure VII is a pictorial representation of the 
operation of Mr. Campbell’s stoker on three typical days. 

The results obtained for this stoker periodicity recorder are 
summarized in Tables I and II. The owner of each stoker made a practice 
of reducing the temperature setting on his thermostat at night, usually 
before midnight, and of raising the setting again in the morning, usually 
after six o’clock but before nine o’clock. Therefore from each twenty-four 
hour record of stoker periodicity, two periods of six hours each were 
chosen, one period from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M. and the other from midnight to 
6 A.M. The latter period gives a better picture of typical stoker 
operation than does the 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. period because the heat needs of 
a house are usually more regular during the night than during the day. 

The winter of 1945-44 was mild and for this reason there are fewer 
results in Table I than in Table II; neither table includes periodicities 
during mild weather when the automatic hold-fire control largely controls 
the operation of the stoker. 

These tables show that 15’ on 15’ off and 10’ on 30’ off periodicities 
selected for this investigation are reasonable to typify extra cold and 
cold winter weather. The third periodicity, 2’ on 58’ off, represented 
stay-alight conditions.

TEST PROCEDURE 

Samples of coal for stoker tests ranged in amount from half a ton 
to a ton and a half and were nearly ail received in sacks. Upon arrival 
this coal was sampled as the coal was emptied into a bin; this sample 
for analysis, of approximately sixty pounds per ton of coal, was taken 
by removing about a half a pound of coal with a shovel from each of 
at least three places in each sack. Proximate, ultimate, calorific, and 
ash analyses, as well as fusion tests, were made for each coal. 

Both stokers and both furnaces were thoroughly cleaned of ail coal 
and refuse from previous tests. The tuyeres on the underfeed and the 
grate area on the overfeed were inspected, and cleaned if choked up with 
refuse. The coal feed was adjusted to suit the calorific value of the 
coal by using the proper pulleys. Coal was then put into each hopper 
and the stoker turned on to feed the coal through to the retort; the 
stoker was then turned off and a fire kindled on top of the coal. When 
the coal was well alight the stoker was again switched on and left 
operating, using the by-pass switch, until a hot fire had built up in 
the retort area. In the underfeed the air supply was cut to a minimum 
so that a normal fuel bed approximately eight inches deep built up 
quickly. Once a good fire had been attained the stoker was then put on 
the 15* on 15 f off periodicity and. left running at this rate for several 
hours for conditions in the furnace to reach equilibrium. 

Adjustments were then made on the air blast dampers to suit the 
amount of coal being fed into the retort. In the underfeed stoker the 
proper air setting is that which supplies the minimum air necessary to 
burn the coal efficiently without allowing unburned coal to build up In the

retort area. In general higher rank coals, e.g., semi-anthracite, 
require more air per minute than do the free burning lower rank coals 
even though both are fed into the retort at rates to give approximately 
the same rate of heat release. The C02 recorder was used at this time 
to check on the flue gas content. In general slightly more air than 
that required to give the maximum percentage of CO 2 in the flue gas was 
needed to prevent unburned coal building up in the underfeed retort. 

In the overfeed stoker a proper air setting will give an optimum 
balance among three conflicting criteria: minimum, combustible material 
in the refuse, maximum per cent of CO 2 in the flue gas, and minimum of 
sparking from the fuel bed. In the preliminary work on the overfeed 
stoker several air settings were tried for short runs of from one to 
two hours. Visual observation of the fire, the CO 2 record, and the 
combustible material in the refuse were duly considered in order to 
select the best air setting. 

Having decided on suitable air settings the stokers were then made 
ready for the test runs. Refuse from the stokers and fly-ash from the 
flue receptacle were removed. Usually the 15* on 15* off run in the 
underfeed and the 2’ on 58’ off run in the overfeed were begun at the 
same time. Then the 10* on 30 f off runs were made in each stoker, and 
finally the 2’ on 58' off and 15’ on 15 ? off runs were made in the 
underfeed and overfeed respectively. The above schedule applied when 
a coal was tested in both stokers and it gave a reasonably uniform heat 
outflow in the stoker building. These runs were of variable length 
but commonly lasted from twenty-four to forty-eight hours each.

The approximate rate of feed for each stoker being known from the 
preliminary work, sufficient coal for at least twenty-four hours, and 
for the whole length of the run, if possible, was weighed into each 
hopper. 

The starting and finishing times for each run were recorded; the 
times at which clinkers were removed from the underfeed were also recorded. 
In general it was attempted to make these clinker removals during the two 
fast rates of operation at such intervals of time as to simulate clinker 
removals in a household installation, that is, clinkers were removed 
twice a day for the 15’ on 15’ off rate and once a day for the 10’ on 30* 
off rate. However, in the case of a high ash coal in the 15’ on 15’ off 
rate, clinkers were removed when necessary. In the 2’ on 58’ off rate 
clinkers were not removed until the end of the run. Flue temperature 
and warm air temperature records were kept for all'runs, and visual 
observation of the fire in each furnace was recorded for all runs. A 
CO 2 record for the 15 f on 15’ off runs was kept and for these runs the 
fire bed temperature as determined by the optical pyrometer or thermo¬ 
couple was also recorded. In the 2’ on 58’ off runs a check was kept on 
the temperature sensitive paint numerals. 

At the end of the run the coal remaining in the hopper was weighed 
out. The fly-ash caught in the flue receptacle was weighed and kept for 
analysis. Refuse in the overfeed ash receptacle was weighed and saved 
for combustible matter analysis. Clinkers from the underfeed were not 
weighed, but were analyzed for combustible matter. Clinkers from the 
underfeed and ’clinker-bridges’ from the overfeed were also tested for 
true and apparent specific gravities.

brittle but showed no tendency to clog the tuyere area of the retort. 

This coal appeared to burn farther down into the retort than did other 
coals tested. In this 48 hour run, however, the tuyeres exhibited no 
evidence of being burned, although this factor undoubtedly might become

serious if this coal were used over longer periods of time. The clinkers 
apparently were easily pushed out of the fire on to the hearth area, and 
caused no trouble from unburned coal piling up on top of the clinker 
ring. The clinkers formed were dense and had an apparent specific 
gravity of 1.87 and a cell space of 34 %* The hard chunks of clinker 
that formed caused the formation of blow holes in the fire-bed, hence 
the COg in the flue gas was lower than usual. Irregularities in operation 
due to these hard chunks of clinker were also responsible for exposure 
of the tuyeres to the fire, and were the result of an ash which was too 
easily fusible. 

Notes re fly-ash - Although the sizing of this coal was satisfactory for 
the underfeed, yet the fly-ash was excessive. It was noted that small 
particles popped off the larger lumps of coal in the combustion bed, ana 
that these small particles were carried out of the combustion bed by the 
combustion gases. The shattering of the coal surface may be caused by 
the rapid escape of the high volatile matter content of this coal. As a 
result of the coal burning down inside the retort, instead of on top of 
the retort, this coal does not get as long a preheat as other coals do 
in the underfeed stoker. As a consequence there is a large amount of 
volatile matter still in the coal when it reaches the intensely hot 
fire-bed. This is driven off very rapidly and shatters the structure 
of the coal lump. This shattering, especially on the surface, causes 
excessive fly-ash. 

An interesting feature in the combustion of this particular coal is 
the formation of ’cauliflower cokes’ when the coal is heated quickly, 
even though this coal is classed as non-coking. The explosive escape 
of the high volatile matter content, causes the lump of coal to pop open, 
forming a coke particle which resembles a piece of cauliflower.

General notes re performace of this coal at 2' on 58’ off periodicity - 
this coal gave a satisfactory stay-alight fire. The flue temperature 
record shows quick response by the fire-bed. to stoker operation. h T o 
clinkers were noted in the refuse. There was very little tendency to 
burn back into the auger tube. Both fly-ash and combustible matter in 
the refuse were higher than usual. 

B. Summary Report of All Tests in the Underfeed Stoker .- 

In the following summary report of tests the main criteria used in 
judging the performance of a coal in the underfeed stoker must necessarily 
be the clinkering characteristics of the ash, the ash content of the coal 
and the tendency toward ’coke-tree* formation. Dustiness and excessive 
fly-ash in these tests should not be allowed to condemn a coal because 
dustiness can be eliminated by screening and oiling, while fly-ash usually 
can be kept within reasonable limits by proper coal sizing. Even if a 
properly sized coal does produce a larger than normal amount of fly-ash, 
the coal cannot be censured too much if it has a moderately low ash and 
the required clinkering properties. Also the inability of a coal to 
stay alight at any particular hold-fire periodicity, e.g., 2* on 58* off 
rate, need not condemn a coal because, by a simple adjustment on the 
hold-fire control of a household stoker, a periodicity can be chosen which 
will give a satisfactory stay-alight fire. A high-rank coal will require 
a longer on period than a lower rank coal. The response to stoker 
operation by a coal will also be dependent upon the rank of the coal, the 
higher rank coals being slow to respond and the lower rank, i.e., free-burning 
coals, being quick to respond. But all this can be provided for in the 
adjustment of the stoker for any particular coal.

A coal which produces excessive smoke in the underfeed stoker cannot 
be regarded as a suitable coal, but slight smokiness, particularly just 
at the beginning of an off period, cannot be given much weight in the 
adverse criticism of the coal. Three smoky coals were tested and in each 
case the coal was adversely criticized for its excessive smokiness, but in 
these cases the excessive smoke was accompanied by other more important 
disqualifying factors, thus, the ash was infusible, and strong ’coke-trees’ 
were produced. 

It should be noted that, even though a coal sample showed satisfactory 
clinkering properties, it does not follow that another consignment from 
the same mine but with notably higher or lower ash content would also • 
show satisfactory clinkering properties. The reverse situation also 
applies. 

In summary, a coal is judged unsatisfactory if the refuse does not 
clinker suitably, if the ash content is considerably in excess of one 
pound of ash per therm, and if strong ’coke-trees ’ are formed. Excessive 
smoke is liable to accompany the formation of strong ’coke-trees* and 
will thus add adverse criticism to a coal already judged unsatisfactory. 
601/44 

Insufficient coal .was received for a complete test. Indication 
from the runs made showed this coal unsatisfactory in that clinkers 
were very bulky and caused a dirty fire. 

6 02/44 

This coal did not clinker freely enough and the percentage of ash 
was too high. Its performance was unsatisfactory.

603/44 

Clinkering was good but the coal had too large a percentage of ash 
to permit this coal being rated as satisfactory. 

604/44 

Clinkering was insufficient to maintain a satisfactory combustion 
bed; and the ash percentage was too high. This coal was unsatisfactory. 
605/44 

This coal was dusty in handling; a run was made on an oiled portion 
and trouble from dust was then found to be negligible. Fly-ashwas 
excessive in both cases. Clinkering was not entirely satisfactory in 
that the clinkers were too dense and formed in hard chunks; this allowed 
the tuyeres of the retort to be exposed to the combustion bed. The 
performance of this coal was not satisfactory. 

606/44 

This coal, a coking Kentucky Slkhorn coal supposedly widely sold 
in Winnipeg as an underfeed stoker fuel, proved poorly adapted for use 
in this underfeed stoker.for three reasons: the ash was infusible; the 
’coke-tree’ formation was too strong to be broken up by the movement of 
coal through the combustion bed; and this coal was excessively smoky, 
since dense black smoke issued from the chimney in both on and off 
periods. This coal was definitely unsatisfactory. 

607/44 

This coal clinkered satisfactorily but the percentage of ash was 
too high. Blow holes developed in the fire-bed soon after clinker removal 
and the COg recorder then showed a drop from 10/£ to 4/ of C02 in the 
flue gas. The fly-ash deposit vras larger than usual. The performance^of 
this coal was unsatisfactory.

608/44 

This coal was too freely clinkering to be satisfactory. A flat 
doughnut-shaped plate of dense, non-porous clinker formed in the hot 
fire following clinker removal; this clinker covered the entire tuyere 
area, and blocked off the air supply to the fresh coal above the clinker 
ring. 

609/44 

This coal was also too freely clinkering to give a satisfactory 
performance. The same remarks as for 608/44 apply here. 

610/44 

The ash of this coal was infusible and produced only a few small 
clinkers; this coal was therefore unsatisfactory. Chemical treatment 
with technical FeS 04 . 7 H 20 gave a good clinker and the coal was then 
satisfactory. Experiments on this chemical treatment are described in 
a later section. 

611/44 

This coal was too freely clinkering and gave the same clinker troubl 
as described for 608/44. Performance was unsatisfactory. 

612/44 

Clinkers produced were porous and bulky; clinkering was sufficient 
to keep the fire-level down to a reasonable depth if clinkers were 
removed often enough. However the ash content of this coal was too high 
and for this reason clinker removal was required too often. This coal 
was unsatisfactory. 

614/44 

Clinkering and ash percentage were satisfactory, but clinkers and 
fly-ash were bulky. The over-all performance of this coal was not 
entirely satisfactory.

616/44 

The ash of this coal was infusible and no clinkers were formed, 
and thus the coal was unsatisfactory. Chemical treatment with technical 
FeSC>4.7H20 and Ferrite Yellow gave satisfactory c linkering. Blending 
with a low rank coal also gave good clinkering and satisfactory 
operation. This work on blending and chemical treatment is discussed in 
detail in later chapters. 

617/44 

This coal produced very strong ’coke-trees 1 which were too strong to 
be broken by movement of the combustion bed. The percentage of ash was 
moderate but the ash. was infusible. A dense, black smoke issued from 
the chimney during the first part of an off period, but smokiness was 
not as bad during the on periods. This coal was unsatisfactory. Several 
attempts were made to reduce the coking tendency and to improve clinkering 
by blending. This work will be described in a later chapter. 

621/44 

The ash content of 621/44 was very high. The- coal produced ’coke- 
trees’ and gave no clinker. The performance of this coal was unsatisfactory. 
It was smoky but not as much so as 617/44. Blending experiments in an 
attempt to reduce coking and. improve clinkering for this coal are 
discussed later. 

G. Summary Report of Tests in the Overfeed Stoker . 

For the overfeed stoker the main criterion used in judging the 
performance of a coal must necessarily be the clinkering nature of the ash 
since no coals were tested that were not free-burning. Dustiness and 
excessive fly-ash should not condemn a coal for the overfeed stoker if

- 51 


this coal shows no tendency toward clinker trouble. Smoke will not be 
excessive in the overfeed stoker if only free-burning coals are used 
although those free-burning coals, close to the higher rank coals, may 
produce slight smoke in the- overfeed especially at the beginnings of 
off periods; this slight smoke is considered relatively unimportant 
in judging the performance of a coal. 

Accordingly, in the following summary report of coals tested in the 
overfeed stoker, a coal will only be judged unsatisfactory if it gives 
clinker trouble. 'Wherever fly-ash and/or dust are excessive, appropriate 
notes are given and the probable reasons are noted. 

Figures VIII, IX* X and XI contrast the flue and warm air temperature 
records for satisfactory and unsatisfactory operation In the nafer feed 
stoker at the 15’ *on 15’ off periodicity. Coal 615/44 gave no clinker 
trouble; the temperature records show an even and regular rise and fall 
throughout the twelve hour period illustrated. Coal 613/44 was 
unsatisfactory in that a 1 clinker-bridge 1 was produced with a resultant 
large drop in flue temperature and in warm air temperature. When the 
’clinker-bridge 1 formed the coal fed on to the retort passed over and 
around the clinker and dropped into the ash-pit almost completely 
unburned. 9 . 1 % of the coal fed on to the retort gave no heat release 
in the furnace. This percentage would have been much higher if it were 
not for the fact that the ’clinker-bridge 1 did not form until 
approximately eighteen hours of the full twenty-four hours of the run 
had elapsed.

This coal, taken from the University power house, produced excessive 
fly-ash probably because of its high ash content and the large amount of 
slack in the coal. The first test runs showed too high a loss in 
combustible in the refuse. Improved settings of air and coal feed on a 
fresh sample gave lower losses. The general performance of the coal was 
satisfactory. 

603/44 

This coal was satisfactory. 

604/44 

This coal was satisfactory. 

605/44 

Although the performance of this coal was satisfactory, it was noted 
that the combustible matter in the refuse increased as the rate of stoker 
operation decreased. The explanation - the poor combustion at the slow 
rate of combustion - has already been discussed. This coal was dusty and 
produced a large amount of fly-ash in spite of its low ash content and good 
sizing. Slight smoke was noted at the beginning of each off period. 

607/44 

This coal gave a satisfactory performance; however, its ash content 
was high and this probably accounted for the greater than normal amount 
of fly-ash. Slight smoke‘was noted at the beginning of each off period.

608/44- 

A blinker-bridge 1 formed during the 15’ on 15’ off rate of 
operation. Fly-ash was excessive, probably because of the large amount 
of slack in the coal. This coal was unsatisfactory. 

609/44 

A ’clinker-bridge 1 formed during both the 15 1 on 15 1 off and 10 1 on 
30 1 off runs. This coal was a power house sample and contained 
considerable slack. For this reason sparking and fly-ash were excessive. 
Performance of this coal was unsatisfactory. 

611/44 

A ’clinker-bridge 1 formed during the 15 1 on 15’ off run. Fly-ash 
was exceptionally low probably due to close sizing of the coal sample.' 
Performance of this coal was unsatisfactory. 

612/44 

Some clinkering trouble was noted in the 15’ on 15 1 off and 10’ on 
30 1 off runs. An actual ’clinker-bridge 1 was not observed but large 
pieces of porous clinker and considerable unburned material were noted 
in the refuse, and the flue and warm air temperatures were irregular. 

The performance of this coal therefore cannot be regarded as satisfactory 
613/44 

A ’clinker-bridge 1 formed in the 15 1 on 15 1 off and 10 1 on 3Q 1 off 
runs. This coal was poorly sized and contained considerable slack] the 
fly-ash deposit in the flue-receptacle was excessive. This coal was 
unsatisfactory. 

614/44 


This coal was satisfactory.

This coal was satisfactory. 

620/44 

This coal was satisfactory. 

622/44 

This coal was extremely wet when received at the laboratory. In 
the first test run, the coal, a power plant sample, formed a bridge in 
the hopper that interrupted the feeding of coal to the retort. A portion 
of this sample was dried and another run was made. The dried coal did 
not bridge in the hopper but clinker trouble was encountered during the 
15 T on 15’ off run - a ' clinker-bridge’ formed. This coal was 
unsatisfactory.

Fly-ash 

The stoker tests of twenty-two coals ranging in rank from semi¬ 
anthracite to subbituminous C showed that: 

(a) All coals produce fly-ash and the main trouble experienced is 
the blocking of flues and the insulation of heat transfer surfaces. The 
amount of fly-ash that must be expected under the best conditions is 
large enough to require that a furnace and its flue pipes be cleaned at 
least once a year (usually at the end of the heating season). 

(b) The normal amount of fly-ash to be expected from a high ash 
coal is larger than that for a low ash coal. Clinkering of the ash may 
reduce the amount of fly-ash produced, 

(c) Excessive fly-ash is likely to be produced if the coal is 
improperly sized. Slack sizes and the fracturing of oversize lumps in 
the auger tube are responsible for fly-ash in excess of the normal 

am ount ♦ 

(d) Some coals, e.g., 605/44, produce excessive fly-ash regardless 
of their sizing. No method has been evolved for decreasing this inherent 
tendency of such coals to produce fly-ash. 

(e) Oiling a coal to reduce dust does not reduce fly-ash.

(f) The loss in heat value in-fly-ash is small for any coal but for 
lower rank coals it is smaller than for higher rank coals; burning 
particles of the former rank of coal blown out of the combustion bed 
are more likely to be completely burned than are particles of higher rank 
coals which have a higher ignition temperature and which are likely to go 
out as soon as they leave the combustion zone. The heat value of the 
fly-ash from lower rank coals is approximately half of that for higher 
rank coals; values were recorded ranging from 5000 to 10,000 B.t.u./lb. 
but the actual values varied not only with the rank of the coal but also 
with the place and manner of collecting the sample. 
lombustion-bed Temperatures . 

These temperatures were taken first with a thermocouple and second 
with an optical pyrometer. The results were not comparable since the 
former measured the temperature in the fire-bed and the latter on the 
surface of the fire-bed; neither method was satisfactory. Values were 
recorded with the thermocouple ranging from 1755 to 2310° F. and with the 
optical pyrometer from 1840 to 2600° F. 

Photographs . 

Sixteen photographs were taken through the door of the underfeed 
stoker in an endeavour to obtain a positive record of fire-bed conditions. 
These were amateur photographs taken without any special equipment, and 
the small amount of room between the furnace opening and the wall of the 
building would have made any more elaborate photography extremely difficult. 
The results obtained were not sufficiently informative to warrant 
inclusion in this report. 

Photographs were also taken of a number of samples of clinkers but 
it was not found possible to distinguish photographically between different 
degress of porosity.

STUDIES OF CLINKER FORMATION 


Introduction . 

As a result of this investigation moderately low ash content (below 
one pound of ash per therm.) and suitable clinkering have been specified 
as essential to the satisfactory operation of an underfeed stoker. 

Special studies were made in trying to improve the performance of some of 
the coals judged unsatisfactory. These studies included modification of 
the clinkering properties by chemical treatment and blending, and the 
effect of coal washing on the clinkering properties of the ash. 

At this point a brief historical review is given of the published 
work on the fusibility and chemical composition of ash in relation to 
its clinkering properties. 

The fusibility of an ash is usually determined in America by the 
standard A.S.T.M. method(7) in a Melter’s furnace on a small cone of ash 
mounted on a refractory base. In this method three temperatures are 
measured at which the ash cone shows different stages of deformation. 

These stages are: initial deformation, i.e., whfen the tip of the cone 
becomes slightly rounded; softening temperature, i.e., when the cone 
bends so that the tip touches the base or when the cone melts and 
beccm.es spherical in shape; fluid temperature, i.e., when the ash flows 
over the base. A variation often used in the Research Council laboratories 
is the cone series method. Instead of measuring the initial deformation, 
softening, and fluid temperatures for each ash in one run, a number of 
cones of different ashes are placed, in the furnace and the furnace is 
heated to a definite temperature. Additional runs are then made at 45° F. 
temperature intervals above and below the first temperature. In this

way a cone series for each ash is obtained and the three deformation 
temperatures can be selected. This R.C.A. method eliminates the difficulty 
in the standard method of seeing the changes in the shape of the cone at 
high temperatures. 

Cone series for four unsatisfactory coals and five satisfactory 
coals for the overfeed stoker are shown in Figure XII. The ash of the 
first four coals produced ’clinker-bridges’. No clinker troubles were 
experienced in the test runs with the last five coals. 

The first five cone series in Figure XIII are of coals unsatisfactory 
for the underfeed stoker. The first two formed clinkers that were too 
dense, the third was not freely enough clinkering, the fourth produced 
no clinkers at all, while the fifth gave a very bulky clinker. The last 
four cone series in‘Figure XIII illustrate experiments described later on 
chemical treatment and blending of coals to modify clinkering properties. 

Fieldner and Selvig(^) divide coals into three classes of fusibility; 

Class 1 - refractory ash, softening above 2600°F. 

Class 2 - ash of medium fusibility, softening between 2200 and 

2600°F. 

Class 3 - easily fusible ash, softening below 2200°F. 

Class 1 ashes are generally non-clinkering in furnaces while Class 3 
ashes will usually form hard, glassy, non-porous clinkers. E. Schwartzman(24) 
says that ashes in Class 2 will clinker, but the amount of clinker will 
depend upon the distribution of mineral matter in the coal, the atmos¬ 
phere to which the ash is exposed, the coal sizing, the rate of combustion, 
the extent to which the mineral matter in the coal becomes mixed with the 
fuel in the hottest region of the fuel bed, the coking characteristics 
of the coal, and other general conditions arising from the design of the 


furnace.

There is in fact only a rough proportionality between the clinkering 
of an ash in a fuel bed and the softening temperature of the ash as 
determined in the A.S.T.M. method. The softening temperature is determined 
in a mildly reducing atmosphere on an intimately mixed small quantity of 
finely ground pre-oxidized material, while in a furnace the mineral 
constituents of the ash are unevenly distributed and are exposed to 
other variable conditions of temperature, atmosphere and time. Under 
such conditions clinkering probably will take place in the form of an 
agglomeration of unfused particles cemented together by more fusible 
material, although clinkers sometimes may be formed through complete 
fusion of the ash in one locality of the furnace. The amount of clinkering 
will be dependent on the amount and viscosity of the low fusing material, 
and also upon the effect on the molten material of the incorporation 
therein of refractory matter. 

It is apparent that unpredictable variable factors may cause a coal, 
placed in one of Fieldner and Selvig T s classes, to exhibit clinkering 
properties dissimilar to its classification. In general, however, this 
classification can be used as a good working rule. 

A beginning has been made by other workers in establishing relation¬ 
ships of the chemical analysis and fusibility of ash with clinker formation. 
As yet not enough work has been done on this problem to permit the 
prediction of the clinkering tendency of an ash from its ash analysis 
with a■fair degree of certainty. This whole question is almost infinitely 
complex and is dependent upon the compilation of ash analyses which are 
tedious and costly. The chemical analyses of twenty-four ashes have been 
made for record although only a few were needed for the stoker investigation

B• Effect of Chemical Treatment * 

E. Schwartzman( 2 ^) in studying the suitability of coals for blowers 

found that where the CaO content was below 6/, if the ratio SiC? + AloO* 

FegOg 

is adjusted to between 4 and 6 by the addition of iron oxide or otherwise 

the ash will clinker satisfactorily. This principle was used in attempting 

to adjust the clinkering nature of three coals to suit the needs of the 

underfeed stoker. A summary of the work done follows. 

The first coal used was a semi-anthracite coal from Cascade area, 

sample 610/44. Its ash softening temperature was +2685°F. and it produced 

only a few clinkers. The / ash was 7.6 and the ratio SiOg + AI 2 O 3 was 

Fe"20'3 

10.6 with CaO content of 1.-3/. Following Schwartzman 1 s patent an iron 
compound was added to this coal to reduce the ratio. 

Several trial runs were made using different ratios. In all runs 
powdered technical FeS 04 * 7 H 20 was added to oiled coal and the mixture worked 
* over for uniform distribution. 

The oil in these runs was intended mainly to serve as an adhesive to 
hold the iron compound on the surface of the coal and to permit its 
uniform distribution, although oiling would be advisable in any case to 
provide a clean fuel for household stokers. 

In the first trial run, with the coal treated to give a ratio of 5.0, 
the clinkers produced were satisfactory, being tough enough to allow for 
removal but porous enough to allow passage of air to the unburned coal 
above the clinker ring. To obtain this ratio of 5.0, 2.48 pounds of 
FeS 04 . 7 H 20 per 100 pounds of coal were required. The addition of 2.48 pounds 
of this iron compound increased the ash from 7.6/ to 8.4/ and decreased 
the calorific value from 14,180 B.t.u./lb. to 14,060 B.t.u./lb. In view

of the fact that a satisfactorily clinkered ash has a high density, the 
volume of ash removed from the furnace was less than would have been the 
case for an unfused or weakly fused ash* 

It was desirable to use the least amount of iron possible in this 
chemical treatment; thus ratios of 6*1 and 7.7 were tried but clinkering 
was unsatisfactory. 

The results of these runs are summarized In Table X.

Chemical treatment by adjustment of the ratio SiO? + AlpO? was also 

Pe 2 03 

used on another sample of Cascade area coal from the same mine as 610/44. 

This second sample - 616/44 - also had an infusible ash. Its afe.h 

content was higher (10.5% compared to 7.6%). than that of the first 

sample and its ash analysis was very different. The ratio Si0 2 ^ AlpO^ 

Fe 2°3 

for 616/44 was 34.8 and % CaO was 2.0. The wide difference between 
these two samples of coal from the same mine illustrates a probable 
difficulty in the chemical treatment of stoker coals.

1.96 pounds of Ferrite Yellow were required per 100 pounds of 
616/44. This increased the ash from. 10.5 to 12.4, lowered the calorific 
value from 13,790 B.t.u./lb. to 13,500, and decreased the softening 
temperature from +2685° F. to 2370° F. Figure XIII shows the cone series 
of the original coal (seventh cone series) and the chemically treated 
coal (sixth cone series). 

A forty-eight hour run using the 15’ on 15’ off periodicity was made 
and clinkers were removed every twelve hours, Clinkering was very 
satisfactory and the combustion bed showed no signs of building up. As 
noted before the increase in ash has little or no effect in interfering 
with the normal operation of the stoker because a larger weight of 
clinkered ash occupies- a smaller volume than a lesser weight of unfused 
ash. Table XI is a partial summary of the work on chemical treatment of 
616/44.

The feasibility of adding chemicals directly to the coal in the 

fire-bed was suggested in view of its greater economic possibilities. 

If this type of chemical treatment were possible* the cost of adding 

chemicals in the preparation of the coal could be avoided. The iron 

compound could be supplied to the consumer who would be instructed to add 

it according to the needs of the combustion ; bed. Naturally the proper 

ratio of Si 02 + AI 2 O 3 would very seldom be attained, but likely the 
Fe203 

consumer, after.some practice, would develop his own scheme for adding the 

iron compound to obtain satisfactory clinhering. 

A forty-eight hour run was made in the underfeed stoker. Ferrite

Yellow being added directly to/the firebed. During the run coal and 
unfused ash were deliberately allowed to pile up in the retort area to 
simulate what would likely happen in a household stoker. Then a weighed 
quantity of Ferrite Yellow, calculated for the amount of coal that had been 
burned, was sprinkled over the firebed and mixed into the refuse. No satisfacto

clinkers were formed and the coal continued to pile up in the furnace 
until unturned coal and loose ash had to be removed with a shovel. The 
above illustrates what would very easily happen in a household stoker; 
no householder would tolerate the dust and smoke caused by having to 
remove unburned coal and loose refuse with a shovel. 

It may be concluded that if such an Alberta coal as this Cascade 
sample is to be treated with chemicals, then this treatment must be done 
in the preparation of the coal. 

Sample 617/44, a coking medium volatile bituminous coal, was also 
treated with an iron compound in an attempt to make it clinker satisfactorily. 
The trial was not satisfactory and no further work was done along this 
line because of the strong ’coke-trees’ formed by this coal in the 
underfeed. 

The iron compounds used were expensive, but were used only as an 
experiment. After consultation with Dr. J.A. Allan regarding naturally 
occurring ochre deposits, it was decided to experiment with these ochres 
in treating coals. However the approach of winter forced this side 
investigation to be postponed, since the known ochre beds rich in iron 
are in the mountains and are Inaccessible in winter. 

C. Effect of Blending . 

Blending of refractory ash coals with coals having a fusible ash is 
a common commercial procedure to obtain a fuel which will clinker in an 
underfeed stoker. Blending is also used to prevent the formation of strong 
’coke-trees’ by coking coals. The coking coals in Alberta generally have 
infusible ashes so that blending with fusible ash coals may improve the 
coking coals in two ways: by partially preventing the formation of 
’coke-trees’ and by producing a clinkering ash.

A number of stoker tests were made on blended coals; a summary of these 
tests follows. 

Blending with. Non-coking coals . 

616/44, a semi-anthracite (non-coking) coal from Cascade area, was 
blended with a lower rank coal, 618/44, from Camrose Area. Table XII 
summarizes data relevant to this blending experiment.

Stoker tests were made using the 15 f on 15* off, 10* on 30* off, 2’ 
on 58 f off periodicities on a blend of 75/ of 616/44 and 25/ of 618/44. 
The two fastest rates of operation gave very satisfactory clinkering 
but the refuse from the stay-alight rate was not clinhered. This latter 
point was not considered important since a household stoker usually 
operates for longer than two minutes each hour at least several times a 
day during even the mildest weather. 

One run was made at the 15’ on 15* off periodicity using a blend of 
50/ of each coal, but no perceptible difference was noted in the clinkers 


formed.

In blending lower rank coals with high rank coals, the minimum amount 
of the former which will produce a satisfactory clinker should be used 
to keep the calorific value of the fuel as high as possible. An 
insufficient amount of 618/44 remained after these runs to permit tests 
being made on blends with lower than 25/ lower rank coal. On a commercial 
basis, however, it would be unwise to use less than 25% of the lower 
rank coal since the ash fusion temperature for coals from the same mine 
often varies considerably, and a blend with less than 25%, of the lower 
rank coal might occasionally give trouble from poor clihkering. 

The cone series of the ash of the blend of 75 % 616/44 and 25%, 

618/44 is illustrated in the eighth cone series in Figure XIII- The 
seventh (616/44) and ninth (618/44) series illustrate the ash fusion 
temperatures for the coals used in the blend. Blending has lowered the 
softening temperature from +2685° F. to 2685° F», and has decreased the 
calorific value by 1330 B,t,u,/lb. Although the ash percentage has been 
decreased from 10.5 to 9,8, the ash calculated on the basis of pound 
ash per them, of heat release has been increased from 0.76 to 0.79. 

25/ of another lower rank coal, 619/44 from Taber area was blended 
with 75/ of 616/44. Clinkeri ng was poor. The softening temperature of 
the ash of 619/44 was 2380° F.; this was 235° F. higher than that for 
618/44, 

The above trials on blending illustrate that the lower rank coal 
used to reduce the refractory nature of the high rank coal ash should 
have a low softening temperature so that a small amount of the lower rank 
coal can be used and so keep the calorific value of the blended fuel as 
high as possible.

Blending with Coking Coals . 

617/44, a medium volatile bituminous coal (strongly coking) from 
Mountain Park area produced unsatisfactory clinkers in the underfeed 
stoker. Very small pieces of fragile clinker were formed which were too 
small to allow removal. Strong ' coke-tree.s', sometimes two feet in 
height, formed in the retort area and when these 'coke-trees* broke, much 
of the combustible matter fell out of the hot fire zone. The refuse 
thus consisted of a small amount of loose ash and a large amount of 
unburned coke. These unburned pieoes of coke were raked back into the 
hot fire bed, but owing to the poor clinkering nature of the ash, no way 
of removing the refuse was possible except by means of a shovel. 

It was noted that 'coke-tree' formation gave less difficulty when 
the combustion bed was allowed to build up to a depth of approximately 
sixteen inches. With a deep fire-bed a coke formation at the tuyere level 
of the retort was pushed up through the hot fire giving the coke a better 
chance to burn. 'Coke-trees' still protruded above the fire-bed, but 
they were of weaker structure. They usually collapsed before building up 
higher than a foot and thus tended to fall into the hot fire zone rather 
than outside of it. 

617/44 was blended with 618/44 in ratios of 3:1, 2:1 and 1:1. Coking 
appeared to give as much trouble with the 3:1 and 2:1 blends as with the 
original coal but the 1:1 ratio gave notably less coking trouble. However, 
satisfactory clinkering was not obtained with any one of the three blends. 

One run was also made using 40/ of 619/44 and 60/ of 617/44, but again no 
satisfactory clinkering was obtained. 

It should be noted that the softening temperature of 617/44 was 
2595° F. while that for 616/44 was +2685° F., yet the latter coal gave a very

satsifactory clinker with 25 % of 618/44 while the .former when blended with 
the same lower rank coal did not clinker satisfactorily. The explanation 
for this peculiarity probably lies in the coking nature of 617/44. When 
the blended fuel reaches the burning zone, the pieces of free-burning 
lower rank coal are ignited easily and burn quickly. The coking coal loses 
its volatile matter, becoming plastic in doing so, and forms a coke which 
burns slowly as it is pushed up through the fire bed. Thus there is 
segregation of the refuse from the two coals, the low rank coal ash forming 
small clinkers around the edge of the retort and the coking coal ash, 
which makes up the largest bulk of the refuse, being found on the top 
and sides of the fire bed. This segregation of the refuse was noted in 
the fire bed particularly with the 1:1 blend. 

The coking tendency of 621/44, a medium volatile bituminous coal 
from Crowsnest area, was less pronounced than it was for 617/44, but its 
ash was more refractory in nature, its softening temperature being +2635°F. 
When blended with 619/44, and when the fire bed was allowed, to become deep, 
it showed no tendency to coke badly. However blending of 621 with 618 did 
not produce a satisfactory clinker. 

It may be concluded that a strongly coking coal is not suited to such 
an underfeed stoker as the one used in this investigation. A recent 
publication by Charles H. Sawyer and Walter Knox(l^), on work done for 
Hoppers’ Company, makes a number of suggestions regarding the use of coking 
coals in underfeed stokers. Most of these suggestions ar? not applicable 
to the work being done by the Research Council since they have to do with 
modification of stoker design. Suggestions which are useful are: 

(a) insufficient air supply aggravates the formation of large blocky coke.

although raising the air above 30 to 40 per cent excess air does not 
further improve the character of the coke formed, (b) increasing the coal 
feed results in a somewhat more friable coke structure, and (c) increasing 
over-fire draft improves the character of the coke formed and reduces 
troublesome accumulations by accelerating off-period burning. 

Suggestions (a) and (c) above were tried in the stoker tests on 617/44 
and 521/44 and were found to reduce 1 coke-tree 1 formation very little. 

D. Effect of hashing . 

While a suitable underfeed stoker fuel must have enough ash to 
protect the tuyeres from the intense heat of the combustion bed, still the 
ash content must not be excessively large so that the refuse accumulated 
between clinker removals interferes too much with the normal operation of 
the stoker. In this investigation the difficulty experienced in regard to 
the ash content of the coals tested in the underfeed was not that the ash 
content was too small, but, rather that, it was too large. The possibility 
existed that many of these high ash coals could be made more satisfactory 
for underfeed stokers by reducing the ash content. This reduction would 
be made by better preparation which might include wet or dry washing. 

The fusion temperature of the original- coal ash may or may not be 
different from the fusion temperature of the washed coal ash, i.e., 
washing may change the clinkering nature of the coal ash depending upon 
the distribution of the inorganic constituents in the coal. 

No stoker tests were made to compare the clinkering properties of 
washed and unwashed coals owing to the' difficulty of washing a large 
sample on a laboratory basis or a small sample in a commercial washery. 
However three coals were investigated on a laboratory scale, using a

Figure XIV illustrates the cone series for the ashes of the three 
coals and three floats. 

Sample 605/44 ( original), a coal with a low enough ash for satisfactory 
use in an underfeed stoker, produced clinkers that were too dense, i.e., the 
refuse formed blocky chunks of non-porous clinker. As an experiment a 
washing test was done on this coal even though a coal with 8.8^ ash is not 
usually considered for washing on a commercial basis. It is to be noted 
from the above table that the ash has been decreased approximately fifty 
per cent by washing, and the ash fusion temperature is approximately the 
same as for the unwashed coal. Considerable decreases are noted in % SiOg 
and CaO, while increases occurred in % AI 2 O 3 and. FegOg. No definite 
prediction can be made regarding the probable type of clinkering, but it 
is likely that there would be little difference between the clinkers formed 
from the original and washed coals.

The % ash in 602/44 was definitely too high for satisfactory stoker 
use. This washing test decreased the ash by more than fifty per cent 
and lowered the softening temperature of the ash slightly. It is probable 
that this coal would produce a very satisfactory underfeed stoker fuel, 
since the main criticisms of the original coal were the high percentage of 
ash and insufficient clinkering; a small reduction in the ash fusion 
temperature would probably tend toward better clinker formation* 

The clinker formation of the ash of 607/44 original was satisfactory 
but, as noted previously, the ash content was too high for satisfactory 
use in an underfeed stoker. Washing would probably produce a satisfactory 
stoker fuel from such a coal as 607/44.

SMOKE TESTS 


A. Introduction * 

' The tendency of a coal to produce smoke while it is burning is one of 
the properties which determine the proper use of the coal. Smoke does 
represent a small loss of heat value, but worse features are that it 
pollutes the atmosphere and causes the deposition of an insulating layer 
of soot on radiation surfaces in the furnace and flue pipes and thus causes 
a serious decrease in efficiency of heat transfer. This soot must be 
removed once or more per heating season to keep the efficiency of a 
heating unit up to a reasonable level and to prevent chimney fires. Many 
cities have by-laws which forbid pollution of the atmosphere by smoke. 

A coal may produce excessive smoke in one installation while it may 
prove quite satisfactory in another. To illustrate, consider the combustion 
of a moderately smoky coal such as 605/44 from Saunders area. In the 
underfeed stoker the coal is subjected to a gradual preheat before it 
reaches.the fire-bed. The volatile matter distilled off in this preheat 
must pass up through the fire-bed before it reaches the chimney. For 
605/44 the volatile matter was almost completely burned before leaving the 
combustion chamber and thus no smoke was noted issuing from the chimney. 

In the overfeed stoker 605/44 exhibited moderate smokiness at all times 
during the 15* on 15* off and 10* on 30* off runs. In this stoker the 
coal is pushed on at the end of the retort about eight inches away from the 
active combustion zone. Thus the fresh coal suddenly is subjected to an 
intense heat causing the volatile matter to be distilled off quickly. The 
volatile matter does not pass up through the burning zone but is carried 
directly into the radiator and flue pipe and thence into the chimney.

That is, it uickly reaches a relatively cool part where combustion can 
no longer take place and thus some of the volatile matter issues from 
the chimney as smoke. 

The smokiness of 605/44 in the overfeed was worse than usual for 
approximately one minute at the beginning of each off period. During this 
time fresh coal was still being subjected to an intensely hot fire and the 
volatile matter was still being distilled off. But the latter was not 
supplied with sufficient air for the normal amount of combustion in the 
furnace and flue pipes; thus excessive smokiness lasted until combustion 
slowed down. 

Bituminous (coking) coals are apt to produce excessive smoke in under¬ 
feed stokers. These coals have a high volatile content and form ’coke-trees’ 
in the combustion chamber of the furnace. Just before the coal reaches 
the burning zone it forms a soft plastic mass and much of the volatile 
matter is released quickly. The plastic mass then becomes hard forming 
’coke-trees’. The latter cause channelling of the air supply and thus 
the volatile matter rising through the fire-beet is not well mixed with 
air and seme of it escapes from the combustion chamber without being 
burned and issues from the chimney as smoke. 

The bituminous (coking) coals are smoky because the usual methods of 
firing do not distribute the air supply well enough to burn the high volatile 
content efficiently. Bituminous coals which are non-coking, e.g., high 
volatile C bituminous, are not difficult to burn and do not produce 
excessive. smoke, even though the volatile matter content is approximately 
the same as for the coking coals. Lower rank coals, whilst possibly having 
as high a volatile content as the coking bituminous coals ? have a high 
oxygen content and a low ignition temperature and thus tend to burn 
freely without smoke.

Construction of Apparatus. 

The apparatus as illustrated in Figure XV was constructed to give a 
quantitative measure of the amount of smoke produced by a coal during its 
combustion^after two early attempts to measure smoke by visual observation 
proved fruitless. The third apparatus was designed so that the smoke 
produced by a coal interferes with a beam of light falling upon a 
photronic cell. The amount of this interference is measured by a micro- 
ammeter which registers the photronic cell current. 

A sheet iron box, 14” long, 5 1/4" wide, and 4 l/2 ,! deep, standing on 
four 4” legs, encloses an alundum tube 10" long and 2" in diameter (inside). 
The outside of the alundum tube is spirally grooved and is wound with 
eighty-seven full turns of 16 gauge nichrome wire; alundum plaster about 
1/4" thick covers the wire on the outside of the tube. Insulating brick 
fitted around the tube holds the latter in place so that the openings at 
each end of the tube are directly connected to 2” openings in the ends of 
the box. 

One end of the furnace is fitted with a 3" collar for attaching the 
chimney of 3" vent pipe. A chromel-alumel thermocouple is held in position 
so that its bare wire end is approximately at the center of the furnace. 

A damper was put in the first length of vertical pipe above the furnace as 
shown in Figure XV. The total length of vertical pipe measured from the 
bottom of the 2" furnace opening is 49". The horizontal distance between 
the centers of the vertical sections of the double T pipe, i.e., the 
horizontal distance where the smoke interferes with the beam of light, is 
7 3/4" in length.

As shown in the figure wooden boxes enclose the light source, lenses, 
photronic cell, etc. One side on each box is hinged at its end so that 
the side opens out from the box. The light source is a 150 watt reflector 
type Mazda lamp; the inside of the box enclosing this lamp is lined with 
asbestos. A lens, 5 cm. in diameter, is so placed that its focal point is 
approximately centered on the lamp filament in order to obtain a nearly 
parallel beam of light through the horizontal pipe. At first a diffusion 
screen was placed at the focal point between the lens and the light source, 
but the screen did not permit enough light to reach, the photronic cell 
to give a reasonably large microammeter reading. An iris placed between 
the light source and the lens stops light going through the outside part 
of the lens and thus prevents some aberration. The opening in this iris 
is 1 n/i 6 " in diameter. 

A small pane of 'X-ray plate' glass protects each lens from smoke and 
heat damage; the glass tightly covers the opening of the box into which the 
horizontal pipe fits. The photronic cell is so placed that the beam of 
light focussed through the lens strikes the center of the cell's face. It 
was found that consistent results could only be obtained by placing an iris 
between the lens and the photronic cell to allow the primary beam of light 
to strike the cell but to prevent the secondary ring from striking the cell. 
The diameter of the opening in this iris is 5/l6 M . 

In the first model of this apparatus the two wooden boxes were 
placed close ’to the ends of the horizontal part of the double T pipe. 

During each run with this first apparatus soot was deposited on the glass 
plates and a correct measure of the smokiness of a coal could not be obtained. 
To prevent this deposition of soot, the upper framework was extended to

permit the insertion of a 12 M length of horizontal pipe between the ends 
of the double T pips and the wooden boxes. Sixteen vent holes each 1/16'* 
in diameter were bored in these 12" lengths of pipe approximately l/2" away 
from the ends of the boxes to permit a slight positive draft away from 
the glass windows. No trouble is now encountered with soot deposition. 

C. Test Procedure . 

To correlate smoke results for a coal obtained from this furnace with 
the smokiness of this coal in actual practice, a proper balance between 
the furnace temperature and.the natural draft of the chimney had to be 
secured. After some experimentation it was decided to place the coal in 
the open end of the furnace in such a way that the coal would catch fire 
and all the smoke would be driven off in approximately one minute. It was 
found that this required a furnace temperature of 850 ± 10° C. when the coal 
was placed in the furnace 2 3/4" from the open end. The draft obtained 
from 49" of vertical pipe (with damper open) gave smoke results for several 
typical coals consistent with the known smoking properties of these coals. 

Then a suitable amount and a suitable sizing of sample were selected. 
After considerable experimentation the amount of sample chosen was 1.0 + 0.1 

gram and the sizing chosen was through 4 mesh (0.185") and retained on 8 
mesh (0.093") standard Tyler screens. 

In making a smoke test the furnace is plugged at its open end and is 
heated to 850° C. A one gram sample of 4-8 mesh coal is weighed out. The 
light is switched on and the microammeter reading adjusted to eighty 
microamperes by means of a variable rheostat. The plug is then removed and 
the sample of coal placed in the furnace 2 3/4" from theopen end by means

of a spoon with a bar across its hand!3. Microammeter readings are then 
taken at intervals of five seconds until the readings again reach eighty 
microamperes* Three runs are usually made and the results averaged. 

The average readings for the five second intervals are subtracted from the 
initial reading and the numbers obtained are expressed as percentages of 
the initial reading. These percentages of light absorbed are then plotted 
against tame in seconds. The curve obtained illustrates the smokiness 
of the coal. Curves for four typical coals are shown in Figure XVI. 

Five suggestions were followed in attempting to give a numerical 
value to the smokiness of a coal. These five methods were: 

(1) the maximum per cent light absorbed. 

(2) the area under the curve expressed as a percentage of the total 

area. 

(3) the average per cent of light absorbed over the thirty seconds 
interval of most smoke. 

(4) the average per cent of light absorbed over the twenty seconds 
interval of most smoke. 

(5) the average per cent of light absorbed over the ten seconds 
interval of most smoke. 

Three typical coals were used and it was found that (4) gave the most 
consistent results. The degree of smoke for a coal is defined as the 
average per cent light absorbed during the twenty seconds interval of 
most smoke. 

D. Results to Date . 

It has been realized for some time that the smokiness of a coal is 
related directly to the rank of the coal. The higher and lower rank coals

are smokless while the medium rank coals (bituminous) are smoky. This 
is shown very clearly in Table XIV and in Figure XVII. Also these show 
a close relationship between the degree of smoke and oxygen content. It 
should be noted that this oxygen content is on the dry basis, i.e., it 
does not include the oxygen of the moisture present in the coal substance. 
There is a rapid progression in degree of smoke to a maximum as the oxygen 
content increases (and as the coal rank decreases) from zero to approximately 
eight per cent. Ninety-five per cent degree of smoke is associated with 
high volatile A and 3 bituminous coals and with eight per cent oxygen. There 
is then a rapid retrogression in degree of smoke as the oxygen content 
increases (and as coal rank decreases) to approximately 16.5%. 

Figure XVII cannot be used to calculate the approximate degree of 
smoke in a blended fuel such as 616/44 (semi-anthracite) plus 618/44 
(subbituminous C). In this case the oxygen content (calculated - 5 , 8 %) 
would suggest that the blend should have a degree of smoke of approximately 
ninety per cent, yet this blended fuel is definitely smokless.

Suggested ,'Iodifications 

Owing to war time restrictions on the sale of microammeters and 
photronic cells, the instruments ordered months earlier for this smoke 
testing apparatus arrived just as this thesis was being written. The 
smoke results presented here were obtained with instruments borrowed from 
the Departments of Chemistry and physics. University of Alberta. 

These results indicate that the method is good, although not yet 
satisfactory, and that modifications of the apparatus are worthwhile and 
advisable before publication of the method. 

The proposed modifications include; re-wiring of the furnace and 
setting it in a vertical position instead of horizontal. When the furnace 
is re-wired, it will be possible to maintain its temperature at the 
desired level with the full natural draft of air through the furnace. 

With the vertical furnace, it is proposed to raise the coal up into the 
furnace in a gauze crucible to the desired height without having the coal 
touch the hot furnace walls. The gauze crucible will also obviate the 
difficulty of the proper placement of coal. 

A suggested modification in the procedure is the use of a variable 
weight of sample, i.e., to test a constant heat value rather than a 
constant weight.
