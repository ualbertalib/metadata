SYNOPSIS 


The primary purpose of this study was to determine 
the effectiveness of the California Language Tests, 

Elementary and Intermediate, as tests of English usage for 
selected Alberta pupils. Two randomly chosen samples were 
drawn from grades four and seven pupils of large urban and 
small urban centres in the province. The elementary test 
was administered to the grade four pupils and the intermediate 
to grade seven pupils. 

The proportions of correct responses to each item of 
the tests were computed. Those recorded by the twenty-seven 
percent scoring highest and the twenty-seven percent scoring 
lowest, were employed in the item analysis. To determine 
the effectiveness of the test items, the techniques of item 
analysis devised by J 0 C. Flanagan and by Frederick B. Davis, 
were employed. Internal consistency indices for each item 
were tabulated. Distributions and patterns of item difficulty, 
in terms of percentage of successes, for both tests and their 
components, were illustrated graphically. 

An examination of the data provided evidence to 
indicate that while some items of the California Language 
Tests, Elementary and Intermediate, exhibited relatively 
high discriminating power, in general, the internal consistency 
indices were sufficiently low to cast doubt upon the 
meaningfulness of the total score. The distributions of item

difficulty revealed that neither test is well adjusted to 
the levels of ability of the pupils sampled* The large 
proportion of relatively easy items in both tests, has the 
effect of reducing the power of the tests to differentiate 
between pupils at the upper levels of ability* Finally, 
the patterns of item difficulty were examined* In two sub¬ 
tests, considerations of item structure and responses 
compelled the authors to abandon any pretence at a pattern 
of ascending order of difficulty. In the remaining five 
tests, for our sample at least there is evidence of only 
nominal attention to the attainment of such a pattern.

CHAPTER I 


THE EVALUATION OF LANGUAGE ACHIEVEMENT 

Evaluation is that phase of education which 
is concerned with appraising the success of the 
school in attaining the purpose for which it is 
maintained by society.^ 

Evaluation is devoted to the measurement of changes 
in behavior brought about by a learning process. In a 
particular subject it should include attitudes, appreciations 
and work habits as well as knowledge and basic skills. 

Scores from standardized tests, which are designed to 
measure progress toward predetermined objectives, enable the 
teacher to compare the progress of one pupil with that of 
another, or to compare the average score for a particular 
class with a norm. The fact that the average score for a 
class compares favorably with a particular norm does not mean 
only that the pupils are progressing as well as other similar 
pupils; it also means that they are doing just as much poor 
work and that they have as many unsolved problems. 

Scales for the measurement of general achievement of 
written expression have proved to be reasonably satisfactory 
for the purposes of establishing standards. This information, 
while useful for administrative purposes, is of limited value

for the identification of pupil disabilities. 

The fact that thirty pupils are seated in the same 
classroom and are assigned to the same grade is no guarantee 
of their homogeneity. Numerous studies have served to point 
out that each pupil is an individual, different and distinct 
in some way from others, and although many pupils successfully 
attain the objectives of a particular topic, each member of 
the class, at one time or another, experiences some type of 
learning difficulty, regardless of his ability. Such 
difficulties, which first make their appearance in the primary 
grades, frequently persist throughout the elementary grades, 
into the high school and beyond. Unless adequate diagnosis 
is made and appropriate remedial measures are carried out, 
many children are left with unidentified difficulties which 
continue to retard their progress in succeeding years. 

Diagnosis is a logical process based on a consideration 
of all the available data concerning a particular individual. 
Fundamentally, diagnosis relates to the techniques by which 
one discovers the strengths and weaknesses of an individual 
as a basis for more effective guidance. 

In the area of language a great deal of diagnosis may 
be carried out in the day-to-day observation of the pupil’s 
written and oral expression. For adequate planning of 
regular language activities and remedial instruction, a 
systematic record of errors, in the form of a check list, is 
of great assistance. This should contain the objectives for

the grade and all preceding grades, simplified to meet the 
needs of the class. By means of such a guide, the teacher 
may check individual errors in composition at intervals 
throughout the term. Such an analysis frequently shows a 
few errors repeated over and over again. This discovery is 
of vital importance in planning the remedial program. 

The task of recording errors might be lessened to 
great extent by the use of tests which provide a detailed 
diagnosis of important learning difficulties. Many diagnostic 
tests are accompanied by a diagnostic chart for the class and 
an individual chart or profile for the pupil. After recording 
the errors in a class chart, the teacher is in a position 
to determine which errors are general enough to require class 
treatment, and those which require individual or small group 
attention. The individual diagnostic profile might be kept 
for individual progress records or be given to the pupil to 
encourage self-appraisal. 

Diagnosis in education, in its broadest sense, deals 
with a process that is characterized by change. The effects 
of each educational experience vary from pupil to pupil 
because of differences in maturity, experience and ability. 

The performance of an individual depends on the operation of 
many factors, such as the amount of effort he puts forth, 
his understanding of what is wanted, his environmental 
conditions and his interest in the activity. Variation in 
one or more of these factors results in a change in the

pupil f s performance on a test if the same test is repeated. 
Nevertheless, if teachers use reliable objective techniques 
of diagnosis, they can in many cases determine the elements 
in the learning situation that should be corrected. In 
recent years there have been developed diagnostic tests which 
locate with a high degree of accuracy many of the faults that 
have previously been recognized in a vague way through 
observation of pupil responses. One can believe that it may 
be possible to develop tests of types of learning difficulty 
that will be as infallible as the well-known Schick test in 
medicine.

CHAPTER II 


THE PROBLEM 

In an analysis of the strengths and weakness of an 
individual or groups of individuals, the effectiveness of 
measurement depends primarily on the reliability and 
validity of the instruments use. When a test is to serve as 
a diagnostic instrument as well as a test of general achievement, 
it must yield component as well as total scores, each of which 
must be reliable and valid measures. 

A test is reliable when it yields the same results 
consistently. If a group of persons taking the test, earn 
the same scores when the test is repeatedly administered, 
the test is measuring consistently and is said to be reliable. 

The consistency of the measurement is expressed in the 
reliability coefficient of the test. 

While a reliable measurement is certainly desirable, 
the tester must also assure himself that the test used is 
valid. A test is valid when it actually measures what it 
purports to measure. 

The validity of a test is best established by 
determining the correlation between the test scores and a 
criterion of known validity. When a criterion is not 
immediately available, an indirect method of correlating 
scores from the test in question with those of other 
established tests may be used for estimating the validity.

Test validity depends not only upon the validity of 
the content in general but also upon the validity of the 
individual items. The validity of the items, to a great 
extent, depends on the ability of the test author to select 
and to write objective items for each fact or idea to be 
tested. No amount of statistical work can make up for poorly 
written items or for a lack of editorial skill in preparing 
items for publication. 

When items are selected for a test, a number of 
considerations must be taken into account. One of these is 
the level of difficulty of the items. 

The difficulty of an item may be defined as the 
proportion of a certain sample of testees that marks 
the item correctly, or it may be defined as the 
proportion of a certain sample of testees that actually 
knows the answer to an item.4 

The solution to the problem of what constitutes the 
optimum level of item difficulty in an achievement test has 
not been agreed upon among test authors. Some authorities 
prefer approximately equal numbers of items at all levels 
of difficulty; others prefer to use a few easy and a few 
difficult items with the majority near the fifty per cent 
level of difficulty. There appears to be general agreement, 
however, that "the average difficulty of all items should be 
about 50 per cent”.5

Items are not suitable for inclusion in a test if 
they are so easy that no pupil fails to respond correctly or 
if they are so difficult that no pupil is able to respond 
correctly. 

The basic function of an achievement test is to place 
individuals along a scale of ability according to real 
differences in achievement. Such a function requires a test 
to discriminate between pupils of high and low levels of 
general achievement. The extent to which a test has this 
power is determined by the discriminating power of its items. 

An item is said to have maximum discriminating power 
if every pupil who responds correctly ranks higher in general 
achievement than any student who fails on the item. An item 
has zero discriminating power when there is no difference 
in general achievement of the students who succeed on an 
item and those who fail. The ideal test would consist of 
items of high discriminating power distributed evenly over 
the difficulty scale. 

Statistical techniques for expressing the discrimination 
index of an item require the use of an independent criterion 
measure of general achievement whose validity is very high* 

As it is usually difficult to secure a criterion of this 
quality, the total score on the test itself is frequently 
used as the criterion. When used in this way, the index 
really becomes an internal-consistency index. Such an index 
enables one to select items which are most effective in

measuring what the test as a whole measures. Items thus 
selected may be said to be valid only if the test itself 
is valid. 

A low index may be the result of technical weaknesses 
in the composition of the test item. Ambiguities, irrelevant 
clues and "catch" questions make items ineffective. A low 
index of discrimination may also indicate insufficient 
knowledge on the part of the student. In the case of a 
multiple-choice question, a plausible but incorrect response 
may be the most frequent choice of the able and less able 
students alike as the result of their lack of understanding 
of the element being tested. 

Finally, low indices may indicate that the "items are 
measuring rather specific points and are not highly correlated".^ 
If the area being tested includes a type of achievement that 
is not highly related to other achievements within the same 
area, then items testing for that type of achievement would 
not be expected to yield high discrimination indices. These 
items, in spite of their low indices, should be retained if 
they are essential for adequate measurement of the area in 
question. 

This immediately establishes a fundamental difference 
in the content of general achievement and diagnostic tests. 

A general achievement test is one designed to express in

terms of a single score a pupil*s achievement relative to 
others in the class. Its major purpose is to enable one to 
"rank" pupils in order of achievement and to interpret his 
score in terms of the norms provided for the test. 

The meaningfulness of a single score as a measure of 
general achievement, depends upon the homogeneity of the 
field being tested. If low or negative correlations exist 
between specific types of achievement, then no single measure 
can adequately describe a pupil*s achievement in all of these 
types simultaneously. Since there is no field of achievement, 
as usually defined in the present curriculum, in which all 
types of achievement are perfectly correlated, the use of a 
single general achievement test often will hide the fact that 
in certain types of achievement a pupil has deviated from his 
own general level. 

The items which make up a general achievement test 
must be considered as representing a very restricted sampling 
of all items which might be selected on the basis of the 
subject involved. Items are restricted to the extent that 
only those which exibit reasonably high discrimination indices 
are included. It is only then that a single score has any 
meaning. 

A diagnostic test, on the other hand, is one intended 
to discover specific deficiencies in learning within a 
particular field of achievement. Test items are selected 
for the purpose of sampling all areas of achievement within

the subject in question regardless of their correlation 
with one another* Their selection is based primarily upon 
logical rather than statistical considerations. Total scores, 
in such tests, have little meaning because of the heterogeneity 
of the area being tested and the lack of correlation between 
component scores. Part scores or the percentage of correct 
responses to homogeneous groups of items are the measures 
sought. 

Test users have been encouraged to expect a single 
test to serve as a general achievement test and a diagnostic 
instrument at the same time. Many such tests have in fact 
been constructed. This may account for the failure to 
recognize the legitimate functions and essential characteristics 
of each type of test, as well as for the failure to realize 
that the two types cannot often be effectively combined in a 
single test. 

The significance of a single score in a general 
achievement test depends upon the discriminating power of its 
items. It is desirable that the selection of items be 
restricted to those which correlate most highly with the total 
score so that a maximum in test homogeneity is achieved. 

In a diagnostic test, items are selected to provide 
unitary sub-tests w r hich measure independent areas of difficulty 
throughout the subject in question. Correlations between 
items and the total score, under such conditions, are frequently 
low or negative. Consequently, composite or total scores

have little or no meaning. 

It is not possible to have it both ways. The 
correlation between items and total score, which makes for 
good measurement of general achievement, interferes with 
effective diagnosis. Likewise the lack of correlation 
between component scores in diagnostic tests weakens 
effective measurement of general achievement. 

The rationale in achievement test construction is so 
completely at variance with that of diagnostic tests that 
adequate diagnosis from achievement tests is unlikely, due 
to the restricted sampling of items. Items are selected on 
the basis of their correlation with total score and are 
usually so few in number in essential diagnostic areas that 
component scores are unreliable. The use of diagnostic tests 
as general achievement measures is likewise unlikely because 
of the emphasis placed on unitary component tests. Items in 
these tests yield high correlations with their component 
scores but low correlations with a composite or total score. 
As a result, this heterogeneous measure produces a total 
score which is frequently both ambiguous and misleading.

CHAPTER III 


STUDIES RELATED TO DIAGNOSTIC AND ACHIEVEMENT TESTING 

1. Diagnostic Tests 

Markedly different procedures must be employed in the 
construction of achievement and diagnostic tests due to their 
difference in purpose. 

The principal purpose of achievement tests in education 
n is to enable us to rank pupils in a given group in the order 
of their total achievement within a given field. tf 5 Test 
results may be used in the classification of pupils for 
administrative purposes, the evaluation of teaching and the 
improvement of instructional methods. They also constitute 
an important preliminary to remedial teaching programs. In 
this connection, they are used in the identification of pupils 
with special disabilities and in measurement of progress in 
the course of remedial work. 

The diagnostic test is intended, not to assess levels 
of achievement, but to reveal individual learning difficulties. 
It is constructed in such a way that each related skill 
within the subject measured in isolation, one at a time, 
until the nature of the pupils weaknesses are revealed. 

There are several types of diagnostic tests. Some 
tests, such as the Sangren-Woody Reading Test, seek to locate

weaknesses by means of measurement of some of the specific 
phases of reading ability. Other tests, such as the 
Brueckner Diagnostic Tests in Fractions and Decimals, might 
be described as comprehensive inventories, the use of which 
enables one to locate a specific cause of difficulty for an 
individual. 

In a sense almost any test may be called diagnostic. 
However, "many of the tests that are labeled diagnostic by 
their authors are in fact tests of general achievement.”^ 

We must determine the adequacy of the diagnostic cues 
provided by a test purporting to be diagnostic. It is easy 
to overstate the value of the diagnostic information provided 
by a particular test. 

To be truly diagnostic, a test must be based on 
a detailed analysis that permits the exact location of 
the spot in the work at which there is difficulty, or 
of the phase of general ability in which there is a 
deficiency.' 

This requirement presents a serious problem to test 
authors. How is a diagnostic test, of reasonable length, 
to appraise component abilities with adequate reliability?

Tests generally have great difficulty in providing 
diagnoses which are reliable. The total score is often 
reliable, but decisions are made on the basis of sub¬ 
tests which are usually very short. Every sub-test is a 
test in itself and must demonstrate adequate reliability 
and validity. Moreover, since the diagnostic test is 
almost always intended to make important decisions about 
a particular individual, high reliability of sub-tests 
must be demanded.° 

The reliability and validity of diagnosis depends upon 
the frequency of appearance of items measuring the same or 
related elements within the test. Errors detected on the 
basis of one or two items of a given type may or may not be 
due to carelessness or the chance selection of items involving 
specific elements of weakness. Foster E. Grossnickle, in a 
review of an arithmetic achievement test in the Fourth Mental 
Measurement Yearbook, states that tT a diagnostic test must 
have at least three samples of a given type in order to 
provide a reliable diagnosis.”9 

Achievement examinations in the subject of language 
were among the first educational tests to be developed in 
America. In 1$45, the Boston school committee was charged 
with the responsibility of making a yearly achievement 
inventory.10 Previously this had been done by oral examinations

but for the sake of the economy of time, written examinations 
were found necessary. Examinations were constructed for the 
subjects of arithmetic, astronomy, geography, grammar, 
history and natural philosophy. 

In l£94, Dr. J. M. Ricer^ developed the first objective 
spelling tests in America. In 1912, a notable test, the 

1 p 

Hilegas Composition Scale made its appearance. This scale 
did much to stimulate interest in more accurate measurement 
of written composition. 

Despite the fact that language was one of the 
first school subjects in which experimental measurement 
in education was undertaken, progress in the development 
of measuring instruments in this field has not been 
particularly notable.13 

This lack of progress in the development of adequate 
measuring instruments in language may be due, in part, to 
the complexity of the skills involved in written language 
and to the vagueness with which the objectives have been 
expressed.

The California Language Test is among the most recently- 
developed instruments for the measurement of language 
achievement. It is ,T the new edition of the diagnostic-survey 
instrument formerly called the Progressive Language Test”.14- 
Test authorities have recognized many admirable 
qualities in the California Language Tests, Such features 
as the ease of administration and scoring, the achievement 
profile and the care taken in the preparation of the norms 
have been recognized by authorities as commendable. Other 
features of the tests have come under rather sharp criticism, 
most of which is directed toward the diagnostic power that 
the test is purported to possess. 

In her book called "Psychological Testing”,^5 Anne 
Anastasi describes the content and the organization of the 
California Achievement Tests including the California 
Language Test. She expresses doubt regarding the reliability 
of diagnostic categories containing as few as one or two 
items. Concerning the diagnostic features of the tests 
Dr. Anastasi states: 

Although of possible help in suggesting specific 
weaknesses in the individual’s mastery of a skill, such 
an analysis may be quite misleading because of the small 
number of items involved. The reliabilities of the five 
major tests at each level appear to be adequate for

survey purposes. No reliabilities are reported, however, 
for the sub-tests, some of which are very short. As for 
the further breakdown into functional elements, it is 
apparent that chance errors of measurement may play a 
considerable part in the results obtained in individual 
cases.16 

R. L. Thorndike and E. Hagen, the authors of "Measurement 
and Evaluation in Psychology and Education",17 comment on the 
pros and cons of fractionation in the California Achievement 
Tests. They admit that the use of sub-scores provides more 
specific information about what the individual is able to do. 
They point out, however, that fractionation is accompanied 
by shortening of the separate parts and that this shortening 
inevitably leads to lowered reliability in a diagnostic area 
where high reliability is most urgently needed. The result 
is that a test profile is created, with a number of deviations 
recorded, many of which are probably without significance. 

Thorndike and Hagen suggest that a set of short and 
relatively diagnostic test scores might be used to advantage 
for a class rather than an individual. In the pooled results 
for a group, "chance errors of measurement tend to cancel 
out so that even a relatively unreliable test is adequate to 
bring out group differences."^

Reviews of the California Language Tests are written 
in ,T The Fourth Mental Measurements Yearbook*^- 9 by Robert C. 
Pooley and Gerald V. Lannholm. 

Robert Pooley questions the validity and reliability 
of diagnoses based on the sub-tests and smaller diagnostic 
categories because of the few items involved. His main 
criticism is directed toward the limited content sampled by 
the items, particularly in the intermediate and advanced 
tests. He laments the fact that children are presumed to 
learn nothing more about language, other than grammatical 
facts, after the fourth grade. 

Pooley suggests that an advance in the power to sustain 
an idea, improvement in sentence structure and an increase in 
the ability to organize and present materials logically are 
the skills on which pupils should be tested. He states that 
"since the California Language Tests ignore these basic 
factors, the use of the tests above the fourth grade can yield 
returns increasingly unrelated to the measurement of skill 

in language."20 

Gerald V. Lannholm states that in his opinion tT the 
tests will serve better as measures of general achievement 
than they will as diagnostic-analytic instruments."21

He bases this conclusion on his opinion that the California 
Language Tests do not adequately sample each of each of the 
elements of learning or skills involved. 

The major criticisms of the California Language Tests 
appear to be directed toward two aspects of the tests, the 
reliability of the diagnostic categories and the content 
sampled by the tests. 

There appears to be general agreement that diagnoses 
based on sub-scores and smaller diagnostic categories will 
be quite unreliable because of the few items measuring each 
skill. While this may be true for individual diagnosis, it 
is suggested that diagnostic scores will be of value for 
group diagnosis where chance errors tend to cancel out. 

The authors of the California Language Tests have 
restricted the selection of items to those which measure "some 
of the most tangible and easily identifiable objectives of 
the curriculum."^2 Such skills as the use of capital letters 
and punctuation marks, and the recognition of complete 
sentences and parts of speech are measured in these tests. 

The ability to organize and present material logically, the 
ability to sustain an idea and an advance in sentence structure, 
are some of the major outcomes of effective language instruction 
which are ignored.

2, Studies Related to Item Selection 

Although considerable concern has been expressed by- 
test authorities regarding the diagnostic value of the 
California Language Tests, little has been reported about 
their effectiveness as tests of general achievement. Some 
writers have remarked upon the inadequacy of the content 
but few have questioned the choice of items on the basis of 
their power to discriminate between levels of ability. 

As the reliability and validity of a test depend upon 
the characteristics of the items, it follows that a test may 
be improved through the selection, substitution or revision 
of its items. With the growing refinement of test construction, 
the use of item analysis to improve test efficiency has 
received increasing attention. 

A study conducted by John E. Anderson^3 illustrates 
the effects of item analysis upon the discriminative power 
of an English achievement test. 

Following the administration and marking of an English 
examination, the tests were divided into three piles, an 
upper, middle and lower third on the basis of total score. 

The proportion of correct responses to each item for each 
third was computed and items which discriminated between

the Discriminative Power of an Examination”, Journal of 
Applied Psychology , Volume 19, 1935, pp. 237-244

groups were selected for subsequent examinations. Items of 
zero or negative discriminative power were removed from the 
test. 

Of a total of 222 items, eighty-six of high discrim¬ 
inating power were selected as tr good items TT , eighty-three of 
low discriminating power were selected as ”poor items” and 
fifty-three items occupying intermediate positions were 
removed from the test. The pool of good items was referred 
to as a ”good item test” and the poor items as a ”poor item 
test”. The tests were rescored to obtain the total score for 
each pupil. An analysis of the scores produced the following 
results. 

1. The standard deviation and range of scores of the 
poor item test were considerably lower than those of 
good item test. 

2. The scores from the good item test correlated .95 
with the total test score. 

3. The scores from the poor item test correlated .45 
with the total test score. 

4* The correlation between scores on the good and 
poor item tests was .21 . 

Anderson states that ”the fact that the reduced 
examination composed of good items, constituting approximately 
one-third of the total number of questions, correlates .95 
with the total examination score, shows that the good items 
alone are almost as valuable as the total examination.” 2 ^

To arrive at an indication of the validity of the 
full test, the good item test and the poor item test, scores 
were correlated with final English grades, gradings on three 
book reports, scores on an Iowa English test and scores on 
the Minnesota College Aptitude Test. 

Coefficients of reliability of the three tests were 
computed by the split-half method. The Spearman-Brown prophecy 
formula was then applied to determine the reliabilities of 
the good item and poor item tests if they contained 222 items. 

Anderson concludes as follows: 

1. The scores on the good item test predict the total 
test score with high accuracy and predict the final 
grade in English, book report grade and Iowa English 
scores better than does the total test. 

2. Item analysis resulted in the production of a good 
item test which had almost as great reliability as the 
total test and which, if it had possessed the same 
number of items, would have had noticeably greater 
reliability. 

A similar study was conducted by C. H. Lawshe Jr., 
and James S. Mayer^5 in which they compared two methods of 
item analysis to determine which produced the most reliable 
test. They also compared the reliability coefficients of

of Two Methods of Item Validation on Test Reliability",

short tests composed of good items with that of a longer 
test composed of good and poor items. 

An elementary psychology examination, containing 300 
items, was used as the basis for the study. Two indices of 
discrimination were determined for each item by the correlation 
method devised by Flanagan and by the D-value method based 
on Lawshe's nomograph, adapted from Kelley f s technique. The 
best 20, 40, 60, and 100 items were selected from the original 
300 by the use of the two item analysis methods. 

The reliabilities of the tests were computed by the 
split-half method and the following comparisons were made. 

1. In selecting forty and sixty items, the two methods 
produced tests with no difference in reliability. 

2. The Flanagan method produced the more reliable test 
of twenty items and the D-value method yielded the more 
reliable test of one hundred items. 

3. The difference between reliability coefficients of 
the 100 item test produced by the Flanagan method and 
the original 300 item test, was not significant. 

4. The difference between the reliability coefficients 
of the 100 item test, produced by the D-value method and 
the original 300 item test was significant at the 1 per 
cent level of confidence. The D-value test was the more 
reliable. 

These studies indicate that through item analysis, it 
is possible to shorten a test and at the same time increase

its reliability® This is particularly true when items are 
selected on the basis of internal consistency® 

Selecting items according to their internal consistency 
indices has the effect of conserving the items which have the 
highest intercorrelations. Consequently, the homogeneity of 
the test is raised and the ambiguity of the total score is 
reduced. In the measurement of general achievement, where 
the final score is of prime importance, the effectiveness 
of the test may be determined by the internal consistency 
indices of the items. 

Reliability of measurement in achievement tests, as 
in diagnostic tests, depends largely upon the number of items 
in the tests or component tests and also upon the quality of 
the items. Component tests, as used in diagnostic instruments, 
should, like achievement tests, be homogeneous measures if 
their scores are to have meaning.

CHAPTER IV 


RESEARCH DESIGN 


1. The Purpose of the Study 

This study was designed primarily to determine the 
effectiveness of the California Language Test items as 
general achievement test items for selected groups of Alberta 
pupils in grades four and seven. 

This investigation is concerned with the evaluation 
of the test which was used to determine the levels of 
language achievement of various groups of Alberta pupils. 

The results of previous studies in this project have been 
reported by G. R. Conquest, * 2 ^ T. J. Reid^? and Dr. H. T. Coutts 
and Dr. H. A. Baker. Reports of these studies may be found 
in the Alberta Journal of Educational Research, Volume 1, 

No. 2, June, 1955.

representative sample of 1,889 grade IV and VII pupils was 
selected from eight areas in the province. These areas 
were chosen on the basis of geographic location, racial 
origin of the population and socio-economic status. One 
town with a school population of between 250 and 1000 pupils 
was randomly selected from each area. 

The graded and ungraded samples, selected from each of 
the eight areas, were approximately proportional to the total 
school population of these areas. The graded rural sample 
was restricted to towns with a total school population of less 
than 250 . 

The city of Edmonton was randomly selected for the 
large urban sample and Lethbridge for the small urban sample. 

The present study has been confined to an anlysis of 
test results from a combined large urban and small urban 
sample. The grade IV sample contained 350 pupils (199 large 
urban and 151 small urban); while the grade VII contained 
341 pupils (197 large urban and 144 small urban). 

3. The Test Instrument 

The tests used in this study were the California Language 
Test, Elementary, Form AA for the grade IV sample and the 
California Language Test, Intermediate, Form AA for the grade 
VII sample. These tests were developed jointly by Ernest W* 
Tiegs, Ph.D., and Willis ¥. Clark, Ed.D., and are published by 
the California Test Bureau - 5916 Hollywood Boulevard, 

Los Angeles 28, California.

On page 2 of the California Language Test manual the 
authors state that their test TT is an instrument for accurately 
and objectively measuring pupil achievement in fundamental 
language skills. The test is standardized, and each item 
has been selected for its diagnostic value in measuring 
achievement in nineteen essential elements of language skill 
sampled in sub-test sections."^9 These tests are intended 
to measure only some of the basic skills of language and not 
the more complex factors which must be considered in assessing 
the quality of written expression. 

The California Language Tests are revised editions of 
the Progressive Language Tests. The tests at the primary, 
elementary and intermediate levels are published in four 
forms, while the advanced level is published in three. 

The California Language Tests are divided into two 
parts, Mechanics of English, and Grammar (Test Five) and 
Spelling (Test Six). 

Test Five of the elementary test, intended for grades 
IV, V and VI, is divided into three sub-tests or sections: 
Capitalization - Section A, Punctuation - Section B, and 
Words and Sentences - Section C. 

In the capitalization section, eight elements are 
tested, some of which are repeated so that the total possible

score is 15. The first letter of three, four or five words 
in each line has a number above it. The number of the letter 
that should be a capital must be marked on the answer sheet. 
The extent to which a pupil over-capitalizes does not affect 
his score. 

The punctuation section requires a period, comma, 
question mark or a quotation mark to be correctly placed in 
ten of a possible fifteen places in a story. There are five 
places where no punctuation is required. The score on this 
section is not affected by over-punctuation. 

The section on words and sentences is divided into 
two parts. The first contains ten sentences in which a 
knowledge of number, case, tense and good usage is tested. 

The second part contains ten statements, some of which are 
complete sentences. The pupil is required to determine which 
statements are complete and which are not. Alternate response 
items are used throughout this section and no correction for 
guessing is made. 

Test Six is a spelling test in which a pupil must 
select which, if any, of a set of four words is misspelled. 
There are thirty such sets in this test. 

Test Five of the California Language Test, Intermediate, 
intended for grades VII, VIII and IX, is divided into four 
sub-tests or sections: Section A - Capitalization; Section B - 
Punctuation; Section C - Words and Sentences; and Section D - 
Parts of Speech.

The capitalization section tests the use of ten 
elements, two more than were tested in the elementary test* 

The total possible score is fifteen* 

The intermediate punctuation test contains twenty 
items, five more than in the elementary punctuation test. 

The use of the period is not tested in the intermediate test. 
In its place the use of quotation marks within a quotation 
is tested. 

The words and sentences section of the intermediate 
test has two items on singulars and plurals in addition to 
that which was tested in the elementary test. 

Section D, Parts of Speech, is the only area in the 
intermediate test which is not similarly measured in the 
elementary test. This sub-test contains twenty multiple- 
choice items which require recognition of nouns, pronouns, 
verbs, adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions and prepositions. 

The intermediate Test Six is a spelling test containing 
thirty multiple-choice items. 

At the back of each test booklet, is an achievement 
profile on which a pupil T s test results may be recorded and 
graphed. This profile may be used to illustrate a pupil’s 
achievement in the mechanics of English, and grammar (as 
well as the component sub-tests), spelling and total language. 

To the right of the achievement profile is a check¬ 
list called a Diagnostic Analysis of Learning Difficulties. 
This list is intended to be completed for those pupils who

fall below a desirable standard. It contains the elements 
presented in the test along with the item number which test 
that element. 

The California Achievement Tests are considered to be 
power tests rather than speed tests. The authors state that 
the time limits of twenty-eight minutes for the intermediate 
test and twenty-five minutes for the elementary test are 
sufficient for about ninety percent of the pupils at each 
level. The remaining ten percent will have completed all the 
items they are capable of comprehending within these limits. 
In the event that a class completes a section before the 
specified time has elapsed, the examiner is instructed to 
proceed with the next section. 

The coefficients of reliability and standard errors of 
measurement for the California Language Tests have been 
determined by the use of a Kuder-Richardson formula and are 
presented in the manual as follows.

The authors of the California Language Tests state 
that their tests possess a high degree of validity, not only 
curricular but the more indirect cross-validation type as 
well. Coefficients of correlation between the Progressive 
Achievement Tests and seven other achievement test batteries 
are presented in a technical Report Supplementing Information 
Presented in the Manual of Directions”.31 The reader is 
reminded that the California Achievement Tests are revised 
editions of the Progressive Achievement Tests and that their 
validity may not be assumed on the basis of the validity of 
the Progressive Achievement Tests. Statistics supporting 
the validity of the California Achievement Tests are not 
reported in either the test manual or the technical supplement. 

In the test manuals, the authors state that the 
items of the California Language Tests have been developed 
through four editions. The original selection of items 
followed a study of the objectives of most of the modern city 
and state courses of study. The items were then tried out 
in a number of areas throughout the United States, and those 
which were found to be of value were selected. 

The authors further state that a number of studies 
have been made of the test items, the results of which have, 
with few exceptions, supported their choice. Where there

has been doubt as to the value of an item, it has been 
replaced by another. 

Neither the test manual nor the technical supplement 
report statistically the results of the validation studies 
of either the test as a whole or of the individual test 
items. 


4. Method of Investigation 
In determining the effectiveness of the California 
Language Test items as general achievement test items, two 
related factors were investigated: (a) the discriminating 
power of the test items, and (b) the difficulty of the items. 

At present, a wide variety of item analysis procedures 
is being used in test construction. The statistics most 
frequently employed as indices of item discrimination are 
the critical ratio, the product-moment coefficient of 
correlation, the phi coefficient of correlation, and the 
biserial coefficient of correlation. 

The critical ratio provides an indication of how 
certain one may be that a particular item discriminates 
between high scoring and low scoring groups, but does not 
permit direct comparisons of amounts of discriminating power 
possessed by a number of items. 

The phi coefficient is a product-moment coefficient 
computed from a fourfold table. Both the phi coefficient 
and the product-moment coefficient are unaffected by the 
size of the sample used for item-analysis purposes, but are

affected considerably by the proportion of the sample that 
answer the item correctly. 

Items of fifty per cent difficulty tend to be char¬ 
acterized by the highest product-moment r T s and phi 
coefficients. Consequently it is difficult to compare the 
discriminating power of items answered correctly by widely 
different proportions of the sample. 

The biserial correlation method is considered by many 
as being the most satisfactory measure of item validity or 
internal consistency. It is the measure of the relationship 
rt between each item and the total score, excluding the item 
in question”.32 This coefficient would probably find wider 
use if its computation was not so laborious. 

To approximate the biserial correlation coefficient, 
with less labor, a method was devised by T. L. Kelly33 in 
1939* Kelly demonstrated that the lowest and highest twenty- 
seven per cent of a sample are the most serviceable groups 
for use in item-analysis, even though the items are not all 
of fifty per cent difficulty. He also outlined a method of 
estimating product-moment coefficients between items and the 
total test score using the highest and lowest twenty-seven 
per cent as criterion groups.

In 1939, J. C. Flanagan, using the method described 
by Kelly, devised and discussed the use of a "Chart Showing 
the Values of the Product-Moment Coefficient of Correlation 
in a Normal Bivariate Population Corresponding to Given 
Proportions of Successes".34 While the coefficients taken 
from Flanagan 1 s chart are unaffected by item difficulty, 
they do not represent a linear function and therefore cannot 
be added, subtracted or averaged. This does not present a 
serious problem if one is interested only in comparing the 
discrimination power between items, but it does become a 
major consideration when the average index of discrimination 
for a number of items is required. 

To satisfy the requirement for an index of discrimination 
which is unaffected by item difficulty and is a linear function, 
Fredrick B. Davis prepared an item analysis chart containing 
item discrimination indices derived from Flanagan f s product- 
moment coefficients. 

Flanagan f s coefficients, which range from -.93 to +.93 
were transformed into Fisher*s z T s by the use of the following 

formula:33 

Z = 1/2 log e jjl+r) - log e (l-r)J

Davis then multiplied the z values, which represent a 
linear function, by a constant 60.241 (to five significant 
figures) to obtain item discrimination indices having a 
range from -100 to +100. 

The Davis Item Analysis Chart provides both item 
discrimination indices and difficulty indices based on the 
proportion of successes in the highest and lowest twenty- 
seven per cent of the sample. The difficulty indices range 
from 1 to 99 and constitute a linear scale. 

The Flanagan method and the Davis Method, which require 
essentially the same arrangement of data, were used in this 
study. The use of Flanagan’s r ! s permitted the computation 
of a coefficient of forecasting efficiency for each item. 

The writer was not primarily interested in exact 
differences of item difficulty. Instead, the general pattern 
of item difficulty and the average level of difficulty of 
sub-test and groups of items were the measures sought. 

Because of their ease of interpretation, the percentage of 
successes on each item was used instead of the Davis 
difficulty indices. 

To arrive at these statistics it was necessary to 
make a count of the number of correct responses on each item 
for each member of the large and small urban sample at the 
grade four and grade seven levels. From this, the percentage 
of successes for each item was computed. Distributions of 
these data were compiled and histograms constructed for the

total test and the sub-tests. The pattern of item difficulty 
in terms of percentage of successes was graphically illustrated. 

By the use of the foreraentioned data, the writer 
examined the elementary and intermediate tests for ineffective 
items and to determine how well the tests are adapted to the 
language abilities of samples of Alberta grade four and grade 
seven pupils.

CHAPTER V 


ITEM-ANALYSIS DATA 


1. Computations of the Proportion of Successes 


The item-analysis techniques described by Davis and 
Flanagan require computation of the proportion of successes 
on items in the twenty-seven per cent of the sample scoring 
the highest on the criterion and the twenty-seven per cent 
scoring the lowest* 

The proportion of successes is defined as the number 
of testees that know the answer to an item divided by the 
number of testees that respond to the item. The reader T s 
attention is drawn to the fact that the word "knows” is used 
in the definition rather than the word "marks". This 
distinction is desirable whenever multiple-choice items are 
used because a certain number of testees, without knowing 
the answer, will mark the correct one by chance. To make 
allowance for this fact, a correction for chance has been 
employed by subtracting from the number of testees who mark 
an item correctly, the number of testees who mark the item 
incorrectly, divided by one less than the number of choices 
in the item. The proportion of successes thus becomes:^6

where: R = the number of testees that answer the item correctly. 

W = the number of testees that answer the item incorrectly. 

K zz the number of choices in the item. 

Nr = the number of testees that respond to the item. 

Following the scoring of the test papers, a tally was 
made of the responses to each item for the combined large 
urban and small urban samples on each of the elementary and 
intermediate tests. The responses were classified as correct, 
incorrect or no response. From these classifications the 
proportions of successes were computed. 

In the computation of the proportion of successes for 
items in Sections A and B of both tests, no correction for 
chance was made. In Section A of the elementary test, the 
directions to the pupils state, TT Mark the number of each 
letter that should be a capital. Some lines may have no such 
letter. If a line has no letter that should be capitalized, 
leave it blank.” In Section B - Punctuation, the directions 
are essentially the same. Of four punctuation marks, the 
pupil must determine what marks, if any, are needed for each 
item. Consequently, on a four-choice item, the chances that 
the correct response is selected is 1 : 16 . 

The scoring procedure reduces the factor of chance 
still further by allowing credit for an item when a testee 
may select any number of the possible responses, provided that 
the correct response is included in the selection. It is 
possible, therefore, for a testee to receive a perfect score

by simply filling-in all responses spaces. No penalty is 
imposed for over-capitalization or over-punctuation. 

Since the indiscriminate application of capital letters 
and punctuation marks indicates a lack of knowledge of their 
use, it is surprising to find that pupils are not penalized 
for over-capitalization and over-punctuation. 

In Section B, a place is provided for the testee to 
indicate that no punctuation is necessary but such is not 
the case for Section A - Capitalization. Here, no capital¬ 
ization is indicated by no response to an item. This results 
in an ambiguity in the interpretation of responses. No 
response may indicate that the testee refrained from marking 
an answer because of a lack of knowledge or a lack of time. 

Or it might be interpreted to mean that the testee, after 
reading the item, decided that no capitalization was necessary. 

The test authors might have avoided this ambiguity by 
providing a place in Section A where the testee could indicate 
positively that no capitalization was needed. 

For the purposes of this study, it was assumed that a 
no response on the last items of Section A was a result of 
insufficient time for the particular testee to complete the 
item. No response on an item, at the beginning or between 
other marked responses, was assumed to indicate that the testee 
decided that no capitalization was necessary. Such responses 
were included in Nr of the following formula.

Where: P = the proportion of successes. 

R = the number of testees that respond to the item 
correctly. 

Nr = the number of testees that respond to the item. 

This formula results from subtracting the correction 
for chance from the formula quoted on page thirty-seven. 

Since both the elementary and intermediate tests are 
constructed in the same manner, they share weaknesses in the 
method of scoring of Sections A and B. 

2. Item Discrimination Indices 

Since both the Davis and Flanagan methods of item 
analysis require a computation of the proportion of successes 
in the highest and lowest twenty-seven per cent of the sample, 
a single assembly of data was sufficient for both methods. 
Following the computation of the proportion of successes, item 
analysis charts were used to determine the discrimination 
indices. 

The item-analysis chart, devised by Davis, is arranged 
in such a way that the percentage of successes of the highest 
twenty-seven per cent of the sample is located on the 
horizontal axis. The percentage of successes of the lowest 
twenty-seven per cent is located on the vertical axis. By 
reading horizontally and vertically from the previously 
determined percentages, two indices may be located simulta¬ 
neously, one immediately above the other. The upper index

is the discrimination index and the lower, a difficulty- 
index. 

The Flanagan chart is constructed in a similar manner 
with the proportion of successes of the highest twenty-seven 
per cent placed on the horizontal axis, the proportion of 
successes of the lowest twenty-seven per cent is on the vertical 
axis. Product-moment coefficients of correlation may be 
located in the same manner as are the Davis indices of 
discrimination. The coefficients are given in multiples of 
five with each of the same value and sign being joined by a 
line. A coefficient, other than one of a multiple of five, 
must be estimated by its location between two adjacent lines. 

No difficulty indices are to be found in the Flanagan chart. 

Coefficients of forcasting efficiency (E) which 
provide an estimate of the predictive efficiency of an 
obtained ,T r n , were derived from Flanagan T s product-moment 
coefficients as follows:^? 

E = 1 -ill - r 2 

where: E = the coefficient of forcasting efficiency 

r = the product-moment coefficient of correlation 
To illustrate the application of E, suppose that the 
correlation of an item with the total score is .45 • Then 
from the formula E — . 11 , and the item's efficiency in 
predicting the final score is said to be 11 per cent. This

means that in 11 per cent of the cases, pupils responding 
correctly to an item whose correlation with the total score 
is .45, will receive higher total scores than those who 
respond incorrectly. 

Table II contains item-analysis data based on the test 
results from the California Language Test, Elementary. The 
data in Table III are based on the results from the Intermediate 
test. 

In both Table II and Table III, R refers to the number 
of pupils responding to the item, and P the proportion 
responding to the item correctly. 

Items 5, 14, and 2$ in Table II and 6, 12, 13, 20 and 
24 in Table III require two responses each. The data for 
the responses to these items are numbered 1 and 2 in each 
table. 

It will be noted that, for a few items, the proportion 
of successes is negative after a correction for chance had 
been made. 

A negative proportion may be interpreted to mean 
that fewer testees marked the correct answer than would 
have been expected by chance, probably because many 
of them were misinformed rather than simply uninformed 
with respect to the point being tested.38 

Where the signs of the two proportions used to enter the 

item-analysis chart are different, there is no direct method 

of arriving at an accurate index of discrimination. Davis

states that in his experience, serviceable indices can be 
obtained for items when the proportion of successes in the 
lowest twenty-seven per cent of the sample is negative by 
altering the proportion arbitrarily to the proportion that 
would result from one-half a testee having answered the item 
correctly. 

In this study such a procedure was followed by 

/ 

entering the item-analysis chart at one per cent when a 
negative proportion occurred. The discrimination index thus 
obtained is always an underestimate. This fact is noted in 
Tables II and III by the addition of a plus superscript to 
the discrimination index, Flanagan T s n r !t and the coefficient 
of forecasting efficiency (E).

the more efficient is the item for general achievement test 
purposes. 

The question is immediately raised as to how high the 
relationship should be between the item and the criterion or, 
in this study, the final score. 

Items which exhibit either zero or negative correlations 
with the total score do not contribute to the final measurement 
and therefore have no value as general achievement test items. 

The point at which a positively correlating item should 
be removed from a general achievement test cannot be stated 
with any finality. It depends upon the author’s ability to 
produce another item which measures the same element yet 
correlates more highly with the final score. As indicated in 
the study by Lawshe and Mayer,39 reliability of measurement 
might be raised by removing seriously defective items or by 
adding items which exhibit high correlations with the total 
score. 

Davis states: 

Items with discrimination indices above 20 will 
ordinarily be found to have sufficient discriminating 
power for use in most achievement and aptitude tests.40 

The discrimination index of 20 is equal to a product” 
moment r of .33 and a coefficient of forecasting efficiency in 
predicting the final score of 5 per cent or more, to be of

value as general achievement test items. Presumably, those 
of less than 5 per cent efficiency might be replaced. This 
constitutes the basis upon which items of the California 
Language Tests were judged in this study. 

It is understood that such judgments must be made only 
with reference to the group of pupils actually tested. 

Validity values derived for test items have specific 
reference only to the groups of subjects actually involved, 
or to groups in which the criterion ability is very 
similarly distributed. An item cannot be deemed to possess 
a certain validity per se; the value obtained may differ 
very widely from that obtained for another, especially if 
the groups differ widely from each other, either as to the 
average level or as to the variability of the trait 
concerned.41 

The following conclusions, based on the data summarized 
in Table II for the California Language Test, Elementary, 
appear to be justified. 

1. Item 34 with a discrimination index of zero, should 
be removed from the test. This item fails to discriminate 
between levels of ability of testees in the group of large 
urban and small urban Alberta grade four pupils. 

2. Items 3, 11, 13, 14(1), 15, 1$, 23, 33, 35, 39 and 41 
should be replaced, if possible. These items have 
discrimination indices of 20 or less and are 5 per cent 
efficient in predicting the final score. Five per cent 

or less of the pupils responding correctly to these items

Validation of Test Items . Toronto, Dept. of”TIducation 
Res., University of Toronto, 1935, p. 117

will receive higher scores than those who respond 
incorrectly. 

3. Items 37, 3$, 43, 44, 45, 47, 49 and 50 have the 
highest discrimination indices in the test. These items 
have indices of 55 or more and are more than 30 per cent 
efficient in predicting the final score. 

4. Of a total of 53 test items in the California 
Language Test, Elementary, 12 or 23 per cent fail to meet 
the requirements for general achievement items as 
suggested by Davis.

The following conclusions are based on the data presented 
in Table III and have reference to Alberta grade seven pupils 
of large and small urban areas. 

1. Items 13(1) and 16 discriminate negatively and there- 
fore are of no value as general achievement test items. 

2. Items 32 and 71, with discrimination indices of zero, 
fail to discriminate between grade seven Alberta pupils 
of high and low levels of ability and should be removed 
from the test. 

3. Items 4, S, 14, 19, 20 (1), 30, 31, 34 and 37 have 
discrimination indices of 20 or less and are 5 per cent or

less efficient in predicting the criterion. According 
to the suggestion of Davis, these should be replaced by 
items which have higher discriminating power. 

4. Items 43, 5$, 62, 63 , and 67 have the highest 
discrimination indices in the test. Their indices of 
55 or more make them more than 30 per cent efficient in 
predicting total score. 

5. Of the $0 items in the intermediate test, 13 or 16 
per cent fail to meet the requirements for achievement 
test items as proposed by F. B. Davis. 

Table IV contains the percentage in each sub-test of 
the elementary and intermediate tests which, on the basis of 
the test results of Alberta pupils, may be considered 
inefficient to the extent that they should be replaced as 
achievement test items.

3. Summary of Findings 


1. Interpretation of responses in Section A of both 
tests would be facilitated by providing a place where 

a testee might indicate, positively, that no capitalization 
was needed. 

2. A testee should be penalized for over-capitalization 
and over-punctuation. 

3. Twelve of 53 test items or 23 per cent of the items 
in the California Language Test, Elementary, should be 
replaced as achievement test items. As previously stated, 
items such as these, with discrimination indices of 20 or 
less, have insufficient discriminating power for use in 
achievement tests. 

4* In the elementary test, Section B - Punctuation, 
contains the fewest inefficient items (13 per cent), while 
Section A - Capitalization, contains the most (29 per cent). 

5. Thirteen or 16 per cent of the intermediate test 
items should be replaced as achievement test items because 
of their lack of discriminating power. 

6. In the intermediate test, Section C - Words and 
Sentences, and Section D - Parts of Speech, contain the 
smallest percentage of inefficient items (5 per cent in 
each), while Section B - Punctuation, contains the largest 
percentage (32 per cent).

CHAPTER VI 


DATA ON ITEM DIFFICULTY 

1. Distributions of Item Difficulty 

If the only discrimination indices used in selecting 
items for a test are based on the total score, it is desirable 
that items having the highest indices be chosen. But if 
maximum efficiency of measurement is to be attained the 
requirements of distribution and pattern of item difficulty 
must also be taken into account. 

Items, measuring ability at one level with high 
discriminating power, may have very low discriminating power 
at a different level. The fact is well known that the discrim¬ 
inating power of an item is greatest when it is used in a 
sample in which fifty per cent of the testees respond to the 
item correctly. 

In construction of achievement tests, where maximum 
discrimination among all testees is desired, the optimum 
shape of the distribution becomes a function of the inter¬ 
correlations of the items. Flanagan, in 1939 stated: 

To obtain maximum discrimination among the individuals 
in a particular group, a test should be composed of items 
all of which are of fifty per cent difficulty provided that 
the intercorrelations of the items are zero ... It can be 
shown that a rectangular distribution of item difficulty ... 
is necessary to obtain maximum discrimination among members 
of the group provided that the intercorrelations between 
all of the items are unity.42

To illustrate Flanagan ! s line of reasoning, we will 
use as an example, a test of ten items with a sample of one 
hundred testees. The maximum number of discriminations that 
may be made by an item for one hundred testees is 50 times 50 
or 2,500. This occurs when the item is at a fifty per cent 
difficulty level. When an item is at another level of difficulty 
the number of discriminations is reduced. For example, an 
item of thirty per cent difficulty will make only 2,100 
discriminations. If the ten items are uncorrelated then they 
are able to make a maximum of 25,000 discriminations when each 
item is at a fifty per cent level of difficulty. 

Since the maximum number of discriminations that can be 
made by a single item with a sample of one hundred testees is 
2 , 500 , the maximum number of discriminations that may be made 
by ten perfectly correlated items of the same level of 
difficulty is also 2,500.. Under these conditions, the other 
nine items provide no additional measurement. If the TT ten items 
are evenly spaced from a difficulty level of five per cent to 
one of ninety-five per cent, a maximum of 4,525 discriminations 
may be made.” 

Since intercorrelations of unity or zero among test items 
would seldom if ever be found, the two hypothetical conditions 
stated by Flanagan may be considered to be limiting cases. The 
conditions encountered in practice are usually between these

two limits. 

Where item intercorrelations are low and positive, 
maximum discrimination will be obtained when the items cluster 
about the fifty per cent level of difficulty. However, as the 
”intercorrelations of test items are increased, the distribution 
of item difficulty should become more platykurtic with a 
smaller proportion clustering near the 5 0 % difficulty level. ,f 44 

In practice, the intercorrelations of a set of test 
items are seldom known. However, some indication of the 
relationship among items is provided by the size of the average 
discrimination index. 

If the discrimination indices of a set of well- 
edited items tend to run low, the reason is usually that 
the items are measuring rather specific elements and are 
not highly intercorrelated.^5 

In such cases, the most effective test would contain 
items covering a wide range of difficulty with the majority 
near the fifty per cent level. Where the discrimination indices 
are high, it might be assumed that the item intercorrelations 
are likewise high. In these circumstances, the most effective 
test would consist of items whose distribution of difficulty is 
nearly rectangular.

Language Tests, Elementary and Intermediate, and their component

computed by simply adding, algebraically, the Davis discrim¬ 
ination indices and by dividing the sum by the number of test

The fact that the average discrimination index for all 
items is low in both tests may be due to the fact that the 
items are measuring rather specific elements that are not 
highly intercorrelated. If this is the case, it might be 
expected that the items would be distributed over a wide range 
of difficulty with the majority near the fifty per cent level 
of difficulty. Sub-tests likewise have low average discrim¬ 
ination indices and should have distributions of item difficulty 
similar to those of the total test. Section C. of the 
elementary test and Section D. of the intermediate, having 
somewhat higher average discrimination indices than other sub-

tests, might be expected to have more platykurtic distributions 
of item difficulty. 

In this study, the percentage of success is used as an 
index of item difficulty. It is the percentage of pupils in 
the sample who responded correctly to a test item. The 
percentages of pupils responding successfully, unsuccessfully, 
and making no response are summarized in Tables VI and VII. 

The distributions of item difficulty are illustrated by 
histograms in Figures 1 to 9*

Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of difficulty in 
terms of percentage of success, for items of the California 
Language Test, Elementary. The data for this distribution are 
recorded in Table VI. 



Figure 1. Distribution of Percentage of Successes on Items 
of the California Language Test, Elementary 

The distribution of percentages of success, as illustrated 
in Figure 1, indicates that the range of difficulty of the 
items is satisfactory but that the test contains too many 
relatively easy items. With a mean percentage of success of 74? 
it contains too many items at the lower levels of difficulty 
and too few near the fifty per cent difficulty level.

The distributions of item difficulty of sub-tests, as 
illustrated in Figures 2, 3 and 4, indicate that the range of 
item difficulty in each case is too low for adequate measurement 
of general achievement of the sample used in this study. 

The capitalization test, with a mean percentage of success 
of 77, contains too many items at the lower levels of difficulty, 
too few at the upper levels and too few near the fifty per cent 
difficulty level.

The punctuation test, with a mean percentage of 
success of 56 , provides the best distribution of item 
difficulty of the three sub-tests. However, it contains too 
few items at the lower levels of difficulty. 

The average discrimination index for the words and 
sentences sub-test is 42. This index, being somewhat higher 
than those of the other sub-tests, suggests higher item inter¬ 
correlations in the sub-test. As stated earlier, an increase 
in intercorrelation of items should be accompanied by more 
platykurtic distributions of item difficulty. But this is 
not at all apparent in the distribution of percentage of 
success for the words and sentences test. 

Discriminations between levels of ability in the words 
and sentences sub-test are likely to be less than optimal 
because of the low range of item difficulty, the concentration 
of items at the lower levels of difficulty and the peaked 
distribution of item difficulty. 

Table VII summarizes the percentages of pupils 
responding successfully, unsuccessfully and making no response 
to the eighty items of the California Language Test, 
Intermediate.

The distribution of item difficulty in the California 
Language Test, Intermediate, as presented in Figure 5, indicates 
that there is an adequate range of item difficulty but that the 
test, like the elementary test, contains too many relatively 
easy items. The mean percentage of success for the test is 77.

The capitalization and words and sentences sub-tests, 
each with a mean percentage of success of 86, have very 
similar distributions of item difficulty. Both sub-tests 
contain too many relatively easy items and have insufficient 
range of item difficulty for the sample of pupils used in 
this study. 

The punctuation test, with a mean percentage of success 
of 78, contains too many items at the lower levels of difficulty 
and too few near the fifty per cent level. 

The parts of speech test is composed of items of a 
wider range of difficulty than is present in other sub-tests. 
There are, however, too many items at the lower levels of 
difficulty. 

With the highest average discrimination index of the 
four sub-tests, the parts of speech test appears to have the 
most platykurtic distribution of item difficulty. This should 
be expected in such cases as this where there is an indication 
that item intercorrelations are relatively high. 

In both the elementary and intermediate tests, the 
distributions of item difficulty are sufficiently peaked to 
indicate that a selection of items, on the basis of difficulty, 
had been made in the construction of the tests. But because 
of the large number of easy items in each test, the 
distributions are negatively skewed. This will have the effect 
of reducing the discriminating power of the tests at the upper 
levels of ability in the sample.

Both the elementary and intermediate tests were used 
on samples of the lowest grades for which they were designed. 

The elementary test, intended for grades four, five and six, 
was administered to a grade four sample, while the intermediate 
test intended for grades seven, eight and nine, was 
administered to a grade seven group. Since the tests contain 
an unduly large number of relatively easy items for grade four 
and seven pupils, it might be expected that the distributions 
of item difficulty would be still more seriously skewed if 
the tests were employed at their upper grade levels. This 
will result in less effective measurement of general achievement 
when the tests are administered to grades six and nine pupils. 

2. Pattern of Item Difficulty 

The current practice in test construction is to present 
items covering a wide range of difficulty, arranged in 
ascending order of difficulty from the very easy to the most 
difficult . This makes it possible for the less able pupil to 
respond to items within his level of ability without being 
discouraged early in the test by items of prohibitive difficulty. 
The most difficult items, at the end of the test, differentiate 
between pupils of superior ability. 

Where an achievement test contains a number of sub-tests, 
an arrangement of items in ascending order of difficulty might 
be expected in each sub-test. They should begin with their 
easiest items and end with the most difficult.

A control of levels of item difficulty provides 
effective measurement of achievement over a wide range of 
ability. It may also contribute to the motivation of pupils 
taking the test by arousing confidence in the less able and 
by presenting challenging situations to superior pupils. 

The patterns of item difficulty for the elementary test, 
are presented graphically in Figures 10, 11 and 12. The datum 
for each item, as recorded in Table VI, is presented in the 
order that the item appears on the test.

Figure 12. Percentage of Successes on Items of

An inspection of Figures 10, 11 and 12 reveals a 
tendency toward an increase in item difficulty in the sub¬ 
tests of the elementary test. This pattern of item difficulty 
is only slightly apparent from the test results of the sample 
used in this study. The large proportion of items of 
approximately the same difficulty causes the pattern of item 
difficulty to be barely descernible. 

Items in the sub-tests may have been arranged in 
ascending order of difficulty for the normalizing sample but 
evidence of this arrangement for the sample used in this study 
is minimal. 

The patterns of item difficulty for the intermediate 
sub-tests are presented in Figures 13, 14, 15 and 16. The 
data are recorded in Table VII.

The patterns of item difficulty of the intermediate 
sub-tests, as illustrated in Figures 13, 14, 15 and 16, are 
not so apparent as those of the elementary test. The 
capitalization and words and sentences sub-tests appear to 
have items of increasing difficulty only near the end of the 
tests. The pattern of difficulty in the punctuation and parts 
of speech tests is not at all apparent. 

The irregularities in levels of difficulty in the parts 
of speech sub-test may be due, in part, to the fact that 
pupils are asked to identify parts of speech in a single 
complete sentence. The construction of the sentence is such 
that a relative pronoun is placed immediately before a verb. 

And as the items are in the same order as the words in the 
sentence, a more difficult item, such as identifying a relative 
pronoun, appears before a less difficult item.

It appears doubtful that adequate control of levels 
of difficulty and the usual pattern of item arrangement may 
be accomplished when the additional factor of sentence 
structure is also involved in the construction of the parts 
of speech test. 

In the punctuation section of both the elementary and 
intermediate tests, items which require two responses have 
higher difficulty levels for the second response in each case. 
A possible explanation for this might lie in the fact that 
the directions to the student are not sufficiently explicit 
for them to expect items requiring two responses. The only 
indication that more than one response may be required is 
given in the last sentence of the directions which reads, 
rT Use the same answer row to show all punctuation needed at 
any one number in the story. tT 

This may have the effect of making items requiring 
double responses, more difficult than they would be if the 
elements being tested, were presented separately. 

3. Summary of Findings 

1. The distributions of item difficulty for both the 
elementary and intermediate tests are peaked, indicating 
that a selection of items on the basis of difficulty, 
has been carried out in the construction of the tests. 

2. The distributions of item difficulty for both tests 
are not well adjusted to the abilities of Alberta grade 
four and seven pupils of large and small urban centres.

Because of the large proportion of relatively easy items, 
all distributions of difficulty are negatively skewed. 

This is most pronounced in the capitalization and words 
and sentences sub-tests of the intermediate test, and in 
the words and sentences section of the elementary test. 

3. There is a slight tendency for the items in the sub¬ 
tests of the elementary test to be arranged in ascending 
order of difficulty, from the least to the most difficult. 

4. A similar pattern of item difficulty in the intermediate 
test is somewhat apparent in the capitalization and words 
and sentences sub-tests. In the punctuation and parts of 
speech tests, items are arranged in an irregular fashion 
with respect to item difficulty. 

The irregularities in the punctuation section may be 
due to difficult items resulting from the lack of explicit 
directions to pupils. These directions may not enable 
pupils to expect to encounter items requiring double 
responses. The irregularities in levels of difficulty in 
the parts of speech test is undoubtably due to the fact 
that pupils are required to recognize parts of speech in 
a single complete sentence. As a relative pronoun precedes 
a verb in the sentence, a difficult item, at times, precedes 
a less difficult item.

CHAPTER VII 


SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS 

1. Findings 

The purpose of this study was to determine the 
effectiveness of the California Language Tests for samples 
of Alberta grades four and seven pupils, by the use of item- 
analysis techniques* An examination of the data presented 
in this study appears to justify the following: 

1. In the capitalization section of both the elementary 
and intermediate tests, an ambiguity arises when no 
response is made to an item. This might be interpreted to 
mean that the testee, for some reason, failed to respond 
to the item or that he decided that no capitalization was 
necessary. The interpretation of responses in this 
section would be facilitated by providing a place where a 
testee might indicate, positively, that no capitalization 
is required. 

2, The effectiveness of the items in the capitalization 
and punctuation sub-tests of the elementary and intermediate 
tests, is reduced when equal credit is given to pupils 
marking only the correct response, and to others marking 
several, of which only one is correct. These tests might 

be improved by penalizing pupils for over-capitalization 
and over-punctuation.

3. One item in the elementary test and four in the 
intermediate test, with either zero or negative discrim¬ 
ination indices, fail to discriminate between levels of 
ability of the sample of pupils used in this study. 

These items do not contribute to the measurement of language 
achievement. 

4. Twenty-three per cent of the items of the elementary 
test and sixteen per cent of the intermediate test items 
have insufficient discriminating power to meet the 
requirements for achievement test items as proposed by 

F. B. Davis. 

3. In the elementary test, the fewest inefficient items 
are found in the punctuation test. The capitalization 
test contains the most. The words and sentences, and parts 
of speech sections of the intermediate test have the fewest 
inefficient items, while the punctuation section has the 
most. 

6. The distributions of item difficulty for both the 
elementary and intermediate tests are sufficiently peaked 
to indicate that a selection of items on the basis of 
difficulty, had been carried out in the construction of 
the tests. 

7. Because of the large proportion of relatively easy 
items, the distributions of difficulty for all tests are 
negatively skewed. This is most pronounced in the words 
and sentences sub-test of the elementary test and in the

capitalization and words and sentences sections of the 
intermediate test. 

The sub-test items of the elementary test are too 
similar in level of difficulty to permit a clearly 
defined arrangement in order of difficulty. However, to 
the degree that there was variation in difficulty of items, 
this pattern has been maintained. In the intermediate 
test, patterns of item difficulty are even less apparent 
in the capitalization, and words and sentences sub-tests. 

9. In the punctuation and parts of speech tests, items 
are arranged in an irregular fashion with respect to level 
of difficulty. In the punctuation test this may be due 
to lack of explicit directions concerning items which 
require two or more responses, with the consequence that 
such items become more difficult than they would be were 
the elements measured separately. Irregular levels of 
difficulty in the parts of speech test may be due to the 
fact that the testers are required to identify parts of 
speech in the order of occurrence in a sentence. Almost 
inevitably order of occurrence does not coincide with 
order of difficulty. 

2. Conclusions 

The effectiveness of the California Language Tests, 
Elementary and Intermediate, appears to be limited by a number 
of factors. These factors may be of little consequence when

considered independently but together they tend to reduce the 
efficiency of measurement. 

1. Defects in the scoring procedure and in the method 

of recording answers in the capitalization and punctuation 
sections, reduce the effectiveness of the items. Equal 
credit is given to pupils, some of whom mark only the 
correct responses while others mark several responses to 
each item. There would appear to be a difference in the 
ability of these pupils but this is not always indicated 
by the final score. 

2. In both tests, the Davis discrimination indices are 
relatively low indicating a lack of test homogeneity. As 
a result, some ambiguity in the interpretation of the 
total score may be expected. 

The fact that items appear to be measuring specific 
elements of language skill which are not highly correlated 
may account for the lack of internal consistency in the 
test as a whole. Because of their restricted content, the 
sub-tests may possess greater test homogeneity and yield 
relatively unambiguous scores. But before one places any 
credence in their results he should be assured of their 
reliability. The test authors of the California Language 
Tests have not provided this information. 

With the California Language Tests, the test user is 
provided with two sets of scores; the total score, which

may have little meaning because of the lack of internal 
consistency of the tests and the sub-scores, which may 
be the product of relatively homogeneous measures, but 
for which no reliability data are reported. 

The current practice of attempting to produce an 
instrument to serve both as a diagnostic and an achievement 
test, reduces the possibility of effective measurement for 
either purpose. 

3. Perhaps the greatest factor limiting the effectiveness 
of the California Language Tests is the unduly large 
proportion of relatively easy items. The distributions of 
item difficulty are not well adjusted to the abilities of 
Alberta grade four and grade seven pupils in large and 
small urban centres. The large proportion of relatively 
easy items in both tests, has the effect of reducing the 
power of the test to differentiate between pupils at the 
upper levels of ability. 

4. Since the tests contain too many relatively easy items 
for the sample of grade four and seven pupils, it might be 
expected that the distributions of item difficulty would 

be still more seriously skewed if the tests were administered 
to grades six and nine pupils. 

5. The California Language Tests are limited in their 
usefulness in that they measure but a few of the basic 
objectives of language instruction. Their content is 
restricted to the use of capital letters and punctuation

marks, and the recognition of complete sentences and 
parts of speech. No attempt is made to measure some of the 
broader outcomes such as the ability to organize and 
present material logically, to sustain an idea, to establish 
continuity of thought, and to discriminate in the selection 
of words. For this reason they must be regarded as tests 
of language usage rather than comprehensive tests of 
language ability. This is a weakness which is common to 
the language portion of most of the current achievement
