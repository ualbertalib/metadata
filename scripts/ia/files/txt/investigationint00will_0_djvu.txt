AN INVESTIGATION INTO ALBERTA GROWN 


ALKALOIDAL PLANTS 


W. D. Goldberg 


I. INTRODUCTION 


George P. Koch (14) in his paper "The 

medicinal 

Cultivation of A Plants" stated - 

"War, with all its horrors, and terrible as 
the results may be, does produce some good. It 
stimulates production, compels efficiency, and 
teaches us to be more self-reliant.” 

This statement may well be taken as a reason 
for the marked increase, as he ably pointed out, in the 
cultivation of various medicinal plants in the United 
States immediately following 1914, as a result of being 
cut off from sources of supply. 

This investigation limited itself to the growth 
and examination of some of the more widely used plants of 
the solanaceous group when grown under Alberta climatic 
and soil conditions. 

Much work has been done, elsewhere, on this 
group of plants, particularly Atropa Belladonna , in regard 
to ideal growing conditions, locale, methods of cultivation, 
and the use of various fertilizers. The use of various

II. LITERATURE REVIEW 


a. Atropa Belladonna 

Belladonna leaf consists of the leaves and tops 
of Atropa Belladonna , Linn, collected when the plant is 
in flower, and dried. 

Belladonna, or Deadly Nightshade, is a herbaceous 
perennial with a fleshy, creeping root, from which arise 
several erect, branching stems, to a height of about three 
feet. The leaves occur usually in pairs and are usually 
of unequal size, oval, pointed, of a dusky green on the 
upper surface and paler beneath. The flowers are large 
bel^-shaped, pendant, and of a purplish color. The fruit 
is a rounded berry. 

The plant is a native of Central and south 
Europe where it is found growing in shady places, along 
walls and amidst rubbish. It grows vigorously, however, 
under cultivation. 

During the past fev<r years, much interest has been 
shown in the cultivation of this plant, particularly in the 
United States. Results show that a high grade of Belladonna

can be grown there (Berneman (1), Karr (10,11), Koch (13), 
Sievers (24). 

Plants cultivated in California were found very 
rich in active constituents (U.S. Dispensatory XXI)*. 

The yield per acre of stems and leaves was somewhat less 
than one ton. The California experiment also showed that 
the alkaloidal content of Belladonna stems was equal to 
that of the leaves (0.51-0.83%) (28). 

Sievers (25) found that no relation existed 
between the appearance of the leaf and its percentage 
content of alkaloid. Specimens, however, he said, which 
are musty or contain too much stem, should be rejected as 
weak in alkaloidal content. 

Koch (13) studied the germination of seeds of 
Atropa Belladonna in parts of the United States and found 
that the seeds germinate slowly. However, it was found by 
workers at the University of Minnesota that the treatment 
of seed with concentrated sulphuric acid for forty-five 
seconds and washing repeatedly with distilled water, would 
produce uniform germination in about fifteen days. Sievers 
(23), however, disputed this result. 

Koch (13) points out that Atropa Belladonna 
germination is greatly enhanced by planting in a hothouse, 
and when the plant has grown to a height of about four and 
a half inches, over a period of about three months, it is 
set out into the experimental field.

Karr (10), however, showed that the cultivated 
plant contained very little more alkaloid than did the 
wild. He stated that nitrogenous fertilizers tended to 
lower alkaloidal content because of larger leaf surface. 

This conclusion was reached by observations and determina¬ 
tions carried out on plants grown in England. Karr (11) 
also found that in whatever latitude Atropa Bell adonna is 
grown, it was conclusive that the composition of the soil, 
the use of fertilizers and seasonal conditions made for 
very small variations. His plants were grown in a chalky 
soil. 

As to moisture, not many workers indicate the 
needs of Atropa Belladonna . Koch (13) found that two-thirds 
as much weight of leaves and stems was harvested where 
moisture to the extent of one-half the physical optimum of 
the soil was applied, as was produced where the conditions 
of moisture were at the optimum. 

Goris and Deluard (7) cultivated Atropa 
Belladonna in places both exposed to the sun and in the 
shade and found that the plants exposed to the sun produced 
three times as many leaves as those in the shade. The 
alkaloidal content, they reported, was also much higher. 

This finding agreed very well with the findings of Karr (10). 

The B.P. directs that the leaves be gathered at 
flowering time and should not contain more than 20 % of 
stems. But with, of course, always the resulting alkaloidal 
content in mind, Borneman (1) states that the plant can be

harvested any time in the fall and some time before the 
first sign of the leaves turning yellow, as at that time 
there is a rapid deterioration of alkaloids. Also regarding 
the amount of stem to be collected, most workers appear to 
agree that the stems may be used as well as the leaves and 
the alkaloidal content still not fall below the B.P. 
requirements. 

All workers are agreed that the leaves, on being 
gathered, should be dried as rapidly as possible. This is 
well shown by Borneman (1) and others. Koch (IS) states 
that the leaves should be rapidly dried at a temperature of 
55°-60° as at this temperature, the dried leaves yielded a 
maximum of alkaloidal content. 

b. Hyoscyamus niger 

Hyoscyamus consists of the dried leaves and 
flowering tops of Hyoscyamus niger (linn.) and contains not 
less than 0.05% of the alkaloids of Hyoscyamus, calculated 
as hyoscyamine. 

There are about fifteen species of the genus 
Hyoscyamus known. They are found in the Canary Islands, 
Europe, Northern Africa and Asia. The plant is found in 
north and east sections of the United States, occupying 
waste plots, old gardens, cemeteries, etc. It is not a 
native of North America, but was introduced from Europe.

The plant occurs in two forms, annual and biennial. 
It has a long, tapering, soft, whitish root resembling 
parsley, for which it has been mistaken, with disastrous 
results. 

In England and on the continent, Europe, it grows 
along the roads, around villages, in rubbish and in waste 
places. Both varieties were formerly cultivated in England, 
but now the biennial is chiefly grown. 

Gieger and Hesse (1883) were the first to 
demonstrate the existence of an alkaloid in Hyoscyamus niger . 
Ladenburg (1880) made the statement that there were two 
alkaloids present, and these were subsequently shown to be 
crystallizable hyoscyamine, c x7 H 23°3 N and the other, 
amorphous hyoscine, 

Hyoscyamine is the dominant alkaloid though some 
hyoscine and atropine do occur. 

Henry (9) finds the following total determination 

of Hyoscyamus niger : 

leaves 0.045%-0.08% 

Roots 0.15 -0.17 

Stems 0.06 -0.10 

Tops 0.07 -0.10 

J. A. Borneman (1), who carried out the cultivation 
of various solanaceous plants in Pennsylvania, stated that 
Hyoscyamus niger was the most difficult of all to grow. The 
specimens obtained were usually beautiful, but the assays 
were almost always disappointing and rarely gave an 
alkaloidal content in excess of 0.06%. His conclusion was

that unless it would he possible to bring the assay up to 
standard it would not pay to cultivate the plant. 

Experiments by Newcomb and Haynes (19) showed 
that Hyoscyamus nlger cultivated in Minnesota yielded very 
high percentages of total alkaloids * the range being from 
0.096$ to 0.1561$. They recommended (as they did for 
Atropa Belladonna ) the treatment of the seed with concen¬ 
trated sulphuric acid before planting, and they found that 
they obtained a fairly uniform germination in from twelve 
to fifteen days. 

Klan (IB) states that with the growth of the 
germinating plant, the quantity of alkaloid in its organs 
decreases. He states that the order of alkaloid content 
in Hyoscyamus niger (both annual and biennial) is 

1. Root 

2. Flowering tops 

3. Fruits 

4. Leaves 

5. Stems 

The plant growth is rapid and has a characteristic 
fetid odor, which disappears on the drying of the leaf. 

The growth is heavy and the leaves are large, though 
varying in size, the lower leaves being considerably larger 
than those above. 

Patu (20) in his growth of the plant found that 
mildew had completely covered the radicle leaves of the 
first year Hyoscyamus, and found in these leaves a lowered 
alkaloidal content.

As, in referring to A. Belladonna , the writer 
finds that workers seem agreed that the stems of Kyoscyamus 
niger can be used as well as the leaves at harvest time, 
and the official requirements still met. This was the 
finding of Koch (15, 16). 

c. Datura Stramonium 

Stramonium consists of the dried leaves and 
flowering tops of Datura Stramonium (Linn.) and Datura 
tatula (Linn.). 

Datura Stramonium (the thornapple) is an annual 
plant of rank and vigorous growth, usually about three feet 
high, but growing in exceptionally rich soil may attain a 
growth of six feet. The root is large, greyish-white, with 
numerous rootlets. The stem is round, erect, shiny and with 
numerous large spreading branches. The leaves are large, 
five or six inches in length, dark green on the upper 
surface with a lighter green on the lower surface. The 
flowers are large, solitary, with a funnel-like corolla. 

The fruit is a large, fleshy, ovoid, 4-valved capsule, 
thickly covered with very sharp spines and containing 
numerous flattened seeds, all attached to a central placenta. 
It opens at the summit at ripening, and on drying the seeds 
are easily removed. 

It is doubtful to what country Datura Stramonium 
first belonged. European botanists have referred it to 
North America, while American botanists return it to Europe.

Some consider it as having originated in South America or 
Asia, and it is probable that its original habitat is to 
be found somewhere in the east. 

It is reported to grow wild and abundantly in 
Southern Russia, from the borders of the Black Sea east to 
Siberia. In the United States, where it has probably come 
by seed on board ship in dirt ballast, it is found in 
waste spots, road sides and rank soil. Where the plant 
grows abundantly, it may be recognized by its rank odor. 

But notwithstanding its wide growth in the wild state, it 
is being cultivated in order to obtain a drug of uniform 
quality. 

The American supply of the drug comes mainly from 
Europe, chiefly Holland, England and Germany. 

Koch (14) in his paper "The Cultivation of 
Medicinal Plants” states that Stramonium is a weed in nearly 
all parts of the United States, and as a weed it attains 
considerable growth but is always better under cultivation. 
Ordinarily, after seeding, he says, the plant requires no 
special care, other than occasional cultivation. 

But Miller and Meader (18) found that cultivation, 
particularly on D. Stramonium and D. tatula , with and with¬ 
out fertilizer, had increased the alkaloidal output. This 
came as a contradiction to the findings of Karr on Belladonna 
(10) when he found that the greatest growth was in unusually 
dry and sunny seasons (0.68% alkaloids). Also in a patch 
with much sun and no fertilizer, he obtained 1.035% 
alkaloids.

All parts of the plant are active. The parts, 
according to most workers, may be gathered at any time from 
the appearance of the flowers to the autumn frost. A.R.L. 
Dohme (3) examined Stramonium to determine the value in 
alkaloids of the various parts of the plant. He found that, 
in general, the fresh parts yielded more than the dried, 
and that the order of alkaloidal content in the organs 
was as follows: stems, seeds, leaves, root. 

Gieger and Hesse (1833) first isolated an 
alkaloid which they called daturine, and which later was 
found to be identical with hyoscyamine. There is also 
present in the drug traces of scopolamine. George P. Koch 
(13), during his various researches on the solanaceous 
plants in regard to their relative alkaloidal content, 
compared the relative values of the stem and leaves of 
Datura Stramonium . He states that the whole plant, with or 
without the root, can be used without fear that the total 
alkaloidal value will fall below B.P. or U.S.P.X. standards. 

d. Datura Metel 

The Datura leaves are the leaves of Datura Metel 
and Datura fastuosa which are annual plants occurring chiefly 
in India and attain a height of three to four feet. While 
the plant Datura Metel Is indigenous to India, it has been 
carried to almost all tropical regions. The leaves are

slightly toothed or wavy-margined, and the flowers are 
trumpet-shaped and white. Except for the leaves, Datura 
Me tel very closely resembles Datura fastuosa . 

In India, the leaves are used as an equivalent 
to Belladonna and Stramonium. 

Though not a great deal of work has been done on 
Datura Metel , it contains chiefly hyoscine (scopolamine) 
(9) with occasionally small amounts of hyoscyamine and 
atropine. 

The plant, though belonging to the Solanaceous 
group of plant drugs, is not official, but forms the chief 
source of hyoscine. 

The alkaloid is most commonly extracted from the 
leaves, which contain 0.25-0.55% of alkaloids, the other 
parts of the plant yielding varying amounts of alkaloids 
as follows: 

Fruits 0.12% 

Roots 0.1 - 0.22% 

Seeds 0.23- 0.50% (28) 

III. OBJECT OF INVESTIGATION 


This investigation was prompted by the desire to 
know if the plants, normally grown in central and southern 
Europe and in southern England, could be successfully grown 
in our normal Alberta climate, with its comparatively short 
growing season, and to see if these plants would produce 
alkaloidal contents, at least equal to the B.P. requirements.

No added cultivation, other than periodic watering during 
the dry season and occasional weeding, would be used. 

It was then with a sense of questioning if Alberta 
could produce at least some of its own medicinal plants 
successfully that this investigation was undertaken. 

The work of Newcomb and Haynes (19) mentioned 
previously, in connection with solanaceous plants in 
Minnesota, acted as an incentive for the investigation, 
since the growing conditions of Minnesota and Alberta are 
very similar. 


IV. METHODS (A review) 


Much work has been done on the extraction and 
assay of the solanaceous plants, particularly Atrope 
Belladonna . 

Many methods have been evolved, each method 
giving the particular worker fairly consistent results, 
but the results of the various workers remaining out of 
agreement. This may be due to personal error or to 
manipulation, as various workers using the same method 
obtain varying results. Similarly Sievers (24) showed a 
variation of the alkaloidal content of the leaves of the 
same plant, ranging from 0.110$ to 0.766$. 

The chief point of contention in the actual 
method of assay of particularly the solanaceous plants 
has been the relative instability of the alkaloids contained

therein. Recent workers, among them Watkins and Palkin 
(26), Dekay (27) and Jordan (2), Evans and Goodrich (5), 
Evans and Davy (4) are satisfied that the alkaloids are 
stable enough to permit of extraction by a hot ether, or 
other solvent, apparatus. Schow and Bjerregaard (21), 
whi^e working with the sterilization of various substances, 
found that solutions of atropine could be heated at 120° 
for twenty minutes without danger of decomposition. Dekay 
and Jordan (2) formed the conclusion, based on their 
experiments with the alkaloids, that the alkaloids are 
much more stable than they are usually assumed to be. 

When chloroform solutions of them are evaporated, they can 
be heated at water-bath temperature for one or two hours, 
without decomposition. Watkins and Palkin (26) found that 
the alkaloids heated in acid or alkali on a water-bath 
showed no apparent loss. Consequently, many new methods 
have been evolved for the extraction of solanaceous plants. 

Before going on to the newer methods, established 
methods were first examined for their value, keeping always 
in mind the fact that the B.P. still considers these 
alkaloids too unstable in solution to be extracted by any 
means other than the maceration and cold extraction. 

a. B.P. 1914 Method 


This method directed the maceration of the powder 
in #60 powder, directly in the percolator, fitted with a

tap and plugged with cotton. Maceration was allowed for 
one hour, then percolation carried on slowly, into a 
separator containing N/l sulphuric acid. The final 
chi oroformic residue of alkaloids was evaporated and 
titrated with 10 mils of 0.05 N sulphuric acid and 0.05 N 
sodium hydroxide, using tincture of cochineal as indicator. 

b. B.P. 1932 Methods 


The new methods for A. Belladonna and D. 
Stramonium are identical. 

The powder is directed to be of a #60 fineness 
and is macerated in a flask for one hour, in contact with 
ammonia / alcohol x and ether. It is transferred to a 
percolator plugged with cotton and percolated for not more 
than three hours or until total extraction of alkaloids is 
effected. To the percolate is added 0,5 N hydrochloric 
acid and the alkaloids shaken out in the usual manner. The 
final chloroform solution of alkaloids is evaporated to 
dryness and dried for half an hour at 100°. The residue 
is titrated using 0.02 N sulphuric acid and 0.02 N sodium 
hydroxide and methyl-red as indicator. 

For Kyoscyamus, which contains a smaller amount 
of alkaloids, much the same procedure is used, but since 
forty grammes of drug are used, the standard percolator is 
used. Maceration and percolation are similar to those used 
for Belladonna, but percolation should not require more

than two hours. Since, however, the alkaloids of Hyoscyamus 
are more sensitive to heat than are the others, the mixed 
acid solutions of alkaloids are made alkaline and evaporated 
in vacuo at a temperature not exceeding 40°. It is then 
extracted with chloroform as usual , the chloroform 
evaporated off and the residue dried at 80° for two hours. 
The residue is titrated using 0.02 N sulphuric acid and 
0.02 N sodium hydroxide, and methyl-red as indicator. 

c. The Method of Rosenthaler 


For the total extraction of the drug plants, the 
procedure as outlined by Rosenthaler in his "The Chemical 
Investigation of Plants" (1930)* appeared to be the most 
thorough, and is a method by which all constituents occurring 
in the plant may be isolated and recognized. 

d. The Method of Watkins and Palkin (27) 


This method was devised particularly for the evalu¬ 
ation of Hyoscyamus. The alkaloids! yield by this method 
has shown results in some cases as much as three times as 
great as that obtained by the U.S.P. IX and X methods. 

The essential steps in this mechanical extraction are 
i. Treatment of the mass of crude drug with an 
alkaline medium to liberate the alkaloid. Macerate over night.

ii. Continuous extraction by means of the 
device described, using ether as a solvent. 

iii. Purification process of the alkaloidal 
residue, during which chlorophyll, tars and other extract¬ 
ives are removed. 

iv. Extraction of the alkaloids from aqueous 
solution by means of another continuous device. 

v. Titration of the alkaloids. 

The concentration of ammonia in the original 
maceration has been the subject of considerable enquiry, 
and it may be in this connection that the varying results 
occur with different workers. 

It is conceivable that too low a concentration 
of ammonia will not completely free the alkaloids from the 
crude drug, while too great a concentration is not advisable 
because of the instability of the alkaloid hyoscyamine. 

With this in mind, Watkins and Pal kin extracted 
several samples with all conditions being uniform, but 
varied the concentration of ammonia. 

They found that 7 cc. of 16 N ammonia proved the 
most efficient, as may be seen from the following table 
taken from their paper.

These workers used 0*02 N acid and 0,02 N alkali 
and used methyl red as an indicator. 


e. The Method of DeKay and Jordan (2) 


These workers, like Watkins and Palkin, used a 
mechanical extraction apparatus in much the same manner as 
did Watkins and Palkin, except that they used the regulation 
Soxhlet apparatus instead of one specially devised. The 
assay was essentially the same, except that these workers 
extracted completely the volatile bases and determined

They concluded, from their experiments, that the 
alkaloids of Hyoscyamus (the subject of their paper) are more 
stable than usually thought. They determined also, that 
most procedures extract certain volatile bases which they 
determined as triraethyl amine and a primary amine, and the 
indication of the presence of dimethyl-amine, along with 
the alkaloids. 

DeKay and Jordan used 0.02 N acid and 0.02 N 
alkali in their titration of the alkaloid, and methyl red 
as indicator. 

f. Abstract of Proposed Changes to U.S.P.X. 

(29) and U.S.P.X. Method 


This paper dealt with two new proposed methods 
for assaying crude drugs, i.e., 

1. Aliquot part method (by maceration only), 

2. Total extraction method (by maceration and 
percolation). 

The second procedure more closely resembles the 
B.P. method so it only will be considered. 

The drug is placed in a small cylindrical 
percolator (see Plate I, Fig. 1) previously prepared by 
packing the outlet with cotton. Add solvent to completely 
saturate the drug, mix, cover the percolator, allow to stand 
five minutes and add the ammonia solution and mix again.

After macerating for one hour, percolate slowly until 
completely extracted. This method uses 0.10 N sulphuric 
acid and 0.02 N sodium hydroxide, and cochineal or methyl 
red, as indicator. 

With the foregoing review, it appears then that 
there are two procedures open to the worker, viz., 

1. Extraction by cold method (B.P. and U.S.P.X.), 

2. Extraction by continuous or hot method. 

It might be well then to examine step by step the basic 
principles of a plant assay, with a view to determining 
the value or objections to the various methods outlined. 

1. The crude drug . 

The drug must be well divided, at least to a #60 
powder and must represent the whole drug. It is in¬ 
sufficient to grind the powder, sift it through a #60 
sieve and discard midrib or stem portions which refuse to 
go through the sieve. They must be further ground and then 
incorporated with the previous portion. It is further 
important that the fine powder be thoroughly mixed. 

It is evident that upon the completeness and 
fineness of the sample rests the accuracy of the resulting 
determinations. 

In this respect, all of the foregoing methods 

agree. 

2. The extraction . 

Upon the differences of opinion as to the relative 
stability of the solanaceous alkaloids rests the fact that

there are so many varied procedures advanced for the assay 
of a plant drug. 

All procedures agree upon the maceration, the 
hot methods, however, directing maceration over night, 
while the cold methods macerate for not more than two 
hours. With the proper concentration of ammonia, it is 
conceivable that two hours should be sufficient to free all 
alkaloids. 

The tendency to the production of an emulsion 
when a solution containing vegetable extractives is shaken 
with an immiscible solvent, forms a great and common 
difficulty. This difficulty, however, is now almost 
wholly surmounted in most methods by the addition of 
alcohol in the first shaking out with acid, instead of 
acid alone. Emulsions in the hot method are not very 
common. All procedures extract considerable coloring and 
other matter in the original extractive, and this often 
interferes in the final determination by coming through 
in traces. The procedure by DeKay and Jordan (2) and 
Watkins and Palkin (27) precipitates this coloring matter 
by adding acid. The solution is then filtered and the 
chlorophyll left behind. 

The alkaloidal residue is not treated similarly in 
the various procedures. All methods agree that there is 
extracted, along with the alkaloids, an appreciable amount 
of volatile principles and direct the heating of the final

residue at varying temperatures, governed by the relative 
stability of the alkaloid. 

In this respect, independent workers agree that 

the solanaceous alkaloids are more stable than they are 

generally reported to be (vide p. 13). This thought is 

coming into the methods of the B.P. and U.S.P.X. since the 

residues are heated, in the case of Belladonna and 

o 

Stramonium, at 100 for one-half an hour. 

The method outlined by DeKay and Jordan isolates, 
weighs and calculates the actual percentage present of 
volatile principle, while other methods simply heat the 
residue to drive off these volatile principles and then 
titrate. 

The indicators in all cases suggested are cochineal 
or methyl red and the use of one or the other is left to 
the discretion of the worker. Self (22) to a certain extent 
defends cochineal, though methyl red is preferred. To 
obtain high accuracy with either indicator, Self suggests 
that the volume of titration liquid be kept as low as possible, 
especially in assays where the weight of alkaloid obtained 
is very small. This expedient, he says, produces a much 
sharper end-point. 

Evers (6) suggested that Brom-phenol-blue would 
prove the best indicator for titrating the solanaceous 
alkaloids, and that methyl red ranked next. The range of pH 
of Brom-phenol-blue is 2.8-4.6; the range of pH of methyl 
red is 4.2-6.2. Mellon and Tigelaar (17), however, found

that, though methyl red did not have quite the best pH range 
for titration purposes, yet the error involved in the 
titration of atropine by methyl red is so small it may be 
disregarded. 

On looking back over the above review of the 
methods, one is struck with the apparent similarity in 
procedures in all steps, save that of extraction. Here the 
opinion and findings of the individual worker enter to make 
up his technique and thus we find, as mentioned above, one 
system extracting by the cold percolation process, and the 
other extracting by the hot mechanical method. Modern 
workers lean toward the latter procedure, insisting that 
the alkaloids of Solanaceae are not unstable. 

Of the various methods described, the writer 
decided to choose two to be used in the assays, in a compara¬ 
tive manner. The methods, also, were to consist of both the 
cold percolation method and the hot, continuous method. 

With a view of choosing the two most promising methods, the 
above were considered in the order in which they appear. 

(a) The B.P. 1914 method was used only on 
Stramonium. It was discarded in favor of the B.P. 19 32 
method for its advantages listed under (b). 

(b) The B.P. 1932 Method . This method is out¬ 
lined on page 14 and was used in a comparative sense for 
our plants and also as a check on various other methods. 

The B.P. 19 32 method has several distinct 
advantages and changes which tend toward greater accuracy 
over the B.P. 1914 method. An examination of the two methods

shows the following changes, with their advantages or 
disadvantages• 

i. Maceration - The B.P. 1914 directs "Into a 

small stoppered glass percolator - introduce 10 grammes 

of while the B.P. 1922 directs "Introduce 10 grammes 

of powder into a flask". Both are then macerated for one 
hour, but the B.P. 1932 powder must, of course, be trans¬ 
ferred to the percolator. 

Maceration, by the two methods, it would seem 
would be more complete in the latter, since it is much more 
thorough to shake a flask than to shake a percolator, even 
if it could be tightly corked. A second advantage of the 
latter method is that no channelling can take place with 
resulting incomplete percolation. 

ii. Emulsification - Emulsificiation in the 
assay has been fairly well overcome in the B.P. 1932 method 
by the addition of alcohol to the solvent. This, as pointed 
out by Self (22), prevents emulsification, which occurred 
commonly in the 1914 method. 

iii. First acid extraction - At this point it 
would appear that the extraction of alkaloids is more 
complete since the ether-chloroform extract is run into the 
acid. In the 1932 method, the acid is added to the extract 
and shaken. 

iv. Washing of acid solution - The B.P. 1932 


directs that the acid solution containing the alkaloids be

washed with chloroform, the chloroform run through acid 
and then discarded, while this procedure is not carried 
out in the B.P. 1914 method. This is a distinct advantage 
since any coloring matter carried down from the original 
volatile solvent extract is removed. 

v. Washing of chloroform extract - The B.P. 

1914 collects the chloroformic extract and directly dries 
it, dissolves it in ether, dries and titrates it, while 
the B.P. 1932 directs that the chloroform extract be 
washed with water before being dried, alcohol added, and 
titrated . This point is commented upon, as mentioned, 
in the Pharmacy Journal (30), page 30. 

In all determinations carried out in this 
investigation, the final alkaloidal solution was washed 
with water to eliminate any source of error in that direction. 

vi. Titration - The B.P. 1914 directs the use of 
0.05 N acid and 0.05 N alkali, while the B.P. 1932 directs 
the use of 0.02 N acid and 0.02 N alkali. This is an 
important step toward greater accuracy, and in some cases a 
sharper end point. 

vii. Indicator - The indicator cochineal, official 
in 1914, is now replaced by methyl red, a much more accurate 
and efficient indicator, as shown in the discussion by Self 
(22), Evers (6), Mellon and Tigelaar (17) and others on 

page 22. 

In all determinations by the B.P. 1932 process, on 
Belladonna and Stramonium, the percolator used was very 
similar to that described in the U.S.P.X. method (Plate I,

fig. 1). This percolator proved more convenient for small 
quantities of drug. 

In the extraction of Hyoscyamus by the B.P. 1932 
process, the method is essentially that of Belladonna, with 
modifications firstly for the large quantity of drug 
necessary (since there is only a small amount of alkaloid 
present) and secondly, the reported greater instability of 
the alkaloids. 

This is taken care of, in the case of the large 
amount of drug, by using a larger percolator as shown in 
Plate I, fig. 2, and which is of the standard type. Since 
the quantity of drug is large, it is apparent that at the 
acid extraction of the alkaloids, the volume will be large. 
Before being extracted with chloroform, the mixed acid 
solutions are made alkaline and evaporated in vacuo to 
about 50 cc. at a temperature not exceeding 40°. 

The alkaloids are shaken out with chloroform, 
washed with water, the chloroform removed and the 
alkaloids dried at 80° for two hours. This removes any 
volatile bases present and so makes the final titration 
more accurate. The alkaloids are titrated with 0.02 N 
sulphuric acid and 0.02 N sodium hydroxide, using methyl 
red as indicator. 

In using the above method for Hyoscyamus, the 
greatest objection to it is the length of time required 
for completion. It is always advisable, where possible, 
to complete an assay on the same day as started, since

the alkaloids are of such a nature that standing over 
night may completely change the final result. But with 
the B.P. 1932 assay of Hyoscyamus, a complete assay is 
impossible in one day. 

The B.P. 1932 processes were used as outlined 
in the text with the two following changes: 

1. The liquid was percolated as directed, but 
instead of adding the 0.5 N hydrochloric acid to the 
percolate, the acid was placed in the separator prior to 
percolation with the immiscible solvent. This was done 
for two reasons: 

(a) To avoid any possible leakage since the 
acid layer would remain at the bottom, and 

(b) To insure complete conversion of the 
alkaloids to hydrochlorides. 

2. All alkaloidal residues, on the addition of 
the specified 0.02 N acid were warmed on a water bath to 
insure complete solution. The flask was then cooled at 
room temperature and the titration carried out. 

The results obtained by the B.P. 1932 methods 
proved quite consistent, and,as it is at present outlined, 
the method may well be said to be one of the most efficient 
of alkaloidal assays. Self (22), in his review of 
alkaloidal assays of the B.P. 1932, stated that out of a 
total of 46 alkaloidal assays in the B.P. 1932, 29 are 
quite new and only three have remained practically as 
they were. The changes, he says, are almost wholly of

British origin, and it may be claimed that in the assay 
section of the work the B.P. is stilj well in front. The 
aims, of course, have been to make the assays simpler and 
more acourate, but accuracy always remained the prime 
object. 

(c) The method outlined by Rosenthaler (see 
"The Chemical Investigation of Plants" (1930)* was not used 
in this investigation as it is a method for total extraction. 

(d) The Method of Watkins and Palkin (27). This 
method is essentially similar to that used by DeKay and 
Jordan, which will be described later. The methods, 
however, are different, in that Watkins and Palkin used a 
specially devised apparatus while DeKay and Jordan used a 
Soxhlet apparatus. Since the methods are alike, and 

results may therefore be expected, and since the 
DeKay and Jordan process provides certain advantages, the 
Watkins and Palkin method was omitted in its favor. 

(e) The Method of DeKay and Jordan (2). This 
method was outlined by DeKay and Jordan after exhaustive 
experiments, both on pure alkaloids and on the crude drug. 

The extraction consists of mechanical extraction 
by a Soxhlet apparatus, the drug having been macerated 
over night. 

The procedure follows: 

Samples I and II (20 grammes each) in 60 powder 
were placed in Soxhlet thimbles, dropped into place in the 
extractors and moistened with a mixture of 7 cc. strong 
solution of ammonia, 8 cc. of alcohol and 16 cc. of ether.

It was well mixed with a stirring rod and macerated over 
night. The following day, it was extracted with ether over 
a water bath. The extraction required, as a rule, three 
to four hours. The dark green extract, so obtained, was 
evaporated over a water-bath, to about 12 cc. and then 8 
cc. of 0.1 N sulphuric acid and 8 cc. water added. The 
evaporation was continued until all the ether was removed. 
At this point, the coloring principle was precipitated. 

The liquid (acid solution of alkaloids) was filtered into 
a separator and the precipitated chlorophyll residue re¬ 
dissolved in chloroform, 0.1 N sulphuric acid again added^ 
and again the chlorophyll was precipitated. The mixture 
was again evaporated free of chloroform and the liquid 
remaining again filtered into the separator through the 
same -pafrer. The combined filtrate was made basic with 
dilute ammonia (using litmus) and the alkaloids extracted 
by shaking with successive portions of chloroform, until 
completely extracted, as shown by a test with Mayer ? s 
reagent. 

The chloroform solution was evaporated to a low 
volume and the residue dried at water bath temperature for 
15 minutes. A brownish aromatic residue remained. This 
residue was redissolved in chloroform, again evaporated and 
again dried for 15 minutes. This process was repeated for 
the third time. 

At this point, the residue may be dissolved in 
about 10 cc. of chloroform and then 15 cc. 0.02 N sulphuric

acid added, the chloroform evaporated off and the titration 
carried out, using methyl red as indicator, or the residue 
may he treated for the removal of any volatile bases 
present. The latter was the process used in this investiga¬ 
tion in most cases. 

This process consisted of passing air through a 
sulphuric acid wash bottle and a CaClg-NagCOg tower and 
then through a CaClg U-tube, heated at 40°. This frees 
the air of moisture and warms it. This warm dry air was 
then slowly passed over the alkaloidal residue and 
finally into the flask containing 0.1 N hydrochloric acid 
(see Plate II, figs. 1 and £). 

The volatile bases thus carried over by the air 
into the 0.1 N hydrochloric acid are there held. After 
one hour, the hydrochloric acid solution is heated to 
dryness and the residue weighed. 

The a^katoidal residue is then titrated as 
described above. 

This method appeared to be a thorough procedure 
for the extraction of alkaloids. 

It provided a method for the hot extraction of 
alkaloids and would, indirectly, indicate if the alkaloids 
of the Solanaceae could be extracted by such a method 
without loss. 

The weighing of the drug into the thimble, the 
maceration and extraction while in this receptacle without 
the disadvantage of transferring from a flask to a 
percolator, is obviously an advantage both from the views 


of expediency and accuracy.

On obtaining the ether extract, the precipitation 
of chlorophyll and other foreign extractives with acid 
seemed an important feature, as the alkaloidal acid solution 
should be in a comparatively pure state. 

so the method of handling the alkaloidal 
residue immediately prior to titration appeared to have the 
advantage of bringing the alkaloids completely into solution 
in the acid. This is pointed out by Self (22) who says 
that if an alkaloid is difficult to dissolve in small 
amounts of acid, the addition and subsequent evaporation 
of a small volume of a solvent, such as chloroform, will 
usually be found to facilitate solution. 

Lastly, the means described of handling the 
alkaloidal residue for the isolation and weighing of the 
volatile bases seemed advisable in view of recent work, 
particularly that of DeKay and Jordan, regarding these bases. 

The whole procedure may be summarized as shown 
on PI ate III. 

After a few determinations with this process, it 
was found advisable to make the following modifications: 

(a) After the complete removal of the chloroform 
by evaporation, the flask containing the alkaloidal acid 
solution and the chlorophyll residue was cookd to room tempcmkre 
whereby the precipitate was coagulated. Filtration was 
then carried out by decantation. It was found that if the 
solution was completely cooled after each evaporation, 
very little chlorophyll was carried over.

In all cases, after the original ether solution 
was precipitated by the addition of water and 0.10 N 
sulphuric acid, the precipitate of chlorophyll and other 
non-alkaloidal extractive was quite bulky and on the first 
filtration a considerable quantity of the tarry precipitate 
was carried over on to the filter paper. This condition 
was undesirable for three reasons, namely, 

i. The probable loss of a portion of the 
alkaloids in the precipitate, by being held back by the 
gelatinous nature of the precipitate, and thus not being 
thoroughly extracted. 

ii. Much of the precipitate seeped through the 

meshes of the filter paper and appeared in the acid solution 

below, resulting, obviously, in a colored alkaloidal 
residue, at the end. 

iii. The precipitate in all cases closed the 

meshes of the filter paper and made filtering almost im¬ 

possible, without repeated changes of papers. 

(b) At the point of chloroformic extraction of 
the ammoniacal solution of alkaloids, all chloroformic 
extraction portions were passed through another separator 
containing water. This held back any water-soluble foreign 
substances undesirable in the alkaloidal residue, such as 
traces of ammonium sulphate formed in neutralization. This 
procedure agreed with a paper appearing in 1915 (30) in 
which the writer suggested that a possible source of error

in all alkaloidal assays is the carrying down of ammonium 
salts, and recommended the washing of all final volatile 
solvent solutions. 

With these two main modifications, the process 
was used throughout, as directed by DeKay and Jordan. 

The process was used on all plants under 
investigation in order to obtain a comparative alkaloidal 
yield, after all volatile substances had been removed, and 
to compare these yields with the B.P. process. 

(f) U.S.P.X. Method and Outline (29). This 
method is essentially similar to the B.P. 1932 method with 
the exception of the original technique, in that the drug 
is placed directly into the percolator and there macerated 
for one hour and then percolated. Since it was considered 
that the U.S.P.X. and B.P. 1932 processes were so similar 
that results should be comparable, the U.S.P.X. process was 
omitted in favor of the B.P. 1932. 

V. EXPERIMENTAL, 


a. Test Garden 


The test growing ground was a plot on the University 
of Alberta campus, adjoining the gardens. It was normal 
black soil, completely open to the sun, but well protected 
from wind by an efficient protective growth of trees and 
shrubs (see Plate IV, figs. 1 and 2). Pig. 1 shows the 
north-west corner, and fig. 2, the east side, of the test 
garden.

b. The Seed 


The seeds used in this investigation were 
obtained from various sources, in order to obtain offspring 
of plants grown under different climatic conditions. The 
seeds were obtained from the following sources: 

1. The University of Minnesota, College of 

Pharmacy. 

3. Mr. I. Tice, Westlock, Alberta. 

3. Seed obtained from the previous summer's 
growth in this test garden. 

In addition were used roots from the previous 
year's growth. 


c. The Growth 


All plants were grown in the same test garden and 
received the same amount of attention. The soil received 
no fertilizer. The plants during their growth received no 
special attention other than occasional watering and 
weeding. 

The moisture needs of the plants provided quite 
a problem, as rainfall in central Alberta is not regular, 
and during some periods in the l ifetime of Atropa Be"! ladonna , 
rainfall was completely absent. The plants, as mentioned,

were watered when necessary, and as far as was possible 
without tests, were kept at optimum growing conditions. 

1. Atropa Bel i adonna . 

i. First year growth . The seed, obtained 
from University of Minnesota stock, was treated as suggested 
with concentrated sulphuric acid, for 45 seconds, repeatedly 
washed in a sieve with distilled water, and sown in the 
greenhouse on April 28th. 

While the seedlings were still very small, they 
were transferred to the test garden, late in June. The 
plants were late in developing, but they withstood the 
severe frost (temperature 25°F.) which occurred on August 
25th. 

The plant produced several erect stems which did 
not produce a particularly dense foliage. At maximum 
growth, the plant was about three feet tall and produced 
characteristic flowers. 

The leaves were collected on August 26th while 
at apparent maximum growth and when the plant was in flower. 
They were cut by hand, and avoiding as much as possible too 
much stem (the B.P. directs a maximum of 20$ stem) . Only 
clean, entire leaves were collected. 

The freshly cut leaves were placed in large paper 
bags and without being pressed or unduly handled, transferred 
to the drying room in the basement, quickly spread in a 
thin, where possible single, layer on paper, on the floor. 

The room was maintained at an almost constant temperature 


of 50° .

Upon being thoroughly dried, the leaves were 
again gathered and ground in a Wiley power mill to a 
uniform #60 powder, weighed, the whole well mixed, bottled 
in amber, air-tight bottles and stored. 

ii. Second year growth . All of the 1933 plants 
allowed to remain in the field over the winter were winter¬ 
killed. Two plants which had been potted and placed in the 
greenhouse the previous fall were set out in the field and 
grew to a height of about two and a half feet. In spite 
of the frost on August 25th and also numerous September 
frosts, these plants produced a few small seed-pods, two 
of which ripened. The leaves were all so completely frozen 
that they could not be collected. 

2. Hyoscyamus niger . 

i. First year growth . The seed for the 1934 
grov/th of this plant was obtained from Mr. L. Tice of 
Westlock, Alberta, from plants grown by him in 1933. 

The seeds were treated with concentrated sulphuric 
acid for one minute and 45 seconds before sowing. 

Sowing was carried out on May 8th. The seedlings 
appeared about May 24th. The growth of the plant was fairly 
rapid. 

The plant had a characteristic fetid odor and a 
heavy growth of the characteristically indented leaves was 
produced. The plant as a whole was low in stature with no 
upright stem.

The size of the leaves varied considerably. They 
were of a pale green color and while growing, had a soft 
and unpleasantly clammy surface. This stickiness was due 
to the soft hairs found near the veins, particularly on 
the under surface, which possess glandular heads secreting 
a resinous substance. 

Two collections of leaves of the first year 
plants were made, the first on August 1st and the second 
on August 10th. 

They were transferred to large paper bags and 
thence to the drying room where they were spread evenly 
and dried. They were then gathered, ground to a #60 powder, 
well mixed, bottled in well-closed containers and stored. 

ii. Second year growth . The plants of the 
second year were grown from the roots of the first year 
growth, allowed to remain in the test garden over the 
winter, so that the conditions for growth for both first 
and second year plants may be said to be the same. 

The roots of the plants sown in 1933 (which was 
L. Tice stock) left in place over the winter as mentioned 
above appeared to winter well. 

The young shoots appeared above the ground about 
April 24th. The roots, soon after, were thinned out by 
transplanting, this work being carried out between April 
27th and May 3rd. 

The growth, as in the first year, was fairly 
rapid, but in this case the plant was considerably bulkier,

with a greater number of leaves and with a strong upright 
stem. At maximum growth, the characteristic flowers 
appeared in large numbers. 

The plant, at the period of flowering, attained 
a growth of slightly more than three feet as may be seen 
in Plate V, fig. 3. The leaves had the characteristic 
indentations and were of a dull green color (Plate V, 
figs. 1, 2, 3). 

On July 20th, the leaves were gathered, keeping 
in mind the limitations as to stems, directed by the B.P. 
The leaves were cut closely, transferred to large paper 
bags and spread in the drying room. When thoroughly dry, 
they were broken and passed through a Wiley mill to produce 
a #60 powder, thoroughly mixed, placed in well-closed 
containers and stored. 

3* Datura stramonium . 

The seed for this plant was obtained from the 
University of Minnesota stock. It was not treated with 
concentrated sulphuric acid, as was Atropa Bel 1aflonna , but 
was sown directly into the test garden on May 18th. 

The growth of the plant was fairly rapid. The 
stems were round, very smooth and at maximum growth, woody. 

The plant appeared to be more hardy than the 
others, and the growth seemed to bear out the statement of 
Koch (14) who stated that the plant required very little 


attention.

Flowering plants

The pT exits, however, were cultivated as regularly 
as possible and watered occasionally. The growth of weeds 
was kept at a minimum. The plant produced quickly an 
abundant growth of light green foliage, with its deeply 
indented leaves and foul-smelling odor. 

It grew to a height of about three feet, when the 
flowers appeared with their funnel shaped corollas. In 
rapid succession, the flowers gave way to the large 4-cel led 
prickly walnut-shaped fruits. 

The leaves were collected on August 16th, trans¬ 
ferred to the drying room, dried, collected and ground to 
a #60 powder. The powder was well mixed, transferred to 
air-tight containers and stored. 

Shortly after the leaves had been gathered, the 
life of the whole plant ended and the fruits began to open. 
The whole plant was then cut down, gathered, dried and the 
seeds threshed from the open capsules and a large yield of 
seed was obtained. 

4. Datura Me tel . 

The seed was obtained from stock of the University 
of Minnesota, and sown on May 18th. 

The growth of the plant was rapid and produced an 
ahundance of leaves of a yellowish green co*»or, which were 
irregular in shape. The odor of the plant, like Datura 
Stramonium , was unpleasant and characteristic. On the 
epidermis of the leaves occurred scattered simple as well

as small glandular hairs. At maximum growth, the plant 
produced white flowers. 

No cultivation, other than occasional weeding 
and watering, was carried out on the plants. 

The leaves were collected on August 1 6th in much 
the same manner as Datura Stramonium and the other 
solanaceous plants. 

Here again, as little stem as possible was 
gathered and only the healthy clean leaves were used. The 
leaves were dried in the drying room at the constant 
temperature. When dry, they were gathered, ground to a #60 
powder, well mixed, bottled in air-tight containers and 
stored. 


d. Results of Determinations 


1. Atropa Belladonna . 

As will be noticed from the tabulated results, 
leaves of various years growth were used in the determination 

Since a considerable amount of 1931 and 1932 leaf 
was on hand, it was used for the first several determinations 
until the technique in alkaloidal assays was perfected. The 
final results were taken from determinations carried out on 
leaf of 1933 and 1934 crops. 

The first determination of 1933 leaf was that of 
moisture content. Then a determination of ash content was 
carried out, and finally alkaloidal assays by the Deliay 
and Jordan method and the B.P. 1932 method.

The stored powder representing Hyoscyamus niger 
(first year) was well mixed by turning it out on clean 
paper and alternately lifting the corners. It was then 
mixed with spatulas and replaced in the containers, from 
which samples were taken for the various determinations.

VI. DISCUSSION 


a. The Plant 


In all cases, the plants under observation grew 
and matured with a growth similar to that described for 
the official B.P. plants found in southern Europe. 

It was found that: 

1. All plants were free of insect life and 

miIdew. 

2. The roots of Atropa Belladonna , at least, 
cannot resist the winter climate, in the field. They 
should be dug up and kept dormant in a warmer storage house 
and replanted in the spring for the second year*s growth. 

3. The roots of Hyoscyamus niger , left in the 
field, wintered well. Seeds planted for the first year on 
May 8th produced, from the wintered roots, shoots on the 
following April 24th. The plants produced by these wintered 
roots were hardy and had a healthy, rapid growth. 

4. Datura Metel is the least suitable of the 
plants under observation, for Alberta. Only one plant 
produced seed pods, though it is an annual. All plants 
grown in the greenhouse, produced seed pods. 

5. Atropa Belladonna must be started in the 
greenhouse, as the roots, as mentioned above, are killed in 


winter.

6. The roots of Hyoscyamus and Stramonium are 


hardy. 


b. The Results 


1. Moisture contents and ash values . 

Ash contents were fairly consistent and all 
remained within the B.P. limits as shown. Various other 
values are given for ash values as follows: 

Atropa Bell adonna - Youngken* "Pharmacognoscy", 
maximum 20%. 

Datura Stramonium - Youngken "Pharmacognoscy", 
maximum 20%. 

In all cases the results obtained will be tabulated 
against the standards required by the B.P. and various other 
results, in a comparative manner.

Due to the slight variations in the moisture 
content of the drugs, and particularly to the urgent need 
in the Department of Pharmacy for an efficient drying oven, 
it is suggested that an oven with a maximum temperature 
range of 100° and capable of accommodating considerable 
fresh drug, be constructed. 

The efficient drying of a drug is a very 

important factor in atkaloidal determinations as it has 

been suggested (Bentley "Text Book of Pharmaceutics"* 

page 260) that the alkaloids exist in the plant in the 

form of alkaloidal tanno-glucosides, which undergo partial- 

decomposition when, on the death of the cell, the 

permeability of the plasma membrane changes and the acid 

cell sap enters and forms alkaloidal salts. This reaction 

is not complete, so that it is necessary to completely 

separate the alkaloids from the primary colloids. The 

decomposition in most cases takes place by means of the 

enzymes present, and these act best at a temperature of 
o

2. Aikaloidai contents . 

A comparison of the results obtained on the 
plants by the two methods with the official requirements 
and results obtained by some other workers shows that by the 
B.P. 1932 method, 

1. Atropa Bel i adonna is the only plant which 
produced alkaloid in excess of B.P. requirements, and very 
little lower than percentages tabulated from various reports 
in the text "Plant Alkaloids" by Henry (9) and "Materia 
Medica" by Greenish. 

2. Hyoscyamus niger (both years) falls con¬ 
siderably below the B.P. requirement. 

3. The second year Hyoscyamus growth is much 
richer in alkaloid than that of the first year. 

4. Datura Stramonium falls very little below the 
B.P. standard, but is richer in alkaloid than the 
commercis 1 samples which Greenish reports as containing an 
average of 0*22% alkaloids. 

5. That Datura Me tel (which did not produce seed) 
falls considerably below other standards as shown in the 
tabie. 

The same plants when assayed by the DeKay and 
Jordan method show that: 

1. Belladonna and Hyoscyamus both show an 
alkaloida 1 content considerably in excess of the B.P. 
requirements. 

2, The second year’s growth of Hyoscyamus is 
considerably richer in alkaloids than that of the first year.

3. Stramonium falls just below the B.P. re¬

4. Datura Me tel , considerably below commercial 

samples. 

Analysing then, the various tables, the following

2. Stramonium and Datura Metel are below the 

usual , as shown by both methods. 

3. Hyoscyamus is below the requirements by the 
B.P. process and above by the DeKay and Jordan process. 

4. Ash value in all plants is within B.P. 

1 imits. 

3. Volatile bases . 


In order to determine what effect, if any, the 


separation of volatile bases had on the remaining 
alkaloidal residue, several determinations were carried out 
with the following technique: 


Two check samples A and B were weighed out as 


usual and the regular DeKay and Jordan extractions cerried 
out to the point of the last chloroformic alkaloidal 
solution. At this point, instead of each solution being 
evaporated down with chloroform and acid, three times, the 
solution was transferred to a graduated 50 cc. cylinder and 
made up to 50 cc. with chloroform. Each sample was then 
accurately divided in half, each portion being transferred 
to a separate flask. Thus the samples became 


A^ (25 cc} 

Ag (25 cc} 



B^ (25 cc.) 

Bg (25 cc} 



each flask representing one-half of the original sample. 
The A^ and B^ samples were each freed of volatile bases,

Alkaloids Volatile bases Alkaloids 

The DeKay and Jordan process appears to remove, 

by use of the warm air apparatus, all the volatile bases 

present. This can be seen by consulting Table VII, page 

47, where on February 7/35, two determinations were carried 

out and directly titrated without extracting the volatile 

bases. The results obtained were: 

0.07899% 

0.08012% 

Average 0.07956% 

This result compares favorably with the other 
results in which the residues were originally treated with 
warm air, and gave an 

Average 0.06449% 

In the determinations in which the residues A and 
B were equally divided into A-[, Ag and B^, B^ as outlined 
on page 56, it was found that the portions titrated without 
volatile bases removed were consistently higher as evidence

Here the average alkaloid when bases are removed is 0.06373% 
and the average alkaloid when bases are not removed is 0.06543%. 


Since this investigation was interested 


essentially in total alkaloid determinations, the 
volatile bases and other residues brought down with the 
alkaloids were not identified. But in view of the various 
reports on substances brought down, it would prove an 
interesting investigation to enquire into the exact 
nature of all compounds extracted during a normal assay 
by the B.P. or mechanical methods, of a solanaceous 
plant. It may disclose many compounds brought down, 
which at present may be the cause of such various and 
differing results obtained, as pointed out by Sievers (24). 


As mentioned, DeKay and Jordan (2) outlined 


their process with the object of isolating and weighing 
the volatile residue, which they definitely determined as 
di- and tri-methyl amines and pyridine. Goris and 
Larsonneau (8) isolated from Atropa Belladonna many 
volatile bases, an aliphatic amine, pyridine, N-methyl 
pyrolline, N-methyl pyrollidine, etc., all present in 
small quantities. It is possible, moreover, that many 

more compounds exist in the alkaloidal residue, besides

the above mentioned. 


o. The Methods 


Finally, the methods used may now be critically 
examined, with a view of determining their values or 
disadvantages. 

1. The B.P. 1952 method . 

There is no doubt that the B.P. 1932 assay 
methods for the solanaceous plants are tremendous improve¬ 
ments over the B.P. 1914 methods. The advantages of the 
former over the latter have been fully dealt with on 
pp. 23-28, the only factor in the procedure which may lead 
to error is the technique of titration. 

All alkaloidal residues should be warmed slightly 
on a water-bath, after having had the addition of 0.02 N 
sulphuric acid. 

All alkaloidal assays by the B.P. process carry 
down small amounts of colored residues, and if this be 
warmed while in contact with the acid, a greater degree of 
solution of alkaloids is affected. It should be then 
cooled to room temperature and titrated. 

2. The DeKay and Jordan method (2). 

This method in all cases save Atropa Belladonna 
1933 crop (see Table XV, p. 55) gives a much higher 
alkaloidal content than does the B.P. process. This may be 
due to a number of factors.

i. Maceration. The extraction of the alkaloids 
from their natural state may, in this process, be more 
complete, since maceration is carried on over night. Also 
there is no chance of loss of drug, since there is no 
transfer from flask to percolator as in the B.P. method. 

ii. Extraction. The extraction of freed 
alkaloids should, by this process as well as in the B.P. 
process, be complete, since the extractive is tested for 
absence of alkaloids in both cases. 

iii. Titration. This process appears to have 
the better technique as applied to the titration of 
afkaloidal residues. There should be complete solution 

of alkaloid, and therefore complete titration of alkaloids 
present. 

Though, as reported, various workers have had 
difficulty in obtaining consistent results by various 
methods, the above two methods gave, in this investigation, 
fairly consistent results.

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


Observations and determinations were carried out 
on the following Alberta grown plants: 

Atropa Belladonna 

Hyoscyamus niger (first year) 

Hyoscyamus niger (second year) 

Datura Stramonium 

Datura Me tel 

with a view of determining with what success these plants 
could be grown in central Alberta, from the viewpoint of 
both growth and alkaloidal content. 

For the determination of the alkaloidal content 
of the various plants, two methods were used: (a) The B.P. 
1932 method being an example of a cold percolation process; 
(b) The DeKay and Jordan method, being an example of a hot 
continuous extraction. 

From the investigation the following conclusions 
were drawn. 

1. The above plants can be successfully grown 
in central Alberta. 

2. The roots of Atropa Belladonna cannot resist 
the winter climate. 

3. The roots of Hyoscyamus niger can resist 
winter climate. 


4. 


The moisture contents were fairly uniform.

5. The ash values were within the B.P. limits. 

6. Atropa Bell adonna produced alkaloid in 
excess of B.P. requirements. 

7. Hyoscyamus niger (both years) falls below 
the alkaloidal requirements of the B.P. except by the 
DeKay and Jordan method. 

8. Second year’s growth of Hyoscyamus niger 
is richer in alkaloid than that of the first year. 

9. Datura Stramonium falls just below the 
alkaloidal requirements of the B.P. 

10. Datura Metel falls below the results given 
for commercial samples, and the growth is not particularly 
successful in Alberta. 

11. By both methods used, and from results 
obtained, the solanaceous alkaloids are more stable than 
they are variously reported to be. 

12. To avoid inaccurate results, plants contain¬ 
ing volatile bases should be treated for their removal. 

13. Using both methods on the same plants, the 
DeKay and Jordan method shows a much higher result, due 
probably, to more complete extraction.
