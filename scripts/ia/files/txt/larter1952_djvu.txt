ABSTRACT 


Mitotic and meiotic responses to 2,4-D were 
studied in barley* 

Separate ten-foot rows were treated on the same 
day, one with eight the other with 16 ounces of acid 
equivalent per acre* Treatments were repeated at three-day 
intervals• 

Cytological examination of meristems of treated 
seedlings disclosed chromosomal multiplication, stickiness 
and fragmentation* Abnormalities tended to be localized In 
separate tillers and reached maximum expression about nine 
days after treatment* 

A meiotic study of treated plants revealed that 
the most frequent abnormality that occurred in all dates of 
treatment was cells with sticky chromosomes* Chromosomal 
fragmentation and aneuploidy, however, was also commonly 
found. Maximum frequency of cytological abnormality occurred 
in material treated shortly before microsporogenesis• 

In an analysis of pollen from treated plants, the 
presence of pollen grains that were smaller and/or poorly 
filled with starch might be evidence that such were results 
of affected microsporocytes•

Abnormality frequencies in pollen mother cells and pollen grains 
were highly correlated. 

Rings and chains of four chromosomes were observed 
in two treated plants, while in another, a centric fragment was 
found to occur. 

The cytological results from the T1 generation 
were similar to those found in the treated material. It is 
postulated that the effects of 2,4-D were transmitted mainly 
as a chemical disturbance or stimulus, except in the case of 
the quadrivalents and the centric•fragment*

INTRODUCTION 


Prom the time that 2,4-D was first introduced 
as a chemical for weed control, a large number of field 
studies have been conducted on methods of application, 
and on its physiological and morphological effects. 

As a result of such studies, the action of this herbicide 
as a growth regulator or stimulator has been demonstrated* 
Moreover, it has been found that excessive stimulation 
with subsequent death is much more marked in dicotyledonous 
than in monocotyledonous plants* As a result, it is used 
more and more extensively for the control of broad-leaved 
weeds in cereal crops* 

Prom time to time, attention has been drawn to 
gross morphological effects in treated plants by both 
farmers and scientists* These abnormalities have consisted 
for the most part of twisted leaves, stems and spikes, 
extreme spike malformations, and sterility* Usually the 
explanation has been that spraying was done at susceptible 
stages of the plants or at excessive rates*

The literature shows that studies on the 
mitotic effects of 2,4-D are rather limited and confined to 
work under laboratory conditions* While these studies point 
to probably cytogenetic effects of this chemical, a study 
under field conditions would be necessary to determine if 
such effects are transmissible. Chromosomal or genetic 
disturbances ^.vould have far reaching effects in altering the 
genetic constitution, especially of presumably p\ire seed 
stocks. 

It is the purpose of this paper to report and 
discuss the investigations conducted to determine: 

1. 'Whether cytological abnormalities may be produced by 
field applications of 2,4-D. 

2. Whether the disturbances that may be produced are 


transmissible

LITERATURE REVIEW 


Mode of Action of 2.4-D. 

Many reports of the possible mode of action of 
2,4-D are available (2, 4, 16, 17, 26, 27). Many aspects 
in relation to its toxic action, however, are still not 
fully understood# 

It is generally agreed by workers in this field 
that most dicotyledonous plants absorb 2,4-D through their 
leaves more readily than do monocotyledonous plants# 
Blackman (2), and Mitchell (16), reported that penetration 
appears to be directly through the leaf cuticle rather 
than through the stomata a 

Once within the plant, transport of the chemical 
appears to be confined to living phloem tissue (2, 17). 
Mitchell and Brown (17), and Weaver and DeRose (27), how¬ 
ever, found evidence to show that upward transport in the 
xylem is also possible# Once the chemical is at the site 
of toxic action, biochemical differences that are known to 
exist between plants may be responsible for its selectivity

According to Mitchell and Brown (17), and Weaver 
and DeRose (27), any factor that generally affects the 
movement of photosynthetic material, also governs the 
rate of stimulus movement within the plant* Among such 
factors may be included root competition, moisture supply, 
and light (4, 26)* 

Blackman (2), and Mitchell (16), found 2,4-D 
to cause an upset of the carbohydrate balance within a 
susceptible plant* Reserve carbohydrates gradually de¬ 
crease, while reducing sugars at first accumulate and then 
diminish© 


Morphological and Physiological Effects of 2,4-D» 

The data being gathered concerning the physiolo¬ 
gical and morphological effects of 2,4-D with respect to 
practical field observations is voluminous and ever increas¬ 
ing* Friesen (11), and Olson, ejb al (20), reported that 
the treatment of wheat and barley at various stages of 
growth caused a significant reduction in yield at two 
widely separated periods* These stages of growth were an

interval extending from emergence to a height of about 
five inches, and again during the shot blade stage. 

Erickson, et al (10), and Mitchell (16), re¬ 
ported increased protein content of the grain when wheat 
seedlings were sprayed with field applications of 2,4-D. 
Erickson, et al (10), found a direct relationship between 
concentration used and percentage protein of the grain. 
Although no yields were recorded by him, he believed that 
a relationship existed between observed stunting of the 
plants and protein content of the grain, especially at 
higher concentrations. 

In similar work carried out with barley, Corns 
(3) reported finding that rates of three to six ounces 
of acid equivalent of 2,4-D per acre did not affect pro¬ 
tein content. There did occur a slight protein percentage 
increase {0,2% - 0.6%), when applications of over nine 
ounces were used. At the higher levels, however, a re¬ 
duction of over five bushels per acre resulted. 

Cotton seedlings grown from seed bolls present on 
the plant at the time of 2,4-D treatment, were found by 
Mcllrath (15), to exhibit varying degrees of leaf malformation. 
Lowered germination percentages also accompanied the 
morphological abnormalities at higher rates of application.

He also reported that the transmission of such anomalies 
via the seed embryos continued for a period of eight weeks 
post treatment* 


Cytological Effects of 2,4-D and Related Herbicides* 

Althou_gh there has been a limited amount of in¬ 
vestigation on the effects of various herbicides upon 
mitotic behaviour (7, 8, 19, 21), no such studies have 
been reported conducted on meiotic behaviour* Moreover 
no attempt has been made to determine whether cytological 
disturbances that may be induced by these chemicals could 
be transmissible* 

Nygren (19), while studying root tip mitoses 
affected by several chemicals, observed similar abnormalities 
produced by the three herbicides, 2,4—D, 2-methyl, 4-chloro- 
phenoxyacetic acid (methoxone), and 2,4,5-trichloropheno- 
xyacetic acid* C-mitotic pairing, stickiness, and chromo¬ 
somal fragmentation were the main disturbances observed* 
Difficulty in obtaining satisfactory staining of affected 
chromosomes lead Nygren to believe that toxic action 

of the chemicals caused a disturbed nucleic acid cycle*

Doxey and Rhodes (8), and Hyland (21), from 
their observations of root tips treated with two of the 
three chemicals used by Nygren (19), reported similar 
findings* Ryland (21), however, did not observe sticki¬ 
ness and fragmentation during her investigations* It is 
significant nevertheless, that both workers parallel the 
action of the herbicides upon chromosomal behaviour with 
that caused by X-rays, and to conditions found in tumerous 
tissue cells as reported by Koller (12)* 

Isopropyl phenyl carbamate was found by Doxey 
(7), to have an effect upon root mitoses similar to that 
of colchicine (14), and certain herbicides (8, 19)* 
Chromosomal contraction resulting from the action of this 
chemical was not as apparent, however, as that resulting 
from effects of some herbicides (8)*

Cytological Effects of Some Insecticides and Antibiotics> 

Prom results reported to date, the capability 
of these chemicals to induce changes in genetic make-up is 
evident (9, 25, 28)# 

The effects of D.D.T# insecticide upon plant 
mitoses, as reported by Vaarama (25), clearly resemble 
those of organic herbicides (7, 8, 19, 21)# Although 
acqueous solutions of this chemical produced only weak 
c-mitotic effects, alcoholic solutions gave rise to sticki¬ 
ness and fragmentation of chromosomes# Formation of nucleoli 
became progressively more prevalent from the metaphase to 
telophase stages of mitosis# 

The gamma isomer of benzine hexachloride apparently 
exerts its main influence upon the cell spindle rather than 
the chromosomes directly# Doxey and Rhodes (9), found 
that the spindle development at metaphase of mitosis was 
suppressed by the action of this chemical# The metaphase 
chromosomes were as a result, scattered throughout the cell# 
Chromosomal fragmentation, however, did not appear to be 
caused by this chemicalo 

Certain antibiotics have also been found capable 
of inducing mitotic abnormalities# Investigations by 
Wilson and Bowen (28), revealed that concentrations of

50 to 100 p.p 0 m* of Streptomycin, Aureomycin, and four 
other related antibiotics were capable of causing c-mitotic 
abnormalities* Concentrations of 150 p.p«m* induced severe 
stickiness and clumping of mitotic chromosomes* The 
affected cells failed to recover after termination of the 
various treatments© 


Cytological Effects of Some other Chemicals* 

Many chemicals other than those with herbicidal 
and insecticidal properties, have been studied for their 
ability to cause chromosomal changes® 

The action of colchicine is well known as a 
polyploidizing agent through its specific action of spindle 
suppression (14)* Kostoff (13), reported that the action 
of acenaphthene upon mitotic behavior is similar to 
that of colchicine* 

Other chemicals are more drastic in their action 
upon the cell® Darlington and Koller (5), and Novick and 
Sparrow (18), reported that the nitrogen and sulfur 
mustards produce serious chromatid breakage and stickiness*

These workers believe that such chemicals cause an over¬ 
charge of nucleic acid on the chromosomes* 

Auerbach, et al (1), reported lethal mutations 
to occur in Drosophila from the effects of mustard chem¬ 
icals, as detected by the C 1 B method* Although Auerbach 
(1) carried out similar experiments with other chemicals 
including carcinogens, no mutations were found to occur* 
Demeric (6), using methods similar to those 
used by Auerbach (1), later found dibenzanthrene to be 
a carcinogen with lethal mutagenic properties•

MATERIALS AND METHODS 


Qlli barley was used as the experimental material® 
Because of the small chromosome number (n = 7), cytological 
observations are facilitated especially if a large number 
of cells have to be analyzed in order to establish treat¬ 
ment effects® 

A 2,4-D Ethyl ester (Weedone) containing 34*6$ 
dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by weight, was applied by a. 
pressure tank sprayer® Two concentrations were used, viz®, 
eight ounces and 16 ounces of acid equivalent per acre® 

Both concentrations were applied in the form of a water 
spray at the equivalent rate of 80 gallons per acre® 

Single 10-foot space-planted rows were treated once with 
either the high or low concentration® Treatments were 
applied at three-day intervals so that the first plot was 
treated at emergence, and the fifteenth, or final plot 
at a period shortly after heading® 

To protect neighboring plots from spray drift, 
canvas shields were erected surrounding each row receiving 
treatment® Stages of development of untreated plots, as 
well as observable effects of the chemical on previously 
treated plots were recorded at each date of spraying*

An attempt was made to study the effects of the 
chemical on somatic tissue by the cytological examination 
of mitoses of stem meristems * On the twenty-first day 
following emergence, 20 seedlings were collected from 
material treated with each concentration at the seven 
previous treatment dates# All tillers from each plant 
were cytologically examined separately# 

At microsporogenesis, ten plants from each 
date and concentration of treatment were used for study. 
Since microsporogenesis in the main tillers was observed 
to occur at about the time of the twelfth treatment, 
only material from that date and the previous treatment 
dates were used for meiotic studies# Two tillers from 
each plant were examined and the number of microsporocytes 
per tiller ranged from 150 to 350# 

Several spikes were also selected from each con¬ 
centration and treatment date for pollen grain analysis# 
Two counts were made from each spike and an attempt was 
made to analyse only those florets that were at approxi¬ 
mately the same stage of development. Six thousand to 
8,000 pollen grains were examined from each treatment# 

Seed from all spikes of 13 treated plants 
exhibiting varying degrees of cytological abnormality

was seeded in head rows In the greenhouse In October, 

1951 a An attempt was made to examine cy t ologically one 
tiller from each of the five plants per head row* 

Unfortunately, greenhouse conditions were poor 
during the winter months, and as a result morphological 
studies of the T1 generation were thought inadvisable<» 

The cytological analysis of all treated and T1 
material was compared with that of control material* 

Material to be examined at microsporogenesis, 
as well as that used for pollen grain analysis, was fixed 
and stored in 6:3:1 Carney 1 s fluid A* The acetocarmine 
smear method as outlined by Smith (24), was used for 
pollen mother cell preparations* An acqueous solution 
of iodine in potassium iodide was used for pollen grain 
preparations* It was found that, unlike alcoholic solu¬ 
tions of iodine, the acqueous solution allowed sufficient 
time for slide examination before excess evaporation 
occurred# 

Stem meristem material was fixed in Parmer*s 
fluid and the Peulgen smear method was used for slide

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 


Cytological Data from Treated Material 


Mitotic Behaviour in Stem Meristems. 

It was found that the total number of actively 
dividing meristematic cells from plants within any one 
concentration were too small to establish a valid per¬ 
centage abnormality® As a result, the combined analysis 
of both concentrations were used to express the percent¬ 
age abnormality as found for egtchof the treatment dates® 
The results for both treated and control material are pre¬ 
sented in Table 1® 

The action of 2,4-D appeared to be localized to 
the extent that only those tillers that came in actual 
contact with the chemical were affected® On the same 
plant, therefore, there were some tillers with a high 
frequency of abnormal cells and others in which the divi¬ 
sions were normal® An extreme example was found in a

plant treated at emergence. Of 197 mitotic cells examined 
from two tillers of this plant, 33.3% were abnormal in the 
first tiller, and only 1.1% were abnormal in the second. 
There appeared to be, therefore, no transfer of chemical or 
stimulus from tiller to tiller. Mitchell and Brown (17), 
in their investigations of movement of 2,4-D within the bean 
plant, report similar findings. 

The results in Table 1 bring out one very striking 
effect of the chemical. The treatments applied from emer¬ 
gence to nine days thereafter, caused a similar frequency of 
abnormal mitoses. In material treated 12 days after emer¬ 
gence there occurred a marked increase in frequency of ab¬ 
normality, and then as a result of later treatments, a 
rapid decrease. This can be explained as follows: 

Since material from all treatments was sampled 21 
days after emergence, the effects of the chemical by that 
time probably had become constant in material treated on the 
first four dates. In material treated 12 days after emer¬ 
gence, (nine days before sampling), the effect and build up 
of abnormal mitoses was at a maximum. This observation co¬ 
incided very closely with morphological effects (wilting and 
leaf curling), which were most extreme approximately nine 
days after treatment. Since the chemical appears to cause 
progressively more abnormalities up to nine days after

application, in material treated shortly before sampling 
one would expect fewer abnormal mitoses* This is confirmed 
by the results from treatments applied 15 and 18 days 
after emergence, (six and three days respectively before 
sampling)* 

Such periods of increasing and decreasing frequen¬ 
cies of abnormal divisions suggested that many affected cells 
did not take part in further divisions. Nevertheless, as 
will be shown later, meiotic irregularities reappeared in 
early treated plants* It must be interpreted that either 
cells with a changed chromosomal complement continued to 
function, or that the chemical remained active within the 
plant* 

The types of aberrations that occurred were similar 
to those observed in treated root tips by Doxey and Rhodes 
(8), and Nygren (19). 

With exception of one treatment date, sticky chromo¬ 
somes were the most frequent and consistent abnormality* 
Polyploidy, however, occurred very frequently at one date of 
treatment* Although tetraploidy was the most commonly ob¬ 
served degree of duplication, a few octaploid cells were 
found. Pig* 2* In addition, there were observed cells with 
varying degrees of fragmentation and pycnosis* 

Control material was extremely regular with only 
three abnormal cells from a total of 312 examined.

Melotic Behaviour in Pollen Mother Cells 

The results from the examination of pollen mother 
cells from treated plants are presented in T a hle 2. The 
percentage abnormality for the two concentrations are com¬ 
bined and the mean percentage expressed for each treatment 
date» 

Two plants containing quadrivalents, and one con¬ 
taining a centric fragment will be discussed separately* 

The eytological results from these plants, therefore, are not 
included in Table 2* 

It is perhaps not surprising that the 16-ounce 
con.centr8.tion caused a significantly higher mean percentage 
abnormality than did the eight-ounce concentrations* (t = 
5*38, d*f. = 288) 0 Since the eytological results were 
expressed as a percentage abnormality, it was thought advis¬ 
able to transform the data prior to calculating tests for 
significance* The angle method was used, therefore, to make 
all. transformations. 

Attention should first be drawn to the variability 
of frequency of eytological aberrations between plants of the 
same treatment date* It was later found that the variability 
extended to different tillers of the same plant and even to 
different florets of the same spike* holler (12), reports

similar findings in naturally occurring tumerous tissues* 

He found aberrant mitotic cells to vary quantitatively from 
one tumour to another as well as within different regions of 
the same tumour. 

While there was no period at which the mean per¬ 
centage abnormality equalled that of controls, the highest 
frequency occurred just prior to, or during microsporogenesis. 

This stage at which spraying resulted in maximum meiotic 
disturbance coincides closely with that at which Olson et_ al 
(20), obtained a significant yield reduction in 2,4-D treated 
barley. 

The degree of morphological disturbance resulting 
from each treatment was not studied in the present investiga¬ 
tion. The treatment date that caused maximum meiotic dis¬ 
turbance, however, did not appear to cause excessive numbers 
of morphologically abnormal plants. Abnormal spikes, (Fig. 

1), and onion-like leaves occurred consistently throughout 
all treatments. These results, therefore, differ from those 
of Mcllrath (15), who found greatest morphological disturbance 
to occur in cotton plants sprayed at anthesis.

Stickiness of chromosomes was the most frequently- 
observed irregularity. The extent of stickiness ranged from 
a single sticky pair, (Fig. 5), to a clumping and agglutin¬ 
ation of the entire chromosomal complement within any one 
ceil, Fig. 5. In cases in which stickiness was severe, it 
was noted that the cytoplasm was vacuolated and disintegrated, 
Figs. 4 and 5. 

Microsporocytes containing acentric fragments were 
observed frequently. Many such fragments were not entirely 
separated from the mother chromosome, but remained attached 
by a fine chromatin thread, Fig. 6. No doubt, further chromo¬ 
somal movement would cause breakage of the connecting mater¬ 
ial allowing the fragments to be scattered throughout the 
cytoplasm, Fig. 7. The frequency of cells with fragments so 
closely paralleled that of cells with sticky chromosomes, that 
a highly significant correlation was found to exist between 
the two types of aberrations, (r = 0.85; t = 4.71 at d.f. = 
10). It may be that the primary action of the chemical was 
to cause stickiness by upsetting the nucleic acid charge with¬ 
in the chromosomes. Fragmentation occurred when cell division 
forces were exerted upon such sticky chromosomes.

Multiploid sporocytes, as described by Smith (£3), 
occurred consistently in all treated material at microsporo- 
genesis, Fig. 8. The chemical apparently had the effect of 
causing several pollen mother cells to fuse, resulting in 
multiples of the normal chromosomal complement to congregate 
at one common metaphase plate. The plants in which Smith (£3) 
found this irregularity to occur, frequently produced lowered 
seed set. 

Aneuploidy also occurred frequently. A cell was 
classified as being aneuploid only after it was established 
that the cell wall was entirely intact. Most aneuploid cells 
were observed to have six or eight bivalents, Fig. 9. Analysis 
of anaphase I and later of anaphase II, revealed that such 
cells were capable of further divisions, Fig. 10® It is, 
of course, questionable whether aneuploidy in a diploid species 
would be transmitted. If aneuploidy is transmitted, probably 
only aneuploid female gametes would be functional. 

A low frequency of cells with lagging chromosomes 
was also found at anaphase I and anaphase II, Figs. 11 and 1£. 

Although some polyploid cells were observed at 
meiosis, at no time was the duplication observed greater than 
a tetraploid, Fig. 13. Since such cells were not found con¬ 
sistently, the chemical or its stimulus appeared to remain 
active within the plant.

The occurrence of a few polycentric cells at 
meiosis, suggests that the influence of the chemical was in 
part upon the spindle, Fig. 14. 

Cells with univalents were observed at such a low 
frequency in all treatments, that their occurrence could not be 
regarded as a result of the action of the chemical# All cells 
observed to be affected in this way, contained 6 lt 2*, Figo 15* 
Two plants from treatments applied 21 and 27 days 
after emergence respectively, were found to contain rings and 
chains of four chromosomes. Figs# 16 and 17. In the first of 
these plants, both tillers revealed quadrivalents in 63*4$ and 
64.4$ of the pollen mother cells examined respectively© In the 
second plant, of which it was possible to examine only one 
tiller, 58.7$ of the cells were affected© A single cell from 
this tiller was observed containing a ring of 6, Fig, 18, 

Although an accurate count was not made of the pro¬ 
portions of cells with open and zig-zag quadrivalents, 
approximately only 10$ were of the latter type. Fig. 19. 
Undoubtedly the tillers in which rings and chains were found 
had reciprocally translocated chromosomes. The proportions 
of the two types of quadrivalents found, however, are not 
similar to those found by Smith (22). He reported finding a 
preponderance of zig-zag rings in microsporocytes of four 
barley plants affected with a reciprocal translocation.

It was expected as a result of the high frequency 
with which cells with open type rings occurred, that a high 
degree of sterility would occur in remaining spikes of affected 
plants* When the first of these plants was harvested, how¬ 
ever, it was found that only four of the nine spikes present 
on this plant exhibited partial sterility* Hie percentage 
of sterile florets in each affected spike was 41*4, 46*3, 

48*0, and 50*9 % 9 respectively* 

The second plant was found to exhibit no degree of 
sterility in spikes from remaining tillers* 

There is little doubt that the chromosomal trans¬ 
locations were induced by the chemical, since they were found 
both cytologically and by observable morphological effects 
only in certain tillers* 

A large proportion of the cells containing 7 ^^ were 
observed to have two open bivalents* If a small segment was 
involved in the interchange, cells with such configurations 
would be expected along with those containing rings and 
chains of four chromosomes* Moreover, such open bivalents 
with translocated segments could be orientated in such a way 
that balanced chromosomal complements could be formed at dis- 
juction. Functional gametes would be produced in this way* 

As a result, relatively good fertility would be obtained de¬ 
spite the high proportion of microsporocytes containing open 
rings of four chromosomes*

A single plant containing a centric fragment was 
also found in the treated material* The two tillers that 
were cytologically examined from this plant, revealed the 
fragment to be present in 87*4$ and 88*7^ of the pollen 
mother cells examined at metaphase I« Its behaviour at 
meiosis was similar to that of a univalent chromosome and 
it was possible to follow its movements through each stage 
of division. Pigs* 20 and 21* 

During the formation of quartets, the fragment 
was often excluded from the main nucleus and was then 
observed as a micronucleus in either one or two of the 
four sporocytes, Pig* 22*

Pollen Grain Analysis 

The cytologies! analysis of pollen grains from 
treated plants, further substantiated the earlier finding 
that a number of affected microsporocytes remained functional. 
It is possible that undersized and starch deficient pollen 
grains, (Fig. 25), resulted from such affected microsporo¬ 
cytes. It is true that the starch-iodine test cannot be 
regarded as a positive indication of pollen fertility. 
Nevertheless, it was found that the correlations between fre¬ 
quencies of abnormal microsporocytes and affected pollen grains 
were highly significant for both concentrations of the chemi¬ 
cal, Figs. 25 end 26. (r » 0.79 for the eight-ounce, and 
0.84 for the 16-ounce concentrations). 

The mean percentage of abnormal pollen from control 
plants was found to be only 1.5%. 

A study of pollen mitosis of treated plants undoubt¬ 
edly would have supplied definite information as to the exact 
nature of persisting aberrations.

Cytological Data from T1 Generation 


Frequencies and Types of Aberration 

The results of the cytological analysis of the Tl, 
excluding those from the progeny containing quadrivalents and 
the centric fragment, are shown in Table 3. 

In general, the frequencies of abnormality were 
similar to those found in treated material. Percentage varia¬ 
tions of affected microsporocytes between individual Tl plants 
was pronounced, the range being from 0.0% to 85.0% in plants 
studied. In contrast, control material was very regular 
having only 1.4% abnormal cells, (0.2% lower than that found 
in field grown checks). 

As shown in Table 3, the mean percentage of ab¬ 
normal pollen mother cells from all plants within certain 
head rows approximates that found in controls. This would 
again support conclusions drawn from earlier findings that only 
certain tillers of treated material were affected. These 
results from the Tl, however, cannot be regarded as conclusive, 
since too few plants were studied in some of the head rows in 
which meiosis appeared normal, (Table 3).

There occurred also, a great deal of variability 
in percentages of cytological abnormality found within pro¬ 
geny of a single treated tiller. In view of the variation 
found among different florets within a spike of a treated 
plant, however, this variability within T1 head rows is not 
surprising. 

Stickiness and fragmentation again were the most 
frequent aberrations found in the T1 generation, Figs. 4, 6, 
and 7. Multipioid aporocytes and aneuploidy also occurred 
consistently, Figs. 8, 9, and 10. 

It was concluded from the analysis of treated 
material that cells with severely sticky and fragmented 
chromosomes were unable to form functional gametes. The 
reoccurrence of such aberrations in the T1 generation is 
further evidence that the chemical or its effects persisted. 

This belief was also borne out by a preliminary 
study of root tip mitoses from germinated seeds of treated 
plants. Although no fragmentation or stickiness was observed, 
both c-mitotic pairing and unsatisfactory staining of chromo¬ 
somes in affected cells were apparent, Fig. 24.

Transmission of Quadrivalents and Centric Fragment 

Cytological analysis of 35 T1 plants from the two 
treated plants containing quadrivalents, revealed that only the 
progeny of the partially sterile spikes exhibited microsporocytes 
with rings and chains of four chromosomes. As mentioned earlier, 
only four of the remaining nine spikes on the first of these 
treated plants were partially sterile. The second plant pro¬ 
duced normal seed set in all remaining spikes. 

The proportion of affected and unaffected plants that 
occurred in each of the four head rows, as well as the chromosomal 
constitution of the microsporocytes, is shown in Table 4.

The mean percentage of microsporocytes that were 
cytologically observed containing rings and chains of four 
chromosomes was 58.9%, (5.0% less than that found in affected 
tillers of the parent plant). Moreover, a high frequency of 
cells with 7^ again occurred, in many of which, two of the 
seven bivalents were observed to be open. Since the propor¬ 
tion of quadrivalents found in the T1 approximates that found 
in treated material, viable gametes containing the translo¬ 
cation were formed with a relatively high frequency. As 
would be expected, approximately one-half of the progeny from 
affected tillers were heterozygous for the translocation. 

Cytological examination of T1 plants from the 
parent with the centric fragment, revealed that it was in 
only one of 12 plants examined. In this plant, 85.1% of the 
pollen mother cells were affected. The fact that the fra¬ 
gment was in only one plant indicates that the aberration 
was transmitted only by the ovule.

CONCLUSIONS 


Field applications of 2,4-D even at the lowest 
concentration used, were found to cause gross chromosomal 
irregularities in barley. Nevertheless, even in florets where 
the percentage of microsporocyte abnormality was high, there 
still would be produced a sufficient amount of normal pollen 
to affect fertilization. Moreover, in a diploid species 
such as barley, competition between normal male gametes and 
those with slight chromosomal unbalance would probably result 
in almost complete ineffectiveness of the latter. It would 
therefore be expected that there would occur little if any, 
transmission of aberrations through the pollen. 

There are possibilities, however, that chromosomal 
unbalance caused by this chemical could be transmitted 
through the pollen of polyploid species. 

In barley, it is believed that if chromosomal 
disturbances are transmitted as such, it would occur via the 
female gamete. Nevertheless, it is again doubtful whether 
gross chromosomal aberrations or unbalance in barley can be 
transmitted in this way

The action of 2,4-D upon cells is in some respects 
similar to that of colchicine, and in other respects similar 
to that of known mutagens. In causing doubling and c-mitotic 
effects on chromosomes, it resembles colchicine* In bringing 
about fragmentation and reciprocal translocations, it behaves 
more like a mutagen. The fact that many different types of 
aberrations are found in any one tiller, floret or anther, 
indicates that, (l) the action of 2,4-D is not specific, and 
(2) the chemical remains active long after it has been 
applied. 

While some T1 plants appeared to be morphologically 
affected, further generations will have to be grown to deter¬ 
mine whether the effects were the result of a changed genetic 
constitution as caused by the chemical. In any case, to de¬ 
termine whether gene mutations have been produced will require 
further generations® 

The fact that translocations and centric fragments 
were found in the relatively small number of plants that 
could be studied cytologically. Is evidence that 2,4-D even 
in field strength can cause chromosomal aberrations similar 
to those caused by X-rays and other mutagens. Until It can be 
proven that the performance and important characteristics of 
all futiire progenies of treated plants are unchanged, the use 
of 2,4-D as a weed spray on pure seed stocks must be considered 


hazardous
