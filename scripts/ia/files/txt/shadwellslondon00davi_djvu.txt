INTRODUGTCHY 


Since the publication of Ivlontague Summerses 
great edition of the complete v^rorks in 1927, it is no 
longer true to say that Shadwell is neglected; and it is 
safe to predict that that will be even less true in the 
future. The previous neglect, for which Dryden must take 
much of tlB blame, was on the Yhiole undeserved. Shadwell^ 
work is by no means dull throughout: the audience that 
applauded The Way of the World made the success of 
The Squire of Alsatia a theatrical proverb. 

But the business of this thesis is not with 
Shadwell as a dramatist. It is a study of Shadwell*s 
London »- the London in which he lived and which he 
put on the stage again and again. 

I have used the writings of some of 
Shadwell*s contemporaries, chiefly Pepys and Evelyn, 
to show the accuracy of his view and the truth of his 
presentation of life as he saw it. I have tried to 
show hoviT his theatre and his audience modified and 
limited the picture that he draws. 

ii piece of corroborative evidence for the 
accuracy of that picture is the fact that Scott, with 














his keen eye for historical detail, used The Squire of 
iilsatia and The Volunteers as studies for scenes 
and manners in ‘The fortunes of iMi^el and Peveril of the 
Beak respectively.

James’s Park and Hyde Park were large areas of treed and

country villages, entirely separate from London; and South¬ 
wark was surrounded by marshes and open fields. Moreover, 
the maps and plans of the time show gardens with most of the 
houses, even quite ordinary dwellings. Pepys had a garden; 
and in Shadwell, the houses of Lady Love youth ( The Humorists) , 
Goldingham, ( The Miser ), Sir Nicholas Gimcrack, ( The 
Virtuo^so) , and Lady Cheatly, ( A True «Tidow ) , possess gardens.

the Frenchman that was hang’d for burning on’t was a Llartyr;® 

he was so glad at the burning of it, that ever since he has 

kept the second of September a Festival.” 

It appears to have been the fire that finally 

put a stop to the plague. Shadwell’s audience and the actors 

of his earlier plays were survivors, and must have vividly 

remembered the great plague of 1665, and it is natural to 

find him referring to it. Thus Lump says: ”I would as soon 

( 13 ) 

catch the Plague, as that Disease of Hit.”

Venereal disease was so common as to be constantly | 

made the subject of jokes, and the basis of similes, Crazy,| 

in The Humorists, a repulsive figure, is terribly stricken

Maggot says of a^poem he has composed: ^’’tis elaborate, I 

kept my Chamber about it as long as a Spark does, of a 

Clap, or a Lady of a Child; I purged and bled, and enter’d 

(16) 

into a Liet about it.’* 

The absence of references to fog suggests that 
the ciir was purer than it is today, or at least that the 
’’London particular”, which is intensified by the smoke from 

thousands of hearths, was still a thing of the future.

Shops^ and sometimes houses, were distinguished 

by swinging signs. ’’Hang him upon the the next sign”, 

shouts a ?/eaver, when Sir Lormal Trifle tries to placate 

the mob;^^and Carolina’s landlord (in The Sullen Lovers ) 

(19) 

has just had a nevi sign painted. 

Certain localities and streets of London v/ere 
devoted to certain trades and occupations. Something of 
this is reflected in one of the speeches in Hildishls 
paneg^/ric on London to Lord Bellamy: 


All these things have we at London. The product 
of the best Cornfields at <^ueen-Hithe; Hay, Straw,’; 
and Cattle, at Smithfield; with Horses too: S 

^There is such a Garden in Europe, as the Stocks^- j 
llarket? VJhere such a river as the Thames? Such 
Ponds and Decoys, as in Leaden-Hall-Market, for 
your Fish and Fowl? Such Game as at the 
Poulterers'? (20) 

One of the oldest of such special streets was j 
Lombard Street, where the bankers had established themselves'

site of the old stocks, where the Mansion House no¥; stands. 

Smithfield is famous also for the burning of martyrs 
(referred to in Shadwell , V, 127, The. Volunteers. ) In the 
same play, Major General Blunt has ’’come up to this Smith- 
field CLondon] like a Horse-Courser, to put off a Brace of 
i^illies, in this Market of Matrimony.^’ (p.l65)

Grub Street, so famous in the next century, had 
even by Shadwell’s time acquired a character of a kind. Il

Street (which had been built only in 1667) was a fashionable | 
quarter. That may be, but the fact that not only Snarl, 1 

but also Sir Nicholas Gimcrack and his wife, keep their ’ 

guilty assignations there, does at least adumbrate its ! 

(24) i 

modern reputation. ‘ 

"lye-Corner" and Ram Alley are mentioned in The 
(25) 

Woman-Captain as the site of cooks’ shops. 

Law students were expected to attend the sittings I 

of the courts in Westminister Ha^l. Sir Humphrey Maggot is i 

therefore annoyed to find his nephew walking in the streets:

This leads us to one of the most interesting i 

localities of London, Alsatia, a portion of ITiitefriars, on '! 
the site of the old Carmelite priory. It was regarded as a 
place of special sanctity, and even after the suppression of 
the monasteries, its inhabitants claimed certain privileges | 
and exemptions. By the time of James I, Alsatia had I 

established its claim to afford sanctuary to debtors, and 
the claim remained almost unchallenged until 1697, when it 
was finally forbidden. Shamv/ell and Cheatly, the ruffianly 
companions of Belfond Senior, (in The Squire of Alsatia) . 
are afraid to venture out of its bounds for fear of arrest. ' 
It is here that Sir .•■/alter Scott owes lr\is great debt to 

iwhadv?ell; he arew heavily on this play for scenes in Ihe 
Fortunes of Nigel .

sometimes goes for a ride to ''Hamstead or Highgate”. 

I have mentioned banking. Shadv/ell gives no 

hint of the remarkable development during his period, which 

culminated in the passing of the Bank of England Act in 

1693, the year after his death. The systems to ¥rhich he 

does refer are almost primitive. Goldingham, the Miser, 

buries his gold in his garden; he also puts money out at 

interest, and spends a great deal of time in calculation how 

much it will come to with ’’use upon use”, that is, compound 

interest. Mrs. Cheatly describes him as having ’’the Villainy 

of fifty Jews, and which is more, of ten London Brokers, in 
(30) 

hiin.” Most of the banking business of the time had come 
into the hands of the goldsmiths. Lady Cheatly, (the ’’true 
widow”) ho'wever, is a private banker, and, incidentally, an 
embezzler. She spreads reports of her great wealth, with

There was a sudden flurry of stods*jobbing in 
the ’80’s a,nd ’90’s. Shadwell satirizes it in his post- 
Injimous comedy, The Volunteers, or. The Stock-Jobbers , 

A groiAp of Puritan merchants take up new inventions -- 
Vfhether useful or not does not matter -- a.nd float com¬ 
panies, sell their shares at a profit, and slide out 
before the stock begins to drop. One invention that is 
expected to *’go all over England” is a mouse-trap -- 
”a Mouse-Trap, that will invite all Mice in, nay Rats too 
¥7hether they will or no; a whole share, before the 


f 


Pa.tent,is fifteen Pound; after the Patent, they will 

( 2 ^) 

not take sixty”. The jobbers, so to speak, get in 

on the ground floor. 

The traae of the period was principally with 
the Indies, which were looked upon as ine:>diaustible sour¬ 
ces of YiTealth. ’’Did I not hear a certain young La.dy say,

(36) 

dora has ventured money at sea. 

Instead of single *’ventures** being sent out, 
comiDa.nies 'v?ere soraetimes formed and fleets of trading 
ships dispatched. The Hudson’s Ba^r Company (1670) 
belongs to our period; the reorganization of the East 
India Compauiy (founded 1600) took place just before the 
Restoration. 

We must return to the physical conditions 

of London. The na-rrow streets must have been noisy, 

even by present-da.y standards. Coaches and waggons 

ra,ttled over the cobbles; hawkers shrilled out their 

cries; droves of cattle on their wb.j to Smithfield a^nd 

slaughter added to the din. At any moment a fooi.- 

pasoengsr might be engulfed in a crowd of rioting 

labourers, (like the ribbon-weavers in The Virtuoso ) 

or turbulent fa^natics (like the Eifth Monarchy Men). 

If it were Shrove Tuesday, a v/ise mn would stay in 

the utterly respectable quarters of the town, for 

on that d8.y it ?/as the custoii^Lf the ’prentices to

Hearty/at 


At night it was no better. yith luck, tne 
worst disturbances vvould be funerals (very often, perhajjs 
usually, held at night) or the bellman, calling out the 
hours. Stanford grumbles about both: 


Besides, when after all my persecutions, I think 
To ease my self at night by sleep, as last 
night, 

About eleven or twelve of Clock; at a solemn 
Funeral the Bells set out: That Men should be 
Such Owls to keep five thousand 
People awake, with Ringing a Peale to him that 
does not heare iti 


. . . This was no sooner past, but 
About two in the Morning comes the Bell-man, 
And in a dismal Tone repeats lYorse Rhymes'. 
Then a Cast Poet of the Nursery can make.'^^' 

Sir V/illiam Rant’s friend Tope enlarges on this. Rant 

suggests: ’’prithee Jack, what if we three whould resolve 


once, to go to bed sober in a Frol^ick.” ’’Faith Jack”, 
says Jildfire,”let us I’en try how it will agree with us. 
Tope: ”wlhat a Pox do you mean? are you mad? stark mad? 
I go to bed sober’ what, to hear Chimes, 3^11-men, 
and tell Clocks all night, and be Flea-bitten like a 


Nurse-Maid?”

Barbarous tunes, and upon their Toting 
Instruments ma.ke a more Hellish Noise they they 
Do at a Play-house .^[hfn they flourish for the 
Entrance of 7/itches. ' 

Perhaps Shadwell was faintly suggesting a reform when he 
invented Sir 7filliam Rant’s improvement on this fashion: 
”It is a common blockheaded trick to serenade and disturb 
people at midni^t; I am come to serenade you at Noon, 

( 42 ) 

and have ordered my dinner to come hitherP’' ‘ 

Finally, there were the Scowrers, who made the 

ni^t hideous , with their shouting and songs and breaking 

of windows, and dangerous, with thhrr attacks on unwary 

passengers. The Scowrers were the manifestation, in 

Shadwell’s time, of what threatened to be a perennial 

crop of disturbers of the peace. ”7diy,”says Tope, 

knew the Hectors, and before them the Muns and the 

Titire Tufe, they v;ere brave fellows indeed; in those days 

a man could not go from the Rose Tavern to the Piazza

four generations of similar bands of marauders had gone

before; of these the Hectors were probably the most danger¬ 
ous. In Swift’s time they were known as Mohocks. 


Tope explains again: , the great end \pf} 

(44) 

. .is disturbing of Mankind.” 


Serenading and Scowering . . 

The Scowrers engaged in all sorts of pleasant tricks: 
breaking v/indows, wiping out the chalked milk-scores on 
the doorsj and lamp-blacking the signs that hung out into 
the streets. Sir William Rant’s reputation for "scowering 
had spread through the town, and one morning he found a 
"pert dapper fellow" waiting to see him: 


An please your Worship I am a Glazier, and have 
an humble petition to your Worship; your Glazier 
dyed within this hour, the bell now goes for him; 
and I humbly desire I may succeed in your Worships 
work. ... He has had a fine time under you, 
for your Worship I understand has to Shash-v/indows 
an utter aversion, Sir,when you are in beer. . . . 
Now if your Worship will let me have the place, I 
shall see that all" the Parish, ?dien you please to 


break their windows, shall have as good goods as 
any man can furnish ’em with. 


Sir Christopher Swash, in The Woman-Captain , is another 


Scowrer. His account of a night’s work is worth quoting: 


Gad we have had a rare Night on’t, we have

GOVSREMENT i^D WORSHIP 


> Lag and Order | 

Under this heading I have collected a few 
scattered notes which indicate some of the attempts to [ 

maintain peace^ order^ and good government. Such attempts 
had seldom been more necessary. A space of thirty years ii 

(1660-1690) saw the Restorationj the plague and fire, ' 

the Dutch Wars, the Popish Plot, Monmouth’s Rebellion, and 
the Revolution of 1688, as well as frequent insurrections | 
such as those of tne Pifth Monarchy Men.^^^ And yet 
Shadwell says very little about it all. He was an 

ardent Vl/hig, and it may be that his experience with : 

( 2 ) ■ 

Ilie Lancashire Witches had taught him to avoid 


in the comedies 

hi^ subjects of controversy. All his references/to 


national affairs are innocuous, as, for instance, this 
bit of dialogue between young Hackyi/ell and Sir Timothy 
Kastril. The war referred to is the campaign in Planders 
against the French (1692). 


Hackwell Junior , '^hiat makes you such an enemy 
to this "War? are you a Jacobite?

As a too, he is able to throw/a few morsels of 

homage to his master, William III. This refers to his 

later comedies. Thus in Bury-Fair , Lord Bellamy has 

an argument with the French ’’Count", in the course of 

which he asserts of 'William: "How much greater is 

{ 4 ) 

ours, who is a King of Men, and Free Men I" 

In the field of City government, our first 
passage is taken from A True Widov/ . Young I^Iaggot, 
pleading for his precious verses, begs his uncle: "For¬ 
give me once, and I’ll mend, and be as dull as an o\A 
■fdi Alderman, that sleeps over Justice at the Old 
Bally. 

The City militia, ortrained bands, come in 
for a bob or two. In the Prologue to The Woman-Captain 
(possibly as a result of the Popish Plot scare in the 
previous year) Shadwell could write: 

Every Fop’s a Politician grown. 


The Citt, who with his TTife and hopeful Son 
Would come t’a merry Pla^^, now all does shun, 
And on the Guard learns to let off a Gun.^^'

Aside from a few other references/to 

those quoted above, Shadwell's plays yield nothing 

more on this subject except a number of accounts of 

punishments for various crimes and misdemeanours, 

"Lay hold on the Bawd, we’ll have her Carted, 

Seize her till Sir Nicholas comes in; wet 11 have her 

sent to Bridewel, and soundly whipt there, and then

punishment of infamous women -- when they were punished. 
After being publicly carted through the streets, they 
were confined in the Bridewell house of correction, 
and set to beating hemp, with an occasional whipping 
to improve tlieir morals,

2. Relip.ion and superstition . 

On July 19, 1655, Evelyn writes: ’^On Sunday 
afternoon, 1 frequently staid at home to catechise and 


instruct my family, those exercises universally ceasing in 


the parish churches, so as people had no principles, and 
grev/ very ignorant of even the common points of Christianity, 


all devotion being now placed in hearing semons and dis¬ 


courses of speculative and national things’^; and in the 
next year: went to London, to receive the Blessed 

Sacrament, the first time the Church of England was reduced li 

i 

to a chamber and conventicle; so sharp was the persecution. 

i 

The parish-churches were filled with sectaries of all sorts,! 


blasphemous and ignorant mechanics usurping the pulpits 
every¥7here.Episcopacy had been abolished twelve years 
earlier, and in 1645 an ordinance had forbidden the use of 
the Prayer-Book. Strife and oppression had marked the 

religious life of the English under Oliver no less than | 

i: 

under Charles 1. I 

j 

Jith the Restoration, the Church of England was { 
resuscitated, and proved to be stronger than before the | 

i 

Rebellion; hut it was not found possible to suppress all thej 
conventicles, and in Shadwell^s plays we find Puritans who |f 
openly attend their '’meetings jl; 


II 
























While there were douhtless thousands who 
sincerely welcomed the revival of the Established Church, 
there seems to have been a growing amount of indifference 
to religion, especially in the upper levels of society. 

None of Shadwell’s fashionable Londoners really care about 
religion. Their attitude is flippant. The church performs 
two functions in their lives; to get them acquainted with 
the other sex, and to marry them. Some of the women do^go 
to church to say their prayers, but one cannot help sus¬ 
pecting that half their purpose is to be seen by the men. 
The subject of "ogling^* in church is discussed in the next 
chapter. 

All the Puritans in the plays are either hypo¬ 
crites or fanatics, although in fact there must have been 
large numbers of sincere and sober Q,uakers, Presbyterians, 
Anabaptists, 

An entirely gratuitous gibe at non-conforming 
parsons shows Shadwell, as so often, catering to the 
prejudices of his audience. It occurs in The Miser ; the 
scene is "Chatolins ’ , the famous French tavern. Rant 
wants to drink Mrs. Joyce’s health, and calls out; ’’here 
Boy give me a glass, (Boy gives a little glass). A pox on 
this Thimble, give me such a Grlass as your Nonconforming

One is reminded distantly of Dickens’s Mr. Stiggins. Luinp,||

replies Lady Cheatly, ”the godly have two qualities, which 

would spoil my design; great Covetousness (which would make 

’em pry too narrowly into our Fortune) and much Eating

Luiap objects to the fiddlers: jj

and he would have an act of Parliament against wit. 

Following his master lonson, Shadwell also pokes 

fun at the elaborate names affected by the Puritans. 

Colonel Hackwell calls for his servants: "V/here are you: --

Long suffering, ■— fight a good fight. Habakkuk, Nehemiah,*- 

where are you all?** Well might his friend Nickum say; 

(4) 

**What a Muster Roll of Christen-names is here.** 

Shadwell is in the direct line of tradition when 

he ridicules the gorging of the **godly**. Colonel Hackwell 

refuses to join a party at his friend Blunt*s until the 

dancing is over; dancing, he believes, is immoral: 

Hackv\rell Senior . Save you sir, I look upon 
Dancing as Vanity, and I crave leave to be absent

numiber of other sects, including Quakers, Brovmists, and 

( 7 ) 

Fifth Monarchy Men. The teachings of the Quakers are well 
known. Their strictness is used as a simile by Groldingham’s 
man Robin: tell you, you will sooner perswade Quakers to 

conform, and wear the Surplice ... than him to part with 
any money*’. ^Another more general comparison is made by 
Woodly: can no more restrain my self, than a Fanatick 

( 9 ) 

full of nev^r lights and revelations can himself.” The 
phrase pretty well sums up the common opinion of the 
religion of the Nonconformists. 

Brownists were followers of Robert Brov/n; they 
had appeared in Elizabeth’s time, and were also known as 
Separatists, since they insisted on the separation of Church 
and State.

the Anabaptists, who would have the adventurers obliged only 
by an engagement, without swearing, that they might still ! 
pursue their private trade; but it was carried against them.”| 
(November 26, 1657). Colonel Hackwell does not swear 
except in an emergency; in his amazement at Sir Nicholas I 

Dainty’s elaborate preparations for war, all he says is | 

’’Most intollerable, this worketh in me great Amazement”, and |

Another superstition is glanced at when Mrs.

Devil for money"; which I interpret as "that e^er yet s 
ventured a soul to the devil for money". 

ti 

The belief in witches lasted long after Shadwell^sj 

time. Apart from his play on the subject, The Lancashire ’ 11 

Witches , with which we are not here concerned, 1 have found | 

one reference to witchcraft: Theodosia, wooed by Carlos, ;;; 

says, "I see you are resolved to watch me, to make me con- ||

Touching for the King’s Evil, or Scrofula, was I 
re-introduced by Charles II, or perhaps it would be nearer ( 
the truth to say that he was induced to resume it. Evelyn I 
records the first occasion on which he exercised his | 

\rt. 

supposed power (July 5, 1660). This superstition was I 

ill 

surrounded with religious ceremony and ritual; Besant re- i 

( 18 ) I

Shadwell refers to it once. Sir Humphrey Maggot, in his |

MmimRS AlsFD CUSTOMS IN SEADmLL^ S LONDON 

1. Dress and personal adornment . 

It is not to be expected that Shadwell should j| 
have given a complete account of the fashions in dress and ■£ 
adornment of his time; but it is possible to glean from 
his plays a mass of information on the subject. Most of ii 

I 

his references to costume concern the fashionable world |1 

ii' 

and its fads and fripperies, especially the women’s | 

"melioration of nature". I have discovered no allusions to | 

!i 

the dress of the middle and lo?/er classes. That is only j 
natural. Costume is subordinate to plot and character, and 
only what contributes to plot and character is mentioned. i. 
But with this limitation, Shadwell is remarkably faithful I 

if 

to the manners and fashions of his contemporaries. 

"Indeed most young Fellows v/hen they come to | 

Town, dress at me", says Selfish;and perhaps a third of I 
all his lines in the play are on the subject of dress or || 

"shape". "Sure, I am not so lean; I was told I look’d 4

pretty plump to day: hahl my damned Hogue has put me into 
the most hustling Stuff; Bellamour, I like thy Breeches 
well...,your Taylor shall make minet Pox on my Valet de 


Chambre, how he has tyed my Cravat up to day; a man cannot 


get a good Valet de Chambre.. 

Even if clothes were not such a passion with 
everyone, all gentlemen at least attached the proper 
importance to dress. Fepys is a good example; he assiduous-I| 
ly records all the details of his ^^fine Camlett cloak", his |i| 
silk suits, and so forth. Brisk, in The Humorists , is 'I 

another of the same sort: ’^You must know I do value my | 


(3) I 

self upon my Cloaths, and the judicious wearing of ’em.” i: 


The general scheme of a gentleman’s dress in the 
later seventeenth century does not need description here, 
but Shadwell gives a number of details interesting enough 
to pause over. 


?Jhen Mr. Wildish is going out, he calls for his | 

{ 4 ) 

gloves, handkerchief and sword, but not for his hat. | 

Hats were Virorn indoors, as we learn from another passage in 
the same play. Mr. Trim has come to call on Wildish.

for his peruke, Tuberose, and orange-flower water for his |

stock of perfumed gloves to sell: ’’Amber, Orangery, Genoa, !

Mr. Snarl (who really is very helpful in detail- i 

!ij 

ing all his aversions) also objects to the use of patches: ! 

’’Some Ladies with scabs and pimples on their faces invented 

(21) ii 

patches, and those that have none must follow.” Patches, I 

Besant tells us, came in under the Commonwealth, and 

remained in use for well over a century. They were little 

bits of black taffeta stuck on the face, either, as Snarl 

suggests, to hide blemishes, or else, possibly, to attract 

attention to a particular feature. 

He then goes on to another sore point: 

...Just as our young Fellows imitate the French; their 
Summer Fashion of going open-breasted came to us at 
Michaelmas, and we wore it all Vifinter; and their 
Winter-faShion of buttoning close their strait-long- 
wasted Coats, that made them look like Mbnkies, came 
not to us "fill March, and our Coxcombes wore it all

He has incidentally given a description of a 


certain fashion affected hy men, hut the point I wish to 
bring out is the French influence. The return of Charles 
II, who had spent most of his exile in France, undoubtedly 
had a great deal to do with Englishmen's subsequent 
admiration for France and French ways. But Charles was not 
entirely to blame. 

Bellamour . ...but how go matters in France? "^^hat new 
Foppery is turn'd up Trump there? 

Carlos . «7hat with Governors, Ladies eldest Sons, 
Embassadors and Envoyes, you have 'em here almost as 
soon as the French themselves.^ 



his plays reflect (as they do 


many other conditions) how large French influence bulked in 

English life,^often makes a point of praising England. So 

for instance in his Prologue to The Iliser . he admits 

"stealing from the French": 

But though he has no vi/it, he has some shame, 

And stealing from the French conceals his name. 

French Plays, in which true wit's as rarely found 
As Mines of Silver are in English ground; 


But stay, I've been too bold; methinks I see 
The English Monsieurs rise in mutiny. 

Crying confound him, does he damn French Plays, 
The only Pieces that deserve the Bayes: 

France that on Fashions does strict Lav/s impose 
The Universal Monarchy for Cloaths, 

That rules our most important part, our dress, 
Should rule our wit, which is a thing much less

That he niay please ye with small stock of brain: 

For our good nature Nation thinks it fit 

To count French Toys, good 77ares; French nonsence, wifi 

King Charles himself, indeed, had in 1666 made a 
definite attempt to put a stop to '’the Monsieurs’ vanities”. 
Evelyn has an interesting entry (October 18, 1666): 

To Court. It being the first time his Majesty put 
himself solemnly into the Eastern fashion of vest, 
changing doublet, stiff collar, bands and cloak, into 
a comely dress, after the Persian mode, v/ith girdles 
or straps, and shoe-strings eind garters into buckles, 
of which some were set with precious stones, resolving 
never to alter it, and to leave the French mode, which 
had hitherto abtained to our great expense and reproact. 
...I had sometime before presented an invective ; 

against that unconstancy, and our so much affecting 
the French fashion, to his Majesty, in which I toci; 
occasion to describe the comeliness and usefulness of 
the Persian clothing, in the very same manner his I 

Majesty now clad himself. This pamphlet I entitled 
Tyrannus, or the Mode ... 

But Charles proved ’’unconstant”, and the French fopperies 
went merrily on. Thus when Mrs. Fantast hears that a 
French Count has arrived at Bury, she is all agog, ignores 
her English suitors, and exclaims in a flurry: ”Hal A French 
Count? Oh Lord I I am afraid I am not in Order enough: 
he’ll certainly make addresses to me; how is my dress?” 

And her maid, well trained, replies, ’’Very French, and very

A feature of women’s costume to which there are | 
innumerable references in the plays of the time was the 

h 

vizard-mask, or vizor-mask. This was a piece of black | 

!; 

velvet which, as its name implies, covered the features 
and was used as a disguise. In Elizabethan times, women 

of quality wore masks when they went out, especially to ;|i 

1 

the public theatre, which was not considered a decent 

place for ladies. The fashion ?/as soon taken up by 

prostitutes -- ’’vizard”, in fact, became a common term for i 
(26) 

such a woman — and respectable women consequently gave it i 
up, as a rule. But for special purposes and occasions 
they did sometimes ¥/ear masks as late as the end of the 
seventeenth century; and this fact makes possible a great 
many of the complications and mystifications so dear to 
many of the Restoration dramatists. Shadwell was not 
above using it; thus in Epsom-Wells , Bevil, half-heartedly | 
carrying on an intrigue with Mrs. Woodly, accidentally 
meets her (masked) in a field v/hen they are surprised by 
her husband. He takes her for Carolina, whom both men

love, and she manages to deceive him by refusing to 

unmask.Of more interest is the play scene ^^^^in A 

True Widow , where Isabella, who has put on a mask in order 

to remain unknown to her admirer, Bellamour, is put into a 

most embarrassing situation on that account,

4, Man , Faith1 she earns all the Cloaths on her Back 
by lying on’t; some Punk lately turnM out of Keeping, 
her Livery not quite worn out. 

Poor Isabella can only say to herself: ”I deserve this by 

coming in a Masque.” 

The following bit of dialogue illustrates the 

French influence on personal adornment: 

Theodosia . ....Mat have you learnt there?\in France^ 
Carlos . To love my own Countrey, and to think that 
none can show us so fine Women; in France they buy 
their Beauty, and sell their Love. . . 

Theodosia . That Fashion is coming up apace here.^'^-*-' 

Shadwell, at any rate, seems to think that painting was 

brought over from France, and has many bitter things to 

say about it:

as if thou wert painted by some leud Painter for the Sign j

”What a Pox, you and your Daughter are notorious, for out- 
painting all the Christian Jezebels in England.” ”’Tis 
false, rude Fellow”, she retorts; ”we only use a Wash, and | 
lay on a little Red.” He, intent on showing his wit, 

returns smartly: ”No more does a Wall: but you, for your |

These passages give us some idea of the means by j 

which women adorned themselves in Shadwell’s London. j 

Painting seems to have been uncommon enough to remark on, 

among respectable women; patches were accepted without j 

comment, except by old-fashioned people like Snarl, and | 

other improvements remained more or less well concealed „ 

from the general public. But Shadwell, the valuable 

informant, knoirs and tells them all.

2. Personal accomplishments and habits; morals . 

Shadwell manages to tell us, casually, a good 
deal about the upbringing and behaviour of the people of 
his time, especially of the ladies and gentlemen ■— his 
own class, on the whole. For although he had married an 


actress and was a professional writer, he was the son of a || 
gentleman; he had studied at Cambridge; and he associated | 
on equal terms with such brilliant men as Buckingham, j| 

Sedley, and Etherege. f| 

His plays reflect contemporary methods of 11 

education, and the situation, in Bury-Fair , of the girl !L‘ 
disguised as a page, offers him an opportunity to comment | 
unfavourably on a practice which still survived at the iS 

time, namely, the sending of gentlemen’s sons as pages into | 
the households of noblemen. The page seems to be a sur~ I 
vival of the squire under the feudal system. Shadwell J 

objects to the practice, at least, as it was actually | 

carried on: | 

CLordl Bellamy . I use thee not as other Hoblemen their jj 

Pages, who let Gentlemens Sons ride at the Tails of p| 

their Coaches, crouded ViTith rascally Footmen: ’tis ^ 

a French mode; they used formerly to give ’em the ij 

same Education with their Sons, which made their i| 

Fortunes; and ’twas a Preferment then, for a GentleoBllifei 
younger Son...^^’^) |

With exaggeration pardonable in satire, Shadwell I 
wrote the following stinging dialogue. He believed that ■; 


the purpose of comedy was to instruct and improve, and here 
takes the first step towards improvement, that is, exposing 
the faults he saw around him. The scene is the first of 
The Virtuoso ; Bruce is discovered reading Lucretius, and 


Iff 


Longvil enters: 

I 

Longvil . ...what an unfashionable Fellow art thou, || 
that is this Age art given to understand Latin? | 

Bruce . ^Tis true, Longvil, I am a bo^d Fellow to jl 

pretend to it, whe*n *tis accounted Pedantry for a || 

Gentleman to spell.... | 

Longvil .the best of ’em, now^ have a kind of 'j 

Education like Pages;... 

Bruce . Some are first instructed by Ignorant-young I'l 
houshold-Pedants, who dare not whip the Dunces their | 
Pupils, for fear of their Lady-Mothers: then, before 
they can Conster and Pearce, [construe and parse] , i 
they are sent into France, with sordid, illiterate i 
Creatures, call’d Dry’d-Nurses, or Governors; : 


’’The top of their Education [here speaks old f 

iii 

Snarl again] is to smatter French: for in France they have 


been to learn French Vices to spend English Estates with; 

with an insipid gaity, which is to be slight and bright, 

( 39 ) 

very pert and very dull.” 

But the most telling commentary (because the 


most casual and least noisy) on contemporary education is 
made by Lady Cheatly. Her friend Prig is to perform a

So much for the men. Shadwell does not leave 
the subject of women’s education quite untouched; we can 
draw some sort of picture from the information he gives us

custom of bringing up a girl to be a good wife;^-^Hhe 
fashionable London ideal seems to have been to produce a 
witty, brisk, gay woman who lived for pleasure. 

Mrs, Fantast has been brought up at Bury, and her 
mother describes her as a good specimen: 


Thou art in thy maturity of blooming Age; I have 
bred thee to the very Achme and Perfection of | 
Bury Breeding, which is inferiour to none in this | 
our Island; Dancing, Singing, Ghittar, French 
Master: And I’ll say that for thee, my Je?/el, thou 
has Sacrific’d all thy Endeavours to attain thy 
Education; which, corroborated by thy Acuteness 
of Parts, have render’d thee exactly accomplish’d, 
and together with the excellence of thy Beauty, 
justly admir’d by the Amorous Males, and envy’d 
by the malicious Females.

The last two clauses evidently express the end and aim of 
this sort of education, Shadwell is, of coursej smiling 
at such an ideal. In fact 3 the non-Bury people in this 
plays ( Bury~Bair ) , particularly I/ildishj make ’’Bury 
Breeding” the subject of many sharp critical remarks. The 
rest of the conversation is so much to the point that I 
quote further: 


Mrs. Bantast . To all that, which the "lorld calls 
77it and Breeding, I have always had a natural 
tendency, a r enchen , deriv’d, as the Learned say, 
Ex traduce , from your Ladyship: Besides the great 
Prevalence of your Ladyship’s most shining 
Example, has perpetually Stimulated me, to the 
Sacrificing all my Endeavours towards the attain¬ 
ing of those inestimable Jewels, than which , 
nothing in the Universe can be so much a mon ^-re 
as the French say,.., 

Lady Fantast , ...thou has those Attractions, 
which I bewail the want of: Poetry, Latin, and 
the French Tongue, 

Mrs, Fantast , 1 must confess, I have ever had a 
Tendress for the Muses, and have a due reverence 
for Helicon . and Parnassus and the Graces: but 
Heroic Numbers upon Love and Honour, are most 
Ravissant, most Suprenant; and a Tragedy is so 
TouQ^^ytl I dye at a Tragedy; I’ll swear I 


Mrs, Fantast’s step-sister, Gertrude, has a some¬ 
what different idea of ’’breeding”: 


Breedingl I know no breeding necessary, but 
Discretion to distinguish Company and Occasions, 
and Common Sence, to entertain Persons according 
to their Rank, besides making a Courtesie not 
awkwardly, and walking with one’s Toes out. 


(4E) ibid .. IV, 312.

She objects to larding one^s conversation with scraps 

of French, but is answered with saY»rs: 

Lady Fantast . Nothing is so Confident as 
Ignorance. 

Mrs. Fantast . Ars non habet Inimicum praeter 
Ignorantem. 

Lady Fantast . Look you there: I have bred my 
Daughter a Linguist. 

Gertrude, however, defends herself with spirit: 

A Lady may look after the affairs of a Family, ; 
the demeanour of her Servants, take care of her 
Nursery, take all her Accounts every Week, obey 
her Husband, and discharge all the Offices of a 
good Wife with her Native Tongue; and this is all ^ 
I desire to arrive at; and this is to be of some ^ 
use in a Generation, while your Fantastick Lady “ 
with all those Trappings and Ornaments you speak ^ 
of, is good for no more than a Dancing Mare, to I 
be led about and shown. 

I suspect that the normal Englishwoman, say of 
John Evelyn's class, was very like Gertrude, Mrs. Fantast, 
on the other hand, and her ''Bury Breeding", is a caricature 
of the London woman of fashion and her London breeding. 

The two are combined to som.e extent in Mrs. Fepys'. She 
took lessons in singing, dancing, and drawing, and at 
various times had masters for the "viall" and flageolet. 

She learned arithmetic after her marriage, and kept the 
household accounts (not to her husband's satisfaction). 
Latin, as far as I can find out, was a very unusual

acquirement in Y/omen. Mrs. Fantast knew enough to quote 
a few tags; hut a woman like John Evelyn’s daughter 
Mary, who took pleasure in reading ’’Terence, Plautus, 
Homer, Virgil, Horace, Cvid” ^ was clearly a prodigy. 

Shadwell does not specifically mention that 
girls were taught to read and write, hut it is implicit 
in most of his descriptions of upper-class women. In fact, 
his women often do read, chiefly hillets-doux, Teresia, 
and Isabella, in The Squire of Alsatia , read a hook of 
poems. They have, too, a ’’Go^iernante”, whose business in 
the play is to try to shield them from the ?/icked world; 
hut she had doubtless, when they were younger, taught 
them reading, writing, needlework, and perhaps ’’accounts”. 
Another governess is the poor doY^n-trodden Priscilla, in 
The Scowrers . 

It is evident from these examples that there 
Y/as no general standard of women’s education, even within 
one class of society. Women were in this respect, as in 
most others, even more at the mercy of their parents’ 
whims than men.

happy Surprize.” V/ildish replies in kind:”My dear Bellamy’. 
My dear Peer! I cou’d not embrace a Mistress with more

Kissing was common in all classes, even between 

men and women. We find Wildish, after being introduced 

and paying a compliment, kissing Gertrude with the words: 

”0h, that this Kiss wou’d last to Eternityl”^and even 

among the ’’citizens” at Epsom, when Bisket and Eribble 

foolishly prate of their wives’ attractions, Bisket remarks, 

”Has not my Lamb a rare way of kissing?”^^ 

Introductions seem to have been short and simple. 

Eribble . These are my Friends, Gentlemen, an

they salute, (i.e. kiss) her.]

The remark about keeping a player leads to a , 

i 

subject that can be treated here as conveniently as any¬ 
where else -- sexual morality. The age was one of licence, :! 
and yet, as manj?- writers have pointed out, the plays give a i 
somewhat distorted picture. They were written, after all, i 
for a comparatively limited audience, the fashionable ^ 

court circle of London. It is true that the citizens and i 
apprentices frequented the play-house, but it was not their I 


approval that the ^^poet’^ sought, nor their censure that he 
(60) 


dreaded,' 'And, to judge from the history of the period, 
especially in such accounts as those of Fepys and Evelyn, 
the Restoration comedies do reflect the morals of the 
people whom they were intended to amuse. Or, to put it 
moderately, immorality was so prevalent that a cool 
acceptance and open discussion of it in a play passed with- j 
out particular notice from the audience for whom the play l| 
was written. 

With this in mind, we may examine some of the 
passages in Shadwell, First, some opinions of marriage: 


Theodore, 


..with this Isabella I am uiireasonablyji 


and desperately in Love. 

Rant . But it’s in an honourable way, I hope, not 
at all inclining to wedlock, 

Theodore, Yes faith, I am in love, even to 


(60) Sir Positive-At-All (see Chapter V) dispute the right 
of two clerks to criticize his plays. 























Matrimony. 

Hazard, Pox on thee for an unseasonable Fellow, 
to think of Matrimony in this age, when an 
honest Woman is almost ashamed to shew her Face, 
she finds triumphant Punk so much preferred 
before her.^^^^ 

Earlier in the same scene, the two gamesters, 
Hazard and Rant, describe Isabella as '^a delicate bit for 
him that can get her, she^s fit for one of us honest 
Fellows to debauch, and for a dull rich Fellow (born to 

(02} 

drudgery of Plowing Land and getting Heirs) to Marry. ^ 

Another piece of dialogue, which must have 

amused the audience, follows. It is a vivid commentary 

on the age in general and on King Charles in particular 

that the play ( E'csom-Wells ) was extremely popular; so ; 

much so that Charles not only went to see it on the second 

and fourth of December, 1872, but had it performed at 

TJhitehall on the 27th, during the Christmas revels. 

Rains, Marriage is the worst of Prisons. I

be a Prison, yet you may make the Rules as

His Majesty was one of those who did not allov7 the ’^Rules” 
of the '^ecclesiastical mouse-trap” to confine him in his 
quest for pleasure, 

”A Wife is hut a foyle to a Mistriss this is

the fashionable opinion”; ”there is no such thing as 

scandal in this Age. Infamy is almost as hard to get as 

( 65 ) 

preferment”; "pkeeping;;. is] no dishonour, custom has 
made it otherwise”;' such expressions are common through¬ 
out the plays. More amusing is the reductio ad absurdum 
which we find in The Y/oman-Gap tain . Sir Christopher H?/ash, 
”desirous to be thought a mad Fellow”, becomes suspicious 
that his mistress is untrue to him; ”but I care not”, he 
says, ”for the Devil take me, I drink too much to be a man 

at Arms.[i.e., to challenge his rival] Gad! I only keep her 

(67) 

for the' lewdness of the matter.” 

The men were not the only offenders. Shadwell^s 
plays have a number of Vt/omen of various classes who have 
been unfaithful to their husbands. Major General Blunt

comforts the disillusioned Hackwell with the observation: 
^^Cuckoldom is no dishonour in our Country”. ^ Theodore 
describes his lady-love as possessing ”DamnM unfashionable 
qualities, callM vertue, and modesty^And the list 
might be extended almost indefinitely. 

I should like to think that Shadwell, in the 
next passage, was exaggerating the state of affairs: 

Bawd . I have no less than three Maiden-heads 
upon my hands, I have agreed with their Mothers, 
who truly are careful honest Parents, and love 
to provide for their Children with a Motherly 
affection. I shall have ^em cheap, considering 
the rarity of Maiden-heads in this Town,^^^^ 

This play, bristling ¥ath lines of that kind, ?/as produced 

”with great applause”. Books like . . .. of 

Charles II , (by Arthur Bryant), tell us, in effect, that 

the heart of the country was sound. Perhaps so, but the 

heart of Shadwell*s audience was not, if they could applaud 

sentiments of that sort. It may be argued, and I suppose 

truly, that Shadwell was writing satirically, but for the 

satire to have any point, sorae such conditions as these 

implied in the last quotation must have existed. His plays 

are full of lewd women (to say nothing of the men). In the 

Dramatis Personae of his thirteen comedies I have counted 


(68) Shadwell , V, 223 ( The Yolunteers ) 

(69) ibid .. II, 22 ( The Miser ) 

(70) ibid ., IV, 24 ( The Woman-Gaotain ) 






























the following among the named parts: Nine common prosti¬ 
tutes, ten kept women, and three procuresses. Many more 
are merely alluded to in the dialogue. ^ 

The subject of the control of sexual vice has 
been treated in an earlier chapter, but it may be remarked 
here that all such efforts must have had more than a tinge 

of hypocrisy when the '"brave Magistrates... commit Adultery 

(72) 

themselves, and ?»;hip poor Wenches for simple Fornication,"" 
and ¥Jhen the King and the great nobles and ministers of 
state openly kept mistresses and owned their bastard 
children without shame. 


In reading the plays one would almost tend to 
forget, if it were not for the fifth act, that people did 
occasionally marry in the seventeenth century. The 
marriage-settlement was all-important; marriage was 
essentially a contract. The heroes of the plays do, it is 
true, express passionate love for the heroines, but on a 
review of the whole situation, one is left with the feeling 


(71) Granting for the sake of argument that Shadwell was, |> 

as he claimed, attempting to’ correct the vices of the age, I 
it' is interesting to compare his methods with those of " 

Addison and Steele, thirty-odd years later. See for 
example the serious examination of the means to a happy 
marriage in Spectator 261, (Addison), and Steele^s affecting!: 
account of prostitution, Spectator 266. ' 

(72) Shadwell , TV, 25. ( TK<- 




















that affection between husband and wife was largely a 
matter of luck. The great thing was to match tuo fortunes 
— to join two good ones, or else to mend a poor one by 
joining it to a better. Shadwell does not represent a 
a single happily married couple; his nearest approach is in 
Major General Blunt^s remark, ’^V/ell, this is my Birth-day. 
And my Wedding Day, that joyn’d me to the best of Women, 
rest her Soul'A^*^^^ 

But making love was another story. Half the men 
in Shadwell’s plays spend their time either in getting 
ready (dressing and titivating) for what they call ^’an 
amorous adventure”, or in going out to seek it, or in 
telling their friends all about it. Others go to the 
ladies’ homes to pay their court. Some of Shadwell’s most 
amusing passages deal with the various methods and fashions 
in love-making. So Stanmore explains the new styles to 
Bellamour, who has been spending some time in the country. 
They have been talking of ”one of the finest Women in 
England.” 

Stanmore . ...one Lord made Coaches at her, 
another squeezed in his fat sides at her, till 
he looked like a full sack; a third writ 
lamentable Sonnets to her; a fourth observed her

new method of making Love. 

Bellamour . PTaat, do they make Love without 
speaking to one another?

let down hastily, VYhen the party goes by, is 
very passionate; if she side glass you again, 
for that’s the new word, ply her next day with a 
billet doux and you have her sure. 

Bellamour. What if we chance to go the same 


way, or she Y/on’t receive my billet doux , as you 
call it? 


Stanmore. For the first it must never chance; 


you must instruct your Coachman, and for the 
second after such an advance as side-glassing of 
you, if she refuse your Billet she is a Jilt, and 
you must rail at her in all Companies. 


I had forgotten half; you must turn as she 
turns; quit the Park when she goes out, pass^by 
her twice or thrice betY/een that and St. Jame’s; 
talk to her at night in the drawing Room -- 
Bellamour. Before forty Coxcombs, and then 
the business i^^|yfficiently proclaimed, is it 


not think you? 

Carlos, in the same play, aspires to Theodosia’s hand; she 
is a high-spirited girl, and takes a delight in plaguing 
him. She instructs him hoY»r to behave if he is to win her 
favour; he is to be poetical, and make her ’’Songs and 
Sonnets plent^r^’; he must never go to a play unless she 
goes too; he must not go behind the scenes at the pla^/'- 
house; and he must not ’’talk with Vizors in the Pit”. 
Further, he is to make all women in love Y/ith him. tiany of 


the beaux considered this last point of the first importance,

Perhaps the most ridiculous fad was '^platonic 

love^’, Shadwell gives one example j also in Bury~Fair , 

Ilrs, Fantast has an admirer, Trim, whom she calls Eugenius; 

he calls her Eorind-a. He visits her daily, and is deeply 

hurt when ''Hfildish gently rallies him; he protests that his 

intentions are strictly honourable and dispassionate. He 

'meetiE his Dorinda at the Fair:

can feel the warm effects, d/hy shouM Dorinda 
think to blunt her pointed Glories, or conceal ' 
the Radiant Lustre of her convening Beams?

Eugenius, nothing is obscure. Nor cou’d 
Eugenius in the Dark be hid; that golden Tongue, ; 
and that s7/eet Eloquence would soon reveal him; i

1 

Love-making was a weighty matter in Shadwell’s London. j 

Tempers were quick, and, as a gentleman always | 
wore a sword, duels were frequent. 



All Shadwell’s ladies and gentlemen are well 
supplied with servants, some of whom always attend them 
when they go out. This makes it possible for Longvil, in 
The Virtuoso, to take Sir Samuel Hearty with him as his

This survey of the manners and morals of 
Shadwell’s London brings out several points of interest. 

It shows,'' for one thing, (what was undoubtedly a fact), a 
comparatively large section of the upper classes who 
devoted their whole time to pleasure, particularly sensual 
enjo^mients; and it gives a rather full account of the methods 
in vogue of pursuing and winning a woman^s favour. It 
enumerates a fern contrasts between the social intercourse of 
that time and ours. It gives some idea of hoY^r deep an 
impression the education of the day made on those exposed to 
it; and it states a few facts about the real people under¬ 
neath this somehYmt artificial surface of society — the 
servants. 









3. Food and drink. 


66. 


Three things are particularly noticeable in 
Shadwell^s references to food and drink: the quantity, the 
variety, and the preponderance of meat. 

He does not mention breakfast directly; we may 
gather from Pepys that it was not a regular meal. His 
breakfasts, when he mentions them, vary widely. At Bowe, 
he has eggs;at various other times, a cup of beer, a pot 
of chocolate, and jn one occasion, wine, anchovies, and 
pickled oysters. Frequently a morning draught taken either 
at home or in a tavern was a gentleman^s only breakfast. 
Tope, the drinker, in The Scowrers , may be referring to 
breakfasts when he replies to Sir William Rant’s invitation 
to drink a health: defy mornings Draughts, besides 

Spirits will bring you from two pounds of Beef, to two 
poatch’d Eggs, trust an experienc’d Drunkard, thou will not

live out half thy days, if thou tak’st these lewd courses 

( 2 ) 


of drinking in a Morning.” 


(1) having left home at seven o’clock. (August 18, 1662). 
He is often up by four, and goes to the office soon after. 
The following entry is of some interest here: (September 3, 
1662) ”Up betimes, but now the days begin to shorten, and 
so whereas I used to rise by four o’clock, it is not broad 
daylight now till after five o’clock, so that it is after 
fis® before I do rise. To my office, and about 8 o’clock 

I went over to Redriffe...”

Water was used very little as a drink which was 


perhaps a good thing, considering that many of the London 
houses still had their private wells. Wine and beer were 
the ordinary beverages. Gripe, in The Woman-Captain . is 


explaining his housekeeping to his new servant, Richard, 


Richard asks; 


Must we never have any Wine or strong ~~ Beer-=*: 
Gripe . l^Wiyl you Impudent fellow, would you have 
us dye of Reavers? To drink Wine shall be 
Treason, and strong Beer Relony without Clergy: 

I have wholsom very, very small Beer, so clear, 
so fine, the Mault not to be tasted irW t — The 
Patriarchs drank nothing but Water. . . 

Richard . That I deny, ask Lot else,^'^' 


Beer was regularly taken with meals. Sir Humphrey Noddy 
describes how, when he was telling a very funny story at the 
dinner-table, "There was such a Laughing, they Roared out 
again: The Ladies Tyhee’d under their Napkins”, and finally | 
the "Tyhee” took ”a reverend old Gentlewoman as she V 7 as a 


Drinking, and she squirted out the Beer of her Nose, as an 

( 5 ) 


Indian does Tobacco.” 

"Langoon” and "Burdeaux” are the wines suggested 
by Sir Humphrey Scattergood^s steward, but his master will 
have none of them:

Sir Humphrey . Porters and Carriers shall drink 
that; 1^11 have Vin d’aye, high Country Wine, 
Frontiniac; all the delicious Wines of Italy and 
Spain; the richer Wines of Greece and Sicily, 
Bellamy . And Celery, dSilleTy} Champaign and 
Burgundy, with Vin de Bon, Vin Celestine, and 
Hermitage, and all the Wines upon the fruitful 
Rhine. 

Kick and Cuff, the night before the action of 
Eusom-Wells begins, have got drunk on claret. Rains and 

{ 7 ) 

Bevil have been drinking Burgundy. ^Drunkeness was so 

coiomon as to incur the grave censure of Evelyn; Men like 

Rains and Bevil did not care whether it was followed by ill 

effects or not: ”no distemper can trouble me that comes 

from so generous a Cause, as lusty Burgundy, and good 

( 8 ) 

Company.” But having themselves come off without serious 

consequences so far, they can make fun of Woodly: 

Rains . 0 Franck Woodly, ?/here wer't thou last 
night? you scap’d a bloody night on’t. 

Woodly. Faith Raines there is no scaping, a 
Coward may be kill’d as well as a brave man; I 
ran away from you but to little purpose. See how 
my hand shakes this Morning, 

Rains, 0 let me kiss that hand; he must be an 
illustrious Man ?/hose hand shakes at 22. 

Dinner was the important meal of the day for most 

people. Sir Nicholas Gimcrack invites Bruce and Longvil 

”to come to his house this fore-noon, to see the dissection

of* a little Animal, commonly called a Chichester Cock- 

Lobster; and afterwards to take a dish of meat, and discourse 

of the noble Operation, and to sport an Authour over a 

( 10 ) 

Glass of Wine.” Linner was served somewhere about noon, 

sometimes perhaps as late as two o’clock. Fepys often 

writes ”at noon dined at home”. He gives many accounts of 

dinners, both at his own home and elsewhere, 

At Mr, Oldwit’s dinner they serve rabbit, custard, 

( 12 ) 

woodcock, and goose. Ho doubt these are only a few of 
the items, for it was a large dinner. Gripe, the miser, 
orders "three Ribs of Mutton boil’d in a Pipkin for our 
Dinners; go, buy me a lean Breast --lean meat is whole- 
somest To Morrow is Bloly-day -- I will have four Ribs, 

and some Cabbage,” The ordinary diet of his servants is 
oatmeal and water. Mnite bread is never seen in his house; 
nothing but rye and barley bread. He allows Richard to 
get some onion or garlic to go with the mutton, and he has 
in the house- ”some Perkin Butter and Suffolk Cheese, fine 


(10) ibid,1^,310 (The Vhtuo^o) \ ; 

(11) Thus on March1652, ne has ”a pretty dinner ... 
viz., a brace of stewed carps, six roasted chickens, and a 
jowl of salmon, hot, for the first course; a tanzy 
[puddingl and two neats’ tongues, and cheese the second.” 
All this for himself, his wife, and four guests(with the 
remains doubtless going to the servants). But on Easter 
day following (March 30) he mentions ohly ”a good shoulder 
of veal”.

Dinner was becoming an unfashionable meal, if we 

are to judge by the plays; and the people with money and 

leisure, to whom food meant not sustenance, but merel^n- i|' 

jopiient preferred suppers, served at varying hours. ”I A 

hate a Dinner”, says Carlos, ”’tis a good meal for a dull j| 

plodding Fellow of business that must bait like a Carriers i 

Horse, and then to plodding again; but the Supper is the I 

meal of pleasure and enjoyment.” His friends agree: I 

Stanmore . Supping indeed is a solemn thing, and 
should be used but with few, every Blockhead 
can Dine.

few men fit to Sup, there’s more then eating I

That is obviously a sop to the people of fashion, Wildish, I 
in Bury-Fair , is such a man of fashion; he invites Trim to || 
supper. Shadwell thus gives himself an opportunity for a 1 
dig at country manners: | 


Wildish. Come, you and I’ll sup together, and be 
merry; and two or three Bottles will make you 
freer, and more open-hearted. 

Trim. I never Sup: We of the better Rank never 
Sup, at Bury.

Then Plover, Dotril Snipes, Ruffs, Woodcocks . . Partridges. 
Gnats, Godwits . . . Pheasants, heath-Pouts, Black-Cocks, , 
Quails, Rails, Larks, &c.” . ^Possibly James was merely 

trying to twit his master. This collation does not come to 
pass, but when the company arrives, the miser^s son, l| 

Theodore, announces that he has ordered '^a great Dish of | 
China Oranges, Cittrons, all sorts of Sweet-meats, Limonade^-

III, Scenel of Moli^re^s L’Avare: The list of foods is

of Moli^re’s ”quatre grands potages.” 

(IV) Ibid ., p.61. 




























71 


Scattergood, knowing that Gripe will have nothing in the 


(18)1 


house, sends a collation when he intends visiting there. 

Apart from these accounts of the meals themselves 
we find in the plays various lists of articles of food. 

Part of Sir Humphrey Scattergood’s long tale of extravagant 
delicacies is quoted in the appendix to Chapter V. One of 
his friends concludes it with ’’Then Virmieelti, Potato and 
Tartonphily, [trufflesj , and flatulent Roots to stir up and

”I should have taken these hard Herds for conjuring, but

We have seen that Pepys drank chocolate; the

coffee-house wras well established; and tea had come in 

as a fashionable drink, Pepys has a famous entry under 

date of September 25, 1660: "And afterwards I did send for 

a cup of tee (a China drink) of which I never had drank 

before." Most of Shadv^ell’s references to tea are slightljr 

disparaging. It was first offered for public sale about

sensitive; but smoking in a lady*s presence long remained f

j 

indeed of tea and coffee, was greatly insisted upon in the 
seventeenth century.

4. Amusements, 


7G, 


If Siiadwell had chosen to write about the working 


classes^ there virould be much less to say under this heading. j 

( 1 ) 


As Besant points outj the Puritan prohibition of Sunday 
games meant their prohibition altogether for the workers. 

It is impossible with the material available, to 
classify and give the history of all the games and recrea¬ 
tions that Shadwell mentions, and it would be outside the 
scope of this thesis; I shall merely try to givie a general ■ 
impression of the amusements of Shadwell^s London, 

The most spectacular of was the theatre, 

¥;hich is discussed in Chapter Y. Other entertainments of 
the same sort were those given by jugglers, rope-dancers, 
fire-eaters, and clowns. Sir Positive At-All, ¥7ith his 
breath-taking versatility, numbers ’"leger-de-main”, rope- 
dancing, and fire-eating among his accomplishments. Thus 
for instance, when Roger, the servant, mentions Jacob Hall, | 

iii 

he asserts: ’’Honest Roger! How the Devil cou’dst thou find | 


me 


out in that, Jacob Hall has told thee, has he not? I 


thou^t he would ha’ kept that to himself; but I taught 

( 2 )

The Monster is just now beginning^’. Bartholomew Eair, in 
Londonj would provide spectacles of the same kind; 

Shadwell does not refer to it directly, Emilia, when 
alsked by Lady Vaine to go and see a play, replies scorn¬ 
fully: tell.-you, I had as live . £lievej stand among the

The fairs were patronized chiefly by the common 
people, and indeed formed one of their chief entertainments, 
"Jhen '’society'^ attended, it was as a frolic, Mrs. Fantast

and Gertrude put on masks to go to the fair at Bury. 

Cock-fighting appears to have been considered a 
gentlemen^s pastime. Frig goes in for it a good deal. He 
asks Lady Cheatly to hasten their wedding, ’^because I am to 
go to New-market to a Cock-Match: I have lay'd fifty pound 
upon Jack-an-^pes, against Tom Frigg's Bozen Beak; my Dun

Horse-racingj especially at Newmarket, Stamford l 

^ i 

and Brackley, gained a great vogue in this period, partly, j 
no doubt, through the patronage of Charles II, who himself | 
kept race-horses. ^This is hinted at in Frig’s proposal jj 
of marriage to Lady Cheatly, which ran in part:'’As I have ^ 
told you before, my Estate is not inconsiderable, besides I 
the great Favour I have v/ith the G-amcing and Jocky Lords; 
and besides, if the King frequents New-Market, I doubt not 
but in short time to Rise.”^^^Frig evidently rode himself; 
since meeting Lady Cheatly, he has not had '’the heart to 
ride so much as one heat at NeW'^Aarket”• ^^^Racing is in his \ 

i 

blood. lie knows all the animals’ pedigrees; and he invites I 
his friends to come and see ’’the best horse in England”, to 
whom he is going to pay ”a civil Visit. He’s to run for the! 
ilaoe at .brackley, utamford, and Nei’?market, and goes out of I 

(1 n ^ I 

Town to Morrow.”' ^ I 

Bear-baiting was still popular, especially among I 

I 

the tradesmen and populace. When Carlos is wounded in the | 
hand during a scuffle in the play-house, Theodosia mocks 
him with the words: ’’Here’s a doe about a slight Hurt; a • ; 

(7) He even had a house built at Newmarket; Evelyn did not 
think much of it: ’’the arches of the cellars beneath are j 
well turned by Mr. Samuel, the architect, the rest mean I 

enough, and hardly fit for a hunting-houseV (July 2S, 1670) *

A Bisk is an advantage, or odds. Gibbons’s was the Tennis 
Court in Mere Street, used as a theatre by Iiilligrew’s 
company from 1660 to 1663. None of the gentry in Shadwell’slj 


plays appear to play bowls except Prig, who ’’has nothing 

(15) 

but Tennis Courts and Bowling-Greens in his Head.” 


Bisket, the comfit-maker, and Fribble, the haberdasher, 
play bowls at Epsom with the two bullies. Kick and Cuff. 
They are heard off-stage: ”A noise within of rub, rub, 


narrow, short, gone a thousand yards, and such like words 
(16) 

of Bo¥/lers.” 


Other games mentioned of the same general kind 
are trap-ball, stool-ball, shuttlecock, and cat (otherv/ise 
tip-cat) . 

Half the object of all these games and sports 
seems to have been betting. Prig bets on his horse-races.

frequently part of an evening* s entertainment. Sir liumphrey \ 

Noddy and Lord Bellamy try to get up a raffle among the | 

ladies at Bury Fair, with the fee a guinea apiece. I 

Lotteries were held at court, with the King and Queen takingj 

part, Evelyn "gained a trifle" by subscribing to a lottery Ih 

(17) 

set up by Sir Arthur Slingsb^^, Gambling was also a regu¬ 
lar part of indoor games of cards and the like, to which 
v/e must now turn. Most of those played by Shadwell*s 
characters have been completely forgotten, but the names of 
a fe?/ are recognizable. One — cribbage survives, 
langtrilloo (or loo), ombre, and piquet, are familiar hy 
name to readers of Jane Austen, Pope, and Dickens respec¬ 
tively, Basset, comet, gleek, crimp,and primero, are un¬ 
known except to the student of the subject. 

Trick-track, or tables, was a complicated form of 
backgammon. 

Although people gambled at all these games, it 
was at dice that the really high play took place. Gaming 
was entirely unrestricted. One of the most fashionable 
houses ¥iras Speiring*s. In the second act of The Sullen

for gaming was at courts at the Groom Porter^s« The office 
of Groom Porter was one which had gradually acme to com- 
prehend the regulation of gaming in the precincts of the 
court. It was abolished under George III, Evelyn 
disapproved when the King, on January 6, 1661-»62, formally 
'^opened the revels of that night by throwing the dice him¬

amongst 6oTne losers; sorry am I that such a wretched custom 
as play to that excess should be countenanced in a Court ., 
Pepys also gives a very full account of the play there 
(January 1, 1667-8). Shadwell has a number of references.

Groom Porters, will get thee as good a Mistress as any I

Dances were a means of brightening an otherwise 

dull play; and, although most of his plays v/ere extremely 

successful, Shadwell loses no opportunity of introducing 

a dance,^ The Humorists was^indeed^saved from failure by 

the dancing of Mrs. Johnson, Shadwell says that '’it met 

with the clamorous opposition of a numerous party, bandied 

against it, and resolved, as much as they could, to damn it, 

right or wrong, before they had heard or seen a word on’t ,,

The dances mentioned in the plays are the Minuet ( a new 

importation from France) ^ Bourree, and '^contra-danse^M 

() 

'The reference to »»an Italian EunuclM» indicates 
what is well known, that soprano parts in Italian opera 
were sung by adult male sporanos, brought from Italy for 
the purpose. 

Shadv/ell refers to four composers: Berkenshaw, 
Lock, Banister, all Englishmen, and John Baptist ^Draghi] , 
an Italian, 

The type of music played is suggested in one or 
two passages. The two beaux,in The Volunteers set up for 
critics; 

(Enter Musick, they play and sing 
Sir Nicholas . Ah, that’s fine, that’s Chromatick 
I love Ghromatick Musick mightily. 

Sir Timothy , Ah that Fugel That Fuge’s finely 
taken.

Sir Positive At-All is himself a composer. He comes 

bursting in upon Stanford with: ”Ah Dear Jackl Have I

pounds: I have made this morning a glorious Corrant, an 

immortal Corrant, a Corrant with a Soul in’t; [Courante,

Uompass, La, la, la, (Sec." Woodcock, in the same play, 

plays the violin, "which he us'd so barbarously, I was 

(29) 

ready to take it for a Bag-pipe"; and it will be 

remembered that Pepys played the lute or the^orbo, and his 

wife the "viall" and "flageolet". Mrs. Fantast has learned 

the "Ghittar". Goldingham looks upon it as an advantage 

(because of economy) that his prospective wife hates 

" . . .Harpsical-Masters above measure".^ 

The words of the songs were sometimes classical 

and sometimes original. y 0 ung Beifond's music master, in 

The Bciuire of Alsatia , has set Horace's ode Integer Vitae . 

and his friend Truman sings it. More often, perhaps, the 

words were "diversions..of the pen" (to use Mrs. Fantast's 

phrase) of some'lady or gentleman. Prig, despising the 

convential pastoral imagery, writes a hunting song: 

Key ho, hey ho,

clownish, ugly, tawny, Sun-burnt People; I had e'en as

The coffee-houses were much in use to while away 

an idle hour. The first one in London was opened in 1652 

by a Turk; and already in his first play (1668), Shadwell 

alludes to the political discussions in the coffee-houses: 

The other day, being tyr'd almost to death with 
the 

Impertinence of Popps that importun’d me; 

For Variety, I ventur’d into a Coffee-house; 

There 1 found a Company of formal Starch’d 
Fellows 

Talking Gravely, Wisely, and nothing to the 
purpose; 

And with undaunted Impudence discoursing of the 
Right,of Empires; the Management of Peace and War 
And the great Intrigues of Councils; when o’my 
Conscience you wou’d have sooner took ’em for 
Tooth-Dra’wers then Privy-Counsellors. 

The ^YiTits’ Coffee-house” mentioned in The 


Volunteers is the famous Will’s, which by that time 
(1692) had acquired its particular group of clients.

of news. ^’But pray G-entlemen’’, asks Sir Humphrey Maggot, I-

House to Coffee-House all day on purpose^They received ■ 
the pa|)ers, of v/hich Shadwell names (besides the general j 
term ’’News-letters”) only the Gazette , and which the clientsH 


might read as they sat sipping their coffee. So common Was i 
the practice that Shadwell in 1671 could make this simile: 
”Thou art as dull and dumpish as a fellow that had been 
drunM over night ?/ith Ale, and had done nothing but drunk 
ooife^ talked loliticks, and read Gazettes all this morning?

the term '’low comedy”; and while he did at times bring in

Bur.y-Fair , and the procuresses and prostitutes in almost

SHADVffiLL’S THEATRE 


"There are two admirable Playes at both Houses" 

( The Sullen Loveis ) 


study 

One chapter of this/is not too much to devote 
to Shadwell’s theatre. More than any other dramatic 
writer of the time, he has, by allusion, suggestion, and 
direct statement, painted for us a remarkably full and 
valuable picture of the drama in the last third of 
the seventeenth century — a picture that gives not only 
general features, but also innumerable physical details. 
He shows us the continued protests of the Puritans 
against stage-plays; that new phenomenon, the actress; 
the liking for opera and gorgeous spectacles; the 
popularity of the rhymed heroic play; and particularly, 
perhaps most important of all, he gives us a lively view 
of an audience, which has been a great deal of use to 
modern students of the drama. 

The return of Charles II in 1660 meant much 
more than merely the restoration of monarchy; it meant 
the official restoration of practically everything that

the Puritan regime had tried to suppress. The stage 
stood very close to prelacy and monarchy among the 
aversions of the Parliament men; and, like prelacy and 
monarchy, the stage took on a new lease of life when 
the King came back. 


Not that enmity to the theatre suddenly sprang 
into being under the Commonwealth. Ever since the 
establishment of the secular drama, in the last quarter 
of the sixteenth century, men like Gosson and Stubbs and 
Prynne^^' had poured forth condemnations of theatre and 
costumes, music and dancing, actors and audiences, play¬ 
wrights and composers. Nor did attacks stop with the 
Restoration, As late as 1698 appeared Jeremy Collier’s 
A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the 

English Stage ; and Shadwell’s Lump, in A True Widow , is 
a Puritan with an almost superstitious horror of the 
theatre: 


I say, ’tis not lawful, ’tis sinful, ’tis 
abominable, to come under the Roof with these 
Hornets; there is Wit, flashy W:^, stirrings ^ 
here; and I would as soon be in/rest-house. ^

In 1656 Davenant began his "opera", a legalized sort of

old theatres. 




The plays were at first given in various places, 

such as tennis-courts and the Cockpit; the Duke^s company 

played from 1661 to 1671 in the Duke^s Theatre in Lincoln's 

Inn Fields; in 1671 the second Duke’s Theatre was opened 

in Dorset Garden. The King’s men occupied the Theatre- 

Royal in Bridges-Street from 1663 to 1672, when it was 

burnt down. They moved to Lincoln’s Inn Fields until 

their new house in Drury Lane was built, 1674; and from 

that time until past the end of our period, Drury Lane 

and Dorset Garden remained the two principal theatres in 

London. Shadwell’s first three plays were produced at 

Lincoln’s Inn Fields by the Duke’s company; his fourth. 

The Miser , at the Theatre-Royal in Bridges-Street; the 

next nine at Dorset Garden; and the last five at Drury 

is) 

Lane. 

Shadwell makes only one reference to a particular 

theatre: in A True Ifidow , Selfish mentions having driven 

"" / 6 V 

With a pretty girl from the Duke’s Tlayhouse to Lell-Mell. ^ 

Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the 

Restoration Theatre was the arrival of the actress. 

( 5) See Shadwell . I, ccliii-ccliv, and Summers’s 
TheatricaT History printed before each play. 

(6) Shadwell, III, 293. No doubt he means Dorset Garden, 

A True idow havin^ been written 1678. 






















The first woman known to have acted on the English public 
stage (not counting court masques, which were private) 
was Mrs. Coleman, who appeared in Davenant’s "opera''. The 
Siege of Rhodes , in 1656. Pepys first saw a woman on the 
stage January 3, 1660-61. Years before Shadwell's first 
play appeared (1668), actresses had come to be taken for 
granted. In fact, he himself married an actress, Anne 
Gibbs, who acted in at least one of his plays after their 
marriage. 


Although women probably acted female parts much 
better than boys had done, some people regretted the 
change. Uncle Snarl, in The Virtuoso , is one of them; he 
refuses to attend plays now: 

I am not such a Coxcomb, I thank God: I have 
seen 'em at Black-Eryers :nox. they act like 
Poppets now in sadness, I, that have seen 
Joseph Taylor ,and Lowen, and Swanstead : Oh a 
brave roaring Eellowl would make the house shake 
again. Besides, I can never endure to see 
Plays since Women came on the Stage, Boys are 
better by half. ( 5 

We find another criticism of actresses in A True Widow : 

Carlos , Some of 'em are so far from having 
Wit of their own, that they spoyl that little 
the Poets put into 'em by base' utterance.^® ' 





'i! 

..Lli:

(8 ) ibid. . p.330. 




























Shadwell spoke from bitter experience, for the cast 
had helped to spoil his comedy The Humorists by being 
^'extreamly imperfect in the Action of it.^»^^ ^ 

The character of most of the actresses is too 
well known to need much comment here. The names of Nell 
Gwyn and krs. Barry occur to one as illustrations of 
women who combined great histrionic talents with vice. 
According to Satyr upon the Flayers (1683)and 
Buckingham’s A tryal of the Poets for the Baves .^^^Tlrs. 
Shadwell was not much better; unfortunately, these are 
satires, and no certain conclusions can be drawn from 
the opinions they express. 

Although Shadwell, as one v/ho had married an 
actress, and who depended upon actresses to play his parts

Longvil . Dear Madam! tender the life and

Miranda . IThat, a fashionable Gentleman of this 
Age, and a Lover! it is impossible! They are 
all Keepers, and transplant tawdry things from !

them. as the worst acted plays he had ever seen. Shadwell 

suggests not only that the action was poor, but that the || 

plays themselves were amateurish to the last degree: 

...... comes the Bell-man | 

And in a dismal Tone repeats ?/orse Rhymes, . ' 

Than a Poet of the Nursery can rnake;'-^^^ 

There is another link between Shadwell and 

the Nursery, for it is the scene of his enthronement in 

MacFlecknoe . Dryden describes it as follows: 

Near these a Nursery erects its head, 

‘jThere queens are formM, and future heroes bred; 
'^ere unfledg’d actors learn to laugh and cry, 
Waere infant punks their tender voices try, 

And little Maximins the Gods defy, 

The Nursery, Dryden contemptuously implies, ' 

is the place for plays like Shadwell’s. 

The theatrical repertory of 1660 consisted 

mainly, as one might have expected, of revivals. Jonson, J 

and Beaumont and Fletcher, seem to have been the |: 

favourites, but plays by Brome, Heywood, Middleton, jj 

( 18 ) '' 

Shirley, and Shakespeare, were also used. 'Shakespeare’s j! 

f'- 

tragedies, it should be said in passing, were freely 
adapted. But the theatres were not long confined to h:

revivals of old plays. Davenant, Cowley, Flecknoe, 

and Killigrew, were the first Restoration dramatists of 

any importance; they had all been writing before 1660. 

Soon a flood of new plays, by men like Dryden, Etherege, 

and Howard, began to pour in, 

Shadwell overflows with praise of Jonson; as 

far/as I am aware, he has cur references to Shakespeace 

(19) 

in his comedies. Jonson was his idol. Prologues, 

Epilogues, Prefaces, and Dedications, and not least, the 

plays themselves, abound in references and allusions. 

(See Appendix to this chapter.) 

A type of play peculiar to the period, and one 

of Shadwell’s particular aversions, was the rhymed heroic 

tragedy. It flourished approximately from the Restoration 

( 20 ) 

to 1680. As Allardyce Nicoll points out, there were 
in the period rhymed plays not heroic, and there were 
later heroic plays without rhyme; but the rhymed heroic 
tragedy belongs to the Restoration period alone. 

Briefly, its characteristics are these: The 
scene is remote, preferably both in place and in time; 
the characters are endowed with superhuman virtue or 
ej. 

(19) A"I’le pluck bright Honour from the pale^fac’d Moon 
(as my Eriend Hot-Spur sayes) what do you think of that?” 
Shadwell , I, 79. ( The Sullen Lovers ); and p.53 in the 
same play.

villainy; great stirring events and the supernatural play 
a large part in the action. Dryden is the most consider¬ 
able of the heroic writers, and his admission of his 
weariness of this kind, In Aureng-Zebe (1675), marks the 
beginning of its decline. 

Shadwell never tired of expressing his scorn 
for '^Love and Honour plays'^ (as they were called after 
Davenant’s Love and Honour ). In the prologue to his-very 
first play. The Sullen Lovers , after explaining that his 
purpose is to expose fools, he sturdily continues, that 
he has: 

No kinde Romantick Lovers in his Play, 

To sigh and whine out passion, such as may 
Charm Waitingwomen with Heroick Chime, 

And still resolve to live and die in Rhime; 

Such as your Eares with Love, and Honour feast, 
And play at Crambo for three houres at least: 

That Fight, and wooe, in Verse in the same breath 
And make Similitudes, and Love in Death: 

In his preface to the same play, in the course of an 

eulogy on Jonson, he complains that '’most other Authors 

that I ever read, ... have wilde Romantick Tales wherein 

they strein Love and Honour to that Ridiculous height, 

( 22 ) 

that it becomes Burlesque”. Nor did he give over his 
attacks at the very end of his career. His posthumous

too. 


comedy, The Volunteers , affords some examples. His own 
prologue, which was not spoken when the play was performed, i 
glances at ''Towering Bombast", and the epilogue, "spoken ^ 
by one in deep mourning", claims that he ! 

i 

"never sunk in Prose nor soar'd in Verse,.^ v I 
So high as Bombast, or so low as Parce. l 

Again and again he ridicules the ranting of the ! 

"heroic poets". Bruce in The Virtuoso , is trying various 

ways of winning his lady; 

Bruce . Come, I see this way will not do: 

I'll try another with you. Ah, Madam', change 
your cruel intentions, or I shall become the 
most desolate Lover, that ever yet, with arms 
across, sigh'd to a murmuring Grove, or to a 
purling Stream complain'd. Savage', I'll 
wander up and down the Woods, and carve my 
passion on the Barks of Trees, and vent my 
grief to winds, that as they fly shall sigh and 
pity me. 

Glarinda . How now! what foolish Fustian's ^ 
this? you talk like an Heroick Poet.^^'^' i 

and a few lines later, Glarinda throws off this description:* 

... a dull Rhiming Play, with nothing ig't but j 
lewd Heroe's huffing against the Gods. 

The epilogue to the same play contains these lines: ‘ 

But of those Ladies he desjjairs to day. 

Who love a dull Romantick whining Play; 

^Hiere poor frail Woman's made a Deity, \ 

With sensless amorous Idolatry; I 

And sniveling Heroes sigh, and pine, and cryj

swoons. I

I|j| 

'’Serious Love is duller than a Rhyming Play”, 
says Gertrude; and virhen she finds, a minute later, that I 
she has two lovers who are yet good friends, she exclaims | 
sarcastically: ”So; here’s a fine Subject for a Love and I 
Honour Poetl”^^^^ J 

Most amusing of all, however, is the scene in | 

ir 

The Sullen Lovers , in ?^hich Sir Positive At-All challenges 

two clerks for presuming to criticise his heroic tragedy, 

The Lady in the Lobster . First he complains to Stanford: 

Sir, no man in England would put up this affront; 
Why look you, Sir, for him to sit in the Eighteen |!| 
pence Gallery, pray mark me, and rail at my Play lili 

alowd the first day, and did all that lay in his |l 

power to daima it: And let me tell you. Sir, if jl; 

in any Drammatick Poem there has been such i; 

breaks, such Characters, such Figures, such 
Images, such Heroick Patterns, such Heights, such j 
flights, such Intrigues, such Surprizes, such J 

Fire, Salt, and Flame, then I am no Judge: I 
understand nothing in this world. 


The first Clerk tries to defend himself: I; 

li 

Sir, I’le tell you, you had made a Lady in your ij] 
Play so unkind to her Lover (who methought was j 

a very honest well meaning Gentleman) to command ;! 
him to hang himself. Said I then that shall not ■'! 
pass, thinKing indeed the C^entleraan would not ;| 
have done it, but indeed did it, then said I, i

fy upon’t that he should be so much over-taken. 

After more argument, Sir Positive turns to Stanford, his 

second, and exclaims in despair; 

But Stanford , it vifould make an Authour mad to 
see the Invincible Ignorance of this age, nov/ 
for him to hang himself at the Command of his 
Mistress there’s the surprize, and I’le be 
content to hang my self, if ever that was shewn 
upon a stage before, besides ’twas an Heroick 
CatO “like Action, and there’s great Love and 
Honour to be shevm in a mans hanging himself 
for his Mistress, take that from me. 


For the sake of peace, the two clerks finally say yea and 
amen to all Sir Positive’s claims; and in satisfaction for 
the supposed insult, he makes them sign the following 

'li¬

Ylhat gave spice to the whole play was that, 
as everyone knew. Sir Positive At-All was a caricature of 
Sir Robert Howard, ’Hhat universal pretender”, as Evelyn 
calls him: 'His tragedies are The Indian-Queen . The 
Vestal-Vir^in , and The Great Favourite, Or, The Duke of 
Lerma » 

Shadwell has nothing to say in his plays about 
that other creation of the Restoration period, the comedy 
of manners; his own inclination led him towards the 
Jomsonian comedy of humours, and he defends his choice 
again and again. The most notable instances are in the 
prefaces to The Sullen Lovers and The Humorists. 

He tried his hand, however, at a (more or less) 

original tragedy, The Libertine , a pastoral, The Royal jj‘ 

tl; 

Shepherdesse . (which reflects the artificial pastoral fad ji 
of the time) , an adaptation of Shakespeai^s Timon of Athens! 
and two operas, Psyche , and The Tempest , which latter is 
an operatic version of Bryden and Davenant^s alteration of 
Sha ke spe ar e ’ s play. 

Operas, as I mentioned earlier, were first 
produced in England by Davenant in 1656, and remained^ 
popular throughout the century. One of the essential parts

of opera seems to have been the elaborate ''machines”. 

Ihey were of many kinds. Shadwell alludes especially to 

those that made flight possible. So, when Lady Cheatly, 

in the playhouse, wants to get rid of her brother Lump: 

(stage direction) "Lady Cheatly whistles, two mock-Devils 

descend and fly up with Lump.” 'a few moments later, 

(stage direction) "Prig and Young Maggot are carried up 

in their Chairs, and hang in the air.”^^^^Even hanging in 

the air, they make a nuisance of themselves, so the 

"Carpenter lets 'em down, and presently they sink down 

\i.e, through traps in the stage^Jand roar out",^^^^ 

"The Devils in an Opera are not so busie", says 

Carlos, describing how the "men in vogue" behave when they 
(31) 

go to a play. In Shadwell's own opera, The TegLuest ^ 

the devils are kept very busy indeed, and are given a 

scene almost to themselves. (Act II, scene iii). 

Shadwell sums up the development of elaborate spectacles 

in his Second Epilogue to Tlie Tempest : 

When you of Witt, and sence, were weary growne, 
Romantick, riming, fustian Playes were showne, 

We then to flying Witches did advance, 

And for your pleasures traffic'! intolerance. 

From thence new Arts to please you, we have

All this time we have been backstage. We must 

now turn to the audience; and here Shadwell furnishes a 

mine of information^chiefly in A True Widow . Act IV 

represents the interior of a playhouse, and opens i¥ith the 

audience drifting in. This performance is semi-private; 

Carlos has bespoken it for his friends; but he allows 

other women (not of his party) to come in free, while 

making the men pay -— or trying to. The talk before the 

play begins is one of the best bits of dialogue Shadwell

Systems of admission were rather haphazard. 
Men seem to have been in the habit of ’’running upon the 


score”, as repys calls it; and it was customary to allow 
anyone in without pa 3 .mient if he did not stay till the end 
of the act then playing. All this appears in the 
following extract: 

Enter several Ladies, and several Men. 

OQ-Pr-keeper . Pray, Sir, pay me, my Masters will 
make me pay it. 

5.Man . Impudent Hascall Do you ask me for Monev? 
Take that, Sirrah. 

' 2.Door-keep . Will you pay me. Sir? 

4.Man . No: I don’t intend to stay.

or three Acts for nothing.

Shadwell also gives us s©me information about 
the price of admission. A brief description of the seating 
arrangements is first in order. The pit occupied the 
lowest portion, sloping rather steeply up? 7 ards from front

to back. The seats here were backless wooden benches. 

The first level at the back of the house was taken up 
by boxes, which extended around the walls to the stage on 
either side, with the Royal box in the centre. Above the 
boxes was the middle gallery, and above that, the upper 
gallery. 

The pit is alluded to in Sir Charles Sedley^s 
prologue to Shadwell^s Epsom-We 11s: 

"Tis not fair play, that one for his Half Crown 

Should Judge, and rail, and damn for half the 
■ Town. ^ 

The pit was the half-crovm section. Admission to the boxes 
was four shillings: "You might have your four shillings 
out in Thunder and Lightning", says Lady Vaine to Emilia 
The two clerks who had offended Sir Positive At-All, sat, 
as we have seen, in the eighteen-penny gallery, that is, 
the middle gallery; and the price of a seat in the top 
gallery was a shilling, Pepys again is at hand to 
corroborate most of these facts: "when I begun first to 
be able to bestow a play on myself, I do not remember 
that I saw so many by half of the ordinary ^prentices and 
mean people in the pit at 2s,6d, a-piece as now; I going 
for several years no higher than the 12d, and then the 18d. i

did 

Of the crowded noisy scene in the pit we have 
already had a glimpse. There were the extortionate orange- 


women, v/ho, when they were not noisily crying their wares 
up and down the theatre, used to sit down and let them¬ 
selves be fondled by the young gallants. To add to the 
confusion, there were ^♦a sort of hopeful youths ... 

...such as come Drunk and Screaming into a Play¬ 
house, and stand upon the Benches, and toss their 
full Periwigs and empty Heads, and with their 
shrill unbroken Pipes, cry, Dam-me, this is a , . 

DamnM Play; Prethee let^s to a IHaore, Jack.."'^‘'' 

*'The men in Togue", says Carlos, ’’forbear none of all these 
things; they dive like Ducks at one end of the 
Pit, and rise at the other, then ^A^Klsk into the 
?Jhore-Boxes 5 then into the Scenes, and always 
hurry up and down, the Devils in an Opera are 
not so busie,”(40l 


Then there were the sparks like Prig, who ’’Haps people on 


the Backs, and twirls their Hats, and then looks demurely, 

(41) 

as if he did not do it,” This was known as ”dumb-found- 
ing”.

place, which came to be called ’’Fop-corner”, Shadv/ell

does not refer to it by name, but in this same play-scene, 1| 
we find the following: ||;

Y.Mag; , Don’t come to us; let you Wits sit 
together. 

Pri^ . These Fellows will be witty, and trouble 
us; go to your Brother Wits, and make a noise among 
yourselves, Brother YiTits. , . 

(They go on the other side.) 


So the ’’Curtain-time”, or overture , was played, 
and the play began. Glare from the unshaded candles, 
noise and stench from the unclean and inattentive audience, 
intruders in the green-room and on the scenes, all seem 
to have been ignored, or at least borne with, by the actors 
and by the serious part of the spectators. j 

Shadwell is the only Restoration dramatist who [ 
has made full use of his knowledge of the theatre; it was 
mere luck, though, that he hit on this point of interest 
to future centuries. He was trying,to amuse the London 
of the ’70’s and ’80’s.

[ 10 ^ 


APPEroiX TO CHilPTER V 
SHADWLL AND BEN PONSON 

Ben Jonson was by all odds the favourite 

Elizabethan dramatist of Restoration London, His great 

plays, Volpone , The Silent Woman , The Alchemist , and 

Bartholomew Fair , were given repeatedly, as we learn from 

such sources as the diaries of Pepys and Evelyn; and even 

his second-best plays -- the ”H\amour” ones, The Devil is 

an Ass , and so forth -- were occasionally revived. Pepys 

goes so far as to call Bartholomew Fair , ”as it is acted, 

the best comedy in the world”. 

But although Jonson was generally admired, few 

Restoration dramatists set out to imitate him. Probably, 

( 2 ) 

as Dryden implies, they preferred wit to himiour; humour, 
that is, in the Jonsonian sense. By an extension of mean¬ 
ing, the word had come to signify, instead of one of the 
four ”fluids” of the human constitution, ai 

( 1 ) Diary , August 2, 1664. 

(2) ”One cannot say he [,Jonson] wanted wit, but rather 
that he was frugal of it...Humour was his proper sphere.” 

( An Essay of Dramatic Poesy , p.81-82, W.P. Ker’s edition.) ' 
”Wit” includes fancy and imagination.

”the Byas of the Mind, u 

By which with violence ’tis one way inclin’d: ! 

It makes our actions lean on one side still, 

And in all Changes that way bends the Will,” 

That is how Shadwell defines it in his Epilogue to The 
(3) 

Humorists (a play written^Jonson’s principles). In other: 

words, a humour is a ruling eccentricity or bias of 

character. The dramatist makes no secret of it, and the ^ 

interest of a "humour” play lies in the skill with which 

he has presented the various humours. Here are some 

examples from the Dramatis Personae of The Sullen Lovers j 

and The Virtuoso : | 

Stanford — A Morose Melancholy Man, tormented beyond 

Measure with the Impertinence of People, and "i: 

resolved to leave the World to be quit of them. i 


Lovel-»-»‘»»-»”=-“An Ayery young Gentleman, friend to Stanford, ! 

one that is pleased with, and laughs at the i 

Impertinents, and that which is the others tor- '| 
ment, is his recreation, "Ij 

Snarl --—--- An Old pettish Fellow, a great Admirer of 

the last Age, and a Declaimer against the Vices | 
of this, and privately very vicious himself. 


Shadwell, then ^followed Jonson, and, in fact, |.j 

issued a manifesto at the very beginning of his career: if; 

”I have endeavour’d to represent [^in The Sullen Lovers i 
variety of Humours ( most of the persons of the Play ^

differing in their Characters from one another) which was 
the practice of Ben Johnson , whom I think all Dramatick 
Poets ought to imitate, though none are like to come 
near; he being the onely person that appears to me to have 
made perfect Representations of Humane Life ... he is the 


man, of all the World, I most passionately admire for his 

(4) 


Excellency in Drammatick-Poetry.He goes on to warn his 
readers not to expect an elaborate plot (or ^’Intrigue; 
for the d6nouement would force him to ‘^let fall the 
humour^% and, he conceives, ’»in the Writing of a Humor, a 
Man is confine not to swerve from the Character, and 
oblig’d to say nothing but what is proper to it”. The 
result is, naturally, a certain sameness, ”the same thing 
over and over”, which Shadwell justifies by asserting 
that he has (in this play) carried on the humours to the 
last, as Horace directs him to do. 

While this system has some advantages, and may 
be very effective, as it is with Jonson, it is a drawback 
to be obliged to present absolutely consistent characters.

modified his system in later plays, and a few, notably 
Ihe Woman-Captain and The Amorous Big:otte !are distinctly 
comedies of intrigue. 

i^hat we are here concerned with is Shadwell’s f 
observation of London, and not primarily his plays as such, 
or even their classification into types. Obviously his 
adherence to Jonson’s principles would not affect his 
references to contemporary life and manners, for all that , 
this adherence demands is the picking out of strongly 
marked characters and the weaving of them into a play. i 

The best of the ^^humour” comedies is probably 
A True 7/idow . It is particularly Jonsonian, not only 
because of the number of "’humours”, but because, as Mr. 

r, ( 6 ) 

Borgman points out it is, in general outline, very » 

similar to The Alchemist . The deceiver, Lady Cheatly, '' 

dupes a host of Londoners, and when she is finally brought j 

to bay she manages to push the blame on her accomplice, the li 

1 s 

Steward, and escape scot free herself; just as Face, in I 
The Alchemist , forces Subtle and Dol Common to decamp, and ! 
himself gets both praise and profit.

deal with London or even with England. The scene is laid 
in Madrid. 

(6) Thomas Shadwell. his life and comedies , p.l75. 

















/ li. 


Further, we find in Shadwell a number of verbal 

echoes'^of Jonson, They occur particularly in the earlier 

plays, although there is one as late as The Scowrers (1690). 

The most considerable is near the beginning of The Woman - 

Captain , where Sir Humphrey Scattergood and his friends 

are giving orders about the luxurious dishes they want 

prepared. This is quite obviously modelled on Sir Epicure 

Mammon’s description (in The Alchemist ) of the delights 

he expects to enjoy through the power of the philosopher’s 

stone. Shadwell’s prose in places can be written as blank 

verse, very nearly as regular as Jonson’s own. I write it 

thus as a matter of curiosity: 

There shall you find what is in season still-- 

the youngest Meat always most nourishing.--- 

The new fain Lamb, The tender Kid, and young fat Pigs.

Veals fed with Milk, ITiitebread, and new-laid Eggs, i:

the long bill’d Cock, that Winter brings in Mists -- i 
?/ith Snipe, Duck, Teal, the Curlew and the Wild-goose,; 
the Brant-goose, Solon-goose and Puffin. | 

Among the fish, they name ’’the Luscio, Eel, the Trout, Char,

following passage in mind: i

We must conclude that the allusions would be

evidence, if more were required, of the popularity of 
donson’s plays. And all the references and imitations 
are further evidence of Shadwell’s knowledge of and 
admiration for donson.

CHAPTER VI 


11/. 


SHAPWELL AIVD SCIEHCE 

"A rare Kechaniek Philosopher" 

'( The Virtuoso ) 

The seventeenth century was the great age of 
science, for in it the foundations of modern experimental 
science were laid; and England nas the scene of many of 
the most important discoveries. A spurt of activity and 
progress never again paralleled distinguished the second 
half of the century. Strange to say, it was during the 
unsettled days of the Rebellion, Civil War, and Inter¬ 
regnum, that men began to meet for the discussion of 
^^natural philosophy^’; Sprat tells us: ’’Their first pur¬ 
pose was no more, then onely the satisfaction of breathing 
a freer air, and of conversing in quiet ¥/ith one another, 

without being ingag’d in the passions, and madness of that 

( 1 ) 

dismal Age.” It was this group of men that formed the 
nucleus of the Royal Society of London, organized in 1660, 
and incorporated by Royal Charter in 1662. 

Although the Society met regularly to see and 
discuss experiments, and even appointed a Curator, who 


(1) History of the 


Royal Society, p.53. 










Ug. 

was to provide experiments for each meeting, most of them 

were carried out by the Fellows in their own homes, and 

then, if interesting and successful, repeated before the 

assembly. It did not take long for some of the wealthier 

members to build up well-equipped ’^elaboratories”, fitted 

out with furnaces, air-pumps, and so forth — it was an 

age of amateurs. It is this fact that Shadwell seizes 

on when he introduces Sir Nicholas Gimcrack as ’^in his 

Laboratory, a spacious Room, where all his instruments 

( 2 ) 

and fine Knacks are”; this fact that gives point to 

the whole play The Virtuoso . 

But is Shadwell, in Sir Nicholas, aiming his 

satire at the Royal Society? He leaves us in no doubt 

about that. Lady Gimcrack, it is true, declares of her 

(3) . 

husband: ”The Colledge indeed refus’d him, they envy’d 

(4) 

him”, and at the end of the play she threatens to send 

all his ’’Letters from [his] several 7diores” to Gresham 

College, — ’’then you’ll be more despis’d than now you 

(5) 

are there,” On the other hand, the remark of one of

regular place of meeting,

the rioting weavers, ’'Are these the Tricks of a Vertuoso? 

( 6 ) 

Have they studied these fourteen years for this?’' 

while spoken of Sir Nicholas, undoubtedly refers to the 

Royal Society. The play was produced in May 1676: the 

Society had been given its charter fourteen years before, 

in 1662, Furthermore, all the experiments t Sir Nicholas 

claims to have performed are taken (with slight changes, 

to make them ridiculous) from works of the members of 

the Society, chiefly the Philosophical Transactions and 

(7) 

Hooke's Micrographia , 

Thus we read in the Philosophical Transactions 
Robert Boyle’s account of his experiments with the air- 

pump. Among other things, he studied "the Relation 

. , ( 8 ) 

between Light and Air (in Shining Wood and Fish)" , He 

(9) 

mentions whiting as the most suitable kind of fish 

(presum.ably because it became phosphorescent most readily). 

He describes how he was able to read a Hebrew Bibje by 

( 10 ) 

the light of a piece of luminous wood. And finally, 

Dr. Beal, of Yeovil in Somerset, writes (May 22,1676) to 
the publisher of the Transactions : "... you have been

tired with the noise of a piece of Fresh Beef, which 

( 11 ) 

shined in the Strand in London”. 

Now for Shadwell’s use of all these facts: 

Sir Nicholas ...I eclipse the light of 
Rotten Wood, stinking 'ATaitings and Thornhack, 
and putrid Flesh when it becomes lucid. 

Longvil . Will stinking Flesh give light 
like Rotten Wood? 

Sir Nicholas . 0 yes; there was a lucid 
Sirloin of Beef in the Strand, foolish people 
thought it burnt, when it only became lucid 
and chrystalline by the coagulation of the 
acqueous juice of the Beef, by the corruption 
that invaded it. ’Tis frequent, I myself 
have read a Geneva Bible by a Leg of Pork, 

Bruce. How, a Geneva Bible by a Leg of 
Pork? 

Sir Nicholas, 0 Ay, ’tis the finest Light 
in the World: but for all that, I could eclipse 
the Leg of Pork in my Receiver, by pumping put 
the Air; but immediately upon the appulse^-*- ^ of 
the Air.let in again, it becomes lucid as 
before. 

' It will be noticed that, beyond assembling the 
material, Shadwell has made very few and very slight 
changes. He makes the Hebrew Bible a Geneva Bible (a 
Puritan version) a sure way of raising a laugh among 


(11) ibid., XI, 599. This is too near the date of the 
play for Shadwell to have used the Transactions account. 
The play was licensed for printing May 31, 1676, and we 
know that Charles II saw it on May 25. But as Beal was 
writing from Somerset, and had had the news in the first 
place from London, weeks or even months might have 
elapsed since the occurrence ample time for Shadwell 
to use it if it was a matter of common report in London, 
as the letter suggests.

Transactions , II, 599.

a Restoration audience — and Sir Nicholas’s learned 

explanation is a neat finishing touch. Even for that 

Shadwell may have used some hitherto undiscovered source. 

One of the most important studies pursued by 

these early scientists was of the air, its properties, 

and its uses. Galileo’s experiments had taught them that 

the air has weight, and Torricelli’s barometer had given 

them the means of weighing it. The next logical step was 

the comparison of the weights of the air at different 

places. [The words "weight” and "pressure" are used in- 

(14) 

discriminately by writers in the Transactions , with the 

former, as expressing the simpler notion, the more 

common.) So frequent were such experiments for a while 

that Pepys writes of King Charles: "Gresham College he 

mightily laughed at, for spending time only in weighing 

( 15 ) 

of ayre, and doing nothing else since they sat." 

Sir Nicholas merely goes a step further: he not only 
weighs the air, but has a supply of various airs on hand 
to use at will. 

Sir Nicholas . ... Chuse your Air, you shall 
have it in my Chamber; Newmarket, Banstead-down, 
Wiltshire, Bury-air, Norwich-air; what you will, 

Longvil . ... It is possible to take all these

Countrey Airs in your Chamber? 

Sir Nicholas^ I knew you were to seek. I 
employ lien all over England, Factors for Air, 
who bottle up Air, and weigh it in all places, 
sealing the Bottles Hermetically: they send me 
Loads from all places. That Vault is full of 
Countrey Air. 

Bruce . To weigh Air and send it to you! 

Sir Nicholas. 0 yes; I have sent one to 
weigh Air at the Picque of Teneriff, that’s the 
lightest Air; I shall have a considerable Cargo 
of that Air. Sheerness and Isle of Dogs Air is 
the heaviest. Now, if I have a mind to take 
Countrey Air, I send for, may be, forty Gallons 
of Bury Air, shut all my Windows.and doors close, 
and let it fly in my Chamber, 

And so a little later they ’’snuff up” some of the 

Bury air: 

Bruce . 0 admirable »- who would go to Bury 
to take it? 

Sir Nicholas . Not I, ’tis much the better 
here; it takes so much the better for being 
bottled, as other Liquors do. For let me tell 
you. Gentlemen, Air is but a thinner sort of 
Liquor, and drinks much the better for being 
bottled, 

Longvil . Most certainly the world is very 
foolish, not to snuff up bottled Air, as they 
drink bottled Drink, 

This is a direct hit at the new theory of the 

air’s fluidity, a strange enough notion to most people 

(18 ) 

when for centuries the air had been merely ignored.' ' 


(16) Shadwell . III, 160. 

(17) ibid ., p.164. 

(18) Not even all the Virtuosi accepted it. An anonymous 
author, whose book Observations touching the Torricellian 
Experiment is reviewed in the Philosophical Transactions , 
IX, 80ff., asserted that the air is a continuous substance.

One last example^this one dealing with the uses 

of air, and respiration, '.■'hen his visitors, Bruce and 

Longvil, first see him, Sir Nicholas is learning, to swim 

on drjr land — in his laboratory, in fact. In the 

intervals of swimming, he "refrigerate^ his]lungs by way 
^ • ... ( 19 ) 

of respiration^^, and after his swim he gives his 
visitors an account of the "curiosities" he has found out 
in 'Thysick'^: 

_Sir Nicholas . Why, 1 have found out the use 
of Respiration,or Breathing, which is a motion 
of the Thorax and the Lungs, whereby the Air is 
impelled by the Nose, Mouth and Wind-pipe, into 
the Lungs, and thence expelled farther to ^ 

elaborate the Blood, by refrigerating it, and i 

separating its fuliginous steams. 

I have found too, that an Animal may be 
preserv'd without respiration, when the Wind-pipe's 
cut in two, by follicular impulsion of Air; to 
?/it, by blo?/ing,wind with a pair of bellows 
into the Lungs. 

The source of these remarkable discoveries was 
not, ho¥/ever, Sir Nicholas's own experiments, but two 
items In Number 28 of the Philosophical Transactions 
The first is a review of a book by a Dutch physician, 
Swammerdam, which reads in part: 

"He makes Respiration to be a Motion of the 


(19) Shadwell , III, 126. Of. Philosophical Transactions 
II, 535: "He scruples not to reprehend the immortal Doctor

Thorax and Lungs, whereby the Air is sometimes 
impelled by the Nose, Mouth and //ind~pipe into 
the Lungs; and thence again expelled; farther 
to elaborate the Bloud, by Hefrigerating it, 
and by Separating its fuliginous steams ...” 

The second is ”An Account of an Experiment made by M.Hook, 

of Preserving Animals alive by Blowing through their 

Lungs with Bellows.” Shadwell follows this almost as 

, ( 28 ) 

closely as the other. 

These examples are given at some length because 
the Virtuosi and their work were a part of Shadwell^s 
London. Shadwell*s own opinion, .and the general opinion, 
of the new scientific discoveries, are hard to find out 
from the play. 

One thing, however, is clear. Sir Nicholas 

several times makes a point of explaining that none of 

his knowledge tends to use. ”1 hate the Water, I never 

come upon the Water, Sir”, he tells Bruce. ”I content 

myself with the speculative part of Swiming, I care not 

for the Practick. I seldom bring any thing to use, ^tis 

not my way, Knowledge is my ultimate end.” 

”You have reason. Sir;” replies Bruce satirically. 

( 23 ) 

”Kn-owledge is like Vertue, its own reward.” 


(22) Shadwell, in thus using the Royal Society's own 
worXs, is much more definite than, say, Swift, (in 
Gulliver , book III). Swift merely ridicules science in 
general; and most of his examples are wholly imaginary. 

(23) Shadwell, III, 127.

Again, he boasts of having "travelled all over 
Italy'’, with ”no other affair in the world, but to study 
the secrets of that harmonious Insect.” (He means the 
tarantula). 

Bruce . Did you not observe the Wisdom, 
Policies, and Customs of that ingenious people? 

Sir Nicholas . Oh, by no meansI *Tis below 
a Virtuoso, to trouble himself with Men and 
Manners. I study Insects ...”(24) 

In a satirical aside Bruce later remarks: ’’This 

foolish Virtuoso does not consider, that one Brick-layer 

(25) 

is worth forty Philosophers.” 

Longvil, too, has his say. 'Hhen Bruce asks him, 

in an interval of Sir Nicholas’s dissertaion on ants, 

”?i/hat does it concern a Man to know the nature of an Ant?”, 

he replies: ”0 it concerns a Virtuoso mightily: so it be 

(26) 

Knowledge, ’tis no matter of what.” 

In defending himself against the charges of the 

rioting ribbon-weavers, who claimed that he had invented 

an engine-loom, Sir Nicholas says: ”I protest and vow 

they wrong me, I never invented any thing of use in my 

( 2 ?) 

life, as gad shall mend me, not I”, and again: ”We

Virtuoso’s never find out any thing of use, ’tis not our 
(28) 

way. 

All these defences of natural philosophy against 
the suspicion of usefulness, and all these slighting 
remarks about its uselessness, appear to have been written 
with a glance at Sprat and others of the Royal Society. 
Sprat’s ’’History'', written nine years before The Virtuoso , 
is much less a history than a vindication of the Society, 
and of science in general, against the charge that it is 
not useful. He takes 100 pages to point out the actual 
and possible uses of the experiments and investigations 
of the members, and to assure his readers that religion, 
morality, learning, loyalty and trade, will not be en¬ 
dangered. Robert Boyle, too, had ¥/ritten a book, Of the 

N ( 29 ) 

Usefulness of Experimental Natural Philosophy (1671), 

In view of Sprat’s somewhat laboured and 
elaborate defence, Shadwell’s misrepresentation is 
justifiable, if satire ever is justifiable. It is not 
fair, but fairness can hardly be expected in satire. It 
is curious that in a later play, The Squire of Alsatia 
(1688), Sir Edward Belfond, held up throughout as a model 
father, includes in his son’s course of studies ’’Natural

(30) 

Philosophy'’ and ’’the Mathematicks”. It is idle to 

speculate on such slight evidence whether Shadwell had 

changed his opinion since 1676. The words of his 

characters do not bind the playwright. 

Now as to the general opinion of experimental 

science. Men of sense and understanding were becoming 

seriously interested in it. John Evelyn,the diarist, one 

of the sanest men of the time, was a Fellow, worked very 

hard for the Royal Society, was elected Secretary in 1672, 

and was offered the Presidency in 1682 and 1693. Pepys 

was President in 1684, Christopher ?/ren, Flamsteed, 

Halley, Newton, are a few more of the illustrious Fellows. 

Still, a vast inertia of ignorance and prejudice and 

settled habits of thought had to be overcome. Even among 

the F.R.S’s themselves, there were those who believed in 

the efficacy of May-dew as a cosmetic; at least, one Mr. 

(31) 

Henshaw had gathered vast quantities of it. Many 

believed in the divining rod, and in touching for the 
( 32 ) 

’’King’s Evil”; and Aubrey is an example of a Fellow who

believed in astrology. 

These were the learned. Superstitions were, 
naturally, much more numerous among the mob, and ignorance 
more prevalent. And when the mob saw the ’’Philosophers” 
staring at the moon through their telescopes, and heard 
vague rumours of their poring over microscopes to examine 
vermin, or were told that, of all things, they spent much 
time in weighing the air, how could they but conclude that 
all their doings were extravagant and ridiculous? ’’What 
does it concern a Man to know the nature of an Ant?” was 
probably asked more than once. We can be sure that the 
audience in Dorset Garden heartily applauded the scorn 
with which Clarinda and Miranda described their uncle. 

Sir Nicholas: 

Clarinda . A Sot, that has spent £2000 in 
Microscopes, to find out the nature of Eels in 
Vinegar, Mites in Cheese, and the Blue of Plums, 
which he has subtilly found out to be living 
Creatures, 

Miranda, One who has broken his brains about 
the nature of Maggots; who has studi’d these 
t¥^enty years to find out the several sorts of 
Spiders, and never cares for understanding 
Mankind.^

Note on the Identity of Sir Nicholas Gimcrack 

In a note on Shadwell’s preface to The Humorists^ 

Mr. J.E. Spingarn states that Sir Nicholas Gimcrack is 

Robert Boyle. Shadwell’s words are: ^^But I challenge the i 

most clamorous and violent of my Enemies...to accuse me, 

with truth, of representing real Actions, or using the 

peculiar, affected phrases, or manner of speech, of any ^ 

( 2 ) 

one particular Man, or Woman living.^’' ‘ 

As I have shown, Shadwell undoubtedly used some 
of Boyle’s reports to the Ro^^al Society; but Boyle was- by ! 
no means his only source. The microscopical investigations | 
are Hooke’s; the experiments on respiration owe their | 

wording to Hooke and Swammerdam; the blood transfusions | 
were done by Lower and Wallis; the information about ants ij 
comes from Edmund King; the inventor of the "stentro- ’■ 

t , 

phonical tube'’ was Sir Samuel Moreland; and the list 
might be lengthened considerably, 1 

Mr, Spingarn’s statement, therefore, seems to me I

Century , II, 340,

a hasty generalization based on a phrase. 

On the other hand, he states a matter of common 

taiowledge when he says (in the same place) that ’^Gossip 

had already attached a real name to Sir Positive At-All 

(4) 

in The Sullen Lovers ^^. As Pepys tells us, everyone 
knew that Sir Positive At-All was meant for Sir Robert 
Howard. 

The point of Mr. Spingarn’s note is that 
Shadwell was not entirely sincere in his claim of not 
representing on the stage any living person. The 
question is, therefore, whether Shadwell, in the passage 
quoted, was referring merely to The Humorists or was 
speaking generally. One is forced to conclude that he is 
speaking generally, as there is nothing to the contrary. 

Mr. Spingarn’s note, then, seems correct in 
principle but not quite accurate in detail. 

(3) He quotes Sir Formal Trifle’s words about Sir Nicholas: 
”He is the most admirable Person in the Meletetiques , viz., 
in Reflections and Meditations, in the whole ?/orld”; and 
adds that this is an allusion to the science of 
’’meleteticks’’ in Boyle’s Occasional Reflections . 1665. 

How about the correspondence between the phraseology of 
Sir Nicholas the the reviev/er of Swammerdam’s book, on the 
subject of respiration? — '’fuliginous steams”, etc.

CHAPTER VII 
CONCLUSION 

The picture of Shadwell’s London which I have 
tried to draw from his plays is far from complete. He 
tells us much — mors, I believe, than any other 
dramatist of his time, about people, manners, morals, 
religion, and the town itself. Some omissions have 
been noticed in the course of the study; a few others 
may be briefly discussed here. 

References to city government are few and far 
between; but there is really no reason why Shadirell 
should refer to it. If he had chosen to Y/rite a play 
around it, as he did around science, scowring, 
stock-jobbing, and the like, it would be a different 
story. City government went on quietly for the most 
part, and there vJas plenty of more interesting things 
to write about. 

I regret more his failure to mention the 
actual appearance of London. True, we have prints 
and plans, but a xvord-picture of the houses and shops 
in the mouth of one of his characters mi^t have been 
both valuable and amusing. 

But, as I have mentioned before, it must 
be insisted upon that he was writing not for future 
students of literature and manners, but for an 




actual, present, London audience, and one very 
hard to please. The simple explanation is that 
he tried to please them -- and usually succeeded.
