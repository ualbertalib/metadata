INTRODUCTION 


This thesis represents part of a project begun at the 
University of Alberta in 1942, in cooperation with the National 
Research Council, for the study of yields of 2,3-butylene glycol 
(CH 3 .CHOH.CHOH.CH 3 ) produced by bacterial fermentation of grain. 

Records of earlier progress may be found in an M.Sc. 
thesis prepared by Shewfelt (19) at this university in 1942-43 
and in various periodic reports from these laboratories to the 
National Research Council. 

Currently, Jackson (14) and Blackwood (5) of the two 
cooperating microbiological laboratories have also written theses 
dealing with their studies. 

A large portion of the work done by the writer in the 
analytical laboratory was necessarily concerned with routine 
determinations of 2 ,3-butylene glycol on liquors produced in 
the microbiological laboratories. This thesis, however, deals

with a somewhat limited study of analytical methods for the 
determination of 2,3-butylene glycol and acetylmethylcarbinol 
with efforts toward improvements concerning simplification, 
speed, and accuracy. A report on some wheat and barley varietal 
and grade results is also included. The appendix contains a 
description of a continuous extraction apparatus devised by the 
writer for removal of acetylmethylcarbinol and glycol from 
larger volumes of fermentation liquor. Methods of analyses for 
some of the major fermentation materials and products are also 
included. 


LITERATURE REVIEW AND DISCUSSION 


Analytical methods for Estimation of 
2,3-Butylene Glycol 

General 

Butylene glycol has in the past been determined quan¬ 
titatively by gravimetric and volumetric methods. Gravimetric 
procedure involves direct weighing but is made difficult because 
of the necessity for quantitative isolation of a pure product. 
N.R.R.L. workers* (16), investigating the possibility of deter- 

* Northern Regional Research Laboratories, Peoria, Illinois, co¬ 
ordinated American and Canadian work on 2,5-butylene glycol 
and acted as a distribution centre for summaries of work etc.

mining butylene glycol (hereafter referred to as glycol) by dry¬ 
ing ether extracts to constant weight at 85°C. found it impossible 
to attain constant weight at this temperature. Pure glycol lost 
as much as 25$ of its weight per hour at 85°C. (using a 1 to 2 gm. 
sample in a small weighing bottle). The same workers tried to 
estimate glycol by measuring the refractive index of the aqueous 
solution of the extracted material, but found that this method 
gave results that were much too high. 

Volumetric analyses require the oxidation of the glycol, 
either with a known volume of standard oxidizing agent, or to a 
product which is determined subsequently. Among oxidizing agents 
that have been used are bromine, potassium dichromate and periodic 
acid. With bromine, glycol is oxidized to diacetyl (6) and the 
diacetyl is determined by the use of Fehling’s solution or by 
van Niel’s nickel dimethylglyoxime method (22)cited by Brock- 
mann (6). Several workers have found bromine oxidation to give 
inconsistent results. A method using standard dichromate solu¬ 
tion as oxidizing agent for glycol steam distilled from wine was 
described by Fellenberg (6). However, this method is in general 
inapplicable to fermentation mixtures. Birkinshaw et al (4) 
used periodic acid because of its general oxidizing reaction on 
polyhydroxy alcohols. This reagent seems to be the most satis¬ 
factory as evidenced by the more recent methods using periodic 
acid. Birkinshaw 1 s method involved the extraction of an alkaline 
solution with ether for 12 hours and an estimation of the volume 
of standard periodic acid used in the oxidation of the glycol

according to: CH 3 CHOH.CHOH.CHj 3 + HI0 4 ^ 2 GH 3 CHO + HIO 3 + HgO. 

One molecule of glycol requires one atom of periodate oxygen, 
this behaviour being the same as with ethylene glycol. This 
method is satisfactory then for fermentation liquors containing 
butylene glycol and no other polyhydroxyalcohols. 

Brockmann and Werkman ( 6 ) modified the above method 
because they found that an extraction in order to be quantitative 
required approximately one week during which time a considerable 
volume of the fermentation mixture was carried over with the 
ether, and also because maintenance of KIO 4 solution at constant 
normality was somewhat difficult. With the type of extractor 
used by N.R.R.L. workers (16) and at the University of Alberta 
in methods to be described later, extraction from a 10 cc. sample 
was complete in 6 hours or less. Even in this shorter time, 
however, there was occasionally some carrying over of the fermen¬ 
tation liquor, one of the reasons for the abandoning of this 
extraction procedure at the University of Alberta. 

The method proposed by Brockmann and Werkman involved 
the following reactions: GH3GHOH.CHOH.CH3 + HI0 4 —* 2GHgCHO + 
HIO3 + HgO; 2CH3CHO + 2UH 2 0H.HC1 —* 2CH3GH « NOH + 2H 2 0 + 2HC1. 
The two molecules of HG1 are titrated with NaOH. Steam distilla¬ 
tion was substituted for ether extraction. The diacetyl formed 
in the oxidation of glycol by the HIO4 and sulphuric acid, is 
passed into an absorption tower containing hydroxylamine hydro¬ 
chloride. An excess of acetone is added to liberate HC1 and the

volume of standard NaOH required to titrate this HC1 is measured. 

The only compounds due to the presence of dextrose that 
might be found in the steam distillate are acetaldehyde, acetone, 
butyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, glycerol, isopropyl alcohol, 2,3- 
butylene glycol and acetylmethylcarbinol. Of these, butyl and 
ethyl alcohol and glycerol have no interfering effect. Acetal¬ 
dehyde was found present in such traces as to be of no conse¬ 
quence. Acetone and 2,3-butylene glycol rarely occur together 
in fermentation mixtures and may be separated by distillation 
before determining glycol. Acetylmethylcarbinol is commonly pre¬ 
sent and must therefore be determined separately and subtracted 
from the total. One molecule of carbinol was assumed to yield 
two molecules of acetaldehyde. Analyses for carbinol will be 
discussed later. 

van Beynum and Pette (13) modified the method of 
Brockmann and Workman by employing NaCl to decrease the solu¬ 
bility of glycol in water and neutralized the liquid with NaOH 
to prevent distillation of acid. Previously Na^CO^ had been 
used for both purposes. 

Methods Used at University of Alberta 

During the first year of this project glycol was deter¬ 
mined using the periodate oxidation and distillation procedure 
(16) corrections being made for sugar and acetylmethylcarbinol, 
hereafter referred to as carbinol. For several months ether 
extractions were conducted, as described in the N.R.R.L. report (16) }

in preparation for the distillation step. This six-hour extrac¬ 
tion was time consuming and frequently part of the sample was 
carried over into the extract, as has already been noted* A 
comparison of glycol results from extracted and non-extracted 
material resulted in the abandoning of the preliminary extraction. 
Fairly good results were then obtained by making appropriate cor¬ 
rections for sugar and carbinol (see appendix). 

Seagram’s method (7) of extraction, involving kerosene 
distillation, gave comparable results (no sugar and carbinol 
corrections are necessary), but because our equipment was unsuit¬ 
able for routine kerosene extractions this procedure was not con¬ 
tinued. 

In May, 1943, the Commercial Solvent’s*method (9) of 
removal of interfering sugars was adopted for our work, this 
removal being accomplished by the addition of CuSO^ and Ga(OH)g 
to the diluted sample, allowing it to stand for 20 minutes and 
centrifuging off the solids before the regular distillation. 

Using the original method as a basis of comparison the 
latter gave good recovery with the control solutions tested and 
with the fermentation liquors (20). 

Discrepancies frequently occurred, however, and these 
were believed to be due largely to losses in the distillation 
process (no ground glass joints were available for the still— 
an adapted 12-unit electrical Kjeldahl apparatus). 

With a view to increasing precision of estimations and 
the conservation of time and reagents, some work was then done 
using the butanol-extraction-direct titration method as described

in the first Wisconsin report (21). Comparatively few deter¬ 
minations were done with the butanol method. The results 
obtained with it, however, were not as satisfactory as those 
obtained with a modified combination method consisting of the 
preliminary CuS 04 -Cu( 0 H)g treatment (9) followed by direct 
titration (21). Studies on the development and success of this 
modified method form a major part of the experimental work 
reported here. This includes modifications, since those reported 
in the University of Alberta Report No.3 (20), mainly with the 
object of measuring and removing the interference of acetyl- 
methylcarbinol concurrently with the direct titration procedure 
for glycol. 

Time-consuming extractions and distillationshave been 
eliminated and more satisfactory and consistent replicate glycol 
results obtained than with any of the other methods tried. 

Details appear on pages 13 to 35.

General 

The immediate precursor of glycol is presumed to be 
carbinol (QH 3 .CO.GHOH-GH 3 ) which is reduced by the organism to 
give the glycol. Acetoin (or carbinol) is produced by the con¬ 
densation of 2 mol. of acetaldehyde, an intermediate product in 
the breakdown of sugar under the influence of an enzyme "car-

boligase" which is present in some bacteria, e.g. Aerobacter 
aerogenes (17). 

Qualitative methods for detection of the presence of carbinol 

Acetoin in the presence of caustic alkali and air 
becomes oxidized to diacetyl CHg.CQ .00 .GH^ which in turn 
reacts with a substance in the broth—probably arginine- 
possessing a guanidine grouping (NH:G(NHg).NH.R) to pro¬ 
duce a pink fluorescent coloration (2). This is the basis 
for the original Yoges-Proskauer test using KOH as an 
oxidizing agent. 

Numerous attempts have been made to hasten and 
increase the delicacy of the Y.P. test, mainly by the addi¬ 
tion of oxidizing agents such as HgOg, Na g Og, FeClg, BagOg, 
KgCrg 07 # Only O’Meara’s modification received wide accept¬ 
ance. This consisted of the addition of creatine to provide 
a greater amount of the reacting guanidine grouping (17). 
(About .25 gm. of creatine to 5 cc. of culture (grown at 
37°C. for 24 hours) followed by 5 cc. of 40$ KOH). In a 
positive test the red color appears in several minutes and 
increases with agitation of the tube contents. 

Yaughn et al (23) combined the reagents into a 
solution consisting of 40$ KOH and 0.3$ creatine. They got 
maximum reaction four hours after adding test reagent to 
six- and seven-hour cultures.

Barritt (2) made the test more sensitive by the 
use of alpha naphthol. To 1 cc. of 3-day culture at 37° 
were added 0.6 cc. of 5 % alpha naphthol in absolute alcohol 
and 0.2 cc. of 40$ KOH. He obtained positive reactions in 
two to five minutes after adding the reagents and maximum 
reaction in one hour, the total time being less than seven 
hours. Barritt claimed that this test could detect diacetyl 
in a dilution of 1 p.p.m. and that if creatine were added 
an even greater delicacy was secured--detection to 1 in 
2J millions. O’Meara claimed for his modification that it 
was sensitive to 1 part in 50,000. Barritt stated that 
absolute ethyl alcohol must be used as a solvent for the 
alpha naphthol because methylated spirits gave a + reaction. 
He also concluded that the ordinary V.P. test had no real 
value as negative evidence of carbinol production. 

Batty-Smith (3) compared the methods of O’Meara 
and Barritt. He found that the latter did not give false 
positives. Davies (10) 4 (13) recommended the V.P. test and 
the use of creatine as a qualitative test for diacetyl but 
stated that the color obtained is not quantitative due to 
polymerization of diacetyl in alkaline solution to benzene 
derivatives. 

Prill, Hammer, and Fabricius have reviewed some 

literature on the determination of carbinol and diacetyl (18). 

Note ; Instead of creatine, dicyandiamide may be used in 
qualitative tests. It has the advantage of being 
cheaper but is not so delicate and is slower.

Semi-quantitative and quantitative methods 

Since carbinol is readily oxidized to diacetyl 
using FeClg or some comparable reagent, methods of deter¬ 
mining diacetyl are applicable to carbinol or carbinol + 
diacetyl (13). 

Published methods for determining diacetyl and 
its precursor (carbinol) are all based on separation of the 
diaeetyl by distillation and its precipitation in the dis¬ 
tillate as nickel dimethylglyoxime ( 1 ). 

Prill et al (18) noted that certain generaliza¬ 
tions can be made with regard to the analytically important 
reactions of alpha dicarbonyl compounds* With few exceptions 
these compounds form dioximes which in many cases react with 
certain metal ions to produce undissociated complex salts— 
the nickel salts being the best known. However, there is 
not complete precipitation of diaeetyl as nickel dimethyl- 
glyoximate. Various factors influencing the determination 
of carbinol and diaeetyl as nickel dimethylglyoximate have 
been studied. Some of these are reagents, heating, pH, time 
of standing, volume of solution, and oxidizing agent used ( 1 ). 

Conversion of diaeetyl into the nickel salt of 
dimethylglyoxime takes place in the following stages ( 1 ):

Reaction 1 is rapid and 3 is rapid upon heating* 

Reaction 2 is slow (being non-ionic) and requires prolonged 
heating for completion 

Barnicoat's work (1) was done with butter cultures, separa¬ 
tion being achieved by steam distillation. The general reac¬ 
tion should apply equally well to diacetyl from fermentation 
liquors, A similar method was used for a time in our work 
and is reported later (16). 

Various colorimetric methods have also been pro¬ 
posed (1) in which, for example, the intensity of red color 
given by the precipitate on the asbestos mat of a Gooch 
crucible is compared with the colors given by a standard 
series of precipitates. This did not prove successful owing 
to the fact that the ppt. comes down in both flocculent and 
crystalline form, the latter being only slightly colored. 
Nessler tube color comparisons have been made with standard 
solutions of nickel dimethylglyoxime in chloroform but this 
is not suitable for concentrations higher than 1 mg. per 
10 cc. 

Other references to colorimetric methods are made 
by Hammer (13), The general conclusion seems to be that for

small amounts of diacetyl the colorimetric method may be as 
accurate as the nickel method but that the latter is more 
accurate for measuring large quantities. 

Methods Used at the University of Alberta (see appendix also) 

One of the main analytical reasons for concern about 
carbinol has been in connection with its interference in glycol 
determinations. For a time, quantitative analyses for carbinol 
were performed by the N.R.R.L. method (16). The qualitative test 
of Dorner and Hellinger (11) reported by Shewfelt (19) was used 
to eliminate the necessity of making a complete determination on 
every fermentation liquor. Carbinol content ranged from 0.0 to 
0.50$ in experiments designed for maximum glycol production, 
Aerobacillus liquors usually containing negligible amounts and 
Aerobacter aerogenes samples somewhat higher quantities. Routine 
carbinol determinations were therefore considered unnecessary for 
Aerobacillus liquors. Aerobacter aerogenes liquors analyzed in 
these laboratories have occasionally, as a result of extreme con¬ 
ditions, contained 1.00$ carbinol. 

Later the Langlyke and Peterson method of determining 
carbinol as described in the Wisconsin Report (21) was substituted 
for the nickel dimethyIglyoxime method. Some results with this 
method are contained in (20). 

A study of a modified direct titration procedure for 
glycol, begun at the University of Alberta (20) by the writer,

has been continued. Some promising results have recently been 
obtained regarding measurement and removal of carbinol inter¬ 
ference from the same sample on which direct titration for 
glycol is made. The various modifications of this method follow. 

EXPERIMENTAL 


Development of a Combined CuS0 4 .Ca(0H)g and 
Direct Titration Procedure for 2,3- 
Butylene G-lycol Determination 


The procedure has as its basis the first part of the 
Commercial Solvents’ method dealing with preparation for dis¬ 
tillation (9) followed by the Wisconsin direct titration method 
( 21 ). The distillation step is thus eliminated. Complete 
details of each method are included in the appendix (page 53 ); 
therefore only modifications will be discussed at this point, 
and a final summary given. 

It was found that interference due to sugar could be 
completely eliminated by the addition to the sample of equal 
amounts of CUSO 4 and Ca(OH)g before making it up to volume. 

For concentrations of residual sugar up to 4$, 5 cc. 
of each of the above reagents were sufficient while 15 cc. of 
each were necessary for sugar concentrations as high as 11 $. 
Higher concentrations than 2$ sugar were rarely encountered in

regular work. In the University of Alberta report No. 3 (SO) 
it was stated that there appeared to be no advantage in modify¬ 
ing the method by placing the 100 cc. volumetric flask containing 
the diluted sample, Ca(0H)g and CuSO^ into a boiling water bath 
for 10 minutes before making up to volume. It is now established 
that this procedure is definitely advantageous whenever acetyl- 
methylcarbinol is present. The effect was not noticed prior to 
the time of the above-mentioned report, owing to the fact that, 
in these limited earlier tests, samples very low in carbinol 
were used and at that time no relatively pure acetylmethylcarbinol 
was available for control work. A discussion of the boiling 
water-bath step will appear later in this thesis under carbinol 
discussion. 


In the direct titration procedure a suitable aliquot 
from the centrifuged treated material is measured into large test 
tubes (125 x 35 mm.) and no further transfer is made. 

Instead of 1 cc. of 1 N HgSO^ as described in the Wis¬ 
consin report, 2 cc, were used to counteract the increased 
basicity introduced by CUSO 4 + Ca(0H ) 2 to make possible a clear- 
cut end pt. in the titration. During early tests 5 cc. of buffer 
solution (.5 M NaHgPO^) appeared to be sufficient to maintain 
the proper pH of 7, even with the extra 1 cc. of acid. Dis¬ 
crepancies, however, showed up later as evidenced by, for example, 
titrations higher than the blank, caused by excessive liberation 
of Ir> from the KI presumably on account of the pH being too low. 
Occasional poor agreement between replicate titrations also led

to a more detailed study being made* It was found, as is shown 
by data to follow, that the use of 8 to 10 cc. of buffer gives 
very satisfactory results. In contrast with earlier findings a 
permanently clear end point is obtained when this larger amount 
of buffer is used, A determination of pH before and after 
titration showed this to be approximately 6.9. 

At the time of the earlier report (20) it was noted 
that placing the test tubes in a boiling water bath for ten 
minutes following the addition of HIO^ and H^SO^ gave higher 
and less accurate results than those obtained when the sample 
was titrated without having received this bath treatment. It has 
been found advisable, however, to let the tubes stand at room 
temperature for approximately 15 minutes after the HIO^ and 
H 3 SO 4 k&ve been added, before adding KI and starch for the Na 2 S 2 0 3 
titration. This length of time normally elapses during the pre¬ 
paration of several samples so that there is no extra time 
involved, except, for example, when it is desired to make 
single repetitions. When there is insufficient time for the 
reaction between glycol and HIO 4 , titrations are naturally too 
high and apparent glycol too low. Blanks did not require this 
standing period. 

Some comparative data are given in the following tables:

(2) CuS0 4 -Ca(0H)g treatment followed by direct

After considering the above and other substantiating 
data it was decided to adopt the modified procedure for routine 
analysis. Occasional discrepancies in results led to a recent 
more detailed study of the method. The minimum amount of acid 
necessary for clear titration was determined by first adding 
the HIO 4 an ^ NaHgP 04 to the sample in the titration tube and 
then titrating with 1 N H 2 SO 4 until the cloudiness disappeared. 
The average of several dozen determinations was approximately

is applicable to the regular procedure, the use of less than 1.8 
cc. of acid resulted in cloudiness and an early indefinite end 
point with blue color returning in a short time. This tended to 
give high results in regular glycol determinations. On the 
other hand, the use of slightly more than 2 cc. of acid with only 
5 cc. of buffer resulted in excessive breakdown of KI and un¬ 
reliable results. The use of larger amounts of buffer there¬ 
fore seemed advisable, as is also shown in Table 71.

was adopted for all later work, since with this amount a per¬ 
manently clear end point and very good replicate glycol results 
were obtained. Another important factor mentioned already is 
the time of standing after adding HIO 4 and H 2 SO 4 . An example 
follows:

The 15-minute interval allowed sufficient time for 
reaction between presumably glycol and HIQ^. If titrated too 
soon the titration obtained is too high and percentage, therefor© 
too low.

from which the final aliquot is taken had been allowed to stand 
for a while. It appears that carbinol was responsible, the 
amount of this substance often being much higher in Aerobacter 
liquors than the relatively constant and negligible amounts 
present in the Aerobacillus liquors. Later it was noticed that 
some Aerobacter samples high in carbinol (as determined by the 
Langlyke Peterson method (21)) developed a red precipitate 
(presumably copper oxide) in the CuS 04 -Ca( 0 H)g treated material 
that had been allowed to stand at room temperature for a few 
hours. 

With material as described above, the apparent glycol 
in aliquots taken at the time the sample was prepared was always 
higher than it was in ones taken after the same prepared sample 
had stood for a time. It was evident that differences in 
"before* and "after" titrations were correlated with percent 
carbinol content, and it was known that carbinol is capable of 
reducing copper salts. (A correction factor is applied in the 
determination of reducing sugars - Appendix). 

Since a constant level was attained after several hours 
of standing it was decided to attempt to hasten the assumed 
reaction between the carbinol and the Cu(0H) 2 by means of treat¬ 
ment in a boiling water bath. 

Accordingly duplicate pairs of treated samples rela¬ 
tively high in carbinol were compared by first allowing the 100 
cc. volumetric flask with contents to stand for 20 minutes as 
recommended for sugar removal, and then placing one of them in 
a boiling water bath for 10 to 15 minutes while the other was

made up to volume, centrifuged, sampled, and titrated. A com¬ 
parison was then made with the results for the bath-treated 
sample, after it had been cooled and made up to volume etc. 

This bath treatment was successful in the attainment of a con¬ 
stant level as low as or lower than the one reached after the 
Cu(OH)g treated samples stood at room temperature for at least 
three hours. 

It was apparent that further studies would be facili¬ 
tated by the use of known amounts of relatively pure carbinol. 

It was for the purpose of attempting to extract carbinol and 
glycol to be fractionated as outlined by Fulmer ( 12 ) that the 
continuous extraction apparatus described herein was constructed. 
In the meantime, Dr. Fulmer and A. G. Bantz of Iowa State College 
kindly supplied this laboratory with some carbinol separated by 
them. This material was used in obtaining some of the data to 
follow. 

In this work to date it has been assumed that carbinol, 
like glycol, is oxidized to 2 molecules of acetaldehyde accord¬ 
ing to the equation: 

CH3CHOH.CHOH.CH3 + HIQ 4 —•» 2GH3CHO + HlOg + h 2 0 , one molecule 
of glycol requiring one atom of periodate oxygen. 

It is the remaining HIO4 that enters into the final 
Na 2 s 2°3 titration, so for purposes of comparison the same con¬ 
version factor has been used for carbinol as for glycol.

Range of color was more distinct just after the tests were per¬ 
formed. However, intensity varied from test to test and with 
period of standing. Because of polymerization as stated by 
Davies (10) (13) the V.P. test color is not reliably quantitative.

(3) Percent glycol after same material stood for 3 hours at 
room temperature. 

(4) Remainder of contents in volumetric flask (after aliquot for 
(1) was removed) placed in boiling water bath for approxi¬ 
mately 15 minutes, then cooled, centrifuged and another 
glycol determination made. See text. 

Percentage differences(using the glycol factor) 
between bath-treated and non-bath-treated samples agree in order 
with carbinol percentages determined by the Langlyke Peterson 
distillation method. The agreement in magnitude is also close. 

It is suggested that there, may have been alcohol interference in 
the distillation for carbinol in samples 1 and 9 # It is known 
that alcohol does not interfere in the direct titration procedure 
for glycol. Another possibility is that some of the carbinol 
interference may be removed during the 20-minute standing period 
for sugar removal. Table XIII gives some support to this idea, 
though the differences are small and relatively constant. How¬ 
ever, the limited data in Table X do not consistently support the 
assumption that there is significant carbinol removal prior to 
the use of the boiling water bath unless the calculated carbinol 
percentages by the distillation method are not strictly compar¬ 
able. If, as is indicated above and in the tables to follow, 
prolonged standing or a boiling water bath is necessary before a 
significant amount of carbinol is oxidized, then it is proposed 
that this method can also be adapted for a rapid quantitative 
estimation of carbinol even in the presence of sugars.

This table shows that sugar interference is removed

bath as used later for carbinol has no deleterious effect. 

Solutions of known amounts of carbinol were then 
tested. Data indicate that in addition to water there may have 
been some glycol present and this offers a possible explanation 
for the residual percentage after the treatment to remove car¬ 
binol. Another possibility may be that a fraction of the

After this test various amounts of CuS0 4 and Ca(OH)g 
were used to determine whether residual percentage after bath 
treatment might be reduced. The same results were obtained, 
however, when the amount of CuS0 4 and Ca(0H) 2 was doubled for 
each of 0.5$ and 1.00$ carbinol samples. The length of time in 
the boiling bath in excess of 15 minutes was also of no effect. 

These are some of the reasons for supposing that the 
residual effect which increased with increasing concentration of 
sample might be due to glycol impurity. 

If such is the case, the carbinol percentages obtained 
using the distillation method are too high, as indicated in 
Tables XIII and XV..

Differences between these results are probably not 
significant. In any case, there is no greater residual % 
in this table than with 0.5% carbinol in the previous one, show¬ 
ing that sufficient CuSO^ and Ca(0H) 2 were used for combined 
sugar and carbinol. Procedures 1 and 2 were used to obtain the 
following results:

Table X value for 2.04% glycol = 2.03% 

Table XIII residual value for 0.5% carbinol ~ 0.09% 

Total = 2.12% 


The figure 2.09% is slightly below the calculated total 2.12%, 
indicating no interference from sugar and alcohol. 

The difference figure 0.31%, which is % carbinol removed by bath 
treatment, agrees with the Table XIII value for initial carbinol 
0.41% minus residual effect 0.09%.

Notes on Table XVI 


In I and II: 

(1) "after bath" # = 1.92 = total glycol, made up of 
1 .02# glycol added to (2), + at least .09# residual interference 
of carbinol (Table XIII) + # glycol in (2). 

Subtracting: 1.92 - 1.11 = 0.81#, which compares with 0.75 actual. 

((!)-(2)) "before bath" = 1.31# = effect of additions 
to (2) which are 1.02# glycol + 0.40# carbinol (Table XII) = 1.42. 
This suggests some carbinol removal by the 20-minute standing 
period. (.12# diff.) Table XIII value for standing effect * 

0.08# on .41# carbinol. 

((!)-(2)) "after bath" = 1.16# = effect of added glycol 
and residual carbinol (if any) on (2). Known = 1.02# glycol + 

0.09 (from .41# carbinol = glycol impurity? ) = 1.11#. Differ¬ 
ence = 0.05#. 

Difference between (2) before and after bath corres¬ 
ponds closely to # carbinol by distillation method, but differ¬ 
ences between (1) before and after bath are not as large as 
would be expected. 


Summary of the Combined Method for Glycol and Carbinol Estimation 

A 3 cc. sample of supernatant fermentation liquor is 
pipetted into a 100 cc. volumetric flask and made up to approxi¬ 
mately 70 cc. with water. 5 cc. of a 20# solution of CuSO^ is 
added, followed by 5 cc. of a 20# suspension of Ga(0H)g. The 
mixture is gently shaken and allowed to stand for 20 minutes, 
after which it is made up to volume. An aliquot of about 25 cc. 
is centrifuged. The remainder contained in the volumetric flask 
is placed in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes, cooled, and an 
aliquot centrifuged. Both aliquots are prepared for titration, 
the first one (no bath treatment) without any delay. 2 cc. of

supernatant liquid are pipetted into a 185 x 35 mm. test tube, 
followed by 8 cc. of 1 N HgSO^, and 5 cc. of .01 M HIQ^. This 
is allowed to stand at room temperature for approximately 15 
minutes. Then 10 cc. of 0.5 M NagHPO^ 1 cc. of 30$ KI and some 
starch indicator are added. The mixture is titrated immediately 
with 0.005 N NagSgO^ to the disappearance of the blue color. 

A blank determination gives a titration of about 15.5 


cc. 

Since 1 cc. of .005 N NagSgOg is equivalent to 0.835 
gm. of glycol the calculation is as follows: (Blank titration 
minus sample titration in cc.) x 0.375 s $ glycol. The same 
factor has been used in carbinol calculations, considering the 
difference obtained between bath-treated and non-bath-treated 
aliquots as carbinol. 

The above method was found to be reliable for fermen¬ 
tation liquors containing up to 4$ sugar where only small amounts 
of carbinol are present, and has been found reliable when at 
least 3$ sugar and approximately 1.0$ carbinol are encountered 
in the same solution. Higher concentrations of sugar can be 
removed by using greater quantities of CuSO^. and Ga(0H)g. In 
such cases acid and buffer are adjusted accordingly for a clear 
end-point.

A Report on Some Glycol Yields 
from Wheat and Barley 


For a detailed account of wheat and barley results 
the reader is referred to the University of Alberta Report No*3 
( 20 ). 

Commercial Grades of Wheat 

A total of twenty-four samples of grades ranging from 
1 to 6 was collected from Saskatoon, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Calgary 
and Moose Jaw inspection offices. Fermentations were conducted 
on 8 and 15 percent mashes, and neared completion in 72 hours. 

The liquor was then analysed for glycol ethyl alcohol and resi¬ 
dual sugar. 

The range of glycol yields on 8$ mashes was from 1.09 
to 1.33$ and for 15$ mashes was from 1.74 to 1.99$ using the same 
organism, Ottawa 47(2) in each case. This range was considered 
so small in view of the widely varying grades and irregularity of 
results that grade of wheat was assumed not to be a significant 
factor from the standpoint of glycol production. 

Variety of Wheat 

Four varieties of wheat, viz. Marquis, Red Bobs, Gar¬ 
net, and Reward were fermented in 15$ mashes. Garnet gave 
slightly higher yields of fermentation products. The range of

glycol yields was from 1.68 to 1.75$, which appeared to be 
insignificant. 

Station 

At the time, only a limited quantity of comparable 
samples were available. These showed no marked differences in 
glycol yields. 

Weathered Wheat 

Comparable fall- and spring-threshed samples from the 
same fields were collected, the spring-threshed samples having 
been damaged by frost and germination. No consistent differences 
could be attributed to degrees of weathering, indicating that 
low-grade, low-quality wheat may be as satisfactory as high- 
grade wheat for this fermentation. 

Barley Fermentations 

Previous work conducted in this laboratory has shown 
that, while the starch content of barley is lower than that of 
wheat, the yield per acre of starch is generally higher (15). 
Consequently, a preliminary survey was made to determine its 
relative value as compared with wheat as a fermentation substrate.

Edmonton, Bon Accord, and Athabaska were first tested. 

These samples represented high medium and low protein grain 
at different stations (Table XVII). 

Varietal differences in yield of glycol were not 
great. Trebi had a tendency to be superior to the other two 
in yield of products. 

Table XVII includes results for glycol determined 
by the two methods as described in Table I (1) and (3). 

The yields indicated a significant station dif¬ 
ference which was not attributable to either the starch or 
the protein content of the barley. 

Barley fermentations reached completion in less 
time than did any previous fermentation with starch, wheat, 
or granular flour.

The average yield of glycol from wheat was 0.1°/o higher than that 
from barley, while the alcohol yield in this test was slightly 
higher with barley. Allowing for differences in starch (about 
6 to 8 °/o) the barley yielded comparatively better than the wheat. 

SUMMARY 


1. Literature dealing with carbinol and glycol methods 
is reviewed. 

2 . The development of a rapid, simple, modified method 
for the estimation of butylene glycol in fermentation liquors 
in the presence of sugar, alcohol, and acetylmethylcarbinol is 
outlined and discussed. 

3. Glycol results obtained with this method have been 
more consistent and satisfactory than with any other method used 
in this laboratory. 

4. The glycol method has been further modified to enable 
removal of the interfering carbinol in the same sample being 
analysed for glycol. 

5. Relative if not absolute amounts of carbinol plus 
diacetyl can be estimated using the double titration. 

6 . A report on glycol yields from different varieties 
and grades of wheat and barley is included. Results show that 
poor quality grain is probably as satisfactory for glycol yields

7. A continuous ether extraction apparatus was devised 
for removal of glycol and carbinol from larger volumes of fer¬ 
mentation liquor. This is described and illustrated, together 
with preliminary results using control solution. Appendix I.

A CONTINUOUS ETHER-EXTRACTION APPARATUS DESIGNED 
FOR USE WITH IARGER AMOUNTS OF 
FERMENTATION LIQUOR 


The extractor described in this section was constructed 
for the purpose of attempting to obtain some relatively pure 
acetylmethylcarbinol for control work. 

Fulmer et al (12) found that fractional distillation 
for the recovery of carbinol gave unsatisfactory results owing 
to the continuous distillation of H 2 0 with the carbinol, even 
when an efficient fractionating column was employed. Extraction 
of the untreated fermented liquor with ether was very slow. A 
satisfactory method was as follows: The fermented medium was 
clarified with diatomaceous earth and filtered. The clear fil¬ 
trate was saturated with Na^SO^ and extracted with ether in a 
continuous extraction apparatus. With the above procedure it 
was found that over 91# of the carbinol and 99# of the unfer¬ 
mented glycol were extracted in 30 hours from a glycol beer fer¬ 
mented by Acetobacter suboxydans . The ether was removed from the 
extract and the residue, containing the carbinol and unfermented 
glycol, was carefully fractionated. The fraction boiling between 
135 and 150° was further purified by the use of an efficient 
fractionating column. The final fraction of the carbinol ob¬ 
tained in a typical experiment had a boiling range of 142 to 
144°. Unfermented glycol was purified by three distillations 
and was free from carbinol. Boiling range was 179 to 182°.

With the above method in mind it was decided to con¬ 
struct a continuous extractor from materials at hand. The 
original model was of glass with cork and rubber connections. 
This was unsatisfactory and, since ground glass fittings were 
not available, metal was used in the construction of the extrac 
tor illustrated in detail on page 48, 

Operation 


Before beginning operation cold water is allowed to 
circulate through J, J can be connected to A and the overflow 
conducted through a coil of tubing in a water-filled container 
around the lower portion of D, and similarly through a small 
removable coil in P if thermostatic control of temperature is 
not available. 

Reservoir N is about 2/3 filled with ether and the 
cork stopper put firmly in place. This 500 cc. bottle is sup¬ 
ported by a clamp. 

The sample to be extracted (approx. 1 litre) is 
poured into the opening at S, followed by ether until the level 
of the latter is sufficiently below L to leave room for approxi 
mately the amount of sample which, having risen in the tube T, 
will be forced back when operation begins. This precaution, 
while not absolutely necessary, facilitates the starting of the 
extraction by enabling reduction of initial vapor pressure

required to begin circulation. The stopcock M is closed and 
cork, with sampling tube R connected by rubber tubing to A, is 
not yet pressed into the opening. 

Stopcock H is then opened and about 10 cc. of ether 
poured through the cup G. 

Leaving H open, hot water is poured into the bath 
surrounding N. As soon as air is cleared from Q, and ether vapor 
reaches H this stopcock is closed. Through opening at S the 
rising level of ether is observed until this reaches the base 
of the opening. Immediately the cork is pressed firmly into 
place and as sufficient pressure develops just to cause the 
liquid to begin to rise in R, stopcock M is opened to allow 
complete circulation. The heater under P can now be plugged in. 

Ether condensed by I flows continuously down T and 
rises up through the screen and beads in the bottom of the 
extraction chamber D, through the fermentation liquor into the 
upper ether level, and hence back through L carrying with it 
ether-soluble substances (glycol and carbinol, etc.). 

With a water bath maintained at about 55°C. pressure 
is not sufficient to cause fluid to rise into A after equili¬ 
brium has been reached. If rise in A becomes excessive because 
of trapped vapor before circulation becomes free, adjustments 
can be made by running cold water on N or by careful release at 
S and H. This is seldom necessary if care is taken in starting 
the extraction. 

This extractor differs from the regular side-arm type 
in that the top of the condenser J is not open to the air, thus

preventing ether losses. The tube R dips into the water solu¬ 
tion and, in addition to acting as a safety opening for 
excessive pressure, can be used for periodic sampling of the 
fluid being extracted. The fluid thus taken out is placed in 
a hot water bath for a few minutes to drive off ether before 
making a regular determination on it. Progress of the extrac¬ 
tion can be measured in this way. 

It is believed that by having ether enter through the 
bottom of the chamber D more uniform permeation of the solution 
is possible, without the need for a stirrer. 

Fulmer (*) does not recommend beginning with a solu¬ 
tion containing less than 5$ of carbinol and states that, 
regardless of the. method of extraction, some water always comes 
over with the carbinol. In subsequent distillation a mixture 
of water and carbinol distills over until all the water has 
been removed. If the concentration of the carbinol is very 
small in the original liquor, much of it will be carried over 
with water in the distillation. 

Experimental 


Results obtained with preliminary extractions agree 
in general with the findings reported by Fulmer et al (12) and 
reviewed herein. 

Table XVTII contains some of the data collected to 

date.

Extraction No.l: A 4.80% glycol solution was made up 
with water and a few grams (approx. 15) of anhy¬ 
drous NagSO^. added. 

Extraction No.2: A 4.14% glycol solution, saturated 

with Na^SO^ at 25°C. was used. This extraction was 
discontinued after 64 hours. The liquid became 
super-saturated below 25°C. and the salt settled 
out while the extraction was not being carried on. 

This formed a hydrate and blocked the extractor. 

Extraction No.3: A 5% glycol solution was saturated 

with NagSO^ at 15°C. This extraction was entirely 
satisfactory.. Glycol analyses were made at 
intervals on the liquid being extracted. 

Final concentration of extracted glycol was 70%. 

The results are also shown graphically. 

* One litre of glycol solution was used for each extraction.

ANALYTICAL METHODS 


NOTE: The finally adopted modified procedures used at the 
University of Alberta for rapid estimation of glycol 
and for removal of carbinol interference have already 
been described (Page 35) and hence do not appear in 
this appendix. 


Extraction Procedures 


Ether Extraction (As outlined by the Northern Regional Research 

Laboratory) 

Apparatus - as illustrated in the attached sketch 

Preparation of sample 

A 25 cc. sample of fermentation liquor is treated 
with 1 cc. of 6 N NaOH, mixed well and filtered. (Centri¬ 
fuged at U. of A.) Ten cc. of the filtrate is taken for 
extraction and is placed in the inner test tube of the 
extractor. The 10 cc. sample taken should contain 0.1 to 
1.0 gm. of butylene glycol. 

The Extraction 

About 50 cc. of ether is used. The addition of a 
small chip of porous plate is recommended to maintain even 
boiling. The large test tube is immersed in a H s 0 bath 
maintained at 65° to 80°C., or as hot a bath as is feasible

is used, being limited only by the capacity of the condenser. 
500 cc. Allihn condensers are recommended (Graham condensers 
used at U. of A.). It is desirable to have the large test 
tube immersed at least as far as the ether level inside the 
tube. To ensure complete recovery they standardized on a 
5-hour extraction period, in the N.R.R.L. work. 

After the extraction, the large test tube is 
removed from the extraction assembly and about 5 cc. H^O is 
added. The tube is then connected with an inclined con¬ 
denser and the ether boiled off by immersing the tube in a 
hot-water bath. Following this, the large tube is discon¬ 
nected from the condenser and held in a boiling HgO bath 
for 5 minutes. The residual liquid is then washed into a 
50 or 100 cc. volumetric flask and made up to the mark. An 
aliquot of this solution is taken for the periodate oxida¬ 
tion procedure (Page 58).

Procedure 

A 5 cc, sample of culture is pipetted into a 
16 x 150 mm. test tube. (The capacity of the tube should 
be about 20 cc.) Exactly 10 cc. of butyl alcohol is added 
with a pipette. Six grams of anhydrous potassium carbonate 
are then added, and the tube immediately corked and shaken. 
It is then let stand a few minutes, with an occasional 
shaking until hydration of the carbonate is complete. It 
is then vigorously shaken for 30 seconds to insure complete 
extraction. The undissolved carbonate should be in suspen¬ 
sion, not in a solid cake at the bottom of the tube. The 
tube is then centrifuged until the supernatant butyl alcohol 
layer is dear (5 minutes ) 9 5 cc. of the supernatant liquor 
measured with a clean, dry pipette, is diluted to 100 cc. 
with water in a volumetric flask. A suitable aliquot of 
this solution—from 2 to 10 cc.—is taken for a butylene 
glycol determination by direct oxidation according to the 
direct titration method described later. If the original 
culture contains more than 50 gm. glycol per litre, it 
should be diluted before the butyl alcohol extraction. 

Calculations 

96 percent recovery of butylene glycol is obtained 
in the butanol extraction. Therefore, the cc. titration 
difference (0.005 N thiosulphate) times 9.38, divided by 
the number of cc. in the aliquot taken for oxidation,

recovered 96 percent in the extraction, the true butylene 
glycol content of the sample is the apparent butylene glycol 
minus 90/88 times the acetoin content of the sample. The acetoin 
determination is carried out by the distillation method. 


Interfering substances 

Glucose up to 20 percent does not interfere. 

EtOh up to 5 percent does not interfere. The constituents 
of culture media do not appreciably interfere. A medium 
containing 1 percent peptone plus 1 percent Difco Yeast 
Extract was found to have an apparent butylene glycol con¬ 
tent of 0.73 gm. per litre. A 5 percent malt sprouts 
medium contained 0.7 gm. per litre of apparent glycol* 


Notes : The butyl alcohol used probably contains traces of 
substances oxidizable by periodate. Corrections 
are determined as follows: A blank determination is 
run, 5 cc. of water instead of 5 cc. of culture 
being extracted. 10 cc. of diluted extract is 
used in titration. The titration difference is 
the correction for the butyl alcohol when 10 cc. 
aliquots are used. For example, 5 cc. of water 
plus 6 gm. of KgCOg plus 10 cc. butanol; 5 cc. 
extract diluted to 100 cc.; 10 cc. of diluted 
sample oxidized. Titration difference, 0.20 cc. 

For a 5 cc. aliquot the correction would be 0.10 
cc. If a titration difference of 7.93 is given 
by the sample, the corrected titration difference 
is 7.83 cc.

Kerosene Extraction (from the J. E. Seagram & Sons Report No.l) 
Extraction 

The fermentation mixture is centrifuged in a 250 
ml. centrifuge bottle at 2000 r.p.m. for 15 minutes or longer 
if necessary. 10 ml. of the supernatant liquor is pipetted 
into a 250 ml. flask and the pH is adjusted to 8.0 with 6 N 
NaOH. 20 ml. of a kerosene fraction (boiling point 200 to 
220°C.) is added and the flask connected to a 12" condenser 
through a glass adapter. Distillation is carried out over a 
low flame into a 100 ml. separatory funnel until 25 ml. of 
distillate has come over. The water and glycol fraction is 
drained off into a 100 ml. flask, the condenser washed out 
thoroughly and the washings run into the separatory funnel 
for further extraction of glycol from the kerosene layer. 

One further aqueous extraction of the kerosene layer is made 
and all washings are added to the volumetric flask, which is 
then made up to exactly 100 ml. It is then ready for the 
glycol analysis.

titrated at once, but more uniform results have been 
obtained by holding the solution for an hour in a refri¬ 
gerator at about 45°5'. Twenty drops of the starch indi¬ 
cator are added to the solution and the excess NaHSOg is 
titrated with the strong I-KI solution. The precise 
adjustment of the end point is then made with 0.03N iodine 
and 0.03N thiosulphate. The aldehyde held by the bisul¬ 
phite is then released by the addition of 15 ml. of 
saturated NaHC0 3 . Titration of the liberated bisulphite 
is begun at once with 0.03N iodine. Near the end of the 
titration small quantities of 10$ NagCOg are added to com¬ 
plete the dissociation of the bisulphite aldehyde complex. 

The end point is taken as that point at which the starch- 
iodide color persists for 30 seconds in the presence of 
Na2C0 3 . 

Calculation 

One molecule of glycol is oxidized to two mole¬ 
cules of acetaldehyde which combine with two molecules of 
bisulphite which require 4 equivalents of iodine on titration, 
i.e. 1 cc. of .01N 3gis equivalent to 0.225 mg. glycol. 

If a 1.0 ml. sample of the extracted glycol solu¬ 
tion is used the calculation becomes, ml. 0.03 N Ig x 0.675 
= % butylene glycol in original liquor.

Interfering substances 

Any substance which forms an aldehyde on perio¬ 
date oxidation will cause interference. This includes 
acetylmethylcarbinol, sugars, some amino acids and lactic 
acid. There is no interference from ethyl and butyl 
alcohol. The kerosene distillation removes the sugars and 
amino acids and decomposes acetylmethylcarbinol and lactic 
acid. The amount of aldehydes produced from the two latter 
substances has been found to be so small that corrections 
are not made for them in routine tests. 

Determination of Glycol by Direct Titration (from University of 
Wisconsin Report No.l, January, 1943) 

Distillates, or other samples where interfering sub¬ 
stances are not present, may be analyzed for 2,3-butylene glycol 
by this method, which is more convenient than the acetaldehyde 
titration procedure. 

Reagents 

(a) 0.01 N KIQ^ solution (2.3 gm./litre) 

(b) 1.0 N H 2 S0 4 

(c) NagHPQ^ 0.5 N solution, 71 gm./litre 

(d) KI, 30 gm. per 100 cc. 

(e) 0.005 N thiosulphate, made just before use 
by dilution of 0.1 N thiosulphate 


(f) Starch indicator.

Procedure 


The sample, 10 cc. or less in volume, containing 
4 mg, or less of 2,3-butylene glycol, is pipetted into a 
25 x 200 mm. test tube. 1.0 cc. of 1.0 N H 2 S0 4 and 5 cc. 
of 0.01 M KIO^ are added, and the contents of the tube are 
mixed. The tube is then heated for ten minutes in a boiling 
water bath. After cooling, 5 cc. of 0.5 M Na^HPO^ are added. 
The contents of the tube are mixed, and 1 cc, of the KI 
solution is added. The liberated iodine is titrated imme¬ 
diately, the 0.005 N thiosulphate being added from a 25 cc. 
burette. A blank tube to which no sample is added is carried 
through the same procedure. The blank titration will be 
about 20 cc. The difference between the blank titration and 
the sample titration is proportional to the amount of glycol 
in the sample. If the sample titration is less than 2 cc. 
the determination must be repeated on a smaller sample.

Butylene glycol reduces EI0 4 only to KI0 3 . At 
the pH of the titration (7.0), KI0 4 will liberate I from KI 
but KI0 3 will not. Since two equivalents of oxidant are 
consumed in the oxidation, 1.0 cc, of 0.005 N thiosulphate 
is equivalent to 0.225 mg. 2,3-butylene glycol.

Interfering substances are present in ether extracts. 

Methods for Determining Acetylmethylcarbinol 


Direct Titration (from Wisconsin Report No.l) 

Acetoin in distillates or other samples not containing 
interfering substances may be determined by direct titration. 

For cultures preliminary distillation is necessary. 

Reagents 

(a) 1.0 N NaOH 

(b) Iodine, approximately 0.02 N, made by dilu¬ 
tion of 0.2 N iodine 

(c) 1.0 N H 2 S0 4 

(d) .005 N thiosulphate 

(e) Starch indicator 

Procedure 

The sample, 10 cc. or less in volume, containing 
1.3 mg. or less of acetoin, is pipetted into a 25 x 200 
mm. test tube. 2 cc. of 1.0 N NaOH are added, and 5 cc. of 
0.02 N iodine are added with a pipette. The contents of 
the tube are mixed and it is allowed to stand for 10

minutes or more at room temperature. 3 cc. of 1.0 N HgSO^ 
are added and the liberated iodine is titrated immediately, 
0.005 N thiosulphate being added from a 25 cc. burette. If 
the titration obtained is less than 2 cc. the determination 
must be repeated on a smaller sample. A blank determination 
is run. This should give a titration of about 20 cc. The 
difference in titration between the blank and the sample is 
proportional to the acetoin content of the sample. 

Reactions and calculations 

I 2 + 2Na0H Nal + NaOI + HgO 

CH 3 CH0HC0CH 3 + SNaOI + HgO CH 3 GH0HC00H + CEI 5 + SNaOH 

Since six equivalents of iodine are required per mole of 
acetoin, 1 cc. of 0.005 N thiosulphate corresponds to 0.0733 
mg. acetoin. 

Interfering substances 

Any substance oxidized by hypoiodite under the 
conditions of the determination will interfere. It is there¬ 
fore usually necessary to separate acetoin from such sub¬ 
stances by some preliminary procedure, usually distillation. 
2 ,3-butylene glycol interferes to a certain extent.

Determination of Aoetoin in Cultures 

Apparatus 

The distillation apparatus used consists of a 
300 cc. round-bottom flask, mounted on an asbestos gauze in 
which a hole about 4 cm. in diameter has been made. The 
flask is covered by a hood. The construction should be such 
that the temperature inside the hood during distillation is 
roughly 100°0. The purpose of the hood is to prevent con¬ 
densation with its attendant fractionating effect. It is 
advantageous but not necessary to use a ground glass joint 
for connecting the flask to the condenser. The condenser 
jacket is 8 inches long. 

Principle 

When a dilute, solution of acetoin is distilled, 
the ratio of its concentration in the condensed vapor to 
its concentration in the liquid being distilled is a con¬ 
stant whose numerical value is approximately 1.30. When 
100 cc. of a dilute solution of acetoin is distilled in the 
apparatus described and 25 cc. portions of distillate are 
collected, it is found that the distribution of the acetoin 
in the distillate is as follows:

It is therefore possible, from a titrimetric 
determination of acetoin in one of these distilled frac¬ 
tions, to calculate the concentration of acetoin in the 
original solution. 

Procedure 

A dilution of the culture to be analysed is pre¬ 
pared. fhe dilution which is most convenient will vary 
with the acetoin content of the culture, but in general 10 
cc. of culture diluted to 200 cc. will be found satisfac¬ 
tory. 100 cc. of diluted culture is pipetted into the dis¬ 
tilling glask, a pinch of talc is added to prevent bumping, 
and distillation is begun. The rate of distillation should 
be such that 5 to 8 minutes are required for each 25 cc. of 
distillate. Exactly 50 cc. of distillate, collected in a 
volumetric flask, are discarded. The next 25 cc. of dis¬ 
tillate, collected in a volumetric flask, is well mixed and 
kept for analysis. A suitable aliquot from it (2 to 10 cc.) 
is analysed for acetoin by the direct titration method. 

Calculation 

The 25 cc. distillate fraction contains 23.9 % of 
the acetoin present in the original 100 cc. of dilute cul¬ 
ture distilled.

Interfering substances 

The use of the third quarter of distillate for 
analysis eliminates many possible interfering substances. 
Volatile materials (acetone, acetaldehyde, etc.) would be 
found only in the first and second quarters. Non-volatile 
materials will remain in the boiling flask. The only com¬ 
pound usually encountered in fermentations which will give 
trouble is S,3-butylene glycol, which is oxidized to some 
extent by NaOI. The interference due to butylene glycol is 
variable, but is usually approximately 10 percent. That is 
10 gm. of glycol give a titration equivalent to 1 gram of 
acetoin. Since the concentration of glycol in the third 
quarter of distillate is much less than that in the culture 
the interference is usually not important unless the glycol 
acetoin ratio is very large. In such cases, a double dis¬ 
tillation may be resorted to. 

Notes : In the absence of volatile interfering substances, 
the first half or first quarter of the distillate 
may be taken for acetoin analysis. The use of the 
first half may be convenient when ethyl alcohol is 
being determined. Further data on acetoin analysis 
have been published by Langlykke and Peterson (Ind, 
Sng. Chem. Anal. Sd. 9:163. 1937). 

FeClg Distillation Method (from N.R.R.L. report) 

The determination is based upon the oxidation of ace- 
tylmethylcarbinol by FeCl^ to diacetyl, reaction with NHgOH to 
from dioxime and precipitation of the dimethylglyoxime salt of

nickel. The nickel salt is filtered off, decomposed by H 2 S0 4 
and the liberated hydroxylamine oxidized by a ferric salt, the 
equivalent ferrous salt is then determined by standard perman¬ 
ganate. 

Apparatus

changed. All but 10 ml. of the reaction mixture is dis¬ 
tilled. The condenser and delivery tube are rinsed into 
the receiver with water, 10 ml. of nickel sulphate is then 
added and the flask, after being tightly stoppered, is in¬ 
cubated at 80 to 85°C. for one hour in an oven. If more 
than traces of acetylmethylcarbinol are present, a reddish 
precipitate will appear. At the end of the incubation 
period the precipitate is filtered off on a No. 40 Whatman 
filter paper and washed three times with hot sulphuric acid 
poured over the precipitate in 5 ml. lots, 40 ml. being used 
in all. Small washings with hot water between the additions 
of sulphuric acid increase the rate of solution. Twenty- 
five ml. of ferric ammonium sulphate solution is then 
added and the flask is placed on a hot plate and boiled for 
five minutes. 3 ml. of 85$ H^PO^ Is added to the hot solu¬ 
tion and it is titrated immediately with 0.2 N KMnO^, using 
a microburette. The endpoint is reached when the perman¬ 
ganate color persists for 30 seconds. 

Quantitative conversion of acetylmethylcarbinol 
to dimethylglyoxime is not accomplished; hence a factor has 
been developed which is based on a 72$ yield. Using a 5 ml. 
sample it has been found the percentage of carbinol is 
arrived at by multiplying the KM 1 O 4 titration figure by 
0.123.

Methods for Determining Ethyl Alcohol 


Distillation Method (from Northern Regional Research Lab. Methods) 


Apparatus 

A 500 ml, boiling flask; a Kjeldahl adapter with 
a 50 ml, separatory funnel connected to a coil condenser 
15 inches long; a 200 ml, pressure bottle; a water bath. 

Reagents 

0.2 N K 2 Cr 2 0 7 (9.801 gm. per litre) 

■ - x 

0.2 N NaSgO^.SHgO (49.658 gm. per litre) 

10$ potassium iodide 

50$ H 2 S0 4 

Starch indicator 

The fermented mash is centrifuged and a 25 ml. 
sample of the supernatant liquor removed and placed in the 
500 ml. boiling flask along with 1 ml, of 6N NaOH and 25 
ml. of water. The stopper, fitted with the Kjeldahl adap¬ 
ter and separatory funnel, is put in and connection made 
with a vertical coil condenser. The receiver is a 50 ml. 
volumetric flask. The contents of the flask are distilled 
at such a rate that about 30 ml. of the liquid comes over 
in 20 to 25 minutes. At the same time water is run into 
the distillation flask at such a rate that there is no 
change in volume during the distillation. The receiving

flask is mad© up accurately to 50 ml. and analyzed directly 
or diluted if necessary. 

One ml. of the alcohol-containing distillate 
(with not more than 30 mgm. alcohol) is placed with 15 ml. 
of 0.2N potassium dichromate and 20 ml. of 50$ sulphuric 
acid in a 200 ml. well stoppered pressure bottle, which is 
well shaken and placed in a boiling water bath for 20 
minutes. It is then cooled and diluted to 150 ml. with 
water, after which 10 ml. of 10$ potassium iodide is added. 
The free iodine is titrated with 0.2N Nac^Og, using starch 
as an indicator. 

Calculation 

.0048 (15 - titration (ml. of 0.2N NagSgOg) x 100 = 
gm. alcohol in 100 ml. of original solu¬ 
tion) 

46 gm. alcohol = 4 litres N thiosulphate 

Interfering substances 

Any substance which yields volatile products on 
oxidation by dichromate will interfere. In the fermentation 
cultures acetylmethylcarbinol and 2,3-butylene glycol are 
the only interfering compounds. It has been found by experi¬ 
ment that the distillation method used for the recovery of 
the alcohol separates out almost all the butylene glycol and 
a large proportion of the acetylmethylcarbinol.

90 gm. butylene glycol * 6 litres normal thiosulphate 
88 gm. acetoin = 4 litres normal thiosulphate 

Corrections 

In routine tests the correction for butylene 
glycol is negligible. For each 1$ acetylmethylcarbinol in 
the original fermentation solution 0.014$ must be sub¬ 
tracted from the final alcohol result.

Add 2 gm. NaHCO^ per litre 

50 ml. of the alkaline copper reagent is pipetted 
into a 300 ml. Erlenmeyer flask. An aliquot of the solution to 
be tested containing 25 to 150 mgm. of sugar is added, 
together with distilled water to bring the total volume to 
100 ml. The flask is placed on a hot plate adjusted in such 
a way as to bring the solution to a boil in 4 minutes. The 
flask is then boiled for 5 minutes; during boiling small 
beakers are inverted over the flasks to prevent evaporation. 

The flasks are cooled in a water bath to at least 40 to 50°C. 
From a pipette exactly 25 ml. of KI - KIO^ solution is added, 
together with 20 ml. of 5 N HgSO^ added carefully, and 20 ml. 
of KgCgO^ solution. The solution is well shaken and allowed 
to stand about half a minute until it is clear. It is then 
titrated with N/10 NagSgOg using starch solution as indicator. 

A blank consisting of 50 ml. of alkaline copper reagent and 
50 ml. of distilled water is analyzed at the same time.

From a graph previously constructed the mgm. of 
Cu can be read off as mgm. of sugar directly. 

Interfering substances 

Acetylmethylcarbinol is capable of reducing copper 
salts and makes the apparent glucose result too high. The 
correction factor is applied as follows: 

Apparent glucose minus ($ acetylmethylcarbinol x 0.87) = 
true glucose. 

The Determination of Starch in Wheat Flour 


The following method of analysis has been developed in 
these laboratories: (Div. of Applied Biology, N.R.C., Canada) 

2.50 gm. of whole wheat or white flour is weighed into 
a 300-400 ml. beaker and suspended carefully in 10 ml. of water. 

60 ml. of stock calcium chloride solution (approximately 50$ 
CaClg^HgO adjusted to sp. gr. 1.30) and 2 ml. of 0.8$ acetic 
acid are added. The acidity of the dispersion medium should now 
approximate a pH of 2.5. The contents of the beaker are whipped 
with a glass rod until a uniform suspension completely free from 
lumps is obtained. It is then brought to boiling in approximately 
4 minutes over a 3-4 inch colorless Bunsen flame and boiled 
steadily for 15 minutes with frequent stirring, constant volume 
being maintained at the same time by the addition of water. 
Frothing may be controlled by the addition of a few drops of
