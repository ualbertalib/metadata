SYNOPSIS 


The object of this study was to determine the nature 
and the volume of editorial comment on education In Alberta. 
This was done by reading and analyzing every editorial on 
education appearing in the six daily newspapers of the 
province during a five year period from January 1, 1946 
to December 31, 1950. 

Editorials on education, which comprise approximately 
three per cent of all the editorials appearing in Alberta's 
newspapers, tend to be most concerned with financial expen¬ 
ditures for education, problems involved in higher educa¬ 
tion, and the efficiency of the curriculum. In the main, 
comment is favorable. Only when the curriculum and educa¬ 
tional finance are examined by the editors does criticism 
mount. 

While there is often an intelligent analysis of educa¬ 
tional problems, the virtual neglect of many questions of 
considerable importance to educators and the ill-informed 
appraisal of certain educational procedures indicates a 
lack of contact with what goes on In the schools. 

Definite areas of agreement and disagreement between 
editors and educators are revealed. This is further 
evidence of the need for greater public news-giving on the 
part of workers in the schools.

CHAPTER I 


THE PURPOSE AND PLAN OF THIS STUDY 

The aim of this study is an analysis of editorial 
opinions about education as revealed by the editorial col¬ 
umns of Alberta newspapers. It is undertaken in the belief 
that this opinion is of vital concern to educators sine© news¬ 
papers, to some degree, both mold and reflect the public will, 
upon which the continuing function of education is dependents 

Consideration of this editorial expression of public 
opinion should help workers in education to get a clearer 
view of the public T s attitude toward their aims, methods, and 
problems. The result should be a finer definition of the 
areas In which there Is disagreement or misunderstanding 
between educator and layman, thereby enabling workers in the 
schools to offer a better interpretation of their function to 
the public. Then the public, especially the press, possessing 
better understanding, would be in a position to offer a more 
wholesome and more constructive criticism. 

The material for this study was obtained by examining the 
editorial comments on education appearing in the six 1 dal ly 
newspapers of the province--the Calgary Albertan, the Calgary 
Herald, the Edmonton Bulletin, the Edmonton Journal, the 
Lethbridge Herald, the Medicine Hat Daily News—during a 


1 Since the completion of this study the Edmonton Bulletin has 
ceased publication.

period of five years, from January 1, 1946 to December 31, 
1950o 

In the selection of these newspapers such factors as 
circulation, 2 geographical distribution, population, and 
the volume of editorial comment were considered* The type 
of control or ownership, the general type of newspaper, the 
nature of the geographical section represented, or the pol¬ 
itical complexion of their ownership were not judged as being 
significant here in Alberta. The seventy-eight weekly news¬ 
papers of the province were not considered in this study 
because of their small circulation and meagre editorial com¬ 
ment* 

The time covered in the study is long enough to give 
assurance that genuine policies and attitudes ?:ith respect 
to education are revealed rather than casual or chance 
reactions. Furthermore, it is current enough to be of value 
to educators in the determination of their present policies* 
The period studied did not, however, indicate any significant 
developmental trends in the editorial attitude toward educa¬ 
tion* 

Nearly nine hundred editorials on education were read* 
This mass of editorial comment was then sifted in order to 
make possible a description of the nature of the comment on 
issues important in education today. To facilitate the

Under these main headings sub-topics were listed by 
combining the capital letter of the main heading with a small 
letter or letters denoting the sub-topic * As each editorial 
was read a notation with appropriate letter headings was made 
on an index card and then placed in a corresponding file. An 
editorial dealing with teacher*s salaries, for example, would 
be marked Ts» 

As a result of the unusual character of this material a 
functional method for dealing with quotations and footnotes

While the author of this study has consistently striven 
for objectivity, the very nature of the task implies that some 
measure of the writer*s own personal beliefs are apt to be 
projected into the material examined. This should be consid¬ 
ered in any evaluation of the results* 

Some conclusions pertaining to the total volume and 
nature of the comment are presented first, followed by eight 
chapters treating the major areas in education of interest to 
the press. Abundant illustration and citation is included* 
Finally, conclusions are drawn concerning the more important 
findings and implications*

CHAPTER II 


THE VOLUME AND NATURE OF PRESS COMMENT ON EDUCATION 

NUMBER OF EDITORIALS ON EDUCATION 

How many editorials on education are there in the six 
daily newspapers published in Alberta? Is editorial comment 
on education great or little in amount? These questions can 
be partially answered by referring to Table I, which shows 
the total number of editorials on education appearing in the 
newspapers included in this study. It is based on an exam¬ 
ination of every editorial printed in every issue of these 
newspapers from Jai uary 1, 1946 to December 31, 1950. The 
table reveals that 883 editorials were written in education 
during this five year period and that the Edmonton Journal 
led all others in volume of comment® 

Observation of the proportion of editorials on educa¬ 
tion to all editorials will perhaps give a better concept of 
the emphasis given editorially to education. Table II shows 
that approximately three per cent of all editorials appearing 
in Alberta*s daily newspapers are devoted to education. 

Do editors give enough attention to education? This 
question is indeed difficult to answer with finality. To 
find an answer would require making a comparison of the pro¬ 
portion of space devoted to education with the proportion of 
editorial space devoted to the many other social institutions 
and human activities which demand attention and offer fields 
for comment. All this study can do is suggest that the space

devoted to education is not as large as might be expected 
from editors who profess to believe in the primacy of ed¬ 
ucation in a democratic civilization., 

NATURE OF THE COMMENT 

Table III indicates the frequency of mention of the 
major topics in each newspaper examined in this study® 

Higher education, and educational costs and finance rank 
ahead of the rest in popularity with editors® Four of the 
six newspapers alloted the largest portion of their space 
to higher education, while the other two placed educational 
finance at the head of the lis t. 

Aside from mentioning the fact that, on the whole, 
favorable editorial comments on education far outnumber those 
critically written, the position maintained in editorial 
comment summarized is left for later chapters, where inter¬ 
pretations may be properly qualified and explained. 

In these later chapters the main currents of editorial 
comment are analyzed and illustrated and an attempt made to 
study their significance and implications. The plan will 
be not only to indicate the approximate numerical strength 
of the issue under discussion, in terms of the frequency 
of its mention by editors, but also to convey something of 
its force and meaning® For this reason the circumstances under 
which the utterance appears, and the manner in which it is 
said will also be considered. In this way it Is hoped to

CHAPTER III 


EDUCATIONAL FINANCE 

After reading editorials on education appearing over a 
period of five years in the six daily newspapers of the 
province the overwhelming impression is that a major concern 
of Alberta*s editors, when they think about schools, is money<, 
The evidence that money matters greatly concern the press 
rests on the fact that of all the editorials on education 
covered in this study, 125, or 14*04 per cent, have to do with 
educational finance in Its various phases* This figure do6s 
not include twenty-three additional editorials on teachers* 
salaries, or ten on school buildings included under other 
headings in the tabulation® Nor does it include numerous 
editorial allusions to educational finance made in a passing 
fashion not seeming to justify their inclusion in this group® 
Two newspapers devoted about one-fourth of their comment 
on education to the various aspects of educational finance « 
The Medicine Hat Daily News deals with this subject In 28.15 
per cent of its education editorials, while in the Lethbridge 
Herald 24.90 per cent of the editorials on education com© 
under this heading. This assumes more significance when one 
pauses to consider the vast possible raa ge of discussion on 
educational topics® 

INCREASED COSTS 

Editors are well aware of the fact that educational

costs have increased and most believe that this trend will 
continue. "The cost of education, like everything else, is 
going up," declares the Medicine Hat Daily News. "It is not 
surprising to find that the Board must ask for more money in 
order to adequately carry out its own program. 

Under the heading "Costly Business’ 1 the Lethbridge 
Herald remarks that the ’’cost of education per pupil in 
rural areas is three and four times what it was twenty-five 

p 

years ago.” Noting conditions at Delbume, Alberta, this 
paper further points out that "in 1949 teachers’ salaries 
and van service to get the children to the large unit school 
cost more than the whole cost of operating the school in 
1947."^ The Edmonton Journal^ notices that school approp¬ 
riations in that city are up nearly ha.If a million dollars 
in three years. 

In some parts of the province the problem of financing 

school expenditures is regarded as critical. For exanpie 

the Medicine Hat Daily News observes: 

Educational costs in Medicine Eat will this year hit 
the limit set by charter. The demand from the school 
board upon the city will exceed 25 mills, the limit 
allowed under the charter, and where the deficit is 
to come from no authority is certain at this writing. 
Even the prospect that teachers may go without sala¬ 
ries next December was mentioned In a conference this 
week between educational and municipal authorities of 
the ci ty. 5

Nor does the Edmonton Bulletin foresee any Immediate 

change in the situation* "Education costs will continue to 

rise and the public must expect to pay these costs*" 6 7 

Editors have been quick to point out that the increasing 

amount of time and money spent on education puts it in the 

class of big business* "It is unquestionably among the most 

complex, difficult, and important tasks to which public 

monies and the skills, energies, and intelligence of thou- 

r? 

sands are devoted*" claims the Edmonton Journal* 

"Education is becoming big business in Alberta," states 
the Lethbridge Herald* "It would have taken the total 
Alberta Government revenue in 1935 and five million dollars 
besides to pay the cost of operating Alberta ! s primary and 

o 

secondary schools during 1949*" 

Many editorials explain to the public that the increase 
in costs is not the result of inept handling of school expen¬ 
ditures by school authorities* Rather it Is due to the increase 
in school population, more children staying longer at school, 
the acute teacher shortage, higher standards of education, 
increased building costs, and the fact that more students are 
going on to university than ever before* 

School trustees are cautioned by the Edmonton Journal 
that because "the school bill * * « is reaching such propor¬ 
tions * * * they will be expected to examine each appropria¬ 
tion with a critical eye* M ^ Complaint concerning capital

expenditures by school boards is voiced by the Calgary 
Herald under the caption "School Spending: Where are the 
Taxpayers." 

We can see no reason why school board capital expen¬ 
ditures should not be submitted to the taxpayers on 
all occasions, and be subject to the same conditions 
as any other money bylaw, namely a two-thirds 
majority. 

The Lethbridge Herald continues this critical ap¬ 
proach when it argues: 

Its all right to say that education is entitled to 
every cent it can get, that no money was ever put 
to better use. But there's also the angle that the 
money must be earned before the people can pay their 
taxes. School authorities should tackle their problem 
v/ith some realism — an understanding of the fact that 
the money must be earned before it can be spent in 
taxes.11 

In the main, however, editorials in this area are 
genuinely sympathetic toward the problems created by the 
increasing cost of education aid comment at some length 
on the need, on the part of the public, to attempt to grasp 
the problems involved and bear vd th the authorities until 
solutions are found. 

The Lethbridge Herald, a little fed up with all the 
"free” things some people say we get, points to the increasing 
cost of education and remarks, "Nothing is free. Free 
education does not pay the teachers' salaries, nor buy the 
pupils' books." It all costs money. "The taxpayer pays 
the shot and the taxpayer is Y0U."1^

INEFFECTIVENESS OF PRESENT METHODS OF FINANCING- EDUCATION 

As a result of the increasing costs of education much 
criticism has been directed at present methods of educational 
finance. 

The Lethbridge Herald observes that "the weakest spot 

in our whole financial structure is our provision for 

education ." LO This is further emphasised by the Medicine 

Hat Daily News, which states: 

The whole provincial picture is one of urgency to 
provide for rapidly growing school demands; yet, 
unfortunately, it has so far been viewed with a 
hard-times mentality. 14 

"The tax base for education in Alberta is altogether 
too narrow, and cannot stand a heavier impost," claims the 
Lethbridge Herald. "Some way must be found to broaden the 
educational tax base. ?fl ^ 

Commenting on the resignation of the Sturgeon School 

Division Trustees over the non-confidence of the voters in 

educational expenditures the Edmonton Journal sees it as 

indicative of the fact that the "taxpayers cannot handle 

the burden themselves." 16 "The load must be spread." 17 

"It is manifestly inequitable to load the expense 

18 

of the increasing costs upon real estate," says the 
Medicine Hat Daily News. "In towns and cities the cost upon 
land for education Is becoming unbearable." 1 ^ »*it is time

the schools were given a new deal*" 2 ® 

Editorial feeling on this problem is summed up by the 

Medicine Hat Daily News which observes: 

Every little lift we try to give education puts 
another load on land and shelter* That is nothing 
but horse-and-buggy financing in an airplane world. 

To get money for our children's education we must 
spread the load over everybody--because everybody 
gets education in childhood and everybody benefits 
by it all through life. The increased costg of 
education must be borne by general revenue®'" 1 


GOVERNMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY 

From this belief that property is unable to finance 
education effectively has arisen an insistent demand that 
the senior governments, particularly the provincial govern¬ 
ment, assume tlir full responsibilities in this field® 

In demanding this the Lethbridge Herald explains that 
it is "merely reflecting what we are being told every day 
by property owners, both rural and urban." 22 That this is 
not just the opinion of newspaper editors is also suggested 
by the Medicine Hat Daily News which notes that the "increas¬ 
ing costs of education have given rise to a demand throughout 
the dominion for the federal and provincial governments to 
assume a greater share of these expenditures*" 2 '^ 

"Education is a matter of concern to the state as a 
whole and the standard of education must no longer be de-

termined solely by the taxable capacity of the municipal! ty, n24 
states the Edmonton Journal, With this the Medicine Hat Daily 
News is in full agreement. 

Education of the children is a dominion-wide obliga¬ 
tion which should not be wholly dependent upon the 
financial standing of a municipality or a province®^ 8 

Other editoriaIs suggest that in considering the costs 

of any business it is fair to enquire first into the question 

of who benefits as a result of the incurring of said costs 

and by whose regulations they are incurred. Outlining the 

provinces regulatory procedures the Medicine Hat Ddly News 

concludes that 

The benefits resulting from a well operated educational 
system are enjoyed not only by the school district pro¬ 
viding the facilities, but also by the municipality, 
province or federation in which the district lies® 2 ° 

Therefore, according to the Daily News, it is natural to 

expe c t tha t 

The province must assume a greater proportion of the 
costs in keeping with its regulatory interest and the 
dominion, by means of a per capita grant to the pro¬ 
vince, should have a greater stake in the educational 
training of youth® 2 ^ 

The provincial government must be made to realize, 
argues the Edmonton Journal, that the"burden of educational 
taxation presently bears unfairly on property, and that as 
education is a service both individually and as a community, 
it should be paid for by persons*" 28 "The time has come when

the provincial authority must consider a measure of 

greater assistance to the municipalities * 

The Medicine Hat Daily News aptly summarizes the 

situation when it explains: 

The crux of school costs is that senior governments 
(who impose regulations and govern curricula stan¬ 
dards ) should be more liable for the bulk of educa¬ 
tional expenditures than the property owner, 30 

INCREASED GOVERNMENT AID 

"A new approach in municipal-relations is warranted,' 1 
says the Medicine Hat Daily News, "based on the premise that 
natural resources are the property of all the people (not just 
those fortunate ones residing near the scene of occurrence), 
and dedicated to the proposition that property is now 
carrying more than its share of social service costs 
In this demand the Medicine Hat Daily News is not alone for, 
as the Edmonton Journal observes, "Requests for more pro¬ 
vincial aid for education . • • have become in recent years 
a recurring feature of relations between the two levels of 
government o 

The press urges the public to vocalize their demands, 
pointing out that "few governments are inclined to ignore 


a request when 

it can 

be shown that it 

is not 

only soundly 

based, but has 

strong 

popular support 

behind 

it," 33

Commenting on the campaign of the Lethbridge local of 

the Alberta Teachers* Association for higher grants the 

Lethbridge Herald observes: 

The teachers are on the right track* But they won*t 
succeed unless home and farm taxpayers get behind 
their efforts to arouse public opinion to demand 
that the Province bear a more realistic share of the 
educational burden* 0 ^ 

The Edmonton Journal suggests that f 'when fathers and 
mothers -- the voters —* begin wrlting letters on education 
to members of the legislature and presenting petitions and 
forming delegations, the peoples desire will be clear* ,,c ^ 

With this Hie Lethbridge Herald agrees emphatically, as it 
predicts, "Public opinion starting right from the grass roots 
will move them, and with money pouring into the Alberta 
Treasury at such a rate excuses need no longer be accepted*"^ 
All editors are in agreement in demanding "that the 
province pay half the cost of education*Characteristic 
is this statement by the Medicine Hat Daily News* n The 
province should at a minimum cover 50 per cent of the cost 
providing a basic education for our young people 0 ff 38 defend¬ 
ing this demand the Canary Herald says: 

The main argument for the 50 per cent grant, as we 
see it, is that it would put Alberta*s educational 
system on a sounder basis, and would make it possible, 
over a period of years, to build up the rural schools 
to a level at least approaching that of city schools

An attempt is made to prove that this demand is not 
restricted to the press by the Lethbridge Herald, which 
suggests, "Alberta municipalities and other organizations 
are demanding that the Provincial Government find the money 
to pay half the cost of education as is done in Prince 
Edward Island, British Columbia, and, to nearly that percent¬ 
age in Ontario*" 40 

Aware that the Alberta Educational Council has pressed 

for this for some time, and that recently a committee set 

up by the government in Manitoba recommended that the province 

pay fifty per cent of the basic operational costs of education, 

the Calgary Herald under the heading "Fifty Per Cent Should 

Come From Edmonton" suggests that 

If, however, the governments’ offended sensibilities 
prevent it from following such a course, and if It 
plans to offer nothing more consturctive than inef¬ 
fectual palliatives, then Manitoba’s lead should be 
followed* If the government will not accept the re¬ 
commendations of the Educational Council, it sh ould 
immediately appoint an adequate and competent com¬ 
mittee of legislators and find out for itself* 4 ! 

The Herald objects to what it calls "the smearing of 

42 

the Alberta Education Council by government members*" 

If the provincial government feels that it cannot 
pay 50 per cent of educational costs, then it should 
say so, and explain the reasons in a courteous and 
intelligent manner* Smearing is no reply*43 

Much criticism is directed at the present grants for

education made by the Alberta government® 

The Lethbridge Herald, while complimenting the Ontario 

government on its financial program, berates the Alberta 

government for its failure to do more® 

The Alberta Government makes excuses by telling 
us that two or three hundred thousand dollars 
more are being provided this year over last, and 
thats the end of it here® The municipalities are 
left holding the bag for between 75 and 90 per cent 
of the cost of elementary education - 92 per cent 
in Lethbridge this year* Ontario didn't haggle 
about it, but went ahead and voted 50 per cent of 
elementary education costs, including capital costs 
for new buildings* Alberta could do the same * 44 

Noticing the size of Calgary's grant the Calgary 

Albertan cries: 

If the provincial government can't do better than 
that, the public is entitled to know why* If it 
can't pay more, let it institute new taxes* Or let 
it give the municipalities new tax sources. 4 ^ 

"Alberta boasts of its school system," says the 
Lethbridge Herald, "but so far the Province hasn't done 
much towards paying for it*" 46 

Newspapers in Calgary and Edmonton charge discri¬ 
mination in the distribution of educational grants by the 
province* The Edmonton Journal observes, "The two big 
cities, Edmonton and Calgary, are not put down for their 
share*" 4 '*' "Calgary with 12 per cent of the children of the 
province, received only three per cent of government expen¬ 
ditures*" 48 claims the Calgary Albertan. Editors urge that 
the distribution be more equitable*

The general feeling of the press is expressed by the 
Calgary Herald which says, "It would be unfair to suggest that 
the provincial government has not tried to ease the school 
tax burden, but we believe it is not doing as much as it 
could and should*" 49 

Editors are in agreement that 

(Governments (which in a democracy means the people) 
have the duty of providing an adequate standard of 
education for young Canadians« The sensible division 
would be 50-50 between municipality and province in 
providing a basic education; the province responsible 
for advanced and professional forms of education; the 
dominion responsible for technical training® In brief 
the municipalities should provide the facilities 
(buildings) where training is taken; the province 
should be responsible for staff and direction insofar 
as it establishes the curriculum which must be taught; 
and the federal authority all the tools for vocational, 
technical, and trade training® The senior governments 
should pay for the frills of education, not the muni¬ 
cipal! U es o 50 

They further agree that the recommendations of the Judge 
Commission should be Implemented immediately by the provincial 
government ® 

POTENTIAL SOURCES OF REVENUE 


According to the daily newspapers of the province 

Alberta is In a very favorable position to finance larger 

expenditures for education* Characteristic of this belief 

is the Medicine Hat Daily News 1 assertion that 

This province is blessed with such an uncounted 
store of resources and wealth creating assets that

it is more than likely to end up the current 
fiscal year with the thumpingest surplus on 
record. Certainly it is in no position to 
quibble on educational grants*" 11 

M The province is in clover," 5 ^ claims the Lethbridge 


Herald* 

Many editorials suggest ways in which the gpvernment 

could raise money. Commonly mentioned is the utilization 

of liquor profits which "would be an excellent source to 

tap for increased educational grants* It is a fiscal pool 

which is hardly ever likely to run dry. 11 

Under the caption "What Divvy Prom the Boodle 11 the 

Medic&ne Hat Daily News argues that "if profits from the 

liquor trade, 7§ millions in nine months, were diverted to 

school construction needs it would relieve the urgency of 
„ 54 

overcrowding»" 

This same newspaper in another editorial points out: 

If only 50 per cent of the liquor and beer profits 
taken out of Medicine Hat were returned for educa¬ 
tional needs it would equal the 50 per cent basis - 
demanded • * as a minimum subsidy from the province« 55 

With tongue in cheek the Medicine Hat Daily News, having 

heard complaints about the government watering-down its 

liquor stock to squeeze out additional profit, observes: 

It must be difficult for a right-living government 
to justify such action. It would surely salve a 
squeamish conscience if it were known that the take 
from such an iniquitous trade were devoted to such 
a purpose as Improving educational facilities avail¬ 
able for our youth# 56

A Provincial Sales Tax, earmarked for education, has 

been proposed by some, but the majority of editorial opinion 

on this potential source of revenue is summed up by the 

Lethbridge Herald when it says: 

The chief complaint against a Provincial Sales 
Tax is that it is imposed on the cost of goods 
at retail level and tends to hurt business be¬ 
cause it bears so heavily upon many who can least 
afford to pay#57 

However, the revenue from oil is by far the most 
popular with editors as a source from which increased money 
for education could be obtained* As the Lethbridge Herald 
states it: 

If Alberta is oil rich — and the figures are proof 
that it is — then the people should share In the 
Province’s good fortune*5S 

In the opinion of the press the best way to enable the 
people to share in this good fortune is through Increasing 
educational grants* Typical is the statement, that "oil 
capital could not be.put to better use than in the building 
of new public schools 

It is pointed out by the Edmonton Bulletin, the leading 
exponent for the utili zation of oil revenues for education, 
that "prosperity in oil and parsimony in education make an 
utterly incongrous combination*" 60 

However, there is one dissenting voice, that of the 
Calgary Albertan* Under the title "Don’t Let The Oil G-o To 
Our Heads" this newspaper insists that "the Bulletin is far

off the track, not for its interest in education, but for 

expecting oil to finance education.It contends that 

Education Is like running a car* Oil is like a life 
insurance policy or war savings certificates. To 
finance the running of a car out of war savings 
certificates Is certainly not wise economics 

While others disagree, the Albertan agrees with 

government policy when it states, "Oil revenue should be 

reserved for capital purposes» 

LIMITATIONS OF FEDERAL AID 

In general, editors are in harmony with the Medicine 
Eat Daily News 1 idea that the federal government "must be 
prepared to ensure an equitable return from its largesse to 
all sections of the nation so that educational and cultural 
standards will be maintained in keeping with the country ! s 
progress and expansi on*"^ 

But, as the Edmonton Bulletin points out, there is one 
serious danger® 

If the federal share was contributed in the form of 
grants to the provinces, no difficulty would arise# 

But if the federal share was contributed directly 
to the educational machinery in the provinces, there 
might appear a sort of dual control of education 
which would be fatal to its progress.^ 

The Calgary Herald 1 s concern is apparent when it says, 
"If such aid could be given without accompanying restric¬ 
tions it would be most welcome*"^6 i s afraid that

"the ultimate result would be a federally-controlled, 

uniform system of education throughout Canada*"S’ 7 

There is something to be said for a uniform Canadian 
education if it means uniformly high standards* But 
to fix on the provinces a uniform system, a uniform 
curriculum, and a uniform procedure would be unwise* S3 

For, continues the Calgary Herald: 

No two of them have exactly similar' problems. The 
elements of education may not differ widely in any 
two provinces, but attitudes and definitions of 
education do*69 

There is no doubt, agrees the Herald, that in principle 
expanding and equalizing educational opportunity throughput 
the Dominion by means of federal aid is a splendid idea* 
However, in practice the Calgary Herald thinks it is unsat¬ 
isfactory, and in an editorial entitled "The Fallacy of 
Federal School G-rants" it claims that 

When everything is taken into account, the only 
provinces which will benefit from federal aid to 
education will be those to which it returns more 
money in the way of grants than it takes away in 
the form of taxes*70 

Where would this leave Alberta? Perhaps the Maritimes, 
Newfoundland, and Saskatchewan would benefit but "the other 
provinces would pay more than they would get out of it* ,|r ^ 
Aware that proponents of federal aid claim that the 
provincial revenue is limited, that the taxation base must 
be broadened and the cost of education spread over the whole 
Dominion, nonetheless, the Calgary Herald, while recognizing

some strength in these arguements, maintains: 

We are not prepared to accept the suggestion 
that it would do any more for education in 
Alberta than we can do ourselves.72 

"If it be true that our educational system should 

be improved, says the Herald, "Then surely we should set 

about improving it ourselves, and not wait for money to 

grow on Ottawa’s trees. 

This newspaper firmly believes that it is a "fallacy 
to campaign for federal aid in the belief that money would 
come from somewhere other than the pockets of Alberta tax¬ 
payers . 

Finally it asks, "Wouldn’t Alberta look pretty silly 
going cap-in-hand to Ottawa for federal grants, 
while all the time it has about $20,000,000 of oil 
revenues in the bank?” 

COUNTY ACT 

Although this topic will be discussed more fully in a 
later chapter, some aspects of the County Act deserve con¬ 
sideration at this time* 

Some difference of opinion exists amongst editors as 
to its value in improving the financial picture in the pro¬ 
vince. The Calgary Albertan claims "its most important 

feature is the abandonment of the financial Independence of 
76 

education." This is what worries the Galgary Herald, which 
says:

Education is always an easy target for legislators 
wielding an axe, and we are afraid that once the 
county councils got control over school spending, 
rural education in Alberta would be exceedingly 
vulnerable to thoughtless "economy 1 * measures*^ 

Meanwhile, the Lethbridge Herald, cognizant of the 

opposition to the County Act, has this to say about it® 

The fear is expressed that the county, as the 
taxing authority under the county system, might 
have too much to say about school costs and may 
take some steps towards their control® Perhaps 
the county taxpayers, who are also the school 
taxpayers, might not object®^® 

The Lethbridge paper is revealed as a supporter of 

the County Act when it remarks: 

A county system under good management, with county 
manager, county engineer, county school superin¬ 
tendent, and county assessor working in union would 
solve a lot of problems and could save a lot of 
money to the people who, through taxes on property, 
must carry practically the whole burden#*^ 

The opposing view is best summed up by the Calgary 

Herald in its editorial, "The County Plan: It Has Some 

Dangers," when it explains: 

We are inherently suspicious of any scheme to 
improve administrative convenience, since the 
term is too often synonymous with putting more 
power into official hands*80 

As a result, "education would be at the mercy of ad¬ 
ministrators if costs had to be cuto 1 ^

to such an extent that 14*04 per cent of the editorials on 
education relate directly to it# A high proportion of these 
are adversely critical# As much as one-fourth of all edi¬ 
torials relating to education in some newspapers has to do 
with the cost of education and the financial arrangements 
necessary to support it* 

Editors point with considerable frequency to the in¬ 
creasing expenditures on education, putting it in the class 
of big business# They are, on the whole, sympathetic to?;ard 
the problems facing school authorities as a result of the 
rising cost of education and are helpful to educators by 
outlining these problems to the public# 

Re-examination of the methods of financing education 
throughout the province is urged* Editors are as one in 
deploring the ineffectiveness of present methods, and in 
claiming that the present tax base should be broadened to 
reduce the tremendous burden on property and spread the 
load more equitably* 

The senior governments are rebuked for their failure 
to assume their rightful responsibilities by paying a much 
greater portion of the cost of education* Education is 
viewed as a matter of common concern to the state as a 
whole, and no longer determined by the taxable capacity of 
separate areas* 

Thus the press is insistent that the provincial govern¬ 
ment pay at least fifty per cent of the cost of education#

It attempts to arouse the public to condemn the inequit¬ 
able distribution and paucity of present government grants* 

Editors are unanimously of the opinion that the Alberta 
government is in a position to increase its allowance to 
education* This province's extremely favorable economic 
status is reviewed and potential sources of revenue, such 
as the income from oil, are indicated* 

Federal aid, while highly favored in the realm of 
technical education, is regarded as not being without its 
limitations* Some are dismayed by the uniformity and con¬ 
trol implicit in its application; others believe we have 
nothing to gain as the people of Alberta are capable of 
accomplishing just as much by themselves* 

Editors cannot agree on the financial implications of 
the County Act* In some quarters it is felt that the 
county system should be given a trial to see if it will 
reduce costs, while in others there is the conviction that 
education would suffer even greater privation under such a 
regime » 

The support of education forthcoming from the press 
seems to be genuine, and based on a secure conviction of 
the values at stake* Often there is an intelligent analy¬ 
sis , or support for, authentic measures of financial reform* 
Editors appear to be familiar with what careful students of 
educational finance have learned about the problems in con¬ 
troversy and are placing these issues squarely before the 
public *

CHAPTER IV 


HIGHER EDUCATION 

As an educational theme higher education (as dis¬ 
tinguished from elementary, secondary and vocational 
education) is by far the most popular with editors® 

Evidently the editorial mind turns more frequently to 
university matters than to those pertaining to the common 
schoolo In view of the fact that newspaper readers are 
not all college graduates, and that, in fact, the vast 
majority are probably not even high school graduates, 
this is significant® 

This predilection for higher education may perhaps 
be explained on the ground that editors themselves are 
quite often university graduates and are displaying in 
their writing a natural interest in university affairs® 

Or, it may be o wtLng, in part, to the more highly pub¬ 
licized nature of university activities® Universities 
have for many years been alive to the necessity for public 
news-giving, and many of them have definite public-relations 
programs® Has the work of these public-relations born© 
fruit in the editorial columns? Although a definite rela¬ 
tionship Is by no means established, the inference is 
indeed interesting® 

Yet, while editorial comment in this area leads all 
others In volume, the nature of the comment is disappointing® 
In terms of their significance for the theory and practice

of education only about half of these editorials are of 
valueo The remainder are mere prosaic generalizations 
having Ihe appearance of last minute ’‘fillers 1 * injected 
by editors into their columns to make a deadline• Has 
the work of publie-relations programs resulted in this 
vague artificial comment on higher education? Here too, 
the inference is interesting* 

In Table IV the proportion of editorials on higher 
education to all editorials on education is shown. It 
reveals that 28*77 per cent of these editorials deal with 
higher education. The greatest number occur in the Edmon¬ 
ton Journal which devoted 45*28 per cent of its education 
editorials to higher education. Three other newspapers, 
the Calgary Albertan, the Calgary Herald, and the-Edmonton 
Bulletin consider this same topic in more than one-fourth 
of the editorials selected from their columns for use In 
this study. 

Editorial references to higher education are summar¬ 
ized by specific topics in the order of frequency of 
mention in Table V* Few of these references are critical 
in nature « 

ITS PURPOSE AND VALUE 

Typical of the editor’s high regard for the University 
of Alberta is an editorial which appeared in the Edmonton 
Journal on the occasion of the university’s fortieth year

of operation. This editorial observes that one cannot over¬ 
estimate its contribution to the province* 


It has provided Alberta with an ever-increasing 
proportion of those properly trained professional 
men and women • * • upon which a modern community 
depends•^ 


More than this, claims the Journal: 

It has directly through Its extension department, 
and indirectly through the influence of its gra¬ 
duates -- done more than almost any other institu¬ 
tion to raise the cultural standards of the pro¬ 
vince «^ 

The majority of editors are convinced "the very 
nature of our political structure demands that education 
be as nearly universal as money and opportunity can make 
it." 3 And, as the Edmonton Bulletin observes, that "a 
high university registration is, in a general way, a baro¬ 
meter of social, economic and political virility#" 4 


Yet this same newspaper, aware of increased university 
enrolments, and claiming that only thirty-six per cent of 
the university graduates in the country are using their 
degree, remarks: 

To scatter university degrees around like sheepskin 
confetti appears to be a tragic waste. There can be 
too much university®^ 

It is quick to add, however, that 

This is not written in criticism of higher education. 
But it is written in the throes of a grave doubt 
that the business of handing out degrees, like turn¬ 
ing the crank on a colossal sausage machine, is in 
the best interests either of society or of young men 
and women® 0

Comments like the foregoing are not common. Ii the 
main, the press recognizes and attests to the values ac¬ 
cruing from a university education. They do, though, 
warn that "a college degree is not an open sesame to 


success in life."^ It is more exactly “a stepping-stone 
in that direction.As the Calgary Albertan puts it: 


"Education is its own reward, but taken alone will not 



The daily newspapers of the province appear genuinely 
concerned over the emphasis on the more material aspects 
of education In our universities. Characteristic of this 
concern are comments like the following: 

A great deal is being done to cultivate youth’s 
intelligence. What is being done to cultivate 
youth’s spiritual qualities? And yet the latter 
are far more essential than 'the former. 

There can be no education without spiritual growth. 
Mental capacity takes second place to spiritual 
capacity 

"Unless a univeisity ... is able to develop charac¬ 
ter and Christian principles in those whom it attempts to 
teach," the Edmonton Bulletin maintains, "it must admit 
failure." 12 But when criticism is leveled at universities, 
and their students, as having fallen into a "moral vacuum", 
the Bulletin claims it is utterly false. "The truth is that 
university students are no better and no worse than the age 
itself." 1 3

A common editorial text is that "the present-day uni¬ 
versity graduate too often tends to be merely a narrow 
specialist, with little knowledge or interest beyond the 
limits of his specialty. u1 ^ Deploring "the technical empha¬ 
sis which excludes all else," the Edmonton Journal asks, 
"How many students . . . in our universities are encouraged 
to think things out, to make their own conclusions?" 1 ^ The 
scarcity of such students means "we are paying the penalty 
in a dire lack of leadership." 1 ^ 

For this specialization the universities' themselves 
are not solely held responsible. 

Modern business, industrial and professional life 
demands specialists. The graduate must meet the 
requirements -- ostensibly set by the university, 
but actually set by those who will eventually 
employ him -- or he is presumed to lack professional 
standing. 1 7 

While realizing "todays world will not permit a les¬ 
sening of technical ability; on the contrary it will demand 
more and more of it." 1 ^ the daily newspapers agree that 
higher education has another purpose other than merely 
technical training. 

This purpose is the training of the mind to think 
intelligently, and the provision of a wide back¬ 
ground of general information and experience for 
the material upon which such trained minds may 
operate. 1 ^ 

Or, putting it another way: 

The prime function of a university is to arrange

and describe the important currents of thought, 
both past and present, so the student can appraise 
them and form his own enlightened opinion. 2 ^ 

Therefore,more attention must be paid to cultural 

education. For as the Edmonton Journal explains: 

It Is important that from our -universities there 
should flow a constant and ever broadening stream 
of complete men and women, in whom technical com¬ 
petence is balanced by spiritual awareness. 21 

The achieving of such a harmonious balance is re¬ 
garded as ’’perhaps the greatest problem of modern educa¬ 
tion." 22 Alberta educators are revealed, by the Edmonton 
Bulletin, 2 ^ as being cognizant of this problem, and it is 
further pointed out that the University of Alberta*s ex¬ 
pansion program is aimed at blending the cultural and the 
practical aspects of education. 

As a result of the editors* evident belief that 
higher education must not just be learning to make a 
living, a suggestion by the Alberta School Trustees* Assoc¬ 
iation that technical electives in grade twelve be substi¬ 
tuted for a second language in the matriculant requirements 
for university entrance is not approved. 

Nor does a request by real estate men in the province 
asking the University of Alberta to include a course in 
real estate in its curriculum find any supporter amongst 
the daily newspapers. "Is this the responsibility of a 
university?" asks the Calgary Herald. "We think not." 2 ^

Concluding this editorial, which is entitled “Uni¬ 
versities Must Educate, Not Train,“ this newspaper suggests 
that with many types of so-called education: 

There is a point . • . where the cultural aspect 
wears so thin it is no longer a disguise* Beyond 
that point the emphasis is strictly on training, 
not on education* There the function of a univer¬ 
sity ends —or it extends to barber colleges and 
academies of tinsmithing. 2 5 

CURRICULUM AND METHODS 

While editors are loquacious when considering the 
value and purpose of a university education, they are, 
by comparison quite reticent in making positive comments 
on specific subjects which they feel should, or should 
not, be taught. Only fourteen out of the 256 editorials 
on higher education deal directly with course offerings. 

The University of Alberta is praised for inaugurating 
a course in petroleum engineering. Such a course, it is 
explained, “will fill a long-felt want, both of the oil 
industry and of ambitious students." 2 ® And when the first 
class of these engineers graduated in 1950 the Lethbridge 
Herald adds, . .the University is to be commended. . . 
it had a responsibility and met it." 2 ^ 

However, the introduction of a physical education 
school is not unanimously approved. Some feel it is con¬ 
sistent wild the “wide aim of education” 2 ® which "is to

develop a useful mind in a useful body."29 others, 
notably the Edmonton Journal, consider it ill-advised 
and suggest that existing faculties be strengthened 
first. It is drawn to the attention of the university 
authorities that 

The besetting weakness of all western universities. . 
has been the tendency to multiply subjects and 
courses of study, in a vain effort to offer instruc¬ 
tion in eyery branch of knowledge taught at the 
larger and wealthier universities of eastern Canada 
and the United States.30 

It is argued further that this is now generally recog¬ 
nized as a mistake. "The true road of distinction for a 
small college lies in concentrating on a few faculties and 
making them the equal of any. "31 

The proposed establishment of a chair of social credit 
at the University of Alberta is violently opposed on the 
ground-s that "politics should be kept out of universities."32 
Commenting on this the Calgary Herald sarcastically remarks: 
"Any university professor, no matter how gifted, would have 
a difficult task to explain social credit."^3 

Some newspapers expressed the belief that courses should 
be offered 3n communism,^ electronics,35 social work,36 and 
psychiatry.37 

Restricted registration of medical and dental students 
is scored by the Edmonton newspapers. Under the heading

"Physicians Needed"^ the Edmonton Bullet to wonders why 

with such a great demand for doctors the University does 

not expand its facilities and train more of them. Another 

editorial^ hints that the Medical Association is exerting 

pressure to keep the enrolment down. The Edmonton Journal 

berates the medical, dental, and other professions for 

restricting membership because of what it claims is "fear 

of personal competition."^® 

The various professional groups, in collaboration 
with educational authorities, have set high stan¬ 
dards in the required qualifications. The young 
man or woman who spends years in preparation and 
meets them should not require further "screening". 

Nor should attempts be made to divert them from 
their purpose, either through the creation of un¬ 
natural artificial barriers during their schooling, 
or by talk by their elders of there being no room 
for them. 2 * 1 

Actual instructional technique is also criticized. 

The Calgary Albertan and the Edmonton Journal join in 
denouncing "excessive note-taking in university class¬ 
rooms." 2 * 2 4 Claiming "the fault lies more often with the 
lecturer than the studentthe Albertan observes: 

Too many professors want to give an uninterrupted 
address, sometimes even a reading. They put some¬ 
thing on paper, recite it to the class and expect 
the class to put it verbatim on paper, and call 
that a lecture. 2 * 1 

This "is not education. ,,2 *5 it should be required 

of every professor that if he prepares his work on paper; 

... he put his basic course in writing and dis¬ 
tribute it to the class so that the valuable class-

room time may be devoted to something more than 
a stenographic dictation exercise,4-6 

A considerable number of editorials discuss, in very 

general, and favorable terms, graduates, convocation, and 

honorary degrees. G-raduates are urged to make the most of 

the many opportunities available in Canada, and particularly 

in Alberta. The university is complimented on the high 

calibre of the men and women it selects to honor each year 

at convocation by bestowing honorary degrees upon them. 

FINANCING- UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 

Editors are well aware of the increasing cost of 
operating the University of Alberta. The Lethbridge 
Herald explains "that another million dollars a year in 
revenue is needed if the University is to fulfill its 
task as Alberta's institution of higher learning." 4 7 

The province is urged to come to the assistance of 
the university. "Alberta is one of the wealthiest pro¬ 
vinces per capita, in the Dominion,"^® points out the 
Calgary Herald. 

Clearly the province is able to help the university 
in its financial dilemma if it wants to. Charity, 
it may be pointed out, begins at home .^9 

This newspaper is of the opinion that universities 

created by provincial governments have no valid claim for 

federal aid as compared with those that depend largely on

fees and private donations. The Edmonton Journal believes 
that “only on the grounds of raising the whole level would 
national intervention be justified.“50 Even then, this 
newspaper is wary of the uniformity federal aid implies. 

Another aspect worries the Calgary Herald. It explains 
that “once any government subscribes part of the cost of 
maintaining a university, it feels it is entitled to some 
say in administration.” And, adds the Herald, 11 . . . the 
results are not invariably happy.“5 1 j n general, the press, 
while favoring provincial aid, is wary of federal aid for 
higher education. 

Ideas of increased tuition fees are favorably received 

by editors. As the Edmonton Bulletin puts it: 

. . . since at least half of the social, financial 
and other benefits of higher education are enjoyed 
by the individual who receives it, he or she should 
surely pay more than one-third of the cost.52 

The Edmonton Journal writing under the heading “Degrees 

Cost Less Here” 53 draws attention to the fact that despite 

recent increases Alberta's fees are still the lowest of 

the four western universities. 

Significant is this statement by the Edmonton Bulletin: 

“Every increase in fees should be balanced by a corresponding 

increase in scholarships for use of brilliant students of 

slight personal means.“5^ it sums up a province-wide plea 

by the press for more scholarships so that no deserving

student has to be deprived of a university education for 
lack of money. 

It is felt that some of these scholarships should 

come from the senior government. 

After all, the state, through heavy personal income, 
succession duty, and gift taxation has almost wiped 
out private endowment of scholarship. The state, 
therefore, should not hesitate to use a small part 
of its tax revenues for such purposes, especially 
in a province where the only university is a state 

institution.55 

Other scholarships should be forthcoming from business 
and industry, in partial payment of their tremendous debt 
to education. One editorial castigates business concerns, 
which are directly dependent upon our university graduates, 
for being "niggardly in their direct support of higher edu¬ 
cation. "56 

All donors of present scholarships are roundly praised 
and encouraged to contribute even more. For, as the Edmon¬ 
ton Bulletin indicates: 

... no more benign use can be made of money than 
to afford educational facilities for promising young 
men and women.57 

UNIVERSITY EXPANSION 


The daily newspapers of the province, while wary of 
some of the implications of government aid, nonetheless 
believe that greater expenditures are necessary by the

senior governments on university accommodation and facili¬ 
ties to provide greater opportunities for the training of 
highly-skilled personnel, thereby making it possible for 
Canadian youth to be in a position to take advantage of 
future openings in the unfolding industrial development of 
this country. However, as the Medicine Hat Daily Mews 
points out, this will take some urging. 

Unless the people demand expansion of educational 
opportunities to meet the needs of the great ma¬ 
jority of our youth then we may expect no great 
initiative on the part of governmental leaders 
toward this end. 58 

Noticing the building programs now underway at Cana¬ 
dian universities with their emphasis on medical, engin¬ 
eering and research laboratories the Edmonton Journal 
comments: 


. • . these figures supply one more proof that we 
are drifting away from the old idea of a university 
as a place for developing mind and character to the 
modern notion that it exists merely to train people 
to do specific jobs. 59 

Again the cry goes up for increased cultural educa¬ 
tion and less technical education. 

In considering the expansion of university facilities 
in this province the press naturally turns to a discussion 
of branch universities. Whether or not a branch of the 
University of Alberta should be established in the southern 
part of the province is indeed the most contentious issue 
of higher education in Alberta.

To clarify the problem, the editorial comment of 

each daily newspaper will first be considered separately, 

following which a collective assessment will be made. 

The Calgary Albertan, commenting on Dr. Newton's 

statement that more persons were enrolled in freshmen 

classes than could be carried through senior years with 

existing facilities, starts the ball rolling. 

The usual argument against a Calgary Branch is that 
it would mean overlapping of services. That argu¬ 
ment is meaningless. Present facilities . . . are 
inadequate to deal with the present multitude in 
virtually every department of the institution. 
Professors are badly overworked.60 

"Duplication of services must start somewhere," claims 
the Albertan. "The time is now. The pls.ce is Calgary."61 
This paper, aware of Edmonton's reported income of 
four million dollars a year from the University, points out 
that were a Calgary branch able to absorb even one-quarter 
of next years estimated registration it would give the city 
close to a million-dollar-a-year industry. "Merely from 
a dollars and cents point of view, it would pay Calgary's 
business men to do a little tub thumping for a branch of 
the university here."62 

It is pointed out that "Calgary is the only one of 
thirteen cities in Canada with more than 60,000 population 
. • . which does not have a full and complete university.

Editorials captioned “All Calgary Asks Is A Fair 

Deal" 6^ and "Calgary Parents Would Save Thousands 

discount the financial barriers which the government 

claim exist. This newspaper notes that certain basic 

courses have several sections and that the cost of having 

one or two of these sections in Calgary is not much more 

than in Edmonton. These courses would be the nucleus of 

a university branch. Further, it is claimed, that students 

of the area would save perhaps § 50,000 a year. 

Calgary is not asking for a duplication of every¬ 
thing Edmonton has. All it wants is a chance to 
save money gn the first year or so of a college 
education. 

The Calgary Herald voices its opinions about a branch 
university more sharply. An §800,000 building expenditure 
for the University of Alberta appearing in the 194? provin¬ 
cial budget occasions this remark: 

It should now be quite clear that the government 
intends to give Edmonton a complete monopoly on 
all university facilities, without any consider¬ 
ation for the needs of Calgary and the southern 
part of the province generally.67 

"This policy of centralization - so sharply different 
from Social Credit professions - should be strongly resisted,"63 
cautions the Herald. Centralization "from the standpoint of 
higher education . . . is . . . serious and . . . ludicrous."69 
The provincial government is not practising the decentraliz¬ 
ation it preaches, argues this newspaper. "The public school, 
the high school and university continues to be dominated by

the pooh-bahs in Edmonton.Unless the government alters 
its policy the Herald is afraid that “hundreds of Southern 
Alberta students will never see university, except on a 
picture post-card."^l 

When in 1948 a motion was defeated in the legislature 
asking for consideration of the establishment of a univer¬ 
sity branch in Calgary, this daily argues: 

Calgary may, at the moment, lack some of the 
* physical facilities for establishing a branch 
university, but that is a poor excuse for the 
governments refusal even to give the matter 
consideration. 

The statement made by Mr. Percy Page in the legis¬ 
lature to the effect that a degree from a small university 
is not equivalent to a degree from a larger university 
causes the Herald to retort: 

Size has little to do with the academic standing 
of any university. The quality and experience 
of the professorial staff, the ratio of the library 
and laboratory facilities to the number of students, 
and the requirements for graduation are the real 
determining factors. Indeed, these factors being 
equal in big and small universities, the latter is 
likely to turn out better educated graduates, because 
more individual tuition can be given in small classes. 

Finally, rather resignedly, it urges that junior 

courses be established immediately as it is convinced 

nothing more can be expected from the present government. 

The Lethbridge Herald adopts substantially the same 

attitude. “While we favor the concentration of the academic

courses at Edmonton, and the specialized courses too, in 
certain professions, we do think it is time the rest of 
the province was given a break. “7^ The break this news¬ 
paper wants is a junior college in Lethbridge offering 
the first two years of university, while at the same time 
providing training in subjects such as agriculture and 
mechanics to those desirous of more education, but not 
education of a professional nature. 

Centralization “is the one weakness of our educa¬ 
tional set-up in Alberta ,"75 states the Lethbridge Herald, 
adding its voice to that of the Calgary Herald. "What we 
need in Alberta is a spread of the institutions of higher 
learning. 

The Edmonton papers are decidedly against the estab¬ 
lishment of a branch university. It should be thoroughly 
understood, explains the Edmonton Bulletin, that a branch 
of a university is not a university any more than a single 
limb of a tree is a whole tree. “And university education 
cannot be dispatched to outlying points like soup or soap.“^ 
It agrees that instructors could be sent to Calgary, 
that some knowledge and facts would be acquired by students. 
“But neither knowledge or facts are education. It is aca-

tical knowledge into the heads of the young, A good 
university is a tradition. It teaches, not only a tech¬ 
nique for making a living, but also a way of life. It is 
useful, not only because it hands out facts, but because 
it provides close intellectual association with men whose 
personalities and leadership are a wholesome inspiration to 
youth. 

"These are things which cannot be spread out too thin," 
observes the Bulletin. "You cannot split up a great teacher 
into several parts. 

"One would think then," it suggests, "that the ten¬ 
dency would be towards fewer and greater universities 

OQ 

instead of towards more mediocre ones." 0 

With this opinion the Edmonton Journal concurs whole¬ 
heartedly: "Wot until Alberta has built one good university 

0*1 

should it consider starting a second." 

The Medicine Hat Daily News, while agreeing that uni¬ 
versity facilities should be extended, is more interested 
in an equalization of university costs. It believes 

. . . transportation costs should be equalized by 
pooling and ... a system of residence and sub¬ 
sistence be worked out which would approximate the 
costs for a student living at home. 

By way of recapitulation, it can be said that the 

Calgary newspapers definitely favor the establishment of a 

branch university in Calgary; the Lethbridge Herald is

desirous of a junior college in Lethbridge offering train¬

years of university; the Medicine Hat Daily News agrees 
in principle with branch universities, but does not openly 
demand their existence; and the Edmonton newspapers are

facilities* 


PERSONNEL 


A considerable number of editorials appear in the 

columns of the daily newspapers of the province dealing with 

individual educators connected presently, or in the past, 

with the University of Alberta. These are all written in 

a laudatory manner, wherein the individual is recognized 

for his contributions to education. The following two 

statements are illustrative of this type of comment: 

Thousands knew him as a kindly and helpful official, 
and as a brilliant teacher who could make intelligible 
the mazes of Modern European history. 3 

His contribution to education in this province cannot 
be overestimated and his loss will be deeply felt.84 

The selection of a new president for the university 

elicits an editorial entitled "The Kind of Man the University 

Needs” from the Calgary Herald, stating: 

One of the shortcomings of the university in the past 
few years has been its comparative remoteness from 
the public life of Alberta. The university has not 
made itself a continuing and influential part of the 
ordinary life of Alberta.

This newspaper believes that a man should be selected 
who can bring the university to the people. The Edmonton 
Bulletin directs attention to “the present American theorem 
. . • that administrative ability is more essential in a 
university president than scholarship,” and suggests, “the 

idea is worth consideration.”^ 

When Dean Andrew Stewart was appointed to the presi¬ 
dency of the University of Alberta the Lethbridge Herald 
comments: 

Professor Stewart is the right man for a big job. 

He will bring to it a keen mind, a background of 
Scottish thrift, and a realism regarding the pro¬ 
blems to be faced. 

The Calgary Albertan is in full agreement. 

We can think of no person better equipped to direct 
the affairs of the University of Alberta and to 
integrate it with the community.88 

A slight flurry of activity occurs among editors 
when Dr. George Hunter is dismissed from the university 
for allegedly carrying on political activity in the class¬ 
room. The Calgary Albertan®^ feels the authorities were 
justified in their action and the case should be considered 
closed. However, such is not the case with the Calgary 
Herald. 

The whole affair smacks far too much of witch- 
hunting for our liking. It we are so seriously 
lacking in faith in our form of democracy that 
we are afraid to let university students be 
exposed to heterodox ideas — assuming that Dr.

51 


Hunter's views were really heterodox — then we 
do not deserve the freedom which our ancestors 
bequeathed to us. 90 

This newspaper further suggests that if the Univer¬ 
sity of Alberta is afraid to allow anything except a 
narrow political orthodoxy to be discussed in its lecture 
rooms, then it does not deserve the name university at 
all. The only question of any consequence is "whether 
Dr. Hunter is a good biochemist, and whether his poli¬ 
tical views, whatever they were, made any difference to 
his qualifications to teach the subject. "91 

Under the caption "Undoubtedly Necessary" the Leth¬ 
bridge Herald upholds the professor's dismissal. Pointing 
out that in a free country men have a right to say what 
they think, as long as they are not breaking the law. 

"But their freedom certainly does not allow them to use 
up their employers' time to spout their own personal 
political views.Professor Hunter was apparently doing 
this and therefore deserved to be dismissed, concludes 
this paper. 

"That Red Herring Smell" is the title of the Medi¬ 
cine Hat Daily News" editorial on this subject. "The 
whole question is one of extreme importance and one 
charged with danger. "93 Although this newspaper has not 
use for Communists, it is worried lest in our haste to

destroy the threat they pose, the virtues of the very 

system we are trying to preserve may perish* 

Universities are supposed to be based on the 
foundation of intellectual freedom. Just how 
far we can go in curbing the tongues of our 
professors and still call our universities 
free we can't say. 94 

The Daily News feels that the recent action of the 
university board of governors smells a little like some¬ 
thing that has been happening under communist rule, which 
we profess to detest. “Surely," it argues, "we can be 
consistent and honest and still be safe."95 

One newspaper censures university professors for 
failing, as a group, to raise their status in the eyes of 
the public. 

It is unfortunate but true that university pro¬ 
fessors the world over are greeted on far too many 
occasions with suspicion or even derision. 95 

This daily, the Lethbridge Herald, observes that 
less learned people criticize professors because they 
often claim they detect communist leanings, or laugh at 
them because they think they're absent-minded. Attention 
is drawn to the fact that actually the university professor 
is a fairly normal person with well above-average intelli¬ 
gence doing as good a job as he can teaching other people's 
children. He can't help it if other people are jealous of 
his intellectual accomplishments, but he can help his

general reputation, “if he keeps the stuffed shirts 
among his colleagues from making fools of themselves and 
the profession they represent.“97 

STUDENTS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS 

Some educators claim that lately the calibre of uni¬ 
versity freshmen has been worse than ever. This is depre¬ 
cated by the Edmonton Journal 98 which claims the students 
of today are the equal of their predecessors. Any change 
is attributed to weaknesses in our educational system and 
our teaching. In fact, it is pointed out, some of the 
blame likely lies with the very educators who claim that 
the students are deteriorating. 

This support of university students is characteristic 
of the general feeling evident in all sections of the press. 
University students are considered “no better and no worse 
than the age itself.“99 jt is the conviction that they have 
much criticism levied at them because an “ounce of radica¬ 
lism in a college receives more publicity than a pound of 
red revolution elsewhere. 1,100 Commenting on inter-faculty 
brawls, the Calgary Albertan states, "It is pleasant to 
think that once more a crowd of young and healthy youngsters 
can stage a good, rowdy, idiotic rough-house without impen¬ 
ding a war effort or breaking a defence law." 101

However, editorials such as "What’s University For” 102 

and "Hard Work At The University"are quick to remind 

students that the university was established to provide 

cultural and technical education, and is not just a place 

to learn social skills. Students are expected by the press 

to earn their degrees through hard work. 

Alarm is expressed at the casualities in first year 

university and the following suggestion is made: 

Perhaps if greater attention were paid to firing 
the first year students interest and ambition in 
what he can learn at the university, and to giving 
some thought to his "bent" and to what he might do 
best, second and third yea.r classes would be much 
larger than they are. 10 ^ 

Judging by the number of editorials on the subject 

the press is greatly interested in political activity 

amongst university students. Political activity is approved 

by some on the basis that university graduates should be 

prepared to supply leadership in our democratic society and 

need a knowledge of politics to do so. 

Political clubs sponsored by political parties 
could bring university students into closer 
touch with the business world. They could pro¬ 
vide a new zest for a flagging interest in demo¬ 
cratic institutions. They could provide our 0£ _ 
political parties with young and able leaders. J 

Organizations like the Mock Parliament and the Poli¬ 
tical Science club are praised by the Calgary Albertan, 10 ^ 

107 

and the Edmonton Journal.

However, the Edmonton Bulletin has a different point 
of view. It claims n the taxpayers of Canada pay for pro¬ 
vincial universities so that young men and young women may 

108 

acquire education, not so that they may play politics . 11 

Political clubs and Mock Parliaments areobjected to on 
the grounds that they reveal "some of the lowest aspects of 
politics rather than the highest.” 10 ^ This daily, while 
admitting of the value of political knowledge to students, 
is critical of the present manner in which this knowledge 
is obtained, yet offers no alternative method for achieving 
an understanding of politics. 

Many editorials deal with the student veteran and his 
problems, and various student organizations and their pro¬ 
blems. This comment, however, is scattered and inconclu¬ 
sive, and scarcely merits inclusion in this study. 

SUMMARY 

In quantity the editorial comment on higher education 
far exceeds that on any other topic. In quality, however, 
it does not. A large percentage of the editorials state 
mere platitudes of little significance for this study. 

The press of the province, while appreciative of uni¬ 
versity education, alleges that it is overspecialized. It 
is felt that too much emphasis is being placed on technical 


108 EB, 2.26.7 
109 EB, 2 . 4.8 









56 . 


training with a resultant neglect of the cultural aspects 
of education. The university is reminded that its function 
is to educate, not merely to turn out highly-skilled tech¬ 
nicians. Editors vigorously urge a revision of higher 
education placing greater stress on the cultural, or spir¬ 
itual, phases of learning to achieve a better balanced, 
more rounded education. They fail, however, to make any 
significant suggestions regarding course offerings. 

Restrictions imposed by some faculties on the number, 
and type, of students that can be enrolled each year are 
disparaged by the daily newspapers of the province. They 
feel that a genuine need exists for all professional 
services and that facilities should be expanded to over¬ 
come this deficiency. Professional pressure groups which 
foster such restrictive practices are chastized. 

The method of instruction at most universities comes 
under the scrutiny of some sections of the press who 
deplore the excessive note-taking it makes necessary. 
Uninterrupted addresses by professors and verbatim 
copying by students are not these newspapers idea of 
education. It is suggested that professors who prepare 
their work on paper should have it mimeographed and dis¬ 
tributed to the class in advance, and then the lecture 
period could be devoted to an elaboration or discussion 
of the prepared statement. 

Editors are well-aware of the need of universities

to increase their revenue if they are to continue to ful¬ 
fill their obligation to society. Generally, it is believed 
that the provincial government should come to the assistance 
of the University of Alberta by means of increased grants. 
Federal aid is not considered advisable because of its 
restrictive uniformity. Increased fees, though approved, 
are conceived as merely nibbling at the problem of increased 
costs. 

A concerted effort to increase the number of scholar¬ 
ships available to deserving students is evident. Govern¬ 
ments, private individuals, business and industry are all 
urged to contribute so that no worthy students of little 
means are deprived of a university education. 

An expansion of university facilities is proposed. To 
the newspapers in the southern part of the province this 
means decentralization, with the establishment of a branch 
university in the south; to the northern newspapers this 
means the expansion of existing facilities. The nature of 
the extension of university facilities is the most contro¬ 
versial issue in higher education. 

University professors are highly admired. The many 
lauditory references appearing in editorial columns are 
evidence of this. The press, while respecting their pol¬ 
itical freedom, is divided as to their right to expound 
personal political beliefs in the lecture-room. Criti-

cism of their actions occurred in but one paper, which 
deplored the failure of professors, as a group, to raise 
their status in the eyes of the general public. 

Support is forthcoming for students and their prob¬ 
lems as well. Students of today are viewed as no better, 
or no worse than those of past generations, and criticism 
that they are is ridiculed. They are cautioned, however, 
by editors, not to let the social aspects of university 
life overshadow their studies. Some political activity on 
the part of students is supported, but what form such 
activity should take cannot be agreed upon. 

Student organizations, student veterans, graduation, 
convocation, and honorary degrees are subjects for a good 
many editorials. Comment is generally favorable, but not 
too important.

CHAPTER V 
ADMINISTRATION 

School boards, administrators, the County Act, and 
various administrative procedures are dealt with in six 
per cent of the editorials on education appearing in the 
daily newspapers of the province. The Calgary Albertan 
devotes a greater amount of space to a discussion of these 
topics than any other newspaper considered in this study. 

In volume of editorial comment administration holds 
no significant position. But in this comment are issues of 
sufficient import to educators to justify their considera¬ 
tion in this chapter. 

SCHOOL BOARDS AND THEIR POLICIES 

In the main, editorial comment on school boards and 
their policies is favorable. Editors are quick to note 
that 

Managing the affairs of one of Alberta*s large 
consolidated school divisions today is a big 
business that makes heavy demands upon the 
intelligence, resources and time of the division 
trustees and all their staff. 1 

The following statements indicate that the press 
feels the school boards are doing a commendable job despite 
the many problems occasioned by the need for a rapid expan- 

1 EJ, 10.24.9 








62 


sion of educational facilities. 

The school hoard has handled its planning chore 
in a restrained and constructive manner and merits 
the support of all residents in their endeavor to 
provide for our expanding populace without any 
sudden impact on the tax structure. 

Members of the school board are to be congratulated 
on their awareness of their responsibilities. . .3 

The management of our schools is, we suggest, in 
good hands . . .^ 

The school board has always tackled its responsibil¬ 
ities in a fearless and progressive manner. 5 

* • • it can be said that the School Board, without 
being extravagant, gives thorough and. non-partisan 
attention to the business of operating Calgary 
schools.6 

The city is fortunate in having the benefit of the 
services, given voluntarily, of present trustee 
representatives.7 

Adherence to the tradition that in a democratic 
system of education final authority for the schools rests 
in the public representatives who make up the personnel 
of school boards is evident in the support found in the 
press for ’’home rule,” For example, when a bill is intro¬ 
duced in the provincial legislature to permit the Minister 
of Education to fire school board secretaries of whom he 
disapproves, a volley of criticism bursts forth. 

It should be clearly understood by the provincial 
government and shouted to the housetops by the 
people of this province that the province has no 
right to interfere in local governments. The

province has no more authority, morally or 
legally, to pass on the secretary of a school 
district than it has on the city clerk of Calgary.° 

The foregoing statement by the Calgary Albertan, is 
emphatically endorsed by the Edmonton Journal. This news¬ 
paper in calling for an explanation by the government of 
its action suggests: 

The minister might also expand his answers to 
include a statement on just how much ’’home rule” 
his department intends to leave to school trustee 
boards. From all accounts, they do receive a 
tremendous amount of “guidance” if too few provin¬ 
cial dollars.^ 

"Dangerous Precedent” is the title of an editorial 
appearing in the Lethbridge Herald on this topic. It 
accuses the Minister and the Department of Education of 
setting aside the school board and making it a rubber 
stamp for carrying out the orders of the government. 

’’Home rule apparently means nothing with Education Minis¬ 
ter Ansley,”^® claims the Herald. 

Indeed, home rule in school matters has almost dis¬ 
appeared under Social Credit which has been carrying 
on with a high hand for the past decade.H 

Such a practice is viewed as being “on the road to 

totalitarianism.” Furthermore: 

... it musn’t be allowed to develop in Alberta, 
and if Alberta legislators are worth their salt 
they will see to it that conditions are set up to 
curb such wide and unwarranted powers as the Minis¬ 
ter of Education has assumed.^ 2 

As a result of public opposition, in x^hich the press

64 


took the leading role, the government eventually with¬ 
drew this bill. 

A later pie ce of legislation, which restored to 
school boards the right to dismiss a principal or vice¬ 
principal, is championed by the Calgary Albertan over 
teacher opposition. 

Although the school boards, particularly in small 
towns and in rural districts, can and often do 
judge their teachers unfairly, still they are the 
hiring authorities. They pay most of the wages. 
Surely it is not asking too much to give the people 
who do the hiring and pay the bill the right to do 
the firing.13 

However, opposition to this move is apparent in one 
newspaper, the Calgary Herald, which thinks it is a bad 
policy. 

This change is a serious step away from academic 
freedom. It puts principals largely at the mercy 
of school boards — which, in rural districts parti¬ 
cularly may be uncomfortable for them.^ 

This statement is characteristic of the Herald 1 s 

belief that ”in recent years school boards have tended to 

abuse their independence,”"^ 

Nor is this newspaper alone in its criticism of 

school board policies, for although the press staunchly 

supports school boards in most instances, editors do not 

hesitate to condemn them when they feel such action is 

warranted.

The Calgary School Board’s practice of "secret, 

closed committee sessions"in which, it is claimed, 

the major portion of the school business is conducted, 

precipitates a series of disparaging editorials in the 

Calgary Albertan. This newspaper notes that M secrecy 

surrounding the spending of public money . . . irritates 

any citizen interested in the welfare of education. nl 7 

It is charged that such practices are M a very serious 

lapse in public responsibility." 1 ^ Urging that all 

school board meetings be open to the public the Albertan 

bitingly remarks, "What is good enough for the Supreme 

Court of Canada surely ought to be good enough for the 

Calgary Public School Board. n1 ^ 

Evidence that this newspaper will continue its fight 

against secrecy at board meetings is contained in this 

excerpt from an editorial entitled "Asking for Criticism": 

. . • criticism of the board is being asked for by 
the board members themselves and will continue to 
be until they Qhange their viewpoint and discontinue 
to operate with such secrecy. 20 

On another issue — the provision of health services in 
Calgary Schools — the Albertan is joined by the city’s other 
newspaper, the Herald, as it launches a further stream of 
criticism. Both newspapers, in editorials bearing captions 
such as "Time To End This Civic Bickering" 21 or "An Unten-

able Situation”, 22 chastize the school board for its 
failure to reach agreement with the city health depart¬ 
ment on the question of which agency will provide health 
services for Calgary's school children. 

The Edmonton Journal expresses alarm at an amendment 
to the School Act allowing school trustees to pay them¬ 
selves for services rendered to education. Claiming this 
is a bad precedent it says: 

We hope the day will never come when all forms of 
community service will carry a price tag. 2 3 

Finally, the Calgary Herald raises an interesting 

point when it says: 

. . . whether the law which compels every parent 
to send his children to school also lays on school 
boards an irrevocable duty to educate — or rather, 
attempt to educate — those children until they are 
15 , or whatever the school leaving age happens to 
be, and to go on attempting to educate them long 
after it has become clear that the effort is a 
waste of public money. 2 ^ 

This newspaper feels that the schools are better off 
without such students and should not be obligated to 
attempt to supply education once it has been proven to be 
futile. 


THE COUNTY ACT 


Of the four daily newspapers commenting directly on 
the County Act, two definitely oppose it, one appears to 


22 CA, 5.10.0 
23 EJ, 3.28.6 


CH, 3.30.9 




67 


favor it, while the other, after giving it initial approval, 

later becomes critical of it. 

From the very moment it was first proposed the Edmonton 

Journal opposed the County Act because it felt that 

The separation of education is an important essential 
in the decentralization which is one of the great 
strengths of our present system of municipal govern¬ 
ment . 25 

It is worried lest 

. . • provincial ministers and officials, impressed 
by their heavier dollar contribution to the cause, 
may come to feel that this should be accompanied by 
more centralized control and more detailed provincial 
direction of education, to the subsequent detriment 
of the diversity which gives unity its vitality. 

Attention is drawn to the fact that the Act contains 

no provision for dealing with minority schools. The 

Journal wonders if the sponsors figure that both budgets 

will be handled by one council and implies that such a 

practice will lead to racial and religious conflict. It 

suggests that the bill "be withdrawn until such time as 

there is a bona fide public demand for such a measure." 2 ^ 

When the County Act was passed this newspaper notes 

that the threat to decentralization is now something "more 

o o 

than potential."^ 0 It remarks: 

. . . Albertans will wonder if their province, which 
has given Canada much leadership in education, is now 
going to go, mistakenly, against the general trend. 2 9 

The Calgary Albertan concurs with the opinions expressed

by the Edmonton Journal, Typical is its reaction to the 

statement by Mayor Don MacKay that he sees a growing 

feeling to abolish school boards in favor of a director 

of education responsible to the municipal council. 

Separation of school administration from municipal 
administration has long been taken for granted in 
Alberta. If Mayor Don MacKay sees a "growing feeling" 
to abolish school boards, we are prepared to encour¬ 
age a growing feeling that they be not abolished. 30 

Although critical of the manner in which the govern¬ 
ment is bringing in the county system, the Lethbridge 
Herald, nevertheless, advocates that it be tried out. It 
is particularly attracted to the Act f s provision for a 
standardization of school and municipal district boundaries 
for what it calls "administrative efficiency in taxation.’^ 1 
Aware that critics of the County Act are repulsed by its 
financial implications this newspaper comments: 

The fear is expressed that the county, as the taxing 
authority under the county system, might have too 
much to say about school costs and may take some steps 
towards their control, Perhaps, the county taxpayers 
who are also the school taxpayers, might not object.32 

The Lethbridge Herald, clearly states its position when 

it says: 

A county system under good management, with county 
manager, county engineer, county school superinten¬ 
dent and county assessor working in unison would 
solve a lot of problems and could save a lot of 
money to the people who, through taxes on property, 
must carry practically the whole burden.33

It is clear that when this newspaper thinks about 
education it is primarily concerned with its financial 
aspects. 

As time goes by the Calgary Herald grows more and 
more wary of this proposal. In the beginning this news¬ 
paper was fairly receptive to the idea. But either on the 
basis of a more considered judgment after a careful study 
of the subject, or a yielding to "pressure group" propaganda 
a definite change in attitude is apparent. 

Aware of its practical limitations the Herald, none¬ 
theless, originally felt that "in theory, the system is 

desirable."3^ 

Later the following statements are more characteris¬ 
tic of its opinion: 

We are inherently suspicious of any scheme to improve 
administrative convenience, since the term is too 
often synonymous with putting more power into official 
hands.33 

. . . there is a real danger that the county scheme 
will be imposed on the whole province, within the 
next few years, without any real discussion of the 

issues involved.36 

Education is always an easy target for legislators 
wielding an axe, and we are afraid that once the 
county councils got control over school spending, 
rural education in Alberta would be exceedingly 
vulnerable to thoughtless "economy" measures.37 

The latest editorial on this topic appearing in the 

Calgary Herald, and considered in this study, is significantly 

entitled "The County Act:. Another Look Needed" and the

3 6 CH, 8.11.0 
27ch, 3.3.0 








70 


following exerpt indicates what could be considered the 
newspaper’s present view: 

We are sure that, somewhere between the independence 
whiclitrustees now enjoy and the complete abandon¬ 
ment of independent school administration proposed 
in the County Act, there lies a workable compromise* 
(This is assuming that some compromise is, in fact, 
necessary — a proposition which has yet to be proved), 


OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE COMMENT 


The light volume of comment about public school ad¬ 
ministrators appearing in the daily newspapers leads one 
to wonder if, after all, the position of the administra¬ 
tive group is as dominant in the public mind as some would 
have us believe. Only the Minister and the Deputy Minister 
of Education are singled out by editors for consideration. 

There is a noticeable press neglect of the school 
principal and school superintendent. Editors are apparently 
unconcerned about the persons whose administrative duties 
as heads of the individual instructional units bring them 
in close contact with the children or about the relation¬ 
ship that exists between the school board and the superin¬ 
tendent. Perhaps administrators have failed by their 
actions to impress the press and the public with their 
relative importance to the educational scene. 

The Lethbridge Herald and the Calgary Albertan express 
some misgivings about the efficiency of the large rural school 


38 CH, 8.11.0 






71 . 


units. Pointing to the problems involved in pupil trans¬ 
portation occasioned by bad roads blocked by snow in the 
winter and made impassable by mud in the summer these news¬ 
papers observe that 

One wonders whether we didn't go to far and too fast 
in our efforts here in Alberta to provide better 
school buildings and van service to get the children 
to the schools. It has been a costly business, but 
the cost would not have counted so much had not the 
Weather Man interfered so greatly with . . . school 
attendance.39 

As a rule, however, the press appears to be well satis¬ 
fied with the large school unit. 

Other editorials in this area deal with equal educa¬ 
tional opportunities for Indians, Hutterite colony schools, 
dormitory life, the striking ofthe tax rates within munici¬ 
palities, voting powers with regard to school bylaws, and 
private schools. As is often the case, the nature and the 
volume of the comment is not worthy of detailed discussion. 
However, the editorials are worthy of mention and recogni¬ 
tion in this study. 

Finally, the reaction of the Lethbridge Herald to¬ 
wards a suggestion that the school year be cut from two 
hundred to one hundred and sixty days is interesting. 

With the schools costing more to build, teachers' 
salaries costing more and all the materials which 
go into the operation of a school costing more, the 
suggestion that the schools should be used for less 
days — with the same yearly take-home pay for the

This newspaper proposes that "schools should be open six 
days a week the year roundwith the sixth day given to extra- 
classroom activities.Under thin plan children would be 
promoted to a higher grade whenever ready for more ad¬ 
vanced study and "teachers employed on a 12-month basis, 
with a month's vacation."^ 2 "Sounds radical!" agrees the 
Herald, "Yet, compared with the amount of money for builds 
ing .and operation costs in other enterprises our schools 

are little used today."^3 The editor believes he "has a 

44 

plan worth considering". 

SUMMARY 

Editors recognize that the tasks confronting school 
boards are difficult and as a rule commend them for meeting 
their responsibilities in an exemplary manner. A strong 
tendency persists to support the sovereign rights of school 
boards whenever they are threatened. 

Some criticism of school boards is made on the ground 
that they have tended to abuse their independence and any¬ 
thing resembling secrecy or lack of responsiveness to the 
public will is seriously scored by certain editors. 

Respecting the County Act a divergence of opinion is 
evident. One newspaper feels it will make for greater 
efficiency in operation and reduce costs, others are re¬ 
pelled by the centralization of control and the financial

vulnerability of education under such a regime. In the 
main, however, the press rejects the County Act believing 
it to be a real threat to educational freedom and effic¬ 
iency. 

Other editorials are critical of the payment of school 
trustees; the provision of compulsory education to undesir¬ 
able students; the absenteeism and high costs occasioned by 
pupil transportation in the large school units; and of any 
attempt to shorten the school year. 

Notably deficient is the frequency of editorial com¬ 
ments on educational administrators. Consideration of the 
functions of the school superintendent and the school 
principal is entirely lacking in the Alberta press. One 
leaves this section with the feeling that the absence of 
any editorial comment on them may perhaps arise from their 
failure to impress their leadership on the social scene by 
neglecting to be as useful and as instrumental as they 
might have been. 




CHAPTER VI 


THE PRESS AND THE TEACHER 

As a subject of general reference the teaching body 
occupies a leading place in editorial comment on education. 
Editorials on teachers rank fourth among the major fields 
of classification. They constitute 10.99 per cent of all 
editorials on education, and there are altogether, ninety- 
seven such editorials. Thirty-four or 35*05 per cent were 
written by the Edmonton Bulletin, while the Medicine Hat 
Daily News did not contribute any. 

It is by no means certain that this suggests an ade¬ 
quate appreciation of the teacher. It does mean that after 
financial, curricular, and higher educational problems are 
disposed of editors turn to the teacher as a subject of 
interest and importance. 

What is it about teachers that concern the press, A 
perusal of all the editorials on this topic reveals that the 
shortage of teachers, their salaries and their training are 
the main topics of interest. Some comment also deals with 
the purpose and the value of teachers and the difficulties 
they encounter. 

ATTITUDE TOWARD TEACHERS 

Most educational authorities would certainly agree 
that the teacher is the backbone of any educational system. 
Most of them would agree that any theory of instruction

stands or falls on the strength of the teachers who 
implement it. Public opinion, as reflected in the press, 
also recognizes the importance of the teacher. 

Typical are editorials on education which advise: 

" . . . give the teacher a pat on the back' 11 for he is 
M the key figure in the whole business."^ 

The Edmonton Bulletin under the caption "Teaching 
Highest Profession" points out that "it is perhaps the 
highest profession of all because all other professions 
stem from it."^ This same newspaper concludes that "with¬ 
out good teachers any educational system will collapse."^ 

"It is no platitude to say that the school teacher is the 
backbone of the democratic system."^ 

Running parallel to this appreciation of the teacher 
is an understanding that he has many serious problems to 
contend with. "His .job is not easy,"^ observes the Leth¬ 
bridge Herald. 

In addition to problems posed by curriculum changes 
there is a problem of absenteeism brought on by the 
competition of industry withits alluring wages and 
also the matter of schoolroom discipline.7 

Noting that "... it is currently fashionable, if 
something goes wrong, to blame it on the early school train¬ 
ing of children" and that "conversely, if human nature falls 
down in some particular, a loud cry goes up that the schools

do something about it,” the Edmonton Bulletin asks, "Just 
what is expected of school teachers anyway?"^ 

Editors feel that too much is expected of teachers, 
and are critical of parents who expect them to assume 
parental responsibility. "This is unfair to both the 
teacher and the child,"9 says the Edmonton Bulletin. 

The Calgary Herald in an editorial entitled "The 
Teachers Right To Live His Own Life" discusses the diff¬ 
iculties which arise, particularly in rural areas, over 
teachers smoking and drinking. However, "his, or her, 
worst problem is the belief, firmly fixed in many a 
private community, that the teacher should carry a tre¬ 
mendous burden of spare time activity. 

Continuing, the^ Herald emphasizes that 

Teachers need tolerance. They are entitled to the 
same faults and failings as other men and women. 

They are entitled, once the day’s work is done, to 
live their own lives and to seek solace in their own 
particular way.-^ 

In fact, concludes this newspaper with a touch of 
irony, "They are entitled . . . to be regarded as human 
beings. 

Political activity on the part of teachers is whole¬ 
heartedly endorsed by the Calgary Albertan. 

The teacher who is a leader in community affairs 
is more likely to cultivate in the pupil a sense

77 


of civic interest and responsibility. The teacher 
who is willing to serve the community publicly, 
particularly at the municipal level where democracy 
begins, is setting a good example to his pupils.^-3 

And, when it is suggested that the teaching profes¬ 
sion is harboring many communists within its ranks the 
press, in editorials bearing titles such as "A Profession 
Wronged" 1 ^ or "Mean Reflection Against Teachers, ul 5 leaps 
to the defense of teachers. 

. . . there is less likelihood of . . . teachers 
embracing communism than any one else because of 
their superior intellectual and educational level.^ 

Statements about teacher communists are regarded as 

"pure bosh Hl 7 and loyalty oaths as "merely insulting" 1 ® 

While editorial attitude toward teachers is generally 

favorable, on occasion they are also censured. 

For example, the Calgary Albertan in an editorial 

entitled "Teachers vs Education" notices that "... the 

pupils are the victims of a "new idea" which the teachers 

as a profession - have suddenly discovered during the 

past 20 or 30 years." 

Teachers have become convinced that it is their 
business to educate the pupils. This, of course, 
is not only impossible. It is ridiculous. 

Because: 

An education is not the result of instruction. It 
is the fruit of experience. No young human being 
can be given an education. He or she must obtain it.

"The declaration of the teaching profession that its 
object is to fit the young to take their place in life is," 
claims the Albertan, "a piece of pompous conceit. 

TEACHERS* SALARIES 

Pages could be filled with reproductions of editorial 
comment taking up the cry —more money for the teachers! 

The Edmonton Bulletin, the teacher's staunchest sup¬ 
porter, voices the general opinion & the press when it 
proclaims, "The chief ailment of education in Canada is 
the ridiculously low level of teachers' salaries." 20 
Editors are convinced that "teachers' salaries are the 
crux of the educational crisis in Canada." 21 

"Teachers are not paid sufficiently good salaries" 22 
says the Lethbridge Herald. "Salaries must be raised or 
education will inevitably decline." 2 3 Agreeing emphat¬ 
ically, the Edmonton Bulletin declares, "It is time to 
take the "teachers' salary" out of the joke column; and 
to pay them as though they were doing something worthwhile 
to the community." 2 ^ 

Our ludicrous standard of values is revealed by 
various editors who compare teachers 1 salaries with the 
salaries of other groups. The Calgary Herald 2 ^ notes 
that bartenders and elevator operators are paid more than

teachers. Figures are quoted by the Edmonton Bulletin*^ 

which indicates that longshoremen, garage mechanics, and 

passenger brakemen have greater incomes than teachers. 

On hearing that a primary teacher in Florida makes 

about $120 a month, while a baby-sitter earns as much as 

$135 a month,the Edmonton Bulletin expresses concern 

over where this trend will lead. 

It is a devastating thought that education, upon 
which the welfare of the state appends, must 
eventually fall into the hands, if further funds 
for education are not forthcoming, of misfits 
who drift into teaching because they have been 
failures at everything else. 2 ° 

Beyond a doubt, “our contempt for the processes of 
education is one of the most dangerous and corroding dis¬ 
eases of democratic civilization. 

One newspaper suggests that Alberta taxpayers must 
begin to ask themselves that: 

Aside from all the questions of moral and economic 
right, which is entirely on the side of the teachers, 
can this province afford to pile up discontent among 
the teachers by withholding from them a wage com¬ 
patible with the place they fill in the democratic 
structure?30 

The press is convinced we cannot. 

Under a form of government which depends for its 
effectiveness upon public enlightenment, the ulti¬ 
mate cost of such discontent and dissatisfaction 
is bound to be infinitely more than the cost of 
raising teachers’ salaries to a fair level. 31

Teachers are viewed as touching two vital phases of 
civilized life. First, influencing the lives of children, 
they influence, indirectly, the lives of homes. Thus it 
is claimed by the Edmonton Bulletin that " cheap teaching 
can create cheap-minded children. And shoddy-minded 
children can ruin the homes of the country."3 2 

Also, it is postulated that upon the enlightenment 
of the child depends the future of democracy and, there¬ 
fore, "homes and government rest upon the skill and 
ability with which teachers carry out their work. "33 

As a result of these beliefs the press is convinced 
that "salaries should be raised, not only in justice to 
the teachers, but in justice to society. For it is 
society that will feel the effect once inadequate,sala¬ 
ries begin to deteriorate teaching quality."3^ 

The importance of the teacher and his need to be 
paid a salary commensurate with the job he performs is a 
common editorial theme. Hence, when a local organization 
asks that the school boards and the government co-operate 
to supply free textbooks for all students, the Edmonton 
Bulletin suggests that "if money is available to buy free 
books for every school child, that money, or at least some 
of it, should be used to bring teachers' salaries into 
line with the importance of their work."35

• • • the crux of the entire educational problem 
is teachers' salaries. Without good teachers, any 
educational system will collapse, and any number 
of free textbooks will be useless. 

•The newspapers join with the teachers in demanding 

a minimum salary of $1500, and increased pensions. "The 

teachers are not only justified in their demand; but they 

are exceedingly modest in it."37 

The teaching profession ... is one of the corner¬ 
stones of democratic civilization. Yet we have 
tried to reduce the dignity and value of that pro¬ 
fession to a point parallel to an emolument of less 

than $1500 a year.3o 

An editorial entitled "A Reasonable Request" in the 

Calgary Albertan outlines the teachers' pension proposal. 

What the Alberta teachers want is the pension scheme 
now used for civil servants which would involve an 
annual service pension plus an annuity based on con¬ 
tributions. 39 

The Calgary Herald observes: 

We can see no valid reason why teachers should not 
be classed as civil servants — which they are —and 
given the protection of the Public Service Pension 
Act. Their wages permit little saving in a life¬ 
time of work. Forty dollars a month is not an ade¬ 
quate pension; it is a disgrace .^ 

The press believes that "surely the people of a 

province who spend $26,000,000 a year on liquor, can 

afford to pay a minimum salary of $1500 a year, with a 

modest pension, to those whose essential work touches 

the future of Alberta so intimately.

When a new pension plan was instituted the Edmonton 
Bulletin heralded it as "an encouraging sign of public 
awakening to the importance of the teacher's task in the 
community. 

Yet, while acknowledging the rights of teachers to 
demand higher salaries and pensions, their methods of 
doing so are often questioned. Teachers while claiming 
to be a professional group employ labor union methods 
deteriment-al to their cause, claims the Edmonton Bulletin 
under the caption of "Profession or Labor Union. 

A strike vote taken by teachers in Drumheller is 
viewed by the Edmonton Journal as a setback to the pro¬ 
fessional aspect of teaching. 

A walk-out which would disrupt the school system 
of a community and leave children without instruc¬ 
tion for an indefinite period is not the sort of 
thing one associates with professional standards. 44 

The Edmonton papers join in suggesting that the 
School Act and the Labour Act be amended to allow the 
teachers to settle their disputes in a manner more com¬ 
patible with their professed status as a profession. 

Professionalism also is considered by the Lethbridge 
Herald,, a paper which is not too vigorous a campaigner for 
increased teachers' salaries. Attention is drawn to the 
fact that, while there are many to whom teaching is a 
profession, there are a lot of young teachers to whom it

is not a profession, and who have no intention whatever 
of making it their life’s work. "Therein lies one of the 


big problems facing teaching as a profession today."^5 


. . . the salary of the real professional is not 
high enough — the salary of the beginner is often 
too high. In the effort to obtain mass production 
of professionals the inexperienced and inept be- 

those who are 



This belief is reiterated in a later editorial. 

There should be a teaching profession. But those 
who become professionals should be screened out . . 
and these should be paid well in line with earnings 
in other professions and should be accorded a high 
standing in public opinion. ^ 

Some sections of the press feel that in the matter 
of low salaries: 

Teachers have a great deal of blame to take upon 
themselves. They have lacked the foresight to 
organize themselves into a professional body and 
set up their own standards. They have accepted 
too readily the public attitude that "anybody can 
teach," and have by that token failed to educate 
the very public who hires them.^o 

It is pointed out that 

Teachers accept, often with good grace, salaries 
which make the average carpenter, machinist, or 
janitor laugh with some touch of scorn.^9 

The Calgary Albertan asks, "Can't standards of pay 

be established by teachers themselves? 11 And further, 

"Can't the public be made to understand that the skill 

and knowledge of the teacher is not to be bought at a 


45 LH, 2.13.7 47 LH, 3.6.7 49 CA, Ibid

84 


cheaper rate than that of a janitor?”50 

It is agreed that teachers have had the good-will of 

public-minded citizens for a long time now. 

From all sides have come indignation at the poor 
pay and the hard lot of the teacher. Governments 
and municipalities even add their crocodile tears 
to the general wail over our poor pedagogues.51 

"But it might just occur to teachers,” suggests the 

Albertan, "that their difficulties are largely of their 

own making.” 

They have sold themselves cheaply and the public 
may take a long time to learn that it has been 
getting a bargain in services which should have 
put both parties to some degree of shame. 52 


Finally, a note of warning is sounded. 


Unless . . . teachers can agree on common standards 
of professional ethics and make the public under¬ 
stand in no uncertain terms the imperative nature 
of the services they have to offer, even that section 
of the public which is already conscious of the 
great contribution which teachers are making, will 
accept them at their own meagre valuation.53 


TEACHER SHORTAGE 


The daily newspapers of the province are genuinely 
concerned over the teacher shortage of Alberta, and through¬ 
out the Dominion. 

An editorial entitled "Why Quit Teaching,” appearing 
in the Lethbridge Herald, outlines the reasons people quit 
teaching. 


50 C a, 5.2.7 52 C k, Ibid 

51 CH, Ibid 


53 CH, 5.2.7 










85 


. . . the majority of young girls who go into the 
teaching profession — if it has established such 
a status —have no intention of remaining in it. 

They become teachers largely because it gives them 
a professional status upon which they can depend 
if things go wrong after they quit. Evidently they 
look upon it largely as a stepping stone to better 
marriages . . .53- 

Why do men enter and leave the teaching profession? 

... to a great many of them, teaching is merely a 
stepping stone. They teach, for a few years to earn 
some money to go on to University. They teach in 
order to have a job while•looking around for some 
opportunity. Some of them teach while they are 
studying for another profession. It gives them 
self-confidence for whatever calling they may decide 
to follow later. 55 

Other editors give substantially the same reasons for 
the ’’mass exodus out of the profession which may be 
starting.”55 

’’The teacher scarcity ranks ... as a national 
problem.”^7 As a result of the shortage “the entire 
social structure of the country is menaced because educa¬ 
tion is in jeopardy. ”58 

The Edmonton Bulletin ominously warns: 

Education ... is already on the downward swing 
in the matter of personnel. It will only be a 
matter of time, if indeed it has not already started, 
when the standards of education will follow this 
downward trend.59 

According to editors, this critical situation can be 
remedied by increasing teachers’ salaries. Characteristic 
of this belief are comments such as the following: 


56 EB, 1.24.7 58 EB, 1.19.9

86 


Higher pay would remove a factor which now keeps 
out of the profession young men and women who 
would like to teach, and is also driving out of 
the profession some who do not want to leave it#6° 

. . . the teaching profession has come to be a 
deserted profession. It is deserted for the good 
and sufficient reason that its financial rewards 
are piffling in relation to its importance and 
in relation to the rewards in other fields.^ 1 

”It would he folly,’ 1 states the Edmonton Bulletin, 

”to suppose the main factor is anything other than lack of 
financial inducement . u ^2 Thus the government’s policy of 
attempting to alleviate the teacher shortage by providing 
scholarships in education to entice young people into the 
profession is criticized for its failure to deal realis¬ 
tically with the problem. 

Of what sense is it to give young people scholar¬ 
ships in education when they desert that profession 
at the first opportunity because salaries are so 
ridiculously inadequate?63 

The Edmonton Journal,although in agreement that "we 
shall not really solve our teacher problem until the ..pro¬ 
fession is so rewarded, both financially and in community 
respect, that is it will enlist men and women who intend 
to make it their careeer,”^ reminds teachers that other 
professional people, such as doctors and lawyers, who 
have spent longer learning their profession than teachers, 
make very little when starting out. Thus implying that 
beginning salaries should not be considered a significant

factor in deterring applicants for the teaching profession. 

However, it is the conviction of the Calgary Herald 

that the answer to the teacher shortage does not lie in 

increasing teachers' salaries alone. This newspaper 

focuses attention on the connection between teacher status 

and teacher shortage. It believes that in raising the 

entrance qualifications for teachers we will be getting 

at the core of the problem. 

At first sight the apparent result of this might 
be to accentuate the shortage of teachers, but 
we believe, all the same, that it is the right 
course. In its way, it will help to raise 
teacher status and thereby make recruitment more 
easy.85 

Eesides, argues the Calgary Herald, "Teaching. . . 
is a vocation rather than a job. For anyone not passion¬ 
ately interested in teaching as an art, it might well 
prove to be an intolerable occupation ..." "For this 
reason alone," shrewdly adds the Herald, "Preoccupation 
with material matters like salary schedules, important as 
they undoubtedly are, will not solve the problem by itself."88 

Two newspapers, the Edmonton Journal and the Calgary 
Herald, believe the basic problem in Canadian schools, par¬ 
ticularly those outside the large cities, is to get more and 
better men teachers, and to keep them teaching. 

"Cupid still seems to be the great unsettling factor 
in the teaching profession,notices the Edmonton Journal. 


65 CH, 4.15.0

88 


It suggests that perhaps the only answer lies in somehow 
persuading more men to take up teaching as a profession. 
"Men may or may not be better teachers than women, but 
they are much more apt to make it a lifetime jo'b."^ 

Editorials bearing titles such as "Our Schools Need 
More Male Teachers"^ and "Our Youngsters Need More Men 
Teachers"7° appearing in the Calgary Herald are indicative 
of this paper’s feelings. Particularly, emphasis is given 
to the need for men in the elementary grades. "A school 
with teachers of only one sex is like a home with only one 
parent."^ 1 Further, it is pointed out that boys need 
guidance in sports, in choosing a vocation, and firm dis¬ 
cipline, and that men are the ones to give it to them. 

To get more and better men teachers "means offering 
salaries on which a man can expect to marry, and raise a 
family, in some measure of security and comfort. 

The Edmonton Journal"^ feels that public opinion is 
demanding enough to warrant government action to solve the 
province’s teacher shortage. In a series of editorials 
this newspaper urges the government to "assume the respon¬ 
sibility for placing and paying teachers,with local 
school boards being left responsible for the provision and 
operation of the physical plant. This, it is contended,

people would be more confident that big things at the top 
might be reached by application, ability, and experience. 


TEACHER TRAINING 


In the editorials appearing in the daily newspapers 
of the province referring directly and indirectly to 
teachers the press is revealed as convinced that "teaching 
is an arduous profession that requires infinite training 
and consummate skill. "76 it is a result of their belief 
that considerable criticism is directed at the provincial 
government, and its representatives, when a shortening of 
the teacher training period is proposed. No other govern¬ 
ment pronouncement during this period was greeted with so 
much opposition. 

Why is the press against short-term teacher training? 
"The answer lies in the realization shared by all thinking 
citizens except, apparently the minister of education and 
his council, that this is the age of transition,"77 declares 
the Calgary Herald. 

Education is the only means by which the ordinary 
citizens of the world may rise to the heights de¬ 
manded of them by scientific evolution. Schools, 
their nature and their function, their curricular 
and their technique are changing. To meet the new 
demands made upon them, teachers must be better 
qualified and more thoroughly prepared. 78 

The foregoing explains, according to the Calgary 

Herald, why the advisory board established by the govern-

ment recommended a basic two-year program with the four- 
year Bachelor of Education for more advanced teaching. 
Continuing it asks, "Why have Mr. Ansley and the executive 
council suddenly reversed the decision of the board? 11 "If 
ever there was a $64 question this is it,"79 

The Calgary Albertan also dismayed by the governments 
"high-handed act" asks and attempts to answer the question: 
"Why did the cabinet do such a thing?Although admitting 
that this inevitable query can only be answered by conjecture 
the Albertan intimates that those close to the heart of ed¬ 
ucation administration agree on the following explanation: 

The provincial government and the University of 
Alberta are at loggerheads. They have been so 
ever since the university refused to give an 
honorary degree to the late Premier William Aber- 
hart. Then when the university refused to give 
courses in Social Credit the bitter feeling 
increased. The provincial government provides 
a large part of the University's revenue, but 
finds it cannot dictate to the - University how the 
money will be spent. ~ 

Shortening the period of teacher training is conceived 
as being, in the main, an act of revenge on the governments 
part. 


Apparently it doesn't matter that education in 
Alberta is set back perhaps 20 years , . . 
Apparently it doesn't matter that all government 
advisory boards are insulted and made mockery of 
by this one high-handed (but perfectly legal) act. 
The provincial government has asserted its auth¬ 
ority. That matters.

The Edmonton Journal^ proposes, with less emotion, 
another explanation. This newspaper feels that the govern¬ 
ment, aware of the low salaries, the poor living conditions, 
and the serious teacher shortage, is afraid to raise require¬ 
ments without raising salaries a,nd thereby increase the 
exodus from the teaching profession. 11 Such a policy is 
understandable," remarks the Journal, "but short-sighted."®^ 

There is only one way to improve the Alberta school 
system, and that is to increase salaries to a point 
at which the profession again becomes attractive to 
the best class of young people, while at the same 
time raising the qualifications required for the 
granting of any certificate. 0 ^ 

On this point even the Journal's bitter rival, the 

Edmonton Bulletin, agrees: 

. . , the proper course is not to reduce . . .

The proposal to decrease the amount of training 

required to become eligible to teach is viewed as a 

weird paradox. 

Society is agreed that before doctors, lawyers, or 
chartered accountants are permitted to practice, 
they must, for the protection of the general public, 
undertake a period of several years training. 

Strange indeed is the set of values which will 
demand stringent precautions before men may operate 
on limbs or give advice in legal or financial matters, 
yet will cheerfully offer children for the experi¬ 
ment of anyone who has had the barest minimum of 
professional study.ST 

The Minister of Education, in his speech announcing 
the government's intentions to shorten teacher training,

is reported in the Calgary Herald as having discounted 
the importance of* the teacher. Of having suggested that 
his influence for good or evil is of no great importance, 
and further claiming that it is the hard school of 
experience that counts in the child 1 s development. The 


Herald takes issue with these statements. 

If the function of the teacher were solely to 
give instruction in academic subjects perhaps 
he would be right, but any educationist knows 
that this is far from the case. The develop¬ 
ment of good character, the drawing out of the 
latent powers and potentialities of all the 
children entrusted to his charge — this is the 
function of the teacher. 


"Is it easily learned? 11 asks the Herald, "Can it 


be so lightly dismissed? Is it not perhaps most impor¬ 
tant of all jobs entrusted to man?"^ 


At the same time the Edmonton Journal in an edi¬ 
torial entitled "Mr. Ansley’s Bombshell"-^ 0 reports him 
as having said that experience is what makes the teacher. 


A large portion of the editorial is then devoted to an 
attempt to repudiate this argument on the basis that 
experience is useless without a thorough preliminary 


training to supplement it. 

The essence of the objections of the press to 

short-term teacher training is expressed in the following: 

It is widely agreed that the highest intelligence 
section among Ganadian youth do not choose teach- 


88 CH, 4.26.6 90 EJ, 4.24.6

93 


ing as their life work because it is financially 
ill-rewarded. The profession has now been still 
further cheapened. By giving teaching privileges 
to people who have had but a few months’ training 
we are inviting into it adventurers and-fly-by- 
nights. 91 

The general tone is: 

This has been a black week for the parents of 
Alberta. Public opinion has been demanding with 
increasing urgency better teachers, better schools, 
better equipment, more money for education, and 
making here and there a little headway, only suddenly 
to receive this serious setback, as ill-considered as 
it is arbitrarily delivered. 92 

Later, when a compromise was arrived at whereby those 
taking the one-year teacher training course were granted an 
interim certificate, good for two years, following which 
those certificates had to be made permanent by a further 
year of training, the press is still dissatisfied. 

The Calgary Albertan notes that ’’the compromise 
agreement might still be interpreted as a step backwards, 
since it means reversion to a system where teachers with 
one year’s training can enter the profession — at least 
temporarily. H 93 Only because of the fact that the compro¬ 
mise takes into account a number of economic factors and 
the continuing shortage of teachers, is it acceptable for 
the time being. In conclusion this same editorial, “Agree¬ 
able But Not Excusable,” unrelentingly takes the government 
to task for its original dedsion.

CA, 5.13.6 







94 


Doubtless the only source of satisfaction for the 
press in this whole issue is voiced by the Edmonton 
Journal^ when it points out that, in affecting a compro¬ 
mise on teacher training, the government bowed to public 
opinion. 

One other editorial on the teacher training contro¬ 
versy is of interest. The Calgary Herald becomes incensed 
over a statement by Mr. Casey, who succeeded Mr. Ansley as 
Minister of Education in 1948, in which he warns teachers 
to discontinue their criticism of teacher training if good 
relations between teachers and the Department of Education 
are to be maintained. 

"It is insufferable that any group, and particularly 
teachers, should be subjected to this veiled blackmail by 
a Minister of the Crown,"^5 cries the Herald. Mr. Casey 
is urged to retract his words or "get out."96 His state¬ 
ment is interpreted by this newspaper as meaning that the 
dogged criticism, from all quarters, of the province’s 
teacher training program has begun to hit home. 

Press comment on such things as scholarships to 
entice young people into teaching, the deductibility, for 
income tax purposes, of expenses incurred by teachers 
attending summer school, the in-service training of 
teachers, and so on, is very meagre and, as a result,

95 


inconclusive. For these reasons such items are not con¬ 
sidered in this section. 

An editorial bearing the caption, 11 Too Many Weeds In 
The Teaching Garden,"97 adequately states the general 
feeling of the daily press toward the teaching profession 
and deserves consideration by way of conclusion. 

The opinion is expressed in this editorial that there 
are far too many in the teaching profession who don't belong 
in it and who must be weeded out. As a result some way must 
be devised to get more highly qualified people into the pro¬ 
fession and keep them there. These people should come, in 
greater proportion than at present, from superior type homes 
located in cities. Too many, at present, have a rural back¬ 
ground of low cultural value. And, finally, it is the be¬ 
lief that teachers should undergo a longer period of train¬ 
ing with two years as a compulsory minimum. 

What the teaching profession wants, more than anything 
else, is a higher status in the eyes of the public. 

This is a worthy ambition. But a great deal of weeding- 
out has to be done before teaching can legimately claim 
any such status, and most of it must be done among those 
who, having struggled through a one-year course, now 
profess and call themselves teachers.^ 

SUMMARY 

Editorials on teachers are frequent and constitute 
more than one-tenth of all editorial comment on education. 

On the whole they are adversely critical of the treatment

accorded teachers. 

When editors think of teachers they immediately 
think of their salaries. The low salaries paid to 
teachers are considered to be the crux of the educational 
problem in Canada. There is a constant demand that 
teachers’ salaries be made commensurate with the job they 
are doing as the pivotal persons in a democratic society. 
This is urged by the press not only for the sake of the 
teacher, but for the good of society which, as a whole, 
will undoubtedly be effected once inadequate salaries 
affect teaching quality. 

It is the belief of the daily newspapers of the 
province that the inadequacy of the salaries paid to 
teachers is directly reflected in our current teacher 
shortage. Increased salaries and more stringent entrance 
requirements are advocated as methods of improving 
teacher status and thereby attracting to, and holding 
in the profession, more superior young people, partic¬ 
ularly men, having highly cultured, urban backgrounds. 

One newspaper, the Edmonton Journal, firmly believes 
that were the government, as an adjunct to its teacher 
training program, to take over the placement and payment 
of teachers, much evident improvement would be forth¬ 
coming. As a result of the higher status obtainable by 
capable, diligent teachers under such a system, new life 
would be breathed into the profession. 



97 . 


Editors are unyielding in their insistence that 
teacher training in this province be of at least two 
years duration. They are extremely critical of any attempts, 
regardless of the motives behind them, to decrease in any 
way the amount of basic training required by teachers. 

There is a general and genuine friendliness for the 
teacher revealed in this investigation. Teachers are un¬ 
hesitatingly supported in their demands for better salaries, 
pensions, and living conditions. Their political freedom 
and rights as individuals are jealously guarded. Their 
problems and aspirations are viewed with sympathetic under¬ 
standing. Yet, the press appears somewhat reluctant to 
grant the teaching body, as it is now constituted, the 
professional status to which they aspire. 

This refusal is based on the prevalent belief amongst 
editors that many teachers are unworthyof such status. And, 
further, that the methods employed by teachers in the solu¬ 
tion of their problems are not consistent with the concept 
of professionalism. It is felt that teachers, as a group, 
must approach their job, and its problems, with more 
realism and set their house in order before they can legi¬ 
timately claim professional status. 







CHAPTER VII 


EFFICIENCY OF EDUCATION 

Running; through a large portion of the editorials 
classified under the headings of Value and Purpose of 
Education, Methods and Procedures, and Curriculum in 
Table III is a current of comment making an evaluation of 
our present system of education. This stream of opinion, 
of vital importance to educators, is considered here, 

EVALUATION URGED 

“Are we getting what we are paying for?’®^ This 
question is of great concern to the editors of the daily 
newspapers of Alberta, 

Typical of this is the statement by the Lethbridge 
Herald, 

Schools and their operation are costing more and 
more ofthe taxpayers® money, and one wonders whether 
the education youngsters are getting these days is 
worth it. 2 

In the opinion of the press , . . n there seems to be 
a general breaking down in morale, in the attitude toward 
education — a tendency to treat educational opportunities 
and responsibilities lightly. 1 ^ What is required is H a 
recapitulation of our aims and ideals in education, 1,4

Unless our compass is true and our rudder secure 
then all the sail and galley stuffing in the 
world will not carry us safely home to port. 5 


CRITICISM OF EDUCATION 


"Education is the most controversial subject in the 
world," claims the Calgary Herald. "For every modernist 
who enthuses over the new freedom and the varied curric¬ 
ulum of the enterprise system, one will meet a diehard who 
will oppose it . . ."6 This study reveals that newspaper 
editors, as a group, can hardly be considered "modernists." 
Their position is clearly indicated by the statements which 
follow: 

Progressive education can undeniably produce a 
great many followers: its results, so far, indicate 
that it will produce few leaders.* 


The criticism of modern or progressive education 
boils down to a simple phrase, too much stress on 
frills and not enough emphasis on the simple^funda¬ 
mentals of the little red school house . 


' 8 ' 


When Paul R. Becken told a meeting last week that 
"so called progressive education" was resulting 
in a "uniform mediocrity" in our schools, he was 
expressing the opinion of many Albertans.9 

. . . there has been a lowering of standards, a 
dilution of achievement to an average norm which 
is not conducive to virile, enterprising civiliza¬ 
tion. 10 


. . . we are developing in our primary schools a 
nation of slow, bad readers. The reasons are 
probably many: crowded schools and insufficient 
teachers; over-emphasis on progressivism in many 
schools and overlooking the fundamentals; too much

reliance on visua.1 and auditory educational devices. 11 

. . . primary schools are more nearly play centres, 
the elementary schools becoming boys' and girls' 
clubs, many of the secondary schools really youth 
centres . . . schools are abdicating their role as 
primarily places of education. 12 

... in the urge for modernity sometimes, we think, 
we lose sight of the good of the older methods with 
the result that basic education suffers. 

There is a lack of satisfaction on the part of the 
public with the products of the high schools of 
today, and the fact that less than half of the 
pupils finish their courses would indicate that there 
is a lack of satisfaction on the part of the pupils. 1 ^ 

Many innovations in secondary schools curriculum 
throughout the past 20 years have been of questionable 
value. 1 5 

. . . the danger of treating school classes as if 
they were some form of amusement or entertainment, 
and of the current theory that discipline is value¬ 
less, is that in their preoccupation with "progressive" 
methods the schools will lose sight of their main 
objectives altogether. 1 ^ 

There is more than a suggestion that the curriculum 
is not good. Business men deplore . . . the poor 
standard of knowledge of basic subjects shown by 
pupils who come to them as employees. Teachers 
themselves are quick to voice their disapproval of 
a cluttered curriculum. 1 ? 

The daily newspapers of the province are decidedly 
opposed to what they term a "dilution of the curriculum." 1 ^ 
They are convinced that there is too much emphasis on 
students' needs and diversity in the curriculum and urge 
that both be toned down. They are critical of the 
"tendency in educational circles to mistake the shadow

for the substance. 

A summation of their opinions on curriculum content 
is found in the following, excerpt from the Medicine Hat 
Daily News: 

In the interest of progress it has been broadened 
to such a degree that essentials are spread too 
thinly for thorough absorption . . . the curriculum 
is becoming top heavy with diversification. Some 
boiling down of the sap is required in order to 
produce a better quality syrup.20 


CULTURAL EDUCATION VERSUS PRACTICAL EDUCATION 


Comment in this field reflects the division of 
opinion characteristic of most groups discussing educa¬ 
tional policies. Perhaps the collision of viewpoints 
reflected here is inevitable. School authorities them¬ 
selves are often divided on the issue. 

On the whole the press believes that "the core of 
education is in certain tough subjects which give discip¬ 
line and train the mind." 21 It is pointed out by the 
Calgary Herald that 

Educators have sugar-coated the pill with rare 
cunning. But once the candy film Is dissolved 
the pill is still as hard to swallow. 22 

This newspaper firmly believes that the school 

curriculum should be devised so that the fundamentals — 

the cultural needs — are guaranteed.

102 


The function of an educational system is not to 
apply a slick veneer of knowledge over students’ 
minds, but to make sure that those minds are 
properly trained and taught to think. 2 3 

The same cry is taken up by the Edmonton Journal 2 ^ 

which warns that original hard thought may fall into discard 

as a result of the present trend toward a liberal education. 

Re-echoing this same theme, the Medicine Hat Daily News 

states: 


Education may have fine buildings, modern tools, 
and competent instructors, birt if it fails to 
teach children to think — to cultivate their 
reasoning power — then it is laboring to produce 
a mass mind which will eventually become a 
sluggish frustration to itself. 2 5 


Under the caption ’’It’s Something: But Is it 
Education” 2 ^ the Calgary Herald takes issue with the 
proposition advanced by a leading Alberta educator that 


the ”development of social consciousness should be the 
primary aim of education, 


In the functional world of the future, when every 
school boy knows how to feed a baby (but never heard 
of Plato), the schools which Doctor Smith envisages 
will be churning out students all stamped in neat 
identical patterns. But hasn’t the doctor forgotten 
one thing? The duty of the educator is to teach 
children to think, and not merely to pick up pack¬ 
aged information. 


Continuing, this newspaper argues, ”A school which 


has not done this, regardless of how mechanically expert 
its graduates may be in the business of making a living, 
is a total failure.” 2 9

Our present emphasis on practical education ‘'does not 

develop initiative or stimulate self-expression,"30 and, 1 

although " today's world will not permit a lessening of 

technical ability . . • we must, if we are to survive, 

place greater emphasis on the spiritual" so that material 

progress may be directed wisely to yield a better life for 

all, claims many editorials. 

. . . it is important to understand that children 
today are not getting education in the sense that 
our grandfathers understood it, and that this 
failure to teach them the essentials of their re¬ 
lationship with G-od, with their physical surround¬ 
ings and with their fellow-men, as that relationship 
has been defined by the wisdom of the ages, represents 
a real threat to our liberal civilization.32 

"It is time our educational nurseries started cul¬ 
tivating sounder ground stock"33 by placing more emphasis 
on cultural education argue the editors of the province's 
daily newspapers. 

The general tone is: 

It is a fine thing through various schoolroom enter¬ 
prises, through music, games, dramatics and the like, 
to educate the boys and girls in the art of living. 

But to do so while neglecting the very foundation of 
an education is to cheat the boys and girls by leaving 
the impression in their minds that life is a song and 
that hard work no longer counts. 3^ 

On the other hand, however, in the same newspapers on 
different occasions, there is evidence of a willingness 
to welcome the more practical aspects of education. 

"For those ending their schooling, in high school there 
can be no question but that broader technical options and

progressive trends have enlarged the scope for useful 
citizenship ,”55 says the Medicine Hat Daily News. This 
newspaper champions the cause of composite education 
pointing out that "it will in time build better community 
citizenship and probably be the means of saving some young 
people from developing anti-social complexes."36 when a 
composite high schooL is opened in that city, this same 
newspaper remarks: 

411 those connected with the developing trend are 
to be congratulated on their initiative, enterprise 
and vision in implementing composite education in 
Medicine Hat .37 

The Lethbridge Herald, on learning from an educational 
authority that an institution beamed to the functional 
rather than pure academic training is best suited to the 
needs of 85 per cent of the students attending our high 
schools, suggests: 

Perhaps this might prove to be a golden opportunity 
to break new ground in education in Alberta, and get 
away from the overemphasis on academic education 
which appears to provide for only 15 per cent of 
pupils who enter grade nine in our present high 
school set-up and who go on to University. 3 o 

In another editorial^ the Herald suggests that a 

judicious mixture of drill and discipline and the new look 

which stirs the imagination of the child would be about 

right. 


If any conclusion is possible, it is that the Alberta

105 


press opinion finds the pursuit of "cultural" objectives 
highly desirable in education. Education is more than 
training for a job, and the volume of the comment indicates 
that editors believe this to be true. 


DEFENSE OF EDUCATION 

The fact that editors in general are comparatively 

critical on questions of curriculum content does not mean 

that they are not supporters of education. By and large, 

newspaper opinion protests belief in the value of schools. 

On occasion, support can even be discerned for the present 

system of education, as the following statements indicate: 

It would be foolhardy to argue that modern schooling 
is not an improvement over that of a generation ago.^ 

On the whole the school curriculum is good, our 
scholastic standards in Alberta . . . are high.^ 1 

In spite of many glaring weaknesses in the modern 
educational system we believe it is a fact that 
school children are getting a better education now 
than they have ever had before and that every cent 
of the cost is good investment .^ 

However, while generous in its support for the ideal 
of education, as shown earlier, tends to be critical of 
many actual educational practices. 

Educators can, nevertheless, find some consolation in 
the fact that the press does not place all the responsibility 
for educations.! efficiency on their shoulders.

"Much of the blame for the poor showing of today's 

students rests within the educational system," claims the 

Medicine Hat Daily News, "but it must also be shared by 

the student, the home and the community at large . . ."^3 

The Calgary Herald suggests that probably much of the blame 

must be placed on the students.^ It further proposes that 

"only when parents and teachers work together can the best 

educational results be achieved. "^5 

The press notes that the ever prevalent danger is 

that parents may expect too much of the schools. 

It can't make geniuses out of.blockheads, though 
it may-give a little polish to the native grain. 

It can't develop qualities that the child didn't 
possess in the first place. But it can and does 
on the whole, turn out pretty fair citizens.^6 

AL 

BACK TO THE FUNDAMENTS 

A 

A notable degree of emphasis is attached by the 

daily newspapers of Alberta to the need of getting back 

to "fundamentals" or the "three - R's." Significant are 

statements such as these. 

. . . too much stress on frills and not enough 
emphasis on the simple fundamentals of the little 
red school house.^7 

Our quarrel with today's education is not with 
the curricula,' but with the fact that there is 
too much tendency to consider the three R's as 
mid-Victorian .^

We fear there is too much tendency in our schools 
to overemphasize the modern "project 11 forgetting 
that, after all, there's a good deal to be said 
for the "three R's. "^9 

. . . recovery of basic principles is required. 

The standards are there but too many pedagogues 
have lost sight of the need of emphasis on the 
three - R foundation.5° 

Some great Canadians have done fairly well for 
themselves and for Canada equipped with a thor¬ 
ough grounding in the three R's and little else 
except an idea instilled in their minds at school 
that hard work is worthwhile.51 

It is the discipline of the three R's that enables 
most pupils to grasp the new course of study when 
the right time comes. Without that grounding 
classes become just a sort of game, and create in 
secondary school pupils a false sense of values and 
an attitude that the stern realities of life we talk 
about are just a myth.52 

Alberta editors believe "the problem facing educa¬ 
tionists and school trustees is not to devise a still 
greater variety of courses or diversionary teaching 
methods, but a system for more sustained application in 
the rudiments of reading, writing and arithmetic."^ 

Attention is drawn to the fact that "the mistake has 
been made that industry and commerce are more interested in 
students who are well grounded in technical matters than in 
academic proficiency."-^ It is claimed that all employers, 
with very few exceptions, are more interested in young 
people who can read and write languages with clarity, have 
a sound grounding in mathematics, and a keen sense of

responsibility and application. “With these requisites 
the young person can be trained efficiently in the speci¬ 
fic trade or competences required."55 

SUMMARY 

Editors are willing to criticize education. They 
wonder whether it does what it is supposed to do; they call 
into question its effectiveness in this and that area of 
operation; they raise disturbing questions about the in¬ 
struction in "fundamentals"; and they suggest a recapitu¬ 
lation of its aims and ideals. 

Considerable criticism is directed at what is desig¬ 
nated as "progressive education" and at "fads and frills" 
in the curriculum. There appears to be little editorial 
insight into the values involved. Usually the press simply 
reflects popular prejudice. It is unmistakable that educa¬ 
tional leadership has failed to acquaint the public with 
the educational values of many subjects which administrators 
and teachers usually take for granted as essential In any 
modern curriculum. Fortunately, however, in these same 
newspapers, on occasion there is evidence of a willingness 
to welcome innovations and improvements. This justifies 
the hope that, properly presented, innovations and the uti¬ 
lization of experimental results may be favorably received.

While there are some suggestions that the practical , 
vocational side of education is worthy of full development 
editorial opinion tends to give frequent expression to the 
view that the value of education lies in its contributions 
to the cultural side of life. The function of education is 
generally accepted to be that of enrichment of the individ¬ 
uals life. Its purpose is, essentially, to train students 
to think — a mental — discipline concept of education. 

The press looks somewhat longingly toward the "old- 
time education" with its emphasis upon the "three R's". 

The attempt of the present system to reflect the culture of 
its own times with a resultant diversification of the cur¬ 
riculum is scorned. A paring down of the curriculum and a 
return to "fundamentals" is advocated. 

Finally, it must be noted that editorial judgment 
finds education valuable, yet often the analysis of its 
values is not penetrating. Adaptation of education to the 
needs of the day and the needs of the individual is not 
considered very often. It is evident that any reorganiza¬ 
tion of education, demanded by the changing times and by the 
extension of knowledge about human nature will depend upon 
educators. Given educational leadership, the press and the 
public, confident of education’s value, will follow.

CHAPTER VIII 


CURRICULUM 


Editorial comment on curriculum is prolific. It 
ranks third in popularity as an educational topic with 
editors, who devote to it 11.10$ of the editorial space 
alloted to education. The Medicine Hat Daily News expends 
almost one-fifth of Its education editorials on this sub¬ 
ject. 

As revealed in Chapter VII, much of the comment on 
curriculum is critical. Editors question its effectiveness 
and deplore the trend towards diversification. There is a 
greater concern for the maintenance of the cultural values 
than for the inclusion of practical values. The press is 
vociferous in demanding a return to "fundamentals” with a 
resultant de-emphasis on "fads and frills". While some of 
this criticism bears evidence of efforts to see the rela¬ 
tionship between the offerings of the school and the 
objectives of education, it generally lacks the value of 
such a comprehensive view. 

This chapter, dealing specifically with editorial 
opinion about various course offerings, plainly indicates 
that Alberta's editors are interested in what goes into 


the curriculum

TENDENCY TO CRITICIZE INTRODUCTION OF NEW COURSES 


The Edmonton Journal speaking of the Department of 
Education remarks, "Its officers must sometimes feel that 
education, like life, is becoming a bit too complicated. "•*■ 
After reading all the editorials on education appearing 
in the daily newspapers of the province over a period of 
five years it appears that, in general, editors apparently 
share this feeling. The tendency is to demand "a lesser 
emphasis on a bewildering assortment of subjects in favor 
of a simpler selection."^ 

Thus it is not surprising to note a disposition to 
criticize the introduction of what editors regard as 
superficial or extraneous subject matter outside the domain 
of the schools. 

When it is suggested that the schools provide in¬ 
struction in car-driving for high school students, the 
press vehemently opposes it. Typical is this statement by 
the Edmonton Journal: 

Too many frills are bound to weaken the educational 
froth. Teaching, high school pupils to drive an 
automobile is, we submit, an educations,! frill. As 
such, the Department of Education should be most 
reluctant to place it on the high school curriculum.^ 

While agreeing that "... the need for a course in 

motor car operation may be highly urgent"^ it is pointed

out that ". . . it is not the job of the schools and the 
taxpayer to provide it."5 The Edmonton Bulletin observes 

M the ability of a boy or girl to drive a car is more a 
matter for police department inquiry than the responsibility 
of school teachers.In this same editorial it asks, "Is 
social prestige involved in driving a car to be placed on 
the same level as mathematics, language and literature?"? 

The general consensus of opinion is that driver¬ 
training will interfere with basic education and therefore 
should only be considered — if considered at all —by the 
schools as an extra-curricular activity. 

In an editorial entitled "Education For Coal Mining"^ 
the Edmonton Bulletin expresses concern over the proposed 
institution of a coal mining course in some Alberta schools. 
It is afraid that educators are trying to short-circuit 
students into choosing, coal mining as a vocation when they 
are too young to decide wisely on their future occupation. 
Furthermore, it is viewed as too technical a subject to be 
included in the curriculum. 

The Edmonton Journal questions the educational value 
of ceramics in the high school curriculum: 

How many ceramics graduates could write a good 
description of their subject in correctly spelled 
and grammatical English, properly paragraphed and 
punctuated?9

Under the caption "Keep It Out Of The Schools" 10 the 
Edmonton Bulletin airs its views on temperance education* 
Admitting of a need for temperance education this newspaper 
notes that it is . • completely out of line with the 
fundamental meaning of public education. 1,11 Continuing, 
the Bulletin remarks: 

This suggestion takes its place among the ridicu¬ 
lous proposals that public schools also give instruc¬ 
tion in motor car driving and in how to keep out of 
jail. 12 

The press feels that it is a "fallacy that the public 
school system can be made to deliver instruction on every 
conceivable subject In response to every human need." 1 ^ 
Attention is drawn to the fact that both teachers and 
pupils have only so many hours a day for class, that they 
must have a certain period for leisure, so that if a new 
course is added some other course must be dropped. It is 
claimed that at present both the curriculum and the teacher 
are overloaded. 

Another clue to newspaper opposition to the introduc¬ 
tion of new courses may be found in this statement by the 
Edmonton Journal: 

No course should be added in "flush" times that 
would not warrant expenditure in hard times. 1. 

However, in the main editorial resistance to cur¬ 
riculum innovations must be viewed as a manifestation of the

belief of the press that greater emphasis on the "three 
R* s" is the most urgent curricular need of the day. 

ENGLISH AND ALLIED SUBJECTS 


The press is unanimously agreed that the schools 
should allocate more time to the study of English. 

Editors consider "the harshest indictment of Canadian 
educational s3rstems is that too many . . . graduates cannot 
properly express themselves in English, either orally or in 
writing. nl 5 it i s argued that "any educational system ought 
to realize that the study of the language is fundamental to 
the whole system of teaching. 

Whatever else they learn to do, Canadians should be 

taught to speak and write their native tongue properly. 

"The teaching of grammar in our elementary and high 
schools should be resumed immediately," urges the Edmonton 
Journal. Echoing this same cry the Medicine Hat Daily News 
asks: 


What does it profit the high school graduate to be 
able to exclaim " I have the book of my gardener" in 
French when he cannot distinguish between the use of 
"who" and "whom" in English? He may never want to 
tell anybody in French that he has his gardener's book, 
but 100-to-l the occasion will arise when he wishes he 
could express himself correctly in English before a 
prospective employer.18 

Under the heading "Spelling 1948 Style" the Lethbridge 
Herald queries:

How many presumably bright young university or high 
school graduates are there today who are incapable 
of spelling any better than a ten-year-old child? 

. . • bets could undoubtedly be placed and won if 
the figure was placed at more than fifty thousand.^ 

The Calgary Herald notes the connection between poor 

language facility and poor handwriting: 

As we write our young write. And if we compose our 
simple messages with protruding tongue and labored 
breath, we can hardly complain if their scrawls are 
even more blotted and more unintelligible. 2 ^ 

It is suggested that present-day high school students 

“are not well informed on the components of a sentence, their 

spelling is mindful of the second grade”and the way in 

which they back away from reading or writing a story which 

QQ 

involves a few statistics “is something to behold.” 

Revision of the present language program is viewed as being 
imperative. 

In its editorial “Too Many Frills In Education" the 
Medicine Hat Daily News aptly sums up editorial opinion on 
this topic: 

In the rush to add frills the roots of good speech 
have become parched. If the root is nourished, and 
the syntax is properly cultivated, the harvest will 
not suffer idiomatic parasites . . . 2 3 


SOCIAL STUDIES 


Only two aspects of the Social Studies course in 
Alberta schools —history and current events —are topics

for general discussion by newspaper editors. 

Three newspapers, the Lethbridge Herald, the Edmonton 
Bulletin, and the Edmonton Journal, desire a revision of 
current history textbooks to give a balanced treatment of 
French and English, and American and Canadian history. They 
are appalled at the ignorance of each others* history dis¬ 
played by French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians and 
by Canadians, as a group, and Americans. 

Present texts, according to the editors of these news¬ 
papers, are filled with conflicting ideas focusing attention 
on old animosities. It is felt that “schools should be 
emphasizing elements in common not forces which will drive 
them . . . apart,Therefore, it is urged that greater 
emphasis be placed on recent harmonious developments between 
Canada and the United States, and between French and English 
Canadians, to provide a basis for a more up to date under¬ 
standing. 

The Edmonton Journal also appears convinced that 

Relative to its basic importance, history has become 

a somewhat neglected subject in present-day Canadian 

schools. 

This newspaper suggests that history be given back its 
name in the schools and assigned a more important role in 
its program at the expense of instruction in current events. 

24 3B, 5.10.9 
25 EJ, 10.11.0

117 


However, the Calgary Albertan or the Lethbridge 
Herald would not agree to any such paring down of the 
time to be spent studying current events. In fact they 
feel that present instruction in this phase of the social 
studies is inadequate. 

More and more we are realizing the need for more 
comprehensive teaching of current events in our 
schools. In all our high schools no doubt some 
effort is being made to give students an aware¬ 
ness of the significant developments in our con¬ 
temporary life. But often this program is given 
secondary importance. 2 ' ; 

"This should not be," 2 7 argues the Lethbridge Herald. 

If we are to have an informed public in the 
crucial times ahead., current events should be 
•presented frankly and factually to students 

today.28 

Perhaps a generalization of what the Alberta press 
desires is to be found in this excerpt from the Medicine 
Hat Daily News: 

. . . the powers-that-be might give thought to a 
more comprehensive teaching of current events and 
Canadian history — community, provincial and. 
national — in the revised curriculum. 


FRENCH 

Teachers of French may go on their way unperturbed 
by any thoughts of public opposition, if the absence of 
any criticism means anything. 

In line with their belief in the "cultural" aspects

118 


of education editors appear to favor foreign language 
instruction. In fact, one newspaper the Calgary Herald 
in an editorial entitled “Shouldn't We All Be G-ilingual?“30 
urges an increase in the amount of French taught in the 
schools. More realistically, however, the Edmonton Journal 
says the school “should he expected to do — the only thing 
it can do — to teach students to read French and possibly 
write it. “31 

Speaking the language is an entirely different 
proposition, and it can never be learned in the 
classroom.3^ 

The press generally disapproves of substituting grade 
twelve standing in technical electives as an alternative to 
the language requirement necessary for university entrance 
in this province. Editors are in agreement with the view 
aired earlier by Dr. Newton in the Alberta School Tr ustee 
that we must “save a group of people for university training 
who do not find thinking painful . . . or a second language 
redundant . , •" 33 

HEALTH EDUCATION 

The Lethbridge Herald is the only newspaper which 
states its views on this topic. This newspaper is convinced 
that “the promotion of better health among our pre-school 
and school children should be one of our major concerns.“3^

In its opinion "health instruction is the positive duty of 
the teacher,"35 

This job cannot be left to an occasional health talk 
by the school doctor, or the physical director, help¬ 
ful though these may be,36 

In support of the findings of the National Committee 

for School Health Research that we should educate the pupils 

of the schools so they can maintain better health after 

leaving school, the Herald proposes: 

Soxv to live and be healthy, how to raise healthy 
families, how to eat and how to play for best 
health conditions could be made a most interesting 
part of the curriculum,37 

Noting that "we have come a long way in the past 
quarter century in the matter of health conditions in our 
schools,"38 this newspaper observes, however, that "often 
school practices do not keep pace with the lesssons"^^ and 
urges that these conditions be corrected, 

CADET TRAINING 

Although no widespread endorsement of this subject is 
evident, two daily newspapers of the province give it their 
wholehearted support. 

The Lethbridge Herald^O directs attention at the results 
of a recent poll by the Canadian Institute of Public Opinion, 
which revealed that fifty-six per cent of adult Canadians 
are in favor of obligatory school cadet training, as evidence

that this type of training is genuinely desired. 

Commenting on the request of two school board members 
that the cadet corps be abolished in Calgary schools the 
Calgary Herald cries, M The parlor pacifists are at it 
again,”^ and leaps to the support of the cadet corps. 

In spite of the fact that cadet training is the ”pet” 
subject of only certain editors this matter may not be one 
easily tossed aside. Universal military preparedness is 
the order of the day and because the school, as an organized 
institution providing easy access to large numbers of youth, 
offers the most direct route for military education for the 
masses, educational authorities might very well be asked to 
give it some curriculum consideration in the very near future. 

RELIC-IOUS EDUCATION 

"A system of education that does not take the develop¬ 
ment of Ghristian character into account is not a complete 
system,” claims the Edmonton Bulletin. ”lt can even be a 
dangerous system. 

Of what use is secular education without enough 

religious education to give it balance?^ 

These statements are characteristic of this newspaper's 
views on religious education. 

The Calgary Albertan^ believes that both sides of the 
religious education question can be honestly and intelligently 

45 EB, Ibid 
44

42 EB, 5-3.7 


CA, 7.26.9 








121 


supported, yet allies itself with those who protest its 
inclusion in the school curriculum. It is heedful of the 
fact that 

. . . whenever religion is brought into the public 
school, however innocently, it invites a clamor from 
often sincere, but often bigoted, churchmen. It pro¬ 
vides an excuse for an offended group or groups to 
demand their own school*^5 

This newspaper “cannot see why religion cannot be taught 
to a sufficient degree in the church and in the home. “^6 
Noticing the demand in some quarters for religious education 
in the schools it wonders why and asks, “Can it be that there 
are too many tired churchmen and indifferent parents?“^7 

The press as a whole, while not advocating any speci¬ 
fic course of religious instruction, feels that some measure 
of the tenets of Christianity should permeate a more“cul- 
turally-oriented" curriculum. 

SEN EDUCATION 

This possibility, which has served as the center of 
discussion at innumerable gatherings of teachers, parents, 
religionists, and others, is discussed by only one daily 
newspaper in the province, the Edmonton Bulletin. 

In handling this topic the Bulletin used a rather 
unique and commendable approach. An introductory statement 
of the question was placed before the public in its editorial

column^ and interested people were invited to express 
their views on the subject through letters to the editor* 

An overwhelming response was received and the following 
significant opinions were then noted in a subsequent 
editorial: 

The consensus among those who expressed an opinion 
was that sex education should be given in the schools, 
that it should be given separately to boys and girls, 
that it should be accompanied by some sort of ethical 
instruction and that specially qualified persons 
should do the instructing.^ 

Of further significance is the fact that this newspaper 

received only one letter against sex education. Furthermore, 

this single letter of protest was so abusively written that 

the work of a n crank” was indicated. 

Two other editorial comments are worthy of attention. 

One states the conviction “that sex education should be 

taught, not as a separate and isolated subject, but as part 

of a more complete course on all the problems of family 

relationships.”50 <£he other sounds a warning. 

One thing is sure; unless sex education points to 
chastity as the only solution to sex problems amongst 
the unma.rried, it will do much more harm than good. 
Unless absolute continuence is shown to be the only 
alternative to trouble, sex education completely 
misses the point.51 

The non-existence of any comment either for or against 
this subject in the other dailies of the province is disap¬ 
pointing and may indicate that the problem is not yet con¬ 
sidered important enough to warrant much attention; or that

123 


because of its suspected controversial nature, belied by 
the Bulletin's experiment, editors are content to "dodge" 
the issue; or that editors feel that this is one question 
which educators have to decide for themselves. 


TECHNICAL ELECTIVES 

The Medicine Hat Daily News and the Lethbridge Herald 
are the leading proponents of technical education in the 
schools. 

A thorough and impartial survey of technical training 
options is advocated by the Daily News5? to determine their 
value and efficiency. This newspaper is careful to point 
out that "we do not raise this subject with any thought in 
mind of closing the shops. "53 it is just that "we are not 

convinced that vocational shops fulfill the highest purpose 
ii 54 


The proper approach would be a study of how the 
course could be more efficiently improved to equip 
the boy for employment. The aim should be for 
technical training more than vocational instruction.55 

Furthermore: 

It has always struck us that manual training could 
best serve its purpose if available to primary school 
students on a broader scale than at present. Those 
are the formative years when the boy's future bent 
might best be determined , . ♦ His progress would be 
much quicker than under the present school system.56

This study reveals a marked demand in some sections 

of the press for a revision of the agricultural training 

provided by the schools of the province. Disapproval of 

the present course is indicated in the following statements: 

The Herald has always felt very strongly that here 
in Alberta the agricultural training in our public 
and high schools has been in name only. It is but 
a poor excuse.57 

. . . something has been lacking — an appreciation 
of the importance of such work, and a hesitancy to 
give it the support warranted. . .58 

The teaching of agriculture in . . . public and high 
schools is sketchy. It should be improved. 59 

The Lethbridge Herald is afraid that we are educating 

boys and girls off the farms. 

We do not know how to awaken our professional educa¬ 
tors in Alberta to the fact that we are sadly neglec¬ 
ting a very large share of our young people by the 
academic attitude taken towards the teaching of agri¬ 
culture and agricultural mechanics in our schools. 

If they would but realize that 90 cents out of every 
tax dollar comes either directly or indirectly from 
the products of our farms we would perhaps get a 
different approach to the matter. Or perhaps educa¬ 
tors think their main objective in life should be to 
get all the boys .and girls off the farms with the 
least possible delay.50 

This newspaper argues that "what we should have is 

, . . a course in agriculture and its allied mechanical 

requirements as comprehensive in every way as the cource 

for commercial students."51 

And in the case of girls their teaching for life 
on the farm should be domestic science beamed to 
conditions as they actually exist on the farm. 82

Among the vital things which should he taught is that 

. . . the whole economics of a prosperous agriculture 
depends upon the protection of our forests, the control 
of flood waters, and the conservation of our farms and 
grasslands against erosion by wind and water. °3 


The Medicine Hat Daily Hews thinks agricultural options 
should be considered more 11 in the theoretical than practical 
phase." 64 


If biology and genetics were made the base for a new 
course instead of plant science it would undoubtedly 
be found an absorbing and instructive option . . . . 


In another editorial the Medicine Hat Daily News 
optomistically predicts " the day may come when agriculture 
may rank with health, humanities and cultural subjects as 
a must in the curriculum.”^ 


OTHER SUBJECTS 


Comment on other subjects in the curriculum is meagre. 
Commercial options ,^ drama,vocational guidance, ^9 nature 
study, 7° and ceramics,71 are approved in some editorials, 
while in others the trend ” from pure science to applied 
science” ^2 and the study of ceramic s73 is condemned. 

SUMMARY 

Alberta editorial writers are definitely interested 
in what goes into the curriculum — what Alberta children

are asked, to learn* 

They are united in advocating increased emphasis on 
English in the schools, to remedy what is reported to be an 
alarming deficiency in language facility. Greater concentra 
tion on grammar and spelling is urged. Similarly, a more 
important role for history and current events in the curric¬ 
ulum is requested. 

Further observed in the press discussion of curriculum 
is a tendency to ridicule experiment with new courses (per¬ 
haps evidence of the failure of educators, in many cases, 
to use good judgment either in selecting the new material, 
or in cultivating public opinion, preparatory to its intro¬ 
duction) ; avoidance of any broad discussion of sex education 
little criticism of any kind of the instruction in French; 
a restricted endorsement of cadet training and religious 
education; a certain amount of dissatisfaction with the 
present training in health; and a demand for a revision of 
the technical electives, particularly in the field of agri¬ 
culture; and a neglect of the many other school subjects. 

Finally, one leaves the curricular problem with the 
feeling that editors with their lingering devotion to the 
”fundamentals” of traditional education have never really 
forgiven educators for the curriculum innovations of the 


oast decade 




CHAPTER IX 


METHODS AND PROCEDURES 


Educational methods and procedures rank sixth in pop¬ 
ularity with newspaper editors as an education editorial 
theme. Much of this comment is widely scattered over a 
variety of topics, but certain definite convictions regard¬ 
ing issues of importance to educators are discernable. 

INDOCTRINATION 


The Alberta press firmly believes that "if there is 

one place where political bias should not penetrate, that 

place is the schools*"^- Accordingly, a wild clamor ensues, 

particularly in. some newspapers, when it is charged that the 

C.C.F. party in Saskatchewan is using school textbooks to 

propagate its socialist doctrine, and that ninety-five per 

cent of that province’s teachers are proselytizing socialists. 

Perhaps no more vicious proposal has been made in 
the political histry of Canada than that a party 
temporarily in power should seek to perpetuate 
itself in office by stuffing its political tenets 
down the throats of children.2 

... a serious crime against civilization . . .3 

. . . public schools are not to be used as vehicles 
for political propaganda, whether radical or orthodox.^ 

It is ridiculous to say that children should be care¬ 
fully shielded from all forms of political thinking. 

Eut their political education shouuld take the form 
of enabling them to choose intelligently between

128 


various political doctrines. It is apalling 
to suggest that they should be made partisans 
from the cradle.5 

As the foregoing admirably illustrates, the newspapers 
of Alberta would never tolerate such practices in our schools. 
Such a view is highly compatible with the position adopted 
by education leaders and is indeed a healthy sign in a demo¬ 
cratic civilization. 


TEACHING METHODS 


The actual techniques employed in the classroom are 

given attention in a number of editorials. 

An editorial entitled "English As A Tool" appearing 

in the Calgary Albertan suggests that "the study of the 

language ought to be brought closer to present day needs. 

. . . the first step is to get students to see 
English as a useful tool. Once they grasp that 
fact, they will understand that it is worthwhile 
to use it well. Then they will want to develop 
skill and they will accept the drudgery entailed. 

In the process they will learn to appreciate the 
consummate command of the great masters of the 
written or spoken word. 7 

This acceptance of doing, as the best way to learn is, 

however, quite rare amongst editors for they feel that 

. . . there is a danger that courses based on 
this principle may be too practical. Greece and 
Home have given much that should not be lost. 

Linking English with modern life is all very well, 
but today is only the day after yesterday. No 
English teacher — no teacher — can let the oncoming 
generation forget that.^

Most newspapers have a tendency to advocate a return 
to the more formal methods of language training used in 
u grandfather's M day. For example the Edmonton Journal 
nostalgically remarks: 

We would like to see the old-fashioned spelling bee 
become fashionable again, and become a regular feature 
of our secondary and high schools. 9 

The Medicine Hat Daily News found that an editorial 

captioned “Teach Them To Read" appearing in the Chicago 

Daily News struck a responsive chord and reprinted it in 

its editorial column. This editorial claims that educators 

have failed utterly to teach reading. Evidence of this can 

be seen in the "numerous clinics . . . being set up for 

remedial reading. 

Yet the damage done in the early grades, in poor 
reading habits and in the psychological effects' 
of failure to read, can scarcely be repaired 
completely at a later time.11 

Furthermore: 

. . . the evil has gone so far that our children 
are now being taught by a generation of teachers 
who themselves are not good readers.- 1 -- 

In concurring with these opinions the Medicine Hat 
paper proposes that one of the major reforms necessary in 
our educational system is a change in the techniques of 
teaching reading "since those we have do not make reading 
the habitual act it should be for the citizens of a demo¬ 
cracy .

Editors are somewhat less critical of practices 
used in the teaching of social studies. Support is often 
forthcoming for the utilization of community resources 
through field trips by students. Typical is the suggestion 
by the Calgary Albertan that Calgary school children be 
given a chance to sit in on city council meetings because 
such a procedure ”demonstrates civic law-making in a far 
better fashion than any text-book could do.”^ 

Nonetheless, when one Alberta teacher organized his 
social studies instruction around a mock United Nations 
Assembly, the Edmonton Journal took him to task for it. 

This newspaper argues that there is little real understanding 
of the issues by the students, that such procedures are ’’more 
apt to breed glibness and false sophistication.”15 It is 
also feared that instruction in the three-R 1 s suffered as 
these United Nations meetings became more and more demand¬ 
ing of school time. 

One of the more ’’progressive” dailies in the province, 

the Calgary Albertan points out that 

Not the least important of many problems facing 
education today is that of finding a method or 
methods by which the work of the classroom can be 
related to the activities of the outside world.15 

To bridge this gap it is suggested that newspapers be 

used in the classroom. For, it is argued: 

The intelligent teacher with good background, can 
find limitless opportunities in a newspaper for

expanding the vision of her pupils, not into a make- 
believe world, but into the world of reality.17 

The use of film in the schools is accepted by the 

Edmonton Journal and the Lethbridge Herald who agree that 

M films as an educational force in the modern world cannot 

be over-emphasized. Ml ® Yet such modern aids to education, 

as a radio and films, are not without their limitations.“ 

. . . they are stimulating and exciting, but they appeal 

mostly to the emotions rather than to intellect and reason. ”19 

On the whole, it appears that when editors think of 

teaching methods they do so in a critical fashion. As a 

necessary adjunct of the curriculum revision they crave, 

editors would apparently relish a reorganization of present- 

day teaching techniques. 

OTHER EDUCATIONAL PROCEDURES 

In keeping with the longing for “old-time“ education, 
which permeates many of the editorials appearing, in the 
dailies of the province, it is not surprising to find 
editors prescribing a need for stern discipline and orderly 
routine of the "old" school. 

“Possibly there are better modern methods” 2 ® to elevate 
the standards of behavior of school students, says the 
Calgary Herald. “If there are we should like to see them.“ 2 ^ 
Until they are revealed, “we shall continue to believe that

uplift has something to do with the seat of the pants." 22 

This same idea is stated more emphatically by the 
Medicine Hat Daily News. 

We have yet to be convinced that the kid-glove method 
of correction provides one iota of advancement over 
the old-fashioned visit to the woodshed or the firm 
application of a judicious hand to a posterior point. 2 3 

Certain sections of the press, namely the Edmonton 

Journal and the Medicine Hat Daily News, are extremely 

critical of present practices governing promotions from 

grade to grade. The following statement is illustrative: 

The propostition that all students should be pro¬ 
moted each year whether good, bad or indifferent 
results were achieved on their term's course of 
studies is . . . ridiculous. 2 ^ 

The feeling is that students are encouraged to be¬ 
lieve that negligence and accomplishment merit the same 
return, thereby fostering an unhealthy attitude which makes 
for a very real handicap in trying to get along in the work- 
a-day world. Therefore, it is only natural for the Edmonton 
Journal, under the caption "Passing High School Failures," 2 5 
to try to discourage the “normal distribution" of marks as 
being unfair. 

Reaction to the announcement of the Alberta government's 

intention to institute a special summer school term for grade 

twelve students is conditioned by this belief. 

The move is an excellent one, if it is designed to 
meet special situations and not simply to stimulate

laggards and incompetents into continuing to 

university* 26 

Editors are not in agreement on the question of whether 
or not free textbooks should be provided for school children 
Some feel they should provided and "the responsibility for 
this service should rest with the provincial government, 
rather than with the individual school boards." * 2 ? others 
argue that only the needy should receive them, or that the 
need is really in the rural communities, not in the large 
cities. The Edmonton Bulletin, however, is definitely 
opposed to any such move. 

. . . this is no time to talk about expending educa¬ 
tion money on the public when the crying need is for 
more money to spend on teachers’ salaries and school 
buildings and other educational facilities.28 

Continuing its opposition to free textbooks this news¬ 
paper shrewdly adds: 

. . . the need in education today is for a greater 
contribution from the public towards education, not 
less. The public does not pay nearly enough for 
education.29 

Topics such as the value of work experience, absente¬ 
eism, scholarships, physical examinations of school children 
immunization programs, examinations, pre-school registration 
school safety patrols, the junior red cross, and school 
festivals were discussed rather scantily in many editorials. 
The fact that these subjects were, in most cases, reviewed 
in a commonplace fashion denies them more than passing 
mention.

SUMMARY 

The scattered discussion of educational methods 
and procedures reveals that editors are opposed to indoc¬ 
trination, and to present practices with regard to pro¬ 
motion in the schools. They are critical of the methodo¬ 
logy in English, particularly of instruction in reading, 
and apparently favor the older techniques based on memo¬ 
rization and drill. Stern discipline, maintained by cor¬ 
poral punishment when necessary, is advocated. No unani¬ 
mity of opinion exists when the provision of free text¬ 
books is considered. 

Some sections of the press recognize the value of 
audio-visual-aids, field trips, and newspapers to the 
school in its task of relating the work in the classroom 
to the activities of the outside world. 

Although 8.04^ of all the editorials on education 
deal with methods and procedures the quality of the comment 
is disappointing. It is apparent that educators, in their 
never-ending quest for greater efficiency, must face the 
problem of modifying their methodology without the benefit 
of much guidance from public opinion as expressed in 


editorial columns.

CHAPTER X 


OTHER EDITORIAL COMMENT ON EDUCATION 

Considered in this chapter are editorials related to 
the school plant, adult education, vocational education, 
students, and extra-curricular activities. These editorials 
comprise 28.09 per cent of the writing done in editorial 
columns on education by the editors of the six daily news¬ 
papers in the province. y A breakdown of the number of 
editorials per newspaper per topic can be found in Table 
III. 

Much of the comment on these subjects in the Alberta 
press was either repetitive or inconclusive. For these 
reasons the incorporation of the five topics into one 
chapter was felt to be justifiable. 

THE SCHOOL PLANT 

A study of the editorials reveals that the Alberta 

press is wholeheartedly in favor of the expansion programs 

being undertaken by the various school boards throughout 

the province. Editors point out that 

There is an obligation on each generation to provide, 
to the extent that if is possible, for universal ed¬ 
ucation to see that there are adequate school facili¬ 
ties for every child. 1 

Newspaper awareness of the pressing need for more 
school buildings and equipment, and their enthusiastic 
support for such increases are indicated in the statements

which follow: 

We must recognize • . • that we have reached a period 
when new public building programs, including schools, 
will have to be undertaken, and though we may quail a 
bit when we first hear the cost ... we will have to 
admit . . . they are necessary if we are to keep up 
with the times.2 

Probably even a man with a lantern would find it dif¬ 
ficult to find in Edmonton a citizen, even a ratepayer 
who would deny that new schools are and will be needed. 3 

New school buildings are becoming imperative.^ 

Lethbridge has done little to increase school accommo¬ 
dation since the twenties, but now . . . the need is 
being driven home and we will have to take action soon. 5 

Present high costs will act as a brake on expenditures, 
but the board will not be able to wait indefinitely 
for a break in prices before launching a substantial 
building program.6 

There is no doubt about the need for additional school 
accommodation.7 

It could be said that almost any building in Edmonton 
is important and essential. But can anyone think of 
anything more urgently necessary than the provision 
of adequate structures for the training of youth?^ 

No greater reproach could be levelled against any pro¬ 
vince than to say that even one of its schools was 
primitive, because primary education is the most vital 
asset a province can have. 9 

... it is common knowledge that Edmonton's school 
equipment and school plants fall far below the stan¬ 
dard that should prevail to maintain the educative 
process at its highest peak of efficiency.10 

The Calgary Herald, in editorials captioned "We're 

Building Too Much Too Quickly"H and "The Manchester School:

Let It Wait” 12 argues that schools should not be built 

during this era of high building costs. However, what is 

substantially the view of the other newspapers in the 

province is expressed in the following excerpt: 

If we have schools . • . and have them paid for; we 
will be able to withstand a considerable recession 
and still have the use of the plant built now when 
we have more money than Alberta ever had to spend.15 

Failure of the public to "realize that education is 

essentially a costly business "1^ and to provide the 

necessary funds to improve school plants is recognized by 

the press: 

The only reason that essential improvements are not 
made ... in the matter of school plants ... is 
because these things cost money and the public has 
not yet been trained to the point of paying adequately 
for education.15 

What the people of Alberta must begin to understand 
is that education costs money. To be efficient, it 
must cost a great deal more money than it is costing 
now. Adequate school buildings must be erected 
wherever they are needed.1° 

Editors are united in their demand that the provincial 
government "consider a. measure of greater assistance to the 
municipalities. f,1 7 The government is urged to subsidize 
school building. If this idea is repugnant then the Edmonton 
Journal suggests: 

... it might give consideration to the setting up 
of a revolving fund for this form of assistance, the 
money being made available "interest free".18

Another solution, commonly suggested by editors, is 

offered by the Calgary Herald: 

Wise expenditures on a good new school building is 
an investment in the future in the best sense of 
the word, and an ideal destination for our oil 
money. 19 

In the editorial comment on this topic is a noticeable 
appeal for greater community use of the schools. The Med¬ 
icine Hat Daily News believes “the public desires • . • 
greater use of school buildings." 2 0 m a demand that rural 
schools become community centres," 2 ! is also reported by 
the Lethbridge Herald. 

"What can rural schools as at present organized do 
to make rural living more attractive?" 22 Here is one 
newspaper’s answer: 

Schools should be for more than teaching boys and 
girls in academic subjects. They should be centres 
of training for living, and especially living on the 
10,000 farms of the Province. They should be a 
gathering place for both pupils and parents where all 
the problems of rural living are discussed, and where 
art and culture have their place in making the lives 
of our farm families brighter and generally pleasanter. 

It is proposed that use of the school by the whole 
community, not just the students, "can make the word, "com¬ 
munity" mean something in the district which it serves." 2 ^ 
Having this in mind the Lethbridge Herald, gladly supports 
increased expenditures for schools. "They provide essential 
educational, social, cultural and recreational outlets in

the communities and pay off in a large way." 2 5 

Only two adverse references to expansion of the school 
plants throughout the province were found in this investi¬ 
gation. Eecause they differ markedly from other expressions 
of opinion on this topic cognizance must be taken of them. 

“Sometimes one feels that too much has been spent on 
the physical plant and not enough on the intellectual, the 
teacher," 2 6 remarks the Edmonton Journal. This newspaper 
senses that as a result of this misplaced emphasis the pre¬ 
sent teacher shortage has resulted. 

Somewhat similar is the Calgary Herald's position stated 
in its editorial "Buildings Alone Don't Make Schools." 

It is possible to have the finest and most expensive 
collection of school buildings in the world and still 
not Imve an educational system worth the name. It is 
equally possible to provide the finest quality of 
teaching in a bare room equipped with nothing more 
than a few books and a few chairs and desks. 

Continuing, it points out: 

. . . you cannot create an educational system by 
means of fluorescent lights and air conditioning. 

It is a process which goes on in the mind; and it 
is on the mind — of both students and teachers 
alike — that we should concentrate first. 

As a rule, however, editors appear convinced that 

. . . many a child conceives an intense and irradi- 
cable aversion to education simply because schools 
are squalid, crowded and inconvenient. 2 9

For this reason editors are unstinting in their praise 
for any extension or improvement of educational facilities. 


VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 


Although the daily newspapers of the province are 

leading proponents of “cultural values" in education, they 

realize that vocational education merits a place in any 

educational system. This reaction by the Lethbridge Herald 

to a suggestion that vocational education be virtually 

abolished typifies editorial opinion: 

It is all very well to urge a higher and more 
liberal educational standard. But don’t overlook 
the fact that vocational training whether it be 
in the school, in the industry or in the business, 
must produce the goods and the profits out of which 
the costs of a liberal education may be paid. Ed¬ 
ucation does not pay for itself while it is being 
aca_uired. 30 

The Edmonton Journal and Medicine Hat Daily News lend 
their support to a drive for more vocational schools through¬ 
out the province. They argue that "the gap between those 
able to obtain university training and those unable to ad¬ 
vance much beyond high school should be bridged by some such 
instruction as that which can be obtained at vocational 
centres."31 Further, it is pointed out that 

... in the labor market the emphasis is now 
placed upon trained men and women and those 
lacking specialized training will be under a 
decided handicap when they enter the industrial 

world.32 


3°LH, 3.24.0 
^MHDN, 1.22.7 


32 mhdn , 3.20.7 


















'i 












This demand for increased vocational training is 

viewed by the Medicine Hat Daily News as 

. . , really a part of the trend toward an extension 
of educational facilities of which the agitation for 
a branch of the university in Calgary is another 
indication.33 

"Consequently," it adds, "the effort to establish a 
technical training school here is in line with the expansion 
of the provincial education system which must come."3^ And 
a perusal of the editorial references to vocational educa¬ 
tion in other newspapers reveals a marked tendency for all 
editors to think along the same lines. 

This desire for an extension of educational facilities 
is indicated by the demand of the southern newspapers for 
more agricultural schools. 

. . . Alberta »s big need is for an agricultural 
course for teen-agers which would fit them as 
better farmers and farm women, a course which would 
be practicable and would make for better farm living 
in Alberta generally.35 

The Lethbridge Herald directs attention at the south’s 
special agricultural problems — irrigation, dry land wheat 
farming, and sugar beet farming — and speaks for the rest 
when it says: 

We believe that our special problems require 
special training, and that it is only fair that 
the young people should be given an opportunity 
near home to acquire that training.3o

Therefore, “South Alberta is hopeful that ... we 
will see a school of agriculture established in this area . .“37 
Nor would this school be restricted to agriculture. If 
the editors of the four southern dailies had their way it 
would also include mechanical and other types of vocational 
training. 

The Edmonton Journal and the Calgary Herald express 
great concern over the present shortage of trained nurses and 
nurses' aides in a number of editorials and thus approve of 
the government's proposal to open one or more central schools 
of nursing. Perhaps their reason for doing so is best stated 
in the Herald's editorial “Magnificent Training —Magnificent 
Exploitation?" 

. . . the use of student nurses as cheap labor in 
hospitals, -under the guise of “education", should 
come to a speedy end.38 

Other types of vocational education find ready support 
in the press as well. For example the Edmonton Bulletin- 5 - 
recommends on-the-job training, the Edmonton Journal^ 0 
approves of a course in restaurant management at the Pro¬ 
vincial Institute of Technology and Art, and the Calgary 
Herald^-1 urges the establishment of a borstal school to 
provide technical training aimed at rehabilitating first- 
offenders.

Vocational training is playing an increasingly 
greater part in today*s progress, and it is hoped 
that Alberta, out of its expanding revenues, will 
not overlook this phase of our educational system.42 

STUDENTS AND THEIR ACTIVITIES 

References to the ability of students and their 
activities are widely scattered throughout the editorial 
columns of the daily newspapers of Alberta. In an endeav¬ 
or to bring this material together the comment will be 
considered newspaper by newspaper in the hope that some 
rather definite opinions will emerge. 

The Edmonton Bulletin exhibits concern over vanda- 
lism4b at the schools, truancy and juvenile delinquency.44 
It feels that students should be more rigidly controlled 
and that “teachers who fail to investigate with utmost care 
every case of absenteeism are helping to encourage delin¬ 
quency 11 ^ Controversies over what is worn to school by 
girls in the way of clothing are called “ridiculous”46 
An editorial entitled “Sniping At Youth's Amusements”^ 
defends high school dances and terms criticism of them 
silly. This newspaper recommends instruction in automo¬ 
bile driving as a “fine extra-curricular activity.”^ 0 
“Youth”, says the Medicine Hat Daily News”, needs 
adult aid“49 to guide their activities.

It is not sufficient to provide facilities and 
.give money if personal leadership by responsible 
men and women of integrity is lacking .50 

This newspaper also argues that young people should 

remain in school as long as it is economically feasible, 

and urges parents to “make a special effort to give their 

children a high school education.“51 it is alarmed at the 

number of students who are not completing their education 

and points out that “no one can have too much education.“5 2 

Students are criticized for reportedly holding to the 

"idea . . . that there can be reward without quest; that 

achievement and negligence should receive the same reward. “53 

The Daily News claims that 

Too few 3 >-oung people appreciate the need of appli¬ 
cation in school studies to get the greatest bene¬ 
fit that education has to offer in assisting them 
to reach their goal in life. 54 

Agreement is expressed with the work being done in the 
Medicine Hat Schools with regard to providing athletic 
recreation for the students. The school 1 s hockey system is 
especially commended.55 

The Calgary Albertan is afraid that as a result of the 

“ numerous distractions open to pupils in other ho\irs“56 

their school work will suffer. It feels that 

present day pupils are victims of an age of trans¬ 
ition from the relatively quiet concentration of the

past to a present of atomic blasts that shake 
their world in all directions.57 

An editorial entitled " Letting The School Children 


Down 11 ^ castigates a certain school board for its neglect 


to provide better facilities and relieve overcrowding in 
some of its schools. 

Because the education level is universally higher 
today, it is discriminatory to deprive certain 
children of the usual facilities in the name of 
overcrowding or some other easily corrected fault.59 

“Every child, in city or country, has an equal right 

to the fullest educational opportunities possible, “50 

observes the Lethbridge Herald. The value of the present 

opportunities provided is questioned.: 

There is a lack of satisfaction on the part of 
the public with products ofthe high schools of 
today, and the fact that less than half the 
pupils finish their courses would indicate that 
there is a lack of satisfaction on the part of 
the pupils because the academic courses to which 
they are committed by departments of education are 
not worth effort necessary for graduation. 51 

However, the Herald does not believe the academic 

courses should be neglected for it believes: 

. . . that the products of the average high 
school today . . . are not well informed on the 
components of a sentence, their spelling is often 
mindful of the second grade, and the way in which 
they back away from reading or writing a story 
which involves a few statistics is something to 
behold. 52 

Students 1 choice of reading material is defended by 
this newspaper.

We doubt if the child of today is very much off 
the beam in his reading. What is important is 
that the young people should acquire a reading 
habit. If the comics will help to take them to 
the daily newspaper some good is bound to result.^3 

A strike by school students at Blairmore over such 

things as dirty windows elicits the following response: 

Better look out boys and girls. Remember the days 
when Moms used to look behind ears for dirt and 
frequently found it? Now this isn't a "dirty dig" 
students, just a passing word of caution as the 
"strike" . . . moves into its second stage. Teachers 
and trustees might start looking behind your ears 
and making sure your finger nails are clean.64 

School papers are upheld by the Herald which hopes 
that they will take "an increasing part, in the development 
of community interest in the schools. "^5 

The Edmonton Journal rarely deals editorially with 
students or their activities. Its only comment expresses 
disfavor with the school children's strike at Blfirmore, 0 ^ 
and urges that car driving training be considered as an 
extra-curricular activity.^7 

By contrast, the Calgary Herald discusses this topic 
at some length. This newspaper feels "that present-day 
students . . » aren't primarily interested in the acqui¬ 
sition of knowledge". ^8 As a result- "probably much of the 
blame must be placed on the students"69 for their reported 
lack of ability to use the English language.

"What benefit high school students derive from fra¬ 
ternity or sorority activities is doubtful,"7° argues the 
Herald in an editorial claiming that there are too many 
student organizations in our schools. In its discussion 
of extra-curricular activities it contends that 

Once they begin to interfere with the students 
normal school activities, they have overstepped 
their function.71 

One editorial rebukes students for failure to attend 
the showing Of the films Henry V in Calgary, 72 another 
points out the high cost of providing special cut-rate 
student tickets for use on the local transportation system, 7 ^ 
while another wonders if the lack of diversified training 
is encouraging students to leave high school before comp¬ 
leting the required course of studies. 7 ^ 

As the foregoing discussion admirably illustrates, no 
great unanimity of opinion exists when newspapers discuss 
school students and their many activities. 

SUPPORT FOR ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS 

A study of the fifty-one editorials dealing with this 
subject reveals an overwhelming enthusiasm amongst editors 
for any kind of adult education. 

Numerous editors attest to the value of courses for 
adults in first aid, recreational leadership, music, art,

water safety, traffic safety, marriage, agriculture, and 
basic English and citizenship for new Canadians. The 
Department of Agriculture, the Banff School of Fine Arts, 
the Western Board of Music, and the University of Alberta*s 
Extension Department are commended for their work in this 
area. 

Of importance to educators is the belief held by 
some sections of the press about home and school associa¬ 
tions. These organizations are viewed as having as their 
primary purpose the education of parents about the schools 
and for that reason are whole-heartedly endorsed. 

SUMMARY 

The one hundred and fifty-eight editorials examined 
in this section disclose certain viewpoints of importance 
to educators. 

Obviously the support of the press can be enlisted 
for any reasonable expansion of educational facilities. 

The large number of editorials upholding school building 
programs attests to this. Further assistance is also 
evidenced for proposals soliciting increased financial 
contributions by the government for the extension and 
development of school plants. 

In some sections of the daily press a concerted 
drive for greater community use of the schools is noticeable.

The school is envisaged as the cultural and recreational 
focal point for all members of the community. This coin¬ 
cides with the editorial belief in the value and desira¬ 
bility of adult education. Clearly, this attitude consti¬ 
tutes a direct challenge to educators to make the school 
a powerful and direct influence for the betterment of life 
in the whole province. 

The vocational side of education is worthy of full 
development, according to editors. References to this 
subject- deal particularly withthe need for an extension 
of vocational training facilities in the southern part of 
the province. A school of agriculture is proposed as a 
nucleus for such an institution. 

When editors think of students and student activities, 
few general themes stand out. A rather general adherence 
to the principle that every boy and girl is entitled, on 
an equal basis, to the fullest educational opportunities 
is most evident. 

Some newspapers rebuke students for their lack of 
application to their studies. Much of the reported lack 
of language facility and the failure of many students to 
complete high school is attributed to student lethargy 
arising from dissatisfaction with the academic nature of 
the present school program. 

The value of extra-curricular activities is questioned 
by some editors and championed by others.

CHAPTER XI 


SUMMARY OF THE MAJOR COMMENT 

Certain conclusions can be drawn concerning the more 
important findings and implications of this study. In this 
final chapter no effort will be made to repeat the illustra¬ 
tive material out of which these conclusions, and the result¬ 
ant suggestions to educators, have developed. 

SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS 

To begin with, it is now possible to state to what 
extent education is a subject for editorial treatment in 
the newspapers of Alberta. In the six daily newspapers, 
selected as representative of the press in this province, 
the editorials on education numbered 883 in five years. 

This number constitutes about three per cent of all edi¬ 
torials on all topics printed during this period in these 
newspapers. Whether the share of attention education 
receives is enough, too little, or too much, cannot be 
determined — if it can be determined at all —without 
considering the many other problems clamoring for attention. 
Nonetheless, in terms of the importance of education in 
the lives of our people, attested to by editors in their 
columns, education does not appear to be awarded the atten¬ 
tion it merits. 

Is the editorial treatment of education favorable or

unfavorable? Only in tbe realms of educational finance 
and tbe efficiency of tbe curriculum does tbe amount of 
adverse comment outweigh that which is favorable. On tbe 
whole, tbe press is revealed as a patron of education 
intent upon stimulating the development of a system of 
education which is the acme of efficiency, not the nega¬ 
tion of it. This offers encouragement to the view that a 
more cooperative relationship between the press and school 
is possible. 

When topics receiving little editorial comment are 
noted, it is evident that several questions of great con¬ 
cern to educators are largely ignored. Such things as, 
methods and procedures in teaching, sex education, treat¬ 
ment of controversial issues in the classroom, success or 
failure of students, tenure of teachers, provision for 
individual differences, guidance counselling, business 
education, health services, specific school subjects, and 
student needs receive scant attention in editorial columns. 
The omission of these areas of educational endeavor from 
editorial discussion indicates a lack of information on 
what the schools are trying to do. So does the obvious 
lack of sympathy for some of the activities included in 
the curriculum, the lack of recognition given to public 
school administrators, and the common editorial misconcep¬ 
tion that the schools have forgotten the "three R's". From 
this it follows that there is a need for some method where-

by newspaper editors and the public at large can learn 
what the schools are doing, or are failing to do, about 
many things. 

Higher Education . This study reveals that the field 
of higher education shares the centre of editorial atten¬ 
tion with issues relating to educational finance. Of no 
small importance is the fact that, in four of the six 
newspapers studied, the favorite education editorial 
theme was higher education. Primary and secondary educa¬ 
tion directly affect the lives of the vast majority of 
Alberta 1 s citizens. Yet one-fourth of the editorial com¬ 
ment on education has to do with the stratosphere of the 
educational system. 

The volume of comment on this topic may be the result 
of the more highly publicized nature of university activi¬ 
ties. Public school administrators might well find in¬ 
creased publicity activity productive in terms of greater 
press interest, not to mention the resultant increase in 
school-community accord. 

Educational Fi nance . Of perhaps greater importance 
is the interest of the press in the money side of educa¬ 
tional problems. Educational finance not only ranks 
second in popularity with editors as a topic for editorials, 
but it also pervades their discussion of such subjects as 
teachers, school plants, administration, and the expansion

of educational facilities. It may be stated as an indis¬ 
putable fact that the financial aspects of education most 
often claims the attention of the press. 

Editors are aware that more money must be spent on 
education and indeed advocate that this be done. Often 
there is a careful analysis of, and abundant support for, 
genuine measures of financial reform. 

Of note is the demand by the press for a broad reorgan¬ 
ization of the tax base growing out of abelief in the utter 
unsuitability of the tax on real estate as a source of 
revenue for the schools. Responsibility for meeting the 
increased expenditures necessary for education is placed 
squarely on the shoulders of the provincial government. 

The provincial authority is urged to pay at least fifty 
percent of the cost of basic education, to provide subsi¬ 
dies or set up a revolving fund to finance school building 
programs, to increase grants to the university, and to 
provide scholarships fa*needy students. 

Endorsement of government aid does not extend, except 
in the field of technical education, to the advocacy of 
federal aid for education. The press is wary of the uni¬ 
formity and control it believes to be implicit in its 
application. 

Administration. Local control of education is cham-

pioned by editors who vigorously resist any attempts at 
centralization of administration. The County Act is 
generally condemned as a threat to the freedom and effic¬ 
iency of education. School boards are, as a rule, commended 
for meeting their responsibilities in an exemplary manner. 
Only when there is disregard of the public will, or unres¬ 
ponsiveness to the public interest, does criticism mount. 

Administrators . The treatment of education in the 
Alberta press suggests that the administrative group in 
our schools have failed to impress their leadership on the 
social scene. There are several editorial references to 
administrators, but practically all of them are to the 
heads of higher educational units. The tone of the ref¬ 
erences to the chiefs of higher education and their acts, 
indicates a respect and regard for them as leaders in the 
life of the province. However, no such view of public 
school administrators is evident. 

The almost complete lack of editorial comment on 
them may be the result of failure on the part of editors 
to recognize the valuable nature of the services rendered 
by public school administrators, or it may be owing, in 
part, to the very nature of the public school administra¬ 
tor's duties which, when performed satisfactorily, do not 
occasion public interest. It might also be explained on 
the ground that administrators of the public schools have

failed to be as useful, as influential as they could have 
been. 

Whatever the cause the sobering fact is that the work 
of public school administrators does not seem to have made 
any visible impression on newspaper editors. They might 
well pause to examine their actions in an effort to deter¬ 
mine why this is so. 

Teachers . If newspaper comment reflects the public’s 
attitude toward the personnel of schools, we must acknow¬ 
ledge that the general feeling toward, teachers is good. 

Their essential position in a democratic civilization is 
recognized and. their rights as individuals jealously 
defended. 

The press consistently urges an increase in teachers’ 
salaries to a level commensurate with the importance of 
their job. Seldom were editorials found, which indicated 
that the salaries of teachers were anywhere nearly adequate. 
Apparently teachers have convinced, editors, if not school 
board-s, of the legitimacy of their salary demands. 

Present low salaries are viewed as the crux of the 
educational problem throughout Canada, and as being directly 
reflected in the existing teacher shortage. The opinion is 
commonly expressed that the solution to problems of teacher 
shortage and teacher status is to be found by increasing 
salaries to the point where more stringent requirements for

entrance into the profession can become operative. 

Unanimity also exists on the teacher training issue. 

The press is convinced that teaching is an arduous task 
requiring intensive training and consummate skill. As a 
result it is extremely critical of any attempts to decrease 
the amount of basic training required by teachers. A 
training period of at least two years, but preferably more, 
is strongly advocated. 

Although a genuine friendliness for the teacher is 
revealed in this investigation, certain editors appear some¬ 
what reluctant to grant teachers the professional status to 
which they aspir-e. This hesitancy is based upon the belief 
that the general calibre of the teaching body is not worthy 
of such recognition, and that the approach adopted by 
teachers to the solution of their problems is not the sort 
of thing associated with professional standards. The 
feeling is that many ofthe teacher’s problems are of their 
own making, resulting from their failure to organize them¬ 
selves into a truly professional body and set up their own 
standards. 

Expansion of Education . Editors insist on equality 
of opportunity in education as a working principle. Accord¬ 
ingly, they wholeheartedly support the expansion programs 
being undertaken at the elementary, secondary, and univer¬ 
sity levels of our educational system. Press belief in the

decentralization of educational facilities is evidenced 
by the vociferous demand on the part of the newspapers 
in the southern half of the province that a branch uni¬ 
versity and a school of agriculture be established in 
that area. 

Vocational education . While preferring a culturally- 
oriented curriculum editors recognize the merits of voca¬ 
tional education as a bridge over the gap existing between 
schooling and. life. A reorganization of the vocational 
education program with more schools for technical training, 
stategically placed throughout the province, is urged. 

Adult education . The press is remarkably alert to 
the possibilities of adult education. Of significance is 
the conviction that the school should assume a major role 
in providing recreational and educational leadership for 
the community as a whole. In this opinion that the school 
should not be restricted to the traditional task of training 
the young is a direct challenge to educators to broaden the 
scope of the educational program. 

Curriculum efficiency . Two salient points stand out 
in the attitude of the press toward the curriculum and the 
effectiveness of our present system of education. The 
first is the interest exhibited in these topics judging 
by the quantity of the comment on this subject what is 
taught in the schools is apparently of considerable impor-

tance to editors. The second is the prevailing lack of 
understanding of the nature and purposes of many of the 
elements criticized. Most editors scarcely appreciate 
the factors which enter into curriculum-planning of to¬ 
day with its social-civic aim. 

Numerous editorials question the efficiency of the 
curriculum claiming that school graduates lack competence 
in fundamental processes and asking about the political, 
social, and economic leadership being provided for the 
province by its schools. Attacks are launched at pro¬ 
gressive education and "fads and frills" in the curricu¬ 
lum with a return-to "the fundamentals" recommended. 

Editors tend to deplore the widening of the field 
of subject matter, condemn specialization, and attack 
educators for becoming too "practical". From the primary 
grades right through to university they propose a mental- 
discipline concept of education designed to provide what 
is argued to be a well-rounded education. 

Curriculum innovations aimed at providing for indiv¬ 
idual differences arising from the necessity of dealing 
with a wider range of student abilities, and consistent 
with the concept of the value of education as preparation 
for life, are frequently viewed as so much educational 
froth. It is evident that traditional views of education

are so firmly held by editors, and quite likely by 
ordinary citizens as well, that vigorous action by 
educators in defense of these readjustments is necessary,. 
Educators must launch a program to acquaint the public 
with the motives underlying the changes in Alberta*s 
educational system during the past decade. 

SUGGESTIONS TO EDUCATORS 

Prior to setting forth any suggestions developing 
out of this study it seems advisable to direct attention 
to a significant aspect of the relationship of editorial 
comment on education to the theory and practice of educa¬ 
tion. 

This study has revealed that modifications in educa*- 
tional practice in this province in recent years have tended 
to correlate markedly with opinions expressed in the edi¬ 
torial columns of Alberta*s newspapers. Evidence of this 
is to be found in the shelving of the government's pro¬ 
posal in 1946 to shorten the teacher training program, and 
its withdrawal, in the same year, of a bill introduced in 
the legislature giving the Minister of Education control 
over school board secretary-treasurers, both of which met 
with violent press opposition. It can also be seen in 
the increased financial contributions by the government 
to education, which have always been strongly urged by

editors. And, more recently, the establishment of the 
Calgary Branch of the University of Alberta and the high 
curriculum revision aimed at improving students 1 mastery 
of the "three R's" have been indicative of this same trend. 

It thus appears that in the past editors have suc¬ 
ceeded in reflecting, molding, and directing public opin¬ 
ion to a high degree. Education is a public function and 
as such is subject to the tides of public opinion. When 
educators consider this fact, the press, as a mirror of 
public opinion, becomes of great importance. Workers in 
the schools might well profit from a constant and careful 
perusal of the opinions expressed in newspaper editorials. 

With the findings of this study in mind, the follow¬ 
ing suggestions are offered to educators for their consid¬ 
eration: 

1. That, since education is dependent upon the 
public will for its continuing function, they cultivate 
an awareness of the public viewpoint on education, and 
that newspaper editorial columns be examined as one 
indicator of the public viewpoint. 

2* That steps be taken to disseminate correct 
information to the public about the aims, curriculum, 
methods and procedures of the school. 

3* That preparatory to the introduction of new 
educational policies, new courses of study, new methods,

or any new project, the public be adequately informed 
of their purpose in an effort to enlist its support, 

4. That the school endeavor to make itself a con¬ 
tinuing and influential part of the ordinary life of 
Alberta by assuming greater responsibility for adult 
education, 

5. That the teaching body take action to make 
itself truly worthy of higher status by increasing the 
calibre of its members, establishing its own standards, 
and. adopting a more professional attitude toward the 
solution of its problems, 

6. That educators, particularly administrators, 
increase their status by launching a program designed to
