INTRODUCTION 


The work as outlined in this thesis deals with 
the modification of the properties of cotton lj.nters 
brought about by alternate wetting and drying cycles. 
These changes in properties are revealed by accessib¬ 
ility measurements, degree of nitration, viscosity 
determinations of the nitrates and lead tetraacetate 
oxidation of the nitrates. 

Cellulose, one of the polysaccharides, constit¬ 
utes the major portion of the skeleton structure of 
higher plants. Technically speaking, “cellulose" 
denotes the residues obtained by subjecting vegetable 
material to certain pulping processes (1), The purest 
form of raw cellulose is obtained from two types of 
hair found on the cotton seed, namely, lint and fuzz 
fibers, more commonly called cotton and cotton linters, 
respectively. Lint fibers are chiefly used in the 
textile industry, whereas cotton linters find their 
greatest use in the preparation of chemical cotton 
which is subsequently used for the manufacture of such 
products as nitro-celluloses and rayons. 

The now generally accepted concept of the cellulose 
molecule (Fig, 1) is the result of more than one hundred 
years of research on the behaviour of celD-ulose under 
the most varied treatments. This expresses the chemical 
behaviour of cellulose. Upon complete hydrolysis only

D«^lucose is produced. It is believed that the cell« 
ulose molecule in the natural state contains several 
thousand glucose anhydride units linked through the 1 
and 4 carbon atoms with a ^-glucosidal linkage. However^ 
it must be understood that cellulose does not consist 
of identical molecules of the same length. The term 
’’degree of polymerization” represents an average value 
for the number of glucose anhydride units in the cell¬ 
ulose molecule in any sample of cellulose. Thus the 
degree of polymerization of cotton lint is 2020, whereas 
that of cotton linters is 1440 (1). Partially hydrol¬ 
yzed cellulose may drop into the range 50-500 and still 
retain the characteristics of cellulose. 

Different theories regarding the physical struc¬ 
ture of cellulose fibers have been advanced by many 
workers during the past ninety years. Nageli (2), one 
of the first of the cellulose chemists, postulated 
that all cellulose fibers were built up of submicros- 
copic, anisotropic crystalline particles which he call¬ 
ed micelles. Herzog (2), considered the fiber to be a 
two-phase system, consisting of a crystalline and an 
inter-crystalline material. Mark (3)f in his summary 
of the theories of cellulose structure, stated that in 
addition to the crystallized portions, each cellulose 
filament contains an appreciable amount of amorphous.

or at least badly disordered material (Fig« 2 )^ The 
tenacity and strength of the cellulose are located 
in the crystals^ the elasticity and extensibility in 
the amorphous portions» 

Nickerson and Habrle ( 4)5 by use of a different¬ 
ial hydrolytic method of analyses^ foimd that 5 in pur¬ 
ified cotton fibers 9 cellulose appeared to exist in 
three distinguishable states of organization* The 
three states, amorphous, mesomorphous, and crystall¬ 
ine, are present in amounts of 3^5 3.^? snd 94^, res¬ 
pectively, The amorphous cellulose is characterized 
by its highly h^rgroscopic nature and by a minimum of 
resistance to hydrolysis, Mesomorphous or transitional 
cellulose appears to hydrolyze less readily and to he 
more heterogeneous. Crystalline cellulose exhibits 
high and uni-^orm resistance to hydrolysis. In hygro¬ 
scopic and hydrolytic behaviour the mesomorphous com¬ 
ponent bears a closer resemblance to the crystalline 
than to the amorphous component. 

By means of X-ray analyses, Berkley and Kerr (5) 
found little or no evidence of crystalline cellulose 
in the undried cotton fibers taken from the developing 
bolls. The pattern of native cellulose appeared at the 
time the fibers underwent their initial dehydration. 

In the living boll the hydroxyls on adjacent chains are 
separated by water molecules. The type of hydrogen

bonding associated with crystalline cellulose appar¬ 
ently does not occur until a certain portion of the 
water is lost (5)* 

Both chemists and manufacturers of cellulose 
products have, for many years, known that water, aff¬ 
ects the physical structure of cellulose. One of the 
most pronounced visible outward effects is the swell¬ 
ing power of water on either an unpurified or purified 
cellulose. 

There are two types of swelling, namely, intra- 
micellar and inter-micellar (6). In the former type 
the liquid penetrates the interior of the crystallites 
or micellae. This type of swelling occurs when cell¬ 
ulose is soaked in aqeous solutions of concentrated 
caustic soda. In the latter type of swelling the 
liquid affects the amorphous (or non-crystalline) 
region only. Prior to the time when heavy water began 
to be used as an analytical tool for the elucidation 
of reactions and structure, it was commonly believed 
that ordinary water was capable of producing only inter- 
micellar sw^elling, falling to penetrate the crystalline 
portion of cellulose. Bonhoeffer, as well as Ghampetier 
and Viallard, showed that treatment of cellulose with 
heavy water replaced, by deuterium, three hydrogen 
atoms in every glucose residue, (7)» Frilette, Eanle 
and Mark (8) also observed that heavy water penetrated 
















(

the whole mass of cellulose, including the crystall¬ 
ites, and concluded that ordinary water must do so 
likewise. It is generally agreed that any liquid 
which causes swelling must be capable of breaking the 
secondary valence bonds between "the cellulose mole¬ 
cules and of forming their bonds with the cellulose. 
Cellulose swollen with water suffers an increase in 
volume of the solid but the total volume is less than 
that of the original solid plus liquid. The change 
is believed to be due to a compression of the water 
and cellulose molecules caused by the attraction of 
the water molecules by hydroxyl groups of the cell¬ 
ulose. Organic liquids, in general, swell cellulosic 
materials less than water. Kress and Bialkowsky have 
shown that water has 22 times greater swelling effect 
than butyl alcohol (9). According to them, the water 
molecule being smaller thax^ the butyl alcohol mole¬ 
cule, can enter more readily the capillaries of smaller 
diameter. 

The great affinity of dry cellulose for water is 
attributed to the hydrogen bonding capacity of the 
hydroxyl groups because a gradually increasing mask¬ 
ing of the latter by esterification progressively 
reduces the amount of moisture absorbed from standard, 
humid surroundings (10). The sorption of water may be 
said to take place in three stages (10, 11). The first 





- 7 « 


avid adsoi'ption is due to the strong hydrogen bond- 
ing of single molecules of water to all of the alco¬ 
holic groups accessible to water in the amorphous 
portion of the cellulose. The intermediate adsorp¬ 
tion of water corresponds to the filling up of the 
finer capillaries. In the final adsorption^ cell¬ 
ulose swells and there is condensation of free or 
unbound water in the coarser capillaries* 

Purves and co-workers (11) found that a cell¬ 
ulose of known percentage accessible surface, when 
allo¥/ed to adsorb only small amounts of water {6% to 
9fa) underwent further swelling with a consequent 
increase in accessible surface, the effect being 
about 2(yfo increase for materials of high available 
surface but as much as thirty-fold for those of 
small degree of disorder. Schur and Hoos (12) found 
that occasionally cellulose, which had been shredded 
in the presence of water, subsequently redrled, and 
then nitrated, gave nitrates which had higher nitrogen 
content than similar cellulose which had been shredd¬ 
ed in the dry state and then nitrated. One might be 
led to believe that the moisture in the cellulose 
during shredding and subsequent redrying increased 
the degree of nitration. 

Scientists in the field of cellulose industry 
have realized the importance of selection and control

in the preparation of cellulosic raw materials for 
the production of a rigorously uniform product« Ball 
and co-workers (13) have pointed out that carefully 
standardized tests used in polymer manufacture give 
good duplicability between various laboratories as 
long as the test specimens come from the same source^ 
other7/ise such measurements are often found to be 
widely discordant in spite of precautions in stand¬ 
ardizing test procedures* An increase in the access¬ 
ible cellulose can be brought about by the industrial 
procedure of beating pulps (14)» Sven the simple 
action of combing the cotton fibers is said to' cause 
an increase in the amount of “ordered cellulose“ (5)* 
Nickerson stated that cellulosic material behaves like 
an elastic gel. Aqueous swelling, in the case of 
cotton fibers, coincides with a marked decrease in 
rigidity and increase in plasticity (15)• It is quite 
obvious, therefore, that the grov/ing conditions affect¬ 
ing the plant, the presence or absence of water in 
contact with the cellulosic material during its man¬ 
ufacture, and the mechanical manipulation of the raw 
material, all play an important role in the determin¬ 
ation of the physical structure and chemical react¬ 
ivity of cellulose. 

This investigation was undertaken in an attempt 
to determine more fully the role of water in affecting

the properties of cellulose* In order that swell¬ 
ing effects of water be magnified, the cellulose was 

rc-dried, 

alternately wetted, dried, re-wetted,/jfor as many as 
seventeen cycles (See Tables T-V) ji7-33 • To determine 
whether the manner of drying influenced the change of 
properties of the cellulose, samples of the same batch 
of cellulose were wetted identically but were dried 
differently, that is, the samples of one batch of cell¬ 
ulose were dried over phosphorus nentoxide under vac¬ 
uum, and those of another batch were dried over concen¬ 
trated sulphuric acid at atmospheric pressure* The 
methods of drying the samples are discussed in detail 
in the experimental section* 

One of the more powerful swelling agents of cellu¬ 
lose js concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide* It is 
believed that the two components, caustic soda and 
cellulose, combine to form a definite chemical compound 
having the composition represented by (C^H^Q 0 ^) 2 »Na 0 H 
or depending upon the concentration of 

alkali employed* This compound, termed a3.kali cellu¬ 
lose, is characterized by greater reactivity than the 
cellulose from which it is obtained, provided that it 
is not too rigoroiisly dried* This is due principally 
to swelling action of the alkali solution* Recently 
Purves and Brown (16) have shown that cellulose swoll¬ 
en by caustic soda of mercerizing strength, dried by

solvent exchange and subsequently collapsed by soak¬ 
ing with water, followed by direct redrying over 
phosphoric anhydride under vacuum, suffered a dec¬ 
rease in reactivity, as brought out by the fact that 
the nitrogen content of a technical nitrocellulose 
prepared from it had been decreased by Qol5 to 0*60^o 
Jayme (17) had previously found that cellulose dried 
under different conditions exliibited different react¬ 
ivities* Samples which had been more intensively 
dried (that is, which had been dried at higher temp¬ 
erature) suffered a decrease in the ability to reab¬ 
sorb and retain water. To account for this charact¬ 
eristic Jayme suggested that a state of '*hornification'* 
occurred within the cellulosic fibers as a result of 
the intensive drying. During the intensive drying 
process, a denser arrangement occurred in the region 
of the polysaccharide chain through the forces of 
adhesion and cohesion. 

It is obvious that the effects of swelling agents, 
of mechanical forces, and of unpredictable natural 
forces, have shown a need of analytical tools which 
would serve to elucidate fully the fine structure of 
cellulose. Unfortunately, the methods of measurement 
of molecular order and disorder in cellulose fibers 
give results which indicate that they do not always 
measure the same quality even in a uniform sample of 
cellulose. The initial, rapid hydrolysis and oxida -

( 11 ) 


tion of various cel3uloses has been quantitatively 
measured by Nickerson, and attributed only to the 
accessible nortion (15, 18)* Philipp, Nelson and 
Zufle, using a method of heterogeneous hydrolysis 
of cellulose, found that there are t\'';o distinct 
rates which are attributed to the rapid hydrolysis 
of the loose amorphous regions and to the slow hyd*- 
rolysis of the loose amorphous regions and to the 
slow hydrolysis of the dense crystalline portion of 
the fiber (19)« Goldfinger, Siggia, and Mark, using 
periodic acid as an oxidis^ing agent, found that the 
rate of oxidation of celD.ulose took place in two steps, 
and this could best be explained by assuming that the 
sample consisted of more easily and more difficulty^ 
accessible areas (20)* Of more recent development is 
the use of heavy water as an analytical tool to mea¬ 
sure accessibility (8)* This latter method, used by 
Frilette, Hanle, and Mark, gives an empirical value 
of total accessibility, whereas the value of cryst¬ 
allinity is only an approximation. The thallation 
and methylation method of Purves tests the texture 
of the sample in the bone-dry state and indicates 
only those domains as accessible that can be pene¬ 
trated by an organic solvent (14)® It has the ad¬ 
vantage that the reagents employed produce no swell¬ 
ing of the cellulose during the determination* 





( 12 ) 


The thallation tnethod of Purves (14) was used 
in our research in the estimation of the accessibil¬ 
ity of swollen samples. In this procedure thallous 
ethylate, produced as represented by. the equation 
below, is used as the thallating agent: 

2T1 + 2 EtOH -> TlOEt + H 2 

The thallous ethylate reacts with the cellulose prod¬ 
ucing thallous cellulosates 

TlOEt+• cellulose OHcellulose OTl-t EtOH 
This reaction Is restricted to those hydroxyls which 
are accessible to the thallous ethylate in ether sol¬ 
ution* Methyl iodide, used as the methylating agent, 
replaces the thallium* The methoxyl substitution of 
the partly methylated cellulose is accepted as prop¬ 
ortional to the number of hydroxyl groups that have 
come in contact with the thallous ethylate reagent* 

The reaction is represented as follows: 

cellulose OTl-t CH^I-> cellulose OCH^-t Til 

The methoxyl content of the methylated cellulose 
was determined by the method of Hoffmann and Wolfrom 
(22), which is a modification of the volumetric proced¬ 
ure of Viebock and Schwappach (23)* The methyl of the 
GH^O group is converted into methyl iodide (Zeisel*s 
method) by boiling with hydriodic acid, and the methyl 
iodide is converted into the corresponding bromide with 

formation of iodine bromides

The iodine bromide is ozidized to iodic acid by ex¬ 
cess of bromine:

The excess of bromine is converted into hydrobromic 
acid by means of formic acid and finally, after the 
addition of potassium iodide, the iodine liberated 
is titrated with sodium thiosulphates

Since in this method, six equivalents of iodine are 
liberated for each methoxyl group, the determination 
of total methoxyl content can be made with great 
accuracy even when the amounts of substan.ce are very 
small* 


Changes in the reactivity of cellulose, caused 
by pretreatment of the cellulose with swelling agents, 
reveal themselves in the properties of the derivatives 
of cellulose (I 6 , 24)* Nitrocellulose is one of the 
most important of the cellulose derivatives, finding 
its chief use as a propellant daring war. It is 
known that nitrocelluloses, m.anufactured under ident¬ 
ical conditions, perform differently when tested as 
propellants. The cause of this erratic behaviour is 
of vital concern to those responsible for its manufac¬ 
ture and subsequent use (25)* 

Cellulose may be nitrated in a number of differ- 










,'.,J ' o.; 


c 



r 








(14) 


ent ways. Nitric acid-sulphuric acid rnirtures give 
nitrates with nitrogen content up to 13 * 7 ^ ( 26 ). 
Nitrocelluloses with a nitrogen content close to the 
theoretical 14,1?^ (trinitrate), can be produced with 
a nitric acid- phosjphoric anhydride mixture ( 27 ). 
Mixtures of glacial acetic acid, acetic anhydride, 
and nitric acid have also been used as nitrating agents 
( 28 ). Wannow used a nitric acic^hosphoric acid mix-» 
ture for the preparation of nitrocellulose. 

Although cellulose can be nitrated with concen¬ 
trated nitric acid alone, nitration is, in practice, 
always effected b 3 ^ the use of a mixture of nitric acid- 
sulphuric acid. The nitrogen content of the products 
obtained depends upon the amount of water present in 
the reaction mixture. Technical nitration mixtures 
can be made up according to the table assembled by 
Dore'e (26) to yield nitrated celluloses of 6.^0 to 
13«65 per cent nitrogen. The nitrogen content of the 
mono , di , and trinitrate are 6 . 77^5 11 . 13 ?^? and 
14.17^ respectively. The highest nitrogen is obtain¬ 
ed ? 7 ith. a system represented by HNO 2 + n(H 2 S 0 ^.H 20 ), 
and the loVf?est when the nitric acid is present as the 
hydrate HN0-:j.HpC (2.6). The sulphuric acid appears, 
therefore, to act by dehydrating the nitric acid. 

The rate of nitration of cellulose increases with 
rise in temperature, but degradation of the cellulose 
molecule also increases, Berl has pointed out that 





.4 




( 15 ) 


this degradation can be reduced with a nitric acid- 
phosphoric anhydride mixture (27)« Schur and Hoos 
(12) stated that esterificatioHj oxidation, and hy¬ 
drolysis may take nlace to a greater or lesser extent, 
according to the composition of the nitrating mixture, 
the ratio of liquid to the cellulose, the temperature, 
the intensity of agitation, and the'physical condition 
of the cellulose. As nitration proceeds, water and 
heat are generated, and nitric acid is consumed. If 
the reaction proceeds too rapidly, the acid immediate¬ 
ly adjacent to the fiber, or within it, may grow so 
rich in water and so poor in nitric acid that hydrol¬ 
ysis is promoted. In addition, localized generation 
of heat may lead to oxidation and to hydrolysis of the 
cellulose. 

In the industrial field, the mechanical dipping 
process and the displacement process ( 29 ) are commonly 
i3sed in the production of cellulose nitrates from cell¬ 
ulose and nitric acid-sulphuric mixtures. In the 
former method the cellulose is immersed in the nitrat¬ 
ing mixture and kept there for thirty minutes under 
continual agitation, whereupon the acid is removed by 
centrifugal force. The nitrate, after being drowned 
in sufficient water, is washed and stabilized. In the 
displacement process, pans with perforated false bot¬ 
toms are filled with mixed acid| then cotton Is added 
and covered wjth a perforated plate so that the cotton 




( 16 ) 


is comioJetely submerged. At the end of nitration, 
the spent acid is drained off slo^^^ly and is displ¬ 
aced at the same time with water. These two methods 
can be adjusted to yield nitrocel]u.loses of identical, 
nitrogen content but with different general proper¬ 
ties, Since this difference is not accidental, it 
points to the necessity of carefully standardizing 
all conditions of nitration of the cellulose^ 

In a laboratory, imiform products are obtained 
by nitrating small batches of cellulose (approxlmatel 3 ?’ 
one gram in each batch), by carefully controlling 
weight of cellulose and acid mixture, by keeping the 
nitration time and temperature constant, and by shak¬ 
ing the flask. The crude nitrate is contaminated with 
nitrating add, sulphuric acid esters of the cellulose, 
and nitre compounds produced from the impurities in the 
fiber em^ployed* These impurities, which would render 
the produ.ct liable to spontaneous decomposition, are 
removed by washing, and then boiling the cellulose 
nitrate in a water-ethanol solution (a process known 
as stabilizat i on)« 


Determinations of the viscosity of cellulose nit¬ 
rate in butyl acetate may be used as a tool to help 
ascertain effects of a reagent, such as water, on cell¬ 
ulose. StandInger found that the viscosity of a dilute 
solution, in a neutral solvent, of a long-chain polymer 




( 1 ?) 


is a function of the number of croups, or ’bsuhmole- 
cules”, contained in the chain* The glucose anhy¬ 
dride residue, of weight l62, is the submolecule of 
cellulose* If is the viscosity of a solution of 
concentration where is the per cent concen- 

r 

tration by weight of the solution, and '^o is the vis¬ 
cosity of the pure liquid solvent, then the quantity, 


^sp, which is equal to 7 / 7 .-' is used to represent the 
specific viscosity of the solution. The valiie of 
>jsp/C^, which does not vary greatly with concentra¬ 
tion, at low concentrations is approximately a lin¬ 
ear function of the latter variable, and extrapola¬ 
tion to zero concentration gives the intrinsic vis¬ 
cosity of the solution » Tn the work carried out 
>jsp/C,^ was determined after each successive dilution 


of a given solution (vSee Experimental Section) and 


the value of ^ sp/C^ was taken to be equal to [>j] when 
it no longer changed in value upon fixrther dilution 


of the given solution. As the viscosimeter, the vol¬ 
ume of solution, the solvent, and temperature, were 
the same in all determinations, then the relative vis¬ 
cosities in dilute solutions were taken as proportion¬ 
al to the time of flow* 

The Intrinsic Viscosities, obtained as directed 


in the preceding paragraph, were taken to be propor¬ 
tional to the degree of polymerization (30)* They are, 
however, easily converted to numerical values repre -

Cellulose molecule result in a decrease in viscosity* 

The cooking processes used for isolating cellulose are 
more effective tha-n nitration in reducing the chain 
length of the cellulose* Aging, relatively high temp¬ 
eratures, and light (29) cause a lowering of viscosity 
of solutions of cellulose nitrates. Kraemer found that 
pure acetone solutions of cellulose nitrate shov/ the 
greatest decrease in viscosity after eight days (29,31). 
High temperatures of drying (105^) lead to thermal deg¬ 
radation and lowering of viscosity of solutions of cell¬ 
ulose nitrate ( 33 )* Nitrocellulose viscosity may be 
influenced by the viscosity of the original cellulose 
and the conditions of nitration. An increase in nit¬ 
ration time and temperature lead to a lowering of vis¬ 
cosity of the resulting nitrate solutions (34). Wannow 
found that viscosity of nitrocellulose increased with 
increase in degree of substitution, provided that the 
degree of polymerization remained constant ( 35 )® 

Without doubt, a knowledge of the position and 
extent of substitution in a nitrocellulose would help 
to reveal changes in reactivity of cellulose caused by 
swelling agents. On examination of Figure 1 (page 2), 
it can be seen that there are two kinds of hydroxyls, 
namely nrimary and secondary* The former is located 
on carbon six, and the latter exists as a trans glycol 
group■on carbons two and three® The primary hydroxyl, 











c 


(r 









( 20 ) 


on partially acylated celluloses, has been determined 
with varying degrees of success by use of the tos3ria-. 
tion and iodination method (26, 37, 38, 39)* An at¬ 
tempt has been made to determine which hydroxyls are 
unesterified in nitrated celluloses (40)* An analyt¬ 
ical tool which would disclose whether the substitu¬ 
tion of hydroxyls by nitro groups had been ordered 
or random would help reveal the mechanism of the nit¬ 
ration reaction* Since the primary hydroxyls are more 
sterically exposed, it might be assumed that they would 
be nitrated first. Thus by making a mononitrate of 
cellulose, one might again assume that the trails gly¬ 
col group on carbon two and three would still be avail¬ 
able for oxidation. Lead tetraacetate, which prefer¬ 
entially cleaves unesterified glycol groups, is used 
to determine what fraction of the total hydroxyls ex¬ 
ists as glycol groups^ 

Hockett, Cramer, and Purves oxidized commercial 
acetone-soluble cellulose acetates with lead tetra¬ 
acetate and found that the distribution of hydroxyls 
on a partially acylated cellulose was largely a matter 
of chance (41)® Purves and Brown (42) oxidized ccm- 
mercial cellulose nitrates to small but variable ex¬ 
tents, They found that wetting and redrying of high¬ 
ly swollen linters prior to technical nitration inc¬ 
reased the level of oxidation. As a result of this 
evidence, oxidation of cellulose nitrates of varying

nitrogen content was undertaken in an attempt t© 
gain some information concerning the manner of sub¬ 
stitution in the glucose anhydride unit of cellulc.se. 


An investigation of the mechanism of glycol 
cleavage by lead tetraacetate has been presented by 
Heidt, Gladding and Purves (43)* The hydroxyl groups 
of the glycol in the cellulose must be in a free unes- 
terified condition*

acetate would be required to split one glycol group in

of oxidant against time^ one could determine when the 
oxidation of the nitrocellulose is complete by noting 
the point at which the curve will have zero slope* The 
height of the ordinatej at zero slope of the curve, 
would therefore represent the total consumption of the 
oxidant by the cellulose nitrate* From this data it

should be relatively simple to determine whether 
the nitration occurred in an ordered or random way* 
Moreover, decided breaks in the oxidation rate curve 
might indicate different domains of the cellulose nit¬ 
rate which are more or less accessible to oxidation.

EXPERIMENTAL 

A* PREPARATION OF CELLULOSE SMPLES 

A quantity of high grade cotton linters, the 
gift of H, M» Spurlin and the Hercules Powder Go*, 
was dewaxed by extraction in a Sohxlet apparatus 
for two days with a mixture of ethanol and benzene 
(1:2)* The purified product was dried in air and sub« 
sequently stored in a closed container* 

1. Swelling of Cellulose Samples with 10^ 

Aqueous Sodium Hydroxide 

The samples of cellulose were swollen using the 
modification of the swelling technique discoirered by 
Glegg^s modification (44) of the procedure developed 
by Assaf, Haas and Purves (21)* Fifteen g* of dew** 
axed, air-dried cellulose were immersed in 540 ml* of 
IC^ sodium hydroxide solution at 5^f and two and a 
half hours later the swollen mass, together with the 
caustic, were poured into an amount of 10^ aqueous 
acetic acid (also previously cooled to 5^) calculated 
to neutralize the caustic soda used in the swelling 
process* After a period of 10 minutes, during which 
the mixture was stirred at intervals to permit comp¬ 
lete diffusion of the acid through the cellulose, the 
aqueous portion was decanted and the solid pressed 
free from excess liquid. A second treatment with 1

liters of 1$ acetic acid for 10 oiinutes rendered the 
solution slightly acidic and reoioved the last traces 
of sodium hydroxide* This solution was decanted as 
before, and replaced by 1~J liters of distilled water, 
which was thoroughly mixed with the cotton for three 
or four minutes and then drained away* About six 
separate washings with liter volumes of distilled 
water were necessary to free the cellulose from salts 
and acid (litmus test)* The excess water was squeezed 
from the linters by gentle pressure and the wet mass 
quickly dispersed, and occasionally stirred, in one 
liter of 99^ methanol. Fifteen minutes later, the 
methanol was removed and replaced by a fresh amount, 
and this process was continued for three additional 
washings* Two more immersions for 30 minutes each, 
in magnesium dried methanol (45), were followed by 
four more, one of 30 and three of 15 minutes each, in 
one«liter volumes of sodium«dried, thiophenefree ben¬ 
zene, to remove the last traces of methanol* The sup¬ 
ernatant liquids were easily reclaimed and purified* 
During all the manipulations, care was taken to avoid 
even superficial drying of the cellulose, since sucn 
drying tended to give a non-uniform product^ 

The swollen linters, wet with benzene, were dried 
in a desiccator over containers of phosphoric anhydride 
and paraffin for several days, during which frequent 
changes of the drying reagent, and repeated evacuation

of the desiccator to a pressure of about 2? mm. mer¬ 
cury were necessary in order to produce a material 
free from the odour of benzene. The product was then 
stored in the usual manner (21) in a desiccator for 
one week over concentrated sulphuric acid. 

2• Cellulose Sample Swollen with Distilled Water 
and Dried by Solvent Exchange 

A sample of cellulose, soaked in distilled water 
for four hours, was then taken out, and squeezed gent¬ 
ly to remove excess water. The sample was dried by 
solvent exchange as stated previously in 1. 

3• Collapse of the Dried Swollen Linters to 

an Accessibility of 0.2-0.4$6 

Half of the dried linters was soaked in water 
for twenty minutes, squeezed gently to remove excess 
liquid, and then dried directly under vaccum over 
phosphoric anhydride. When thoroughly dry, the lint¬ 
ers were stored, along with the dried svjollen portion, 
over concentrated sulphuric acid in the same desiccator. 

4. Swelling of Cotton Linters with Distilled 

Water by a Cyclical Process 


(a) Drying over Phosphoric Anhydride Under Vacuum 
















( 26 ) 


A quantity of air-dried cellulose was immersed 
in disti^ed water for a period of twelve hours, the 
water then decanted and the, swollen mass gently pres¬ 
sed by hand to remove excess water. The cellulose 
was then reduced to dryness over phosphoric anhyd¬ 
ride under vacuum. A two-gram sample of the dried 
product was retained and the remainder again treat¬ 
ed with a large excess of water for three hours and 
then dried as before. This procedure of three-hour 
immersion follov/ed by intensive drying v/as repeated 
in order to obtain a series of dried samples of cot¬ 
ton linters differing only in the number of times 
they had been soaked with water and dried. (This 
series is indicated in Table I.)

B* DETERMINATION OF ACCESSIBILITY OF SWOLLEN COTTON 

LINTERS 


lo Thaliation and Methylation of Dry Cotton Linters 

The dry 5 swollen cotton linters were thallated 
and methylated using the procedure developed hy Purves 
( 21 ). - 

The cotton samples^ 0*1 to 0*3 g*? were transferr¬ 
ed from a desiccator into the tared cups and quickly 
weighed on a balance prior to insertion into the appar¬ 
atus (Figure ). The stopper was replaced prom¬ 

ptly to prevent access of moisture and the apparatus 
was at once evacuated with an oil pump attached to (3)« 
Low results are obtained if this evacuation is neglected* 
Stopcock (3) was then closed and (1) was opened to ner- 
mlt 0*1 N thallous ethylate solution to be sucked into 
the apparatus from the separatory fumnel. About 20 
ml* of solution was sufficient to fill all three cups 
and imm.erse them completely* After standing in the

dark at room temperature for one hour, the partly 
exhausted solution was removed by suction through 
stopcock (3), with a rainimiim use of a water rump, 

> 'f and the thallation was repeated with fresh solution 
drawn in through (1)* Samples thallated in ether 
solution were coloured yellow, and, the depth of 
colour was a rough measure of the extent of thall¬ 
ation* The thallous ethylate solution was with¬ 
drawn at the end of the second hou.r in the dark 
and residual amounts were washed from the samples 
by filling the apparatus with pure, dry benzene* 
Fotir or five benzene extractions (carried out in the 
dark), the first of fifteen and the others each of 
five minutes duration, were sufficient* The wet 
samples were then prepared for methylation by fill¬ 
ing the apparatus with benzene containing a large 
excess, 2 ml*,'of methyl Iodide* The ground-glass 
stopper wavS replaced with a glass-iDlnted reflux 
condenser whose upper end was equipped with a cal¬ 
cium chloride tube, stopcocks (1) and (3) were 
closed and the entire apparatus was immersed up to 
the level of the upper sample cup in a water-bath 
kept at 80^9 No exclusion of light was necessary 
during the methylation, which was complete within 
three and one-half hours. Since thallous iodide 
was a by-product of the reaction, the methylation 
was attended by a color change in the samples from

yellow to orange^ the intensity of which was a rough 
measure of the amorphous cellulose. The condenser 
was then exchanged for the glass stopper and the ex¬ 
cess methyl iodide-benzene mixture in the cellulose 
was removed by suction. The first tv/o benzene ex¬ 
tractions, each of fifteen minutes* duration, were 
followed by six more, each lasting for five to ten 
minutes. Thoroughness was essential in this extr¬ 
action lest traces of residual methyl iodide inval¬ 
idate the final methoxyl estimation. The apparatus 
was then connected to a water pump, in order to re¬ 
move the benzene, care being exercised in the beg¬ 
inning, to keep stopcock (3) open only momentarily 
in order to avoid scattering of the samples by a too 
sudden evaporation of the residual benzene« After a 
final drying in high vacuum at 80^ for two hours, the 
the whole of each sample, with its occluded thallous 
iodide, was analyzed for its methoxyl content. The 
methoxyl content was expressed as a percentage of 
the original, unsubstituted cellulose, and multiplied 
by the factor 100/57«^ gave the percentage of the 
cellulose hydroxyl groups that had been methylated. 
This value was assumed to be eqtial to the percentage 
of the cellulose wetted by the solvent for the thall¬ 
ous ethylate^

Preparation of Thallous Ethylate SolTjtlons (21) 

Thin slices of clean, silvery thallium metal, 

2 g*, contained in a 125 ml* glass stoppered, thick 
walled Prlenmeyer flask, were covered with 50 ml* of 
absolute ethanol, and a stream of dry oxygen gas was 
played over the surface of the liquid for one to two 
minutes* The flask was then stoppered, shielded 
from light, and shaken mechanically. Solution of the 
metal was complete within two hot-^rs if the oxygen at 
the atmosphere was renewed at 15 minute intervals* 

A small piece of porous porcelain was added to 
the solution to promote uniform boiling during the 
removal of ethanol under vacuum (water pump)* The 
latter part of the distillation, under vacuum, was 
from a water bath kept at 30 ° (thallous ethylate 
decomposes readily at higher temperature)* An ex¬ 
cessive use of the pump was avoided lest moisture 
reach the ethylate when the vapor pressure of the 
residual alcohol became low* (Protection against 
moisture was provided by connecting a calcium ch¬ 
loride tube between the Erlenmeyer flask and the 
water pump)* When the flask was shielded from light 
and the technique of distillation was satisfactory, 
the residual thallous ethylate formed about 1 ml* of 
a heavy pale yellow oil. The oil was kept at room 
temperature for ten minutes under high vacuum to 





( 40 ) 


remove any traces of ethanol and dissolved in 50 ml, 
of the purej anhydrous ether, Glass-stonpered ?»rad«- 
uates of 100 ml, capacity were convenient receptac¬ 
les for these solutions. 

The normality of the thallous ethylate was det¬ 
ermined by pipetting 5 ml, in a mixture of 20 ml, of 
methanol and 10 ml, of 0,1 N hydrochloric acid, the 
excess of which was then titrated ?;ith standard, caus¬ 
tic soda. Dilution of the thallous ethylate solution 
to 0,1 N was made with the appropriate volume of the 
pure solvent. These solutions did not change their 
normality during several weeks if kept near 0^ in 
the dark, but exposure to light caused rather rap¬ 
id formation of a spongy, brown decomposition, 
Thallous ethylate oil was also fairly stabD.e when 
properly stored, 

® A Determination of 4ccess?.bility by Methoxvl 

Estimation 

The method of Hoffmann and Wolfrom (22), which 
is a modification of the volumetric procedure of 
Viebock and Schwappach ( 23)5 was used for the det¬ 
ermination of the methoxyl content of the methylated 
cellulose,

assembled (Fig. 4,p. 4z ),(all ground-glass Joints 
were lubricated with high-vacuum grease^ and flushed 
with a slow stream of carbon dioxide for ten minutes. 
The gas stream was continued while 8 ml, of constant 
boiling hydriodic acid (sufficient for two success¬ 
ive determinations) and a one inch piece of nichrome 
wire (to prevent bumping) were placed in the reaction 
flask and the scrubber was charged by the upper stop¬ 
cock (1)» The hydriodic acid was then heated, by 
means of a small flame, to reflux temperature and 
carbon dioxide passed through the apparatus for an 
additional twenty minutes to remove last traces of 
interfering impurities* after which the flames were 
extinguished, and the reaction flask iminedlately 
loosened from the condenser (to prevent sticking of 
the ground-glass Joints)* 

When the hydriodic acid in the reaction flask 
had reached room temperature, the flow of carbon 
dioxide was stopped. The receiver was then rinsed 
with glacial acetic acid and charged with 10 ml* of 
the receiver solution ( )* After the rec¬ 

eiver assembly was set in place, the cellulose sample 
was quickly placed in the reaction flask, and the 
latter was then connected to the condenser* The 
hydriodic acid was then heated to boiling and ref¬ 
luxed gently while Just enough carbon dioxide was 
turned on to prevent the hydriodic acid from back-

ing up into the carbon dioxide inlet tube. The 
carbon dioxide was adjusted to a rate of 20 to 25 
ml. per minute. In initiating the gas flow, care 
was taken to turn on the carbon, dioxide very slove¬ 
ly in order to prevent bumping due to superheating 
of the hydriodic acid. 

As the carbon dioxide passed through the appar¬ 
atus, the receiver orifice emitted a steady stream 
of small bubbles, whose time of contact with the 
receiver solution depended upon the angle at which 
the receiver was inclined. The entire apparatus was 
adjusted until the optimum rate of gas flow (20 to 25 
ml. per minute) allowed the bubbles to remain in con¬ 
tact with the receiver solution from 5 to 7 seconds* 

After at least .30 miniates* sweeping, the rec¬ 
eiver was disconnected, the reaction flask was cooled 
and immediately loosened, the stream of carbon dioxide 
was stopped, the alternate receiver was filled and 
assembled, the new sample of methylated, cellulose 
was quickly inserted in the reaction flask, and the 
procedure described above was repeated* 

?/hile the second analysis was in progress, the 
receiver solution from the first was washed into a 
250 ml. Sr3.enmeyer flask containing 25 ml. of water 
and 5 ml. of 25% sodium acetate. Ten drops of 90% 
formic acid were then added, and the flask swirled, 
until the bromine color was discharged. The flask

was then stoppered and shaken by hand In an oscilJ-. 
atory motion, imtil further shaking failed to devel¬ 
op back pressure inside the flask. An amount of ^ 
ml» of 10/? sulphuric acid was then added, fol3.ovi/ed 
by about g, (an excess) of potassium iodide* 

The liberated fodine was titrated with 0,0?. N sod- 
lT3in thlo-sulphate, using starch as an indicator* 

The titration was made with a 10 ml* precision buret* 

The volume of sodium thiosiilphate required for a 
blank determination was subtracted from the volume 
required for the titration of a known sample*

C. Nitrations of Cotton Linters 

1. Nitrations with Sulnhigrlc Acid Nitric Acid 

Mixtures 

The nitration procedure was identical to that 
employed, by Brown and Purves (46)^ Technical nit« 
ration mixtures were made up according to the tables 
assembled by Doree (26), to yield a nitrated cellul¬ 
ose of about 11,50 per cent nitrogen. Each hatch of 
nitration mixture was checked by sample nitratlon^bf 
of dewaxedj unswollen cellulose 5 as well as by anal¬ 
ysis of the mixture 5 and suitable corrections in comp¬ 
osition were made 5 if necessary 5 to give the desired 
nitrogen content in the nitrocellulose. The actual 
nitrations were carried out lond.er carefully controlled 
conditions to ensure duplication of results. One 
hundred g. of the techjiical nitration solution wus 
put into a dried 5 glass-stoppered Erlenm^eyer flask of 
about 200 ml. capacity, and then, after the-flask 

















( 46 ) 


and contents had been brought to one gram of 

the dried ce?J.ulose was quickly weighed (to the 
second decimal place )5 roughly shredded with for¬ 
ceps, and immersed in the nitrating fluid. Nitra¬ 
tion continued at 15 ^ for thirty minutes, the flask 
being shaken occasionally to ensure thorough mixings 
A thirty minute reaction time was chosen to conform 
to that often used in commercial manufacture, and 
the temperature of 15 *^ was such as to reduce deg¬ 
radation and side reactions ( 26 ), yet still allow 
maximum nitration to take place during the half 
hour. The liquor was removed by filtration with 
suction throu.gh a coarse, sintered-glass funnel of 
suiitahle size, the residuial t^'jtrocellulose squeezed 
slightly to remove excess fluid, and then thrown, 
piece hy piece, with quick stirring, into 2^0 ml® 
of a 1?1 mixture (by v^eight) of ethanol and ?ijater (27) 
previously cooled to -15^« The liquid was again 
filtered from the solid by suction, through a sin- 
tered-glass funnel, into the same suction flask 
(which had been emptied and washed with water to 
prevent explosion restilting from the addition of 
ethanol to nitrating solutions) and the solid squee¬ 
zed from excess liquids Two more such washings with 
100 ml, volumes of cold, aqueous ethanol were fol¬ 
lowed by four similar immersions in the same ethan¬ 
ol-water mixture at room temperature to ensure com¬ 
plete removal of the free acids (litmus test)®

The washed cellulose nitrai-e was subseauently hoiled 
three times in succession, for periods of five min¬ 
utes each, in 100 ml* volumes of Isl ethanol-water 
solution, previously heated to boiling, ?n <^rder to 
stabilize the product* Such treatment is reported 
to remove any bound sulphuric acid and to yield a 
thoroughly stable nitrocellulose (27, 14, 4?)* The 
hot liquid was removed as before, and the ester then 
dried over phosphoric anhydride and calcium chloride 
under vacuum., the drying agent being changed as often 
as necessary until no •f'urther liqulfaction of the an¬ 
hydride occurred. It was then deemed suitably dry 
for subseauent analyses, and was stored in a desic¬ 
cator over phospherics nentoxide^ 

The technical nitrocelluloses thus obtained 
were colorless and fibrous, but the texture had a 
more brittle character than was shown by the origin¬ 
al cellulose, suggesting the occurrence of degrada¬ 
tion during nitration, 

2, Nitrations With Phosrhorlc Anhydride-Nitric

Nitration without degradation was accomplished 
by the use of phosphoric anhydride and 100 per cent 
nitric acid (27, 48) prepared by distillation of a 
mixture of concentrated sulphuric and concentrated

nitric acids (Isl) in an all-gi.ass apparatus. A 
22 ,^ raixtnre (by weight) of phosphoric anhydride in 
this nitric acid was made by cooling the acid in a 
glass-stoppered bottle to - 15 ^and adding the anhy¬ 
dride in small portions with shaking and further 
cooling till the required amount of pentoxide had 
been consumed. The preparation covered a period of 
four to six hours 5 when five hundred, ml. of nitric 
acid was involved^ depending upon the efficiency of 
the cooling mechanism. Attempts to hasten the add¬ 
ition brought about evol.ution of brovm fumes^ esp¬ 
ecially at higher temperatures. The nitration mix¬ 
ture j, at first opaque and obviously containing solid 
anhydridej remained at 0 ^ for one week^ whereupon it 
became a clear 5 homogeneous liquid. This change in 
physical state is most important 5 for unless it has 
occurred 5 a nitration to only about 13!^ N is possible 
( 44)0 No difficulty in obtaining 13*8 “ nit¬ 

rogen content was encountered if solution of the 
phosphorus pentoxide was complete. 

The nitrating liquid, 100 g., was put into a 
dried, glass-stoppered Erlenmeyer flask, and the 
flask and contents brought to IJ^, whereupon 1 g« 
(weighed to the second decimal place) of dried, ,, „ 

prepared cellulose was added. The reaction was al¬ 
lowed to continue at 1?^ for thirty minutes. Berl 
suggests that reaction is completed in the first

five minutes hy this powerful mixture ( 27 ), but the 
longer time was allowed so as to be comparable to 
that used in the technical nitration for the indiis- 
trial manufacture of guncotton* Removal of the acids, 
drovi/ning, washing, stabilization, drying and storing 
of the cellulose nitrate proceeded in exactly the 
same fashion as in the preparation of the technical 
nitrates, \ colorless, fibrous material of uniform 
texture, showing no traces of degradation or tendency 
towards brittleness, was obtained* 


D. ANALYSES FOR NITROGEN (BY SBMI«-MTGRO KJELDAHI.) 

Nitrogen analyses were made by a modification 
of the Gunning method for the determination of nit¬ 
rogen ( 49 )^ The sample of dried cellulose nitrate, 
0»1 g*, was weighed rapidly on a balance, using a 
cigarette paper as a convenient means of weighing 
and transferring the guncotton sampleso The nitro¬ 
cellulose slowly absorbs water from the atmosphere, 
the resulting increase in weight being much greater 
and much more rapid for the technical nitrates than 
for the trinitrate* The sample was then trans-^^erred 
to a 250 ml* Kjeldahl flask and 0*3 go salicylic 
acid and. six ml* concentrated sulphuric acid were 
added. As some nitrocellulose may adhere to the 
cigarette paper it was found best to weigh the cig¬ 
arette paper after the nitrocellulose had been trans—

ferred from the paper into the Kjeldahl flask* 

After one to two honrs of digestion at room 
temperature 5 the solids were found to he completely 
dissolved* Sodium thiosulphate, 0®8 g., was then 
added and the mixture warmed gently over a low flame 
for about five minutes, whereijpon 2«0 g* of powdered 
potassium sulphate and a tiny pinch of selenium cata» 
lyst was inserted* The mixture was then gently heat¬ 
ed under a hood, until the evolution of gases became 
less pronounced, and then was heated more strongly 
till the llauid was clear and colorless* The cooled, 
viscous liquid was diluted with 100 ml* of distilled 
water and then made definitely basic by the addition 
of 50 ml* of 40% sodiujm hydroxide solution* A small 
piece of zinc in the flask prevented bumping while 
the ammonia, with about 75 ml* of water, was dist¬ 
illed into 30 ml* of 4% aqueous boric acid solution 
containing ten drops of a mixed indicator (5^)» 
ammonia in the boric acid solution was titrated 
directly with 0*05 N* hydrochloric acid (with a mixed 
indicator) and the per cent nitrogen calculated by

solution of boric acid 5 containing the ammonia 5 was 
titrated to the disappearance of the greenish color 
and the first faint appearance of red. The blank 
was determined in exactly the same way and was 
applied as a correction for all determinations® 

Good checks in the duplicate or triplicate anal 3 rs 9 s 
were usually obtained in all cases, 

DETBRMIMTTON OF INTHINSTC VISCOSITIES 

The viscosities were measured with an Ostwa]d 
capillar^/- viscosimeter. About OoO? g® of the dr^^ 
cellulose nitrate was weighed out carefully and quickly 
to the fifth place. The nitrate was then added to a 
weighed amount (100 ml«) of freshly distilled butyl 
acetate (b,p® 12 R- 127 ^ 0 t 76 O mm®) in a glass-^stoppered 
container® Mechanical shaking was continued, till a 
homogeneous solution was obtained* The time for 
solution varied 5 but as a rule shaking was continued

for aboTit thirty hours. A fevj tiny. Insoluble, 
threadlike bodies v^ere observed in all solutions 
even after prolonged shaking. These bodies were 
allowed to settle before measurements were made, 
and were found to have no effect on the time of flow. 
Approximately, a twenty ml. aliquot portion, (weighed 
to the fourth place), of the butyl acetate solution, 
was transferred to a glass tube, closed at one end, 
and with a ground glass joint at the other end, with 
dimensions approximately 1** by 8”, and capacity 
about 30 to 40 ml* was found to be suitable. A ? 
ml. aliquot of the solution in the glass tube was 
pipetted into a clean, dry, ostwald viscosimeter, 
which was then suspended in a water bath at 
After an interval of five mintites, during which time 
the apparatus reached the temperature of the hath, 
the small bulb in the instrument was filled with sol¬ 
ution by gently exerting pressure on the surface of 
the liquid 5n the other arm of the viscosim.eter by 
means of a rubber bulb® This technique minimized 
evaporation, which inevitably accompanies suction® 
Times of flow, 70 to 110 secs®, were measured with 
a stop-?^?atch reading to one tenth of a second. An 
average of at least five readings was taken as the 
time of flow. Relative viscosities were te?<^en in 
these dilute solutions as proportional to the time 
of flow. The quotient of the specific viscosity.

a few moments* shaking to allow thorough mixing, 
weighed again. From these weights, the amount of the 
solvent and the amount of residual nitrocellulose

OXIDATIONS WITH LEAD TETBAACETATE 


Pure, dry ethyl acetate was prepared according 
to the directions given by Fieser (54) in which com¬ 
mercial ethyl acetate was washed three times with an 
equal volume of % aqueous sodium carbonate ( to 
remove acetic acid). The ethyl acetate was then 
washed three times with the same quantity of satur¬ 
ated calcium chloride solution to remove the ethanol 
which might be present as an impurity. The washed 
ethyl acetate was dried overnight with anhydrous 
potassium carbonate, then for three hours with phosph¬ 
oric anhydride, from which it was then decamted and 
fractionally distilled twice under anhydrous conditions. 

Two liters of acetic acid were freed from aldehyde 
by heating for two hours under reflux with 10 g. of 
chromic anhydride, after which time additional chromic 
anhydride, in small quantities, was inserted and the 
acetic acid refluxed until oxidation of all aldehydes 
had taken place. (No further change of colour of 
chromic anhydride after refluxing). The addition of 
too large a quantity of chromic anhydride was avoided 
as it might react violently with the impure acetic 
acid. The acid was then purified by fractionation in

an all-glass apparatus (41, 55), acetic anhydride 
was purified by careful fractionation of the stock 
material* 

A good grade of lead tetraacetate was made by 
the procedure of Hockett and McClenahan (56, cf* also 
57, 58)* A mixture of 530 ml* of purified glacial 
acetic acid and 115 ml* of acetic anhydride was heated 
to 75 in a 1-liter, 3-necked, round-bottom flask, 
fitted with a thermometer and a mechanical stirrer* 

Dry red lead, 150 g*, was added in 15 g. portions, 
each successive addition being made only when the 
color of the oxide previously added had vanished. At 
the end of the reaction, wherein the temperature had 
been maintained below 90 ® , the faintly red solution, 
now practically free of unreacted lead oxide, was 
allowed to cool in the stoppered flask, whereupon the 
remaining traces of color disappeared, and the lead 
tetraacetate crystallized out in long, colorless needles* 
The acetate was then separated from the liquid by 
filtration with gentle suction, and washed four times 
with small portions of cold purified glacial acetic 
acid. A 0*1 N acetic acid solution of the lead tetra¬ 
acetate solution was immediately prepared. The dry 
lead tetraacetate darkens rapidly if exposed to water 
vapor in the air* Any color, caused by contact of the 
salt with water vapor in the air, might be removed by 
solution of the solid in hot glacial acetic acid.

decolorization with norite if necessary, and then 
recrystallization. 

The strength of the acetic acid solution of the 
lead tetraacetate was determined by pipetting 20 ml. 
of the liquid into 30 ml. of a sodium acetate boiffer 
(consisting of 20 g. potassium iodide plus 2^0 g. 
sodium acetate per liter of aqueous solution) and 
titrating the liberated iodine to a starch end point 
with 0.02 N sodium thiosulphate (59, 41). 

About 0.5 gm* of the prepared nitrocellulose, 
previously dried for twenty four hours under vacuum 
over phosphoric anhydride, was placed on a cigarette 
paper and the two were weighed (to five decimal places). 
The sample of guncotton was then transferred into a 
200 ml. glass-stoppered volumetric flask. The paper 
was now weighed and the weight of the nitrate determined. 
The solid was covered with 125 ml. of purified, anhydrous 
ethyl acetate, and slowly dissolved by agitation on a 
mechanical shaker, whereupon 50 ml. of 0.1 N glacial 
acetic acid solution of lead tetraacetate was added, 
followed by enough anhydrous ethyl acetate to bring 
the total volume to the 200 ml. mark. The flask was 
shaken to ensure a homogeneous solution. Two blank 
determinations were carried out simultaneously. Oxida¬ 
tion was carried out at 25^^ (10.1©). Consumption of 
the lead tetraacetate by the cellulose nitrate was 







( 58 ) 


determined by the potassium iodide-sodium thiosulphate 
method of Dimroth and Schweitzer (59). At suitable 
intervals the volumetric flasks were removed from the 
bath, shaken briskly and then put back in the bath. 

After allowing any suspended undissolved nitrocellulose 
to settle (a few minutes), 10 ml. aliquots were pipetted 
into 30 ml. of potassium iodide-sodium acetate solution 
(41) contained in a 250 ml. Erlenmeyer flask. Eleven 
ml. of pure ethyl acetate was placed in a 20 ml. 
Erlenmeyer flask and the drained pipette was filled, 
by suction, with ethyl acetate. This solution was also 
pipetted into the 250 ml. Erlenmeyer flask. By this 
method of flushing the pipette most of the adhering 
oxidation solution is removed and more reproducible 
results are thus obtained. This is particularly 
important since the viscosity of the solutions of 
cellulose nitrate in ethyl acetate varies with the 
nitrogen content of the guncottoEo. 75 ml* of water 
was added and the solution was then titrated with 0.02 
N sodium thiosulphate -until the colour of the solution 
had changed to a light yellow, whereupon 3 ml. of starch 
solution was added, and titration then completed. The 
titration was slow, and required considerable agitation 
of the flask to allow all the iodine in the ethyl acetate 
layer to come into intimate contact with the thiosulph¬ 
ate in the water layer. Near the end point, after the 
addition of each drop, the flask had to be shaken for

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Dewaxed cotton linters (Sample V) when alternately 
wetted with water and dried sharply over phosphoric 
anhydride under vacuiam prior to storing over concen¬ 
trated sulphuric acid showed a progressive increase 
in accessibility to thallous ethylate in ether (21) 
proportional to the number of wetting-drying cycles 
(Table IX page 70 , Fig. 5 page 62 )• Seven such 
cycles raised the accessibility by approximately 
2/3 (0.30^ to 0.49^)* This increased accessibility 
is also reflected in a corresponding improvement in 
the degree of nitration. A standard sulphuric acid- 
nitric acid-water nitrating mixture (46) gave ll.£>4^ 

N with untreated dewaxed linters as against 11*49^ N 
with the linters having received seven wetting-drying 
treatments (Sample V, Table IX page 70 and Fig. 6 
page 6f)♦ 

A second portion of dewaxed cotton linters 
(Sample W) was given similar cyclic wetting and drying 
treatments but with removal of water achieved by air 
drying rather than by phosphorus pentoxide before 
storage over concentrated sulphuric acid. Here again 
twelve cycles is associated with an increase from 
1104^ to 11.55 % nitrogen (Table X page ).

discover whether there is a limit to the increase of 
accessibility of cotton linters due to wetting-drying 
cycles, two more samples of cotton linters were prepared* 
Sample X (Table XI, page 7S^ was given fifteen cycles 
with sharp drying over phosphorus pentoxide whereas 
Samp3.e Y (Table XII, page ?6) received seventeen such 
treatments with air-drying at each cycle* Both X and 
Y were stored over concentrated sulphuric acid before 
analysis* Table XI, page 7^, reveals that sample X 
suffered an increase of accessibility of from 0 * 32 J? 
to 0*48^ (Fig* pag© ^3) with a parallel improve¬ 
ment in ease of nitration (11*085? to 11*50^ Nitrogen)* 
Sample Y,(Table XII, page 76 ) also corroborated the 
previous observations by an increased accessibility 
(10*96^ to 11*31^ Nitrogen)* 

In all cases sharper drying is accompanied by 
slightly greater increases in degree of nitration* 
Moreover, a limit to the effects of wetting drying 
on the extent of nitration is indicated for Sample X 
(Table XI, page 75') and for Sample Y (Table XII, page 76) 
more clearly shown graphically in Fig. 6,page 6yand 
Fig* 7, page 7/ * This limit is not as clearly indicated 
in the accessibility measurements, due to the fact that 
such small values for accessibilities entail inaccuracies 
of 10 to 15% (21)* 


Concurrently, another portion of dewaxed cotton

j

(73) 


linters (Sample Z) was given seven alternate wetting 
and air drying treatments similar to those of Sample 
Y and then was stored in a desiccator with no drying 
agent• When each portion of Sample Z was subsequently 
nitrated by a standard technical mixture, an overall 
increase of 0*17^ N was observed (Table XIII, page 7^, 
Fig. 7> page 7/ )• In this case also a progressive 
increase in degree of nitration parallels the increase 
in the number of wetting and air drying cycles. 
Apparently storage of all samples, prior to nitration, 
over a desiccant (concentrated sulphuric acid) produces 
a more pronounced difference in nitration (cf. Sample Z 
and Sample Y)# However one should not consider that 
this enhanced effect, due to intense drying, is necess¬ 
arily of general application since there is a consider¬ 
able variation in increase of accessibility due to 
definite niamber of wetting drying cycles even with the 
linters from the same source (See Table XIV, page 9<?)* 

It is also interesting to note that the nitrocelluloses 
obtained from the all air-dried cellulose (Sample Z, 

Table XIII) were more uniform than those of the more 
rigorously dried linters (Samply Y, Table XII) since the 
Kjeldahl nitrogen triplicate analyses of the former 
diverged from their mean by not more thant 0*04^, whereas 
those of the latter diverged from their mean by t. 0.1^»

nitrocelluloses varying in degree of substitution 
from mono to trinitrate (Sample T, Table XIV, page ^< 9 , 

Fig* 8, page all showed the same, typical increase 
in extent of nitration for a quantity of cotton linters 
wetted and air-dried seventeen times over the same 
linters wetted and air-dried only once* The powerful 
mixture of 100^ nitric acid and phosphorus pentoxide 
showed a 0 * 225 ? N increase whereas technical mixtures 
exhibited greater differences* A correlation might 
be possible between strength of reagent and magnitude 
of difference in degree of nitration* The nitric acid- 
phosphoric anhydride mixture was expected to yield 
nitrates of the same nitrogen content for all linter 
samples since it is known to nitrate celluloses, having 
different accessibilities, to almost the same degree (60)* 
The data of Tables IX to XIV all serve to corrobor¬ 
ate the fact that an improvement in the degree of nitra¬ 
tion of cotton linters was brought about by alternately 
wetting) and drying them prior to nitration. Further¬ 
more, the increase in accessibility was proportional 
to the number of wetting-drying cycles. Beneficial 
effects of water in improving accessibility and ease 
of nitration have been observed by other workers* 

Purves and co-workers (10) found that a cellulose of 
known percentage accessible surface, when allowed to 
adsorb only small amounts of water (6% to 9^) under¬ 
went further swelling with consequent increase in 






(78) 


accessible surface. Schur and Hoos (12) found that 
samples of cellulose shredded in water, then dried, 
and subsequently nitrated, showed a nigher nitrogen 
content than cellulose shredded in the dry state and 
subsequently nitrated. 

It is very interesting to note that cotton linters, 
highly swollen with aqueous caustic soda, then dried 
by solvent exchange, and subsequently collapsed by 
soaking with water and direct drying, when nitrated 
with a technical nitrating mixture showed a 0.2?^ 
decrease in nitrogen from that obtained by identical 
nitration of the swollen linters (Table XV, page ^5"), 
This decrease in nitrogen content of the nitrate from 
11.37 to 11.12^ was associated with a decrease in 
accessibility from 16^ to about 0.20^. This work was 
a corroboration of part of the research done by Brown 
and Purves (16). 

The decrease in nitrating ability found in highly 
swollen cotton linters collapsed by drying from water 
is directly in contrast to the increase of nitrogen 
content shown by nitrated cotton linters which were 
alternately wetted and dried. However, it must be 
kept in mind that linters swollen with strong caustic 
solution, and then treated with water, undergo a change 
in the crystal lattice of the cellulose (6l). A strong 
alkali solution affects both the crystalline as well 
as the amorphous regions of the cellulose (60), whereas

water is believed to affect the amorphous domain chiefly 
( 6 )^ 

It is evident that there is a correlation between 
the wetting drying cycles and the increase in access¬ 
ibility of the cotton linters. As the changing humid¬ 
ity in the atmosphere provides a situation in which 
such wetting drying cycles may occur, it was decided 
to investigate the role of atmospheric conditions in 
changing the reactivity of cellulose* Accordingly, 
sets of cellulose samples were exposed to conditions 
of weathering and storage, and then nitrated to deter¬ 
mine the change in reactivity resulting from such treat¬ 
ment (Samples Y and N, Table XVI, page Each set 

consisted of two samples of linters, differing in the 
ease of nitration resulting from either a series of 
wetting-drying treatments (Y) or alkali swelling followed 
by drying by solvent exchange to maintain increased 
accessibility and from water to decrease the accessibil¬ 
ity (N). All the linters so chosen had already been 
stored in a closed desiccator for seven months prior 
to weathering experiments (See Table XVI, page 8^)* 

When samples Y-l-E and Y-15-B (portions of the 
same cotton linters as Samply Y, Table XII, page 76), 
which were exposed to atmospheric conditions existing 
in a heated basement room, were nitrated with a new 
technical nitrating mixture, the nitrogen content of 
the nitrate of Y-15-B exceeded that of Y-l-B by 0*23^e

Moreover, Y-15-B gave a nitrate which was non-uniform 
in nitrogen content as was evidenced by the fact that 
six nitrogen analyses of it gave individual values of 
10,915 10,965 11,095 11*175 11,27; 11,42^, It is 
interesting to recall that portions of Samples Y-1 and 
Y-12 (See Table XII, page 76), which, prior to weather¬ 
ing had been esterified with a different technical 
nitrating mixture, yielded nitrates which showed a 
difference in nitrogen content of 0,35^* Samples of 
highly swollen and collapsed linters (N-1 and N-C-1), 
which formerly had been used to produce nitrates which 
showed a difference in nitrogen content of 0,25^ 

(Table XV, page sr), after being weathered in an 
unheated open shed for December, January and March and 
subsequently nitrated, gave nitrates which exhibited 
a difference of only 0,1^ in nitrogen contents Samples 
Y-3-0 and Y-9-0, formerly showing an increase of 0,22^ 
in nitrogen content of the corresponding nitrates for 
the six wetting drying cycles (Table XII, page 76), 
after weathering in an unheated open shed for December, 
January and February and subsequent nitration, gave 
nitrates having almost identical nitrogen content 
(11,05 and 11.04^, Table XVI, page Similarily, 

Samples Y-3-D and Y-12-D (formerly differing by 0,19^ N, 
Table XII), were kept in a desiccator over no drying 
agent, and when nitrated produced nitrates which had 
approximately the same nitrogen content (10,91 and 10,96^,

• '-itV f* ;■ 







( 84 ) 


Table XVI, page Bs)^ Moreover, the nitrogen content 
of the nitrate prepared from Sample Y-3-0 (which was 
exposed to outside atmospheric conditions) was 11.0?^, 
whereas that of the same sample, Y-3-D, which was kept 
in a relatively dry atmosphere during storage was 10#91^» 
It would, therefore appear that outside storage of dry 
cotton linters may lead to an improvement in their ease 
of nitration. It is apparent that the differences in 
reactivity towards nitrating agents, originally found 
for the cyclically wetted and dried cellulose, is 
eliminated hy weathering effects* 

To determine whether the duration of the water 
immersion was a controlling factor in attaining 
increased accessibility of the cellulose, quantities 
of the dewaxed cotton linters were soaked in distilled 
water for a period of seventeen days, then dried either 
in air or over phosphorus pentoxide under vacuum* 

Portions of these dried samples were given a second 
soaking for an additional thirty days and again dried 
as before* No significant difference was found in the 
degree of nitration obtained (Table XVII, page f^)* 
Apparently the difference in reactivity of the cotton 
linters is dependent upon the number of wetting and 
drying cycles rather than upon time of immersion in 
water*

Moreover, it was very interesting to discover that 
the nitrocelluloses from cotton linters, which were 
alternately wetted and sharply dried many times over 
phosphorus pentoxide under vacuum, showed a greater 
heterogeneity than nitrocelluloses obtained from cotton 
linters, wetted similarily, but air dried only prior to 
storage over concentrated sulphuric acid, or those 
obtained from linters which were air dried only© This 
heterogeneity was evidenced by the fact that in the 
determinations of the nitrogen content of the nitro¬ 
celluloses greater deviation from the mean was observed 
generally in the case of the nitrocelluloses obtained 
from the more sharply dried samples than from those 
dried less rigorously© 

In order to discover whether any changes in the 

degree of polymerization of the nitrocellulose' had 

occurred as a result, either directly or indirectly, 

of the alternate wetting and drying treatments of the 

cotton linters, viscosity determinations were made of 

the solutions of corresponding nitrocelluloses in 

w 

n-butyl acetate. When cotton linters, alternately 
wetted and sharply dried over phosphorus pentoxide 
under vacuum for seven cycles prior to nitration (Sample V), 
were nitrated, the intrinsic viscosity of the correspond- 
nitrates was lowered by 0.85 (11#40 to 10.5?? Table IX, 
Column 5? pag© 7o )o Sample X, subjected to eight similar 










( 87 ) 


ivetting treatments, but dried in air partially before 
being dried sharply over phosphorus pentoxide under 
vacuum, showed a decrease of 0*91 in the intrinsic viscos¬ 
ity of the nitrate (10*83 to 9.92, Table XI, column 5, 
page 75")* It is thus seen that a decrease in viscosity 
of the nitrate was associated with an increase in the 
number of wetting-drying cycles* It must be remembered 
that with the increase in the number of alternate wetting¬ 
drying treatments of cotton linters, there was an increase 
in nitrogen content of the corresponding nitrates (Tables 
IX and XI, column 4)* This decrease in viscosity is, 
therefore, surprising since an increase in viscosity is 
generally associated with an increase in degree of substit¬ 
ution of the nitrocellulose (35)* Probably the wetting 
drying cycles made the cotton linters more susceptible 
to cleavage of the macromolecule during nitration since 
degradation does occtir in technical nitrations (64)* 

Samply Y, cyclically wetted twelve times in a similar way 
to that employed for Samples V and X, but less rigorously 
dried (in air and then stored over concentrated sulphu¬ 
ric acid) when nitrated, suffered a decrease of only 
0*65 in intrinsic viscosity of the nitrates (Table XII, 
Column 5, page 7(b), Sharper drying is apparently accom¬ 
panied by greater decreases in intrinsic viscosity 
(Fig. 9> page

lead tetraacetate oxidation, test runs were made upon 
an ethyl acetate-acetic acid solution of glycerol and 
glucose, respectively (with 0.1 normal lead tetraacetate). 
Exactly the theoretical amounts of the tetraacetate, per 
mole of the oxidizable substance, were consumed. The 
ethyl acetate slowly reduced some tetraacetate, but this 
effect was corrected by a blank oxidation. 

Oxidations upon all the nitrocelluloses were performed 
in duplicate and gave remarkably close checks when the 
procedure of flushing the pipette, which was used for 
transferring the solution of nitrocellulose, was adopted. 
All oxidations of nitrocelluloses were carried out with 
portions of the same lead tetraacetate solution (approx¬ 
imately 0.107 normal)® 

To discover whether the lead tetraacetate would 
hydrolyze or otherwise attack positions protected by 
nitrate groups, a simultaneous experiment was performed 
upon a nitrocellulose, sample P, (13*8^ N) obtained with 
the phosphorus pentoxide-nitric acid mixture. The consump¬ 
tion by the nitrate, of approximately 0.01 moles oxidant 
per glucose unit, remained practically constant and low 
even after a period of seven hundred hours (Table VII, 
page 63 and Figure 10, page ^^r). 

Technical nitrocelluloses oxidized with 0.1 N lead 
tetraacetate for approximately one thousand hours showed 
continued consumption of the oxidant even after eight 
hundred hours (Samples Rq^o Rx^, Tables VI, XVIII, pages <6/ 
and , and Fig. 10, page ^5"). After four hundred hours.

it was believed that oxidation of the nitrocellulose, 
depicted by (Fig. 10) had attained a maximum consump¬ 
tion of lead tetraacetate. Thus, it was taken out of 
the bath and left at room temperature. Upon rechecking, 
sometime later, it was found that consumption of oxid¬ 
ant was still taking place, but since the temperature 
had not been kept constant, the remainder of the plot 
is not shown. The remaining Samples, R^^, R^, and R^y, 
were accordingly oxidized for a longer period of time® 
Considerable error arose in pipetting the nitrocellu¬ 
lose solutions during the first one hxindred hours of 
oxidation because of the fact that solutions of nitro- 
celluloses having a higher nitrogen content, were more 
viscous than those of nitrocelluloses with a lower per 
cent nitrogen® To eliminate this error, the pipette 
was, for the remainder of the experiments, flushed with 
ethyl acetate,' the flushing liquid being added to the 
solution to be titrated® 

Table VIII and XIX, pages and respectively, 
show the results of similar oxidations carried out upon 
nitrocelluloses (Sample S) having nitrogen content rang¬ 
ing from 9.46 to 9*94^® Here again a continual consump¬ 
tion of oxidant by the nitrocelluloses was observed even 
after a period of four hundred hours (Fig. 11 and 12). 

The cotton linters used in the preparation of nitrocellu¬ 
lose samples S were part of the same swollen linters 
which were used previously in the preparation of nitro-

identical conditions but differing, in time and temper¬ 
ature only, from those used in the preparation of Sq and 

SlQ. 

An attempt was made to oxidize nitrocelluloses, 
of 7 * 0 % nitrogen content, in ethyl acetate, but this 
was abandoned due to the insolubility of the mononitrate 
in the solvent* 

With reference to all work involving oxidation of 
nitrocelluloses, it might be said that lead tetraacetate 
oxidations, carried out under conditions as described 
in this thesis, failed to reveal data which might,be 
used to indicate any preferential esterification of the 
glucose unit (since no curve depicted in Figs* 10, 11, 

12, had attained zero slope)* Brown and Purves (63) 
also found that most of their purified nitrocelluloses 
showed a continuous consumption of oxidant even after 
a period of three hundred hours. However, nitrocellu¬ 
loses obi^ained from cotton linters which were alternately 
wetted and dried seventeen times consumed lessv.ioxidant 
than the nitrocelluloses obtained from cotton linters 
which were wetted and dried only once (Fig. 10, page 
and Fig* 11, page ). As consumption of oxidant by 
a nitrocellulose should decrease with increased degree

ted ^ glycols in % than in and similarily more in 
than in Therefore, it might be said that seven¬ 

teen cyclical wetting and drying treatments led to an 
increased ease of nitration of the hydroxyls in the 
glycol group* However, there is no evidence to show 
that the primary hydroxyl has not been similarily made 
more accessible by wetting drying cycles* 

All of the results support the hypothesis that 
the previous moisture history of the cotton linters 
plays an important role in influencing the ease of 
nitration of the cellulose©

SUMMRY 


Quantities of dewaxed cotton linters were given as 
many as seventeen alternate wetting and drying treat¬ 
ments. Drying after each immersion in water was achieved 
either in air or over phosphoric anhydride under vacuum. 
Samples of the dried linters were taken after each wet¬ 
ting-drying cycle and stored in a desiccator either over 
concentrated sulphuric acid or without a drying agent. 
Measurements of accessibility, degree of nitration, viscos¬ 
ity of the nitrates, and lead tetraacetate oxidations of 
the nitrates were made upon each sample. 

The accessibility to thallous ethylate in ether was 
found to increase with increase in the number of wetting¬ 
drying cycles. 

Improvement in degree of nitration with each of a 
series of nitrating mixtures, calculated to give nitrogen 
contents of from seven to fourteen per cent, paralleled 
the number of wetting-drying cycles and apparently reached 
a maximum in the region of twelve cycles. The increase of 
nitration was more pronounced with those samples m.ore 
sharply dried. Repeated nitrogen analyses indicated that 
the more vigorously dried linters gave nitrates of some¬ 
what more heterogeneous nature than those from, air-dried 
linters.

more effect upon linters than a three-hour Immersion* 

Exposure of samples of wetted and dried linters to 
atmospheric conditions in an open, unheated shed from 
December to March, or in a basement room for six months, 
largely eliminated the difference in degree of nitration 
previously possible but also tended to yield a nitrate of 
somewhat higher nitrogen content than obtained from the 
original untreated, dewaxed linters* 

The intrinsic viscosities of the nitrates in butyl 
acetate decreased as the number of wetting-drying cycles 
increased in spite of the parallel increase in per cent 
nitrogen* 

There was a progressive decrease in the consumption 
of lead tetraacetate oxidant by cellulose nitrate solu¬ 
tions with the increase in the number of alternate wet¬ 
ting-drying treatments of the original linters, but all 
nitrates investigated showed consumption of oxidant even 
after a period of nine hundred hours*
