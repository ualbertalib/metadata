SYNOPSIS 


The investigators primary aim in this study was to 
discover why pupils left school without obtaining a high 
school diploma. To secure the information the question¬ 
naire and the interview methods were used. 

It was found that there was no one reason given by 
high school drop-outs for leaving school. The reasons most 
frequently given by drop-outs were that they left to look 
for jobs, that they had poor teachers, and that the courses 
they had to take in school were unrelated to their voca¬ 
tional plans. 

The investigator also discovered other factors which 
may be associated with dropping out. These were the educa¬ 
tion and occupation of the parents, the lack of interest by 
pupils, the inadequacy of vocational training and counseling, 
the limitations of school facilities, and the overcrowded 
condition of schools. 

The secondary aim of the study was to compare the 
questionnaire method and the interview method in research 
of this kind. It was found that both methods were effec¬ 
tive, the former because it was an extensive study of a 
large sample and the latter because it was an intensive 
study of a smaller sample of drop-outs. A high degree of 
correspondence was found between results obtained by the 
two methods.

CHAPTER I 


PURPOSES OF THE STUDY 

In 19 % Alberta made a revision of its school curricula, 
introducing what has come to be called "progressive educa¬ 
tion*" Traditional academic subjects were retained but many- 
new courses of a semi-practical nature were added. The 
"activity" principle of teaching and learning was made an 
important feature of all courses* Among the benefits anti¬ 
cipated from these changes was an increased "holding" power, 
especially on the part of the senior high schools. It was 
expected that students would remain longer and progress 
further. 

It is now apparent that these hopes have not been 
realized, at least not to the extent desired. In the first 
place, many schools still offer a highly academic program. 
Secondly, students continue to drop out in considerable 
numbers from all of the high school grades, and all too few 
remain to complete requirements for university matriculation 
or even for the high school diploma. 

1. The Drop-out Problem 

The drop-out problem is a serious one. Less than 
fifty per cent of the pupils entering Canadian junior high

schools, graduate with a high school diploma * 1 Teachers 
report that many of the drop-outs have average or above 
average ability and are not leaving school because they 
could not pass the courses if they worked. They must have 
other reasons for not completing the work they began and 
were capable of doing. 

Pupils who leave school without having secured a high 
school diploma are commonly referred to as 11 dr op-out s’*. The 
primary purpose of this study was to discover the reasons 
for their dropping out. To this end a number of factors 
were canvassed: pupil opinions, attitudes, and interests; 
vocational plans at the beginning and end of school careers; 
subjects liked and disliked; expressed reasons for leaving 
school; and the nationality and occupation of parents. 

In addition to this the study includes a follow-up of 
the drop-outs in the world of work. It surveys the kinds of 
jobs in which they are employed, their salaries and the sat¬ 
isfaction they derive from their present occupations. 

This study is further interested in the attitudes of 
drop-outs toward the vocational aid given them, and in their 
opinions of the adequacy or the inadequacy of the curricu¬ 
lum. It was felt that in such a study any shortcomings or 
faults in the courses, school facilities, teachers, and

vocational training would be brought to light. This study 
therefore, examines the causes of drop-outs in Southern 
Alberta, and on this basis makes inferences and recommenda¬ 
tions. 


2. Review of Related Studies 

Only two reports of the previous studies of drop-outs 
were available to the investigator. One of these, Dr. H. J. 
Dillon’s "Why Students Leave School" is the record of an in¬ 
vestigation of 1360 drop-outs in the United States. The 
other, the Canadian Research Committee on Practical Educa¬ 
tion’s "Your Child Leaves School" is the report of a study 
which includes an analysis of drop-outs in Canada. 

Dr. Dillon’s work was done for the purpose of examin¬ 
ing the problems of American educational systems. Dillon 
probed the weaknesses of the programs that caused so many 
people to discontinue school and recommended ways in which 
the programs could be modified in order to retain more 
pupils. The reasons given for leaving school showed that 
seventy-one percent either preferred working, disliked some 
teacher or course, thought they could learn more out of school, 
or did not want to repeat subjects. 

Only 21 per cent left for economic reasons. Most of 
these withdrew without consulting anyone on the school staff. 
Dillon found that one third of the drop-outs held three or

more jobs in their first post-school year. Half of the 
drop-outs regretted leaving school. 

His conclusions are summarized below: 

(1) A large percentage of the drop-outs have either poor 
scholarship, poor attendance, or a dislike for school. 

(2) Any one reason may be the cause of the other two. 

Poor scholarship may be caused by lack of ability on the 
part of the pupils, or by courses that do not make sense 
to them. 

(3) Although poor health may cause poor attendance it is 
not a major reason. 

(4) Seventy-one percent of those who quit had repeated 
courses. Dr. Dillon recommended that teachers should help 
pupils with poor attendance records rather than threaten them 
with expulsion, detention, or court action. The pupils should 
be given an experience of success and recognition to induce a 
liking for school. 

The Canadian Research Committee on Practical Education 
carried out a study of 12,124 graduates and of 14,21? drop¬ 
outs from Canadian Schools during 1948. It was found that of* 
every hundred pupils who start Primary School only twenty-two 
finish high school. 

Approximately 134,000 pupils drop-out yearly from Cana¬ 
dian schools. Eifty-nine percent of the boys and fifty-one 
percent of the girls who start junior high school (Grade VII) 



- 5 - 


do not remain long enough to graduate with a Grade XI stand¬ 
ing or junior matriculation. The Committee found that the 
drop-out rate varied among provinces and that it was greater 
in rural than in urban areas. 

The reasons for dropping out were summarized according 
to sex. Each drop-out was requested to give three reasons 
why he left school. The three main reasons given by boys 
were: 

(1) Reasons related to the school, (given by 327>); 

(2) Economic reasons, (given by 307«); 

(3) Personal reasons, (given by 18%). 

The three main reasons given by girls were: 

(1) Reasons related to the school, (given by 437*); 

(2) Economic reasons, (given by 30>); 

(3) Personal reasons, (given by 217 .). 

The reasons relating to the school included lack of interest, 
lack of ability, and unsuitability of the curriculum. Eco¬ 
nomic reasons included desire to earn money, inadequacy of 
family income, and need to help at home. Personal reasons 
included attitude of parents, opportunity for securing a 
good position, maladjustment, and illness. 

The study shows that repetition of grades is a danger 
signal indicative of early dropping out. Among the drop¬ 
outs are about one-half of the pupils with average or supe¬ 
rior learning capacity, capable of graduating from high

school. About eighty-five percent of the ones of below 
average learning capacity drop out. 

idmaller schools offer only academic courses. Larger 
centres offer more practical courses such as shop work, home 
economics, and commercial training. The report states that 
more pupils drop out of vocational than out of academic 
courses because after a year or two in high school these 
pupils must leave to earn a living. 

The Committee^ conclusions are summarized below. 

(1) About sixty percent of the pupils in smaller centres 
drop out rather than take the academic courses in the upper 
grades. 

(2) At present only ten percent of the pupils who enter high 
school intend to go to university. 

(5) An opportunity for a good position is given more fre¬ 
quently as a reason for dropping out from the larger schools 
than from the smaller schools. 

(4) A lack of interest in school, need to help at home, and 
unsuitability of curriculum are more frequently given as 
reasons for dropping out in smaller schools. 

(5) Drop-outs in the superior intelligence class tend to 
be due to economic reasons, and a lack of interest; in the 
inferior class to discouragement because of grade repetition. 
(,6) Drop-outs are four times as prevalent in the low income 


group

(7) Office jobs attract the largest number of girls, and 
trades the largest number of boys* 

The Committee recommended that the schools should give a 
general education which provides for the cultural opportu¬ 
nities and which deals more fully with the practical prob¬ 
lems in life* High schools should teach what is involved 
in marriage, in buying and selling, and in running a home. 

The Canadian Research Committee undertook the task 
of surveying the educational situation in Canada. It gave 
educators a broad overview of the drop-out question, and 
indicated that the problem was not confined to any one area 
or province. Since it was a survey, it could do no more 
than give a general picture of the whole situation. It 
covered only a few major centres in each province and there¬ 
fore omitted large areas of the country. 

The study indicated the seriousness of the situation 
yet made only general recommendations because of the vast¬ 
ness of the field covered. The study was based on the 
teachers 1 or principals* opinions, and, although drop-outs 
may have been consulted in some cases, it was not a general 
practice. The survey did not include pupil reactions to the 
curriculum, the length of the school year, extra-curricular 
activities, and other pertinent factors. It made no allow¬ 
ance for pupils* suggestions, recommendations, and criti¬ 
cisms of the school system.

The survey does give a sound background for a detailed 
study of a limited section of the country at a particular 
grade level designed to reveal the particular difficulties 
in that area and to provide a basis for recommendations for 
improving the situation.

CHAPTER II 


METHODS OF SECURING AND ORGANIZING DATA 
1. Initiating the Study 

It was decided that the area under investigation for 
this study was to be the Southern Alberta High School In¬ 
spectorate, hereafter known as southern Alberta. The study 
was to include all drop-outs in Grade XI and Grade XII, 
except those in one-room high schools, over the period from 
1947 to 1950 inclusive. 

It was recognized that there would be many difficul¬ 
ties in conducting this study. In many of the smaller 
schools there was a large turn-over of teaching staff. In 
many school systems accurate records of pupils were not kept 
It was decided that the study would include all high schools 
of two or more rooms. The reasons for omitting the one-room 
high schools are given below. 

(1) Pupils seldom go further than Grade X in the one-room 
high school. After Grade X the pupils continuing go to 
other schools giving a wider range of subjects. 

(2) If pupils do go to another school without advising the 
principal, they may wrongly be considered as drop-outs. 

(3) If these pupils leave school at the Grade X level, 
they have not yet attained the lov/er limit set for the study

(4) The staff changes so frequently in one-room schools 
that an accurate drop-out estimate cannot be had. 

In order to secure an accurate sample of the drop-out 
population in Southern Alberta it was decided to attempt to 
obtain responses from the whole population of drop-outs in 
the area between 1?47 a&d 1?30. The sample included all 
the high schools in Southern Alberta, from two-room rural 
high schools to the three largest centres, the Alexandra 
High School in Medicine Hat, the Lethbridge Collegiate 
Institute in Lethbridge, and the Taber High School in Taber. 

2. The Questionnaire 

In preparing the questionnaire It was felt that the 
recording of answers should be made as simple as was consis¬ 
tent with acquiring the desired information. Accordingly, 
the answers to the questionnaire were given by words or 
phrases, check marks, X*s, or by the encircling of one of 
the given letters. When the questionnaire was completed 
several principals and staff members in Southern Alberta 
schools offered their suggestions and criticisms. The final 
product was submitted to the thesis committee and was finally 
approved. A copy appears in the appendix.

Johnson furnished a list of all the principals in his inspec¬ 
torate. The investigator then sent a letter to each principal 
asking for names, addresses, and if possible, the intelligence 
quotients of all the drop-outs over the years 1947 to 1950. 

A majority of the principals replied within two months. Some 
had no records of the drop-outs in their schools. Several 
replies included names, addresses, and intelligence quotients, 
but the majority could furnish only names and addresses. 
Therefore, it was necessary to omit the I.Q,* as a possible 
drop-out factor. A few principals were newly appointed and 
could find no records of the drop-outs from previous years. 

The result was that the list was quite inadequate. 

Since further search was necessary, the principals of 
both the Lethbridge Collegiate Institute of Lethbridge, and 
the Alexandra High School in Medicine Hat kindly permitted 
the investigator to use their records. A final list of 503 
names and addresses was thus compiled. 

The prepared questionnaire together with self-addressed 
envelopes from the investigator were then sent to each of the 
drop-outs. After these were mailed, an accurate summary of 
the progress of the return of the questionnaires was kept. 
Sixty-six letters were returned by postal employees because 
no forwarding address had been left. After a period of one 
month only seventy-three completed questionnaires had been 
returned even though some of these came from as far as the

Royal Canadian Mounted Police barracks in Ontario and from 
Navy men on the Atlantic coast. 

In view of the small number of answers it was found 
necessary to send post card reminders to all the other drop¬ 
outs who had apparently received their questionnaires but 
had not answered them. In the next two months another 
thirty-two questionnaires were received. It appeared doubt¬ 
ful that a further reminder would be useful. Ultimately, 
the sample was considered complete with one hundred and five 
completed questionnaires. 

In addition, the investigator interviewed ten boys and 
ten girls, living near Taber, who had left school in Grade 
XL and Grade XII without receiving high school diplomas. 

The questionnaire used in the statistical study was employed 
as a guide for the personal interviews. The purpose of this 
local study was two-fold: 

(1J to compare the reasons of Taber drop-outs with 

those of the entire population, 

(2) to gather mere insight into the reasons given by 

drop-outs. 

In this study it was necessary to make an appointment 
with the person concerned and interview him or her at a 
mutually convenient time and place. After rapport had been 
established the interviews lasted from one to three hours. 
The results of these interviews were gratifying and the aims

set forth for this portion of the study were satisfactorily 
achieved. 


4„ Limitations of the Study 

Some of the limitations of the study are given below: 

(1) while the study was designed to include all the drop¬ 
outs in the Southern Alberta area, because of the principals 
inability to supply the names of all those leaving school in 
Grade XI and Grade XIX from 1?47 to 1950 , the sample was not 
as complete as was originally expected. 

(2) The original plan to ascertain whether dropping out was 
related to the pupil T s l.Q. was not carried out because of 
lack of information. Although some principals gave the l.Q,. 
others did not have the data. 

(3) The pupils to whom the questionnaires were sent did not 
all reply. Actually only about twenty percent ox the origi¬ 
nal sample make up the present study. 

(4) In some cases every question was not answered fully by 
the pupils. 

(3) All answers were opinions or based on the opinions of 
the pupils. 

(6) Some of the interviewees did not discuss the problem 
freely, perhaps because they knew the investigator to be a 
teacher himself. 


It must be assumed that a cross-section of the drop-

out population of Southern Alberta answered the question¬ 
naire; approximately the same number of rural as urban 
questionnaires was received. Although the information is 
dependent on opinion, it should be considered valid in so 
far as it represents the actual experiences of the drop-outs. 

In addition, the drop-outs were asked to offer sugges¬ 
tions which would assist curriculum builders and educators 
to shape a high school program that might be satisfactory 
to a larger percentage of our school population. The omis¬ 
sion of some information in a few cases did not alter con¬ 
clusions since a large majority answered all the questions. 

Most of the interviewees appeared pleased to have been 
chosen as the ones to express their views on such important 
matters as the curriculum and education generally. They 
were very frank and took a mature attitude toward the work 
being undertaken. 

It is necessary to equate the problems of the drop¬ 
outs in the Taber Division with those of the drop-outs in 
the entire area under investigation so that a comparison of 
the two studies may be permitted. Such a comparison is jus¬ 
tifiable since the personal interviews constitute a more 
intensive study of the smaller number of drop-outs. 



CHAPTER III 


GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE SAMPLE 

This chapter analyzes the sample by sex, age at the 
time of dropping out, and the grade last attended. The oc¬ 
cupations of the parents were studied to discover, if pos¬ 
sible, a relation between parental occupations and numbers 
of drop-outs. In addition, the nationalities and the school 
attainment of the parents were studied. The distance a 
pupil travels to school was also considered as a possible 
factor in dropping out. 

The general sample consisted of 103 boys and girls 
from the cities, towns, and rural areas of Southern Alberta. 
This sample was made up of 60 boys and 43 girls born between 
the years 1928 and 1934. 

1. Ages of the Drop-outs 

Table I gives the pupils 1 ages and grades at the time 
of dropping out. Sixty-one per cent of the grade XL boys 
and 80 per cent of the girls were seventeen years of age or 
less when they left school. This indicates that the majority 
of the Grade XI drop-outs had at least average ability, 1 ' 

^Average ability is taken to mean an I.Q,. range of 90 to 
110. Above average ability is taken to mean an I.Q,. range 
of over 110.

since they were not likely to have failed a grade if they 
were seventeen years of age and in Grade XI. Sixteen per 
cent of the boys and 8 per cent of the girls dropping out 
in Grade XI were eighteen years of age. This may indicate 
that they began school at seven years of age or failed a 
year because of a prolonged illness, a transfer, or a lack 
of ability. Only 10 per cent of the Grade XI boys were 
nineteen or twenty years of age, possibly indicating a 
previous failure.

boys and 85 per cent of the girls in Grade XII were eighteen 
years of age or less when they left school. This also indi¬ 
cates average or above average ability. Only 13 par cent of 
the boys and 3 per cent of the girls dropping out in Grade 
XII were nineteen years old or over. 

The findings and implications of Table I are that a 
large majority of the Grade XI and Grade XII drop-outs have 
the ability to graduate from our school system. These find¬ 
ings were corroborated by the information received from some 

of the principals. The median I.Q,. for about 150 drop-outs 

2 

indicated average ability. 

2. Nationality of the Parents 

Is the nationality of the parent an important factor 
in determining the drop-out? Do pupils leave school because 
of language difficulties? 

Prom Table II it is apparent that 50 per cent of the 
parents of the drop-outs were Canadian born. In addition, 

79 per cent of the parents were either Canadian, American, 
English, Irish, or Scottish. All these are English speaking. 
The remaining 21 per cent of the parents were of non-English 
speaking nationality. The pupils of this minority group may

These drop-outs were -some of the original sample of 505 
names and not necessarily the ones that answered the 
questionnaire.

-In¬ 


difference between the relative numbers of drop-outs from 
either of these groups. It may be assumed, therefore, that 
language difficulties due to the nationality of the parents 
is not a major factor in dropping out in Grade XI and Grade 
XII. 


3. Parents 1 School Attainment 

Does the school attainment of the parents have any 
bearing on the attainment of the pupils? Do drop-outs 
occur more frequently in homes of low educational status? 

Table III shows that only 1 per cent of the fathers 
and 2 per cent of the mothers of drop-outs did not attend 
school at all. In addition, it may be noted that 61 per 
cent of the fathers and 43 per cent of the mothers received 
only a public school education. 

Only about one-eighth, 12 per cent, of the parents 
graduated from a high school or continued with further edu¬ 
cation. In other words, 8? per cent of the fathers and 86 
per cent of the mothers of these drop-outs did not graduate 
from a high school. Of these, more than one-half obtained 
only a public school education. 

The findings indicate that, as a rule, pupils get as 
much as or more education than did their parents. However, 
there seems to be a direct bearing of the parents 1 education 
on the education of the pupil, whether it be due to:

From Table IV the findings are that more than 30 per 
cent of the drop-outs lived within one mile of a high school. 
73 per cent of these ex-pupils were within four miles, or a 
reasonable walking distance from a high school. Only 21 per 
cent of the pupils lived over six miles from school and 
these were vanned to the schools. 

Since schools are easily accessible to a large majority 
of the drop-outs, it is apparent that the distance of a high 
school from a pupil’s home cannot be considered as an impor¬ 
tant factor in determining dropping out.

3. Occupations of the Fathers of the Drop-outs 

Is the occupational group to which the father belongs 
a factor in the rate of dropping out? Are school leavers 
influenced by the economic status of their families? 

3 

The occupations were classified as shown below: 

(1) Professional - members of all recognized professions, 
including journalists, and musicians. 

(2) Proprietors and managers - owners and managers of coal 
mines, lumber mills, construction companies, transpor¬ 
tation companies, wholesale and retail stores, and 
elevator agents. 

(3) Clerical - ticket agents, travellers, and salesmen. 

(4) Skilled - f oremen in lumber mills, mines, manufacturing 
companies, and construction. 

(3) Farmers - owners and managers of farms. 

(6) Semi-skilled - barbers, butchers, fitters, operators, 
linemen, firemen, and policemen. 

(7) Unskilled - laborers (farm), miners, janitors, and 
lumbermen. 

Table Y shows the distribution of the drop-outs accor¬ 
ding to the occupation of the father. Of all the drop-outs 
only 3 per cent of the boys* parents and 2 per cent of the

girls f parents were in clerical occupations. 1? per cent of 
the boys 1 parents and 25 per cent of the girls* parents were 
in either the professional, or the proprietor and manager 
groups. One-third of all the drop-outs, 33 per cent, were 
those whose fathers were farmers. Approximately another 
third, 34 per cent, of the boys who left school were those 
whose fathers* occupations were semi-skilled or unskilled. 

25 per cent of the girls who left school were daughters of 
semi-skilled or unskilled laborers.

tween the occupation of the father and the rate of dropping

out. Since Southern Alberta is largely a farming area it 
would be expected that a large percentage of the drop-outs 
would be farm children. However, there are also large per¬ 
centages of school leavers from the semi-skilled and un¬ 
skilled occupational groups, while only comparably small 
percentages of drop-outs come from professional, and skilled 
families. It may,therefore, be assumed that there is a 
direct relationship between the pupil’s chances of dropping 
out and the occupation of his father. 

6. Summary 

Since the majority of the drop-outs in Grade XI and 
Grade XII have average or above average ability, they are 
not leaving school because of a lack of ability. Language 
difficulties are not significant either, since most of the 
parents were born and educated in English-speaking countries. 
Although most parents now consider a high school education 
both useful and valuable, 4 over 85 per cent of the parents 
did not graduate from a high school. About two-thirds of 
the parents of drop-outs come from semi-skilled, unskilled, 
or farming occupations. 

The research done in this chapter indicates that 
although drop-outs usually acquire more education than their 
parents did, the parents’ education exerts an influence on

the drop-outs T educational achievement. The study also 
indicates that dropping out occurs more frequently in 
families of low economic status, i.e., in semi-skilled, 
unskilled and farming occupations. These findings agree 
with those of the Canadian Research Committee study for the 
whole of Canada.

CHAPTER IV 


REASONS FOR ATTENDING AND LEAVING SCHOOL 

This chapter investigates the changes in the vocational 
plans of school leavers while they were still in the high 
schools. The kinds of extra-curricular activities they par¬ 
ticipated in are examined and those activities which they 
now consider valuable are enumerated. The courses that the 
pupils liked at school are listed in order of preference. 

The reasons given by drop-outs for their school attendance 
and their reasons for dropping out are ©numerated and corre¬ 
lated with the other factors discussed in this chapter. 

1. Modification of Vocational Plan 

Do drop-outs change their vocational plans from the 
time they enter high school to the time they leave school? 

Do such changes endanger their chances of graduating? 

From Table VI it may be observed that almost two-thirds 
of the drop-outs C64 per cent) modified their vocational 
plans during their high school careers. Thirty-seven per 
cent of these changed their plans from a university course 
to a technical or commercial course. Of the boys who changed 
their vocational plans, 35 per cent are undecided at present, 
20 per cent are faming, and 43 per cent are in unskilled 
trades.

Of the entire sample, 2? per cent did not alter their 
plans after entering the High School but of these none had 
planned vocations demanding university training. The girls 
in this group all wanted to be office workers or stenogra¬ 
phers. Of the boys, 77 per cent wanted to become farmers, 
and 23 per cent wished to enter the semi-skilled trades. 

10 per cent of the drop-outs had not decided on a vocation 
when they entered the high school, and were still undecided 
when they left school at least two years later. 

Almost three-quarters, 74 per cent, of the drop-outs 













- 28 - 


who enter high schools modify their vocational plans or have 

no plans at all. It is probable that such a change in the 

pupil f s vocational plans, without a qualified counselor’s 

assistance, ^ is detrimental to his chances of receiving a 

high school diploma. Although this change in program may 

be a normal process, it can be assumed that the lack of 

2 3 

proper vocational training at the present time increases 
the probability of dropping out. 

2. Extra-curricular Activities 

Are extra-curricular activities considered by drop-outs 
as important factors in a high school education? Are the 
pupils receiving and participating in those activities which 
they can best use in post-school situations? 

Table VII indicates the extra-curricular activities. 

The three in which the pupils participated most frequently, 
were , in order of preference, athletics, dramatics, and 
music for the boys, and athletics, music, and dramatics for 
the girls. The activity in which the least number of pupils 
participated was a study of political affairs for both the 
boys and the girls. 

The three activities that the pupils think would have

All the pupils participated in at least two extra¬ 
curricular activities but regret that they failed to parti¬ 
cipate in one or two others. It may, therefore, be assumed 
that these activities are important to a pupil’s wholesome

development. More than one-third of all drop-outs, 36 per 
cent, consider debating and speech training an important 
extra-curricular activity; therefore a special effort should 
be made to introduce it into the present curriculum. It may 
also be advisable to introduce some hobby clubs, both be¬ 
cause pupils who leave school desire it and because the 
shorter working hours of the present day require positive 
outside interests of this kind.

3* Favorite subjects 

What courses are favorites among the drop-outs? Are 
the compulsory subjects among the liked or disliked? Would 
additional courses in any field retain pupils who are other¬ 
wise dropping out? 

Sven with school leavers the compulsory subjects and 
the academic electives top the list of favorites* The three 
most popular courses with the boys were mathematics, physics, 
and shop. With the girls the favorites were social studies, 
commercial courses, and math emetics. Shop was listed as one 
of the favorite subjects by 30 per cent of the boys, while 
home economics was listed by only 13 per cent of the girls. 
Sixty per cent of the girls listed commercial subjects as 
one of the favorites. 

One of the reasons academic courses topped the list 
may have been that the majority of the smaller schools 
offered only an academic program. Nevertheless technical 
and commercial subjects ranked high in the list of favorites. 
This fact demonstrates the necessity of increasing facilities 
for commercial and technical electives. 

4. Reasons for Attending High School 

Drop-outs explained why they continued at school as 
long as they did by selecting three of the eleven given 
reasons, since each was permitted to choose three reasons,

the total need not equal one hundred per cent. Provision 
was also made for additional information. 

From Table IX it is apparent that a majority of the 
boys and girls, 67 per cent, continued school because it 















- 33 - 


trained them for a job. Thirty girls, 67 per cent, and 
twenty-one boys, 33 per cent, went to school because they 
liked to go. One of the three reasons given by thirty boys, 

30 per cent, was that it was the natural thing to do after 
Grade IX. Parental insistence that pupils go to school was 
advanced as a reason by eleven girls, 24 per cent, and twenty- 
two boys, 37 per cent. This was given as a reason by those 
who had no vocational plans in mind. 

The four reasons given by drop-outs for attending 
school, in order of frequency, are listed below: 

(1) It trained them for jobs, 67 per cent. 

(2) They liked to go to school, 4? per cent. 

(3) It was the natural thing to do after Grade IX, 39 per 
cent. 

(4) The parents insisted the pupils go to school, 31 per 
cent. 

Of the twelve boys who gave other reasons for continuing 
school: 

(1) seven wanted more education to insure better jobs, 

(2) three wanted to go to university, 

(3) one did not want to get out on his own too early in 
life, 

(4) one went because he had no traible passing his grade. 

Of the three girls giving other reasons for continuing 


school:

(1) one wanted to become a nurse, 

(2) one went because high school education taught her to 
meet and think out problems for herself, 

(5) one was undecided as to what she wanted to do and just 
went to do something. 

Schools are succeeding in holding the pupils 1 inter¬ 
ests when they continue to come to school for such reasons 
as: the high school trains one for a job, it prepares 
pupils for marriage, pupils like to go to school, or they 
like to study. 

However, more than one-third, 39 per cent, of the pupils 
gave as one of their reasons, the fact that it was the natural 
thing to do after passing the last grade. It was evident that 
in such cases there might be a lack of interest. These pupils 
were not looking ahead toward some goal or level of achieve¬ 
ment but rather backwards to their last completed grade. In 
addition, almost one-third, 31 per cent, of the pupils went 
to school because their parents insisted that they go. This 
indicates other defects in the school system. The schools 
were not inducing these pupils to come to school; rather the 
parents were forcing them to go. It was to be expected then, 
that when the pressure was relaxed, because of financial or 
other difficulties in the home, the pupils took advantage of 
the opportunity and dropped out of school. 

As indicated in the preceding paragraph, more than one- 



- 35 - 


third of the high school drop-outs do not have a wholesome 
attitude towards the school. As long as pupils continue to 
come to school only because they passed the last grade or 
because their parents insist that they go, the schools can 
expect a fair percentage of drop-outs. Reasons which indi¬ 
cate a lack of interest in school work. on the part of the 
students are quite frequently used by drop-outs 

5* Reasons for Leaving School 

The drop-outs were given seventeen probable reasons 
for leaving school. Provision was also made for additional 
reasons they may have had. Each drop-out chose the three 
reasons that applied to him and marked these 1, 2, 3, in 
order of importance. The results are tabulated in Table X. 

From Table X it may be observed that the three main 
reasons chosen by the boys were also the three main reasons 
chosen by the girls. In order of importance they were: 

(1) dropped out to look for a job, J?2 per cent; 

(2) dropped out because of curriculum deficiencies, 2? per 
cent; 

(3) dropped out because of poor teaching, 28 per cent. 

Other important reasons for leaving school were poor 
grades at school,given by 20 per cent of the sample, and 
failure in some subjects ; given by 16 per cent of the drop¬ 
outs. It should be noted that of the twelve boys who left

school because of failure in some courses, eleven failed 
English, three failed mathematics courses, two failed social 
studies, and two failed a foreign language. Of the five 
girls who reported failing courses, four failed English, one 
failed social studies and one failed a foreign language. 

Only 10 per cent of the drop-outs, 9 boys and 2 girls, left 
school primarily because of financial difficulties. 7 per 
cent left because of illness. There were no pupils to whom 
a high school was not available and no pupils left school 
because parents were not interested in the pupils 1 further 
training. 

Some of the other reasons given by pupils were: 

(1) dropped out because of lack of interest in school work, 

22 per cent; 

(2) dropped out because of the offer of a good job, 9 per¬ 
cent . 

Chart I supplements Table X. The information was re- 

4 

classified into the following three groups: 

A. Reasons relating to the school 

1. Unsuitability of the curriculum - not getting what 

was wanted, courses unrelated to vocational plan, 

7 ' ' ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ 

The purpose of this reclassification was to permit a closer 

comparison between the reasons for dropping out as given by 
school leavers in Southern Alberta over the period 1947- 
19.50, and the reasons given for the whole of Canada as 
presented by the 1948 study, "Your Child Leaves School", by 
the Canadian Research Committee on Practical Education, p.19

weak student activity program, enrolled in a techni¬ 
cal school. 

2. Lack of ability - low grades, failed some subjects. 

3* Lack of interest - no interest in school, friends did 
not go. 

B. Economic reasons 

1. Desire to earn money - left to look for a job. 

2. Family income - financial difficulties, brother or 
sister in school and both could not go, could not 
dress as well as the others. 

3. Needed at home. 

C. Personal reasons 

1. Opportunity for position - a good job offered. 

2. Illness. 

3* Others - marriage or plans for marriage. 

Chart I indicates that 73 per cent of all the boys who 
left school gave the unsuitability of the curriculum as one 
of their reasons for leaving. 38 per cent of the girls gave 
the same reason. Lack of ability was given as a reason by 
43 per cent of the boys and 24 per cent of the girls. Of the 
economic reasons, the desire to earn money was the most sig¬ 
nificant. It was advanced by 60 per cent of the boys and 42 
per cent of the girls. This reason seems closely associated 
with the various reasons related to the school. 

It is apparent that the reasons relating to the school 
are the most important and are more frequent among the boys

than the girls. Economic reasons are second in importance 
and also more frequent among boys. Personal reasons for 
dropping out are least important, and are more frequent 
among the girls. 

All the pupils did not give three reasons for dropping 
out. Some gave only one. 

The reasons given are consistent with the other data 
of this study and are comparable to the reasons given in the 
study by the Canadian Research Council on Practical Education. 

6• Summary 

Most of the drop-outs stayed in school as long as they 
did because it trained them for a job or because they liked 
to gOo While at school they participated in pleasing extra¬ 
curricular activities such as athletics, music, and dramatics. 
At present, most drop-outs realize the value of participating 
in a more varied program of activities while at school. Some 
of those recommended for the schools are debating and speech 
training, journalism, hobby craft, student government, and 
religion. 

A high percentage of the drop-outs changed their voca¬ 
tional plans during their high school careers. All the 
changes from matriculation were to technical or commercial 
programs. In these areas they found a lack of suitable 
courses. Since the curriculum was not suited to their needs

CHAPTER Y 


ATTITUDES TOWARDS SCHOOL 

This chapter is concerned chiefly with the attitudes 
of the drop-outs towards various phases of the school curri¬ 
culum and training. The drop-outs were asked to criticize 
high school training as a preparation for post-school living. 
They were also asked to estimate the help in vocational plan¬ 
ning given them by various school, home, and community agen¬ 
cies. 

The answers given were very brief. They were merely 
given by checking one of the three possible answers namely: 

(1) highly satisfied 

(2) moderately satisfied (about average) 

(3) dissatisfied (disappointed) with the particular training 
or experience. Further comments on these topics are given 
by drop-outs in Chapters VIII and IX. 

1. Attitudes of Drop-outs Towards 
High School Training 

Chart II gives the boys* and girls' attitudes towards 
each of the questions asked. The results are given in per¬ 
centages to permit an easier comparison of the two sexes. 

In a very high percentage of the cases all the questions 
were answered. 

Since this group of drop-outs was assumed to be an

accurate sample of the whole population it was further as¬ 
sumed that the answers should closely follow the normal 
distribution. That is, for any question asked 25 per cent 
of the population would be very satisfied, 25 per cent 
would be dissatisfied and 50 per cent would be moderately 
satisfied. That it was an accurate sample, is verified by 
the fact that the means of the first and third quartiles 
for the chart were 25 per cent i 2 per cent for both boys 
and girls. Since there were only three possible answers 
for each question it was not readily possible to calculate 
any levels of significance other than by noting the devi¬ 
ations from the mean as they occurred. 

Erom Chart II it is apparent that a large majority of 
drop-outs are satisfied with the schools' program in train¬ 
ing them how to meet people easily. Eighty-six per cent of 
the boys and 82 per cent of the girls are either moderately 
or very satisfied with the training received in this field. 
In the closely related field of undertaking and doing new 
tasks, 82 per cent of the boys and 51 per cent of the girls 
were at least moderately satisfied. The areas of writing 
and speaking effectively, and training for effective use of 
leisure time, were regarded as about average, with fewer 
boys dissatisfied than girls. In addition, 84 per cent of 
the entire sample were satisfied that the high school gave 
the pupils a broader outlook on life.

However, a large number of drop-outs, 34 per cent of 
the boys and 30 per cent of the girls, were dissatisfied 
with the training they received in supervising and directing 
the activities of others. Less than one half of this number 
were highly satisfied. Training in a closely related field, 
that of civic and community life, was also considered by 
drop-outs to be inadequate, with only 8 per cent of the boys 
and 11 per cent of the girls highly satisfied. More than 
three times this number were disappointed. 

Information and advice on further education was accep¬ 
ted as satisfactory by more girls than boys. In addition 
only 36 per cent of the boys and 70 per cent of the girls 
regarded their high school training as satisfactory for the 
vocation they are now in. Almost two-thirds of the boys 
were dissatisfied. Their comments are discussed fully in 
Chapters VII and VIII. Both boys and girls were very dis¬ 
appointed with the guidance and counsel given them in the 
selection of jobs. 40 per cent of the entire sample were 
dissatisfied. Chart III enlarges on this topic. 

2. Assistance in Planning Their Futures 

In Chart III, the drop-outs were asked to indicate as 
in Chart II, their attitudes towards the help given them by 
school and out-of-school agencies in planning their futures. 
It may be observed that the parents gave their children much

assistance in planning their futures. Fifty-five per cent 
of the boys and 64 per cent of the girls were highly satis¬ 
fied with this parental aid. Less than 10 per cent of the 
drop-outs were dissatisfied. The drop-outs were also 
reasonably satisfied with the help they received from their 
brothers, sisters, and friends. 

40 per cent of the girls were highly satisfied with 
the vocational information they received from the books they 
read in high school. The boys 1 comments were normally dis¬ 
tributed. The Vocations and Guidance course was considered 
unsatisfactory by 3.5 per cent of the boys and 21 per cent of 
the girls. Since there were also 30 per cent of the boys 
and 43 per cent of the girls who were highly satisfied with 
the course, the discrepancy may have been due to the method 
of presenting the course. 

The replies of the drop-outs to the assistance given 
by some member of the school staff in planning their futures 
were normally distributed. However, the assistance given by 
high school counselors was disappointing. About one-half of 
the drop-outs were not satisfied. It should be noted that 
many of the dissatisfied pupils remarked that there was no 
counselor in their school. The amount of vocational advice 
given to high school pupils by divisional guidance directors 
was also very disappointing. Only about 10 per cent of the 
drop-outs were pleased with the assistance received while 37

per cent of the boys and 60 per cent of the girls were dis¬ 
pleased. Many drop-outs remarked that there were no gui¬ 
dance directors in their divisions. It is apparent that 
more vocational advice is expected by drop-outs from a vo¬ 
cational supervisor at the divisional level. 

3. Parental Attitudes Towards the Value of 
High School Education 

It was considered possible that many of the drop-outs 
resulted from a lack of appreciation by parents and pupils 
of the value of a secondary education. Therefore, the drop¬ 
outs were asked a question in which they could express their

parents 1 and their own view of the value of a high school 
education. The views attributed to the parents were, of 
course, their attitudes as reported by the pupils. 

It is apparent from Table XI that the majority of 
the drop-outs did not result from lack of interest on the 
parents’ part. Almost three-quarters, or 72 per cent, of 
all the parents are reported as regarding high school very 
useful. Another 24 per cent of the parents thought a high 
school education was useful and valuable. Only 4 per cent 
of the parents impressed their children that secondary 
education had no particular use or value or had certain 
disadvantages. No parents said high school was a distinct 
waste of time and money.

4. Attitudes of Drop-outs Toward the Value 
of a High School Education 

The answers to the value of the high school education 
from the drop-outs themselves as recorded in Table XII cor¬ 
responded very closely to that of their parents. ?4 per 
cent of the drop-outs said that such an education was at 
least useful and valuable. Only 6 per cent said it had 
certain disadvantages. These are not specified here. 

5• summary 

In view of the above attitudes towards high school 
education, it cannot be stated that pupils* or parents* 
attitudes were factors in dropping out. In fact, the home 
and community are working to give children assistance Yfhere 
possible. The drop-outs also consider that the schools are 
successfully accomplishing their purpose inasmuch as they 
are training the pupils to meet people easily, to undertake 
and do new tasks and to get a broader outlook on life. 

In the opinion of the drop-outs the schools are not 
very successful in other fields, beventy-three per cent of 
the boys were especially concerned about the lack of train¬ 
ing they received for the vocation in which they are now 
engaged. In addition, the schools are neither giving the 
pupils enough training in the supervision of others, nor are 
they training for active participation in civic affairs. In

the fields of guidance and vocational training the teachers 
and other agencies of the schools are, at best, doing only a 
mediocre job. 

There were very few high school counselors in the 
schools. Very few other teachers were qualified to give 
competent assistance to pupils seeking occupational infor¬ 
mation. At the divisional level little was being done to 
assist pupils with vocational planning. In other words, 
the curriculum, the school staffs, and the divisional-level 
personnel seem to be failing to meet the demands of the 
present school population

CHAPTER VI 


A FOLLOW UP OF THE DROP-OUTS 

This chapter is devoted to a follow-up of the drop¬ 
outs in the sample. The length of time the drop-outs held 
their jobs, the income received, and the satisfaction de¬ 
rived from their jobs were studied. In addition, the drop¬ 
outs were asked to give their opinions on the adequacy of 
the high school program in preparing them for post school 
careers, and in helping them to do their work satisfactorily. 

1. Number of Jobs Held 

The number of jobs held by drop-outs was studied to 
determine whether they stayed with the occupation they chose 
or whether they soon lost interest and left. 

It is apparent from Table XIII that 92 per cent of the 
drop-outs have had three, or fewer than three jobs since 
leaving school. More than one-half of the sample, j?2 per 
cent, have remained with their first job while 22 per cent 
of the others are working at their second one. Over the 
period 1947 to 1920 only 7 per cent of the drop-outs have 
held four jobs or more. One boy and two girls, who have 
been attending technical or business schools, have not yet 
been employed. The occupations of the drop-outs range from 
farm laborers and cab drivers to sub-contractors, salesmen,

It may be concluded, therefore, that drop-outs can and 
do apply themselves to situations in which they are interes¬ 
ted. 


2. Drop-outs Classified into Occupational Groups 

The occupations of the drop-outs were classified to 
determine whether school leavers were more prevalent in some 

fields than in others. This classification was compared 
with that of the Canadian Research committee.^"

From Table XIV it may be observed that the primary 
industries claimed 2.8 per cent of the boys who left school. 
Trades and office jobs attracted 20 per cent and 12 per cent 
of the boys respectively. Another lj> per cent of the boys 
worked as laborers. Only 2 per cent of the boys were unem¬ 
ployed. 

More than one-third of the girls, 36 per cent, accep¬ 
ted office jobs, while another 20 per cent were employed in

the sales occupations. 31 per cent of the girls were in 
personal service occupations. Of the girls, 7 per cent 
were unemployed. 

The three occupational groups which claimed the majo¬ 
rity of the boys, 63 per cent, leaving school in the period 
from 1?47 to 1950 were the primary industries, trades, and 
labor groups. Most of the girls, 87 per cent, were absorbed 
by the office, sales, and personal service occupations. Gen¬ 
erally, the results obtained in this study compare closely 

with those obtained on a nation-wide scale by the Canadian 

2 

Research Committee. The differences are due mainly to re¬ 
gional variations in occupational opportunities. 

3. Type of Employment 

The jobs in which the drop-outs were engaged were 
classified under the various types of employment as given in 
Table XV. It was assumed that a pupil could be regarded as 
having sufficient reason for leaving school if he were going 
to own or manage a place of business. If, however, he were 
working for someone else, then factors other than the job 
itself were responsible for his leaving school. 

From Table XV it is apparent that only 3 per cent of 
the drop-outs owned or managed their own place of employment. 
Another 8 per cent of the drop-outs owned a part of the

of the school leavers worked for someone else. The boy clas¬ 
sified under n Other arrangements” was unemployed. Of the 
girls under the same classification twelve were married and 
three were unemployed. 

It may, therefore, be concluded that only a small 
minority of the drop-outs leave school to become an owner 
or manager of a place of business. The other drop-outs leave 
because of other factors.

tor in dropping out? Did the given incomes coincide with 
the type of occupation in which the drop-outs reported they 
were working? 

Every provision was made for the drop-outs to record 
incomes of various sizes. Since it was assumed that the 
majority of the drop-outs would he in unskilled and semi¬ 
skilled trades the intervals in the questionnaire were 
smaller in the lower brackets. This assumption proved to 
be correct.

thirds, 65 per cent, of the drop-outs received less than 
$1,500.00. The twelve girls listed under M Other arrange-

merits* 1 were married and dependent upon their husbands* 
incomes. 

The incomes received by the drop-outs were not exces¬ 
sive and are comparable with those of the "Grade XI and up" 
drop-outs in the Canadian Research Committee study.^ The 
average weekly wage earned in Southern Alberta was $2?.41 
for the boys, and $17*92 for the girls, as compared with the 
Canadian averages of $24.86 and $19.27 for boys and girls 
respectively. Since the incomes of the drop-outs in this 
study compare closely with those of the drop-outs for the 
whole of Canada, it may be maintained that there are very 
few well-paid jobs to which high school pupils may be attrac¬ 
ted, thereby causing them to leave school. Although the pro¬ 
bability that a drop-out would get a large income is small, 
the desire to earn money may be partially responsible for 
some pupils* leaving school. 

j?. Satisfaction with the^Present Job 

The drop-outs were asked to express their satisfaction 
or dissatisfaction with the job they had. The results were 
recorded in table XVII. 

Satisfaction, to some degree, was expressed by 88 per 
cent of the drop-outs. Of these, 4J? per cent were thoroughly 
satisfied and would not consider a change. However, a majority 


^Canadian Research Committee, 1948. p.j?2. 






- 60 - 


of the boys, 37 per cent, were looking for opportunities 
to obtain better jobs, although they were content with the 
jobs they had. 

It may therefore be said that generally the drop-outs 
were well adjusted in the world of work.

6. School Training for the Job 

The drop-outs were asked to state whether, in their 
opinion, high school education assisted them in attaining 
or performing their present jobs satisfactorily. 

From Table XVIII it may be observed that more than 
one-half, 36 per cent, of both the boys and the girls agreed 
that high school education did help in obtaining or holding 
their jobs. The reasons they gave are listed as follows:

(b) The commercial subjects helped. 

(c) The technical subjects were valuable. 

(d) High school taught them accuracy, neatness and organiza¬ 
tion of their work. 

(e) The high school training was considered by the employer 
when one applied for a job. 

(f) The study of vocations was useful in the working world. 

Approximately one-third of the drop-outs, 36 per cent, 
said that their high school training did not help. They 
gave no reasons.

It is apparent from the above discussion that only 
about one-quarter of the drop-outs attributed their success 
in their present jobs to any of the subjects they took in 
high school. The other quarter claimed that the education 
helped them generally. According to the drop-outs, there-

fore, those pupils who leave school before attaining a high 
school diploma are not educated sufficiently for the world 
of work. Their suggestions for changes in the curriculum 
are given in Chapter VII. 

7. Summary 

A very small number of drop-outs have attained the 
status of owners, managers or proiorietors. Most of the drop¬ 
outs were employees. The majority of the boys were employed 
in primary industries, trades and labour groups, while the 
girls worked in offices, sales and personal service occupa¬ 
tions. Although most of the drop-outs were in the low in¬ 
come groups, i.e. less than $1,500.00 per annum, they were 
satisfied with their vocational choices. 

They were, however, dissatisfied with their high school 
training and its relation to their present jobs. Approxi¬ 
mately one-half of the drop-outs said that high school edu¬ 
cation did not assist them in attaining or performing their 
jobs. Of all the drop-outs only about one quarter regarded 
some high school subjects as useful in their work. It may, 
therefore, be concluded that the present high school curri¬ 
culum is inadequate to meet the needs of the high school 
drop-outs.

CHAPTER VII 


SUGGESTIONS BY DROP-OUTS TO CURRICULUM BUILDERS 

This chapter is devoted mainly to changes in the 
schools suggested by the drop-outs* Among the topics dis¬ 
cussed are the length of the school year, and the minimum 
age and education required of a pupil. Other important 
issues considered by the drop-outs were changes in the in¬ 
structional procedures employed in the schools and modifi¬ 
cations in the present policy of granting the high school 
diploma* 

The drop-outs were asked to assume that they were just 
beginning high school now but with the knowledge they already 
possess, and were requested to specify the high school pro¬ 
gram they would follow. This question was designed to re¬ 
veal the effect of their post-school experience on their 
attitudes toward school, and to reveal the type of counsel¬ 
ing they are likely to give their brothers, sisters, and 
children. 


1. Length of the School Year 

The drop-outs were asked to discuss the length of the 
present school year and to recommend any necessary changes. 
Their arguments and recommendations were studied to ascer¬ 
tain if the present length of the school year is a factor

From Table XIX it is apparent that almost two-thirds 
or 64 per cent of the drop-outs consider the school year 
should be of the present ten months 1 duration. About one- 
quarter of the drop-outs recommended a school year of nine 
months. The reasons they gave for their suggestions are 
given below: 

(1) The extra month could be used for harvesting. 

(2) A considerable amount of time is wasted in June. 

Only 8 per cent of the drop-outs wanted a school year of 
less than nine months duration while another 3 per cent 
wanted it more than ten months long. Neither of these groups

gave reasons for their suggestions. 

There were no pupils who related the length of the school 
year with their financial difficulties, i.e., the fact that a 
shorter school term would assist in earning more money* Since 
a majority of the drop-outs are satisfied with the length of 
the school year, it cannot be considered as an important fac¬ 
tor in dropping out. 

2. Minimum Age and Educational Requirements 
for Drop-outs 

The present minimum requirements for drop-outs are 
Grade IX standing or attainment of fifteen years of age be¬ 
fore the commencement of any school term. The drop-outs 
were asked to state what they thought the minimum require¬ 
ments should be. Their results were tabulated in Table XX. 

Sixty-eight per cent of the drop-outs suggested that 
the minimum requirements should be a Grade X education, or 
the attainment of sixteen years of age. The statements 
classified under f, 0ther suggestions” are listed below: 

(a) At least Grade XI should be a minimum. 

(b) Pupils should remain at school until they have attained 

some vocational training which should be provided for 

1 

those not academically inclined. 

^Vocational training authorized by the Department of Educa¬ 
tion in fields such as stenography and mechanics, for which 
some type of diploma would be given.

It is apparent that at least 82 per cent consider the 
present minimum educational requirements too low. According 
to the recommendations of the majority of the drop-outs new 
departmental regulations should require either a Grade X 
education or sixteen years of age as the minimum requirement 
before dropping out is permitted, 

3* Changes.in the Granting of the High School Diploma 

The present high school diploma is granted after a 
pupil has successfully attained at least 100 high school 
credits of which: 

(a) 33 credits are in compulsory courses;

(b) at least 50 credits are in Grade XI and Grade XII 
courses; 

(c) at least 14 credits are in Grade XII courses; 

(d) at least 10 credits are in Group B, C, or D electives. 
The drop-outs were asked if the granting of the diploma 
should be modified.

From Table XXI it is apparent that a large majority 
of the drop-outs, 77 per cent, deem the present number of 
100 credits for a high school diploma as satisfactory. 

Some of the other recommendations are listed below. 

(a) The awarding of the diploma should be dependent on the 
pupil T s ability. 

(b) The program should be flexible, making it unnecessary 
to attend an additional year for three or four credits.

(c) A high school diploma should vary in content with the 
pupil T s vocational choice. 

Most of the drop-outs were satisfied with the present 
granting of the high school diploma after 100 high school 
credits. Others, however, recommended modifications to the 
present policy which future curriculum builders would do 
well to consider. 

4. Training and Instruction in the High Schools 

The drop-outs were asked to recommend changes in the 
kind of instruction offered in the high schools. Since no 
provision was unde for more than one kind of change, each 
drop-out chose the one he or she considered most important. 
The results were tabulated in Table XXII. 

From the table it may be observed that only 4 per cent 
of the drop-outs were satisfied with the present program. 

The largest single request, made by % per cent of the drop¬ 
outs, was for additional courses In fields like retail sales, 
mechanics, and the skilled trades. Another 20 per cent 
wanted some courses in planning one’s future. The courses 
recommended included vocational guidance, courses in person¬ 
ality and in understanding oneself. Twelve per cent of the 
drop-outs v^anted courses to prepare students as members of 
a family and as citizens. Courses requested here were home 
nursing, preparation for marriage, interior decorating,

studies in sex, religion, citizenship, home building, and 
courses in family and opposite sex relationships. Fifteen 
per cent of the drop-outs wanted additional courses in agri¬ 
culture and home economics. 

It has again been made apparent that one of the reasons 
for pupils leaving school is the present lack of courses in 
which the pupils are interested. With the exception of a 
very small minority, all the drop-outs request a wider 
variety of courses. Most of the courses recommended are 
valuable to pupils in their post-school careers.

5. What Drop-outs Would Do Now if They Were Just 
Beginning Their High School Careers 

The drop-outs were asked to state what they would do 
now, if they were just beginning high school and if they 
were as aware of their strengths and weaknesses as they are 
at present. They were requested to choose a course of 
action. Their choices are tabulated in Table 2X11I.

It was noted that 50 per cent of the drop-outs said 
they would enter the same high school as before, fifteen per 
cent would enter a different high school and another 1? per 
cent would take courses useful in university and college. 
Sixteen per cent of the drop-outs would take mostly options 
















- 71 - 


such as shop, home economics, law, and psychology. Of the 
one-fifth, 20 per cent, of the drop-outs who would go to 
some other type of school: 

(a) 10 would go to a technical school; 

(b) 6 would go to a commercial school; 

(c) 3 would go to a composite school; 

(d) 2 would go to an agriculture school. 

It should also be noted that not one person said he would 
not go to high school at all. This statement is in complete 
agreement with the drop-outs’ contention that a high school 

p 

education is both useful and valuable. 

From the above discussion it is apparent that even if 
they were beginning again, less than one-fifth of the drop¬ 
outs would take courses leading towards a university or col¬ 
lege education. On the other hand, most of them wanted a 
general high school education, with a few preferring a pro¬ 
gram comprised mostly of options. The above discussion 
again indicates the necessity for a diversified program in 
the schools. 

6. Summary 

A majority of the drop-outs agreed that the present 
ten month school year is satisfactory. They recommended 
that the minimum requirements for school leaving be raised

to sixteen years or a Grade X standing instead of the present 
fifteen years or a Grade IX standing. That they see merits 
in staying in school as long as possible is again verified 
by the fact that if they were now just beginning high school 
they would all come back. 

Now, however, with the experience they possess, the 
drop-outs would take courses that would qualify them more 
satisfactorily for their post-school careers. Only one- 
fifth of the drop-outs would take matriculation courses for 
university. The others would want courses in retail sales, 
mechanics, skilled trades, and vocational and social guidance. 
For these reasons the drop-outs request a wider variety of 
courses and more flexible requirements for the high school 
diploma.

CHAPTER VIII 


ELEMENTS OF STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS IN THE PRESENT PROGRAM 

This chapter is devoted to the comments made by drop¬ 
outs on the strengths and weaknesses of the present high 
school program. Its purpose was to discover where changes 
are necessary and what these changes should be. Although 
no suggestions were offered to indicate the topics to be 
discussed, the drop-outs expressed their opinions clearly. 

A majority of the drop-outs listed some strengths of 
the program and many of its weaknesses. Their statements 
were categorized, and recorded under various headings. The 
number of drop-outs expressing themselves on each of the 
major topics were tabulated in Tables XXIV and XXV. 

1. Elements of Strength in the Program 

The strengths of the high school program, as expressed 
by the drop-outs, are recorded in the following paragraphs. 
Their statements were arranged in point form and in order of 
the frequency in which the topic was discussed. Where several 
similar statements were given, only one was recorded. 

1. The Present Curriculum 

(a) The curriculum is an excellent preparation for university 
or college. 

(b) It gives a good foundation to the academically inclined.

(c) It is a good standard by which, to single out those pupils 
who will have a chance in any highly skilled profession. 

(d) It offers a good general education. 

(e) The M one hundred credit" system is valuable since those 
who cannot attain matriculation standards can acquire a 
high school diploma. 

(f) Technical and commercial subjects, where available, are 
very valuable to some pupils. 

2. The Large High Schools 

(a) Large high schools offer the pupils a wide variety of 
courses to choose from.

presented in order of the frequency in which they were 

listed. 

1. The High School Teachers 

(a) Teacher training is poor. Many are rushed through one or 
two years of university and become teachers. 

(b) Teachers should take refresher courses, since some do not 
know their work well enough. 

(c) Some have the educational requirements but do not have 
the ability to transmit the information. 

(d) Some do not explain assignments clearly and reprimand 
pupils for resulting poor work. 

(e) Teachers do not encourage pupils to study. 

(f) They should give pupils more individual help. 

(gj They should not try to cover too much material in one 

class period. Instead they should take more time during 
classes to explain the new work. 

(h) Some do not care if homework is done. 

(i) Some teachers are sarcastic. 

(j) Some cannot control their tempers; others are comedians. 

(k) Some show favoritism toward the good students. 

(l) Some teachers purposefully give the pupil the impression 
that he will fail, in the hope that he will drop-out. 

(m) Some cannot hold class attention. 

(n) Teachers should be stronger disciplinarians and demand 
more respect. 

























V ■ 

.

- 78 - 


(o) They should try to develop pupil respect out of school 
by dressing and behaving properly in public. 

(p) They should be relieved of their position when they 
have to resort to meanness and sarcasm. 

2. Suggested Curriculum Changes 

(a) Ancient history should be dropped and more emphasis 
placed on news and current affairs. 

(b) All pupils should be required to take some high school 
mathematics. 

(c) The English courses should be more practical with more 
emphasis on grammar and spelling. 

(d) Latin should be dropped. 

(e) There should be no compulsory subjects. 

Inadequacies of the Present Curriculum 

(a) The present high school curriculum disregards pupils 
who want to be tradesmen, fanners, or technicians. 

(b) A wider variety of courses should be taught. Some of 
these should be in agriculture, carpentry, masonry, and 
similar trades. 

(e) More courses should be offered in the technical and 
commercial fields. 

(d) A basic course in sex education is a necessity. 

(e) More practical courses should be offered, including 
practical mathematics and English courses.

(f) The variety of optional courses should be extended. 

4. Vocational Training 

(a) More vocational training and guidance is necessary to 
help pupils make their plans for the future. 

(b) Some qualified teacher should act as a consultant, 
advising pupils on the furtherance of their educational 
interests. 

(c) Pupils should be given aptitude tests and advised 
accordingly. 

(d) Pupils should be steered into correct channels, e.g., 
the matriculation, commercial, or technical fields. 

(e) Pupils should be encouraged to choose a career while in 
high school, and should have a counselor to advise them 
in this. 

(f) Teachers should help each pupil to plan and choose his 
courses wisely, and then encourage him as he proceeds 
with his school program. 

(g) Teachers should be willing to discuss pupils 1 problems 
with them. 

j>. The Small High Schools 

(a) The small high schools offer the pupils little variety 
in courses toward a high school diploma. 

(b) They do not offer any facilities to those pupils who are 
not academically inclined. 




- 8o - 


(c) Teachers in such schools have inferior knowledge and 
little experience. In addition, they have to teach too 
many subjects. 

(d) All small high schools should offer the same courses in 
order to facilitate the transfer of pupils from one such 
school to another. 

6 . Specialization 

(a) Not enough flexibility in the choice of courses is 
permitted. 

(b) Too much unnecessary material must be taken in order 
to graduate. 

(c) Pupils should be permitted to specialize in some fields. 

7. Extra-curricular Activities 

(a) The schools should offer more extra-curricuLar activities. 

(b) Every school should have an auditorium. 

8 . Homework. 

(a) Too much homework is assigned in the high schools. 

Extra facilities in the Schools 

(a) A large library is necessary in each school. 

(b) Some of the equipment required by commercial students is 
so expensive that individual pupils cannot afford it. 

It should, therefore, be supplied by the schools.

10. Enrolment in the School 

(a) The schools are overcrowded. 

(b) There are too many pupils per teacher. Unless more 
teachers become available, proper coverage of work will 
result only if class periods are lengthened and the school 
day extended from ?:00 a.m. to .5:00 p.m. 

11. Financial Difficulties 

(a) Pupils who have to leave school because of financial 
difficulties should be assisted. 

12. Others 

(a) Long van trips tire pupils unduly. 

(b) Dividing classes into hard and fast ability groups is very 
hard on the pupils. 

3 * Summary 

The outstanding feature of the present high school cur¬ 
riculum, according to the drop-outs, is that it offers an 
excellent preparation for university or college. The drop¬ 
outs also appreciated the technical and commercial courses 
taught in the larger schools. These large schools had, in 
addition to the wide variety of subjects, teachers who were 
specialists in their fields. The drop-outs also admired and 
appreciated the efficient, well-trained teachers, and all 
those who tried to help them with their difficulties.

The weaknesses in the high school program included 
primarily the teachers who were insufficiently trained, sar¬ 
castic or prejudiced. Some of these assigned homework but 
did not check it, nor did they offer individual help. 

About 20 per cent of the drop-outs recommended, as a 
necessary alteration, the dropping of ancient history and 
the substitution of more contemporary affairs. Other recom¬ 
mendations of note were more practical courses in English, 
mathematics, and at least one basic course in sex education. 

The drop-outs stated that the present curriculum dis¬ 
regarded those pupils who wanted to become tradesmen, far¬ 
mers, or technicians. Therefore, they requested courses 
in agriculture, construction, and more courses in technical 
and commercial electives. 

Many of the drop-outs suggested that the high schools 
should offer more vocational training courses. They recom¬ 
mended that qualified teachers be employed to give interest 
and aptitude tests, advise the pupils of t heir capabilities, 
and then help them plan their futures by steering them into 
the correct vocational channels. 

The number and diversity of the weaknesses suggest 
that many improvements must be made before the rate of 
dropping out can be expected to decline. 





CHAPTER IX 


PERSONAL INTERVIEWS WITH DROP-OUTS 

The purpose of this study of ten boys and ten girls 
was to gather a deeper insight into the high school experi¬ 
ences of drop-outs. Although the interviews were structured, 
each drop-out was permitted to discuss any desired topic at 
length. The drop-outs criticized the present system of edu¬ 
cation and recommended changes which would benefit a large 
percentage of the student body. The discussions extended 
into various fields of educational endeavour and are sum¬ 
marized under the topics which follow. As in the preceding 
chapter, when several similar statements were given, only 
one was recorded. 

1. Values of a High School Education 

All of the drop-outs interviewed agreed that a high 
school education was useful and valuable. Some of the 
reasons they gave are listed below. 

(a) High school is generally valuable in teaching accuracy, 
arrangement, neatness, and in attaining speed in cal¬ 
culation. 

(b) Mathematical training helps one obtain and hold a good 
job. It also helps in calculating business deals. 

(c) A high school education gives pupils a better under-

standing of jobs and people. 

(d) If the educational level of the country is to increase, 
Grade X standing and sixteen years of age should be made 
the minimum requirements for leaving school. 

2. Colleges 

Most of the interviewees were in favor of colleges. 
Several would have considered going to a college had there 
been one in the vicinity. Local colleges, they said, would 
be a stimulus to work. If the colleges were available, 
without incurring any additional expenses to the pupils and 
their parents, the standard of education would go up. 

As other incentives to work some drop-outs suggested 
that there should be a counselor at each school to direct 
the pupils into the proper channels. Some others suggested 
that the colleges should offer scholarships. 

The drop-outs recommended that the entrance require¬ 
ments to the colleges or other institutions of advanced 
training should be a junior matriculation or seventy credits. 
These institutions should offer a diversified curriculum where 
one could study agriculture, mechanics, and other skilled 
trades. On graduation each pupil should receive a college 
or institute certificate to assist him in qualifying for a 
job.

3. Elements of strength in the Present High School 

The interviewees were requested to indicate the ele¬ 
ments of strength in the present program, First of all, 
they were of the opinion that the program is an excellent 
preparation for college or university. Second, they ap¬ 
proved of the varied curriculum offered by the larger high 
schools since it seemed to meet the needs of non-academic 
as well as of the more academic pupils. Third, they felt 
that the students 1 union offers good training for those who 
are prepared to take advantage of the opportunities which 
it provides. In addition some of the drop-outs expressed 
their appreciation of the more recently introduced techni¬ 
cal and commercial subjects. 

4. Weaknesses of the Present High School Program 

The chief weakness appears to be the limited curriculum. 
Pupils are not permitted to specialize in high school. Be¬ 
cause of a lack of electives they have to take academic 
sciences and mathematics instead of the technical and commer¬ 
cial courses they desire. Even when it is possible to take 
commercial courses, pupils are not permitted to take more 
than three such courses in any one year. 

Some of the drop-outs consulted saw little purpose in 
retaining courses like Latin and ancient history. On the 
other hand they felt the lack of debating, and speech and

voice training. Pupils also want more courses to assist 
them in planning their future occupations. 

The homework must also be done out of school since 
lectures seem to take up all the class periods. 

Pupils in their adolescence like to be independent. 
They should be given more opportunities to be leaders, as 
well as followers. High school pupils should be taught to 
accept responsibility. 


5. Courses 

A large number of interviewees thought that ancient 
history was of little or no value to technical or commercial 
students. It was conceded that the course may be useful and 
necessary to those who choose to go to university. However, 
it was felt that planning their future would be of greater 
importance to the pupils. They wanted, therefore, more 
courses in vocational training, and more guidance and counsel. 
A further recommendation was to divide the vocational training 
into two classes, by sexes, in order that the narrower fields 
would be more thoroughly covered. 

Some of the other courses recommended were in commer¬ 
cial, technical and agricultural fields, in retail sales, 
mechanics and in other skilled trades. The courses, they 
said, should not be too extensive, should be practical, and 
should be considered by employers when a pupil applies for 







- 87 - 


a job. If the latter is not the case, pupils lose valuable 
time and money in repeating the courses for credit in tech¬ 
nical schools. 

Some of the drop-outs recommended also that there should 
be a large variety of courses, a freedom of choice, and no 
compulsory subjects. 

6. Counseling 

All the drop-outs interviewed were emphatic in their 
demand for more and better qualified counselors. It was the 
general opinion that most pupils would use a counselor if 
they had one to go to. The reasons they gave for having a 
counselor present in the schools are given below. 

(1) A counselor would be very useful in advising the pupils 
on their choice of a high school program. With his help 
pupils would take courses they like, and would not lose 
interest and leave school. 

(2) A counselor would be available to discuss pupil diffi¬ 
culties in any course. Pupils who air their difficul¬ 
ties are not likely to quit school as readily. They 
would see the counselor before making any major decisions. 

(3) The counselor would assist the pupils in arranging their 
courses in keeping with their interests and aptitudes. 

(4) The counselor would discuss the courses and timetables 
of universities and colleges, the available occupational 





- 88 - 


or professional fields, the year’s activities, and other 
pertinent information. Without a counselor’s help stu¬ 
dents enter the schools of higher learning with little 
or no idea of the available fields, courses, or the type 
of work expected of them. 

Drop outs were also asked to suggest means of improving 

the counseling of pupils. Their suggestions are listed 

below. 

(1) The counselor should be an understanding teacher who can 
use his full time to talk to pupils about their problems 
and then help the pupils solve than. Such a counseling 
technique would, in itself, cause many pupils to finish 
high school. 

(2) The work of a counselor should be widely publicized in 
the school. At present most pupils don’t know what he 
is trying to do. 

(3) He should be accessible to all pupils. 

(4) More pupils would go to see the counselor if they felt 
that he was genuinely trying to help them. The coun¬ 
selor’s effectiveness would Increase as he became better 
acquainted with the pupils and gained their confidence. 

(5) Counseling should be explained to pupils in detail. 

(6) Pupils should be made to realize that high school is the 
most important time in their lives since it is then that 
they mold their futures. Anyone who looks ahead will not

be wasting time later in life. Pupils should also be 
made to realize how valuable education is and what its 
effects are on one’s happiness and future success. 

(7) A counselor should have free periods during the day so 
that all the pupils could come to see him at least a 
few times a year. 

(8) To be effective a counselor must have more power and 
jurisdiction in the school. 

(?) He should have some training in counseling and vocation¬ 
al guidance. 

(10) He should teach a vocations and guidance course to assist 
individual pupils in planning their courses. 

(11) He should find opportunities for pupils to work part 
time in vocations of their choice in order that they 
might determine their liking and aptitude for them. 

7. Teachers 

More than one-half, 55 per cent, of the interviewees, 
gave poor teachers as one of their three reasons for leaving 
school. It may, therefore, be ejected that the teachers 
would come under considerable criticism. The comments on 
the teachers are listed below. 

(1) Teachers are individuals trying to get a job done as 
best they can. Some try to help the pupils to pass with 
the best possible marks. 

(2) When a teacher likes a subject, he makes it interesting, 















<

,

. 






. 


. 







and consequently more easily assimilated by pupils. 

(3) Some teachers try to assist pupils any way they can. 

(4) The pupils like teachers who respect their views and 
attitudes and who admit mistakes when they occur. 

The reasons why drop-outs disliked some teachers are 

given below in order of frequency. 

(1) Some teachers lack enthusiasm and interest in the courses 
they teach. 

(2) Certain teachers are sarcastic. Some of these pick on 
particular pupils day after day. Pupils get the idea 
that the teacher has it in for them, become discouraged, 
and leave school when it is obvious they will not pass. 

(3) Teachers work only with the pupils who apply themselves; 
the others are permitted to fall by the wayside. 

(4) Some of the teachers give the impression that their word 
is law and their statements above reproach. Thus they 
prejudice the student against the teacher and the sub¬ 
jects taught. 

(3) Some give too much homework. Pupils have to choose be¬ 
tween doing the homework in one course or work on all 
the others. Later, because of the large amount of un¬ 
finished work, they don’t try to catch up but lose 
interest in the course and drop it or quit school. 

(6) Some teachers favor and give more assistance to the 
pupils who do good work than to those who don’t work

and need more help. 

(7) Some teachers set a bad example in and out of school. 

(8) Students are constantly taught to respect the teachers. 
Reciprocally pupils should also rate individual res¬ 
pect and patience. 

(9) High School teachers should be stronger disciplinarians. 
Study periods, as a rule, were very poorly supervised. 

(10) Pupils should be made to feel they are doing the work 
for themselves. 

8. Pupils 

After the discussions on teachers, the drop-outs were 
asked if any of the pupils created any problems while at 
school. The resulting statements are listed below. 

(1) Some pupils did not show the proper attitude toward the 
teachers. They tried to do as they pleased and caused 
many minor restrictions to be placed on all pupils 1 
actions around the school. If these pupils did anything 
wrong they would not admit it, thereby causing others to 
get into trouble. 

(2) Some pupils carried on in such a manner as to disturb 
classes and annoy other pupils until the latter also 
lost interest in classes and disliked school. High 
schools should, therefore, insist on more positive dis¬ 
cipline.

( 3 ) Some pupils did not like to take compulsory subjects 
even if they were valuable. They became discouraged and 
worked only for partial credits. Others worked in com¬ 
pulsory subjects only to get a high school diploma. 

(4) Pupils must be given more incentive to work. This may 
be accomplished by permitting the pupils to specialize 
in high schools. If they like a subject they will learn 
it. Pupils always try hardest in their best subjects. 
They also put forth more effort if they like the teacher 
who teaches the subject. 

(5) Pupils like the sportsminded teachers. They also res¬ 
pect those teachers who respect the pupils 1 views and 
attitudes. 

(6) Pupils dislike teachers who use sarcasm, those who assign 
a large amount of homework, and those who are easily dis¬ 
tracted and led off the subject. 

9. Work Habits 

The drop-outs were asked to describe their work habits 
while at school and to give reasons for the type of work 
done. Their answers were categorized into five major divi¬ 
sions and are listed below from best to worst. 

(1) Three drop-outs had good study habits. They tried hard 
•and always had their homework done. 

(2) Pour of the interviewees liked to study but could have

done more. One of these preferred to work at school 
rather than at home. 

(3) Three said that their study habits were not very good. 
One said he lacked incentive as he had no opportunity to 
get a wider conception of the competition in the working 
world. 

(4) Three tried but did not know how to study. These recom¬ 
mended that the pupils be taught how to study in high 
school and that the lesson should be repeated frequently 

(3) Seven drop-outs had poor study habits. One remarked 
that the teachers said her study habits were poor but 
did not recommend any better ones. Others had poor 
study habits because they didn T t think it mattered. One 
said that study periods were rest periods since they 
were improperly supervised. Finally, one pupil remarked 
that some pupils with high ability didn ! t work and set a 
poor example which caused the class attitude to deterio¬ 
rate. 

10. Facilities 

According to the drop-outs the facilities of the high 
schools were inadequate and overtaxed. They considered 
libraries incomplete and shops poorly equipped. In addition 
they strongly recommended small classes in shop courses to 
permit close supervision and individual attention. They

insisted on strict discipline in the technical courses since 
pupils could easily be hurt if not carefully watched. 

Some drop-outs suggested that the school grounds 
should be kept tidy and trim. Another suggested that the 
teachers be required to take an interest in extra-curricular 
activities. 


11. Graduation From School 

As a rule, drop-outs agreed that high school graduation 
should be the goal of most pupils. Graduation should not be 
permitted in any fewer than the three years necessary now. A 
pupil should feel that it is to his advantage to profit from 
his high school experience. He should accumulate a large 
amount of knowledge before graduation. If the high school 
program were accelerated only the most capable students would 
graduate; the others would get frustrated and drop out. It 
was suggested that a pupil should mature in high school and 
the three years necessary now are a brief enough period of 
time. 

On the other hand, the drop-outs suggested that no 
pupil should be expected to go to high school for more than 
four years. The interviewees suggested that different pat¬ 
terns should require a different number of credits for 
graduation. The examples recommended that a matriculation 
diploma may require 100 credits, whereas a commercial or

pare favorably with the results found in the questionnaire

education for a job stands out most clearly in the minds of 
most of the drop-outs. The classification of their reasons 
is summarized in Table XXVI. 

13. Reasons for Leaving High School 

The reasons for leaving school were categorized as 
were the reasons for going. 

The results of this study, also, compare favorably

with those of the questionnaire study. The summary of the 
reasons for leaving is given in Table XXVII. 

Most interviewees left to take, or look for, a job. 
However, more than one-lialf, 55 per cent, of the drop-outs 
left because of poor teachers. They stated that the chief 
faults of teachers were the excessive use of sarcasm and 
the large number of petty rules they formulated and haphaz¬ 
ardly enforced. 

14. Long Range Plans 

When asked what they, the drop-outs, would do now, if 
they were only beginning high school, most of them said that 
they would go to a large school and specialize. Some said

lj>* The Questionnaire 

Although most of the interviewed drop-outs were also 
included in the original sample to whom the questionnaires 
were sent, only a few of the latter were returned. During 
the interviews they were all asked to give reasons why drop¬ 
outs would or would not answer the questionnaires. 

The purpose of this questioning was to gain an insight 
into the reluctance on the part of a majority of the original 
drop-out sample to answer the questionnaire, and to record 
the reasons in order to prevent similar errors from being 
made in subsequent studies. The examiner also wanted an 
expression of opinion from the drop-outs who did answer the 
questionnaires. 

Some of the reasons given for not answering the 
questionnaires are listed below. 

(1) Some drop-outs felt that a few of the questions were too 
personal and were not sure that the answers would be 
kept confidential. 

(2) Some may have been introverts, and did not care to dis¬ 
cuss their ideas or express their opinions. 

(3) Others may have been antagonistic toward the school, and 
would have nothing to do with the school or teachers.

(4) Some may have been too busy. 

Those who did answer the questionnaires took a very 
constructive attitude toward the study. Their reasons are 
listed below. 

(1) Some of the drop-outs realized that they did not get 
much out of the present school curriculum. They thought 
that their comments might be considered by curriculum 
builders and thereby improve the school plant for others. 

(2) Several drop-outs remarked that if too many let the in¬ 
vestigator down, no one would know the reactions of the 
drop-outs to their school curriculum and no modifica¬ 
tions to the program would follow. However, if many did 
answer, and their comments and suggestions v/ere brought 
to light, then perhaps something would be done about it. 

(3) Some thought that if more drop-outs answered the ques¬ 
tionnaires and were concerned about the wide rift be¬ 
tween teachers and pupils, the haphazard way In which 
pupils choose their courses, and the lack of available 
vocational information, then more counselors would be 
employed. The pupils, then, would each have direct 
contact with a teacher qualified to give vocational 
guidance and counsel, and the result would be fewer 
drop-outs among high school students. 

(4) Other drop-outs said it looked like a worthwhile project 
and could see no harm in assisting in the research.

(3) A few said they wanted to help iron out some of the 
present school difficulties. 

(6) One drop-out commented that if the investigator went to 
the trouble of sending the questionnaire to find out 
what her high school difficulties were, she thought that 
she should do her part and answer it. 

(7) Most of the interviewees stated that they wanted to help 
more pupils to attain their goals. This, they said, 
would be possible if some of their recommended changes 
were heeded and put into practice. 

6. Summary 

The drop-outs interviewed were very cooperative and 
expressed themselves freely and fully. They thought that 
high school education was both useful and valuable, and said 
that if they had the chance now, they would each try to ob¬ 
tain a high school diploma. At this point they stressed 
again that the present curriculum, being highly academic, 
did not meet the needs of the majority, as only a small 
percentage of pupils wanted to go to a university or col¬ 
lege. Drop-outs also commented that discipline was lacking 
in the high schools, and that there was little incentive on 
the part of pupils to accept responsibility. 

They recommended more and better qualified counselors 
to help pupils when difficulties arise, especially when they

must plan or choose their courses or before they make other 
major decisions. Counseling, they said, could be improved 
by using understanding teachers who could gain the confidence 
of pupils. Vocational guidance and counsel should be more 
widely publicized. Pupils should be made to realize that 
the high school age is the one in which they mold their 
futures. 

Teachers were considered by most drop-outs as indivi¬ 
duals who were trying to do a job as well as they could. 
Teachers who liked their subjects made them interesting, 
explained their work carefully, and helped pupils in every 
way they could. Drop-outs disliked teachers who lacked 
enthusiasm, interest, and did not know their courses well 
enough. They disliked especially those who used sarcasm 
and those who showed partiality. 

They also disliked those whose word was always above 
reproach. In addition, drop-outs also disliked the pupils 
who annoyed other pupils during classes, those who did not 
work, and those who necessitated the making of many minor 
rules. 

Drop-outs were very concerned about the large number 
of pupils who did not know how to study and were never taught 
how to do so. They recommended that teachers should teach 
and often reteach study methods for various courses. 

Most of the interviewees commented that the present 




102 


facilities of the schools were inadequate, and that the 
schools, themselves, were overcrowded. They said that the 
technical and commercial courses were offered to large 
classes where individual attention was almost impossible 
and discipline could not be maintained. 

The drop-outs thought that the 100 credit regulation 
was a good one but suggested that it be relaxed slightly for 
the non-academic students. In order that a pupil may mature 
sufficiently to take his place in the world, they believe 
that three years of high school training are desirable. 

Drop-outs said they went to school because it trained 
them for a job or because they liked to go.. They left to 
take or look for a job, when they could not get along with 
the teachers, were not getting the courses they wanted, or 
found that their courses were unrelated to their vocational 
plans. They now have well-planned vocational goals toward 
which they are carefully working. 

Some of the drop-outs did not complete the question¬ 
naires because they were not sure that their answers would 
be kept confidential. Others were too busy, or did not care 
to discuss their opinions. Those who did answer did so in 
the hope that their recommendations might be considered and 
put into practice. They suggested that more qualified 
counselors be employed in vocational guidance to correlate 
pupils T courses with their vocational plans, and that the 
present curriculum be modified to hold the interest of more

pupils until they graduate with a high school diploma. 




CHAPTER X 


FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

This study of Grade XI and Grade XII drop-outs was 
carried out in Southern Alberta between the years 1947 and 
1951. About one-fifth of all the drop-outs answered the 
questionnaire which was sent to them. The findings and 
recommendations given hereinafter are based on the atti¬ 
tudes of these drop-outs towards their teachers, the cur¬ 
riculum, the guidance received at school, the schools, 
whether large or snail, and further education. 

The drop-outs who did answer the questionnaire did so 
with the intention of assisting in the removal of some of 
the present school difficulties. They earnestly offered 
recommendations trusting that some of these would be put 
into practice to aid future high school pupils in gaining 
a more satisfactory education. 

From the questionnaire it was found that the drop¬ 
outs were employed in many occupations. These were clas¬ 
sified to offer an analysis of the occupations of drop-outs. 
The boys were employed mainly as farmers, miners, or labo¬ 
rers; the girls as office workers, or sales ladies. The 
boys* average weekly wage was $29.41, while the girls* wage 
was $17*92. 

Very few drop-outs, 11 per cent, left school to own or

manage a place of business. The others left for scholastic, 
economic, or personal reasons. Although most of the drop¬ 
outs were fairly well satisfied in their occupations 7 about 
57 per cent of the boys were still looking for opportunities 
to obtain better jobs. 

1# Values of a High school Education 

The four main reasons given by drop-outs for attending 
school as long as they did, were that high school trained 
them for jobs, they liked to go, it was the natural thing to 
do after Grade IX, and their parents insisted that they go. 
While at school they participated in athletics, music, dra¬ 
matics and other extra-curricular activities* 

The drop-outs stated that the schools trained them to 
meet people easily, to undertake and do new tasks, and gave 
them a broader outlook on Life. They added that high school 
taught them accuracy, neatness, and organization of work, and 
speed in calculation. It also gave them a better understan¬ 
ding of jobs and people. Most of the drop-outs went to 
school primarily because an education is necessary before 
one can secure a good job. They said that employers con¬ 
sidered an applicant’s education before hiring him. 

Drop-outs left school to look for jobs when they v/ere 
not getting the courses they wanted, were attaining poor 
grades in their subjects, or were taking courses which were 









. ... '

unrelated to their vocational plans. Three-quarters of 
the drop-outs changed their vocational plans while in high 
school. The changes were all from matriculation courses 
to technical or commercial courses. In these fields there 
was a shortage of courses; therefore they left school. More 
than one-third of the entire sample considered the training 
they received in high school inadequate to meet the demands 
of their present vocations. 

The drop-outs also stated that high school does not 
offer enough training in supervision or in directing the 
activities of others, and does not lay enough stress on 
participation in civic affairs. It may be concluded that 
the present curriculum is inadequate to meet the needs of 
the pupils who leave school to go into the world of work. 

Rec ommenda t i ons 

1. Foster the pupils' ideas that high school has a good 
atmosphere, that education is worth while, and that the 
pupil should always strive to better himself. 

2. The minimum drop-out requirements should be a Grade X 
education or sixteen years of age. 

3. High school pupils should be frequently reminded that 
there are more occupational opportunities for pupils who 
graduate with a high school diploma. 

4. Since, on leaving school, a pupil usually leaves the 
dependency of the home, his education should include a

preparation for the working world. The high school pro¬ 
gram should be such that a pupil can receive some training 
for the vocation in which he is interested, 
j?. Since industries and trades accept most of the school 
population* the schools should prepare their students 
more effectively for these occupations. 

6. High school education should prepare a student for every¬ 
day living. 

2. Teachers 

Almost one-third of the drop-outs placed some respon¬ 
sibility for their leaving school on the teachers. The drop¬ 
outs did appreciate the efficient, well-trained teachers who 
were friendly and helpful. They also respected those who 
tried to make their teaching effective by making their sub¬ 
jects interesting and by explaining their courses fully. The 
drop-outs, however, did not like the poorly trained teachers, 
those who lacked enthusiasm in teaching, and those who showed 
little interest in their courses. Furthermore, they did not 
like those who were sarcastic, poor disciplinarians, and 
those who gave too much homework. 

Drop-outs also complained about their own poor study 
habits. Less than half worked or liked to work. Many did 
not know how to study and were never taught to do so.

Re c omme nd at i ons 

1. Pupils should be taught, and frequently retaught, how to 
study. 

2. More effective disciplinary methods are necessary. 

3* All pupils need to experience success and recognition for 
the work they do, if they are to develop a liking for 
school. 

4. Teachers should believe in the integrity and importance 
of each pupil. 

5. Longer periods of training and better methods of selecting 
teachers are necessary to improve the efficiency of the 
teaching profession. 

3* The Curriculum 

It has frequently been said that the present curriculum 
is an excellent preparation for university or college, yet 
only 20 per cent of the pupils who graduate want to go on to 
higher learning institutions. The others want to go to work. 
The academic curriculum under which these students were 
trained did not, apparently, meet the needs of the majority 
of the pupils. It is this lack of practical courses that 
causes many pupils, who might otherwise have remained in 
high school, to drop out. The drop-outs chose mathematics, 
physics, social studies, industrial arts, and commercial 
subjects as the favorite courses in the present curriculum.

Recommendations 

1# A revision of the curriculum is necessary to provide a 
more diverse program in the high school where the abil¬ 
ity and aptitude of the pupils have become increasingly 
varied. Only when these are the bases of the curriculum 
can the interests of pupils be maintained. 

2. After a minimum of general education in high school, pu¬ 
pils should be permitted to specialize so that a high 
school education may lead either to employment or to 
further study. 

3. Schools should offer courses incorporating local interests. 

4. Some type of mathematics should be required of all high 
school students. 

3. English courses should be more practical. They should 
include more grammar, spelling, and remedial reading. 

6. More emphasis should be placed on news and current 
affairs and less on ancient history. 

7. A good course in sex education should be offered. 

8. Courses ^aould be offered for citizenship training and 
should include such topics as civics, debating, politi¬ 
cal study, and family living. 

9. several courses in vocational guidance should be included 
in the high school curriculum. 

10. Rxtra-curricular activities are necessary for the whole¬ 
some development of paapils and should be a part of the 
























or

no 


high school program. 

11. Schools should recognize the worth of all types of 
courses. The academic course should not be considered 
more important than the specialized education for 
business or the trades. 

12. Additional courses are required in retail sales, 
mechanics, skilled trades, agriculture, and home 
economics. 

13. General exploratory courses should precede and be pre¬ 
requisite to the specialized ones, such a procedure 
would, offer pupils more opportunity to decide on the 
area of specialization. 

14. High schools should arrange opportunities for those 
pupils who want to work part time. 

15. A semester plan would help farm pupils. 

4. The Large and Small High Schools 
The large high schools offer a wider variety of courses 
than do the smaller ones. In the latter, the individual 
teacher must teach too many subjects and usually has less 
experience than do the teachers in larger centres. The van¬ 
ning of students to larger high schools overcomes these dif¬ 
ficulties to some extent. It also gives both the rural and 
urban pupils the same educational opportunities and the same 
wide vocational choice. It does, however, create other

Ill 


serious problems. The vanning of pupils and the recent in¬ 
crease in the high school population have caused the schools 
to become overcrowded and made the facilities inadequate and 
overtaxed. 

Recommendations 

1. Pupils should be vanned to larger centres to increase the 
variety of courses from which they may choose. 

2. These larger centralized schools should be equipped with 
adequate facilities and specialized teachers. 

3. Expensive equipment should not be expected of individual 
pupils. Adequate equipment should be provided by the 
schools. 

4. The costs to pupils should be minimized, and needy pupils 
should be assisted to secure part time employment. 

3. Guidance 

The home and the community are doing a good job of 
helping the pupils to plan their futures. The assistance 
they can give, hoY^ever, is limited and often insufficient 
to meet the needs of the pupils. The schools must also 
offer some vocational advice. This assistance has been 
badly neglected. Many of the drop-outs, having received 
little or no guidance, left school with the idea that they 
could receive the necessary vocational information by prac¬ 
tical experience.

The main reason for this inadequacy of counseling is 
the lack of qualified personnel to do the required guidance 
work. In addition, there are very few supervisors employed 
at the divisional level who can assist pupils and teachers 
in this field. Guidance must be improved from its present 
passive state to a real, active program within the schools. 
The dividends of the well-trained, hard working counselors 
will be larger numbers of pupils better adjusted to the 
world of work. 

Recommendations 

1. A counselor must have the time and place to give adequate 
counseling service. He must have administrative support, 
staff cooperation, and community understanding. 

2. A counselor must be specially trained" to give tests of 
aptitude, interest, and ability, and to use the informa¬ 
tion so derived in counseling situations. 

2. He must be able to provide educational assistance and 
vocational information to pupils who require or request 
it. 

4. A counselor should correlate pupil f s courses with their 
vocational plans. Then he should assist and coordinate 
all the efforts of every pupil as they progress through 
school. 

5. A counselor must treat all interviewees as conversational 
equals. Counseling should be voluntary and values must

be confidentially disregarded to assist in self- 
perception. 

6. Counselors should be teachers of vocational guidance 
courses. 

7. Counseling should include finding part time employment 
for pupils in their chosen vocation. It should also 
include job placement on graduation. 

8. A counselor should arrange career nights and visits to 
industries. 

9. He should assist with in-service training of the school 
staff. 

10. Guidance supervisors at the divisional level are neces¬ 
sary to assist teachers with in-service training and 
with testing programs when the teachers lack the neces¬ 
sary qualifications. 

11. Guidance and counseling should be widely publicized in 
the school and community. 

12. Authority and permissiveness are incompatible and must 
stand apart. The administrator is not usually the best 
counselor, nor the counselor the best administrator. 

6. iTurther Training 

The boys who dropped out are presently planning to 
become owners or managers of businesses, while the girls are 
planning to work and eventually to marry. All concluded

that their goals were satisfactory to them. The majority 
stated, however, that they would have worked harder and 
continued in school had they had a local college to attend 
on graduation. 

Recommend at i ons 

1. More colleges or institutes offering diversified vocational 
training should be established at or near the larger high 
school centres. These colleges would offer the non-academic 
students an opportunity to continue their education and 
training beyond the high school level. 

2. Such colleges should offer scholarships or grants to those 
who wish to go on but who cannot do so on their own re¬ 
sources. 

3. The colleges could offer night classes for those who had 
to work during the day* 

4. College entrance requirements should be at least seventy 
high school credits. 

7* Conclusion 

Educational theories are constantly being modified and 
altered to meet the changing demands of industry, labor, and 
institutions for further training. The curriculum must also 
be revised, and the school facilities improved and extended. 
These necessary changes, however, are hampered by difficul¬ 
ties in curriculum building and by insufficient financial

assistance to education, in the meantime the unsuitable 
curriculum and the inadequate facilities in the schools 
continue to cause pupils to drop out of school with insuf¬ 
ficient training or experience to be readily effective in 
the world of work or in society generally. 

Re commendations 

1. More money should be allotted to education. 

2. Increased retention of pupils could be attained by wide¬ 
ning the curriculum and improving school facilities. 

5* Pupils should be guided into those programs which are 
suited to their abilities, aptitudes, and interests, by 
teachers specially trained in testing and counseling 
techniques. 

4. xhe schools should endeavour to make the pupils realize 
that employment and advancement in the world of work are 
very limited for those who have not attained a high school 
diploma. 


Recommendations to future Investigators 
Some valuable information could be obtained in future 
studies of this nature if the following suggestions were 
considered. 

1. Compare the intelligence quotients of the Grade XII drop¬ 
outs with those of graduates. 

2. Compare the number of drop-outs who change their vocational

Dear 


I prepared this questionnaire for the purpose of 
gathering information about the educational and work ex¬ 
periences of the students who discontinued school during 
Gr. XI or Gr. XII in the last few years. I am interested 
in finding out why so many Southern Alberta students 
stopped school in these two grades. 

Please consider each question carefully and answer it 
as well as you can. A few facts of a rather personal nature 
have been included in order that I may be better able to ap¬ 
praise the education you received under the present Alberta 
High School system. 

Answers will be treated confidentially, so do not hesi¬ 
tate to state your ideas freely. If you wish to make addi¬ 
tional comments in the margins, such comments will receive 
careful consideration. 

Use the self-addressed envelope to return the answered 
questionnaire. Please be as prompt as you can. 

Thank you very sincerely for your co-operation. 

Yours very truly, 


(signed) Metro Gushaty
