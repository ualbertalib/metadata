ABSTRACT 


The effect of X-irradiation of barley seeds was studied at 
various levels of metabolic activity, which was experimentally control- 
ed by varying periods of pre-soaking. 

Increased metabolic activity resulted in increased susceptibility 
of seeds to irradiation effect. Optimum treatment levels appeared to 
be! 1. no pre-soaking, Ip, 000-20,000 r; 2. three hours pre-soaking, 
12,000 r # , 5* germinated seeds, 2000 r. A technique based on (2) seemed 
to be most satisfactory for practical work. 

Some one hundred individual mutants, classified into twelve types, 
were induced and studied. All were attributed to recessive point 
mutations. All but one involved some form of chlorophyl deficiency, 
and all were deleterious. The ratio of lethal (mainly albino or near¬ 
albino) types to viable types was about 1:2^ or liJO* 

Cytological observations at sporogenesis indicated little chrom¬ 
osomal breakage and rearrangement, but these phenomena were observed in 
root-tip preparations. 

It is considered that induction of mutations is of aoubtful value 
as a method of plant breeding.

THE PRODUCTION Ojt MUTATIONS IN nAkLEY 


Bi X-IRRADIATION 


J. E. Fitzsimmons 

INTRODUCTION 


The type of penetrating radiations known as X-rays have long been 
known to have pronounced effects, presumably through their powers of 
ionization© But early experimenters were unable to reach deiinite 
conclusions because of variation in organic material and of ignorance 
of the properties of radiation* Results varied from one experiment to 
another v/hen seemingly carried out under the same conditions* It was 
not until some twenty years ago that conclusive evidence was obtained 
on the biological effects of radiation* 

The effects noted involved hereditary changes in various charact¬ 
ers in different species. Such observation stimulated research in the 
application of radiations to determines 

1* the fundamental effects or radiation, and, 

2. the effects of radiation on mutation rate* 

Swedish workers, in particular, have been interested in the latter 
respect, and have made claims that they have been able to produce 
mutants which are superior to the original material in one or more 
respects.

THE PHYSICS OF X-RADIATION 


X-radiation is an electro-magnetic radiation emitted in quanta 
from the target of an X-ray tube, with a wave length of from 0*05 to 
10 Angstrom units. The electro-magnetic nature of the X-rays means 
that they have the same physical properties as light waves, but 
because of the shorter wave length the amount of energy involved is 
much greater. 

These waves have the peculiar property of behaving as waves or 
as particles. This latter property is known as the quantum theory of 
radiation, and each quantum of energy is known as a photon. The 
amount or energy in a photon is inversely proportional to the wave 
length, and it can behave as though the photon were a particle with a 
definite mass. A theoretical mass can be calculated for a photon by 
using the famous Einstein formula, Esmc^, where E is the energy in 
ergs, m is the mass in grams, and c is the velocity of light in 
centimeters per second. 

The X-ray wave length in Angstrom units can be approximated 
roughly by the formula 12400/voltage applied. This gives the short¬ 
est wave length emitted, while the wave length of greatest intensity 
is about twice that. However, there is a spectrum of wave lengths 
emitted, ranging from those that are very short to long wave lengths 
that overlap into the ultra-violet range. Filters of aluminium or 
copper can be used to absorb some of the longer wave lengths so that 


a more monochromatic beam will be emitted

X-rays are absorbed in matter by a process of ionization. Ion- 
ozation takes place when a photon strikes an orbital electron and 
ejects the electron from an atom. The ejected electron then moves off 
with all the energy of the photon, less the energy required to eject 
it. This electron can strike other orbital electrons of different 
atoms and remove them. This process is repeated until all the energy 
is used up. The initial electron ejected is known as a photoelectron, 
and the process as the photoelectric effect. 

The atom that loses an electron also loses one negative charge 
and thus becomes positively charged, or in other words, positive ions 
are formed. The ejected ions eventually tie up with other atoms when 
their energy is lost, and negative ions are formed. Thus ion pairs 
are formed. It is generally believed that only positive ions have 
any significant biological effect. 

The energy from an X-ray wave 01 l.p Angstrom units is aoout 
8 Kev, or 8000 electron volts. The energy required to eject an 
electron from an atom in tissue is aoout O.p Kev. Therefore the 
ejected electron has an energy of about 7*5 Kev which causes it to move 
about l.p microns in the tissue and cause about 2^0 further ionizations.* 

Because ox one penetrating power of X-rays, it is convenient to 
measure the energy absorbed in a given volume. The unit of dosage 
employed is the "roentgen” (usually designated by r) which is defined 
as: 

n The quantity of X-irradiation which will produce one electrostatic 
unit of ions of either sign in one cubic centimeter ox air under 
standard conditions of temperature and pressure.”

For convenience of making the physical measurement the roentgen 
is defined in terms of energy absorption in air* In tissue the energy 
absorption for the same incident intensity of radiation will be about 
one thousand times greater on account of the greater density of tissue, 
Lea (17, p7). 

The biological effect of X-rays are due to the penetration and 
subsequent ionization that takes place* The ionization of an atom 
changes its chemical properties, and it also changes the chemical prop¬ 
erties of the molecule of which the atom is a part* It is also possible 
that the chemical effect may be transmitted to adjacent molecules, i.e., 
those within chemical striking distance 01 the ionized molecule. 

In a study of mutations the effectiveness of the radiation is 
limited to certain critical volumes in the cells, namely the chromo¬ 
somes, and genes on the chromosomes. These become targets to be hit 
by the photons. 

According to Lea (17, p7S) each ionization in irradiated tissue 
has a certain probability of producing the effect, but the probability 
is uninfluenced since the last ionization occurred or before the next 
will occur. Therefore the effectiveness or the dosage depends on the 
number of roentgens applied and is independent of the intensity of the 
radiation and the manner in which it is fractionated. 

Catcheside (4), however, believes that intensity and fractionation 
of the dose plays a significant part insofar as chromosomes are con¬ 
cerned. At low intensities breaks have a better chance to rejoin before 
another break is iormed, thus reducing the chances of fragmentation. 
Fractionating the dose will have about the same effect.

Most workers, as reported by Lea (l7)> agree that gene changes are 
due to one ionization per gene, and so the greater the dose the more 
genes are affected. Lea states that the following results have been 
obtained: 

1. Yield of recessive lethal mutations is proportional to dose. 

2. For a given dose the yield is independent of the time over 
which the irradiation is extended. 

5. The yield for a given ionization in the tissue diminishes with 
increase of ion density of the radiation.* 

These are the principal tests by which one recognizes an action of 
radiation produced by a single ionization* 

LITERATURE REVIEW 


General 

Muller (19) and Stadler {2$, 24) first published results of the 
effects of X-rays on heredity. They worked independently, Muller with 
Drosophila, and Stadler with corn and barley. Both workers found sim- 
iliarity in the behavior of different organisms xo the effect of X-rays 
as follows: 

1. The rate of induced mutation was much higher than the rate of 
spontaneous mutation. 

2 0 The mutations observed were like those of natural (spontaneous) 
occurrence. 

% Chromosomal aberrations occurred in all the organisms studied. 
4. The rate of mutation was proportional to dosage. 

* With different types of radiation, hard X-rays, soft X-rays, neutrons 
and alpha rays.

5* All mutations, with one or two exceptions, were recessive, 

6. Many mutations observed were due to chromosomal deletions. 

Stadler and Muller subsequently made rather extensive studies of 
the effects of X-rays on the induction of mutations* The mutations 
were almost invariably recessive and were found to segregate in a 
simple ratio* This led to the hypothesis that mutations were 
caused by a single gene change. In other words, when a gene in a 
chromosome was hit and affected by the X-ray photon, only one of the 
two alleles was involved. Further substantiation was provided by the 
observation of reversible mutations and of mutations which were in 
multiple allelic series. 

Stadler (2^) defined a (point) mutation as any heritable varia¬ 
tion which cannot be shown to be due to a change involving more than 
one gene. Mutations are identified by experimental tests, and these 
cannot establish conclusively that a change within a gene has occurred. 
Deficiencies may occur that do not involve the loci of two known genes, 
and which therefore cannot be distinguished from mutations. He, how¬ 
ever, states that a “gene 9 or “point 1 * mutation indicates that either a 
chemical change or a deletion may be involved. A hypothesis of chem¬ 
ical change cannot be tested directly but can only be inferred. Only 
the larger aberrations, such as translocations, fragmentation, inver¬ 
sions and large deletions can be detected by cytological examination, 
and therefore, it is highly probable that small undetectible deletions 
also occur. Such deletions can cause a pnenotypic change which will 
show the same kind of segregation as a gene. Because of the greater 
prevalence of chromosome aberrations, Stadler stated that most artifi¬ 
cially induced mutations are probably due to deletions rather than a

chemical change of the gene, and therefore, cannot safely be regarded 
as being tne same as spontaneous mutations. 

As indicated by Altenburg (l) mutations vary rrom very small, 
almost undetectable to very large, easily observable changes* In other 
words, there is a mutation spectrum. Some, such as the chlorophyl 
deficient mutants, are very easily identified; others, such as gross 
morphological changes, can usually be detected by careful observations; 
but in all probability many escape observation* Physiological changes, 
which Gustafson (1^) has reported are very difficult to isolate. Con¬ 
sequently the mutation rates are only apparent. 

Most mutations, whether spontaneous or artificially induced by 
radiation, are deleterious. A number of investigators (l, 6, 12, 19, 24) 
have reported that nearly all mutations are recessive, and the greater 
proportion are lethal. A few, however, are beneficial.

Applications to Plant Breeding 

Stadler (24) stated that the use of artificially induced mutations 
in plant breeding would not be practical. Most of the mutations are 
deleterious and the chance of getting beneficial mutations is very low. 
Moreover, a positive trait tends to carry with it several negative ones. 
There tends to be a pleiotrop ic effect of the alleles, which tends to 
reduce vitality. 

The plant breeder has at his disposal a large number of variations 
present in existing material and these variations are largely due to 
spontaneous mutations that have already been “selected" and adapted. 

The progress made by a plant breeder is certainly influenced by the 
extent to which such existant variability is used in his plant breeding 
program. 

Lein (18) stated that the basis of plant breeding is, at present, 
limited tos 1. spontaneous mutations, 2. selection and 5* crossing. Of 
these three methods, the first is very limited in application because 
of rarity of occurence, the second and third are almost exhausted* He 
feels that X-irradiation, by inducing large numbers of mutations, can 
produce variability in present day varieties which can be put to good 
use in a plant breeding program. 

Gustafsson (l^) stated that fifteen years of extensive work had not 
increased the yield of Scandinavian barleys. He reported that X-irradia¬ 
tion has produced a number of morphological and physiological mutants 
which are superior to the original material in several respects. Such 
mutants can be used to a good advantage in a plant breeding program* In

he mentioned one mutant that produced an extra large head, 
"erectoid 11 , or extremely strong strawed types. In another 
12) he stated that he has isolated several other morpho- 
physiological types that are improvements over the mother 


Techniques 


All barley X-irradiation studies reviewed by the writer were 
conducted on the seeds. Freisleben, as reported by Lein (18), believed 
that pollen treatment would obviate many of the difficulties encountered 
in seed treatment, in that only one cell, the gamete, would be treated. 
But the practical difficulties involved in carrying out pollen irradia¬ 
tion are too great to make use of the method in a mutation study. 

The difficulties encountered in seed treatment are due mainly to 
the fact that each seed contains many cells which are affected differ¬ 
ently by the X-ray photons, some (according to Gelin, 9) being more 
severely damaged than others. In addition some of the cells may have 
undergone differentiation and, consequently, chimeral characteristics 
appear in the plants. 

Galaecott (2) reported treatments in which the seed was placed one 
layer thick on a rotating plate, six to eight inches below the target 
of the X-ray tube. He did not state the type of filter, if any, that 
he used, but he said that many biologists question the use of filters

in this type of work, because any wave length that has sufficient 
energy for penetration, can cause ionization in the tissue and may 
result in an affect. Gustafsson (12) reported using an aluminium 
filter, but did not state why. 

In a rather extensive survey, Gustafsson (I 2 ) reported the 
following dosages for a number of agricultural plants: 


5,000 r 


sunflower 

barley 


10,000-20,000 r 
15 , 000 -^ 0,000 r 


wheat 

rye 

flax 

rape 


12,500 r 
40,000-60,000 r 
90,000 r 


Stadler (24) found that not all heads produced by a single seed 
showed mutations. There are several tiller primorodia in the growing 
point of a developing embryo and if a cell or cells in one primordium 
are hit, only the tiller arising therefrom can produce a mutation. 
Therefore it is necessary to handle each head separately. He reported 
that three to four heads per plant can give a good indication of the 
apparent mutation rate in barley.

Researches on Barley 

Researches on barley, as has been indicated, have been limited to 
mutation studies arising from irradiated seeds* A number of workers 
(5, 5, 9, l4, 15 j 20, 26 ) have reported on a the effects of different 
modifying factors such as heat treatments before and after irradiation, 
atmospheric changes, sonic energy, ultra violet rays and polyploidy 
used in conjunction with X-rays* There i6 a voluminous literature on 
the effects of X-rays on chromosomes of corn, Tradescantia and, in part¬ 
icular, Drosophila, 

In mutation studies Frfteir and Gustafsson (8) reported on the 
effect of seed size and hull on the efficiency of X-rays in producing 
biological effects* They concluded that the hull reduced the damage 
by absorbing some of the energy, and that large seeds were less suscep¬ 
tible than small, as measured by the rate of survival* They noted in a 
heavily irradiated sample containing seeds of various sizes, that the 
few plants which survived were larger, more vigorous and had more 
tillers than the check plants* They concluded that only the large 
seeds survived the treatment, and consequently the plants were larger. 
They stated that for best results only uniform seed samples should be 
used. 

Several investigators (4, 6, 12, 19, 25) have reported on the 
effect of irradiation on chromosomes. These effects are usually trans¬ 
locations, inversions, deletions and fragmentation. In general, with 
increasing dosage, there is an increase in chromosomal aberration* As 
a result of such aberrations the course of mitosis becomes quite erratic.

through to telophase, but after a few divisions the nuclei disintegrate 
and disappear. The normal divisions of the undamaged cells pass the ab¬ 
normal, and after a few divisions mostly normal divisions can be seen. 

Gelin ( 9 ) reported on the effects of increasing the moisture con¬ 
tent on susceptibility to X-ray damage. He found that there was an 
increase in chromosomal aberrations as moisture content increased. He 
used a dosage of 10,000 r and moisture contents of 10$, 15$ and after 
soaking for 25 hours. The damage reported was 12.7$ disturbed divisions 
for 10$ moisture, 28$ disturbances for 15 $ moisture and 53*8% after the 
soaking period. He found a marked parallelism between the percentage of 
disturbed cells, sterility and mutation rate. He stated that if the per¬ 
centage of disturbed cells is doubled, the mutation rate will be doubled. 

Gustafsson (ll), and Freisleben and Lein (6) reported thatirradiated 
seeds can start growth even when exposed to extremely heavy dosages, but 
not all seeds produce viable plants. They found that the proportion of 
plants surviving past the first leaf stage markedly decreased with 
increased severity of treatment. Gustafsson (ll) reported that the 
treatment that produced the highest mutation rate is one that can cause 
a decrease of about 25 $ in the survival of treated seeds. 

Gustafsson ( 15 ) has found that the mutation rate and partial steril¬ 
ity are closely related. The X^ plants (i.e., those plants grown from 
irradiated seed) that have a high proportion of sterile florets tend to 
produce more mutations per X 2 plant than those having a higher propor¬ 
tion of fertile florets. He pointed out that highly fertile plants 
produce albinos, whereas highly sterile plants produce more of the rarer 
mutants. Gustafsson has concluded, from this and other evidence to be

presented later in the discussion, that there is a certain selectivity- 
in the types of mutations found. 

Gustafsson (10) has reported at great length and detail on the types 
of mutations, and the probabilities of certain kinds occurring. He has 
found it convenient to classify them as follows! 

1. Ohlorophyl mutants 

2. Sterility or lethal mutants 

5* Vital mutants! 

(a) morphological 

(b) physiological 

He subdivided the chlorophyl mutations again as follows! 

1. Albinos, These occur most frequently at the lower levels of 
dosage, and mostly irom plants that are highly fertile. He found that 
with increasing dosage there was a decrease in the number of albino 
mutations produced. For this reason Gustafsson (10) refers to the pro¬ 
portionality between dosage and mutation rate to be a psuedophenonenon. 

2. Xantha. This type appears at more severe treatments, usually 
in the progeny of highly sterile plants. Plastids of the xantha type 
are intermediate between the viridis and albino. These tend to appear 
in proportion to dosage. 

5# Viridis. These mutations are most easily produced in highly 
sterile plants. The plants are normal to subnormal. 

4, Tigrina. This is a viable striped mutant that appears only 
in the progeny of irradiated dry seeds. 

% Alboxanthf which is intermediate between albinos and viridis 
in appearance and occur only in the progeny of highly hydrated seeds.

Sterility and lethal mutants are divided into two classes because 
1, the lethals fail to develop to the flowering stage, and 2. the 
sterility class fails to set seed because of some change in the flower 
structure which prevents seed setting* 

Vital mutants have been described under two subdivisions as follows: 

1« Morphological mutants are those that are fully viable and quite 
fertile* The most commonly found are the M erectoid ” types which arise 
from the same kind of treatments as the Xantha mutations* However, most 
of the morphological mutants show a pleiotrop ic genetic effect and are 
consequently inferior to the mother line in one or more respects, such 
as inferior yield and later maturity* Some, however, appear to be 
superior. 

2* Physiological mutants differ from the mother line mainly in 
physiological characters, but some very slight morphological differences 
are usually apparent, such as 1000 kernel weight and width of leaf. 

Gustafsson (ij) has reported that fairly constant relative mutation 
rates exist between the different types of mutants* One induced morpho¬ 
logical mutant, fertile or infertile, corresponds in frequency of occur¬ 
rence to 22 chlorophyl aberrants, 15 mutants that prevent normal meiosis 
and gametic formation, or JO cases of translocation sterility. In 
order to obtain one mutant distinctly better in one or more character¬ 
istics the barley breeder must induce about seven hundred to eight 


hundred worthless mutants

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Material used in this study was largely confined to Montcalm 
barley* Barley, as previously indicated, is a good organism for the 
study of the effect of X-irradiation on mutation rate* Barley is also 
an important commercial crop, the variety Montcalm being one of the 
more valuable varieties* Irradiations of other crop plants such as 
peas, rape, flax and a selfed line of sunflowers were carried out on a 
small scale* 

The X-ray apparatus used delivered 200 roentgensper minute at a 
distance of eight inches from the target* The machine was operated at 
100,000 volts (100 Kv.) and 7 milliamperes (7ma-)* Dosages used were 
based on those recommended by G-ustafsson (lM)> usually 15>,000 r for 
dormant seeds and smaller dosages lor soaked or germinated seeds* No 
filter was used* 

During the course of each irradiation treatment, the seeds were 
placed in a single layer in a petri dish, which was placed under the 
X-ray tube for the duration of the exposure. Because the X-ray beam 
is not homogenous it was deemed advisable to redistribute the seeds 
at regular intervals, so that each seed would have as good a chance as 
any other of getting hit by the same number of photons of similiar 
energy value. The seeds were redistributed at least three times in 
each exposure, by pouring the seeds from one dish to another and thor¬ 
oughly mixing them each time* About 2^0 to J00 seeds were treated 
each time. 

Soaking was accomplished by placing the sample in a small sack 
which was immersed in a beaker of tap water* Moisture content was

estimated by weighing the samples before and after soaking and cal¬ 
culating the increase in moisture content. At the end of the soaking 
period the excess water was removed by rolling the seeds in paper 
towelling. The X-irradiation treatment followed immediately. Checks 
were treated in the same manner except that they were not X-rayed 0 

Germinated seeds were used in order to reduce the time needed 
for irradiation treatments. Germination was carried out in petri 
dishes, using moist blotting paper, and after 24 hours the seeds were 
ready for treatment* Treatment was carried out by leaving the seeds 
on a layer of moist paper during the period of exposurej but the seeds 
were redistributed at least twice during the treatment. 

Treated and check samples were sown as soon as possible after 
treatment. In the field attempts were made to ensure uniform spacing 
of the seeds so that single plants could be harvested. In 1949 all 
seeding was done by hand, but in 19p0 some was done using the Kemp 
V-belt seeder. Some treatments were sown in the greenhouse to get 
information on germination and survival rates oi the different treat¬ 
ments. 

X^ plants were harvested in the field as single plants. Where 
possible, 4 heads were selected from each plant, for use in studies of 
the mutation rates. Seeds from the four heads were sown in a separate 
row. Where one head produced a mutation, the progenitor X^ plant, was 
considered to have carried an induced mutation. Where all of the heads 
carried a mutation, t,he mutation was assumed to have arisen spontan¬ 
eously prior to treatment. Where two heads each carried a mutation, 
two mutants were recorded. Where two mutations arose in one head.

two mutants were also recorded. 

The mutation rate was calculated on the basis of the number of 
mutating plants per hundred plants tested, expressed as a percentage. 
This procedure was adopted because it has not been possible to sow and 
test all the X^ plants, so calculations on the basis oi number of seeds 
treated was not possible. 

Most of the observations were made at the seedling stage in order 
to make use of the greenhouse facilities. The plants were allowed to 
grow for a period of 2 to 5 weeks. 

In the field the same procedure was used, but viable mutations 
were grown to maturity. At maturity the X 2 lines that had shown 
mutations were harvested as single plants. Some of these lines were 
grown in the greenhouse to determine the mode of inheritance of the 
mutant types. Two heads of each plant of each line were grown, and 
the segregating ratios of the mutant character noted. 

Oytological examinations were carried out on a limited amount of 
material. The acetocarmine smear technique, as outlined by Smith (22) 
was used throughout. Examinations were made on root tips of irradiated 
seed, and spore mother cells in the anthers at sporogenesis were 
examined in the Xp and X 2 generations. Material was obtained from 
each treatment of the X^ in the 1950 series and from the mutating lines 
of the X 2 . 

In the 1950 series of treatments a fertility study was attempted. 
The number of fertile and infertile florets was estimated on each of 
the four heads of the harvested plants. To facilitate counting the 
awns were singed off by flaming with a bunsen burner. Gemination

effects of the flame on the seeds. 


OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY 


ThiB study is preliminary in nature, designed primarily to 
evaluate the claims of the Swedish workers, who have reported getting 
mutations of economic importance. The present investigation has been 
mainly concerned with technique of seed treatment, classification of 
mutant types and determination of mutation rates* 


EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 


The X-j_ Generation 

Plants other than barley 

Flax, rape, peas and four selfed lines of sunflowers were treated 
at dosage levels recommended by Gustafsson (ll). No apparent effect 
was noted in the X^ of the flax or rape but the peas showed reduced 
growth* The peas were discarded because of the severe drough and lack 
of time to give them adequate attention* 

Three of the sunflower lines received 5000 r each and the fourth 
line 4000 r. The germination of the first three lines was under ^0% 9

while the germination of the fourth was about 90j'o , which indicated that 
5000 r dosage was approaching the upper limit. The surviving plants 
were selfed by bagging them, but a severe early frost killed most of 
the immature seed. The few available seeds of each treatment were 
sown but no mutations were apparent. 


Barley 

Effect of soaking on moisture content 

To determine the water uptake of soaked seeds, weighings were 
made at twenty minute intervals, as indicated in Table 1. The rapid 
rise in the weight at the start is presumably due to intake of water 
by the process of imbibition. When the capacity to imbibe water is 
exhausted at the end of about two hours the weight becomes relatively 
constant for a period of one hour. The increased water content then 
appears to activate the metabolic process and enzymatic action changes 
starch to sugar. This conversion brings about an increase in osmotic 
pressure in the cells of the seed, and water intake is again initiated, 
this time by the process of osmosis. Equilibrium appears to be reached 
after about five hours of soaking. These data indicate that metabolic 
activity begins in about three hours of soaking.

These results indicate that increased dosage above 10,000 r has 
a detrimental effect on survival and growth. Increased moisture content 
of the seed is directly associated with increased killing effect of 
irradiation. 


Field observations s Observations of plants were limited to survival 
rates and fertility estimations. These results are shown in Tables 5 
and 4. Inasmuch as the two years or the study were extremely dry the 
differences between treatments, other than regarding survival, were 
negligible. Differences were more apparent during the first three to 
four weeks of growth, but disappeared after that time. At maturity 
even the most heavily treated survivors appeared almost as vigorous as 


the checks

Until July 16, 1949, practically no rain fell, but heavy rains 
occurred after that time. The result of such an increase in moisture 
supplies favored the development of second growth, which tended to 
mask any effect due to irradiation* 

Before the crop matured heavy frost occurred, which prevented 
proper development of the seed, and consequently it could not be deter¬ 
mined whether the observed effects were due to irradiation or to frost* 
Therefore it was not possible to obtain data on possible effects such 
as induced sterility* 

In 1950 the season was again very dry* The dry weather retarded 
growth and heavy rains late in the season again caused excessive second 
growth. But as no frost occurred an attempt was made to collect data 
on induced sterility. These data are given in Table 3*

It was also noted that a number of heads exhibited chimeral char¬ 
acteristics. Several heads showed high to complete sterility on one 
side. Unfortunately this condition was not observed until the counts 
were almost complete, so without doubt many such heads were missed. 

Other chimeras noted were: a plant with striped leaves on one 
tiller; two plants having a branched rachis, resulting in a double head. 


The X 2 Generation 


Rate of induced mutation 

Studies of X 2 plants were limited to determination of plant 
survival, rate of induced mutation, and relative frequency of mutant 
types. 

Data on the effect of soaking on survival and mutation rates are 
given in Table 4. These data are compiled from both greenhouse and 
field-grown material. Results from X 2 seedlings grown in 1950 (green¬ 
house only) are given in Table 5 . In this case both r dosage and per¬ 
iod of soaking were varied. 

Mutation rates shown are only apparent because: 

1. Only four heads p'er plant were used, therefore some heads 
carrying mutated genes were, in all probability, not grown. 

2. Viable mutants are difficult to pick out in the seedling stage 
and some were likely not classified. 

5* A major difficulty encountered in determining mutations appeared 
when certain abnormalities occurred which might have been due to frost

damage. In some cases abnormal leaves were diagnosed as symptoms of 
frost damage. In other cases very small white shoots which barely 
emerged occurred rather frequently* These were also attriouted to 
frost damage, but a few may have been classified as mutations* 

4. Germination was poor in the seed of 1949> and many seeds 
failed to grow* Consequently, in determining mutation rate, the 
assumption was made that the seeds carrying the mutated genes had 
the same probability of frost damage as the normal seed.

Classiiication and relative frequency 

of observed mutations 


The types of mutations found, in order of relative frequency are: 
1. Lethal mutations 

A. Chlorophyl aberrants 
i, Albinos 

a. pure white 

b. greenish midrib on leaf 
Co green tips 

ii. Yellows 

a* pure yellow 
b. with a greenish tip 

iiio Dwarfs with small striped leaves* These mutants failed 
to develop seed. 


2. Viable mutations 

A. Chlorophyl aberrants 

i. Plants with striped leaves, later and smaller than the 
normals, 

B. Non-chlorophyl mutants 

i. Plants with a lighter shade of green than the normals, 
with very short internodes, and ten to fourteen days 
later in maturing than the normal, 

ii. Notched leaf, found only in the seedling stage in the 
greenhouse. 


The segregation ratio approached the ratio, but as each 
individual row produced numbers of plants varying from three to thirty, 
observations on segregation ratios were deferred until the generation, 
which is discussed later.

Evaluation of r dosage as related to pre-soaking 

An accurate evaluation is rather difficult because, among other 
limitations, the populations analyzed were rather small, A number of 
scheduled treatments had to be omitted when the X-ray apparatus failed 
at a critical point. This accounts, in part, for a number of treat¬ 
ments being missed. 

In general, severity of treatment reduced germination and increased 
proportion of sterility in the heads. For dormant seeds,treatments 
approaching 20,000 r reduced survival to the point where too few plants 
are available in the X^ for a study of mutation rate? while 15,000 r 
results in too large a population for convenient handling. 

With pre-soaking and pre-germination,seeds become more suscep¬ 
tible to irradiation injury, survival rates are lowered and mutation 
rates per plant tend to increase. 

The better treatments are considered to bes 1, 15,000 r with 
three to four hours soaking, or 2, about 2,000 r for germinated 
seeds. However, for practical purposes elimination of soaking and 
using dosages of 15,000 r or slightly greater can be expected to give 
fairly good results. 


The X^ Generation 

Studies on this generation were confined, apart from a small 
amount of cytological work,to segregation among X^ plants grown in the 
greenhouse. These plants were derived from Xg head rows (field) that 
had shown mutations, i.e,, heterozygous lines. In harvesting the Xg 
rows each plant was kept separate.

Theoretically the X 2 rows showing mutations (presumably recessive) 
were mixtures 01 phenotypically normal homozygous and heterozygous 
types as well as the phenotypical mutant types* For example, a head 
row segregating in the field and producing albinos would be expected 
to include plants of genotypes GG, Gg and gg, the phenotypes being 
(homozygous) normal, (heterozygous) normal and albino respectively* 

The progeny of the heterozygote, Gg should segregate according to the 
5*1 ratio* Theorectically the ratio of the homozygous to the hetero¬ 
zygous plants is 1:2. 

As indicated in Table 6 the ratio of normal to mutants in the 
segregating lines was close to Application of the chi-square test 

p 

for goodness of fit gave X equal to 0.50 indicating a very good fit to 
the assumed ratio* However, the proportion of homozygous to heterozygous 
approached a 1:1 ratio, rather than the expected 1:2* This discrepancy 
indicates that a deletion, rather than a point mutation may be involved* 

The data, however, show that single recessive alleles at a single 
chromosome locus are operative in this case. Relating this fact to the 
concept of photon and target, the mutants are considered to be: 

1. changes in single genes 

2. small deficiencies. 

This is supported by cytological evidence. Out of fifty heads 
examined at sporogenesis none showed any traces of chromosomal aberra¬ 
tions. This indicates that changes at single loci rather than gross 
chromosomal effects were produced by the X-irradiation treatment. 

Attention should be drawn to instances of the occurrences of two 
mutations in a single plant. One of the heads from an X^ plant grown

in plot 6079 (Table 6) produced albinos, which segregated as normals 
109 albino and the other head segregated as 2J& normal*89 albino with 
green midrib. Plot 6081 also provides an example of one X 2 plant that 
produced two mutations, the segregation being 12 albinoss^ albinos with 
a green midrib*55 normal. Such data show that more than one chromosome 
were involved in a few instances. 


Cytological Studies 

Root tip studies 

Cytological studies were carried out on a limited amount of 
material in order to provide some indication of the observable chrom¬ 
osomal effect which might be produced by X-irradiation. Studies on 
root tips yielded very little information. They aid show, however, the 
occurrence of fragmentation and bridges which were roughly proportional 
to dosage. 

Considerable difficulty was encountered in getting root tips with 
dividing cells, particularly at the more severe dosages. A large number 
of root tips were examined and discarded because of the lack of dividing 
cells. In no case was it possible to get any pertinent data on X-ray 
damage to the plant as measured by chromosomal damage. 

Sporogenesis studies 

These studies were carried out on spore mother cells at sporo- 
genesis. Examinations were made at metaphase I at a magnification of 
440 diameters* Considerable difficulty was experienced in finding

material at the critical stage ior examination. Inexperience in 
sampling was a contributing factor in this instance. Many of the 
spikes examined were too young but most of those discarded were too 
far advanced to obtain the proper stage of cell division. 

With two exceptions all the heads examined appeared normal. 

The exceptions showed rings of 4 at diakenesis, indicating reciprocal 
translocations. 

All the X 2 plants examined at the critical stage appeared normal, 
indicating that any mutations in the X 2 were likely due to a simple 
gene change or a small deletion, rather than to observable aberrations. 

It is quite possible that a more experienced cytologist may have 
been able to detect small chromosomal aberrations that were not apparent 
to the writer. However, slides that were examined by more experienced 
persons were pronounced normal. 

The writer feels that cytological examination can yield very little 
pertinent information in a study on mutations and mutation rates. A 
survey of the literature failed to reveal much evidence on the actual 
role of chromosomal aberrations, with the exceptions of reciprocal trans¬ 
locations and possibilities of deletions. 

Aberrant root tip mitosis may be an indication of X-irradiation 
injury, but most of the injured cells are lost after a few divisions. 

If too many cells are too severely injured death of the plant results. 
There is some controversy in the literature regarding the erfective- 
ness of any correlation between chromosomal injury and mutation rate 
(9> 10). As pointed out oy Lein (18) most of the aberrations that 
survive in the mature plant fail to pass through meiosis, and sterility

However, it is difficult to correlate sterility with mutation 
rate because each spike comes from a different primordium of the seed* 

So that cytological examination of one spike cannot give any information 
on the sterility and/or mutations that may appear in the other spikes 
of the same plant* 

The fact that mutations tend to arise more frequently in highly 
sterile plants indicates the greater probability of a primordium being 
hit at a critical point, and causing a chemical change in the gene or 
a deletion* 

Experiments with simultaneous applications of sonic energy and 
X-rays indicate that more chromosomal injury becomes apparent when 
breaks are prevented from rejoining* Fragmentation and other chromo¬ 
somal aberrations occur with greater frequency because the sonic energy 
prevents rejoining of the broken ends* Such information implies that 
actual breakage is greater than realized, because sonic energy by 
itself does not cause viable chromosomal injury* The full extent of 
the damage not being apparent indicated that a certain amount of re¬ 
joining has taken place* The rejoining, if fragmentation has taken 
place, may result in small deletions. 


DISCUSSION 


At indicated previously, several difficulties were encountered 
which detracted from the completeness of the study* Trouble with the 
X-ray apparatus forced abandonment of a number of scheduled treatments*

The Extreme drought conditions of both 19*49 and 1950 prevented normal 
development of the lield grown material. Frost killing of immature 
seeds in 19^9 was a further handicap. Lack of greenhouse facilities 
seriously limited the amount of X 2 and material grown. 

An association of treatments with certain types of mutations was 
not apparent in this study, although most of the viable mutations pro¬ 
duced appeared in the progenies of the irradiated dormant seeds. 

There would appear to be inherent difficulties in applying 
X-irradiation techniques to plant breeding, as follows: 

1. Difficulty in identifying small mutations, in particular, 
physiological types. 

2. The large numbers of deleterious mutations that appear in pro¬ 
portion to the good ones. In this study about one viable mutant per 
twenty-five to thirty lethals was found. 

Any viable mutant very likely carries with it several unfavor- 
albe traits along with the good. This pleiotropic effect may make the 
crossing and subsequent selection very difficult or impossible. 

If, as Gustafsson ( 15 ) suggests, 700 to 800 mutations must be 
induced in order to get one good mutant, then the size of the nursery 
required will be excessive and require the services of a large number 
of trained workers. The production of a mutant of a desirable type 
would be a big step forward in plant breeding, but the cost of producing 
it may not be warranted. 

Several modifications in technique could now be investigated since 
a new tube and new transformers have increased the output of the X-ray 
machine to 600 r per minute. This increased intensity may have a

greater effect per given dosage, in that the higher intensities may 
mean more chromosomal injury, (Catcheside, 4)* For similiar reasons 
fractionating the dosage may be an undesirable variable and experiments 
could be carried out to determine its effect* 

Several criteria have been used to evaluate X-ray damage to seeds, 
such as chromosomal injury in root tips, survival and growth rates of 
Xi plants, rate of induced sterility and of mutation in the The 

criterion most easily used in large samples is the survival rate. A 
quarter value dosage, that is, one that can reduce the rate of survival 
to one-quarter of the number of treated seeds can be determined with 
relative ease. In such treatments the amount of treated seed can be 
fairly large, while the X]_ population can be kept rather small. 
According to Gustafsson (ll) such treatments still leave enough sur¬ 
viving plants to give a good indication of the mutation rate, and a 
good probability of getting viable mutations. 

Cytological examination of seed treated material is difficult to 
carry out on the large populations involved and data obtained cannot 
be correlated directly with mutations produced, since examination can 
be made only by killing the material involved. Sterility studies are 
also difficult to correlate directly because each head represents a. 
different sector and partial sterility varies from head to head of 
the same plant. 

All mutations noted were recessive and, as far as is known, 
deleterious. Most were lethal mutants, but some viable morphological 
types were found. Itis felt that had the seasons been more favorable 
other mutations might have been found. According to Gustafsson (l;5)

the most common morphological mutant is the short erect "erectoid n 
type, but unfortunately, all of the barley studied was very short and 
very erect, so that the erectoid type, if it did appear, would not 
have been very obvious. However, as Gustafsson has pointed out, one 
morphological mutant for 20 albinos induced could be expected. In 
this study the proportion was less than he indicated. 

The mutations found segregated in the Jil ratio, insofar as could 
be determined. It would appear, then, that a single gene was respon¬ 
sible for each mutant. However, in the case of the morphological ones 
found, one and perhaps more physiological characters were effected. 

The mutant type was much smaller, with shorter internodes and much 
later (about two weeks) in maturing than the normal plants. This 
indicates a pleiotropic effect of the gene. 


CONCLUSION 


Certain aspects of irradiation techniques show promise. Fairly 
severe treatments can be used to produce rather large numbers of 
mutations at a rate much above that of spontaneous mutations. The 
induction of mutations by artificial means does bring about a number 
of variations which can be used in genetic studies. The production of 
improved varieties through X-ray induced mutations shov/s some promise, 
but the cost of producing them may be too great to be of practical 
importance.
