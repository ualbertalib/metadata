/ABSTRACT 


The heats of wetting of silk fibroin samples with various 
initial moisture contents were obtained by means of an adiabatic 
calorimeter. 

From the heat of wetting measurements, and from a water 
vapour adsorption isotherm, the heat, free energy and entropy of 
adsorption were calculated. 

Two different methods of calculating the surface area of 
the silk were used and an explanation of the wide divergence of 
results was offered. 

The heats of wetting of cotton linter samples which had 
undergone various numbers of wetting and drying cycles were also 
measured. An explanation was made to correlate the heat measurements 
with the accessibility of cellulose to various reagents. 

An attempt to measure the heat of Getting 1 of wool keratin 


was made

INTRODUCTION 


The object of this work was to measure the heats of wetting 
by water of wool and silk. These data for samples with different 
moisture contents, from zero moisture to saturation, together with 
data from water vapour adsorption isotherms would permit an evaluation 
of certain thermodynamic functions for the adsorption process. Heat 
of wetting measurements by water on specially prepared cellulose 
samples were also carried out to corroborate other experimental work 
done by Dr. R.K. Brown and co-workers. All heat of wetting measure¬ 
ments were done at 25°C. 

Silk and Wool 

Many workers have measured water vapour adsorption isotherms 
on crystalline proteins by applying the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) 
equation (l). It is possible to interpret these isotherms in terms 
of surface area and structure of the solid adsorbent. Much work has 
also been done on inert gas adsorption on proteins. The BET plots 
of these isotherms give different results with regard to surface area 
■— the water vapour data giving areas 40 to 250 times as large as those 
obtained from the‘inert 1 gas isotherms (2). This has been inter¬ 
preted as meaning that the water vapour adsorption occurs more strongly 
on specific sites on the molecule, namely the peptide linkages and 
polar side chains. In other words, the surface area calculated from 
the BET equation for the water vapour isotherms is much larger because 
the proteins in general present a large internal surface to the water 
molecules, not accessible to ’inert 5 gases such as nitrogen. 

By applying thermodynamics to water vapour adsorption isotherms 
run at 25° and 40°, it is possible to calculate the free energy change 
of the adsorption process. These calculations have been done by Davis

and McLaren (3) on isotherms run by Bull (4). From this free energy 
data for the two isotherms it is then possible to calculate the heats 
of adsorption as a function of volume of water adsorbed. However, as 
this is an indirect calculation in which only the general trend of 
the AH curve can be ascertained, the use of these data to calculate 
entropy change gives even more inaccurate results. 

For insoluble proteins the wetting process can be considered 
to be closely related to water vapour adsorption, the main difference 
being the phase in which the adsorbate exists. For soluble proteins 
solution and dilution also occur when the protein is mixed with liquid 
water, so that no close relation exists between wetting with liquid 
water and ??ater vapour adsorption. The aim of this project was to 
measure the heats of wetting of typical insoluble proteins, namely 
wool and silk. These data would give direct values for the heat of 
adsorption and thus permit a more accurate calculation of entropy 
changes. 

Wool belongs to the class of proteins known as keratins, 
which are highly insoluble in water. Other examples of keratins are 
hair, horn, nails, and hoof. Keratins are characterized by a relatively 
large percentage of sulphur (contained in the amino acids cystine and 
cysteine) and also a large percentage of aromatic amino acids. 

Pure silk is knoYm as fibroin and consists largely of the 
smallest neutral amino acids: glycine and alanine. Raw silk consists 
of about 30$ by weight of ?, gum ft or sericin, which must be removed 
by what is called the degumming process. 

The only values of heats of v^etting by Y/ater of wool are 
those reported by Hedges (5a) and also by MacMillan, Mukherju and 
Sen (5b), who used a DeYi/ar flask and Beckmann thermometer to de¬ 
termine the heats of wetting. He also reported four values of

the heat of wetting of silk with different initial moisture contents. 

His technique was incapable of yielding as accurate results as those 
obtained by our method of calorimetry. 

Cellulose 

The following discussion on experimentally determined facts 
on cellulose is given as a background for the heat of wetting measure¬ 
ments on cellulose reported in this thesis. 

Cellulose is considered to consist of crystalline areas 
which are not readily reactive with various reagents, and less crys¬ 
talline areas where the hydroxyl groups are comparatively easily 
reached by these reagents. The percentage of hydroxyl groups which 
is available for reaction is considered an indication of the accessibility 
of cellulose. 

In speaking of degree of accessibility one must specify what 
reagent is being used. An ordinary sample of cellulose can be methylated 
(using thallous ethylate in ether and then methyl iodide) to the extent 
of about 2 %, In other words, 2 % of the total number of hydroxyls are 
reacted. If the same sample were nitrated using nitric acid for one 
half hour (the commercial method of nitrating) a nitrogen analysis of 
the resulting cellulose nitrate would indicate approximately 12 % 
nitrogen. 

If a sample of cellulose were swollen with cold 10$ sodium 
hydroxide which was then removed by the method of solvent exchange 
(neutralizing with acetic acid, then washing with water, methyl 
alcohol, dry methyl alcohol and dry benzene), the sample would remain 
in a highly swollen condition, that is, there would be a relatively 
small number of hydroxyls not available for reaction. Methylation 
of this sample by the above method gives an accessibility of about

35$. Nitration of this sample would give a value of about 12*6% 
nitrogen. The reason for the marked increase in accessibility to 
the methylating reagent, as compared to the relatively small increase 
in accessibility to nitric acid, is that the methylating reagent is 
non-swelling and therefore, does not change the cellulose structure, 
whereas the nitric acid itself will swell the cellulose so that only 
a small relative difference is obtained. 

If the swollen cellulose is wetted once with water and then 
dried, a change known as the "zippering effect 11 occurs. The water 
reacts xvith the cellulose hydroxyl groups to form hydrogen bonds, then 
as the water is withdrawn, adjacent chains of the cellulose are drawn 
closer together and hydrogen bonds are formed between the hydroxyl 
groups of these adjacent chains. This is in effect decreasing the 
accessibility of the sample by increasing the percentage of crystalline 
cellulose. 

Methylation of a swollen sample which has undergone one 
wetting-drying cycle as outlined above gives about 2$ accessibility 
to the methylating reagent whereas nitration gives a high value of 
about 12.4$ nitrogen. 

The purpose of our work was to determine the effect of 
different numbers of wetting and drying cycles on the accessibility 
of the cellulose to water vapour. Results on methylation and nitration 
of such samples indicate the same general trend. The cellulose with 
one cycle was slightly less reactive to both reagents than the sample 
which had undergone no cycles; then, as the number of cycles increased, 
the reactivity of the samples gradually increased also. It must be 
emphasized that although these changes in accessibility are very small, 
they are of great significance. In the commercial preparation of

cellulose nitrate the differences in percentage nitrogen obtained 
between batches which are soluble in the solvent used and batches 
which are insoluble and must be discarded are of the same order of 
magnitude. 

If samples of cellulose which have undergone consecutive 
numbers of wetting and drying cycles are placed in an atmosphere of 
constant relative humidity, an increase in accessibility to water 
vapour is noted in the sample which has undergone one cycle as compared 
to the sample with no cycles. Then as the number of cycles is increased 
a gradual decrease in accessibility is noted. This is the reverse 
of the effect noted in the methylation and nitration reactions and 
at first appears to be anomalous (6). 

It was decided to carry out heat of wetting measurements 
on the above cellulose samples in order to determine whether there is 
any relationship between heats of wetting and the number of wetting¬ 
drying cycles that the cellulose has undergone.

APPARATUS AND EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 


The first part of the problem was to construct a calorimeter 
to carrjr out these measurements. It was decided to use a rotating 
adiabatic calorimeter based on the design of Lipsett, Johnson, and 
Maass (7). Adiabatic control gives the most accurate results for this 
type of work. Because a calorimeter with a small heat capacity is 
desired so that the temperature change obtained is as large as practicable, 
it is very difficult to have a stationary calorimeter with an efficient 
stirring mechanism. The alternative is to have the calorimeter 
rotating to insure intimate mixing of the sample with water. This 
complicates the temperature readings, however, for it is virtually 
impossible to seal any kind of a thermometer or thermopile into a 
rotating calorimeter. Hov/ever, differences between bath and calorimeter 
temperatures can be determined by means of a radiation thermopile. 

The exact description of the original calorimeter can be found from 
the above reference and all auxiliary equipment is described in a 
previous article by the same authors (8). Therefore, only a brief 
description of apparatus including a few small changes from the original 
will be made here. The radiation thermopile has a sensitivity of 
1 x 10"4oq p er mm. galvanometer scale deflection. Initial and final 
calorimeter temperatures are obtained indirectly by measuring the 
bath temperature with a platinum resistance thermometer and a Meuller 
bridge. The bridge can be read to 10“4 ohms which is equivalent to 
10~3°C. However, by maintaining adiabatic control by means of a fine 
stream of hot water added to the bath, and observing the galvanometer 
deflections for each Meuller bridge reading, the calorimeter*s 
temperature can be calculated to four decimal daces.

The slight changes made in the design of the apparatus are 
as follows: 

No support was used to hold the thermopile in place other 
than the shellac placed on the lower junctions. The thin glass 
supports used on the original apparatus were found not only to be 
unnecessary, but an added difficulty to the construction of the 
thermopile. 

A stainless steel plug was used to seal the opening through 
which water was pipetted into the calorimeter. Vaseline was used to 
ensure a water-tight seal here as well as on the end flange of the 
calorimeter. 

All switches were of the mercury commutator type, it being 
found that they were the simplest type with virtually no contact 
potential. 

The flange on the copper jacket which contained the calori¬ 
meter was held secure using nuts and bolts instead of clamps as on 
the original apparatus. The bolts were secured to the lower flange 
and passed through correspondingly placed holes in the upper flange. 
Specially designed nuts were used, being nearly l ^ 41 in length and 
having handles on them so they could be easily screwed on by hand, 
without hindrance from the upper part of the copper jacket. A gasket 
of ,, Garlock n gasket material was used to keep the flange water-tight. 

The water bath was fitted with a cover to shelter it from 
any drafts in the laboratory. This was critical because any change 
in the rate of evaporation made the maintenance of adiabatic control 
difficult. However, part of the early difficulties experienced in 
operating the calorimeter, which were attributed to this cause, are 
now known to have been due to a very slight evaporation of water from

the calorimeter to the air space of the copper jacket, because of 
imperfect machining of the end flange of the calorimeter. 

A desiccator was specially designed to contain the oven- 
dried samples till they were cooled to room temperature. It was 
constructed from a metal container 9 rt in diameter and 5 H in depth. 

The top of the container was replaced with a circle of glass having 
a hole 4” in diameter which could be covered with an ordinary small 
desiccator lid to give an air-tight seal. This glass was sealed on 
using DeKhotinsky cement. Phosphorus pentoxide was contained in 
small trays placed inside the desiccator. The relatively small opening 
kept the transfer of outside air into the desiccator at a minimum. 
Originally, a rubber glove was sealed into the side of the desiccator, 
so that upon cooling, the dried sample could be covered before the 
desiccator was opened. This was found to be unnecessary, if the 
precaution was taken to cover the sample immediately after the desic¬ 
cator was opened. 

Samples whose heats of wetting are to be determined are 
placed in the inner box which is covered with a vaselined lid to give 
an air-tight seal. This is held in a fixed position inside the calori¬ 
meter. A weighed amount of water is added to the calorimeter which 
is then placed inside the copper jacket. The bath is then filled 
and the temperature of bath and calorimeter brought to 25 - 0.1°C. 

After obtaining consecutive identical readings of the initial tempera¬ 
ture, rotation of the calorimeter is begun, adiabatic control being 
maintained as closely as possible when the wetting reaction is occurring. 
Considerable difficulty was experienced at first in obtaining a lid 
for the inner box which was machined true enough to give an air-tight 
seal, heavy enough to fall off to permit mixing of the sample with

water when rotation was begun, and yet of the correct dimensions to 
be caught by the arresting n hooks” designed to prevent its free 
movement inside the calorimeter during rotation. After a fixed period 
of rotation, the rotation was ceased and the final temperature obtained 
in the same manner as the initial temperature. The heat capacity of 
the calorimeter, which was almost entirely constructed of sterling 
silver, was 13.09 calories plus a correction for the evaporation of 


water vapour into the inner box when rotation was commenced. A 
correction for the heat of rotation was also made. Knowing the sample 
weight and the heat capacities of the calorimeter, water, and the 
sample, as well as the temperature rise, it is a simple matter to 


calculate the heat of wetting in calories per gram of sample. A

All the required specific heats were obtained from the 
International Critical Tables. The weight of water was always corrected 
to the weight in vacuo. 

An experimental check on the calculated heat capacity was 
obtained by the method used on the original apparatus (7). This 
consisted essentially of measuring the heat of solution of sodium 
chloride, using the same ratios of salt to water for two determinations 
but using different amounts of reactants. As the concentration of 
salt is the same in each case, the heat of solution will be the same. 
However, the temperature drop occurring will be different for the 
two different amounts of reactants. The only unknown is the heat 
capacity of the calorimeter. It can be solved for by using two 
simultaneous equations. 

A water vapour adsorption apparatus identical with that 
of F’iig and Juhola (9) was used to obtain the isotherm for silk

PREPARATION of materials 


Wool and Silk 

The wool was prepared by Dr. Larose of the National Research 
Council at Ottawa. He purified the wool by extracting with alcohol 
and ether and equilibrating to a pH of 5. The silk was obtained in 
the raw state from the Belding-Corticelli plant at St. Jean, Quebec. 

It was degummea by the method of Sookne and Harris (10). 

It was originally decided to dry all samples in a manner 
similar to that used by Hedges (4), so that comparable data would be 
obtained. The procedure used was as follows. A stream of air from 
a compressed air line was passed through some absorbent cotton, then 
through two scrubbers of concentrated sulfuric acid, then a tower 
of sodium hydroxide pellets, then through two towers containing 
dehydrite (magnesium perchlorate), then through a copper coil con¬ 
tained inside an oven maintained at 105 - 1°. This preheated the 
air before it entered the desiccator containing the sample to be 
dried. The drying process lasted for two hours after which the 
sample was placed in the previously described desiccator (see page 8) 
over phosphorus pentoxide for thirty minutes to cool. It was then 
weighed to obtain its dry weight. 

If the sample were prepared to determine the heat of wetting 
with no initial moisture content, the container used for drying the 
sample was the inner box of the calorimeter. As soon as the dried 
weight was obtained (by difference) the inner box, covered by the 
greased lid, was placed in the calorimeter and the heat measurement 
carried out. 

If, however, the sample were being prepared to obtain a 


heat of wetting for a certain initial moisture content, the container

used for drying was a weighing bottle. As soon as the dried weight was 
obtained, the sample contained in the weighing bottle was placed 
over a sulfuric acid solution of the desired concentration to give 
the required initial moisture content. After being left for at least 
three days, it was transferred as rapidly as possible to the inner 
box, covered with the weighed greased lid, and reweighed to determine 
the percentage moisture content. Then the heat measurement was 
carried out. 

However, because Bull*s data were obtained on vacuum dried 
samples, and because the water vapour adsorption apparatus used was 
also high vacuum apparatus, it was decided to determine if any dif¬ 
ference would be obtained for samples which were vacuum dried. Three 
samples which were dried by the method previously described were 
vacuum dried for two hours using an Aberhalden vacuum drying apparatus, 
commonly called a drying pistol, containing boiling water to heat the 
samples. After the samples were allowed to cool, dried air was admitted 
into the pistol through the series of driers mentioned in the previous 
procedure. The sample was then withdrawn from the pistol, covered 
with the weighed greased lid and reweighed to obtain the dry weight 
on this basis. These samples were found to be slightly drier than 
samples prepared according to Hedges* method and gave slightly higher 
values for the heat of wetting. All the previous data were corrected 
to allow for this difference. 

Cellulose 

To check the experimental procedure used, some n standard” 
cellulose as defined by Argue and Maass (11) was prepared and its 
heat of wetting was determined.

were on cotton linter samples. These were obtained from the Hercules 
Powder Company and were dewaxed with a benzene-alcohol mixture (6). 
Samples of this cellulose were then subjected to wetting and drying 
cycles. The heat measurements carried out were on samples which 
had undergone from 0 to 19 of these cycles. 

Each sample on v/hich a heat of wetting measurement was carried 
out, was removed from the desiccator containing phosphorus pentoxide, 
which was used for storing the samples, and placed in the inner box 
of the calorimeter. This procedure enabled the sample to pick up 
moisture from the air of the laboratory, so each sample was oven dried 
for two hours, using the same procedure as was used for the silk. 

The uniform drying gave samples on which comparable heat of wetting 


data could be obtained

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 


Calibration of Calorimeter 

The results of 14 determinations of the heat of solution 
of sodium chloride (seven with one quantity of reactants and seven 
with a different quantity, the ratio of salt to water being the same 
in both cases) gave an experimentally determined heat capacity within 
0.08 calories of the calculated value. This is considered to be a 
slight error, because although it amounts to about six parts per 
thousand for the metal calorimeter itself (calculated heat capacity 
13.09 calories), it only amounts to about 1 part per thousand for the 
total heat capacity of the calorimeter (including 50 ml. of accurately 
weighed water, which was the quantity used for all heat of wetting 
measurements). 

Silk 

The heat of wetting values obtained for silk are given 
in Table I and plotted in Figure 1, together with the four values 
reported by Hedges (5). All the results in Table I were obtained on 
the same basis of drying: two hours in a stream of dried air at 
105°C. 

It is difficult to estimate the accuracy of the results 
obtained, for though a uniform technique may give a high degree of 
precision, the results obtained would probably differ slightly for 
different workers. The method of handling the samples is extremely 
critical because of their great affinity for moisture. (It was found 
that the samples had to be cooled over phosphorus pentoxide the same 
length of time after removal from the drying oven in order to get 
reproducible results.) Some comparison of the degree of precision 
of our method of calorimetry with that of Hedges may be seen from

the following. 

The mean deviation of our three values for the heat 

of wetting values of dry silk is t 0.03 cal./gm. 

, while the mean 

deviation on Hedges 1 four values for the heat of 

’’wetting” of dry 


wool is t 0.4 cal./gm. (Mean value 24-1 cal./gm.) 


The theoretical limit on the accuracy of the temperature 
readings is * 1 x 10“4°C. In practice it was found to be about

t 4 x 10"4*>C. Thus for the initial and final readings necessary for 
each temperature rise, the accuracy would be about 1.5 parts per 
thousand for the largest temperature rises obtained (0.55°C), and 
about 17 parts per hundred for the smallest temperature rise 
(0.0048°C). 

It can be seen from Figure 1 that the plot of the heats 
of wetting of the "desorbed" samples (samples which are saturated 
with water in an atmosphere of 100$ relative humidity and are then 
partially dried over sulfuric acid solutions) falls slightly below the 
plot of the heats of wetting of the "adsorbed 11 samples. This corre¬ 
sponds to the hysteresis effect obtained in the water vapour adsorption- 
desorption isotherm (see Table III and Figure 2) but is the reverse 
of the results obtained by Argue (11) on cellulose. This leads to 
the conclusion that the effects occurring in the adsorption and 
desorption of water vapour on and from cellulose are not analogous 
to those occurring in silk. 

From the value obtained for the heat of wetting or immersion 
of a sample which is saturated with water vapour (the final "adsorbed" 
value listed in Table I) it is possible to calculate a value for the 
surface area of the silk according to Harkins 1 and Jura’s "absolute" 
method (12). This consists essentially of calculating the area of the 
surface film adsorbed on the silk from the heat liberated when the 
sample is immersed in water and the surface film energy is liberated. 

The value obtained was 7 square meters per gram of silk. (The error 
by our method of calorimetry is estimated as about 20$). However, 
swelling effects are also believed to occur when the silk sample is 
immersed in liquid water (3) so that the above surface area value is 
further in error. If however, another method of obtaining the surface

area is used (see the discussion following the water vapour adsorption 
data) a method of obtaining an estimate of the heat of swelling is 
available. 

As explained under the heading of "Preparation of Materials", 
it was decided to vacuum-dry some silk samples to determine whether 
drier samples could be obtained. This was found to be the case; 
three determinations showed that the oven dried samples contained 
0.20$ moisture on the vacuum dried basis. The value of 15.93 cal./gm. 
was obtained for the heat of wetting of the vacuum dried samples. 

All previous data were corrected to this basis of drying so that they 
would correspond to water vapour adsorption isotherms. The corrected 
data were replotted as calories per 100 grams of dry silk against 
moles of water per 100 grams of dry silk. The values reported in 
columns 1 and 2 of Table II were read from this graph. This procedure 
simplified the subsequent calculations and added little to the error 
involved. All values reported are for the "adsorbed" samples. 

The samples which have an initial moisture content give 
lower values for the heats of wetting because of the water vapour 
already adsorbed on them. Thus the differences between the mean heat 
of wetting of the dry samples and the heats of wetting of the samples 
with the initial moisture contents are taken as the heats of adsorption 
of the number of moles of water given in column 1 on 100 grams of dry 
silk (recorded in column 3). 

The values given in the fifth column (obtained by multiplying 
the data of columns 3 and 4) represent the heats of adsorption of one 
mole of water on an amount of dry silk sufficient to give the con¬ 
centration listed in the first column. 

The final column in Table II represents the partial molal

heats of adsorption (plotted in 

Figure 4). 

The values are 

obtained 


by evaluating 

graphically the tangents to the curve given by the data 

in columns 1 

and 3. The partial 

molal heat 

of adsorption is the 



heat of adsorption of one mole of water on an infinite amount of silk 


(great enough that the moisture content of the silk remains unchanged.) 


The results for the water vapour adsorption-desorption 
isotherm are included in Table III and plotted in Figure 2. Bull (4) 
and other workers ( 13 ) have obtained water vapour adsorption isotherms 
on silk — the chief purpose of repeating the work was to obtain the 
isotherm from the same batch of silk that was used for the heat of 


wetting measurements, so that comparable data would be ensured.

The plot of the isotherm in Figure 2 indicates that a smooth 
sigmoid shaped curve is obtained. It might be noted that the agree¬ 
ment with 3ull ! s isotherm (which was obtained by the desiccator method) 
is good, the two curves coinciding almost exactly. The chief difference 
appears to be that our isotherm exhibits slightly more hysteresis. 
Whether this is caused by the effect of the dibutyl phthalate used in 
the manometers of the apparatus, or because insufficient time was 
allowed to attain equilibrium remains to be determined. It was found 
that three to four hours were required to attain steady readings at 
each new vapour pressure; it might be worthwhile to double this time 

and see if any appreciable drift in pressure is obtained.

The BET plot of the adsorption isotherm is given in Figure 
3a. It gives a calculated monomolecular surface area of 157 square 
meters per gram of silk, compared to Bull's BET value of 144 m.2 per 
gm. 

A plot of the adsorption isotherm data' according to the 
Harkins-Jura equation (14) yielded a good straight line plot for 
relative vapour pressures greater than 0.5. The surface area of the 
silk calculated from the slope of the line (see Figure 3b) is 1.63 
square meters per gram. It might be noted that no attempt to apply 
the Harkins-Jura equation to a water vapour adsorption isotherm on 
silk was found in the literature. 

Using the above value of 1.6 m.2/gm. together with the amount 
of heat liberated by immersing a sample saturated with water vapour 
(see Table I), a value for the heat of swelling of silk of 0.015 
cal./gm. is obtained. The swelling effect is thus seen to be practi¬ 
cally negligible. 

The two surface areas calculated from the plots shown in 
Figure 3 are not inconsistent with the present-day concept of the 
adsorption process, though they differ from each other by a factor 
of nearly 100. 

Recent statistical treatments of the adsorption isotherm 
(15?16) have shown that the BET type of theory is based on the ad¬ 
sorption on localized sights, rather than the formation of a mobile 
adsorbed monolayer. Thus one would expect the BET plot of the water 
vapour adsorption data to give a straight line plot up to a relative 
vapour pressure of 0.5 (about as high as it goes on any type of 
adsorption process) for it is generally accepted that water vapour 
adsorption on proteins occurs first on the peptide linkages and

polar side chains (17) . (That the polar side chains alone are respon¬ 
sible for the formation of the adsorbed monolayer, with the peptide 
linkages having virtually no effect, was postulated by Pauling (18) 
but this interpretation has been questioned (19)). 

On the other hand, Harkins’and Jura’s interpretation of the 
adsorption isotherm is based on the assumption that a condensed film 
is formed. This may be the case for silk above 0.5 relative vapour 
pressure. Davis and McLaren (3) postulated a spectrum of sorption 
taking place on silk, with chemisorption being the predominant effect 
at lower vapour pressures, but still occurring right up to saturation 
vapour pressure and even when a saturated sample is wetted with 
liquid water. This could well be the case at lower vapour pressures 
but may be a negligible effect above 0.5 relative vapour pressure, 
as shown by the straight line plot in Figure 3b. 

The large difference between the two calculated surface 
areas can thus be accounted for on the basis of adsorption at low 
vapour pressures on specific sites of a large ’’internal” surface of the 
silk; for high relative vapour pressures, the internal surface is 
saturated, so that the only adsorption taking place is of the condensed 
film type. 

The plot of the free energy data given in the final column 
of Table III is given In Figure 4. 

Figures 4 and 5 represent the differential and integral values, 
respectively, of the heat, free energy and entropy of adsorption of 
water vapour on silk fibroin. 

From the differential heat values given in Table II and the 
differential free energy values, evaluated In Table III, the differ¬ 
ential entropy change is calculated by means of the formula

where T is the absolute temperature. 

The high differential entropy values for the monomolecular 
layer (shown in Figure 4), though not as great as found by Davis and 
McLaren (3), are still comparable to the entropy of freezing of water 
(20) and lead to the conclusion that the water is probably chemisorbed. 

No increase of the differential heat and entropy values 
was found as saturation was approached in contrast to the results of 
Bull (4). Bull interpreted the increase as a species of heat of 
solution, stating, n In the case of the insoluble proteins, silk and 
wool, the heat of solution arises from the freeing of segments of the 
peptide chain from the restriction in motion which was present in the 
dry state.' 1 The present results do not require such an interpretation. 

The integral heat values from column 3 of Table II and the 
integral free energy values, calculated by means of the equation 
&F = RTj' n ln x an 

where n is the number of moles of water adsorbed per 100 gm. of 
silk and x is the relative vapour pressure, lead to the integral 
entropy change: 

AS = 

T 

Davis 1 and McLaren 1 s integral AS curve increases in an 
almost linear fashion, contrary to the plot shown in Figure 5. One 
would expect a rapid increase in the initial entropy values if 
chemisorption is the predominant initial process. 

The above free energy and entropy functions were taken 
from a paper by Dole and McLaren (21) which contains a comprehensive 
discussion of the thermodynamics of water adsorption on proteins.

No results were obtained on the heat of "wetting" of wool. 

It was found that even after several hours had elapsed a temperature 
rise was still occurring, so that the method of calorimetry used to 
measure the heat of wetting of silk fibroin may be impractical for 
comparable heat measurements on keratin. 

Pure keratin is highly resistant to wetting by water (22), 
that is an advancing contact angle of greater than 90° is observed for 
water on a keratin surface. Thus, little or no "wetting 0 occurs when 
keratin is immersed in liquid water; the heat evolved is probably 
largely caused by the adsorption of the water on specific sites on the 
keratin molecule (16). 

Hedges' (5) method of calorimetry consisted of immersing 
a wool sample in a Dewar flask containing water, and using an up-and- 
down motion on a stirrer, to cause intimate mixing. Unfortunately, 
he gives no indication of the length of time required to attain equili¬ 
brium. However, it was probably much less than required by our method 
of calorimetry -- where the water-repellant surface of the wool 
contained in the inner box prevented any Intimate mixing with the 
water of the calorimeter. The use of a smaller sample to permit 
greater access to the water gave no improvement. Sven if reduction 
of the sample size had increased the rate of attainment of equilibrium, 
the theoretical accuracy of the method obviously would be reduced. 

Because of the inhibiting effect of air on the adsorption of 
water vapour by proteins (23), equilibrium could be attained much more 
rapidly using a vacuum calorimeter. Also because large temperature 
increases occur when water vapour is adsorbed on keratin (23) a type 
of calorimeter that ensures intimate mixing with water to prevent 
local heat effects should be used.

Cellulose 


The mean heat of wetting obtained from five samples of 
standard cellulose was 10.15 calories/gm. This compares with the 
value of 10.16 cal. obtained by Argue and Maass (11). 

The results obtained for the heat of wetting of cotton linter 
samples, which had undergone various numbers of wetting and drying 
cycles, are included in Table TV and plotted in Figure 6. Also 
shown in Figure 3 are the data for methyl&tion, nitration and water 
vapour adsorption obtained by Brickman (6).

It can be seen from the plot of the above data that the

obtained for methylated and nitrated samples. It does coincide with 
the plot of xvater vapour adsorption against the number of wetting and 
drying cycles obtained by Brickman.

WETTIN6 AND PRYING CYCLES 


PERCENT MOISTURE INCREASE 



PERC&NT NITROGEN 































The results for water vapour adsorption were obtained by- 
placing cotton linter samples which had undergone a varying number 
of wetting cycles in a common desiccator in an atmosphere of constant 
relative humidity. While the water vapour adsorption curve follows 
the same general trend as the heat of wetting curve, the results 
appear to be anomolous when compared to the results for nitration 
and methylation of the cotton linter samples. 

However, all the data on cellulose can be correlated by 
means of the following explanation. 

Dry cellulose is itself a desiccant comparable in strength 
to phosphoric pentoxide. Therefore, in an atmosphere of very limited 
relative humidity, such as is obtained in a desiccator over phosphoric 
pentoxide, where they were stored, the cellulose samples with the 
greatest accessibility will gain the most moisture. Therefore, when 
they are placed in an atmosphere of higher relative humidity and 
allowed to come to equilibrium, they will not gain as much moisture 
as the less accessible samples which picked up less moisture when 
stored over the phosphoric pentoxide. Similarly, the most accessible 
samples, when removed from the desiccator over the phosphoric pentoxide 
and placed in the calorimeter, will give smaller heats of wetting 
than will the least accessible samples because of the difference in 
initial moisture content. 

Thus, it can be seen that the samples showing the greatest 
accessibility to the nitrating and methylating reagents, would show 
the least values for water vapour adsorption and heat of wetting 
because of the moisture (even though a very small amount) obtained 
while stored over the phosphoric pentoxide. 

The relatively small heat of wetting obtained for the sample 
which had undergone no wetting cycles compared to the larger value

obtained for the sample which had undergone one wetting cycle can 
be explained as follows. 

To say that the sample had undergone no wetting cycles is 
an arbitrary statement. It had come into contact with sodium hydroxide 
solutions in the original purification process at the Hercules Powder 
Plant, which would tend toswell the samples. There is also some 
evidence that the benzene-alcohol mixture used to dewax the samples 
will also swell them. Thus, the low value for n zero n wettings is 
due to a relatively high accessibility which is offset by the zippering 
effect of the first wetting cycle. Subsequent cycles then increase 
the accessibility.
