FOREWORD 


For the past 2000 years, Mathematics has been 
utilized in one way or another by people in various 
walks of life. The question has often been posed 
as to the necessity of Mathematics teaching. Is it 
necessary for teachers to burden the young with 
abstruse and abstract ideas, when in all probability 
the amount of Mathematics required by any one child 
will be strictly limited to a knowledge of the four 
fundamental processes? The argument then boils down 
to "Lets just teach sufficient Mathematics, so that 
the child can get along in society." 

However, on deeper reflection we find that 
Mathematics plays a singularly important part in our 
every day living. Whether we like it or not, Math¬ 
ematics is continually with us. Ho aspect of every day 
living is completely devoid of it. 

If we accept the purpose of education In gen¬ 
eral as being that which enables each Individual to 
adjust himself to those elements of his environment 
that are of concern to him in modern life, and to 
develop, organize and train his powers so that he 


-iz- 










. 











: s 




may make efficient and proper use of them, then 
Mathematics will play an important part in ed¬ 
ucating the pupil. 

Clearly then, the aim of a Mathematics ed¬ 
ucation should be: 

(1) To give the pupils a mastery of those phases 
of Mathematics which are necessary for him in his 
social and material environment. 

(2) To enable an individual to recognize a math¬ 
ematical situation when he meets one. 

(3) To give each individual the mathematics 
necessary for his vocation. 

(4) To enable an individual to discover new and 
more efficient methods of procedure. 

(3) To give gifted individuals who plan on spec¬ 
ializing in Mathematics or related fields a mastery 
of the elements of Mathematics. 

(6) To enable the student to use Mathematics as a 
tool in solving the problems of his environment. 

To enable the right pupil to receive the 
right education from-the right teachers may be 
considered the aim of a good educational system. 


-x- 







Presupposing the right teachers we may define a 
right pupil as one whose personal attributes and 
opportunities enable him to profit fully from the 
education offered him. The right education is the 
one which is best suited to the needs of society 
and the pupil. The most obvious way of determin¬ 
ing the rightness of pupils and education is a 
task for the process of evaluation. 

Evaluation then serves as a tool by means 
of which we are able to guide a pupil into a de¬ 
sired or chosen field. Because of individual 
differences which exist between students, it is 
obvious that not all of them can be guided into 
the Mathematics field. 

Evaluation then, serves to: 

(1) Maintain standards. Standards furnish the 
means of social control and evaluation determines 
whether or not the standards are satisfied. 

(2) Select students. Selection prevents misfits 
from entering into vocations or studies for which 
they show no capabilities. 

(3) Motivate learning and guide teaching. 


-xi- 







(4) Appraise teachers, teaching methods, books 
and curricular content. 

Thus if -we are to teach Mathematics in our 
High Schools then we must evaluate.

CHAPTER I 


PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATION 

I The Examination as a Whole 

In June 1945, 2853 Grade XEI Students wrote 
an examination in Algebra 2. The examination was 
set on the material in the text “Senior Algebra’ 1 
by Dure 11 and Wright and edited by Dr. E. W. Sheldon 
and Mr. D. L. Shortliffe. The answer papers were 
marked and the ranking of the candidates and the 
division of the scores into groups was completed 
before this investigation was started. 

The raw scores obtained by the 2853 candi¬ 
dates ranged from 13 to 147* The following table 
shows the number of candidates whose scores fell 
within certain intervals. (The interval is 9 
raw scores.)

An Examination of this table shows that 1144 
candidates made a percentage mark of less than 50 , 
(fewer than 68 raw scores), after the raw scores had 
been adjusted to the score range 0-100; while 1709 
candidates made a percentage mark of more than 50 
after the raw scores had been adjusted. Further, 
of the 1709 candidates 720 of them obtained a mark 
of 65 or better, while 989 candidates received a 
mark of between 50 and 64. This latter group com¬ 
prised 35% of the total number of candidates.

II The Answer Papers 

The 300 papers used in this investigation 
were secured from the Department of Education. 

These answer papers represent all the candidates 
whose raw scores were 68 , 69 , 70 , 71 , 72,73 and as many 
with a raw score of 74 as was required to bring the 
total number to 300* These raw scores corresponded 
to a percentage score of 30 , 31 , 31 , 32 , 32,33 and 34 
respectively. 

The following table shows the range of scores 
(raw and transmuted) for the 300 cases with which 
this investigation is concerned.

III The Examination Paper 

The examination paper consisted of 53 ques¬ 
tions having a total value of 153 marks. It is 
significant to note that the highest raw score ob¬ 
tained by a candidate was 147. The first 34 ques¬ 
tions were of the Multiple Choice Type and answers 
were recorded as marks in suitable spaces on the 
provided sheet. This section of the paper was 
machine scored. The second half of the paper con¬ 
sisted of questions of the Problem-solving type. 

This part of the paper was hand marked. Each ques¬ 
tion in the first part of the paper was valued at 
2 raw scores. Questions on the second part of the 
paper were valued from 3 to 6 raw scores. 

IV Purpose of the Investigation 

The purpose of this investigation is to find 
out the matriculation standards as set by the pupils 1 
scores on this examination. From the data of Table 
II it can be seen that any candidate who secured 68 
raw scores received a percentage grading of 50* Thus 
it was not necessary to secure one half of the 153 
raw scores in order to get 50%» However, it must 
be remembered that no student was able to secure a 











































/ 


perfect score. 

Further problems which require attention in 
connection with the above named purpose are: 

(1) What does a pupil just at the lowest matricu¬ 
lation level, know? 

(2) How adequately has the examination covered the 
material of the text book? 

(3) On the basis of the course, was the examination 
a fair test? 

(4) On the basis of results for this group, was the 
division into groups as indicated by Table II a fair 


one? 







CHAPTER II 

DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURE 

As Previously stated, the 300 cases under 
consideration in this investigation comprise all the 
cases who received raw scores of 68 to 73, It was 
necessary in order to have exactly 300 cases to take 
34 cases whose raw scores were 74 . This ”74 raw 
score group” contained some 44 cases. The group was 
not sampled. The cases were taken in alphabetical 
order of last names of candidates as shown on the 
Examination application forms at the Department of 
Education, Examinations Branch. 

I Definitions 

(a) Positive Analysis 

The term f, positive analysis” as used in this 
dissertation will mean an analysis of the answer 
papers for correct scores. The 300 papers were met¬ 
iculously analyzed for the number of correct raw 
scores which a candidate was able to secure on any 
one question. In the case of the first 34 questa¬ 
tions this was a simple task. In considering an¬ 
swers to these questions no partial marks were given. 
The question was either wrong or received a perfect 


-8- 














' 








■ 



score, in this case, 2. 

The last 1? questions on the paper were of 
the "problem solving* type. Here the situation was 
entirely different. Partial scores were awarded 
for partial answers, and these were recorded. 

(b) Negative .Analysis 

The term "negative analysis" as used in this 
dissertation will mean an analysis of the answer 
papers for errors. Here too, as will be noted under 
the chapter headed "Negative Analysis", great care 
was taken to insure that all errors were recorded. 

The first 34 questions were of the "multiple 
choice type”. The correct answer was to have been 
selected from five given possible answers, only one 
of which was correct. Thus in carrying out an an¬ 
alysis of these questions, it is impossible to state 
definitely why a candidate answered as he did. 

Guess work in the solution could have been rewarded 
equally as well as an insight into the problem. 

Hence in the chapter dealing with the negative an¬ 
alysis. Respchses other than the correct ones are 
indicated as errors. 

The last 19 questions on the paper were of 












-10- 


the "Problem Solving type" and work was shown. Thus 
it was a relatively simple matter to check each 
problem to discover where the error was made. It may 
be noted here, that each problem was checked through 
to the final result and all errors in solution were 
recorded. 

(c) No Attempts 

In this dissertation a "No Attempt" will mean 
that the candidate omitted completely the question 
under consideration, i.e. there are no pencil marks 
or pen marks whatsoever to show that even a begin¬ 
ning was attempted* 

In certain of the problems, sketches were 
drawn or some attempt was made such as writing down 
the data of the problem in a different order to what 
it was in the problem. These are counted as attempts; 
the candidate must have done some thinking in regard 
to the problem. 

(d) Relationships 

The definition of the term "relationship" as 
used in this investigation can best be expressed by 
an example. Question number 14 which is a question on 
differentiation- d (2x-4)(xf3) requires a knowledge, 




































. 










I 








. 































-li¬ 


on the pupils part, of the implication of the term 

d “ the differential coefficient - in the solution 

35c 

of this problem. Thus a relationship involves a 
broad knowledge of the field of differentiation as 
in this example and the ability of the student to 
relate this problem to the general formula for diff¬ 
erentiation of a function. 

(e) Concepts 

A "Concept** as used in this dissertation will 
mean the vocabulary of the course which the student 
gains as a result of instruction. The vocabulary 
comprises all those technical terms which he meets 
for the first time in Algebra 2. Examples of con¬ 
cepts are the words "maximum", "undefined" etc. 

(f) Routines or Techniques 

These terms wall have a synonymous meaning in 
this investigation and they are defined as the ability, 
for example, to put a formula to work in order to 
arrive at an answer. They may aptly be termed the 
tools of the course. 

II Procedure 

The 300 papers used in this investigation are 
to be analyzed both positively and negatively, and a 
chapter of the dissertation will be given over to 














- 12 - 


each analysis. 

The text book will be analyzed and all the 
concepts, relationships and routines or techniques 
will be listed. The examination paper, too will be 
anyalyzed for concepts, relationships and routines 
and the number of marks assigned to each will be 
stated. The score given for each will be determined 
from the scoring key which was used in marking the 
papers. 

A chapter of the thesis will be given over to 
a comparison of text book coverage and examination 
coverage. This will determine just how much of the 
course the examination has covered. From these data, 
then, it will be possible to arrive at a statment 
of just how many raw scores the candidates were able 
to secure for each generalization concept and routine. 

A comparison, will be attempted, with the 
results of examinations in Algebra 2 in the years 
1935; 1938; 1940; 1941; 1942 and 1944, both as to 
correct scores and errors. The questions consid¬ 
ered on the examination papers of the years stated abov 































. 

- 




. 









' 










, 





















































- 13 - 


have been carefully selected and every effort has 
been made to select only those questions which are 
the same or nearly the same as those questions which 
appeared on the 1948 paper. It must be noted here 
that the cases selected for study for the years 1935; 
1938; 1940; 1941 and 1942 are totally different from 
the cases which were selected for study from the 1948 
paper. The closest approach to those under consider¬ 
ation in this thesis are the cases selected by Miss 
Miller in 1944. She selected 100 cases, which were 
all the students just above the 30> mark and includ¬ 
ing 30 %. Then too the examination papers of 1935; 1938 
1940 and 1941 were totally different from the exam¬ 
ination papers of 1942; 1944 and 1948. The latter 
three papers are very much the same in that the first 
25 to 30 questions of each paper are of the short 
answer type while the remaining questions on the 
paper involve problems which require a written sol¬ 
ution. The chapter dealing with Previous Belated 
Studies will give an indication of just how the 
sample cases considered were selected. 

A chapter of the Thesis will deal with just 
what percent of a topic the pupil knew on the oasis

of his results for certain questions. The course 
has been divided into 15 topics and questions 
dealing with each topic have been lumped to-gether. 
Finally by use of a weighted mean method, the number 
of raw scores obtained on the topic, can be arrived 
at and this in turn can be expressed as a percent.

CHAPTER III 

REVIEW OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS 

1 S ummaries of, .Investigations in the Mathematical Field 

Dr* Lazerte 

This Thesis by Dr* M* E. Lazerte is a summary of 
investigations which were carried on in the Mathematics 
field in Alberta. One of these investigations concerned 
itself with the Grade XCI Algebra examination of lune 

1935 • 

A random sample of 6 00 cases was considered. 

There were 200 cases from small country high schools, 

200 cases from larger country and town high schools and 
200 cases from city High Schools. The total number of 
candidates writing was l880. An Analysis of correct 
scores and an error analysis was made of 400 cases. An 
Error analysis was not made for the 200 students who 
attended town schools. 

1. Purpose of the investigation . 

(1) To ascertain where the pupils had difficulty In 
the new course and the types of errors made. (This 
course in Algebra had been offered for two shears only.) 

(2) To compare the achievement of country school 
pupils with that of city school pupils.

2. Results 

(A) There appeared to be outstanding defioien- 

cies in: 

(a) Graphing and sketching. 

(b) Differentiation and meaning and use of 
derivatives. 

(o} The limiting process. 

(d) The integration process. 

(e) Permutations and Combinations. 

(f) Expansion by the Power Series. 

(g) Summation of G. P. »s. 

Many errors were also made in spelling, the 
manipulation of decimals and fractions and the use 
of logs. 

(3) The students educated in small places showed 
consistently better progress and understanding than 
did students educated in the city - both in total 
marks on the paper and in success on individual ques¬ 
tions. For example city pupils excelled the country 
pupils in only 4 parts of questions out of a total 
of 18 parts.

11 A Repo rt on t he Al g ebra 5 Paper s of June 1938 

, S. W. Hooper 

Mr Hooper reviewed 32? papers, being a 
sample consisting of every eighth paper, ranging 
in marks from 0 - 100. In his initial remarks, Mr. 
Hooper concurs in the statement that the results 
showed, ” a lamentable and widespread ignorance of the 
most elementary ideas and manipulation in the course. !l 

The analysis of the papers dealt mainly with 
securing the number of correct answers and errors for 
the sample under consideration. Each question too 
was analyzed for the factors involved in a solution 
of the problem. A chapter of the dissertation is 
given over to a Summary of Errors. 

Following are the conclusions which were 
arrived at: 

(a) The paper appears well distributed over the 
years work. 

(b) The examination paper was too difficult. 

(c) The examination paper was too long. 

(d) The form of the paper - one question per 
topic - may be an unfair examination for 
this type of course. 

(e) The students T background may be such that the

proper teaching of Algebra 3 is an impossi¬ 
bility. 

(f) Past examinations have not encouraged high 
standards. 

Ill A Report on the Algebra 2 Paper s of 1940-1941-1942 

H, E. Miller 

The purpose of this investigation was to anal¬ 
yze the errors made by the students and to discover, 
if possible, the cause for the consistent low scores 
in these three examinations. 

No mention is made of how the papers were 
selected nor in what raw score or percentage range 
the papers fell. 

The papers were analyzed for: 

(a) Correct Solutions. 

(b) Did not attempt problem. 

(c) Common errors. 

(d) Miscellaneous errors. 

The following table shows the number of 
papers which were analyzed for each year: 

1940 - 297 

1941 - 309 

1942 - 322 




















- 19 - 


In summarizing results, Mr. Miller comes to 
the following conclusions: 

(1) The examinations were excellent in allotment 
of marks for each section of the text. 

(2) The problems on the examination seem to be 
fair samples of those in the text in regard to 
difficulty. 

(3) Some problems were relatively easy, and some 
problems were relatively difficult. 

The following table shows average results for 
different sections of the text book:

A section of the dissertation is given over 
to special weaknesses as shown by the results. Mr. 
Miller classifies errors as being of three types 
which he lists as Class A, B, or C errors. He de¬ 
fines them thus: 

(1) Class A errors - These reflect the prior train¬ 
ing of the student as well as current training e.g. 
Arithmetic operations. 

(2) Class B errors - Special Points of difficulty 
in the course e.g# understanding technical terns etc. 

(3) Class C errors - Topics which seem to offer 
difficulty. 

The following recommendations were made by 
the author: 

1. The most outstanding weakness is in simple 
arithmetic. Therefore the following remedies should 
be practised: 

a. Insisting on a higher standard in the lower 
grades. 

b. Short practise periods in fundamental oper¬ 
ations in the High Schools. 

c. Students should be taught to check results.

2. Teachers and examiners in marking papers should 
not allow nearly full marks for so-called mechanical 
errors* 

3* Students should he taught to use the graphs 
which they draw* 

4* The section on Annuities should he omitted or 
else treated more fully. 

IV Stude nt Attainment in the Algebra 2 Examinations 

of 1944 - Y. IT Hiller 

For this investigation. Miss Miller selected 
200 cases* One hundred cases were the students 
whose percentage mark was 39 and immediately above 
39 • The other one hundred cases were the students 
whose percentage mark was 30 and immediately above 
30. These were the students who were just able to 
obtain a 11 C w and !, B W grading respectively. 

In the positive analysis of the paper it was 
found that "B" students consistently did better on 
all test items than f, G n students with the exception 
of item 1 where t? C n students excelled students* 

In the negative analysis If B a students showed 
consistent superiority over "G 11 students* "However 
it must also be admitted that even H B W students did

not have an acceptable background for university 
Mathematics and Science. They showed weakness in 
carrying out elementary Mathematical operations 
and in the application of the principles of anal¬ 
ytical geometry to simple problems. 

Further, it was found that the test items 
differed greatly in difficulty. Some items were 
found extremely easy by both groups. Others were 
found too difficult by both groups and still others 
were found to differentiate between the two groups 
very well. 

In summing up her findings, Miss Miller states 
that perhaps the examination was a little too diff¬ 
icult. But taken as a mole, it was a valid test in 
the sense that it separated the students Into two 
groups consistently. 

The survey indicated a weak mathematical 
background for most students. It was recommended 
that perhaps teachers of mathematics might take 
more time to stress more of the fundamentals. More 
drill should be given on the fundamentals, and too, 
teachers should Insist on greater accuracy. Further,

the short answer questions distinguished the clearer 
thinking “B** students from the muddled thinking of 
"G 11 students. Group ’*0” students also left more 
items incomplete. This group also omitted many more 
questions because they lacked insight into these 
problems. 










CHAPTER IV 


POSITIVE ANALYSIS 

I Frequencies of Scores on the Various Test Items 

The following frequency tables indicate how 
many students received a given mark on any one test 
item. Questions 1 to 34 were worth 2 raw scores each. 
No allowance was made for partial answers. These 
questions were objective in nature and the correct 
answei. was to be selected from a group of 3 given 
answers. 

Questions 33 to 33 were problem type questions. 
Partial marks were given for a partial solution. The 
correct raw scores on these questions varied from 3 
to 6. 

In order to give an indication of how the marks 
on any one question were allocated, the correct steps 
in the solution of question 33 to 33 are also given. 
The solutions indicated are those as set down by the 
Examinations Board. Some inconsistencies in marking 
were noted and these will be discussed in a later 
chapter. 

The frequencies of correct scores and zero

scores are given as the number out of 500 , indicated 
in the column headed N. The frequency is also ex¬ 
pressed as a percent, as indicated under the column 
headed %* (Percentages are expressed to the nearest 
tenth*) 

Questions, which were not attempted (as de¬ 
fined under procedure) were given a score of zero*

II Graphs of frequencies of Scores 

The following graphs for questions 35 to 53 
indicate clearly the distribution of scores on any 
one given test item. 

Graphs for questions 1 to 34 are not included 
because the question in this objective part of the 
paper were either right or wrongi.e. there was no 
consideration given for a possibility that the can¬ 
didate might have had an idea of the operation in 
the question considered. 

N, as in Part I of this Chapter, refers to 
the number of candidates receiving a given score.

III Frequencies and Graphs of Perfect Scores 

The following graphs and frequency tables 
illustrate quite forcibly the ability of this group. 
Their ability at problem solving is very low. How¬ 
ever, the ability to select an answer from a given 
set of answers poses a relatively simple problem 
for these students. 

As before, N represents the total number 
of candidates making a perfect score on any one 
question*

I Errors 

The mechanical errors made by the candidates 
of this group were many and varied. In the follow¬ 
ing table the errors have been classified under 
appropriate headings. The following examples, taken 
directly from the answer papers, will serve to ill¬ 
ustrate the kind of errors which were made.

The following table shows the frequency of 
errors which candidates made on the paper* It 
may be noted here that t he frequency of mechanical 
errors is based on the written work which the 
candidate did on questions 35 - 53, inclusive. Of 
these 15 questions, questions number 37, 38 and 4-0 
are graph sketching problems, while question 42 is 
a question requiring written statements* Thus for 
these four questions no mathematical manipulation 
was necessary. In reality, then, the frequency of 
errors is based on 15 questions.

The results show clearly that mechanical 
errors are indeed the stumbling block to success, 
at least for this group. Further comments and 
recommendations will be given in the chapter deal¬ 
ing with conclusions. 

II ERRORS 

A) questions 1-34 

The following tables indicate the errors 
which were made on the different test items. As 
has been previously stated questions 1-34 are 
of the multiple choice type and choices other than 
the correct one have beencounted as errors. 

In each case, the question will be given and 
following this, the correct solution as set down 
by the Examinations Board.

On the whole Question 1 was very well done. 
However, there is no reason for answers which 4b 
candidates gave. A rigorous proof for this theorem 
in indices is given on page 163 of the Grade X 
11 Algebra for to-day”. A speculative reason for the 
response b. undefined can be given. In work on limits, 
the term, undefined has a definite meaning and after 
learning this, some students become conditioned to 
saying "undefined” whenever they encounter the 
symbol 0 .

The results show that this question has been 
very well done. The same question appears on page 
6 of the text Senior Algebra. The 33 candidates 
giving a. 3 as a solution were no doubt confused as 
to the difference between fourth proportional and 
continued proportion. This problem is one of two 
which was attempted by all candidates. The other 
question, on the paper, which everyone attempted was 
question 8.

As results indicate this question was only 
fairly well done. Problems of this type are found 
in the Grade X Algebra Text. In reality then this 
problem is a review problem, for grade XEI pupils, 
in the language of indices. This problem was taken 
directly from the Revision Exercises in the text, 

where it is question #1 in Exercise A. The poor

The results clearly indicate the weakness of 
candidates in regard to manipulating logarithmic 
equations. The topic of logarithms is optional in 
Grade X. As a result some students come to Grade XII 
Math without even the basic rudimentary notions of

Results for this question indicate a weak back¬ 
ground in the use of index notation. Students are 
introduced to the index notation on p. 169 of the Grade 
IX text. This work in indices is further amplified on 
p, 167 of the Grade X text. Problem 6 on Page 167 of t 
Grade X text has a problem similar to this one. On 
p. 137 of the Grade XII text, problem 2 in Revision 
Ex.. F is very much similar. Thus there should be no 
reason whatever for the weak showing of the candidates 

on this type of problem.

This question, involving a straight application 
of the formula for a differential coefficient, was 
exceptionally well done. However, the suggested 
answers should have contained an answer 8 for candi¬ 
dates who would have differentiated first without 
multiplying out the terras. 33% of the pupils failed 
to take the second differential coefficient as is 
indicated by response b. 12x*- 7 . Trouble with the 
index notation and indices in general may be ad¬

The ability to perform simple integration, by 
this group, is limited. Again, even though the process 

of integration, is understood, difficulty with exponents 
proves to be an insurmountable obstacle. The mechanics 
of the Arithmetic of small numbers is another factor 
which can account for wrong response. Those candidates 
who gave response b. 1 substituted for the 'fx directly 
without integrating. These students no doubt under¬ 
stood that the integration had already been carried 
out for them. The example on p. 91 of the text is 
similar to this problem.

Results indicate a rather sketchy knowledge of 
the finding of the number of terms in a Geometric 
Series. As before pupils did not seem to have a 
sufficient knowledge of logarithms and exponents to 
be able to cope with this situation: 2 71 1 = 2 

Those who gave a response of b. 6 in all probability 
expressed the n term as ar whence they would get 
2 - 2* and n s 6. There is no doubt but that 

the majority of students arrived at the correct 
solution by writing down the terms of the series

dorie much better than the problem dealing with permu¬

as one in Permutations while only 2.4% treated problem

discriminate a problem in permutations but not one in 
Combinations. Again, candidates had difficulty in

ever, the coefficients for a 3 and a* are equal in the

expansion of (a*-l} and it may have been that students 
wrote down the formula for the coefficient of 

a 4 viz n(n-l)(n-2)(n-3). « Those who gave response

The indicated results show a very poor know¬ 
ledge of functional relationships. Considering that 
the pupil starts out in Grade IX to express a func¬ 
tional relationship, and has further work of this type 
in Grade X, the results are disappointingly poor. 
Problems such as this appear on p. 43 of the Grade X 
course and p. 222 of the Grade IX test. A faulty 
background in signed numbers can be given as a reason 
for the wrong responses. One candidate placed marks 
in more than one space on the provided sheet and as a 
result the problem was marked as wrong•

paper indicates the muddled type of thinking which 
pupils of this group undergo when solving a problem 
of this type, "Since denominator always larger it

Of significance here is the one paper on which

then that at least one teacher has been demonstrating 
his knowledge of Math. 55 to his class. The work on 
series in Grade XII is so basic that the teaching 
of series in this manner is entirely unwarranted. 

It is entirely unnecessary to clutter up the pupils 
minds with these details of advanced courses. Pupils 
have a hard enough time of it to get the basic

continue with further academic training can hope for 

much success in the field of Mathematics. It is 

rather startling to think that 8 .y% of the candidates 

a-s' 

attempted to evaluate h by long hand multiplication. 
The mechanical errors made were mainly in multiplication 
addition and subtraction of decimals. 16 . 7 °/® of the 
candidates experienced difficulty in finding the logs 
and anti logs of numbers, possibly because of in¬ 
sufficient practise. This question was taken 
directly from the text, where it appears as question 
8 of Revision Exercise K, page 177*

Question 42. Given y = .f(x) 

a * State in word s the meaning of Ay. 

b* For a curve, state in words the geometrical 
interpretation of av

change in y. - 2 marks. 

b. For two points on the curve, is the slope 

ax 

of the line joining these two points - 1 mark. 

c. For a point on the curve, dy is the slope

Candidate showed, on the whole, little 
ability to express a generalization, 9% of the 
candidates knew how to go about finding A y but were 
unable to express this relationship in words. As 
results indicate there is a great deal of confused 
thinking by students of this group in regard to 
the whole topic of differentiation.. However, 
they are able to apply the formula for the 
differential coefficient with some ease.

From the indicated results, it is clear 
that this problem was handled poorly by candidates 
in this group. It is evident that fundamentals 
have not been thoroughly enough absorbed. 66% 
of the candidates were undable to achieve a solu¬ 
tion because of a limited knowledge of the funda¬ 
mentals required for this grade. Certainly no 
case can be built up for the 7% who did not 
recognize the problem as one in simple differen¬ 
tiation. Surprising enough is the fact that only 
2 candidates of this group did not attempt this 
problem. Four candidates integrated rather than 
differentiated. Problems 6 and 7 on p. 168 of 
the text are similar to this one.

The indicated results show clearly that 
pupils found this problem difficult, only 30% of the 
pupils were able to secure 30 % or more of the marks 
given for this problem. Mechanical errors again 
took a heavy toll. 20% of the candidates had diff¬ 
iculty in evaluation, Integration and the arithmetic 
of small numbers. 10% of the candidates were not 
aware of the problem for they either differentiated 
or substituted directly into the formula* Inability 
to read a problem carefully proved costly for 2.3% 
of the candidates. 7*3% of the candidates placed TT 
in their formula, but forgot to multiply the final 
result by it. Inability to state the limits of 
integration earned a zero score for 20.3% of the 
candidates. No marks were givsn unless the limits 
were correct. The upper limit ranged anywhere from 
1 to 3 while the range of the lower limit was 0 to 
3. Problems similar to this one appear on p. 92 of

is interesting to note that questions 25 and 46 are 
similar. 48% of the candidates received perfect marks

received perfect marks for question 46. Again, the 
inability to use logarithmic manipulation proved

This question was much too difficult for 
students of this group; 8?.4% of the candidates 
received a score of o. The major stumbling blocks 
in this question seemed to be the inability to 
find the limits of integration and secondly, to 
integrate the function. 10.3% of the candidates 
had no insight into the problem for they differen¬ 
tiated, found the volume or substituted directly 
into the function. Strangely enough those who 
substituted directly, had the right limits. A 
problem similar to this one is found on p. 93 
of the text.

CHAPTER VI 


Comparison of Re s ults With Previous Studi es 
For comparisons to be valid, they must be made 
between populations of equal ability and these pop¬ 
ulations under consideration must be subjected to the 
same tests. 

From a study of previous investigations in 
Algebra, 2 (Crade XII Algebra or Algebra 3) "the 
following data reveal the groups or populations which 
were used in each study: 

1. Albegra 3 Investigation of 1933 "A representative 
group of final examination papers written by Algebra 
3 pupils in 1933"• No mention is made of howthis 
representative group was selected, nor in what range 
of marks this group fell. 

2. An analysis of Errors made on the Departmental 
Examination in Algebra 3 of June 1933* The 6 00 cases 
used in this investigation were selected at random 
from approximately 1800, the total number of Algebra 
3 papers written in the Province in June 1935* 

3. A report on the Algebra 3 Paper of June 1938- 
The 329 papers were a sample consisting of every 
eighth paper in the % range 0 - 100. 


-I62- 










-163- 

4. A report on the Algebra 2 Papers of 1940, 1941 
and 1942. 

a. 1940-There were 297 papers in the sample lot 
for the 1940 Examination. No mention is made of the 
method of selection nor % range. 

b. There were 309 papers in the sample lot for the 
1941 examination. No mention of method of selection 
nor % range. 

c. There were 322 papers in the sample lot for 
the 1942 examination. No mention of method of 
selection nor score range. 

3. Student attainment in Algebra 2 Examination of 
1944-One hundred of the cases used in the study were 
all those whose raw scores were 42, 43, 44, 43, 46 
and 47 and as many students whose raw score was 48 
as were required to bring the total number of papers 
up to 100. One hundred of the cases used in the 
study were all those whose raw scores were 63 , 66 , 
67 , 68 and 69 and as many students whose raw score 
was 70 as were required to bring the total number 
of papers up to 100. These raw scores corresponded 
to percentages 30 to 33 * 

6 . Aa Investigation of the standards as set by the 
Grade XEI Algebra 2 Examination of June 1948. 








- 164 - 


The 300 cases used in this study were all those 
whose raw scores were 68, 69 , 70 , 71, 72, 73 and as 
many students whose raw score was 74- as were required 
to bring the total number of papers up to 300. These 
raw scores corresponded to percentages 3D to 34. 

Thus it is clear that the only valid comparison 
which can be made is between the 1348 study and the 
part of the 1944 study which deals with the 100 cases 
who just managed to get a B standing (30-64). These 
two groups then are similar in ability. However, it 
is evident that the tw T o tests were not similar. 
Therefore, only those questions have been selected 
for comparison which are alike. 

In the chapter dealing with conclusions 
(Chapter 2d), the general conclusions of former 
studies will be compared with the results of this 
study. 

The following table show the percentage of 
total marks which were allocated to different topics 
on the examination papers mentioned. It must be 
remembered that t he 1933 study was concerned with 
the old Algebra 3 course which was based on 
Crawford’s High School Algebra,

Thus it is evident that the emphasis of in¬ 
struction in the course has shifted from Binomial 
Theorem, Permutations and Combinations and Geometric 
Progressions in 1933 to Functions and graphs and 
Differentiation from 1935 on. 

Comparison of Resu lt s - 1944 and 1948

The total % error in 1944 was 9 while in 
1948 it was 18.7 i* e. there were twice a many errors 
in 1948 as in 1944. Of interest is the fact that 
these two problems were attempted by all pupils. 

It must be remembered that there were 100 cases in 
1944 in this range as against 300 for 194-8. Thus

The results indicate possibly that the 1944 
question is on the whole more difficult than the 
1948 question. Then too, one must consider the 
elements involved in the two questions. The 1944 
question involves recall while the 1948 question 
requires an element of recognition. Even with these 
factors involved, the results are not too much at 
variance as an examination of table Ila would indicate. 

Ill a. Question 3-1948 Which ratio has the greatest 
value a. 11/12, b. 47/48, C. j/6, d. 23/24,

The two question , although not the same, 
involve fraction work. As previously stated the 1948 
question is found in the Grade VII text. Thus there 
is mo reason whatsoever for Grade XII students even at 
B level to have difficulty with simple problems such 
as these. Results were better in 1944 than in 194*8, 
but still one should expect 100% accuracy from 
students who have been in school for 12 years or 
more and whose next step is University.

The two questions have been designed with a 
view of testing pupils knowledge of limits. In one 
case the value is asked for and in the other the 
limits. Thus there is some broad basis for comparison. 
However, it must be remembered that the answers were 
given in 1948 but not in 1944. Some pupils no doubt 

become conditioned to saying ,} undefined lf wherever they 
meet the symbol o. On a broad basis then, 1944 
students were better able to handle the concept of 




















- 173 - 


limits as the results in table V a have indicated, 

A reason for the poor showing in 1948 may be due to 
the fact that pupils guessed.

deals with direct variation while the 1944 question 
deals with inverse variation. On the whole problem

Of interest is the faot that only one candidate

a. -1/8, b. tL7, e. l[65, d. -8/7, e. 8/7 - 2 marks 

b. Question 11-1944 Find the gradient of the 
straight line which has x and y intercepts, 3 and~2 
respectively.

Again, there is possibly no basis for a com¬ 
parison. 'Question 11 - 1944 is more difficult than 
question 12 - 1948. In 1948, the two points were 
given while in 1944, the points were given as inter¬ 
cepts, on the x and y axes. As results indicate, the 
1948 candidates were much superior to the 1944 can¬ 
didates in regard to finding the gradient of a 
straight line through 2 points.

Again, the questions are not strictly similar. 
In 194-8, the roots were given and it was an easy 
matter to substitute in the given equation to find 
the correct one. This is evidenced by the number 
of correct solutions. The 194-4 question was rela¬ 
tively easy, and results should have been much 
better. Questions similar to the 1944 question 
appear in G-rade X Algebra.

Question 14 - 1948 is a little more difficult 


since it involves multiplying (2x-4) by (x*3) and 
as lias already been pointed out numerous algebraic 
multiplication mistakes were made by this group. 
Question 12 - 1944 is a great deal easier, and as 
a result the 1944 group holds a slight advantage 
over the 1948 group.

These two questions have been designed to 
test the candidates knowledge of definite integrals. 
There is no doubt but that the 1948 question is on the

The 1944 question is on the whole more diff¬ 
icult than the 1948 question. Pupils of this group 


are well able to handle numerical cases as is illustrat 
by the good shov/ing made by the 1948 candidates. It 
is always more difficult to wrk in terms of algebraic 
quantities for pupils of this category. On a broad 
basis of comparison, then, 1948 candidates were better 
able to handle this type of problem.

as a result there was an opportunity for more errors.

select the correct series while in the 194-4 problem 
the data had to be abstracted from the series. On

while the 1948 question did not have a negative

The two questions have been chosen for com¬ 
parison because they both ask for the expression of 
area as a function of a given side. The 1944 question 
is possibly a bit more subtle because the side has to 
be found from the perimeter. The 1948 question on 
the other hand involves a reading problem for the 
candidate even though the side is given directly. 

Again the answer to the 1948 question was in front 
of the candidate and this may account for the rela¬ 
tively large number of correct responses as compared 
with the 1944 group. From an examination of the re¬ 
sponses given for the 1944 question, it is evident 
that if the correct answer had been given the candidate 
he could have eliminated a great many of the answers 


which he got.

XIX a. Question 36-1948 The safe load !, W" (tons) 
for a beam varies jointly as the thickness w t w (inches) 
and the square of the depth "d” (inches) and in¬ 
versely as the length "£ " (feet) between the supports. 
If the safe load for a beam 6 inches thich, 10 inches 
deep and 12 feet long is 3 tons, express W in terms 
of t, d and i - 

2 

Correct Solution W = td -4 marks. 

lojt 

b. Question- 28-1944 The electrical resistance 
of a wire varies directly as its length and inversely 
as the square of its diameter. If the resistance of 
an 8 foot wire having a diameter of 1/10 of an inch 
is 2 ohms, find the resistance of a 10 foot wire made 
of the same material and having a diameter of l/l 6 
of an inch. 


Correct Solution 6.4 ohms - 6 marks.

These two questions dealing with joint 

to 

variation are similar up‘the point where the 
candidate has to find the variation constant. The 
1944 question involves the application of the 
formula which the candidate has derived while the 
1948 question does not require this. On the whole 
candidates in 1944 were superior to the 1948 group 
as is evidenced from Table XIX a.

The two questions are very similar. Results 
indicate a limited knowledge of graph sketching by 
both groups. On the whole these problems were too 
difficult for both groups. From an examination of 
the data, 1948 candidates were probably superior 
to 1944 candidates in graph sketching.

From the table it is evident that the 194-4 
question is the more difficult of the two and there 
is no valid basis for a comparison. Both groups 
performed very poorly on this question. However, 
the 1948 group were able to achieve more partial 
scores than the 1944 group.

question can be found directly from the tables. Eve 
so, only 33% were able to do so. The 1948 questions

The two questions are dissimilar and there 
is no doubt but that the 1948 question is more 
difficult. However, the showing of the 1944 can¬ 
didates is not very good. Surprising enough is the 
fact that students leave Grade X, after working 
dozens of examples in the solution of equations, 
only to come to Grade XII and regard the solution 
of equations as something which they had never 
seen. Results are very poor for both groups.

These two questions are very similar. How¬ 
ever, the directions as given in the 1948 question: 
(first payment due one year from now) may account 
for the relatively good standing of the 1948 can¬ 
didates as compared to the 1944 candidates. However, 
if pupils are taught to draw a time line for questions 
of this sort then there would be very little diff¬ 
iculty in finding the correct number of years that 
an annuity has to run. On the whole, the showing 
of 1944 pupils is inferior to that of the 1948 can¬ 
didates. It is interesting to note that in each 
year 15 % of the candidates attempted their respective 
problem as one in Present Worth while the number of 
confused attem.pts was higher in 1944 than in 1948# 
Mechanical errors accounted for 26 % of the candidates 
losing marks in 1948 while only 9% lost marks on this 
account 1944.

As results indicate, pupils of both years made 
an extremely poor showing on the question. The 194-8 
question was more involved than the 194-4 question* 
There is some doubt as to the advisability,of teach¬ 
ing this section of the text. Invariably candidates 
have difficulty with understanding the concepts in¬ 
volved. Possibly this time could be spent to better 
advantage on other portions of the course. However, 
there is no denying the value of this section of the 
course to students who will want to go on to further 
study.

The 1948 candidates were able to secure better 
scores than the 1944 candidates on the following 
1948 questions (See table XXX for corresponding 1944 
question). Number 3,8,11,12,13,20,26,28,29,31,33,37, 
39,44,46,48,33* Thus of the 29 questions compared, 
the 1948 candidates did better on 17 of these. 
Conclusions 

On the basis of the comparisons, it would 
appear that the 1948 candidates are sujjerior to 
the 1944 candidates. However, extenuating eircumstanc< 
must be considered in orderthat the comparison be 
valid. 

(1) It must be borne in mind that the questions 
considered are not exactly similar. An indication 
has been given of this in the comments on each 
comparison. 

(2) The 1948 Examination paper consisted of. 34- 
multiple choice questions and 19 problem solving 
type questions. There is no doubt that multiple 
choice questions, which involve an element of 
recognition, are easier. The psychological effect 
on the pupil must be, a heartening instead of a 
disheartening one. The 1944 Examination paper 












-230- 


consisted of 23 short answer type questions. The 
answer and possible answers were not given. This 
type of question then involves an element of recall. 
There were 19 problem-solving type questions on the 
194-4 paper. 

If we disregard the first 34 questions of the 
1948 paper and compare results on the problem-solving 
portion of the paper, we note that the 1948 candidates 
were superior to the 1944 candidates on 6 of the 11 
questions compared. 

(3) During the War Years, the length of the school 
year was shortened to allow students to help out on 
the farms and in industry. The 1944 candidates then 
received less instruction than the 1948 candidates. 

(4) Many teachers were away on war service and as 
a result inexperienced teachers were teaching high 
school. In all probability the standard of instruction 
in 1948 was superior to that of 1944. 

( 3 ) There were more candidates writing on the 
1948 paper than on the 1944 paper. 

Thus the reader can judge for himself the val¬ 
idity of the comparisons made. There is no doubt that 
results for both groups are poor and make one wonder 
as to the advisability of allowing students just at 
the matriculation level to proceed to further Academic 
studies in the field of mathematics.

CHAPTER VII 


I Text Book Analysis 

The text book used in this course - Durell 
and Wright "Senior Algebra" edited by Dr. E. W. Sheldon 
and D. L. Shortliffe, has been in use since the fell 
of 1933* In view of modern trends in text books 
there is no doubt but that the text book should be 
revised. For example, there should be more practise 
exercises on the fundamentals of calculus e.g. integ¬ 
ration. Then following this practise on simple in¬ 
tegration should some the differential equations. The 
practise exercises should be simple. It is the writers 
belief that a great many of the errors made in integra¬ 
tion are due primarily to insufficient practise. Again 
the section dealing with Annuities should have many 
more short practise exercises.

when the value of x is known, can be represented 
by the symbol f(x ), which is shorthand for "a

the rate at vfoich the function is increasing for any 
value of x is represented by the slope of the tangent 
to the graph at the point corresponding to that value 
of x, provided that units used in drawing the graph 
are taken into account. 

8. It is possible to have a function of x to which 
for one or more special valj.es of x, no meaning can 
be given. 

9. The equation of the straight line through (o,b) 


having gradient m is y - mx -t* b.

(x,y) having gradient m is y-y, = m (x-x,)

28. If the graph obtained by plotting y against x 
is, or approximates to, a straight line, and if (x„y), 
(x z y jL ) are two points on it, preferably at opposite 
ends, then y can be expressed as a function of x by 
the equation: y-y, = x-x, 

7. -y*.

2 % If the graph obtained by plotting y against x 
is.a curve, it may be possible to obtain a straight 
line by plotting: 

a. log y against log x. 

b. log y against x. 

e. y against log x. 

d. y against l/x, etc. 

30. Where the data are experimental, coeffieients in 
the functional relationship should be expressed as

II The following are the definitions vhich the text 
hook gives for the technical terms: 

( 1 ) The ratio of two numbers a, b is measured by the 
fraction a/b and is often written a:b 

( 2 ) If a/b = c/d, the numbers a, b, c, d are said to 
be in proportion. 

(3) If a/b = c/d, then d is called the fourth 
proportional to a, b, c. 

( 4 ) If a/b = b/c, then 0 is called the third 
proportional to a, b. 

(3) If a/b — b/c, then b is called the mean 
proportional between a, b. 

(6) If a/b - b/c = c/d = d/e = etc, a,b,c,d,e are 
said to be in continue d proportion . 

(7) The ratio equality x/d - y/b = z/c * w/d = ..... 
can also be written in the for x: y: z: w: ... = 

a; b: c t d» .....

a series, the limit is called 11 t he sum, to infinity” 


of the series 















-250- 


(59) Such a function as ( 1 . 05 ) is called a 
growth function because it represents the mag¬ 
nitude of a quantity which increases in cuch a 
way that its growth over a definite period is 
proportional to its magnitude at the beginning. 

( 60 ) $ x at 3% per annum compounded annually, 

amounts to |>x (1.03) at the end of two years. Here 

the hpx is called the present or cask valu e of 
z 

|x (l.O^ ) due in two years.

future sum of money is called di scounting the future 
sum. 

( 63 ) annuity is a succession of equal sums of 
money due at equal intervals of time. 

(64) A perpetuity is an annuity that has an unlimited 
time to run. 

( 63 ) When an arrual income or outgo that is regarded 
as a perpetuity is discounted, it is said to be 
capitalised.

I I. Analysis of the Examination Paper 

The following section deals with the analysis 
of the 194-8 Examination paper. The analysis is made 
on the same basis as that on which the analysis of the 
text book was made. It is reasonable to expect that 
not all of the routines or concepts contained in the 
text book can be tested on a paper requiring three 
hours for completion. In each instance the question 
involving t te relationship, concept or technique will 
be given together with the mark ailoted. For example 
in order to solve question 9> a candidate must know 
the meaning of the word "undefined”. This word 
appears as part of the vocabulary for the course. 
Therefore two marks have been allotted to this word 
on the basis of the candidates knowledge of the word. 
Again, question 48 requires that the candidate find the 
cash value of an annuity at maturity. This is a 
routine which the candidate has learned. Therefore 
four marks have been allotted for this routine. Three 
Three marks have been allotted to Geometric Series under 
Relationships because the candidate must also have 
a knowledge of Geometric Series in order to solve the 
problem. In the same manner marks have been dis¬ 
tributed under vocabulary i£ the following manner

for question 48: a* annuity - 1 mark. b. accumulates 
l.mark. c. compounded annually - 1 mark. d. maturity 
1 mark. e. payee - 1 mark. An attempt has been made 
to allot marks in each case on the basis of the 
marks allotted for correct solutions as set down by 
the Examinations Board. Thus in no instance will 
the total marks given for the paper ( 153 ) be the 
total given for knowledge of relationships, or 
routines, or concepts.

CHAPTER VIII 


Pupils 1 Mastery of Relationships, Conceitts and Routines 

This chapter gives an indication of howveil 
each relationship, concept and routine has been mast¬ 
ered by the candidates in light of the correct and 
partial scores which they were able to secure. For 
example, Relationship 1 deals with a knowledge of 
ratio and proportion. Questions 2,3,4- a ^d 35 of the 
examination paper have been designed with a view of 
testing candidates knowledge of relationships involv¬ 
ing ratio and proportion. Question 2 deals with 
fourth proportionals; question 4 with finding a ratio 
and question 35 with ratio inequalities. These four 
questions have a total score of 10 marks allocated 
to them. Thus for 300 papers the total mark would 
be 3000 i.e. if each candidate was able to secure 
perfect scores for each question. The following 
table indicates the scores which the candidates made 
on each question dealing with this relationship.

Each relationship, Concept and Routine will 
be treated in a similar manner.

CHAPTER L 


buramary and Conc lusions 
I Validity of the Test 

As has already been noted, student success 
in the various thest items varied greatly. Some 
questions were extremely easy as for example question 
8 for which 95*3% of the candidates were able to 
secure a perfect score. In contrast to this is 
question 39 where only 0.7% of the candidates were 
able to secure a perfect score. 

Examination items can be classified as ex¬ 
tremely easy, easy, relatively easy, difficult etc. 
However, many factors enter into the setting up of 
criteria for such a classification. Because of 
individual differences, no two pupils will find the 
same question easy. 

The classification which follows is somewhat 
arbitrary. It should also be remembered that these 
students are at the minimum matriculation level. 

In the table which follows, the criterion 
adopted has been whether 70 % or more of the can¬ 
didates have been able to secure perfect scores. 

These will be called the Easier items.

Thus it may be noted that the easier items 
were all from the multiple choice part of the 
paper. They comprise slightly more than of the 
total number of questions on this part of the paper. 
It is interesting to note that no questions appear 
in the above list from the second half of the 
paper (questions 35-53). 

In the table which follows, the criterion 
adopted has been whether 50%-69% of the candidates 
have been able to secure perfect scores. These 
will be called the relatively difficult items.

There were only two questions in this list 
from the first part of the paper. Of the 19 ques¬ 
tions in the second, part of the paper, 16 appear in 
this list. 

The criteria adopted here has been arbitrary. 
From an inspection of these four tables it is evi¬ 
dent that pupils found the questions on the second 
half of the paper difficult or extremely difficult. 
From this it may be inferred that the problem 
solving ability of students of this group is strictly 
limited. 

The following table shows the % of candidates 
who were able to secure $0% or more of marks awarded 
for any one problem. For obvious reasons, questions 
1-34 are not included here.

From a perusal of the examination papers of 
1933 , 1933 , 1938 , 1340, 1341, 1342, 1344 and 1348 
there is no doubt whatsoever in the writers mind 
as to the relative difficulty of the 1348 paper. 

In a comparison, on the basis of whether or not the 
questions were taken directly from the text book, the 
1348 paper was found to be the easiest of the 8 papers 
compared. The test is certainly a valid one as can 
be seen from Fig. I p*3, for it consistently placed 
students into different categories. From an exam¬ 
ination of Tables CXLIX, CL, CLI, CLII, CLIII; 

Chapter X there is no doubt whatsoever that the 
group under consideration has been placed in its 
proper category. From the results as shown in 
Table CLIII, the- writer holds the opinion that this 
category is too high and that these students should 
be in Category ,f C n i.e. holding a pass entitling 
them to a High School Diploma but not eligible for 
University Entrance,

II Was the Examination a Fair Test 

The relative difficulty of the paper can be 
judged from the following table. This table shows 
the number of questions which candidates attempted. 
N represents the number of candidates who attempted 
the number of questions as given in the column "No. 
of questions attempted".

Thus, on the average 50. 7 questions were 
attempted by each candidate. Therefore, on the 
basis of this table the examination was a fair test. 

III How Adequately Has the Examination Covered the 
Course? 

From an examination of Chapter VII, VIII and IX 
there is no doubt that the Examination covered the 
course quite thoroughly. Some parts which were 
omitted are cited here: 

1. Differential equations. 

2. Growth functions. 

IV What does a Pupil at the Lowest Matriculation 
Level Know? 

Chapter VII, VIII, and IX contain this in¬ 
formation, and it will not be repeated here. 

V T he Standard 

An examination of Table II, Chapter I reveals 
that 60% of the candidates received a n B” standing 
or better i.e. 50% or better while 40% received a 
»0 n standing or less i.e. less than 50 %. In other 
words 60% of those who wrote Grade XII examinations 
were eligible to enter University. On the basis 
«»C U standing qualifies a student for a 


that a 











- 287 - 


" H igh School Diploma”, 83 . 3 % of the candidates 
passed the examination in Algebra II. This leaves 
14.^% of the candidates who failed completely. 

An examination of literature dealing with 
"Intelligence and School Success" and Intelligence 
and College Success, reveals the fact that on the 
average 31 % of the population has an 1 . 4 . of 110 
or more. 

Gates and Jersild in "Educational Psychology" 
have advanced the figure of an I. Q,. of 120 for 
success in college i.e. "It is probable that an I.Q,. 
of at least 120 is needed to do acceptable work in a 
first class college with an average expenditure of 
time and energy." If we set the I.Q,. necessary 
for college success at 110 , we note that only 31 % 
of the population is able to succeed in college. It 
is true that pupils have been selected to some extent 
before they reach Grade XII but on the whole a 
greater portion of the youth of today is going to 
school than ever before. Gates and Jersild give a 
figure of 100 I.Q,. as necessary for success in High 
School. On the average 33% of the population has 









- 288 - 


an I.Q,. of 100 or more. Thus on the basis of these 
figures, the figure of G0% passes, i.e. eligibility 
for University entrance in 1948 is too high. It is 
true that we assume that those just at the Matricu¬ 
lation level will not attempt University but why 
should we give them this certificate and place them 
on the same level as an Honors Student. 

Because of the method by means of which we 
allow this great number of students to pass, there 
is no doubt that we are allowing our standards to 
drop. An examination of the results of Chapter IX 
and X will bear this out. 

An examination of the following two tables 
will further bear out the fact that the Standards 
required for a pass are low. In conjunction with 
these, it must be borne in mind that on the average 
a student attempted 30.7 questions.

YI General Conclusions and Comparison with General 
Conclusio n s of Former Studies. _ 

From a perusal of Tables CXLIX, CL, CLI, 
and GUI, Chapter X it appears that there are 
outstanding deficiencies in the ability of students 
in the following: 

1. The limiting process. 

2. Logarithms and Logarithmic manipulation. 

3. Solution of problems involving ratio inequal¬ 
ities. 

4. Graph sketching. 

3. Difficult integration. 

6. Difficult differentiation. 

7 . Permutations and Combinations. 

8. Accumulated value of annuities. 

9 . Geometric Progressions. 

10. Approximations using the Binomial Theorem. 

11. Maxima-Minima. 

12. Empirical Formulae. 

I. In a general comparison with Dr. Lazerte*s 
conclusions in 1933 > the deficiencies of students 
then seems to be the same as the deficiencies of 
students in 194*8. 











. II. The conclusions reached by Mr. Miller in 
194-0-194-1 and 194-2 are similar to the conclusions 
which can be drawn from the 194-8 examination. 

(1) The examination was excellent in allot¬ 
ment of marls for each section of the text. (The 
194-8 examination followed the trend of past exam¬ 
inations in this regard). 

(2) The problems of the examination seem to 
be fair samples of those in the text in regard to 
difficulty. 

(3) Some problems were relatively easy and 
some problems were relatively difficult. 

The following table shows the results from 
the standpoint of % of correct responses on any one 
topic in 1940-1941-194-2 and in 1948.

A comparison between results is not valid 
because of differences in selection of population, 
different types of examinations etc. 

The most outstanding weakness found in 1940- 
1941 and 1942 was in simple Arithmetic. This is a 
parallel situation with, the 1948 results. 
































- 294 - 


Thus, broadly speaking results of former 
studies, although no strict comparison can be made, 
seem to be similar to the finding in 1948. Again, 
mention must be made of the difference in examin¬ 
ations and the manner in which the cases under con¬ 
sideration were selected. 


VII Marking 

Greater care should be exercised by the 
persons who are marking papers to assure that can¬ 
didates are given full marks for treatment of prob¬ 
lems. Instances were found (see Negative Analysis 
Questions 39-93) where candidates were not given 
sufficient marks. Markers are too prone in many 
cases to award marks for work in the column of the 
Examination booklet headed "Hough Work Only ( No 
marks for works in this space)". 

The following example of an actual case 
illustrates what can happen when improper attention 
is paid to marking. 









- 295 - 


This candidate, vdiose raw score was 70 , 
received a final % grading of 51 . The candidate 
attempted Problem 49 for which 3 marks were given* 
The solution was incorrect and yet 8 marks were 
awarded for the question. Thus this candidate 
received a bonus of 8 marks. In reality then, 
his -raw score should have been 62 which corres¬ 
ponds to a % grading of 44 . 

VIXI lie comm e ndations 

1. The investigation has revealed that students 
in this category have a weak mathematical back¬ 
ground. The great number of mechanical errors 
indicates that there should be an insistence on 
the part of teachers of Mathematics upon accuracy 
of details. This should not be left till Grade 
XII but should begin with the students first days 
in school. 

2. The text book which is being used should be 
revised so as to include more practise exercises 

on fundamentals of the course. Mention has already 
been made of the lack of exercises on integration. 



























- 296 - 


3* The weakness of students in logarithmic 
manipulation and calculation shows that this topic 
should he dealt with in Grade XII. Teachers of 
Mathematics should insist on accuracy in calculation 
by logarithms. 

4. The basic ideas of significant figures should 
receive some attention in Grade XII. 

3* The disparity between the results of Part I 
of the examination i.e. the multiple choice part 
of the examination seems to suggest that the Multiple 
choice type of question might be replaced by the 
short one step type of question which was used prior 
to 1946. 

6. following are some suggestions for possible 
future studies: 

(a) To find the correlation between candidates 
I.^. *s and Algebra scores. 

(b) Setting of a final Algebra 2 examination 
similar to that of 1933 for example and then com¬ 
paring results with the 1933 study. 











- 297 - 


7. The investigation has revealed that candidates 
are being allowed a "B" standing in Algebra 2 with 
a very limited knowledge of Mathematics and the 
Algebra 2 Course. As a "B” standing allows these 
students to continue with higher academic training, 
there is no doubt that if we allowed these students 
to enter University, the standards of the University 
will be perceptibly lowered in time. Many suggestions 
have been offered as to how this situation could 
be remedied i.e. to keep University standards high. 
Following are some suggestions: 

(1) That the university consider applications 
for admittance from ,f H tf and ,f A n graduates only* 

(2) That two examinations be given in Algebra 
2, for example - one for those who wished to con¬ 
tinue on to University, the other for those who 
wish a High School Diploma only. 

(3) That each University faculty set up a 
committee to interview prospective students inter¬ 
ested in studying in the faculty. The writer favors 
this method and feels that the suitability of a 
candidate cannot be gauged by an impersonal figure 
















• {

on a transcript. Then too the committee, acting 
as guidance officers could steer the prospective 
candidate, if he were not suitable, into a field 
where he could succeed.
