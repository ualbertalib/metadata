SYNOPSIS 


Ammonium sulfate fractionation of water-soluble pea 
proteins served only to vary the concentrations of the various 
protein components in the different fractions© 

Under the experimental conditions employed, diffusion 
and viscosity results indicate that the molecular state of dispersed 
pea protein was not altered within the temperature range studied© 
Protein of whole squash seeds was poorly dispersed by a 
number of solvents* This low dispersal was apparently due to the 
low solubility of the globulin fraction in these solvents* Tem¬ 
perature had a marked effect on the peptization since more protein 
was dispersed at room temperatures than at refrigerator tempera¬ 
tures© Electrophoretic patterns were obtained for squash protein 
dispersed in various solvents* 

Squash globulin was crystalli z ed and analysed electro- 
phoretically. It was essentially electrophoretically homogeneous 
in every case except when dispersed in sodium acetate at pH 1^*7 
when two distinct, well-resolved components were evident* 

Attempts to use electrophoresis as a method of diagnosis 
of leaf roll virus infection in potatoes were unsuccessful© The 
Waring Blendor was found inadequate for extraction of leaf pro¬ 
teins from fresh material and when lyophilized leaf material was 
extracted, the resulting extracts were too highly pigmented for 
electrophoretic analysis.

PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OP PLANT PROTEINS 


C. R. Fuerst 


INTRODUCTION 


The plant proteins dealt with in this thesis are of 
three distinct kinds, namely, pea seed protein, squash seed pro¬ 
tein, and a virus protein of potatoes* The section on pea pro¬ 
teins represents a continuation of work which had been started 
in this department a few years ago, whereas the electrophoretic 
results presented here on squash protein are original as only one 
paper dealing with electrophoretic investigations of squash pro¬ 
tein has been found in the literature* The last part of the 
thesis describes attempts to use electrophoretic analysis as a 
quick method of diagnosing virus diseases of growing plants. 

The virus disease taken for investigation was leaf roll of po¬ 
tatoes.

PEA SEED PROTEINS 


LITERATURE REVIEW 


The proteins of legume seeds have been investigated 
by workers in the academic field and also by industrial workers 
since plant proteins are used in commercial products such as 
paints, plastics, and adhesives* Soybeans, peanuts, and peas 
are the legumes which have been most thoroughly investigated as 
to protein peptization* Consequently, studies on the chemical 
and physical properties of proteins from these legumes are nu- 
merous * 


Soybeans 


Smith and Circle (82) found acids to be no more effec¬ 
tive than water in extracting soybean protein* Alkali, when 
used at moderate concentrations, was the most effective dispersing

agent since it extracted 95 $ of the total soybean meal nitrogen# 

In salt solutions of low concentration pH showed a marked effect 
with minimum extraction at the ’’isoelectric point”, but this effe¬ 
ct decreased as the salt concentration increased# Smith, Circle 
and Brother ( 83 ) report the amount of nitrogen extracted by 
water to be the very high value of 90 % which was more than that 
dispersed by neutral salts* The concentration of the salt used 
influenced nitrogen peptization# Univalent cation salts dis¬ 
persed least nitrogen when used at concentrations of about 0#1N# 

For divalent cation salts, lowest dispersal of nitrogen was ob¬ 
tained when the salt concentration was about 0#02N* These wor¬ 
kers believe that the type of dispersion curves they obtained 
do not agree with the theory explaining the dispersion of pro¬ 
teins in water on the basis of the dialysable salts present in 
the meal# Nagel et al ( 72 ) suggest that the lecithin present 
in soybean meal is largely responsible for the ease and comple¬ 
teness with which soybean protein disperses in water* 

Tlie nonprotein nitrogen for soybean is given as 
of the total seed nitrogen ( 36 )® 

Aging and intensive grinding reduced the amount of 
extractable nitrogen (82)* Jones and Gersdorff (£ 6 ) found that 
storage of soybean meal decreased the solubility of the protein in 
10 %" sodium chloride and suggest this indicates partial denaturation

of the proteins. Nagel et al (71) investigated the effects of 
water-to-meal ratio, temperature, time of extraction, and size 
of meal particles on the extraction of nitrogen from soybean 
meal. As might be expected, they found the nitrogen in the 
hulls did not disperse easily in water. 

Electrophoretic patterns are reported by Briggs and 
Mann (11) for water extracts of soybean meal representing 95$ 
of the total meal nitrogen. The globulin "glycinin 11 was a 
mixture of components but they were able to prepare an electro- 
phoretically homogeneous globulin representing 60 $ of the total 
globulin. This electrophoretically homogeneous protein was not 
homogeneous on the basis of results from solubility experiments* 

Mann and Briggs ( 67 ) showed that alcohol treatment mainly 
reduced globulin solubility in water or salt solutions, whereas 
heating primarily reduced the solubility of protein fractions 
other than the globulins. 


Peanuts 


Much of the work on the extraction of peanut proteins 
has been done with meal after oil removal by the hydraulic press 
method (33# 15 )* instead of with solvent-extracted meal.

Fontaine and Burnett (30) report more than 80$ of the nitrogen 
of solvent-extracted meal is peptized by water (pH 6*6), but 
more than 90$ is dispersed at a pH of 7*2 or over* Of twenty 
seven salts investigated, no better extraction was obtained* 

Fontaine, Irving and Markley (31) report hydrochloric 
acid - sodium hydroxide pH - peptization curves showing the 
percentage of total peanut meal nitrogen peptized* A minimum 
peptization zone occurred at about pH 4*5 « When the meal had 
been previously dialysed against water, the subsequent dispersion 
of nitrogen was greatly increased from pH 0*9 to 4®5<» Previous 
dialysis of the meal against water had no effect on the amount 
of nitrogen extracted at pH values above the minimum peptization 
zone 0 The authors believe that such results indicate that salts 
and other dialysable constituents of the meal are not responsible 
for the high peptization of peanut protein in water* Ihese re¬ 
sults do not eliminate the possible role of lecithin or other 
nonprotein substances not removed by dialysis* Fontaine, Pons 
and Irving (32) later published some interesting results which 
help to explain this effect of dialysis* Below the protein iso¬ 
electric point a protein-phytic acid complex seems to exist vhich 
reduces the solubility of the meal proteins* Above the iso¬ 
electric range the complex dissociates and has no influence on 
the amounts of protein dispersed* Dialysis removed 91$ of the 
phytic acid from peanut meal.

Johns and Jones (I|_7) found the total protein of the 
peanut to consist of a little heat coagulable albumin, but 
mainly of the globulins named arachin and conarachin* 

Karon, Adams and Altschul ($9) showed extracts of pea¬ 
nuts to have the same electrophoretic composition in glycine 
buffer irrespective of the solvent used to extract the protein* 

The patterns consist of two major and several minor components* 

The major components appear as a single peak for salt or alkali 
extracted meal, but if the protein was from meal which had been 
washed with water of pH 5, to remove sugars and phytin, the major 
component appears as two almost equal fractions* The same result 
was obtained by washing protein which had been extracted and pre¬ 
cipitated by adjustment of pH to The authors suggest this 

result indicates loss of a binding agent which might be carbo¬ 
hydrate or phytin components in the meal* 

Irving, Fontaine and Warner (Iplp) found the protein ex¬ 
tracted from peanuts with an ammonia buffer to consist of two 
major components and at least two minor components* Arachin, 
as prepared by saturation with ammonium sulfate, was composed 
of the two major components of whole extract, whereas conarachin 
was composed of only one major component plus the minor components* 
These two globulins, arachin and conarachin, differ as 
to sulfur, basic nitrogen, lysine, methionine, cystine, threonine, 
tryptophane and tyrosine contents (lj.7, 4-8, 13, ll\., 57)* 






In 1930 Jones and Horn (58) reported the preparation 
of arachin by saturation with ammonium sulfate and by an¬ 
other method involving dilution and acidification to pH 5* Dean 
( 25 ) found both methods produce globulins which are identical 
as to the manner in which they absorb ultraviolet light as would 
be expected if their amino acid compositions were similar. 

Johnson ( 49 ) used the ultracentrifuge to determine the 
homogeneity of arachin prepared by the two methods of Jones and 
Horn. The dilution and acidification method produced two 
sedimenting species instead of just one* Further work by Johnson 
( 50 ) has indicated the two species result from a reversible type 
of dissociation of the arachin molecule into two equal sub-units. 
From sedimentation and diffusion measurements, Johnson and Shooter 
( 53 ) indicate the dissociation product (molecular weight 180 , 000 ) 
is of greater molecular asymmetry than the parent molecule (mo¬ 
lecular weight 330 , 000 ). Johnson ( 5 l) believes the arachin occurs 
in the peanut as the associated molecule. 

Association in ammonium sulfate even at 15$ saturation 
( 0 . 88 m) appears to be due to the sulfate ion since ammonium chlo¬ 
ride has little effect at similar ionic strengths. When sodium 
salts of long chain paraffin sulfates are used, association is 
complete at much lower salt concentrations: C 3 - 0 . 01 | 6 m; 

c io - 0 , 012 m; c 12 - 0 . 0018 m.

By electrophoresis, Johnson, Shooter and Hideal 
have shown that the dissociation product predominates at high 
pH values but at pH values lower than neutrality there is a 
marked increase in the associated molecules* These results 
compare with ultracentrifugal results# Where sulfate ion was 
used to prepare the arachin there was an increase in the nega¬ 
tive mobilities of the two components in phosphate buffer due to 
adsorption of sulfate ions on the protein* Prolonged dialysis 
of the arachin against phosphate buffer did not remove the sul¬ 
fate ions, but they are replaced by barbiturate ions upon dia¬ 
lysis of the arachin against barbiturate buffer# 

Johnson et al ( 54 -) also largely confirmed the results 
of Fontaine et al ( 44 )• 


Peas 


Evans, Henry, and St* John ( 27 ) indicate the influence 
of dispersing agent (kind, concentration and pH) on the extract¬ 
ion of pea seed nitrogen* For salts, the percentage nitrogen 
peptized was never over 80 ^* About 18 $ of the nitrogen of 
dry peas was not precipitable by 2*0 - 0.1N trichloroacetic acid* 
Brown ( 12 ) found that salt solutions of about 1 % concentration

dispersed less pea protein than did more concentrated salt sol¬ 
utions or water. He extracted the total pea seed protein 

with water by subjecting the meal to three successive lots of 
water. By the same procedure, salts of 2% concentration or more 
dispersed more than 90 % of the protein* Wetter (9$) has reported 
on a number of organic and inorganic salt solutions vhich extract 
from to of the pea nitrogen, and which are also suitable 
for use in the electrophoretic analysis of protein extracts. 

Evans and St. John (28) report that autoclaving of dry 
o 

peas at 110 C. reduced the amount of protein soluble in water and 
various salt solutions. The greatest amount of protein dispersed 
by water was f>9$ which was lower than for most salts. 

Very few investigations have been concerned with the 
nature of extracted pea protein. 

Wetter and McCalla ( 99 ) concluded that pea seed proteins 
were much more heterogeneous than thought earlier. 

Danielsson ( 23 ) developed a method whereby the pea glo¬ 
bulins vicilin and legumin could be prepared pure enough to pro¬ 
duce single sedimentation boundaries in the ultracentrifuge* 
Molecular weights were determined for both globulins* In all, 
the globulins of 3Ip different species of the Leguminosae family 
were analysed in the ultracentrifuge. Later, the same author found 
the vicilin of pea seeds to be electrophoretically homogeneous in 
the pH range 3o7 to 9*3 and the legumin was homogeneous in the 
range 6.3 to 9.3 (2lp).

MATERIAL AND METHODS 


Pea seeds ( Pisum sativum ) were coarsely ground in a 
Wiley mill and then extracted forty-eight hours with ether using 
a Soxhlet apparatus* Following this extraction the pea meal 
was ground in a ball mill until fine enough to pass through a 
72 mesh sieve* Metal containers were used for storing the 
pea flour at room temperature* 

For preliminary extractions, peas of the Alaska 
variety grown at Edmonton in 191-1-8 were used, but Idabelle peas 
grown under the same conditions were used for the diffusion and 
electrophoretic results reported* 

Y/orkers have reported on the protein extracting ab¬ 
ility of many salts when used on peas* Unfortunately, many of 
the dispersing agents which extracted high percentages of ni¬ 
trogen are not suitable for use in electrophoretic analysis be¬ 
cause the salt concentration is too high. Wetter ( 98 ) investi¬ 
gated a number of solvents which might be suitable as extracting 
agents as well as for electrophoresis* Some attempt has been 
made here to add to his list*

Evans and St, John (28) have reported curves shov/ing 
the affect of pH on pea protein dispersion for water and sodium 
chloride* The same type of study is reported here for sodium 
benzoate and sodium salicylate* 

The extraction procedure employed was simply to mix 
known amounts of meal and dispersing agent in a suitable con¬ 
tainer* The resulting slurry was left in the refrigerator over¬ 
night and next morning it was subjected to centrifugation in 
an angle centrifuge (4.000 r*p*m*) placed in the refrigerator* 

The clear supernatant liquid was poured off and used for analysis* 
Calculations for the amount of nitrogen extracted are 
on the basis of the total volume of dispersing agent added* 
Nitrogen determinations on extracts were either with a macro 
Kjeldahl apparatus or by a micro Kjeldahl method* The conver¬ 
sion factor 6*25 served to convert nitrogen content to protein 
content. 

To check both electrophoretic equipment and technique 
mobility determinations were made using crystallized egg albumin 
prepared by the method of Kekwick and Oannan (37) and the results 
compared with those of Tiselius, and Colvin and McCalla (21) 
obtained under similar conditions* 

All electrophoretic patterns were obtained with the 
same Tiselius apparatus as employed by Colvin and McCalla (21)

except that their cell which required rubber sleeves was re¬ 
placed by a cell with ball joint connections* The determination 
of mobilities was as outlined by these authors using the 

formula A, = .JGL. « 
it 

where^ = mobility, 

V = volume swept through, 

K = specific conductance, 
i = current, 
t = time. 

Conductivities and hydrogen ion concentrations were 
determined with the same instruments used by Colvin and McCalla* 
The Beckman pH meter was always standardized with a phosphate 
buffer prepared according to Clark (19)* 

The main electrophoretic work reported involves an 
attempt to fractionate the water-soluble proteins of the pea 
seed# As already mentioned, Danielsson (23, 2lj.) has carried out 
an electrophoretic and ultracentrifugal characterization of the 
pea seed globulins, vicilin and legumin, therefore the proposed 
study would help to present a more complete picture of the pea 
proteinso The attempted fractionation involved the use of ammo¬ 
nium sulfate and can be best explained by the scheme on the 
following page* 

Electrophoresis was done on each fraction after it had 
been dialysed against three 1$00 ml# lots of the 0#2N sodium phos¬ 
phate buffer#

Check and preliminary diffusion determinations were made 
with the Neurath cell used by Colvin and McCalla (21) 0 The pro¬ 
cedure for determination of diffusion constants was the same as 

2 

reported by these authors using the formula D = A 

where D = diffusion constant, 

A = area under the curve, 
t = time of diffusion, 

H m = maximum ordinate. 

After the preliminary runs the Neurath cell was discarded in 
favor of the Tiselius cell because of leakage in the Neurath cell 
which was apparently caused by the steel surfaces being out of 
alignment® Efforts to correct this fault were unsuccessful® 

Viscosities were determined with an Ostwald viscosimeter 
and densities of solutions were found by the pycnometer method. 

The main diffusion determinations represent a determin¬ 
ation of the effect of temperature on the molecular state of dis¬ 
persed pea protein. The protein was dispersed in a buffer (con¬ 
sisting of 0.2M-NaClj 0.03M-Na*HP0 ; 0.02M-NaH (i P0 ) by the ex¬ 

traction procedure already given® Following centrifugation* the 
extract was dialysed against three lots of the buffer and then 
diluted to 0.70$ protein concentration. This material was divided 
into aliquots suitable for diffusion determinations® 

Since the aliquots in some cases had to be kept over a 


period of many weeks, some method was required for preserving them 
Toluene has been used for keeping protein solutions* By this

method, Vickery et al (93) kept suspensions of cucurbit seed 
globulins for some time at refrigerator temperatures# Perri and 
Hazel (77) used toluene as a preservative for soybean protein 
preparations as did Briggs and Mann (11)* 

Freezing was thought to be a more efficient method for 
keeping protein solutions over a long period of time* Unfor¬ 
tunately, there is no clear-cut evidence of the effects freezing 
has on proteins* Tiselius'. ( 91 ) reported that freezing of horse 
sera did not change the properties of the solutions. Toluene, 
however, caused precipitation. Moore et al ( 69 ), using electro¬ 
phoretic patterns of human blood serum showed that measurable 
changes occurred on freezing the serum in a dry ice-alcohol bath 
followed by thawing in an ice box. Denaturation of myosin by freez¬ 
ing has been reported by Dyer, French and Snow (26)* its for plant 
proteins. Woods and DuBuy (103) found that freezing caused irrever¬ 
sible coagulation of potato chromoprotein (chlorophyll-protein). 

Price (79) reports southern bean mosaic virus held at «10°C. lost 
about 95 $ of its activity in six days and was apparently completely 
inactive after three months* Wildman, Cheo and Bonner (102) stored 
cytoplasmic protein preparations of green leaves at -l 6 °C. until 
electrophoretic analysis with no apparent deleterious effect on 
the proteins. This conclusion was based on the fact that the 
thawed protein solutions remained perfectly clear* The report of 
Fontaine et al (31) on peanut protein states that unpublished results

of Irving, Fontaine and Warner showed the mobolities of the com¬ 
ponents of whole protein were significantly changed by lyophili- 
zation, but Johnson and Shooter (53) found freeze-dried preparations 
of arachin possessed the same electrophoretic mobilities as samples 
stored under the mother liquor at 0° - 5°Co 

Before diffusion constants were determined on the frozen 
pea protein aliquots, some electrophoretic determinations were 
made on frozen and unfrozen aliquots to give an indication of 
possible changes in the protein as a result of freezing* 

The diffusion time for all diffusion constant determin¬ 
ations was 1|.8 hours* 

Viscosities on both the buffer and protein solutions 
were obtained at each temperature at which diffusion constants 
were determined* The viscosity values of the buffer were required 
in the conversion of diffusion constants to a reference temperature 
by the formula D 293 t 

273 + t 

where D 20 = diffusion constant at 20°C*, 

Dt = diffusion constant at experimental temperature, 

t = experimental temperature,°C., 
y l t = viscosity of solvent at experimental temperature , 

■^20 = viscosity of solvent at 20 °C» 

This formula was used by Svedberg and Pedersen ( 90 ) Tor mono- and 

paucidisperse systems*

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 


pH-mobility Relationship of Crystalline Egg Albumin 


The results of the electrophoretic mobility determin¬ 
ations on crystalline egg albumin are shown in Figure 1„ The 
observed values have been calculated from the descending boundary 
(66). The two observed values at 20°C. agree very well with those 

of Tiselius (21), but most of the observed results were obtained 
o 

at 2 C. and for these a regression line could be plotted* This 

line indicates an isoelectric point in excellent agreement with 

the value reported by Tiselius 0 At the same pH the mobilities 
o o 

at 2 Co are less than those at 20 Co as would be expected on the 
basis of viscosity differences at the two temperatures. 


Extraction of Pea Protein 


Of a number of dispersing agents tried only one gave a high 
extraction value. This was a buffer made up of 0.2M-NaCl; 0.03M- 
Ife^EPO]^; 0.02M-NaH2P0[j_ (pH 6.8) which extracted 86 - 88$ of the

nitrogen in the meal* Unfortunately, the concentration of this 
buffer makes it necessary to apply a comparatively high current during 
electrophoresis to obtain suitable field strengths* 

Figure 2 illustrates the effect of pH on nitrogen ex¬ 
traction* The curves shown for water and sodium chloride have 
been taken from Evans and St* John (28), whereas the curves for 
sodium salicylate and sodium benzoate represent observed values. 

The absolute values for the observed results should not be com¬ 
pared to those obtained by Evans and St* John because of differ¬ 
ences in the extraction conditions* Besides, the pH values given 
by these authors are those of the extracts while the pH values 
for the benzoate and salicylate curves are for the solutions used 
for the extractions* The pH range investigated does not include 
the extreme pH values but only those values at which electro¬ 
phoretic analysis is usually made* Both of these organic salts 
extract more nitrogen at the higher pH values with a marked drop 
below pH 6 * Such results were expected since they agree with the 
type of curves obtained with numerous dispersing agents used on 
other legume seeds* 

Since Figure 2 indicates that sodium salicylate disperses 
a high percentage of pea protein it should be a suitable disper¬ 
sing agent* Recently Jirgensons (l±$, I 4 . 6 ) has reported, however, 
that sodium salicylate has a denaturing action on pea legumin* 

He based his conclusions on the fact that viscosity and reducing

for protein dispersed in some common salts® On the basis of these 
results, sodium salicylate should not be used as a dispersing 
agent for pea protein 0 


Ammonium Sulfate Fractionation of Water-soluble 


Pea Protein 


A 100-gmo sample of pea meal was extracted wl th one 
liter of water overnight at refrigerator temperatures® The re¬ 
sulting slurry was centrifuged in the refrigerator and the su¬ 
pernatant saved® On the basis of duplicate extractions, l±0% of 
the nitrogen in the meal was dispersed by the water* Following 
dialysis against water, the extract was centrifuged to remove the 
small amount of precipitate which had formed® After these treat¬ 
ments, 60 - of the originally dispersed nitrogen had not 

precipitated or been removed by diffusion through the cellophane 
bag during dialysis®

Figures 3, If, 5$ 6, 7 and 8, represent the patterns 
obtained for the various fractions obtained according to the 
outline on page 13# The degree of resolution of the various 
components has been poor* Because of this poor separation, no 
calculations of the amounts of each component present were made 
from the patterns* In no case was a single component isolated 
by the ammonium sulfate treatments although there is a marked 
variation in the concentrations of the various components in the 
different fractions* For example, fraction If shows a predom¬ 
inance of faster moving components, whereas its supernatant is 
mostly composed of the slower components* Fraction 3 compares 
favorably to fraction 2 as would be expected since the former 
represents the precipitate produced by ammonium sulfate sat¬ 
uration of the protein solution shown by Figure If*

Continual inconvenience and error in many determinations 
due to leakage forced the change from the Neurath cell to the 
Tiselius cell* Test runs with 0*1M sucrose gave an average dif- 

-7 2 

fusion constant of (23*8 i 1*2) x 10 moles/cm* /sec 0 for two 

o 

determinations at 2*0 C* This value compares favorably with 
values given in International Critical Tables* Since the scan¬ 
ning patterns were normal curves, use of this cell was considered 
satisfactory for further determinations* 

In preliminary pea protein diffusion runs at 20°C* 
with the Neurath cell, cloudiness occurred in the cell during the 
determinations* The cloudiness became so intense that the diffusion 
boundary could not be photographed after a period of about 700 
minutes diffusion time* At first, it was thought that the tem¬ 
perature might be causing the cloudiness and this was the origi¬ 
nal reason for determining theeffects of temperature on diffusion 
of pea protein solutions* Later diffusion determinations with the 
Tiselius cell, however, showed that the cloudiness could be eli¬ 
minated simply by dialysing the protein extract against three 
lots of buffer* The cloudiness was, therefore, apparently caused 
by some dialysable constituent in the pea meal* Such a consti¬ 
tuent might be phytin since Fontaine et al (32) have suggested 
the possibility of the phytate ion being responsible for cloudi¬ 
ness of soybean extracts.

Figure 9 (b and c) illustrates the heterogeneous 
nature of the protein since the observed scanning patterns 
deviate considerably from the normal curves (90). The 
experimental curve at 21#5>°C. is more diffuse than the one at 1°C 
because diffusion rate is higher at the higher temperatureo 
Figure 10 shows the results of diffusion determin¬ 
ations which were carried out to determine the effect of temper¬ 
ature on the diffusion constants of whole pea protein extracts® 

The time of diffusion was 48 hours in all cases# The regression 
Une plotted from the observed results shows a decrease in dif¬ 
fusion constants with a decrease in temperature® When these 

o 

values are converted to the reference temperature of 20 C® by 
the formula given by Svedberg and Pedersen (90), the resulting 
regression line is not horizontal as it should be if the temper¬ 
ature has no effect on the molecular state of the protein# The 
negative slope of the regression line for the converted constants 
is, however, small® Since the method for determination of 
diffusion constants is subject to considerable error the small 
negative slope may not be significant® 

Such a viewpoint is supported by the viscosity re¬ 
sults given in Figure 11® The curve obtained by plotting pro¬ 
tein viscosity against temperature is very similar in shape to 


that for the buffer used in the Tiselius cello

On the basis of the diffusion and viscosity results 
there does not appear to be a significant change in the mo¬ 
lecular state of the protein with temperature, or if there is 
the methods used did not detect the change* 

By averaging the eleven diffusion constants con- 

o ~7 2 

verted to 20 CL, a value of 3#9° x 10~ moles/cm* /sec* is ob¬ 
tained for the whole protein extract, Danielsson (23) has re- 

7 P 

ported an average diffusion constant of 4*26 x 10 ~ 1 moles/cm. 

per sec. at 20°C* for vicilin, and a value of 3♦4-9 x moles 

2 , 0 

per cm* /sec* at 20 C. for legumin. Using these diffusion values, 
Danielsson has found the molecular weight of vicilin to be 186,000 
and that of legumin to be 331*000. These globulins are probably 

present in the whole protein extract because they are soluble in 

-7 

the dispersing agent used, and because the value of 3*90 x 10 

p 

moles/cm. /sec. falls between the diffusion constants for vicilin 
and legumin. Since the diffusion constant for the whole protein 
extract definitely represents the average of the diffusion con¬ 
stants of a number of protein components, a prediction of the 
molecular weight order of the components is impossible*

DISCUSSION 


A plot of the pH-mobility relationship for egg albumin 

at 20°C. produces, as indicated in Figure 1, a different regre- 

o 

ssion line than that obtained from mobilities observed at 2 G. 
Apparently such a result cannot be explained on the basis of 
solvent viscosity changes alone* In this regard, Watanabe, Ui 
and Nakamura (97) report that conversion of mobilities from 
one temperature to another on the basis of a correction for sol¬ 
vent viscosity alone was not sufficient for satisfactory results 
using crystalline horse serum albumin* Earlier, Tiselius (91) 

showed the ratio of mobilities of horse serum globulin at 0°C. 
o 

and 20 C. to be approximately inversely proportional to the visco¬ 
sities of the solvent at the Respective temperatures* Now, 
Watanabe _et al indicate, on the basis of electrophoretic and 
titration determinations, that an additional correction is 
necessary because of protein ion valency variation with temper¬ 
ature* 

The results of Jirgensons (45* l\h) on the denaturation 
of pea legumin are interesting from an electrophoretic point of 
view* Wetter ( 98 ) reports an electrophoretic scanning diagram 
for pea protein extracted with sodium salicylate* Although 









Ij 


.d

sodium salicylate extracts over 30% of the pea protein (Figure 2), 
the pattern he obtained is composed almost exclusively of one peak# 
Electrophoretic patterns of pea extracts in sodium phosphate 
and sodium chloride-sodium phosphate buffers (Figures 3 and 9 a ) 
indicate that pea protein extracts are made up of a number of 
components# The explanation for this discrepancy could be that 
the denaturing action of the salicylate has completely altered 
the electrophoretic properties of the protein 0 There is also 
the possibility, of course, that the salicylate is so strongly 
bound to the protein that the true electrostatic nature of the 
protein has been extensively masked# Klotz (6l) has shown there 
is a marked difference in the ability of various ions to form ion- 
protein complexes# 

In regard to the pea protein fractionation, the electro¬ 
phoretic patterns indicate the water-soluble protein is much more 
heterogeneous than the globulins since Danielsson found only two 
components that were water insoluble# Thus fractionation of the 
water-soluble components mil be more complicated# The results

methods produced distinct proteins from the pea, but on electro¬ 
phoretic examination of these fractions Wetter and McCalla (99)

with the proportions of each component varying in the dif¬ 
ferent fractions# Their results on the fractions used also 
indicate that even salt precipitation combined with pH variation 
may not satisfactorily isolate electrophoretic components in 
pure form# Because the components are poorly resolved by 
electrophoresis, separation with sliding-flange cells does not 
appear very promising either, although some buffers other than 
the phosphate type may afford better resolution of the protein 
components*

PART II 

SQUASH SEED PROTEINS 


LITERATURE REVIEW 


For many years edestin, the globulin of hemp-seed, 
was used extensively as a protein source in experimental animal 
diets, and its composition was thoroughly investigated* When 
the Marihuana Law of 1937 was passed in the United States, the 
restrictions made the purchase of hemp-seed in that country an 
involved transaction even for experimental laboratories* A sub¬ 
stitute had to be found and this led to the investigation of glo¬ 
bulin of pumpkin seed ( Cucurbita pepo ) which Vickery and co-workers 
prepared in a crystalline form (9 k-) * They reported their method 
in 19^0 and it was satisfactory for preparing globulins from a 
number of the common cucurbit species* In the same year Wang 
( 96 ) published a procedure quite similar to that of Vickery* The 

following year, Vickery’s method was modified by including a heat 
o 

treatment of 7b C. to coagulate small quantities of proteins pre¬ 
sumed to be of the albumin type (93)* ^he same paper reports the 
yields of globulins from six species varied from 15 * 4 $ down to 













- 35 - 


6 0 2$ of the air-dry weight of the whole seeds. Castaneda- 
Agullo and Salazar P (17) also report the yields of globulins 
from various cucurbit species# 

Since 19 ^ 4-0 the chemical composition of the cucurbit glo¬ 
bulins has been extensively investigated# Nitrogen, sulfur and 
ash contents of globulins from six species of cucurbits have been 
tabulated (93* 55)* Hirohata (Ip.) studied 38 varieties in eight 
genera of the family Cucurbitaceae and in only one case was he 
able to show chemical differences, however precipitin reactions 
showed immunological differences in many cases# 

Amino acid determinations on the globulins of various 
species have been numerous and present a fairly complete picture 
from this point of view (39* 62 , 8!p, 85 , 66, 89 , 93 , 95)* 

The arginine, tyrosine, and tryptophane contents are similar for 
the globulins of squashes and pumpkins #iich differ from those 
of watermelon, cantaloupe, and cucumber# 

A knowledge of amino acid composition or, even more spe¬ 
cifically, of the number of free groups in the protein molecule 
is fundamental knowledge required for an understanding of the 
ion-protein complex formation known to occur when proteins are 
brought into solution# Such knowledge appears to be conspic¬ 
uously lacking for plant proteins as compared with proteins found 
in the animal kingdom ( 6 l)# Perlmann ( 76 ), however, presents 
data for the acid-combining capacity of edestin and watermelon

seed globulin as determined from the sum of the basic amino 
acids and of the free <X -amino groups# Perlmann reports the 
acid-combining capacity of edestin to be 138 x 10 mole per gm# 
of protein by measurement of bound metaphosphoric acid# Cohn (20) 
found 12? and Hitchcock 134. x mole per gm# of protein by 

direct titration, using E#M#F# measurements# Two of these values 
are higher than the value of 130 arrived at from the content of 
the basic amino acids of edestin# This value, of course, would 
not include the free ol- amino groups# For watermelon seed glo¬ 
bulin Perlmann reports the acid-binding capacity to be llj.6 x 10 ^ 
mole per gm# of protein by the metaphosphoric acid method# This 
value compared with 137 on the basis of amino acid content# The 
total basic amino acids per gm# of protein as listed by Smith and 
Greene (8If) for various cucurbits are; 126 for pumpkin, 128 for 
squash, and 126 for cucumber. The high value for watermelon seed 
globulin is probably a result of its higher arginine content 
(17#9 % compared with l6#2$ for squash, l£#8$ for cucumber, and 
16 * 2 $ for pumpkin)• 

Apparently very little has been done in applying physical 
methods to the study of cucurbit proteins# Leoiit*ev (6if), using 
Citrillus vulgaris , Cucumis rnelo , and Cucurbita maxima , found the 
seed globulins of these species to be similar in a number of 
physical properties# Only one report of electrophoretic analysis 


has been found in the literature and this analysis was incidental

to the main investigation citedo Vennesland and Felsher (92) 
showed the globulin of Cucurbita pepo * prepared by Vickery’s 
method (93)> had oxalacetic decarboxylase activity* Byerrum, 
Brown, and Ball (l 6 ), investigated this enzyme activity more 
fully* On the basis of electrophoretic results, they describe 
the globulin as essentially homogeneous at ionic strength 0.08 
and pH Ij. in acetate buffer* The globulin was in suspension in 
buffer more alkaline than pH I 4 -. 5 , and in solution at more acid 
pH levelso The recrystallized preparation contained manganese 
and iron besides traces of zinc, cobalt, and nickel* This 
analysis prompted these workers to suggest that the oxalacetic 
decarboxylase may be a metal-protein. 

This review of literature indicates that the cucurbit 
proteins represent a class of plant proteins about which next 
to nothing is kno¥/n concerning their electrophoretic properties 
and physical properties in general. 


MATERIAL AND METHODS 


The squash seeds used were obtained from a commercial 
seed house. They were of the Golden Hubbard variety which belongs 
to the species Cucurbita maxima . The whole seeds were coarsely

ground in a hand mill, but before further grinding was possible 
they had to be ether extracted because of their high oil con¬ 
tent. Following ether extraction the coarsely ground seeds were 
ball-milled to pass through a 72 mesh sieve* The flour thus 
produced was stored in stoppered bottles until used* 

The procedure used for extraction of squash protein 
was similar to that used for extraction of pea protein whereby 
the buffer and squash flour were mixed in centrifuge tubes, 
left overnight, and the slurry then centrifuged* Extractions 
of squash protein were made at both refrigerator and room tem¬ 
peratures* The extracts obtained at refrigerator temperatures 
were dialysed by static dialysis for at least three days 0 The 
extracts obtained at room temperature were preserved with toluene 
and dialysed at the same temperature using a mechanical dialyser 
(80) to hasten the process* In either case one change of buffer 
was made during each dialysis, the volume of buffer used being 
1500 ml. for each change* 

Those extracts kept in the refrigerator were analysed 
electrophoretically at 2°C., whereas electrophoresis of the ex¬ 
tracts made at room temperature was carried out at 20°C* Very 
little recent electrophoretic work has been done at 20°G. as the 
temperature range 0-i^°C. has been used because higher field 
strengths can be used without heating effects* With proteins of 
low solubility at low temperatures, analysis at higher temperatures

is to be preferred even though lower field strengths must 
be used and diffusion is greater. Johnson and Shooter (£2) 

i 0 

found electrophoretic analysis of known protein mixtures at 4 C. 
o 

and 20 C. gave identical results. 

Following preliminary extractions and electrophoretic 

analysis of whole squash seed extracts, squash globulin was 

prepared by a method based on that used by Vickery (94-) • A 30- 

gm. sample of squash seed meal was suspended in 300 ml. of 10 $ 

sodium chloride. This suspension was placed on a water bath 
. o 

at about 4 O C. for three hours* The slurry was centrifuged for 
20 minutes in an angle centrifuge at I 4 O 00 r.p.m. and the result¬ 
ing supernatant liquid again centrifuged for 20 minutes. The 
dispersion was then filtered to remove some light flaky particles 

of the meal which were not removed by centrifugation. The clear 

o 

filtrate was heated on a water bath to 50 C. and then made 2$ 
with respect to sodium chloride by adding distilled water 
60°C. Protein crystals formed upon leaving the resulting sol¬ 
ution in the refrigerator overnight* For recrystallization the 
entire protein suspension was centrifuged 10 minutes in the re¬ 
frigerator and the resulting precipitate redispersed in 10$ 
sodium chlorideo Any material which did not redisperse was cen¬ 
trifuged down at room temperature. Recrystallization was done 
from the clear supernatant* The protein was recrystallized three 
times before being used and was stored under the mother liquor 
in the refrigerator.

These results show very poor dispersion of squash seed 
nitrogen, and therefore, of protein (N x 6.25>) for all of the 
solvents except sodium salicylate. The salicylate extract re¬ 
mained very murky even after centrifugation. Since this dis¬ 
persing agent has been reported to have a protein denaturing 
action (6, 8l, 45* 4&) and - inactivate a virus (10), its use 
here is open to question. 

The nitrogen extracted by trichloroacetic acid is 
probably of a nonprotein form (9)o 

The low dispersion of nitrogen by most of the foregoing 
dispersing agents does not seem to be very dependent upon the 
pH of the solvent as was indicated from results using 0.1M 
sodium phosphate of pH values ranging from 4*5 to 9*1* At pH 
4*5 only 22$ of the nitrogen was extracted which was the lowest 
value for the series. Phosphate of pH 9*1 extracted 38$ of the 
total nitrogen which represents a comparatively small increase 
considering the type of results obtained with some plant pro¬ 
teins. 

In view of the low dispersability of squash nitrogen, 
as indicated in Table 1, the possible effect of temperature on 
protein peptization was investigated. Extractions were made at 
refrigerator and room temperatures using the same meal-solvent 
ratio, and the same solvents as given in Table 1. The extracts

Table 2 indicates that in all cases there is a 
greater amount of nitrogen dispersed at the higher temperature* 
Sodium benzoate showed an increase representing approximately 
5Q°/o of the total squash seed nitrogen# The sodium salicylate 
extract again remained very murky after centrifugation# 


Electrophoresis of Squash Seed Protein 


Electrophoretic patterns for extracts of squash seed 
in various buffers are given in Figures 12, 13, llf., and Ip# 

These extracts were obtained at refrigerator temperatures with 
the meal-solvent ratio reduced to 1:6# Although the dispersions 
were still too dilute for the best resolution of protein compo¬ 
nents, the patterns indicate the low dispersion of squash protein 

■s 

at low temperatures is not confined to a single component# 

On the other hand, good electrophoretic patterns were 
obtained for sodium benzoate extracts made at room temperature 
(Figure l6)# Although Figures l6 and 1? represent similar ex¬ 
tracts, these two figures appear quite different because Figure 
17 shows thermal effects due to the relatively high field strength 
used. The convection effects show up as very sharp, small subsid¬ 
iary peaks* Figure l6 indicates the presence of at least one 
major component and two minor components*

Electrophoresis of Crystallized Squash Globulin 


When examined microscopically (Figure 1 8 ), the crys¬ 
talline globulin was entirely free of amorphous materialo The 
crystals appear to conform to the octahedral shape described for 
cucurbit globulin crystals (9^4-) • 

The globulin was highly insoluble in a number of the 
solvents listed in Table 1 although dispersion was good in the 
0 .2N sodium benzoate and 0.2N sodium salicylate* 

From Figures 19 and 20, the crystallized globulin appears 
to be essentially electrophoretically homogeneous in sodium ben¬ 
zoate and sodium formate at the pH values indicated* 

A comparison of the mobility of the crystallized glo¬ 
bulin in sodium benzoate with the mobilities of the components 
of whole extract in Figure l6 indicates that the fastest moving 
component in the whole extract is the globulin* The mobility 
of this peak (-0.6lpx 10“^' cm.^/volt/sec* for the descending 

boundary at pH 6.8), is very similar to that of the crystallized 

j 2 

globulin (- 0.61 x 10" cm* /volt/sec. for the descending boundary 
at pH 6*9). 

In sodium acetate at pH Ip*7 the protein appeared t o be 
in suspension, but it was in solution at pH lj.*3 and in more acidic 
acetate solutions* This behavior is very similar to that reported

for crystallized globulin of Cucurbita pepo which was in sus¬ 
pension in acetate buffer more alkaline than pH lj.#5 (l6)© 

When dissolved in sodium acetate at pH 3*9 the crys¬ 
tallized globulin (Figure 21) is characterized by the same 
electrophoretic homogeneity as indicated in Figures 19 and 20 o 
Byerrum et al (l6) found the globulin from Cucurbita pepo to be 
essentially homogeneous at pH lj_#0# In contrast to these re¬ 
sults, Figure 22 shows that at pH I|.#7 two components are present* 
The appearance of two components at this pH was very unexpected, 
but these results were duplicated with a second preparation of 
the globulin 0 

One very marked characteristic of the patterns for 
globulin in sodium acetate shown in Figure 21, is the lack of 
symmetry between ascending boundary and descending boundary pat¬ 
terns© The patterns in sodium formate also show this lack of 
agreement between the two boundaries© The patterns shown in 
both Figures 20 and 21 were produced at pH values below the 
isoelectric pH of the protein since migration was toward the 
cathode# In contrast, the scanning diagrams shown in Figure 
19 show good symmetry. In this case the electrophoretic analysis 
in sodium benzoate, was done at a pH value above the isoelectric 
pH of the protein#

The foregoing comparison is not meant to intimate that 
the isoelectric point of the globulin dispersion is the same 
regardless of the dispersing agent used* The isoelectric point 
of the globulin dispersed in sodium benzoate may be quite dif¬ 
ferent from the isoelectric point observed when the globulin is 
dispersed in sodium acetate* Variation in the degree of ion-protein 
complex formation in the different dispersing agents will cause 
such a discrepancy. For any given protein dispersion the ob¬ 
served isoelectric point is, therefore, a characteristic of the 
ion-protein complex rather than of the protein itself* 

Longsworth (65) states that in buffers of the uncharged 
acid type, patterns obtained above the isoelectric pH tend to be 
more nearly mirror images of each other than at values below 
this pH* Above the isoelectric pH the effects of pH changes and 
conductivity changes at the boundary tending to decrease the 
symmetry between the patterns, tend to cancel each other* For pH 
values below the isoelectric pH, the pH changes at the boundary can 
combine wlth the conductivity changes to increase the tendency for 
the ascending boundary to sharpen and the descending boundary to 


become more diffuse

DISCUSSION 


Of the results obtained Qn squash proteins, those from 
the crystallized globulin are most interesting* 

The low dispersal of squash seed proteins by some 
simple salts near neutrality probably is due to the low solu¬ 
bility of the globulin under these conditions. On the other 
hand, the relatively high extraction by sodium benzoate and 
sodium salicylate is due, at least in part, to the increased 
solubility of the globulin in these solvents* This view is 
substantiated by Figure l6 vh ich shows a high concentration of 
the fast component* As indicated earlier, this peak corresponds 
to the crystallized globulin on the basis of electrophoretic 
mobilities, 

The patterns for the globulin in sodium formate and 
sodium benzoate showing only one peak are of the type one probably 
would expect for a crystallized material* Simply because a 
protein has been crystallized, however, does not always indicate 
electrophoretic homogeneity* Anderson and Alberty (5>) found 
that both crystalline pepsin and trypsin split into a major and 
minor component during electrophoresis. Hoch (l\3) also reported 
the electrophoretic heterogeneity of crystallized pepsin*

The interesting fact about squash globulin is that it 
appears as an essentially homogeneous protein or as two distinct 
components depending upon the pH of the acetate medium# The 
literature reports some other proteins which have been found to 
act similarly upon changes in hydrogen ion concentration# Ander¬ 
son and Alberty (5) report conalbumin of hen»s egg to appear 
homogeneous in diethylbarbiturate buffer of pH 6#8 and 0*10 
ionic strength# In contrast, at pH 6*3 and 0#01 ionic strength, 
this protein resolved into two or three components# Bain and 
Deutsch (7) found that bovine lactoglobulin and goat lactoglo- 
bulin both appeared electrophoretically homogeneous or heteroge¬ 
neous depending on the pH of the buffer. As mentioned earlier, 
Johnson and Shooter (53) have determined that arachin undergoes 
a reversible type of dissociation# Hydrogen ion concentration 
is one factor determining the state in which the arachin will 
exist in solution# 

The above findings certainly indicate that the electro¬ 
phoretic characterization of a protein must be carried out over 
a pH range before any conclusions should be made as to its 
electrophoretic purity# 

Squash globulin might well be the object of further 
investigations# A verification of some of its reported properties 
plus added information on its physical and chemical properties 
are required for an understanding of its behavior#

PART III 

LEAP ROLL VIRUS OF POTATOES 


LITERATURE REVIEW 


The term virus is applied to certain infectious par¬ 
ticles which are capable of causing disease in man, animals, 
plants, insects, and bacteria* In the past these minute 
entities have been characterized by their invisibility and 
by their ability to pass through filters capable of holding 
back all ordinary living things* Since the electron micros¬ 
cope has come into use it has been possible to view these small 
discrete particles which are either roughly spherical or rod¬ 
like in shape, and which vary in size from about 100 A (slightly 
smaller than some protein molecules) to about 3»000 A, which is 
somewhat larger than certain living organisms (the pleuro-pneu¬ 
monia organism which can be grown like ordinary bacteria on 
artificial media)* Viruses differ from bacteria, not only as 
to size, but also by their inability to duplicate themselves on

synthetic media* Most viruses are highly specific since a given 
virus will multiply only within certain kinds of living cells 0 
For example, the tobacco mosaic virus will grow only within 
the cells of certain plants, such as the tobacco or tomato 
plant* Of the plant viruses chemically analysed, all have 
proved to be simple nucleoproteins although some viruses in 
the animal world contain other constituents such as lipids, 
copper, flavin and biotin* 

Ever since the crystallization of tobacco mosaic virus 
by Stanley in 1935* viruses have been the object of more and 
more intensified study not only because of their importance as 
disease producers, but also because their true nature is still 
a point of controversy* 

The work of the past few years involving physical and 
chemical methods of analysis has brought forth much information 
about the structure of these entities which, in the words of 
Stanley (88), fill the gap between the molecules of the chemist 
and the organisms of the biologist* Those viruses which have 
been crystallized have been most intensively studied* In 1945* 
Price (78) listed tobacco mosaic, tomato bushy stunt, tobacco 
necrosis, and southern bean mosaic viruses as the only ones 
crystallized up to that time* Since then at least one more 
has been crystallized, that being turnip yellow mosaic virus 
(87)* The various strains of tobacco mosaic virus have probably

been more thoroughly investigated than any of the many other 
plant viruses mentioned in the literature* Investigations on 
such basic characteristics as size, shape and aggregation, 
amino acid content, and hydration are numerous* 

Whereas the electrophoretic technique has not been 
applied to the investigation of virus diseases in plants until 
very recently, there have been intermittent reports of electro¬ 
phoretic analysis of green plant material over the past forty 
years* In 1912, Herlitzka (36) subjected the press juice of 
leaves to electrophoresis and noticed its migration to the anode. 
Later, Bakker (8) reported that aqueous suspensions of chloro¬ 
phyll, precipitated from acetone solutions and free from protein, 
were negatively charged but became positive on exposure to 
light for several hours* Katz and W§.ssihk (60) found that 
green aqueous extracts prepared from Chlorella were negative at 
concentrations of HCI up to 0.001N, ceased movement in 0*00211 
HCI, and reversed in direction at slightly higher concentrations. 
Neish (73) found chloroplasts isolated from Trifolium to be 
isoelectric at about pH 3#7, but negative in distilled water* 
Except for these brief reports there apparently was no thorough 
investigation of the electrophoretic behavior of the chlorophyll- 
protein complex until the work of Fishman and Moyer (29), who 
used an Abramson type of microelectrophoresis cell and followed

the techniques described by Moyer (70)* Some of the general 
properties of the complex isolated from Aspidistra elatior and 
Phaseolus vulgaris were photostability, red fluorescence, sen¬ 
sitivity to protein coagulants and denaturation by drying, freez¬ 
ing, increase in temperature or treatment with weak acids* Their 
purified extracts flocculated almost instantaneously at and be¬ 
low the isoelectric point* The green microscopic particles mi¬ 
grated independently of size, shape or degree of clumping. 

Wildman and Bonner (100) report investigations concern¬ 
ing spinach leaf cytoplasmic proteins which were extracted by 

an involved procedure using blendor and colloid mill treatments 

. o 

at temperatures of O-q. C* Two components are shown by electro¬ 
phoretic patterns obtained by using infrared plates for photo¬ 
graphing the boundaries because of the color in the preparations. 
Fractionation of the cytoplasmic proteins using ammonium sulfate 
and water dialysis resulted in a fraction equivalent to 70 - 
of the total cytoplasmic protein. This fraction was electro- 
phoretically homogeneous, and showed auxin and phosphatase act¬ 
ivity 0 A second fraction was electrophoretically heterogeneous 
and had a number of enzyme activities 0 

Electrophoretic fractionation has been carried out on 
ragweed pollens but the analysis has been complicated by the pre¬ 
sence of pigments* The first experiments by Abramson et al ([{_)

were done with dialysed extracts and showed a major unpigmented 
component along with some pigmented components. Later work by 
Abramson and Moore (1), with undialysed extracts, gave better 
separation* By means of the sliding-flange plates of the 
electrophoresis cell, the pigmented fractions were separated 
from the unpigmented component, ^he electrophoretic analysis 
of timothy grass pollen (2) produced patterns similar to those 
of ragweed pollen as did pollens from Bermuda grass, June grass, 
sheep sorrel, orchard grass, birch and oak (3)» 

Very little electrophoretic work has been done with 
viruses found in plants. Some of the main reasons for this 
probably are the problems encountered in the preparation of a 
sample suitable for electrophoretic analysis. Usually there is much 
pigment in the extracts while the concentrations of the desired 
components are too low for obtaining good scanning patterns, 

Frarnpton and Takahashi (34* 35) used an extraction 
procedure involving cytolysis of harvested leaves with ether. 

The vacuolar sap was then pressed out and discarded as it 
contained very little protein, but much pigment and substrate 
for oxidizing enzymes. After several water v/ashings and pressings, 
the pressed leaf material was ground in a food chopper and ex¬ 
tracted with buffer. In some cases the Waring Blendor was used. 

To get a high enough concentration of protein in the extract 
the extracting agent was reused several times with further

concentration obtained by placing the extract in a cellophane 
tubing and hanging it before a fan* The authors do not in¬ 
dicate the amount of protein extracted by their method* 

By means of the moving boundary method of electro¬ 
phoresis, using infrared photography, Prampton and Takahashi (35), 
obtained scanning patterns for extracts from healthy tobacco 
plants, from tobacco plants infected with tobacco mosaic virus, 
with potato X and potato Y viruses. Patterns are also given for 
extracts from the healthy pea bean and pea bean with a virus 
infection* 

Wildman, Oheo, and Bonner (102), using extracts from 
tobacco leaves infected with tobacco mosaic virus obtained re¬ 
sults indicating the value of electrophoresis as a method of 
detecting infection. The methods used were very similar to those 
developed in the study of spinach 1b af cytoplasmic proteins (100). 
The cytoplasmic proteins of healthy leaves consisted of an 
electrophoretically homogeneous component representing 75$ of the 
cytoplasmic protein, and minor fast moving components* Infected 
leaves have a new component which, when separated electrophore¬ 
tically, produces characteristic local lesions on test plants* 

The virus protein was detected electrophoretically as early as 
three days after infection, but after the twelfth day, the amount 
of virus appeared to become static* While the virus protein

increased there was a proportionate decrease in the normal cyto¬ 
plasmic protein# Since the maximum virus synthesis can occur 
before a detectable change in chlorophyll, the virus synthesis 
would not appear to have proceeded at the expense of the chlo¬ 
rophyll as suggested by Woods and DuBuy (103)# The character¬ 
istic pigment changes accompanying the disease could be a se¬ 
condary affect caused by a metabolic upset in the plant due to 
cytoplasmic protein changes# 

Price (78) reports the preparation of purified southern 
bean mosaic virus by fractionating the juice from infected bean 
plants# The fractionation was carried out by alternating cycles 
of high- and low-speed centrifugation or by chemical treatment 
using ammonium sulfate and alcohol# Although still containing 
a considerable amount of dark pigment, purified virus pre¬ 
parations were essentially homogeneous on the basis of electro¬ 
phoretic, diffusion and high-speed centrifugal results# This 
bean mosaic virus was eventually crystallized. Miller and 
Price (68) found that crystallization by dialysis against dis¬ 
tilled water was retarded when they used a pigmented sample of 
virus#. By dialysis against an acetate buffer at pH 5#5 even a 
sample containing large amounts of pigment could be crystallized# 
Under such conditions, however, the pigment disappeared almost 
completely from the mother liquor but constitiited a part of the

crystals® Price (79) reported earlier that pigment interfered 
with the crystallization of southern bean mosaic when using salt 
for crystallization® 

Lauffer and Price ( 63 ) were able to prepare southern 
bean mosaic virus free of pigment by an electrophoretic techni¬ 
que* Such a purification was possible since in phosphate buffer 
of pH 7 9 the pigmented material migrated faster than the virus® 
With the aid of a four-piece Tiselius cell the authors obtained a 
virus preparation almost completely free of pigment* Lauffer and 
Price also report a unique method by which virus preparations can 

be concentrated without using chemical precipitation* The sap 

. o 

from infected bean plants was dialysed against egg white at 4 C* 
In three weeks the volume of sap was reduced to about one fifth 
the original volume* The authors suggest this method of volume 
reduction depends upon the differences in the colloidal osmotic 
pressures of the egg white and of the sap® 


MATERIAL AND METHODS 


The original aim of this work was to use electropho¬ 
resis as a method of diagnosis to supplement visual methods of 
diagnosing virus diseases in plants* As already indicated, the

literature reports that electrophoretic analysis has shown virus 
infection before visual symptoms have appeared# Such a sup¬ 
plementary method would be especially useful where symptoms 
of the disease are not very pronounced. 

The material used here consisted of healthy potato 
plants of the Netted Gem variety as well as plants of the 
same variety which were infected with leaf roll virus (Corium 
solani ), According to Chester ( 18 ), this virus is transmitted 
by aphids and affects only potatoes and a few other closely re¬ 
lated Solanaceae* Infected plants are pale and dwarfed with 
thick leathery leaves that are rolled upward# Tubers are few 
and small# 

Infected and healthy tubers were supplied by the Plant 
Pathology Division and planted in separate field plots during 
the summer of 195 > 0 # Preliminary protein extractions were carried 
out on the green leaves when the plants had each produced several 
leaveso The first attempt to extract protein from the green 
material was with the Waring Blendor using whole green leaves 
with only the petioles removed# 

The previous year considerable time was spent attempt¬ 
ing to get suitable protein extracts from greenhouse-grown bean 
leaves and stems by blendor treatment* This protein extraction 
from bean plants had been started because of the effect that 
2,I{-D treatments have been shown to have on the nitrogen content

of various parts of the bean plant* Treatments usually 
decreased leaf nitrogen while the nitrogen content of stems 
was greatly increased by 2,4.-D (22)* If satisfactory ex¬ 
tractions of protein could be obtained, electrophoretic analysis 
might bring forth additional information concerning these changes 
in nitrogen metabolism* 

The Waring Blendor was used only because equipment 
available for protein extraction of green material was limited* 
The blendor was set up in the refrigerator as no cold room 
facilities were available in the laboratory* Foaming was pre¬ 
vented by using a screw lid on the blendor bowl* Heating was 
prevented as much as possible by running the blendor for short 
intervals and allowing periods of cooling* A dry ice jacket was 
sometimes used as well* 

The literature shows no clear-cut evidence as to the 
denaturation which may occur during blending; however, there is 
some evidence that this deleterious effect is inherent in the 
method. Fishman and Moyer (29) used the Waring Blendor in at¬ 
tempts to prepare preparations of the protein-chlorophyll com¬ 
plex of Aspidistra elatior and Phaseolus vulgaris but found a 
large volume of foam was produced with considerable denaturation 
on disruption of the leaf material* Furthermore, the material 
purified in this way precipitated quite rapidly during the course

of several days 0 This foaming reported by Fishman and Moyer 
can be readily prevented by using a screw lid on the blendor bowl 
after it has been completely filled with the solvent and leaf 
material to be disrupted# 

On the other hand, Frampton and Takahashi (3$) report that 
the Waring Blendor had no influence on electrophoretic patterns 
obtained with the proteins from healthy tobacco plants, tobacco 
plants infected with tobacco mosaic virus, or virus-free tubers# 
This situation does not necessarily hold true for extractable pro¬ 
teins from other plants# 

Wildman and Bonner (100) used a Stephen Blendor to 
aid in the extraction of leaf proteins# Their objections to 
the blendor as compared to the colloid mill were poorer mixing 
in the blendor and rapid heating which was difficult to control 
even with a dry ice jacket 0 

Following the unsatisfactory extraction results for 
potato leaf protein by the Waring Blendor, and because equip¬ 
ment such as a colloid mill was unavailable, attempts were made 
to obtain protein dispersions suitable for electrophoresis by 
extraction of potato leaves dried by lyophilization# The lyo- 
philization equipment consisted of an insulated wooden box con¬ 
taining a dry ice-acetone bath large enough for a desiccator# 

The desiccator was evacuated by means of a vacuum pump# When

dry, the leaves were ball-milled and stored in stoppered contain¬ 
ers at room temperature until ready for use* 

Extraction procedures on the dried material were 
similar to those used previously for pea and squash seeds* 
Following extraction and dialysis at refrigerator temperatures, 
electrophoresis was attempted using the conventional apparatus* 
Because of the heavy pigmentation of the extracts, infrared 
film was substituted for the photographic plates ordinarily usedo 


EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 


Bean Stems, and Leaves 


Since use of the Waring Blendor was first made on fresh 
bean stems and leaves some extraction results are given for this 
material. Most interest was attached to the s terns since 
treatment had such a marked effect on them. Since the stems are 
less heavily pigmented than the leaves they are more suitable for 
electrophoretic analysis*

Some typical extraction results are as follows* Fresh 
coarsely chopped bean stems and buffer (0*2M-NaCl;; 0*03M-Na2HP0^ 

0 o 02M-NaH2P0[j_) were used in the weight ratio 1:10* Following a 
total blending time of ten minutes, the slurry was suction fil¬ 
tered* Seventy four per cent of the stem nitrogen 7/as extracted* 
Under similar conditions 0„8 n trichloroacetic acid dispersed 67 $ 
of the stem nitrogen thus indicating a large amount of the stem 
nitrogen is nonprotein* The fact that the buffer dispersed 
mostly nonprotein nitrogen was substantiated when dialysis 
removed a high percentage of the nitrogen from the buffer extract 
Extracts of leaves were higher in protein nitrogen but 
s m aller amounts of the nitrogen present in the fresh leaves were 
extracted than in the case of the stems* 

Because of the large percentage of nonprotein nitrogen 
extracted from stems, no extract was obtained which, after dialy¬ 
sis, was concentrated enough for electrophoretic analysis* No 
supplementary methods of concentrating the extracts were tried* 

In the case of leaves, by reusing the buffer, dialysed 
extracts could be obtained which were concentrated enough for 
electrophoresis, however, the percentage of nitrogen extracted 
was reducedo

Potato Leaves 


Because the Waring Blendor disrupted the coarse potato 
leaves even less than bean leaves, and due to the difficulty 
of keeping the material near freezing during extraction, use 
of the blendor was discarded entirely* 

Extractions were next done on leaf material which had 
been lyophilized and ball-milled* The buffers used were all 
of pH 7 or higher as Wildman, Cheo and Bonner (102) report 
isoelectric precipitation of tobacco cytoplasmic protein when 
grinding leaves in poorly buffered solutions* Preliminary 
extraction results using a 1:10 ratio indicated that the pro¬ 
tein concentration of the extract was not high enough for sat¬ 
isfactory electrophoresis* A 1:5 ratio gave the results listed 
in Table 3* 

The infected and healthy leaves show very little dif¬ 
ference as to solubility of nitrogen* The low percentage of 
extraction in all cases is probably due, at least in part, to 
the comparatively large amount of dried material extracted with 
a rather small volume of buffer*

Although the extracts were sufficiently high in protein 
content, the pigment content was also great* Pigmentation was 
so intense that electrophoretic scanning patterns could not be 
obtained by use of ordinary photographic plates or infrared 
film* 

Ether extraction of the dried material, prior to ex¬ 
traction, removed large amounts of pigment, but the buffer ex¬ 
tracts from ether extracted leaves were still too highly pig¬ 
mented for electrophoretic analysis.

DISCUSSION 


The attempts to use electrophoresis for analysis of 
protein from green plant material produced very unsatisfactory 
results# The extraction procedures used proved to be inade¬ 
quate# On the whole, extracts obtained by using the Waring 
Blendor were too dilute for electrophoretic analysis# Even 
more serious was the fact that the protein extracted was sub¬ 
jected to adverse conditions because blending is a rigorous 
treatment* Besides, facilities available made it impossible to 
do the extractions near freezing temperatures* At the higher 
temperatures the chances of enzyme activity and denaturation were 
probably increased* 

Although the amount of nitrogen extracted from lyophil- 
ized leaves was less than one-half the total present in the leaf, 

•7 

this method provided extracts which, as such, were concentrated 
enough in protein for electrophoretic analysis# However, the 
pigmentation of such extracts is too great for electrophoretic 
analysis# Unfortunately, the amount of dried material prepared 
was not sufficient to try methods for removal of the pigment* 
Whatever these methods may be, they represent another step which 

may have a denaturing action on the protein Q

Frampton and Takahashi (35) summarize the whole pro¬ 
blem of extracting leaf proteins with the following well 
chosen words 

"The* methods available for the extraction of leaf 
proteins are far from satisfactory, and the total quantity of 
protein extracted in any case is only a fraction of the total 
leaf protein 0 Those normal leaf proteins which have been ex¬ 
tracted are difficult to handle; none of them have ever been 
crystallized© As for the viruses themselves, except for those 
which have been isolated, very little may be said concerning 
the conditions under which they become soluble, the ease with 
which they become denatured or their relative concentrations 
in the plant saps*’ 1 

Thus the whole problem is at present in a very unsat¬ 
isfactory state with little prospect of improvement through 
use of present known methods© The colloid mill treatment for 
extraction of leaf proteins appears to be the most satisfactory 
method available despite its rigorous nature©
