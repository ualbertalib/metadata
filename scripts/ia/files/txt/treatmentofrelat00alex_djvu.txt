STATEMENT OF THESIS

STATEMENT OF THESIS 


Any study of moral behavior must in these times begin with some 

1 

basic postulates. My basic contention is: that personality is the 
only thing within the whole range of our h um an experience that makes 
ch oices between right an d wrong• It is,, furthe r, t he only e ntity wit h¬ 
in the l imit s of our knowl e dge whic h p laces value s upon the objects and 
a ctivities w ith which we h umans deal . Only personality a ttempts to order 
them according to their relativ e qua liti es . In sho r t, pe rsonality is the 
on ly pa rt of th e universe we kno w that makes va lue judg ment s. 

My next contention is: that according; t o all the evidence yet dis ¬ 
cove red this pers onality as it exi st s in men can not only make 
j udgem ent s but in some degree at .leas t it can motivate men to act i n 
accordan ce with its judgements of right and wrong; o f better o;r wor se 
cours es of action. 

If man is not free to choose in seme measure and to act in accordance 
with his choices then there can be no ethics and we need go no further ibr 
man is only a product of his environment. I subnit that, as a matter of 
fact, there is freedom of response among humans as can be attested by look- 
ing at the results of any classroom experiment which attempts to produce a 
uniform environment for all students. The responses received are almost 
as various as the number of persons involved. There is no evidence to prove 
that good conditions always produce good people nor that bad conditions 
always produce poor citizens. It Is onJyr In certain fields of philosophy, 
psychology, and religious thinking that the suggestion ever arises that 
man has no ability to make moral choices and in these fields even by their 
own standards the arguments fall apart at one place or another. On the other

hand we cannot overlook the discoveries of recent thought which go to 

show- there are many forees at work to limit human freedom. However, 

even in the physical world of science there is no longer any reason 

to believe that the material world is completely mechanical or determined. 

C. W. Miller, for example, points out that in the physicist’s laws of 

gases it is necessary to formulate and to hold two unproven theories - the 

quantum and the mechanical - to account for the activities of that part 
1 

of the world. It is even less surprising that in human behavior the solu¬ 
tion to the logical problem of free will versus determinism is a compromise 
between the two. I believe, then, that it is not only a good working 
hypothesis but a fact of experience that there is in the nature of man 
some freedom to make moral choices and some ability to act accordingly. 

My thesis is: THAT MORAL CHO ICE S MD MORAL ACTION AR E HOT THE 
FUNCTION OF THE REASON, EMOTIONS. WILL OH ANY OTHER PART OF THE HOMAN 
CONSTITUTION BUT ARE TEE FUNCTION OF THE PERSONALITY AS A WHOLE. THE 
THI NG WHICH DE TERMI NES THE MORAL ACTIVITY OF A P ER SONALITY IS THE NATURE 
AND QUALITY OF THE PERSONAL INFLUENCES IN THE PRESEN C E OF WHICH A MAN FI NDS 
HIMSELF . THE ONLY TRUE AND RE WARDING Q UEST IN ETH ICS IS THEREFORE THE 
SEARCH FOR THE PERSONAL VAL UES AN D FORCES WHICH EXIST IN THE WORLD APART 
FROM PARTICULAR MEN . TRUE MORAL ACTION IS T HE RESPONSE TO ANOTHER PERSON¬ 
ALITY . THE HIGHEST MORALITY WILL COME FROM RESPONSE TO THE PERSONALITY 
WHIC H PERVAD ES TEE UNIVERSE. 

When a person exists in the presence of another person his activity 
depends, partly at least, on the quality of that Oth§,F personality. When 
his values correspond to the moral judgements of his neighbor then they 
will call the same things good and the same things evil; they will both 
choose one course of action before they will choose another and there will 
be no conflict between them. On the other hand if the things which one man

counts important are not important to his neighbor then if they 
are going to live together in harmony one or both of the men may 
have to change his ways of living until they can both agree on what 
things are important and what things are not* 

When an individual lives in that complex of personalities which 
we call society his activity is in a grecfcmeasure judged and determined 
by the quality of the judgments which societj' makes* To live in harmony 
with society he must respect the ways and things which society judges to 
be valuable and he must reject some of the things which society counts to 
be of little or no value* According to the standards of society he vd.ll 
be judged good or bad accordingly as he responds to the nature of his 
society 1 s personal judgments. 

Above society religion finds another personal force which is in¬ 
dependent of society and the judgments of men and is the moral part of the 
universe. Not only does it uphold the basic values by which society must 
live, but it is the personality which sets the standards for which men and 
society must strive if there is to be progress toward good life and good 
society* It is in response to this supreme personality that all truly 
ethical living comes and it is only as this personality is discovered or 
revealed that moral progress will come. 

There are two main currents still running through modern thought 
as it concerns itself with human conduct. The first is the field of enquiry 
which is explored by the philosopher and is known by the broad term 1 moral 
philosophy 1 or is called ethics*. The second and older field of enquiry is 
that made by the man who begins with God and approaches human conduct in the 
light of his understanding and knowledge of God. This is the field of the 
theologian and for him ethics is the practical application of his faith to 


the conduct of life

Moral philosophers, on the whole, reject theology as having no 
value for the study of morals and usually consider it irrevelant to 
problems of conduct* The editor of a modern text book on ethical theory, 
for example, deals cursorily with religion in his introduction to the text 
and then rejects it completely as having any value for moral instruction, 
criticism, or progress* (l) The fatal question concerning religion as a 
moral teacher he believes was asked long ago by Socrates who queried; is a 
thing holy because it is loved by the gods, or is it loved by the gods be- 
cause it is holy? He implies along with Socrates that when you have raised 
the question whether God himself is good or whether we humans make the gods 
and then have then put their stamp of approval on what is already good, then 
you have asked a question which cannot be answered and have thereby disposed 
of theology as a field of thought to be reckoned with in moral philogphy. 
Theology, he says, is illogical, "If theology is irrelevant to logic, then, 
by the same token, it is irrelevant to moral philosophy,® (2) 

Harold H* Titus in his text-book states, "the moral standards of men 
depend upon the stage of social development, upon the level of intelligence, 
and upon the knowledge which is available at the time,® (3) "Our morals like 
our bodies and our social life, are the product of long periods of develop¬ 
ment and adaptation to environmental conditions? (4) In his thinking there is 
no place in the environment for religious thought and according to his theory 
morality is determined by social, intellectual, and physical forces only* The 
attitude of these two men is indicative of the general and prevalent attitude 
of moral philosophers toward religion| that if theology does not confirm to 
reason or it if cannot be organized within the patterns of pure logic then 
philosophy and theology must forever part company*

It is precisely in the field of moral philosophy that I believe this 
attitude breaks down and becomes unjustified. Therefore I am going to 
endeavour to show; firstly, that moral philosophy by the standards of reason 
and science and the frame of reference which these men use cannot solve the 
problems of ethics nor can they discover a standard for action which will 
produce moral progress. Secondly, that in the field of ethics there is a 
place at which philosophy and theology must join forces; that there is a 
place in human thought where reason and revelation must meet if we are to 
discover any working system of thinking by which we may guide human activity.

man 

When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, 
the moon and stars which thou hast ordained; 

What is man that thou art mindful of him.? 

Psalm 8s 3,4 

The essential problems of man have never been better presented 
than by the writer of the eighth Psalm in the words above® A great 
deal of searching has been done since the day when he was writing and 
many, many answers have been given but whenever anyone intent on dis¬ 
covering truth for himself begins to work he begins by asking after 
all these years the same question which the psalmist asks® When we 
turn our eyes to the world of nature and the universe about us and even 
after all the great discoveries and pronouncements of wise men of science 
and philosophy have been made we still find ourselves aeburning from the 
outer world to ourselves and asking * what is man? 8 . 

If we would answer the question 9 how ought man to live ? 8 we find 
that we first have to answer the question 8 how can we * who are ourselves 
part of mankind f know what our true relationship with all the world about 
us is? 9 . When we have discovered that,if we ever can, then we shall have 
to ask 9 how does man proceed to live so that he may play his part in the 
great drama of the universe according to the standards of action which 
somehow he feels there ought to be? 9 . Is ibr man himself who decides how 
his part ought to be played and then proceeds to applaud or to condemn, 
or has God set him on the stage of life and set the standards of action 
for which he must aim? These are the questions which modern thinkers must 
answer. 

There are within our society three groups of men who have some¬ 
thing to say about these questions and if we would understand how modem 

man attempts to know his world and himself we must understand the corrbri-

bution and place of the Philosopher, the Scientist, and the Theologian. 
There is by no means any great agreement among these three groups of 
thinkers nor can we say that among them they have decided where the 
boundaries of one’s thought leaves off and the other begins. Further 
we cannot be content with the sort of classification which infers that 
science begins on the foundation of knowledge and is the only true wis¬ 
dom and where it leaves off philosophy begins. When philosophy has to 
admit its limits then we go on faith and that is theology. Nor can we 
be happy with the thinking within any group which takes no account of 
the contributions which come from the other men. Happily today few 
honest philosophers, theologians or scientists will claim that his body 
of truth and his alone can answer the questions which man asks. 

Before proceeding, therefore, we must define some terms which 
we shall be using. We must attempt to define the boundaries between 
reason, science, and revelation, and estimate where these three fields 
of knowledge meet and where they diverge from each other. We shall 
attempt to describe the faculties of man through which he obtains 
knowledge not only of his world but also of himself.

REASON 












8 


REASON 

Reason, broadly speaking, is the term used to describe the 
faculty of the human personality through which man receives and uses 
his experience of the world according to his capacity to order those 
experiences into a consistent pattern. To adequately define the realm 
and function of reason would take us into the whole field of philosophy 
which explores the ability and capacity of man to seek for and to know 
truth. This is a field apart from our present purposes but we cannot 
use the term properly without looking briefly at some of the develop¬ 
ments in our understanding of the ability and function of the human reason. 
The starting point of philosophical or theological discussion con¬ 
cerning modern thought today seems to begin inevitably with Immanuel Kant 

1 

and his “Critique of Pure Reason”, Kant came into the world at a time 
when two widely divergent views were held. On the one side there were 
those rationalists who still believed in the unbounded power of the human 
reason to discover truth just as some had believed ever since the great 
Greek philosophers. On the other side there were those who were question¬ 
ing the very ability of reason to achieve any knowledge which was beyond 
a doubt. The same movement had taken place in theological thinking. The 
’Schoolmen* like Thomas Aquinas had devoted their efforts to reconciling 
reason and revelation. By Kant’s time, however, thinking had moved through 
a phase in which there came to be a complete separation of revelation and 
reason in the thinking of men like Occam. The Reformers, Luther and Calvin, 
had a deep suspicion of reason. The scepticism of Hume plus the new 
scientific principles.

thought must make its start with him,”

of Newton along with the theological suspicion of reason brought Kant 
to do some deep philosophical probing to answer the question "can the 
mind achieve any valid knowledge whatsoever?" 

His analysis of reason set the stage for almost all modern dis¬ 
cussion concerning the powers of the human mind* There is absolute 
certainty, he says, in only one area of experience and that is know¬ 
ledge of those objects which can be experienced not only by the senses 
of man but can also be tested and proved by scientific methods* Know¬ 
ledge, therefore, is restricted to the area of truth which scientific study 
can reveal* Aesthetics, religion, personal, or Individual experiences 
do not become part of real knowledge* We shall see presently how it was 
easy for this attitude to grow into the modern attitude which accepts only 
scientific knowledge* "The modern mind has come to believe that knowledge 
is to be defined as that which can be demonstrated (as in mathematics) or 

can be shown indirectly to be reasonably certain through the application 

2 

of the scientific method (as in empirical sciences)* 

There are great areas of experience, however, with which a man is 
always confronted and in order to live he must have seme working relation¬ 
ship with these objects* We may never discover, for instance, what a chair 
really is although we may know that it exists* Consequently ©van though 
we may have no true knowledge of a chair yet we must live as if it exists

See also, Otto, Max: The H uman Ihterprise p* 251 

"They (the modern minds) believe in Science and in what the 
scientists tell them, very much as their ancestors believed in 
the Church and what they were told by the priests."

as we see it and feel it and we may sit on it as if it were really there. 

This Kant calls 1 faith 1 and it is, in effect, the kind of knowledge that 
governs all our relations with the other people about us and the environ¬ 
ment in which we find ourselves. This area of reason, which we today realise 
is dependent for its validity on the ability of persons to make adequate 
judgments about it, has fallen into disrepute as a source of knowledge about 
the real world. More and more we want to subject even those objects and 
activities which do not lend themselves well to scientific investigation 
to completely objective study. 

Kant* s problem was the same as ours, ”how does a man with the mind 
he has, come to know the real nature of the universe?” Whether Ms analysis 
of the abilities of the mind was complete or not, he did come to grips with the 
obvious fact that the human mind has very definite limits. 

A very recent analysis of reason has been presented by the theologian 

Paul Tillich who points out that there are two realms of activity in the mind 

1 

for which we use the term reason. We use the terra reason for that process 
of thought by which men bring about the -things which they desire or acid eve 
the ends they want. If, for instance, a person becomes convinced that the 
good world is one in wMch there are no red haired people than this form of 
reason will be used to guide him ineeradicating red-haired people from the 
earth in the most systematic and efficient manner. It does not, however, 
lead him to examine the idea that the good world can be ushered in by such 
extermination. This part of reason is, therefore only the human mind at 
work discovering means to accomplish ends. TMs function of reason he calls 
technical reason.*

This is far from a complete description of reason and -without the 
more basic concept which was largely the classical understanding of reason, 
technical reason would be only a logical and methodological system of 
thought which dehumanises man and his world* There is another part of 
reason which is the structure of the mind which recognizes the world, makes 
judgments about it and finds meaning in it* It is cognitive and aesthetic, 
theoretical and practical, detached and passionate, subjective and objective. 

It is the ground to which technical reason must ever be returning for direc¬ 
tion and support* You may, for example, analyze a man physiologically, 
psychologically, and perhaps even chemically and in so doing discover a 
great deal about him which can be used for certain purposes. But to claim 
that in such analyses you know the man would be utter folly* The wholeness 
of his nature and the reality of his life are not found in that kind of anslysls 
and the same holds true of the analysis of almost every object within our 
experience. It is in this area of drawing together the elements of experi¬ 
ence to understand the nature of things as they are that this part of reason 
functions* It has to do with man as a being in his appreciation and under¬ 
standing of, and his relation to all other things which exist* For this reason 
Tillich calls it *the ontological concept of reason. 1 Reason, then, has two 
important functions. One of them is to analyse and organize the elements of 
experience in order to control tham for man 1 s own purposes; the other is to 
see reality as a whole and learn from the objects of experience the nature of 
their existence. 

From these discussions of the nature of the mind as philosophy sees 

it, we may conclude that reason is n th© structure of the mind which enables 

1 

the mind to grasp and transform reality. w The main difference between our con¬ 
cept of reason and that of the ancient philosopher is that we have a greater

appreciation of the limitations of the human reason in discovering truth. 

We shall therefore use the term reason during this Thesis, as, the sum 
total of the capacities of the mind to discover truth; realizi ng that 
within the concept there are both the functions of abstraction and categoriz¬ 
ing of technical reason* and the actual expe rienti al activities of *ontolo - 
gical reason* which depend for their value upon one another. 


















SCIENCE 








13 


SCIENCE 

Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as science unless it 
is considered to be the term which lumps together the attitudes, methods, 
procedures and discoveries that ape known as scientific. Mas; Otto points 
out that the popular mind in thinking of science does not generally make 
a distinction between science, which It conceives as some huge entity with 
an existence of its own, and the scientists who follow the discipline of 
a scientific method in the examination of the real world. We ought, there¬ 
fore, to examine the component parts of the scientific world so that when 
we use the word science, we use it with an appreciation of the realms of 
knowledge in which it operates and its power to discover truth within 
those areas. 

The first step in understanding science is to realize that when 
it makes its pronouncements it does so through the mouths of individual men 
and women who have used a special method to discover a special kind of 
knowledge. A scientist is human and as such he has all the emotional ten¬ 
dencies which other men have in observing his world. By loyalty to the 
categories of his method, however, he comes to carefully tested and skilfully 
observed conclusions about the object of his study. When his conclusions can 
be accepted by all men using the same methods concerning the same object then 
his discovery is considered to be scientific truth. "We arempable" says 
Max Otto, "of realizing that science is a company of investigators, able, 

highly trained and well equipped, but still human beings, tempted in all 

1 

points like as we are, yet without emotional sin". 

The aim of a scientist, then, is to investigate reality as it is with 
as little influence or interference from his own desires and limitations as 
is humanly possible. What he studies he studies empirically and aims to prove 
all his observations by demonstrations which do not depend for their validity

on inner personal conviction. This ujeans that if science wants to be 
completely objective, its field of study must be limited entirely to the 
realm of material objects which lends itself to empirical observation and 
in which it is never necessary to make a choice between good and bad data 
but only between Itrue and untrue observations. In other words* pure science 
is concerned only with facts. The structure, substance and properties of 
nature are his concern. The judgment of values belongs to another field 
of research. 

Scientists can discover hoy/ to split the atom and produce atomic 

bombs from their discovered knowledge, and in so doing, they are using 

science purely in its theoretical and practical capacities. However, when 

it comes to using the bomb, the question of whether the bomb should or 

should not be used leads the scientist to begin making judgments which are 

no longer purely objective and he must make his choice on much the same 

basis as other men. His technical knowledge and intimate relation to the 

bomb may make it possible for him to foresee results of its use which other 

men do not see but when he comes to decide whether those results are good 

or bad then he is no longer a pure scientist bit is also a philosopher. 

He may be a theologian. At any rate he is a moralist. It is common 

knowledge, however, that scientists do not remain within the area of pure 

objectivity nor have they confined themselves to the study of material 

objects. Consequently, we have today the human sciences of sociology, 

anthropology, and psychology. Students within these fields do not 

hesitate a moment to claim for themselves the title of scientists and 

for their study the name 1 science 5 . Physiology is the science of man 8 s 

physical make-up while sociology studies groups of mankind in a scientific 

way. Psychology is defined by Woodworth and Marquis in their elementary 
1 

test books in that field as "the science of the activities of the individual 11 .

In an earlier edition Woodworth makes a great claim for psychology "A 

science of human behavior - now in the making, though lagging far behind 

the progress of the physical and biological sciences - will furnish the 

2 

basis for good management of human affairs”• While Dr, Munn in his book 

1 P sychology 1 * * 4 defines a science as "an organized body of reliable informa- 
5 

tier", Evidently, then science is not defined by the subject matter with 
which it deals but it is rather a method which can be applied to many 
fields. Nor can it be any longer confined to knowledge which is gained 
by completely disinterested and impersonal study into which no judgments 
of value enter. Human sciences today maintain the right and the responsi¬ 
bility of formulating some of their own standards by which they test their 
observations. These categories can not over look and, indeed, recognize 
the importance of properly made value judgments. Without these value 
judgments there could be no scientific study of history or society and, 
in fact, most of the psychological study made makes these judgments in one 
form or another. It is interesting to note that in the statement quoted 

above R. S. Woodworth says "a science of human behavior . will furnish 

the basis for good management of human affairs," By including the word 
f good f Yd thin his statement he brings a qualitative element Into his under¬ 
standing of psychology* *’or a scientist to claim to furnish a basis for the 
management of huaan affairs would be a legitimate claim but to say that it 
will be a , good f basis is not a, scientific statement. As a matter of fact, 
the results of science have often been as harmful as they have been con¬ 
structive to society and humanity; not because they are not true, but for 
4 

other reasons. It is not therefore In the power of science to make value

judgments though it may well guide those judgments to safer ground. 

This brings us to say that the so called human sciences of sociology 
and psychology, history, and even scientific theology axe not pure sciences 
hut include within them elements of philosophy. They are at best philoso¬ 
phers guided by scientific research and the scientific method, insofar as 
it can be applied. As Alan Richardson puts it M If one uses words accurately 
scientific method is a term which can be applied only to matters which are 
susceptible of being tested ty actual experiment and thus of truly scientific 
verification ...... ”The scientific attitude”, or scientific humanism, is 

not science but philosophy”. 

This conclusion is most vividly illustrated in the field of psychology 
where it is man himself who is under scientific scrutiny. In order to study 

man by the scientific method alone it is necessary to assume that he is a 

1 

completely determined being. If it were possible to discover every influence 
in his world and within himself that affects his being, then you could pre¬ 
dict what a man’s actions wall be. Conversely when man does act, it should 
be possible to trace out the environmental influences which produce his 
activity. To hold this as an hypothesis to be tested by experiment is not 

an unscientific procedure but to proclaim it as a finding of science or even 

2 

an attitude of psychology is to surrender a sound ideal of science. As long 
as psychology wants to remain a pure science it must make no claims except 
to discover by experiment how a man does, in fact, act. These discoveries 
may greatly influence the psychologist’s judgments about how man is able to 
act and they may help him in deciding how a man should act. In deciding how 
a man should act, however, a new field of reason enters the picture and he 
no longer makes his decision on the basis of scientific knowledge alone. 

1. This comes in different forms from the psychologies of Behaviorism 

and fiveudian psychology, - Cf. Brown J.F.s ”The Psycho dynamics 
of Abnormal Behavior” - Personality has its genesis in the way in which 
individuals of specific biological constitution meet barriers in the 
psychological field.” R. See H.P. Van Dusen • Ibid? 59.

If it were possible to prove that man is psychologically determined 
then there would be no room for morel choices and no place for the philo¬ 
sophy of ethics. Psychology has done a great service in bringing 
philosophy to realise that man is n6t as undetermined nor is his power 
of reason as boundless as men would like to believe. On the other hand, 
it has not, as a science, discovered any method of studying the values 

by which men live and as long as men still make moral choices we must 

3 

continue to study man in ways that are not •scientific*. 

Let us define science then as that field of facts which is dis¬ 
covered by hypothesis and experiment end can not be doubted to exist. 

It is that attitude which is expressed by Thomas Italy, "a man should be 
willing to sit down before facts like a little child and follow where 
they lead.”

THEOLOGY 









18 


THEO LOGY 

Theology is defined in the Oxford dictionary as !, the study 
or science which treats of God his nature and his attribute, and his 
relations with man and the universe, ! the science of things divine® . 

(Hooker) 11 • According to the above discussions of science, theology is 
not a science. That is not to say that it is not an orderly, and in 
some sense experimental study, but it cannot be asked to furnish the 
same kind of objective, disinterested and impersonal proofs that we ask 
of the physical scientist or even the philosopher. It is the conviction of 
the theologian that there are some ultimate truths and ultimate values 
which neither reason nor science discover and that are yet not beyond human 
experience. The satisfaction, for instance, received from a piece of music 
can not be analysed or understood by the categories of either reason or 
science and yet the experience of aesthetic satisfaction is a reality of ex¬ 
perience, So, also, there are inter-personal relations between a man and 
his fellow men that reason and science do not comprehend and yet man cannot 
exist and doubt the reality of those experiences. Beyond the experiences 
of particular parts of the world and with other people there is the aware¬ 
ness of the sum total of all his environment which we call the universe* 

The response of men to the infinite has almost universally been that of 
1 

person to person and all religion comes from believing that in the reality 
of nature there is a personal element which, in some sense at least, is re¬ 
sponsive to man. Scientific postulates which once threatened to destroy 
faith in any personal reality by holding that all nature works by unbreakable 
laws and mechanical precision which make no place for God, no longer shake

the foundations of faith so completely* Even in the structure of the 

physical world a mechanistic view is no longer possible and manv scientists 

1 

give unqualified support to the possibility of personal forces. 

The mind of the man on the street does not, however, generally make 
this estimate of science and as late as 1940 a philosopher estimated that 
"The public mind is pretty well made up that from the standpoint of science 
the world is without meaning, not only the far flung world of the astronomer 

and the physicist, but the nearer world of the geologist, biologist, and 

2 

the rest 1 *. So it becomes the task of theology to make its thought re-instate 
in the minds of men the understanding of personal forces which give meaning 
to the world* A scientist as such may say he believes in God, but he cannot 
as a scientist describe the nature or attributes of that being* It is 
therefore in this realm of the personal experience of infinite reality that 
theology must work. 

Theology studies the concepts to which men have come concerning 
the nature of God using wherever it can the processes of reason and science. 
Recognizing, however, that there are human limits to reason and believing 
that the personal reality of the universe is himself active in making his 
nature known theology also studies * revelation 1 of God* Let it be under¬ 
stood here that it is not as if human reason (including science) goes its 
limit and then begins to speculate about God but as we shall see in a moment 
reason itself by its very nature seeks revelation. For a discussion of the 

relationship between reason and revelation, I believe there is none better 

§ 

than that given by Paul Tillich in his systematic Theology. Our outline

of it must, of necessity, be over simplified but it will help us in 
understanding the scope of theological study. The human mind is finite 
and sees the world about in terms of finite categories such as time, space, and 
cause. Indeed there could be no dealings with reality if it were not for 
these finite categories. There is however beyond these observations a realm 
of Something there* which is there before reason begins to work and which 
reason realises it does not completely comprehend, x t is not something 
which further analysis will discover but it is what analysis explores in 
compartments and not as a whole. It is truth itself or beauty itself, 
or *love itself® or ultimately ’being itself®. This Tillich calls ’depth 
of reason*. It is not unlike the part of a living organism which chemical, 
physical, and psychological analysis fails to reveal for as they analyse 

1 

it, it disappears, ^uch analysis will never reveal reality in its entirety. 
Again we see two methods at work within the field of reason. One 
element of reason can function independently of reality itself or, as he calls 
it, the depth of reason. Its only guiding principle is the law of reason 
which it finds within the mind itself and which it discovers in the 

universe. This does not mean as some imply, that such reason leads the 

t 

individual to be a ’law unto himself®. It means that he follows the law 
of reason which exists in his mind apart from his wants, desires, and in 
nature apart from its depth. This reason is then its own law and he calls 
it autonomous (otrfd^ - self, vo>l6s - law) reason. It is such reasoning 
as produces the so-called laws of nature, constructs mathematical systems, 
and analyses society according to the specifications of logical analysis.

The other element of the mind is that which is guided not by 
any law of its own but by the law of an outside authority. This 
authority usually claims to represent the true nature of the part of 
reality which autonomous reason cannot grasp and it speaks in an un¬ 
conditional and ultimate way. In the past it often spoke in terms of 
myth and cult and today speaks in the form of political ideals as well 
as religions (e,g. , Communism and Roman Catholicism). If one or all 
parts of the mind accept this strange (ETEPOS) law (then reason 
becomes heteronomous or under the sway of another law than that whin.li it 
finds in itself or in nature. 

Naturally there is forever going to be a conflict between reason 

which accepts only the authority of its own law and reason which accepts 

the authority of an outer law. Consequently reason must look for some 

ground in which autonomous reason may be united with its own depth. It 

n©ds a concept which will keep reason from losing contact with its source 

of experldnc^nd yet does not make it dependent upon an outward authority 

which would eliminate the function of autonomous reason. This ground 

1 

Tillich believes is God because he is the law of structure and the source 
of reason. The unity of reason with its depth will take place under the 
law (v 0 M,d>s ) of God This he calls “theonomy 55 which is not the 

acceptance of divine law imposed on reason but autonomous reason united 
with its depth. It is in effect the union of man 5 s rational structure 
with reality itself. ^Therefore* 1 * says Tillich* 15 the quest for a re-union 

of what is always split in time and space arises out of reason and not in 

t 

opposition to it. This quest is the quest for revelation.

It can well be argued that the quest for revelation does not prove there 
is revelation and the search for a uniting concept between reason and 
reality does not prove God. But whether or not there is revelation it is 
still a necessity for reason to seek for some unity of knowledge in this 
field. 

Whether or not this analysis of reason and revelation is infallible 
is not our question at the moment but it seems to show that theology is 
concerned to study what is beyond the limits of reason. Yet because the 
human mind is finite it must do it within the limits of its own structure 
which we have seen is what w@ know 1- as reason. 

Finally, let us glance briefly at the attitude of theology to revela¬ 
tion. There was once a strict line drawn between natural and revealed 
theology. Natural theology being that knowledge of God which man himself 
drew out of the world of nature and 5 Revealed 8 being that which God gave 
in special ways through prophets. Church, and ’siting®. 1 It was the 

destination between working out a problem for yourself and having somebody 
1 

tell you the answer. There is no longer that distinction although the 

general division still remains. Men like Barth and Brunner say in effect 

that there is no knowledge which is not revelation. That is, man can re- 

2 

ceive no knowledge which God himself does not impart. Therefore, the 
distinction is simply between general and special revelation, and whatever 
man comes to know about either nature or scripture or experience is a part 
of God himself. As Dr. Temple says of the scripture w there is no such thing 
as revealed truth**. There are truths of revelation, that is to gay, propo¬ 
sitions which express the results of correct thinking concerning revelation;

bat they are not in themselves directly revealed. ,f Nature, then, 

has become a field of revelation but revelation is not a field of nature. 

In essence I think we have to agree with these views which try to 
make theology comprehend all knowledge before it makes its judgments. But 
it is a type of thinking which confuses the issue very greatly by destroy¬ 
ing the distinctive place of man in his approach to revelation. It leads 

to the kind of thinking that one lady is reported to have done about the 

1 

oil industry in Alberta n Go<iJmaw-J&akJlr^ 

so let it be discovered .” Let us therefore in our discussions save 
M revelation B for those areas of man 1 s experience in which he finds in 
reality truths which do not come by his own efforts alone and yet are not 
unharmonious with all other truth he can discover. In other words it is 
the place where God meets man in his search for the reality in his universe® 
This does not prevent the theologian, from attempting to incorporate within 
his thought all truth as it is discovered but he must make distinctions 
concerning the means by which that knowledge comes to him. Theology then 
is the study of the personal and organic nature of the universe which is 
commonly known as God.

PERSONALITY 







24 


PERSONALITY 

In the fall of the year 1951 a case came before the courts in 
the United States in which a man had stated in his will that the income 
from a large estate be left to "persons who believe in the fundamental 
principles of the Christian religion". The will was contested and it 
became necessaiy for those defending it to provide a definition of "the 
fundamentals of the Christian religion". After all the evidence had been 
produced and following much deliberation the judge decreed that the 
Christians had not been able to produce a definition upon which all agreed 

and that "the courts cannot furnish a definition of Christian fundamentals 

1 

themselves," 

The significant thing is not that Christians cannot agree on a definition 
but that they could not produce an interpretation which would satisfy all 
legal requirements, A religion of the spirit cannot be defined in terms 
of the law, especially secular law, nor IS it likely that the fundamentals 
of the Christian, religion could ever be defined in scientific terms that 
would satisfy all scientists. Further, the fact that Christians could not 
agree on their definitions indicates that the Religion is a concept in which, 
what seems most important to any one person or group may depend upon their 
approach to religion. In other words, in attempting to define one concept 
in terms of another we have to realize that we may have to be satisfied 
with an explanation w/hich will not satisfy all the requirements of every 
field of thought but can help us to express our meanings. 

The word personality is such a concept and our use of the term will 
not satisfy all the requirements of the scientist or the philosopher. We

shall in part satisfy these requirements and yet not lose sight of the 
total Impression in the interests of rational or scientific analysis. 

The fundamental concept in personality is that it is the complex 
of qasalities and characteristics which set one person apart from all 
others. 1'here are many elements such as intelligence, attitudes, appear¬ 
ances, emotional response and moral reactions which go to make up an 
individual person. It is not just the sum total of these elements which 
we call personality but it also is the special way in which they are com¬ 
bined, This is the general attitude of the psychologist to personality. 

Karl A. Menninger for instance uses it thus, "it means the individual as 
a whole, his height and weight and loves and hates and blood pressure 
and reflexes; his smiles and hopes and bowed legs and enlarged tonsils. 

It means all that anyone is and all that he is trying to become. This 

1 

is the modern psychiatric meaning of the term "personality". n 

Such a definition, however, says nothing except that everyone 
has a personality and by it we mean the individual as a whole. It is 
important on the other hand in pointing out that there is no longer anjr 
scientific or philosophic basis for dividing man up into two parts body 
and spirit, or calling him a ! ghost in a machine*. The bodjr affects per¬ 
sonality and the personality is expressed through the body. 

It should be noted In passing that scientific psychology in attempt¬ 
ing to examine personality has to abstract from it any moral elements. 
"Scientific thinking about personality requires that we abandon evaluative, 
good-bad, moralistic concepts and study human beings with the same motive

realism that we have learned to use s£> effectivelv in the physical 

1 

realm”. This is not, however, the attitude of all psychologists who 

claim a scientific approach. As, for example, Woodworth and Marquis who 

say ft Char a cter refers mostly to conduct that can he called right or 

wrong, that fails to meet the accepted social standards. Personalit y 

refers to behavior which, though not necessarily right or wrong, is 

pleasing or offensive to other people, favourable or unfavourable to the 

individual ! s standing with his fellows. The di stinction is not always 

2 

sharp and for our pu rposes m ay be disr egarded . j/ Once again we see that 
there is a fundamental conflict in the thinking of those who approach 
the study of human beings scientifically. Either to be scientific, they 
can admit no value judgments and must ignore the moral element within 
personality. Or to study the tcial personality they must investigate the 
* value-choosing 1 2 part of human beings and according to present scientific 
standards this they cannot do. 

There is another area of psychology, however, which we must 
recognize in making our estimate of personality. It is the one which 
includes the work of men like Freud, Adler, Allport, and others who are, 
in effect, neither scientists or philosophers in the strict sense but 
who attempt to understand personality by a combination of empirical 
observation and reason. They have contributed some insights which 
ought to be taken into account in any definition of personality. 

First of all they have indicated that personality is not something 
which is given to a human once and forever at birth to remain with him, 
like the color of his eyes, throughout life. Personality is formed and 
changed and developed by the inter-action of some moving and driving forces

within the human being and the forces in the surrounding world which 
play upon a person. This concept is important to keep us from falling 
into the error of thinking of personality as something which belongs to the 
individual alone. It is in part at least, the way in which the person 

responds to the reality and quality of the total world about him. 

1 

Sigmund Freud discovered three levels within personality which, whether 

we accept his philosophical pre-suppositions or not, can be useful to us 

in understanding the elements of human nature. On the bottom level there 

are, he believes, a great number of driving forces or impulses which arise 

from the inner tensions that develop within the human body. These are 

blind impulses which seek only to be expressed in action and in essence 

are animal-like. These impulses he gathers together under the collective 

term *Xd* and in his psychology these irrational drives go to make up by 

far the largest part of the personality. Whether we see it in his terms 

or not we have to recognize this part of man which is the seat of his 

emotions, the part that relates him to the animal world and probably the 

part that leads the religious nan to believe in original sin. Perhaps it 

is not so different from the part of life that Henri Bergson calls the 

1 vital impetus* (or elan vital) which is there after all the physical and 

2 

chemical analyses that can be made have failed to find real life. 

On the second level personal! 1y meets external reality* In so doing 
it has to be governed accordingly and therefore is not able to release all 
the impulses which clamor for expression. The urge to ii^ure another, for 
example, must be repressed at times in the interests of the well-being of 
the person himself. This level is under the control of an organizing prin¬ 
ciple which Freud calls the *ego* and the essential nature of a person seems

to be the result of ho?/ and in what way this ego releases the pressures 
of the drives from within asking for action. If the ego is rigid the pres¬ 
sure may build up until it releases in a burst of expression which could 
be anything from a temper tantrum to a nervous breakdown. If one impulse 
is repressed it may change its form and be released in another way as when 
a boy kicks his dog because he is angry with his father. The principle 
on which the ego operates is that of avoiding pain and seeking pleasure. 

The only reason for which an impulse is repressed is that in so doing 
the future release or different form of release will Being more pleasure* 

We do not and, I think, cannot accept without question his unproven 
assumption that the ego is in effect intelligent selfishness. But the 
important concept of an organising principle without which the personality 
would be like Stephen Leacock* s man who ”jumped on his horse and rode off 
in all directions” is an important element in our understanding of it. It 
would not be right to say that for Freud this ego corresponds to reason as 
it is generally conceived because he was working in a time when the supremacy 
of reason was too widely assumed and his work is partly a reaction against 
it. In fact this ego is almost a tool of desire, that is, it must meet the 
needs of the drives according to the pleasure-pain principle. This, how¬ 
ever in the general concept of humanity is the level on which reason works 
and it is good for us to realize that it is very closely connected with the 
emotional drives. Reason is not the supreme guiding principle of man. We 
must, however, recognize more freedom and power for reason than Freud be¬ 
cause his is a pure and complete psychological determinism. 

The third level is one which Freud did not at first find necessary 
to distinguish from the Ego. It is the level of personal experience which 
we call conscience. ffhereas, the ego is selfish; it is above the pain-

pleasure level of organization because it is guided by social approval. 

It is, as Stagner puts it, ”a drive to do only what is socially approved, 

1 

even in secret where no punishment threatens” The super-ego is therefore 
an element of personality in which the demands of society, which are 
enforced by social pressure, later become part of the individual himself 
and he cannot break the commands of society even in private without 
losing his own peace of mind. Freud has some interesting discussions on 
how this super-ego is conditioned and it will be important for our purposes 
later. Here it is enough to notice that Freud in his stucjrof the mind was 
almost forced to recognize a moral element. Whether society alone is its 
guide we may question but we cannot doubt that it is an important element 
in personality. 

Personality, as we see it, is conditioned by the environment and 
experiences of the world but on the other hand it is common experience that 
individuals develop characteristic ways of reacting to the environment. I’here 
is within the structure of every personality a set of guiding principles which 
determine how the person will usually react to his environment. These prin¬ 
ciples do not change quickly and often determine what things will be done 
end what will not be done, in other words they are the standards by which 
the personality makes its choices between one value and another. We know, 
for instance, that in every situation a certain man will always tell the 
truth while another man will always choose the easy way out of a situation. 
These are guiding principles in their lives and set the standards on which 
they act. Their personalities express the qualities of life which are im¬ 
portant for them and personality is in this sense an expression of character.

Personality, then, for us means: first, that concept of experience 
which we call life itself and which distinguishes living animals from 
inanimate objects* Secondly; that complei of elements which we call reason, 
will and emotion, in their proportion, perspective, and co-ordination as 
they set man apart from his fellow animals and also from his fellow men. 

Thirdly; it is the expression of the determing qualities which we call 
character. It is the peculiar, unique and special influence that a person 
who can choose between one valuable thing or another has upon other living 
beings. 

Our definition of personality does not keep us from saying that 
society has an influence on its subjects which is akin to personality. It 
does not depend on its connection with a particular man. It could therefore 
be a quality in the universe which is more than mechanical or legal and can 
be described only in terms of personality.

MORAL CHOICE 






51 


MORAL CHOICE 

Personality alone makes moral choices. That is to says within the 
full range of our experience we human beings are aware of nothing except 
ourselves, our society and our religion which puts values upon the objects 
and actions of our experience. Life for man is a constant stream of choices. 
On the lowest levels of existence when for instance a man is starving and 
there is only one desire in his life - to find food and preserve life - he 
may choose between gorging himself on it when he finds it or conditioning 
his body slowly to receive it and restore his health without ill effects. 

On a higher level he may choose to forego his food so that another person 
may live because he counts the life of another of more value than his own. 

In our dealing s with our fellow men we constantly make judgments of 
value. At ‘one time we may tell the truth carefully even though it means 
we will be punishedj we value honesty above our personal comfort. At 
another time we may lead someone to a false conclusion rather than lose his 
friendship. We may value both honesty and friendship very highly but at 
the moment we have to choose one above the other so we choose friendship. 

In our living we choose between social standing and wealth, between 

material and spiritual values. There is no such thing as moral neutrality 

1 

as Henry Van Du sen points out so vividly and if we do not choose for our¬ 
selves then the world chooses for us. 

Further it is not one part of a man which is concerned with the 
choice. Moral choices are part of life itself and reason, emotion and 
determination 5 body, mind and spirit! good looks, enlarged tonsils, and bow 
legs are all affected and concerned in each choice. This is not to say that 
we cannot distinguish elements within personality which contribute to the 
final choice between one valuable thing or action and another! it is in-

stead an attempt to prove that if we wish to discover any final truth 
about moral choices we must realize that whole individuals are involved, 

Albrecht Ritschl, the theologian pointed out near the end of the 
nineteenth century that "value-judgments" as he calls them "are determinative 

in the case of all connected knowledge of the world, even when carried out 

1 

in the most objective fashion" He means as most scientists readily admit 
today that even to find purely scientific knowledge, which ideally does 
not depend on any moral judgment, does in fact require the judgment of 
values. Out of the results discovered the research Yrorker must choose 
between the important and the unimportant and according to the kind of truth 
he is after he must choose between what seems to lead toward that truth and 
what does not. Every high school boy knows that you can ! cook 1 your experi¬ 
ment to make it bring the conclusion you desire and eveiy scientist knows 
that by ignoring part of the evidence you may prove a theory which may not 
in fact describe reality. The scientist has to choose between putting forth 
his belief about reality as an unproven hypothesis, or as proven fact. He 
has to choose between lying in bed in the morning and being in his laboratory 
at the precise moment that his results should be recorded. So it is that 
even in scientific research which has to do only with material objects and 
mqy never greatly affect human life one way or another there is a moral 
requirement in which the whole personality is involved. How much more then 
will there be an involvement of the whole being in discovering truth which 
guides daily livingl 

Much of moral philosophy and "ethical science" fails to satisfy simply 
because the philosopher does not take account of his own complete involvement

in the moral problems. Wo one ought to discount the value of human 
reason, to determine the courses of action open to people and give guidance 
in ways and means of achieving right relationships. But on the other hand 
reason which assumes that the reasoner sits apart from himself and his 
fellow men and plots their courses, or reason that assumes itself supreme 
and able to discover all values and having discovered them inspire men to 
act accordingly is bound to fail. It is doomed because as we have seen 
moral choices are not made by reason alone but in the response of a whole 
person to a situation. 

Aristotle 9 s ethics failed because he could not reconcile the rational 

and emotional elements in life. "The good", he declares, "has been rightly 

1 

defined as that at which all things aim# 5 * Consequently the good is simply what 
all men, without exception, desire and good actions are those which help 
men to produce or achieve this 9 good® which he found to be happiness. The 
function of reason is to aid man in getting happiness. The end result of 
his reasoning was to bring Reason* from its position as supreme ruler of 
the person down to the state of being servant of his chief desire* 

The philosopher Kant made an honest attempt to exempt Reason from 
the influence of feeling and to state a principle of ethics which was pro¬ 
duced by pure reason. A principle produced by pure reason, he considered, 

2 

ought to be accepted by all rational minds. The sad evidence is that in 

the first place it isn 9 t likely that anyone will ever discover a principle 

which will be accepted by all rational minds and secondly if they did accept 

it they would not necessarily act accordingly. As Henri Bergson points out 

5 

the requirement of reason is a different thing from the obligation to act.

Because my mind is trained in logic I may be convinced that I should 
tell the truth under all conditions but when I find myself wanting an 
increase in pay from my boss the desire to impress him with my poverty 
may far overwhelm my allegiance to truth. On the other hand if there is 
someone whose moral standards are high and whom I value as a friend 
standing by I will tell the truth even though it may cost me a raise in 
pay, What I am arguing here is that reason qlone will not produce the 
sense of obligation to moral principles and by nature cannot because it 
is an abstraction from the whole person and can only demand the consent 
of a mind trained in reason, A personal influence on the other hand may 
be reasonable but it is more than rational, and produces the adherence 
to a moral principle even when reason would have allowed another choice® 

This problem of describing the relationship between reason and 
emotion is still the stumbling block of moral philosophers, H. A, 

Prichard, fhv example, turns to intuition as the guide of moral choices, 

"The sense of obligation to do, or the rightness of an action of a par- 

1 

ticular kind is absolutely underivative and immediate" That is, just as 
I recognize a car coming toward me and know I must move out of the way, 
so does the sense of obligation come to us when we see the situation con¬ 
sequences and relationships the act will produce. If two obligations 
conflict there will be one which has greater claim than the other and the 
moral consciousness will make the choice. There must, of course, be a 
developed moral sense to appreciate which obligation is greater. 

It is illegitimate he says to want to be convinced by a process 
of reasoning that we perceive the automobile coming. It is also illegitimate

to want to be shown try a process of reason why we are obliged to 

repay a debt. The sense of obligation arises in unreflective moral 

consciousness being an activity of moral thinking occasioned by the 

1 

various situations in which we find ourselves. 

In this sort of thinking there is much support in modern theology

and philosophy. S. J. Urwick in his book ”The Values of Life” counts 

intuition as one of the criteria ty which our values are tested. He 

3 

describes Bergson*s vie?/ of intuition as the faculty above intellect 
and then points out that Plato was not so far from this view. The one 
qualification being that of mental and moral discipline without dick 
moral insights will not come. Prichard also has this pre-requisite for 
moral choice when he admits there must be a developed moral sense. From 
all this we are left to draw the conclusion that to discover morel truth 
you must yourself be morally good, Urwick does in fact draw this con¬ 
clusion ”Pahaps that is why all our revelations of moral values have 

4 

come through oeople whom their world has called saintly” . ”fhis”, he 

5 

says, ”is the only form of intuition which is both defensible and safe” . 
We still find ourselves asking the question *what is the objective reality, 
if any, which produces intuition*, and ho?/ does one acquire the moral 
qualities which aid him in receiving intuition?” These questions we will 
consider later but for the moment let us notice that this kind of thinking- 
leads us very close to the existentialist philosophy and theology cf men 
like Kierkegaard who aim to prove that the onljr experience that matters 
is the immediate experience. Existential thinking is that in which our

whole present being is at stake . While his thinking is conditioned 
ty his theology that man stands always in the overwhelming presence of God 
and that alone matters he would say, I think, of any thought about life 
which attempted to be detached from it that it is wrong. ”The idealist 
philosopher is playing with life and religion; he stands off with the 
detached curiosity of a theatre-goer to whom the issues of the drama on 
the stage ms.tter much less than that he should catch his train”. Ex¬ 
istentialism is a complete swing away from rationalism and while our pur¬ 
pose here is to indicate that personality is deeply involved in moral 
concerns we cannot go to the extreme of this type of thinking which Alan 

Richardson describes as ”one of the current forms of irrationalism which 

2 

the disillusionment of our times has rendered popular. 

Tillich once again has an excellent analysis of the position of 

5 

philosophic thought at the moment. It is closely bound up with the whole 
problem of knowledge and the attempt of philosophy to build its systems 
without first having decided how or what it can know. There are two 
divisions in knowledge he says, which are always present but which vary in- 
proportion according to the object which is observed. The first kind of 
knowledge is that which is discovered by detaching ourselves completely 
from the object to be observed. We transform the object bjr logical descrip¬ 
tions, categories, and scientific observations so that we may use it for 
our own purposes. This is what we do to a piece of iron, for instance, 
when we study its properties and come to know its qualities so that we can 
make it into a useful tool. This he calls Controlling knowledge*.

The other knowledge is that in which we discover in the object 
qualities which are skin to our own, in effect we become united with it. 

In coming to know another man, let us say, we take him into ourselves in 
the sense that in order to know his personal qualities we inevitably compare 
them with our own. We see him not as an. object of reason, science or pure 
speculation, but as someone with a relationship to ourselves and with whom 
we are united by our very kinship or empathy. This he calls ! receiving 
knowledge*. 

If we look deeply into the iron we might find in its inner nature 
elements of order and reason akin to our own and if we study man as a detached 
object as in psychology or sociology we find certain mechanisms which can 
be categorized and described. There is both controlling and receiving know¬ 
ledge possible in both cases. In the case of man, however, we do not learn 
his nature by controlling knowledge because in 1 objectifying* him ?je have 
dehumanized him. 

The prevailing opinion of the world seems to be that controlling 
knowledge alone is knowledge and to study man you must do It as you would 
study iron. Consequently, man becomes what controlling knowledge makes him, 
a dehumanized cog in the works of a great machine, an object of disinterested 
study. It is in reaction to this attitude that the existentialists move 
completely to the other side. They attempt to free man from feing the object 
of controlling knowledge and try to see him as he is, in his place of exis¬ 
tence; a dynamic, creative life in its total relation to all else. The 
result, however, is that they have no criterion by which to judge the know¬ 
ledge so gained, either they have to go back to reason to hst their truths 
or turn to a system of revelation. The real objection to the intuitional!st

philosophers which we ueet was that they give us no basis on which to judge 
which intuition is true and which is false except as seen in the lives 
of people, Urwick concludes, However, that these people sre always religious 
people. 

We must note in passing something that will be important for us later. 
Tillich argues that knowledge is a union of the knower with the object known 
and that Socrates was not stupid when he said that to know what is good is 
to do it. What is really known becomes part of us and we become part of it. 

I think Tillich is a little weak here in not making more of a distinction 
between personal and non-personal objects of knowledge. We may know a great 
deal about the piece of iron and even have discovered within its true nature 
some of the same substance of which w r e ourselves are made but the chief value 
of our knowledge is that we now can control the piece of iron. On the other 
hand when we come to know a person we may have some controlling knowledge of 
him but the part of our knowledge that really matters is the effect he has 
upon our living which may be good or evil according to his nature. If his 
essential nature is of a quality above ours knowledge of him may lift our 
nature toward his and possibly dishearten us. Ts it possible that knowledge 
of the material world gives us power over it and that knovdedge of a person¬ 
ality gives it power over us? 

le have travelled far from the simple question of how moral choices 
are made but it has been for the purpose of proving that if we are going to 
study behavior which requires choices we cannot do it with only part of the 
beings concerned. Moral philosophy is inadequate to give guidance to moral 
people as long as it assumes that the philosopher is detached from his subject. 
The deterrainist always considers himself undetermined, the builder of systems

always considers that he has such wisdom as all men will have to admire. 

If they do produce a standard of reason they divorce it from any supreme 

personality which might give it power and count it their own production 

1 

not a discovery which binds the philosopher himself. Like William Temple 
I am convinced, "theieis no solution to the problems of ethics on the level 
of Ethical Science”. Perhaps I am prejudiced by the fact that the night 
before our Christmas exam someone from the class on ethics removed my 
carefully prepared summaries from my notes leaving me without means of 
further preparation. Apart from ail prejudic^however, I believe as does 
E. J. Urwick that the evidence points to the fact that moral advances do 
not come from the speculation of philosophers hut from the example of great 
personalities who express great qualities of life to which other men respond 
in one way or another, further that their personalities were guided by a 
knowledge of the 1 2 value creator 1 of the universe whom they discovered through 
revelation. 

We shall use the term personality as the unit of moral choice and 
action for the purpose of keeping us from swinging either to the rationalist 
or the existentialist position of thought. Personality unites within it all 
the knowing, reasoning, and motivating elements of human nature. Personality 
as we shall use it is the concept of the complete human unit as it responds 
to the total of reality as well as to the personal forces within the area of 
its experience.

PERSONAL RESPONSE 







40 


PER SONAL R E SPONSE 

We are born into a world of persons. Our first conscious dis¬ 
coveries are of people unless, of course, we were nursed in an incubator 
and raised in a laboratory. In early experiences with people the founda¬ 
tions of a moral sense or consciousness of right and wrong are laid. Whether 
there is a moral instihct which develops or whether the sense of right and 
wrong grows and is conditioned purely by experience with the environment 
is a problem for further investigation but it is a self-evident proposition 
that it appears and develops in the presence of other personalities. 

My contention is that it is only in response to personal influences 
that a moral sense is developed and moral action evoked. The earliest 
personalities we meet are our parents and those who nurse us through child¬ 
hood. Psychologists almost without exception agree in the conclusion that 
there are patterns of behavior developed in the first few years of life 
which remain more or less influential throughout life. borne go to the 
extreme of tracing every element of personality back to the heredity, 
surroundings and training of the infant. Just as some thinkers earlier 
considered that you can explain man by tracing his origins to the lower 
animals ana that you can explain religion by finding its origins in animism 
so these thinkers set forth theories of personality which imply that you can 

1 

explain a personality by tracing its elements back to their source in infancy. 
Such an implication is, of course, as false as the suggestion that you can 
describe an oak tree by tracing its roots, trunk, branches and leaves back 
to their embryo form within the acorn. The oak tree is not what it was in 
the acorn, it has undergone a multitude of developments and been effected 
by countless new influences even though you can trace some of its character¬ 
istic qualities from the seed to the full grown tree. The point we are making

here, however, is that the first and most powerful influences a child 
meets are the personalities of his parents and the earliest and most 
lasting behavior patterns are shaped in childhood in response to these 
personalities• 

Among the patterns of bahavior which begin to establish in 
childhood there is the attitude toward right and wrong. The earliest 
responses are governed partly by the discovery that some things are 
approved and some things are disapproved. This is to says that even 
a small child soon comes to know that some actions bring favourable re¬ 
sponses from his closest associates while others not only pain his parents 
bit may result in pain for himself. As time goes by the child comes to 
value, more or less, those things which his parents value and to reject 
what his parents reject. The fact that he soon meets many other personal 
influences besides the parents, and the fact that there are definite limits 
to the child®s ability to appreciate values makes the acceptance of his 
parents* standards only partial. The argument again is that while this 
personal influence does not explain all the value-judgments of a child 
there is a strong case for it being the chief factor in producing the first 
moral behavior. 

Children are guided by what their parents are as well as by what 
they say. It is in these first relationships that the first unselfish choices 
are made and the first altruistic deeds are done because they bring not only 
approval but apparent pleasure to the greatest influence in their lives, y 
parents. A child may give up toys for his little sister not because it brings 
him great pleasure but because in discovering the nature of his parents he 
knows it is according to their approval. We must not overlook the common 

human experience that profound satisfaction comes from harmonious relations

with other persons. Harmonious relations come, as we have seen, only 
to those who can share the approval of one another. Those who are in sub¬ 
stantial agreement concerning the importance of the objects and activities 
of life can have harmonious relationships from which the most satisfying 
experiences come. This resulting satisfaction must be counted as one of the 
strong motives in bringing one person to adjust his moral standards to 
agree with those of another and one cause of the resulting moral behavior. 

In the case of child adjusting to parent or citizen adjusting to society 
or worshipper responding to God the subjective satisfaction of an harmonious 
personal relationship must be counted to be one of the strong motives for 
making the adjustment. 

These standards of value which are discovered in personalities 
themselves whether it be in individual persons, in society, or in the 
nature of the universe is, we submit, the only sound source ethical behavior. 
The weakness of any ethical standard which is not seen in and against the 
background of a real personality whether parent, society, or God is an 
obvious experience of life for those who will see it. The parent who teaches 
his boy to honesty and then boasts to his friends how he heat the income tax 
authorities is most often disheartened to find his boy cheating in his games. 
A society that teaches purity of relationships and then advertises every 
form of vice and indecency through its press, theatres, and radios should 
not he surprised when it finds the morals of the people slipping. A church 
which preaches mercy, love, and truth and yet keeps its worship bound up 

in soul-less form and ritual ought not be too surprised when it finds that 
its ideals do not greatly influence the people who follow its teaching.

It may be well argued that a moral ideal in itself has power to 

challenge and influence persons for the better. The answer is that the 

power of an ideal comes not from the personality in which it is embodied 

but from the personality in which an individual believes the ideal to 

be embodied. If the analysis of some social psychologists is right 

social standards are upheld by the fact that most of the people in that 

1 

society live according to those moral principles. The power of a social 
ideal, then, comes not necessarily from the objective fact that society 
lives according to that ideal hut it may come from subjective belief in 
the mind of individual persons that most people in society do hold to 
that standard and live accordingly. Henri Bergson has an interesting 
observation, that the social obligation which society imposes on indivi¬ 
duals comes from the ability of the community to maintain the illusion 

that most people, no matter how we judge them, are in essence better 
2 

than we are. 

Our conclusion is that it is the embodiment of an ideal in 
personality whether it be an objective fact or a subjective faith that 
produces moral behaviour. The qualities found in personalities which 
are objective facts are however the only secure root of moral response 
because sooner or later beliefs which are subjective only will probably 
bring disillusion and possibly rebellion. 

Some of the personal forces that are seen in the home appear also 
in society because there is no society existing which does not have certain 
basic values which must be accepted by most of its members. Our society, 
for instance, could not exist if the value of human life were not respected 
by most members of it. Our society will not continue to exist as it is 
unless a goodly proportion of the people within it come to agree upon the

relative importance of material progress and social welfare or upon the 
relative value of warfare and arbitration in dealing with our enemies. 

The effective laws of a society are not most firmly upheld by the laws 
which forbid stealing, killing, and adultery. They are upheld by the 
social agreement among persons which values personal rights to property 
above the philosophy that 1 might is righB and values home life above the 
pleasures of promiscuity. 

Social pressures do more to lift or repress moral action than 
any governing or policing force wiich does not enjoy the support of the 
people. In effect these pressures are the expression of a social per¬ 
sonality because each society develops a characteristic set of standards 
and usually a peculiar method of applying social pressure and thereby is 
entitled to be described in terms of personality according to the way in 
?vhich we are using the word. Let us not overlook, however, the necessity 
of power lying behind the judgments of a personality. It is without a doubt 
one of the underlying factors in all moral response that for flagrant viola¬ 
tions of standards there may be punishment. But to suggest as some do that 
all morality is motivated by the fear of punishment and the hope of reward 
only describes a small part of the evidence. The power of a personal 

influence is probably seen more cl earl v in society than in any other Diace, 

1 

There is no social group that does not have some values which it insisti - 
its members must also hold or be expelled. Let us say, for example, that 
a group within society values the personal quality of friendliness very 
highly. If someone enters that group who is unfriendly the response to 
him will probably be a ! cold shoulder 1 and he wall find himself an outsider 
in search of some other companionship. On the other side if society

accepts social drinking as practice any one who values his freedom 
from it more than the fellowship of the group may also find himself 
rejected. Because a man cannot live apart from society, his personal 
values are inevitably deeply affected by social pressure. 

The real problem of ethics, however, comes when we attempt 
to discover values which exist apart from society which can be accepted 
as standards not only for the individual man but for a whole society. 

The argument that society sets the standards by which men ought to live 
and that we can be governed by the social situation in which we happen 
to be does not any longer hold water. A study of different societies 
at different levels of development indicates there are certain funda- 

r 

mental values or ’decencies* such as respect for human life, truth, 
property and sex regulations without which no society exists or can 
exist. This seems to indicate that there are fundamental values in the 
make up of the world and the universe which cannot be ignored. Such a 
statement becomes very impressive when we examine the world situation 
in which we are living. When one great society, which claims to value 
human life and freedom above the will of the state, exists side by side 
with society which values the welfare of the state above individual human 
lives there has to be some adjustment made. If I live beside a man who 
values my money more than he values my life, and I in turn value my money 
more than I value his life then there will probably be a quarrel in which 
one of us is killed or completely subdued. The only other alternative is 
that we adjust our values until we can both agree that our lives are worth 
more than the money. There is much of our international situation which is 
not ill described in this analogy and will either produce war or require 
that the nations and social groups concerned come to some compromise or

some agreement in which we are agreed which values are most important. 

By our own human standards according to the evidence of history 
values will probably never agree but if there are some universal and 
essential standards according to which all societies must be governed 
to exist our hope is in changing the moral judgments of both sides accor¬ 
dingly. In a situation such as our world faces today, we have no alter¬ 
native but to begin looking for universal values on which we can build 
harmonious relationships with others who do not share our values at the 
moment• 

To those who sqgue there can be no supreme values we can only 
reply that if there are none then life has no meaning. If it is true 
as lax Otto thought in 1928 that 1 Every thinking youth is accustomed 
to the view that the physical world of which he is an integral part 
is a vast machine which moves according to mechanical principles having 
no reference to human wishes or worths,’ then we may expect the result 
which he describes f, Faith in human initiative is weakened; morel dis¬ 
tinctions appear of doubtful validity; idealism becomes apologetic and 

1 

men simply do not feel as responsible as formerly”. If it is true that 
buildings, mountains and trees must abey the laws of nature to exist 
but there are no laws of life which matter to man and it doesn* t make 
any difference what values mankind as a whole accepts then we are put 
in the strange position of saying that only the things which are rela¬ 
tively unimportant to us exist and the values which mean life or death 
do not exist. W. E. Hocking, in speaking of the reality of scientific 
and intuitive knowledge points out that there has been a rvolt in thinking

lately against the idea that the abstraction of science and reason 

alone are real, led by men like Dewey and Whitehead. The revolt is 

in essence the protest of observation against the findings of * abstract 

thought 1 2 3 . The revolt, however, is also a moral one, as we have pointed 

out. ”The real is unimportant; the important is unreal. This, we say, 

1 

cannot be true.” 

Kant looked for a universal criterion for moral judgment 

but when he found it he discovered it had no power, not because it wouldn f t 

lift the level of morality but because it was not a value found in the 

nature of the world but one postulated ty the human reason alone. As John 

BaiHSb puts it ”He taught ....... that the guidance is originally revealed 

to us in he form of a self-evidencing law - a mere obligation detached, 

2 

as it were, from Him who lays the obligation upon us” 9 

If there are values in the universe there is only one way in 

which we can describe the sustainer of the values and that is in the terms 

of personality. We know nothing else which chooses between good and evil 

and we know nothing higher than personal forces. There is no scientific 

evidence to say that thexecannot be personal forces even in the inner 

nature of a piece of iron. Row much less is the evidence that there cannot 

be personal forces in and above society. The social philosopher recognizes 

”that in past times it is belief, not in society but in the supernatural 

3 

which has done the useful social work” E. J. Urwich as we have seen, comes 
to conclude that it is in great personalities which we call saints that 
the new moral qualities and insights enter society. Further, he concludes

that, M A11 great seers are religious and are our guides in the roads 
1 

to religion”. John MacDonald comes out in defence of the fundamental 

decencies of living 1 ; moral standards which exist in all societies end 

whose value cannot be questioned. ”These are the fundamental decencies 

of living and the essential fact about them is that they do not admit 
2 

of argu ment. " (underlining replaces the italics). 

Paul Tillich as we have seen argues very convincingly that 
reason itself has a problem it cannot solve. Reason recognizes that 
after all its analysis and organization of the experience which man has 
of real things there is a total reality which reason knows is there and 
yet cannot comprehend according to its own standards. Reason itself asks 
for some revelation of f reality in itself 1 . Reason wants to know the 
relationship between the knowledge through which man can comprehend the 
world and * depth of reason 1 which man knows to be there. 

We conclude from this discussion that the truest real revelation 
of values comes to us in and through personalities; that the source of 
moral action is personalities in whom we recognize great qualities and 
in whose presence we must either adjust our values and actions accordingly 
or retreat from their presence; that there are fundamental and universal 
values which exist in the Universe and which we can describe only in terms 
of personality; that a world in which there is both law and freedom from 
law can only be explained in terms of organism and personality. Therefore, 
we hold that there are obj ective values to be found in the nature of tie 
universe.

THE LEAP OF FAITH 












49 


TH E T.KAP OF FAIT# 

So far we have come the way of the philosopher and the 
temptation is to say that since by reason alone we cannot discover 
the nature of reality then we ought to take a. leap of faith and accept 
the revelations of religion. Christianity believes in a personal God 
who is supremely revealed in the personality of Jesus Christ. To know 
Him is to love him and to love him is to serve Him, therefore, let us 
come to know Jesus Christ. 

Actually, however, to understand revelation we must approach 

it from another direction. The history of religion does not bear out 

the many philosophers who maintain that, as men discovered valuable 

moral insights, they invested them with religious significance to make 

them carry weight. A statement such as W. E. Hocking made in 1929 that 

"For many centuries religion was ihe chief repository of the ripening self 

1 

knowledge and self discipline of the human mind...." Or Bergson saying 

that “Originally the whole of morality is custom* and as religion forbids 

2 

any departure from custom, morality is co-extensive with religion", do 
not do justice to the evidence. The only reason Socrates can ask the ques¬ 
tions is a thing holy because it is loved by the gods, or is it loved 
by the gods because it is holy? Is that the gods which Socrates knew 
were created in the image of men. D. B. MacDonald in his book "The 
Hebrew Philosophical Genius"points out that in order to use Zeus as a 

name for the ultimate being, Plato had to ignore his personality be- 

5 

cause of its unsavory qualities. 

With the HebreY*s, however, it is quite otherwise. They never 
made the mistake to the same degrees of confusing God with men

and it was in tie discovery of the personality of the *Albsolute* that 
the genius of all their religion lay. The concept of the *glory 1 2 of 
God, for example, when traced to its roots brings us to the conclusion 
that in their minds it is the very nature of God which gives him his 
authority. The root(713) which produces the word 7 1 D3that is trans¬ 
lated *glory* in the old Testament has a basis meaning *to be heavy* or 
1 

to carry weight, When apolied. to a person it came to mean the honor of 
2 

a personality or the esteem and respect Ydiich a person evokes from those 

who meet him. When applied to God it is the expression for a supreme 

personality which is resplendent and awe-inspiring. Because of its nature 

it causes man to esteem it above all else and because of its great moral 

power makes a man in its presence feel the supreme authority of it and 

his own duty to obey. We speak of a man who carries weight because of the 

respect he inspires in men. We speak of a personality which is forceful 

and its force may be for good or evil. The Greek could find no compelling 

respect for his gods because they were often less virtuous than men but 

when the Hebrew found a new moral insight it came from his discovery of 
5 

the nature of God, 

It is in the idea of holiness, however, that we can best trace the 

essential nature of religion as a source of moral response. This, of course, 

would be-another thesis but we ought to trace the roots of Christian 

morality back to the developing sense of hliness which appears in the 

Old Testament, The root meaning of the word translated *holy* IjJTpis 

not certain beyond a doubt but one thing is true, that it was always used 

4 

in relation to the divine powers of the universe. It meant, not so much

the quality of the nature of Yahweh in the Old Testament as the require- 

1 

ment God places upon those who approach him. It has some awe-inspiring 

and some terror-producing qualities such as a man would feel if he could 

w meet his maker face to face®. But more than that it produces in the 

one who comes near anything which is holy or the tt Holy® itself a sense 

that Something is required 1 . 

2 

Rudolph Otto has forcefully argued that the unique nature of 
the religious feeling was more than a feeling of moral short-comings. 

It was, and is, the feeling of coming near some being which is overwhelming 
and terror-producing but at the same time is attractive and draws man toward 
it. If we may follow Robert F. Davidson 1 s discussion of Otto 1 3 s interpreta¬ 
tion of the ’holy 9 then 0tto has overstated this side of religion end over 

5 

looked the reason-producing and moral producing nature of the experience. 
However, that may be, we must not make the mistake of thinking that the 
experience of holiness is or was purely moral. Just as value judgments 
are only part of the resul t of our experience of personalities among men 
so the concept of the holy inspired much more in men than the desire to 
live morally. 

The truth was that the requirements for entering into God’s pre¬ 
sence in the Old Testament were often the requirements of ritual which made 
no great moral difference to the worshipper. The development of religion 
came, however, when the prophets discovered that in their experience of 
God’s presence there were moral requirements necessary. Amos preached 
a religion that was almost purely moral but he did it with the conviction

that God was speaking* The classical example of an encounter with 
holiness as Isaiah in the temple* From his vision of God there 
develops in him a deep sense of his own 8 uncleanness 9 as he calls it 
and his peopled impuritfes. From the deep sense of shame he is 
relieved by the cleansing power that comes in the form of a live coal 
from the altar? Then when the call comes 8 whom shall I send? 8 he replies 
•here am I send me 9 and Isaiah went out to become himself an expression 
of the moral qualities of Yahweh. His preaching is a re-shifting of 
the values of the people* God cares about the vddows more than he cares 
about burnt offerings, God despises the injustice of the rulers and 
cares nothing for their offerings when they show no mercy on the orphan 
and the outcast* 

"Put away your evil doings from before my eyes. 

Cease to do evil, learn to do good" 1 

"The discovery we owe to the prophets of Israel is that the supreme worth 

2 

of life is in its morality? Their discovery was that as man lives in 
the presence of God he cannot but feel his own need to change until his 
values are God 3 & values until he loves what God loves and hates what God 
hates* Again we see values revealed in a personality who has been touched 
by another personal force bat again we point out that the moral response 
is not religion bat part of the result of coming into contact with the 
divine* 

All religions, as we know, have not produced high morality but 
all religious have produced ethical teachings of one kind or another and 
always have upheld the basic morality of life* It is interesting that 
Confucius whose ideal in life was not to see God bat to produce an ideal 
man nevertheless found it necessary to postulate that the ways he taught

were supported by the nature of the world. It is also easy for a 
religion to lose its sense of holiness and the personality of God 
by describing its values in endless lawjS- and separating what they call 
the will of God from the nature of God. The true revelation of God is 
never through a law book it is through a personality. 

It is this sense of the holy which our world has lost. 
’’Nothing”, we say, ”is sacred”. There are no values which exist above 
our desires, there is nothing personal about the universe. There are 
those who can stand beside Niagara Falls and boast about the power of 
the muscles in their arms. There are those who can look up into the 
heavens at the stars and proudly explain how they won their last checker 
game. There are those who watch the miracle of birth and marvel more 
at the ability of men to produce new cars. 

John Calvin, 'whose theology produced rigid morals, neverthe¬ 
less was working against the arrogance of man when he said ”so long as 
we do not look beyond the earth, we are quite pleased with our own 
righteousness, wisdom and virtue .... but should we begin to raise our 
thoughts to God and reflect what kind of being he is..... what formerly 

delighted us by its false show of righteousness will become polluted 

1 

with the greatest iniquity.....? Just as truth is a moral requirement 
for finding scientific truth, there is a greater moral requirement for 
finding moral truth; that we be willing to accept the highest insights 
of men in their experience of God and be willing to learn the nature 
of the God they discover.

The young folks can make the dance go freer if the programme 

committee manages to keep the chaperones in the side room. The world 

has no values if we keep any religious feelings carefully detached from 

life. No one knows the ability of a respected and loved personality 

to raise the level of a social gathering and we have yet to discover 

the ability of a true religion to re-distribute the values of humanity. 

The move of some modern theology is to once again bring men 

to the presence of God. Kierkegaard*s thinking revolves around the 

setting in which man stands in the presence of God "guilty. Hind, and 

1 

awaiting His judgment and mercy" There is no greater sin than thinking 
with no feelings about God and eternity and there is nothing more un¬ 
pardonable than the tepid objectiveness of churchman ship which lives 
at peace with the world. "We are set, each of us, in the inescapable 

presence of God; and to live and think as if this were not so, is in 

2 

fact not to think or live at all". 

Barth is not far away in this respect for to him God reveals 

himself as and where he will, and to understand him *man must listen 

5 

with the consciousness of standing at the bar of God*. The essential 
position of man is that of a convict standing before the judge waiting 
to hear his sentence passed. The grounds on which the judge will pass 
his sentence is the revelation of God wrhich he finds in the New Testament. 
It is this revelation which is the judge and the accuser as well as the 
reformer. Man himself owes nothing but to listen. 

This kind of thinking, justified as it may be as an attempt to 
counteract the arrogant rationalism of the time, is not able to satisfy

even the Christian revelation which it claims to interpret because 
it over-states the case. As Paul Tillich points out very forcibly; 
theology which ignores reason is either foolish or painfully ignorant 
of the purpose of reason. 

Our conclusion is that we must see revelation through the 
personalities who have discovered and do reveal God. We must look 
for what it is that they have discovered and what has been revealed 
to them that raises their personal qualities and insights above those 
of their fellow men. What we are in search of is not human personalities 
but the qualities which are added to human personalities when they come 
into contact with God, To this must be added our own experience and the 
quality of the willingness to piece together the experiences of other 
men with our own until we have come closer to the great reality. For 
those who wall not go beyond the limits of reason and cannot see any 
values above their own there is only one thing that will convince them 
and that is to confront them with a personality in which knowledge of 
God has produced new values. 

To bludgeon men with claims of their own miserable weakness can 
mean nothing unless they see at the same time the greatness of God and 
discover their own miserable conditions as Isaiah did in the temple. 

Our leap of faith then is no jump into darkness nor is it 
throwing ourselves into the hands of an authoritarian church as the 
Roman Catholics do. It is not on the other hand throwing ourselves 
upon the authority of an inspired scripture as the extreme fundamental¬ 
ists do and then wonder why they find not one but many supreme personal¬ 
ities. We approach all the revelations of men with the confidence that

CHRISTIAN MORALITY 





57 


CHRIS TIAN MORALITY 

The most significant theme in the teaching of Jesus for those 
interested in ethics, is Jesus* evaluation of human life and all its 
relationships. Whether His teachings are designed to carry His followers 
through and prepare them for judgment which is coming soon and therefore 
may be called * interim ethics*; or whether they are teachings for men and 
societies which expect to go on existing until the ends of their times, is 
not the essential question concerning his ethics. Whether they are ethics 
designed for an emergency or for normal living the relative values which 
Jesus puts upon life and its relation to other men, to the world and to 
God still remain as the guiding and deciding principles of Christian 
morality. 

Any quick reading of the synoptic gospels will serve to prove 
that Jesus did not nor, apparently, did he intend to cover all the 
situations of life. There are many areas of life such as the field 
of politics and business which Jesus only briefly mentions. Even if he 
had described complete ethical behaviour in those areas it would have 
been for a type of government and commerce which is a far-cry from ours. 
Except for the collection of teachings in Matthew* s * Sermon on the Mount* 
teaching takes up a relatively mall proportion of the gospel story. To 
describe Jesus as 9 a great ethical teacher* is far from justified because, 
as a matter of fact, our evidence propounds no theory of morals nor does 
it attempt to describe any definite code of action. His teaching comes 
to us as incidental to his living. His answers are are given as replies to 
the situations and problems which he meets in the course of his ministry.

In the words of Jesus we have recorded in the synoptic gospels, 
well over half of them are sayings in which Jesus re-evaluates the ideas 
and standards of the people he meets. The Pharisees object to him taking 
grain from the field and healing a sich man on the Sabbath. He replies, 
in effect, that health and welfare are of more value than the keeping of 
a tradition. To sustain life and produce health is more acceptable to 
God than refraining from labor even on his sacred day according to the 
teaching of Jesus. One of the basis principles of the teaching in the 
Sermon on the Mount is that the inward spirit of right relations with God 
is of more value than earthly possessions. "Seek first the kingdom and 
His righteousness and all these things shall be yours as well.” (Matt. 

7:35; RSV) 

In matters of religious duties there comes no more forceful 
expression from Jesus than against those who have their values twisted 
and cleanse ! the outside of the cup 1 while leaving the inside impure. 

He values the honoring of parents above the payment of tithes to the 
temple (Mk, 7:11) and he values the words and deeds which come from a 
man* s heart far above his carefulness not to eat unclean food. He values 
the mite of the widow above the great gift of the rich man, the servant 
above the lord, the good spirit above the keeping of any particular law. 
Life is something that is worth more than the whole world. "What does it 
profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life” (Mk. 8:36 R.S.V.) 

The Kingdom of Heaven, whatever it is, is like a pearl or a 
treasure for which a man will sell everything else he has in order to 
obtain it. (Matt. 15:45) When the more valuable is discovered then the 
less valuable must go. There were other elements in the teaching of Jesus 
which we will presently discuss but for the moment we pause to ask the

questions: f 0n what basis did Jesus judge values; by whose standards? 

What is the motive for acting according to the values chosen?* 

The arguments that humanity chooses its moral standards and 
then invests them with religious significance falls when confronted 
with the moral standard of the Christian religion which is Jesus Christ. 

The values of Jesus are not the values of men even in their highest 
concepts and deepest insights. You may prove that the noblest insights 
of man have taught them to value human welfare above material prosperity. 

It may be possible to prove that the highest human thoughts have brought 
men to value mercy, love and truth above a person* s own comfort. But 
you cannot find a man in the world * s history who had convinced himself 
that these values which he held were more important than himself and 
was willing to die a miserable death for them. The only men who have 
died for their teachings are men who believed that theirs were the 
values of God. If men made the Christian God they should have chosen 
a man who did less suffering for his faith to be the revelation of God. 

The morality of Jesus came from his own personal relationships with God, 
When he counts the sinner’s welfare above the needs of the ’righteous* 
it is because God values it so. When he forgives the adulterous woman 
rather than exact the penalty which society would impose it is because 
God values her redemption more than her condemnation. When he dies without 
a struggle it is because, in the nature of God the ways of peace and love 
come so far ahead of the ways of force and strife that even to save his 
life he cannot choose the violent way® He valued his personal life less 
than that God’s will may be done. His basis of judgment was the will of 
God and his standards were the standards of God.

The motive power of Christian morality is the response t) 
personality. As we have seen the teachings of Jesus are part of 
his life and very often, if you want to know what Jesus meant by 
what he said you look at what he did. The moral qualities of Jesus 
Christ are part of his nature and, as we have concluded, finding such 
qualities in the consititution of a personality is the supreme inspira¬ 
tion for virtuous living. The inspiring power of Jesus goes deeper than 
himself. As we have also seen the moving force in his life was his 
relationship with and his knowledge of God. It is when men come to 
believe that the supreme quality which shines through the personality 
of Jesus is revelation of the nature of God and that tie values upheld 
and loved by Jesus are the qualities found in the inner nature of the 
universe that religion moves men to action. It is when men believe in 
Jesus as the revelation of God in a personality that they make their 
greatest attempt to adjust their values to be a harmony with the nature 
of God. Knowing the nature of the material world with its laws and 
forces enables us to adjust ourselves, to co-operate with and to control 
parts of the material environment. Knowing the nature of the personal 
power in reality brings us into union with it and while it demands our 
co-operation and makes us captive, it also frees us from the impersonal 
and binding forces of the world. 

The God whom Jesus reveals is a supremely personal being which 
is revealed in and through a master human personality. There are two 
main concepts through which man with his finite mind can conceive of God. 
The uniquely Christian concept is that God is the Father of men, benevolent, 
forgiving, redeeming, expecting, and indeed demanding some responses from

men. The other concepts comes by way of the Hebrew idea of God that 

1 

He is also sovereign and ruler of the world. He maizes the laws and 

settles accounts with men yet he shows mercy even to those who have 

not deserved it. He is never unjust. God, then, is a powerful and 

exacting force yet one who meets men person to person and who suffers 

as a father for his children and who redeems the wicked through the 

suffering of the just, 
is 

This not a God who can best be approached through the keeping 
of his laws. Rather the keeping of laws mechanically may stand between 
man and God. The widows mite could never be considered of more worth 
than the rich man 1 s gifts in the eyes of a lawmaker unless it was be¬ 
cause She exceeded the amount prescribed for people in her category 
to give. The value which Jesus placed upon her gift is that it was 
done by the spirit which she felt and not because she lived up to or 
surpassed any standards of the law. The woman taken in adultery could 
not be forgiven by any God who expresses himself in unbending laws. She 
had violated a law and the prescribed penalty was death. She was for¬ 
given out of the personal concern of God for her welfare and not because 
she was quitted, God, according to the Christian concept, is more con¬ 
cerned whith the welfare of every individual than he is to enforce the 
penalties of any law. He deals with men according to the spirit in which 
they approach him and not according to the number of laws they have kept 
or violated. 

The Hebrew law had grown from the religious experience of the 
prophets and was, in effect, the expression of the commandments which 
their experience led them to believe God would make. The law in the

n 7Ie cannot do justice to the teaching of Jesus on God’s nature if 
we separate these t?/o conceptions, either His sovereignity or His 
Fatherhood,.,,,,, the former eternal in the heavens the latter 
realised on earth in time.”

beginning had been the expression of the nature of God in human terms. 

It later became detached from the personality of God and unquestioning 
obedience to the law took the place of personal response to a personal 
God, In the hands of the lawyer law became unbending and inflexible 
and by the time of Jesus it was keeping men from knowing God as a 
personality or, at best, his personality was that of an exacting 
legislator. It was against those who made obedience to the law the 
supreme expression of religion that the harshest condemnation of Jesus 
came, ”Woe to you lawyers 1 For you have taken away the key of know¬ 
ledge; you did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were 
entering,” (Lk, 11152), We shall not look for an understanding of 
Christian morality then in any system of precepts or commands which 
take the expression of unbending laws of God for every activity. 

Nor is He a God of supreme will whose every request must be 
obeyed and who smites the wicked and disobedient and rewards those who 
obey his demands. Those who interpret the Christian motive to good action 
as the fear of punishment or the hope of reward have not read their gos¬ 
pels very carefully. It is true that there are elements of teaching 
which suggest that if certain principles of action are not followed then 
punishment will come. In Luke 15:3 for example, Jesus has just said that 
the Galileans whom Folate had killed were no worse sinners than the rest 
of the Galileans and then he turns to the people saying, n unless you 
repent you will all likewise perish,” There are also teachings which 
definitely offer rewards, ’’There is no one who has left house or 
brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my 
sake and for the gospel, who will not receive a hundredfold now in this 
time (lk, 10;29) Taken, however, in relation to all the rest

of the gospel these teachings are not a prominent theme. Certainly 
there is judgment in Jesus* thinking. All men will be called to give 
account of their stewardship and, after all, what meaning is there in 
life if there is no scale on which life is weighed besides the judgment 
of men and no standard of values by which life is measured except that 
which careless societies often produce? No being can have any authority 
unless there is some power behind his judgments and unless there is 
punishment for those who persistently oppose him and reward for those 
who loyally obey him. Therefore, it is no discredit to the motive power 
in Christian ethics that there lies underneath its concepts the belief 
that God is supremely powerful. 

There is much more to be said, however, for the idea that in the 

thinking of Jesus the kingdom of God is the equivalent of true religion 

and that it is in entering into the kingdom that true relations with God 

come, "It is scarcely an exaggeration to say, in the light of the parables 

and the beatitudes that his use of the ! kingdom* signifies the realization 
1 

of true religion," True religion, which in Christian teaching is the 
discovery of the father-son relationship between man and God, is there¬ 
for the highest possession of man. It is the f, pearl of great price" 
for which a man will forsake all else, (Matt, 1-3 1 45) John the Baptist 
came preaching judgment and repsntence. Jesus taught that "among those 
born of woman there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist; yet 
he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he." (Matt, 11:11) 
Jesus does not decry the harsh warnings of John that judgment is coming 
but he suggests that the man in whose heart God rules is greater than the

man who changes his way from fear of judgment. 

There is no bargaining in Jesus 1 thought. The men who are hired 
to labor in God*s vineyard (Matt. 21:1-16) receive the reward of the 
master bat they receive what the master gives and not an extra payment 
for every extra hour and no time and a half for overtime. Jesus offers 
no great rewards in heaven. In fact, he refuses to speculate about it. 

To sit on his right hand or on his left In heaven is not his to give 
(Mk. 10:40) and the nearest he comes to the suggestion of reward is that 
the fellowship with Sod will be increased. "Well done, good and faith¬ 
ful servant, enter into the joy of your master." (Matt. 25:21) "Inasmuch 
as y e have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have 
done it unto me." (Matt. 25:40) The reward of Christian action is that, 
by it, fellowship with God is increased and ultimately will be made com¬ 
plete. 

The ultimate proof that Jesus himself was motivated by no sense 
of reward and no fear of punishment is to be found as he faces the cross, 
"My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me$ nevertheless 
not as I will, but as thou wilt." (Matt, 26:39) There is no suggestion 
that punishment follows if he does not obey for, humanly speaking, there 
could be no greater punishment come than that which follows if he obeys. 
There is no sense of reward, except perhaps, that his Father* s trust will 
not be betrayed. His obedience is not forced upon him any outward force 
it is an inner loyalty to God. This is an inner loyalty and personal 
fellowship which he cannot and does not betray even in the face of death. 

There is a persistent theme in the teachings of Jesus that the 
religion of all men should be in an inward experience which results in

outward acts of righteousness. Purity of relations with the opposite 
sex begins with inward thoughts. Freedom from the urge to kill begins 
with the heart. Honesty has its roots in a mind which is free from 
covetousness. His conflict with the Pharisees is that they "Cleanse the 
outside of the cup” while the inside is full of extortion and rapacity. 
(Matt. 25:26) "The good man out of the good teasure of his heart produces 
good, and the evil man out of his evil treasure produce evil.” (Luke 16:54) 
His own personal life is one of constant returning to the source of his 
guidance and power. Time after time he prays and then goes out to act. 

When he teaches his disciples to pray the first petition is, "Hallowed 
be Thy name," and the second is, "Thy kingdom come on earth as it is in 
heaven," 

The name of God was the nature of God for the Hebrews and to 
hallow it was to approach it with reverence, humility and awe. To pray, 

"Thy will be done," is not say ! may thy commands be carried out* but *May 
they nature be known in the ways of men.* God 1 s will is not part of His 

personality but is rather the moral demand which men feel in his presence. 

In God*s presence the values of man must be adjusted and his actions must 

be governed accordingly if he is to live in harmony with God. To hold his 

nature in respect comes first, to obey his will comes second because 
obedience is a person responding to the Supreme Personality. 

When Jesus was asked to name the greatest of the commandments 
he did something which a lawyer could never do; he chose two from all the 
many religious precepts of the time. First he named the old Hebrew exhorta¬ 
tion: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all 
your soul and with all your mind and with all your streigth." as the greatest

of all commandments. Then he named, "You shall love your neighbor 
as yourself," as the second commandment. In these two commandments 
he summarized the whole spirit of the law and of his moral teaching. 
Again we notice that the beginning of the Christian life is an appre¬ 
ciation of God and the second step is a response which is expressed 
in the relationships of a man to his neighbor. 

Love is never a simple emotion and we cannot here examine 
its full importance as it is used in Christian moral teaching. Let 
us notice, however, that it is neither simply emotional or is it 
simply intellectual. Love includes the response of body, mind, and 
spirit and is an activity of the whole man. According to our use of 
the term it is a function of the personality. We must also notice, 

in p as sing, that to the ^ebrew command to love God vd_th heart and 
2 

soul and strength Jesus added the word mind. Therefore, let no man 
say th^t Christian morality requires no use of the reasoning powers 
of man. 

The next important thing to notice is that there is a command 
* thou shalt 1 2 which is not necessary if love is automatic and natural.. 
Christian love requires an effort on the part of man. It is common 
experience that a good personality does not always bring the response 
of love and devotion. The response of the Pharisees to Jesus wqs at 
first a fdthdrawal and later an expression of aggression and hatred. 

Any response to the Christian revelation of God comes because man recog¬ 
nizes qualities and values in the creator which are far above his own. 
The response may be one of absolute withdrawal rather than the re¬ 
shifting of values necessary and may result in absolute agression and

hatred for religion. On the other side it may be a response which 

recognizes the nature of God and that in the father-son relationship 

of the Christian religion the response required is that faithfulness 

and growth not absolute, unflinching obedience. "One who resoonds 

1 

is responsive; when he responds faithfully, he is responsible." To a 
personality which forces its presence upon you, you must respond in 
one way or another. To a personality which requires your effort to 
discover, the first requirement is that you know the nature of him and 
the second is that you be willing to make the moral adjustment necessary 
for living in harmony with him. This we believe, is the main import of 
the first commandment of the Christian religion, "Thou shalt love the 
Lord Thy God.......". 

The second commandment, "thou shalt love thy neighbor as 
thyself," is dependent on the first and is an expression of faithful 
response to the Christian concept of God. Mercy is shown to neighbors 
not because it is commanded but because it is God*s nature to have mercy 
and in showing concern for the welfare of dhers man expresses his faith¬ 
ful response to God. There are no limits or distinctions on the kind or 
number of neighbors because it is in the nature of God to have concern 
for every individual. We value the welfare of the worker above the produc¬ 
tion of the machine. Not only because in our own system of values material 
possessions are worth nothing if we lose our life and health for them but 
also, according to the Christian concept of God, the value of human per¬ 
sonality is far above, all the material riches in the world.

Our conclusion is that Christian morality- comes as a result of the 
faithful response to a personal God who is most fully revealed through 
the personality of a man, Jesus Christ. 

To summarize our whole thesis once again: Our conclusion is that 
evidence which we have at hand leads us to look for the standards of 
action, the motivating power and the instrument of moral progress in the 
personalities of men whose experience and understanding of God produces 
a re-evaluation of life and all its relationships. We conclude that, 
good as other methods of ethical study may be, the only truly fruitful 
study of morality must take into account the revelations of religion, 
since there are values in the world to which a personal response is 
required. Further, we conclude that since in the Christian revelation 
of God the moral response is made through the same channels that have 

been conditioned since childhood, the child-parent relationship, Christian 

morality when understood is still the soundest foundation for ethics that 
modern thought knows. Finally, that the constant concern of the Christian 
theologian must be to test the great principles of Christian morality 
against the experience and evidence of humanity until our understanding 
of the nature and values of God is stripped of all elements which leave 
us open to the charge of filling God with our own desires. The supreme 

task of the theologian is to find God in objective reality and the supreme 

duty of humanity is to respond faithfully to the maker of universal values.
