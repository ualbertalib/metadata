SYNOPSIS 


The author's three main objectives in this study were 
to investigate, draw general conclusions, and make observations 
concerning; 

(1) Maladjustments and personality character¬ 
istics of university students. 

(2) Effectiveness and need of counselling* 

(3) Reasons why students choose to enter the 
faculty of Education* 

Since the case study method was used no objective 
criteria could be established against which recommendations 
could be evaluated. 

In the study of maladjustment and personality charac¬ 
teristics fifteen students were examined* These students varied 
from the exceptionally stable to the exceptionally unstable* Of 
those who failed in their course, all but possibly one should have 
had the benefit of vocational guidance, from which at least some 
might have acquired sufficient insight into their limitations and 
defects to have selected another career* 

There was no evidence, other than inference, that the 
students had profited by the counselling services offered in 
these case studies* The study in this aspect was directed more 
towards determining the need, nature, and organization of 
counselling services than towards an attempt at complete counselliig •

At least four of the students should have received clinical 
treatment which the author was incapable of providing* The 
only one to receive professional treatment while in atten¬ 
dance at classes did adjust himself successfully and did 
graduate. The need for counselling services, however, was 
evident, and it is recommended that there should be established 
a campus counselling clinic which would give assistance in two 
fields; personal, and vocational counselling* 

Inquiry into the motives and forces behind the deci¬ 
sion to take teacher training was handicapped by student ration¬ 
alization. Nonetheless, it became obvious that out of the four 
students who either failed in, or withdrew from, teacher training 
during the term, not one had selected this professional training 
because of a desire to be a teacher* This failure group entered 
the Faculty of Education because of social and economic pressures 
or through the lack of feasible alternatives. 

The various reasons that students profess for entering 
the Faculty of Education might well be examined. Then a follow¬ 
up study could be mad© of those students who selected the 
teaching profession for no apparent reason other than expediency. 

Teacher selection and certification should be the 
result of wise career counselling, proper entrance standards, 
and academic success in the faculty of Education.

CHAPTER 1 

The Purpose of the Study 

In earlier counselling work with first year students 
the author was impressed by the importance of three questions. 

To answer these became the purpose of the study. 

First, what are types of maladjustments and personality 
characteristics of university students, and hew do these factors 
affect university careers? The influence of motivation, back¬ 
ground, ability, and personality were to be observed. No attempt 
was to be made with such a limited number of cases to weigh 
the various types of influence. It was, however, thought desir¬ 
able to portray as intimately as pcs sible a selected group of 
individuals, and then to make certain generalizations. 

Secondly, what need exists for counselling and what 
benefits might result from a well organized counselling service? 
This question presented two aspects for enquiry; determining 
the need for counselling, and considering the organization of 
counselling services. As to whether counselling would actually 
fill a student need or become merely another institution was 
a matter of importance. By providing some degree of counsel¬ 
ling, the author hoped to analyze student reaction to it and from 
this analysis develop some notions as to both the organization 
and usefulness of counselling. 

Thirdly, what are the categories of reasons that 
prompt students, particularly those who fail, to select teaching

as a profession? If the study indicated the possibility of a 
relationship existing between failure at university, and voca¬ 
tional motivation, then a future study might be made of this. 
Further, it would emphasize the importance of counsellors 
determining why students enter the Faculty of Education.

CHAPTER II 

PROCEDURES AND TECHNIQUES 
The Method 

The method selected in a study is chosen because of 
both the purpose and the nature of the problem under consi¬ 
deration, Each of the various types of enquiry has its 
strong and its weak points which render it suitable or unsuit¬ 
able for different fields of research. The five general 
categories of thesis investigation were examined with the 
following conclusions. 

The historical method cannot be used for a study 
such as this one which requires an intimate examination of 
individuals. If teacher selection and counselling programmes 
alone were to be enquired into, then the biographical approach 
might be used. Existing counselling services and teacher 
selection procedures could be studied, analyzed, and compared. 
In this study, however, the close examination of a number of 
students was the major problem and so the historical method was 
inapplicable. 

The normative survey method also provides the wrong 
approach to this study. The normative survey is essentially 
an enumerative or counting procedure. The tabulation of data 
produces norms, averages, correlations, or standards, which, 
although indicating states or trends do not show the why and

how. When one wishes to probe into the play of psychological 
forces there is too much that cannot be measured quantitative¬ 
ly* 

The genetic method has as its purpose the study of 
growth and development. This method obviously cannot be utilized 
here because the selected area of research has little in common 
with that of the genetic method. 

The experimental method might be utilized for so bob 
sections of this investigation except that practical difficul¬ 
ties precluded it. The experimental method applied to educa¬ 
tional problems makes necessary use of all the techniques of 
experimental design and would require matched groups or couples 
in this study. With students coming in from all over the pro¬ 
vince this would have proven an impossible task and narrowed 
the scope of the enquiry. 

The case study method is the only method that lends 
itself to the task at hand. Primarily, the study was to make 
psychological studies of student teachers and secondly, to 
make inferences concerning teacher selection and counselling. 

It was hoped that through the intensive study of a few indivi¬ 
duals the author might acquire some important insights into the 
personalities of some of the students, and that from these 
insights some reasonably valid deductions might be made. 

The case study method not only embodies great advan¬ 
tages but also profound weaknesses. The insights listed herein 
by the investigator may well be the projections of his own

opinions. Obviously it is very difficult for the reader or the 
author to determine whether the conclusions reached are sub¬ 
jective or objective. Biased judgment takes place so uncon¬ 
sciously that the author himself cannot be assured of his 
objectivity. Since no attempt was made to select a typical 
group, and since the group was definitely atypical, great 
care had to be exercised in making conclusions that would 
normally require a proper random sample. 

Preliminary Procedures 

Fifteen students were selected for this case study 
group. Thirteen of them were in the Temporary License 
programme while the other two were on the B.Ed. course. Of 
the latter, one was commencing the course and one finishing 
it. The sex distribution was seven female and eight male. 

The group was not a random sample chosen by any 
of the accepted random sampling methods. The fifteen were 
chosen because of their unique qualities which were desired 
for study and observation. Personality types in the case study 
group covered a wide range which included the normal, the 
maladjusted, and the neurotic. The thesis committee, instruc¬ 
tors, and author, all worked in close co-operation in the 


selection of this group

When the list was compiled, the selected students were 
called to a meeting. On the part of some there were varying 
degrees of suspicion as to why they had been selected. They 
were however, assured that they were a special group picked to 
help in a survey of the present counselling programme, and 
that it was hoped that worthwhile recommendations to the Faculty 
of Education would he made as a result of the work. It was 
further explained that they had been selected as individuals 
because it was felt that each one possessed some special quali¬ 
ty or qualities which rendered them valuable to the study. From 
the commencement of this study a fine atmosphere existed between 
author and group. 

The group showed considerable interest in the oppor¬ 
tunity afforded them in taking special psychometric tests and 
in discussing results. It was an interest that lasted through¬ 
out the year, and they remained eager to write aptitude interest 
and personality tests. 

A programme of maintaining contact had to be carefully 
organized. The students in the group handed in individual time¬ 
tables and received the author’s. It was then arranged that 
appointments would be made by using the Faculty of Education 
mail box. In addition, one afternoon a week was set aside for 
testing and interviewing. An afternoon was selected in which 


each student had at least one spare period. This arrangement

made provision for at least one personal contact a week. 

The author also made himself available for special interviews 
during his spare periods. 

Individual files were kept on each student. Into 
these files went all relevant data such as psychometric test 
results, academic ratings, replies to questionnaires, auto¬ 
biographies, and jottings from interviews. At no time did 
the author write anything in front of any member of the group, 
thereby making him feel that he or she was a "guinea pig". 
These files were invaluable not only for the final assessment 
but in guiding the day to day procedure. 


Major Procedures and Techniques 

Interview and General Information Forms 

As a preliminary to getting acquainted, interview 
forms and Department of Education students* questionnaires 
were given to the class. These questionnaires revealed the 
usual weaknesses of being subjective and of not indicating 
either the extent of participation or the skill in the 
indicated interests and activities. For example, two students 
expressed a marked interest in music, yet one of the two students 
did not play any musical instrument, and did not participate 
actively in anything associated with music. The other student

had a high degree of technical skill and fine record of par¬ 
ticipation. The questionnaire however, did serve the purpose 
of providing a background for personal interview, at which time 
these other aspects could be investigated. 

The two questionnaires provided data onj the family, 
vital statistics* personal and academic history, cultural 
bacljground, hobbies, reading interests, problems and miscel¬ 
laneous experiences. At this point in the programme it was 
made clear to the students that all information would be 
kept strictly in confidence insofar as they themselves were 
personally concerned, and that any written use of data would 
refer to anonymous cases only. 

Statements of High bchool Principals 

In order to acquire information from other observers 
the author sent out a circular letter and a questionnaire to the 
principals of the last schools attended by members of the experi¬ 
mental group. One principal could not be located and for special 
reasons two others were not written to. All the other principals 
replied, some frankly, some cautiously; and much useful infor¬ 
mation was added to the files. It will h© noted that in this 
questionnaire free use of rating scales was made in an attempt 
to measure roughly the degree of various social factors. 
Observation of Practice Teaching 

Previously it had been stated that there was no 


intention to supplement the instructional facilities

Accordingly, it was decided to interview the faculty observer 
of practice teaching rather than attempt the nearly impossible 
task of personally observing the teaching. Only on two 
occasions did the writer observe any of the students in charge 
of a class,and thi3 was done at the request of staff members. 

The Wire Recorder 

To be able to speak correctly with clear diction 
and proper modulation is an invaluable asset to any teacher. 
Nonetheless, many teachers instruct for years and are uncon¬ 
scious of the fact that their speech is a liability to them¬ 
selves, to their teaching, to their students, and to their 
profession. 

The first step in speech culture must be to make the 
individual aware of what his speech sounds like to other 
people. Since the speaker knows in advance what is going to be 
said and since the ears are connected to the throat, the speaker 
gets an exaggerated idea of the clarity and quality of his 
speaking. The idea that his speech has defects is extremely 
difficult to convey to the speaker. One of the best methods 
of making the individual aware of his faults is to play back 
a recorded speech and let the speaker listen to it critically. 
Fortunately, the Faculty of Education had an excellent wire 
recorder which was made available for the project.

As a preliminary procedure the author demonstrated the 
use of the recorder# One set speech was recorded by the author 
in a rapid, hysterical style, then in a tone dull and slurred 
style, and finally in a clear and forceful style. The psycholo¬ 
gical effects of the same speech with different deliveries were 
then observed and discussed# At this point the students were 
taught how to operate the wire recorder* and they made informal 
recordings# 

For the permanent and comparative speech recordings 
a special spool of wire was secured# Each student then, in 
private with the author, gave his or her name into the micro- 
phone^and followed it with one and a half minutes of selected 
reading# A minute and forty-five second blank was then left 
on the wire so that at a later date a comparative reading of 
the same selection could be inserted# There was no intention 
of making a precise study of the us© of wire recorders in speech 
training; consequently no tallies were kept showing the number 
and type of errors in pronunciation, enunciation and usage. At 
the end of the year’s study the speech samples were played over 
one or more times to determine if there was an appreciable im¬ 
provement in speaking# 

Psychometric Testing 

While a comprehensive plan of testing was planned and 
carried out it was decided early in the project that a dynamic

study should not consist of space-filling tables and graphs of 
psychometric data. There have been a great many skilled investi¬ 
gations into the reliability and validity of most of the major 
psychometric tests. To have attempted to come to any conclusions 
other than those on the utility of the tests would have been most 
unscientific. Reference is therefore made to the tests only 
when it seems of some pertinence to a particular case study. 

While the better tests work out more or less satisfactorily for 
large groups such as the army, their use in small groups for 
Individual prediction is subject to considerable error. Test 
limitations therefore were kept well in mind. 

The following tests were used more or less exten¬ 
sively? 

1) The Nelson-Denny Reading Test. 

2) The Nelson-Denny Vocabulary Test. 

3) The Wellesley Spelling Test. 

4) The Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest Inventory. 

5) The Weehsler-Bellvue Intelligence Test. 

6} The Iowa Placement Examinations. 

7) The Vocational Guidance Centre Intelligence Test. 

8) The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. 

9) The Rorschach Ink Blot Test. 

10) The Johnson Temperament Analysis Test. 

Tests one, two, three, four, five, seven and eight were 
given to all the students while the others were given only in

special cases and for special reasons. The Rorschach was the 
only one not given by the author. It was administered three times 
once by a psychologist^and twice by specially trained graduates. 
Some of the tests were given because the students were interested 
in acquainting themselves with the tests and then in discussing 
what may or may not have been revealed. 

Consultation with Faculty Members 

Information from the members of the Faculty of Edu¬ 
cation was acquired in two ways. First there was constant 
and informal contact throughout the year. Special cases were 
discussed and confidential information passed on where it seemed 
wise to do so. Faculty members tended to keep the special group 
of students well in mind and generously gave much of their time 
in discussion of the students. The second method was the sub¬ 
mitting of a rating scale questionnaire to three of the faculty 
members at the end of the term. They then gave a rating on 
a number of personality traits. 

In general there was close agreement amongst the 
staff concerning the students*and it is interesting to note that 
many if not most of the unusual cases were detected quite early 
in the term. More concerning this particular aspect of teacher 
training will be said in the conclusions under the section deal¬ 
ing with teacher training. 

Aut obiographies

students at the end of the term. This had been left till then 
on the assumption that the students might be more inolined to 
reveal more to someone whom they had come to regard as a friend¬ 
ly counsellor. There is some reason to suppose that this was 
true although three did not turn in an autobiography. 

A rough outline as to what the autobiography should 
contain was planned and the following general areas were decided 
ons 

1) Family and occupations. 

2) Siblings. 

S) Early activities. 

4) Pleasant and unpleasant memories; early likes and 
dislikes» 

5) Teachers. 

6) Attitude to school and particular subjects. 

7) Hobbies, church life, social views. 

8) Reasons for choosing teaching. 

9) First impressions of university. 

10) Evaluation of university education. 

11) The university staff. 

12) Any changes in views and attitudes in the last year. 
Sections one to four were to cover early life; five to eight school 
life; and nine to twelve university careers.

Consultation 

Consultations* both group and individual, occupied 
a major portion of the study. Of prime importance was the 
development of a friendly and constructive relationship between 
the author and the student so that a constant assessment of 
the student could be made. In this field the psychometric 
tests promoted a great deal of candid and revealing discus¬ 
sion, 

A proper counselling room was not available, A 
specific classroom however, was set aside for one half day 
each week and specifically allocated to this group. In 
addition to this the graduate study room was also utilized. 
While it was not ideal for counselling and case study, it did 
prove fairly satisfactory. 

With two exceptions the students established close 
contact with the counsellor. Much time, over and above the 
usual hours, was spent with some of them in a discussion of 
their histories and their past and present difficulties. One 
of the students who left abruptly just before the end of the 
term maintained until his death considerable correspondence 
of an intimate nature. 

On only two occasions did the consultations involve 
help with practice teaching assignments and these two were for

rural appointments* On the whole } demonstration teachers and 
faculty members did such a thorough job of briefing the students 
that students did not feel the need for any additional assis¬ 
tance* As was stated in the beginning there was no intention 
to supplement faculty instruction,and this emancipation of the 
author from such tasks made time available for the more personal 
elements of the case study* 

School Superintendents 

A post graduation follow-up was necessary both from a 
standpoint of the actual case histories and of the recommenda¬ 
tions. Accordingly through the kindly offices of the A*T.A* 
the students* addresses as well as those of their superinten¬ 
dents were secured® Then just prior to the end of the students* 
first school year the school superintendents were communicated 
with and asked for their opinions of the experimental group* 

All of the school superintendents replied* 

Students* Post Graduate Questionnaires 

At the same time as the school superintendents were 
written to, questionnaires were sent to the students. It was 
hoped that the more mature reflections which come from experience 
would greatly help certain aspects of the case studies. 

Follow Up 

During the four year interval between the commencement 
and the completion of the study the author has maintained varying

CHAPTER 111 
CASE STUDIES. 

Introduction 

This section depicts as accurately as possible the 
individuals comprising the case study group. Who they were; 
what were their hopes and fears; why they reacted as they 
did; how they grew up: these are all fundamental aspects of 
this case study. The large accumulation of test data, both 
academic and psychometric, has been referred to only when 
found useful in the delineation of the personality concerned. 
The anonymity of the students has been preserved,at least in 
part, by employing letter designations. 

The case studies are arranged in descending order of 
importance, a sequence determined by the amount and quality 
of the data. Case A was placed first because in the author’s 
opinion this study contained the most valid information. Case 
0 was placed last because the author was unsuccessful in 
securing either interviews or reliable information. 

No attempt is made at generalization; that has been 
left to a succeeding chapter. From th8 overview of the case 
studies a considerable number of significant points became 
evident, but as such they comprised no important part of any 
particular case study. This chapter then is descriptive, and

CASE A 

This story at' A accumulated hit by hit over a period 
of two years. It concerns a man who should have been beaten hut 
wasn’t. Certain incidents in the story were told by A with 
vividness and drama; most of it was a natter of droll comment on 
past experiences related with a belittling sens© of humor. Some 
of the information was obtained from friends, associates, and 
comrades-in-arms• 

A was one of a large French Canadian family. The 
father is pictured as a lively, industrious individual of 
reasonably stable disposition, although, according to A, he 
could be exceedingly dogmatic at times. He made a living for 
the family by gardening and carpentry. As in most working 
men’s families there was a constant struggle for existence. 

A was one of the younger members. 

When A was about the age of four an event of great 
significance took place. Completely abandoning her family, 
the mother packed up her personal effects and left with another 
man. The reasons are not known, but in the sequel it will be 
seen that the mother had a complete disregard for convention. 

The family was Roman Catholic and there was no divorce. The 
mother’s act appeared to create a deep feeling of guilt and 
shame in the children. 


Left with a large family, the youngest of which was

a baby, the father was faced with a difficult problem* 

Lacking funds to hire a housekeeper he sent the younger 
ones including A to a church institution* The older ones 
ran the home and attended school as best they could. A ! s 
earliest experiences thus were associated with a feeling 
of insecurity, a broken home and a mother’s disgrace* 

Memories of the church institution were unpleasant 
and life must have been unhappy for him there. To him the 
Sisters were cold, and overly severe guardians* Sports 
were not allowed. As a result A felt conspicuously inferior 
when mixing with other boys on the occasions when he was 
home* He could not swim, skate, play ball, nor do anything 
in athletics. Consequently he could not mix with the boys 
in their nomal activities and hence developed a resentful 
feeling of inferiority. 

Nor was his feeling of inferiority limited to 
physical Drowess. For some reason, probably his anxiety and 
unhappiness, he did not do well at school. According to A 
the Sister berated him day after day for his poor work. He 
was told how stupid he was and publicly rated a failure* 

At this stage we now find him with little affection, rejected 
by his mother, and meeting life very inadequately both in 
the institution and outside it. A must have been a maelstrom

of unhappy and conflicting emotions. 

A was early subject to deep fears. In this 
connection he mentioned the sanitary arrangements of the 
institution. This was obviously one of the poorer schools 
and conveniences were of a somewhat primitive nature. The 
boy*s nrivy was particularly so and lay at the bottom of a 
dark basement stairway. As a measure of economy all lights 
were turned off at night and to A his frequent night trips 
became journeys of fear. 

Pt this time A also experienced another emotional 
shock. His mother visited him in the institution bringing 
with her a baby, the product of her illicit love affair. 

The incident gave him a deep feeling of shame and disgrace. 
This was heightened by the knowledge that most of his 
associates knew of his family affairs. Their memories were 
now refreshed. At this time in his life he learned to re¬ 
press his feelings and to give an appearance of self-assurance. 

This occurrence shed some light on the mother. 

It must be considered rather extraordinary that a woman not in 
good standing with the church would return to a church instit¬ 
ution with one of her illegitimate offspring and request a 
visit with one of her abandoned children. She seemed to 
have been a person who lived her own life without regard for 
others or the rules of society.

When war broke out A was staying at home working 
and attending church school. His school work was still mediocre, 
if not poor, particularly in mathematics. Unflattering .re¬ 
marks were still his daily reward at school and existence was 
a constant struggle. Life seemed to be a never ending series 
of frustrations. 

The army now offered a break in this unsatisfactory 
state of affairs. It offered excitement, escape, and above 
all a chance to associate with men and be regarded as one. 

The uniform would be his badge to the world in general. A 
was seventeen years old when he walked into the recruiting 
office and joined a well known Highland regiment as piper. 
Although he had had no particular training in music he was 
so determined to succeed that he practised long hours and 
did become a creditable performer on the pipes. 

It was not long before the unit proceeded overseas 
where he spent about four years in Britain prior to the 
actual invasion of Europe. While there he was one of a 
small group selected to go to the Royal Piping School at 
Edinburgh. This completed his training as a piper. The 
doggedness and perseverance which he displayed on this course 
impressed his instructors. Although by their standards he 
entered the school as an inferior piper, they were satisfied 


when he left

Most service men are fairly talkative about their 
non-combat experiences but A was not; he was either indifferent 
or took them as a matter of course. Apparently he did not 
frequent either pubs or dance halls and led a rather res¬ 
trained life for a young soldier. He did speak of a casual 
"affair” which was neither serious nor intimate and on another 
occasion he mentioned what was to him a shocking experience 
with a G.W.A.C. lieutenant who was a pervert. 

From other sources it also appeared that his over¬ 
seas social life was mainly in the army. This was in great 
measure due to his crippling sense of inferiority which is 
discussed later. A's appearance was highly prepossessing 
and he could be an engaging conversationalist. Although well 
liked by his associates, he displayed a reluctance to mix with 
society at large. This behaviour must be attributed in part 
to his inner lack of self assurance and to his own personal 
assessment. 

At one time during his training period he was re¬ 
commended by his commanding officer for an infantry commission. 
Apparently the personnel officer after due consideration re¬ 
fused to concur and nothing further came of it. A attempted 
to find out why he was rejected but could not. In view of his 
fine appearance and efficiency award, the personnel

officer must have suspected some inner flaw that might cause 
A to fail in a crisis . 1 

The invasion came and three days after "D" Day,A f s 
unit landed. He piped them into their first attack and then 
became a combat infantry man. Considering the fact that all 
men are nervous under attack he was probably no more so than 
any other soldier undergoing his first combat experience. 

He carried on as an infantry man into the Battle of the Bulge. 

Battle fatigue or neurosis now overcame him. A 
described its onset with great vividness and intensity. He 
told of getting himself separated from his unit in the dark 
and finally finding himself in enemy territory. Terror-stricken, 
he dug a fox hole and cowered in the bottom. Emotionally it 
was a recapitulation on a more intense scale of his early years; 
a feeling of insecurity, anxiety and loneliness, with no on© 
to turn to. When advance units pushed the enemy back they 
found A, a classical example of battle fatigue. Completely 
unable to walk, it was a feeling of intense humiliation that 
he experienced as the stretcher party carried him to the rear. 

1 Practice teaching provided a significant sidelight to this 
side of A*s personality. One observer commented on the 
fact that A laid careful plans but when things did not deve¬ 
lop as he anticipated he lost control of the situation. The 
author spent much time working out with A the problem of talk¬ 
ing and acting so that the audience would not detect a lack 
of self assurance.

While he was locked up in a field station the place was 
bombed and strafed. Terrified, he broke out during the 
raid and hours later he was found a convulsive wreck, 
cowering in a slit trench. In A f s words it seemed almost 
as if he were a spectator watching himself do things 
that he desperately did not want to do. Returned to 
England as an exceptionally severe case of battle fatigue 
he underwent treatment and recovered sufficiently to 
carry on duties as a sergeant instructor. He wished to 
rejoin his unit but that was out of the question. He 
remained on active duty in England until the end of the 
war. 

Finally came repatriation and demobilization. 
After years of social rejection he was determined to be 
somebody and decided to go to university. At D.V.A. he 
was bluntly told that his mental ability test showed he 
was a poor candidate for university and that furthermore 
his scholastic record substantiated the test. Nonetheless , 
he insisted on his veterans* rights and he attended pre¬ 
matriculation school. The sound qualities of the man be¬ 
gan to emerge,and by virtue of slaving long hours he 
successfully passed his university entrance tests. 

It was at university that the author first came 
in contact with A. At this time he was tall, lean, well- 
built and rather striking in appearance; the sort of chap 
one is favourably impressed with on sight. Always im-

peccable in appearance and dressed in good taste, he exercised 
fine manners and good judgment in his day to day social rela¬ 
tionships* A casual acquaintanceship in an English class led 
to his becoming a member of a coffee table group of older 
veterans* A became quite popular and acquired a reputation 
as raconteur* His humor was original, dry, and at times al¬ 
most brilliant. The group noted and discussed, however, some¬ 
thing that they couldnH clearly define. There was a highly 
deferential, highly restrained and over controlled side to 
him that made his friends decide that he had been through some 
very disturbing experiences and was still badly shaken. 

Academically his work was inconsistent. Studying 
was done under great tension and with emotional blockage. 

In his first year he failed political economy. The following 
summer he studied it and occasionally came to the writer for 
help. In the fall supplemental examinations he topped the 
list of those passing. Fearful that if his supposedly low 
I.Q, were ever found out that university authorities would ex¬ 
pel him he absented himself from the freshman I.Q. tests. It 
was not until his final year that he discovered his I.Q. was 
in the superior group. 

In the spring of his first year at university he 
married an airforce widow with one child. She was a very in-

telligent girl who had also been attending university. The 
marriage presented some problems since A was a Catholic and 
the bride was a staunch Protestant. After long and serious 
thought he decided to leave his church and to get married in 
his bride*s faith. Instead of just quietly absenting himself 
from his church he went directly to his church authorities and 
told them what he intended doing. A number of attempts were 
made to dissuade him but they were without effect; A remained 
adamant in his decision. Once again he displayed considerable 
courage and forthrightness in making personal decisions. 

The marriage prospered quite well but there was some 
rather unwarranted interference by her parents. He was 
genuinely fond of his foster daughter and usually all was well. 
Any action or remark, however, that reflected on his capacity 
to run things as a responsible individual caused A a great 
deal of distress. These incidents either precipitated a tem¬ 
per display or a period of brooding. If he decided to buy 
something and his wife decided against it he took this as an 
indication that she considered him a child mentally and that 
he required someone over him. 

A*s final year at university was one of increased 
emotional tension. Most of the time spent over his books was 
actually spent fighting himself. The increased tension was 


obvious to his friends, his wife, and some of the professors

At this time the writer who was experimenting with the Minnesota 
Multiphasio Personality Inventory asked A if he would like to 
do one. He was very willing and did so. The profile is so 
interesting that it is recorded below. Starting at the 
scales read: depression, hysteria, psychopathic deviate, mas¬ 
culinity, paranoia, psychasthenia, schizophrenia and hypomania. 

Two personality profiles are shown. The on© in red is 
from the first test taken prior to treatment by a psychiatrist 
and the one in black is from a test after treatment by a psychi¬ 
atrist. Any part of the profile outside of the two heavy 
horizontal lines is considered abnormal. It is interesting to 
note that the depressive, psychasthenic and schizophrenic factors 
are very high with the hysteria factor also verging on clinical 
significance. One .ccuid scarcely imagine a better candidate for 
shell shock than the possessor of this profile.

The author was much concerned because of the unusual 
pattern; particularly since it seemed to conform to past history* 
A of course insisted on seeing the chart and having some ex¬ 
planation* This the author tried to do in a way that would make 
the results seem inconsequential but A was far from convinced 
and perhaps a false chart should have been shown to him* 

At Christmas time A*s marks were rather poor and 
greatly disturbed him* Since he needed four second class stand¬ 
ings out of four senior courses the results were very dis¬ 
couraging and he began to fear that he would never acquire his 
much desired degree. Worse, he feared that he would fail in 
so many courses that he would have to leave university* A be¬ 
gan brooding over this situation and there was a marked increase 
in tension. 

Shortly after Christmas A was absent from classes. 

Upon noting this the author waited until the second day’s absence 
and then called at A*s home. He was absent and A’s wife ex¬ 
plained that he had simply lost control as a result of a trivial 
domestic tiff and walked out "for good". She planned on leaving 
for her sister’s home in the Peace River country. 

After a long candid talk about A f s behaviour and their 
relationship it was decided that she would stay quietly at home. 
If and when A did return she was advised to treat the affair as 
of no consequence and save his pride by telling him to stay 


home

It seemed likely that he would return on the pretext of getting 
books or clothing. 

In the meantime A sought out the author at the uni¬ 
versity in order to get advice concerning a boarding place. 

There was no difficulty in persuading A to return to university 
and although the author made no mention of his domestic affairs 
A was very emphatic about never returning home. The author 
agreed with him, and wholeheartedly plunged into the job of 
locating suitable living quarters. As was anticipated pros- 
pective lodgings were either "too expensive" or"too poorly 
located" for A. 

The author now felt that outside help was necessary 
and so Dr. X who had had some experience as a psychiatrist was 
consulted. He agreed to spend some time in helping A. The 
author then had a very candid talk with A who was very eager to 
make the attempt at gaining some understanding and mastery of 
his emotional state. Dr. S. of the Faculty of Education was 
also consulted and A was sent to him on the pretext of discussing 
one of his courses. Dr. S. thought that A was a little bewil¬ 
dered and vague in his ideas and reactions. From that time 
Dr. S. who lectured in one of A’s courses, kBpt him under ob¬ 
servation. 

A, as had been expected, returned home and shortly 
afterwards commenced treatment under Dr. X.

Dr* X immediately administered the Rorschach test and 
A*s comments on it to the author are rather interesting, as once 
again they illustrate his overwhelming sense of inferiority. 

To A, Dr. X represented an omnipotent genius looking down with 
a condescending smile at the mental labouring of a dullard. A 
worried about his responses to the ink blot configurations and 
frequently discussed with the author what he thought he saw. At 
all time great caution was exercised so as to not complicate the 
work of the psychiatrist. 

After the Rorschach test Dr. X was given A*s history 
and the Minnesota Multipbasic Personality Inventory. Dr. X had 
until now requested that no information be given to him until 
after the Rorschach test. This was to keep the latter test as 
objective as possible* In more intimate detail and in a more 
revealing manner the Rorschach confirmed the M.M.P.I. results. 

It also fitted in with A f s early life and experiences. Dr. X 
stated that A was in a serious emotional condition and regular 
interviews and psychoanalysis were carried on for a period ex¬ 
tending over four months. 

Preocupation concerning his low I.Q. still was pre¬ 
dominant in A*s self analysis. Definitely afraid to let any¬ 
one in the university, even his friends, know the results, he 
would not consent to I.Q. testing. Finally he was persuaded

that the psychologist at the Col. Mewburn Hospital would 
keep the secret well* When he discovered that the Wechsler- 
Bellvue rated him ”superior” it gave him a new lease on 
life and confidence in himself* It is probable that be¬ 
cause of his attitude to I.Q. tests combined with emotional 
difficulties that he actually rated higher. It is to be 

observed that this preoccupation with mental states is a 

/ 

classical manifestation of schizoid tendencies which showed 
up on both the M.M.p.I. and the Rorschach* 

The Rorschach test also showed some deep rooted 
aggressions. A had mentioned that sports were forbidden 
at his first school. Possession of a baseball was a puni¬ 
shable offence and discipline was strict . 1 Consequently 
there was no normal release of aggression in sport. A was 
advised to take up curling, fishing and hunting as soon 
as possible after leaving university. Suicide tendencies 
were also indicated in the test and A confided that he had 
often contemplated jumping off the High Level Bridge as a

1 Investigation discloses this statement is exaggerated. 
The school was not a good one; recreation facilities 
were non-existent; discipline was strict,but punishment 
for having a baseball was extremely unlikely.

At widely separated periods A became very aggressive. 
On the occasions when he lost social control he would do such 
things as ordering his mother-in-law out of the house or 
challenging his burly police sergeant father-in-law* 

Psycho-analytical treatment in the meantime seemed 
to be relieving the tensions and leading to some measure of 
insight. Dr. X, Dr* S, friends and A’s wife all made un¬ 
solicited comments that there seemed a significant improve¬ 
ment. Dr. S felt that there was less tense sitting and 
more studying taking place* an observation which later proved 
true. Friends had noticed that socially there was less evi¬ 
dence of over control and greater ease of manner. A*s wife 
while noting the improvement stated that the pressure of 
coming from behind in his work and trying to get the four 
seconds which he needed was still quite an obvious strain. 

A himself at this time came to the author and said 
that he felt that he was relieved emotionally. He expressed 
the greatest admiration for Dr. X who, he felt, had given him 
some understanding as to the why and the how of his present 
state. He then requested another M.M. P.l. out of curiosity 
as to whether it would confirm his personal conviction of an 
improvement. After a suitable interval the M.M.P.l. is valid 
for retesting so the test was administered.

The results of the second M.M.P.I. are worth some 
comment and for purposes of comparison with the first test 
they are graphed in red along with the first test on page 30. 
The most striking feature of the graph is that the two pro¬ 
files are almost parallel, with the last profile being al¬ 
most two sigmas lower. This put the re-test profile in 
the "normal" area between the two black lines. 

Dr. X was much interested in the second test when 
it was shown to him. He stated that the result in view of 
the nature of the questionnaire could not reasonably be at¬ 
tributed to either chance or conscious selection. The author 
is far from suggesting however that he considers the M.M.P.I. 
a highly refined scientific test for accurately gauging per¬ 
sonality traits and their modification. Further no inference 
can be drawn no matter how startling the results. 

The results of the final examination showed A had 
made four seconds and one third. Unfortunately the third 
was in a subject in which he needed a second. Nonetheless, 

A was quite justifiably proud of himself, and it was a rather 
remarkable achievement. A enrolled in summer school, made a 
decond in his deficient course, and graduated in the fall. 

In the selection of a position A showed consider¬ 
able initiative and judgment. Advised to seek personal in¬ 
terviews he hitchhiked and travelled over a considerable area.

Neither did he take the first position offered to him although 
his wife thought that he should. Eventually he secured a 
position in a junior high school in one of the cities. 

Since then A has become the father of two sons of 
his own, an accomplishment of which he is inordinately proud. 
He has taken an active part in the affairs of his professional 
association, and is well thought of. Socially he has taken 
root in his community, belongs to a number of clubs and is a 
home owner. 

His follow up reveals that he would not take teacher 
training if he had another opportunity to attend university. 

On a ten point rating scale to indicate enjoyment in teaching 
A placed himself at four. (Ten was highest.) Still later, 
however, he has expressed increased satisfaction with his 
profession. 

Case A represents an almost incredible achievement. 
Wheh one stops to visualize this young veteran with less than 
a grade eleven education, firmly convinced of his own basic 
inferiority and still suffering from battle fatigue and 
maladjustment, one cannot help but admire that spark that 
carried him through his emotional and academic crises. It is 
of course too early to consider the case satisfactorily closed.

CASE B 

Case B was a difficult one in which to gain insight. 
Highly co-operative, yet non-communicative, interested, hut 
obviously ill at ease, B was the product of rather curious 
social forces. For much of the information the author is 
indebted to former school teachers and a large number of in¬ 
dividuals who belonged to the same church and community. 

While B was clearly uncomfortable during the discussion of 
personal affairs, after he left university he wrote some ex¬ 
tremely candid and revealing letters. These letters in 
great measure substantiated what independent observers had 
stated. 

B was born in a Mormon settlement in Utah of 
Mormon parents. His father, of English extraction, was a 
university educated school teacher, and his mother, of 
Swedish descent, had been a postal clerk. He had six sisters 
and three brothers. Three sisters and one brother were 
younger than he. 

Since it had some influence on B’s personality a 
passing reference must be mad© to Mormon history. After the 
death of Joseph Smith, the founder, there was a schism in 
the church. B’s ancestor was one of a small group which held 
views contrary to those held by the official Mormon body. 
Perhaps because of this there developed a family feeling of

being in the social group but not dependent on it; a group 
within a group* Perhaps this was the origin of the sense 
of pride and independence that characterized the family. 

It became a necessity for the family to demonstrate that it 
could get along in the social community without leaning on 
it. To do otherwise would have caused a loss in pride and 
prestige thereby bringing their dissident opinions into a 
less favourable position. On the other hand it may have 
been the urge to demonstrate this feeling of self-sufficiency 
that led the family to challenge commonly accepted concepts. 
Even in B’s short career his father championed what were 
then unorthodox political and religious beliefs. 

B*s older brother attended university at the same 
time and the author came to know him very well. This bro¬ 
ther requested some psychometric testing for himself which 
was done. Prom him considerable information was obtained 
concerning B. Although B's brother was a brilliant student, 
a veteran, and a scholarship winner, even at university he 
affected the garb one would expect on the range. Most of the 
time he wore cowboy jeans, checkered shirt and stetson. 
Observers raised near the family maintained that this type of 
behaviour was quite in character. Against this background 
of family tradition and social pressures B was raised. 


While he was still very young B f s family moved to

southern Alberta where his father engaged in teaching, fam¬ 
ing and ranching. Shortly after this B*s father became at¬ 
tracted by the then highly unorthodox economic theories of 
the late William Aberhart and the Social Credit Party. El¬ 
ected as an M.P. when the party first swept Alberta he has 
conscientiously represented the same riding ever since. 

The father’s parliamentary career resulted in his 
absence from home for long periods of time. It also height¬ 
ened his prestige and placed him in an even greater position 
of authority, and respect in his family. One of his church 
associates mentioned that he was strongly bigoted on social, 
religious, and political affairs. Since B had a tremendous 
respect for his father he never questioned his wishes but 
accented them as being above questioning. We shall see later 
that this relationship may have had unfortunate consequences. 

B*s school record from an academic viewpoint was 
rather poor when one considers his Wechsler-Bellvue I.Q. of 
127. In his final year in grade 12 his marks were: English 
63, social studies 50, algebra 41, biology 60, chemistry 46 . 
This gave him an average of 52 which does not substantiate 
his personal evaluation of his own attitude to school as 
"enthusiastic". From the start it was apparent that B’s 
expressed opinions were the ones he considered socially 
acceptable rather than the ones he inwardly valued. 

During his whole school career, shopwork and art were his

only outstanding subjects, and he often stated that he was 
perfectly happy while working by himself at something art¬ 
istic which required manual dexterity. 

In his subsequent letters B repeatedly mentioned 
that he had never been afraid of being punished but only of 
doing wrong. Doing the right thing became almost a fetish 
with himjand it finally got him into a situation to which 
he could not reconcile himself. His ’’enthusiastic" assess¬ 
ment of his school life is an excellent example of this. 

To be a scholar was "the right thing" and so he went through 
the dutiful but unproductive motions of trying to be one. 

His school record and teacher*s comments indicate that he 

neither liked nor responded to academic life. 

\\ 

Socially his school life was a failure. To quote 
one of his letters, "Because of my retiring manner I was 
never in any really responsible position nor was I in with 
the crowd, so to speak. This didn*t bother me because I en¬ 
joyed doing things alone but I believe it has had an effect 
on my life in that I am not a good mixer with people now be¬ 
cause I didn*t assert myself then". A former principal 
oarticularly noted his limited participation in social act¬ 
ivities and commented on his lack of social poise. This was 
to a great extent a characteristic of other members of the 


family. The nearest thing to social participation by B was

in sports. In a silent way he took a fairly active part in 
athletics, particularly basketball. 

Upon leaving school B had no particular ambition 
other than to satisfy his own simple wants through labour, 
but it produced a clash between his sense of duty and his 
deep rooted temperament. His sense of duty was the product 
of his father*s strict admonition that he had an intellectual 
destiny to fulfil. B had an unusual gift for leather work 
and in his last year at school during shop periods he made 
a saddle. Hand tooled and silver mounted, it was worth some 
hundreds of dollars. Upon leaving school B therefore drift¬ 
ed into a leather shop and seemed very happy working by him¬ 
self making saddles and other artistic leather products. 

The Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest Inventory 
when given to B nroduced the following percentile scores: 
manipulative interests 90 , composition 0, verbal 20, per¬ 
sonal-social 20, nature 90, mechanics 70, business 0, art¬ 
istic 90 and science 10. A study of this profile, if accept¬ 
ed as valid, would explain his desire to get back to leather 
work. It would also indicate why he was a hopeless misfit 
in the social science fields. 

The M.M.P.I. showed nothing serious although the 
depressive and psychasthenic factors were prominent. There 
was also a significant indication of introversion. The

schizophrenia factor was very low and as we shall see later, 
there is reason to suspect that this is one of the cases 
where the M.M.P.I. was in error. Schizophrenia occasionally 
has gone undetected by this test which lays no claim to be¬ 
ing infallible. It is maintained that where the test does 
not reveal a real case of schizophrenia the paranoia factor 
usually shows up. There was, however, no paranoia indication 
in B's M.M.P.I. profile. B did claim that he was easily de¬ 
pressed and unexpected reverses rendered him despondent. 

Despite B f s rather dour outlook on life he was per¬ 
haps happiest at work in the leather shop. His father, how¬ 
ever, gave him the feeling that he was an unsettled ne'er-do- 
well so B deferred to his father's wishes that he take up 
teaching as a profession. 

The selection of teaching as a career has some 
interesting aspects. In the questionnaire he volunteered 
only one reason for his choice of teaching. It was simply 
"father". Later, in letters written in the army he elaborated 
and perhaps rationalized on this. He said that his father had 
pointed out that the things he had been doing would neither 
build a future nor orovide sufficient security to get married. 
He revealed that for a time he thought he had "someone" for 
whom to build a future, but that he had counted too much on 
human nature. When he realized that he was no longer - if at 
any time - the favoured suitor, it, in his own words, "knocked

the props from under me” and he lost his great motive for 
being at university. 

The courtship and love affair of B was rather an 
obscure affair about which nothing could be found. Friends 
and acquaintances who moved in the same social sphere as B 
claimed that there was no indication whatsoever of any senti¬ 
mental association. In any case it must have been a highly 
undemonstrative affair with a very shy Lochinvar worshipping 
from afar. Generally B kept aloof from women and his social 
life was very awkward, but it may be that through his imagin¬ 
ation he read things into his social life that had no concrete 
basis. His social immaturity is rather unusual in a Mormon 
community where great emphasis is placed upon the social de¬ 
velopment of its youth and so it could not be blamed upon lack 
of opportunity. 

In the year that B attended university a long de¬ 
veloping conflict between his father and the church over 
church doctrine on the question of plural marriage occurred. 
B's father entertained heretical views on marriage and faced 
with the alternative of recanting or being excommunicated he 
chose to leave the church. Close associates of B and his 
brother said that they took this event very keenly and brooded 
over it for several months. It probably deepened B*s feeling

Academically, B's work was more satisfactory in 
university than in high school. In November his average was 
63 with a range of 46 to 90. Failure in music at Christmas 
made him very downcast and he expressed criticism of the 
wide range of knowledge required on the course. 

In practice teaching his results were average. He 
felt that he was a complete failure but far overrated the 
critical content of his teaching reports. It is true that he 
did not have a good teaching voice. Diction was excellent 
and he spoke clearly^but with an unusual flatness and lack of 
expression. On hearing his voice played back on the wire re¬ 
corder B immediately commented on these adverse voice charact¬ 
eristics. He realized that he would have difficulty keeping 
a class’s attention unless he changed his speech considerably. 
His own self-analysis of his voice obviously disturbed him 
and he seemed to derive no satisfaction from his excellent 
diction and precise enunciation which was commented on by the 
author. 

A short time before final examinations B took a 
rather dramatic step. Without consulting anyone; oarents, 
faculty members, or even his brother, he joined the army and 
left for basic training at Montreal. In his first letter to 
the author he summed up his reasons for leaving • He said 
he now would have time to think things over and get everything

straightened out in his mind and in the meantime he would save 
his money so that after three years would be able to lead the 
kind of life that he wished to lead, 

B always claimed, and I think believed, that his 
father always allowed him to exercise his own judgment. None¬ 
theless, at this time a prominent member of his community com¬ 
mented on B*s hasty departure. He stated that he felt B would 
emerge from this experience with a semblance of the manhood 
that he had not previously had the privilege of exercising to 
the fullest extent. 

Basic training completed, B settled down to the 
humdrum monotony of peace time army life. His letters at no 
time indicated that he felt he had erred in his decision but 
he did mention that he was looking forward to being transferred 
to the leather and canvas working section of the army. 

The following fall B came home on leave. One day he 
disappeared but as he had frequently done so on previous oc¬ 
casions, no alarm was felt. It was merely surmised that he had 
gone to visit a sister at Vancouver. Several days later some 
Indian boys found B*s body on a high promontory overlooking the 
family range lease. The inquest, as far as could be ascertained, 
could not determine the cause of death other than it was some 
unknown natural cause. B had gone off to that rather isolated 
height of land alone, to think, and perhaps escape from the

reality of living. 

This act of escaping alone to the solitudes is a 
typical schizoid trait. Particularly significant is the fact 
that B did this often enough that no particular attention was 
paid to it. There is also the possibility that B f s departure to 
the army was not B exercising his manhood but rather another 
withdrawal from reality. There was definitely no indication of 
military interest prior to his sudden move and he admittedly 
used it as a place to think things over. He knew that once he 
received his teaching certificate he would have been morally 
bound to teach and to live a life that he felt inadequate to 
cope with. In his own words he hated responsibility and his 
story is one of escape from it.

CASE C 

C was almost twenty, attending the Faculty of Education, 
when the counsellor first met him. Weighing 175 pounds and stand¬ 
ing five feet ten inches tall, C had an exceptionally fine pro¬ 
fessional appearance. He was always impeccably dressed in the 
latest styles and in excellent taste. His manners were polished 
although a trifle overly respectful. This obsequiousness was 
partially due to his background and partly due to his training 
as a waiter. Voluntarily seeking out the author he occupied 
far more of the author’s time than any other member of the group. 
Frank and friendly, he discussed even the sordid parts of his 
life with candour and without embarrassment. Nonetheless, in 
retrospect, the author found G*s failure unpredictable and the 
causes highly speculative. 

C was the youngest of four children raised on a 
pioneer homestead fourteen miles from the nearest town. HiB 
father and mother were of Ukrainian extraction and were 
attempting farming under the then usual primitive conditions 
of a log and mud house and inadequate equipment. C*s 
earliest memories are of neglect and frequent parental 
quarrels which sometimes terminated in scenes of great vio¬ 
lence. As a result when C was about four years old his 
parents separated: his father to live with another woman 
and his mother to shift as best she could. Local business-

men regarded G's father as unstable, unreliable and with no 
ambition. The mother was also considered a very poor type 
of individual. As a consequence no one was surprised at the 
family breaking up and both parties were considered respon¬ 
sible. 

Completely abandoned at about the age of four, C 
was reluctantly taken in by a succession of uncles and aunts 
who were poverty stricken pioneers with large families of 
their own. Much of the time he slept on piles of sacks and 
rags and never did he at any time have more than a ragged old 
shirt and trousers for clothing. Hunger was present also and 
he rarely remembers being well fed. At school some of the 
students gave him extra lunch. Because he was an unwelcome but 
unavoidable guest he received considerable physical abuse. 

School was both a source of satisfaction and 
humiliation to him. The pupils all knew of his unfortunate 
family background and he was subjected to a great deal of 
thoughtless teasing about it. On occasions he was chased 
home with sticks and stones. Whether C actually was singled 
out for abuse could not be determined but he regarded this 
part of his career as one of persecution. On the other hand 
C was an apt student,and he soon found that he could stand 
high in the teacher’s esteem and be regarded as a superior

being if he made good marks* Scholastic achievement then be¬ 
came an instrument of compensation* Even today C mentions 
with some pride that he was the only one of his former school 
mates who got past grade eight* 

C could easily have excelled in sports* A natural 
athlete and a good ball player he used to win practically all 
the events at school track meets. His uncle would not let 
him play ball after school so he missed the admiration of his 
fellow students in inter-school ball games* 

At about this time he decided that since he was 
physically superior he would no longer tolerate the jibes and 
attacks of his school mates* For the space of a week he had 
his revenge and whipped every boy in school. The result was 
not what he anticipated, however, for the group turned on him 
en masse in a planned coup, beat him, threw him in a muddy 
slough and chased him home with sticks. Bitter and humiliated, 
he resigned himself to this unpleasant aspect of school life.-*- 
This background of mistreatment and neglect might 
have been the beginning of his paranoia factor. Investigation 
revealed that his early life was certainly not a happy one but 
no certain evidence could be obtained that this part of his life 
should have produced serious personal repercussions. The 


C*s tales of physical abuse were numerous and lurid. If 
they were true his childhood was most unhappy. His paranoia 
factor, which is discussed later, may have led him to colour 
and exaggerate incidents in his life.

Rorschach, M.M.P.I. and C®s own actions and admissions gave 
evidence of paranoia* 

When C was in grade six his mother took him and his 
brother with her to Edmonton. Why she took them is not clear 
and C could offer no explanation. Their accommodation consis¬ 
ted of a one room shack with an earthen, windowless basement. 

C shortly came to realize that his mother was a nymphomaniac s 
and he now speaks contemptuously of her. He described how he 
and his brother were sent down to the basement while his mother 
s^ent a night of debauchery with a negro roustabout. Apparently 
such incidents were frequent with the boys sitting them out in 
the dark basement. Finally the law intervened and the mother 
s;^ent a year in jail and was barred from the city for an¬ 
other year. During this E<$nonton period, life was a hardship. 
Underfed, C and his brother lived on turnips for periods of 
time. C speaks of this part of life quite casually, but since 
this is the time in which he came to hate his mother the 
casualness is probably a pose. 

C was sent back to his uncle on the farm where he 
resumed his country schooling. Upon graduating from the local 
school his uncle refused to send him any further, so he made 
arrangement to attend the divisional high school and stay in 
the dormitory. By working in the summer he managed to buy his 
first and only suit of clothes. During the school year he

worked nights as front man in a garage and managed to pay his 
hoard and increase his wardrobe. 

An intense preoccupation with clothes is mentioned 
by C. ?/hlle attending country schools he wore cast off clothing 
and was admittedly the poorest dressed boy in the school. At 
no time did he ever have more than one pair of ragged pants and 
a shirt# Later on, good clothes gave him a feeling of security; 
of belonging to the group. 

At the end of two years he had finished his grade 
eleven with a very fine scholastic record and planned on taking 
his grade twelve. While in the city he accidentally met his 
mother on the street. At that time she was living with a miner 
as his common-law-wif© and now had children from this union. 

Since she had a home she persuaded C to come and live with her 
while he completed his schooling. Despite the fact that 0 
stated that the sight of his parents filled him with shame and 
contempt he accepted the invitation. His reason for acceptance 
was not therefore clear,but at other times he expressed the 
desire to go some place where no one would know his social back¬ 
ground, It was probable he thought that the anonymity of the city 
life offered him social protection denied him in the local high 
school where his family history was well known. 

For a time he attended one of the large city high 
schools,but at Christmas time he changed to a separate high 
school. The reasons given for this transfer were vague but

the family was Greek Catholic and the move may have been 
necessary* He now took on additional courses and changed 
others so that he was taking forty credits instead of his 
previous twenty. French 3, physics, chemistry and trigo¬ 
nometry were the courses that he took for only half a year. 
Despite that, his final marks with the exception of -English 
were good. The marks are as folloi^s: English 42, social 
studies 79, French 2 H, French 3 60, algebra 81, physics 91, 
chemistry 85 and trigonometry 80. Because of departmental 
regulations French 3 was disallowed. Certainly it was a 
commendable year quite in keeping with his V.G.C, I.Q. of 
118 and his Wechsler-Bellvue I.Q. of 125. 

C had the ability of intelligent self-appraisal 
in some fields,* He stated that he realized that he had ser¬ 
ious social deficiencies and as soon as he had accumulated a 
satisfactory wardrobe he commenced taking dancing lessons. 
Being naturally athletic he became a graceful and accomplished 
dancer. C attended the graduation ball and the author close¬ 
ly observed his actions. His dancing was above average and 
his general conduct and manners showed a maturity beyond his 
years. 

No coherent reason was advanced by C for selecting 
teaching as a nrofession, although he maintained that he liked 
^eoole and children. The major reason, however, was that his 


failure in English barred his acceptance by any other faculty

and he had his mind set on acquiring the prestige of a higher 
education. In a letter written the following year he mentioned 
that he could not tolerate rough working clothes and neither 
could he reconcile himself to an ordinary white collar position. 

His Kuder Preference Record gives some information. 

On this test a percentile reading should he eighty before it 
is significant. The persuasive factor was 95 and the social 
service factor was 95. Nothing else exceeded 52 and so it 
appears that the social field was the one in which he should 
make his choice and with respect to circumstances, teaching 
seemed a sensible selection. 

Going into his first year he seemed to be faced with 
a reasonably easy task. A young man of high intelligence who 
had demonstrated unusual self-reliance, maturity and ability, 
should surely experience no difficulty in getting his teach¬ 
ing diploma. Yet it is precisely at this point that C be¬ 
gan to waver and eventually failed decisively. 

During the summer prior to his commencement of 
university, C procured a job as waiter on a railway dining 
car and made considerable money. Much of this was spent 
on outfitting himself with new clothes. 

G was immediately in academic difficulties. His 
first marks were; reading and language 35, psychology 24, 


English 40, music 80, administration 35, and health 43. He

frankly admitted that in contrast to his previous year he 
wasn't studying. The rest of the year was spent fruitlessly 
by the author in an effort to ascertain and eliminate the 
cause of C's decline. 

C had been persuaded into taking an accounting 
course from the Chicago Vocational School and during his 
university year he scent three hours a day on it. His reasons 
for doing so were most illogical. He would justify the taking 
of the course by saying that it would be useful some day, 
yet in discussions on vocations he would declare that he 
could not tolerate an office job^. Both a Lee-Thorpe and 
Kuder T 0 st showed a very low interest in clerical and bus¬ 
iness work. When it was intimated that he was using it as 
an escape from his other work he denied it. Later on evidence 
seemed to indicate that this theory of him using the course 
to evade the immediate problem was true. 

F r om this time his ability to make sound logical 
judgments seemed to deteriorate. He would constantly seek 
out the author to discuss his inability to study, yet after 
laying plans he would make no attempt to implement them. For 


1 Since this tune C has held at least seven office jobs that 
the author knows of. He stayed in no position longer than 
four months. Lack of prestige and pay were given as reasons 
for his change. G is back in the city and still phones the 
author at intervals.

example he keot repeating that the presence of his mother 
and the illegitimate children, emotionally disturbed him 
and that he would have to move. Arrangements were made 
for him to go to new lodgings, but when the time came to 
do so he did nothing. Later he pleaded lack of friends. 

His own church agreed to take him in at a university 
boarding house but when the time came to move he said that 
the boys were a silly group and would disturb his studies. 

It is probable that C was emotionally unbalanced. 
The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory indicated 
paranoia, schizophrenia and psychasthenia. He certainly 
displayed and admitted paranoia; the world and individuals 
were working against him. His rapidly developing inability 
to face reality and his illogical talk substantiated his 
schizophrenia. At this point one of the graduate students 
in psychology agreed to give C a Rorschach Ink Blot Test. 

G missed three appointments, giving vague reasons for doing 
so, but finally took it. Apparently C was responsive to 
the test and talked a great deal. The written material was 
discussed with Dr. X who diagnosed it as showing both 
schizophrenia and paranoia. In addition D r . X thought 
that homo-sexual tendencies were oresent. Neither Dr. X 
nor the psychologist were in any way acquainted with the 
case rrior to testing and without elaboration it can be

stated that their deductions concerning G*s past history were 
remarkably accurate. 

Practice teaching results were borderline. 0 was 
required to teach another lesson to determine if he would 
pass his practice teaching and the author was asked to attend. 
While there was an occasional hesitation in delivery both 
author and Professor H agreed that 0 had done a creditable 
job. 

Professor H related an interesting anecdote con¬ 
cerning C. The class was required to make two speeches. 

When O’s turn cane he attempted humour of the pathetic 
children type which only succeeded in making everyone un¬ 
comfortable. His second speech was defaulted again and 
again because of no preparation and finally the author gave 
considerable help. This inability to meet deadlines and 
hand in assignments became more and more pronounced as the 
year went on. 

Pinal examination results were catastrophic, with 
C dismally failing eight out of the ten subjects. Immediately 
upon receiving the results, and several times since, he has 
come to the author*s house for advice, but after deciding on 
a course of action he would evade the issue. Psychiatry seemed 
to be c*s great need.

after his failure he said that he was investigating various 
religions and the following Sunday he was going to hear 
"It's Later Than You Think 11 * This is interesting because 
of its schizophrenic implications. To date he has done 
nothing decisive but still talks vaguely about becoming a 
preacher for some as yet undecided religion. 

His first post-university position was working 
as accountant in a small business. He intensely disliked 
the position but disliked even more the idea of manual 
labour. He voluntarily mentioned that since leaving un¬ 
iversity he has never touched his accounting course al¬ 
though it would be useful to him. He could not explain 
why he spent so much time at it while he attended univer¬ 
sity, and now had ceased to take an interest in it. The 
first surmise that he was using it as an escape was pro¬ 
bably correct. 

During the next year his employment record told 
of going from one accounting job to another. In all these 
jobs he expressed the feeling that he was an underpaid and 
despised employee. Finally f, to get away from it all" he 
left for the east where he thought he might continue his 
education. On this occasion he was obviously in distress. 
He was tense* and over controlled, and his conversation was 
rambling.

Periodically he kept in contact with the author. 

A year ago he wrote from a protestant college in Winnipeg 
where again he failed. B a ck in Edmonton and working as an 
accountant for an oil firm he was dissatisfied and called 
for advice. It was the same old story of inferior status 
and low pay. More recently a phone call informed the author 
that he had decided to join the army and become an officer. 
It is almost certain that C will not be able to tolerate the 
inferior status of a private long enough to secure a pro¬ 
motion.^ 

C‘s case was a tragic one. The adverse environ¬ 
mental factors that had initially challenged him into such 
intelligent response finally proved too much for him in 
his adolescence. At present completely incapable of ob¬ 
jective analysis he is living a life of anxiety and frus¬ 
tration. 


1 


The most recent investigation reveals that C rejected the 
army as a career. At present he is married and still going 
from one accounting position to another.

CASE D 

D entered the F a culty of Education and enrolled in 
the four year course leading to a B. Ed. Degree. B e ing a 
young man of high intelligence and tremendous energy, coming 
from a fine home and having a superior educational background, 
he gave every promise of teaching success. Despite this he 
had other personality and physical factors that influenced 
his decision to transfer to another faculty. 

D had an unusual and thoroughly diversified back- 
gound. His father had been sent as a missionary to Mada¬ 
gascar, and it was there that D was born, the youngest of a 
family of three boys and one girl. Here until the age of 
sixteen, he was reared in a cosmopolitan community of 
natives and Europeans. 

Local life was colorful and varied. Crocodile 
hunting with the natives was one of the experiences about 
which he reminisced. The frequent visits of the French 
Navy left a deep mark on his memory. The pageantry that 
surrounded naval officers in colonial territory was im¬ 
pressive, and D®s romantic imagination was stirred with the 
glamour of it. One of his ambitions was to become a naval 
officer. 

D evidently had some linguistic ability. While 
in Madagascar he became fluent in oral F r ench and mastered

sufficiently, several native dialects for ordinary conver¬ 
sation, Since returning to Canada he has acquired a pass¬ 
able knowledge of Norwegian, 

The family itself was described by a Canadian 
high school principal as close-knit, self-sufficient and 
talented. On a rating scale he place them at the top for 
family solidarity and close to the top for home atmosphere 
and community prestige* Family talent manifested itself in 
painting, writing, reading and in the collection of curios. 

D took early education, including the first part 
of high school, in Madagascar* The schools were American 
with American teachers and he claimed the instructors were 
very biased and anti-British in their views, D was a 
Canadian with British sympathies, and this combined with 
his independence of mind, caused trouble. Being very fond 
of history and social studies, which were his best subjects, 
he soon discovered that history books themselves did not 
agree. The quoting of reputable but contrary opinion be¬ 
came His delight and on several occasions he was expelled 
from class. No doubt there were other sources of teacher- 
pupil tension. A school principal in Canada stated that D 
was actually ill at ease but made an excellent job of com¬ 
pensation by aggressiveness. 

The transition to Alberta schools was made without 
difficulty. He said that he was pleasantly surprised at

the lack of indoctrination and at the freedom of discussion 
in social studies. He commented that this was the first 
time in his life that his teachers had not attempted to 
impose their opinions upon him. 

As rated by his principal, D was above average 
in popularity and in behaviour. In his attitude toward 
school he had the high rating of two on the seven point 
scale. No evidence of extra-curricular activities could 
be found but there was good reason for this as the family 
finances necessitated hard work by all its members, and 
there was little leisure time. Under the heading of 
11 Activities” on the questionnaire his principal tersely 
noted "arguing". 

In spite of an active dislike for mathematics 
and science D secured an average of 69$ on his Grade XII 
subjects. 

D says that it never occurred to his brother 
and sister or him that they would do anything but go to 
university when they completed high school. In his ques¬ 
tionnaire he placed his vocational choices in the follow¬ 
ing order: teaching, law, naval career. The Lee-Thorpe 
Occupational Interest Inventory which gave him a percentile 
rating of ninety-nine in the personal-social and verbal 
field of interests along with low ratings in the manipu¬ 
lative and composition fields, seemed to confirm the 
wisdom of his career preferences. All other percentile

ratings were low* 

The wire recorder impressed D with the fact that 
his speech had many undesirable characteristics* The re¬ 
cording was slurred, high-pitched, rapid, semi-hysterical, 
and the words literally tumbled out without regard for en¬ 
unciation. On occasions, he made definite but only moder¬ 
ately successful attempts to control and improve his speech* 

At the end of the year it was still bad* Indeed, it was this 
defect that impelled him to change from education to law, and 
again from law to a general arts course, from which he graduated 
with a B.A. degree. 

The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 
scores deserve some comment* D*s hysteria factor was high, 

.just short of clinical importance. In contrast to this 
all other factors were low, particularly depression and 
hypochondriasis. Hysteria was indicated in D’s speech 
mannerisms and may have been basic to them. The low score 
on the depression factor was apparently valid because in 
commenting on it he mentioned that the family had been through 
some very difficult times but that he had never felt down¬ 
hearted and had always seen the cheerful side of life. 

D admittedly lived for excitement. In Madagascar 
his daring caused uneasiness in the family and there was 


apprehension as to what he would be doing next. In his

first year in C a nada he insisted on going down a senior 
ski jump and was tremendously thrilled by the experience* 
Later while working in a logging camp in the mountains 
some logger dared him to go down a long rapids considered 
almost unnavigable. He and his brother constructed a raft, 
and successfully shot the rapids. These acts were con¬ 
sidered typical by those who knew him. His evident en¬ 
joyment of risk situation may have been reflections of his 
low hypochondriatic and psychasthenic factors. 

S e lf reliance was an outstanding characteristic 
of D. At the time he was attending university his father 
was teaching in a church institution for a pittance. The 
mother and family moved to Edmonton where a university was 
available for the three children qualified to enter. As 
a consequence all the members of the family had to work to 
supplement the family income. D worked four nights a week 
as a pin setter in a bowling alley, and in addition attended 
naval reserve parades. He obviously had little time to study, 
but working under nressure did not seem to affect him. Un¬ 
doubtedly his "very superior” rating on the Wechsler-Bellvue 
I.Q. test was a valid measure of the mental ability which 
made it possible for him to successfully carry on his heavy 


programme

While attending university D proceeded to achieve 
his naval ambitions and .joined the U.N.T.D. with the intention 
of becoming a reserve officer. Despite his limited time for 
such activities he never missed a parade. Unfortunately be¬ 
tween him and the culmination of his ambition were a number 
of personal handicaps. He was short, slight, and below 
average in appearance. Hi s hair was perpetually untidy and 
his eyes were slightly bloodshot. On the parade ground he 
was both awkward and inept. He had an extraordinary knack 
of turning right when he should turn left, and his power of 
command, because of his speech, was definitely unsatisfactory. 
Accordingly, he did not impress his commanding officers as 
cadet officer material. 

Consultation with D*s U.N.T.D, officers, who were 
known by the author, revealed that although they had noted 
D f s enthusiasm they intended to reject his application for 
cadet officer training. They asked if it would be possible, 
however, to have access to the case history material accumul¬ 
ated. This was made available and discussed with them. No 
effort was made to influence the officers* D*s weaknesses 
were neither minimized, nor his strengths magnified. The 
officers were, nonetheless, impressed with hitherto unknown 
character resources of D and as a consequence he passed at 
the ensuing officer selection board.

Prior to the sitting of the selection board D came 
to the author, and held an imaginary hearing in which the 
wire recorder was used. The author from his experience in 
this field gave D what help he could. The wire recording 
was played over several times and voice pitch, speed, and 
modulation were discussed. 

A follow up has been made on D’s naval reserve 
career. He has spent two summers at the coast taking train¬ 
ing as a cadet officer. His enthusiasm had remained keen and 
his academic standing on naval courses has been exception¬ 
ally high. It was amusing to note that despite the author's 
warning that the navy was no place to argue with a superior, 

D still had to learn it the difficult way. 

Considering the handicaps that D laboured under, 
one must consider his university record as satisfactory. He 
maintained his marks at a second class standing, and with the 
exception of practice teaching he had no failures. There was 
close agreement amongst his professors on a personal rating 
scale of seven, with the number one rating being high. The 
quality of his work rated three, class response and interest 
two, maturity three, co-operativeness three, personal care 
and appearance four, and class status three. This agreed 
rather closely with the principal's questionnaire.

Case D remains basically the study of a highly aggres¬ 
sive and able young man with a sufficiently good background to 
insure a successful future. While he was probably wise in trans¬ 
ferring from education to arts, there was no prior evidence that 
his initial choice was unwise or that good guidance would have 
enabled him to choose more wisely. It was the type of unsuita¬ 
bility that emerges in the process of training. 

The consensus amongst the instructors was that his 
speech mannerism was sufficiently serious to warrant his trans¬ 
ferring from education to law. After a year in pre-law he 
transferred to an arts course. 

After graduation he contemplated other careers: the 
ministry; the navy. While the navy held a fascination for him# 
he had now enough experience with it to realize that it offered 
one with his social inclinations very few satisfactions. 
Accordingly he rejected it. The ministry for a time occupied 
his attention and he spent a year at an American Lutheran train¬ 
ing college. While far from being irreligious, D decided 
against becoming a minister, and returned to Alberta. 

D eventually consulted the Faculty of Education 
staff and resolved to try the education course again. At 
last report he was doing well and was getting second class 
standings in his practice teaching, although his speech control 


was still not good

CASE E 

From the outset E was suspicious of the project. 

He attended none of the group meetings* and consented to a 
personal interview only after a considerable period. Shortly 
thereafter he suffered a mental disturbance, and left the 
university for psychiatric observation and treatment. Be¬ 
cause of this, most of the following information had to be 
obtained indirectly from members of the faculty, from 
psychiatrists, and from his own friends, 

E*s father came to Canada from the Ukraine about 
1922, The mother, of Slavic stock, was Canadian born. The 
father died of tuberculosis when E was seven, and three 
years later the mother remarried, A maternal grandmother 
lived with the family during E*s childhood, and a paternal 
grandfather lived nearby, E described a pleasant and happy 
home life. 

E acquired from his education-hungry family a 
deep respect for education, largely, it appeared, because of 
its prestige value. Learning for him was difficult but very 
much worthwhile. He entered university with a weak matricu¬ 
lation, and in his first term, inspite of marked effort, his 
grades were marginal. 

E had rarely gone out with girls and maintained he 
had never had sexual intercourse "because it isn*t right".

Considerable interest was evinced in the topic of sex al¬ 
though emotional disturbance accompanied discussion of it* 

Sex knowledge held by E was confused and unenlightened* 

Shortly after entering university it became ap¬ 
parent to the professors that there was something unusual 
about E. His psychology professor in particular noted 
peculiarities* E frequently came into his office* and rambled 
on, generally quite confusedly, about psychology* Academ¬ 
ically his work was barely acceptable, and he was achieving 
that by a marked effort* 

The climax came when E finally responded to a 
note from the author, and came to see him in the graduate 
study room. Arriving unannounced, he proceeded to talk over 
his troubles with two other graduate students. So extra¬ 
ordinary was the conversation, that on a plausible pretext, 
an immediate interview was arranged with Dr. S who diagnosed 
E’s symptoms as schizophrenic. This diagnosis was later 
confirmed by the provincial psychiatrist* 

E*s condition did not seem incurable, and it was 
thought that a regular routine and exercise might restore him. 
Accordingly, he was sent to a lumber camp as a labourer, but 
within a short time he was sent back to the city, and confined 
in a mental institution. E had great aspirations, such as 
being a psychiatrist. Like C he wished the prestige of be-

ing an intellectual. Life in a lumber camp as a worker sub¬ 
jected to the usual jibes directed at a college boy probably 
accelerated the withdrawal tendencies. The last psychiatric 
report stated that E*s condition had deteriorated still further, 
and there seemed no prospect of a cure. 

Four psychometric tests were used; the Wechsler- 
Bellvue, the Rorschach, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
Inventory and the Thematic Apperception Test. Their results 
warrant a brief review, but much interesting material has been 
omitted. The Rorschach alone would take a disproportionate 
amount of space. 

The Wechsler-Bellvue indicated a verbal I.Q. of 99* 
a performance I.Q. of 94, and a full scale I.Q. of 96. The 
discrepancy between verbal, and performance I.Q. was within 
the normal range. Possessed of this I.Q. E must have found the 
attempt to start an academic career very frustrating. Accord¬ 
ing to the Wechsler formula there was no evidence of deter¬ 
ioration and on its whole diagnostic features the Wechsler 
test Droved valueless except as an I.Q. test. 

The Rorschach test showed E was subject to hallu¬ 
cinations; troubled by bizarre and fantastic thoughts: had 
feelings of guilt and futility; displayed some degree of re¬ 
ligious preoccupation, and used withdrawal behaviour as a 
means of evading his difficulties. The diagnosis stated that 
the case was schizophrenic with paranoid and obsessive com¬ 
plications.

The following scores were made on the M.M.P.I.; 
hypochondriasis 67, depression 58, hysteria 53, psychopathic 
deviate 59, paranoia 85, schizophrenia 101, hypomania 75 and 
introversion 65. It will he observed that the only factors 
of significance are paranoia and schizophrenia which are in 
agreement with the psychiatric report and the Rorschach test. 

The Murray Thematic Apperception Test also showed 
a paranoid schizophrenic personality• On both this and the 
Rorschach, E displayed guilt obsessions concerning sex. 

These may have had their roots in an Oedipal attachment 
formed in the period when he had no father. 

E was a very average student with a level of as¬ 
pirations beyond his capacity of realization. His person¬ 
ality defects were obvious, and it was a great tragedy that 
he was ever admitted to university life. What steps might have 


been taken will be considered later.

CASE F 

F entered the Faculty of Education as a mature young 
lady with a fine professional appearance. Despite her working 
class background, her parents had made available to her every 
cultural and educational opportunity that people of moderate 
means could provide. As a product of this background, F had 
developed into a deeply religious, highly intelligent individual 
who applied the best of her abilities to whatever tasks she under¬ 
took. Attending university on a scholarship, F took the Tem¬ 
porary License course with the intention of improving her 
professional status in the immediate future by attending summer 
school sessions. 

F was of foreign parentage. Both her father and mother 
were born in Poland, and came to this country in their twenties. 
Neither of them had progressed beyond public school, and prior to 
emigration the father was a labourer and the mother a clerk. In 
Canada the father became a worker on railway maintenance, and was 
a section foreman for a number of years. There was one other 
sibling, a girl three years younger than F. The family was 
devoutly Roman Catholic. 

F f s earliest memories were happy ones. The parents t 
chief interests in life were their children and much of the 
family life and activities were centered in the home. For 
example, each summer the family went on a carefully planned tour

which was calculated to broaden the children’s experience* 

F*s mother related two anecdotes, which partially 
illustrate the gentle and understanding atmosphere in which F 
was raised. The first tells of F carefully removing her mother*s 
flowers, roots and all; and planting them in a ditch, because she 
“wanted to see pretty flowers growing in the ditch too' 1 . On 
another occasion F picked all the small green tomatoes and planted 
them like potatoes “to get a big crop 1 ’ as she explained* F was 
not punished* The parents saw nothing but a lively imagination 
at work* 

The home life was very happy. She told of her mother 
humming merry Polish folk songs, and of her father taking her on 
his knee and’translating the comics into Polish since in her pre¬ 
school days she knew no English* In confirmation of a fine home 
life, the Sister Superior gave the highest ratings possible for 
home atmosphere and relationship between parents* 

F was old enough to start school the year the family 
moved to Lacombe* Unable to speak a word of English and not know¬ 
ing even one child, her first days at school were intensely 
unhappy and she wept a great deal* However, she became adjusted 
rapidly and within a few weeks when she had to stay home with the 
measles she cried bitterly because she could not attend* 

Because of his work on the railway F*s father had to do 
a great deal of moving around and by the time F had entered grade 
two they had moved twice. After several moves, all to hamlets.

they moved to another small community where the family still 
resides. Due to these moves F and her family never established 
deep social ties in any one community. Perhaps this lack of 
outside social life tended to make the family even more of a 
self contained social unit. 

The local school offered nothing beyond grade eight, 
so it was necessary for F to take her grade nine by correspond¬ 
ence. She missed other children very much; studying by oneself 
was lonely and difficult, but she found the work interesting. 

In June she passed with an A standing* 

That summer she went to Vancouver for a few weeks. 

It was not 'her first trip out of the province since she had 
previously holidayed twice at Banff and once each at Regina, 
Saskatoon, Moose Jaw and Winnipeg. F describes with lively in- 
terest the mountains, orchards, misty Vancouver, Stanley Park, 
Lions 1 Gate Bridge and other well known tourist attractions. 

The following year F took her grade ten at a city 
convent. At first she was homesick but soon struck up friend¬ 
ships with the other girls and the Sisters. It was a successful 
school year, with her making six H standings and two A standings 
in her academic subjects. In addition she made 94? in the grade 
one theory examination of the Toronto Conservatory of Music, and 
93? in a French test sponsored by L*Association Canadienne- 


Francaise de l 1 Alberta,

The following summer the family went out to Agassiz, 
B*C., to Chilliwack, to the Harrison Hot Springs and into the 
orchard and hop country* 

In grade eleven F had her first introduction to 
dramatics* Selected as the leading character, the queen, she 
found it exciting to take part in a play and live the life of 
another person* The play was a success, and F was greatly 
impressed with drama* From that time on, F took a lively in¬ 
terest in the stage* Whenever possible, she attended plays and 
participated in them* 

Academically grade eleven was another very fine year* 
Once again she made six H*s and two A l s, On the grade two 
theory and grade six piano playing examinations of the Toronto 
Conservatory of Music she made 95$ and 76$ respectively* In the 
grade five French test conducted by the L«A.C*A. she made 80$* 

Holidays that year were spent by the family on a tour 
of the eastern U*S*A* New York City in particular attracted 
her, and she spoke of the Empire State Building, St, Patricks 
Cathedral, the Statue of Liberty, Chinatown, Greenwich Village 
and many other tourist attractions * On the return trip they 
took time off to visit in Montreal, Ottawa, Fort William, 
Sudbury, Winnipeg and other Canadian cities* Judging from F l s 
account the family had an intelligently planned itinerary, 
calculated to give them something worthwhile out of the tour* 
Perhaps F was overly conscious of the educational value of these

summer trips* Her accounts always sounded more like a travel 
folder recital than a holiday story. Almost all of her 
observations were of a landmark nature, and few dealt with 
people and life in other places. 

Grade twelve was a year of hard study according to 
F. Originally, she had planned to take her grade twelve in 
one year, but her age of sixteen was a determining factor in 
her taking two years. She was too young to apply for a scholar¬ 
ship, so it was decided that she would take two years and 
enrich her course with more music instruction and extra¬ 
curricular activities. At the end of the year she had an 
average of 73$ on four grade twelve subjects, and had done well 
in music and other activities. 

Vancouver Island was selected for the family holiday 
that year. F visited the beautiful legislative buildings and 
grounds. Beacon Hill Park, the Sunken Gardens and the Empress 
Hotel. She also had her first ship ride on the Princess 
Kathleen which had been a troop carrier in World War 2. 

In her second year of grade twelve F had an average 
of 88$ on three examination subjects, and also did well in 
French and music. 

F participated extensively in extra-curricular 
activities, without, according to her principal, detriment to 
her studies. 

In addition to being president of a religious club, F

was president of the Music Club, a member of the Students* 
Council, editor of the school paper, a handicraft worker and 
a member of the Dominion, Provincial Health and Recreation 
Class, She enthusiastically participated and co-operated in 
all these activities, whether in or out of office. 

The holidays that year were spent in the eastern 
U,3.A. and at Niagara Falls, Toronto, Hamilton and other 
eastern cities, F spoke with great interest of the Niagara 
Falls and the Welland Canal, 

F had always wanted to teach. It was her first and 
only ambition. The Sister Superior related how F was frequent¬ 
ly found assisting students of more junior grades with their 
studies. The two hundred dollar scholarship, and acceptance 
into the Faculty of Education were spoken of as highlights in 
her life surpassed only by her actual graduation. Her 
vocational choice was partially substantiated by the Lee 
Thorpe Occupational Inventory, In interest fields her per¬ 
centile ranks were: personal-social 70, natural science 70, 
mechanical 20, business 1, artistic 90 and science 50. While 
the personal-social score was not as high as might be expected, 
it and the artistic were certainly the highest. 

F ! s career at university was in keeping with her 
previous achievements. She became rapidly adjusted to university 
life and encountered no serious problems. Faculty members were

in agreement in grading F very high in attitude, quality 
of work, class status and appearance* Her Wechsler-Bellvue 
I.Q* test rated her as “very superior H and this combined 
with sound organization, interest and conscientiousness pro¬ 
duced high academic results* In the spring she graduated with 
first class honours. During the year F was nonconnnital 
concerning the teacher training programme, and it was not until 
she had taught for a year that she expressed an opinion on the 
subject. On one occasion during practice teaching her very 
carefully planned work had been rewarded by some sharp and 
unflattering criticism* Very despondent over what she con¬ 
sidered a failure in her first real test as a teacher, F came 
in tears to the author* Investigation revealed that this 
particular supervising teacher was noted for her vigorous 
criticism. The author, after talking to faculty members, was 
able to reassure F that nothing was seriously wrong. F and 
the author planned the remainder of the week*s work together 
and she came back from her teaching with renewed confidence 
and enthusiasm. 

Religious influences in F*s life were worth noting* 
Her previous principal, a Sister, rated the family very high 
in the scale on their religious interests. Raised in a 
devout family and devout herself, she felt that religious 
guidance transcended everything in her life* In a letter to

the author she said "and in this time I have had a great 
deal to do with the Church and religion. My religion has 
been the inspiration to all my hopes, ambitions and desires. 

Life would be empty without it.,,, there would be nothing to 
strive for"• Again in a letter written to the author after 
a year*s teaching she compared her professional career and 
life to an airplane flight and said in part "But this I do 
know, I shall have to make a statement of my flight, the good 
or evil I have spread. Yes, I will have to draw up my account 
the last time I land. I hope I can make a good account and 
have everlasting bliss rather than despair". It is fortunate 
for F that the compulsions of religious conviction took her 
into a profession from which she derived great satisfaction. 

Socially F had some handicaps to overcome. She said 
that her social activities had been rather limited because 
she had attended a convent between the ages of fourteen and 
nineteen. The Sister Superior was unable to give any inform¬ 
ation on her social poise and adjustment other than rating her 
high in popularity with her fellow students. To the author F 
appeared a trifle shy, very serious, and in need of normal 
social life. She was, however, aware of this, and stated that 
now that she had time and opportunity she would participate more 
actively socially. 

The only psychometric test taken by her other than 


the Lee-Thorpe and Wechsler-Bellvue was the M.M.P.I. All

factors were contained within the T score range of forty- 
three to fifty-six. If the test was valid, it showed a 
well balanced personality remarkably free from tensions. 

F was thrilled by her first year’s teaching. She 
tried to be the pupils* friend and counsellor, and played 
and associated a great deal with them. Her school super¬ 
intendent reported that her teaching was considerably above 
average for a first year teacher. So enthused was F with 
teaching that she cancelled an extensive holiday tour, and 
enrolled for summer school with the intention of acquiring a 
degree. 

In a review of her training made one year after 
graduation, F stated that the year*s interval gave her a 
different perspective and the things she would have criticized 
a year ago no longer seemed important. After one year*s teach¬ 
ing F felt that the greatest weakness in her teacher training 
had been the lack of instruction in organizing and conducting 
an ungraded school. A secondary criticism was that some of 
the courses were overloaded with detail and too much emphasis 
was placed on what to teach rather than on how to teach. 

In review it would seem that from the beginning F 
was a promising candidate for the teaching profession, and that 
at the end of a year’s teaching she had fulfilled that promise. 
Possessing a well balanced personality, and with high character.

intelligence and administrative ability, she was making a 
contribution to the teaching profession. It was also well 
to note that in her case the Faculty of Educations 
appraisal concurred with that of her superintendent* 

F had from the start of the project expressed the 
desire to obtain higher qualifications and eventually a 
degree. Subsequent to her graduation she has taken six 
courses; the maximum number possible. Of these six courses, 
four have been honour standing and no mark was below severity. 
Her academic record shows the same interest and application 
that was displayed in high school and during teacher training*

CASE G 


This young man of twenty years entered the 
Faculty of Education for the Temporary License programme 
and completed it successfully # His ability was good, his 
interest and effort only average. Though he wanted to be 
popular and socially at ease, he suffered somewhat from a 
sense of social incompetence. In the course of our inter¬ 
views G made several commendable suggestions about the teacher 
training programme. Chief among these were suggestions con¬ 
cerning the teaching of English, and language, and the use 
of films for the teaching of methods® 

G was born on a farm in southern Alberta, the son 
of an English father and an Esthonian mother. He had one 
brother seven years older and a sister three years older. 

These siblings had only brief schoolings, the sister marrying 
young and the brother going into service station work. The 
parents too had not gone beyond the elementary school. The 
mother was for some years handicapped by poor vision, deaf¬ 
ness, and rheumatism. The father was active, perhaps hyper¬ 
active, high strung, and a would-be-leader. He suffered from 
stomach ulcers. 

Aside from the fact that they were occupied in 
farming not too much is known about the family activities in 
the south of Alberta. In 1930 the family moved to the hamlet 
of R and the father, a World War I veteran, took out a farm

under the Veterans* Land Act. The depression was on and the 
family experienced great hardships. G was raised in this 
period and remembers the privations and humiliations of being 
on relief. Judging from his reactions in reminiscing it 
would appear that this period had injured his self-respect 
and pride. This period may also have contributed to his 
sense of social inadequacy. 

G*s father had quite a significant influence on 
G*3 life. The father never was very successful in any of his 
ventures and tried to compensate for his failures by being 
social minded, the life of the party, and a constant office 
seeker. At the time of writing he was a councillor of nine 
years standing and a school trustee of three. 

At the outbreak of World War II, the father tried to 
solve a strained domestic and economic situation by enlisting. 
His war service was confined, to Canada and he was discharged 
after a short enlistment. Family relationships after that 
were complicated still further by unusual behavior on his part. 
The oldest son, twenty-five years of age, married; five 
months after the wedding he and his wife separated. Two 
months later G*s father went to live with his daughter-in-law. 

G sided with his mother on this issue but thought "everything 
will turn out all right". In the past few years G*s family 
has successfully adjusted its financial difficulties.

The questionnaire sent out to principals and 
corroborated by other sources threw some important light 
on G and his family. In family prestige and participation 
in community enterprises, the father rated below average 
despite his office holding. Home atmosphere and relation¬ 
ship between parents also rated below average. This infor¬ 
mation contradicted G who stated that prior to his father’s 
desertion the home was a fine family unit with everything 
going smoothly. This may have been face saving or prestige 
bolstering because in one of the questionnaires G listed his 
father’s occupation as ’’councillor’’ instead of ’’farmer”. In 
his autobiography G also made much of his father’s positions 
of councillor and trustee. All evidence seemed to show tbat 
G lacked a feeling of social assurance and recognition, and 
the consequent syndrome may be the cause of much of his 
behaviour. 

G started school when he was five years old and 
completed grad© three and four in one year. Although G fell 
into the ’’very superior” category in the Wechaler-Bellvue I.Q. 
test it was in the lower section. The effect of this pro¬ 
motion may have been unfortunate since from that time G’s 
high scholastic ambitions vanished and even at university he 
admitted that he only did sufficient studying to pass. His 
general attitude was rated low by his previous principal and 
high by faculty members.

G claimed that he was a "sissy" and disliked 
one school that he attended because there was occasional 
fighting. Highly competitive sport did not interest him, 
but he was very fond of skating, curling, skiing and 
hunting. These sport interests might easily be due to his 
starting school at five years of age and skipping a grade. 
This placed him with a group of boys with whom he was 
physically unable to cope, and this inability to hold his 
own in play and competitive sports possibly further increased 
his uneasiness in his social group. 

In high school where he spent four years, he liked 
English least and mathematics and science most. His math¬ 
ematics marks did not indicate any marked ability in 
mathematics and his Iowa Placement Examinations for math¬ 
ematical aptitude placed him only in the forty-third percent¬ 
ile, He never completed his scientific aptitude test. His 
grade twelve marks were as follows: English 62, social 
studies 60, algebra 74, trigonometry and geometry 52, biology 
66, chemistry 56 and French 71, 

Group extra-curricular activities of G included 
editing the school paper, sitting on the students* council, 
and serving on the executive of Teen Town. His personal 
hobbies were stamp and match folder collecting. A keen 
interest was also taken in social activities although his 
principal rated him below average in popularity with fellow

students and below average in conduct in the community. 

He was rated very low in social adjustment particularly at 
dances and socials. It is to be observed that fundamentally 
G*s sports and hobbies were "lone wolf" activities, and 
were probably further evidence of his feeling of social in¬ 
feriority. G stated that his family has never taken much 
interest in church affairs and admitted that he has seldom 
been to church. Religious problems were not very significant 
to him. 

G had determined on either teaching or law as a 
career. A teacher*s bursary was a deciding factor in 
rejecting law. He did, however, list a number of other 
reasons for selecting teaching as a profession. He con¬ 
sidered that teaching in the future would offer social 
prestige, economic security, freedom from routine work, and 
possibilities for advancement. His school principal was 
consulted before making the final decision. On G*s Lee-Thorpe 
Occupational Interest Inventory his percentile ranks were: 
personal-social 80, natural science 20, mechanical 20, 
business 90, artistic 40, and science 10. In types of in¬ 
terests his percentile ranks were: verbal 90, manipulative 80, 
composition 90. There was, therefore, no psychometric 
evidence that his choice was unwise, and the follow up survey 
seemed to confirm! the wisdom of his choice. On the Minnesota

Miltiphasic Personality Inventory only the hypomania and 
the feminity factor scores were above average. In all 
probability these scores gave an accurate picture of a 
reasonably normal young man. 

G enjoyed university and took average marks, but 
did only sufficient work to get through. By the end of the 
year he had firmly decided to stay with teaching and work 
toward a degree. At university G seemed to feel that he had 
a large number of friends, but the consensus was that he had 
few intimate friends. For recreation G took part in folk 
dancing, social activities, skating and skiing. His pro¬ 
fessors rated him high in the quality of work, class response, 
interest, maturity, co-operativeness, personal care and 
appearance. He was scored average on his class status. 

At the end of a year’s teaching G rated himself 
very high insofar as the enjoyment of teaching was concerned. 
If he had money and free choice of professions he would still 
take up teaching. G’s superintendent stated that G was above 
average in teaching ability but below average at getting along 
in the community. 

When G’s activities were last investigated it was 
found that he had returned to university, and was completing 
the fourth year for his degree with excellent possibilities 
of success. At the same time he was looking forward eagerly 
to the greater opportunities that a degree would afford him.

G*s case was that of a personable young man of 
high intelligence who thoroughly enjoyed teaching and made 
a success of it. His apparent weakness was lack of social 
poise, with a consequent failure in public relations. 
Experience and education may give him better social balance, 
or as time goes on and he moves into larger urban centres 
his deficiency may not be so significants

CASE H 


H was an enthusiastic and energetic young man 
who came to the Faculty of Education to acquire his 
Temporary License as a first step towards a degree in 
education. His background was uncultured and his academic 
interests and achievement average. The parents, with a 
public school background of education, came to Canada from 
the U.S.A., and continued the family occupation of farming 
on a Canadian homestead. The mother was Swedish, the father 
Danish, and there was one other sibling, a brother four years 
old. 

The district in which he was reared was a frontier 
one in which the pioneers eked out a living by agriculture 
and some lumbering. In H { s early years lumbering was 
carried on very close to his home and life was rough and prim¬ 
itive. Community activities with the exceptions of the 
occasional dance and ball game were non-existent. As in many 
other pioneer settlements, cultural pursuits were few, and 
there was a lack of social activities in which young people 
could participate. 

The family itself was a socially sound and self« 
reliant unit with the father and mother working well together. 
Through hard work and careful planning the family had reached 
the point of moderate economic security. Hospitable, as most

Scandinavians are, they played a normal and respected part 
in community life. 

About the only expressive opportunity that H had 
in school was being monitor; a task frequently assigned to 
him and thoroughly enjoyed. This task involved correcting 
and supervising the work of junior grades. A prime cause in 
his selection of teaching as a profession was the enjoyment 
he derived from monitoring. 

School was on the whole a pleasant experience for 
H, Teachers at the local school were not always competent, 
but they did not make school distasteful* H showed "superior" 
intelligence on the Wechsler-Bellvue I,Q, test, and with 
only average diligence made fair to good grades. H passed 
grade nine with an "A” standing. His high school training was 
taken in a small and uninspiring school with no extra¬ 
curricular activities of any kind. H made an observation on 
the lack of these and said that he felt that because of it 
there was a deficiency in his education* He took four years 
to acquire his senior diploma, graduating with the following 
marks: English 66, social studies 66, algebra 56 , biology 62, 
chemistry 6?j and physics 44* 

After leaving high school he decided to take a 
year off to earn some money and to decide on a career. Accord¬ 
ingly he took a position with a lumber firm in Vancouver and 
worked a year. While he did not find business life unpleasant

he felt that teaching would offer him more reward in 
personal satisfaction. His Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest 
Inventory revealed the following percentile ranks: personal- 
social 80, natural science 30, mechanics 1, business 90, 
artistic 10, and science 80. In types of interests he got 
90 on verbal, 40 on manipulative and 99 on composition. The 
inventory, then, indicated teaching was a good choice of a 
professional field for H to enter, and it was interesting to 
observe that after one year of teaching H was highly en¬ 
thusiastic about his career. H claimed in a later survey that 
no matter how much money he had had for educational purposes 
he would still have selected teaching. 

H was much interested in planning his degree pattern 
and took a number of tests besides the Lee-Thorpe and Wechsler- 
Bellvue already mentioned. On the Iowa Placement Examinations 
Mathematics Aptitude Test he placed in the fifty-second 
percentile and on the Iowa Chemistry Aptitude Test he placed 
in the eighty-fourth percentile. The Stanford Scientific Test 
placed him a little above average. G was told to explore the 
field of English and social studies before making his final 
decision since he had made such a high score on his composition 
interest in the Lee-Thorpe. It may be that incompetent 
teaching had turned him against English and social studies 
although his marks in high school were a little better in these

subjects than in the others. A quite normal personality 
was indicated by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
Inventory# 

While the counsellor found H eagerly co-operative, 
looking forward to teaching, and apparently enjoying practice 
teaching, the consensus amongst faculty members was not 
flattering. A rating of four on a scale of seven was the 
general agreement as to H's standing in six categories: 
quality of work, class response and interest, maturity, co¬ 
operation, personal care and appearance, and class status# 

H spoke very rapidly and had a tendency toward 
slurred speech. Wire recordings of his delivery interested 
him greatly and he discussed at length means of improvement. 
First efforts at correction resulted in a rather stilted per¬ 
formance, but by the end of the year his speech, when he 
consciously directed it, was much improved# 

H felt that he was a little shy, particularly with 
girls. Upon being advised to take up folk and social dancing 
he did so, and after a short time reported that he felt much 
more at ease socially than he had before. Attending movies 
and bowling were his other chief recreational activities# 

H was interviewed three times subsequent to his 
graduation,and he still maintained his ebullient enthusiasm 
for teaching. He had a difficult school, grades one to nine^

but his superintendent reported that H was doing better 
than one would expect of an inexperienced teacher. Social¬ 
ly he was getting along well in his community. In H's final 
questionnaire he listed a number of views on teaching which 
indicated professional thought and interest. 

Since acquiring his Temporary License, H has worked 
as rapidly as possible towards improved certification. In the 
last three years he has taken and passed six subjects offered 
by the University of Alberta in summer sessions. He has also 
completed two courses offered by Queen's University. Six of 
these passes are, however, thirds - an academic record rather 
similar to that achieved in high school. 

H's case was that of an average young man of sound 
judgment who apparently selected a life work in which he found 
great satisfaction. Not the studious type, he merely applied 
himself sufficiently to meet minimum academic standards. How¬ 
ever, his energy and enthusiasm for teaching carried him far; 
qualities which are perhaps too much ignored.

CASE Z 

Z was a personable and intelligent young lady who 
enrolled in the Faculty of Education to acquire the Temporary 
License. Although handicapped by an uninspiring home and 
community background she evidenced no serious effects from 
them, and completed her year at university in a satisfactory 
manner. She had no professional aspirations beyond acquiring 
her permanent certificate. 

Both of Z f s parents were Ukrainian from the 
Ukrainian portion of pre-war Poland. Upon coming to this 
country the father took up farming and the mother did house¬ 
work. They were married a number of years after their arrival 
in Canada. Possessed of only a smattering of Polish elementary 
education, the parents had been quite successful in adapting 
themselves to an alien culture. Most of their Canadian farming 
had been done in a community of mixed race, predominantly 
Anglo-Saxon. The only other sibling was an invalid brother. 

Special note must be taken of this younger brother. 
Beset by both physical and mental ill health he was the 
object of deep concern to his family. Z was very attached to 
her brother and spent a good deal of time looking after his 
needs and anxiously watching for improvement. 

Home life was rated by z herself as being "fairly 
good" and her attitude toward her father as "favourable". She

spoke of an intimate relationship with her mother* The 
cultural background of the family was rather meagre and that 
of the community below average, particularly in church and 
community activities. The family was devoutly Catholic and 
attended church whenever the irregular local services were 
held* Family prayers were frequently held* 

. Similar to many Europeans,Z and her family had a 
great respect for education and school teachers. The first 
day at school was an event of importance in Z’s life, and she 
continued to enjoy school life, most of which was spent in 
ungraded schools. She finished her grade nine in a one room 
school and took an “A” standing. Following this she attended 
a one room high school in a humdrum hamlet a few miles from 
her home. Her graduating marks in four subjects were: 

English 70 , social studies 77 , chemistry 68 , and physics 56 * 

Z was popular with students and staff. Large, good 
looking, and energetic, she had a friendly smile for everyone. 
There had been no extra-curricular activities around the 
school or community for her to participate in, so other than 
softball and skating there was no record of group or hobby 
activity. She had, however, always liked people and had 
decided to go in for nursing or teaching. Having the oppor¬ 
tunity of receiving both a Department of Education and a 
school division scholarship, she elected to take teacher

training. 

The wisdom of her choice seemed substantiated. 

On the Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest Inventory Z made 
the following percentile scores: personal-social 90, 
natural science 40, business 30, artistic 40 and science 40. 

In types of interests Z made 90 on verbal, 50 on manipulative 
and 30 on composition. Insofar as the Lee-Thorpe test was 
concerned Z should select a vocation in the personal-social 
field requiring verbal activities. After a year of teaching 
Z had both answered a questionnaire and was personally 
interviewed. She rated herself high on enjoyment of teaching, 
and stated that she would still select teaching no matter 
what her economic circumstances were. 

Emotionally Z seemed very stable. Possessed of a 
cheerful buoyant disposition, she had a well balanced zest 
for living. On the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
Inventory each personality factor with the exception of hypo¬ 
chondriasis was within the T score range of forty-five to 
fifty-three. Hypochondriasis was seventy-six, and there was 
reason to suppose that the hypochondriasis score was not 
valid in her case. Preoccupation over a long number of years 
about her brother>s health may have given her a sensitiveness 
to health questions which was not a result of personal concern. 

Z enjoyed university life, and experienced no 
academic difficulties. Her work was above average, and she

was a conscientious worker* At first,university routine 
and its impersonal atmosphere puzzled her, but she soon 
became oriented. In the extra-curricular field she took part 
in folk dancing, and was a member of the Newman Club. The 
summation of faculty opinion rated Z high in quality of work, 
personal appearance and co-operativeness; above average in 
class response, status and maturity* 

Teaching in the one room, eight-grade school in 
which she found herself, presented some difficulties. She no 
longer had time to teach all the classes in the long, care¬ 
fully prepared lesson style taught her at university. There 
were few reference books and no materials for enterprise work, 
and the working out of an enterprise under these conditions 
constituted a real problem* Had there been more films on 
teaching in Alberta rural schools, Z thought it would have 
given her something objective as a guide. It seemed to her 
that the teaching methodology and its organization had been 
weighted in favour of the graded school. She adapted herself 
so well, however, that her superintendent was able to report 
that she had a natural aptitude for teaching, was above 
average in her work, and was very popular with her students* 
Z*s case was the apparently uncomplicated story of 
a well balanced and personable young lady. Possessed of good 
intelligence and abundant energy, she selected a profession in 
which she achieved personal satisfaction and at the same time

rendered full value in service, 

Z has attended three summer school sessions since 
her graduation and successfully completed six courses in 
which she achieved four second class standings and two thirds. 
This is what one might have expected from her high school 
record. From a professional standpoint her superintendent is 
still pleased with her work,and feels that she has developed 
greatly as a teacher.

CASE J 


J entered the Faculty of Education as a serious, 
hard working and intelligent student, possessed of deep 
religious convictions imbued in her from her strict 
Norwegian Lutheran upbringing. The many obstacles in life 
which she had surmounted left her personality unwarped, and 
successful completion of her course for her Temporary License 
was just another of life 5 s challenges to be met dutifully 
but unenthusiastically. The circumstances which had 
necessitated much initiative and endeavour on her part had 
also left her lacking in social graces and charm. 

J had no memories of homelife involving her father 
or mother. The mother died when J was born. The father was 
a workman with financial difficulties, and so J was raised 
by an uncle and aunt who, like her parents, were both 
Norwegians and active members of the Lutheran Church. It 
was these God-fearing, hard working relatives, of rather 
straitened circumstances that acted as J*s parents for the 
next eighteen years. While J»s foster home provided a good 
home atmosphere and understanding there was little else that 
it could provide. The uncle held an unimportant position, 
and the problem of economic survival was always present. Be¬ 
cause of this situation, J*s chief after school activity was 
bringing in funds. The church was her main social contact.

J was very studious, however, and even for a 
pupil of "superior" rating on the Bellvue-Wechsler I.Q. 
test she probably got very high marks. In public school 
she was generally near the top of her class, and her 
matriculation results were as follows: English 80, social 
studies 79, algebra 76, trigonometry and geometry 89, 
biology 72, chemistry 73, and Latin 73. This was certainly 
a commendable record. The school which J attended was in a 
large town, and was well staffed. 

Despite J ! s social handicaps she fitted in quite 
naturally with the rest of the students. Since she was too 
busy to take part in social activities neither she nor the 
students appeared to attach much importance to this feature of 
her school life. Her former principal rated her just above 
average in popularity with her fellow students, and rated her 
high in respect to deportment within the community and. in 
her general attitude toward school. Social adjustment and 
maturity seemed normal; there was no apparent inferiority or 
superiority complex, and only her financial status seemed to 
set her aside. There was no opportunity for the principal 
to observe J»s social adjustment at school parties or other 
social functions since she was not able to attend. 

In her relationship with the counsellor J dis~ 
played a friendly, cheerful disposition, but was rather 
reticent about personal details. Obviously deeply ingrained

in her whole pattern of living was an intense feeling that 
life was real and life was earnest. In the light of her 
background this concept of living was quite understandable* 

Her serious view of life was undoubtedly reinforced by pro¬ 
found convictions of strict, fundamentalist content - in 
which this world was an austere preparation for the here¬ 
after. 

Both in high school and university, J seemed quite 
free from emotional complications. She had neither 
inordinate ambitions nor aspirations, and her personal 
resources were sufficient to attain her objectives. Life 
then provided her with few frustrations. In J f s Minnesota 
Multiphasic Personality Inventory her personality factors were 
contained within the T score range of 36 to 65. If personal 
observation, inquiry, and the test were valid, J was quite 
stable emotionally* 

J experienced no difficulties at university, and 
her marks gave her second class standing. Her chief concern 
was not worry over failure, but a fear that she was not doing 
as well as she could. University routine at first perplexed 
her without disturbing her. On the wire recorder her voice 
was somewhat nasal, but her other speech characteristics were 
about normal. No particular interest was shown in voice 
culture, and little improvement took place during the term. 

Her last wire recording was almost identical with the first.

Faculty members rated J high in quality of work 
and co-operativeness. In class response and interest she 
was rated above average, but the observation was made that 
she never asked questions in class periods. Personal care, 
appearance and maturity were rated as average, and class 
status rated below average. 

The reasons for selecting teaching as a profession 
were not too clearly expressed, but J said that she was 
guided in her selection by her preference for work in the 
social field. Undoubtedly a bursary had a decisive effect in 
directing her into education since she did mention the 
financial difficulties involved in getting an education. On 
the Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest Inventory J made the 
following percentile scores: personal-social 90, natural 
science 40, mechanical 10, business 80, artistic 10, and 
science 30. In types of interests she scored 70 in verbal, 

50 on manipulative, and 90 on composition. Insofar as the 
test was concerned, it clearly indicated a vocational field 
which included teaching. 

J took over a school of twenty-one students who had 
previously been Under a supervisor. The enterprise programme 
was found very complicated and difficult to manage and plan. 
Since J had never been in a rural school, even as a pupil, she 
had no background of recall to utilize. She said that H re¬ 
alistic" films of actual operation of rural schools would have

been a great help to her if they had been shown in her 
year of training* Previous recollections of schools that 
she had attended proved inadequate because of the difference 
in organization of those schools and the one she now taught* 
However, by the end of the year J was able to report that 
she found teaching exhausting but enjoyable, and that each 
child in her room was n adorable"* The superintendent of 
schools reported that she had been visited late in the fall, 
and that he considered her average for a first year student* 

Religious faith was a major part of J's educational 
philosophy. Shocked at the students* ignorance of ordinary 
Biblical knowledge, she read selected Bible stories to the 
class daily. Some of them were read over three or four times 
in succession to familiarize the students with them* While 
she derived satisfaction from teaching she stated at the end 
of the first year, that if she had the money to implement her 
choice she would take university training to fit her for 
special work in the missionary field. Two years later in a 
casual interview J again reiterated her preference for mission 
work rather than teaching. There remained the possibility 
that she might in the near future transfer from teaching to 
religious work. 

In the meantime J has made methodical progress to~ 
wards higher professional standing. Pier last three summers

CASE K 


The case of K is that of a young lady with 
mediocre academic ability but great ambition* Handicapped 
by her cultural and educational background she success¬ 
fully completed her course for her Temporary License by 
studious application* Perceiving some advantages in parti¬ 
cipating in the study she quickly established rapport with 
the author and frequently came to him for counsel* 

K was born the daughter of Ukrainian immigrants in 
an exceptionally primitive and isolated pioneer district. 

There were two younger brothers. The parents, who had the 
customary central European elementary school education, 
retained many of their homeland 1 s folkways. Neither parent 
had any cultural gifts but were hard working peasant stock 
and devoutly religious. K started out life in a log shack. 

K's early memories centred around the ruggedness and 
the hardships of making land and establishing a farm in a 
wilderness. The 1930*s, in which she was raised, were in the 
heart of the depression, and there was little money to add 
colour to, or relieve the monotony of, the homestead. 

Being the oldest child, she was, early in life called upon 
to assist her father in his labours on the farm. So 
thoroughly did she enjoy her work that even today she pre¬ 
fers farm chores to housework. The war years brought a measure

of prosperity to the farm and with it came modern power 
machinery. K loved to go home, take over the tractor and 
plow or harvest. The earthy, drab background of K*s life 
could be readily visualized. 

School was the usual one room institution common 
to many rural districts. Compared with the other students, 
mainly of Slavic origin, K did good work. Furthermore she 
had decided that she was going on to a career that had some 
prestige and dignity. The motivation of having a vocation 
that commanded respect continually revealed itself through¬ 
out the study* She graduated from grade nine with a "B" 
standing and in grade twelve she made 53 in French, 53 in 
social studies, 54 in biology and 47 in chemistry. Her 
Wechsler-Bellvue I.Q. test rated her as ’’average". Because 
of the intellectual barrenness of her environment the test 
probably should be interpreted with some caution. 

On leaving high school the superintendent of schools 
persuaded K to take the position of school supervisor in her 
home school which was then without a teacher. She did so, 
and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Since she was already 
contemplating teacher training it merely required the 
superintendent’s counsel to induce her to enrol in the 
Faculty of Education.

K had a rather unusual pattern of interests for one who 
had entered the teaching profession. Her percentile 
ranks in fields of interests were: personal-social 20, 
natural science 60, mechanical 90, business 20, artistic 50, 
and scientific 50. In types of interest K ! s ranks were: 
verbal 10, manipulative 70, and composition 10. With a 
personal-social rating of 20 and verbal and composition ratings 
of 10, the achievement of satisfaction in teaching would 
seem extraordinary, but such we shall see later seemed to be 
the case. 

To what then may we attribute this apparent error 
in the test? Various factors such as cultural background 
and unmeasured motivation may of course affect the validity. 

K*s chief motivation seemed to have been that of prestige 
seeking and her narrow world brought her into contact with 
few vocations other than that of teaching. A survey of the 
Strong test, reputed to be the best in its field, indicates 
that fifteen percent of the successes in various vocations 
rated low on its questionnaire. When one recollects the 
meagre cultural opportunities in K* s life and her unusual 
background, some departure from normal responses might be ex¬ 
pected, but not this much. The mechanical and manipulative 
percentile ranks were 90 and 70 respectively. In view of 
her history and statement of interests these were to be expect¬ 
ed. This case perhaps illustrated the prudence one should

exercise in interpreting interest inventories. 

K seemed to have a well balanced personality. 

Her previous principal could not be located for fuller 
information. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Invent- 
ory had all factors contained in the T score range from 36 
to 65* Not unexpectedly, her highest score was in 
masculinity. Her enjoyment of rather masculine activities 
on the farm would cause one to anticipate some indication of 
masculine interests. 

No particular difficulty was experienced by K in 
fitting herself into university life. Her background had at 
least made her self-reliant. Academically her work was 
satisfactory; a little above average. Reports on her 
practice teaching indicated her teaching was of border¬ 
line quality and as a consequence she had to teach an extra 
lesson. K was much disturbed emotionally about this, and 
went to the author for advice. Later, on her own initiative, 
she showed him her lesson plan which appeared to be a satis¬ 
factory outline of the lesson to be taught. The counsellor 
attended the lesson and K on this occasion did very 
satisfactorily in the opinion of both the author and faculty 
member. 

The consensus of faculty opinion rated K above 
average in quality of work, co-operativeness, personal care 
and appearance, and class response. In class status and

maturity she was rated below average. Some of the 
instructors noted the apparent lack of culture in her 
background, and observed that both oral and written ex¬ 
pression were just acceptable. In the letters written to 
the author, the organization, style and construction were 
inferior. On the wire recorder her recordings clearly 
revealed serious speech defects. K*s voice had a high pitched 
and shrill tone combined with a slight accent. By the end 
of the year there was an improvement in modulation, but no 
discernible betterment of other defects* 

Previous experience as a supervisor apparently 
benefitted K in her first school. She did not experience 
the usual difficulties of a first year teacher. On looking 
back on her university training she says she would like to 
have seen more demonstrations, particularly of the activity 
programme in rural schools. K assigned herself the very 
highest rating on enjoyment of teaching, but found that teach¬ 
ers have not the prestige that she thought they would have. 

Nor did teaching compare with other professions in remuneration 
consequently she stated that if she had been free to select 
any career she might not have taken teacher training, although 
she did not know of a better alternative. 

The superintendent of schools gave K a very favour¬ 
able report. He stated in part that she had given service 
above the average; had a well balanced schedule; gave a

splendid interpretation of the activity programme, and 
had an orderly classroom in which pupils enjoyed con¬ 
siderable freedom, and respected that privilege. 

K had never evinced any interest in advancing her 
academic qualifications although she expressed the intention 
of acquiring her permanent certificate. In the past three 
years she has attended summer school sessions twice and 
successfully completed four courses, one of which was for 
matriculation. Currently she is still doing well as a teacher 
but seems to be quite satisfied with her present station in 
life.

CASE L 

Even at the completion of the study, L still remained 
somewhat of an enigma. A charming and vivacious young lady of 
talent, she entered the Faculty of Education to acquire her 
Temporary License. Strongly self-centered and the victim of 
an unfortunate accident, she leaves doubt as to the real 
cause of her failure. 

L, of 4-nglo-Saxon parentage, was born in a southern 
city. Above average in education, the father had completed his 
second year chemical engineering, and the mother had finished 
her grade twelve. The depression years prevented the father 
from completing his course at university, and he held a number 
of positions in the years following. He did not succeed in 
establishing himself successfully, and at the beginning of 
World War II he joined the army. Upon being demobilized he 
secured the position of building superintendent with a large 
department store. 

The family itself was a happy, good natured group, 
a little on the irresponsible side perhaps, but nonetheless 
a sound social unit. There was one girl older than L and two 
brothers younger. A former high school principal rates the 
family very high insofar as home atmosphere and relationships 
between parents were concerned. Musical and artistic talent 
ran in the family, and the parents saw to it that musical

opportunities were made available to the children. The older 
girl appeared on radio programmes quite frequently and while the 
younger girl participated to a lesser extent, she suffered from 
a feeling that she was overshadowed by her older sister. In 
casual conversation it was obvious that she was conscious of the 
fact that no matter what she did her sister did it better. Chiefly 
due to the influence of the father the family also took a keen 
interest in sport. 

L had no particular reason for selecting teaching other 
than that she preferred it. A scholarship was mentioned by her 
as a determining factor since family finances would not permit 
more than one year of study at university. Later in the year L 
stated that if she had the choice of a career she would select 
the medical profession first, teaching second, and dramatics 
third. She took two interest inventories. The Kuder test rated 
her high in both literary and social fields. The Lee-Thorpe 
test produced the following percentile scores: personal-social 99, 
natural science 20, mechanical 1, business 20, artistic 70, 
scientific 60, verbal 90, manipulative 30, and composition 50. 

There was no indication in either test that her initial choice 
of teaching was unwise; neither was there anything to confirm 
her subsequent interest in being a doctor. Her school marks and 
both the interest inventories seemed to exclude medical training 
as a choice. Questioning revealed, however, that it was the 
social aspect of medicine that appealed to her. Contact with

people, suffering mankind, and ideals of service seemed the basis 
for her choice. The skills and types of knowledge required in 
the medical profession seemed to have been overlooked by L in 
considering a career as a doctor, and she expressed lack of 
interest in most of the subjects that she would be required to 
study on the course. 

L*s personality was difficult to assess. Charming 
and good looking, she talked easily and with no feeling of 
restraint. Yet there was the obvious flair for the dramatic 
effect which left one wondering if all the world was not a 
stage to L. On the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inven¬ 
tory L had a normal score on all personality factors except 
hysteria and hypomania, in which she scored 72 and 93 respectively. 
A hypomania factor could account for her superficial interest 
in a great many things but there is no clear evidence that the 
hysteria factor was of significance. The hysteria factor will 
be discussed later. 

There is evidence that L, when working under pressure, 
frequently became excitable and uncontrolled. During the 
directing of a group for a drama festival, she encountered 
production, and personnel problems; because of these at 
rehearsals she would display excitement and despair combined 
with abundant critical comment. In ordinary discussions with

the author on her dramatic and other difficulties, she would 
become very animated and voluble. The evidence of hysteria must 
be weighed with great caution, however, since the borderline 
hysteria factor on her M.M.P.I. may have made the author unduly 
sensitive to any substantiating evidence. 

While at university an accident occurred which was of 
great and unfortunate consequence in L*s life. She was seated 
near a campfire one night when she was struck violently behind 
the ear by a carelessly thrown block of wood. Dizziness, 
headaches, and inability to balance followed. She was con¬ 
fined to the hospital for some time and the doctor stated that 
in all probability the balancing mechanism of the inner ear had 
been damaged. Her nurses reported that L occasionally fell out 
of bed, but always when there was an audience. On the evidence 
it would be unwise to conclude the symptoms were psychomatic, 
but her desire to be conspicuous may have caused her to exag¬ 
gerate them. 

The effects of the accident remained with L for some 
time, and after returning to university she required the ser¬ 
vices of a companion at all times to maintain her balance. She 
was unable to stand in one position for more than a short time 
without falling unless checked by her companion. L*a apparent 
obliviousness to the state of her equilibrium seemed genuine

enough, and the author was convinced that the trauma existed* 

It seemed, however, that L actually enjoyed the drama and the 
uniqueness of the situation* 

As a result of the accident L was unable to write any 
November tests, and at the Christmas test only four examinations 
were written with an average of 65$. L claimed that the acci¬ 
dent had seriously impaired her ability to study, and that she 
could not study long without getting sever© headaches. L's 
practice teaching was satisfactory and her comment on it was 
that it was much like getting up before a theatre audience 
except that the spectators were all children. 

There was a divergency of opinion among faculty 
members as to her maturity and class status; a divergency which 
was shared by some of her fellow students. The author's investi¬ 
gation indicated that those who associated socially or casually 
with L were favourably impressed with her while those who had to 
work with her or under her took an opposite view. 

L took a great interest in the wire recorder which she 
learned to operate and use by herself. While directing the play 
previously mentioned she made extensive use of it for diction 
and expression analysis. Her voice was of exceptionally good 
quality, expressive and well modulated, and her enunciation was 
excellent. 

At the end of the term the Faculty of Education failed

L, and did not permit her to attend summer sohool to rectify 
her academic deficiencies as she claimed had been promised her. 
L was interviewed that summer and was very bitter over her year 
at university. She stated that concessions made out of con¬ 
sideration for her accident were repudiated later, and she 
seemed to feel that the extensiveness of her failure was 
unimportant. When last interviewed she was employed in the 
city in an insurance office, found business life unpleasant, 
and insisted that she would still like to teach. Unfortunately 
for her, aptitude for teaching is not sufficient qualification, 
some degree of training must be acquired as well. Whether this 
training is omitted due to sickness or some other factor is 
immaterial, and it is difficult to imagine what else L could 
have done other than to repeat her year if she wished to teach.

CASE M 


M came to the Faculty of Education to acquire a Tem¬ 
porary License for teaching. Ambitious* industrious but 
colourless, M possessed little academic ability. Interest in 
higher education was motivated chiefly by a desire for pres¬ 
tige, and his attitudes and sense of values were strongly 
influenced by his early environment. His graduation and 
subsequent failure as a teacher might have been avoided had 
there been competent counselling and proper university en¬ 
trance standards. 

M was born of Ukrainian parents in a Canadian Ukrainian 
settlement in Alberta. There were four others in the family, 
two girls and two boys. His father was a farmer, and both his 
father and mother were born and raised on farms in the small 
settlement in which M was born. The parents acquired the usual 
elementary education in what was then homestead territory, but 
what is now prosperous farmland. 

The family prospered financially and had a well equipped 
and modern farm. As a social unit the family was stable, but 
family life was inclined to be dull and uninspiring. On the 
rating scale the family was placed below average in community 
participation, and rated above average in community prestige. 

In church work and interest, they were rated above average. 

Home atmosphere and relationship between parents was

exceptionally fine. The family could best be described as a 
successful social and economic unit, pious, hard working, and 
unimaginative. 

Possessing a friendly nature, although at first shy 
and reserved, M did a great deal of talking, but never provided 
a biography, filled in a questionnaire, or supplied any post¬ 
graduate information. This failure to provide written informa¬ 
tion was probably due not to reticence, but to a flaw in his 
character. His superintendent a year later reported M had 
a marked inability at analyzing, organizing and implementing 
ideas. Much information had to be acquired from other sources. 
He did, however, regularly attend the meetings and interviews, 
and on a number of occasions sought out the author for private 
discussions. 

M was raised in a homogeneous culture pattern. His 
home community and the surrounding area were almost solidly- 
peopled by second generation Canadian-Ukrainians. While M 
was raised free from the usual cultural conflict and clash of 
races with different folkways, there were marked social dis¬ 
advantages. The large, self-contained settlement made it 
possible and natural for national customs, ideals, language, 
and culture to be retained. In M*s district in the early i930*s 
it was not unusual for pupils beginning grade one to be unable

to speak any English despite the fact that some of them were of 
the third generation in that district. The consequence of this 
cultural insularity has been that many of the community's gradu¬ 
ates living in Anglo-Saxon communities became aware that their 
accent and idioms revealed their foreign extraction. In an 
attempt to compensate for a "not-in-the-group" feeling of 
inferiority, compensating behaviour was sometimes resorted 
to, in which forwardness and/or inordinate ambition were dis¬ 
played. 

M appeared to be no exception to the above type. He 
had aspirations of rising very high in the academic world; he 
visualized himself in a position of prestige and dignity. Yet 
deep down in his mind he regarded himself as inferior and inade¬ 
quate. To conceal this inward regard M talked with an air of 
supercilious superiority as if to convince the listener that if 
he but wished to apply himself, success and distinction awaited 
him. On rare occasions he recognized his limitations, but avoided 
discussion of them. 

In discussions of his academic future he acknowledged 
a liking for, and a skill in, shop work. He recognized his 
difficulties in purely academic work yet on one occasion he 
abruptly summed it up by stating that he would never take 
training in shop because shop instructors were only glorified 
workers. Therefore, he would major in psychology.

Investigation of M’s school life revealed little that 
was noteworthy. It was the story of a hoy with low intelli¬ 
gence for academic work who liked school and worked hard to get 
through his grades. In graduating from school his marks were? 
English 56, Social Studies 61, Algebra 65, Trigonometry 45, 
and Chemistry 61# To complete his high school it was necessary 
for him to go to a nearby town. His high school principal 
reported that M took practically no part in school activities 
other than to serve on the student council as room representative. 
This non-participation was not due to lack of opportunity since 
the high school that M attended was well known for its extensive 
and well-planned extra-curricular programme. The principal 
rated M as average in popularity and well above average in social 
adjustment and general attitude toward school. It was also 
observed that he occasionally displayed shyness. 

No particular reason was given by M for choosing teach¬ 
ing as a career. The Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest Inventory 
substantiated his inhibited recognition that he should teach 
shop. His percentile scores were as follows: personal-social 80, 
natural science 30, mechanical 80, business 20, artistic 20, 
scientific 70, verbal 30, manipulative 20 and composition 10, 

While the personal-social and mechanical scores pointed toward 
shop and teaching, it should be observed that verbal, manipulative

and composition scores were so low as to introduce incom¬ 
patible factors. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
Inventory test was normal and warranted no comment. 

M enjoyed the prestige of being a university student 
and although he worked very hard his marks were not satisfac¬ 
tory. Most of his examination averages were in the low fifties. 
His past lack of interest in extra-curricular activities con¬ 
tinued at university, and he appeared to lead an orderly, routine 
existence. The faculty survey showed close agreement in rating 
him as average in quality of work, class response, maturity, 
co-operativeneas, personal care and appearance, and class status. 

The first recording by M on the wire recorder was very 
poor. Speech was stilted, enunciation was bad, and an accent 
was apparent. Though recognizing these defects, he made no 
effort to correct them, and his recording at the end of the term 
showed no apparent improvement. 

M was very critical of the university courses he took. 
The criticism appeared prompted by dissatisfaction with his 
results rather than by intelligent analysis, and his usual comment 
was that the courses were meaningless. 

After graduation M was appointed to the elementary room 
in a two-room school. -&t the time of writing he had not replied 
to any of the author’s correspondence, but the superintendent.

in his letter, stated that he was deeply concerned with the 
quality of the work being done by M. He was visited three times 
by the superintendent who found little evidence of teaching 
ability, organization, or energy; nor were there signs of im¬ 
provement. The superintendent rated him as being much below 
average ability for a first year teacher and definitely the most 
incompetent teacher in the school division. 

M’s matriculation average was only 56; much too low 
to allow him to enter any other faculty of the university. He 
displayed obvious speech defects, and his lack of interest in 
verbal and composition fields made his selection of teaching 
as a profession seem an unwise choice. His academic standing 
and low I.Q. substantiated each other and there is the 
possibility that testing and counselling might have saved 
M from entering the teaching profession merely as an entry to 
white collar dignity, but even more important, had entrance 
requirements to the Faculty of Education been the same as for 
other faculties M’s unfortunate acquisition of the right to 
teach could not have occurred. 

A follow-up of this case, three years after graduation 
reveals that M spent a most unsatisfactory year from the stand¬ 
point of superintendent, parents and M himself. As a consequence

he withdrew from teaching and went into business in a small way. 
Business life also presented its difficulties and there remains 
the possibility that a minor recession may impel him to try 


teaching again

CASE N 

Self assured and competent, N registered in the Tem¬ 
porary License course in the Faculty of Education. N attended 
all general meetings, hut missed most personal interviews. In 
the few personal interviews held with her she maintained a 
precise, businesslike manner, and little of N's background or 
personality could be determined. Herchoice of teaching subse¬ 
quently turned out to be an unhappy one, but whether this could 
have been avoided is conjecture. 

N was born in a little farming community a consider¬ 
able distance from the nearest town. The people of the community, 
including N's parents, were of Anglo-Saxon stock. While N was 
still quite young her father died and the mother continued to 
run the farm with the help of her elder brother who was the only 
other sibling. 

Not much was known of the more intimate aspects of N’s 
life. She wrote no biography, and absented herself from inter¬ 
views. The only available source of information was her former 
principal who was able to supply only sparse details concerning 
N and her family. In a personal interview she spoke of the hard¬ 
ships experienced by the family in the depression of the 1930*s. 
Rural sociability seemed to her to be superior to that of the city. 
Country dances and socials were enjoyable highlights in her life 
and she preferred the country to the city.

In conversation N revealed herself as a competent, 
self-possessed individual. Above average in personal appear¬ 
ance, she was inclined to be somewhat prim in demeanour. Her 
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory contained all 
personality factors in the T score range of 37 to 54 indicat¬ 
ing a stable emotional pattern. No evidence ever tended to 
show otherwise. 

Her education was acquired under difficulties. Most 
of it was taken through the Correspondence Branch of the Depart¬ 
ment of Education, and her last year was spent in the high school 
of a neighbouring town where she stayed at the dormitory. The 
high school principal reported that she was an inconspicuous 
student who applied herself studiously and took part in few 
extra-curricular activities. She graduated with the following 
marks: English 58, Social Studies 61, Biology 61, Chemistry 45 
and Physics 53. N rated "average" on the Wechsler-Bellvue I.Q. 
test and her school grades probably were the result of serious 
work. 

N apparently selected the teaching profession because 
of negative forces. She was faced with the choice of taking 
either a business course or teacher training. Both business 
and town life were distasteful to her and since pay was better 
in the teaching profession she entered the Faculty of Education.

Family finances were strained and the opportunity of scholar¬ 
ships was an added incentive. Her Lee-Thorpe Occupational 
Interest Inventory is interesting, particularly in the light 
of her later attitude toward teaching. Her percentile scores 
were: personal-social 10, natural science 90, mechanics 99, 
business 10, artistic 30, scientific 1, verbal 20, manipulative 
90 and composition 1. Should the test be valid N was in the 
wrong profession with a personal-social rating of 10, a verbal 
rating of 20 and a composition rating of 1. A better area of 
employment for her to have explored would have been the mechani¬ 
cal, artistic and manipulative fields, and this was noted at 
the time in her records. 

N*s university year revealed nothing noteworthy. Her 
academic work was slightly better than at high school, and placed 
her in a low second class standing. No specific reaction could 
be elicited from N concerning university life. Her attitude 
seemed to be that the courses had to be taken and she would take 
them. Faculty members were in agreement in rating her just 
above average in quality of work, class response and interest, 
maturity, co-operativeness, personal care, appearance and class 
status. An analysis of her speech on the wire recorder showed 
that it was of ordinary quality with a tendency toward poor 
enunciation of word endings. At the end of the year there was

some improvement in her enunciation, hut none in her general 
delivery. 

N* s first teaching position was in a one-room school. 
She made no reply to post-graduate surveys, and her personal 
reactions were not known at the time. Her school superintendent 
reported that he had visited her in the spring, and that she was 
doing conscientious work combined with just average teaching 
ability. 

Three years after N f s entrance into the Faculty of 
Education the author met her and discussed her teaching experi¬ 
ences. She said that she had been unable to endure more than 
one year of teaching and so had resigned and taken a job as 
cashier in the city. Despite the decrease in her salary, she 
enjoyed being a cashier i|uch more than she had being a teacher. 
Her first impression of social life in the city had altered, 
and she was now looking forward to marrying and living there. 

It is interesting to note that N f s vocational reactions were 
what had been anticipated to some extent from the Lee-Thorp© 
test when it was given three years previously, and there remains 
the possibility that N would have profited from vocational 


guidance

CASE 0 

Case 0 is included because she was in the original 
case study group* While 0 did not deliberately shun or ignore 
the project, she attended only one meeting and did not find 
time to fill in a questionnaire or complete a psychometric 
test* Usually she excused herself in advance of her appoint¬ 
ment by explaining that she had to be elsewhere, but that she 
would be sure to be there next time* Part, at least, of her 
non-participation seemed to be due to a lack of maturity that 
reflected itself in her inability to plan ahead and meet 
commitments and part because she stayed at her home just outside 
the city limits while attending university, and considerable 
time was required for commuting* 

Nothing was known of her family history, nor was her 
former principal able to give any information other than that 
pertaining to her school life. Her school record was unimpres¬ 
sive with the following matriculation marks: English 57, Social 
Studies 67, Algebra 59, Trigonometry 45 , Biology 64, Physics 52 
and French 62* This gave her an average of 58. On the question¬ 
naire to principals she was rated as average in popularity with 
fellow students, community life, and school attitudes. She was 
rated very low in social adjustment and maturity* It was 
mentioned that 0 was very ill at ease at school dances and 


socials

No replies were received by the author to any of the 
post-graduate surveys which were sent out* but her school 
superintendent replied at some length and had this to say; 


”0 exhibits the usual characteristics of 
a beginning teacher, uncertainty about aims and 
objectives; weaknesses in techniques and pro¬ 
cedures; difficulties in classroom control, etc. 

In addition she reveals personality traits not 
altogether wholesome. She is typically introvert, 
emotionally tight; dissociates herself from 
teacher and community activities and does not 
give herself sufficiently to the pupils of her 
room. She is well groomed, pleasant In appearance, 
quite interesting to talk to and appears to possess 
above average intelligence. In short she does 
have several requisites potentially suitable in a 
teacher; she also has several weaknesses. 

To date, although there has been an improve¬ 
ment in classroom control, largely of a repressive 
nature, she reveals little growth in essentials. 

One of the chief ones must be the development of 
a more wholesome personality. Miss 0 has yet to 
show that she likes children. For a first year 
teacher I place her below average.” 

Neither did the faculty members overrate her. On 
quality of work, class response, co-operativeness and class 
status, she was placed at average or below. Only in personal 
appearance was she rated above average. It is to be regretted 
that 0 did not participate more freely In the project so that 
her background and personality could have been more thoroughly 


explored

CHAPTER IV CONCLUSIONS 

Counselling 

Speaking generally, one finds three major procedures 
in counselling; vocational, educational and personal. Although 
any one of these areas may be emphasized, counselling would be 
ineffective if the others were completely neglected. The purpose 
of this study was not to determine whether counselling would 
benefit students but to determine the need for and organization 
of counselling services. In order to draw statistical infer¬ 
ences one would require an elaborate experimental design requir¬ 
ing matched groups. Nonetheless, the case study, with its more 
intimate study of emotional and background factors, doss permit 
limited generalizations. 

Of the group of fifteen, five either solicited or 
received counselling on personal problems. The extent and nature 
of this counselling ranged from psychiatric treatment to inti¬ 
mate discussion of personal problems. The remainder received 
the usual educational or vocational guidance. Accordingly, a 
summary of the more significant cases follows before any general 
observations are made. 

Case A*s maladjustment is seen against the background 
of a broken home, frustration, battle fatigue and marital prob¬ 
lems, The emotional difficulties were so complex and deep rooted 
that the services of a psycho-analyst were required. Certainly

the situation was such that the author would have been most 
unwise to have attempted psychiatric procedures* There seems 
little doubt that the psycho-analytical techniques employed 
were effective, with the result that today A is a well adjusted, 
and successful man* Recently A completed his second university 
degree without difficulty. 

The real tragedy of Case B only revealed itself after 
he had inexplicably and suddenly left the university for an 
army career* Apparently no satisfactions were derived by B 
from activities in a personal-social field such as teaching. 
Unfortunately the social pressures of his family background 
were too strong for him and so he found it necessary to 
escape completely from an environment in which he was both 
incapable and afraid of adjusting himself. No guidance was 
done until after 3*s departure and then that was by correspon¬ 
dence. In retrospect the counsellor was of the opinion that 
because of B*s personality and the basic influences, that 
effective personal counselling would neither have been possible 
nor wise. 

As an illustration of the above point, an anecdote is 
of interest. It has been stated previously that B was conscious of 
his speech inadequacies; particularly after his use of the wire

recorder. Apparently in an effort to establish a case for his 
anticipated action B informed his father that recordings revealed 
that he had a completely inadequate voice for teaching. The 
important point is* however, that when B left there was concern 
voiced that the counsellor’s imprudence was a contributing factor 
to B’s action. The incident accordingly points out one of the 
hazards to be avoided in counselling programmes. 

C had a most sordid and frustrating upbringing. Up to 
and including high school graduation, it was this extraordinary 
background that appeared to produce a tremendous motivation to 
excel. In university his schizophrenic and paranoic tendencies 
became more dominant and he became completely inadequate in coping 
successfully with his problems. 

The remedy, if any, for C’s difficulties might have 
been found in psychiatric treatment. His emotional problems 
were, however, too deeply rooted to be resolved by ordinary 
counselling and advice. Neither does there seem any reason 
why counselling in high school might have been beneficial sine© 
his high school teachers had previously felt that he was on the 
path of academic success. 

Case E is the record of a student who became a schizo¬ 
phrenic patient in a mental institution shortly after entering 
university. His mediocre school record, achieved by hard

work and combined with a mediocre I.Q., might have indicated to 
a counsellor that E would not derive satisfaction from higher 
education. Whether there were any signs of mental disturbance 
evident while he was in high school could not be determined. 

Nor was there any evidence that E, particularly in light of 
his inordinate ambition, would have been responsive to voca¬ 
tional guidance. 

Case D was a very self-assured young man who had seen 
and travelled much for his age — and knew it. No difficulties 
were experienced by him in his studies, and he possessed an 
abundance of energy and capacity. His chief problems lay in 
the overt aspects of personality, such as voice and mannerisms. 
While the counsellor was not successful through his counsel¬ 
ling in achieving much immediate change in these, he was success¬ 
ful in getting him his desired commission in the naval reserves. 
It is also possible that the psychometric tests confirmed his 
judgment that he should find his life work in the social field. 

Cases A, B, C, E, and D illustrate the necessity of 
campus counselling services. Of the five just summarized, four 
needed help urgently. Case A received professional assistance 
and went on to success; Case E also had the help of a psychia¬ 
trist but was confined in a mental institution; Case C should 
have had, but never received, professional treatment and today

is an unhappy, unsettled misfit; Case B was vocationally mis¬ 
cast and assistance would have been difficult; and Case D merely 
required extra assistance in understanding some of his behaviour 
traits. 

After analyzing the five cases it would appear that 
the campus counselling organization should provide facilities 
and contacts enabling the counsellor to enlist professional 
mental health services when necessary. Case A in itself is a 
justification of this type of counselling. Had A failed to 
adjust himself, there would have been severe repercussions to 
society and his family. When one compares this with his 
present happy and useful function as a citizen, a comment is 
scarcely merited. 

The remaining ten members of the case study group were 
those without evident maladjustments. These constituted the 
cases that profited to some degree from counselling. Gases P, 

L, H, and G in particular derived some benefit from counselling 
insofar as planning either future courses or solving immediate 
student problems. 

The interest taken in psychometric testing and voca¬ 
tional guidance by this group indicated a need for vocational 
counselling on the campus. It would seem that a service that 
facilitates and assists students orienting themselves can be jus¬ 
tified psychologically without statistical substantiation.

In taking an overview of the counselling needs of 
the group there appears to he two categories - personal; 
vocational and educational* It might he noted that for uni¬ 
versity students,vocational and educational guidance merge* 

The question might properly he raised at this time 
as to what faculty of the university might most properly 
assume the responsibility for counselling* The require¬ 
ments for competence in this field would naturally limit it 
to professionally trained educationists and psychologists; 
qualifications found in the Faculty of Education and the 
Department of Psychology* 

In the counsellor’s opinion the Faculty of Edu¬ 
cation might he, for two reasons, designated as the counsel¬ 
ling authority, working in collaboration with the Department 
of Psychology* A proper division of responsibilities between 
the two might consist in having the Education Faculty do the 
vocational counselling with the Psychology Department assuming 
the major responsibility for personality maladjustment. First, 
the Department of Psychology is primarily concerned with pure 
research or abnormal behaviour, whereas, in the Faculty of 
Education counselling emphasis is placed chiefly on techniques 
for nonoal people* Secondly, the Faculty of Education being a 
faculty has a larger staff and would have to rely less on senior 
students than other departments*

Motivation Factors 

An interesting consideration of the study was a survey 
as to why the fifteen cases entered the Faculty of Education. 
Motives that impelled them to select teaching fell into the fol¬ 
lowing categoriesj one entered because of family pressure; two 
entered because of the low entrance requirements; three felt 
that bursaries were a major factor; five took education because 
of preference; two had general reasons; and two were never 
questioned. Some of course were influenced to some degree by a 
multiplicity of reasons. 

Of the seven who entered because of the negative 
pressures of family wishes, low entrance standards, and bur¬ 
saries, only one is still teaching. That is case J who took a 
bursary, but who also showed a strong interest in personal- 
social vocations. It should be pointed out that others took 
bursaries also, but the bursary was not the major reason for 
enrolling in education. 

Six of the other eight entered because of either 
interest, or very general reasons. However, the two who entered 
for general reasons had a positive interest in university work 
and a career. It is interesting to note that out of this six 
students we find that none have left the profession. Three of 
them have taken degrees and the rest have improved their 


certification.

In making inferences as to motivation it must be 
admitted that there are but fifteen cases* While this number 
is too few to permit generalizations that require statistical 
validation they do indicate to the writer that a more elaborate 
survey of this nature might be of some importance. 

One important area of motivation not discussed is 
that of the economic future offered by teaching* To acquire 
this information one would have to survey other faculties and 
determine how many of their students would have enrolled in 
education if the economic rewards had been greater. It follows 
that those students who found the economic factor the deter¬ 
mining one would not be found in the Faculty of Education. 

Particular attention should be drawn to the two 
students who entered because of low academic standards. One 
might, with considerable logic, argue that lowering require¬ 
ments to enable people to enter a field in which they will 
neither succeed nor advance merely increases the personnel 
turnover. These people do not therefore decrease the teacher 
shortage, several recent studies 1 corroborate this view.

Bursaries alone may not be of great importance unless 
the people accepting them have an interest and aptitude in 
education. It would seem that bursaries might be of tremendous 
significance if measures were taken to insure that the pupils 
who receive this assistance were those who intended to make a 
career in education. It should be noted with reservations, that 
the two who considered bursaries the major factor in their 
selection of teaching did not remain.

Teacher Selection 

Any programme of teacher training must accept certain 
democratic implications of modern society. The most important 
of these is the concept that to a great extent the individual 
shall he free to determine his own future; provided that every¬ 
one is subject to the same conditions of entering and qualify¬ 
ing in a particular vocation. 

A method of teacher selection, therefore, that might 
prohibit or restrict a candidate from entering the profession, 
prior to his having an opportunity to prove himself, would be 
undemocratic. If a candidate has the specified entrance stan¬ 
dards and if he successfully meets the required tests and 
personal standards of any faculty, he should be allowed to 
enter that faculty. The functioning of the teacher training 
programme itself constitutes the machinery of teaeher selection. 

A non-directive and non-restrictive aspect of teacher 
selection should be a function of the high schools. Here career 
counsellors should aid the student to evaluate the many personal, 
social, and economic factors necessary in selecting a life wcrk. 

The present view of the A.T.A. is that teacher selec¬ 
tion should be accomplished, first, by the raising of standards 
for university entrance, and secondly, by the selective processes 
of the courses themselves. Prom a standpoint of public rela¬ 
tions alone, the A.T.A. is desirous of having its members conduct

counselling in such a way that the teaching profession cannot 
be accused of either recruiting for, or discouraging candidates 
from, any vocation,and teaching in particular. The practice 
discussed is that generally followed in other professions and 
there seems no reason to deviate from it at this time. 

The above three observations on teacher selection, 
counselling and motivation, proceed directly from the writer’s 
reaction to the data of this study; perhaps they will stimu¬ 
late some thought and discussion among those interested in 
teacher-training. In any case, it seems reasonable to assume 
that whatever may be the significance of the recommendations, 
the case studies representing the results of five ani one-half 
months of intimate study, followed by follow-up techniques.
