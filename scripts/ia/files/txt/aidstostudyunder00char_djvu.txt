CHAPTER I 
NEED FOR A CHANGE 

1 

•The old order changeth, yielding place to new, 
And God fulfils himself in many ways, 

Lest one good custom should corrupt the world*• 


Hundreds of thousands of words have been printed in newspapers 
and magazines throughout the country in the last five years, commenting, 
exploring and conjecturing as to improvements in post-war education* The 
experience of training young men and women for the life and death struggle 
of the last war should add materially to our store of successful teaching 
practices* A new reservoir has been tapped, with its potentiality of new 
information, new ideas and new methods for performing old and familiar 
tasks* 


Without a doubt, the fields that should profit lucratively from 
the effects of military training upon education are science and mathematics* 
Is it not an opportune time for the teachers of high school mathematics in 
Alberta to do some cooperative thinking, and build a good strong healthy 

functional program in mathematical education? Ermine the prelude to 

2 

"The Second Report of the Commission on Post-War Plans"• 

^"The mental climate with respect to mathematics is at 
the moment very favorable* Now is the time to put our house 
in order by making the improvements which have been proposed 
for too long* In this post-war period we should be ready to 
provide the very finest mathematics program for every type 
of youngsters in our schools*•

The author considers himself fortunate to have been able to 
add more than three years of active association with the "R.C.A.F. 
Training Method" to his pre-war and post-war experience in teaching 
high school mathematics in Alberta. It is this experience, and five 
years of experimental practice in teaching mathematics that has prompted 
the author to attempt a thesis designed to bring to the attention of 
Alberta teachers of secondary mathematics suggestions for "improving 
mathematical instruction." 


The keynote to any discussion relative to mathematical 
instruction is the aim to be achieved, for without the continued 
presence of the broader concept of th© ultimate results to be achieved 
in the mind of the teacher, the day-to-day classroom activities lose 
their significance, and are stifled in a morass of indecision. The 
Mathematics Programme of Studies for the Alberta High School Bulletin #4 
establishes the aims of teaching mathematics as follows: 

^"Intelligent living in our modern scientific world requires - 

1. to provide a deeper understanding and appreciation of the 
power and usefulness of mathematics; 

2. to make mathematics a more effective tool for solving 
the complex problems of modern life; and 

3* to give a preview of, to stimulate interest in, and 

to provide a sound basis for more advanced mathematics." 

The above aims are in complete harmony with those expounded by the 

"The Second Report of the Commission on Post-War Plans". Yiz: -

sponsibility, 

1, to provide sound mathematical training for our 
future leaders of science, mathematics and other 
learned fields, and 

2. to insure mathematical competence for the ordinary- 
affairs of life to the extent that this can be done 
for all citizens as a part of a general education 
appropriate for the major fraction of the high school 
population. w 


Success in teaching mathematics depends to a great extent on the 
method used by the teacher. Of the three factors involved in the teaching 
process — teacher, pupil and subject, only the subject remains constant. 
Each new class, each new pupil, is the variable determining the method to 
be used by the teacher. The successful teacher soon realizes the 
impracticability of attempting to get certain classes to respond to methods 
used successfully in the classes of different characteristics. With each 
class, and with each individual member of that class, some evaluation in 
teaching technique becomes absolutely necessary. Frequent analysis of 
methods employed by the teacher, over a period of years, will demonstrate 
that the "quality* rather than the "quantity* of word covered should be the 
aim. The way a thing is done counts far more than does the mere achievement 
of a correct solution. 

Assuming that effective learning^ is the product of a multitude 
of experiences rather than a multitude of repetitions of as nearly the same 
experiences as it is possible to achieve, it was the aim of the writer to 
discover the extent to which the presentation of the subject matter in

Alberta mathematics classes was complemented by teaching equipment and 
facilities in a mathematics classroom or laboratory* A questionnaire 
was composed and sent to every Alberta high school, scheduled by the 
Department of Education, as a grade twelve examination centre. The 
questionnaire listed some two hundred items of mathematical equipment and 
classroom facilities that could, in all probability, be used to 
advantage in an average high school mathematics class* The items when 
checked off by a teacher or principal would indicate the mathematical 
facilities available in that particular high school. The response to the 
questionnaire was very good for out of the 200 survey sheets sent out, 

140 or 70% of the high schools contacted returned the completed forms* 

A study of the summary of this survey. Table 1 below, reveals 
that, in the main, Alberta high schools have only limited facilities t© 
supplement their presentations of the subject matter in mathematics* At 
the same time it must be noted that the teachers evinced a desire t© learn 
where such aids to the teaching of mathematics could be procured. 

It was the desire to assist high school teachers in these two 
particulars i.e*, deficiency of mathematical facilities and the desire on 
the part of teachers to procure equipment, that prompted the author to do 
some research work in the categories of laboratory and field mathematics 
with their special applications to high school teaching. It is hoped that 
the pictures and the accounts of the various **Aids to the Study and 
Understanding of High School Mathematics**, that follow, will encourage 
mathematics teachers to enrich the illustrative aspects of their teaching*

SOLID MODELS. 

The success to be met in the use of these models depend© 
on careful preparation and proper selection. 


CHAPTER II 

THE USE OF MODELS IN THE MATHEMATICS CLASSROOM 


If teachers took the vow to teach no mathematical idea, process 
or skill unless they could make it sensible to children, they would have 
to change their classroom practices. The uses of visual and other sensory 
aids would be increased for it is through such aids that many mathematical 
meanings and relationships are most readily presented. The introduction 
of such laboratory teaching in a mathematics lesson is one method of 
giving reality to the subject without the loss of its abstract and theor¬ 
etical aspect. However, in comparison with the aid® in some of the other 
subjects of our high school curriculum, there is a paucity of illustrative 
materials in mathematics classrooms. If the mathematics classroom contains 
the proper multi-sensory aids the age-old student question, ®X can*t see 
that®, will be met with the response, ®Here it is, see for yourself®.

One of the commonest types of multi-sensory devices is the space 
model. It is difficult to teach any one of the mathematics courses 
without referring to such space figures as cylinders, pyramids, cones, 
prisms, ellipsoids, spheres or cubes. It is a mistake to think that 
there is just one type of space model, for we can run through a gamut of 
solid models, split models, cardboard models, skeleton models, multi¬ 
colored solids, string or wire models, and multi-model construction sets. 



A SET OF TEACHING MODELS. 

Large brightly painted teaching models have a distinct 

pedagogical value.

Each particular type of model has a definite place in the 
teaching process, and it remains for the resourceful teacher to employ 
the type which will prove adaptable to the particular student and the 
particular problem. Here are a few typical exampless 


Split Models - Split models are used in the teaching process to enable the 
students to see actual triangles, heights, edges or areas when the model 
is dissected. Small wooden pegs attached to one section fit snugly into 
drilled holes of a corresponding section and hold the dissected portions 
together. The assembled portions form a solid appearing model prior to 
the study of a particular problem. The use of a color scheme in these 
split models will make the study much more effective. 


SPLIT MODELS 

Readily available to the teacher and to the class at 
the correct psychological moment in the lesson.

Frame Models - A frame model enables the students to construct within the 
eonfines of the model, any required visual figures from lengths of colored 
wire or knitting needles. Elastic bands can be used to form the flexible 
linkages between the lines or edges represented by the structural girders 
of the frame model. 



SKELETON MODELS 

Required geometric figures are set up within these models 
by means of rigid knitting needles. 


String Models - Large and inexpensive geometric models can be constructed 
from several yards of string and the appropriately shaped sections of 
plywood or masonite. For example, if a cone is to be constructed, a disc 
is mounted on the end of an eight-ench rod, and the string is then strung 
alternately between the top of the rod and every quarter-inch spacing 
along the circumference of the base. If this string model of the cone is 
pieced in a parallel beam of light a visible circle will be formed where 
the light strikes the strings. The up or down movement of the cone or the

beam of light will illustrate circles of various sizes. Small circles 
will be formed near the top of the cone, while large ones will be 
projected near the base of the cone. By altering the cutting angle of 
the beam of light it is possible to illustrate the various manifestations 
of the conic sections, including ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas. The 
string cylinder can be made to modify its form into hyperboloids and 
finally into a double cone by the expedient of twisting the two base discs 
in opposite directions. A spring device installed at the centre of one 
of the circles will keep the strings taut with a corresponding up or 
down fluctuation of this disc. String models can also be used to demons¬ 
trate sections of regular solids, for parallel strings can be strung 
across the required surface.

One of the most interesting types of space models might be 
termed the "Multi-Model Construction Set** for it has been found possible 
to illustrate every space problem contained in the mathematics course 
whether it is in Algebra I, Geometry I, Algebra II, or Trigonometry and 
Plane Geometry I. The set may be constructed by anyone, for it consists 
merely of an ordinary fanning-mill screen mounted on an elevated frame, 
a variety of wooden uprights and walls (small sections of screen), and 



A STRUSG MODEL IN USE 

A parallel beam of light projected on a string model 
will provide variable models, as well as producing 
any desirable conic section, 

a variety of colored elastics to act as lines. It has been found that 
old broom hangles cut into a variety of sizes and painted fitting colors 
prove suitable uprights. The bolt-nut terminal of the positive carbon 
pole of an ordinary dry cell can be driven into the ends of these broom-

handle sections to furnish a way of rapidly attaching the rods to the 
screen grid* The holes in the screen grid and eye-screws located at 
strategic positions on the uprights form lightning-fasteners for the 
metal-tab terminals of the elastic bands. Metal collars can be used to 
superimpose one upright on another. It would take very little artistic 
ability to color the screen-grid to represent a river flowing across a 
plain, while the broom-stick sections could be colored in a variety of 
ways to imitate mountain peaks, hills, trees, flag-poles, telegraph- 
poles, or bridge-piers. Distances in space, or along the ground can be 
represented by the colored elastics. It is also possible to set up the 
problem according to some appropriate scale, for the openings in the 
screen-grid are equally spaced. Additional material for this multi-model 
construction set might include a mariner’s compass for directional 
problems, and a light-source for shadow and light problems® The entire 
teaching procedure is simplified, for in place of referring to invisible 
lines, angles, triangles, the teacher can refer t© the green triangle, 
or the red angle of elevation, etc. If the multi-model construction 
set is placed in the hands of the students the results are really sur¬ 
prising, for problems that heretofore could not be understood by the 
students are worked with relative ease, and the results secured are 
always within the realm of ’’reasonableness”. ha a relatively shcrt time, 
depending upon the ability of the boy or girl, the majority of the students 
will set aside the basic ’’concrete 1 * set-up and utilize abstract pictures, 
result — the margin of the abstract has been extended through 
broadening the base of concrete experiences®

Plane figures usually do not cause the student very much 
difficulty as far as recognition is concerned but here again a variety 
of neat, large, well-colored models should be available for ready ref¬ 
erence, The following plane models ©re required for the Alberts course- 
rectangles (5 types), circle, square, parallelogram, trapezoid, ellipse.

and then mounted on an appropriate background. As one of the difficulties 
with plane figures seems to be associated with ^properties* it would be 
advisable to set up the "plane figure* from the standpoint of its chief 
functional characteristic, say area. To illustrate what is meant by

the foregoing, here is a suitable method of fashioning a model of a 
circle to be used principally for teaching areas 

Secure a suitable piece of leather and cut out a circle of 
approximately one foot in diameter. Next cut this circle into two

semicircles, and divide each semicircle into a large number of equal 
sectors. This division may be accomplished by cutting from the centre 
of the leather to within one-quarter of an inch of the circumference* 

In straightening out each semicircle by bending at the ends of the small 
arcs, the sectors of one semicircle may be fitted into those of the 
other to form an approximate parallelogram. The area of a parallelogram 
is the base times the altitude, but as the base is one-half of the 
circumference and the altitude is the radius, the area of the circle

becomes t?r • The assembling and the dismantling of the circle may be 
readily performed if a couple of metal strips and the necessary comp¬ 
lement of bolts and thumb screws are used to fasten the two semicircles 
near their outer edges. It also would be advisable to use some washers 
and a set screw to hold the apexes of the sectors in position at the 
centre of the circle. 

The majority of models to illustrate the Theorem of Pythagoras 
may be criticized on the basis of w laek of flexibility** for they are non- 
operational devices and usually apply to the 3-4-5 type of right triangle. 
The 3-4-5 type of triangle is misleading as introductory material, for 
the students believe that any three consecutive numbers will apply to any 
right-angled triangle. It is a simple procedure to provide pairs of 
hinges for each side of the (5-12-13) right-triangle, hence, by attaching 
or removing the squares, flexibility is permitted. An ingenious device 
is to use a film-slide projector and superimpose the necessary squares 
on any type of right-angled triangle. The M siide w in this case would 
consist of an ordinary film-slide frame ruled off into squares. 

Probably the best method of showing the Theorem of Pythagoras 
is to construct a variety of right-angled triangles and then ask the 
students to build the necessary squares on the base, on the altitude, 
and on the hypotenuse of each triangle from inch-square blocks. In 
addition, permit the child to try this square building technique with 
triangles other than right-angled triangles. The triangles and the 
blocks may be cut out of plywood, masonite, or even cardboard. It should 
not require many examples of this type of work before the child will

realize that the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the 
squares on the other two sides, and that this theorem applies 
exclusively to right-angled triangles. 



THEOREM OF PYTHAGORAS 

These flexible operational devices may be used to illustrate 
the Theorem of Pythagoras. 

Any type of flexible plane model may be constructed from 
grooved metal strips and set-screws. Metal linkages are advisable but 
wood, cardboard, or masonite strips may also be used. In this way it is 
possible to obtain an infinite variety of sizes and shapes of triangles,

quadrilaterals or polygons. The metal strips are colored and scaled on 
the inside for direct reading of the length of the sides, while a 
transparent protractor can be used to procure the necessary angle 
measurements* Colored elastic threads can b© hooked magnetically to any 
desired vertex or side. A multitude of properties and relationships 
involving angles, sides, medians, altitudes, segments, diagonals can. be 
discovered, illustrated or checked with this device. If two or more 
patterns or such figures are employed, a suitable means of studying 
congruency and similarity is provided* The linkage device provides a 
ready means of teaching the H Ambiguous Case Triangles* 1 , for using the 
data given, the teacher or preferably the student can demonstrate 
concretely whether 2, or 1, or no triangle can be constructed. A 
modification of the above flexibility may be employed in certain problems 
by using pin points instead of set-screws, thus permitting deformability 
without sliding motion* In this way the true conception of an angle as 
an amount of rotation is derived and such elements as vertex, initial 
and terminal lines are illustrated. A few other fundamental concepts 
that may be demonstrated by these dynamic linkages include, the locus 
of points, that the area of a parallelogram depends upon its altitude 
rather than width, the theory of parallel lines (alternate angles, 
supplementary angles, and exterior-interior opposite angles), the con¬ 
gruent triangles, and similar triangles. 

Math-o-Felt - The principle of this unique device, which may 
be used in proving theorems or in solving exercises, is the use of 
geometric figures made of several attractive colors of felt and placed

METALLIC LINKAGES. 

Any size and type of plane geometric figure may be constructed 
readily with this device. It facilitates the ^proof® of any 
theorem* 

on a felt base. The felt background may be attached to the blackboard 
and the other pieces, in the shapes of geometric figures placed upon it* 
These stick to the background by pressure alone, so no tacks or adhesives 
are used. A set of ten felt letters can be used to identify the parts 
of the diagrams. The figures may b© placed on top of each other, or 
overlapped to any desired degree, and they will still adhere. A complete 
set of these felt figures may be produced in several colors for contrast, 
attractiveness and ease in identification. The figures can be built up 
speedily and manipulated with due regard for the maintenance of size and 
shape. 


The greatest use of this felt device will be in the discussion 


of plane geometry theorems and exercises concerning superimposing of

figures* composition and decomposition of areas and equal non-congruent 
areas. The disadvantages in the use of the math-o-felt may be seen in 
the fact that lines and angles in the figures are not so easily designated, 
and that there are limitations to many of the common diagrams* 

The straight-line theorems that compose the major portion of the 
course in the grade twelve plane geometry can be made life-like by the 
introduction of tangible points and lines* A half-inch mesh screen, si^e 
3 f x 4 f t painted white, can be mounted on a frame, and when placed on the 
blackboard ledge provides a concrete grid for graph-work on the straight 
line. Colored elastic bands terminating in hook-tabs enable these tangible 
lines to b© arranged between any set of coordinates. The theories which 
originally were very difficult for the student to comprehend or to prove 
within the world of reality, can now be assimilated with some degree of 
facility* Geometric formulas pertaining to length, mid-points, ratios, 
gradients, lengths of perpendiculars, triangles, quadrilaterals, and loci 
can be proved and learned with some certainty* 

The wire grid and the elastic linkages can be employed, to 
demonstrate any type of plane figure required in the Geometry I course, 
while the selection of suitably colored elastics in these diagrams will 
simplify the proof of the majority of theorems and exercises* Instead 
of referring to the sides of triangles as AB or BO, it is probably 
simpler and more effective to indicate the red or the blue sides* 

Flexible wire models of parabolas prove an interesting device 
for teaching these figures in Algebra I, in Algebra 2, or in Analytic

WIRE-GRAPH CHART. 

Tangible figures may be constructed on this graph chart with 
colored elastic linkages. 

Geometry I. As a starting point, the students plot the simplest type of 
parabola y * x** on the blackboard or on large sheets of drawing paper* 
Then the students take lengths of colored wire and superimpose them on 
the drawn parabolas so when they pick up their wire models they will have 
parabolas of y = x that can be readily moved. The progressive logical 
change in the parabola formula: say through the following routine; y « x , 
y a ax^ f y s 1 k, y = (x . 1)^ - k and y a • a(x 1 1)““ - ks will 


necessitate corresponding changes in the student’s wire parabola, i.e

whether it is narrow or broad, the position of its vertex along the w y w 
or "x M axis, and eventually whether it opens upward or downward. This 
same graph scheme may be employed in teaching the circle, the ellipse or 
the hyperbola® Start with the simplest wire model possible (constructed 
by each student from the eouation) and then gradually progress towards the 
more complicated type of figure, changing one variable in the equation at 
a time, making certain that the students draw a parallel between the 
changing equation and the changing figure. In addition to teaching the 
concept of functionality, the contribution of these devices to seeing 
things as a whole in all their relationships puts the flexible models in 
step with sound teaching methods as advocated by^ educational psychologists. 
There appears to be no uncertainty or lack of interest in the minds of 
the young students when the "living world 91 unfolds itself before their very 
eyes in the form of these pulsating geometric conclusions.

CHAPTER III 

A MATHEMATICS LABORATORY 

So static and traditional have we been in our teaching of 
mathematics, that it has taken the armed forces and industry to show us 
the values of laboratory techniques in aiding the teaching of mathematics« 
Out of 140 Alberta high schools surveyed there does not appear to be a 
single school that can boast of an exclusive mathematics laboratory* This 
situation is not prevalent in Alberta alone, for the results of the ,} North 
American Survey” indicate that mathematics laboratories in Canadian and 
American high schools are few and far between* If you study the appendix 
tt Table of Results of the North American Survey” you will conclude that 
although the educational authorities are definitely interested in the 
proposal of establishing mathematics laboratories, very few provinces or 
states are willing, or have been willing, to take the necessary step 
forward* 


The author believes that, if the objectives as laid down by 
the Alberta Department of Education are to be achieved, the presentation 
of the subject matter in the mathematics classes should be complemented 
by the facilities in a mathematics laboratory* It is a disputable point 
whether it is advisable to design laboratory exercises to lead up to any 
required theorem or formula, rather than to permit the students to use 
the laboratory as a proving ground after the teacher has indicated the 
theorem or formula. Nevertheless, the majority of teachers will be able 
to find effective ways and means of supplementing the classroom teaching 
routine with some forms of laboratory activities*

If the classroom assumes the nature of a laboratory, it is 
paramount that the teacher have equipment which he and the pupils may use* 
All too frequently in Alberta schools the only equipment in a mathematics 
classroom are blackboard, chalk, eraser, paper and pencil. This type of 
equipment may be conductive in producing a pipil whose knowledge of 
mathematics comes from pencil-paper manipulation and not from a knowledge 
of ideas. The former probably results in the acquisition of skills but 
the latter leads to meaningful mathematics. There is little opportunity 
for discovery and development of insight into mathematics when the only 
material a pupil possesses is a sheet of paper* and a pencil. He should 
use these things after he has discovered the procedure or process, and not 
learn the process in a mechanical manner by working a large number of 
examples. Under ordinary circumstances meaning, understanding, and reality 
must be manifest in terms of the pupil and his width of experience. The 
mathematics laboratory eould perform this function® 

In general, five types of laboratory activities are adaptable 
to the Alberta mathematics courses, namely, drafting exercises, model 
construction, laboratory experiments, field exercises and motivation 
activities. The teacher of mathematics in introducing these laboratory 
exercises will be challenged in the following respects: 

(l) Whenever there is misunderstanding on the pert ©f the 
students it is advisable to go back to the concrete illustrations from 
which the abstractions emanated. (2) Introduce social situations in the 
mathematical problems in such a way that the pupil will live the situation, 
or in other words elucidate the "cold print" of a mathematical problem and

will mathematics teachers eventually succeed in developing the social and 
mathematical meaning which will ultimately result in socio-functional 
competence. 


HIGH SCHOOL DRAFTING EQUIPMENT 
Dividers, drawing board, t-gquare, set square, protractor and 
compasses make up the drafting equipment# 


I* Drafting exercises can be adapted to any of the mathematics courses, 

for example: 


Geometry I - scale drawings, triangle measurements, distance and 
bearing, loci problems, angle measurement in circles, the right-

angled triangle, the discovery of properties of geometric figures 
by drawings* 

Algebra I - signed numbers, construction of conic sections, graphing 
of quadratic equations, square root* 

Algebra II - geometric progression, arithmetic progression, limits, 
gradients, maxima-minima, ratio and proportion, application of 
algebraic formulas, differentiation (area under a curve), mechanical 
drawings. 

Trigonometry - Analytical Geometry - scale drawings, trigonometric 
functions, ambiguous case triangles, triangle solutions, and the 
entire analytical geometry course including the straight line, the 
circle, the parabola, the ellipse, and the hyperbola. In all these 
drafting exercises the essential outcome is w the discovery made**, 
not the proof, or even the name for the figure. The War Surplus 
Stores Limited of Canada have been offering complete sets of 
drafting instruments originally valued at #12*00 for a nominal sum 
of two dollars* The teachers of mathematics laboratory, would do 
well to purchase a few sets for their mathematics laboratory for they 
are complete and are very serviceable* 

II* Model Construction of plane or space figures can be utilized to 
discover generalizations of fundamental mathematical facts* Balsa wood, 
string, leather, cardboard, plaster of peris, plexiglass, masonite, 
plasticine, wire, modelling clay, plywood, construction paper or even 
ordinary soap, form the media for the construction of these models. There 
are several phases of model construction that are applicable to the

experiments have been highly developed at the university level, but very 
few laboratory manuals in mathematics are available at the high school 
level. A mathematics laboratory should aim to formulate experiments 
with equipment from the fields of science, and industry, which illustrate 
mathematical principles. Sueh experiments must be administered in the

mathematics laboratory, or sight will be lost of the fact that the experiments 
performed elsewhere are performed for their mathematical context. Under 
the present mathematical set-up in Alberta it would be sufficient to select 
three or four experiments that would have a direct bearing on the major 
topics of the course. The Algebra II experiments might include a study 
of gradients, proportion, series, variations, differentiation and integration. 
Boyles* Law, Charles* Law, or Resistance Box apparatus for the study of 
variations; the pendulums and stop-watches for series; acceleration car 
and the inclined plane for gradients; and the microscope and light equipment 
for proportion. Examples from Algebra I and Geometry I might include: 
balances for investigating the properties of equations; micrometer scales 
for significant numbers; belts, gears, wheel and axle for circles; 
thermometer scales for signed numbers; and car headlights for conic 
sections. The teacher will be able to build up an entire course of 
laboratory experiments for each subject and for each class of students 
when he begins to think of science and industry in terms of mathematical 
relationships. Thus a few moments spent now and then in showing the 
application of mathematics to current scientific problems will create a 
lasting interest in the minds of the students* 

IV. The Afield exercise 11 type of laboratory work is slowly but surely 
gaining recognition among a few of the teachers of mathematics in Alberta. 

No doubt these teachers realize that if mathematics is to be meaningful 
and interesting, greater care must be taken to assure understandings that 
function in daily life. The first exercises utilized here would be the 
ones associated with simple measurements, as: laying out a softball diamond 
or tennis court, marking the ice for a hockey game, or preparing the

field exercises, viz: (l) Nineteenth Yearbook of the National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics, entitled ^ Surveying Instruments — Their History 
and Classroom Use 11 * The particular value of this book from the stand¬ 
point of the Alberta teacher, lies in the fact that it includes suitable

V. Motivation Activities - The Alberta course of study in mathematics 
makes provision for student differences in interests, abilities and needs. 
It is the teacher*s responsibility to apply these teaching principles of 
individual differences and motivation when planning the work for the day, 
or for the entire year. The criteria w try to fit the mathematics to the 
individual student rather than fitting the student to the mathematics” is

fundamental in successful teaching. Capitalize on the special interest 
of your students. If the student likes to draw or paint, use this talent 
in illustrating in color the laws of equations or loci; if he is mechanically 
inclined get him to assist you in constructing some of the teaching aids 
for the mathematics laboratory; if he is a thinker permit him to do the 
research work designing original mathematical equipment. Under such a 
division of interests each student makes a contribution to the mathematics 
class according to his peculiar abilities and interests, and this always 
makes for better mastery of subject matter, A written problem in the 
textbook will have much more meaning when a child begins to see it as a 
situation that has real meaning. If he can concoct a diagram of the 
situation, or illustrate it in some simple way according to his interests 
and motivations, he has transferred words into meaning, "The student 
will learn best through teaching methods that are tempered to his individual 
composition". 

Few rooms have been planned as mathematical laboratories, so any 
plan to establish and equip such a room in your local high school would 
be in the nature of a problem beset with opportunities for initiative. 

Make a modest beginning, say with a cupboard laboratory or a corner of the 
ordinary classroom, and through a co-operative effort on the pert of both 
the teacher and the students, a suitable mathematics laboratory should 
result. Success will attend the teacher who has the will to start such an 
enterprise* The majority of the schools in the province each have a few 
plane or space models, so it would be a simple matter to progressively 
augment these with other models, measuring instruments, blackboard devices, 
operational devices, etc. just as the need arises in the mathematics

classes. The suggested equipment list in the survey sheet has been 
selected on the bases of suitability for the Albert® courses, but the 
teacher with initiative can build up his own mathematics laboratory-- 
once the idea takes hold the results are usually very satisfying* The 
mathematics laboratory and equipment of the Chinook High School is the 
result of a co-operative activity among the students, parents and teachers* 

Very little mathematical equipment applicable to the high school 
level can be purchased through school supply houses or scientific 
companies in either Canada or the United States* This situation is due 
no doubt to the fact that laboratory mathematics in the secondary schools 
is a comparatively new idea. Out of twenty-five commercial establishments

surveyed for "mathematical equipment" only one firm, the Yoder Instruments 
(East Palestine, Ohio) produced satisfactory results• An examination of 
the Yoder Instruments’ price sheet will convince any mathematics teacher 
that the information contained therein is wrought with potential ideas 
for a mathematics laboratory. The Book Society of Canada ( 270-274 King 
Street West, Toronto 1) can supply both students’ and teacher’s mathematical 
models. These models are made of wood and are painted white, so they may 
be easily marked or cleaned. Strict attention has been given to detail, 
ensuring accuracy of proportion and beauty of shape. The teachers’ models 
are extra large, with the skeleton models receiving special attention as 
the joints are firmly secured. Teachers would be well advised to send for 
the Book Society’s catalogues, and make a study of their mathematical 
equipment. 


A brief discussion of some of the other essential features of 
a mathematics laboratory follows: 

Work Tables - These are roughly built tables, with large surface areas 
covered with thick tentest, cork matting, or masonite. It is possible to 
accomplish a good deal on such tables, for there is no need to worry about 
minor damages to the surfaces. The student is free to drive tacks, nails 
or screws into the table in order to set up any type of construction that 
may be required. 

Drafting Table - The drafting table should be built higher than an ordinary 
table, and placed in a well-lighted section of the room. If the surface 
is covered with double-diamond or plate glass, an excellent drawing

surface is provided. The War Surplus Stores limited of Canada stock a 
considerable amount of drafting material declared surplus by the armed 
services, and as much of this material is serviceable in the classroom, 
the author knows of no better way of providing a full complement of 
drafting tools at a reasonable price. 

Supply Cupboard - The laboratory supply cupboard should include everything 
that the student is apt to use in his experimental work. Material might 
include metal stripping, pieces of leather, boards, tin, string, rope, 
wire, plasticine, construction paper, odd pieces of masonite, plexiglass, 
tentest, plywood, balsa ?jood, plaster of paris, modelling clay, soap, glue, 
mucilage, bolts, nuts, eyescrews, staples, rubber bands, putty. A few 
simple tools, as, hammer, small saw, screw driver, pliers, knife, ruler 
(metric and English graduation), protractor, set-square, tape-measure, rasp, 
needle-and-thread, and a push-drill are made available for any construction 
activities in the laboratory. In fact, this feature of the mathematics 
laboratory might very well resemble a workshop. The main idea is to 
arrange the tools in a manner that will be conducive to good order and 
immediate availability. 

Display Space - A built-in multiplex fixture (ten leaves of tentest 
mounted in metal frames and bound together like pages in a book) provides 
an unobstrusive method of displaying mathematical material. Panels con¬ 
structed of tentest and located in strategic positions in the room are 
useful for displaying pictures of mathematicians, posters, charts and 
magazine illustrations. Display shelves built along a wall at the eye- 
level, and painted in white enamel to obtain the maximum benefits of

especially effective when the shelves are sectionalized and bear categorical 
names of specialized equipment as: measurement, area models, volume models, 
operational devices, field equipment, special interest models, etc. 


Mathematics Library - The mathematics library, which should be part and 
parcel of the laboratory, must contain more than mathematical texts, there 
should be histories of mathematics, popular editions of mathematics, 
biographies of mathematics, books on mathematical recreation, vocational 
guides, mathematical magazines, etc. Provision is made for any material 
that will stimulate the qualities of imagination, originality and initiative 
on the part of the teacher and the students. 4 detailed discussion of the 
mathematics library will be given in a future chapter.

Blackboards - Blackboards should be important appendages of a mathematics 
laboratory, but as the survey exhibited a paucity of modified blackboards 
the author offers a few suggestions relative to the construction and the 
use of these blackboards, 

(a) Three-plane blackboard - Do you try to represent three-dimensional 
problems by diagrams on the two-dimensional blackboard? Do you persistently 
take problems which occur in real life on a horizontal stir face and place 
them on the vertical plane of the blackboard? If you do, take a short 
plane trip, and as you gaze downwards on supposedly familiar localities, 
you will be struck with the unfamillsrity of the entire scene® The 
students are mystified in the same manner in their mathematics classes 
when the teacher attempts the transposition of space in perspective® k 
three-plane blackboard can be consturcted out of plywood, masonite or 
even cardboard by reproducing an exact miniatiire of the corner of a room 
minus the ceiling portion® The best results are secured when a metal 
framework is first erected and the three area-sections bolted to this 
superstructure® The inside surface of the plywood may be painted with 
blackboard paint, or else covered with slated cloth® The wings of this 
blackboard spread out very rapidly, so it would be advisable to restrict 
the size of the three-plane blackboard to usable proportions, or there is 
a grave danger of producing an unmanageable gargantua® As the tri-surface 
device is to be used at the eye level of the seated students it is 
necessary to tilt the blackboard forward to enable the students to have 
an unobstructed view of the ground area® This is accomplished by mounting 
the blackboard on an ordinary map stand, using a modified set-screw 
underneath the floor plane, and a notched metal strip at the top corner

regulate the angle of the forward slope. It goes without saying, that 
every three-dimensional or two-dimensional problem can be represented on 
this blackboard with a reality that can be translated readily into the 
child's existence* 



THREE-PLANE BLACKBOARD. 

ftroblem #17 on page 33 of the trigonometry text has been 
selected to illustrate how the blackboard is used. 

(b) Spherical Blackboards - Slated globes are indispensable for teaching 
such topics as latitude and longitude, principles of navigation, the 
sphere, sectional areas of spheres, integration, and certain branches of 
solid geometry. The spherical blackboard must possess a good, writing 
surface, be mounted on an adjustable stand, and rotate freely on its 
axis. The author was able to construct such a spherical blackboard, by 
first constructing cardboard rosettes and mounting them on an axis made

of bamboo. The result did not yield a perfectly shaped sphere, but by 
covering the cardboard with cheese cloth and applying a thickness of 
plaster of peris, a fair resemblance to a sphere was produced. The plaster 
of paris surface may be smoothed to any degree of perfection with a file 
and sand-paper, and when several costs of black or green slating paint are 
applied to this area, a suitable writing surface is provided. On the other 
hand if the mathematics teacher is proficient in needlecraft, two hemi¬ 
spherical sections of slate-cloth fitted to cover the ordinary school 
globe may be sewn. When these cloth-sections are provided with zippers 
it is a simple procedure to convert the geographical globe into a slated 
globe or visa versa. The use of colored chalk on the spherical blackboard 
will make for motivation and interest on the part of the scholars. 

(c) Graph Blackboards - These blackboards are especially prepared for 
graph or curve work, and although commercial houses have a variety of 
these graph charts for sale, the cost might be beyond the resources of the 
smaller high schools. On the other hand it is possible to purchase 
slated-eloth at about $1.50 per square yard, and if ruled with white 
lacquer, should provide a suitable graph chart. The recommended size of 
blackboard is 40 ins. by 50 ins., with the size of the outline 36 ins. 
by 36 ins., and the squares measuring one inch. The good sized margins 
allow sufficient space for notes, calculations, etc. The cloth should be 
mounted on wooden rollers at the top and bottom, with loops for hanging. 

It is advisable not to rule the ”x w and tt y w axes for this fixes the first 
quadrant, and as the majority of problems are graphed in this quadrant 
the working area is too limited for proficient graph-work. A polar co-

A SPHERICAL BLACKBOARD, 

A spherical blackboard is the first pre-requisite for the 
successful demonstration of problems in navigation and in 
solid geometry. 


An innovation in graph charts is the *Plastic-Pleted Blackboard 1 *, 
The grid is printed in black on a clear white background* The transparent 
plastic surface provides a writing surface of glass-like smoothness on 
which one may write or draw with wax crayons* The surface can be wiped 
clean with a soft dry cloth as frequently as desired, while washable inks

can be used and removed with soap and warm water. The outlines are 
beneath the plastic surface so they do not wear off. These plastic- 
plated charts are mounted on l/4 M laminated mounting boards and are 
durably bound with extra heavy tape* 

Grill Blackboard - Any hardware store can supply window screening in which 
the stiff wires composing the screen-grid intersect, leaving squares that 
measure one inch or more. If the grid (3 ft. by 3 ft.) is mounted on a 
special frame, a tangible graph-chart is the result. The lines on this 
special blackboard are represented by suitably colored elastic cords, and 
as these elastics have metallic T-ends, it is possible to lock them in 
the surface of the grill without tying a knot, simply fey placing them 
around any wire intersection. This device provides a concrete manifestation 
of graphology, which otherwise may be wrought with uncertainty* The grill- 
blackboard has been found useful in teaching such Algebra II topics as 
emperical gormulae and gradients. In the latter the variations in slope 
may be shown simply by shifting the elastics. 

(e) Moto-Matfa - This apparatus invented by Professor J. Seth and distributed 
by Yoder Instruments, is designed to speed up the illustration of intuitive 
and demonstrative geometry and trigonometry problems. It consists of a 
blackboard graph chart 30 " x 3Q W with 1000 holes (one at each intersection), 
special pins to insert in the holes where desired, and rubber bands to 
stretch over the pins. Thus any figure may be constructed in the matter 
of seconds* The size and shape of the figures may be changed instantly, 
and this flexibility gives it the animation of motion pictures. Supp¬ 
lementary material sold with the Moto-Math includes: parabola, ellipse.

GROUHB GRAPH-CHART* 

The lime-msrked ground is used as 8 graph-chart, with the 
pupil acting as the "point 


and hyperbola drawing instruments; airplanes for navigation problems; a 
12-inch circle in 16 sectors; a rectangle 11 w by 7" in three triangles 
to teach the area of a rectangle, a parallelogram and a triangle; and 
two congruent trapezoids to teach areas*

pin holes through ordinary brown wrapping paper to represent a rectilinear 
graph 36 ins. by 36 ins. The squares can be made any size, but it is 
advisable to limit them to 1 inch or l|- inches in width. The spacing of 
the holes comprising the individual square will allow for a subdivision 
of the square into any desired fraction. By holding this improvised 
stencil against the blackboard and then rubbing a used blackboard eraser 
over the surface, one can stencil the small dots onto the blackboard 
through the holes in the chart. When the chart is removed the dots can 
be seen on the blackboard forming the outline of the lines of a graph. 

This method of reproducing the grid on the blackboard is very convenient 
for a class working at the blackboard. Heretofore, graphical blackboard 
work was a matter of guess-work, but the blackboard graph-stencil should 
provide a rapid and accurate means of reproducing grids, thus assuring 
both teacher and pupils good graphology* 

Glass-Enclosed Exhibit Space - In order to popularize mathematics throughout 
the school a glass-enclosed exhibit space is an important adjunct of a 
mathematics laboratory. Items which have a practical appeal should be 
displayed and briefly explained by means of a well-written bulletin. 

Interest in this phase of mathematics can only be maintained if the exhibits 
are changed frequently, say once every two weeks. The list of articles 
placed on exhibit might include an abacus, navigation equipment, various 
measuring devices, novel methods of finding areas and volumes of common 
geometric figures, world calendar, Ohm’s law calculator and various 
instruments of applied mathematics. 


Supports - The majority of real demonstrations in the laboratory require

up to driven nails, screws and a tremendous amount of rough usage. In the 
ordinary laboratories the construction engineer forgets that real experiments 
have to be performed, and as a consequence the teacher is unable to drive

MATHEMATICS IN DAILY LIVING* 

The art of papering a house is learned and practiced by 
students of the Chinook High School* 

nails or erect equipment for fear of damage to the tables, walls or floor* 
The teachers of mathematics must realize the potential possibilities of a 
real work-room, rather than a faith in inane equipment* 

Another form of necessary support may be erected by stoutly 
anchoring perpendicularly a steel-pipe between the floor and the ceiling* 
The pipe may be used as an apparatus rod carrying its full complement of 
clamps or rings* 

Thus with durable perpendicular and horizontal supports, the 
mathematics teacher has at his disposal the first requisite for successful 
experimental and demonstration work*

A MORATORY EXERCISE*

Future Mathematics laboratories - It is in the construction of new 
schools that best arrangements for mathematics laboratories can be made, 
so the teacher of mathematics must be an active consultant in draughting 
the blue-prints of future Alberta schools. For the present, the teacher 
must harbour the inadequate space facilities for teaching mathematics, or 
else convert a portion of a classroom, cloakroom or even a hall into a 
mathematics laboratory. With proper equipment, mathematics can be taught 
so that the pupils gain an increasing appreciation of it in the inter¬ 
pretation of the physical universe and in the affairs of human living* 

We are living in a world which is mathematical, and must in a similar 
token present this mathematical world to the child. Teachers should feel

CHAPTER IV 
OPERATIONAL DEVICES 

There is something lethergic about fixed models, and as a 
consequence such devices suffer considerably as vital teaching aids# It 
is a recognized fact that commercial or industrial exhibitors at the Calgary 
or Edmonton fairs assemble their exhibits in a manner which will attract 
the maximum number of patrons. Very few people, outside the commercial 
advertisers, realize that the best results are secured when motion is 
introduced. People are more prone to stop and to study an exhibit in 
which there is motion, whether it is created by novel lighting effect or 
by actual moving parts* The exhibitor knows that more people will push 
the button that turns on a light than will look if the light burned steadily. 
The human being appears to be biologically and psychologically constituted 
to respond more effectively to objects in motion than to those at rest* 
Surely, we as teachers, should incorporate this fundamental principle of 
the commercial display world, end introduce operational devices in the 
mathematics classes rather than the static aids* A reporter describing 
the equipment in the Chinook High School Mathematics laboratory said, 
"Everything moves, everything is hinged and comes apart and fits smoothly 
together againft 

The operational devices which have been tried successfully 
within the realm of the Alberta Programme of Studies in Mathematics are 
described below; others have been described in the previous chapter on 


models

Trigonometric Function »Yheel - It is difficult by means of blackboard 
diagrams to develop the idea of ’’functional change relationships” in 
trigonometric ratios* Failure to develop this concept adequately is one 
of the basic causes for the difficulties which arise throughout the 
trigonometry course* The trigonometric function wheel was designed to 
simplify the understanding of the following mathematical concepts* 

(1) Trigonometric functions, 

(2) Changes in the sign of the functions from quadrant to quadrant, 

(3) Expressing functions of obtuse and reflex angles in terms of 
functions of acute angles. 

(4) Functional dependence on the size of the angle® 

The trigonometric function wheel consists essentially of an 18 w 
circle of masonite, a strip of plexiglass (with a sharp black line down 
the middle) mounted at the center of the circle so that it can be revolved 
as a radius vector, and a metal strip mounted loosely near its one-third 
point of suspension at the extremity of the radius strip so that it can be 

kept continuously vertical as the vector is revolved. The weight of the 

o © 

metal strip will keep it upright over the range from 0 to 180 , but from 
180 ° to 360° it is necessary to add a weight to the small end of the rod, 
thus lowering the center of gravity of the rod, and keeping it upright over 
the desired range. A flat contact spring attached to the reverse side of 
the radius vector axis and sliding along the circumference of the circle 
will provide a system of control, enabling the operator to brake the radius 
at any desired point. The horizontal and vertical axes are painted in 
different colors in order to facilitate the identification of the positive

or negative directions. All that remains to be accomplished now is to 
graduate the horizontal and vertical axes and the radius vector into units 
of one-tenth of an inch. The circle itself is divided into degrees. The 
mathematics teacher will undoubtedly see that the trigonometric function 
wheel is adaptable to a variety of principles and problems that occur in 
Chapter IX of Geometry I course, and throughout the entire course in 
Trigonometry and Plane Geometry I. 



A TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTION WHEEL. 

A trigonometric function wheel is used to develop the idea of 
functional change relationships w in trigonometric ratios. 

Dual-Directional Line Tracer - High school students often find difficulty 
with the terms "approaching infinity” or "limit". The author believes 
that this hardship eminates from the fact that the majority of the teachers 
attempt to teach "approaching infinity” within the realm of boundaries—

i.e. the classroom. It is suggested that, first, the **x M and **y w axes be 
tramped out on the snow-covered ground until they extend for a quarter of 
a mile or more. Then, using the students as points, the teacher could 
dispatch the children in manoeuvres of curve tracing that would ultimately 
lead them to a comprehension of such terms as approaching infinity and 
approaching a limit. The teacher can provide the necessary words of 
instruction and the music for inarching by means of a public address system.

DUAL-DIRECTIONAL LINE TRACER* 

This is an automatic device to guide a moving point within the 
range of two directions* viz, M x w and n f(x) n « 

Three students are required to operate the tracer, viz., the dispatcher, 
the independent variable director, and the dependent variable director. 

The dispatcher indicates the particular section of the curve to fee sketched, 
say H as x approaches 2 from the positive side, the f(x) approaches minus 
infinity*. The x-student steers the tracer towards two, while at the same 
moment the f(x)-student directs it towards minus infinity* The result of 
this combination of forces results in the required curve, for the ball 
bearing traces the path on the blackboard or the paper* The student

Light Source - Powerful, concentrated beams of light are necessary to 
obtain any worthwhile results in demonstrating sun or shadow problems. A 
parabolic light-reflector complete with a 150-watt blue bulb provides a 
fair substitute for the sun. The installation of a pivot joint at the 
point of attachment of the variable stand and the reflector enables the 
experimentalist to obtain any desired elevation or angle of depression* 

A protractor could be mounted rigidly on the stand, thus providing a 
ready-reckoner for these angles of depression or elevation of the sun. 

The arrangement recommended above is identical with that employed by the

Area Concents and Relationships - The meaning of w area H may be attained 
by having the students divide a rectangular sheet of cardboard into 
squares, cut out the squares and count them® These operations should be 
performed many times, using paper or cardboard of various shapes® Another 
method is to divide into squares the rectangular surface area of common 
objects in the classroom, as book covers, desk surfaces, window sills, 
window panes, and then count these squares® The child is now ready to 
establish meanings of a higher order, based on the symbolization of these 
basic meanings*

Area of a Parallelogram - A parallelogram may be constructed of masonite, 
with the portion representing a right-angled triangle cut off. It is 
easily shown that if this part of the parallelogram were placed at the 
opposite side of the model, the resulting figure would be a rectangle 
having the base equal to the base of the parallelogram. The area of any 
parallelogram is hence equal to the product of the base and its altitude. 

Area of a Triangle - Cut out of masonite or plywood two congruent triangles 
and place them together in such a way as to form a parallelogram. Hence 
the area of one of the triangles is half the parallelogram. 

If a plywood triangle is dissected along the top, parallel to the 
base and bisecting the altitude, the top section may be fitted to the 
bottom portion to form a parallelogram with the base equal to the base of 
the triangle and the altitude equal to one-half the altitude of the 
triangle. There are a variety of ways of setting up these cut-out figures 
to show simple area. 

Area of the Trapezoid - A plywood trapezoid may be cut crosswise between 
the two parallel sides. Now if the upper portion is placed adjacent to the 
lower section an elongated parallelogram is formed. The area of the trap¬ 
ezoid, now the parallelogram, is evidently the sum of the two bases 
multiplied by one-half the altitude. 

Two congruent trapezoids may be placed adjacent to each other tc 
form a parallelogram, thus again showing that the area of one of these 
trapezoids would be one-half of the parallelogram.

Cut off one of the base corners of the trapezoid through the 
midpoint of the non-parallel side and parallel to its opposite side. 
Place this cut-off triangle adjacent to the top of the trapezoid, and a 
parallelogram will be formed. 


Area of a Circle - Che method of giving meaning to the area of a circle has 
been already described in Chapter II, i.e. the leather circle changed into 
a parallelogram. Here is another novel method of demonstrating the same 

thing® 



S ECTIONALIZED AREAS. 

Appropriately colored plywood sections to teach progressively 
the area of a parallelogram, a triangle and a trapezoid.

A wooden box about two inches deep is covered with glass. In 
one side of the box is a depressed circlej in the other is a depressed 
area composed of 3q squares with the length of the side of each square 
being equal to the radius of the circle. The surface of the circle is 
completely covered with shot which can be poured over to the other side and 
shaken down so that it exactly covers the surface of the squares. This 
shows that the actual surface covered fey the circle is equivalent to that 
covered by the squares. 



AREA OF A CIRCLE DEVICES. 

Two entirely different operational devices are in use to 
discover the area of a circle. 


Areas of Cylinders and Cones - As various models of cylinders and cones are 
available in the mathematics laboratory* it should be a simple procedure 
to have the students wrap a piece of cloth or paper about the cylinder or

cone, and when the cloth is unrolled the area is obviously evident. In 
other words the area of the curved surface of the cylinder is the product 
of the circumference of the base and the altitude of the cylinder. While 
the area of the sector derived from the cone is one-half the circumference 
of its base times the slant height® 

Area of the Sphere - Take a solid hemisphere, and drive a pin at the centre 

of the cross-sectional circle and another one at the vertex of the 

hemisphere. Wind a stout cord around the nail at the centre of the circle 

until the coil of string covers the cross-sectional circle. Using another 

section of the same type of cord, wind it about the nail-vertex of the 

hemisphere until the entire surface of the hemisphere is covered. When 

the two lengths of area-cord ©re compared the circle area-string is one- 

half the hemisphere area-string, or in other words the area of the circle 

is one-half the area of the hemisphere. Consequently, the surface area of 

o 

the whole sphere is four times the area of the circle (4wr^)® 

The "cord-area ?! scheme outlined above, can be used with facility 
to obtain the area formulas for cones, cylinders, etc. 

Volumes - The concept of volume, and the relationships existing between 
various kinds of volume, can be made meaningful only if the child has 
personal experiences with such mathematical concepts. The writer has 
discovered that a set of tin models representing every type ©f volume, can 
be constructed easily, and using beans or rice as the filler for these 
models, every relationship and concept in volume may be derived and 
\mderstood® The models should be constructed so as to maintain a

ment in a tin box of even dimensions until the "rectangular volume" or box 
is filled# The number of one-inch cubes would represent the volume# This 
experiment not only leads to the formulas length x width x height of

(2) Pyramids end Cones - A tin pyramid having the same height and base as 
a solid may be filled with a suitable filler to show its volume. It will 
require the contents of three of the pyramids to fill the rectangular 
container. Thus it may be shown that the volume of a pyramid equals on©* 
third of that of a rectangular solid having the same base and altitude® 

The same method may be employed with a cons and a cylinder to show that the 
volume of a cone equals one-third of the volume of a cylinder® 



VOLUME MODELS. 

This set of tin models is used to demonstrate volume 
relationships by ^pouring" rice from one model into another® 

(3) Cylinder - If a tin box is constructed with the base equal in area 
to the curved surface of the cylinder, and the altitude equivalent to 
the radius of the base of the cylinder, it should be a simple matter to 
demonstrate that it will require the contents of two of the cylinders to

fill the box* The volume of the box will be calculated as 2wr n, so the 
volume of the cylinder should be one-half of this or wr^h# 

(4) Sphere - A cone having a base area equivalent to that of a hollow 
hemisphere and its altitude equal to the radius of the sphere, will once 
and for all, overcome the difficult concept of the volume of a sphere* Zn 
addition, this apparatus will provide a thread of meaning to the oft- 
memorized but not understood formula 4 /3 w r * Experimentally, it will 
require two such cones of rice to fill the hemisphere, or four cones in 
all to fill a whole sphere. The volume of the cone may be derived in the 
manner explained in a previous section, so the volume of the sphere would 
be four times this, or 4/3 ti r * 

Stereographs - One of the chief difficulties in teaching geometry or 
trigonometry is the visualization of the third dimension from drawings* 
Such drawings when viewed through a stereoscope show the third dimension 
very clearly and thus greatly aid in the understanding of the properties 
of lines, curves or solids in space in relation to their three coordinate 
planes* 


Teachers and authors of textbooks are fully aware of the need of 
aiding the pupil in his effort to visualize the ways of shading to bring 
into relief the required planes. The student is often required to construct 
models to give them training in space imagination* Many textbooks 
supplement the diagrams with photographic copies of the required models* 

If used with extreme care such devices are effective, but if 
pupils spend too much time making models they will sidetrack the proof of

theorems and exercises which, after all, form the major part of the 
Geometry I course. The number of models which pupils make must necessarily 
be limited, and ready made models are a poor substitute for them. A wide 
use of photographic pictures constitutes a serious danger to training in 
space perception since they may deprive the pupil of the effort to 
visualize the figures which the diagrams represent. 

"Diagrams in Three Dimension** by Dr. Breslich (Newson & Go. 
Chicago) supply a long felt need of Alberta pupils and teachers. The 
device consists of boxed sheets of 15 three-dimensional diagrams, with a 
colorscope as the viewing media, which shows spatial relationships as 
clearly as actual models. When the pupil has made a real effort to 
understand the flat two-dimensional diagrams in the textbook and fails, 
he must be given some assistance. "Diagrams in Three Dimensions" when 
viewed through a simple ortho-scope make the figure stand out so clearly 
that his difficulty is automatically removed and he is able to proceed 
with his understanding. Furthermore, the students who surmise that they 
comprehend the diagram will be made to see it more clearly and will derive 
a degree of satisfaction from checking their inference against the diagram 
in three dimensions. 

"Diagrams in Three Dimensions" are applicable in the Alberta 
Mathematics Course when any of the following are under considerations 

(!) Portions of a sphere. 

(2) The volume of a sphere of radius "r" is 4/3 it r . 

(3) Pyramid cut by planes parallel to the base. 

(4) Volume of a triangular pyramid is equal to one-third the product

(6) The section of a sphere made by a plane is a circle. 

The solid geometry section contained in the Geometry I course should 
receive the required incentive if ^Diagrams in Three Dimensions* 5 are 
introduced by the teachers at the appropriate time. 


THE ORTHOSCOPE. 

A device for showing spatial relationships as actual models. 

Variations - In order to promote the understanding of variations in the 
minds of students, a careful association of the concrete and abstract 
concepts of variations should evolve from our teaching process* A good 
way of accomplishing this objective is by means of mechanical devices, 
each of which would demonstrate by means of visible movements a 
particular type of variation.

(1) Inverse linear function can be studied by means of a simple pulley- 
mounted on a board. Over the pulley is a cord with suitable weights on 
the ends. Between these weights on the board is a yard-ruler to measure 
the height of each weight from the bottom of the scale. The heights of 
each weight from the bottom may be labelled with any two variables, 

say "x M and H y B . These two distances represent the two interdependent 
variables. When f, x M equals w y*% the weights are both at the same level, 
but when w x w increases, B y ,f decreases correspondingly so that their sum 
is always a constant* Several readings of the variables in different 
positions on the scale may be recorded by the students, followed by the 
plotting of this data on graph paper or on the graph blackboard. 

(2) The direct linear function may be demonstrated by the use of a system 
or a train of two unequal gears* In this experiment, would represent 
the number of turns of the large gear, while the number of revolutions 

of the small gear would, indicate the B y B variable. It is not necessary 
to use the whole turns of the gears for fractional turns can be recorded 
as well by simply counting teeth* The students can now easily collect

shaped indentations on the lever permit the suspension of a metal platform 
on which convenient weights are placed. A small weight is suspended at

or 10 grams (y) at a distance of 4 inches (x)* The curve obtained by 
plotting the above data will be in the form of a hyperbola*

Permutetions-Combinstions Checkerboard - On© of the most intriguing 
devices to facilitate sound reasoning in an otherwise barren field is 
the Permutation-Combination Checkerboard. Combinations refer merely to 
the things chosen without regard to their order, while permutations refer 
both to the things chosen and their order, and as a consequence some 
tangible manipulative device must be employed to establish meaning* A

checkerboard similar to the one used in Chinese-checkers could provide a 
convenient holder for the "things”, whereas sets of colored marbles could 
impersonate the complete gamut of "things”. The checkerboard is colored 
to represent a variety of backgrounds, for example: tables, shelves, seats, 
teams of players, committees, car licenses, in fact, anything that may be 
designated in the exercises on permutations or combinations. The 
individuality of the ”things” can be resdiJLy characterized by selecting 
various colored marbles, or by making suitable crayon markings on these 
same marbles. If the problem states that 5 ladies and 5 gentlemen are to 
be seated at a round table with the ladies and gentlemen t® occupy 
alternate places, the students using ordinary chalk can depict the round 
table on the checkerboard. The ladies and gentlemen seated at the table, 
may be personified by red and blue marbles placed in their respective 
perforations. How, if the problem calls for the number of arrangements 
possible if we consider only the mutual positions of the guests, the 
student is able to manipulate his ”guests” with the facility of a magician, 
to derive the correct number of arrangements. Experience in using this 
Permutation-Combination Checkerboard has shown that relatively few 
concrete illustrations are necessary before the student grasps the true 
meaning of permutations and combinations and is more than willing to solve 
the remaining problems on the higher level of abstractions. 

Elements of Integration in Volume - In the manifold application of definite 
integrals it is necessary in the solution of almost every problem to select 
what is known as an element of integration \ it is therefore important that 
the child understand clearly the nature of an element of integration, and

that he know something about various ways in which it may be selected* 

The student up to this point comprehends the meaning of the 
term "area under the curve", yet it is very difficult for him to under¬ 
stand the type of geometric figure evolved when a small element of the 
area under the curve is rotated about the axis, A closed Christmas bell 
may aptly represent the area under a curve, while two strips of wood 
intersecting at right angles could represent the "x ! * and w y" axes*. When 
the entire bell or any portion of it is opened up about the selected 
axis, a cylindrical volume is generated before the eyes of the students. 

A closer examination of the solid will reveal that this "element of 

2 

integration" possesses a volume which may be represented by try Ax*

ELEMENT OF INTEGRATION MODEL. 

This is a tangible portraiture of the evolution of an element 
of integration on real IJ x u and ”y JI axes. 

If cardboard sections one-eighth of an inch In thickness are 
mounted on a suitable shaft, and then turned on a lathe into any desired' 
solid figure, the teacher will have a fair means of demonstrating how 
the elements of integration compose the required volume® The ellipsoid, 
sphere or any other volume may be shown as made up of a series of very 
thin discs, deformed at the edges to make each unit conform to the sur¬ 
face of the ellipsoid or sphere® It is now possible to draw an analogy 
between the n beXX-el@ment of integration 15 and the n cardboard-element of 
integration”. Since the elements of integration are mounted on a shaft, 
it is permissible to integrate over any desired range and about any axis, 
and a knitting needle conveniently inserted at any point between the

"elements” as the other axis* Even the volume of the explosive head of 
a torpedo indicated in problem 14 page 95 of the Algebra II text can be 
neatly demonstrated. The potential possibilities of these elements of 
integration models in the teaching process are sufficient to warrant a 

trial.

Circle-Theorem Board - Paint a circle on a piece of plywood and locate 
small wire brads along the circumference at intervals of about every 
one-quarter of an inch. This circle should be large enough to enable the 
students to see it from every pert of the classroom® In the areas out¬ 
side of the circle fasten a few small screw-eyes strategically located on 
the plywood* These "eyes” are to be used for stringing tangents and

secants to the circle. Another screw-eye should be inserted at the very 
centre of the circle. The required lines are formed by colored elastic 
bands* This Circle-Theorem Board may be used to set up all the figures 
for the propositions on the circle, as well as demonstrating any of the 
exercises based on the circle.

Triangle Specifications - It is understood that the sides or angles of a 
triangle must meet certain requirements for a triangle, vis., (1) an 
angle or the sura or two angles must be less than ISO 0 ; (2) no side may 
be greater than the sum of the other two. Here is one operational device 
for demonstrating these conditions# Fasten three strips of wood together 
by small metal hinges with the sum of the two shorter strips equal to the

longest strip. Various angle pieces to be held in place by the weight of 
the two upper strips are introduced during the process of constructing 
various triangles. Not only does this flexible triangle show triangle 
specifications, but in addition, the ambiguity cases as described in the 
trigonometry text may be demonstrated with a high degree of certainty. 

The ambiguous case is a nebulous entity in the minds of the majority of 
our high school students, and a concrete illustration of its possibilities 
would be one way of enhancing the teaching process. 

Altitude-Position Determiner - A 12-inch heavy line to represent the base 
of the common plane figure is painted on a large piece of masonite. A 
narrow elastic band which can be looped over pegs, leads from the ex¬ 
tremities of this base. A series of small wire brads are mounted on a 
narrow strip of plywood, and the whole is arranged so that the strip may 
be moved shuttle-fashion up and down on the masonite, and fixed at any 
point desired. When the elastic band is looped over the appropriate brads 
a variety of plane geometric figures may be produced—such as right- 
triangles, isosceles triangles, acute and obtuse triangles, parallelograms, 
trapezoids, rectangles, and rhorabi. The model is held upright, and when 
a plumb-bob is suspended from the vertex the position and the magnitude 
of the altitude with respect to the base is determined. The flexibility 
of the shuttle and the numerous brads, provide a means of producing an 
infinite number of geometric figures, so the students should have ample 
practice in determining the magnitude end. position of any altitude.

of cardboard or masonite. Now form a smaller triangle inside the first 
one by merely connecting the mid-points of the sides of the original 
figure. This triangle will be found to rest in the reverse position in 
comparison with the first one. The outline of this second triangle may 
be traced on a piece of cardboard, and cut out the same as the foundation 
triangle. This process of forming triangles is repeated until the inner¬ 
most triangle is too small to handle. The triangles are now painted in 
contrasting colors, and glued one upon the other to form a succession of 
triangles. These triangles stand alternately upright and reversed, and 
represent a geometric progression with the ratio l/2 as to the sides, 
and l/4 as to the areas. If the geometric progression commences with

the inner-most triangle and works outward, the ratio becomes 2 as to the 
sides, and 4 as to the areas• 

Devices of the kind described above will give the student an 
understanding of the term geometric progression, and he will associate the 
value of M r w , the common ratio, with something tangible* 

limits - The authors of the textbook^ used in the senior algebra course 
recommend that differential calculus be introduced to high school students 
through a consideration of secants and tangents* Some authorities would 
not agree with this plan, but from the standpoint of the immature 
student this method probably has much that would recommend it* 

Consider a curve (made by bending a wire) passing through the 
points A, B (represented by meccano-set wheels mounted on the wire)* The 
line AB (piece of wire linking the wheels) is a secant to this curve* 
Suppose that the point A is fixed and that point B moves along the curve 
toward Aj the secant AB will change its direction so as to come closer 
and closer to the recognized position of a tangent at the point A* The 
tangent may be seen readily taking the limiting position or simply the 
limit of AB as B moves along the curve towards A. 

The nature of the curve may be changed at will by shaping the 

double strand of wire, while the wheels mounted on the double tracks 
afford a good representation of moving points* If a good large model of 
this operational device is constructed, many of the following fundamental

THE CONCEPT OF LIMITS* 

The limiting position of a secant is demonstrated by an 
opera tiona1 devie e * 

understand the full significance of their operation* One practical method 
of demonstrating these rules of equality is to use the ordinary chemical 
balances and a set of colored -weights in which there is a certain degree 
of divisibility—say 20 grams, 10 grams, 5 grams etc. The operation of 
the balances is first demonstrated and explained to the students, so they 
will derive the concept that an equation is a statement showing that two 
expressions stand for the same number or value® Once the idea of an 
equation is effected, the natural course of events is to add equal weights 
to each balance, subtract equal weights, use multiples ©f each weight, 
and finally show the effect of the divisibility of weights on each side 
of the balance-equation® The demonstration is most effective when the

"equals", that are added, subtracted, multiplied or divided, are painted 
in identical colors. 

The "transposition of terms" can be shown effectively by the use 
of the colored "equation-balances". 

Maximum-minimum concept - Mount an eight-inch protractor on a stand, 
fasten a three-inch piece of wood along the zero line to represent the 
base AB of the triangle, and pivot a metal or wooden strip four inches 
long at the origin point of the protractor (side BC of the triangle) to 
form a flexible triangle. A string is passed through holes drilled at 
A and G, so playing out the string will lengthen AO while taking up the 
slack will shorten the side* In addition, a small plumb-bob is suspended 
by means of a piece of colored string from the vertex 0 to indicate the 
magnitude of the altitude of the triangle at any instance® It is now 
possible to trace the changes in the area of the triangle ABC as the 
angle ABC increases from 0° to 180° by simply rotating the arm BC. The 
area of the triangle can be calculated at any instance simply by reading 
the perpendicular height and multiplying this number by half the size of 
the base. Plotting the areas against the size of the angle ABC will 
produce a graph showing a maximum curve® 

The same idea can be employed in constructing a flexible parallel' 
ogram ABCD, with AB equal 10 inches and BG equal 7 inches® The area of 
the parallelogram may be traced to a maximum and back again to a minimum 
as the angle ABC increases from 0° to 180°,

EQUATION BALANCES 


Appropriately colored balances, red,on left side, and white 
on- the right side, are used to teach the fundamental axioms 
pertaining to equations* 

In the above account a sufficient number of the Chinook High 
School mathematical operational devices have been described in order to 
inspire interested teachers along similar lines* Initiative, the 
ability to persist, and the ability to secure a co-operative response 
from the students will spell success in this particular field of research* 
Pedagogy, psychology and experience in teaching demand that we introduce 
some demonstrative mathematics, in the sense of educating the pupil to a 
good understanding of mathematics, and in the ability to reason* The 
successful teaching highway in mathematics appears to be via the empiric

CHAPTER V, 

A MATHEMATICAL ATMOSPHERE 

Our high school students should be developing in themselves 
proper emotional attitudes by becoming conscious of the presence of 
mathematics in things all about them. The alert teachers will make their 
teaching of mathematics more effective by introducing into the classroom 
and into the school a mathematical atmosphere. To create a mathematical 
atmosphere is to establish a productive environment which will in turn 
instill a mathematical consciousness in the student. This mathematical 
consciousness will assist the student to recognize the presence of 
mathematics in all things about him, it will serve as an incentive for 
growth and development in mathematics, it will challenge the respect and 
appreciation on the part of the student for beauty, truth and power of 
mathematics, and it will make the child a more intelligent user of math¬ 
ematics* The student should be completely bereft of the attitude that 
mathematics as a subject is dull, uninteresting, hard, something forced 
upon them and something to be endured until enough credits have been 
obtained to meet the requirements for graduation. The ideal teaching 
situation demands that the students learn facts, and acquire skills, but 
at the same time retain the soul of the subject. This mathematical 
atmosphere will have an opportunity to flourish in the high schools where 
enthusiastic teachers are employed, where an active mathematics club 
exists, and where the class and laboratory are well ©quipped and made 
attractive by the addition of slogans, posters, models, book pamphlets and 
anything and everything of the mathematical world that it is possible to

secure for the students to touch, to handle, and to talk about and with 
which to experiment. 

libr ary - One of the objectives of good mathematics teaching is the 
stimulation of the use of reference material. Selecting and reading 
reference material should become habitual on the part of every student of 
mathematics. At the present time our high schools appear to exhibit a 
lethargic attitude towards the use of mathematics reference material. The 
average high school mathematics classroom probably contains two or three 
purely reference books, while under ideal conditions such a library would 
include material on applications of mathematics, historical information, 
philosophy of mathematics, books on method, periodicals, puzzle booklets, 
and a mathematics dictionary. A list of reference books which the author 
eonsiderd to be a minimum to good teaching are reviewed below. 

Ma thematics Pietionary - James, (B. Van Nostrand Company (Canada) Ltd., 

228 Bloor St,, Toronto 5, Ontario.) The dictionary covers completely the 
vocabulary of mathematics from arithmetic through integral calculus. All 
terms are clearly defined in language suited to the grade level of the 
students using the terms. Illustrative examples and figures appear 
frequently to further clarify the definitions. The advantage of the 
accessibility of such mathematical definitions, descriptions, facts and 
formulas is self-evident. 

A History of Mathematics - Gajori, (MacMillan Company of Canada Limited, 

70 Bond Street, Toronto 2, Ontario). A good history of mathematics is 
designed to make mathematics more understandable. The development of the

A MATHEMATICS LIBRARY, 

One of the objectives of good mathematics teaching is the 
stimulation of the use of reference material. 


mathematical process is explained from the primitive ideas of numbers to 
the most advanced concepts, from Thales and Pythagoras to the moderns,. 

These historical references and commentvS should be interwoven with the 
topical development of the year in a manner that shows the development 
of our civilization and the great part that mathematics has played in it. 
Such instruction is of cultural value and assists in arousing interest*

handbooks might be appropriately announced as written, w to help make the 
world love mathematics n . 

Algebra: An Interesting language —Breslich (Newson & Company, 72 Fifth 
Avenue, New York City 11). Shows your pupils how algebra is actually 
used in daily life. The informal presentation is supplemented by half¬ 
tone photographs and sketches on every page* Its explanations and model 
examples are particularly clear, and there are many evidences to support 
the claim that the book is an outgrowth ©f classroom experience. 

Surveying Instruments. Their Hi story and Classroom Us® . 19th Yearbook— 

E. R. Kiely (Bureau of Publications, Teachers® College, Columbia Univer¬ 
sity, 525 West 120th Street, New York City). It traces the development 
of surveying methods and instruments from earliest times to the 
present day. Alberta instructors will find it valuable because it will 
enable teachers to carry out most effectively a program of simple 
surveying. Numerous practical exercises are included, hence this book 
could be used as a laboratory manual in field exercises. 

Field Work in Mathematics --Shuster and Bedford (American Book Company, 

New York City). The great majority of our high school pupils have 
never had any practical experience in measuring lines and angles out-of- 
doors. Perhaps, a similar statement may be made concerning many of our 
teachers of mathematics. The reason for this situation is that measuring 
instruments of various kinds were formerly quit© expensive, while 
instruction for teachers in the use of such mathematics was not generally 
available. Fortunately, today many instruments suitable for use in

high-school classes may be had at reasonable cost, or manufactured locally. 
Instruction in the manufacture and the use of these instruments is 
provided in this book. If teachers will acquaint themselves with the 
uses of the measuring instruments described in this book, they will 
appreciate the many possibilities the book has for greatly increasing 
interest in mathematics on the part of all their pupils, and for making 
a far more vital and meaningful subject than it otherwise would be. 

Miscellaneous - In addition to the special reference books recommended 
above, the mathematics library should include also the following* 
mathematical tables, advanced studies of topics started in the high school, 
supplementary textbooks from other provinces and states, pure mathematics, 
monographs on topics of modern mathematics, books on applied mathematics, 
and studies of topics not included in the Alberta high school courses, 
as solid geometry, statistics and astronomy» The interest of each and 
every member of the mathematics class must receive consideration in com¬ 
piling any list of library books. 

Periodicals - Good mathematical periodicals are indispensable to the 
progressive teacher, for these publications aim to: create and maintain 
interest in the teaching of mathematics, keep the values of mathematics 
before the educational world, help the inexperienced teacher to become 
a good teacher, improve teachers in service by making them better 
teachers, and raise the general level of instruction in mathematics. 

*The Mathematics Teacher w published by the National Council of Teachers 
of Mathematics, 525 West 120th Street, New York 27, is an excellent 
publication for any teacher of mathematics in Alberta, as it is completely

A MATHEMATICS INFORMATION ROOM* 

The mathematics portion of an information room includes various 
current publications on mathematics* 


Puzzles - A number of commercial firms interested in some phase of 
mathematics often issue free booklets, pamphlets or leaflets illust¬ 
rating in an intriguing manner the application of mathematics in their 
particular field* The majority of these advertising media evidently 
have some mathematical principles behind them, so with due car© in the 
selection of the appropriate items, they may prove of value in a math¬ 
ematics classroom. The following brochures are mentioned merely as 
examples i 

1. Fascinating Figure Puzzles - Burroughs. 

2. He measured in Millionths - Ford Motor Company.

Charts. Diagrams. Posters - A laboratory or classroom, to accomplish its 
teaching objectives, needs every type of visual aid that is particularly 
fitted for the work to be achieved. Charts and posters in the mathematics 
laboratory bring novelty and drama into the lives of the students. This 
particular class of visual aids comprises a group which may be termed 
"sustained-use visual teaching aids", flhile probably the least publicized 
of all the visual teaching aids groups, they should b@ the most used. 

There are no substitutes for them: participation, realism and sustained 
use--these are the vital and useful properties of charts, diagrams and 
posters. Such displays, always present in the classroom, contribute 
constantly. In addition to these basic uses, they supplement the more 
dramatic presentations, and offer needed reference and testing possibilities. 
Good pictures offer long term presence, decorative or inspirational value, 
ability to develop color or tone consciousness and provide an atmosphere. 

The number of posters and illustrations decorating the walls of mathematics 
rooms in our schools is very limited. Teachers have indicated that this 
condition arises from the fact that they do not know the sources of such 
illustrated material. 

Much in-service training in the use of mathematics posters is 
advisable, but this can be accomplished only if the posters are available. 

The following posters appear to meet the particular needs of Alberta

compass and air speed indicator* The chart is available at a price of 
one dollar from the Air Age Education Research, 80 East 42nd Street, 

New York City* 

The River Mathematics - This chart is a suitable supplement’ for the 
history of mathematics, for mathematics is pictured as a river with its 
source in primitive arithmetic which, eventually flows into calculus, 
analytical geometry and trigonometry* The names of mathematicians and 
important dates in the history of mathematics are included as tributaries 
to the main river* Henry Holt and Company of New York City sell this 
particular supplement at a price of ten cents*

picture. In the main, this chart may be employed in mathematics classes 
to provide a practical basis for the study of ratio and the multiplication 
and division of numbers with exponents. The ratio lesson includes a 
comparison between various objects illustrated in the chart, and the 
need for converting both numbers into the same units before finding 
their ratio. This chart 24 w x 37 tt has been used successfully in teaching 
the chapter on "Ratio and Proportion" in Algebra II. School Service, 
fifestinghouse Electric Corp., 306 Fourth Avenue, Pittsburgh 30, Pa. 
distributes this useful poster at a cost of $1.00. 

The World Calendar - The chart shows the permanent world calendar recom¬ 
mended by the World Calendar Association to replace our present variable 
one. The World Calendar may be used to provide exercises in forecasting 
the changes that would ultimately result, if the new calendar was adopted 
throughout the business and industrial world. A sample of the World 
Calendar and kindred material may be secured free from the World Calendar 
Association, 630 Fifth Avenue, New York 20. 

Insurance Charts - The students can use some material from outside the 
textbooks by referring to the various Insurance Charts that are available 
free from your insurance company. The following topics may be given a 
practical twist if studied from the charts* Overweight and Underweight, 
Annuities, life Insurance, Statistics, Growth Functions and Perpetuities. 

A lithographed chart entitled the "History of 10,000 Life Insurance 
Policies" and distributed free by any insurance company is very useful 


in this branch of mathematics

THE Tf O-SQUARES MATHEMATICS CLUB. 

Some of the members of the Chinook Mathematics Club who 
were interested in discovering the relationship between 
mathematics and the soft drink industry. 

Mathematics Club - One of the most valuable functions of any Students® 
Mathematics Club is to supplement the work of the classroom fty devising 
original methods of presenting material which is auxiliary to the class¬ 
room introduction. Exhibits, plays, student demonstrations, and many 
other techniques present themselves as methods for vitalizing the work 
of the classroom. No doubt the club's main objective is to foster an 
interest in mathematics and to serve as a means of revealing the truths 
of this particular science. 

Mathematics Clubs in Alberta high schools are a comparatively 
new venture, but since it is the consensus of authoritative opinion that

such clubs accomplish worthwhile objectives and bring about a valuable 
transfer of interest and initiative into the classroom, it is only 
reasonable to expect Alberta teachers to initiate Mathematics Clubs in 
their respective schools, and reap the benefits emanating from such 
organizations* 

The idea of a mathematics club should originate with the students 
themselves, although the initial step evolves from informal talks by the 
teacher, or hints dropped during the course of daily mathematics classes. 

The average high school mathematics club cannot run itself, for what is 
true as to the need for supervision of all school activities is particularly 
true of a mathematics club. The organization of the club should be kept 
as simple as possible, say a president, a secretary-treasurer, and various 
functional committees appointed at the opportune time. In the larger 
high schools, only such students as have shown marked mathematical ability 
or interest are permitted to have the privilege of membership in the club, 
while in the smaller schools of the province, membership is extended to 
anyone who evinces an interest in mathematics. Novel names for the club 
are usually preferable, say n The Euclidean Club 11 , B The Triangle Club 11 , 
w The Pythagorean Club n , n The Logarithm Club**, or M The Mantissa Club**. A 
club crest or pin will add a personal touch to the organization. 

Club meetings require the preparation of enticing programs 
in keeping with the various interests of the members, topics ranging from 
history of mathematics, applications of mathematics, biographical sketches, 
mathematical games, tricks, or unique solutions, and accounts of 
scientific discoveries or inventions related to mathematics, to mathematics

Mathematics in Technicolor - Today, more than ever, we realize that we 
live in a world of technicolor, and as such, we are learning to use 
colors scientifically. We are tinting the walls and ceilings of our homes, 
offices, and factories so as to make a more pleasant environment. We are 
experimenting to discover which colors rest and relax us, and which 
stimulate and excite us. The net results of these psychological 
experiments in color should find their way into our classrooms,and what is

probably more essential, into our teaching procedures* 

Numerous teaching demonstrations require that parts of a proof 
be associated with a figure, and one of the most effective means of making 
this association clear and vivid is to use color and design. This makes 
it possible for a student to look at a proof and notice immediately any 
relationship as the symbols in the proof possess identical colors with 
those to which they are related in the figure. The relationship oscil¬ 
lates between the eye and the mind without the necessity of breaching the 
letters and proof. 

The use of colored chalk is a valuable aid in teaching geometry. 
In illustrating the various equal angles when a transversal falls across 
parallel straight lines, the colored angles may be used to highlight 
the equal parts. The congruency theorems can be made more obvious, while 
the perimeter, areas and volume formulas made more distinct. In algebra, 
signed numbers are never confused in explanation, or in understanding, 
because they are of different colors. Underlining the unknown and known 
in an algebraic problem with the same color as the unknown and known in 
the corresponding equation will facilitate the understanding and app¬ 
lication of equations. In trigonometry, trigonometric functions are 
readily assimilated if in color, while colored diagrams of tri-dimensional 
problems facilitate the understanding prior to the solution* in graphical 
solutions of trigonometric equations of the form Sin x s Oos x, the tables 
and graph could have corresponding colors. One of the most interesting 
and most instructive of the applications of color is in the teaching

log 1000 equals 3* Write the 10*s in one color, the 3*s in a second, 
and the 1000*s in a third, for the association and the contrast desired. 
The effectiveness of this visual method is most pronounced with the 
slower and average students, so the teacher with ingenuity can utilize 
technicolor in teaching with at least three-quarters of the school 
population*

CHAPTER VI 
WHAT OF THE FUTURE? 

The uses of mathematics are on the increase in industry, in 
business, in numerous occupations in which young people expect to 
engage, in other school subjects, and in the affairs of every-day life. 

The methods of teaching mathematics have not kept pace with this present- 
day emphasis on practical applications. Much has been done in the past 
ten years in Alberta towards improving the standard of instruction in 
the high-schools, but unfortunately this trend did not make extensive 
inroads into the teaching of mathematics. We expect our merchants to 
carry a full line of the latest stock of merchandise, we expect our 
doctors to know all and particularly the latest medical treatments, in 
fact, we expect every member of a profession or a skilled trade to be 
familiar with the latest developments in their particular fields. Thus 
in turn is it not expected of mathematics teachers to keep ahead 
professionally? The oft repeated expression, “The present can take care 
of itself, but what of the future? M may be well applied to the future 
status of mathematics teaching in the province. The murky darkness of 
the mathematical “crystal bowl rt fades gradually from sight, and the author 
contemplates with interest a ne?j deal for the teaching of mathematics in 
Alberta high schools. 

Notwithstanding the fact that practical results of educational 
research are many, there is still a great need for classroom experiment¬ 
ation to find the major difficulties in learning the various phases of

mathematics teaching. This thesis, for instance, is the result of five 
years of experimentation in a classroom on introducing laboratory methods 
in the teaching of high school mathematics. Teachers themselves should 
be given opportunities to carry on experiments under the guidance and 
supervision of Department of Education superintendents, or the Faculty 
of Education professors. These experiments might well be arranged through 
the medium of in-the-field studies. A well-conceived and efficiently 
conducted agenda of experiments in mathematics teaching is a decided lack 
today, in spite of the fact that such a program would probably assist in 
improving the standard of mathematics instruction as they now exist. 

A plan could be inaugurated, possibly through a Teaching Aids 
Branch, which would continuously collect up-to-date mathematical 
materials that were as practical as possible to the Alberta situation, 
and at the same time distribute them widely throughout the province for 
the benefit of mathematics teachers everywhere. It is a known fact that 
there is a tremendous flow of aids to the teaching of mathematics, but 
unfortunately no agency exists at present which could sift through the 
mass of available material, select that which seems most appropriate, and 
give the necessary publicity to these aids so that every teacher of 
mathematics in Alberta would be familiar with such teaching materials. 
Teachers need to be shown what is available, and to be trained in the 
development of a habit that will keep them well informed throughout their 
teaching career. 

While radio or television should not, in any sense, be considered 
a substitute for the functions of the superintendent or the inspector in

their supervisory capacity, it can serve as a means of contacting int¬ 
erested teachers of mathematics* Through active participation in 
demonstration lessons by radio the teachers of mathematics in Alberta 
high schools could learn new teaching techniques and procedures for 
putting meaning into the mathematics they teach. 

The introduction of demonstration lessons via radio, television, 
or recorders in Alberta could take the form of lessons in which children 
and the classroom teacher would actively participate. The lessons would 
be prepared and broadcast by teachers who are specialists in the teaching 
of high school matherm tics. The teachers would be allowed sufficient 
time to prepare the lessons carefully, so that each lesson would demon¬ 
strate a good way of teaching a particular topic. The techniques and 
methods used in the lessons would be those that have proved successful 
under classroom conditions. The visual aids and devices constructed by 
the pupils and teacher for use in the radio lesson would be of such a 
standard and type as could be used by the teacher in his daily classroom 
work throughout the year. 

The high school inspectors could select the appropriate teachers, 
and the topics for any of the courses in mathematics, say in Algebra 2, 
ratio, proportion, integration, differentiation, or variation. After 
providing ample time for the preparation, a radio engineer and a technical 
advisor would travel to the school, and make the 15-30 minute recording 
in the home-classroom. The recording would contain only the actual 
teaching procedures, while the practice or drill would not be included

in the radio lessons, but could be printed in a radio guide or in a 
follow-up pamphlet. 

The recording then could be broadcast weekly over the Alberta 
Educational Network say CFGP Grande Prairie in the north, CKUA in 
central Alberta, CBX Lacombe, CFCN Calgary, and CJOC Lethbridge in the 
southern part of the province. It might be possible to produce several 
transcription records and make them available to A.T.A. groups via a 
distributing circuit, ihen television is introduced in Alberta, 
probably within the next ten years, the demonstration lesson would become 
very practical to all the teachers concerned* The main purpose of these 
radio lessons would be to make the teaching of mathematics meaningful 
and interesting to the children. 

Our teaching of mathematics in Alberta requires less time with 
the pencil and more time in deep thought. The majority of the high 
school students search for a pencil and a piece of paper to multiply 
even 9 x 15. Mathematics is thinking. The things we work with in 
mathematics are not of a controversial nature, there is no confusion of 
logic and emotion, of facts and attitudes. The future of mathematics 
teaching in Alberta should show a trend towards increased emphasis on 
oral mathematics. It is reasonable to expect that the students should 
be taught mental or oral mathematics, for, generally speaking their 
future utilization of mathematics as adults will be entirely oral. 

The pupil may be an excellent thinker in mathematics and yet 
it never occurs to him that the same kind of thinking is used in everyday

affairs* At every opportunity the mathematics teacher must compare the 
problems of mathematics to those of life* For real understanding, these 
life problems must be those within the range of the students* experiences. 
The teacher must provide more realistic teaching for the large number of 
students who will continue to be absorbed by industry, trade, farm and 
business. Oral mathematics cannot be overlooked in formulating better 
teaching methods for Alberta teachers. 

The united effort of a homogeneous group of any sort has always 
proved to be one of the best methods of accomplishing great tasks. The 
time is not too distant when the province will boast of an Alberta 
Teachers* Mathematics Society, probably affiliating with some Dominion¬ 
wide organization, or with The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics 
of the United States. It will be through such a teachers* organization 
that the Alberta lifethematics Institute will be planned, that mathematics 
magazines, pamphlets, yearbooks and other publications peculiarly suitable 
to Alberta conditions will be distributed, that will supervise the org¬ 
anization of mathematics clubs in Alberta high schools, that will have a 
major part in planning suitable summer session courses, extra-mural 
courses, and even correspondence courses, and that will make a genuine 
attempt to give Alberta mathematics teachers what they want and need. 

Teachers can testify to the impetus and inspiration given to 
their work by well-planned and well-conducted national teachers* meetings. 
It is time that a few enthusiastic Alberta mathematics teachers were sent 
to the annual meetings of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,

or the Central Association of Science and Mathematics Teachers, Inc,, to 
worthwhile mathematics institutes, as the one at Duke University, or to 
workshops in mathematics similar to the annual course conducted at the 
University of Illinois. Educators must be alive to the fact that progress 
and development can take place only if these Alberta messengers bring 
back an improved picture of present-day teaching of mathematical 
subjects. Alberta must be wholeheartedly interested in the indicated or 
future trends as seen functioning in progressive communities everywhere, 
or as recorded in articles by frontier thinkers. 

The number of commercially available films and film-slides that 
have a bearing on mathematics, while still very small, has taken a 
gigantic upward swing in this post-war period. These visual aids are 
based upon a variety of teaching methods in presenting the subject matter 
to the students—namely, motion, animation of familiar objects, colors 
to accentuate relationships, natural pictures to show applications, 
animated comic sequences, and dramatizations. Visual aids can assist 
the instruction in mathematics as they have already helped in the field 
of science. Individual schools should be encouraged to make simple 
mathematical films as classroom projects, while the University of Alberta 
and the Department of Education could supplement extensively their 
present film-lists with more mathematical films and film-slides. The 
author has discovered that teachers are not interested in any type of 
complicated lists, and well might this be, for individual needs vary from 
school to school, class to class, and from teacher to teacher. 


Interested teachers should write to the following film concerns

The majority of these ogranizations have their Canadian representatives, 
so it is advisable to requisition your film or film-slide requirements 
from the Canadian agents in order to overcome duty and exchange-rate 
difficulties. 

Much in-service training in the use of these visual aids is 
needed, and this can be provided if the equipment is made available. It 
is time to provide it, and it is time to set up broad comprehensive 
programs that will take advantage of the strong points in every type of 
visual aid and carry us on to new levels of teaching and learning, and 
for living in the modern world.

If understanding is to be one of the aims in mathematical 
education then it is essential to emphasize the meaning of all basic 
terms. Mere verbal memorizing of definitions may become an automatic 
response devoid of real understanding. The teacher should take special 
precaution to see that mere imitative usage does not pass for real 
comprehension, Alberta teachers of mathematics will discover eventually 
that there is a high correlation between the child 1 s mathematics vocabulary 
and his success in mathematics. Future textbooks and programmes of 
studies used in Alberta high schools will direct mathematics teachers to 
give much greater emphasis to teaching the thorough understanding of the 
technical terms involved, for the vocabulary constitutes not only the 
means of communication but it is also very largely the medium of thinking 
and problem solving. 

It is within the realm of possibility that within the next five 
years Alberta high schools will set up mathematical laboratories. In 
order to develop meaningful concepts students must have numerous concrete 
experiences, but this is only the first phase of the learning process. 
Significant phases of these experiences and the mathematical relation¬ 
ships must be revealed, symbolized, brought into sharp relief and portrayed 
in relation to one another and to previously learned concepts. A 
mathematical laboratory will supply an environment in which future Alberta 
students will learn efficiently and more meaningfully the mathematics 
they should learn anyway, 

A serious consideration must be given to the variation in the 
abilities and the needs of individual pupils in mathematics courses. Each

pupil failure is an economic loss, and quite often it results in a serious 
personality injury to the individual. The introduction of a full-scale 
testing program in future mathematics classes will furnish teachers with 
an indispensable instructional aid. The teacher will not be expected to 
follow a definitely outlined and systematic schedule, but will use his 
or her initiative in meeting specific situations as they arise in con¬ 
nection ?ath class insturction. The future mathematics teacher will 
have at his or her disposal a series of practical valid and reliable 
tests for the Alberta courses in mathematics, including aptitude, diagnostic, 
unit achievement and standard tests. 

The outlook for mathematics teaching in Alberta is bright. If 
the organization of mathematics teaching along better lines is necessary, 
and improvement in instruction is possible, those best fitted to make the 
greatest contribution are the mathematics teachers. The author believes 
that in order to promote sound growth and development, both in the 
teaching and the study of secondary mathematics in Alberta, it is 
necessary to give heed to the following needs: 

1. mathematical laboratories in all the schools; 

2. materials for the mathematics laboratory which will make 
mathematics more meaningful; 

3* a systematic plan of collecting up-to-date teaching aids that 
are as practical as possible, and for distributing them widely 
for the benefit of all the mathematics teachers; 

4. facilities and organizations for continuous professional growth;

5® teaching mathematics as a system; 

6* directed classroom experiments in various phases of mathematics 
teaching; 

7. the creation of a mathematical atmosphere in the classroom; 

8. provision of mathematical libraries; 

9* full use of modern conveniences as exemplified in the use of 
radio, television and all forms of visual aids; 

10, emphasis on a mathematics vocabulary in the teaching process; 

11. a functional testing program; 

12c the maintenance of the proper proportion between pure and

These are the challenges which the author submits respect¬ 
fully to the teachers of mathematics, to the Faculty of Education of 
the University of Alberta, and to the Department of Education. The 
direction of mathematics teaching has been indicated, the distance of 
this process depends upon those actively interested in the educational 
process. The educational authorities are genuinely interested in 
providing the children of Alberta with the finest teaching standards, 
but it remains for each individual teacher in the province to make the 
plan function.

APPENDIX 

THE THREE SURVEYS. 

Three surveys were conducted in conjunction with the research 
work in M Aids to the Study and Understanding of Alberta High-School 
Mathematics”, namely, 

(1) Alberta High-School Mathematics Survey. 

(2) North America High-School Laboratory Mathematics Survey. 

(3) Commercial Firms Handling Mathematical Equipment* 

(1) Alberta High-School Mathematics Survey . 

Every high school in the province of Alberta was contacted by 
means of a survey sheet in order to discover the extent to which the 
presentation of the subject matter in Alberta mathematics classes was 
complemented by teaching equipment and facilities in a mathematics 
classroom or laboratory. Refer to Table I at the end of chapter one* 

(2) North America High-School Mathematics Survey . 

In order to discover the extent to which various high-school 
systems have encouraged the introduction of mathematics laboratories, 
every Department of Education on the continent of North America (58 in 
all) was asked to fill out a questionnaire indicating the extent and use 
of mathematics laboratories in that particular state or province. See 
Table II on the next page.

To: Alberta High-School Mathematics Teachers. 


Chinook, Alberta, 
January 5,1948. 


Topic: “Aids to the Study and Understanding of Alberta High-School Mathematics.” 


Dear Sir or Madam: 


The accompanying questionnaire has been designed for the purpose of making a study of the extent 
;o which Alberta teachers have used multi-sensory devices in their teaching of high-school mathematics 
(algebra 1, algebra 2, geometry 1, geometry and analytical geometry 1, and general mathematics). 

It is the purpose of the author to make a comprehensive study of this current trend in mathematics 
leaching, commencing with a survey of all Alberta High-Schools followed by a general survey of the same 
problem in the other Canadian provinces as well as in each of the 48 states in the United States. The author 
dans to compile this survey information with the results of five years of experimentation in mathematics- 
leaching into a thesis in which an attempt will be made to show specifically how the teaching of Alberta 
ligh-School Mathematics may be made more comprehensive by the use of various “Teaching Aids”. 

By “Teaching Aids” is meant the provision of a teaching environment in which a pupil learns 
fficiently and more meaningfully the mathematics he should learn anyway. The environment indicated 
lay be provided by various multi-sensory devices as incorporated in Field Mathematics and in Laboratory 
Mathematics. 

I 

Your co-operation is solicited in completing the questionnaire and returning it in the enclosed self- 
ddressed stamped envelope. The author would like to have every high-school mathematics teacher in Alberta 
omplete one of these questionnaires. Will you help? Fifteen minutes of your valuable time in completing the 
uestionnaire will assist in providing the basis for a thesis topic—a topic which the author firmly believes 
'fill prove of value to the mathematics teachers of our province. If the results of the research warrant, it is 
itended to publish a fully illustrated booklet as well as a filmstrip by the Society for Visual Education of 
hicago on “Aids to the Study and Understanding of Alberta High-Scliool Mathematics”, and made avail- 
ble to all interested teachers. 

This survey has the official sanction of the Faculty of Education of the University of Alberta and 
\ le Department of Education. 

Thank you most kindly for your anticipated co-operation, and please attempt to return your survey 
I fleets by January 31, 1948. 


Respectfully j 7 ours, 

John C. Charyk, B.Se., B.Educ., 
Principal, Chinook High-School,

14. If you personally have discovered and used any “Aids to the Study and Understanding of High School 
Mathematics”, and you wish ocher teachers to profit from your experiences, please describe with illustrations 
your method or methods. You will be indicated as the author of the scheme, both in the thesis and in the teacher’s 
pamphlet. If at all possible take an ordinary snapshot of your set-up and equipment so the picture or pictures can 
be included in the above-mentioned publication, as well as in the filmstrip to be produced by the Society for Visual 
Education at Chicago. As every mathematics teacher in the province is being contacted this proposed thesis and 
pamphlet should provide an excellent clearing-house for profitable ideas in mathematics-teaching. Here is your 
opportunity to make a worthwhile contribution to the mathematics-teaching in Alberta. Note: Use the back of this 
survey sheet, or other sheets for an account of your schemes or comments.

The results of this survey indicate that outside of a few 
experimental high schools, the introduction of mathematics laboratories in 
the secondary schools is a new venture on the continent of North America• 
Nevertheless, the majority of the departments of education evinced an 
interest in the research work in establishing and equipping a mathematics 
laboratory in the Chinnok High School* 


Note the following comments: 


w Mr. A* B* Morrison, Director of Curriculum and Research, has 
told me to tell you that he is most interested in your project, and will

(3) Commercial Survey , 

Response - || > 92$. 

It might be one thing to recommend a variety of equipment for 
the mathematics laboratory, but it is another thing to have the material 
available* The author has discovered, after conducting a comprehensive 
survey of commercial firms selling mathematical equipment, that the teacher 
■will have to rely on original home-made equipment for the next four or 
five years, at least. 

The following table of commercial firms selling mathematical 
equipment might prove of value to interested teachers. 


1. Air-Age Education Research, 80 East 42nd Street, New York 17. 

(wall charts, booklets and Air-Age visual aids). 

2. Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., Rochester 2, New York. 

(wall charts, historical reproductions, and demonstration material).

S AMPLE OF LETTER ACCOMPANYING THE NORTH AMERICAN SURVEY . 


Chinook, Alberta, 
January 2, 1948* 


Gentlemens 

I have been given the assignment of establishing and equipping an 
experimental high-school mathematics laboratory by the Faculty of Education 
of the University of Alberta and the Department of Education for this 
province. If the experiment proves successful the authorities plan to 
inaugurate mathematics laboratories in every high school in the province 
of Alberta. 

In order to start on a solid footing I am contacting every prov¬ 
incial or state educational unit on the North American continent in order 
to discover the extent to which LABORATORY-MATHEMATICS and FIELD-MATHEMATICS 
have been adopted in the provincial or state curriculum, and with what 
success. It is only by profiting from your experiences in establishing 
and maintaining high-school mathematics laboratories that it will be 
possible for us in Alberta to secure some semblance of success in our 
experiment. 

A questionnaire is being enclosed for your convenience, and I 
would deem it a very high favour to get the information requested. Please 
complete the survey sheet even if your province or state does not in¬ 
corporate laboratory or field mathematics in the high-school curriculum. 

If your education unit has inaugurated high-school mathematics laboratories 
please supply any additional material that you feel might be of assistance 
to authorities in Alberta, for example, the mathematics curriculum in the 
state or province* regulations governing mathematics laboratories; pictures 
of successful laboratories; sources of laboratory equipment; instructions 
to high-school mathematics teachers concerning laboratories; minimum 
equipment lists; summary reports governing the success or failure of 
mathematics laboratories, ect. 

The results of such a survey of the 48 states and the 9 provinces 
should bring to light some interesting trends and information concerning 
high-school mathematics laboratories on the North American continent. If 
you are interested a comparative summary of results will be sent to you at 
the conclusion of the survey. 

Thank you most kindly for your anticipated co-operation. 

Respectfully yours, 

J. C. Charyk, 

Principal, Chinook High School, 

Box 62, Chinook, Alberta, 

Canada.

14* Yoder Instruments, East Palestine, Ohio. 

(one of the best sources for all types of mathematics equipment on 
the continent of North America)• 


The following extract from a letter written to the author by 
Mr. L. Fabian, vice-president of Canadian Laboratory Supplies, Ltd., 
portrays the position of the Canadian manufacturer and retailer in 
regard to mathematical equipment for Canadian high schools. 


M We have had little or no call for mathematics equipment and 
had to inquire as to just what was available. 

Our suppliers started work on a set of plane geometry devices 
last year. These instruments are not yet available but some of them 
will be before the first of December. Several mathematics institutes 
worked with the devices this summer. The comments were all very 
enthusiastic. 

Before long we hope to have a separate mathematics catalogue 
which will undoubtedly interest all mathematics teachers. It will list 
all the items you mentioned and feature the plane geometry set we spoke 
of in this letter. 

Your letter has caused us to do considerable thinking as we 
are wondering if there is going to be a trend in Canada the same as there 
is in the United States for installing mathematics laboratories in 
Canadian High-Schools. If so, we would like to get the help and guidance 
of the teaching profession since this is a new field. Just as soon as 
our catalogue is available we will mail you a copy, in the meantime if 
you hear of any further developments or if we do, we will communicate 
with you.”
