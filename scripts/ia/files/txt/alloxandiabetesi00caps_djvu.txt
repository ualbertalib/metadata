INTRODUCTION 


The recent discovery that alloxan, the ureide of 
mesoxalic acid, causes "selective" necrosis of the g-cells 
of the islets of Langerhans in certain animals provides 
a new and simple means of producing experimental diabetes, 

Jacobs (22) in 1937 described the occurrence of 

\ 

hypoglycemic convulsions in rabbits given alloxan intra¬ 
venously* -d© showed that these could be relieved by 
intravenous glucose, Dunn et al (8) repeated these obser¬ 
vations and showed that the hypoglycemia was preceded by 
an initial elevation in blood sugar. In addition, they 
described the necrotic effect on the islet cells. Their 
animals died in hypoglycemic shock in 12- 18 hours. By 
preventing death from hypoglycemia through repeated 
intravenous glucose, Bailey and Bailey (1) obtained diabetic 
rabbits in 24 hours,after the injection of alloxan. 

These findings have been confirmed and extended to 
other species. The effect of alloxan varies with different 
species and with individuals of the same species. Greatest 
sensitivity has been found in the dog (14) where the 
diabetogenic intravenous dose of alloxan is 50 - 100 mg,/Kg,. 
Other species in order of decreasing sensitivity are: 
rhesus monkey, 100 - 150 mg,/Kg. (3); cat, 150 mg./Kg.; 
pigeon, 125 - 200 mg,/Kg.; rabbit, 100 - 200 mg,/Kg, and 
rat, 200 - 300 mg,/Kg* intraperitoneally or subcutaneously.(16)

Two human subjects with hyperinsulinIsm due to Islet cell 
tumours have been given 600 - 1000 mg*/Kg. intravenously 
without any permanent effect on the blood sugar level or 
on the tumour oells.{6) In one other instance*(11) in 
which 1.16 gms. alloxan was administered over a period of 
nine days, there was some evidence of an effect similar to 
that found in experimental animals. 

Since Dunn and McLetehi© J9) produced alloxan diabetes 
in albino rats, this animal has been used by most observers. 
Goraori and Goldner (15) using the intraperitoneal route 
and Bailey and Bailey (2) using the subcutaneous method, 
found that a s.ingle dose of 200 mg#/Kg. was suitable for 
the production of diabetes in this animal. Although most 
of the animals so treated show some initial liver and 
kidney damage, recovery in these organs is rapid and only 
the p-cells are permanently destroyed. 

Hyperphosphatemia is a common finding in untreated 
diabetes mellitus. This is corrected by treatment with 
insulin which is believed to increase esterification of 
phosphate within the blood.(23) Since one of the factors 
which determines the level of inorganic phosphate in the 
blood is the activity of phosphatase, it seemed important 
to study phosphatase activity in relation to various 
phases of alloxan diabetes.

IffiTHODS 

The Teat Animal : Adult male albino rats (Wistar Strain) 
were used in all experiments* They were housed in all- 
metal cages and except in special feeding experiments 
were given Purina Fox Checkers with tap water ad lib. 

Collection of Blood Samples: Blood was collected from 
the tail, directly into the pipette for sugar determin¬ 
ations and by "milking** into specially-made fine centrifuge 
tubes for obtaining serum. The serum was removed within 
an hour and stored in the refrigerator until used. Alkaline 
phosphatase activity of serum stored in this manner is not 
significantly altered within three or four days.(4) 

Hemolyzed serum is unsuitable for the determination of acid 
phosphatase due to the high percentage of this enzyme within 
the red blood cells. 

(A) Blood sugar was determined by the micromethod of 
Heineeke .(24) 

(B) Phosphatase activity was determined by the Shinowara 
method (26) as modified by Gould and Schwachman.(19) 

(A) In the Relneck© method, protein is precipitated 
with tungstic acid. The sugar in the centrifuged super¬ 
natant solution is oxidized with alkaline potassium 
ferrioyanlde. The ferrocyanide formed is estimated 
colorimetrically, after conversion to Prussian Blue.

Heagents 

(1) Ferric i ron gum ghatti solution ; Suspend gum 
ghatti tears, for 18 hours, in a copper screen at 
the top of a tall container filled with water, (20 
gm./liter H g 0). Filter* Add 7 gm. ferric sulfate 
hydrate dissolved in 75 ml* 85 per cent phosphoric 
acid (per liter). Add small amounts of 1 per cent 
KMn0 4 solution until a trace of pink persists for 
15 minutes. This destroys certain reducing mat¬ 
erials present in the gum ghatti. The solution 
keeps indefinitely* 

(2) Qyanide - carbonate buffer : Add 4 gm* sodium 
carbonate dissolved in 20 - 25 ml* H g 0 to 0*75 gm. 
sodium cyanide dissolved in 75 ml. H e 0. The com¬ 
bined solutions are then diluted to 500 ml* with 
H g 0. 

(5) Potassium ferricyanide solution : 250 mg* potassium 
ferricyanide are dissolved in 500 ml* H g Q• 

(4) Dilute tungstic acid ; 10 ml* of 0.67N sulfuric 
acid and 10 ml. of 10 per cent sodium tungstate 
are added separately to 480 ml* H g 0, with shaking. 

Collection of specimen 

A hemoglobin pipette calibrated to contain 0.020 ml. 
blood is filled by suction to slightly above the mark. The 
outside of the pipette is wiped free of blood and the level 
is adjusted to the mark by means of capillary suction with 














Kleenex. The blood is discharged immediately into 5 ml. 
of the dilute tungstic acid and the pipette washed by 
drawing up tungstic acid several times. Mixing is accom¬ 
plished by s stream of bubbles blown by mouth through the 
pipette. After 15 minutes, the mixture is centrifuged and 
the supernatant fluid decanted. 

Procedure 

1.0 ml. supernatant solution is transferred to a tube 
(15x100). 1.0 ml* potassium ferricyanide is then added and 

the tube is heated for 15 seconds in a boiling water bath. 

A blank is prepared at the same time using 1*0 ml. H a 0 
instead of the supernatant solution. They are then removed 
from the bath, 1.0 ml. of the buffer is added, large mar¬ 
bles are used to cover the tubes and they are promptly 
replaced in the boiling water bath for exactly 15 minutes. 
After cooling in ice water to 30°C, 1.0 ml. of the ferric- 
iron gum ghatti solution is immediately added. The volumes 
are made up to 5.0 ml. by the addition of H s 0 and the 
solutions are thoroughly mixed. After 50 minutes, the 
amount of ferric ferroeyanide present is estimated in a 
Coleman Universal spectrophotometer fitted with a filter 
which has a maximal transmission at a wav© length of 6400 A°. 
The photometer is set to give a zero reading for the blank 
treated in an identical manner with the sample. 

A calibration curve is constructed by carrying out the 
above procedure on glucose solutions of known concentration.

Procedure 

A 1:10 dilution of rat serum was found most suit¬ 
able for determination of serum inorganic phosphorus 
and acid phosphatase and a 1:100 dilution for alkaline 
phosphatase activity. 

Tubes 1 and 2, containing 0*2 ml. of a 1:10 
dilution of serum, and tube 3, containing 0.2 ml. of 
1:100 dilution, are warmed to 37°C in a constant 
temperature water bath. 0*4 ml. distilled H 2 Q Is added 
to the first, 0*4 ml. acid substrate to the second and 
0.4 ml. alkaline substrate to the third tube* {The 
substrates are also at 37°C) After one hour, 0.4 ml. 
of 10 per cent trichloracetic acid is added to each 
tube. The tubes are then centrifuged and the resulting 
water-clear supernatant fluid is decanted. 0.5 ml. of 
this protein-free fluid is then pl aoed 8 test-tub© 












broad enough to permit rapid mixing while the remaining 
reagents are being added (13x100). 0*7 ml* 0.10N NaOH 

is added, followed by 0.4 ml. of the molybdic acid 
reagent and finally 0*4 ml. of the cold dilute stannous 
chloride. Readings are made fifteen minutes later on 
a Coleman Universal spectrophotometer employing a 
filter with a maximum transmission at 6000 A°. The 
photometer is set to give a zero reading for a blank 
prepared by adding 0.4 ml* of the molybdic acid reagent 
©nd 0.4 ml. of the cold dilute stannous chloride to 
1*3 ml. double-distilled H s 0 . 

A calibration curve was prepared as follows; 2, 

4 and 6 ml. of a "working" phosphorus standard solution* 
were, pipetted into three test tubes (15x100). The 
volume was made up to 6 ml. with distilled H g 0 • At 
the same time, a blank, containing 6 ml. of distilled 
H s 0, was prepared. 2.0 ml.of the molybdic acid reagent 
was added, followed by 2.0 ml. of the dilute stannous 
chloride* Readings were thus obtained for 4,8 and 12

(b) Weekly variations in the levels of blood glucose,

During the first three weeks, food was kept before 
the animals at all times. We found considerable 
fluctuation in the levels of blood glucose and 
alkaline phosphatase. This was reduced during the 
next three weeks by standardising the routine as 
follows. The rats were fed daily in the late after-

noon. From observation, it was noted that most of the 
food was eaten by 4 A.M,. Blood collected between 9 and 
10 A.M, is therefore referred to as post-absorptive. This 
procedure has been employed throughout all following 
experiments. 

Table 2 presents th© averaged weekly values. A

(o) The effect of 48 hours fasting 

The evidence that normal levels of serum 
phosphatases are largely dependent on absorption 
or utilization of food material was substantiated 
by a study of its alterations during 48 hours fasting. 

Alkaline phosphatase levels showed a rapid 
decline during the first nine hours, followed by a 
slow steady drop over the remaining period. The acid 
phosphatase remained constant during the first 12 
hours, but also showed an appreciable drop by the 
end of 48 hours. Mo consistent alteration of serum 
inorganic phosphorus was noted. Table 4 presents 
the data.

(a) 

Hie material used, alloxan monohjdrato {last mn

four per cent solution was freshly prepared for each 
experiment# 

Alloxan diabetes was produced in non-fasted rata 
by a single subeutanaona itijaotion of 160 - BOO mg* 
alloxan per &r> of body weight# Refractory anInals 
seldom responded to a second injection* Tasting the 
animals for a period of 43 hours prior to injection 
was found to increase their susceptibility, but the 
mortality rate wee also greatly increased*

The animals which became diabetic following alloxan 
injections showed many of the symptoms commonly associated 
with diabetes me11itus. Blood sugar values ranged from 
300 to 500 mg* per cent after the first 24 hours, with 
accompanying glycosuria, roughly proportional to the 
extent of hyperglycemia* .olyuria and polydipsia were 
marked, the urine volume increasing to 10 times normal 
in some animals. Ketone bodies appeared in the urine of 
some rats during the early stages but disappeared after 
cessation of weight loss. The blood was thick and dark, 
suggesting hemoconcentration. The serum was usually very 
lipemic during the first week but in many cases this 
disappeared when the diabetes became fully established. 
There was a decrease in glucose tolerance. 

Approxlmately one-third of body weight was lost 
during the first month of diabetes. Many of the rats 
exhibited large gangrenous skin lesions and most animals 
developed cataracts after six or eight weeks. 

(b) Alterations in Blood Glucose in Alloxan Diabetes 

Injection of alloxan has been shown by many invest¬ 
igators to induce a triphasic modification of the blood 
sugar level: 

(a) initial hyperglycemia 

(b) secondary hypoglycemia 

(c) final hyperglycemia

We have been unable to demonstrate a marked hypo¬ 
glycemic phase in rats, but our findings provide evidence 
of a reduction in blood glucose level, five to six hours 
following alloxan. Tables 6 to % give data on two 
groups receiving 160 mg# alloxan per Kg., and on© group

compare well with the average of individual 
blood sugar determinations. 













The mechanism of the initial transitory hyperglycemia 
after the injection of alloxan is still not clarified. 

Dunn et al (10) suggested that it was the result of 
excessive stimulation of islet activity. Their hypothesis 
was based on the idea that a hypoglycemic phase following 
a hyperglycemic reaction indicates an abnormally strong 
stimulation of the islet system and an unbalanced regulation 
of carbohydrate metabolism. Hughes, Ware and Young (21) 
later showed that hyperglycemia followed by hypoglycemia 
may be produced in rabbits by the injection of adrenalin 
plus an amount of insulin equivalent to that estimated to 
be present in the pancreas of a normal rabbit. This 
suggested that the initial hyperglycemia may be due to an 
adrenalin effect. This explanation receives support from 
Goldner and Gomori ( 8 ) , Following removal of the adrenal 
glands, they found a diabetogenic dose of alloxan no 
longer resulted in the initial hyperglycemic phase. More 
recently, Houssay et al (20) showed that initial hyperglycemia 
did occur in adrenalsatomised dogs and suggest a direct 
action of alloxan on the liver. 

Disagreement also exists with respect to the mechanism 
of the second or hypoglycemic phase, which, especially in 
rabbits, is often severe enough to cause convulsions. The 
original theory of overactivity of the 0-cells (8) has been 
discarded in favor of the hypothesis that preformed insulin

. 






















is liberated by the degenerating islet cells (21)(25). 
Houssay, however, ascribes the hypoglycemia to an extra- 
pancreatic effect, probably the lack of glucose production 

by the liver# (ap) 

There is general agreement that the permanent hyper¬ 
glycemia results from loss of insulin production by the 
pancreas. Direct assay of the pancreas has shown a greatly 
reduced insulin content (17). This is in agreement with 
the histological studies of the pancreas (2) (9). 

(c) Alterations in Blood Glucose. Ferum Phosphatases and 

Inorganic Phosphorus in Alloxan Diabetes 

Alterations in serum phosphatase activity following 
injection of alloxan have been observed in approximately 
100 rats* Early observations were made at weekly intervals, 
but the rapidity with which blood sugar changes occurred 
necessitated repetition of these studies at more frequent 
intervals* Results from a representative group of six 
animals receiving 160 mg# alloxan per Kg* body weight are 
recorded in Table 9. The average values ar© shown in 
Table 10 and Fig. 1 . 

There is a rapid progressive rise in blood sugar. 

This exceeds 400 mg. per cent at the end of two days and 
is maintained thereafter with only slight fluctuations* 

The acid phosphatase falls quickly to about 25 per cent of 
the initial level and returns to normal in three days.

Alkalina phosphatase shows a similar initial fall but 
is restored within 12 hours* This is followed by a 
progressive increase over the next two weeks, when values 
in excess of three times the normal level are reached and 
maintained* Serum inorganic phosphorus is not greatly 
altered, but nearly all values found after the injection 
of alloxan are greater than the initial levels*

() The Rffeot of Insulin on Blo o d Sugar. Serum 

Phosphatases and Serum Inorganic Phosphorus 

of Alloxan Diabetic Rats 

The hyperglycemia and glycosuria which develop in 
alloxan diabetes, are readily controlled with insulin. 

A single subcutaneous injection of 0.4 units of crystalline 
zinc insulin * restored the blood sugar to within normal 
levels in 90 minutes. This was accompanied by a 50 per 
cent decline in both acid and alkaline phosphatase levels. 

More complete studies showing the effect of three successive 
subcutaneous injections of 0*4 units of insulin at three 
hour intervals are presented in Table 11 and Fig 8 * 

Repeated administration of insulin depressed the blood 
sugar to hypoglycemic levels* Acid phosphatase fell to 
25 per cent of normal and alkaline phosphatase to normal 
levels* Serum inorganic phosphorus was also reduced. All 
values returned to original levels within 24 hours. 

The fall in serum inorganic phosphorus following insulin 
injection, though well established as fact, has never been 
fully explained. According to 3oskin ( ,* 7 festerification of 
the inorganic phosphorus must occur, as the total blood 
phosphate remains unchanged* The nature of the phosphate 
compound which is formed is, however, unknown. 

* Insulin dilutions 1 ml* containing 40 I.U. was diluted to 20 
nil. with 0.9 per cent saline acidified to pH 2*4 by adding 
one drop cone. HC1 to 100 ml* saline.

( 0 ) The Effect of Adrenalin Injections on Blood Oluoose , 

Scrum. Phosphatases and Inorganic .Phos p horus of Normal 
and Alloxan Diabetic Pats 
It has been noted that the initial hyperglycemia 
observed during the development of alloxan diabetes has 
been attributed to the secretion of adrenalin (21)(18). 

It seemed pertinent, therefore, to study the effect of 
this hormone on serum phosphatase activity# 

The effect of four successive injections of 0*2 mg# 
adrenalin * at three hour intervals is shown in Tables 12 and 33 
Since no food was available for 12 hours, part of the drop in 
alkaline phosphatase activity may be a starvation effect# 

However control groups of six normal and six diabetic rats 
showed declines of 13 and 20 per cent respectively, in 
comparison to corresponding decreases of 25 and 39 per cent 
in the groups reported* It may be concluded, therefore, that 
adrenalin lowers serum phosphatase activity, in spite of the 
increase in blood glucose resulting from increased glycogenolysi. 

* Adrenalin dilutions 1 ml# vials of adrenalin in oil, 

(No 192, P.D# and Co* Ltd., C77114S) containing two mg* of 
adrenalin t were rediluted to 5*0 ml# with peanut oil* Each rat 
was injected subcutaneously with 0.5 ml#(0.2 mg.) of this 
dilution.

Summary and Discussion 


Our findings in regard to phosphatase activity in 
alloxan diabetes may be briefly summed up as follows; 

(1) The development of alloxan diabetes in rats is 
accompanied by an initial decline in phosphatase 
activity, followed by an increase, which in alkaline 
phosphatase reaches three to four tines normal 
levels. Serum inorganic phosphorus tends to be 
approximately 15 per cent higher after diabetes has 
become established. 

{2} Insulin administration controls the hyperglycemia 

readily. Phosphatase activity and inorganic phosphorus 
are also reduced. 

(3) Adrenalin administration increases the hyperglycemia 
but produces a decrease in serum phosphatase activity 
and in inorganic phosphorus in both normal and 
diabetic rats. 

The initial decline in phosphatase activity after 
the administration of alloxan corresponds to the first 
two phases of blood sugar variations, namely, (1) the 
hyperglycemic phase, believed due to adrenalin secretion, 
and (£) the hypoglycemic phase, resulting from release 
of preformed insulin by degenerating p«cells of the 
islands of Langerhans. The results reported in this 
section provide evidence to indicate that the initial 
decline in phosphatase activity is due to the effect of

- 36 - 


adrenalin and/or insulin, and lend confirmation to the 
explanation provided by other observers (21)(18) for 
the initial alterations in blood sugar levels noted 
above. 

The later permanent increase in alkaline phosphatase 
activity to 400 per cent of the original level required 
explanation and led to a study of diets in relation to 
phosphatase activity. 




- 37 - 


Part III - The Effect of Various? Diets on the Phosphatase 
Activity of Normal and Alloxan Diabetic Hats 

The fact that serum phosphatase activity is closely 
related to the resorption or utilization of food has been 
noted in the section dealing with the effect of fasting 
on phosphatase activity. In order to determine which 
part of the diet is responsible for the marked effect on 
serum phosphatase activity, various types of diets were 
fed to groups of rats over a three-week period. 

In each case, the rats were fasted for 72 hours before 
being given the diet. During this period the alkaline 
phosphatase fell to very low levels. The capacity of 
each diet to raise the phosphatases from these low levels 
was then examined. 

(a) The Effect of 72 Hours Easting 

When rats were deprived of food for a period of 72 
hours, there was a significant decrease in the level of 
blood sugar and a profound decrease in serum alkaline 
phosphatase in normal and diabetic animals. Acid 
'phosphatase also appeared to be lowered but there was 
no consistent change in the level of inorganic phosphorus* 
Table 14 presents the average values for 15 normal and 
15 diabetic rats before and after th© 72 hour fast.

(b) Hirdi Carbohydrate Diet (1) 

Five normal and five diabetic rats were given a 
diet consisting of 75 per cent sucrose, 5 per cent 
salt mixture, 15 per cent casein and 5 per cent yeast. 
During the last night of the preceding 72 hour fast, one 
of the rats died and was eaten by the rest* The fasting 
values, therefore, do not show the decrease found in the 
succeeding experiments. By the third day the serum, 
inorganic phosphorus had risen to 200 per cent of the 
original level and by the tenth day to nearly 300 per cent* 













- 39 - 


Many of the aniraals developed tail infections and it became 
difficult to obtain blood specimens# It was decided to 
repeat the experiment with another group of rats, adding 
to the diet a supplement of the 3-complex* The results, 
of Interest, however, insofar as they show (1) maintenance 
of blood sugar at a high level, and (2) a steady decline 
in alkaline phosphatase similar to that found in fasting 
animals, are shorn in Table 15* 

High Carbohydrate Diet ( 11 ) 

To the diet used above, 5*8 mg* thiamin, 6*0 mg* 
riboflavin and 36.0 mg. niacin per Kg# of diet were added* 
Five normal and five diabetic rats were fasted 73 hours 
and then placed on this diet for three weeks. The animals 
tolerated the diet much better, although the tendency 
towards tail infections was still high. 

Table 16 presents the data obtained. In both normal 
and diabetic aniraals the blood sugar rose rapidly to 

t 

hyperglycemic levels during the first day* After this, the 
blood glucose fell and was maintained at or above its initial 
values for the duration of the test period. The alkaline 
phosphatase was unaltered by the carbohydrate diet and 
remained at the low fasting level throughout the El days* 

Ho consistent alterations were found in acid phosphatase 
and serum, inorganic phosphorus. After one week on laboratory 
diet, all values were restored to the pretest levels*

(c) High Protein Diet 

This diet consisted of 88 per cent casein, 4 per 
cent salt mix and 8 per cent yeast# 

The behaviour of the normal animals on the high 
protein diet was not significantly different to those 
on the high carbohydrate intake, except that there was 
no initial hyperglycemia and the blood sugar remained 
throughout at much lower levels# The alkaline phospha¬ 
tase showed some recovery but did not return to pre-test 
levels# In the alloxan group, the blood sugar also 
remained low in comparison to the pre-test level but 
was about twice the fasting level# This was true also 
of the alkaline phosphatase. There was no consistent 
change.in inorganic phosphorus# Yalues were restored 
after one week on stock laboratory diet# The data is 
presented in Table 17.

(d) Hi^h Fat Diet 

The test diet consisted of 70 per cent Qrisco, 

5 per cent cod liver oil, 15 per cent casein end 5 per 
cent salt mixture. On this diet,the rats developed 
severe dermatitis, diarrhea and ketonuria, the latter 
being more severe in the diabetic rats than in the 
normal group. 

Table IB presents the results obtained. Blood 
sugar changes in both normal and diabetic groups were 
similar to those described in the high protein diet. A 
rapid recovery of alkaline phosphatase was apparent in 
each group. The normal animals returned to pre-fasting 
level within 24 hours and the phosphatase activity 
continued to rise, reaching a maximum of approximately 
250 per cent of the pre-test level in three days* The 
diabetic group returned to its high pre-fasting level 
within 48 hours and also surpassed this level within the 
next few days. Acid phosphatase values in both groups 
showed recovery to slightly above pre-test levels. The 
inorganic phosphorus was also raised to a value of 
approximately twice the original level. All values 
decreased to original levels after 10 days on stock 
laboratory diet.

(e) High Carbohydrate D iet Containing Five Ter Gent Fat 

This experiment was conducted on normal rots only* 

The results indicate that when as little as five per 
cent fat is provided in a high carbohydrate diet, 
phosphatase activity is restored to the pre-fasting level 
in a very short time* 

The diet used was Vitamin A Test Diet (Smaco U.S.P* XI) 

which consisted of: 

vitamin free casein-■ 18 per cent 

salt mixture , So £ -— 4 per cent 

irradiated 3 *east —— 8 per cent 

starch — ——— -65 per cent 

vegetable oil —--- 5 per cent 

To this composition, we added 1000 X,U* 3~carotene per 

Kg, of diet. 

Blood sugar alterations were similar to those already 
discussed under carbohydrate diets. The alkaline phospha¬ 
tase, however, was found to increase to normal within IB 
hours. This level was maintained over the following ten 
days of the experiment. Inorganic phosphorus was increased 
to values slightly exceeding the pre-test level* Acid 
phosphatase showed some recovery but did not return to its 
normal level, (Table 19)

Following a 16 hour fast, six normal adult male rats

given intraperitoneal injections of 3.1 gm* glucose per 
Kg* body weight* deduction in the dose of glucose was 
deemed advisable in view of the hyperglycemia already 

and Pis 

present* Table 20'‘presents the results obtained. 

Glucose tolerance curves will be seen to be char¬ 
acteristic of a typical response in both normal and 
alloxan diabetic animals. .Alkaline phosphatases in the 
alloxan diabetic group remained at the fasting level. In

the normal animals there was a reduction in alkaline 
phosphatase activity# This decrease is interpreted as an 
effect of insulin secreted by the pancreas of the normal 
animals. It did not occur in the diabetic animals because, 
presumably, with destruction of the g-oells, no insulin 
could be secreted*

Sunmary on cl Discuss ion 

Our findings, in respect to the effect of various 
diets on serum phosphatase activity, disagree with those 
of Bodansky (4) who has reported an increase in alkaline 
phosphatase activity when a high carbohydrate diet was 
fed, and no effect from the ingestion of protein or fat* 

We are, however, in agreement with the findings of Weil 
and Russel (27), who report that "only the alcohol-ether 
soluble fraction of pulverized Purina Dog Chow was found 
to restore the low plasma phosphatase activity produced 
by 24 hours fasting. The Insoluble fraction (carbohydrate 
and protein) was found completely inactive in this respect." 
Weil and Russel extended this experiment to determine 
which pert of the lipid fraction is responsible. They found 
that only when certain unsaturated fatty acids, namely, 
oleic, erucic, linoleic and linolenic acids were added to 
the diet, did an increase In plasma phosphatase occur. The 
saturated fatty acids and the saturated dicarhoacyllc acids 
proved to be entirely ineffective. 

Also of interest in connection with this study is a 
paper by Burn, Lewis and Kelsey (7) entitled "The Dietary 
Control of Alloxan Diabetes in Rats." Their findings in 
brief are-: 

(1) On a high fat diet, the glycosuria of alloxan

, 









































diabetic rats disappeared and remained absent until 
the normal diet was resumed. 

(2) Vrlth a gradual increase of the fat content of the 
diet, it was possible to abolish glycosuria without 
producing ketonuria* 

(3) After successive periods of high fat diet, the 
glycosuria seen on return to normal diet steadily 
diminished* 

Our investigation shows that the presence of phospha¬ 
tase in the serum of albino rats is due mainly to the 
ingestion of fat* Carbohydrate resulted in no change and 
protein in only a moderate Increase in the serum phosphatase 
activity. These findings are illustrated in Fig. 10 . 

It would appear, then, that the increase in phosphatase 
activity in alloxan diabetes is associated with increased 
fat and protein catabolism necessitated by the animals 
inability to metabolite carbohydrate.

SUMMAHT 

Normal levels of blood glucose, serum alkaline and 
acid phosphatase and 3©rum inorganic phosphorus were 
established for adult male rats. Alloxan diabetes was 
produced in these animals and alterations in these levels 
were studied under various conditions. 

It was found that serum alkaline phosphatase activity 
in alloxan diabetic rats was increased in relation to the 
increase In blood sugar. Both were reduced in parallel 
fashion by the administration of Insulin. Serum acid 
phosphatase activity behaved similarly* Serum Inorganic 
phosphorus was Increased slightly in the diabetic state 
and was reduced by the administration of insulin. 

Adrenalin administered to normal and alloxan diabetic 
rats produced an increase in the level of blood sugar but 
a reduction in alkaline and acid phosphatase and in inorganic 
phosphorus. A similar effect but with reduction in the 
level of blood sugar was found associated with fasting. 

Diets containing five per cent fat restored the levels 
of serum alkaline and acid phosphatase in normal rats 
fasted for 72 hours* Diets with higher fat content in¬ 
creased these levels above the pre-fasting levels of normal 
and alloxan diabetic rats. Diets containing protein but 
no fat or carbohydrate showed a partial restorative effect. 
Diets high in carbohydrate produced a transient hyperglycemia 
but had no effect on the fasting level of serum alkaline 
phosphatase. 















































. 



Our conclusions ore: 


- 54 ** 

(!) Although changes in the activity of 001101 alholino 
phosphatas# in alloxan diabetic rata parallel the 
changes in blood sugar# the hyporrjXyomla produced 
by high carbohydrate diets or by parenteral admin¬ 
istration of glucose or the injection of adrenalin 
is attended by a decrease In phosphatase activity# 
Thus hyperglycemia per ae co&not be tho ecus© of 
Increased phosphates® activity# 

(£) The increase phosphates# activity consequent to 
the administration of fat reported by other workers 
is confirmed. 

(5) It scams possible that whm glucose is not available 
for metabolic purposes mm In alloxan diabetes, the 
organise uses fat or protein* In mmfa am instance 
one night arpoet to find m increase to phosphatase 
activity snob to the mmm way as when fat end protein 
oonstitute the main portion of the diet. 

{ 4 } The decreased o/oarhot go# activity foilwing the 

adrdnlstrstlon of insulin m:ui of adrenalin nay thus 
also bn explained on the basis that both contribute 
%q the: utilisation of glucose end thus decrease the 
•necessity for the conversion of fat or protein and 
m a consequence# phosphatase otlvity is reduced* 























55 - 


(5) It is thug concluded that the observations so far 
available suggest that serum alkaline phosphatase 
activity is related to the metabolism of fat and 
to a certain extent of protein, possibly for 
glueone©genesis,* 


* Since this conclusion was arrived at, attention was 
directed to a paper by Caarenstroom (IS) who studied glucose 
and nitrogen excretion in alloxan diabetic/ rats. He showed 
that the degree for hyperglycemia and glycosuria was 
parallel to the excretion of nitrogen, and drew the inference 
that this was the result of intensive protein catabolism* 

He postulates that the "decrease in consumption of carbo¬ 
hydrate (in alloxan diabetes) makes it impossible to 
obtain the required amount of energy in the ordinary way, 
and therefore necessitates the decomposition of other 
substances such as protein and fat*” Our findings lend 
support to this view*

Serum Phosphatases and Alloxan Diabetes 1

Alloxan diabetes was produced in adult male albino rats 
by a single subcutaneous injection of 16 mg. of alloxan mono¬ 
hydrate for each 100 grams of body weight. The animals were 
housed in metal cages, 6 to a cage, and fed Purina Fox Checkers 
with tap water ad lib. Of 61 animals used, 6 per cent were 
unaffected by the treatment; 10 per cent recovered from an 
early hyperglycemia; 20 per cent developed hyperglycemia 
and died within three days. The remaining 64 per cent sur¬ 
vived for long periods and exhibited hyperglycemia, glycosuria, 
lipemia, and ketonuria. Polyuria and polydipsia were marked, 
and there was progressive weight loss to the extent of 50 per 
cent of the original weight in three weeks. 

Specimens of tail blood were obtained periodically for the 
estimation of blood glucose, serum inorganic phosphorus, and 
acid and alkaline phosphatases. Blood sugar was estimated 
by the micromethod of Reinecke (5). Serum phosphorus and 
phosphatases were determined by the method of Shinowara, 
et al. (6) as modified by Gould and Schwachman (3). Acid 
and alkaline phosphatases were estimated at pH 5.3 and pH 
9.3, respectively. The normal mean values, previously deter¬ 
mined in fasted animals, were: blood sugar, 117 mg./lOO ml.; 
serum inorganic phosphorus, 9.0 mg./lOO ml.; serum acid 
phosphatase, 3.2 units/100 ml.; and serum alkaline phos¬ 
phatase, 113 units/100 ml. 

Six animals were used for each experiment and the results 
averaged. Table 1 presents the findings in a representative 
group. 

There is a rapid, progressive rise in blood sugar. This exceeds 
400 mg. per cent at the end of two days and is maintained 
thereafter with only slight fluctuations. The initial transient 
rise in blood sugar in rabbits noted by some observers ( 4 ) and 
attributed to the release of adrenalin was not observed in the

present experiment. In our subsequent experiments, no 
reported here, in which the dosage of alloxan was greater, such 
an early transient blood sugar rise was observed. The acid 
phosphatase falls quickly to about 25 per cent of the initial 
level and returns to normal in three days. Alkaline phosphatase 
shows a similar initial decline which is restored within 12 hours. 
This is followed by a progressive increase over the next two 
weeks, when values in excess of three times the normal level 
are reached. Serum inorganic phosphorus is not greatly altered,

but nearly all values found after the injection of alloxan are 
greater than the initial levels. 

The hyperglycemia and ketonuria which develop are easily 
controlled with insulin. A single subcutaneous injection of 0.4 
units of crystalline zinc insulin restores the blood sugar to 
within normal levels in three hours. This is accompanied by a 
30 per cent decline in both acid and alkaline phosphatases. 
At the end of 24 hours all values are restored to the diabetic 
levels. In order that the effect of insulin could be observed over

at three-hour intervals. The averaged results in four animals 
are presented in Table 2.

tion of insulin show hypoglycemia, reduction of acid phos¬ 
phatase to 25 per cent of normal, and reduction of the alkaline 
enzyme to within normal limits. Serum inorganic phosphorus 
is reduced. 


Our findings indicate that the. development of alloxan 
diabetes in rats is accompanied by an increase in serum alkaline 
phosphatase activity and that > the administration, of insulin 
produces a decrease in the activity of both the acid and alkaline 
enzymes. The initial decline in phosphatase activity following 
the injection of alloxan simulates that produced by the injec¬ 
tion of insulin and is attributed to the release of insulin stores 
in the pancreas. When this supply is exhausted, alkaline 
phosphatase activity increases and remains elevated, the 
increase being parallel to the elevation in blood sugar. Both 
are reduced, again in parallel fashion, by the administration 
of insulin. 

We have been unable to demonstrate any great increase in 
serum inorganic phosphorus following the administration of 
alloxan, although nearly all the values found were in excess 
of the preinjection level, and a few were greatly increased. 
Following the administration of insulin in the alloxan diabetic 
animal, reduction in the level of inorganic phosphorus was 
demonstrated. These findings are in accord with the well- 
known effect of insulin both in the diabetic and normal organ¬ 
isms (2, 2) and suggest that these alterations reflect changes 
in phosphatase activity.
