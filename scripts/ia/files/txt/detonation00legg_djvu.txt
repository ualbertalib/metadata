INTRODUCTION 


Davis (l) describes an explosion as "a loud 
noise ana a sudaen going amy ox things irom -cue 
place where they have been.” An explosive is de¬ 
fined as "a material, either a pure single substance, 
or a mixture, which is capable of producing an ex¬ 
plosion by iis own energy.' 1 

Tnere are three types ox explosives: 

(1) Primary or initiating explosives, which explode 
by the application of heat or from impact or friction* 
An example is mercury fulminate. 

(2) Secondary or high explosives which must be ex¬ 
ploded by the diode from an initiating explosive. 

Por example — trinitrotoluene. 

(3) Propellants -- substances, usually mixtures 
which, upon the application of heat or the dioct: 
xrom an initiating explosive give a steady rise of 
pressure. An example is gunpowder* 

Initiating explosives do not generally have a 

melting point. They explode bexore melting. The 

o 

explosion points of most lie in a range from 150 C

to 350 C. They are very sensitive to impact and to 
friction. 

With increasing use of explosives there arose 
the problem of accidental explosions during handling. 
As a result, the testing of explosives was started. 
Berthe lot, Dautriche, Wohler, Abel and others meas¬ 
ured velocities of detonation, impact sensitiveness, 
heat sensitiveness and other properties. 

The initiating ability of explosives was found 
to vary. Too large amounts of mercury fulminate were 
required to detonate the new nitro explosives. Mix<* 
tures of mercury fulminate with potassium chlorate 
were better. These mixtures, with added substances, 
are still used in small caps. However, most of the 
new mixtures proved to be very susceptible to shock 
and blows. To avoid such mixtures boosters may be 
used. These are substances, such as tetranitrophenyl- 
me thyl nitramine (te tryl), which are s omewhat more 
sensitive to the action of an initiator than ordin¬ 
ary high explosives. They are interposed between the 
initiator and the high explosive to transmit the en¬ 
ergy efficiently. 

Various theories of the Initiation and detonation 
of explosives have been proposed. However, all have

been rather unsatisfactory. Most explosive data is 
unreliable and difficult to reproduce. 

It is hoped to develop a satisfactory theory of 
detonation based on reliable experimental observations. 
Such a theory would assist in the designing of new 
initiators and high explosives. Incidental to obtain¬ 
ing experimental data it ms necessary to design im¬ 
pact and friction sensitiveness apparatus. These may 
also be valuable in the commercial production and 
handling of explosives.

THEORIES Oi>' INITIATION ANN DETONATION 

Wave Synchronism Theory 

Abel, as quoted by Colver (4),advanced the 
hypothesis oi wave synchronism* It ascribes the 
action of the primary explosive to be due to its 
wave synchronism, or sympathetic molecular vibra¬ 
tion, with that of the secondary explosive* The 
explosives, he assumed, were tuned to a certain 
explosive wave exactly as in acoustics* Berthelot 
criticised the theory, pointing out that action in 
the case of the two explosives should be recipro¬ 
cal* ij'urtherr, every explosive should then show 
wave synchronism with itself and be the perfect 
igniter for itself* However, it has been shown 
that with mercury fulminate and other initiators, 
dynamite is sometimes left partly unexploded* On 
the other hand, in the case of cast explosives such 
as T*N.T* and picric acid, the same explosive inter¬ 
posed lodsely between the detonator and the cast 
explosive will result in the detonation of the latter* 

Berthelot*s Theory of Detonation 

Berthelot (3,4) considered that detonation of 
an explosive is caused by a percussive wave. By 
rapid adiabatic compression the temperature of suc¬ 
ceeding layers of explosive is raised to the decom- 








- 5 - 


position point. The adiabatic compression theory 
is well founded in the case of gaseous explosions. 
However, hernst (5) doubts its validity lor solias. 

Taylor and Weale (6) calculated the energy 
required to explode a mercury fulminate mixture by 
impact. Assuming tnat the total energy of tne blow 
reached the mixture ana was converted into heat, 

o 

the temperature of tne mixture would be raised 20 C. 

o 

The explosion temperature of tne mixture was 163 C. 
The actual energy reaching the explosive in the sys¬ 
tem would be much less than one calculated amount.J 

The Energy Chain Theory 

This tneory was advanced by Muraour (7). it 
is based on the classification of explosives into 
two groups# 

(1) Those in which one comoustion wave, in free 
air f is transformed instantaneously, or almost so, 
into a detonation wave with a velocity of several 
thousand metres per second. 

(2) Those in which the combustion wave, in free 
air, has a velocity of only a few centimetres per 
second. This wave is not transformed into a deton¬ 
ation wave. 

Initiators generally fall into the first class 
and high explosives into the second#

The exceptional velocity of combustion of 
detonators is explained by the formation of energy 
chains* When an explosive molecule is decomposed 
part of its energy is available for the activation 
of neighboring molecules* As a result of resonance 
phenomena one or several of the neighboring mole¬ 
cules can receive, in one -way only, the total en¬ 
ergy required for their activation* These mole¬ 
cules in the same manner activate some neighboring 
molecule. Thus the energy i3 passed rapidly across 
the solid mass, independent of the gaseous pressure. 
If one considers the formation of branched chains 
(a molecule in decomposing activates two or more 
molecules) then the velocity of reaction can become 
extremely great. 

Huraour observes that a shock wave is necess¬ 
ary to start an explosive wave* This shock may be 
from an initiator or from the combustion of an ex¬ 
plosive under high density. In the latter case an 
extremely rapid growth of pressure, approaching a 
shock, is produced* This creates a mechanical com¬ 
pression wave which is maintained by decomposition 
of successive layers of explosive. If the explos¬ 
ion already has a high velocity of combustion in 
free air (i*e. it is an initiator), then the iner-

tia of the gaseous mass released can be great enough 
to start the explosive wave* 

Muraour has tabulated and examined the proper¬ 
ties of many explosives* A brief resume of his con¬ 
clusions is of some interest* 

Heats of formation -- Most initiating explosives 
are endothermic* When an endothermic molecule is 
decomposed t he heat of reaction is immediately avail¬ 
able* Yt/hen an exothermic molecule is decomposed the 
energy of reaction is only produced by the subsequent 
reaction of the atoms and molecules of the original 
decomposition* The velocitjr of reaction in the first 
case would be much greater. A few initiators, such 
as lead picrate, hexamethylenetriperoxideamine and 
tricycloacetone are exothermic* 

Temperature of Decomposition — has no efrect on 
the ease with which the combustion wave is transform¬ 
ed into a detonation wave. Cyanuric triazide and 
tetryl have tne same temperature of decomposition* 
Comparison of other characteristics — The velocity 
of detonation is markedly lower for initiating ex¬ 
plosives than tor secondary explosives* The force 
per unit volume calculated for mercury fulminate is 
high,but for other initiating explosives it is of 
the same order or lower than those of secondary ex¬ 
plosives*

Bxaminatlon of Chemical Formulae -- The presence 
of heavy metal seems to Increase the possibility 
of an explosive being an initiator* Muraour assumes 
that the presence of the heavy metal favors the form¬ 
ation of the energy chains* The initiators with struc¬ 
tures having only a small number of bonds seem to be 
more efficient* This may be explained by Polanyi’s 
theory. The energy furnished to a molecule on heat¬ 
ing distributes statistically between the different 
bonds. As a result of interfering phenomena, it may 
accumulate at a certain moment on a bond and the bond 
will rupture. If the molecule is complex the probab¬ 
ility of the energy accumulating in a single bond Is 
small. 

The Tribo-Chemi cal Theory 

Taylor and Weale (6,8) have done some very 
accurate and interesting work on explosives. They 
consider the processes of initiation and detonation 
may be explained on the basis of tribo-chemistry. 

The forces involved in the impact explosion of 
initiators and in the detonation of high explosives 
are large. Under these very intense pressures the 
crystals of explosive are subjected to normal stress¬ 
es and tangential shearing. The former tend to bring 
the surface molecules into very intimate contact and

the latter to break these contacts. The continued 
process of surface linkage and disruption results 
in the chemical decomposition of the medium at a 
velocity which is proportional to the rate at which 
work is being done in the process. To this may be 
added the thermal reaction and the effect of the hot 
gases liberated. If these combined processes reach 
a critical value the action becomes self-propogati ve , 
i.e. the detonation wave commences. 

In their second paper (8) Taylor and Weale deduce 
some pressure-time relationships. For mercury fulmin- 
ate they found that an impulsively applied pressure of 
over 7 tons per square inch may cause complete detona¬ 
tion in less than 10"5 seconds. 

The Breaking Theory of Detonation 

In two long papers (9) Carl has submitted the 
breaking theory of detonation. The papers are very 
interesting both from a practical and theoretical 
viewpoint. A brief discussion of the theory follows. 

Detonation is a progressive breaking of the 
valence bonds of a material, by a stress which is 
transmitted through the material as an elastic wave. 
This may be considered as a sound wave of such in¬ 
tensity aa to destroy the structure of the material.

The breaking wave is maintained by the release of 
gases and heat from the explosive. Thus it is a con¬ 
tinuous compression. Its passage through the explo¬ 
sion will be affected by the elasticity of the medium. 
The optimum condition is then perfectly elastic mater¬ 
ial which requires only a slight distortion to cause a 
breakage of its bonds* 

The sensitivity of endothermic compounds and of 
exothermic compounds is assumed to be quite different, 
the former being more sensitive. Both types have ex¬ 
ternal weakness -- surface unsaturation -- while one, 
the endothermic compound, has inherent internal weak¬ 
ness. This latter is like the internal strain dis¬ 
cussed by von Baeyer# 

^However, as Muraour has pointed out, some very 
sensitive initiators are exothermic.J 

Carl states also that increased crystal size 
causes increased sensitiveness in endothermic com¬ 
pounds. He bases this on the observation that large 
crystals of lead azide have exploded without warning. 
This idea is quite widely received* 

£on the other hand. Miles (10) has grown crystals 
of lead azide 3 centimetres or more in length which

could be crashed safely with a spatula* Miles attrib¬ 
utes any increased sensitiveness of large crystals to 
distortions in the crystal structure* When this occurs 
the energy of the structure will be much higher than 
usual* J 

The explosive will be less sensitive to detona¬ 
tion if there is present any agency, force or quality 
which protects or supports the crystal or molecule or 
which tends to prevent transmission of stresses by el¬ 
astic waves* A few such agencies are: a resistant

container, high density of charge, mutual support by 
intertwined crystals, toughness, colloidal dispersion 
of explosives, addition of coating material*

TESTING OF EXPLOSIVES 


(1) The Temperature of Explosion — is important in 
any practical use of explosives* The method generally 
is to drop successive small portions of explosive on 
the surface of a heated Wood*s metal bath or melting 
point block. The temperature is raised at a steady rate 
until a fresh portion of the sample explodes or defla¬ 
grates* Methods using glass tubes and only one portion 
of sample are unreliable* 

There is an induction period before explosion takes 
place* This period is shorter as the temperature is 
raised. At the explosion temperature recorded, there 
should be an induction period of 5 seconds, or less. 

(2) Hot Wire Ignition — This is a preliminary test 
to the sand test* A short resistance wire is surround¬ 
ed by an explosive. The wire is raised to a red heat, 
or exploded, by an electric current. If the sample de¬ 
tonates it may be used alone in the sand test. Other¬ 
wise an initiator must be used. The test is also use¬ 
ful as an igniter in determining whether an initiator 
deflagrates or detonates in free air.

(3) Power Teats 


There are several methods 


(a) the sand test (4,11) 

(b) the Trauzl expansion test (4) 

(c) the ballistic mortar (4) 

(d) the Hopkinson pressure bar (12,13). 

The sand test is the simplest and has the widest 
application. The explosive is loaded into a small metal 
(aluminium) detonator shell. It may be packed loosely 
or pressed to a know*} density• A sulfur plug containing 
an iron resistance wire is placed in the shell. The wire 
protrudes slightly so that it is in contact with the ex¬ 
plosive. The top of the shell is crimped and molten sul¬ 
fur poured in to fill and seal it. The steel bomb has a 
cylindrical cavity 6 x if inches. The cover has two small 
holes for the electrical firing wires. The cavity is half 
filled with standard Ottawa sand (20-30 mesh). The deton¬ 
ator shell is placed in an upright position in the centre 
of the cavity. Then the bomb is filled with sand and the 
cover clamped on. The amount of sand is previously weigh¬ 
ed. After firing the explosive electrically the bomb is 
taken apart. The sand is screened through 30, 60, 100 
mesh screens after removing any metal fragments. The 
weight of sand on each screen is recorded. The weight 
of sand crushed smaller than 30 mesh is a measure of the 
power of the explosive.

The test may be used for the power of initiators, 
their ability to initiate high explosives, and the power 
of high explosives. 

(4) The Friction Test — The usual friction test appar¬ 
atus (14,18) consists of a curved shoe which swings over 
a concave anvil. The explosive is placed on the anvil. 

The pendulum is raised to a position on a scale and re¬ 
leased. The number of swings required to detonate the 
explosive is determined. 

The "Dupont tester" is used to give an indication of 
the sensitiveness of an explosive to a glancing blow. A 
hard steel torpedo slides down inclined rails and strikes 
the explosive placed on a steel anvil. Thus the explosive 
is subjected to a glancing impact. 

(5) The Impact Test — Perhaps the most important test 
is that of sensitiveness to impact. Yet impact data are 
the most unreliable of all explosive data. 

A layer of explosive is placed between two hard steel 
surfaces and subjected to an impact. The impact is from a 
falling weight and is transmitted by the upper plate or 
column. There are many designs of apparatus (4,6,12,14, 
15). 

The sensitiveness of an explosive to impact is depen¬ 


dent upon:

(a) its explosive properties

(e) the shape of the confining surfaces 

(f) the hardness of the confining surfaces 

(g) the degree of confinement (pressure, density) 

(h) the striking weight used 

(i) the height of fall of the weight 

(j) the elasticity and shape of the weight 

(k) the rigidity of the system. 

There may be other factors. The failure to record more 
than h, i, and perhaps £ and d is the main reason for the 
unreliability of impact results* 


In determining sensitiveness to impact a statistical 
method (6) must be used. At least 20 trials should be 
made at each height for a given weight* The heights should 
be selected to give a range of explosions from 10 to 90$. 
The height for 50$ explosions of 20 trials is generally 
taken as the critical height*

DESCRIPTION OF APPARATUS AND EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 


(1) The Sand Test — The apparatus was made according 
to specifications from Colver (4). Some details of di¬ 
mensions are given in the Appendix Figure 1* 

The detonator shells were of aluminium 4.7 centi¬ 
metres long and 0.53 centimetres in diameter. The re¬ 
sistance wire of the plugs was 30 gauge standard iron 
wire. Sulfur plugs were made up in the laboratory using 
sections of detonator shells as moulds. The Ottawa stand¬ 
ard sand was within the limits of 20 to 30 mesh. 

The explosives were weighed accurately after press¬ 
ing to a recorded pressure in the shell. The sand was 
weighed to the nearest decigram before and after the trial. 
The current used was such that the resistance wires were 
exploded. All the exploded shells were placed in envel¬ 
opes and labelled. 

(2) The Friction Test -- The usual friction test was 
considered unsatisfactory. The "Dupont tester" involves 
impact as well as friction. A satisfactory test of the 
sensitiveness to "pure" friction was desirable. 

Dr. Kendrick of the University of Toronto reported 
a preliminary apparatus consisting of two steel plates 
with explosive between clamped in a hydraulic vise#

One of the plates was struck on an end with a hammer 
to produce the frictional effects. 


It was decided to build a friction apparatus with 
a known moving force and with the friction between the 
moving plate and the load eliminated. 

Friction Machine Number 1 — a diagramatic sketch is 
seen in Figure 1. The steel pendulum (T) was hung on 
a bearing. The load was applied to the plates (2) and 
( 5 ) by a roller (4)• Besides easy revolution, this rol¬ 
ler was able to move only in a vertical direction. The 
plates were of mild steel. 

The operation of the apparatus was as follows 
The plates were polished on grade 0 emery paper and 
carefully wiped. About 1 milligram of explosive was 
dusted on the lower plate so that it was directly under 
the applied load. The upper plate was placed on top, 
protruding to the point of rest of the pendulum. The 
load was applied by lowering the roller. The pendulum 
was drawn back to a position on the scale and released. 

The impact forced the upper plate over the lower plate. 

The pendulum was allowed a follow-through of 1 centimetre, 
where it was bounced back by a rubber stop. The plates 
were examined microscopically after each trial. 

The resistance offered to the movement of the upper

plate is due to the friction developed between the plates 
under the load. This frictional effect could be increas¬ 
ed by increasing the load and/or the initial velocity of 
the plate, i.e. by increasing the striking force of the 
pendulum. If the load and velocity were great enough suf¬ 
ficient frictional effects were developed in the explosive 
to cause its detonation. The explosion was very audible. 

Some difficulties were encountered with this first 
apparatus. The steel plates were found to be "ploughed" 
in places. Under the applied load the plates were forc¬ 
ed into intimate contact. Bonds or welds were formed be¬ 
tween the plates and when the upper plate moved these 
welds tore or "ploughed" the metal. It was hoped to 
avoid this by the use of very hard steel plates. How¬ 
ever, these were ploughed in the same manner. Plates 
of plate glass were tried but they shattered when an 
explosion occured. 

According to Bowden (16) this ploughing effect is 
a commonplace factor of the friction between two metals. 
Agreement with Bowden was obtained on the tearing of met¬ 
als even at low speeds and small loads. The phenomenon 
occurs with all metals independent of hardness and the 
only remedy seemed to be effective lubrication. However, 
as ploughing did not occur in every trial it was decided

to have a few sets of mild steel plates made. Trials 
in which ploughing occurred were not considered and the 
plates were polished down when the ploughing was exces¬ 
sive* 


As trials proceeded with new plates the number of 
positive results under given conditions was found to in¬ 
crease with time. Constant results were difficult to 
obtain. It was suspected that the coefficient of fric¬ 
tion between the two plates was varying with the extent 
of the polish. This was confirmed in the literature (17)* 
The coefficient of friction between two metal plates di¬ 
minished as the extent of polish increased, reached a min¬ 
imum at a certain polish and then increased very rapidly. 
For this reason the design of the apparatus was changed* 

Friction Machine Number 2 — The large upper plate was 
replaced by a much smaller surface. The effective sur¬ 
face could be covered completely with explosive, avoid¬ 
ing fthe contact of steel on steel* 

Figure 2 is a diagramatic sketch. A more detailed 
drawing is shown in'Figure 5L in the Appendix. The strik¬ 
ing system was changed only by the addition of a 5 pound 
lead weight (JT) clamped to the end of the pendulum (T) • 
This weight shifted the center of percussion to the end 
of the pendulum. The upper plate was the head (3) of a 
3/8 inch bolt. The effective surface was 1.35 centimeters

in diameter. The bolt was threaded into a steel bar 
(2) which rested on a roller (6) at one end and on 
the bolthead at the other end. The lower plate @ 
was one of the plates of the first apparatus. The 
load was supplied by a roller (5) resting directly 
above the bolthead. 

The trials were carried out in a similar manner 
to those on the first apparatus. The lower plate was 
cleaned with a rubber eraser and a cloth. The explo¬ 
sive was dusted on the plate, covering the entire area 
upon which the bolthead rested. The bar was placed on 
the roller (jT) with the bolthead covering the explosive. 
The roller (5) was lowered and the weight attached. 

Then the pendulum was drawn back and released. Upon 
impact the bar moved forward over roller ( 6 ) and under 
roller (5). The surface of the bolthead was always 
covered with explosive so that there was no contact of 
steel on steel and no ploughing. 

(5) Impact Apparatus — The design was one used by 
East (4) and modified slightly. There were three main 
types of systems used. 

Type I is shown in Figure 3 and in Figure 3 in the 
Appendix. The essential parts are the hammer (l) and 
the anvil (§} • They are held in place by the outer 
retainer (3) and the guard ring (T) • The base (5),

^6) embedded in a concrete block. The hammer and anvil 
were of hard, heat-treated nickel steel with circular 
striking surfaces 0,95 centimetres in diameter. 

The procedure was as follows : the explosive was 
dusted in a thin layer on the anvil* The apparatus -was 
assembled and the nuts on the rods (£) tightened. By 
means of a lever arm the charge was pre-pressed to a 
definite pressure and the pressure released. Then a 
cylindrical mild steel weight was dropped from a re¬ 
corded height by an electro-magnet. The hammer and 
anvil were examined. A positive result (detonation) 
could be distinguished easily. There was no noise of 
the explosion. 

In preliminary testing only 5 trials were done at 
each height. Later, 20 trials at each height were found 
ne cessary. 

The hammer and anvil surfaces were cleaned after 
each trial by polishing on grade 0 emery paper. The 
difficulty of keeping the surface perfectly plane was 
very great. As a result the effective impact area of 
the surfaces was roughly 1/10 of the original area. 

For trials on sensitive detonators S.K.F. steel 
balls were substituted for the mild steel weights.

Type II was designed to prevent the hammer from boun¬ 
cing after impact of the weight. 

The system is shown in Figure 4 and in Figure 3 
in the Appendix. A flat steel plate (T) rested on the 
hammer. This plate had a circular opening ( 2 ) in the 
centre enabling the steel ball to strike the hammer di¬ 
rectly. The edges of the opening were bevelled to avoid 
impact of the ball. A lever arm system connected to the 
plate provided loads from 50 to 300 pounds. 

The accuracy of dropping the steel balls was im¬ 
proved. They were suspended electromagnetically from 
a point surrounded by a rubber ring. Experiments were 
carried out with hammers and anvils 3/8 inch and l/4 
inch in diameter. 

Type III Reproducible results were obtained with Type 
II only when the impact surfaces remained constant. 
However, this was found very difficult to do. 

Type III apparatus seen in Figure 5 was introduc¬ 
ed in hope that the impact surfaces would be reproduc¬ 
ible. A steel ball (3) 3/8 inch in diameter was placed 
between the 3/8 inch hammer (T) and the anvil (2}. It 
fitted closely in the guard ring (4J. The pressure 
plate (5) was retained. 


The system was subjected to numerous impacts of

one of the larger weights. Circular indentations were 
produced in the hammer and anvil. After several im¬ 
pacts these cup-shaped indentations became constant in 
size. The diameter of the indentation in the anvil was 
measured by a cathetometer and found constant through¬ 
out the experiments. 

The explosive was dusted evenly in this indenta¬ 
tion. The apparatus was assembled and trials carried 
out as for Type II.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 


1. The Sand Test 

Some preliminary tests were made on lead azide 
"unprotected" and "protected" (i.e. sample precipi¬ 
tated in a very dilute gelatin solution). Results 
are given in Table I.

These results compare well with those obtained by 
Clark (18) as shown in Figure 6. The same size and 
type of bomb was used. There may have been slight 
differences in the type of detonator shell. One re¬ 
sult from an initiator test (see Table II) with pro¬ 
tected lead azide and T.N.T. is shown in Figure 6. 

The T.N.T. was not detonated. The result is low be¬ 
cause some energy of explosion was used in compress¬ 
ing the T.N.T.

The compound showed no apparent initiating ability.

was found in other borderline initiators. (See lead 
methazonate.)

Compound 106 was tried as a booster between the

However, in two trials the tin salt failed to detonate. 
In the third trial the tin salt detonated but failed 
to detonate the 106 or P.E.T.N. These results indi¬ 
cate the unreliability of the tin salt under the con¬ 
ditions of the test.

The lead salt of methazonic acid was prepared 
HO — N — CH — CH“N0g — Pb^~ OgN = CH — CH= N - OH 
according to Dunstan and Goulding (20). The salt is 
brown colored, exploding with a sharp crack on the 

o 

melting point block at approximately 210 C. 


In the sand test this compound showed no detonating

ly increasing pressure. There was no shattering effect 
(no crushed sand). 


Tests on Pentaerythrltol tetranltrate P.E.T.N. 

P.E.T.N. was prepared in the laboratory by the 
nitration of pentaerythrltol. A sample of technical 
P.E.T.N. was obtained from Dr. Wright. The two samples 
were re crystallized by dissolving in acetone and pour¬ 
ing into water. They melted at the same temperature, 

o o 

139 - 140 C. The samples were detonated by lead azide 
in the sand test. A sample containing CdO was test¬ 
ed. Results are given in Table VI.

The results show the prepared and technical P.E.T.N.

the power. The small weight of protected lead azide 
used shows the sensitiveness of P.E.T.N. to be much

greater than that of T.N.T. (P.E.T.N. is 5 times 
more sensitive to impact than is T.N.T.) 


2. The Friction Test 

(1) Friction Machine No. 1 — the compound tested 
was stannous methylenedinitramine. Several tests 
were made on lead azide and mercury fulminate but 
these required loads which caused excessive plough¬ 
ing. Results of stannous methylenedinitramine are 
given in Table VII.

distances on the pendulum* This region drops apprec¬ 
iably as the load is increased. The last result in 
Table VII is rather out of place. As the error in 10 
trials is at least 10/6 this divergent result is to be 
expected. The results are more clearly defined than 
in the impact apparatus. 

The relation between load, pendulum distance &nd 
percentage positive results is not a simple one. 

Preliminary trials on fulminate and lead azide 
gave results roughly in accordance with their impact 
sensitivities. 

A series of trials was carried out with mild 
steel plates, omitting trials in which ploughing 
occurred, and polishing down when ploughing became 
excessive. Table VIII shows results obtained with 
the tin salt on a new set of these plates.

An 

increase in the frictional effects commences 

with 

the 

third result. With a smaller 

load an 

indi- 


cation of further rise is seen in the last result. 
These results show the effect of steel on steel fric¬ 
tion and the importance of avoiding it.

The horizontal distance from the point of rest of 
the pendulum. Up to 60 cm. this distance is approx- 
inately the same as that on Friction Machine No. 1. 

As before, these results show a clearly defined 
critical region. The values for stannous methylene- 
dinitramine are about the same as on Machine No. 1. 
The friction sensitiveness parallels impact sensitive- 
ness for the three compounds. However, a much wider 
range of compounds must be used to show that this is 
a general occurrence. 

If the explosion of a sample was due to the gen¬ 
eration of frictional heat sufficient to raise a por¬ 
tion of the sample to the explosion point, then the 
friction sensitivities would parallel the explosion 
points of the compounds. This is not so. Stannous 
methylenedinitramine and mercury fulminate have ap¬ 
proximately the same explosion temperature (190- 
200°C.). Lead azide explodes around 330°C. 

When a negative result occurred the plates were 
examined microscopically. For the three compounds 
tested an "ice" was observed. That is, the crystal-

lites had been forced together by pressure and move¬ 
ment to form a transparent sheet. The phenomenon was 
called "icing" by analogy to the formation of ice from 
snow under pressure. This ice only occurred when there 
was probability of detonation. Below the pressure and 
force required for positive results icing was not not¬ 
iceable. The ice appeared the same for all three com¬ 
pounds in their critical regions. 

Tests of Tracer-Igniter Compositions and Gunpowders 

Dr. Downing of the University of Toronto sent ten 
samples of tracer-igniter mixtures and gunpowders to 
be tested. They were too insensitive for the range of 
the present apparatus. Most of the tracer-igniter com¬ 
pounds contained metallic magnesium particles. Micro¬ 
scopic examination showed that these particles prevent¬ 
ed the full frictional loading of the crystalline mat¬ 
erial -- the crystalline material was not compressed 
or moved. Samples containing these particles of metal 
will not give satisfactory results in this test unless 
the pressure greatly exceeds the flow pressure of the 
metal. The test does show the effect of desensitis¬ 
ing or coating agents on the compounds. One of the 
samples contained paraffin wax as a desensitizer. 

When it was tested the plate moved much farther than 
was usual under the conditions of the test. The wax 
lubricated the surfaces very efficiently. Samples

containing chlorinated rubber and resins were not 
protected to such a degree. 

3• Impact Test . 

Some Energy Relations in the Impact Test . 

Impact test results could be given in different 
ways, depending on the theory of detonation. Taylor 
and Weale (6) found that the probability of detona¬ 
tion depended upon the kinetic energy of the falling 
weight. For a given sample the product of the weight 
and the critical height (for 50% explosions) was con¬ 
stant for a small range of weights and heights. 

They mention that, using mild steel hammers and 
anvils, much greater energies were required to cause 
ignitions and smaller weights appear to produce igni¬ 
tions with less kinetic energies than did larger 
weights. This was attributed to deformation of the 
mild steel. 

Their criterion for a striking weight is an 
inelastic mass. The striking weights used were hard¬ 
ened steel balls which are very elastic. Such balls 
would bounce appreciably. No mention of the bounce 
was made • 

Urbanski (21) attributes the innovation of the 
determination of the rebound of the falling weight 
to Wohler and Wenzelberg. Urbanski records the re-

bound height and subtracts it from the original 
height thus obtaining an effective height* 

Powell and Ubbelohde (22) support the view that 
the probability of explosion is determined by the mo¬ 
mentum of the blow. A fraction of this momentum may 
be lost due to imperfect rigidity of the system. 

Dr. Johns, Department of Physics (private com¬ 
munication), suggested that the probability of ex¬ 
plosion might be governed by the impulse of the blow 
and not by the kinetic energy of the weight* The 
value of impulse is derived as follows : 

Impulse - Force x time.

The equations (i) and (ii) were used in calculat¬ 
ing the impulse and kinetic energy. 

(a) Type I Impact Apparatus 

The apparatus as first constructed had a suitable 
range for high explosives as well as initiators. 

The first tests were made on a basis of the height 
for no explosions in five trials. The compounds were 
generally pre-pressed to approximately 2000 pounds per 
square inch. In this preliminary work the extent of 
pre-pressing w%s not very important. 

Dr. G. Fi Wright had mentioned the effect of cad¬ 
mium salts in sensitising high explosives such as 
P.E.T.N. It was hoped to sensitise high explosives 
into an initiator range. Results of tests on some 
initiators, high explosives, and mixtures are given in 
in Table X. 

The added substances had a definite sensitising 
effect on P.E.T.N. The metals were the most effic¬ 
ient sensitisers. However, the sensitisation is not 
enough to bring the high explosive into the range of 
initiating explosive.

trials were found more satisfactory. Lead azide, pro¬

The ft Bounce Effect” -- Tn testing the stannous me thy 1-

weight. A 28.1 gm. S.K.F. steel ball (f inch diameter) 
was used. As the tests proceeded it was noticed that, 
when the small ball bounced back on the hammer, the

result was usually positive. Twenty trials were made 
catching the ball after impact. Then 20 trials were 
made in which the ball was forced by a paper collar 
to strike the hammer again after bouncing. The results 
were as follows 

No bounce striking 28.1 gm. wt., 127 cm. — 15$ Firing. 
All bounces striking 28.1 gm. wt., 50 cm. — 75$ Firing. 
Therefore the bounce of the falling weight is very 
important in impact tests. (This work done before ob¬ 
taining references 21, 22.) 

Further trials were carried out to determine whether 
the bounce effect was due to an activation of the explo¬ 
sive by the first blow. Results are shown in Table XII.

A definite activation effect is shown. This hardjy 
seems to be explained by a "resonance” phenomena as 
suggested by Carl (9). The time between impacts is of 
the order of 0.4 seconds. In several trials the ball 
bounced out of the retaining collar. It was picked up 
and dropped from the approximate height of bounce. A 
positive result was obtained in most cases. The time 
between impacts in this case would be about 1 second. 

(b) Type II Impact Apparatus 

The compounds tested were more sensitive with 
this system (under pressure) than with Type I appar¬ 
atus. This is shown in Table XIII.

The sensitiveness also varied with the load on 
the hammer and anvil during impact. Some indication 
of this is seen in Table XIV.

The percentage increases with load to a maximum 
then decreases at higher loads. Further tests were 
made on Type III apparatus. 

The 3/8 inch diameter hammer and anvil which had 
been used became too short for Type II apparatus. A 
new J inch diameter set was made. It was very diffi¬ 
cult to make the impact surfaces perfectly flat and 
keep them so. Cleaning on emery paper after each ti?ial 
produced rounded ends in spite of precautions. Results 
became quite irregular as the surface changed. Therefore, 
Type III apparatus was used.

Trials were made on stannous methylenedinitramine.

rises quite sharply, remains horizontal over quite a 
range, then drops sharply. The points obtained were 
quite far apart. A more detailed investigation might 
show a maximum value. It is very probable that the 
maximum range (or value) would differ for various in¬ 
itiators. Some indication of this was obtained with 
Type II apparatus. 

The falling weights and heights were varied with 
constant load. The results for stannous methylene- 
dinitramine are shown in Table XVI and plotted in Fig¬ 
ure 9. 


The first two results gave a slope (Fig. 9) which 
was expected for this sensitive compound. This com¬ 
pares well with Powell and TJbbelohde (22). 

When higher weights were used the percentage 
detonation was lower in spite of the larger impulse. 
According to Taylor and Weale (6) this indicates de¬ 
formation or a lack of rigidity. 

There was no sign of deformation in the metal 
parts. They had been subjected to some 2000 impacts 
and would be strain hardened. The indentation in the 
anvil remained constant. 

A lack of rigidity in the system would be expect¬ 
ed at higher heights for the larger weights. But at 




















































the heights used this should not be present. This is 
shown by the high values of e. obtained for the larger 
weights. These were approximately 0.1 higher than 
values obtained with no sample at the same heights 
with Type I apparatus. Values of e^ are higher for a 
rigid system than for a non-rigid system.

It 

Is proposed here 

that the 

inefficiency of the 


larger weights is not entirely due to a lack of rig¬ 
idity in the system. There is another factor, namely.

the duration of impact. According to Rebuff© (23) the 
time of impact of hardened steel balls, of mass m and 
radius r, on a hard steel plate is proportional to 
^ and to/ 1 where v is the velocity at 

impact. The mass is seen to be most important. In 
this system the range of weights used was large, where¬ 
as the range of velocities was quite small. To illus¬ 
trate this compare the time of impact of the 66.6 gm. 
ball (radius 0.9 cm.) falling from 120 cm. with that 
of the 225 gm. ball (radius 1.45 cm.) falling from 60 
cm. Assume the time of impact oc ^ m^j^/5^ 1 j^/5 #

Therefore the larger weights have a greater time of 
impact i.e. the impact compression of the explosive 
is slower than for small weights.

Starting with the 7i>h result in Table XVT the system 
shows a breakdown. The results are irregular. The 
values of e_ for the same weight and conditions shows 
a very noticeable drop (compare numbers 1 and 11, 3 
and 12). This drop indicates a new lack of rigidity. 
The change is probably due to a breakdown of the con¬ 
crete base under the base plate (see Figure 3). The 
rigidity of the base plate depends on the concrete 
beneath it and the tightness of the holding bolts. 
Concrete dust was observed around the boltholes in 
the base plate. A massive rigid base of iron or steel 
(such as used by Taylor and Weale (6), Powell and TJb- 
belohde (22)) would overcome this difficulty. A base 
plate secured to the base independently of the outer 
retainer is also recommended. 

Microscopic examination of negative results with 
Types ii and III apparatus showed ice formation sim¬ 
ilar to that found with the friction apparatus. Stan¬ 
nous methylenedinitramine showed ice formation with 
pressure alone. This was found even at the smallest 
lo%ds used. Mercury fulminate and lead azide showed 
no signs of icing with pressure alone over the entire 
range. These compounds required impact to form ice. 

Stannous methylenedinitramine gave partial det¬ 
onations with Types I and II apparatus but very few

spot to another. Mercury fulminate and lead azide did

A DISCUSSION OF THEORY 


The results just presented are not conclusive. 

In summary they indicate a number of effects assoc¬ 
iated with detonation. 

1. An activation energy connected with the mechan¬ 
ical blow. 

2. The dependence of detonation on impact (ft). 

3. A relation between static pressure and impact 
sensitiveness. 

4. The importance of time of impact (time occurs in 
impact, ft). 

5. A parallel between impact and friction sensitive¬ 
ness. 

It is worth while to correlate these indications 
with what is already known of the detonation phenomen¬ 
on, in a tentative theory of detonation. At the.same 
time it will be pointed out where data is lacking, and 
what further work may be done. 

All explosives are thermochemically unstable -- the 
reaction, explosive —* products, is exothermic (irrespect¬ 
ive of whether an explosive is endothermically or exo¬ 
thermically formed from its elements ). But there is no 
relation between this thermal instability and the com¬ 
pound^ sensitiveness. Sutton (23) has suggested the

following criteria for a good explosive (high or init¬ 
iating) : 

1* like atoms should be linked, 

2. where unlike atoms are linked there should be small 
differences in electronegativity, 

3. resonance in the molecule as a whole should be 
avoided. 

The value of an initiator arises from (a) higji 
sensitivity to mechanical impact (b) enough power to 
initiate explosion in another explosive. Both qual¬ 
ities do not necessarily occur in the same compound. 

High explosives possess only the second. Some com¬ 
pounds only posses 3 the first. Stannous methylene- 
dinitramine, for instance, has little or no power but 
great sensitivity. Lead azide and mercury fulminate 
possess both qualities. This is proven not only by 
the sand bomb test, but also in the impact test* No 
partials are observed for these two. If one part is 
initiated, all goes off. The tin salt, on the other 
hand, gives many partials. 

Theoretically any thermodynamically unstable crys¬ 
tal should explode under favorable circumstances (acti¬ 
vation energy). The principle question is why are some 
sensitive to mechanical impact while others are not. 

Seldom in explosives work do we meet with single crystals.

Rather, explosives are a large number of small imper¬ 
fect crystals or crystallites. Any theory of detona¬ 
tion must take this into account when interpreting 
experimental data. The density of the aggregate is 
always less than that of the single crystal, and even 
under several hundred atmospheres it only approaches 
it. Thus lead azide crystal density D - 4.79, at 200 
atmospheres per cm 2 D ; 2.90 and at 800 atmospheres 
per cm 2 D = 3.50 (Muraour (7)). 

A slow compression does not explode an initiator, 
but a fast one may. Even under slow compression, how¬ 
ever, it is inconceivable that crystals will not be 
broken — crushed and rubbed against each other, at 
some points, at quite a rapid rate; yet they do not 

detonate. This makes it difficult to accept the theory 

a 

of Taylor and Weale, which is kind of surface reaction 
theory --a making and breaking of bonds between crys¬ 
tals. Slow compression allows time for closer packing 
of the crystals so that the density approaches crystal 
density. At the same time , the increased packing means 
larger effective crystal surface presented to the faces 
of the hammer and anvil in the impact test. Thus, while 
the blow delivered to the anvi'l is kept constant, it is 
distributed.over more crystal surface — hence it is 
less effective. This is shown by experiments on the 
tin salt -- where beyond a certain pressure the sen-

sitivity apparently dropped. But a certain amount of 
pressure increases sensitivity. This is because the 
ordinary loose powder soaks up some of the energy of 
impact in becoming packed. Thus pre-pressing in the 
first experiments gave more reproducible results. 

What occurs at the optimum pressure? The specif¬ 
icity of a crystal to detonation indicates that deton¬ 
ation is connected with interatomic, ionic or molecu¬ 
lar forces. Garner and Gomm (25) distinguish between 
thermal decomposition (energy of activation = 50,000 
cal per mol) and detonation (energy of activation^ - m 
150,000 cal per mol, corrected by Sutton (26)) for 
lead azide. The first involves single molecules of 
PbN 0 , and the second (Sutton (26)) involves 3 mole¬ 
cules simultaneously. Sutton suggests that detonation 
is closely connected with crystalline structure. Pure 
thermal decomposition is probably a surface phenomenon; 
detonation is probably an internal phenomenon. 

If this is so it should be possible to correlate 
the nature and composition of the internal structure 
with the ease of detonation. Most initiators are salt- 

The activation energy suggested by the present exper¬ 
iments arises from mechanical impulse. Gamer and Gomm f s 
activation for detonation is measured by determining the 
temperature coefficient of the time lag to detonation at 
de t ona ti on te mpe ra tur eS •

like compounds — usually a heavy metal cation linked 
with a complex anion. The nature of the pure electro- 
valent bond between oppositely charged ions has been 
expressed theoretically by Bom, in the form of a po¬ 
tential energy curve. 



This represents the energy of a molecule as a 

function of r, the distance between the atomic nuclei. 

At great distances an attraction operates based on 

Coulomb*s law -e^ ; at smaller distances a repulsion 
r 

+ b , due to the closed electron shells (Pauli ex- 

r * 1 

elusion principle) comes into operation. Thus poten¬ 
tial energy - b -©Ce^ for oppositely charged ions. 
~r rr r 

b, ©c. and n are constants characteristic for each sub¬ 
stance. n is of the order of 10 for the alkali halides. 


The tensile strength of an electrostatically bound 
crystal should be determined largely by the attractive

forc© terra. Joffe (27) found that if precautions were 
taken to avoid surface cracks, the tensile strength of 
a rock salt crystal actually was not far from the theo¬ 
retical value, 200 kg. per mm. 2 . Compressibility data 
are used for calculating the value of the repulsive 
term; the equilibrium distance r p will be determined 
largely from such data. TJnfortuhately, very little 
compressibility data are known for salts, except for 
the alkali halides. But certain generalizations can 
be made • 

The character of a bond depends on the electro¬ 
negativity of the atoms. The alkalies and alkaline 
earths give up electrons (8 electron shells) more effect¬ 
ively -- they are more electropositive than the heavy 
metals (18 electon shells). Thus the bonding of heavy 
metals has lees electrostatic character and so is looser 
-- larger r© values. This is born out by Richard*s 
data (28). 

Richards has correlated the tightness of the elec¬ 
trostatic binding (contraction) with the heat of forma¬ 
tion of chlorides from the elements. Alkali and alka¬ 
line earth chlorides show large contraction and large 
heats of formation. The chlorides of the 18 electron 
closed-shell metals show small heats of formation, and 

on 

contraction bonding. Thus, the heavy metal chlorides 


are more compressible

Let us apply these generalizations to Initiators 
and related crystals. Muraour (7) pointed out that the 
heavy metal salts of hydrazoic and fulminic acids were 
much more sensitive to impact than the corresponding 
alkali and alkaline earth salts (Table XVII). All are 
thermally unstable and their temperatures of thermal 
decomposition are much the same.

X-ray crystallographic examination shows that for 
both the alkali azides and heavy metal azides (see Paul¬ 
ing (29) for NaN 3 , KN 3 , AgN 3 ) the azide groups and the 
metallic ions are effectively in successive layers. 

There is no significant difference in the relative posi¬ 
tions of the parts. The only significant difference 
then, is the fact that the heavy metals form bonds with 
less electrostatic or ionic characters -- looser -- more 
compressible•

This, along with the fact that thermal instab¬ 
ility alone is not a criterion of sensitiveness,and 
that sensitiveness increases with rise in temperature 
(Taylor and Weal© (6)) and so does compressibility 
(Bridgeman (30)) leads one to propose that sensitive¬ 
ness to detonation is characterized by ease of compres¬ 
sibility or looseness of bonding in a thermochemically 
unstable compound. Contributing factor (to thermal 
instability) may be the fact that the heavy metals can 
exist in the free state on decomposition, whereas the 
alkali metals cannot* 

How do these possibilities "explain” detonation? 

A mechanical blow does two things to a crystal (a) com¬ 
pression (b) subsequent recovery if the elastic limits 
are not exceeded (reversible). We propose that the first 



part is the important part* This has not been 
experiments could be demised to do so. 


If compression is irreversible the body rearranges 
and if an explosive it fluty explode. Whether the compres¬ 
sion is reversible or not will depend on (a) the magni¬ 
tude of the blow, (b) the nature of the substance itself 
— bonding, etc., (c) the time of impact. If a blow of 
a certain magnitude is slowly applied, ordinary compres¬ 
sion spreading through the crystal, or even flow may oc¬ 
cur. But, if applied rapidly enough, the biow may not be 


"absorbed” rapidly enough to prevent its breaking softer

wink (15)). The alkali azides can absorb and spread 
such a blow more effectively than heavy metal azides 


and fulminates 



A SUMMARY OP PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS 


This thesis reports preliminary work on the subject. 
The work has suggested further experiments. 

1. In the sand bomb test the iron wire bridge should be 
replaced by a platinum foil bridge to obtain a greater 
thermal impulse for salts such as stannous methylene- 
dinitramine• 

2. The present base of the impact apparatus should be 
replaced by a massive iron or steel base. A hardened 
steel base plate should be fastened to the base by a 
number of independent bolts. 

3. The rigidity of the system might be determined by 
determining the coefficient of restituion over a wide 
range of velocities of the weights. A plot of these 
should give a straight line relationship for a rigid 
system. Where deformation takes place a change of slope 

of the line will occur. (Andrews, Phil Mag. 9 607 (1930)). 

4. Tests should be made to determine whether the bounce 
(activation) effect is present in Types II and III appar¬ 
atus. If it is present it could be investigated further 
by using two steel balls in successive impacts from dif¬ 
ferent heights. 

5. A wide range of compounds should be tested on both 
friction and impact apparatus to determine the relation¬ 
ship between the tests. 

6. The "ice" formed should be examined under a polar-

izing microscope to follow the strains. 

7. The effect of the time of impact should be inves¬ 
tigated — by the use of balls of different masses or 
methods involving a pendulum or magnetic forces. 

8* Determine the optimum static pressures in impact 
sensitivity to see if there is a specific pressure for 
each explosive. 

9. Determine whether comprssion or release is the im¬ 
portant part of impact.
