- ABSTRACT - 


Many difficulties arise in the leaching operation 
of the cyanidation process with arsenical and antimoniacal 
gold ore concentrates. The difficulties which affect gold 
recovery are mainly due to the presence of sulphides and 
not due to the arsenic and antimony content directly. 

Control of soluble lead salt additions can be benefic¬ 
ial in the cyanidation of these ores. The presence of lead 
has a dual effect, both of whioh are involved in a mineral 
coating mechanism. First, the lead partially controls the 
adsorption of sulphide ions on the gold surface. Second, 
the lead itself adsorbs on the gold surface if in excess 
concentration and reduces gold dissolution. The effect of 
the lead film is far less serious than the sulphide film. 

All ores containing sulphur are not detrimental to 
gold recovery, the adverse effects depending on the solu¬ 
bilities in an alkaline cyanide solution.

INTRODUCTION 

The purpose of this investigation, the results 
of which are reported herein, was to determine 
principally, the effect of lead salts on cyanide 
consumption and gold recovery in the cyanidation 
of arsenical and antimoniacal gold ores. Most of 
the investigations were concerned with the dis¬ 
solution of gold leaf in various arsenic-antimony- 
sulphur-lead-cyanide solutions. This approach was 
adopted because of its simplicity and ease with 
which trends could be established. 

The frequency of occurrence of arsenic and 
antimony minerals in ores, the difficulties en¬ 
countered in the cyanidation of such ores and the 
fact that the addition of lead salts in practice 
often seemed to give beneficial results in the 
cyanidation of sulphide ores, prompted these in¬ 
vestigations. In particular, some theoretical 
aspects of work done by Chalmers and Lauer (1) 
using copper-gold ores, seemed worthy of further 
investigations as applied to arsenical and anti¬ 
moniacal ores. 

Much of the work done confirmed the results 
obtained by other investigators. Further results 
obtained should be considered as indicative trends 
rather than quantitative results. In some cases 
the amount of lead salts to add to get optimum 
results can be predicted.

THEORY OF THE CYaNIDE PROCESS 

Tiie process of cyanidation can be separated 
into three main divisions: dissolution, precipitation, 
and cyanide regeneration* 

A. DISSOLUTION 

1. Dissolution Equations 

Several mechanisms have been 
proposed for the dissolution of gold* Most author¬ 
ities agree that the overall equation for the re¬ 
action is as follows: 

4Au 4 8NaCN 4 0 g 4 2H ? Q = 4NaAu(CN) 2 4 4NaOH 
This is known as Eisner’s equation* ( 24) 

Bodlaender ( 21) suggested that the following 
reaction takes place: 

2Au 4 4KCN 4 0 2 + 2H g 0 = 2KAu(CN) g 4 2K0H 4H g 0 2 
The hydrogen peroxide formed reacts: 

2Au 4 4KCN 4 H 2 0 g = 2KAu(CN) g 4 2K0H 
The overall equation is the same as that given by 
Eisner. 

Barsky, Swainson and Hedley (50) approached the 
problem from the n free energy change ” theory. They 
showed that the equation as suggested by Bodlaender 
indicates the most probable reaction that takes place 
in the dissolution of gold in cyanide solvents.

2* Factors Affecting the Dissolution of Gold * 

A# OXYGEN 

Eisner (2l|), Bodlaender (21), 

MacLaurin (23) and Christy (22) have shown that oxidation by 
oxygen or some other reagent is necessary in the cyanide 
process* 

Investigations carried out by Fahrenwald (ij.8) showed 
that in a solution containing cyanide and oxygen the rate 
of dissolution of gold Is directly proportional to the oxygen 
pressure provided that the cyanide strength of the solution 
is increased in the same ratio as the oxygen pressure* He 
found that the rate of dissolution of gold from an ore tends 
to Increase rapidly at first, reach a maximum and then 
diminish again* 

H.White (13) suggested that, since both cyanide and 
oxygen molecules must appear at the gold surface in the ratio 
called for by Eisner ! s equation, the rate of dissolution 
should be governed by the rates of diffusion of these two 
species of molecules* This depends upon both species in 
question and its concentration in solution* 

Chalmers and Lauer (1) proposed that the dissolution of 
gold in an oxygen-bearing cyanide solution Is a heterogeneous 
reaction of the type including the solid, ionic and gaseous 
states. A large increase in concentration with a subsequent 
increase in diffusion rate, of one of the molecules is at the 
expense of the other, resulting in a decreased rate of gold 
dissolution*

There are a number of substances such as hydrogen 
sulphide, sulfurous acid, and decomposed pyrite which 
are "reducers" and remove dissolved oxygen from cyanide 
solutions, thus retarding or stopping completely the 
action of the cyanide. 

Experiments in which oxygen was provided by chemical 
oxidizing agents such as potassium permanganate, sodium 
peroxide and ozone were a failure due to their cost and 
tendency to oxidize cyanides to cyanates which do not 
dissolve gold or silver. Organic substances such as nitro 
so-B-napthol, nitro-benzene, O-nitrophenol, and picric 
acid which have oxidizing properties, raise the solvent 
action of alkali cyanide on gold. 

Practical application of artificial oxidizers in the 
cyanidation process has been limited principally to the 
use of sodium peroxide and hydrogen peroxide. 

B. Alkalinity 

-tin alkaline condition in cyanide solutions 
is essential to prevent undue loss of cyanide. Lime and 
alkaline substances enter into numerous reactions in the 
process but have no solvent action upon the precious 
metals. 

Figure No.l (after Chalmers and Lauer)(l) indicates 
that a high pH would be preferable in cyanidation because 
of the complete dissociation of sodium cyanide.

Figure No. 1. Relationship Between pH and 
Dissooiation of HCN 


( After Chalmers and Lauer (1) ) 











High alkalinity can also he detrimental as in the 
case of oyaniding pyrrhotite and arsenopyrite (47). 

The alkaline constituents of the cyanide solution tend 
to attack these ores and produce undesirable products. 

In the cyanidation of an ore, the hydroxyl ion has 
three main functions: (34) 

1. Neutralization of the acid forming cyanicides 
in the ore. 

2. Suppression of the hydrolysis of the cyanide 
salt thus preventing the formation of hydrogen cyanide. 

3. Flocculation of particles of colloidal size thus 
increasing their settling rate. 

The method of increasing the alkalinity of cyanide 
solutions is an important factor. Barsky(50) found that 
lime, even in small amounts caused a very pronounced re¬ 
duction in the dissolution of gold, whereas, sodium hyd¬ 
roxide had but little effect below a pH of about thirteen 
This effect was also obtained by Fahrenwala (49) in his 
investigations on the effect of alkalinity in cyanidation 
He also showed that cyanide consumption and rate of dis¬ 
solution are not directly connected because both sodium 
sulphide and calcium oxide strongly inhibit the dissol¬ 
ution of gold but the cyanide loss in the case of the 
sodium sulphide is much greater than in the case of cal- 

i 

cium oxide. 

Use of an excessive alkalinity decreases the solu-

bility of native gold and silver, lessening the extrac¬ 
tion or increasing the time required for dissolution (51)* 
In practice, lime is used almost exclusively because 
of its cheapness* 

C* Temperature 

Temperature also plays an important part 

in the dissolution of gold in cyanide solutions. Raising 

the temperature increases the rate of dissolution up to a 
o 

maximum at 85 G after which there is a decrease in the rate 
of dissolution (53), However, increase in temperature also 
causes an increase in cyanide consumption* The most suit¬ 
able temperature at which to maintain solutions is between 
15°C and 20°C. 

D. Cyanide Strength 

The use of a strong solution of cyanide 
causes a higher consumption of cyanide mainly by the in¬ 
creased effect of the stronger solution upon the base 
metals and cyanic ides* Most plants use solutions around 
0*05%NaCN. 

MacLaurin (19) found that the rate of the solubility 
of gold in potassium cyanide solutions passes through a 
maximum in passing from concentrated to dilute solution, 
with a maximum dissolution occuring at 0*25% KCN or an 
equivalent 0.19% NaCN. He also explains that this variation 
is due to the decreased solubility of oxygen in cyanide 
solutions with increased concentration*

Barsky, Swainson and Hedley ( 49) more recently 
found that the maximum rate of dissolution was obtained 
with a 0.05% solution of sodium cyanide. They found that 
the solubility of oxygen was practically unaffected by 
the concentration of cyanide. 

Higher concentrations of cyanide increase the vis¬ 
cosity of the solution which would prevent diffusion of 
the molecules of oxygen (52). However, if oxygen is supp¬ 
lied as needed, higher concentrations of cyanide will 
dissolve more gold than weaker concentrations (40). 

E. Base Metals 

Considerable cyanide consumption is caused by 
the presence of base metals which are involved in various 
chemical reactions in which their complex cyanide and 
complex hydroxyl ions are formed. 

Investigational work carried out on the various 
minerals of copper, zinc, arsenic and antimony, and iron 
show that these minerals in general present special diffi¬ 
culties. 

Hamilton (54) suggested that the only harm done by 
the presence of these metals, other than the consumption 
they incur, is that there is a tendency to retard the 
activity of the solution due to an increase in the vis¬ 
cosity and the consequent resistance to the migration 
of ions. 

The zinc derived from precipitation does not seem

to affect extraction to any appreciable extent in the 
majority of instances but there are cases especially 
when treating ores containing arsenic and antimony where 
the presence of zinc lowers the extraction of silver as 
much as 10$ and in a less degree, that of gold. When 
zinc is found to have this effect, lead in solution will 
often act similarly and the addition of lead salts may 
have to be avoided (8). 

F. Electrochemical Reaction 

In all precipitation processes now in 
general use, electrochemical actio#, takes place, although 
the term w electrical precipitation " is usually limited 
to those methods in which current is supplied from an 
external source such as from a dynamo or cells. 

The relative position of the elements in the electro- 
chemical series probably has a bearing on the order and 
intensity of reactions taking place in the process of 
cyanidation. The metal lower in the electrochemical series 
accelerates the solution of the metal above it, that is, 
a metal tends to precipitate from solution another metal 
which is below it and replace it in solution. The series 
also depends on the nature of the solution in which the 
metals are placed. Conditions such as temperature, con¬ 
centration, and in case of gases, on the pressure, must 
be taken into account to correctly interpret the series.

The three main reasons for these abnormalities in 
electrode potential and position are as follows: (27) 

1. The mill solutions are far more dilute than 1 N 
in all dissolved constituents. 

2. The cyanide ion and hydroxyl ion concentration 
are independent. 

3. Certain common metals ( lead and aluminum) do 
not form complex fcyanides. The metals that do, show 
marked differences in the stability of the complex ion. 

The electromotive force of the common minerals are 
listed in the following table:

G. Sulphides 

Considerable contradiction exists as to 
the actual existence of the sulphide ion in ordinary- 
cyanide solutions. Clennel(38) states, " soluble sulph¬ 
ides can seldom be detected and in any case would rapidly 
be destroyed into thiocyanates or precipited as zinc 
sulphide”# 

Putnam(55) has shown that sulphide ion when present 
to the extent of more than 5 mg. per liter retards to an 
appreciable extent the dissolution of gold. He has also 
shown (31) that neither the oxygen depletion nor the thio 
cyanate formation hypothesis can adequately account for 
this retardation and suggests that the effect is caused 
by the adsorption of sulphide ion by the gold at the gold 
solution interface, thereby isolating the gold from the 
solution. 

Betell(33) found that the sulphides were present 
only rarely in cyanide solutions. 

Clevenger (44) noted that the absence of soluble 
sulphides from mill solutions was due to the following 
considerations: * 

1. Sulphides rapidly form sulphocyanates with the 
simple alkaline cyanides which are always present. 

2 • Alkaline sulphides rapidly oxidize to sulphates 
which cannot rise above a small percentage on account 
of the slight solubility of calcium sulphate.

3* Zinc taken into solution during precipitation 
appears to be as effective for their removal as lead 
salts added intentionally. 

Soluble sulphides can be produced in working cyanide 
solutions when treating arsenical and antimoniacal ores. 
These ores are decomposed by the alkali of the cyanide 
and by the lime. (39). 

H. Addition Reagents 

Cyanogen bromide has proved to be effective 
in increasing gold extraction (16). It has been used to 
date mainly with gold telluride ores which are dissolved 
with the greatest difficulty in ordinary cyanide solutions . 

The mechanism by which lead salts function as an 
addition reagent is not completely understood. The addition 
of these salts have been both beneficial and harmful# 

Clevenger (44) found that lead salts may accelerate 
the dissolution of silver from ores in which silver occurs 
as a sulphide. 

Holt (25) found that the presence of the proper pro¬ 
portion of lead salts greatly accelerates the dissolution 
of silver sulphide in cyanide solutions but that the lead 
salts retards the dissolution of the antimoniacal compounds 
of silver. 

Gritsuk (42) in cyaniding a pyrrhotitic gold ore, 
found that the use of litharge accelerated the dissolution

of gold and reduced reagent consumption. Further, with 
increasing amounts of litharge the quantities of thiosul¬ 
phate, thiocyanate and ferrocyanide decreased. 

Johnson (29) found that the use of lead salts not¬ 
ably rendered insoluble, harmful impurities as insoluble 
sulphides and the excess passing through extraction boxes, 
tended to maintain the efficiency of the couple. 

O’Connell (41) in cyaniding a sulphide ore, found 
that the addition of 0.5 lbs. of lead acetate per ton of 
ore with excessive aeration produced a good recovery. 

Haden (47) investigated lead salts with regard to 
their buffering action. He found the soluble salts the 
most active. Litharge had poor buffering qualities but 
had the advantage of being cheap. In cyaniding an arseno- 
pyrite and pyrrhotite gold ore in the presence of lead, 
a cyanide solution of pH 9.6 gave good extraction and low 
cyanide consumption, As the quantity of lead was increased, 
so did the relative proportion of the thiocyanate increase 
over the ferrocyanide in the final solution while total 
cyanide consumption was reduced. Still further addition of 
lead eventually increased the cyanide consumption. 

Caldecott (28) stated that lead salts precipitate 
soluble sulphides but the lead sulphide formed is still 
an absorbent of oxygen and cyanide, forming lead oxide and 
thiocyanate. 

Leaver et al.(46) found that the presence of soluble

lead compounds during cyanidation slowed up the rate of 
dissolution of gold in the ordinary oyanide solution. 

They contribute it to the removal of oxygen from the 
solution and the coating of the gold with insoluble lead 
compounds. They also showed that chemical oxidizers corr¬ 
ected the harmful effect of lead or by the use of such 
alkali as sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate and a PH 
not exceeding eleven,the lead compounds could be rendered 
harmless. 

Beck(45) also found that alkali soluble lead com¬ 
pounds were harmful and that hydrogen peroxide eliminated 
the effect of the lead salts. He explains the action by 
the formation of sodium aurate by oxidation in the presence 
of hydroxyl ions. This compound dissolves with the form¬ 
ation of sodium aurocyanide and hydrogen peroxide as in 
Bodlaender’s equation. In the presence of lead salts, the 
aurate is M fixed" as an insoluble lead aurate, which coats 
the gold and prevents further action by the cyanide. 

Yon Bernewitz (50) mentions various ores from dif¬ 
ferent parts of the world, in some of which the addition 
of lead salts was found to be useful and in others yielded 
no apparent results. 

B. PRECIPITATION 

1* Mechanism 

The function of the precipitating 


agent is solely to yield an electron to the aurous ion formed 




19 


by the dissociation of Au(CN)~. In all precipitation 
methods it is important that the solution be clear and 
free from suspended matter. 

Oxygen plays an important part in the precipitation 
of gold and silver from cyanide solutions. The removal of 
dissolved oxygen from the solutions prior to the intro¬ 
duction of the precipitant is essential if the re-dis- 
solution of the gold in the precipitation chamber is to 
be prevented. 

From the electromotive force series given by Reynolds 
(35) it can be seen that any one of the metals above gold 
in the series would theoretically precipitate it. This 
includes aluminum, zinc, iron, copper, and lead. However, 
operating conditions limit the application of these metals 
essentially to that of zinc and aluminum.

2. Methods of Precipitation 
A. Zinc 

Zinc is the most widely used pre¬ 
cipitant for gold. The precipitation of gold in the 
presence of free cyanide is shown by the following 
equation: (15) 

2KAu(CH) 4 Zn - K 2 Zn(CN) 4 4 2Au 

The phenom,ena of precipitation is essentially 
electrical and is due to the action established by two 
metals of different potentials forming a galvanic couple, 
with the cyanide solution serving as the electrolyte, 
currents produced electrochemically depositing the gold 
and silver from solution (15). 

Lead salts have been used to increase the activity 
of the zinc precipitation. Most authorities claim the 
function of the lead ion is to form a zinc-lead couple

which increases the rate of gold precipitation* 

The disadvantage of using zinc is that it unites 
with cyanide and increases consumption* 

B. jiluminum 

The reaction can be represented by the 
following equation:(17) 

6NaAu(CN) 4* 6NaOH + 2 a 1 - 6Au + 12NaCN -f 2Al(0H) 3 

2A1(0H) 3 f 2NaOH = NaAlOg + 4H g 0 
Absence of lime is also important as it decomposes the 
sodium aluminate to form insoluble calcium aluminate 
which, deposits in the press with the precipitate, making 
a large bulk of low grade product which is difficult to 
melt. 

C* Charcoal 

Charcoal has been used for precipitating 
gold from cyanide solutions by passing the solutions 
through barrels packed with it, which is afterwards 
burned and the ash melted down with fluxes. The method 
is limited to small tonnages of solution(32). 

D. Electrolitic Precipitation 

Although this method is simple, the high 
resistance of the dilute solutions require large anodes 
and cathodes and thereby increases cost of precipitation. 

C.* Cyanide Regeneration 

According to Hamilton(26) cyanide regeneration 
takes place from two causes: first, a precipitation of 
zinc by soluble sulphides as follows:

K 2 S + K 2 Zn(CN)^ - ZnS 4 i).KCH 
and second, a reaction of the free alk&li on the double 
cyanide with the formation of an alkaline zincate and free 
cyanide which is shown in the following equation: 

KgZnfCN)^ + 4K0H - KgZnOg 4 1+KCN - 2H 2 0 
This reaction is reversible so that the dissociated cyanide 
would tend to recombine with zinc if any change occurred in 
the solution to disturb the equilibrium* If lime is used 
instead of caustic soda^ there may be a formation of insoluble 
calcium zincate which renders the reaction non reversible* 

The Crosse Process (18) of cyanide regeneration is 
based on the principle of precipitating zinc as a sulphide: 

K 2 Zn(CN)^ 4* Na 2 S = ZnS+2KCNt2NaCN 
This method was not too successful due to the presence of 
sodium zincate which reacted with the sodium sulphide to 
form sodium hydroxide and Involved an additional zinc can- 
sumption in the precipitating chamber where it accumulated* 

The reaction can be represented by the following equation: 
Na^ZnOg + Na 2 S + ^0 - ZnS-/-4 NaOH 
Other methods of cyanide regeneration are based 
on the principle of precipitating the base metals in acid^s. 
The acidification is accomplished with the use of SO^or H 2 SOj^# 
The hydrogen cyanide is removed by vacuum distillation and the 
vapours passed through an alkaline solution* The acid treat¬ 
ment is usually applied to gold precipitate rather than a high 
silver precipitate because the latter has a tendency to 
dissolve in acids (37)*

11. SOLUBILITY 

A. Mechanism of Dissolution 

As far as is known no complex compounds of 
arsenic, antimony and cyanide are formed (7). Part of the 
sulfur content of arsenic and antimony ores are believed to 
be soluble in alkaline solutions which reacts with the free 
cyanide content to form inert thiocyanates or reacts with the 
dissolved oxygen to form sulfites or sulphates ( 55 ) ♦ Stibnite 
ores reduce cyanide much greater than arsenical ores. Strong

alkaline solutions will decompose the antimoniacal com¬ 
pounds to allow the precious metals to be better liberat¬ 
ed (39). 

The following equations are given for the decomp¬ 
osition of arsenical and antimoniacal compounds in alkaline 
solution: 

( After Jacobson (43) ) 

ASgSg f 6K0H = K 3 As0 3 4 K 3 AsS s + 3H 2 ° 

K 3 AsS 3 f 2K0H = KgS 4 K^iiS^O 4 H g 0

Sbg °3 4- H g 0 4 NaOH = Na g 0oAs g 0 3 . 2H g 0 

B. Solubility Factors * 

1* Hydroxyl Ion Concentration 

The hydroxyl ion concentration is the most 
important factor in the solution of arsenic and antimony 
minerals* An increase in hydroxyl concentration would 
hasten the solution of the minerals as seen from the fore¬ 
going equations* 

2* Oxygen Content 

The thioarsenites and thioantimonites 
formed in the solution of the arsenic and antimony com¬ 
pounds react with oxygen in the cyanide solution to form 
the corresponding arsenites and antimonites. The result 
is that praotically no oxygen is available for the dis¬ 
solution of gold (7).

3• Cyanide Strength and Temperature 

Variation of cyanide strength should have 
no influence on the solubility of arsenic and antimony 
compounds since no arsenic - antimony - cyanide compounds 
are known to exist (?)* 

Glucker and Mel drum ( 9 ) state, T! A rise of 10°C in 
temperature approximately doubles the rate of a chemical 
reaction". The increase in reaction rate is due to greater 
activity of the ions. The effect of temperature change on 
solution of a salt in an aqueous solution is determined 
whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic. If heat 
is absorbed, (endothermic) (LeChatelier f s Principle), an 
increase of temperature will speed up dissolution. Increase 
in temperature decreases the amount of oxygen in solution 
because the solubility of the gas decreases with the In¬ 
creased temperature ( 36 ). 

i|. Time of Contact 

Unless the dissolution of the arsenic and 
antimony minerals in an alkaline solution is instantaneous, 
it is obvious that the time of mineral solution contact is 
a factor in the extent of arsenic and antimony mineral dis¬ 
solution. 

5* Physical Condition of the Minerals 

The dissolution rate Is a function of the 
particle size (10). Coarse particles may not dissolve in

the time available for cyanidation. If the precious metals 
are mechanically combined with the arsenic and antimony 
minerals, finer grinding will give greater liberation. 

111 . PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTAL WORK 

Comparatively little experimental work has been 
done with arsenical and antimoniacal ores. Leaver and 
Woolf (14J carried out an investigation on cyanide ex¬ 
traction of gold in arsenic and antimony compounds. They 
prepared artificial compounds and from the cyanidation 
tests obtained the following results: 

1. Direct cyanide treatment recovered nearly 
all of the gold in artificial iron-arsenic sulphides. 

Many natural arsenical pyrites similarly give high dis¬ 
solution of gold by cyanide, indicating that the gold is 
present in a mechanical mixture and is exposed by fine 
grinding to the dissolving action of cyanide. However, 
there are instances in which the gold seems to be in solid 
solution with the pyrite and does not respond to direct 
cyanide recovery from the ray/ ore. 

2. The gold compounded with ferric arsenate 
gave 80$ extraction by direct cyanide treatment, 72$ after 
roasting at 450°G and only 35.3$ at 650°C. Lack of sulphur 
during the roast tends to prevent the formation of vola¬ 
tile arsenates and instead non volatile arsenates are 
formed which may lock up the gold against dissolution 

by cyanide. The addition of pyrite during roasting raises 
the recovery to 90$.

3* Calcium arsenate seems favorable for the 
dissolution of gold by direct cyanidation. 

4. In the direct cyanide treatment of antimony 
compounds, both iron and antimony sulphide and ferric 
antimonate caused low extraction of gold with a high 
cyanide consumption. 

5. Tests to determine whether poor extraction 
in direct cyanidation of certain arsenic and antimony 
ores could be attributed to the precipitation of gold, 
as carbon has been known to cause, gave no evidence to 
support this reaction. 

Haden (47) showed the importance of alkalinity 
control in cyaniding a gold ore associated with arseno- 
pyrite and pyjrrhotite. The optimum pH value for dis¬ 
solution was between 8 and 9. For a pH above 10, cyanide 
consumption increased, dissolution of gold decreased and 
the formation of thiocyanates increased*

EXPERIMENTAL WORK 


1. Laboratory Procedure 

A* Gold Leaf Test-Tube Investigations 

These tests were carried out by agitating various 
arsenic-antimony-sulphur-lead-cyanide solutions for periods 
of tim^4n twenty milliliter test-tubes fitted with corks. 

The gold leaf test method involved determining the time 
required for portions of cyanide solvent to dissolve a 
square of 23 K gold leaf when shaken at a constant rate of 
oscillations per second with a stroke of one and one half 
inches. 

B. Ore Charge Investigations 

These tests were carried out in two -quart sealers. 
These jars were charged with J 4 .OO grams of -150 mesh arseno- 
pyrite-stibnite ore from Cochenour Willans Gold Mine and 
1000 milliliters of alkaline cyanide solution. The sealers 
were agitated by tumbling end over end in a rack rotated at 
28 r.p*m. At the completion of the tests the solutions 
were separated from the ore by pressure filtering and stored 
in stoppered sealers for subsequent analysis. 

2. Solutions and Reagents 

Various strengths of cyanide solutions were used 
ranging from 0.1% to 1.6% NaCN. 

The arsenic sulphide and antimony sulphide stock 
solutions were prepared by dissolving various amounts of

these chemically prepared compounds in a sodium hydroxide 
solution* The arsenopyrite-stibnite ore stock solution 
was prepared by shaking -lf>0 mesh ore in contact with a 
sodium hydroxide solution. This method of preparing stock 
solutions of the ore left only the arsenic, antimony, and 
sulphur in solution. 

All other solutions were prepared by the ordinary 
chemical method of dilution. 

3® Details of Tests 

A. Cyanide Strength 

The cyanide strength was determined after agitation 
tests; by titrating 5 milliliters of cyanide solution with 
0.0867$ AgNO^ solution. One milliliter of silver nitrate 
was equivalent to 0.01$ NaCN* Potassium iodide was used 
as an indicator. 

The presence of soluble sulphides and arsenites caused 
some difficulty in the silver nitrate method of determining 
cyanide. Precipitation of these sulphides and arsenites 
were necessary and in the test-tube analysis method was 
accomplished by the addition of one gram of litharge to each 
10 milliliters of solution of which 5 milliliters was taken 
for cyanide determination. Preliminary tests showed that 
the litharge addition caused a slight cyanide consumption 
but since the same amount of litharge was added to each 
test, the relative values would remain the same. Lead 
acetate was also tried as a method of precipitating the

sulphides and arsenites but was found to affect the cyanide 
assay value to a much more serious extent. 

In the ore charge investigations, 140 grams of litharge 
was necessary to precipitate the soluble compounds in 50 
milliliters of solution. A blank run was taken into account 
in these tests. 

B. Alkalinity 

In the ore charge investigations, the protective 
alkalinity was determined by titrating 5 milliliters of 
filtrate with 0.0787$ oxalic acid using phenolphthalein as 
an indicator. One milliliter of oxalic acid was equivalent 
to 0.01$ NaOH. Inhere other alkali was used the alkalinity 
was reported in equivalent NaOH. 

C. pH 

The pH of the various solutions was determined 
by a Coleman Type 3D Electrometer. Corrections for sodium 
ions were applied where applicable as given by Dole (11). 

D. Arsenic and Antimony and Sulphur 

Eor the test-tube investigations, the arsenic, 
antimony, and sulphur concentrations were determined by 
carrying out chemical analyses on the alkaline stock sol¬ 
utions and by knowing the dilution ratio used, calculating 
the arsenic, antimony,and sulphur concentration in milli¬ 
grams per liter added for each test. 

Eor the ore charge investigations the chemical 
analyses for determining sulphur were carried out on the

filtered solution at the end of the tests. 

E. Gold 

Since the arsenopyrite-stibnite solutions were 
obtained by dissolution in an alkaline solution, they were 
free from precious metals. 

The test-tube experiments of determining times of 
dissolution of gold were carried out using squares of 23K 
gold leaf ( 0.16 sq. cms. Wt. 0.032 mg. ). This weight 
was determined by weighing a 8.6 cm. square of gold leaf 
( wt. 0.051 mg. ) and by measuring the size of the test 
sample used. 

The gold extraction in the ore charge investigations 
was determined by assaying of the cyanide solution only, 
(lead boat method) rather than by assay of heads and tails. 
This procedure was adopted to reduce possible variation 
in the heads and to reduce the number of determinations 
to a minimum to obtain the required data. 

The percent recovery in the ore charge investigations 
was calculated on the basis of a heads assay of 4.46 oz. 
per ton. 

F. Lead 

This was determined by the ordinary method of 
chemical dilution and was reported as mgms. of lead per 


liter of solution

Investigation No.2 . 

Effect of pH and various cyanide 
concentrations on dissolution time of gold leaf. 
(No arsenic, antimony, or sulphur present) 

(Table No.2. Figure 1* ) 


Results. 

The time required for gold dissolution in an 
arsenopyrite-stibnite-free cyanide solution passes 
through a minimum in passing from low to high pH with 
the minimum occuring at a pH of about 12. At low alk¬ 
alinity the dissociation of cyanide is low and the 
cyanicides are more apt to attack the cyanide. Gold 
is less soluble in highly alkaline solutions and 
therefore would require longer periods of time for 
dissolution in these solutions.

of Gold Leaf at Various Cyanide Concentrations, 
























45 


Investigation No. 3 . 

Effect of various cyanide concentrations 
and various concentrations of arsenopyrite-stibnite solution 
on time of dissolution of gold leaf, (Table No.3 Fig. 2) 

Results. 

Normally it would be expected that greater concen¬ 
trations of cyanide would not dissolve gold faster than the 
theoretical maximum concentration of 0.19$ NaCN (52). This 
results because of greater viscosity at greater concentration 
which thereby decreases the number of oxygen molecules reaching 
the gold-solution interface. The shaking mechanism used in the 
investigations was vigorous enough to overcome this factor and 
supply the necessary oxygen as required, the result being that 
higher concentrations of cyanide dissolved gold leaf more 
rapidly. 

Increase in arsenopyrite-stibnite concentration 
resulted in an increase in time required for dissolution of 
the gold leaf.

48 


Investigation No.4 . 

Effect of various concentrations of 
arsenopyrite-stibnite solution at various pH values on 
time of dissolution of gold leaf* ( Table No.4. Eig.3) 

Results 

The time required for dissolution of gold leaf 
passes through a minimum in passing from low to high pH, 
with the minimum time occuring at a pH of about 12.2* 

Low pH values give rise to low dissociation values of 
sodium cyanide (1). Highly alkaline solutions dissolve 
gold more slowly because of decreased solubility at high¬ 
er alkalinity (51). 

Increase in sulphur content at all pH values increas¬ 
ed the time required for dissolution of gold. 

Discussion 

The alkalinity at a pH of 10 may not be sufficient 
to protect the cyanide from combining with sulphur present 
therefore giving high values for time of dissolution. At 
very high alkalinity ( pH 12.7)(and over) the excess of 
sodium hydroxide would favor the decomposition of some of 
the primary products of solution of the arsenopyrite- 
stibnite ore, some of these secondary products being more 
detrimental to the dissolution of the gold leaf. This is 
shown in the following equations: ( after Jacobson (43)) 
SbgSg f 6NaOH - Na^AsOg * Na 3 AsS 3 + 3H g 0 
Na^iisSg + 2NaOH * Na g S + Na^AaSg f HgO

Investigation No,5, 

Effect of various concentrations of

Results 

Increase in cyanide strength reduced the time re¬ 
quired for dissolution of the gold leaf. Increase in 
sulphur content increased the time required for dis¬ 
solution. 

Discussion 

The increase in viscosity with increase in con¬ 
centration was overcome in agitation and the diffusion 
of oxygen molecules to the gold-solution interface was 
not retarded resulting in higher cyanide concentrations 
dissolving the gold more rapidly.

Investigation No« 6 

Effect of various concentrations of 
arsenopyrite-stibnite solution compared with arsenic penta- 
sulphide solution at constant cyanide strength on the dis¬ 
solution time of gold leaf. (Table No. 6 Figure f>) 

Results . 

There is a similarity in solution curves of arseno- 
pyrite solution and arsenic pentasulphide solution. The 
arsenopyrite-stibnite solution in all cases required more 
time for gold dissolution for the same calculated sulphur 
concentration. At the higher sulphur concentration there 
is a greater difference in dissolution time than at lower 
concentrations• 

Discussion . 

The difference in the two solution curves could be due 
to the formation of different compounds upon solution of the 
two minerals in an alkaline solution some of which are more 
active in preventing the dissolution of gold. The equations 
for the solution of these minerals are given by Jacobson (43) 
as follows: 

Sb 2 S^ f 6NaOH = Na^AsO^ 4 Na^AsS^ + 3H 2 0 
Na^AsS^ 4 2NaOH - Na 2 S f Na^AsS 2 4 H 2 0 
As 2 S^ 4 6 NaOIi - Na^AsO^S + Na^AsS^ 4 3^0 

It is not established whether or not any further 
decomposition takes place in the second equation.

Investigation No. 9 , 

Effect of various concentrations of 
sodium sulphide on dissolution time of gold leaf. 

j Table No.9 Figure 6.1 


Results. 


Very small amounts of sulphur added in the form 
of sodium sulphide ( Na S) caused a large increase in time 
required for dissolution of gold leaf. The dissolution 
time increased very rapidly for small amounts of sulphur 
but increased less rapidly at higher sulphur concentrations. 
The presence of one milligram of sulphur per liter in¬ 
creased the time of dissolution by a factor of over three 
while seventy milligrams of sulphur per liter increased 
the dissolution time of gold by a factor of only eight. 


Investigation No. 10 . 

Comparison of a sodium hydroxide and 
calcium hydroxide-cyanide solution on time of dissolution 
of gold leaf in the presence of various concentrations of 
antimony trisulphide. ( Table 10. Figure 7 ) 

Results . 

The same dissolution curve results when using 
sodium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide but the latter is 
retarded about ten to fifteen minutes for the same sulphur 
concentration. The results substantiate the v^ork of other 
investigators. ( 48) & ( 50) as to the inhibiting action 
of the calcium ion when introduced as CaO.

Investigation No. 11 

Comparison of antimony trisulphide, 
arsenic pentasulphide, sodium sulphide and arsenopyrite- 
stibnite solutions and their effect on dissolution time 
of gold leaf. (Table No. 11. Figure 8) 

Results. 

There is a similarity in dissolution curves in 
chemically prepared antimony trisulphide and arsenic 
pentasulphide. Sodium sulphide gives the greatest retardation 
of gold dissolution while arsenopyrite-stibnite ore solution 
gives the next largest retardation. The difference in retard¬ 
ation between the arsenopyrite-stibnite and the arsenic penta¬ 
sulphide solutions in dissolution curves is amplified when 
using the cyanide concentration of 0.1J? compared with a 
cyanide concentration of as shown in Investigation

Investigation No.12 . 

Effect of various concentrations of 
arsenopyrite-stibnite solution on cyanide consumption. 
(One hour test) ( Table No.12.) 


Results . 

The presence of arsenopyrite-stibnite solution did 
not increase the consumption of cyanide to any degree which 
could be detected in these tests. The series of tests 116- 
119 shows that at higher pH values, higher consumption also 
results. This is in accordance with the theory which favors 
higher oxidizing solutions at higher alkalinity and there¬ 
fore a greater tendency to deplete cyanide strength. 

The undetectable cyanide consumption with increase in 
arsenopyrite-stibnite concentration indicates that it is 
not the cyanide depletion which causes the increase in dis¬ 
solution of gold leaf. 

Investigation No.13 . 

Effect of various concentrations of 
arsenic pentasulphide on consumption of cyanide. (Table 13) 

Results 

Arsenic pentasulphide solution caused no detectable 
increase in cyanide depletion with increase in pentasulphide 
concentration. A constant consumption, within experimental 
error, resulted in each £ase after one hour of agitation.

Investigation No. 16. 

Effect of lead borate on dissolution 
time of gold leaf in cyanide solutions containing compar¬ 
atively low concentrations of arsenopyrite-stibnite solution. 

( Table No. 16. Figures 9 & 10 ) 


Results . 

Lead added as lead borate to a cyanide solution 
containing no arsenopyrite-stibnite solution increases the 
time of dissolution of gold leaf. The dissolution time in 
cyanide solutions containing small concentrations of arseno¬ 
pyrite-stibnite solution decreases with small increases in 
lead concentration, passes through a minimum and then inc¬ 
reases with further increase in lead concentration. The 
minimum dissolution time for gold leaf is believed to occur 
at the maximum precipitation point of the sulphides. After 
this point is reached, the solution acts more or less as an 
arsenopyrite-stibnite free solution. If there is insufficient 
lead present for complete precipitation of the sulphur com¬ 
plexes, the sulphur concentration is the factor that retards 
gold dissolution. If more lead is present than required for 
precipitation, the lead ion is the factor that retards the 
dissolution of gold.

Lead Borate to Cyanide Solutions Containing Various i Gone. 

of Arsenopyrite-Stibnite Solution.

Investigation No. 17 . 

Effect of various concentrations of 
lead acetate on time of dissolution of gold leaf in cyanide 
solutions containing comparatively high concentrations of 
arsenopyrite-stibnite ore solution* ( Table No. 17. Fig. 11) 

Results 

Increase in lead concentration added as lead 
acetate to a cyanide solution free from arsenopyrite-stibnite 
solution increases the dissolution time of gold leaf. The 
dissolution time of gold leaf in solutions containing com¬ 
paratively high concentrations of arsenopyrite-stibnite 
solution is reduced greatly by small increases in lead con¬ 
centrations. Further increase in lead concentration after 
complete precipitation does not appreciably increase the 
dissolution time. The increase in lead concentration to 
over eight times that required for maximum precipitation 
did not increase the time to any great extent over the 
minimum. 

Increase in arsenopyrite-stibnite solution con¬ 
centration produced a comparatively small increase in the 
minimum dissolution time, that is, the time required for 
dissolution of gold leaf where maximum precipitation of 
sulphides takes place. The reason for this increase is 
not known.

Results. 

The lead salts can be roughly divided into two 
groups, those which are soluble to some extent and those 
which are practically insoluble. The soluble group includes: 
lead oxide (PbO). lead borate, lead carbonate,, lead sulphide, 
lead iodide, lead chloride, lead chromate, lead acetate, and 
lead nitrate. In the practically insoluble class are: Lead 
oxide (PbOg) lead silicate, galena, lead arsenate, lead 
oxalate and lead sulphate. 

In cyanide solutions containing no arsenopyrite-stib- 
nit^4olution. the partially soluble lead salts caused a 
retardation in the dissolution of the gold leaf while the 
practically insoluble group had very little effect. In the 
partially soluble group lead oxide ( PbO) gave the largest 
while lead acetate(Pb(CgH 3 0g)g and lead nitrate (Pb(N0 3 )g gave

the least retardation of gold leaf dissolution* The 
reason for this is not understood* 

In cyanide solutions containing arsenopyrite- 
stibnite solution all the salts tried with the exception of 
lead silicate produced approximately the same effect. Each 
salt reduced the time required for gold dissolution to about 
the same extent for the same lead concentration. Lead silicate 
only slightly reduced the dissolution time of gold leaf. 

This showed that even the presence of a few lead ions is 
beneficial to the dissolution of gold in an arsenopyrite- 
stibnite solution* 


Investigation No* 19 * 

Effect of l/l 6 n ) lead sheet in cyanide 
solutions containing various concentrations of arsenopyrite- 
stibnite ore solution on the dissolution time of gold leaf. 

(Table No. 19 . Figure ll| ) 


Results * 

Lead sheet in a cyanide solution containing no arseno- 
pyrite-stibnite solution had no effect on the dissolution of 
the gold. When arsenopyrite-stibnite solution was present, 
sufficient lead went into solution to decrease the time of 
dissolution to about the same extent as all the lead salts 
with the exception of lead silicate* This again indicates that 
only a few lead ions are necessary to aid in reducing the 
dissolution time when arsenopyrite-stibnite is present*

INVESTIGiiTION NO. 20. 

Arsenopyrite-stibnite ore charge 
investigation to determine cyanide consumption, hydroxide 
consumption and gold recovery when certain lead salts are 
added. ( Table No. 20. ) 

Results . 

Lead added as lead sheet, lead oxide ( Litharge) 
and lead acetate had no definite beneficial effect on 
gold recovery when added to the ore charges. The gold and 
silver recovery from the cyanidation of the roasted material 
was 2.5 io while all other additions of lead to unroasted 
material gave recovery values about one half of this value. 
Any differences in gold recovery are within range of exper¬ 
imental error and therefore Cannot be considered to indi¬ 
cate any particular trend. 

The solubility of the arsenopyrite-stibnite ore 
was decreased in the lime solution but this again did not 
affect the recovery to any extent. Considerable alkaline 
consumption was encountered in all cases except when 
cyaniding the roasted material.

COMPARISON OF INVESTIGaTIONaL METHODS USED 

The dissolution of gold leaf in cyanide solutions is 
not comparable to dissolution of gold associated with ore 
in cyanide solutions. It seems to differ in that maximum 
rate of dissolution of gold leaf is accomplished at higher 
cyanide strengths ( probably 2$ as compared with 0.1$$ NaCN). 
(Investigation No.2, Table 2, Figure 1.) The reason for 
this is that the agitation mechanism for supplying the 
oxygen is such that oxygen is supplied as required for the 
chemical reaction between oxygen and cyanide to go to com¬ 
pletion.

In the test tube investigations solutions only were used 
which allows the oxygen and other reagents to migrate with 
relative ease compared with the ore charge investigations 
where a pulp density of about 40% solids was in effect. The 
ore particles offer considerable resistance to the migration 
of ions in solution thereby not utilizing the full effect 
of the concentration of reagents. Also in the gold leaf 
investigations, the gold solution interface is greater than 
in dissolving say, 400 mesh gold particles. This difference 
of surface area in contact with cyanide solution effects a 
difference in the dissolution rate, the larger surfaces 
dissolving more fapidlyjper unit weight of gold. ( Invest¬ 
igation No.2, Table 2, and Investigation No.20, Table 20) 

A square of gold leaf 0.36 square centimeters, weight 0.073 
milligrams, used in a test of dissolution time in a 0.1% 

NaGN solution, pH 12.7, dissolved in 6 minutes. This is 
equivalent to a rate of 2 milligrams of gold per square 
centimeter of surface exposed per hour. (Calculations in 
Appendix). In the ore charge investigation, the average 
gold particle was assumed to be 400 mesh (Tyler) (0.0366 
millimeters) and the particle was considered to be roughly 
a sphere with a sphericity factor of 0.7. The ore assayed 
4.46 ounces of gold per ton and a recovery of 2.5% was 
effected with the roasted material after cyaniding for 365 
minutes. The calculated rate of dissolution is 0.14 milli¬ 
grams per square centimeter of surface exposed per hour. 

This shows that the gold leaf dissolved over 14 times as 
fast as the ore particles of gold. ( Assuming all gold

A. I. Effect of Alkalinity ( Test Tube Investigations ) 
a. Gold Dissolution 

The rate of gold dissolution is slower in a 
Ga(OH)g solution than in a NaOH solution* (Investigation 
No*10, Table 10, Figure ?•) The presence of 6 pounds of 
CaO per ton of solution (pH 12*6) in a cyanide solution 
without any arsenopyrite-stibnite, caused the gold leaf 
dissolution to be retarded some 9 minutes over the time 
required in a 0*1$ NaCN solution containing 9 pounds of 
NaOH per ton of solution. The presence of arsenopyrite- 
stibnite solution to the extent of 25 milligrams of sul¬ 
phur per liter in a CaO cyanide solution caused a retard¬ 
ation of 14 minutes over the caustic alkali cyanide 
solution* The complete mechanism is not understood but 
it has been found by previous investigators that the 
presence of both the calcium and hydroxide ions are 
necessary to effect the retardation of gold dissolution* 
The gold dissolution time in cyanide solutions, with 
or without the presence of arsenic and antimony - sulphur 
compounds, passes through a minimum in passing from low 
to high pH* with minimum occurring at a pH of about 12. 

( Investigation No. 2, Table 2, Figure 1.) In a 0.1$ 
cyanide solution at pH 10.5, free of arsenopyrite-stibnite 
solution, the gold leaf dissolved in 3-J* minutes while in 
a cyanide solution at pH 12, it required minutes. In a

similar cyanide solution at pH 12.7, the gold leaf required 
minutes for dissolution. At higher cyanide strengths, 
the difference in dissolution time of gold leaf in the 
various alkaline solutions are reduced. In a 1.0# NaCN 
solution of pH 10.5, the gold leaf required 2 minutes for 
dissolution, in a solution of pH 12, it required 1 minute 
and in a solution of pH 12.7, it required 1-J- minutes. 

The presence of arsenopyrite-stibnite solution did 
not change the general trend of dissolution rate. (Invest¬ 
igation No.4, Table 4, Figure 3). However, the dissolution 
time differences are somewhat greater at low alkalinity. 

A 0.08# NaCN solution containing arsenopyrite-stibnite 
solution at a pH of 10.5 and sulphur concentration of 4 
milligrams per liter, retarded the gold leaf dissolution 
over 280 minutes. In a similar solution at pH 11.7, it 
required only 70 minutes while in a solution at pH 12.2 
it required 45 minutes. The gold leaf dissolved in 55 
minutes when the pH was at 12.7. The higher alkaline 
solutions dissolve gold at a slower rate because of de¬ 
creased gold solubility in these solutions. The lower 
alkaline solutions dissolve gold more slowly because of 
low dissociation of the cyanide at these pH values. The 
results show that maintaining a pH of about 12, in pref¬ 
erence to higher or lower values, reduces the dissolution 
time of gold leaf.

b. ixrsenopyrite-Stibnite Dissolution 

The inhibiting action of the calcium ion is 
extended to the dissolution of arsenic and antimony-sul¬ 
phur compounds, ( Investigation No.l, Table 1. and Invest¬ 
igation No,20, Table 20. ) In Investigation No.l, Table 
1, one liter of Ca(0H) g solution of pH 12.0 containing one 
pound of GaO per ton of solution, dissolved 2.9 times as 
much arsenic and antimony as one liter of distilled water 
of pH 5.1, while a caustic alkali solution containing three 
pounds of NaOH per ton of solution, dissolved 14 times as 
much arsenic and antimony as the distilled water solution. 
Time of agitation of these tests was four hours. An arseno- 
pyrite-stibnite ore charge in a caustic alkali cyanide 
solution in Investigation No. 20, Table 20, maintained at 
a pH of 12.7 contained 5.0 grams of sulphur per liter of 
solution at the end of six hours of agitation. A Ca(0H) 2 
cyanide solution maintained at the same pH and for the 
same agitation period contained only 1.4 grams of sulphur 
pef liter. The effect of the decreased dissolution of the 
arsenic and antimony-sulphur minerals is beneficial to the 
cyanide process, the advantage being that there is less 
alkaline sulphides formed and therefore less possible 
formation of inactive thiocyanates caused by the combin¬ 
ation of these sulphides with the cyanide.

c. Cyanide Consumption 

Higher alkalinity causes a higher cyanide 
consumption. (Investigation No.12, Table 12.) An increase 
in pH from 10.2 to 12.7 increases the cyanide consumption 
four fold in one hour of agitation. This increased consump¬ 
tion is in accordance with the theory which favors higher 
oxidizing solutions at this higher alkalinity anjt therefore 
a greater tendency to form cyanates, thereby depleting 
cyanide strength and effective dissolving power. 

11. Comparison of Various Arsenic. Antimony, and Sulphur 

Compounds. 

a. Cold Dissolution 

Arsenic and sulphur in the form of chemically 
prepared arsenic pentasulphide^gives similar trends as the 
arsenopyrite-stibnite solution with respect to the effect 
of cyanide strength, but the dissolution times in all cases 
were lower. (Investigation No.6, Table 6.) At a sulphur 
concentration of 15 milligrams per liter in a 0.4 fo NaCN 
solution at pH 12.7, arsenopyrite-stibnite solution 
effected gold dissolution in 38 minutes while it dissolved 
in 28 minutes when in arsenic pentasulphide solution. 

At a concentration of 30 milligrams per liter, the arseno¬ 
pyrite-stibnite effected dissolution of gold leaf in 47 
minutes compared with 32 minutes in the pentasulphide 
solution. The difference in the two solution curves could

be due to the formation of different compounds upon 

solution of the two minerals in an alkaline solution. 

The compounds formed in the dissolution of stibnite, 

(SbgSg) are: Na^AsO^, Na^AsS^, Na g S, and Na^AsSg. In 

the dissolution of arsenic pentasulphide,(As S ) the 

2 5 

following compounds are formed: Na^AsS^ and NagAsOgS. 

Some of these compounds may be more aotive than others 

in preventing the dissolution of gold. The equations 

for the dissolution of stibnite (Sb S„) and arsenic 

2 « 

pentasulphide (As 0 S r ) are given by Jacobson (43) as 
follows: 

SbgSg + 6Na0H - Na^AsOg 4 Na^AsS^ 4 3HgO 
Na^AsS^ 4 2NaOH - NagS 4 Na^AsS^ f HgO 

As g Sg 4 6Na0H - Na^AsS^ 4 Na^AsO^S 4 3HgO 
It is not known if the primary compounds formed in the 
pentasulphide dissolution decompose further in alkaline 
solutions. 

Chemically prepared arsenic trioxide and antimony 
trichloride have no effect on gold dissolution. ( Invest¬ 
igation No. 7, Table 7 and Investigation No. 8 , Table 8 .) 
This indicated that it is not the presence of arsenic 
and antimony which retards the gold dissolution. 

One milligram of sulphur added in the form of 
sodium sulphide caused an increase in dissolution time of 
gold leaf of &§■ minutes in a 0.9$ NaCN solution. Itwds 
realized that in a weaker cyanide solution, the gold 
leaf would be retarded to an even greater extent. This 
is shown in Investigation No.11, Table 11, Figure 8 .

solution retarded the gold dissolution some 34 minutes. 

The results of this investigation indicate that the 
detrimental effect on dissolution of gold leaf in a 
solution containing arsenic and antimony sulphides could 
he due to the presence of sulphide ions which adsorb on 
the gold surface. 

A comparison of 0.1# cyanide solutions containing 
sodium sulphide, arsenopyrite-stibnite, antimony tri¬ 
sulphide, and arsenic pentasulphide is shown in Invest¬ 
igation No.11, Table 11, Figure 8. In solutions of these 
compounds containing 20 milligrams of sulphur per liter, 
the gold leaf was retarded 40 minutes when arsenic penta¬ 
sulphide was present, 43 minutes when antimony trisulphide 
was present, 83 minutes in the presence of arsenopyrite- 
stibnite and 125 minutes when in the presence of sodium 
sulphide. These results indicate that the effect of the 
various sulphur compounds must depend upon the form that 
the sulphui? is in when in an alkaline solution, that is, 
Na^S, NagAsOgjNa^AsS^, NagAsSg, Na^AsS^ and Na^AsO^S. 

b. Cyanide Consumption 

Consumption tests carried out show that 
arsenic and antimony-sulphur compounds do not consume 
cyanide to the extent where a considerable cyanide 
depletion is effected which would cause a retardation 
in the gold leaf dissolution time. ( Investigation No.s 
12, 13, 14, 15, and 20).

111 .. Effect of Lead Salts 

Lead salts can be roughly divided into two types: 
those which are soluble to some extent and those which are 
practically insoluble. In the class which are soluble to 
some extent in alkaline solutions are: lead oxide(litharge), 
lead borate, lead carbonate, lead acetate, lead sulphide, 
lead iodide, lead chloride, lead chromate and lead nitrate. 
In the practically insoluble class are: lead oxide (PbO ), 
lead silicate, lead oxide (Pb^O^), lead sulphide (Galena), 
lead arsenate, lead oxalate, and lead sulphate, 
a. Soluble Group of Lead Salts . 

In cyanide solutions free of arsenopyrite- 
stibnite solution , this group caused a retardation of 
gold leaf dissolution. Lead oxide(Litharge), gave the 
largest retardation while lead acetate gave the least. 
(Investigation 18, Table 18, Figures 12 & 13.) Lead 
oxide (Litharge)was added in a concentration of 285 
milligrams per liter which retarded the dissolution of 
gold leaf 16 minutes. Lead acetate in a concentration of 
314 milligrams per liter,retarded the gold only 9 minutes. 
Lead borate was added to a 0.1# NaGN solution at pH 12.7. 

In the absence of arsenopyrite-stibnite solution, 0.42 
milligrams of lead per liter retarded the dissolution of 
gold leaf 4^ minutes. In the presence of arsenopyrite- 
stibnite solution at a concentration of 1.04 milligrams 
of sulphur per liter, gold leaf required 15 minutes for

dissolution, no lead being added* The addition of 0.42 
milligrams of lead per liter, reduced this time to 6£ 
minutes. Further lead additions did not cause any further 
reduction in time. In the arsenopyrite-stibnite solutions, 
the addition of lead as lead borate reduced the time of 
dissolution until what appeared to be the complete pre¬ 
cipitation point of the sulphides. After this point was 
reached, a further increase in lead concentration increased 
the dissolution time. ( Investigation No.16, Table 16, 
Figures 9 and 10 }. Addition of lead acetate to cyanide 
solutions containing much higher concentrations of arseno¬ 
pyri te-stibnite, ( up to 174 milligrams of sulphur per 
liter) gave somewhat similar trends as the lead borate 
in the lower sulphur concentrations. However, after com¬ 
plete precipitation of the sulphides seemed to have taken 
place, a further addition of lead acetate did not effect 
an increase in dissolution time of gold leaf. The reason 
why some lead salts increase the retardation effect after 
the precipitation of the sulphides and some do not, is 
unknown at this time. The effect of lead acetate in a 
cyanide solution free of arsenopyrite-stibnite solution, 
caused a retardation of gold leaf of some 6 minutes 
with a lead concentration of 140 milligrams per liter. 

The effect of a number of lead salts of varying solubility 
in an alkaline solution, on the time of dissolution of 
gold leaf, is shown in Investigation No.18, Table 18, 
Figures 12 & 13./

b. Insoluble Group of Lead Salts 

The practically insoluble group of lead 
salts have practically no effect on the dissolution of 
gold leaf in a sulphur-free cyanide solution. Lead 
oxalate, which comes under this grouping, gave the great¬ 
est retardation of gold of one minute with a lead concen¬ 
tration of 340 milligrams per liter. 

In cyanide solutions containing arsenopyrite- 
stibnite solution, all the lead salts used ( soluble and 
insoluble) with the exception of lead silicate, reduced 
the time of dissolution of gold leaf to about the same 
extent for the same concentration of lead added. The 
addition of' 40 milligrams of lead per liter of all the 
lead salts, with the exception of lead silicate, reduced 
the gold dissolution time from 125 minutes to between 15 
and 30 minutes. Lead silicate reduced the dissolution time 
to only 100 minutes for this same lead concentration. 

Lead added as lead sheet, although not increasing 
the time in a sulphur-free solution, decreased the time 
of dissolution when sulphur was present. ( Investigation 
No. 19, Table 19, Figure 14. ) 0.32 square inches of 1/16 

inch lead sheet in 15 milliliters of cyanide solvent de¬ 
creased the dissolution time of gold leaf from 125 minutes 
to 20 minutes. These results show that even the presence 
of a few lead ions is beneficial to the dissolution of 
gold leaf when arsenopyrite-stibnite solution is present.

It is also shown that if the lead is added in excess of 
that required for complete precipitation of the sulphide 
complexes, that in some cases, using soluble salts, the 
time of dissolution of gold leaf is retarded. This 
suggests that lead ions may adsorb on the gold surface 
and retard the dissolution. This mechanism was suggested 
by Chalmers and Lauer (1) in their investigations of lead 
salts in the cyanidation of cuperiferous gold ores. In 
the presence of sulphides, it is possible that the sulphide 
ion ions adsorb on the gold surface and retard the dissol¬ 
ution. Lead therefore appears to have a dual effect in 
respect to gold dissolution: first, that of decreasing 
the sulphide-complex content of the solution and there¬ 
fore reducing the number of sulphide ions that can adsorb 
on the gold surface, and second, that of adsorbing on the 
surface itself and retarding the dissolution of gold leaf. 
The lead film effect is far less detrimental than that of 
the sulphide film. The maximum extraction should occur with 
a correct balance of both mechanisms. 

B. Ore Ghar&e Investigations. ( Investigation 20, Table 20) 
Lead added as lead sheet, lead oxide (litharge), and 
lead acetate, had no effect to any extent on gold recovery. 
Litharge added in quantities up to 50 pounds per ton effect- 
ed a percent recovery difference of only 0.01$ which is 
within range of experimental error and therefore cannot be 
considered as significant.

These results at first may seem discouraging but 
it may be argued that they may be contributed to an 
unfortunate choice of an ore. The ore appears to be 
very refractory, as is shown by the fact that a recovery 
of only 2.5 % resulted after six hours of cyanidation 
of the roasted material.

- SUMMARY CONCLUSIONS - 

The dissolution of gold leaf in cyanide solutions is 
not comparable to dissolution of gold associated with ore 
in cyanide solutions. It seems to differ in that maximum 
rate of dissolution of gold leaf is accomplished at higher 
cyanide strengths, also the agitation mechanism is such 
that more oxygen is made available to allow chemical react¬ 
ion between gold and cyanide to go to completion. In the 
test tube investigations, only solutions were used, comp¬ 
ared with a pulp density of about 40$ solids in the ore 
charge investigations. The migration of reagents through¬ 
out the heavier solution is retarded and full utilization 
of the concentration of the reagents is not made. In the 
gold leaf investigations the gold-solution interface is 
much greater than in the finer gold particles of an ore. 
This difference causes a difference in dissolution rate, 
the larger surfaces dissolving more rapidly ; per unit 
weight of gold. 

The rate of gold dissolution is slower in a 0a(0H) g 
solution than in a NaOH solution. The mechanism is not 
completely understood but it has been found previously 
that both the calcium and hydroxide ion are necessary 
to effect the retardation in dissolution rate* 

The inhibiting action of the calcium is also extend¬ 
ed to the dissolution of arsenic and antimony-sulphur 
compounds. The inhibiting action effected here is benefic¬ 
ial in cyanidation because it retards formation of alkaline

sulphides which combine with cyanide and decrease cyanide 
strength. 

The gold dissolution, with or without the presence 
of arsenic and antimony-sulphur minerals, passes through 
a minimum in passing from low to high pH. The higher 
alkaline solutions dissolve gold to a slower degree be¬ 
cause of decreased gold solubility in these solutions. 

The low alkaline solutions dissolve gold at a slower 
rate because of low dissociation of the cyanide at these 
low alkaline values. 

Higher alkalinity causes a higher cyanide consump¬ 
tion. The higher alkalinity produces a higher oxidizing 
solution which causes an increase in cyanate formation 
by the oxidation of the cyanide. 

Chemically prepared arsenic pentasulphide in an 
alkaline solution gives similar trends as arsenopyrite- 
stibnite solution on the dissolution of gold leaf but 
with a less serious intensity. The difference could be 
due to the formation of different compounds upon solution 
of these minerals in alkaline solution. Some of the 
compounds formed may be more active than others in pre¬ 
venting gold dissolution. 

Arsenic trioxide and antimony trichloride ( chemical¬ 
ly prepared) have no effect on gold dissolution thereby 
indicating that the retardation effect of arsenic and 
antimony-sulphur compounds on gold leaf dissolution is

not due to the presence of arsenic and antimony directly. 

Small quantities of sulphide effect a large increase 
in time of dissolution of gold leaf. This suggests that 
the retardation of gold dissolution in arsenic and ant¬ 
imony-sulphur compounds is probably due to the sulphide 
ion adsorbing on the gold surface. 

Arsenic and antimony-sulphur compounds do not con¬ 
sume cyanide in the test tube investigations or in the 
ore charge investigations to a serious enough degree 
which would effect a noticeable retardation of gold dis¬ 
solution. 

Lead salts can be roughly divided into two classes: 
those which are soluble to some extent and those which 
are practically insoluble* The soluble group effects a 
retardation of gold leaf dissolution in cyanide solutions 
free of sulphur while the practically insoluble group 
does not effect gold dissolution to any extent in these 
solutions. In cyanide solutions containing sulphides, 
nearly all lead salts retard gold dissolution to about 
the same extent until what appears to be the complete pre¬ 
cipitation point of the sulphur compounds. After this has 
been reached, further increase in lead concentration often 
increases the retardation of gold dissolution. Lead acetate 
was one lead salt used that did not increase retardation 
with increase in lead concentration beyond the apparent

complete precipitation point* The reason for this effect 
is not known* Lead silicate, being a very insoluble salt, 
effected very little decrease in gold dissolution time 
of gold leaf in cyanide solutions containing sulphides. 

Lead added as lead sheets decreased the retardation effect 
of the sulphide solution to about the same extent as the 
lead salts. This indicates that even the presence of a 
few lead ions in a sulphur-compound solution is beneficial 
to dissolution of gold leaf* Lead therefore appears to 
have a dual effect with respect to gold dissolution, first, 
that of decreasing the sulphide content of the solution 
and therefore reducing the number of sulphide ions that 
can adsorb on the gold surface, and second, that of adsorb¬ 
ing on the gold surface itself and retarding gold leaf dis¬ 
solution* The lead film effect is far less detrimental 
than the sulphide film. The maximum gold extraction should 
occur with a correct balance of both mechanisms. 

-RECOMMEHD ATIQN - 

Much further work needs to be done on cyanidation 
of ore charges with lead salts to determine whether or 
not trends indicated in the gold leaf investigations 
have their counterpart in the cyanidation of arsenical 
and antimoniacal gold ores by practical cyanide methods*

Gold Leaf 

Area of gold leaf.. 36 square millimeters 

Weight of square . 0.073 milligrams 

Time of dissolution. 6 minutes 

Rate of dissolution . 0.073 mg/36 sq.mm/ 6 minutes. 

This is equivalent to .. 2 milligrams per square centimeter 

of exposed surface per hour 

Gold Ore Particle 

Gold ore particle assumed an approximate sphere with a 
sphericity factor of 0.07. 

Average partiole size assumed 400 mesh ( 0.0366 mm.) 

Time of dissolution. 365 minutes.

Thi£ is equivalent to 0.14 mgms / sq.cm, of exposed- 

surf ace per hour. 

This shows that the gold leaf dissolves 14.3 times as fast 

as the gold ore particles, assuming that all particles are 

free.
