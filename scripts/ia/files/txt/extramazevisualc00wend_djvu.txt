•The part placed "by vision in the hehavionr of rodents in maze 
sitiiations has "been a popular subject of investigation. Studies 
have been conducted mainly, hox'/ever, with reference to intra^maze 
visual cues. For example, Vincent (1915) ran rats in a maze in 
which the true pathways were painted black and the blinds white 
and found that the facilitation in learning v/as insignificant. 

The general impression has been that rats use vision very little 
in maze learning and that after a maze has been learned the 
animals run through it on the basis of kinaesthetic cues chiefly 
and are practically oblivious to visual stimulation. However it 
has been reported by Hebb (1938) in a more recent publication that 
visuaJ room cues determine an orientation v/hich in turn gives 
differential value to the visually perceived parts of the testing 
apparatus. It would seem therefore that extra-maze visual cues 
can be an important factor in maze learning. 

The problem of the relative importance of the various sensory 
cues available to the rat in maze learning has been thoroughly 
investigated. Various investigators have attempted to shov/ that 
some specific sensory information is the most important as an aid 
to the rat in learning to successfully negotiate a maze. The 
general techniques for investigating the role of sensory processes 
in maze performance can be classified in five main groups as follows: 
(l) Extirpation of sensory structures. It is possible to interrupt 
partic-alar avenues of stimulation ty removing the peripheral sense

organs, "by transecting the afferent paths of the cervical cord or 
hy extirpating the sensory projection areas of the cerehrnni.. 
Experimenters have investigated two types of problems by means of 
the extirpation technique. By operating on the animal prior to 
maze training, they have determined the role of sensory processes 
in the learning process. By opera,ting after mastery of the maze, 
they have determined the role of sensory processes in retention 
and in final control of the habit. 

( 2 ) Elimination of stimuli. Some investigators, instead of removing 
sensory structures, have removed the sensory stimuli dii’ectly. 

One may compare the performance of animals trained in darkness with 
that of those trained in ordinary iiramination. Or one may deter¬ 
mine the effect of darkness upon retention of a habit learned in the 
light. Similarly one may remove customary auditory or olfactory 
stimulation. This method has the advantage that it does not 
interfere with neural integration at the same time that it removes 
the sensory stimulation. 

( 5 ) Introduction of stimuli. Investigators have placed specific 
sensory cues in the true pathways of the maze and have compared the 
performance of snimals trained with such cues with the performance of 
animals in the absence of such cues. A significant difference in 
favour of the group trained ?/ith the specific sensory cues, providing 
the groups were comparable in other respects, indicate^the use of 
such sensory cues in maze learning, Eemoval of the cu.es after the 
pro Diem ha,d been mastered would indicate to what 


extent they con-

tributed to final control of the hahit, 

( 4 ) Eearrangement of stimuli. "The role of sensory processes in 
mase performance may he determined hy rotating the maze daring or 
after training, Eotation of the maze changes the relation 'betv/een 
the environraent within the maze and the environment outside of it. 

( 5 ) ‘The temporal maze technique. With this method one determines 
whether the animal is sJble to learn a pattern of response, for 
example rrll, without sensory cues of a differential nature. 

Sensory cues are rendered ineffective ‘because^mcist make a repetitive 
response in the same environment. 

'The results obtained in studies of exteroceptive control 

indicate that the learning of the maze path?/ay is obviously 

dependent upon exteroceptive stimulation. There is no evidence 

\are 

at present which indicates the character of the processes which 
inevitably present during learning and final performance of the 
maze habit. 

Lashley (1929) made use of four mazes of differing complexity 
in order to test the influence of the extent of brain injury and 
retention. In the experimental animals there was aii average extent 
of injury of approximately thirty-one per cent of the cortex, 
differing in locus in different animals. An analysis of the data 
in terms of the locus of cerebral injury shov/ed, in general, that 
the amount of deterioration of maze habits depended, not on the locus 
of injury, but upon the amount of tissue destroyed. The hypothesis 
v/hich Lashley advances to explain his experimental results is ths^t

the projection areas of the cortex have, in addition to their 
specific sensory or motor ftinctions, a non specific (perhaps 
facilimitative) function in which they are equipotential. 

An attempt has been made in this stiidy to implement a 
technique which may prove useful in the investigation of sensory 
control of the maze hahit. The method is "based on the hypothesis 
that the rat will make use of the most obvious cues most readily 
as an aid to learning a problem. For exaxflple if visual cues are the 
most obvious of those available to the rat the assumption is that 
the rat*s behaviour will be mainly determined by them. The comparison 
of the disturbances in performances resulting from the variation of 
the cues emphasized in a particular sample should provide a valid 
basis for determining the relative importance of the sensory process 
in maze learning. 

It v/as decided that a control group of animals in which the 
cortical visual areas had been extirpated would perhaps provide an 
adequate check on the performance of normal animals. Secause of the 
evidence in support of an equipotential function of cerebral cortical 
tissue a further control group of rats ?/ith lesions ( comparable 
in size to those of the visually operated animals ) involving an 
area of the cortex considered not to have a specific sensory function.

APPAPvATUS Mii MTSEIALS 

A maze (see photograph) was designed which v/ould he adaptable to 
limited facilities and yet v/hich'*/ould present a difficult learning 
problem. The standard T maze would be most suitable for the invest¬ 
igation to be made but such a maze would be too large for the space 
a vailable. An adaptation of a maze designed by Walton (page 586, 
Ma,ier and Schneirla) was therefore built. The maze has twelve T 
choice points and a corresponding nmber of blinds. The alleys are 
four inches wide and each unit is fifteen inches in length. The 
interior of the maze x¥as painted with a flat black paint so that 
the various units of the maze present a uniform appearance. The 
entire maze was covered with wire netting. The arrangement of the 
blinds was made on the basis of a random selection which resulted 
in the following order of choices - rrlrllrlrllr. 

The maze used has the following features which contribute to 
its reliability‘and objectivity. (Munn-page 217)(1.) The cul-de-sacs 
are of eq.ual length. (2.) The animal is presented with two similar 
paths at the choice points. (5.) The maze path;¥ay is of sufficient 
complexity to be difficult for the animal to solve. (4.) boors 
to prevent retracing. (5.) The performance of the animal is 
objectively scored. 

An intense extra - maze visual cue was provided by placing an 
unshaded 200 watt bulb and a 450 watt daylight lamp in the positions 

indicated on the accompanying diagrama. Light was alao provided hy

Additional apparatus included a straight runway and a Lashley 
type jumping stand. The straight runv/ay’s construction duplicated 
that of the maze. The main features included were two retracing 
doors, manually operated as in the maze, and a food "box, (See fig.l.) 
The runway v/as used as a means of preliminary training which would 
serve to familiarize the rats with some elements of the maze 
situation in order to expedite the initial training in the maze. 

Thus the animals were accustomed to the retracing doors, feeding 
in a food "box and the presence of the experimenter when first 
introduced into the maze.

SURGICAL PBOCEDUES AliD 

In order to provide control groups animals were operated and 
tissue of the cerehral cortex extirpated Ly thermo-camtery. Of 
the animals operated eleven completed all training tests. Of this 
nxttnber seven Were animals vdth frontal lesions and four had lesions 
in the visual cortex. 

Operations were perfomed with asseptic precaution under deep 
ether anaesthesia. 

‘The areas to he extirpated were located hy reference to sutures 

in the cranium. The sJrull was trephined on both sides of the 

0 

mid-line and the their^cautery inserted and swept in an arc ensuring 
an adequate coverage of the area to he extirpated. The size of the 
lesions was kept as nearly constant as possible. 

Histological examination of the brains using the technique 
ieveloped by Lashley was considered but rejected when it v/as found 
bhat there was insufficient time to complete it.

formed by vertical and horizontal lines.

BESULTS 

ITine normal rats, six rats vdth frontal lesions, and fowc rats 
v/itli lesions in the cortical Visual area completed all training and 
test runs. Five animals v/ith occipital lesions and three with frontal 
lesions died during the training. One animal with a frontal lesion 
Had not learned the maze after 435 trials and one with a visual 
area lesion had not learned after 590 trials. 

The mean number of trials for the normal animals to achieve 
the criterion of learning ?/as 1E6 trials; for the frontall^^ operated 
animals 247 trials and for the visually operated ^20 trials. 

The performance of the three groups on the three test situations

conclusion. 

In this study the disturhance of the relationship between the 
internal environment of the maze and the external environment 
was found to cause a disturbance in performance but when the maze 
was rotated and only the dominant visual cues were maintained in 
the same relationship no disturbance was elicited. 

The animals which had lesions in the visual cortex were not 
affected by changes in the extra-maze visual environment. Eats 
with portions of the frontal area of the cerebral cortex extirpated 
exhibited a much greater disturbance in behaviour than normal 
animals when extra-maze visual cues v/ere altered. 

The tests of the rats on the j~amping stand v/ere not concluded 
because of a lack of time but there was an indication that the 
visually operated animals were unable to make a pattern discrimination 
in which the normal rats and those with lesions of the frontal area 
of the cortex were successful.

DISCUSSION 

On the he-sis of the data obtained in this stMy there seems to 
be an indication that eztra-maze visual cues affect the maintenance 
of the maze habit and are probably operative in maze learning. 

The normal animals and those v/ith lesions involving frontal 
cortex were disturbed in performance, on a basis of error scores, 
when the extra-maze visual cue was altered. The fact that those 
rats with occipital lesions were not affected by the disturbance 
of the extra-maze cue provided indicates that these animals had 
Learned the maze by some means in which the extra-maze visua.1 cues 
were not a determining factor. All animals were brought back to 
the criterion of learning between tests under the original conditions. 
Since all animals in which disturbance in behaviour had been 
elicited during the test situations made a rapid readjustment 
during re-training it is suggested that the extra-maze visual cue was 
a determining factor in the formation of the maze habit. 

The results on the tests involving rotation of the maze 
indicate that disturbance of performance is due to an alteration 
of the relationship between the internal environment of the maze 
and extra-maze environment rather than the directional reorientation 
in itself. Careful studies involving rotation of a maze ha,ve been 
made by Cengerelli and Higginson. G-engerelli (1988) used a 
conventional maze with six blind alleys which was surrounded by a 
screen three feet high attached to the maze. An effort v/as made 
to eliminate all extra-maze stimulation. After the animals had

mastered the maze they v;ere required to r-uja it tv/ice with a 90 
degree rotation and twice with a 180 degree rotation on successive 
days and disturbance in behaviour was elicited. 

Higginson (1930) found that in preliminary tests made under 
ordinary laboratory conditions where heterogeneous stimulation 
could influence the animals, rotation led to marked disturbances 
but when animals were trained in complete darkness rotation in 
darkness elicited no disturbance. He found further that animals 
trained in a covered, internally illuminated maze were not 
disturbed by rotation tests after the maze had been learned. 
Higginson states that he could find no experimental evidence which 
would substantiate the claim that the rat possesses a sense of 
direction by virtue of which it is disturbed when the maze, 
previously learned at one position, is rotated to nev; cardinal 
positions. 

The third test in the study being here considered involved 
reorienting the maze directionally in an environment in v/hich 
heterogeneous stimulation could influence the behaviour of'the 
aiisitsd: animals* Since no disturbance in behaviour was elicited 
in the third test situation it was suggested that a constant 
relationship betY/een interior environment of the maze and 
exterior environment was maintained by keeping the provided 
intense source of visual stimulation in a constant position 
relative to the maze. Thus it would seem that a specific sensory 
cue can be a predominantjfacor in retention of the maze habit.

The close correspondence of resiilts in test situations 1 and 

2, in v/hich the relationship of the extra-maze visTial stimulation 

to the maze was constant although the maze was rotated directionally 
in the second test, indicates that rotation in itself does not 
disturb the performance of rats in a maze previously learned. 

The neural mechanisms involved in learning are yet to be 
understood* Two facts which are applicable to the problem must be 
considered* First, there are sisbaxats numerous sub-systems in the 
totsJ nervous system each of v/hich are capable of elaborate 
integration* Secondly, any sensory pathv/ay, however simple and 
restricted, leads ultimately to every effector* In the solution 
of more complex learning problems a greater portion of the nervous 
system will contribute to the production of activity. With a 
greater part of the nervous system involved there is a greater 
possibility of flexibility in the participation of the various 
afferent paths. Thus the animal deprived of some sensory inform- 

3, tion is still able to learn. However if the integration involved 
in learning a problem is influenced by a particular intense sensory 
cue there should be a reduction in the possibility of flexibility 
in the use of the various sensory processes. Animals that have 
lost the use of part of the nervous system as a result of 
extirpation would probably be at a greater disadvantage than 
normal animals if adaptations to an environment v/ere necessary for 
bhe maintenance of a learned habit* 

In the resiilts tabulated above the animals which had lesions

involving a frontal area of the cortex were disturbed, tv;ice as 
much, on the basis of mean error scores, as normal animals in a 
situation which required an adaptation to a changed environment 
detemined by the rearrangement of an intense extra-maze visual 
cue. It is suggested that this result may be due to a comparative 
inability on the part of the frontally operated animals to adjust 
to an altered environment in v/hich the use of exteroceptive 
stimulation other than the changed source v/ould be necessary for 
retention of the maze habit. The apparent lack of flexibility in 
the use of va,rious sensory information of animals with frontal 
lesions could be due to a deduction in the functional quantity 
the nervous system available. The possibility of some special integ¬ 
rative function of some portion of the frontal cortex may other¬ 
wise be suggested on the basis of the results obtained. 

It is suggested that a more adequate study of the problem 
investigated should include the following features: 

(1) The use of a larger number of animals in order to ensure 
a more relia-ble sample, 

( 2 ) Post-mortem histological examination and mapping of the 
0 size and locus of lesions of operated animals. 

( 3 ) The use of a self-recording, automatic maze, 

( 4 ) variation of the order in which the test situations ai^e 
presented in order to control the possible effect of 
over-learning on the second and third tests.

A technique v/as developed in v/hich rats were trained in a maze 
with an intense extra-maze visual cue provided. 'Testssituations 
involved varying the position of the extra-maze cue relative to the 
maze and rotsition of the maze. 

Eesults indicate that in normal rats and animals v/ith frontal 
lesions an extra-maze visual cue is a factor in determining maze 
learning and retention, of the maze-hahit. Eats v/ith lesions 
involving the visual area of the cortex were not disturbed by 
variations in the extra-maze visual cue. 

Some evidence was advanced to support the claim that rotation 
of the maze without disturbing the relationship of the interior 
environment of the maze to the exterior visual environment does not 
affect the maze performance of the rat. 

The possibility of a special integrative function of the 
frontal area of the cortex was suggested. 

Some suggestions vveve made to indicate how the study might be 
further pursued.
