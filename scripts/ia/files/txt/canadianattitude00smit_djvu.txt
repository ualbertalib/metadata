Introduction

Public opinion is a mysterious and vital force® 
It is a thing of uncertain stability* which fluctuates 
with the trend of events and changes with the passage 
of time. Yet upon it depends to a great extent the 
legislation enacted by our representative bodies, and 
it plays a large part in shaping both domestic and 
foreign policies. It is by now a commonplace feature 
of our democratic system that a government must, if it 
wishes to maintain its position in power, take into 
consideration the wishes of the people. But how can 
the will of the people be accurately ascertained? 
Undoubtedly much more can be done in this direction 
than in past centuries, when facilities for such enter¬ 
prises were lacking and public opinion was not con¬ 
sidered a matter of great importance. In this modern 
age, with its wide franchise, frequent elections, 
efficient communications, and special devices and 
guides such as polls of public opinion, newspapers, and 

raoio, it is comparatively easy to ascertain the state 
of the public mind.

But does the problem end here? If investiga¬ 
tion revealed a unanimity of opinion matters would be 
greatly simplified, but unfortunatelv this is not 
usually the case. It is indeed a rare and happy 
condition in a democratic country when public opinion 
on some issue of major significance is uniform and 
united. Par more often than not are to be found a 
great variety of conflicting viewpoints which prevent 
a unanimous stand, and which stem from religious, 
racial, political, sectional, economic and other dif¬ 
ferences. Although It is a cardinal principle of 
democracy that the will of the majority shall prevail, 
history has demonstrated that it can be fatal, and 
usually is at least unjust, to treat with too much 
Indifference the wishes of minority groups. The task 
of the politician is immeasurably complicated by having 
a variety of viewpoints to deal with, and the same is 
true of anyone who attempts to carry on research in a 
field which deals with public opinion. 

In the following pages an attempt has been made 
to investigate the Canadian attitude to events of inter¬ 
national significance between 1867 and 1914 by means of 
an examination of the Debates of the House of Commons

during those years* It is readily apparent that in 
many cases one cannot discover a "Canadian” attitude to 
a given situation or event, for the very good reason 
that no essentially Canadian attitude existed, owing 
to the fundamental differences of opinion characteris¬ 
tically held by individuals and groups* This is par¬ 
ticularly true of a nation such as Canada, which 
unfortunately is rife with sectional differences of 
opinion and racial and religious antagonisms. It is 
also especially true of an organization such as the 
House of Commons, which is essentially and necessarily 
divided into opposing groupSj among which violent and 
fundamental differences of opinion are Inevitable. 

More than that. It is frequently questionable whether 
a member*s speeches reveal with any great accuracy 
either his own real opinions or those of the constitu¬ 
ents he represents, because such considerations are 
often put aside in the interests of party unity and 
discipline, so necessary to carry through the party 
program. Finally, Hansard gives at best a very incom¬ 
plete picture of Canadian public opinion. Not only 
are the members a very small group of Canadian citizens, 
but also a great body of very significant discussion

takes place outside the doors of the Commons’ chamber. 
To get a complete picture one would have to have access 
to a great variety of other sources — to documents 
dealing with diplomatic negotiat.ions, to official and 
private correspondence, to the proceedings of cabinet 
meetings and party caucuses, to the speeches of 
election campaigns (a poor guide if we choose to be 
cynical), and also to a wide variety of newspaper and 
magazine articles and other published material. 

In view of the deficiencies of Hansard, this 
work cannot aspire to describe with complete accuracy 
and thoroughness Canada’s attitude to international 
affairs between 1867 and 1914. It attempts to give as 
complete a picture as possible with the material avail¬ 
able, and also to note the deficiencies of Hansard as a 
guide to public opinion. 

The general plan has been to arrange the 
chapters to follow as closely as is possible and con¬ 
venient the various parliaments of the years between 
1867 and 1914. Each chapter contains a brief intro¬ 
ductory survey of Canadian affairs during the period 
under discussion, followed by another brief survey of

international affairs during the same period* Next is 
given a longer treatment of Canada’s international 
relationships, again during the same period, and the 
views of the members on current international problems* 
In the early chapters these last two sections were 
separated, but in the last three chapters it has been 
found advisable to place them together, because of the 
growing connection between the two and the increasing 
attention that was being paid to international affairs 
by the members in their speeches in the House of 
Commons,

CHAPTER I 

THE FIRST MACDONALD ADMINISTRATION (1867-1873) 


A. The Achievement of Confederation 
in Canada 1867-1873 

In the year 1867 the Dominion of Canada was born. 
The efforts of the far-sighted group of men now commonly 
known as the Fathers of Confederation culminated in 
London on July 1, when by the so-called British North 
America Act the new Dominion was brought into being. It 
was of rather insignificant size then, containing only 
the Maritime provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick; 
and the Central provinces of Ontario and Quebec, formed 
from the older colony of Canada, and corresponding roughly 
to what had formerly been Upper and Lower Canada. Both 
Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island had for the moment 
decided to remain aloof, in spite of attempts to induce 
them to join. The federation in 1867 thus consisted of 
only four small, scattered, and disunited provinces, and 
the fears of its founders that the union could not survive 
are easily understandable. The population of the new 
Dominion was no more impressive than its size amounting to 







2 


only a little more than three millions of people, and 
lacking racial, religious, and political homogeneity* 

Confederation was the culmination of a series of 
historical events and processes which had been developing 
for years, and was inevitable if independence from the 
United States was to be maintained. It was achieved with 
great difficulty however, chiefly because of the many 
great obstacles that stood in the path and the many forces 
which actively resisted the union. 

Perhaps the outstanding difficulty was the indif¬ 
ference or actual hostility towards the idea of union 
shown by the majority of the Canadian people. When Con¬ 
federation was finally achieved, it was not the result of 
united action by the nation as a whole, but was rather 
the work of a vigorous minority. There was the ever 
present desire of certain sections of the populace to end 
the British connection and join the United States, a 
desire which in view of the support it was receiving from 
sources south of the border constituted a dangerous threat 
to union. An influential group in the United States, 
backed by such powerful interests as the New York Herald, 
was campaigning actively for the annexation of the British 
North American colonies, and the association with the group 
of such personalities as Secretary Seward lent at least a

semi-official atmosphere to their campaign. Another dif¬ 
ficulty was the understandable fear of the French Canadians 
in Lower Canada that a union of the colonies would cause 
them to be swamped by an overwhelming majority of English 
speaking people. The inhabitants of the Maritimes also 
felt a similar reluctance to join their fortunes with the 
much more populous territory of Canada, especially as the 
two areas were separated by many miles of little but trees 
and mountains. Other factors such as the lack of community 
of interest among the different colonies, and serious dif¬ 
ficulties in arranging the terms of the proposed union, 
only added to the problem. To cap it all, the Imperial 
Government in Great Britain had abandoned its centuries-old 
policies of mercantilism and colonialism, and had embarked 
on new theories of "laissez-faire" and free trade which 
made colonies appear both less necessary and more burden¬ 
some. Under these circumstances Imperial interest in 
colonies had waned, especially during the 1850*3 and *60*s, 
and the absence of positive action from that quarter, if 
not actually causing delay in union, had at least permitted 
matters to drift. 

However there were a number of other forces which 
impelled the colonies towards Confederation, and these in 
the end prevailed. Probably the outstanding one was a

steadily growing fear of the United States. Before the 
outbreak of the Civil War relations between the colonies 
and the United States had been fairly cordial, and during 
the early part of the war there was a distinct feeling of 
sympathy for the Northern States, the champions of slave 
emancipation. Within a few months this sympathetic feel¬ 
ing had changed to one of suspicion and fear, which was a 
natural outcome of the strained relations which were 
developing between the United States and Great Britain on 
the one hand and the United States and Canada on the other. 
English commercial and manufacturing interests, and also 
the aristocratic and governing classes, supported the 
Confederacy, and recognized it as a legal government. 
Resentment of the North soon manifested itself in a 
variety of ways offensive to the British colonies, includ¬ 
ing a press campaign for the annexation of British North 
America. The Trent and Alabama affairs served further to 
embitter relations between Great Britain and the United 
States, while the Canadian-American border was kept in a 
continual state of tension by raids of Confederate refugees 
from the Canadian side into American territory, and of 
Dands of Irish-Americans known as Fenians from the American 
side to the Canadian. A deterioration of commercial rela¬ 
tionships was caused by the American denunciation in 1866

of the Elgin Reciprocity Treaty of 1854, The end of the 
Civil War in 1865 left the United States a single unit, 
with probably the largest army in the world, which was 
still eager for action, and British North America seemed 
to be the natural outlet for its aggressive tendencies* 

It was felt by British subjects in North America that in 
the event of an outbreak between them and the United 
States, or between Britain and the United States, their 
land would inevitably become the battleground, and eon- 
sequently they began to take cognizance of their own 
position, and to realize that by joining together they 
would be able to present a more united front to their 
potential enemy. 

Certain economic aspects also made the idea of 
union appear attractive. Railway interests gave their 
support, as they were planning a railway to link Canada 
with the Maritimes, and the proposed railway and union 
appeared to be in many ways dependent on each other. Also 
a union would facilitate a lowering or complete removal of 
inter-colonial tariff barriers, a necessary step towards 
lower prices and increased trade between the various 
units. 

Another factor which led to union was the political 
deadlock in the province of Canada, which for some time had

made efficient government impossible, and which showed no 
signs of abating* English speaking people saw that a 
union with the other colonies would enable them to out¬ 
number the French, while the latter, for their part, were 
becoming so afraid of being absorbed into the United 
States and completely overwhelmed, that they were becoming 
increasingly resigned to a union with only the other 
British North American colonies as the better of two poor 
alternatives. The agreement that the union should be 
federal, with a central government and separate provincial 
governments, rather than unitary, also helped to allay the 
doubts and fears of French Canadians. 

The Imperial Government also changed its view 
suddenly, in view of events in the United States, and the 
Duke of Newcastle, the Colonial Secretary, who had been 
cool to Galt T s proposals for union in 1860, received 
Howe 1 s resolutions with cordiality in 1862. From that 
time on opinion in Britain veered steadily around in 
favour of union. The definite and concrete proposals of 
the Quebec Conference in 1864 found a ready response in 
London, and from that time on the cause of union had 
steady support in the Mother Country. 

Finally, perhaps the decisive factor in the achieve¬ 
ment of Confederation was the personal contribution of a

few great Canadian statesmen, among whom must be mentioned 
prominently the names of Macdonald, Cartier, Galt, Tupper, 
and McGee, and without whose courageous and far-sighted 
leadership the union could not have been accomplished. 

The occasion of Canada’s birth as a nation was 
marked by no great demonstration of enthusiasm in the new 
Dominion. Indeed opposition to the idea remained strong 
in each of the provinces, particularly in the Maritimes, 
where in the first federal election Tupper alone of nine¬ 
teen members in Nova Scotia was returned as a supporter 
of confederation. It seemed that Canadians had as yet 
acquired neither the mentality nor a sufficiently broad 
outlook to appreciate the possibilities of their new 
status. As Lower has said, "Some people are born nations, 
some achieve nationhood, and others have nationhood thrust 
upon them. Canadians seem to be among these latter." ^ 

The complex of fear, the leadership of Macdonald 
and a few others, and the refusal of the British govern¬ 
ment to entertain any idea of dissolution of confederation, 
were largely responsible for the preservation of the union 
during the next few precarious years. A measure of

consolidation took place, and at the same time a notable 
expansion of area, both of which materially aided the 
cause of union. The huge area belonging to the Hudson’s 
Bay Company was acquired in 1869, and from it a fifth 
province, Manitoba, was carved in 1870 under the terms of 
the Manitoba Act, a Canadian measure later confirmed by 
the British parliament. Unfortunately the process was 
marked by a rebellion on the part of the Metis, or half- 
breed settlers, which more tactful action by government 
officials and surveyors would probably have avoided, and 
although the uprising petered out upon the arrival of 
troops under Colonel Wolseley, it left a regrettable 
legacy of ill-feeling. In 1871 the Pacific coast province 
of British Columbia was received into the union, mainly 
on condition that a transcontinental railway would be 
started within two years and completed within ten. The 
next step was the admission of Prince Edward Island, 
which had encountered insurmountable financial difficulties 
in 1873, and the Canadian government now had jurisdiction 
over all lands in North America north of the American 
border with the exception of Alaska and Labrador, 

In spite of powerful opposition from anti-confed¬ 
eration interests, and despite its weak handling of the 
Riel Rebellion, Macdonald’s government had survived, and

had even succeeded in absorbing certain Liberal elements, 
and also in effecting a reconciliation with Joseph Howe. 
In the elections of 1872 Macdonald’s coalition was 
returned to office, and proceeded with plans for the 
construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. However 
in the following year revelations of what were regarded 
as corrupt electioneering practices in accepting campaign 
funds from Sir Hugh Allan, the president of the company 
which was to build the railway, shocked the country 
severely, and the so-called "Pacific Scandal" drove 
Macdonald from office in November 1873. 


B. The International Scene, 1867-1875 
In 1867 there were perhaps six nations in Europe 
which could be classed as powers, of which only three. 
Great Britain, Russia, and Prance, had important commit¬ 
ments outside Europe. The remaining three were Austria- 
Hungary, Germany, and Italy, all of which were still 
undergoing a process of unification and formation. 
Prussia under the leadership of Bismarck was rapidly 
strengthening itself and also uniting under its control 
the neighboring German states. The defeat of Denmark in 
1864 had added the provinces of Schleswig and Holstein,

and the surprising victory over Austria in 1866 had not 
only excluded that country from Germany, but had definitely 
established Prussia as the most potent single force in 
Central Europe. After 1866 German unification proceeded 
very rapidly, with the formation of the North German 
Confederation, and was completed by 1871, when the 
German Empire was established, with Prussia at its head. 

In Austria the onje-proud House of Hapsburg had 
fallen upon evil fortunes, and the loss of the Italian 
states, coupled with the defeat at Sadowa, reduced its 
former large possessions greatly and confined it to the 
Danubian area. The Emperor Francis Joseph was forced to 
admit that the future held no hope for his heterogeneous 
dominions unless equal status was granted to Hungary, and 
so in 1867 the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary was 
created, which preserved a troubled and precarious 
existence until 1918. 

The events in Germany were paralleled by a similar 
unification of Italy, which after centuries of divided 
rule and foreign domination was at last being welded into 
a single state. The defeat of Austria in 1860, with the 
help of Napoleon III, made possible in the same year the 
union of a number of states including The Two Sicilies, 
the Papal States (except Rome), Tuscany, Lucca, Modena,

and Parma with the Kingdom of Sardinia under King Victor 
Emmanuel, and Italy*s life as a nation was begun. In 
1866 she made use of her alliance with Prussia to acquire 
Venetia from the Austrians, and in 1870-1871, during 
Prance ! s humiliation, she marched into Rome, making her¬ 
self complete in a geographical sense. It is evident 
that without foreign assistance this might never have 
been accomplished, but the names of Victor Emmanuel, 
Mazzini, Cavour, and Garibaldi will always be prominently 
associated with the cause of Italian unity. 

Russia, always the enigma of Europe, was under¬ 
going fundamental internal changes, of which the most 
notable was the emancipation of the serfs in 1861, a 
great measure which unfortunately neither accomplished 
all that it set out to do nor took permanent effect. 
Already huge in area and extending from central Europe 
to the Pacific Ocean, Russia had not yet satisfied her 
expansive tendencies and longed for an outlet to the 
Mediterranean. The decisive defeat inflicted on her by 
Great Britain and Prance in the Crimean War (1854-1856) 
had forced her to transfer her attention elsewhere, and 
so at this time her energies were being mainly directed 
towards the East. 

In Prance it was the period of Napoleon III and

the Second Empire. Under Napoleon Prance had participated 
in several victorious wars* helping Britain defeat Russia 
in 1854-1856 and assisting the Italians against Austria 
in 1860. The expedition to put Maximilian on the Mexican 
Throne ended in disaster, however, and was a serious 
blow to French prestige. Her alarm at the defeat of 
Austria in 1866 was justified amply by later events. 

Prance was the possessor of a considerable number of 
colonies, notably in North Africa and South Eastern 
Asia, and had already come into close and unfriendly 
contact with Great Britain in her most recent colonizing 
activities. 

Great Britain’s interests at this time were 
primarily domestic. She was especially devoted to the 
development of her industry and commerce, fields in which 
she still enjoyed undisputed world leadership, and hoped 
mainly to preserve peace in order that these might prosper. 
With her as yet unchallenged domination of the seas, by 
her all-powerful navy, she was able to control events 
abroad, and no European pov^er could exert itself outside 
Europe without her passive consent. The opening of the 
Suez Canal in 1869 accentuated the importance to Britain 
of her Indian and other Eastern colonies, and quickened 
ber interest in Near and Middle Eastern affairs. Britain

regarded herself as being well-removed, from the entangle¬ 
ments and disturbances of continental Europe, and pursued 
her old policy of attempting to keep European powers 
divided into two opposing groups of equal strength, so 
that by applying her own power strategically she could 
sway events in whichever direction she might please. 

Outside Europe there were two independent nations 
of growing strength, as yet largely unconcerned with the 
rest of the world, but being gradually drawn into the 
current of international affairs. The United States of 
America had just emerged from its Civil War, a tragic 
affair which nevertheless established that the nation- 
should continue as one unit rather than two, in which 
the institution of slavery was to pass out of existence. 
It was primarily interested in the settlement of its 
western regions and the development of its industries, 
activities that proceeded unhampered behind the protec¬ 
tion afforded by the Monroe Doctrine and the British 
navy. In the Far East the Empire of Japan had been 
aroused from her centuries of intellectual slumber by 
Commodore Perry*s forced entry in 1854, and had been 
compelled to admit western traders and at the same time 
western civilization. Great Britain, long established 
in the Far East, particularly since the acquisition of

Singapore by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819, followed 
America 1 s example a few months later, and it was not 
long before other European nations did likewise* Japan 
made a remarkably speedy adjustment to the new develop¬ 
ments, and from this time on ceased to oppose the entry 
of European ideas* Henceforth the modernization of her 
industries and institutions was both voluntary and 
extremely rapid. 

The outstanding event of international signific¬ 
ance during the years from 1867 to 1873 was the Franco- 
Prussian War of 1870-1871, in which the over-confident 
Emperor and army of France were disastrously defeated, 
and France herself given a setback which in the light of 
later events appears to have had permanent effect* The 
fall of France was due to a number of factors, over- 
confidence, under-estimation of the enemy, and the 
superior organization and leadership of the Prussians, 
to mention a few. Moltke and other military figures 
directed the campaigns, but the power behind the scenes, 
and the real architect of victory, was the grim figure 
of Otto von Bismarck. 

Bismarck had become President of the Ministry 
in 1862, and from that time until his fall from power in

1890 he dominated German policy and was the outstanding 
figure in Europe. His policy was crafty and many-sided, 
and his methods were tortuous -- a combination of brutality 
trickery, and arrogance — but there were several cardinal 
principles or tenets of policy from which he never wavered. 
After 1871 he aimed to preserve peace in Europe and par¬ 
ticularly for Germany, so as to be able to concentrate on 
developing her internally, being content to let other 
nations pursue the colonization of distant lands. Also 
he desired to preserve good relations with both Great 
Eritain and Russia, but never to allow them to become 
allies, to preserve Austria as a major power but never 
to allow her to clash with Russia in the Balkans, and 
above all, to isolate France. 

Consequently he welcomed the formation in France 
of a republican form of government after her defeat in 
1871, — a government which would make her a pariah among 
monarchical powers, and endeavored by various underhanded 
and subtle methods to keep the French government weak and 
to prevent the nation from making progress. He was not 
so well pleased with the rapid recovery made by France 
after 1871 -- a recovery so rapid that her large war 
indemnity was speedily paid, and the occasion for the 
retention of German troops in France ended. It was

obvious that Prance would lose no opportunity in the 
future to regain her lost provinces of Alsace and 
Lorraine, and that this area must be regarded, along 
with the Balkans and the Dardanelles, as the chief 
danger spot in Europe, 

Nevertheless Bismarck could hardly complain of 
the trend of events immediately following 1871. The 
meeting in Berlin of the rulers of Austria, Russia, and 
Germany in 1872 resulted in the formation of the League 
of the Three Emperors, or Dreikaiser Bund, in the follow¬ 
ing year, and seemed to assure that Germany would have 
no lack of allies, and that Prance would be kept in 
isolation. The unification of Germany, practically com¬ 
pleted in 1871, was followed by a period of industrial 
and commercial development so rapid as to astound the 
whole world, and with the possible exception of the 
similar progress in Japan without a parallel in world 
history. Bismarck was worried, however, when Thiers 
fell from power in Prance in May 1873. Thiers had 
republican tendencies, and his fall seemed to pave the 
way for the return of Prance to a monarchical form of 
government, which would make her more eligible as an 
ally for other European powers*

C* Canadian External Relationships 1867-1873 
Canadian Status in 1867 

The British North America Act outlined the con¬ 
stitution under which the Dominion of Canada was to be 
governed, and in sections 91 and 92 enumerated the powers 
of federal and provincial governments. Generally speak¬ 
ing matters of minor and local concern were to be left 
to the provinces, while larger affairs of national 
importance were to be looked after by the federal govern¬ 
ment. Also it was specified that the Dominion government 
should retain the field of residuary powers, that is, 
control over matters not specifically assigned to one 
authority or the other, and that it should have the 
right to disallow provincial legislation. These pro¬ 
visions gave the Dominion government a large measure of 
control over its internal affairs. The self-governing 
powers of Canada were, however, greatly restricted by 
the retention of certain powers by the British Govern¬ 
ment, which reserved to itself the right to disallow 
Dominion measures, the control of foreign affairs, the 
supreme judicial authority embodied in the Privy Council, 
and the sole authority to amend the Canadian constitution. 
Certain other minor rights were retained at the same time, 
such as control of immigration, the governor’s pardoning 









18 


power, the command of Canadian defenses by British 
officers, and the right to station British troops on 
Canadian soil* Most of these powers have since passed 
under Canadian control, but at the time they placed 
serious limitations on Canadian sovereignty. This was 
particularly true in the field of foreign affairs, as 
oanada had neither sizable armed forces nor diplomatic 
representation in foreign capitals, and relied upon 
Great Britain both to defend her and to look after her 
relationships with foreign nations. However great 
developments have since taken place in Canadian sover¬ 
eignty, which are probably not yet completed, although 
notable progress had been made even by 1914. 

The Washington Treaty 

The first Canadian government after Confederation 
took part in diplomatic discussions which were designed 
to settle problems arising out of the recent Civil War. 
Outstanding among these from Canada's viewpoint was the 
question of the fisheries, which was partially settled 
by the Washington Treaty of 1871. Since it was the first 
international discussion at which Canada had representa¬ 
tion, and since it was also one of the most important 
which has concerned her, the circumstances leading up to 
and surrounding the treaty will be briefly surveyed.

The Treaty of Paris in 1783 gave Americans the 
right to fish in colonial waters, but the British con¬ 
sidered that the War of 1812 ended this arrangement, A 
convention in 1818 gave American citizens fishing rights 
in parts of the coastal waters of Newfoundland, Labrador, 
and the Magdalen Islands, on condition that they did not 
invade the three mile limit elsewhere, except in cases 
of emergency. By the Reciprocity Treaty of 1854 both 
Canadian and American fishermen were given greatly 
extended privileges in coastal waters, but when that 
treaty was abandoned by the United States in 1866 the 
convention of 1818 once again came into operation. 
Between then and 1870 several arrangements were tried, 
all of which proved unsatisfactory, and so in the latter 
year the Dominion Government urged the British author¬ 
ities to attempt a settlement. 

After 1869 there did seem to be a better chance 
that a treaty could be arranged. In that year Hamilton 
Pish replaced Sumner as American Secretary of State, 
and his attitude towards the British Empire was more 
open to reason. An unofficial visit of Sir John Rose 
to Washington resulted in a possible basis for agreement 
being reached, the active support of the British govern¬ 
ment was secured, and a conference arranged for February 


1871

The outlook of each of the three countries towards 
the question was extremely individualistic, one might 
even say self-centred. Great Britain, worried lest she 
become involved in Europe and North America at the same 
time, wanted to achieve a satisfactory settlement with 
the United States, and was willing to make concessions 
in order to get it. Canada T s prime desire was for a 
reciprocal trade treaty. She had little objection to 
granting the Americans greater freedom in the use of her 
fisheries, but felt that she was entitled to adequate 
compensation. The United States on the other hand felt 
little need for a treaty and could afford to be trucu¬ 
lent. Her policy was essentially to demand as much and 
concede as little as possible. Besides, the desire for 
annexation still burned strong, and Americans hoped that 
if Canada were denied the benefits resulting from recipro¬ 
city she would be compelled sooner or later to join the 
Union for economic reasons. Undoubtedly the American 
position was the strongest, though hardly the most just. 

The British government had decided that Canada 
should be represented at the conference, and after it 
became apparent that neither Sir John Rose nor the 
Governor General, Lord Lisgar, would be acceptable to

the Ganadian people, the offer was made to Sir John A, 
Macdonald. He and his colleagues felt grave doubts as 
to the advisability of attending, since if he could 
agree with neither the British nor the American delega¬ 
tions, which appeared only too likely, he might be 
publicly charged with the blame in case the conference 
should break up in disagreement. On the other hand, if 
a treaty should be achieved, it would probably be one 
which he would have little voice in framing, yet his 
countrymen might hold him responsible for any deficien¬ 
cies. His position was both delicate and difficult, 
yet he felt that he should go, because he could hardly 
justify to the Canadian people a refusal to participate 
in discussions where such vital Canadian interests were 
at stake. 

The Americans were at a loss to understand the 
legal position of the British delegation, particularly 
with reference to the Canadian representative. Canada 
had no power to negotiate a treaty, and so the presence 
of a Canadian on the commission seemed to them to be 
superfluous. Great Britain however announced, to their 
surprise, that any fishing treaty would have to be ratified 
by the Canadian Parliament. As Glazebrook says, f, It was 
the beginning of the long story of foreign uncertainty

on the constitution of the empire”^ At the same time it 
marked a new stage in Canada’s progress towards complete 
self-government• 

At the conference, which began on February 27, 
1871, Macdonald’s worst fears were realized, and he 
found himself in constant conflict with both the American 
and the British representatives. The British continually 
urged him to make concessions to the Americans which he 

grant 

felt that he could not*and should not be asked to make, 
while the demands of the Americans appeared to him to 
be completely one-sided and selfish. By the middle of 
April negotiations appeared to have reached a hopeless 
deadlock, and Macdonald was tempted to resign. Prospects 
of a better deal for Canada appeared when Britain offered 
to assume financial responsibility for the Fenian damages 
which she was claiming from the United States, and on 
this basis an agreement was reached. Macdonald still 
heartily disapproved of the whole settlement, and when 
he finally signed, it was not as the representative of 
Canada, but as an Imperial commissioner, and after having 
expressed his objections in a letter to Lord Granville,

the Colonial Secretary. 

The main terms of the Treaty of Washington were 

briefly as follows: 

1. The Americans were to be admitted to the Canadian 
fisheries for a ten year period, and Canadians to 
the American fisheries north of the 39th degree of 
north latitude* 

2. Both countries were to have free navigation of the 
St* Lawrence River system, including Lake Michigan, 
and also of the rivers of Alaska. 

3. There were to be mutual bonding privileges for 
twelve years, and limited reciprocity in the carry¬ 
ing trade of the Great Lakes* 

4. The only free trade was to be in fish and fish oil* 
This clause was probably the greatest disappointment 
to the Canadian people. 

5 0 The Fenian claims, on American insistence, were left 
out, and the other major questions — the Alabama 
claims, the San Juan boundary dispute, and Canada T s 
claim regarding the fisheries, that she had conceded 
more than she had been granted, were all to be 
settled by neutral arbitration. 

The Treaty of Washington was finally signed on 


May 8, 1871

The San Juan Dispute 

The dispute over the possession of San Juan 
Island was referred to the German emperor, who in 1872 
upheld the American claim to the fullest extent. He 
decided that the island of San Juan should be exclusively 
American property, and that the boundary line should 
follow the westernmost of the two channels in dispute, 
in other words, the one nearest to Vancouver Island, 

Canal de Haro. The decision caused some bitterness in 
Canada, as at that time, and during the years previous, 
the eastern channel, Rosario Strait, was the one most 
used, and seemed the most natural for a boundary line. 
However the matter was not looked upon as very vital, 
and was soon forgotten. 

Other Aspects of Canada’s External Relationships 
1867-1875 

Except for the Washington Conference Canada’s 
external relations between 1867 and 1875 were of little 
significance. Contacts with other nations were few and 
of a minor nature. There was a little trade with some 
foreign countries such as Prance, but by far the greater 
bulk of trade was with Great Britain and the United 
States. Canada had no diplomatic representation abroad, 
and Britain looked after her foreign relationships, which.

except for those concerning the United States, were unim¬ 
portant. Nevertheless there are certain aspects of 
Canadian relations with the United States and Great 
Britain during these years which are worthy of mention* 
Regarding the United States, the Riel Rebellion 
in Manitoba created a tense situation in that area, as 
many Americans were known to be working for the annexa¬ 
tion of the Red River region to the United States* A 
raid of Fenians into Manitoba actually took place in 
1871, and although it was promptly repulsed, it was a 
cause of concern to the Canadian government* The American 

fringe of settlement was perilously close to Manitoba, 
United States 

and since the A had rail service to the West, she was in 
far closer contact with the Red River settlement than 
Eastern Canada was* However the acquisition of the 
Hudson*s Bay Company ! s territories did much to dampen 
American efforts towards annexation, and after the 
formation of the province of Manitoba the excitement 
gradually died down. A noticeable improvement in 
Canadiah-American relations followed. The most import¬ 
ant boundary disputes had been settled, and those 
arising out of the American purchase of Alaska in 1867 
did not become acute until later. The Washington Treaty 
had contributed something to the settlement of the

fisheries dispute, and the bitterness engendered by the 
late Civil War was receding into the past. Consequently 
the over-all picture of Canadian-American relations was 
considerably brighter and more amicable in 1873 than in 
1867. 

With reference to Imperial relationships, it 
seemed to become established during these years that 
Canada would continue as a unit of the British Empire. 
This had been by no means certain during the twenty 
years immediately preceding Confederation, as a period 
of keen American desire for annexation had coincided 
with the nadir of British desire to retain her overseas 
possessions or to assume colonial responsibilities. In 
view of the foregoing it is obvious that the reason 
that Canada did not become a part of the United States 
was mainly because of an overwhelming desire on the part 
of the majority of her people to preserve the British 
connection. 

In the 1860 ! s and 1870 f s a re-orientation of 
Imperial policy took place, and colonies again came to 
be looked upon with favour. The British authorities 
felt however that a colony which had been granted self- 
government as Canada had been should be willing to 
assume increased responsibilities for its own defense. 












27 


and accordingly proposed to withdraw her troops from 
Canadian soil. The Canadian government protested, fear¬ 
ing aggression from the United States, and not feeling 
able as yet to provide adequate replacements. Although 
no agreement had been reached by 1870, the British 
government in that year insisted on removing all her 
troops except those at Halifax and Esquimalt, which were 
regarded as important naval bases, Canadians thought 
that this step was an unwarranted desertion, yet 
realized that in case of emergency British assistance 
would in all probability be available. 


D, Hansard and Canadian 
External Relationships 1867-1875 1 


A study of Hansard for the years immediately 
following Confederation is not very revealing, as far 
as foreign relationships are concerned. The broad flow 
of international events w63 almost completely neglected 
in the debates, and one could read them over from begin¬ 
ning to end and still remain in ignorance of what was

happening in the outside world. Hot only this* but even 
Canadian external relationships were almost completely 
left out of the picture. There were no debates on 
foreign policy* unless one regards the discussions on 
the Washington Treaty* after it had been signed* as such. 
This of course is hardly surprising* since in actuality 
no foreign policy existed. 

Although this is true* the debates do furnish 
interesting sidelights on certain events of international 
significance. As mentioned, a debate took place on the 
Washington Conference, which was of a very vigorous and 
controversial nature and which examined the subject 
thoroughly. 

As soon as the terms of the Treaty had been made 
public in May* 1871, a storm of protest was aroused in 
Canada. Parliament was not in session at the time* 
and nearly a year elapsed before discussion took place 
there, during the 1872 session. During the interval 
the Opposition, led by George Brown and his Toronto Globe, 
let loose a flood of abuse, representing Macdonald as a 
traitor to his country. Macdonald wisely remained 
silent, planning to show that the Opposition’s attitude 
was the same as his own had been, and therefore they had 
no right to criticize him for making the best of a bad

job. When Parliament met in 1872, he gave the House a 
thorough review of the circumstances leading up to the 
signing of the Treaty, and then defended his part in it 
on the grounds that he had done his best under difficult 
circumstances. His closing words are worthy of note; 

”1 believe the sober second thought of this country 
accords with the sober second thought of the Government, 
and we come down here and ask the people of Canada 
through their representatives to accept this treaty, to 
accept it with all its imperfections, to accept it for 
the sake of peace, and for the sake of the Great Empire, 
of which we form a part. M ^ 

The Opposition however continued to attack the 
Treaty, both in and out of the House, and it appeared 
for a time as if many of Macdonald 1 s supporters might 
desert him. However sufficient time had elapsed for 
the first wave of anger and frustration to have subsided. 
Macdonald*s strategy worked to perfection, and his 
generalship in the House was superb. The result was 
that the Treaty Bill was passed with a large majority.

The San Juan boundary dispute on the other hand 
aroused little discussion* beyond two questions put to 
Macdonald by Sir A.T. Galt* who wanted to know if any 
steps had been taken to have Canada’s interests repre¬ 
sented. Macdonald replied that it was a matter over 
which the Imperial Government had jurisdiction. Galt 
said that he feared Canada’s interests would be 
neglected, and Macdonald agreed it was possible.^ 

The Franco-Prussian War was referred to several 
times during the 1871 session, in a manner which indica¬ 
ted that Canada’s sympathies, if any, were with France. 
Mr. Mackenzie began his remarks on the address in reply 
to the Speech from the Throne by saying that the adminis 
tration of affairs and foreign events should be reviewed 
and continued as follows, "Stupendous events have taken 
place since the last session, including those of a 
gigantic and disastrous war. It is but right that I 
should express my sympathies with the sacrifices and 
sufferings of that great nation, being the friend and 
ally of England. I do hope that France will not suffer 
much either in feeling or interest in the forthcoming

treaty of peace. 

Mr. Macdonald in his reply followed the same 
theme: ”1 agree with the honorable member that we all 
should feel sympathy for the ancient ally of England 
in her troubles, but I cannot agree with the honorable 
member that this is the day of her greatest humiliation”. 
There never was a time in the history of Prance when her 
future appeared brighter. She will rise renovated by 
her great trial to her old place, and be one of the first 
powers of Europe, if she ever ceased to occupy that 
position; and I have no doubt that England and Prance 
again and again will act in concert as the foremost 
nations in civilization. 1,2 

Both speakers, one the Opposition leader and the 
other the Government leader, were applauded. Later in 
the session Macdonald announced that the Government 
would provide transportation for contributions to the 
Prench people. 3 Yet Britain’s relations with Germany

time, and it is difficult to account for the evident 
pro-French bias unless one assumes that both speakers

were courting the favour of Canada»s French population. 

There were a number of references to relations 
with the United States, aside from those bearing on the 
Washington Treaty. Francis Hincks in 1870 voiced the 
common fear that the Americans still desired to annex 
Canada, and cited recent events in the Red River Settle¬ 
ment as evidence.^ There were frequent references to 
the Fenian claims, and a lengthy discussion on the sub¬ 
ject took place in 1872, in which Canada T s claims for 
damages were re-affirmed. In 1870 L.S. Huntington brought 
forward a resolution proposing a customs union or zoll- 
verein with the United States, but it was defeated by a 

o 

large majority. 

The loyalty of Canada and the House to Great 
Britain was frequently affirmed, in the Speeches from 
the Throne and elsewhere. There were also frequent 
references to the problem of defense and particularly 
to the removal of the Imperial troops, for example by 
George Ryan in 1870 5 and by Mr, Cartwright and Sir G.E. 
Cartier in 1871, 4 all of whom expressed regret and 
concern over the suddenness of the step and the dangerous

position in which it placed Canada. 

With the above exceptions, the attentions of 
Canada*s Parliaments between 1867 and 1873 were almost 
exclusively taken up with matters of internal and 
domestic importance. The achievement of Confederation, 
and the following consolidation and expansion, were 
tremendous accomplishments, especially as they were 
crowded into the short space of six or seven years, and 
demanded the fullest attention of Parliament. Other 
matters of strictly Canadian concern -- the Red River 
Rebellion and the planning of a transcontinental rail¬ 
way for example — also required much consideration. 

Add to this the fact that Canada had no official voice 
in her external affairs, and it is not surprising that 
international affairs should have been so neglected. 
Canadians desired primarily to retain the Eritish 
connection,to preserve friendly relations with and 
independence from the United States, and to manage their 
internal affairs in their own way, and their most 
noticeable attitudes to the outside world were as yet 
those of disregard and indifference.

CHAPTER II 

THE MACKENZIE ADMINISTRATION (1873-1878) 


A, Canada Under Alexander Mackenzie 

The administration which succeeded that of 
Macdonald in November 1873 retained office until October 
1878. Its leader, Alexander Mackenzie, was a man of 
industry and character, honest and high-principled 
almost to a fault, but lacking in the qualities of 
leadership and co-ordinating ability so eminent in 
Macdonald. In the end his mishandling of affairs and 
mis judgment of public opinion brought about his downfall. 

Mackenzie began his administration under circum¬ 
stances which seemed to ensure a long continuance of 
power. The reduced majority which supported Macdonald 
after the general elections of 1872 had disintegrated 
and dwindled away during the disastrous affair of the 
Pacific Scandal, and in November 1873 he resigned with¬ 
out even waiting for a vote. So shocking had been the 
effect on public opinion that in the elections of 1874 
the Conservatives retained only 45 seats out of a total 
of 206, and it appeared that as a political party they 
might be ruined. Seldom has a political administration 
















35 


been given a more decisive mandate from the people than 
that given Alexander Mackenzie in 1874. 

However it was not long before the Liberals 
began to lose prestige. A world-wide depression over¬ 
took Canada at approximately the same time as they 
assumed office, and coincided with several crop failures. 
Although the resulting economic misfortunes could hardly 
be attributed to the administration, yet it received an 
increasing share of the blame. The Liberals had been 
swept into power so quickly that they had not had time 
to plan their course of action, and were handicapped 
by disagreements on policy within the party. Mackenzie 
lacked the personal magnetism of Macdonald, and had much 
difficulty in handling public relations and controlling 
his followers, especially the brilliant but erratic 
Edward Blake, who apparently entered and left the 
Ministry whenever he desired. Mackenzie saddled himself 
with the responsibilities of the Public Works Department, 
and devoted so much time to this position that his main 
duties as Prime Minister were neglected. Finally, both 
he and Blake seriously under-estimated the rising demand 
in Canada both for a transcontinental railway and for 
increased protection of Canadian industries. The net 
result was that the early popularity of the Liberal 
government declined rapidly.

In spite of his troubles Mackenzie could still 
boast of much real achievement during his term in office, 
which was not only efficient and economical but also 
entirely free from scandal# In fact these good features 
contributed in a very real sense to his downfall, as he 
relied almost solely on his record as an administrator 
for public favour# In 1874 a General Election law 
introduced voting by ballot and provided for simultan¬ 
eous elections throughout the country. In 1875, under 
the influence of Blake, a Canadian Supreme Court and 
Court of Exchequer were created. It is interesting to 
note that the Supreme Court Bill originally contained a 
clause prohibiting appeals to the Judicial Committee of 
the Privy Council unless imperial interests were directly 
affected# This clause had to be left out after a sharp 
objection had been received from London. However Blake 
and Mackenzie did succeed in limiting the prerogatives 
of the Governor General considerably, and thus made a 
noteworthy contribution to Canadian constitutional 
development. The North West Mounted Police was organized 
in 1874, and the Intercolonial Railway was completed and 
opened in 1876. Yet in spite of the significance of 
these and other accomplishments the success of Mackenzie f s 
term is diminished by the lack of vigor and foresight

which characterized his handling of vital questions such 
as the Pacific Railway, with which so little progress 
was made that British Columbia threatened to withdraw 
from Confederation. 

Macdonald was clever enough to take advantage 
of Macken z ie ! s mistakes. For two years he kept the 
Conservatives in the background, to let the Pacific 
Scandal die down and to allow his party to gather 
strength. He was confident that time would restore his 
fortunes, "Give the Grits rope enough ,f , he said, "and 
they will hang themselves”. When he saw that public 
opinion was steadily rising against the free-trade 
policies to which Mackenzie clung so persistently, he 
made tariffs the major issue of the 1878 elections, and 
used every device known to the politician to discredit 
the Government. The success of his campaign for a 
"National Policy" exceeded his wildest expectations, 
and he was returned to power by a majority hardly less 
remarkable than that which had rejected him in 1874. 


B. The International Scene, 1875-1878 
During the years of Alexander Mackenzie’s admin¬ 
istration in Canada world interest was centred mainly on 
the Balkans. Here Turkish misrule combined with the

ambitions of various Powers and the rising nationalism 
in the small Balkan states to produce one crisis after 
another* Turkish misdeeds increased while Turkish 
power declined, and, goaded to the breaking-point, Bosnia, 
Herzegovina, and Bulgaria all revolted in 1874 and 1875. 
The uprisings were put down with revolting cruelties and 
atrocities, but Serbia and Montenegro both went to war 
with Turkey in 1876. Although Montenegro won some 
successes, Serbia was badly defeated, and the anger of 
Russia was aroused. In 1877-1878 Russia, with the aid 
of Rumania and the states already engaged, inflicted a 
decisive defeat on the Turks, and Abdul Hamid sued for 
peace. A treaty was signed at San Stefano in March 
1878, giving Russia large concessions both in the Balkans 
and the Caucasus, and creating a large and independent 
Bulgaria. Britain and Austria both objected strongly to 
the terms of the treaty, and it became obvious that 
Russia ! s gains would not be consolidated without protest. 

As a result of the intervention of the Great 
Powers, the Congress of Berlin was held during June of 
1878. England and Austria united in demanding that 
Russia modify the terms of San Stefano, while Bismarck 
was primarily concerned with preventing an open breach 
between Austria and Russia. The Congress finally

accepted the arrangementthatRussia should give up the 
dominant position she had secured in the Balkans but 
retain her territorial gains in the Caucasus, while 
Britain should receive Cyprus and Austria control over 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The new large Bulgaria was to 
be reduced to one third of its size, and Rumania, 

Serbia, and Montenegro were all to be independent. 

While there was some wrangling over the terms of this 
settlement, most of the essential features had been 
arrived at previously by private negotiations between 
the powers. 

Several other aspects surrounding this affair 
are worthy of mention. In England opinion regarding 
the Turkish question was divided into two schools, one 
led by Gladstone and the other by Disraeli. Gladstone 
was mainly concerned with Turkish oppression and misrule 
in the Balkans, and demanded that they be expelled ’’bag 
and baggage” from the Balkan states, - a step that 
would aid Russian schemes. Disraeli was more anxious 
to prevent Russian expansion in the Balkans, and 
especially to prevent her from obtaining the Straits, 
so was willing to overlook Turkey 1 s misrule in order to 
preserve that country as a make-weight against Russia. 
Since he was in power at the time, and represented

Britain at Berlin, the emphasis of the British delega¬ 
tion was placed on checking Russia. 

Bismarck was in a difficult position throughout 
the conference, trying to restore harmony between his 
two allies Austria and Russia. He endeavored to 
represent himself merely as an "honest broker" seeking 
for peace, but it was becoming increasingly evident 
that the day was coming when he would have to choose 
one ally or the other. For the present he had not had 
to commit himself openly, but the Russians thought, 
with good reason, that he favoured Austria, and were 
offended. The check to Russia^ ambitions in the 
Balkans caused her to divert her attentions primarily 
to the Far East, where they remained until 1905. 

During these years France was content to avoid 
major commitments in world affairs. Her republican 
form of government, finally adopted in January 1875 
under President McMahon, did not keep her as isolated 
as Bismarck hoped it would, and after the war scare of 
1875 it appeared that she had gained a little sympathy 
in the eyes of the world, and that Germany had lost a 
little. With the approval of Bismarck she turned her 
eyes abroad in search of additional colonies, particu¬ 
larly in Africa, but her ambitions received a rude jolt

in 1875 when Disraeli bought out the Khedive’s holdings 
in the Suez Canal. Britain had shown little interest 
during the construction of this huge project, in which 
Prance had assumed the leading role, but Disraeli’s 
bold action at one step re-established Britain r s 
influence in Egypt and gave her control over the short 
route to the Par East. 


C. Canada T s External Relations, 1875-1878 

Canada’s external contacts during Mackenzie’s 
administration were limited both in extent and in sig¬ 
nificance. However there were a number of foreign dis¬ 
cussions and negotiations of some importance, nearly 
all of which concerned the United States. 

Brown’s Attempt to Reach a Reciprocity Agreement with 

the United States 

A cardinal feature of the Liberal G-overnment * s 
policy was its steady adherence to the principle of free 
trade. Mackenzie’s personal attitude to the question is 
clearly illustrated by his answer to Mr. Wallace of 
Norfolk in the 1875 session, who asked if it was the 
intention of the Government to renew negotiations during

the parliamentary recess for a reciprocity treaty with 
the United States. Mackenzie said in reply, "We will 
always he glad to negotiate for a Reciprocity Treaty 
with any nation."-*' 

However attempts to reach a reciprocity treaty 
with the United States met with little success. The 
most notable effort was that of George Brown in 1874. 

Brown, recently appointed a Senator, was sent 
to Washington in February 1874 as a confidential agent 
to ascertain whether or not the United States would 
look with favour on a restoration of reciprocity. He 
decided that there was a good chance of obtaining a 
treaty, and, acting on his advice, the Canadian govern¬ 
ment urged the Imperial authorities to take action, 
meanwhile insisting that a Canadian representative be 
retained on the negotiating commission. The result was 
that Brown was appointed joint plenipotentiary with Sir 
Edward Thornton, the British minister in Washington, and 
discussions were begun with Mr. Hamilton Fish, the 
American Representative.

The Canadian proposals, for which Brown was 
chiefly responsible, were briefly as follows: 

1. the free list of 1854 was to be restored and extended 

2. the two countries were to retain the fishing rights 
and navigation rights which were provided for in the 
Treaty of Washington 

3. the fishery arbitration provision of the Washington 
Treaty would be abandoned 

4. there were a number of other provisions respecting 
enlargement of waterways, coasting trade, and joint 
commissions 

5. the treaty was to last for twenty-one years, and 
thereafter was subject to three years T notice of 
termination by either side. 

Brown seriously misjudged American opinion and 
over-estimated American enthusiasm for the treaty, for in 
spite of favorable comments both in the American press 
and in Congress the draft treaty which was agreed upon 
was quietly shelved by the Senate until the next term 
and then rejected. The failure of his efforts was a 
great personal disappointment to Brown as well as a 
setback for those who advocated free trade. 

The most noteworthy aspect of this renewed 
attempt at reciprocity, aside from its revelation of

the commercial policy of the Liberal government, was in 
Mackenzie’s insistence on Canada’s right to representa¬ 
tion in any discussion which concerned her directly. 

This was in decided contrast to the reluctance of 
Macdonald and his colleagues to accept representation 
on the Washington Commission in 1871, and marked a step 
forward in Canada’s progress towards independence in 
foreign affairs, 

ihe Halifax Tribunal (1877) 

The rejection by the American Senate of the 
Brown-Fish Treaty in 1874 necessitated the settlement by 
arbitration of the dispute over the excess value of the 
fisheries, as provided for under the Treaty of Washington, 
After some delay the negotiating commission was organized 
and met in Halifax in June 1877. It consisted of a 
representative for Canada, Sir A.T. Galt, one for the 
United States, Judge E # H. Kellogg, and a neutral com¬ 
missioner, Maurice Delfosse, the Belgian minister at 
Washington, In this arbitration Canada thus assumed a 
still more independent position than that at Washington 
in 1874, where Brown had joint membership with a British 
representative, as in this case Galt sat alone on the 
commission as sole British representative.

The outcome of the arbitration was extremely 
satisfactory to Canada* and to the ability and untiring 
effort of Galt is due much of the credit. The tribunal 
decided by majority decision that Canada and Newfound- 
land should receive together $5,500,000 as compensation 
for the superior value of their fisheries, of which 
$4,420,882 was to be Canada's share. Kellogg had dis¬ 
agreed with the other members over the amount, and the 
award aroused much dissatisfaction in the United States. 
The money was paid, with a bad grace, after a few months 
delay, but public opinion in the United States was so 
opposed to the settlement that the fishery clauses of 
the Washington Treaty were abrogated as soon as possible 
in 1885. The fishery question then reverted to the 
unsatisfactory pre-1871 position, with the Canadian 
government endeavoring to exclude American fishermen 
from Canadian fishing grounds. 

The Dispute over Mutual Use of Waterways 

The Washington treaty had provided that the 
American and British governments would try to persuade 
local authorities (i.e., the state, dominion, and 
provincial governments) to permit mutual use of their 
waterways. In 1874 the Canadian government complained

that although the Americans were being allowed the use 
of Canada*s waterways, Canadians were not being granted 
similar privileges, particularly regarding the passage 
through the Champlain Canal to the Hudson River. The 
governor of New York State insisted that no legal 
obstacles existed, but it turned out that Canadian 
vessels were being compelled to discharge their cargo 
at the first point of entry, and were not being permit¬ 
ted to go any further. After long discussions between 
Hamilton Pish and Sir Edward Thornton, the Secretary of 
the Treasury was asked to use his power to specify the 
ports at which Canadian vessels might unload their 
cargoes, and in 1876 Canadian vessels were given permis¬ 
sion to go as far as Albany, via Plattsburg, Oswego, 
or Buffalo. 

The Lake of the Woods Boundary Settlement 

The Lake of the Woods boundary disagreement was 
brought to a head in 1870 when a group of American 
engineers•reported that a Hudson f s Bay Company post to 
the north of Pembina was on American soil. The uncer¬ 
tainty was caused by ambiguities in previous treaties, 
particularly those of 1783 after the American Revolution, 
the Jay Treaty of 1794, and the Convention of 1818,

mainly resulting from ignorance of the geography of the 
regions west of the Great Lakes. It had been finally 
agreed in 1818 that the boundary line between the n Stony ,f 
Mountains and the Lake of the Woods should start from 
the most northwesterly point of the said lake and follow 
the 49th parallel, and if necessary a line should be 
drawn from this point due north or south, as the case 
might be, until the 49th parallel was reached. The 
most northwesterly point of the Lake of the Woods had 
been determined in 1826, but the matter had been allowed 
to lapse until 1870, when President Grant received the 
above mentioned engineer’s report, and decided to ask 
Congress to arrange for a settlement. 

After the British government had been approached 
a joint commission was appointed, in which Captain D.A. 
Cameron represented Britain and Archibald Campbell the 
United States. The first meeting was held at Pembina in 
1871. It soon became obvious that the American conten¬ 
tion was correct, and that if the agreement of 1818 were 
carried out the Hudson’s Bay post in question would 
indeed be on American soil. Captain Cameron tried to 
make some arrangement so that Canada could retain the 
small peninsula upon which the post stood, but the 
American government was adamant, so he finally gave way.

The treaty was ratified in May 1876. 

The whole affair was of little importance, of 
less actually to the United States than Canada, to whom 
the post had a certain value as the starting point of a 
road to Fort Garry. Consequently the Dominion was rather 
irritated at the apparent obstinacy of the United States 
in insisting on a full maintenance of its rights in 
such a small matter, but realized that on legal grounds 
it had no justification for complaint. 

The t! Canada First” Movement 

The achievement of Confederation initiated in 
Canada during the succeeding years attempts to form a 
foreign policy which would be in line with her best 
interests. There were at least three schools of thought 
regarding the direction these efforts should take, one, 
to effect closer relationships with Great Britain and 
the Empire, another, to loosen the Empire connection 
in favour of closer ties with the United States, and a 
third, to'try to make Canada as independent as possible 
of any nation, and to let her develop along lines which 
would be both individualistic and nationalistic. An 
example of the latter viewpoint is provided by the so- 
called ,! Canada First" group which flourished during the

1870 * s• 

The Canada First movement began soon after Con¬ 
federation when a group of young men met in Ottawa and 
vowed to try to foster the growth of a national senti¬ 
ment • The movement soon came to be associated with its 
motto, "Canada First", from which it derived its name. 

At first it was non-political, but it was gradually 
drawn into the political arena, and under the leader¬ 
ship of W.A. Foster succeeded in electing Thomas Moss 
to the Dominion parliament. It gained great prestige 
from the fact that it included among its members Edward 
Blake, who had retired from the Mackenzie government in 
1874, and Goldwin Smith. Blake 1 s "Aurora Speech", 
delivered in that town in October 1874, is still famous. 

The "Canada First” group was intensely nation¬ 
alistic, and, emphasizing the country*s possibilities, 
stressed the need for Canadian development, Canadian 
junity, and a distinctly Canadian character, rather than 
one merely inherited or copied from other lands. They 
demanded a retention of the British connection, consoli¬ 
dation of the Empire, a larger voice in external affairs, 
the encouragment of immigration, protection of native 
industry, and an improved militia, commanded by Canadian 
officers. 













50 


The movement had wide appeal at first, and 
proved to be a thorn in the side of the Mackenzie govern¬ 
ment, which had little sympathy with some of its 
objectives, John A. Macdonald drew freely on ’’Canada 
First’ 1 proposals to form the National Policy which 
defeated the Liberals in 1878, but the movement itself 
had lost its influence as a political organization by 
that time. Its early demise was caused by a variety of 
factors — internal dissension, lack of definite plans 
for action, opposition of the Government, and the 
defection of Elake in 1875. Many of the ideals for 
which the movement stood have however survived to the 
present day, and have become accepted facts or policies 
in the Canadian way of life. Both major political 
parties have borrowed freely of its ideas, and W. 
Stewart Wallace goes so far as to say that ’’the political 
history of Canada since 1874 has been essentially the 
story of how the two traditional parties of the Dominion 
have raided the platform of ’’Canada First” for most of 
their ideas.” 1

Hansard and Canadian External Relationships, 1875-1878 

As was the case in the preceding period, the 
debates of the Canadian House of Commons during Mackenzie ! s 
administration do not throw a great deal of light on 
Canadian external relations. There were no major 
debates on foreign affairs, and the situation in 
Europe and the world at large appears to have been of 
minor concern to Canada's members of parliament. What 
discussion there was dealt mostly with Canada's trade 
and boundary negotiations with the United States, but 
even in this field there was no event of equal import- 
ance to the Washington Treaty to attract the attention 
of parliament. Consequently during this period there 
is a dearth of material which would reveal clearly 
Canada's views on foreign affairs. However interesting 
sidelights on Canadian public opinion may sometimes be 
obtained by observing scattered remarks of members, and 
on occasion also questions were asked or motions intro¬ 
duced which indicate that Parliament's interest in 
foreign affairs was not entirely absent. 

The Washington Treaty had been in operation for 
over two years when Mackenzie came to power, but members 
still referred to it in a manner which indicated that it 
was still a matter of current interest and that its pro-

visions were a cause of controversy with the United 
States. In 1875* for example. Amor de Cosmos of 
Victoria, B.C., moved n an Address to His Excellency the 
Governor General for a copy of all correspondence between 
the Dominion Government and that of the United States,... 
... respecting the right of entering fish-oils and fish 
of British Columbia, duty free. In the United States, 
under the twenty-first article of the Treaty of 
Washington.”^ In the following year he renewed his 
request for the correspondence, and complained that the 
United States was denying British Columbia the benefits 
of the treaty. He said In part, ”They (the United 
States authorities) maintain that British Columbia, not 
having been a part of the Dominion at the date of the 
negotiation of this Treaty, cannot be admitted to the 
enjoyment of its benefits. I believe that this position 
is unreasonable.” 2 Blake in reply promised to bring 
down the correspondence, but remarked that he feared It 
would not be very satisfactory. In the same session 
Jones of-Halifax complained of an alleged violation of

the Treaty by the United States in placing duty on 
packages of Canadian fish. Mackenzie in reply remarked 
that ff it seemed to be all but impossible to procure an 
enlightened carrying out of the Treaty of Washington by 
the Americans”,^ and also voiced the complaint mentioned 
earlier in this chapter that whereas American vessels 
were receiving free use of Canadian waterways, Canadian 
vessels were being denied the same privilege in the 
United States. 1 2 3 

In the session of 1875 Mills of Northumberland 
introduced a motion asking for correspondence regarding 
compensation to be paid by the United States to Canada 
for the right of fishing in Canadian waters. A lengthy 
discussion took place in which the entire background of 
the Washington Treaty was reviewed, but at the end 
Mackenzie persuaded Mills to withdraw his motion, saying 
that the Government was not prepared to take any action 
in the matter as yet.^ 

The question of reciprocity with the United 
States was raised in the House again on several occasions. 
In 1875 a Mr. Plumb asked for correspondence regarding

reciprocity to be laid before the House, and in a lengthy 
speech gave reasons for opposing a renewal of reciprocity ^ 
Government supporters endeavored to refute Plumb’s argu¬ 
ments, and the discussion ended on an inconclusive note. 

In 1878 two members inquired if the Government intended 
to try to renew reciprocity with the United States, and 
to both Mackenzie replied that while no treaty was in 
process of negotiation at the time, the Government would 
give due consideration to any proposition from the other 
side of the border, s 

The entry of British Columbia into Confederation, 
and the extension of Canada to the Pacific, naturally 
caused Canadians, particularly British Columbians, to 
consider the possibilities of establishing trade rela¬ 
tions with other nations in the Pacific area. Some 
indication of this was given in the House in 1875, when 
de Cosmos moved that "in view of extending the commerce 
of the Dominion on the Pacific, it is desirable that the 
Government take into consideration the advisableness of 
securing *a commercial treaty between Canada and the 
Hawaiian Kingdom, similar to the treaty negotiated

between that Kingdom and the United States." 1 His later 
remarks express, odd as it may seem today, a desire to 
prevent the United States from acquiring the Hawaiian 
Islands. "The object of the United States is simply to 
acquire possession of the Sandwich Islands. From a 
national standpoint it would be most unfavourable to the 
Interests of Great Britain that what might be called the 
half-way house between British Columbia and the 
Australasian Colonies and China should fall Into the 
hands of the United States, as in all probability it 
would, unless the Dominion Government saw that it was 
to their Interest that it should be maintained as an 
independent country."^ Mackenzie in reply expressed 
approval of the motion, but was doubtful whether the 
Government could do much in the matter. 

In 1876 the Hon. Mr. Mitchell enquired whether 
any steps had been taken by the Government to open up 
trade with the British and Foreign West Indies and South 
America, and whether any person had been appointed in 
connection with that service.^ Mackenzie replied that

the Government was trying to establish trade with the 
West Indies, but had as yet appointed no one on behalf 
of the Government. 1 The general feeling as revealed in 
this and a later discussion appeared to be that the 
institution of efficient steamer service and a lowering 
of duties would do much to stimulate trade with the West 
Indies. In 1878 a similar inquiry was made by Young of 
South Waterloo constituency respecting trade with the 

p 

Australian colonies# 

The question of the British Columbia - Alaska 
boundary line was brought up several times, and requests 
were made to have it accurately determined. In 1875 
Roscoe moved "an address to His Excellency the Governor 
General praying him to call the attention of Her 
Majesty T s Government to the necessity of having the 
boundary line between British Colimbia and Alaska as 
soon as possible defined and surveyed".^ in his speech 
he outlined the situation in Alaska and told of troubles 
which were already arising there because of the uncer¬ 
tainty which existed. Other members expressed a desire 
to have the question settled, and de Cosmos even advocated

the purchase of the Alaskan Panhandle, a suggestion which 
Mackenzie said could not seriously be proposed in the 
House* The question was brought up again in each of the 
remaining sessions, and in 1877 Mackenzie was able to 
say that correspondence had passed between the govern¬ 
ments concerned, but it was not in the public interest 
that it should be brought down at that time*^ In 1878 
he described the efforts that had been made to have the 
true boundary line according to the Russian Convention 
of 1825 determined by exploratory survey, but so far 
without success* 1 2 * 

The problem of immigration was referred to spas¬ 
modically, and all members appeared to agree that one of 
Canada>s greatest needs was that of increased population* 
De Cosmos in 1875 asked whether the Government had taken 
any steps to provide European or Canadian immigrants for 
British Columbia, particularly to assist in the building 
of the western division of the Canadian Pacific Railway, 
and indicated that an increase of Chinese immigrants 
would be objectionable to the white settlers in that 
province* 5 Mackenzie replied ,f The Government have not

taken any special means to introduce any class of immi¬ 
grants into that country.”! 

An interesting discussion took place in the House 
in 1875 respecting international arbitration* and several 
members gave detailed expositions of their views.^ 

Malcolm Cameron moved that Her Majesty "will be graciously 
pleased to cause her principal Secretary of State for 
Foreign Affairs, to enter into negotiation with foreign 
powers with a view to further improvement in international 
law, and the establishment of a general and permanent 
system of International Arbitration. 1,3 In a lengthy and 
eloquent speech he expressed his conviction that warfare 
was both evil and unnecessary, and called for the estab¬ 
lishment of some system which would enable disputes to be 
settled peacably. Other members expressed general agree¬ 
ment with his principles, although Mr. Brouse maintained 
that certain exceptions must be made, and that at times 
"peace at any price” is as objectionable as war itself.^ 
Plumb took the view that Canada*s foreign affairs were 
the responsibility of Great Britain, and that therefore

the House was out of order in discussing the question* 1 
Both he and Mackenzie stressed that no Canadian motion 
in favour of arbitration would have much practical 
effect on the major powers * and in response to 
Mackenzie*s request the motion was withdrawn* The dis¬ 
cussion was significant however, in that it provided 
one of the few occasions when the general problem of 
foreign affairs was discussed in the House, and 
revealed the concern, which was already apparent in 
Canada, over the spectacle of European nations arming 
to the teeth. It is obvious that Canada*s representa¬ 
tives were already wondering what Canada*s part in a 
major European conflict would be.

CHAPTER III 

THE LAST DAYS OP MACDONALD, 1878-1891 


A, Canadian Affairs 1878-1891 
The history of this period is to a large extent 
the biography of Sir John A. Macdonald, who dominated 
affairs from his return to power in 1878 until his 
death in 1891 perhaps more completely than any Canadian 
prime minister before or since. Admittedly he did 
little to raise the moral standards of Canadian politics 
I and the last years of his government were featured by 
increasing corruption, but considering the thirteen 
years as a whole it is evident that he accomplished a 
great deal* 

Macdonald and his followers were fortunate that 
their return to power coincided in point of time with a 
striking revival of the country 1 s economic fortunes. 
Although the return to prosperity could not properly be 
accredited to them, yet they naturally reaped the 
political benefit, and the widdom of Macdonald’s 
"National Policy” seemed to be confirmed. Actually the 
recovery was world-wide, and as far as Canada was con¬ 
cerned was aided materially by a number of other factors

such as a series of good crops, an expanding grain 
market due to several crop failures in Great Britain, 
and a rapid development of the West* 

Macdonald was sustained in four elections during 
these years, the last being held shortly before his 
death in 1891* The first, which returned him to power, 
gave him a majority of 86 in a House of 206, and wide 
margins in nearly all the provinces, including Quebec. 

In the elections of 1882 the Conservatives had not 
only the advantage of renewed prosperity but also the 
prestige given by the much-publicized "National Policy” 
and the recently accomplished Canadian Pacific Railway 
agreement, so again won handily. The outcome of the 
1887 elections was more doubtful, owing mainly to a 
return of depression and to religious dissension arising 
from the execution of Louis Riel, but the Liberals were 
badly disorganized and Macdonald f s personal prestige 
was great enough to carry the Conservatives through to 
another victory, though with a reduced majority. The 
last election, in 1891, was fought mainly on the issue 
of reciprocity, which Macdonald did not oppose until 
the Liberals made a somewhat disunited stand in favour 
of it. Opportunist as usual, he fell back on his old 
stand-by, the "National Policy”, and trumped-up charges

of disloyalty on the part of the opposition. With the 
aid of several telling catch-phrases such as M A British 
subject I was born, a British subject I will die” and 
"The old man, the old flag, and the old policy* 1 he was 
able to rally enough support to win his last victory. 
Macdonald himself did not long survive the elections, 
which had taxed his strength severely, and died several 
months later. 

Macdonald is associated prominently with four 
great achievements, any one of which would be sufficient 
to assure him of lasting fame. More than any other 
person he was responsible for Confederation, although 
it must be admitted that he was one of the last to 
accept the idea. He took the initiative in securing 
the transfer of the Hudsons* Bay Company Territories 
and in the formation of the Province of Manitoba, yet 
was guilty of permitting unnecessary delays and blunders 
which contributed to the outbreak of two rebellions. 

The Canadian Pacific Railway is a monument to his vision 
and persistent courage, but even this great accomplish¬ 
ment was marred by a scandal which forced him to resign 
in disgrace. Finally, he launched the "National Poliey", 
which has been a cornerstone of Canadian policy ever 
since, but the concept of this doctrine did not originate

with him and its true economic value has been questioned 
by many capable thinkers, although no one denies that it 
has at least contributed towards the development of a 
distinctly Canadian nationalism. It is evident that 
even Sir John’s greatest achievements have their darker 
side* 

During Macdonald’s last years a decline in the 
ascendancy of the Conservative party set in, clearly 
indicated by decreasing majorities in the House of 
Commons. Some of the factors causing this situation 
would have been difficult for anyone to control —■ the 
depression which again overtook Canada during the 1880*s, 
the refusal of the United States to consider reciprocity, 
which both parties would have been willing to accept by 
1890, the widespread emigration to the greener pastures 
south of the border, and the ever-present racial and 
religious problem, which grew steadily more acute as the 
years went by. In other cases the blame could be 
attached either to Macdonald’s own or to the 

increasing lethargy and lack of principle among his 
followers. The North West Rebellion could perhaps have 
been avoided by the use of a little more tact, but once 
it had occurred, and the Riel affair had to be settled, 
Macdonald found himself on the horns of a dilemma offering

no solution which could possibly satisfy all groups. 

He decided to sacrifice Riel, and Quebec never forgave 
him. Liberal charges of laxity and corruption in 
various departments of government appear to have been 
well-founded, and one minister. Sir Hector Langevin, 
was so clearly guilty of negligence that he finally had 
to resign. Macdonald himself appeared to be willing to 
sacrifice moral principles for political advantage, and 
at least two of his measures, the Redistribution of 
Seats Bill of 1882 and the Dominion Franchise Law of 
1885, revealed a consuming desire to perpetuate his 
term in office whether by fair means or foul. As a 
result a noticeable decrease in Conservative power 
began during Macdonald*s last years, which heralded the 
more rapid decline after his death. 

B, The International Scene, 1878-1891 
In Europe between 1878 and 1891 the Bismarchian 
system prevailed. It consisted of an increasingly 
tangled network of treaties and alliances designed to 
preserve German security, but there were clear indica¬ 
tions, even before the fall of Bismarck, that this ideal 
was not to be attained. The Dreikaiser Bund, originally 
formed in 1875 in an attempt to preserve good relations

65 


with Austria and Russia and to prevent these two countries 
from fighting each other, was defined by treaty at Berlin 
in 1881, and renewed in 1884, but allowed to lapse in 
1887* A defensive alliance with Austria was formally 
initiated in 1879 and renewed at subsequent intervals 
until 1914® This Dual Alliance was expanded into the 
famous Triple Alliance in 1882 when Italy was included, 
her entry being largely the result of the French annexa¬ 
tion of Tunis in 1881, which Bismarck had craftily 
encouraged. Italy voluntarily renewed the Triple 
Alliance in 1887, and it was again renewed in the 
spring of 1891. Rumania was attached to the Triple 
Alliance, and Bismarck made repeated efforts to secure 
the active support of Great Britain, though without 
conspicuous success. When it became obvious that the 
Dreikaiser Bund was a thing of the past, Bismarck was 
able to substitute for it a dual arrangement between 
Germany and Russia, the much-discussed Re-insurance 
Treaty of 1887, with a secret clause, contrary to 
Austria*s interests, which was not made public until 
1893. 

In spite of his many alliances it was obvious 
by 1888 that the Bismarckian system was collapsing, and 
that German security was as remote as ever. In 1885 a 










66 


sudden uprising in Eastern Rumelia resulted in the union 
of "the two Bulgarias" — Eastern Rumelia and Bulgaria 
proper — under Prince Alexander of Battenberg. Serbia, 
already in high dudgeon over the disregard of her claims 
at the Congress of Berlin, promptly attacked the new 
state and was disastrously defeated at Slivnitza. 
Alexander was kidnapped and forced to abdicate, and 
Bulgaria after 1887 was ruled by the strongly anti- 
Russian Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg. Russia had 
been opposed to the Bulgarian union, which Austria, 

Italy and Britain had accepted, and had counted on 
Bismarck f s support to help prevent it. This support had 
not been given, and Russia, already irritated by Bismarck* 
betrayal of her interests at the Congress of Berlin, 
became still further alienated, and concluded that the 
Re-insurance Treaty of 1887 was worthless, as on all 
occasions German support was given to Austria rather 
than to Russia. Thus the Bulgarian crisis in 1885 really 
ended the Dreikaiser Bund, and it became necessary for 
Russia to look elsewhere for allies, especially after 
the terms of the German-Austrian Treaty of 1879 had been 
made public by Bismarck in 1888. 







67 


It was impossible at that time for a close under¬ 
standing between Britain and Russia to be seriously con¬ 
sidered, and so France was approached as the only 
possible prospect for a friendly agreement. Great 
Britain and Russia had nearly come to blows in Afghanis¬ 
tan in 1885, and their interests appeared to clash over 
every issue. France, now a confirmed republic, like 
Russia was seeking to overcome her isolation and feared 
aggression either from Germany or from the entire Triple 
Alliance. As a result the two began to draw together, 
and a large loan was floated in Paris to aid in the 
construction of the proposed trans-Siberian railway. 

What Bismarck would have done In the face of this new 
development is doubtful, but it may be safely assumed 
that he would have found some means to help counteract 
or circumvent it. But William II had ascended the 
German throne in 1888, and in the face of his rash and 
ill-advised desire to handle German affairs himself 
there was no course open to Bismarck other than to 
resign. He was succeeded by inferior advisers, and a 
first consequence was that no attempt was made to renew 
the Re-Insurance Treaty with Russia, which lapsed after 


1890 











68 


In the 1880 f s the mad scramble for overseas 
colonies began in earnest, and by 1891 practically all 
unclaimed lands had been occupied by one or the other 
of the major European powers. Prance seized Tunis in 
1881, Madagascar in 1884, and a large part of Indo China 
between 1882 and 1885, Great Britain occupied Egypt, in 
spite of stiff opposition from France^and Belgium between 
1878 and 1884 established herself in the Congo territory, 
Russia, forced to divert her attention from Afghanistan 
and India, turned her attention towards both Turkestan 
and China, while Germany, under the direction of 
Bismarck, abandoned her policy of avoiding commitments 
outside Europe to seize important territories at widely 
scattered points across the globe, including South West 
Africa, Tanganyika, Togoland, the Gameroons. New Guinea, 
and Samoa. An important acquisition was made in 1890, 
about the time of Bismarck^ fall, when Germany acquired 
the island of Heligoland from Great Britain, giving in 
return the island of Zanzibar and certain other conces¬ 
sions. 

These colonial acquisitions were made without 
serious conflicts between the Powers, but it was obvious 
that if any nation attempted to expand any further it 
would only be at the expense of some other nation, and

the dangers of conflict were thus increased. 

C. Canadian External Relationships, 1878-1891 

The Fisheries 

The fisheries question suddenly came to the fore¬ 
ground again when the United States in 1885 terminated 
the fisheries clauses of the Washington Treaty. The 
American action was caused partly because of dissatis¬ 
faction with the treaty of 1871 and the financial award 
to Canada in 1877, and partly because of the fact that 
the mackerel in the Atlantic Ocean had abandoned their 
former northern habitat in favour of a new one in 
American waters. A number of unpleasant incidents, 
notably an attack by Newfoundlanders in 1878 on 
American fishermen in Fortune Bay, had heightened 
American displeasure. 

After 1885 the situation reverted to that prevail¬ 
ing after 1818, with the Canadian government endeavouring 
to protect its fisheries from incursions by Americans, 
and with retaliatory measures being enacted by both 
sides. The United States charged that Canada was attemp¬ 
ting to force her into a renewal of the Reciprocity 
Treaty of 1854, and Canada in turn revived the old cry 
of annexation.

Fortunately there was willingness on both sides 
to attempt a settlement of the matter, although the 
United States showed a certain reluctance to deal 
directly with Canada because of her incomplete sover¬ 
eignty, However after an -unofficial visit of Charles 
Tupper to Washington at the invitation of Secretary of 
State Bayard, a conference was proposed, and the 
co-operation of the British government secured. The 
conference met in Washington in 1887-1888, with Tupper, 
Joseph Chamberlain, and Sir Lionel Sackvilie West as 
British Empire delegates, and Bayard, W,L, Putnam, and 
James B, Angell as representatives of the United States, 
Tupper f s attempts to secure a reciprocity treaty failed, 
and the main outcome of the conference, the Chamberlain- 
Bayard Treaty of 1888, was not ratified by the American 
Senate, so did not come into operation. The Canadian 
government in a spirit of conciliation agreed to a 
"modus vivendi" which gave American fishermen who pur¬ 
chased licenses most of the privileges they desired, and 
which, although originally intended to last for only two 
years, continued in effect until 1924, Tupper was 
bitterly disappointed at the failure of his reciprocity 
negotiations, but the conference had some practical 
benefit as Canadian-American relations in regard to the

fisheries were greatly improved between 1888 and 1905. 

The Irish Question 

Regarding the delicate question of Irish self- 
government Canadian public opinion was divided. Undoubt¬ 
edly there was a very general sympathy with the mis¬ 
fortunes of the Irish people, and Liberals throughout 
Canada, particularly French-Canadian Liberals, followed 
the lead of that party in England in supporting the 
cause of Irish Home Rule. Many others however, and 
especially Conservatives, were strong Unionists, their 
opposition to the Idea of granting Home Rule to Ireland 
coming not so much from any desire to hold the Irish 
down as from the fear of papal Influence in that 
country. Macdonald himself was a strong Unionist, and 
as such regarded Gladstones policy as dangerous to the 
Empire. At the same time he had much sympathy for 
Ireland*s unhappy state, and it is evident from Pope’s 
comments that he spent a great deal of time reflecting 
on the Irish problem. He believed that a system of 
local self-government might be suitable for the Irish, 
but regarded complete Home Rule as out of the question 
owing to the bitter enmity of the Irish towards all 
things English. Accordingly he was instrumental in

toning down several resolutions proposed in the Canadian 
House of Commons, which in their original form rather 
pointedly advised the British government to give the 
Irish the privilege of governing themselves.^” 

The Development of the Idea of Imperial Federation 

During the 1840 ! s, 1850 ! s, and 1860*s there had 
been in Great Britain a tendency to regard colonies with 
increasing disfavour, and in some quarters there had 
grown up a demand, if not to sever all connections with 
them, at least to leave them to take care of themselves. 
Peel, Bright, and Cobden were the apostles of this idea, 
which was closely associated with the new theories of 
the advantages of free trade over protection, and the 
abandonment of mercantilistic principles. In the late 
1860 ? s, however, a theory of Empire unity began to grow, 
to which Disraeli soon became a convert, and of which 
Joseph Chamberlain later became a leading exponent. 

Other prominent figures in this new movement were 
Rudyard Kipling, who became the poet of imperialism, 
and the empire-builder, Cecil Rhodes, 

Once this tendency had begun. Great Britain took

the lead in promoting closer Empire relationships, and 
in 1884 the Imperial Federation League was organized in 
London, with W.E. Forster, former Under Secretary for the 
Colonies, as chairman. The league had as its object the 
federation of the Empire, but though plans were worked 
out for a single parliament at Westminster, the members 
refused to commit themselves to any definite plan, for 
fear of alienating those who would find such a close 
union unacceptable. 

A subsidiary Imperial Federation League of 
Canada was founded in 1885, with Montreal as headquarters 
and branches at Ingersoll, Peterborough, Toronto, and 
Halifax. Colonel G.T. Denison, John Beverley Robinson, 
and William Hamilton Merritt were some of the leading 
spirits in the organization of the Canadian branch of 
the league. 

Opinion in Canada was fairly well divided on the 
issue. The Manitoba Free Press, for example, ridiculed 
the federation proposals, 1 while the Evening Mail of 
Halifax favoured a commercial union with Empire countries 
as preferable to one with the United States. 2 Both

political parties loudly proclaimed layalty to the Empire 
in the elections of 1891, but the Conservative protesta¬ 
tions made the more favourable impression after it had 
been established that several prominent Liberals were 
associated with a movement for unlimited reciprocity with 
the United States, and this factor contributed materially 
to the Conservative victory. Macdonald himself unreser¬ 
vedly favoured any policy which would bring about closer 
and more harmonious relations within the Supire, but 
looked on the idea of a single Parliament at Westminster 
as both dangerous and foolish. 

Macdonald’s Defense Policy and His Attitude Towards 
Imperial Commitments 

The question of defense from the colonies’ stand¬ 
point had two main aspects, first, responsibility for 
local defense, and second, participation in the defense 
of part or all of the Empire. Canada during the years 
following Confederation gradually assumed more respon¬ 
sibility for local defense, but under Macdonald generally 
refused to accept obligations outside of Canada. Great 
Britain consistently advocated full co-operation among 
Empire countries In Empire defense, and several of the 
colonies gave her a certain amount of moral and material 
support. In 1884 New South Wales offered a contingent

to help in the relief of General Gordon at Khartoum, and 
Cape Colony and several of the Australian colonies began 
to make small contributions to Empire naval defense. 
Macdonald however emphatically refused to help in the 
relief of Khartoum* saying "The Suez Canal is nothing 
to us ... our men and money would therefore be sacrificed 
to get Gladstone and Co. out of the hole they have 
plunged themselves into by their own imbecility." 1 At 
the same time his representative at the first Colonial 
Conference in 1887 refused to make direct contributions 
to naval defense, maintaining that in the construction 
of the Intercolonial and Canadian Pacific Railways 
Canada had made a far more costly and at the same time 
a far more worthy contribution to Empire defense than by 
granting.paltry sums to the Imperial navy. MacKay and 
Rogers sum up Macdonald»s defense policy in the follow¬ 
ing manner: "The Macdonald policy was indeed that of a 
self-governing colony, similar to the policies of the 
American colonies in the seventeenth and early eighteenth 
centuries. On the whole, the policy appears to have been 
generally acceptable in Canada, except to ultra-imperialists

But it was not seriously challenged, largely because 
during the Macdonald era the Empire was a safe and expand¬ 
ing empire without serious rivals.” 1 


Hansard and Canadian External Relationships, 1878-1891 

If one may judge from the debates in the House 
of Commons, Canadian interest in world affairs showed 
signs of expanding during Macdonald’s last years. It 
is probably not true to say that this interest was much 
in evidence except in relation to events which directly 
affected Canada, but at the same time there were sig¬ 
nificant signs that Canadians were beginning to feel 
themselves as being part of a world community, and not 
merely confined to North America alone. A brief summary 
I of the relevant features in Hansard may help to make 
this clear. 

Lengthy discussions took place in nearly every 
session on the immigration question, particularly regard¬ 
ing Chinese immigration into British Columbia, which was 
assuming such proportions that it threatened to outnumber

the white population in that province. British Columbia 
representatives desired to restrict Chinese immigration 
on the grounds that white labor was being underbid, 
although others, mostly members from Eastern Canada, 
took the view that Chinese labor was necessary to com¬ 
plete the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway and 
j even that it would be desirable in Eastern Canada, where 
| man-power for industrial and agricultural purposes was 
scarce. All agreed that it would be inadvisable to 
permit large numbers of Chinese to settle permanently in 
Canada, in view of the impossibility of assimilating 
them with our population, and in 1885 a bill was passed 
to restrict and regulate Chinese immigration. 

I Inquiries were made about Irish^ and Jewish 2 

immigration in 1883, and in the same year the prospects 
of encouraging immigration from Germany were discussed. 3 

Canadian concern over the continued exodus of 
people to the United States was amply revealed by the 
frequent questions and suggestions made in the House.

introduced a motion asking for a committee to enquire 
about the extent of Canadian emigration to the United 
States, its chief causes, and the best means of prevent- 
ing it. A lengthy and interesting discussion followed. 
Both parties admitted the seriousness of the problem and 
professed a desire to overcome it, but the Government 
forces voted the original motion down on the grounds that 
it was designed primarily to discredit the National 
Policy. 1 2 3 

The Irish question received a considerable 
amount of attention in the House, and in 1880 a sum of 
$100,000 was voted for Irish relief.^ On May 6 a 
debate occurred which kept the House in session until 
after 4 o f clock in the morning. A great variety of 
opinions wa$ expressed in the course of framing a 
resolution of advice to the British Government as to 
how to handle the Irish question, with Macdonald leading 
the forces opposed to Home Rule and Blake those in 
favour of it. The debate proved little except that 
there was a violent difference of opinion, in Canada 
over the Home Rule issue.3

An increasing amount of attention was paid to 
the development of Canada*s external trade, in some 
cases with countries which up to that time had not 
exchanged any quantity of goods with us. In 1881 a 
trade consul was appointed in Rio Janeiro, to awaken a 
desire to exchange goods with Canada, and arrangements 
were made for an interchange of products for display 
and advertising purposes.In 1882 a motion was intro¬ 
duced requesting the Imperial government to take steps 
to secure a reciprocity arrangement with the Hawaiian 
Islands, but was withdrawn when Macdonald assured the 
House that the Government was already endeavoring to 
secure such an agreement.^ In 1883 Mr. Fortin of Gaspe, 
in a speech bristling with figures and statistics, 
detailed the situation respecting Canadian trad© with 
the West Indies, Mexico, and Brazil, and asked that 
the Government make any arrangement possible to increase 
trade with those countries. He was assured by Sir 
Leonard Tilley that "any arrangement which the Govern¬ 
ment will feel justified in making ... we shall have 
great pleasure in submitting, and asking Parliament to

sanction.” 1 In 1885 a motion asking for copies of 
correspondence relating to the establishment of trade 
between Canada and the Australian colonies was accepted,^ 
and in 1887 another motion urging attempts to increase 
trade between Canada and Prance also received the assent 
of the House . 7j Considerable discussion took place at 
various times regarding Canada*s inferior position In 
the negotiation of commercial agreements, and a motion 
in 1889 by the Liberal Sir Richard Cartwright asking 
that the British government be requested to grant Canada 
the right to negotiate her own commercial treaties, 
though negatived on a party division, received much 
favorable comment.^ One can at least conclude that 
although the Conservative government was committed to 
the support of its National Policy, it as well as the 
Opposition realized the desirability of taking any pos¬ 
sible steps to further Canadian trade. 

The old question of reciprocity with the United 
States was brought up at frequent intervals, but because 
of the ascendancy of the National Policy got no further 
than the discussion stage. In 1888 Sir Richard

Cartwright introduced a motion calling for "full and 
unrestricted reciprocity of trade”! with the United 
States* but after a debate of interminable length 
extending over many days the motion was defeated. 

Another matter which continually cropped up was 
the British Columbia-Alaska boundary line* which had 
not been clearly defined and which members realized 
might be the cause of difficulty when the time for 
accurate delimitation came. British Columbia members 
in particular were worried lest the interests of their 
province should be neglected when the final settlement 
should be made, and occasionally reminded the Government 
that the matter should be looked after with as much 
attention as possible. In 1879 Amor DeCosmos asked for 
copies of a large number of documents dealing with the 
matter, and the Government agreed that they should be 
brought down.^ In 1885 David Gordon of Vancouver Island 
moved for copies of all correspondence dealing with the 
appointment of a joint commission with the United States 
government to survey the boundary line, and Joshua Homer 
of New Westminster, in seconding the motion, stressed 
the danger of some event such as the discovery of

valuable minerals creating a situation which would be 
difficult to handle peaceably under the existing circum¬ 
stances. The request for the correspondence was granted, 
but Minister of Public Works Sir Hector Langevin, in 
replying to the motion, said that although he realized 
that a survey would eventually have to be made the 
absolute need had not yet appeared, and other matters 
appeared to be more urgent. David Mills of Bothweli 
commented that a survey would cost between three and 
four million dollars. 1 In 1889 Edgar Dewdney, Minister 
of the Interior at that time, was able to say that 
negotiations were in progress to arrange for a survey 
to be made,^ but in the following year was forced to 
admit that in spite of efforts on the part of the 
Canadian government to get the survey started, the 
American government had not yet shown a disposition to 
cooperate. He remarked blithely however that he expected 
little difficulty in settling the boundary line.^ 

The fisheries question was frequently brought 
up in the House after the United States had denounced 
the fisheries clauses of the Washington Treaty in 1885.

In 1887 Alfred Jones of Halifax remarked that he had 
noticed in the press that the Government had decided 
not to send out any more cruisers for the protection of 
the fisheries, and asked for further information. 
Macdonald said that he was not aware of any such decision 
Later in the same session the sum of $125,000 was 
appropriated for steamers and vessels for fishery pro¬ 
tection.*^ In 1888 after his return from Washington, 

Sir Charles Tupper gave the House a very thorough 
summary of the negotiations at Washington which had led 
to the Chamberlain-Bayard Treaty (not accepted by the 
American Senate,) but which had failed to secure a 
reciprocity agreement. His performance at Washington 
was severely criticized by Opposition members, notably 
Mr. Davies of Prince Edward Island, who however did not 
advise that the Canadian Parliament refuse to accept 
the treaty. 3 In the following year the Government’s 
policy respecting the fisheries was again roundly 
criticized by Wilfrid Laurier, who blamed it for the 
continuance of unfriendly relations between the two

countries, and advised that steps be taken to secure a 
friendly reciprocal agreement*^ 

A topic that aroused the curiosity of members on 
occasion was that of empire federation, which was being 
widely advocated by both the Imperial Federation League 
in Great Britain and by the subsidiary body in Canada* 

In 1885 the following conversation took place in the 
House of Commons: 

"Mr. Edgar enquired: Whether any correspondence 
has taken place between the High Commissioner in London 
and the Government on the subject of Imperial Federation, 
and whether the Government has received copies of the 
resolutions passed at the Conferences on Imperial Federa¬ 
tion held in London during the past year, or any communi¬ 
cations upon the subject of Imperial Federation from the 
Colonial Secretary, or from any organizations formed in 
London for the purpose of promoting that object? 

Mr. Chapleau: No correspondence has taken place 
between the Government and the High Commissioner, or the 
Colonial Secretary, or any organization, on the subject 
of Imperial Federation...* 

Mr. Edgar enquired: Whether it is the intention 
of the Government to submit for the consideration of the 
House during the present Session any proposals upon the 
subject of Federation of the Empire? 

Sir John A* Macdonald: It is not."2 

In 1886 Sir Richard Cartwright again brought up 
the subject of Imperial Federation, and quoted from a

speech of Sir John Macdonald’s at a convention in Toronto 
in 1881, which clearly revealed the Prime Minister’s 
attitude towards Imperial Federation. On this occasion 
Macdonald said: 

n We are told that we want an Imperial federation 
....I tell you Imperial federation is utterly impractic¬ 
able. We could never agree to send a number of men over 
to England to sit in Parliament there and vote away our 
rights and privileges. I am, as far as this question 
goes, up to the handle, a Home Ruler. We will govern 
our own country. We will put on the taxes ourselves. 

If we choose to misgovern ourselves, we will do so.... ff l 

On the same occasion Thomas White of Cardwell 
referred to another famous speech, that of Edward Blake 
at Aurora, in which he expressed his approval of the 
principles which Macdonald abhorred. 1 2 However there is 
no evidence that either leader was speaking for his 
party, or that there was a division along party lines 
on the principle of Imperial Federation. 

In 1887 James Edgar asked for copies of corres¬ 
pondence relative to the Imperial Conference which began 
in London on April 4, 1887, and of instructions which 
were furnished to the Canadian representatives. He 
expressed the fear that the British authorities were 
trying to establish a connection so close that the

Colonies would be dragged into Imperial wars, and hinted 
broadly that he suspected the Imperial Federation League 
of exerting a potent and undesirable influence in this 
direction. He concluded with the following words, 

r, We have no spare men to send away to assist in 
governing remote dependencies of the Empire, and what 
is more, I hope that we shall always try to exercise 
such powers of self-government as we possess and 
extend them as far as we can.” 1 

The above discussion is by no means a complete 
account of all of the debates which took place on the 
topics under discussion. Some of the debates, particu¬ 
larly those on reciprocity, trade relationships, and 
the fisheries, were extremely long, and it Is impossible 
to summarize them briefly. But perhaps enough has been 
said to bring out the general trend of opinion in Canada 
as it was expressed in the House of Commons. It is 
clear that as far as external relationships were con¬ 
cerned Canadians were interested primarily in such 
matters as' “ s external trade, her fisheries, her 
boundary problems, and her position as a close neighbor 
of the United States and as a unit of the British Empire 
It is also evident that there was a wide divergence of 
opinion on most major issues, often, although not always

along party lines* Finally, although interest in the 
larger problems of international relations appeared to 
be increasing, Canada was still too immature and 
isolationistic to feel any great concern except where 
she was involved in some situation which affected her 
directly*

CHAPTER IV 

BETWEEN MACDONALD AND LAURIER 1891-1896 


A. Canadian Affairs 1891-1896 

The decline of the Conservatives, already in 
evidence during Macdonald f s last years, was greatly 
accelerated after his death in 1891* There was no 
prominent leader present to replace him, and of sueh as 
were available, several were removed from the political 
scene by illness or death during the next few years. 

To make matters worse a multitude of misfortunes combined 
to harass the Conservatives and steadily weaken their 
position. 

Macdonald was succeeded as Prime Minister by 
Sir John Abbott, a lawyer and former annexationist who 
had been serving as Government leader in the Senate. 

He was a compromise choice, and though he was regarded 
only as a stop-gap he revealed during his brief span of 
office considerable tact and political ability. A 
deluge of charges of corruption in government administra¬ 
tion during Macdonald’s last years broke loose after 
Abbott became Prime Minister, and the session Q f 1891 
came to be known as the "Scandal Session”. The Conserva-

tives replied with similar charges of corruption against 
the Opposition, which were borne out by unsavoury 
revelations respecting the Liberal government of Honor© 
Mercier in Quebec, and when Abbott resigned owing to 
ill health after eighteen months it did not appear that 
the Conservatives had lost much ground. 

Abbott was succeeded in 1892 by Sir John 
Thompson, a man of great ability and integrity, who was 
handicapped by the fact that he was a Roman Catholic 
convert from Protestantism and consequently unpopular 
with the Orangemen of Ontario. However Mackenzie 
Bowell, himself an Orangeman, supported him loyally, 
and Thompson governed successfully for two years mainly 
by shelving important and troublesome domestic issues 
such as the rising question of separate schools in 
Manitoba. His chief accomplishment was in the field 
of foreign affairs, notably the settlement of the 
Bering Sea fur sealing dispute. His sudden death at 
Y/indsor Castle in 1894 was an unexpected and severe 
blow to the party. 

Mackenzie Bowell, a man of rather moderate 
ability, was chosen as the next Prime Minister largely 
as a concession to the Orangemen who had supported 
Thompson. He assumed office at a time when Conservative

troubles were multiplying rapidly, and his position was 
made much more insecure because his advisors provided 
him with only lukewarm support, and were themselves 
divided on vital issues. He endeavored to pass a 
remedial bill to restore the separate schools in 
Manitoba which the Provincial Legislature had abolished 
in 1890, but when seven of his ministers suddenly 
resigned, apparently in protest against his lack of 
leadership, he had no course but to resign himself* 

The Conservatives hastily summoned Sir Charles 
Tupper, who had been serving as Canadian High Commis- 
sioner in London, to attempt to stem the breach, but 
it was too late. Tupper still retained all his old 
perception and ability, if not his physical stamina, 
and commanded a great deal of respect in all sections 
of the country, but the cards were stacked against him. 
He was faced with an opponent of ability comparable to 
that of Macdonald himself in the figure of Wilfrid 
Laurier, who had been able to turn both the tariff 
issue and the separate schools question to Liberal 
advantage, and now, as the only outstanding French 
Canadian, commanded the suipport in Quebec which had 
formerly been given to Cartier, Macdonald, and 
Langevin. In the general elections of 1896 the Censer-

vatives were defeated in nearly every province in the 
Dominion except Manitoba, and the Liberals came to 
power for the first time in eighteen years, with a 
majority of over thirty, A new era in Canadian 
history had begun. 

B. The International Scene, 1891-1896 
This period witnessed a continuation of the for¬ 
mation of alliances in Europe and an increase of tension 
in international relationships. The fall of Bismarck 
hastened the collapse of the system he had built up so 
carefully, and with G-erman foreign policy in the hands 
of the rash young William II her voice in world affairs 
became less subtle and more bellicose. The failure to 
renew the Re-insurance Pact with Russia in 1890, and 
the renewal of the Triple Alliance with Italy and 
Austria in the following year, had the almost unavoid¬ 
able effect of causing Russia and France to draw closer 
together. Conversations were begun which resulted in a 
military agreement in 1892, and by the end of 1893 this 
had developed into a formal alliance designed mainly to 
protect the two nations from attack by the Triple 
Alliance. In 1892 Russia began to build the Trans- 
Siberian Railway with the aid of a large French loan.

French efforts to detach Italy from the Triple Alliance 
were countered by German attempts to win back the 
favour of Russia; the latter with such little success 
that by 1893 the German Reichstag could be persuaded 
to pass a new Army Bill introducing two years 1 compul¬ 
sory service and greatly strengthening the German 
military machine. 

At the same time Germany was becoming estranged 
from Great Britain. That nation had in the past relied 
upon her insular position of so-called !? splendid isola¬ 
tion 0 to keep herself free from continental entangle¬ 
ments , but with her world-wide commitments it was becom¬ 
ing increasingly difficult for her to continue doing 
this, and the other European powers wondered with 
increasing curiosity for whose side her "casting vote" 
would be given. British relations with both France and 
Russia were still clouded over various issues such as 
Egypt and Afghanistan, but Britain also looked on 
Germany»s new and vigorous colonial policy with increas¬ 
ing alarm. The opening of the Kiel Canal in 1895 and 
Germany’s avowed intention of building a large ocean¬ 
going navy also met with little favour in British eyes. 
British fear of German ambitions turned to open anger 
during the South African crisis in 1895-1896. The ill-

starred Jamison raid, which had probably met with as 
much disapproval in Britain as elsewhere, had aroused 
in Germany a great deal of sympathy for the Boers. 

When the Boers succeeded in repulsing the attack, the 
Kaiser was unwise enough to send a telegram of congratu¬ 
lation to President Kruger. British suspicions that the 
Kaiser was in secret and mischievous negotiations with 
the rebellious Boers were coupled with open anger that 
British predominance in South Africa should be questioned 
and there is no doubt that the incident had something 
to do with Britain’s final decision to support the Dual 
Alliance. Germany’s partners in the Triple Alliance 
both regretted the growing estrangement between Germany 
and Great Britain, both having good reasons for wanting 
British friendship, and Italy openly avowed that she did 
not want to become involved in a war which would make 
her long coast-line vulnerable to attacks from the 
British navy. 

In 1894 war broke out between the eastern powers, 
China and Japan, and the world watched in wonder as the 
newly westernized and industrialized Japan proceeded to 
inflict a speedy defeat on her gigantic but backward 
neighbour. Negotiations for peace were begun at 
Shimonoseki in March 1895, with the Japanese imposing

humiliating and crippling terms, but after Germany, 
Russia, and Prance had intervened Japan was forced to 
modify her demands, and the peace was finally signed 
by the Chinese Emperor on May 8. Germany after a show 
of friendship had led in compelling the Japanese to 
renounce their victory, and had won such a degree of 
enmity from that nation that the event led to the 
Japanese entry into the First World War against her. 
Great Eritain on the other hand had remained aloof, and 
had won a measure of Japanese gratitude. Germany*s 
attempts to win Russian favour by supporting her in the 
Far East had no permanent effect, and thus while failing 
to win the friendship of that nation she had drawn 
further away from Britain and alienated the Japanese. 

It was evident that the hand of the master was missing. 

C. Canadian External Relationships, 1891-1896 
The Bering Sea Fur Sealing Controversy 

The most important international event which 
directly concerned Canada was the negotiation of a 
settlement of the dispute with the United States over 
fur sealing in the Bering Sea.

The American government had become interested 
in the seal fisheries of the Bering Sea after the pur¬ 
chase of Alaska from Russia in 1867, and followed the 
policy of restricting seal hunting, not only by foreign¬ 
ers, but by Americans also. The Canadian government 
protested that the United States was trying to monopol¬ 
ize the industry, and when Canadian fishermen attempted 
to continue their activities a number of their boats 
were seized and confiscated, particularly after 1886* 

In 1892 it was finally agreed to hold a conference to 
arbitrate the matter, and in the following year the 
tribunal met in Paris. Sir John Thompson was one of 
the two British Empire delegates, and the rest of the 
tribunal was made up of two members from the United 
States and one each from prance, Italy, and Sweden. 

The award was favorable to Canada from a legal 
standpoint, as it was decided, contrary to American 
claims, that the Bering Sea was to be considered part 
of the Pacific Ocean and that American property rights 
to seals did not extend beyond the three mile limit. 
Canada was also given a cash award as compensation for 
the American seizure of her vessels. However the United 
States was also essentially satisfied with the award, as 
it upheld her desire to limit both the extent and the

manner of the seal fishing industry. A closed season 
was declared for part of each year, and the use of nets, 
steamers, explosives and guns was forbidden altogether. 

The award is usually considered to have been 
Eminently fair, but unfortunately its provisions were 
not observed, and in 1911 it became necessary to consider 
the question all over again. Probably the most satis- 
factory aspect from Canada*s viewpoint was the prominent 
part taken by Sir John Thompson in the discussions, and 
his defense of Canadian rights. As Canada»s representa¬ 
tive at the Intercolonial Conference in Ottawa in 1893, 
and at a later conference in London in 1894, respecting 
merchant shipping, he again took a leading role, and 
appeared as the champion of Canadian autonomy. It was 
in the field of foreign and imperial relations that Sir 
John Thompson made his greatest contribution to 
Canadian development. 

The Commercial Treaty With France (1893) 

In 1893 a trade treaty was signed with Prance, 
noteworthy because it was the first important one to be 
negotiated between Canada and a European country other 
than Britain, and also because a Canadian had the most 
important part in its achievement. Sir Charles Tupper,

the High Commissioner in London, undertook to negotiate 
a treaty which would rectify the trade situation 
between the two countries - a situation so lop-sided 
that Prance’s exports to Canada outweighed her imports 
by ten to one* With the help of the British Ambassador 
at Paris, Lord Dufferin, and after considerable haggling 
with the French officials, an agreement was finally 
reached, which gave certain specified exports of each 
country most-favoured-nation treatment in the other. 
Tupper had kept in constant touch with the Canadian 
government throughout the negotiations, and had tried 
conscientiously to follow its directions. He was hurt 
and disappointed, therefore, when many of his colleagues 
criticized the treaty and were openly reluctant to 
ratify it in Parliament. It had in fact rather a rough 
road to travel in the Canadian House of Commons before 
it was passed, but it was finally ratified in 1895. 

Other agreements reached at about the same time 
between Great Britain and Spain gave Canada concessions 
in trade with the latter country and the West Indies. 
Canada had little part in these latter arrangements, but 
was glad to accept them, as they gave her cheaper access 
to a large number of tropical and semi-tropical products.

D, Hansard and Canadian External Relationship 3 , 1891-1896 

As was suggested previously, Tupper f s commercial 
treaty with Prancewas severely criticised in the House, 
and even the Government appeared to be in doubt as to 
whether to ratify it. In March 1893 James Lister of 
West Lambton riding brought up the subject, reading an 
article from the Montreal Star which expressed surprise 
that the Hon. G.E. Foster, Minister of Finance, should 
have stated in the Commons that he would not ask the 
House to ratify the French treaty that session,,as there 
were features of the treaty with which the Government 
was not satisfied. The article further stated that 
the Government should not withhold consent to the Treaty, 
because it had been negotiated with their full knowledge 
and approval, and in accordance with their wishes. 

Mr. Foster in reply said that he considered that 
if a treaty was to be ratified by Parliament then the 
representatives of the people should have a full oppor¬ 
tunity to consider it. David Mills of Bothwell concurred 
in this view and also criticized the terms of the treaty, 
saying in part: 1

"When that treaty provides that it shall not 
come into operation without the sanction of this House, 
the sanction of this House is not be be regarded as a 
mere formal matter but as a matter of substance. I 
cannot understand how a gentleman of the intelligence 
and ability of Sir Charles Tupper could have for one 
moment entertained such one-sided propositions as those 
embraced in this treaty - a treaty to some extent in 
the interests of Prance, so far as it goes, but to no 
extent whatever in the interests of this country.” 

Since Mills was a Liberal, and Poster a Conservative, 

it is evident that there was opposition to the Treaty 

from both sides of the House. 

Lister continued by censuring the Government 
for not supporting a treaty which had apparently been 
framed according to its instructions, and William 0*Brien 
of Muskoka took the same view -- 

"If it is true that the first intimation which 
the authorities at home and Sir Charles Tupper had of 
any objection on the part of the Government to this 
treaty, was the statement made by the Minister of 
Finance the other evening, we cannot be surprised that 
Sir Charles Tupper felt a good deal of annoyance. 

Other opinions were expressed pro and con in 
this and later discussions, and it is evident that while 
some held that the Government should endorse a treaty 
negotiated under their direction, others took the view 
that in a case like this Parliament should examine the 


1 Debates, House of Commons, 1895, p.2477 









100 


treaty thoroughly before making up its mind, particularly 
when the terms appeared to be disadvantageous to Canada. 
Some Conservatives as well as Liberals held this latter 
view. 


The old question of Imperial Federation was 
still brought up occasionally, and in 1891 Guillaume 
Amyot of Bellechasse asked, 

"Is the High Commissioner for Canada at London 
authorized by the Government to promote Imperial Federa¬ 
tion. ...? Are the Government of Canada in favour of the 
establishment of Imperial federation? Have the Govern¬ 
ment a fixed policy as to the establishment of an 
Imperial federation....?"^ 

Sir Hector Langevin said in reply, 

"In answer to the Hon. gentleman I may say, to 
the first question, that the High Commissioner has no 
authority from the Government. The Government have not 
considered the subjects mentioned in the remaining 
questions.' 

In connection with Canada’s Imperial 
relationships, and perhaps stimulated by her growing 
trade connections, a motion introduced by the Liberal 
Mills of Bothwell in 1892 is worthy of note. He asked 
the House to declare that

**the time has come when commercial treaties, in the 
interests of Canada ; should be negotiated by persons who 
are responsible to the Government of Canada and for 
whose acts the advisers of the Crown in Canada should 
be held responsible to the House of Commons.”^ 

However after debate the motion was defeated on a party 

division, by a Conservative majority of 106 to 62. 

In 1892 a motion introduced by Dalton McCarthy 
of North Simcoe was passed, which in its amended form 
read as follows, 

”That it is expedient that communication be opened with 
Her Majesty 1 s Government in order to bring about such 
fuller- representation of Canadian interests at Washington 
and at the Capitols of other countries in which such 
representation may be found desirable as may be consis¬ 
tent with the proper relations which should exist betv/een 
Great Britain and Canada.” 

In the following session he asked the Minister of 
Finance to state the result of the ensuing communication 
to England. Foster replied in part, 

”Sir John Abbott and myself, when in London had several 
conferences with the Colonial and Foreign Offices.... 

My impression as a result of these conversations is 
that serious difficulties appear to be in the way of 
Canada having representatives at foreign capitoi* with 
ambassadorial or ministerial functions.... My impression, 
also, is that the Foreign Office and the Government will 
be willing to facilitate in any way a full representation 
of Canada*s interest, through their Minister, at any of 
these capitols....” 2

The short discussion is revealing in that it 
shows both Canada’s increasing desire for more diploma¬ 
tic and commercial independence and Britain’s reluctance 
to grant these to her* 

The House was strangely silent during the 

arbitration of the Bering Sea fur sealing controversy, 

and not a great deal was said about it afterwards, 

except that complaints were voiced occasionally over 

the fact that the United States had delayed paying the 

money compensation which the tribunal had awarded 

Canada* In 1896 Sir Richard Cartwright remarked, 

n To the best of my recollection, about ten years have 
elapsed since Canadian vessels were seized on the high 
seas, hundreds of miles distant from shore, and 
Canadian seamen were thrown into prison; and up to the 
present time not one copper of damages has been paid 
to us* I think we ought to know exactly what position 
these matters are in.*.* H 

John Costigan, Minister of Marine and Fisheries 


replied, 

"I may say that a convention to arrange the terms upon 
which commissioners should act to settle these claims 
has just been terminated.... f! 

It may be assumed that the reason the House did 

not have more to say about the award was chiefly that 

it was reasonably well satisfied with the decision.

Besides the subjects dealt with above, there 
were occasional references to matters dealt with previous¬ 
ly, for example reciprocity with the United States,^- 
Home Buie for Ireland,2 and Chinese immigration.^ 
Regarding the last-mentioned subject, a Bill was passed 
in 1892 to regulate and restrict Chinese immigration 
still further, and during the discussion David Gordon of 
Vancouver Island read a long list of petitions from all 
parts of the country asking that Chinese immigration 
into Canada be prohibited. 4 It appears that public 
opinion was rising in favour of increased restriction 

of immigration from China, probably because the need 

/ 

for it,, to help build the Canadian Pacific Railway, had 
disappeared. 

In summary, it is difficult to assess accurately 
the trends of opinion on world affairs in the House of 
Commons during this period. Changes of leadership were 
so frequent, and party strife was so keen, and at the 
same time so involved, that one can. hardly Identify any 
consistent or recognizable policy in foreign affairs.

The weakening position of the Conservative party, and 
its resulting disunity, effectively prevented it from 
following any steady foreign policy, and the pressure 
of domestic affairs, with the increasing tempo of the 
struggle for power as the elections of 1896 approached, 
caused both parties to concentrate on internal rather 
than external affairs.

CHAPTER V 

THE ADMINISTRATION OP SIR WILFRID LAURIER, 
PART I (1896-1904) 


A» Canadian Affairs 1898-1904 
Wilfrid Laurier at his accession to power had t© 
settle two delicate and pressing problems — separate 
schools and tariffs — which had wrecked the Conserva¬ 
tive machine and still threatened to cause trouble in 
the future. His handling of the separate schools dis¬ 
pute with the Manitoba provincial government showed 
courage and firmness as well as political astuteness. 
Refusing to yield to the threats of the Roman Catholic 
hierarchy in Quebec, and standing by his pre-election 
promise to avoid coercion, he arranged a compromise 
settlement between federal and provincial authorities 
which gave a good measure of satisfaction to both. A 
voluntary amendment of Manitoba law by the provincial 
legislature provided for denominational religious instruc¬ 
tion when requested by a specified number of parents, 
and for bilingual teaching when ten or more pupils in a 
school spoke a language other than English. To the 
Indignation of the Quebec bishops no attempt was made

106 


by the federal government to restore separate schools 
forcibly, and their violent opposition to Laurier con¬ 
tinued until a mild rebuke from Rome advised them to 
moderate their attitude* 

The tariff question was not so difficult to settle 
Many protectionist voters had supported the Liberals in 
the elections of 1896, and for this reason and others 
Laurier decided not to reduce tariffs drastically* A 
tariff commission was appointed to hear evidence and 
prepare information, with the result that although 
necessary revisions in the tariff were made no drastic 
reductions took place, and the National Policy was in 
the main left undisturbed. The most noticeable change 
was in the lowering of duties on British imports, a 
process that came to be known as Imperial Preference, 
and was received very favourably in Great Britain. 

Laurier ! s decision to retain the National Policy was 
all the more acceptable to Canadians since the United 
States had recently enacted the Dingley Tariff, highest 
since the Civil War. Even pronounced free-traders were 
not enthusiastic about granting low tariffs to the 
United States, as it would obviously be a one-sided 
concession*

Laurier*s great talents and rising popularity 
were enhanced by the fact that he was able to gather 
around him a group of advisers usually rated as one of 
the most outstanding in Canadian parliamentary history. 
It is often referred to as the "Ministry of all the 
talents”, and included not only five former Provincial 
premiers, W.S. Fielding of Nova Scotia, A.G. Blair of 
New Brunswick, L.H. Davies of Prince Edward Island, de 
Lotbiniere of Quebec, and Sir Oliver Mowat of Ontario, 
but also men of such outstanding ability as Clifford 
Sifton, Israel Tarte, and Sir Richard Cartwright. With 
this assortment of talent Laurier proceeded to give 
Canada a more beneficial and positive type of government 
than it had known since the best days of Sir John A. 
Macdonald. 

Laurier was astute enough to refrain from becom¬ 
ing submerged in a burdensome government department, 
and, taking only the Presidency of the Council, retained 
freedom to devote his time to larger issues. His task 
was made easier by a return to Canada of prosperity, 
which coincided with a period of expanding industry and 
brade throughout the world. Industrialization was pro¬ 
ceeding apace in Europe, Japan, and the United States, 
und raw materials such as Canada could produce were 







108 


required in steadily increasing quantities. The westward 
march of the settler in the United States had reached its 
limits, and the supply of available land there was becom¬ 
ing exhausted. This meant that Canada’s prairie land 
was the only large fertile area on the Korth American 
continent that remained to be settled, and foreign 
interest in the Canadian West reached new heights. Gold 
discoveries in British Columbia and the Yukon also helped 
to focus attention on Canada as a source of precious 
metals. Under these circumstances it is little wonder 
that Canada shared in the general prosperity, and that a 
period of boom set in. The Liberals at first reaped the 
full benefit of these abnormal conditions. 

The outstanding internal development during 
Laurier’s regime was in the settlement of the Great West. 
Clifford Sifton was appointed Minister of the Interior 
late in 1896, and under him a vigorous immigration policy 
was instituted which soon gave telling results. Wide¬ 
spread advertising in both the United States and Europe, 
easy regulations for homesteading, an efficient immigra¬ 
tion service, and numerous devices for assisting new 
settlers and improving agriculture were all employed, 
with the result that immigration increased by leaps and 
sounds. The yearly influx of settlers from the United

States increased from 2500 in 1897 to over 60,000 in 
1907, and continued to reach even higher totals in the 
years that followed, while total immigration from all 
countries had by 1911 reached the staggering total of # 
over 500,000 annually. In the same year wheat produc¬ 
tion in the Canadian West, which in 1900 had amounted to 
only 25,000,000 bushels, had jumped to a total of nearly 
200,000,000 bushels. All things considered, there are 
strong grounds for maintaining that the greatest contri¬ 
butions of the Laurier government to Canadian welfare 
are to be found in its intelligent and aggressive immi¬ 
gration policy, and in its assistance to agriculture. 

The opening of the West, the successful immigra¬ 
tion policy, and the expansion of industry and agricul¬ 
ture, all urged upon the Government the need for expanded 
railway facilities. To meet this need railways were 
constructed at a rapid rate, indeed to such an extent 
that Canada T s needs at that time were greatly exceeded* 

It soon became obvious that Laurier had gone too far, 
and had permitted so many railways to be built, that not 
only was Canada burdened with a large debt from railway 
construction, but was also saddled with a number of lines 
which did not pay the operating expenses. The Government 
co-operated with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company

In the construction of a second trans-continental rail¬ 
way, by building the section between Moncton and Winnipeg, 
while the company took the responsibility for the part 
between Winnipeg and Prince Rupert* After great finan¬ 
cial difficulties the line was finally completed in 
1915* Meanwhile the Canadian Northern, which had 
refused to participate in this scheme, continued to 
borrow and build privately until it had a line from 
Quebec to Vancouver, Laurier ! s lack of business acumen 
was nowhere more clearly shown than in his failure to 
bring the Grand Trunk Pacific and the Ganadian Northern 
together, or to realize that three transcontinental 
railways were far in excess of Canada f s needs at that 
time. Eventually the Government had to take over both 
railways, and it took the congested traffic of the Second 
World War to put the resulting Canadian National system 
on a paying basis* 

B* The International Scene, 1896-1904 

These years at the turn of the century were marked 
by the formation of more alliances and by increasing 
participation in world affairs of the United States and 
Japan. Great Britain, who still stood alone in 1895, 
became increasingly conscious of her isolated position

in the years that followed, and, abandoning her tradi¬ 
tional policy of ”splendid isolation”, began to search 
for allies, 

A number of events after 1895 combined to impress 
on British authorities the loneliness of their position 
in European diplomacy, and the need for reaching an 
understanding with other powers. In 1897 Admiral Tirpitz 
became Minister for Naval Affairs in Germany, and shortly 
afterwards the first German naval program was announced, 
becoming effective in the following year. It was follow¬ 
ed by another and still more ambitious Navy Bill in 1900, 
and Britons with reason suspected that the Germans 
intended to build a fleet capable of challenging their 
own. In November 1897 Germany took the fine naval base 
of Kiao-Chau from China, and Russia followed suit in 
1898 by seizing the warm water port of Port Arthur. 

Britain was decidedly hostile to both acquisitions, 
and by way of compensation took the rather inferior 
prize of Wei-Hai-Wei. At the same time Prance acquired 
Kwangschouan. In 1900 the Boxer rebellion broke out in 
China, and was forcibly suppressed, mainly by an inter¬ 
national force from various European powers. Great 
Britain made use of the occasion to attempt to come to 
an understanding with Germany, with the prevention of

Russian pressure on North China as the main object in 
view, but the attempt failed, as had an earlier one in 
1898. In 1898 British relations with Prance were 
embittered by the Pashoda crisis, when a body of troops 
under Sir Herbert Kitchener, having just broken the 
Khalifa 1 s resistance in the Sudan and captured Khartum, 
met a small force of Prench soldiers under Captain 
Marchand at Pashoda. Marchand refused to vacate his 
position but after the dispute had been referred to the 
Home Governments it became obvious that the Prench could 
not maintain their hold on Pashoda, and Marchand had to 
withdraw. War had been narrowly averted, and the 
Dreyfus affair, which occurred about the same time, did 
nothing to improve relations between the two countries. 
Finally, in the Boer War of 1899-1902 Great Britain had 
public opinion throughout Europe arrayed against her. 

The rebellion of the Boers was put down, with the aid 
of small contingents from the overseas dominions, after 
an intense struggle, but the British were everywhere 
regarded as the oppressors of a freedom-loving people, 
and there had been talk of intervention by Russia, 
Germany, and Prance in favour of the Boers. 

Consequently Great Britain ! s first alliance was 
greeted with applause at home. It was with Japan, and

was arranged by Lord Lansdowne In 1902 — an epoch- 
making treaty because it was the first one negotiated 
between a European and a Far-Eastern power. It was 
followed soon by an entente with France, It was 
obvious by 1901 that there was no chance of a British- 
German alliance, and as a result any union of Great 
Britain with the Triple Alliance was also out of the 
question, Britain and France had recently been drawing 
closer together owing largely to the appointment of 
Delcasse, who was friendly to England, to the French 
Foreign Ministry in 1898, The main grounds for disagree¬ 
ment were overcome when France promised Britain a free 
hand in Egypt in return for a similar concession in 
Morocco, and other problems soon fell into line or were 
overlooked. The Anglo-French entente dated from April 
1904, and it was obvious that Great Britain’s casting 
vote had been given to France rather than to the Triple 
Alliance® 

For the alienation of Britain Germany had only 
herself to blame. The vacillating policy of Holstein, 
who alternately courted and rebuffed British diplomats, 
the blustering speeches and tactless actions of the 
Kaiser, and the over-ambitious naval policy of Tirpitz, 
all had the effect of arousing British anger and suspicion.

and after 1900 British-German relations became steadily 
more clouded. German ambitions in the Near and Middle 
East led to the acquisition of the Bagdad Concession in 
1903, and the initiation of plans to build a German 
railway right from Berlin to Bagdad and the Persian 
Gulf. Britain not only refused to join in the scheme 
but opposed it bitterly, and after 1903 Turkey was to 
be found in the orbit of the Central Powers. The Triple 
Alliance was re-affirmed in 1902, but the edge of this 
achievement was taken off by Delcasse*s Reconciliation 
Pact with Italy in 1902, declaring that as far as Italy 
was concerned the Triple Alliance was not directed 
against Prance. In the following year Delcasse secured 
a secret Neutrality Agreement with Italy, who was now 
no longer bound by the Triple Alliance to fight either 
Prance or Britain. 

The United States found herself being increasing¬ 
ly drawn into the current of world affairs, mainly as a 
result of her desire to preserve the Americas from 
European interference. President Cleveland stepped into 
the British Guiana-Venezuela boundary dispute in 1895, 
reaffirming the Monroe Doctrine and threatening that any 
use of force by Great Britain might lead to war with the 
United States. In 1898 the Spanish-American War broke

out, and with the speedy defeat of Spain European powers 
were compelled to deliberate over the appearance of a 
new major power on the western side of the Atlantic# 

In 1905 Venezuela was again aided by an American presi¬ 
dent, when Theodore Roosevelt threatened to send an 
American fleet to the Caribbean and by so doing compelled 
Great Britain, Italy, and Germany to moderate their 
demands upon that nation. 

An attempt to relieve the international tension 
was made in 1899, largely at the Instigation of the 
Russian Czar, when the first International Peace Confer¬ 
ence was held, at the Hague. Its purpose was to arrange 
for disarmament and for the regulation of international 
conduct and relationships, but it was a failure, owing 
mainly to distrust of the Czar ! s motives by the other 
P ower s.

culmination of many disagreements of long standing,

which had quickened after the discovery of gold in the 
Transvaal in 1885 had begun to lure great numbers of 
fortune seekers into the country® The brave and ierase- 
ious resistance of the Boers surprised the whole world, 
and it was only after three years of bitter struggle 
that the British were able to subdue their sturdy back- 
veld adversaries. Enemies of Britain, openly desired to 
see the Boers victorious, and liberals everywhere watched 
their struggle with sympathy. 

The Boer War posed an especially difficult 
problem for Laurier and his government. Not only was 
there a divergence of views between the Canadian and 
the Imperial governments, but also a clear-cut difference 
of opinion within Canada. As far as the Imperial govern¬ 
ment was concerned, Laurier took his usual stand that 
when Britain was at war Canada as part of the empire 
was automatically at war also, but insisted that the 
extent of Canadian participation, if any, was a matter 
for the Canadian parliament to decide. This attitude 
/ was highly disappointing to such arch-Imperialists as 
Joseph Chamberlain, who wanted all-out Empire partici¬ 
pation, but failed to understand the delicate situation 
facing Laurier at home. 






117 


In Canada Laurier was urged with growing insist¬ 
ence by English-speaking Canadians to give immediate, 
official, and extensive aid to Britain, On the other 
hand French-speaking Canada, true to Its isolationist 
traditions, insisted that Canada should not involve 
herself in a war with which she was not directly con¬ 
cerned, and demanded that no help be given. Faced with 
a threatened cleavage, Laurier saw that a compromise 
was the only solution offering any possibility of 
success. The French Canadians would have to accept the 
sending of some Canadian troops, while the English 
Canadians would have to be content with a comparatively 
small contribution. So Laurier announced that the 
Canadian government would equip and transport up to 
1000 troops, who would thereafter be paid and maintained 
by the British government, but that Canada would neither 
send an official contingent nor allow this contribution 
to become a precedent. When Britain suffered serious 
setbacks during the !, Black Week" of December 1899 a 
second contingent was equipped and dispatched, and 
before the war was over more than 7000 Canadians had 
taken part, of whom about 2500 were recruited and equipped 
by the Canadian government. Of the rest most were raised 
either by the British government or privately by Lord 
Strathcona 0

There were some interesting consequences to 
Laurier»s decision,* The Canadian soldiers, few in 
numbers though they were, served with great distinction, 
and effectually banished the jibes that they were of 
poor fighting calibre and inferior to British troops® 

A battalion of Canadian soldiers in 1900 released the 
British garrison at Halifax for service elsewhere, and 
with their departure the policy of keeping Imperial 
troops in Canada was ended. Henri Bourassa, one of 
Laurier*s ablest lieutenants, broke with him in dis¬ 
approval of his policy of even moderate assistance, 
and eventually gathered around him enough support from 
the ranks of the French-Canadian Liberals to seriously

and the question of military support for Great Britain, 
representing him as “imperialistic” in Quebec and “dis¬

Laurier was returned with an increased majority, and as 
Tupper had suffered a personal defeat in his own con¬ 
stituency, he resigned from the active leadership of 
the Conservative party in favour of Robert Borden. 

Parliament sat from. March 16 to August 11 in 
1899, and consequently was not in session when war broke 
out. As a result Laurier f s decision had to be mad© with-

out reference to parliament, by order-in-council, and 

it is likely that he spent many anxious moments before 

making up his mind what course to take* 

However the outbreak of war was not altogether 

unexpected* On July 15 Sam Hughes, the militarily 

inclined member for North Victoria, Ontario, drew 

attention to a newspaper article reporting that the 

colony of Queensland had offered the Mother Country 

250 men in case of trouble with the Transvaal, and said, 

n I take this opportunity of again pressing upon the 
Canadian Government the necessity of our taking some 
action in the premises, also to fulfil our part as 
the senior colony of all the British colonies® I 
know it for a positive fact that there would be no 
trouble in enrolling, not merely 250 men, but, if 
necessary, thousands of men in Canada to go to the 
assistance of the mother land in a war with the 
Transvaal, where more than in any other part of 
the world, the necessity arises to vindicate the 
honor of the old flag. 

Laurier replied that he hoped there would be no 
need of such action, and that the difficulties might be 
settled peaceably. Sir Charles Tupper echoed the Prime 
Minister’s sentiments, but added that he thought the 
best way to avoid hostilities would be for all colonies 
to declare themselves unequivocally in support of the 
Mother Country.

On July 31 of the same year Latirier introduced 

a resolution expressing regret that British subjects 

were being ill-treated in the Transvaal and support of 

the Imperial authorities* attempts to restore justice, 

Tupper was not present that day, but had expressed approval 

of the motion in a letter which Sir Wilfrid read to the 

House, All members who spoke declared their hearty 

approval of the motion, and A, McNeill of North Bruce 

quoted an impartial witness” who said 

"British subjects in the Transvaal are denied all 
rights of citizenship, they are insulted,plundered, 
even murdered by their oppressors.• Their humble 
petitions have been openly flouted, although they 
were signed by 38,000 law-abiding petitioners in 
1894". 1 

The motion was agreed to, all the members of 
the House rising to their feet and singing the National 
Anthem. 

When the Hotise met for the next session, in 
February 1900, the Boer War was in full swing, and two 
Canadian contingents had already arrived in South Africa. 
The participation of Canadian troops in a major war on 
far-away battlefields for the first time had a great

effeet on the House of Commons, and the war was perhaps 
the leading topic for discussion in this and the follow¬ 
ing session. All aspects of the situation were discussed 
in detail, casualty lists were read, the quality of 
supplies criticized, the rates of soldiers pay analyzed, 
and a bill providing a sum of $2,000,000 for the 
expenses of the Canadian volunteers was passed. Many 
long speeches were made, filled with high sounding 
affirmations of loyalty to Great Britain, and members 
appeared to vie with one another in extolling the glory 
of the British Empire and protesting the justice of the 
British cause. There appeared to be no exceptions to 
the general attitude of loyalty to British institutions 
and the British connection, but some members, particu¬ 
larly French Canadian^ were not enthusiastic about 
Canadian, participation in the war. On the other hand 
many others, particularly Conservatives, led by Sir 
Charles Tupper, castigated the government on the grounds 
that its action was dilatory and inadequate. In the 
debate on the reply to the Speech from the Throne, 

Tupper concluded his speech with the following remarks.

"Even if my right hon. friend (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
had not the resolution of the House of Commons and 
of the Senate of Canada, - and under circumstances 
where delay might be irreparable - he must have 
known what the public sentiment was, and he knew he 
had a perfect right, according to the British par¬ 
liamentary practice in force in Canada, to take 
from the public treasury what money was necessary 
to meet the unexpected conditions that had arisen, 
and to ask parliament to sustain his action after¬ 
wards. ••• I believe. Sir, that it is the gravest 
emergency that has ever presented itself to the 
British Empire, and for that reason I have confined 
my remarks exclusively to it, postponing the con¬ 
sideration of other questions until the government 
is pleased to submit their measures to the House..,. 

I trust that the government will to the fullest extent 
meet this great patriotic upheaval of public senti¬ 
ment throughout the Dominion of Canada, and leave 
nothing undone which will tend to reflect the high¬ 
est honour on Canada, as a part of the great British 
Empire to which we are so proud to belong."^ 

In his reply Laurier attempted to justify the 
small delay which had taken place and to prove that 
Tupper himself had expressed the view on previous occas¬ 
ions that Canada should not have to take part in the 
secondary wars of Great Britain. He said in part, 

!, I do not see that any man can properly find fault 
with us for having weighed and reflected before we 
came to a conclusion. It was due to the country 
at large, whose interests were entrusted to our 
hands, that we should not move hastily, but only 
after due consideration.,., This is a constitution¬ 
ally governed country; this is a government of the 
people for the people.... And the hon, gentleman

knows very well that there Is only one way, under 
constitutional government, by which the people can 
speak, and that is by the voice of their represen¬ 
tatives in parliament assembled,,.. I repeat that 
unless we had a strong mandate behind us of public 
opinion, it would have been criminal in us to 
plunge our hands into the public treasury, however 
worthy the motive might have been..,. 

.♦..There are many Canadians who are not ready 
to take part in the secondary wars of England or to 
contribute to the defense of the empire in any part 
of it. Amongst the men who have taken that view, 
amongst those who have stated, time and time again, 
that it would not be fit for Canada to take part In 
the secondary wars of England or to contribute to 
the defense of the empire at large, one of the most, 
if not the most eminentjis my hon. friend who leads 
the opposition."^ 

The defection of Henri Eourassa from the Liberal 
ranks was followed by a resolution, which he introduced 
into the House in the session of 1901, and which read in 
part as follows, 

"Whilst strictly adhering to the fundamental prin¬ 
ciple of Canadian autonomy, and refusing to admit 
that the intervention of Canada in South Africa has 
committed this country to any future participation 
in the wars and policy of Great Britain,.... This 
House... declares that there is no necessity for 
sending any more Canadian troops to South Africa, 
and that the enlistment of recruits for the South 
African constabulary should not be allowed to take 
place in Canada."^ 

Laurier himself led in refuting the arguments of 
his former colleague, and spoke as follows.

"Well remembering the uncompromising hostility which 
my hon. friend showed to our policy, nearly two 
years ago, of sending contingents to South Africa,... 

I must say I was little prepared for the present 
attitude of my hon, friend* I would have supposed 
that he would be a stalwart to the end, and tha^, 
having refused to send troops to South Africa he 
would not ask us to send advice to England. But 
my hon. friend has taken an attitude altogether 
different from that. He would not allow us to 
offer troops! he now wants to send advice. He 
would not fight for the cause of England, but he 
is willing to sit at the council board in dis¬ 
cussing the cause of England to-day. 11 ^- 

Laurier stressed that since the war was approach 
ing its end Bourassa f s resolution was essentially irrele 
vant, and said that the important thing was whether or 
not the motion should be accepted, in view of Bourassa f s 
well-known views. All members joined in opposition to 
Bourassa’s motion, irrespective of party, and it was 
rejected by the overwhelming majority of 144 to 3, The 
only members who supported the motion were C. Angers of 
Charlevoix, Dominique Monet of Laprairie and Napierville 
and of course Bourassa himself.^

The Settlement of the Alaska Boundary Dispute (1905) 

The purchase of Alaska from Russia by the United 
States in 1867 effectively removed Russian interest and 
influence in North American affairs, but it emphasized 
again the importance to Canada of her relationship with 
the United States. In the indefiniteness of the terms 
of the British treaty with Russia In 1825, inherited by 
the United States, lay possibilities of future trouble. 
Several suggestions were made to fix the boundary of 
Alaska and British North America, but nothing was done 
until the discovery of gold in the Yukon in 1897 made it 
imperative to come to some agreement. 

In 1898 a Joint High Commission was appointed, 
to settle a number of questions of mutual interest to 
both Canada and the United States, including the 
Atlantic fisheries and the Alaska boundary. The Comis¬ 
sion succeeded in forming new regulations for the Bering 
Sea and Great Lakes fisheries, and in settling certain 
other matters, but disbanded without reaching any agree¬ 
ment on the Alaskan boundary Issue. 

At length, after various suggestions had been 
put forward and rejected, in 1903 Great Britain and the 
United States finally agreed that a tribunal composed of 
three "impartial jurists of repute" from each side should

determine the meaning of the treaty of 1825* The tri¬ 
bunal met in London during September and October of 1903* 
It was composed of Lord Alverstone, Lord Chief Justice of 
England, A.B. Aylesworth, a Toronto lawyer, and Sir 
Louis Jette, Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, representing 
the British Empire, and, for the United States, Senator 
Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, Senator George 
Turner of Washington, and Elihu Root, a member of the 
Roosevelt cabinet* Canadians complained bitterly that 
the Americans had violated the terms of the agreement 
in appointing active politicians rather than "impartial 
jurists of repute", and as both Lodge and Turner had 
previously expressed strong opinions favouring the 
American claim the Canadian accusation appears to have 
been well founded. 

The decisions of the tribunal, made public on 
October 20, 1903, fulfilled Canada f s worst fears, as by 
a majority decision of four to two the claims of the 
United States were essentially upheld, and Canada 
received no salt water outlet In the Alaskan Panhandle* 
Both Jette and Aylesworth refused to sign the award, and 
Alverstone was widely accused in both Canada and Great 
Britain of sacrificing Canadian and Empire interests to 
the Americans* The American case was undoubtedly the

stronger, however, and it is probable that without British 
help Canada could not have obtained a more favorable 
settlement* The most regrettable features about the 
whole affair were not the substance of the decision, 
which was essentially quite fair, but the methods by 
which it was reached, and the unreasonable and aggressive 
attitude of President Roosevelt, the more unjustifiable 
because an impartial and neutral board of judges would 
probably have awarded the decision to the United States 
on the basis of merit alone* The separation of four 
islands in the Portland Channel, so as to give two to 
Canada and two to the United States, may perhaps have 
been a suitable compromise, but as Keenleyside points 
> out, ’’casts doubt upon the judicial quality of the whole 
award. The decline in the Yukon 1 s gold mining industry 
which followed made the decision appear less important, 
but if the Yukon should ever become active again the 
lack of a salt water outlet in Canadian territory would 
be keenly felt. 

The Alaskan boundary was frequently referred to 
in the House, in a manner which indicated the concern the

members felt over the outcome of the dispute. In 1897 

Sir Charles Tupper asked that information in the hands of 

the Department of Interior be made available, and the 

minister of that department, Clifford Sifton, willingly 

consented to do so, and at the same time acknowledged 

the importance of the question, saying, 

“The hon. gentleman (Sir Charles Tupper) is undoubtedly 
correct in his estimate of the importance of the ques¬ 
tion. The difference between the boundary line as 
* claimed by the British authorities, and the boundary 
line as claimed by the United States authorities is 
very considerable, and the value of the territory 
which may be said to be practically in dispute, in 
view of the mineral discoveries in that region is, 
of course, very great. ,f ^ 

The matter was referred to frequently during the 
succeeding sessions, and in 1903, the year of the award, 
formed a leading topic of discussion. The news of the 
decision came out shortly before Parliament adjourned on 
October 24, and strong objections to the award were 
immediately voiced. Henri Bourassa gave a detailed 
recapitulation of all the circumstances surrounding the 
dispute, beginning with the early 1820 f s 4 and R.G-. 
Macpherson, of Burrard constituency, voiced the objec¬ 
tions of British Columbians to a treaty which cut them

off from the rich gold fields of the Yukon, Macpherson 
ended his speech by advocating the construction of a 
road from Vancouver to the Yukon, 1 * 3 Laurier and Borden 
both expressed wonderment at the terms of the treaty, 
and though they took the attitude that no definite 
opinions should be formed until they were in possession 
of full information on the case, it is evident that both 
were indignant, Borden said that three Canadians should 
have formed the British Empire delegation and blamed the 
Government for neglecting to consult Parliament regarding 
the matter,2 while Laurier criticized the implication 
that Lord Alverstone had not acted with impartiality and 
spoke strongly against the American appointment of com¬ 
mission members who ”could not qualify as impartial 
jurists”.3 

Other opinions were expressed, mostly of an 
indignant nature, with S.E. Gourley of Colchester and 
S, Hughes even going to the lengths of talking of the 
possibility of war, as the following excerpt from the 
debate reveals: Mr. Gourley:....

"We are not a weak colony. Six millions o.f free people 
would beat the United States single-handed in the 
contest. If we fought them as the Swiss people fought 
the power of Austria, we should beat them to a stand¬ 
still. We are a powerful people, and occupy the best 
strategic position on this continent." 

Mr. Hughes (Victoria): "We beat them in 1812, when 
they were relatively forty times as populous as they 
are now." 

Mr. G-ourley: "Of course. And we could do it again."* 1 2 " 
By the t5jne parliament met again, in March 1904, 
the high feeling had subsided somewhat, and about the 
only references to the matter were several requests by 
Borden that certain papers bearing on the case should be 
made available.^ 

Laurier and Imperial Relationships 

In 1897 Laurier as Canada’s representative atten¬ 
ded Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee celebration in 
London. In the covirse of his visit he took part in the 
third Colonial Conference, in which representatives of 
Great Britain met with those of the colonies to discuss 
matters of mutual concern. Following this he paid a 
visit to France. In both countries he made a great 
impression and honors were heaped upon him -- Queen

Victoria knighted him, and in France he was presented 
with the ribbon of the Legion of Honor. In both 
countries he made a number of notable speeches, par¬ 
ticularly in England, where he appeared to be inspired 
by the magnificence of the occasion, and dwelt in elo¬ 
quent terms upon the grandeur of the British Empire and 
the growing importance of the colonies. Some of his 
political opponents charged that he was sacrificing his 
democratic principles in favour of Chamberlain 1 s type 
of Imperialism, but Laurier proved their accusations 
false a short time afterwards when he successfully led 
a resistance movement at the Conference to Chamberlain’s 
proposal of an Imperial Council and increased Empire 
centralization. His visit did much to publicize Canada’s 
possibilities for settlement by Europeans, at a time 
when immigrants were urgently desired in Canada. 

Five years later Laurier attended another 
Colonial Conference, held in London shortly after the 
death of Queen Victoria, Chamberlain was again the 
chief spokesman for Great Britain, while the important 
colonies were represented by their Prime Ministers. 
Laurier was accompanied by a notable delegation includ¬ 
ing W.S, Fielding, Sir Frederick Borden, and Sir William 
Mulock. Again it fell to Laurier to take the lead in

defending colonial prerogatives against the centralizing 
ambitions of Chamberlain, which had been sharpened by 
the experiences of united Empire action gained during 
the Boer War. Laurier, while approving the general 
principle of Empire co-operation, stood firmly against 
any measure of compulsion, or any tendency to limit the 
expanding autonomy of the Dominions. He upheld the idea 
of close trade relations, but believed that a system of 
trade preference was preferable to an outright customs 
union, and, applying the same principle to military 
co-operation, objected strongly to the principle of 
Canadian money contributions to Imperial forces. The 
withdrawal of the last Imperial troops from Halifax in 
1900, and the final departure in 1904 from the practice 
of having Imperial senior officers and Commanders-in - 
Chief for the Canadian militia, were in line with his 
general view that Canada should assume responsibility 
for her own defense and have full control of her own 
affairs, both internal and external. 

The Trade Negotiations With Germany and Belgium 

The policy of imperial preference initiated by 
Canada in 1897 led to official protests from Germany and 
Belgium. These two countries had most-favoured-nation 
treaties with Britain dating from the 1860*3, and so

claimed the same preferential treatment as was accorded 
her, but in 1898 Eritain renounced these treaties in 
order to take advantage of the Canadian offer, and at 
the same time to assist Canadian economic progress. 
Retaliatory measures were taken by both Germany and 
Canada, Germany continuing most-favoured-nation treat¬ 
ment on a provisional basis to all British Empire 
countries except Canada, and Canada imposing a surtax 
of 10$ on the goods of any country which discriminated 
against her 0 The tariff war between Canada and 
Germany lasted until 1910, and revealed the independent 
line of action that was now being taken by Canada in 
her economic affairs. 

The question of trade relationships with Great 
Britain, Belgium, Germany, and other countries was brought 
up in the House in 1897 and debated thoroughly in 1898, 1 
upon a motion of A. McNeil of North Bruce, to the effect 
that preferential trade with Great Britain was desirable, 
but apparently the House did not come to a division on 
this particular motion.

A vast number of other questions concerning 
external relationships discussed in the House during 

these early years of Laurier’s administration. Some of 
them dealt with questions which had already been settled 
or have been discussed previously, such as the Bering 
Sea Seal Award, reciprocity with the United States, the 
Halifax Fishery Award, and Irish Home Rule. Some dealt 
with questions of comparatively minor significance, and 
others dealt with questions which appeared to be unim¬ 
portant then but later became extremely important, such 
as the question of a Canadian navy. 

It is evident that there was a much greater 
volume of discussion on matters affecting foreign 
relationships than at any time previously, both relatively 
and absolutely. While most of the discussion still 
centred on affairs which were of direct concern to 
Canada, an increasing' amount of attention was being 
paid to larger world problems. Several reasons for this 
development can be given readily, among them the South 
African War, which took Canadian soldiers abroad for the 
first time, the increasing Canadian autonomy, and the 
growing complexity of imperial and foreign relations, 
particularly with Great Britain and the United States, 
but also with other Empire countries such as South Africa

and other foreign nations such as Belgium, Prance, and 
Germany«

CHAPTER VI 

THE ADMINISTRATION OF SIR WILFRID LAURIER 
PART II (1904-1911) 


A* Canadian Affairs (1904-1911) 

During the second half of his long premiership 
Laurier retained the position of unrivalled authority 
over parliament which he had won during the first half, 
but not without difficulty. So many of his leading 
advisers either deserted him or were east overboard by 
Laurier himself that the Liberal government became almost 
a one-man administration - a situation which perhaps 
enhanced his personal prestige but in the long run had 
disastrous consequences for both Prime Minister and 
Liberal party. 

The outstanding internal development was the 
admission in 1905 of two new provinces to Confederation, 
on equal terms with the others. They were carved from 
the part of the North 'West Terrorities south of the 60th 
parallel of latitude, and although there was some dispute 
over how many units should be formed from this large area, 










137 


it was finally decided that there should be two, Alberta 
and Saskatchewan, to be separated simply by the 110th 
meridian of longitude. The process of organizing the 
government of the two new provinces was marred by a 
revival of the separate schools controversy, and although 
it was settled by a provision essentially the same as that 
which had settled the issue in Manitoba ten years earlier, 
it caused a good deal of bitter debate and ill feeling. 
Clifford Sifton broke with Laurier over this question and 
left the government. 

Laurier had little difficulty in winning the elec¬ 
tion of 1904, being aided by prosperous times and the 
steady development of the West, and emerged with a healthy 
majority of sixty-two seats in the House. He faced the 
next election, that of 1908, with a little more trepidation; 
as he had been having increasing trouble with his 
supporters, and the Conservatives were making the most of 
reputed scandals in the government services to levy charges 
of dishonesty and corruption against the administration. 
Vs/hen the ballots had been counted, the Liberals found 
themselves sbill in office, but with their majority reduced 
from sixty two to forty seven. 

During these years immigration continued steadily 





138 


on an increasing level, and Canada’s population increased 
so rapidly that Laurier felt justified in prophesying that 
as the nineteenth century had been the century of the 
United States, so the twentieth century would be the 
century of Canada. The exodus of Canadians to the United 
States declined, to such an extent that in 1910 there were 
only 11,000 more native-born Canadians in the United States 
than in 1900. x Immigration from all countries between 1897 
and 1912 totalled 2,250,000, and the total population 
increased from 5,371,315 in 1901 to 7,206,643 in 1911. 1 
This rapid increase in population was matched by a 
corresponding development of agricultural production, and 
exports of wheat and other agricultural products rose to 
hitherto undreamed of heights. The rapid progress in 
practically all fields of human endeavor was the Laurier 
government’s best claim for continued recognition by the 
people, and as suggested provided the main reason for 
Liberal victories at the polls in 1904 and 1908. The 
Government also had a creditable record in domestic and 
social legislation, including an act providing for old age 
annuities in 1908, another to improve the civil service 
system, and the Lemieux Act of 1907 5 v/hich was drafted by 
Deputy Labor Minister Mackenzie King, and was designed to 

1 Carl WIttke: ’’History of Canada”, p.255. 












159 


prevent stoppage of operations of public utilities in 
disputes between capital and labor. 

In pite of this and other noteworthy legislation 
the Liberal party was entering upon a period of decline 
similar to that of the Conservative party during and after 
the last days of Macdonald, a decline marked by varying 
degrees of inefficiency, scandal, and party disruption. 

Henri Bourassa, one of Laurier*s ablest assistants, had 
broken with him as early as 1899 over the question of 
sending Canadian troops to South Africa, and was gathering 
around himself an increasingly large following in Quebec. 

The Minister of Public Works, J. Israel Tarte, had 
supported the manufacturers 1 agitation for higher tariffs 
in an attempt to seize power for himself during Laurier*s 
absence at the 190E Colonial Conference, and Laurier on 
his return promptly asked for his resignation. A.G.Blair 
had resigned in 1903 after a dispute over railway policy, 
and Clifford Sifton had followed suit in 1905, having 
disagreed with Laurier over the question of separate 
schools in the West. Other defections followed, and the 
once-famous "Ministry of all the talents" became a | 

decidedly mediocre administration. Charges of inefficiency 

; 

and graft were levied against various departments, 

of Marine and Fisheries and of the 


particularly those 



















Interior, and other charges of favoritism and personal 
delinquency lowered the standing of the government in the 
eyes of the public. It was becoming increasingly evident 
that the Liberals were deteriorating as a party, and were 
becoming more interested in retaining office than in attend¬ 
ing to their duties. 

The election of 1911 w&s fought around various 
aspects of external affairs, including the question of 
naval appropriations and that of a renewal of reciprocity 
with the United States. An odd combination was formed 
to oppose Laurier*s middle-of-the-road policy on naval 
matters, between Bourassa*s Quebec Nationalists, who 
wanted only isolationism, and Borden*s Conservatives, who 
thought that direct contribution to G-reat Britain, while 
objectionable in some respects, would be better than 
Laurier*s proposed "tin-pot navy”. In the matter of 
reciprocity Laurier appeared to have the support of large 
sections of the Dominion, including virtually the whole 
West, in his quest for a trade treaty with the United 
States. When that country in 1910 reversed its traditional 
policy and made an offer of reciprocity to Canada it appear¬ 
ed to be certain that a treaty would be arranged. Borden ' 
however revived the old annexation cry with decisive effect : 
and on these two issues the Laurier government in the 1911 



















141 


election went down to a surprising and humiliating defeat. 


B. The International Scene (1904-1911) 

The outstanding development between 1904 and 1911 
was the clear division of Europe into two great camps of 
armed powers, while in the atmosphere of steadily 


increasing tension all nations devoted more and more energy 


and money to making preparations for the now seemingly 
inevitable conflict. The Triple Alliance continued as one 
of the two major groups of powers^ although Italy drew a 
little further away from the other two members and assumed 
an increasingly less responsible attitude. This lack o± 
cordiality was accentuated in 1908 when Austria annexed 
Bosnia and Herzegovina in spite of Italian disapproval. 

It was revealed even more strikingly in 1911 when Italy 
herself seized Tripoli, although knowing very well how 
badly the news would be received in Berlin and Vienna, 
where attempts to win the favour of the Mussulman world 
were still proceeding. 

The rival group of powers, the Triple Entente, 
came into being in 1907, after Great Britain and Russia 


had managed to patch up their outstanding differences, 
particularly those respecting zones of influence m Persia 
Since France had been Russia’s ally since 1895, and since 


















142 


Britain and Prance had established an entente in 1904, the 
little circle of friendly agreements was complete. The 
three nations were compelled to make common cause in the 
face of the threat of the Triple Alliance, and after 1907 
were generally to be found speaking with one voice on 
major issues. 

The Entente was of especial value to Russia, who 
was not only becoming more unfriendly with the Central 
Powers, but had been badly defeated by the Japanese in 
1904-5. European nations had foreseen the war and had 
expected the speedy defeat of Japan. Russia also expected 
an easy victory but had not wanted to fight until her 
Trans-Siberian railway had been completed. The difficulty 
of both land and sea communication between European and 
Asiatic Russia, combined with the unexpected skill and 
vigor of the Japanese, proved to be decisive factors, and 
the Russians went down to a defeat almost as speedy and 
spectacular as that of the Chinese in 1895. Under the 
auspices of President Roosevelt a peace conference was 
called at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and a treaty was 
signed, humiliating for Russia as she had to renounce 
Manchuria and Korea, and cede to Japan Port Arthur, Dalny, 
and the southern half of the island of Sakhalin. The 
treaty had disastrous consequences for Europe, as Russia, 









145 


forcibly expelled from the Far East, turned her attention 
to the Balkans, the resulting complications providing 
a major cause of the war of 1914. The Japanese war had 
also far-reaching consequences within Russia, as it had 
been entered into largely to divert the attention of her 
down-trodden people from their sorry plight by the glories 
of foreign conquest. The defeat of Russia occasioned a 
short, sharp revolutionary outbreak which, although soon 
put down, compelled the Czar to grant a number of needed 
reforms, and also provided a forerunner of the larger 
revolution in 1917. 

A number of ir,ternationa!”incidents ft took place 
between 1904 and 1911, which not only served to heighten 
the tension but also warned that even an event of minor 
importance in itself might have far-reaching consequences. 
The first of these occurred at Tangier, Morocco^ in the 
spring of 1905. The Germans did not know the full terms 
of the Franco-British Entente of 1904, but suspected a 
good deal, and were particularly interested in those 
clauses dealing with Egypt and Morocco. Accordingly they 
were much irritated to see French influence spreading in 
the latter territory, and, apparently acting upon the 
advice of Holstein and Btilow, the Kaiser landed at 
Tangier on March 31 and made a speech which could only be 












interpreted as meaning that Germany intended to safeguard 
the independence of Morocco. Germany, with Turkish 
support, demanded that a conference be held to settle the 
question. Delcasse assumed a belligerent attitude and 
refused, but when neither the French cabinet nor the 
British government supported him he was forced to resign. 


President Roosevelt succeeded in arranging a conference, 

1 

and up to this point it appeared that France had suffered 
a major diplomatic setback. 

The conference met at Algeciras in April 1906, and 
turned out to be mainly a diplomatic struggle between 
France and Germany. Germany tried to preserve the 
independence of Morocco, and succeeded in establishing the 
theoretical principle that Morocco concerned all the Powers 
equally. France however was backed openly by both Russia 
and Great Britain, and more or less secretly by the 
United States and Italy, and consequently the practical 
results of the conference were all in her favour. Hot 
only did she divide with Spain commercial control over 
Morocco, but also she was able to retain a large measure 
of police control, fitom which Germany was excluded alto¬ 
gether. An important consequence of the Algeciras episode 
was that Great Britain and France began to discuss militaryi 
co-operation, and another was that from this point on the 
chances of localizing a European conflict seemed extremely 


remote. 


















145 


In July 1905 the Kaiser paid a surprise visit to 
the Russian Czar at Bjbrko, a small island off the coast 
of Finland, and there persuaded the impressionable Russian 
monarch to sign what virtually amounted to an alliance 
between the two countries. The Kaiser went home delighted 
with the success of his diplomatic venture, but the Czar’s 
advisers soon brought the latter monarch to his senses, and 
he was compelled to repudiate the treaty, on the quite 
reasonable grounds that it was not reconcilable with the 
Dual Alliance between France and Russia. 

In 1908 occurred the first of the many serious 
crises in the Balkans during the twentieth century, when 
Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria suddenly proclaimed himself 
independent of Turkey, and Austria without warning annexed 
the provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Russia was furi¬ 
ous, and demanded not only a conference to discuss the 
question but also adequate compensation, preferably in the 
Straits. Great Britain supported the first demand but 
could not permit the second, France was unwilling to go 
to war in support of her ally ? and with full knowledge of 

this disunity among the Entente Powers, and with solid 
German support behind her, Austria was able to make 















146 


good her annexation. Russia had not been appeased, 
however, and Serbia was enraged over the loss of a million 
Serbs to Austria. It was apparent that the Slavic nations 
would lose no opportunity to take revenge. 

In 1911 the dispute over Morocco again reached 
fever pitch, when the G-erman cruiser Panther was dispatched 
to Agadir, ostensibly to protect German interests there, 
but really to demonstrate that Germany considered the Act 
of Algeciras to be dead. Great Britain and Prance were 
both angered and alarmed, and for a time war seemed 
imminent, but Germany moderated her demands when she saw 
the impossibility of driving a wedge between her two 
rivals. A form of settlement was achieved when Germany 


gave France virtually a free hand in return for concessions 


in Central Africa. 

A second Peace Conference was held at the Hague 
between June and October in 1907, and though some useful 
technical work was accomplished little or nothing was 
achieved in the limitation of armaments. Towards the end 
of the Conference Great Britain offered to keep naval 


armaments at their existing levels and promised that she 
would build no more warships if the other Powers would agre< 
to do likewise, but Germany opposed this suggestion with 

There was a general feeling that 


vehemence and success. 

















147 


the time was not opportune to discuss the reduction of 
armaments, and indeed the risk of war was so great that no 
Power could afford to chance sacrificing preparedness 
unless all others did likewise. No uniform agreement could 
he reached regarding the manner and extent of disarmament, 
and so the Conference in this respect was devoid of results. 

What actually happened following the Conference was 
that all Powers rapidly increased their preparations. The 
launching of the first dreadnought by G-reat Britain 
in 1906 revolutionized naval warfare, and improvements in 
naval construction took place so rapidly that any warship 
tended to become obsolete after a few years. Germany 
launched a new and vastly more ambitious naval program in 
1907, and Great Britain had to take similar measures to 
preserve the two to one ratio she considered so necessary. 
The German army, already the most efficient in the world ; 
was added to at an astonishing rate, and her neighbors 
were compelled to resort to drastic measures to keep up 
with her. In 1905 a new French law raised army service 
from one year to two, and later the period was again 
raised to three years. Russia acquired another large loan 
from France early in 1906, part of which was used to in¬ 
crease her already large army and provide equipment for it 
Citizens throughout Europe were subjected to crushing

148 


burdens of taxation to provide for armaments, and with 
reluctance and fear were compelled to face the sorry 
prospect of either economic collapse or a conflagration 
which would engulf the whole continent. 

C.Canadian External Relationships and Hansard (1904-19111 

The Naval Controversy 

The question of naval defense had been considered 
in some form at every Colonial Conference after the lirst 
one in 1887. The original question of whether the 
colonies should make contributions to uhe Imperial! Navy, 
had gradually changed. By about 1907 it had assumed the 
form, should there be only one navy within the Empire, 
controlled by Britain, or should each of the self-governing 
colonies have a navy of its own? In other words, as the 
international situation became increasingly grave, a 
majority of people in the colonies came to accept the 
principle that naval contributions were necessary, and the 
main point of argument was over the form they should take. 
Imperial authorities had favoured the single navy, but 
many colonial authorities were turning to the view that it 
would be preferable to have navies of their own. In 1909 
both Houses in Canada passed a resolution stating that 


















149 


Canada was willing to assume her proper share in naval 
defense. In 1910 the Canadian Naval Service Act was 
passed, making all necessary provisions for the develop¬ 
ment of a Canadian navy. The warships Niobe and Rainbow 
were purchased from Great Britain in the autumn of the 
same year to serve as training ships; one to be stationed 
at Halifax and the other at Esquimalt. The project had 
been begun with remarkable co-operation and oneness of 
opinion in the House, but before long divisions began to 
appear, reflecting the lack of unanimity which prevailed 
throughout the country. English-speaking Conservatives 
denounced Laurier’s "tin-pot navy” as insignificant and 
useless, while Bourassa and his Quebec Nationalists 
objected to any scheme of naval construction or contributioi 
Laurier succeeded in carrying his Bill through parliament, 
but the differences of opinion were not reconciled. The 
Naval controversy proved to be one of the main issues in 
the election of 1911, and provided the "unholy alliance” 
of Conservatives and Quebec nationalists with one of their 


main weapons to unseat the Government. 

As the above summary would indicate, the debates 
in Hansard give a very thorough background to the naval 
controversy, and form a very reliable guide, since both 
the resolution of 1909 and the act of 1910 were

r t 

parliamentary measures. 

The resolution of 1909, which was introduced by 
the Hon. George E. Foster, Conservative member for North 
Toronto,iwas worded as follows, 

T, In the opinion of this House, in view of 
her great and varied resources, of her geographical 
position and national environments, and of that 
spirit of self-help and self-respect which alone befits 
a strong and growing people, Canada should no longer 
delay in assuming her proper share of the responsibility 
and financial burden incident to the suitable protection 
of her exposed coast-line and great seaports. ft 1 

After moving his resolution Foster defended it in 
a carefully-worded and moderate speech which seemed to meet 
with the approval of both sides of the House. He stressed 
the increasing gravity of the international situation and 


the growing need for Canada to take precautionary measures 
for her own protection, and also to assume an increasing 
share of Empire responsibilities. The following excerpt 
from his speech illustrates a consciousness of Canada’s 
growing responsibility and vulnerability which was almost 
totally absent fifteen years earlier: 

n Sir, into this ?/orld of trouble, of uncertainty, 
amongst this world of nations, Canada has pushed forv/ard , 
to her place. She has taken a position which is 
important now, which will become more and more important 
as the years advance. Her ship of state is launched on 
the world’s waters, it is open to every storm, it is 
exposed to every danger. She cannot escape the common 
burden, she cannot neglect the common duty, she cannot

escape the common burden, she cannot ignore the 
common responsibility.” 1 

Laurier himself replied to Foster, and while 
heartily endorsing his opinion that some action in regard 
to Canada’s naval deficiencies was imperative, criticized 
his motion on the grounds that it implied that Canada had 
previously neglected her Lmpire obligations, a point that 
Laurier refused to concede, and that the remedy it 
proposed was too indefinite to be of value. Laurier 
reiterated his views that the extent of Canadian 
contributions was a matter for the Canadian parliament 
to decide, and that in any case Canada should decline to 
make direct financial contributions to the Imperial navy, 
in favour of the policy of developing a small but efficient 
naval service under strictly Canadian control. At the end 
of his speech Laurier offered a motion of his own to 
replace that of Foster, the essential parts of which were 
as follows: 

Tt The House reaffirms the opinion, repeatedly expressed 
by representatives of Canada, that under the present 
constitutional relations between the mother country 
and the self-governing dominions.the payment of any 
stated contribution to the imperial treasury for 
naval and military nurposes would not, so far as Canada 
is concerned, be a satisfactory solution of the question 
of defence .••• 

"The House will cordially approve of any necessary 
expenditure designed to promote the organization of a

Canadian naval service in co-operation with and m 
close relation to the imperial navy ••••" 1 

. 

Robert Borden took the floor next, and expressed 
agreement with Laurier's two main propositions as outlined 
above, but suggested that the first paragraph quoted above 
would be better left out, because if a sudden outbreak of 


hostilities occurred a financial contribution would be about 
the only form of naval assistance Canada could give. He 
also suggested the insertion of some word such as "immediate 
or "early" before the word "organization" in the second 
paragraph in order ho indicate the intention to act 
promptly, and commented, as the others had done, on the 
fact that whereas Canada had made provisions for military 
expenditures for some time, and had in fact increased them 
greatly recently, nothing whatever had been done to 

provide for naval protection. 

A number of other members spoke an the question, 
most of whom expressed agreement with uhe general principle 


that Canada should take some action in naval matters. 

One of the few dissenting voices was that of B.T. Congdon, 
representing the Yukon Territory^ from whose speech a few 
scattered remarks have been quoted which illustrate Ms 
viewpoint clearly: 


tT I believe that the best policy for us to pursue 
is the one we are now following and from which see 
no reason for departing I do not think that there

is at present anything so critical in British relations 
as to cause us to get excited .... 

• ••• Why cannot a large nation like the British 
or the Canadian take a certain risk?" 1 

After reading Congdon’s speech one is tempted to 
conclude that mentally he was as far removed from the 
current of w>rld opinion as his constituency was 
geographically. 

Ernest Roy, French Canadian member from Dorchester 
endeavored to argue the question out in the calm light of 
reason, and while acknowledging Canada f s debt to Great 
Britain, expressed the fear that Canada might become 
involved in all future wars of Britain, and that European 
nations might become angered and alarmed if the British 
colonies suddenly started building sizeable fleets. He 
said that he saw no danger of immediate conflict, and 
counselled deliberate rather than precipitate action, yet 
realized that the unanimous opinion of the House was that 
Canada should proceed to acquire a naval force. 

After a number of other speakers had put forward 
their views, the motion of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, with the 
addition of the word "speedy" as proposed by Borden, was 
accepted by the House. 

The Naval Bill was introduced in the following 
session, on January 10, 1910. The introduction of the bill 


i 


1 Debates, House of Commons, 1909, vol. II, pp. 5323-7. 










154 


was foreshadowed in ill© Sp©©cli from ill© Throne , and again 
by Laurier himself during the debai© on the Throne Speech, 
when he commented on ihe faci ihai ihe unanimity of ihe 
previous session had disappeared, and ihai ihe government 
was now being violently upbraided by ihe opposition for 
its naval policy. Laurier quoted ihe enacting pari of 
ihe resolution of ihe previous session, and continued as 
follows, 

"Sir, this resolution is clear cut. There is no 
ambiguity about it. It is as precise as words can make 
it. Parliament stands there unaminously committed to 
the policy that Canada shall organize a Canadian naval 
service, to act in co-operation with the British 
admiralty .... Yet the ink of that resolution was # 
scarcely dry when we heard whisperings on the other side 
that the policy therein laid down did not altogether 
suit the party. These whisperings became murmurs, and 
the murmurs have now turned to ominous rumblings. 

From his succeeding remarks one gathers that 
Laurier gave credit to Borden and Foster for having until 
that time retained their previously expressed opinions, 
but felt aggrieved that a number of other opposition 
members, notably C.A. Magrath of Lethbridge, J. Herron of 
Macleod, and R. Lake of Q,u’Appelle, who had voted for the 
resolution last session, were now volubly demanding 
direct naval contributions to Great Britain. Having dealt 
with the members who were too ardent, Laurier turned to 


1 


Debates, House of Commons, 1909-10, vol. I, pp. 45-4 










155 


those whom he described as "stand-patters 1 *, ^ and severely 
criticized their preference for inaction, singling out 
F.D. Monk of Jacques Cartier in particular as one who was 
content to let sleeping dogs lie. 

Laurier introduced the bill himself for the 
Minister of Marine and Fisheries, L. P. Brodeur, who was 
ill, and in a brief speech outlined its main provisions. 

It proposed the creation of a naval force composed of a 
permanent corps, a reserve force, and a volunteer force, 
under the control of the Department of Marine and Fisheries. 
A force of eleven warships was planned, some to be based 
on Esquimalt and some on Halifax, the total cost of 
construction to be approximately $11,000,000, and to be 
carried out in Canada if possible. 

An interesting sidelight is provided by Laurier*s 
answer to a question put by T. S. Sproule of Grey 
constituency, who wanted to know if the ships would be 
used for Canada*s protection only or in wars which 


concerned the whole Empire. Laurier replied abruptly, 

"War everywhere. When Britain is at war, Canada is at 
war; there is no distinction. If Great Britain, to 
which we are subject, is at war with any nation, Canada 
becomes liable to invasion, and so Canada is at war.

Laurier*s answer reveals his intense loyalty to 
the British connection, and his conception of the relation¬ 
ship of the various parts of the British Umpire, especially 
during a crisis; a conception which some people find 
difficult to reconcile with his oft-expressed view that 
although uanada was automatically at war when Britain was 
at war, the extent of Canadian participation, if any, 
should be a matter for her Parliament to decide. 

The introduction of the Navy Bill initiated what 
was probably one of the longest and most time-consuming 
debates in the history of the Canadian House of Commons, 
in the course of which most of the members expressed their 
views, some being extremely divergent. It was apparent that 
many of the members had private views which were quite 
different from those of their leaders, but in the final 
analysis enough loyalty was demonstrated to give a 
semblance of party unity. Borden as the leader of the 
Conservatives criticized the Bill on the grounds that it 
was inadequate, that it could not be instituted in a short 
enough time to make it worthwhile in case a crisis occurred, 
and that it endorsed the principle that Canada could 
reserve to herself the right to withhold her proposed navy 
from participation in Umpire wars - a principle he abhorred. 











157 


When the question was boiled down to its essentials 
it became apparent that the Liberals supported Laurier in 
his proposal for a small but strictly Canadian navy, while 
the Conservatives stood behind Borden in demanding greater 
and more immediate action, which did not rule out the 
possibility of direct contribution to the Imperial 
treasury. When the debates finally ended and the question 
was put to a vote the Liberals emerged victorious with 
a majority of 111 to 70, and Laurier proceeded with his 
naval program. 

Empire Conferences and the De v elopment of Dominion Statu s. 

As may be gathered from the discussion of the 
naval question, an increasing amount of interest was 
being taken by Canadians both in their status as a unit 
of the British Empire and in the degree of autonomy they 
possessed in their relations with the outside world. 

While there was not unity of opinion regarding the first 
question, of the Empire relationship, there was regarding 
the second, and most Canadians, irrespective of race, 
religion, or political affiliations, felt an increasing 
desire to do away with such limitations on Canadian 
autonomy as remained. The years between 1904 and 1911 
witnessed a noteworthy development in Canada*s status as 


a nation*

In 1907 Canada demonstrated her growing independ¬ 
ence In the commercial field by arranging a separate 
commercial treaty with France, without British inter¬ 
ference or assistance. A similar understanding with 
Italy followed In 1910, and conventions were also entered 
into with Holland and Belgium. In 1909 the growing 
importance of Canada’s external relationships was 
recognized by the creation of a Department of External 
Affairs, which was to be combined with the Prime Minister’s 
office. 

Several important Empire conferences were held 
during the same years. A Colonial Conference was held 
in 1907, and the suggestion was put forward that the 
name of the meeting be changed to ’’Imperial Council”, 
implying that in the future there would be a greater 
trend towards Empire centralization. Although some 
colonial representatives welcomed the proposal, Laurier 
stood firmly against it, fearing that if some centralized 
form of government for the whole Empire were adopted the 
Dominions would all be submerged under the much greater 
representation which would have to be accorded to Great 
Britain. However he did approve changing the one word 
’’Colonial 1 ’ to ’’Imperial” implying a greater degree of 
equality among Empire nations, and accordingly this change 











159 


was made. Largely as a result of Laurier’s stand, the 
conferences were henceforth conducted more as being 
between equals than between an imperial authority and a 
number of subordinate dominions. 

A special naval conference was held in London in 
1909, with representatives from all the principal 
colonies in attendance. The rapid deterioration of the 
international situation, and particularly the distrust of 
Germany’s recently expanded naval program, made a 
re-orlentation of Empire defense appear imperative. The 
discussion centred on the future course of naval policy 
throughout the countries of the Empire, both individually 
and collectively. Canadian representatives did not 
fall in with Great Britain’s plans as whole-heartedly as 
Australia and New Zealand, but realized the gravity of the 
situation and the need for action. They carried this new 
understanding back horn© to the Canadian parliament and 
people, and an important outcome was the introduction of 
the Navy Bill in the House of Commons in 1910. 

The Imperial conference of 1911 met under similar 
circumstances and in much the same mood as that in 1907, 
except that an outbreak of hostilities appeared more 
imminent than previously. Sir Joseph ward of New Zealand 
proposed not only an advisory imperial Council of State, 








160 


but also an Imperial Parliament for the whole Empire. 

Both Canada and South Africa opposed the proposition 
vehemently, and even the British delegates criticized it 
severely. Needless to say it was not adopted. Another 
proposal, that Great Britain should inform and consult 
the Dominions about major international agreements, was 
adopted, and from this time on Dominion officials were 
generally better informed regarding important internation- 
al events and negotiations. A plan was worked out provide 
ing for co-operation between Imperial and Dominion navies 
in case of war, and Canada and Australia both accepted 
certain oceanic areas as their responsibility in the 
protection of commerce. 

Scattered through the pages of Hansard during these 
years are many brief references and several long debates 
on the questions of Imperial relationships, Empire 
Conferences, and Dominion status. In the session of 1905 
Sam Hughes introduced a motion reading as follows: 

"That in the opinion of this House the best 
interests of Canada and the empire at large would be 
advanced, and the peace, progress and prosperity of 
humanity be assured, by a full partnership union of 
Great Britain and her colonies; wherein there would 
be a united Imperial parliament, empowered to deal 
with inter-imperial, international, commercial, 
financial and other necessary national problems; but 
leaving to the existing parliaments their present 
powers, functions, control of tariff, and other

matters necessary for their own purpose. ,f ^ 

Hughes was British to the core and a steady advocate 
of increased Empire unity and co-operation, being 
act.u ated, one might perhaps say, by. motives similar to 
those which inspired Cecil Rhodes. He stated that his 
desire was only to bring the question before the House 
and publicize it throughout the country, and that he did 
not intend to divide the House on his motion. Consequently 
after a lengthy discussion, in which as usual a wide 
variety of opinions were expressed , the motion was 
withdrawn. In 1907 Hughes again introduced a similar 
motion and again withdrew it. 

In March 1907 a rumor that the Prime Minister did 
not intend to go to the approaching Colonial Conference 
in London caused Borden to inquire in the House if the 
rumor were true. Laurier admitted that pressure of other 
business might compel him to cancel his trip and Borden 
thereupon moved that the House discuss "the urgent public 
importance that Canada shall be represented by the Prime 
Minister at the approaching conference between the 
Secretary of State for the Colonies and the prime ministers 

p 

of the self-governing colonies.”

In a brief speech Borden outlined the reasons 
as he saw them which made Canadian representation 
imperative, and then said, ff I would regret it as a most 
deplorable incident if Canada were not represented. It 
would in fact result in practically nullifying the work 
of the conference .... 

I have said that the opposition were and are 
willing to facilitate the attendance of the Prime Minister 
at that conference; I think they have shown it .^ 

Whether Laurier had any motive other than pressure 
of business for not desiring to go to the Conference is 
not revealed, and the effect of Borden’s motion is also 
doubtful, but the fact remains that Laurier was present 
at the 1907 Conference and exerted his usual powerful 
influence. 

The bill which created the Department of External 
Affairs, introduced in the House during the session of 

• 2 

1909, occasioned a surprisingly small volume of discussion. 
This is odd, to say the least, in view of the interest 
that was being shown at the same time in Imperial and 
other external relationships, and particularly in the 
naval question. One can only conclude that the members 
were in unusual harmony over this particular matter, and

163 


that the need for a department to look after external 
affairs was so widely accepted that there v/as little 
occasion for discussion or argument. 

The Hague Tribunal (1910) 

Attempts by Secretary Hay of the United States to 
arrange a fisheries settlement with Newfoundland had re¬ 
sulted in the Bond-Hay agreement of 1902. By 1904 it had 
become obvious that the United States Senate would not 
ratify it, and it was vetoed by the British Parliament 
also at Canada’s request. In 1905 Newfoundland repealed 
the Foreign Fishing Vessels Act, and passed a new law 
forbidding Americans to hire local help in Newfoundland 
waters. The resulting confusion led Canada and the United 
States to discuss means of settling the entire fisheries 
question. In 1908 Eiihu Root and lames Bryce had agreed 
that henceforth outstanding differences between Great 
Britain and the United States should be submitted to 
arbitration at the Hague, and in line with this agreement 
it was decided in 1909 to submit the whole fisheries 
question to the Hague Tribunal. 

The arbitration body was selected from the panel of 
the permanent court at the Hague, and consisted of a Brit¬ 
ish Empire representative, Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, Chief 
Justice of Canada, an American, Judge George Grey, and 












164 


three other members, from Holland, Argentina, and Austria. 
The tribunal published the results of its investigation in 
September 1910. 

The award was a compromise, and gave considerable 
satisfaction to both sides. Great Britain’s right to 
regulate tke fisheries was acknowledged, but it was 
stipulated that any such regulations must be in accordance 
with treaty provisions. If the United States should 
consider any regulation to be unreasonable or illegal, it 
had the right of appeal to a permanent mixed commission. 
Regarding the hiring of foreign employees by the Americans, 
the tribunal ingeniously decided that they might hire 
whom they pleased, but Great Britain could keep them from 
entering her waters if she wished. American fishing vessels 
were to report at customs houses if proper facilities were 
provided, and were also to pay light and harbor dues, 
provided that natives did also. The three mile limit was 
fixed so that all bays ten miles or less in diameter, 
and some larger bays also, were considered to be Canadian 
or Newfoundland territorial waters. 

The success of the negotiations and the friendly 
spirit in which they were carried out were a great source ! 
of satisfaction to all four of the countries concerned, 
and reflect creditably upon the ability and conciliatory 









165 


attitude of the negotiators. 

There appears to have "been little discussion of the 
arbitration at the Hague prior to its conclusion, perhaps 
because the award was made public in September 1910, when 
Parliament was not in session. Complications arising after 
the publication of the decision caused a renewal of 
negotiations to take place privately between Canada and 
the United States, and these were described by the Minister 
of Justice, Sir Allen Aylesworth, in January 1911. He had 
been one of Canada’s representatives at these discussions, 
held two weeks previously at Washington, and had just 
returned to Ottawa. The Americans had objected to four 
features of Canadian legislation which had remained after 
the Hague award had been announced, the prohibition of 
purse seining, the prohibition of Sunday fishing, the 
provisions for searching suspected foreign vessels, 
including American, and the system of issuing licenses 
which was still used by Canadian authorities. Aylesworth 
appeared to be quite pleased with the results of the nego¬ 
tiations, as the Canadian representatives had been able 
to preserve the first three of the four rights mentioned 

i • 

above, namely, to prohibit purse seining and Sunday fishing' 
and to retain the right of search. To accommodate 












Is 












166 


American fishermen the licensing system was modified in 
several details, so that it became less burdensome# ^ 

The above discussion attempts to deal with the 
salient features of Canada*s external relationships 
between 1904 and 1911. Not all aspects have been 
discussed in detail, but perhaps enough has been said 
to indicate the trends in Canadian thought respecting 
world affairs during this period. It is apparent that 
Canadians were developing a sense of international 
consciousness and even responsibility; also that 
Canada’s position in the world, particularly with regard 
to the Imperial connection should Great Britain become 
involved in a war, occasioned more thought than at any 
time previously. The Members of Parliament were not as 
yet however discussing international affairs in the 
larger sense to any great extent, except insofar as they 
directly affected Canada, either alone or as a unit of 
the British Empire, by threatening her with involvement 
in a war not of her own choosing.

CHAPTER VII 

PROM THE ACCESSION OF BORDEN TO THE 
OUTBREAK OF WAR (1911-1914) 

A, Canadian Affairs 1911-1914 
Robert Laird Borden, who was swept into power by 
the Conservative landslide in 1911, assumed office at a 
time when the eyes of Canadians were being forcibly 
turned abroad by the ominous situation in Europe. 

Although an increasing amount of attention had to be 
paid to external problems, the first three years of 
Borden’s regime were by no means devoid of results at 
home. One of the most Important steps taken by his 
government was the enlargement of the three provinces 
of Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba to their present size, 
so that only the northern islands and that part of the 
mainland lying west of Hudson’s Bay and north of the 
60th parallel remained as territories. In 1915 a Bank 
Act was passed, which made improvements in the Canadian 
system of banking and gave greater security to depositors. 
Steamship and mail services both within and without 
Canada were greatly extended and improved, and railway 
facilities were enlarged, the National Transcontinental 















ri

being completed with government aid. Large terminal 
elevators were built in the West, to facilitate the 
marketing of grain and to provide increased storage 
space. An act provided for government aid in agricul¬ 
tural instruction, and efforts were made to encourage 
the conservation of natural resources. There was a 
great deal of agitation in favour of woman’s suffrage, 
and the federal government was urged to take action, 
but Borden steadily refused, holding that the electoral 
franchise was amatter to be settled by the provinces. 

Borden, like Laurier, had to face problems in 
party and government control, and found these problems 
difficult to handle^ a® he lacked Laurier ! s charm of 
manner and gift of leadership. He was intelligent and 
well-educated, the holder of several university degrees, 
and a constitutional expert of some distinction, but 
not an outstanding leader of men, and had won his posi¬ 
tion mainly through honest effort and dogged persever¬ 
ance. The composition of his ministry was a possible 
source of future trouble, as it was formed from the 
"unholy alliance" of Quebec anti-imperialists and die¬ 
hard Ontario Conservatives, and included such widely 
divergent personalities as the fiery Imperialist Colonel 
Sam Hughes, the Minister of Militia, and the arch- 




169 


isolationist P.D. Monk. There were few men of distinc¬ 
tion in the cabinet, with the possible exception of 
George E. Poster, a tried and true supporter who became 
Minister of Trade and Commerce. Borden perhaps deserves 
credit for preventing cabinet dissension from causing 
more trouble than it actually did, although he had to 
accept the resignation of Monk in 1912, who wanted a 
referendum on the governments naval policy and left 
the cabinet when his colleagues did not agree with him. 

Borden was perhaps unwise in conducting exten¬ 
sive inquiries into the activities of the previous 
administration, in the hope of discovering evidence of 
scandal and inefficiency. The evidence was not difficult 
to find, but Borden’s own administration was not 
infallible, and it was not long before the Liberals were 
able to counter with similar charges of wrong-doing. 
Accusations of maladministration, jobbery, and "pork- 
barrel" legislation were hurled freely from one side 
to the other in Parliament, and the only cause the 
House had for congratulating itself was that apparently 
anything suggestive of scandal was being given a good 
airing.

Borden*s domestic policy did not differ widely 
from that of Laurier in most essentials. Having been 
elected on a platform which refused to accept recipro¬ 
city with the United states, he was forced to reconsider 
the question in 1915, when the boom that had marked the 
Liberal era collapsed suddenly, and a depression set in 
which made a reciprocity arrangement with the United 
States again seem desirable. 

All domestic issues had to be shelved, to meet 
the crisis caused by the onset of war in the summer of 
1914. In the struggle and bloodshed which followed all 
other problems were subordinated to the all-important 
ones of providing for war needs and aiding the allies 
in the defeat of the enemy. The war initiated a number 
of changes of the most sweeping and fundamental nature, 
which profoundly altered Canada*s status as a nation, 
both within the Empire and in relation to the outside 
world. Some of those developments have not yet been 
completed, and it is impossible to foretell with any 
accuracy what the future holds in store. The year 1914 
therefore marks in many ways the end of one era in 
Canadian history, both internal and external, and the 
beginning of another. 





171 


B, The International Scene 1911-1914 
This period was marked by steadily increasing 
tension throughout Europe, and particularly in the 
Balkans, where crisis followed crisis in rapid succes¬ 
sion until the outbreak of the major conflict in the 
summer of 1914. All attempts to restore an atmosphere 
of sanity and moderation in international discussion 
and to halt the steadily onrushing flood of armament 
construction, proved to be useless# Lord Haldane was 
sent to Berlin on an unofficial peace mission in the 
early months of 1912, but although he was on good terms 
with the Kaiser and the discussions were conducted in a 
friendly spi.rit nothjmg was accomplished, either in 
limitation of armaments or in the arrangement of a 
naval ratio. As a last resort Winston Churchill, speak¬ 
ing as First Lord of the Admiralty, proposed a one year 
holiday in naval construction, but Germany distrusted 
British motives, and nothing came of the suggestion. 

Land preparations proceeded apace, particularly in France, 
Germany, and Russia, and an alarming feature of their 
great effort in army organization was that the two former 
nations were coming to the end of their manpower reserves, 
while the latter was approaching the limit of its finan¬ 
cial capacity. This made it probable, or at least pos¬ 
sible, that any of the three Powers might gamble on a

sudden onslaught when it considered that it had carried 
its preparations to the limit of its ability• Another 
factor which threatened to cause an early outbreak was 
that German strategists were known to believe that time 
favoured the Entente Powers, particularly slow-moving 
Russia, and so advocated a sudden attack before the 
Entente could realize its full strength* 

The storm centre of Europe during 1912 and 
1915 was the Balkans* The First Balkan War broke out 
in October 1912, with Servia, Bulgaria, Greece, and 
Montenegro arrayed against Turkey. An immediate con¬ 
sequence of the war was that Turkey was compelled to 
sign the Peace of Lausanne with Italy, thereby recog¬ 
nizing her occupation of Tripoli, carried out during 
the previous year. The Great Powers had tried to 
prevent the outbreak of war in the Balkans, not wishing 
the status quo to be altered, as would no doubt happen 
if the Balkan League should be victorious. The general 
feeling however was that the Powers would have to inter¬ 
fere to limit the power of an aggrandized Turkey, and 
great was the surprise when the Balkan nations won a 
speedy victory. After an uneasy truce hostilities were 
resumed on February 3, 1913, and in a short time the 
destruction of Turkish resistance was completed. War

threatened to break out between the Great Powers, because 
Austria was supporting the Turks and Russia the Serbs, 
but neither was anxious to fight over this issue♦ 
Realizing this reluctance, the members of the Balkan 
League adopted a high-handed attitude. They signed the 
Treaty of London, which was arranged by the Great Powers, 
on May 30, but immediately disregarded it afterwards. 
Bulgaria felt especially aggrieved at the settlement, 
which actually had favoured Greece and Serbia, and 
attacked both of her neighbours simultaneously, thus 
initiating the Second Balkan War. Rumania came to the 
aid of Greece and Serbia, and Turkey, naturally availed 
herself of the opportunity to obtain compensation for 
her recent defea^by attacking Bulgaria. The latter 
country 1 s resistance soon collapsed, and she was com¬ 
pelled to sign the Treaty of Bucharest, in August 1913, 
giving important concessions to all of Greece, Serbia, 
Rumania, and Turkey. None of the nations concerned 
looked on the settlement as being permanent, and all 
continued preparations for another conflict in the near 
future. The defeated Bulgars made friendly overtures to 
both Austria and Turkey, Serbia drew still closer to 
Russia, and Rumania and Greece hovered uncertainly 
between one side and the other. The stage was set for 
the larger conflict which was to follow.

The larger Powers also took steps to reassure 
themselves that they would not have to stand alone in 
the event of conflict. The Triple Alliance was reaffirmed 
in March 1914, although by this time both Germany and 
Austria had serious misgivings about the attitude of 
Italy and the prospects of that nation rendering any 
active assistance. An exchange of letters between Grey 
and Gambon in 1912 resulted in an Informal naval con¬ 
vention, and Prance transferred her North Atlantic 
fleet to the Mediterranean, leaving her North Sea coast 
to be defended by units of the British fleet which were 
moved from the Mediterranean to the North Sea. Efforts 
were also made to strengthen the British-Russian agree¬ 
ment, and naval conversations between those two nations 
took place in 1912. 

The spark which finally set fire to the powder 
magazine was lit in the Balkans on June 28, 1914, when 
the heir to the Austrian throne, the Archduke Franz 
Ferdinand, was assassinated at Sarajevo by a Serbian 
patriot. The Austrian government, which had apparently 
decided that the time was ripe for a settlement with the 
Serbs, and relying on the German blank check for support, 
presented Serbia with a list of demands so harsh as to 
be almost impossible of fulfilment. Serbia adopted a

surprisingly conciliatory attitude, and appealed to the 
Powers for mediation. Both Great Britain and Germany 
attempted to play the role of peace-makers, but after 
Austria had sent Serbia a harsh ultimatum on July 23, 
with a time limit of only 48 hours, hopes for a peace¬ 
ful settlement rapidly faded. Austria declared war on 
Serbia on July 28, and mobilization of the Powers pro¬ 
ceeded amid frantic last-minute attempts to avert a 
general conflict. Germany declared war on Russia on 
the afternoon of August 1, after a twelve hour ultimatum 
to cease mobilization had expired, and attacked both 
France and Belgium on August 4, At midnight of the same 
day, trtie to her obligations to Belgium, Great Britain 
entered the war at the side of her allies. Armageddon 
had begun.

and Hansard 1911-1914 

Borden*s Naval Program 

When Borden assumed office he showed no eager¬ 
ness to enact any naval legislation, and his government 
did nothing to put Laurier T s program into effect. Speak¬ 
ing during the debate on the Speech from the Throne, 
Laurier pointed out that the naval question had not been 









176 


mentioned, recalled the resolution which had been passed 
in 1909 approving the speedy organization of a Canadian 
naval service, and then, after remarking that Borden 
while in opposition had taken the Liberal government to 
task on the grounds that its program was inadequate, 
proceeded to criticize him for inaction and neglect of 
duty* Having commented with great sarcasm on the odd 
combination of Quebec Nationalists and Conservative 
Imperialists who made up Borden ? s administration, 

Laurier proceeded to move the following resolution: 

"That the following words be added to the 
address: 

We beg to represent to your Royal Highness 
that by resolution of this House, adopted the 31st 
of March., 1909, it was affirmed that: 

This House fully recognizes the duty of the 
people of Canada, as they increase in numbers and 
wealth, to assume in larger measure the responsi¬ 
bilities of national defence* 

And further: 

This House will cordially approve of any nec¬ 
essary expenditure designed to promote the speedy 
organization of a Canadian naval service. 

That in pursuance of that resolution the late 
administration proceeded to adopt a well-defined 
policy of naval organization. 

That with regard to that policy, as well as 
to the whole question of naval defence, there is in 
the present cabinet a flagrant conflict of opinion, 
and that some of its members have repeatedly, both 
before and during the last elections, denounced 
naval service in any form whatsoever. 

We respectfully submit to your Royal Highness 
that ... the inclusion, by the Prime Minister, in 
the present cabinet, of members holding diametrically

opposite views on a question of the highest impor¬ 
tance to the Dominion and to the Empire, is contrary 
to the well understood principles of responsible 
government and should not receive the approval of 
the House. 

Bord.en countered with a direct and extremely hard¬ 
hitting reply, in which he answered Laurier T s accusations 
with telling effect. In reference to naval policy he 
quoted the following passage from one of his recent 
election speeches: 

"Since the last general election the govern¬ 
ment (i.e. Liberal government) has entered upon a 
new line of policy in regard to naval affairs, 
which is of far-reaching importance. The policy 
adopted was not debated before the people during 
the election, and it bears all the earmarks of a 
hasty and ill-considered scheme. In my judgment 
our duty to the empire cannot be properly or 
effectively fulfilled by such a measure. I hold 
that the plan of the government contemplates the 
creation of a naval force that will be absolutely 
useless in time of war, and therefore of no 
practical benefit to Canada or to the Empire. It 
will cost immense sums of money to build, equip, 
and maintain. It will probably result in time of 
war in the useless sacrifice of many valuable lives, 
and it will not add one iota to the fighting strength 
of the empire. The more it is considered, the more 
does it become evident that the whole naval plan of 
the government is an unfortunate blunder." 1 2

After this quotation Borden continued to criti¬ 
cize the naval policy of the preceding administration, 
but although he promised to take the whole matter into 
consideration at some later date he gave no indication 
as to what his own policy in naval affairs was to be. 

As time went on and nothing was done curiosity respect¬ 
ing government naval policy grew, and it was suspected 
that the administration had abandoned the idea of a 
separate Canadian navy. A certain measure of enlighten¬ 
ment was obtained on March 4, 1912, when A.A. Mondou of 
Yamaska asked in the House: 

’’Does the government intend to propose the 
repeal of the Naval Service Act? 

If so, does the government intend, in case 
of such repeal, to propose another Act containing 
the policy of the government in the matter? 

If such other Act is proposed, is it the 
intention of the government to submit the same for 
the approval of the people before being put Into 
force?”! 

John D # Hazen, the new Minister of Marine, 
Fisheries and Naval Service, replied as follows: 

’’The answer to each of these three questions 
is ! Yes f . After such consideration and inquiry as 
may be necessary, the government will present its 
naval policy to parliament and the people. That 
policy will undoubtedly require legislation which 
will involve the repeal of the present Naval Service 
Act. In the meantime that Act will remain on the

statute-book for purposes in connection with the 
Fishery Protection Service and otherwise. Before 
any permanent naval policy is put into force, the 
people will be given an opportunity to pronounce 
upon it." 1 2 

In the summer of 1912 Borden went on a visit to 
England, From the statement in his Memoirs that- ”The 
necessity of reaching a decision with respect to naval 
co-operation with Great Britain made the visit not only 
desirable but necessary,"^ there can be little doubt 
that the naval problem and the tense international 
situation were the prime moving factors In the visit. 
While in England he had many intimate conversations with 
prominent British government officials, including Mr, 
Asquith and Winston Churchill, who freely communicated 
their worries to him and told him that the best contri¬ 
bution Canada could make to Great Britain would be some 
of ”the largest and strongest ships of war which science 
can build or money supply." The huge German naval bill 
of 1912 had caused Great Britain much additional concern, 
and being continually reminded of the sizable contribu¬ 
tions which Australia, New Zealand, and even the

Federated Malay States were offering the Mother Country, 
it is not surprising that Borden returned home firmly in 
support of the proposal that Canada should make direct 
contributions to the British fleet* 

On October 14, Borden presented to Council a 
draft of the Naval Aid Bill which he proposed to intro- 
duce into parliament during the coming session. All 
members voiced unanimous approval with the exception 
of Monk, who resigned on October 18 and died a few 
months later. Before introducing his Bill into parlia¬ 
ment Borden gave Laurier a copy of a memorandum from 
the British Admiralty, couched in terms stressing the 
likelihood of war and the need of help from Canada. 

He hoped by so doing to obtain a measure of support 
from the Liberals, or at least of non-resistance, but 
it soon became apparent that his efforts were useless. 

On December 5 Mondou proposed a motion to the effect 
that so long as the people of the United Kingdom 
retained exclusive control of foreign policy, the 
Canadian Government had no right to impose responsi¬ 
bilities of defense on the Canadian people. The amend¬ 
ment was defeated by a majority of 183 to 4 and it was 
apparent that as in Laurier f s regime the dispute was 
not going to be over the principle of contribution to 
Empire defense but over the form it should take.

Borden introduced his Navy Bill on December 5 
to a packed House, the galleries of which were filled 
with spectators, many of whom had come from all parts 
of the country to hear the proposals. He gave the House 
a summary of proceedings during his visit to Great 
Britain in the previous summer, read the memorandum from 
the British Admiralty, outlined his own views on the 
seriousness of the naval and international situations, 
and then informed the members of his proposal, to 
appropriate $35,000,000 to the British Government, for 
the construction of three of the largest type of battle¬ 
ships, He stressed that although these ships were to 
be maintained and controlled by the Imperial authorities, 
they would be subject to recall, after due notice had 
been given, by the Canadian government, if it should 
ever be desired to establish a Canadian unit of the 
Royal navy. He also repeated Laurier f s principle that 
the Canadian contribution was not to be interpreted as 
providing a precedent for future action, and stated 
that although the ships were to be built in Great 
Britain, since necessary facilities for their construc¬ 
tion did not exist in Canada, the Admiralty were never¬ 
theless prepared to place orders in Canada for the 
construction of small cruisers and auxiliary crafto 






182 


A few excerpts may help to illustrate the tone 
and content of Borden ! s speech, undoubtedly one of the 
most important pronouncements on Canadian foreign policy 
that has ever been uttered by a Canadian statesman: 

!, The evolution of the constitutional rela¬ 
tions within the Empire during the past half century 
has been not less marked than its material progress. 

In this constitutional development, we are neces¬ 
sarily confronted with the problem of combining 
co-operation with autonomy. It seems most essential 
that there should be such co-operation in defence 
and in trade as will give to the whole Empire an 
effective organization in these matters of vital 
concern. On the other hand, each dominion must 
preserve in all important respects the autonomous 
government which it now possesses .... During my 
recent visit to the British islands, I ventured on 
many public occasions to propound the principle 
that the great dominions, sharing in the defence 
of the Empire upon the high seas, must necessarily 
be entitled to share also in the responsibility for 
and in the control of foreign policy. No declara¬ 
tion that I made was greeted more heartily and 
enthusiastically than this..., 

.... This Empire is not a great military 
power, and it has based its security in the past as 
in the present almost entirely on the strength of 
the navy. A crushing defeat upon the high seas 
v;ould render the British islands or any of the 
dominions subject to invasion by any great military 
power. The loss of such a decisive battle by Great 
Britain would practically destroy the United Kingdom, 
shatter the British Empire to its foundation, and 
change profoundly the destiny of its component parts. 
The advantages which Great Britain could gain from 
defeating the naval forces of any other power would 
be non-existent except inso far as the result would 
insure the safety of the Empire. On the other hand, 
there are practically no limits to the ambitions 
which might be indulged in by other powers if the 
British navy were once destroyed or disabled.... 





185 


.... Almost unaided* the motherland, not for 
herself alone, but for us as well, is sustaining the 
burden of a vital Imperial duty, and confronting an 
overmastering necessity of national existence. 

Bringing the best assistance that we may in the 
urgency of the moment, we come thus to her aid, in 
token of our determination to protect and ensure 
the safety and integrity of this Empire, and of our 
resolve to defend on sea as well as on land our 
flag, our honor, and our heritage.’ 11 

Borden T s speech was greeted by tremendous 
applause^ and both the House and the gallery in a great 
demonstration of loyalty rose to their feet and sang 
the national anthem* 

The Bill was read for the first time in the 
House a week later, on December 12, and Laurier rose to 
reply before a packed gallery. With all his well-known 
eloquence he protested that he approached the problem 
in the same non-controversial spirit and with the same 
worthy motives as the Prime Minister, and differed with 
him only because he sincerely felt that his policy was 
more conducive to the welfare of Canada and more accept¬ 
able to its people, than that of the Government. He 
said in part:

. .. ,f I ask once more, what is the remedy? In 
our humble judgment, the remedy is this, that where- 
ever, in the distant seas, or in the distant countries 
- in Australia, Canada or elsewhere - a British ship 
has been removed to allow of concentration in 
European waters, that ship should be replaced by a 
ship built, maintained, equipped and manned by the 
young nation immediately concerned*... This is the 
Australian policy, this ought to be the Canadian 
policy.... 


....When England is at war, we are at war, and 
the thought of being neutral would be like the 
command of King Canute to the sea to recede from his 
feet. No action of ours could bring that about. 

When England is at war, we are at war; but it does 
not follow that because we are at war, we are 
actually in the conflict.... We can be in the con¬ 
flict only through two things, namely, actual inva¬ 
sion of our soil, or the action of the Parliament 
of Canada." 1 

Laurier concluded by moving that the Liberal 
program be proceeded with, of establishing two 
Canadian fleet units, to be based on the Atlantic and 
Pacific coasts of Canada, rather than adopting Borden’s 
policy of direct naval contributions, and sat down 
amidst prolonged applause from Liberal members and 
spectators. 

Thus the Liberal and Conservative naval policies 
were both clearly defined in the speeches of the party 


1 Debates, House of Commons, 1912-13, vol.i,pp.1022-1029. 












185 


leaders, Laurier*s being the one to which he had con¬ 
sistently adhered for many years, and Borden*s being one 
to which he had recently been converted, especially 
during and since his visit to England. Other members 
followed their leaders in the debate, which lasted until 
parliament adjourned for the Christmas recess on December 
18, and restimed after parliament opened again on 
January 14, 1913. It continued with unabated vigour 
until February 13, when a vote was taken on the various 
amendments which had been proposed, and the chief one, 
that proposed by Sir Wilfrid Laurier, was defeated by a 
majority of 47 votes. A vote was then taken upon Borden*s 
motion to set aside $3-5,000,000 for the construction of 
three battleships for the Imperial navy, and it was 
carried, although there were a few defections from the 
Conservative ranks by Quebec members. The resolution 
was then referred to the Committee of the Whole. 

In the Committee of the Whole a hard-fought and 
long drawn out battle began, which finally became so 
intense that in March the House remained in continuous 
session for nearly two weeks. The Liberals resorted to 
various obstructionist tactics, and it became obvious 
that they hoped to delay passage of the Bill and force 
the government to go to the country on the naval issue. 







186 


The debate grew more acrimonious, with threats of violence 
on both sides of the House, and members consumed time by 
reading long passages about the Navy Bill from previous 
debates and from the newspapers* Borden finally resorted 
to the closure rule, in order to get the Bill through 
the House, and it passed the third reading on May 15, 
by a majority of 101 to 68, in the face of the opposi¬ 
tion of Bourassa, who favoured neither Liberal nor 
Conservative program, the Liberals under Laurier, and 
five nominally Conservative supporters from Quebec, who 
refused to vote for Borden on this issue.^ 

The Bill now went to the Senate, where it 
encountered strong opposition which the Conservatives 
could do little to overcome. The Senate was predomin¬ 
antly Liberal as a result of Laurier f s long control over 
appointments to that body, and under his influence, 
mainly exerted behind the scenes, and under the leader¬ 
ship of the Liberal Sir George Ross, enough strength was 
gathered to defeat the Bill, it was sent back to the 
Commons on May 30 with the message that the Senate felt 
that it could not give its assent to the Bill until it 
had been submitted to the judgment of the country.

After such a long struggle it might be expected 
that Borden would have been keenly disappointed that the 
Senate should take it upon itself to nullify his efforts 
of the past few months, and there was indeed some talk 
of curbing the power of the upper body as had recently 
been done in Great Britain. Perhaps his disappointment 
was not so keen as might have been thought however, as 
the long struggle in the House had shown that a very 
contentious issue was involved, which with a little 
misfortune might easily wreck the government if it had 
to carry its policy to the country* In answer to a 
question put by Laurier on June 6, the day of prorogation, 
Borden gave the somewhat surprising information that the 
government expected to buy the three ships eventually, 
which Great Britain planned to build in substitution for 
those which Canada would have provided had the Bill 
become law.**- Nevertheless he took no steps between that 
date and the outbreak of war either to revive the issue 
or to attempt to compel the Senate to accept the 
Governments program, and it appears that he was satisfied 
to let the matter drop for the time being. The tension

in Europe relaxed a little after the Balkan Wars ended 
in 1913, and perhaps there is much truth in Lower’s 
remark that "The thoughts of all North Americans, Canad¬ 
ians included, were far away from the old world when 
the news of the assassination at Sarajevo came out,"-*- 
implying the nation at large, as well as the Government, 
was able to forget the issue with little difficulty - 
a circumstance bearing eloquent testimony to Canada’s 
traditional isolationism, 

Canadian Trade Relations 

While the debates on the Naval Bill overshadow 
in importance all other matters dealing with external 
affairs, there are certain other aspects of Canadian 
external relationships which should be given brief con¬ 
sideration, One of these is the matter of Canadian trade 
relationships immediately before the war. The opportunity 
of securing a reciprocity treaty with the United States 
had been rejected by the electorate in 1911, and since 
Borden depended on this rejection for his accession to 
power he made no serious attempt to renew reciprocity

discussions, although the depression in 1913 forced his 
government to consider whether such a move would not be 
advantageous both to the party and to the country. How¬ 
ever as far as the debates in the Commons are concerned 
the issue of reciprocity with the United States became 
largely a dead issue, and only passing references were 
made to it between 1911 and 1914* 

On the other hand the question of trade with 
Japan was dealt with in some detail, Canadian relations 
with Japan were very cordial, perhaps owing to the 
British-Japanese alliance of 1902 and the trade treaty 
which had been arranged between the two countries in 
1911, and a movement began to attempt to establish closer 
trade relations between Canada and Japan* In March 1913 
Borden moved 11 that a treaty signed at London on the 3rd 
day of April, A.D, 1911, between His Majesty the King 
and His Majesty the Emperor of Japan be sanctioned and 
declared to have the force of law in Canada,,.,”^ 

After a lengthy debate in which many members 
expressed the cordial feelings of Canadians towards the 
Japanese the motion was passed.

In the same session the question of Canadian 
trade relations with the West Indies was brought up and 
thoroughly discussed, and George Foster, the Minister of 
Trade and Commerce, attended a Conference in the West 
Indies* He brought back with him a treaty providing for 
preferential rates of 20% for certain goods exchanged 
between Canada and the British West Indies, which was 
adopted by the House of Commons after prolonged 
discussion. 

While these two trade arrangements received the 
greatest amount of attention in the Commons, there were 
frequent references to trade relationships with other 
nations, notably Great Britain, Australia, and France, 
and one can only draw the rather obvious conclusion 
that while the Borden government did not endorse the 
principles of low tariffs and free trade it was still 
opportunist enough to seize a favorable trade arrange¬ 
ment when it could be secured. 

Immigratjon 

Canadian opposition to Chinese immigration, dis¬ 
cussed in an earlier chapter, had remained strong, in 
fact had increased as the Chinese population on the 
Pacific Coast increased and the need for it in railway 










191 


construction diminished. Acts restricting Chinese 
immigration were passed with great regularity after the 
first ones were enacted in the 188Q T s, and Chinese 
immigration dwindled to a low ebb. The objection to 
Japanese immigration was not so severe at first, 
especially during the early years of the British- 
Japanese Alliance and at the time of the Russo-Japanese 
war, when Canadian public opinion rejoiced at the sight 
of Britain’s old enemy receiving a thorough beating. 

The situation changed rapidly after Japanese began to 
arrive in large numbers in British Columbia and in 
1907 Rodolphe Lemieux and Mackenzie King went to Japan 
to negotiate a settlement of the problem. The result 
was the famous "Gentleman*s Agreement", whereby the 
Japanese government agreed to limit the number of its 
emigrants to Canada to no more than four hundred annually. 
Thus the Canadian government attained its essential 
object without dispute or difficulty, and, it is worth 
noting, without any assistance or interference from 
the British government. The Canadian endorsement in 
1913 of the British trade treaty with Japan was 
specifically stated not to be construed as interfering 
with Canada’s right to limit Japanese immigration. At 
the conclusion of his speech introducing the motion to

sanction the British-Japanese trade treaty Borden 
referred to the immigration problem in the following 
words: 


M .... The Conservative party of today ...are 
absolutely true to the policy that we enunciated in 
1907, namely, the policy that the Government and 
Parliament of Canada should keep in their own hands 
and within their own power the control of immigra¬ 
tion from Japan or from any other country in the 
world.... It is absolutely consistent with that 
policy that we shall do what we propose to do, 
namely to give consideration to this question in 
the light of the cordial and friendly relations that 
exist between the great Empire of Japan and the 
Empire of which we form a part and to deal in a 
cordial, just, and friendly spirit with any diffic¬ 
ulties if they should arise in the future. 

Although Oriental immigration was frowned on to 
such an extent, Laurier T s policy of encouraging 
Occidental immigration by all possible means was con¬ 
tinued, and it was a source of continued satisfaction 
to the Government of Robert Borden as it had been to 
that of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, that emigration to the 
United States had sunk to a level far below that which 
had prevailed during the first three decades after 
Confederation.

The Canadian Peace Centenary Association 

Much has been said in the last two chapters 
about Canadian discussion of preparations for war and of 
the likelihood that Canada would soon find herself 
engaged in a war in support of Great Britain. Yet 
interspersed among all the speeches dealing with inter¬ 
national disputes and problems are to be found eloquent 
expressions of hope that the threatening world conflict 
could be averted* and there is no doubt whatever that 
the overwhelming desire of Canadians* expressed by their 
representatives in parliament* was that some means of 
preserving a peaceful state throughout the world could 
be secured. Speaking in reference to the work of the 
Canadian Peace Centenary Association in the HoU.se on 
February 20, 1914, Borden doubtless was voicing the 
sentiments of all Canadians when he said: 

ft The cause which the Canadian Peace Centenary 
Association and the corresponding bodies in the 
United Kingdom and the United States have set before 
them is one with which we are warmly sympathetic. 

It is a triumph of humanity that during a century of 
rapid development, despite the existence of serious 
international differences and problems, the British 
Empire and the United States have found wiser and 
more humane methods of adjusting differences than 
the arbitrament of war. We welcome the achievement 
of a century of peace, and hope that it will prove

to be but the first century of peace s the fore¬ 
runner of a long series stretching into the future 
as far as human anticipation can trust itself.”^-

CONCLUSION 


In summary, one may begin with the general state¬ 
ment that it is not easy to identify a Canadian attitude 
to International affairs between 1867 and 1914. This 
is particularly true when Hansard is used as the main 
source, because, as has been pointed out previously, 
the debates of the House of Commons often show in very 
incomplete measure the opinion prevalent throughout the 
country, and also because parliament is essentially a 
house of divided opinions. It is also ©specially true 
of the early period after Confederation, when Canada*s 
control of her foreign affairs was so much more incom¬ 
plete than in recent years, and when most of the 
emphasis, both in parliament and throughout the country, 
was being placed on interior consolidation and develop¬ 
ment. 

Who or what were the authorities that actually 
controlled Canadian foreign policies and relationships 
between 1867 and 1914? To carry the question a little 
further, can it be said with accuracy that any truly 
Canadian foreign policies were in existence during most, 
if not all, of these years? These are both pertinent 
questions, and must be answered before this work can be

satisfactorily concluded. 

Regarding the first, it seems obvious that 
although the Imperial government had nominal control of 
Canadian external relations during the early years of 
the period under discussion, in reality control was 
divided between the Imperial authorities and the 
Canadian government, in a manner so indefinite as to be 
impossible of definition. Foreign nations regarded the 
Imperial government as the proper authority to deal with 
in any discussions or negotiations involving the colonies, 
and yet it would obviously have been impossible, even as 
early as 1867, for the British government to disregard 
completely the clearly expressed wishes of the Canadian 
government and people. The only result would have been 
a speedy termination of the Empire connection, and 
probably annexation by the United States soon afterwards. 
It also seems obvious that, while there was little 
formal definition of spheres of authority between 1867 
and 1914, there was actually a very real growth in 
Canadian control over her external affairs, so that by 
1914 she was insisting upon, and achieving, a very 
substantial degree of autonomy. This growth was slow, 
gradual, and almost imperceptible, and at no time was 
there a sharp break with the conditions prevailing in

the immediate past. There was however considerable 
evidence of this development, for example the increas¬ 
ing participation of Canadian authorities in boundary 
and other discussions with the United States, the steady 
growth of commercial autonomy, illustrated by the 
negotiation of independent trade treaties with such 
nations as France, and the gradual withdrawal of British 
army and naval forces from Canadian territory and 
Canadian waters. 

In answer to the second question, it is also 
evident that although Canadian public opinion on certain 
aspects of foreign relationships was at times clearly 
defined, there was actually no genuine Canadian foreign 
policy between 1867 and 1914. This might be expected, 
considering the preoccupation with internal affairs 
which characterized almost the entire period. It would 
seem self-evident that a necessary pre-requisite to an 
effective foreign policy in a country Is full control 
over its own external affairs, and since this existed in 
Canada in only a partial, though increasing, degree, a 
hazy and uncertain outlook towards the rest of the world 
can be expected as a natural consequence. 

This was indeed the case, and one of the most 
outstanding characteristics of the Canadian attitude to 





198 


world affairs between Confederation and the outbreak of 
the first Great War was its indefiniteness and uncertain¬ 
ty. Ample evidence of this can be cited; for example 
there was a strong difference of opinion in regard to 
what were perhaps the three greatest foreign issues 
confronting Ganada between 1867 and 1914 - the question 
of reciprocity with the United States, that of partici¬ 
pation in the Boer War, and the European problem, which 
for Canada seemed to revolve around the naval policies 
of the Laurier and Borden governments. 

Another fact which clearly emerges from a study 
of Hansard is that in many important issues Canada is 
often a house divided. Ihe reasons are deeply rooted 
and, up to the present at least, apparently irremovable - 
the existence of two racial groups with different 
languages, religions, cultures, and traditions, the con¬ 
centration of most of the country’s wealth and industry 
in a small area in the St. Lawrence lowlands, and the 
vast distances and great natural barriers, which tend 
to separate our people mentally as well as geographically. 

A third fact which emerges is that Canadian 
interest in external affairs increased substantially 
between 1867 and 1914, if one may consider Hansard to 
be a guide. During the years immediately following

Confederation there was little discussion of external 
matters, and one might judge after reading the debates 
that Canada lived in a world a3_most by herself. The 
situation had completely changed by 1914, to such an 
extent that in the year when Borden*s naval bill was 
introduced there was perhaps more discussion on this 
and related topics than all others combined. While 
this growth appears to have been gradual, the South 
African War marked a definite turning point, and 
apparently did much to stimulate Canadian interest in 
international affairs. This rising interest coincided, 
with the growth of Canadian autonomy, and one is led to 
the rather superficial conclusion that the first depends 
in large measure upon the second. 

Another noteworthy feature is that although 
interest in international affairs increased greatly, 

Canada remained essentially a non-militaristic nation. 
Military expenditures increased considerably during the 
period, but in comparison with European Powers Canada 
by her own choice remained practically unarmed. This 
situation was the direct result of the desire to remain 
aloof from the complications of the outside world, par¬ 
ticularly to avoid commitments with European entanglements. 
Canada has been isolationist throughout most of her 






200 


history, although there appears to have been a trend 
away from that tendency between 1899 and 1914, It is 
perhaps not too much to say that Canada was less isola¬ 
tionist between 1899 and 1914 than between 1918 and 
1939. 

A fifth conclusion that one may draw is that 
Canada ! s voice in International relationships, and 
probably her attitude towards them also, were greatly 
affected by the influence of several dominant personal¬ 
ities, particularly Prime Ministers Macdonald, Laurier, 
and Borden. Their influence spans the entire period, 
and each 7 in a very real sense, may be considered the 
voice of his era. 

Lastly, one is led to the inescapable conclusion 
that two of the greatest factors influencing Canadian 
public opinion have been the United States and Great 
Britain. Most of our citizens have come to us from 
either one or the other, we are intimately connected 
with them by economic, racial, and social ties, and It 
is a matter of sheer self-interest that we preserve 
good relations with both. It is impossible for a 
country to escape the influences of geography and 
heredity. As long as the United States continues to

boundary, and as long as we remain a unit of the 
British Commonwealth, our future is irrevocably bound 
up with, and in a sense dependent on, these two great 
nations *
