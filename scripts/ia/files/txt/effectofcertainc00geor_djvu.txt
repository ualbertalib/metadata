PART I 


THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN CARDIAC GLYCOSIDES 

i 


ON SKELETAL MUSCLE 





INTRODUCTION 





- 1 - 


Certain glycosides possess valuable cardiotonic properties 
and are therefore referred to as cardiac glycosides* The pharm¬ 
acological action of these glycosides on heart muscle has been 
extensively investigated. However, much less work has been done 
as to their effects on skeletal and smooth muscle. 

CHEMISTRY OF THE CARDIAC GLYCOSIDES 


There are a great number of these drugs from a wide variety 
of plants: Digitalis purpurea, Digitalis lanata, Strophanthus, 
Squill, Apocynum, Helliborus, and Adonis. Only those used in 
this investigation will be discussed here. 

The glycosides from these plants consist of a sugar molecule 
and an "aglycone” or T, genin u composed of a cyclopentane phenan- 
threne nucleus and an unsaturated lactone side chain of four or 
five carbons (1). This lactone ring is essential to the action. 
The genins are responsible for the digitalis action. The sugars 
enhance the absorption. From Digitalis purpurea comes the three 
chief cardiac glycosides; digitoxin, and the amorphous gitalin 
and gitoxin. 

(a) Digitoxin 

Digitoxin was isolated by Nativelle in 1$69. It occurs as 
crystals, soluble in alcohol but insoluble in water. It is the 
glycoside to which the action of digitalis is largely attributed. 
On hydrolysis it is very easily cleaved to yield digitoxigenin 
and digitoxose (2). Its empiric formula is given as CyHg/jPij

and consists of digitoxigenin, ^ 23 ^ 4 °^ joined in glucosidic 
union with three molecules of digitoxose, anoC-desoxy sugar* 

(b) Digitaline German 

Digitaline German is an amorphous mixture from the seeds of 
Digitalis purpurea. It is reported by Sollmann (1), to contain 
Digitonin 50-60%, Digitalin Vernum,5-6% and Digitalein. Digitonin 
is a saponin which does not produce typical cardiac effects, and 
Digitalin Veraum is the alcohol soluble portion from the seeds* 

(c) Ouabain 

Ouabain is the main glycoside from Strophanthus gratus* It 
was discovered and so nammed in 1&8& by Amaud who isolated the 
crystalline glycoside from the bark and roots of the Ouabion tree. 
It is characterized by its water solubility* Preliminary work 
on the structure of ouabain was done by Jacobs and Hoffman (3,4), 
and Jacobs and Bigelow ( 5 , 6 )* The sugar moiety is rhamnose* 

Fieser and Newman (7) give the following structural formula. 



Ouabain

Because of anatomical differences between skeletal and 
smooth muscle and because of widely different techniques used, 
this thesis has been divided for convenience into two parts:- 
Part I deals with skeletal muscle and Part II deals with smooth 
muscle,

PART I 

SKELETAL MUSCLE 

PHYSIOLOGY OF SKELETAL MUSCLE 

A knowledge of the physiological characteristics of skeletal 
muscle is necessary for an understanding of the effects of drugs 
which act upon these phenomena. 

Skeletal muscle fibres are large, multinucleated cells en¬ 
closed by a thin structurless membrane, the sarcolemma. The 
cytoplasm contains myofibrils responsible for the characteristic 
cross-striations. A muscle consists of bundles of these fibres. 

The nerve supply is derived from anterior horn cells of the spinal 
cord. Single nerve fibres from the terminal branches of peripheral 
nerves lead to striated muscle fibres. As an efferent nerve 
approaches a muscle fibre, its myelin sheath is lost, and the 
endoneurium appears to become continuous with the endomysium. 

The axon with its neurolemma enters the muscle fibre at a site 
where the sarcoplasm is highly specialized. Here the axon di¬ 
vides into several arborizations (motor-end plates) closely 
applied to the sarcolemma (3,9,10). 

Considerable evidence has been brought forth to support the 

view that nerve transmission takes place by the elaboration of 

/ 

a chemical substance, acetylcholine. In 1933, Kibjakow (11) 
perfused the superior cervical ganglion of the cat with oxygen¬ 
ated Locke’s solution. Injection of the solution from the vein

of the perfused ganglion collected during strong stimulation 
of the cervical sympathetic nerve caused contraction of the 
nictitating membrane. Chang and Gaddum (12), suggested that the 
chemical transmitter of Kibjakow's work was acetylcholine. This 
was later confirmed by Feldberg and Gaddum (13)* Using Kibjak- 
ow's technique, they concluded that the mechanism by which a nerve 
impulse passes the synapse consists in the liberation of small 
amounts of acetylcholine. This was substantiated by work of 
Brown and Feldberg (14,15). Strikingly similar results were 
found by perfusion of the inferior mesenteric ganglion of the dog 
(16), the basal ganglia of the brain (17), the perfused tongue 
of the cat (IS), and the stomach wall (19)* 

In 1934, Dale (20) found a similar effect in the perfused 
hind foot of the cat® Later, (21), using the hind limbs of the 
cat, dog and frog, he suggested there was an analogy between 
the release of acetylcholine by impulses arriving at motor nerve 
endings in voluntary muscle and its release by impulses reaching 
the ending of preganglionic fibres in ganglionic synapses* 
Stimulation of the motor nerves of perfused voluntary muscle 
caused the appearance of acetylcholine in the venous fluid. When 
the muscle was completely denervated, no acetylcholine appeared 
in response to stimulation. Bulbring and Burn (22) suggested 
that acetylcholine had a direct stimulant effect on motor 
neurones. Feldberg (23) showed that superior cervical ganglion, 
cholinergic nerves (cervical sympathetic, vagus, phrenic nerve 
and motor roots), divided with scissors in eserinized saline, 
synthesized acetylcholine® When the cervical sympathetic trunk

was cut in a preliminary operation the ganglion lost, in 4# 
hours, its property of synthesizing acetylcholine, Feldberg 
and Vartiainen (24) concluded that liberation of acetylcholine 
by preganglionic impulses occurred at the synapses® Because all 
the experimental procedures have a similar influence on the trans¬ 
mission of impulses at autonomic ganglia, and at somatic neuro¬ 
muscular junctions, it is widely inferred that the process of 
transmission is the same at both synapses. The total chain of 
events is summarized by Rosenbleuth (25), 

That Wallerian degeneration causes a progressive failure 
of transmission and a failure in the elaboration of acetyl¬ 
choline has been shown (21, 23, 26, 27, 2$). Finally Dale and 
Gasser (29) have shown that the sensitiveness of denervated 
gastrocnemius muscle to acetylcholine is associated with a type 
of action which has no relation to its parasympathetic effects.

ACTION OF THE CARDIAC GLYCOSIDES ON SKELETAL MUSCLE 


Only a brief statement is necessary here as to the ther¬ 
apeutic action of the digitalis drugs on the heart. According 
to Sollmann, these drugs increase the tonus, excitability and 
contractility and the refractory phase of cardiac muscle; stim¬ 
ulate the vagus centre and slow conduction through the bundle 
of His. Because most of the work concerning these drugs has 
been done on cardiac tissue, reference will be made from time to 
time as to their effect on the heart, for purposes of comparison* 
(a) Effect on Muscular Response 

Cattell (30) showed positive inotropic effects of 10$ 
above normal for frog’s sartorius muscle previously soaked in 
Ouabain-Ringer solution 1:1,000,000. This increased response 
continued for 1.5 hours and then dropped to zero in an atmos¬ 
phere of oxygen. Re-imersion in Ringer’s or in the original 
ouabain solution caused complete recovery. Since recovery 
occurred in the presence of ouabain, this author concluded that 
some intermediate readily diffusible substance, probably 
potassium, is liberated by the drug. Using the isolated papillary 
muscle of the cat heart, Cattell and Gold (31), showed that 
digitoxin 1:100 million produced a marked increase in the force 
of contraction in fatigued preparations. They suggested a 
direct action on the muscle. They later confirmed this in 
rabbits (32), but found the dose was 1:25 million, suggesting 
a greater resistance to digitalis glycosides in rabbit cardiac 
muscle. That different glycosides varied in the concentration 
needed to produce these effects was also demonstrated (33)*

Del Pozo (34), could find no effect of strophanthin on the 
contraction of the non-fatigued gastrocnemius muscle of the cat® 
In excessive doses greater than the toxic fatal dose, rapid re¬ 
ductions were produced in the responses, leading to total loss 
of excitability* In muscles stimulated at high frequency prod¬ 
ucing transmission fatigue, the drug produced an elevation in 
amplitude* He suggested improved neuromuscular transmission as 
an explanation* Testing this hypothesis with acetylcholine 
produced negative results* Del Pozo also showed (35), there was 
a negligible storage of K-strophanthoside in striated muscle, 
but this storage was significantly increased in muscles sub¬ 
jected to work* He suggested this may be an explanation for the 
selective storage of the glycosides by heart muscle* It is 
known that cardiac tissue, representing only 1 % of body weight, 
takes up 10 % of administered digitalis bodies 0 Using the bi¬ 
ceps of the turtle, Pisantry (36), showed a contraction which 
was irreversible, progressive and which reached a height super¬ 
ior to the maximum contractions with large doses of both digi- 
toxin and ouabain* Small doses had no effect. 

(b) Cardiac Glycosides and Certain Ions 

After 1383 when Ringer showed the importance of various 
ions in the perfusion fluid, potassium and calcium became 
suspected of playing a part in the action of these glycosides* 
Harrison, Pilcher and Swing (37) reported that the potassium 
content of skeletal and cardiac muscles was diminished in 
patients dying of congestive heart failure* Later they reported 
this loss appeared due to edema, using gastrocnemius muscles 
taken by biopsy (3$), and that overwork in dog’s gastrocnemius

muscle causes loss of potassium (39)o In postmortem human 
studies (40), they found that edema was not the cause of potassium 
loss in cardiac tissue, and suggested that overwork may be the 
causeo Sampson (41) successfully treated 50 % of auricular and 
ventricular ectopic beats by the administration of potassium 
salts orally. Calhoun (42) reported that Digifolin in toxic 
doses caused a diminution in the potassium content of cardiac 
muscle of dogs, but not of their skeletal muscle. Amounts cor¬ 
responding to the therapeutic dose in man had no effect. Cattell 
and Goodell (43)* found that soaking the frog’s sartorius muscle 
in ouabain 1:500,000 caused a 29 % loss of potassium. They stated 
that ouabain might act by displacing potassium and increasing 
the Ca-K ratio inside the cell. The loss of potassium would 
upset the Ca-K ratio and cause changes similar to those prod¬ 
uced by calcium(44). Wood and Moe (21) reported a small de¬ 
crease in potassium in heart muscle of the heart-lung prepar¬ 
ation of the dog by Digilanid C* The loss was greatly increased 
by toxic doses. In the turtle heart, Wedd ( 46 ) could find no 
potassium decrease with digoxin except in high doses that im¬ 
paired the beat. He supported the view that the glycosides 
caused decreased potassium only in toxic doses. Hagen (47) re¬ 
ported an increase in potassium content in rabbit cardiac muscle 
with therapeutic doses of Digilanid C and a distinct decrease in 
potassium with doses six times as large. Boyer and Poindexter 
(4S) found increased intracellular potassium content in cats 
under digitalis and suggested that digitalis was quite like 
desoxycorticosterone in that it acted to maintain potassium 
within the cell. They mentioned the similarity in structure

be tween the two compounds. This view was supported by work done 
to show that Digitalis caused lowered plasma potassium levels and 
prolonged the life of adrenalectomized rats (49)® Dorfman (50) 
could find no such effect in cats. Wood and Moe (51,52) reported 
a decrease in potassium content of heart muscle and an increase 
in blood and serum potassium from the dog heart-lung preparation, 
with therapeutic doses of digitalis® This was also the opinion 
of Samson (53)* In the embryonic duck heart, only toxic amounts 
of digitalis were found to cause a loss of potassium (54)# 

Absence of potassium in the perfusion fluid enhanced the action of 
digitalis. 

The role played by calcium is equally confusing. Several 
workers suggested a synergistic action between calcium and dig¬ 
italis on cardiac tissue (55,56). Others reported only an add¬ 
itive effect (57,5^,59)® Hoff (60,61) could find not even an 
additive effect. Gold and Kwit (62) have criticized Hoff’s work 
on rabbits in that digifoline was administered 1$ hours before 
the calcium. According to the latter authors, the drug is ex¬ 
creted in & hours in rabbits so the animals were not under the 
effect of the glycoside at the time of administration of the 
calcium. They strongly support the idea of synergism. 

It was demonstrated first by Ransom ( 63 ) that the cardiac 
glycosides exert their full effect on the heart in the absence 
of calcium. By perfusing frog’s hearts for two hours in Ringer’s 
lacking calcium, strophanthin gave a marked therapeutic effect 
and also on hearts perfused with oxalate and citrate ( 64 ). 

Burridge ( 65 ) showed that hearts perfused with oxalate were de-

void of functional calcium in the tissueso The action of the 
glycosides in the absence of calcium has also been shown more 
recently in the frog heart (66,6?) and in the embryonic duck 
heart (6$). 

(c) Cardiac Glycosides on Tissue Respiration 

Extensive investigation into the role played by the cardiac 
glycosides on tissue respiration and energy producing mechanisms 
has been carried on. In 1930, Victor (69) observed that ouabain 
in a concentration of 10“% in isotonic sucrose caused a gradual 
increase in oxygen consumption of the heart 0 This Increase was 
much greater in Ringer’s. David (70) observed similar effects. 
Using the Warburg technique, several authors (71,72) have obser¬ 
ved an increased oxygen uptake by heart slices followed by a de¬ 
crease below normal. Wollenberger (72) reported a decreased ox¬ 
ygen uptake in rat’s gastrocnemius under the influence of ouabain. 
He could show no effect on tissue homogenates and on an artificial 
cell-free respiratory system 0 He concluded that ouabain did not 
interfere with the respiratory catalysts, but its action seemed 
to be dependent on the integrity of cellular structure, probably 
an increase in permeability of the cell surface to glucose. 
Bodansky (73) and Hermann (74), gave slightly different results 
in that they could not demonstrate the di-phasic effect, showing 
an increase which was continuous throughout the experimental 
periodo Bodansky found that the increase is dependent on the 
concentration of glucose. Both Bodansky and Hermann demonstrated 
that calcium was necessary for the increased oxygen uptake and 
that potassium and magnesium had no effect. One of these authors 
suggested that impermeability at the cell surface results when

calcium is absent from the medium. However, there is evidence 
(75) that absence of calcium increases cell permeability. It is 
also of interest that Clark (76,77,7$) has shown that in the ab¬ 
sence of calcium the oxygen consumption of frog auricle and vent¬ 
ricle is greatly reduced. Hermann (74) showed that the increase 
occurred regardless of tissue slice thickness and suggested that 
ouabain did not act by diffusion of substrate into the cell. He 
suggested an action on some enzyme system involved in the oxidat¬ 
ion of carbohydrate. This was also the opinion of Pisantry 
^36,79). That this increased respiration occurred in vitro was 
shown by Hermann (74) and Wollenberger (£0) o Recently, this 
latter author ($1) showed an increase in glucose oxidation by 
ouabain* There was no increase in glucose uptake* That lactic 
acid production was greatly reduced was also shown® Several 
workers (74,$2,$3,$4) have shown there is no effect of these 
glycosides on the phosphorylated intermediates, A. T. P® and 
Pho spho creatine* 

Harrison (S5) suggested that a failing heart is often under 
cellular oxygen deficit* By occlusion of the abdominal aorta 
in cats, del Pozo ($6) brought about ischemia in the gastrocnem¬ 
ius muscle and suggested, on the basis of Harrison’s assumption, 
that this would bring about a condition in striated muscle sim¬ 
ilar to that in cardiac tissue* When ischemia had produced im¬ 
portant changes, strophanthin produced marked effects® The 
amplitude of contraction increased, the duration of response 
was shortened, and the degree of summation became smaller* 

These changes also occurred in denervated muscle* He concluded 
a direct inotropic effect* Other cardiac glycosides were also

STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM

STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM 


In his early work , Del Pozo (34) suggested that the cardiac 
glycosides may act as chemical mediators, impeding the destruct¬ 
ive action of cholinesterase. However, he found no effect of 
strophanthin on the contraction of non-fatigued gastrocnemius 
muscle of the cat except in excessive doses above the toxic 
fatal dose c In his later work (£6) on ischemic muscle he sugg¬ 
ested a direct inotropic effect® This also appears likely from 
the work of Cattell (30,31,32). Pisantry ( 36 ) produced an effect 
in turtle’s biceps, but the doses used were large, and injected 
directly into the muscle® 

Since the action of cardiac glycosides on skeletal muscle 
is little understood, it was considered desirable to investig¬ 
ate this problem more thoroughly. Part I of this thesis Is de¬ 
voted to an investigation of the effects of certain of these 
glycosides on the response of the normal and denervated gast¬ 
rocnemius muscle of the rat, and on the perfused isolated dog 
leg®

EX PER IMENT A L 

A. EFFECT OF CERTAIN CARDIAC GLYCOSIDES ON THE RESPONSE OF 

THE NORMAL AND DENERVATED GASTROCNEMIUS MUSCLE OF THE RAT 


(a) Method 

The method of preparing animals and the apparatus used for 
recording was that described by Riedel and Huston (&9). The 
spinal cord of rats was sectioned at the upper lumbar region 
under ether anesthesia twelve hours before the experiment. 

The rat was then tied securely on its back to the recording 
table. One hind leg was fixed rigidly in steel clamps at the 
knee joint and ankle bone. The gastrocnemius muscle was 
isolated and a cord attached to the Achilla’s tendon. The tendon 
was then cut near the foot. The cord led over a pulley and was 
attached to an isometric spring lever which recorded on a slowly 
moving kymograph. Stimulation was obtained from an electronic 
stimulator at 10 second intervals. In normal legs, stimulation 
was applied to the peripheral stump of the severed sciatic nerve 
by means of a shielded electrode. In denervated legs, wire 
leads ran directly to either end of the muscle. Stimulation 
was always adjusted until a maximal occurred. Contraction 
tension was calculated as a percentage of that occurring 
immediately before injection of the drug. A 90 minute period 
of stimulation was carried out before administration of the drug 
which allowed for the levelling off of the muscular response. 

All drugs were injected intraveneously into the deep-dorsal vein 
of the penis in sterile saline.

(b) Dosage 

In some series a high dose and a low dose were used for 
comparative purposes• The central effects of these glycosides 
are well known (90,91,92) and were used to determine the final 
dosage used. After injection, the animals lay prone on the table, 
appearing as if anaesthetized, but still responding to touch. 

In the low dosages, this depression passed off in a short time, 
and the rats began to move again and even to preen themselves. 

In the higher dosages selected, this depression lasted much long¬ 
er, but the animals appeared normal before the end of the exp¬ 
eriment. These observations appear to correspond with the 
elaborate work of Gold and Modell (92) and Macht and Bloom (90). 

No rats died throughout the entire work. At the end of the 
experiment, they were usually killed by air injection.

RESULTS 

The response of normal and denervated muscle so prepared 
and in the absence of any drug decreases gradually over the 
experimental period (93)* A control series must therefore be 
used as a reference for the experimental results* Since the 
procedures used in this investigation were the same as those 
of Riedel in this laboratory, the controls established by him 
were used* Table I presents a summary of these controls for 
the normal and denervated gastrocnemius. 


1. OUABAIN 


Ouabain was used because it is obtainable in a crystalline 
form which is readily soluble. 

(i) Ouabain 1 mgm. per Kg. 

With this dosage the central effects wore off in a short 
time. The effect on the muscular response is shown in Table II 
for the normal gastrocnemius and Table III for the denervated 
muscle. Table I? shows a comparison of the normal and denervated 
series, where the figures represent the experimental mean as a 
percentage of the control mean of Table I. The effects are 
shown graphically in Figs. 1, 2, and 3* 

An examination of Table II, shows that the effects were 
variable on the normal gastrocnemius. The highest value re¬ 
ported for contraction tension was 112.7% at the end of the ex¬ 
perimental period, contrasted with a low of 63.2%. All other

values ranged between these and lay close to the normal values 
given in Table I. Fig. 1 shows that the drug likely has no sig¬ 
nificant effect at this dosage. From Table III, and Fig. 2, it 
is apparent that the same applies in the case of denervated 
muscle. Table IV and Fig. 3, show a comparison of the effect 
on normal and denervated muscle, as a percentage of the control 
mean. From these it appears that there may be some difference 
in action on normal and denervated muscle. However, in con¬ 
sideration of the large S. D. M. values, no significant effect 
of ouabain on skeletal muscle has been shown on the basis of 
these experiments.

CONTRACTION TENSION % 


24 



FIG. 3 



FIG. 4 

























- 25 - 


(ii) Ouabain 6 mgm. per Kg. 

The central effects were very apparent and lasted much longer 
than for the smaller dose. The effects on contraction tension 
are shown in Tables V, VI, and VII and graphically in *’igs. 

4, 5 and 6. Again the effects were extremely variable for 
the normal muscle especially early in the experimental period* 

For example, a low value of 23*3$ was reported with a high of 
112.6$. The depression shown through the early time range of 
Fig. 4 is therefore of doubtful significance. Throughout the 
remainder of the experimental period, the response followed 
closely that of the normal. The effects on the denervated 
muscle are not so erratic, but do not differ significantly from 
the controls. The results are therefore negative. Thus it 
appears that ouabain in both the low and high dosages used, 
shows no significant effect on the response of either the 
normal or denervated gastrocnemius muscle of the rat.

Since the Digitaline Nativelle was dissolved in ethanol, 
it was necessary to run controls using an amount of ethanol 
equivalent to that used in the experimental solutions. This 
amounted to 5.5 cc. of 1 + 0 % alcohol per Kg. 

ETHYL ALCOHOL 

The results are shown in Tables XI, XII, and XIII, and 
graphically in Figs. 10, 11 and 12. There appears to be no 
effect on the response of the normal gastrocnemius (Table XI 
and Fig. 10); nor of the denervated muscle (Table XII and 
Fig. 11). An examination of Table XIII and Fig. 12, shows that 
the values of both the normal and denervated muscles approximate 
closely those of the control values. Thus alcohol 1 + 0 % in the 
volume used, has no effect on the response of either normal 
or denervated gastrocnemius muscle and cannot account for the 
effect of the solution of Digitaline Nativelle.

2. DIGITALINE NATIVELLE 1.1 mgm. per Kg. 

Because of its insolubility, this drug was injected in 40$ 
alcohol. This is the original digitoxin isolated by Nativelle 
in pure crystalline form. Ampoules were used which were obtained 
from Varich Pharmacal Co. Each 1 cc. ampoule contained 0.2 mgm. 
Only the one dosage of 1.1 mgm. per Kg. was used. Central effects 
were manifest but wore off quickly. The muscular responses are 
shown in Tables VIII, IX and X. The effects are shown graphically 
in Figs. 7, & and 9* 

Fig. 7, indicates a depression throughout the early stages 
of the experimental period on normal muscle. In the latter 
stages this depression is less apparent and approximates the 
control mean. Table IX and Fig. $ show an increased response 
of the denervated muscle throughout the period. Only two 
animals out of the 14 used, showed a depression below the normal 
values of Table I, and even in one of these, the value finally 
rose above normal. All other animals showed values higher than 
the normal mean throughout the entire experimental period. 

The comparison shown by Table X and Fig. 9 indicates a signif¬ 
icant difference in the response of normal and denervated 
muscle. It will be noted that the improvement in the response 
as compared with the control, increases regularly throughout the 
period and at the end of 320 minutes shows a maximum value of 
12£.7$ for the denervated muscle. The normal muscle appears 
to be depressed during the early stages, but gradually recovers 
to values which approximate 100$ of the control at the end of the 
period.

3. DIGITALINE GERMAN 


The composition of this drug has been discussed. It is 
amorphous and water soluble. The solution froths considerably 
due to the large amount of saponin present. It was injected in 
sterile saline. 

(i) Digitaline German 30 mgm. per Kg. 


The effects of this dosage are shown in Tables XIV, XV and 
XVI and graphically in Figs. 13, 14 and 15» A significant in¬ 
crease in response is shown in the normal muscle throughout the 
entire period (Table XIV and Fig. 13). Most values remain above 
100%. Only one value (£6.5%) for one animal is reported which 
is lower than the corresponding time values of the control 
(Table I). That there is no effect on the denervated muscle 
is shown in Table XV and Fig. 14. The values are almost id¬ 
entical with control values throughout the experimental period. 
It appears therefore, that Digitaline German in this dosage 
improves the normal muscular response but has no effect on the 
response of the denervated muscle. These effects are summ¬ 
arized in Table XVI and Fig. 15,

A series on normal muscle only was done with this dosage. 
The effects on the normal muscle are shown in Table XVII. The 
improved response shown by the smaller dose is not evident here. 
In fact there is no evidence of stimulation since all values 
approach the normal values of Table I.

B. EFFECT OF OUABAIN ON THE PERFUSED ISOLATED DOG LEG 


(a) Method 

The apparatus used was that described by Murray and Huston 
(94). Dogs were anaesthetized with Pentobarbital 50 mgm. per Kg. 
The leg was prepared according to Huston, Martin and Dille (95). 
The isolated muscle was stimulated by electronic discharges 
through the sciatic nerve at 10 second intervals. Blood was 
obtained for perfusion from a second dog by cardiac puncture, 
and the blood was defibrinated by whipping with a brush and 
then filtered. 

(b) Results 

After preliminary investigation, it was found that ouabain 
in a concentration of 75 mgm.% had a profound effect on the 
response of the isolated muscle in a period of time in which the 
effect of fatigue was negligible. The results of 6 experiments 
are shown in Table XVIII. Fig. 16 is a typical tracing. The 
drug brought a rapid decrease in muscular response, followed 
by a complete loss of excitability. Perfusion with fresh 
oxygenated defibrinated blood brought no recovery. Fig. 16 
shows the lack of response more than one hour after the drug 
was removed by perfusing with fresh blood.

DISCUSSION 


It is difficult to compare the effects reported here with 
those shown by Cattell on frog T s sartorius muscle (30) and on 
the papillary muscle of the cat (31,32,33), since in all his 
work, the tissues were isolated and were all functionally de¬ 
pressed at the time of application of the drug* The results 
produced by ouabain correspond with the work of Del Pozo (34) 
using a very similar technique on cats gastrocnemius. Using 
strophanthin, he could find no effect on the muscular response 
in non-toxic doses® Pisantry ( 36 ) also could show no improve¬ 
ment of response with ouabain in frog’s sartorius and in cat’s 
gastrocnemius. He then used the turtle biceps prepared so that 
as little as possible of the drug would flow to the rest of the 
body. In this way he could inject large doses directly into 
the muscle. With both ouabain and digitoxin in large doses, 
he produced an irreversible contraction. In ischemic muscle 
of the cat, Del Pozo and others (£6,£?,£$) produced the same 
effect in normal as well as denervated muscle and concluded a 
direct inotropic effect* Again this muscular preparation must 
be considered functionally inadequate. Thus the tendency is 
to believe that the cardiac glycosides have no effect on the re¬ 
sponse of normal skeletal muscle but only on functionally in¬ 
adequate muscle or when the drugs are given in large amounts 
beyond the toxic fatal dose. This view is substantiated by 
the work of Del Pozo (35) who showed a negligible storage of 
K-strophanthoside in skeletal muscle. The negative results

obtained with ouabain seem to support this view. Using the 
intact rat no consistent significant effects were produced. 

The marked depression obtained with the perfusion of a high 
strength of ouabain through the isolated dog leg, correspond 
with that produced by Del Pozo (34) on cats gastrocnemius. With 
large doses of K-strophanthoside he showed a rapid reduction 
in the response in the gastrocnemius muscle of the cat until 
total loss of excitability* Ouabain 75 mgm.$ must also be 
considered a very large dose. The effects differ from those 
produced by Pisantry in turtle biceps, in that here a contract¬ 
ion was produced although the muscle became inexcitable. 

On the other hand, the results obtained with Digitaline 
Nativelle and with Digitaline German differ markedly from those 
obtained with ouabain and with each other. Digitaline Nativelle 
produced a depressant action on the intact muscle and a stim¬ 
ulant action on denervated muscle. Digitaline German produced 
a stimulant action on normal muscle and no effect on denervated 
muscle. 

The effect of Digitaline Nativelle may be explained as due 
to a stimulant action on muscle fibres and a depressant action 
on the myo-neural junction. When stimulus was through the 
nerve in the intact leg a depressant action on the myoneural 
junction would explain a decreased response. The muscle fibres 
might be more excitable but unable to respond. On the other 
hand, when stimulus was applied directly to the muscle fibres 
as in the case of the denervated leg, a stimulant action 
on muscle fibres could be manifest. Certainly there is a very 
marked difference in response of normal and denervated muscle

as shown by the Comparison in Fig. 9. Del Pozo (36) using 
ischemic muscle produced the same effect in denervated as 
in normal muscle. 

It would appear that the increased response of denervated 
muscle cannot be explained as a sensitivity due to the dener¬ 
vation. While it is known that denervation produces a sens¬ 
itivity (96,97,9^,99) the work reported here was undertaken 
before a sensitivity is reported to develop (100). Also there 
is no other evidence of sensitivity and none shown to ouabain 
and Digitaline German. 

The action of Digitaline German is more puzzling. There is 
no effect on denervated muscle indicating that the muscle fibres 
are probably not involved (Fig. 14) in the increased response of 
normal muscle (Fig. 13). Muscle involvement is not entirely 
ruled out however, since it may be that the changes in the 
muscle produced by denervation make it less robust and therefore 
less able to respond to a slight stimulus than normal muscle 
would be. It is known that denervation causes profound changes 
in muscle (26, 96). This possibility of denervation causing 
a less robust muscle has also been noticed in other work (39). 
Another explanation of the increased response would be a 
stimulus or facilitation of neuromuscular transmission. This 
might cause increased response of muscle fibres or recruitment 
of reluctant fibres not responding to the stimulus provided 
by the maximal arrived at by the usual technique of increasing 
charges. However, it is interesting to note, that the improved 
response caused by Digitaline German 30 mgm. per Kg. on normal 
muscle is entirely absent when the dose is increased to 65 mgm.

per Kg. (Table XVII). Thus it seems that different effects 
may be obtained with different dosages. 

In discussing the action of Digitaline German and contrast¬ 
ing it with the other cardiac glycosides tested, it is well to 
remember that it is a mixture containing 50-60$ of a saponin, 
digitonin (l). The actions noted may be due to the saponin 
or it may modify or oppose the action of the principles. 



PART II 


THE EFFECT OF OUABAIN ON SMOOTH MUSCLE 





INTRODUCTION 







t 




- 56 - 


PART II 

SMOOTH MUSCLE 

PHYSIOLOGY OF SMOOTH MUSCLE 

The wall of the intestine consists of four main layers, the 
mucous membrane, the submucosa, the muscularis externa and the 
serosa (101,102)* The muscularis mucosa consists of two thin 
layers of smooth muscle fibres* In the inner layer the fibres 
are circularly disposed and in the outer longitudinally. The 
submucosa connects the mucous membrane to the muscularis externa. 
The muscularis externa consists of two layers of smooth muscle, 
the inner layer being circularly disposed and somewhat thicker 
than the outer layer which is longitudinally disposed* 

(a) Innervation 

The nervous system of the intestine consists of two parts 
( 101 , 102 , 103 , 104 )* These are represented by the Intrinsic and 
Extrinsic portions. 

(i) Intrinsic Innervation 

In a section through the intestinal wall numerous nervous 
elements consisting of large or small groups of nerve cells 
and bundles of nerve fibres, are seen in the narrow space be¬ 
tween the circular and longitudinal layers of the muscularis 
externa. This is the myenteric plexus of Auerbach* In the 
submucosa similar elements form the submucous plexus of 
Meissner. 

(ii) Extrinsic Portion 


The extrinsic nerves are represented by the preganglionic

fibres of the vagus and the postganglionic fibres of the sym¬ 
pathetic (101,102,103)o The latter run to the intestine from 
the celiac plexus. They enter the intestinal wall through the 
mesentery along the branches of the long vessels. The sym¬ 
pathetic fibres pass mainly in the lesser splanchnic nerve to 
the lower part of the celiac ganglion and to the superior 
mesenteric ganglion, and from these ganglia, the impulses are 
relayed to the bowel. The postganglionic fibres pass without 
interruption through the plexuses of the bov/el wall to end in 
direct relation with the muscle cells 0 
(iii) Interrelationships 

Auerbach’s plexus is composed of numerous flattened ganglia 
connected with each other by commissures of non-medullated 
fibres (104). The submucous plexus comprises numerous small 
ganglia likewise connected with each other by commissures of 
nonmedullated fibres. Similar commissures also connect the 
myenteric and submucous plexuses with each other. The fibres 
of Meissner’s plexus are derived chiefly from the superior 
mesenteric plexus (101) and hence are postganglionic fibres 
from the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. 
Auerbach’s plexus contains preganglionic fibres of the para¬ 
sympathetic division, derived from the vagus. These fibres 
synapse with the cells of the terminal ganglia in the plexus 
which are therefore parasympathetic cell stations. The post¬ 
ganglionic fibres given off by these ganglion cells terminate 
on muscle cells which they stimulate. Post ganglionic fibres 
of the sympathetic also contribute to Auerbach’s plexus and 
reach the muscle directly. 











(b) Movements of the Intestine 


To begin a study of the movements of the intestine, it is 
necessary to go back to 1$99 to the epoch-making work of 
Bayliss and Starling (105-106). They observed the two main 
movements of the intestine; rhythmic pendular movements and 
peristaltic contractions affecting longitudinal and circular 
coats simultaneously. They believed the pendular movements 
were myogenic and the peristaltic contractions were carried out 
by Auerbach’s plexus. Every point of the intestine is under 
control of the central nervous system through the intermediat¬ 
ion of splanchnic and vagus nerves. The splanchnic nerves 
exercise a tonic inhibitory influence and the vagus augments 
intestinal movement. 

Years of research have continued since then, and although 
the physiology of the intestine is still to-day not clearly 
understood, the theories of Bayliss and Starling are still 
followed by many authors® 

In 1904, Magnus (107) made a plexus free preparation by 
isolating strips of circular muscle from the rest of the int¬ 
estinal wall* They were never spontaneously rhythmic but were 
responsive to drugs i.e. pilocarpine, physdstigmine, atropine 
and adrenaline* He thus considered that rhythm was dependent 
on Auerbach’s plexus. Since this pioneering work of Magnus, 
many workers have prepared plexus-free preparations which 
were rhythmic, thus supporting the view of Bayliss and Starling. 
This was done first in 1914 by Gunn and Underhill (10$) and 
by Gasser in 1926 (109) and very recently by Klinge (110). 

This latter author showed that local reflex paths which pass

through, or are a part of, the ganglion are not indespensable 
for the production of propagated contractions• The movements 
of the intestine have been subsequently described by Cannon 
(111), Siaulis and Sollmann (112), Henderson (113), Sealy 
(114), Hines (115), and Best and Taylor (116). 

In summary, the work of many authors suggests that the 
pendular movements are myogenic, and that peristaltic movements 
are neurogenic.

ACTION OF THE CARDIAC GLYCOSIDES ON SMOOTH MUSCLE 


The effect of the cardiac glycosides on isolated intestine 
is to provoke a strong augmentation of tone, accompanied by a 
great diminution of amplitude of contraction, and systolic 
arrest (117). Magnus (118), Kress (119), Kolda (120) and 
Warmoes (121) showed that atropine was almost without influence 
on the effects of the cardiac glycosides on isolated intestine 
while adrenalin caused a drop in tone* Weger (122) showed that 
isolated rabbit intestine reacted very strongly to arecoline 
and pilocarpine when it had been previously subjected to the 
action of digitalis and strophanthin. He suggested that they 
augment the excitability of parasympathetic endings. Kolda 
(117) found that the action of the cardiac glycosides were 
not impeded by atropine or adrenaline and concluded a direct 
effect on the muscle. 

The effects of ouabain on the intact dogs intestine has 
been studied. Hamet (147)(14$) showed that instead of cont¬ 
raction, the drug produced a marked relaxation. It decreased 
the tone and stopped circular and longitudinal muscular 
contractions, thus showing a reversal of form from isolated 
studies.

STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM 


The cardiac glycosides are usually considered as direct 
muscular stimulants in so far as smooth muscle is concerned, 
and are classified as such by Sollmann (1)* However, Hamet 
(147,14$) warns against any such classification due to the 
relaxation effect of ouabain on the intact dogs intestine. 

He states that because of this effect, the cardiac glycosides 
cannot be compared with barium chloride which is considered 
a direct muscle stimulant. 

Thus the action of the cardiac glycosides on smooth 
muscle is incompletely understood. Because of this, it was 
the purpose of Part II of this thesis to investigate further 
the in vivo and in vitro effects of ouabain on the intestinal 


muscle of rabbits

EXPERIMENTAL 


A. THE EFFECT OF OUABAIN ON THE ISOLATED RABBITS INTESTINE 


(a) Method 


(i) Apparatus 

The apparatus consisted of a water bath mounted on a large 
retort stand. The temperature of the bath was kept at 3&°C 
by means of a mercury-column thermostat* Even temperature was 
ensured by constant agitation by an electric stirrer. The 
muscle bath was of the usual type, 35 cc. capacity with a metal 
L-shaped muscle arm and clamped to the water bath. From the 
bottom of the muscle bath, a short rubber tube led through a 
rubber bung in the bottom of the water bath and thence to the 
sink* 

In this work, several solutions containing different ions 
were often used in the same experiment* It was found necessary 
to have a readily available supply of these solutions, at the 
proper temperature of 3$°C. The following arrangement was 
found convenient: Above the water bath, mounted on a flexa- 
frame by ring clamps, were three inverted winchesters* Each 
winchester contained a two-holed rubber stopper* Through one 
hole ran a long glass tube to the bottom of the winchester and 
open to the air. Through the other ran a short glass tube 
connected to a piece of rubber tubing. Each of these three 
tubes then joined one arm of a four-armed glass tube mounted 
below, thus creating a common route. The fourth arm of the

four-armed tube contained a rubber tube leading to a warming 
reservoir which was immersed in the water bath. Stop-cocks 
could then control the flow from either of the three winchesters 
to the common route made by the four-armed tube* 

The warming reservoir consisted merely of a glass tube 
l Tt x 10" clamped to the water bath. The reservoir contained 
a two-holed stopper at the top. Through one hole ran a short 
glass tube connected to the rubber tube from the common route, 
which also contained a small T-tube with a rubber syringe bulb. 
The other hole contained a short rubber tube with a pinch-cock 
to allow the escape of air as fluid entered. The bottom of the 
reservoir contained a stopper from which a rubber tube led 
to the muscle bath. A solution from either of the three win¬ 
chesters could be passed into the warming reservoir merely by 
opening the proper screw-clamp, and squeezing the pinchcock 
above the reservoir to a permit the escape of air. ^nce filled, 
and having reached the temperature of the bath, it could be 
forced quickly into the muscle warmer by squeezing the rubber 
syringe bulb. Solutions could be drained quickly from the 
muscle warmer by releasing a screw-clamp in the tube below the 
rubber bung. The winchesters could be removed quickly and 
filled allowing for a plentiful supply of any solution. 

The apparatus was constructed in duplicate. This allowed 
for six winchesters, two four-anned tubes, two warming reser¬ 
voirs and two muscle baths. This duplication hastened the 
work considerably. 

Air was constantly bubbled into the muscle bath through 
long fine capillary tubes connected to the laboratory air

composition was as follows:

The pH of the solution and of all subsequent solutions was 7*7. 
All drug solutions were prepared in Tyrode f s unless otherwise 
indicated. All solutions of drugs were prepared and used 
immediately. No solution was used after it had been standing 
for three hours. Concentrates were usually used and sufficient 
of this injected into the muscle bath to give the desired final 
concentration. In some cases, the drug solutions were prepared 
in large volume, in final concentrations, placed in the win¬ 
chesters and bathed onto the muscle. This did not appear to 
be as satisfactory as the former method, since the muscle 
was exposed to the air for a short period of time during the 
changing of solutions. This could not be avoided however, 
when solutions of different ions were needed. 

(iii) Preparation of Tissue 


Rabbits were anaesthetized by intravenous pentobarbital

a section of the ileum removed and placed in Tyrodes solution 
in the refrigerator until required. Strips 2-cm. long were 
cut, and stitched loosely with fine silk thread to the L-shaft 
of the muscle warmer* To the other end of the muscle strip 
was sewed another strip of thread leading up through the bath 
to a delicate recording lever* Tracings were made on a re¬ 
volving kymograph. The writing points were strips of photo¬ 
graphic negative*

RESULTS 


Ouabain showed no effect on isolated rabbit ileum in 
concentrations of 1: 5,000,000* In a concentration of 
1: 3,300,000, an increase in tone was evident which gradually 
decreased (Fig. 1$). Pendular movements were somewhat irreg¬ 
ular* Recovery occurred immediately after washing with fresh 
Tyrod£ T s. With higher concentrations ranging from 1: 2,500,000 
to 1: 1,250,000, pendular movements were greatly reduced or 
abolished. In these concentrations also, the tone was grad¬ 
ually reduced* With concentrations higher than 1: 2,000,000 
the muscle did not recover immediately after washing with fresh 
Tyrode’s, but showed a period of relaxation* During this 
period the muscle was entirely quiescent, with the tone con¬ 
siderably below normal* Eventually the tone began to in¬ 
crease, pendular movements reappeared, very short at first, and 
then increasing with the tone to the normal state* This re¬ 
laxation is similar to that reported by Whithead (10$) when 
potassium is added to a muscle in potassium-free solution* 

The effects of ouabain 1: 1,000,000 are shown in Fig* 17, which 
is a typical tracing chosen from many experiments. There 
is a rapid increase in tone leading to systolic arrest. Very 
short and very rapid movements may still exist* Fig. 17. 
shows the long period of relaxation after washing out the 
drug with fresh Tyrode f s. The tone is much below normal but 
eventually recovers when pendular movements reappear* 

If the intestinal strip was kept in the presence of the 
drug for several hours, there was a gradual decrease in tone 
and there was no recovery.

(ii) EFFECT OF CERTAIN IONS ON THE ACTION OF OUABAIN 

Since Ringer (11$,119) showed the necessity of certain ions 
in the bathing fluid, certain of these have been thought to 
play a role in the action of the cardiac glycosides* The 
literature concerning this effect in cardiac and skeletal 
muscle has been reviewed* Several workers, ( 63 , 64 , 66 , 67 , 6 $) 
have shown that the cardiac glycosides exert their full action 
on the heart in the complete absence of calcium* Calcium 
was found necessary for the increased oxygen-uptake of cardiac 
glycosides on heart tissue while potassium and magnesium had 
no effect (73,74)• It was thought of interest to investigate 
the effects of certain of these ions on the action of ouabain 
on the isolated rabbit intestine. 

The effect of ouabain in the absence of calcium in the 
suspending fluid was first investigated* The muscle was washed 
with calcium-free Tyrode’s and a concentrate of the drug also 
prepared in calcium-free Tyrode’s. Sufficient of this con¬ 
centrate was then injected into the muscle bath to give the 
desired concentration. All concentrates were made of such 
strength that not more than 0.2 cc. had to be injected* 

In the first experiment, the muscle was washed thoroughly in 
calcium-free Tyrode’s to bring about the desired relaxation. 
After the relaxation had continued for several minutes, the 
drug was injected* Fig. 19 is a typical tracing selected from 
a series of 14« In only two tracings was there any indication 
of an increase in tone. Fig. 20 shows the effects produced 
when the drug prepared in calcium-free Tyrode's was bathed 
directly on to normal muscle* The effects are a profound

relaxation and a complete cessation of all pendular movements. 
Fig. 20 shows this effect in a concentration of ouabain 
1:500,000. The same effects we re produced with a concentration 
of 1:1,000,000 and concentrations as high as 1:250,000. 

Merely bathing the muscle for several minutes with calcium- 
free Tyrodes was thought insufficient to remove all the calcium 
from within the tissue cells. Much more rigorous procedures 
were used in work done on cardiac tissue. Ranson (63) perfused 
frog hearts for 2 hours in calcium free solutions before app¬ 
lying the cardiac glycoside. Other workers ( 64 , 67 ) perfused 
the hearts with oxalate and citrate to remove all traces of 
calcium from within the tissue. Since it has been shown that 
in mammalian smooth muscle, calcium is almost entirely intra¬ 
cellular, it was decided to subject the muscle strips to 
longer periods of calcium deficiency* A series was therefore 
run on strips of intestine which had been kept in the refriger¬ 
ator for two hours and thereafter at room temperature for 
one hour in calcium -free Tyrodes. During this time the muscle 
was frequently washed with fresh calcium-free Tyrodes. It was 
hoped by this method to remove much more of the calcium than by 
merely bathing for a few minutes as in Fig*19. The ileum 
strips were then arranged as usual in the muscle warmer in 
a calcium-deficient solution. Fig. 21 shows the effect pro¬ 
duced with ouabain 1:1,000,000. It will be seen that the 
intestinal strip still maintained a form of weak and irregular 
movement. When the drug was applied, all movements ceased, and 
the muscle appeared to relax in tone. Upon injection of 0.0lS$ 
calcium chloride, the muscle immediately showed a typical ouabain

response. Similar results were also shown in a higher concent¬ 
ration of ouabain 1:500,000. 

The apparent inability of ouabain to cause an increase in 
tone in the absence of calcium, may not be too surprising, con¬ 
sidering the fact that calcium plays a very important role in the 
normal contraction of muscle. That normally functioning intest¬ 
inal strips responded by relaxation upon the application of 
ouabain in calcium-free lyrodes could well be due to the re¬ 
laxation in tone caused by calcium deficiency alone. h owever 
the relaxation seemed more severe, and pendular movements in¬ 
variably ceased immediately which was not characteristic of 
calcium-deficiency relaxation alone. It is difficult to determine 
whether the drug caused relaxation in muscle previously relaxed 
by calcium deficiency. However, muscle strips subjected to 
calcium-deficiency for several hours seemed to show a significant 
decrease in tone (Fig. 21). It is also difficult to determine 
whether the drug caused relaxation in tone when bathed onto 
normal muscle in calcium-free Tyrodes, since calcium deficiency 
itself caused a profound relaxation of intestinal muscle and 
any relaxation caused by the drug would certainly be masked 
by this. 

It was decided to try to produce a state of tone in muscle 
which was devoid of calcium. This could be accomplished only 
by the removal of other ions. The first series of this type 
was done on muscle bathed in Tyrodes solution from which potassium, 
magnesium and calcium ions had been removed. When intestinal 
strips were bathed in such a solution, they invariably responded 
by increase in tone and cessation of pendular movements.

The effects of ouabain 1:1,000,000 on such a preparation are 
shown in Fig. 23, which is selected from a series of 13® In 
the preliminary tests the results were variable. Some strips 
relaxed immediately on application of the drug. Others re¬ 
laxed only slowly, and still others remained unchanged. It 
was then found that by washing the muscle strip twice with this 
ion-deficient solution, a profound relaxation could be readily 
produced in all of 13 experiments. Fig. 23 shows that on 
application of ouabain, there is a brief latent period, then 
an instant drop in tone followed by subsequent slower relaxation. 

It cannot be said that this relaxation were due to calcium 
deficiency alone, since with three ions absent, the ion balance 
of the muscular tissue would undoubtedly be seriously upset. 

In the next series, potassium was present in the 
Tyrodes, leaving a deficiency of calcium and magnesium. In ileum 
strips so prepared, pendular movements usually continued but 
much slower and irregular with some decrease in tone in most cases. 
Fig. 24, selected from 14 experiments, shows the effect of ouabain 
1:500,000 on this preparation. The drug caused a decrease in 
tone with the cessation of all pendular movements. In this 
series, the drug produced no marked effect in two experiments. 

A similar series, in which the drug was applied in a concentration 
of 1:1,000,000, results were very much like that of the higher 
dosage. 

In order to determine whether the absence of potassium 
or magnesium from the bathing fluid had any effect on the action 
of ouabain, experiments were performed as before, subjecting the 
muscle strips to ouabain in the absence of each of these ions

in turn* Fig. 25 shows that in the absence of potassium, 
the intestinal strip responds by an increase in tone and 
pendular movements continue in normal fashion. In a series 
of four experiments, ouabain 1:1,000,000 produced its usual 
effects, and the absence of potassium seemed to have no 
effect on the action of the drug. 

Removal of magnesium from the bathing fluid has no 

significant effect on the muscle strips (Fig. 26). Ouabain 

> 

showed its characteristic effect in four experiments in 
which magnesium was absent from the solution. 

The drug also exerted its full effect in eight ex¬ 
periments in which both magnesium and potassium were ab¬ 
sent from the bathing fluid simultaneously. Strips of 
intestine bathed for three hours in magnesium and potassium 
deficient Tyrodes, also responded to ouabain. 

From the foregoing work it can be said that ouabain, 
in the concentrations used, produced a cessation of all 
pendular movements of isolated rabbit ileum. In experiments 
where the muscle was bathed in calcium-free Tyrodes for three 
hours (Fig. 21), a significant relaxation in tone resulted 
on the application of ouabain. A marked decrease in tone 
was also shown in experiments where the drug was applied 
to intestinal strips previously subjected to calcium, 
magnesium and potassium deficiency (Fig. 23 ) and to calcium 
and magnesium deficiency (Fig. 2A). A characteristic in¬ 
crease in tone was shown in experiments where potassium 
(Fig. 25) and magnesium (^ig. 26) were absent, and also 
where these two ions were absent simultaneously. Treating

intestinal stips to the absence of potassium and magnesium 
simultaneously for three hours by the same technique as 
for calcium (*ig. 21) did not impede the normal effect of 
the drug* No significant change in tone could be seen 
where the drug was applied after only several minutes of 
calcium deficiency, and it was thought that this procedure 
was not adequate to remove all the calcium from the tissue. 
Thus it appears that ouabain is unable to cause an increase 
in tone in isolated rabbit ileum in the absence of calcium* 


(iii) . EFFECT OF CERTAIN NERVE POISONS ON THE ACTION OF OUABAIN 


Bayliss and Starling (105,106) first observed that the 
pendular movements of the intact intestine were not abolished 
by concentrations of cocaine and nicotine that abolished the 
effect of the extrinsic nerves* They showed that cocainization 
of the intact intestine, or after paralysis of the intrinsic 
ganglia with nicotine, pendular movements persisted but not 
peristalsis* These effects on both intact and isolated in¬ 
testine were also shown by ^'homas and Kuntz (125) and that 
this abolition of nervous response was also accompanied by loss 
of normal response to adrenaline and pilocarpine. They con¬ 
cluded that nicotine, completely paralyzed the nervous mech¬ 
anisms and that intestinal muscle so prepared and treated was 
even more completely denervated than that which was anatom¬ 
ically denervated. Bozler (126) and Emmelen (127) found sim¬ 
ilar results* All these workers used this evidence to conclude 




- 77 - 


that pendular movements are myogenic and peristaltic movements 
are neurogenic. 

It was decided to examine the effect of ouabain on in¬ 
testinal strips previously exposed to these nerve poisons. 

Strips of ileum were exposed to nicotine sulfate 1:5,000 and 
to cocaine hydrochloride 1:4,000 respectively. A few minutes 
later ouabain was applied in the concentration of 1:1,000,000, 
Fig. 2# shows that ouabain exerts its full effect in the 
presence of nicotine sulfate. Fig. 27 shows a similar result and 
the muscle was previously subjected to cocaine hydrochloride. 
These results are typical for six experiments for each of 
the two nerve poisons. In six experiments where cocaine 
alkaloid was used, ouabain also showed its characteristic 
effect, but in these the tone was considerably decreased 
and pendular movements were somewhat diminished by the 
alkaloid. This was thought to be due to the relatively 
higher concentration of cocaine. No attempt was made to check 
the thoroughness of denervation by nicotine and cocaine. 

The concentrations used were those emnloyed by Ihomas and 
Kuntz (125) and are widely quoted in the literature. Acc¬ 
ording to Thomas and Kuntz, intestinal muscle so treated was 
thoroughly denervated. Assuming this to be correct, and since 
ouabain exerted its full activity in the presence of these 
nerve poisons, it seems that the action of ouabain is on the 
muscle itself. This was also the decision of Kolda (117) who 
used atropine.

(iv). EFFECT OF OUABAIN ON ISOLATED INTESTINE SUBJECTED TO ANOXIA 

In 1923, Evans (123) concluded that muscle when in tonus used 
less oxygen than when relaxed because the surface of the fibres 
was reduced. Gross and Clark (129) found that in isolated intest¬ 
ine, cutting off the oxygen supply caused a lowering of tonus 
although pendulum movements continued unaltered and with this loss 
of tone the gut ceased to respond to adrenaline 1:25 million and 
to pilocarpine 1:50 million. Substitution of nitrogen for oxygen 
produced the same effects. The muscle still responded to muscular 
stimulants; KC1 0.065% and BaCl 2 0.045%* They concluded that 
the muscle #as denervated. This was also shown by Gunn and 
Underhill (103) and Klinge (110) and Garry (130). Garry con¬ 
cluded that mere cessation of oxygen supply was not sufficient 
to ensure a critical lack of oxygen within a reasonable period 
of time and that rabbit intestine showed determined persistence 
of action when analysis showed absence of oxygen. Effect of 
adrenalin and histamine were abolished. Evans (132) found that 
during tonic contraction there was no increase in oxygen usage 
in smooth muscle, so there could be no increase in metabolism 
and that there was no increased lactic acid production during 
tonus, but that lactic acid was formed at an accelerated rate 
when the intestine is deprived of oxygen. His opinion was that 
contraction and tonus and perhaps relaxation of smooth muscle 
could be caused by the production of some metabolites (133)* 

The inhibition of respiration by cyanide is also well known. 
In 1910, Batelli and Stern (134) suggested that cyanide ex¬ 
erted its action by inactivating oxygen which seemed to act as 







? 


- 80 - 


the hydrogen acceptor. Evans (135) showed that relaxation of 
cyanide on intestine was very similar to that of intestine sus¬ 
pended in oxygen-free Tyrodes solution. Using M^L500 NaCN, he 
showed that cyanide, like exclusion of oxygen, caused the color 
of methylene blue to fade in tissue cells. Schmitt (136) showed 
that 0.001M NaCN inhibited respiration of frog intestine by 
78% and that 0 f 005M NaCN gave 99% inhibition of respiration of 
frog nervous tissue. Johnson (137) attributed the action of 
cyanide to a disturbance in the equilibrium of cellular oxidation 
reduction reactions. Garry (138) found that NaCn 1:140,000 gave 
a fall in tone and a cessation of rhythmical movements comparable 
with that of oxygen lack. Friedenwald and Buschke (139) have 
shown that NaCN 2 x 10“^ M abolished the effect of a small dose 
of epinephrine and that 6 x 10”^ M abolished the normal peris¬ 
talsis. Stotz and workers, (140,141) have shown that the cyanide 
ion combines in vitro with cytochrome oxidase and interferes with 
the utilization of molecular oxygen by the tissue oxidation 
reduction systems. The point of attack was not the cytochrome c 
but the oxidase. This was also shown by Horecker and Kornberg 
(142) and Alboum and Tepperman (143)* 

It was thought of interest to investigate the action of 
ouabain on rabbit intestinal strips which had previously been 
subjected to anoxia, both by shutting off the air supply and by 
application of cyanide. Fig. 22 shows that on shutting off the 
air, there is a drop in tone, but pendular movements continue 
but somewhat less vigorously in isolated rabbit ileum. On in¬ 
testinal strips subjected to anoxia for 10 minutes, ouabain 
exerted its full effect. Fig. 22 is typical of eight experiments.

In four experiments in which the muscle strips were subjected 
to anoxia in this manner for one-half hour, ouabain appeared 
to exert its full effect. Two experiments were then performed 
in which anoxia continued for one hour. Before the end of the 
one-hour period, pendular movements had become very irregular 
and irratic. The drug, then applied, caused the usual response 0 
In two experiments in which muscle strips were kept in Tyrodes 
at 3$°C for three hours with no oxygen supply, ouabain failed 
to cause any increase in tone. However, after this long period 
of oxygen deficiency, all movement had ceased, and strips so 
prepared failed to recover in one-half hour after the air was 
turned on. They were believed to be in very poor condition. 

Thus the effects of ouabain on rabbit ileum were not impeded 
by anoxia lasting as long as one hour* 

Similar effects were shown with cyanide. Fig. 29 is chosen 
from a seried of 5 experiments and shows that the action of 
ouabain was not impeded by NaCN in a concentration of 1:1,000,000. 
This is 10 times as large as the concentration found by 
Friedenwald and Buschke (139) to abolish the action of a small 
dose of adrenalin. Cyanide in this concentration decreased 
pendular movements slightly. Fig. 30 shows the effects of ouabain 
on ileum strips previously subjected to NaCN in a concentration 
of 1:30,300. This tracing is chosen from 13 experiments. 

Cyanide at this concentration caused a sharp drop in tone, and 
pendular movements ceased. The intestinal strip was completely 
relaxed. Ouabain then caused an increase in tone which appears 
to be significant, and which occurred in all experiments, 

(Fig. 30). After washing the tissue with fresh Tyrodes, no

period of relaxation ensued which was characteristic of the re¬ 
covery from ouabain (Fig. 17). In the cyanide-ouabain series, 
no relaxation followed after washing with fresh Tyrodes, but the 
muscle recovered rapidly. 

This ability of ouabain to act in the presence of cyanide 
was also shown with high concentrations of cyanide, 1:20,000. 

In a series of five experiments using this concentration of 
NaCN three responded by an increase in tone. The two that did not 
respond were removed from a freshly killed rabbit and placed 
immediately in the apparatus. All other muscle in the cyanide 
series were kept in the refrigerator for at least two hours be¬ 
fore use. It was noticed throughout this work that strips of 
ileum freshly removed from the rabbit and placed in the apparatus 
often responded differently from strips which had been stored in 
the refrigerator for two hours or more. Freshly prepared strips 
often reacted to anoxia by a decrease in tone, while strips stored 
for two hours showed an increase in tone when the air was shut 
off. Some workers have noted that shutting off the oxygen supply 
caused a decrease in tone (133,138) while others reported in¬ 
creased tone (139). 

In a series of six experiments, intestinal strips responded 
to ouabain after having been subjected to a massive dose of 
eyanide 1:10,000. Evans (133) reported that NaCN M/1300 produced 
an effect in isolated intestine similar to that of oxygen lack. 

This concentration is equivalent to 1:30,300 for NaCN. Garry 
(138) reported the same effect for 1:140,000. The concentrations used 
in this work can then be considered to cause severe anoxia and 
ouabain 1:1,000,000 appeared to cause a significant increase

in tone

The relaxation caused by cyanide, apparently could not be 
prevented by ouabain, however. In two experiments in which 
ouabain 1:1,000,0C0 and cyanide 10:1,000,000 were applied 
simultaneously to normally functioning muscle, a characteristic 
relaxation of cyanide ensued. This was also characteristic when 
a large dose of ouabain 9:1,000,000 was given with cyanide 10: 
1,000,000. On strips previously exposed to ouabain, cyanide 
10:1,000,000 caused only a small decrease in tone in two experiments, 
while a concentration of 1:20,000 caused complete relaxation of 
muscle strips contracted by ouabain. 













B. EFFECT OF OUABAIN ON INTACT INTESTINE OF THE RABBIT 


To complement the in vitro work, it was thought of interest 
to investigate the effect of ouabain on the intestine of the 
intact rabbit. In similar studies on dogs, Hamet (147,14&) 
showed that the drug relaxed the intact intestine. 

(a) Method 


(i) Apparatus 

The apparatus was of the balloon-water-manometer type, a 
modification of that described by Krop and Loomis (144) and 
Jackson (145)* When blood pressure was recorded, the technique 
described by Jackson (146) was used. The water-manometer was 
modified in that a hollow glass bulb was used as a float. This 
fit loosely into the manometer cylinder. It was floated up by 
the rising water during peristaltic activity and was subsequently 
pulled down by the surface tension when the water receded during 
intestinal relaxation. This glass float was attached to a sensitive 
recording lever. To the manometer was attached a fine rubber 
catheter, with a small balloon at the end. This catheter ran 
through two arms of a T-tube at right angles, leaving the 
third arm free. 

(ii) Procedure 

Rabbits were anaesthetized with pentobarbital in an ear vein 
and the abdomen opened. A longitudinal incision about 1 cm. long 
was made in the ileum about 10 cm. above the caecum. The balloon 
was then inserted through this incision and pushed upwards into

the ileum about six inches. The two horizontal arms of the T-tube 
were then inserted into the intestine and the cut ends tied around 
the arms. The rubber catheter passed out the third arm at right 
angles. This T-tube was found useful for the passage of fluid 
material down the intestine, preventing its emptying into the 
body cavity. The incision was then stitched, leaving the one 
arm of the T-tube protruding through, carrying the catheter which 
ran to the manometer cylinder. 

(iii) Method of Administration 

The ouabain was injected in sterile saline in an ear vein, 
or in the cannulated femoral vein. In preliminary work, the drug 
was found very toxic proving fatal to several rabbits. It was 
then found that large rabbits were apparently more resistant to 
the toxic effects of the drug than were small animals. Rabbits 
weighing 2.5 to 4.5 Kg. were therefore used for this investigation. 
The drug was injected according to the following procedure: 

0.05 Mgm. per Kg. was first injected over a ten-minute period. 

Then an additional 0.05 mgm. per Kg. was given twenty minutes 
later over a five minute period. This latter dose was usually 
required to give a marked effect. Many of the largest rabbits 
were given an initial dose of 0.1 mgm. per Kg. without evidence 
of toxicity. 

(b) Results 


Fig. 31 shows the effects of ouabain 0.05 mgm. per Kg. on 
the intestine of the anaesthetized rabbit, and is typical of 
16 experiments. The drug decreased the tone and stopped all move-

ment of the small intestine. These effects are similar to those 
produced by Hamet in dogs. In three experiments, physostigmine 
1 mgm. per Kg. was injected during the ouabain relaxation. The 
intestine responded normally to the physostigmine showing greatly 
increased tone and powerful peristaltic activity. When the effects 
of this parasympathetic stimulant wore off, the intestine again 
showed a typical ouabain relaxation. 

An attempt was then made to prepare a denervated intestine 
in situ. Large rabbits were used. Artificial respiration was 
used as a routine according to the technique of Riedel and Huston 
(1A9). All drugs were injected into the cannulated femoral vein. 

The vagus on either side was isolated, clamped in a shielded 
electrode and cut. The vagus was then stimulated for ten-second 
intervals every three minutes by an inductorium. This vagal 
stimulation caused increased peristaltic activity. Nicotine was 
then injected at intervals in small doses, vagal stimulation 
continuing as before. It was possible to inject sufficient nicotine 
to just abolish the vagal effect on the intestine, indicating the 
inactivation of nervous mechanisms. All peristaltic movements had 
by this time ceased, since peristalsis is dependent on Auerbach’s 
plexus and the extrinsic nerves. Ouabain was then injected $.1 
mgm. per Kg. slowly into the femoral vein. 

In five experiments performed using this technique, ouabain 
appeared to cause a contraction of the intestine. The effects 
however were not too pronounced except when high dosages were used. 
Due to the few animals used, this cannot be considered conclusive. 

It is suggested that this latter observation is open to further 
investigation, before definite conclusions can be drawn.

DISCUSSION 


The effects of ouabain on normally functioning isolated in¬ 
testine here reported are in accord with the findings of other 
workers (117-122)* The drug caused increased tone with cess¬ 
ation of pendular movements* Effects produced by ouabain in 
low concentrations (Fig. 13) appear to differ only quantitatively 
from that of higher concentrations (Fig. 17). 

The drug appeared incapable of causing any increase in tone 
in the absence of calcium. In muscle strips subjected to calcium 
deficiency for three hours (Fig. 21), ouabain appeared to cause 
a relaxation. This was not apparent in muscle strips bathed only 
for several minutes in calcium-free Tyrodes (Fig.19). However, 
even with this procedure, the drug caused no significant increase 
in tone. In frog hearts bathed in calcium-free Ringers solution 
for two hours, Ranson (63) showed marked therapeutic effects 
on the application of striphanthin. An examination of the trac¬ 
ings shown by Ransom however, reveal that hearts so prepared 
were still beating upon application of the drug. This would mean 
that functional calcium was still present in the tissue as shown 
by Burridge (65). However, on repeating the work and using 
oxalate and citrate to completely remove calcium from within the 
tissue, Ransom (64) showed that strophanthin initiated a beat 
and improved the tone in hearts which were completely relaxed. 

The necessity of calcium for skeletal and cardiac muscle cont¬ 
raction has been more thoroughly studied than f^r smooth muscle. 
Ringer 1 s work (124) was done chiefly on striated muscle. Burridge 
(65) concluded that every beating heart must contain functional 







i 






-90- 


calcium, Clark (150) and Cate (151) showed that increase of the 
Ca 

ratiOifll TTK greatly improved the hypodynamic heart. Ineffic¬ 
iency of cardiac muscle in the absence of calcium has also been 
shown by other workers (152, 153, 154). There is little in the 
literature to indicate the inability of smooth muscle to contract 
in the absence of calcium. Certainly calcium deprivation has very 
profound effects on this tissue, and its failure to contract in 
the absence of calcium regardless of the stimulus applied, would 
not be too surprising. 

It is also considerably easier to determine whether a cardiac 
glycoside is exerting its activity in a calcium-deficient heart, 
because of the characteristic stages of activity of these glycosides 
on heart muscle. This fact was made use of by several workers (66, 
6$). They produced a calcium deficient heart and exposed it to a 
glycoside. Within the approxomate period of A-V block, they added 
calcium and finding that the heart was then in A-V block, concluded 
that the drug had acted in the absence of calcium. No such method 
was possible in smooth muscle studies however, since no character¬ 
istic stages were apparent. 

Friedman and Bine (6£) actually found a slight diminution in 
glycoside activity in the absence of calcium on embryonic duck 
hearts, but attributed it to the relative preponderance of potassium. 
They found that absence of potassium greatly increased the activity 
of the glycoside. This was also found by Clark (155) using frog 
hearts. In studies on smooth muscle, it appeared that absence of 
potassium did not increase the activity of the drug (Fig. 25). The 
lack of response of rabbit ileum to ouabain in the absence of 
calcium, also could not be due to the relative preponderance 






c 






-91- 


of potassium, since ileum strips devoid of both potassium and 
calcium relaxed completely in the presence of the drug (Fig. 23). 
When potassium was present and only calcium and magnesium deficient, 
(Fig. 24 ), the muscle also relaxed. It thus appears that calcium 
deficiency may be responsible for this reverse from the normal 
action of the drug. Friedman and Bine (6£) also found that 
embryonic duck hearts in the absence of both potassium and calcium 
reacted as much to digitalis as did those in Tyrodes solution lack¬ 
ing only potassium. This cannot be said for smooth muscle, since 
the drug acted normally in the absence of potassium (Fig. 25), and 
caused profound relaxation in the absence of both ions (Fig. 23). 

The relaxation shown by adding ouabain in calcium deficient 
Tyrodes to normally functioning rabbit ileum (Fig. 20), is undoubt¬ 
edly due almost entirely to calcium deficiency alone. It has been 
stated that the relaxation seemed to be more complete, than for 
calcium deficiency alone, but this may due to the complete cess¬ 
ation of all pendular movement. It must be remembered that ouabain, 
in all experiments, caused cessation of pendular movement regard¬ 
less of the effect on muscular tone. From Fig, 20, it is evident 
that the drug certainly did not impede the relaxation caused by 
calcium removal from the tissue, but there is little or no evidence 
that it enhanced the decrease in tone. 

From the foregoing study, it appears that ouabain is unable to 
cause contraction in intestinal muscle in the absence of calcium. 

In fact relaxation occurred, and this relaxation was much more app¬ 
arent when the muscle was in a state of tone. It must be remembered 
that ion-deficient solutions such as used in the procedures of 
Fig. 23 and 24, would undoubtedly upset the ion ratio within the 



- 92 - 


cells, and permeability factors may have complicated the picture. 
However, this relaxation is thought to be due to calcium deficiency 
alone, since contraction occurred in response to the drug wherever 
calcium was present (Figs, 17, 1$, 25, 26) and relaxation wherever 
it was absent (Figs, 20, 21, 23, 24)* 

Ouabain then appears to act differently during calcium defic¬ 
iency on smooth muscle than on cardiac muscle. Any comparison of 
the two is greatly complicated by the wide anatomical, biochemical, 
and physiological differences in the two types of tissue. Due to 
greater thickness cardiac muscle would probably be more sluggish in 
response to ion deficiency, cell permeability and metabolic changes. 
In suggesting a mode of action of ouabain on smooth muscle, 
the inorganic ions cannot be ignored. In skeletal and cardiac muscle 
there is evidence to show that cardiac glycosides caused decreased 
potassium in cells, Cattell and Goodell (43) showed that ouabain 
1:500,000 caused a 29$ loss of potassium ion in frogs sartorius. 

This is also substantiated by other work by Cattell (30), Horton 
(44) suggested that lack of potassium might be expected to upset 
the calcium-potassium ratio and cause changes similar to those 
produced by calcium. Absence of potassium in intestinal muscle 
causes increased tone which may be considered due to the relative 
preponderance of calcium. Any explanation of the activity of 
ouabain by this theory, would have to assume that the drug merely 
removed the potassium from within the cells, causing the effects 
of calcium. It would seem then that high concentrations of ouabain 
would have no more effect than a concentration just sufficient to 
remove the potassium. This does not seem to be the case however, 
since high concentrations (Fig. 27), had a much more profound

effect on intestinal strips than low concentrations (Fig. 13), which 
produced effects similar to potassium deficiency alone (see Fig.25). 
Low concentrations of ouabain appeared to cause effects which diff¬ 
ered quantitatively from higher concentrations. It is suggested 
that ouabain may thus have some additional activity or combination 
of activities on smooth muscle, but the role of the inorganic ions, 
especially calcium, must be considered in any explanation of the 
mode of action of ouabain on the isolated intestine® 

Since ouabain in the concentration used, has been shown to 
exert its full effect on rabbit ileum strips in the presence of 
concentrations of cocaine and nicotine which are reported sufficient 
to inactivate the intrinsic nervous mechanisms, it appears that the 
drug exerts its effect directly on the muscle® Figs. 27 and 23 
show that the action of the drug was not impeded by these nerve 
poisons. The thoroughness of denervation was not investigated 
however. The observations are in accord with those of Kolda (117) 
who found that the cardiac glycosides acted on intestinal muscle 
in the presence of the autonomic nerve poisons arecoline, and 
atropine. 

Anoxia caused both by shutting off the air, and by the use 
of cyanide, did not abolish the effects of ouabain on the isolated 

intestine. This would also seem to indicate the drug acts directly 

\ ■ 

on the muscle. Gross and Clark (129) concluded that cutting off the 
oxygen supply for only several minutes caused denervation in isolated 
intestine. The sensitivity of nervous tissue to anoxia has been 
shown by several other workers (110, 139, 136). Fig. 22 shows that 
ouabain acted characteristically after a ten minute period of 
anoxia and it was shown that this action was not abolished by 










- 94 - 


periods of oxygen-lack lasting one hour. Similar effects were 
shown using cyanide (Figs. 29 and 30) and with concentrations 
as high as 1:10,000. With such high doses of cyanide it is reason¬ 
able to assume that the tissue was under severe anoxia, since 
these concentrations are far greater than those reported to ab¬ 
olish all pendular movement (135,13$)* The oxygen-uptake of smooth 
muscle under contraction has been shown to be lews than that of 
the relaxed state (12$). This is thought to be due to the reduced 
surface area during contraction. Johnson (132) showed that the 
energy for contraction of smooth muscle could thus not be depend¬ 
ent on the supply of molecular oxygen, but that oxidation-reduction 
reactions played a role in the contraction of smooth muscle. They 
attributed the action of cyanide to a disturbance in the equil¬ 
ibrium of these cellular oxidation-reduction systems. In view 
of the fact that ouabain caused a significant increase in tone in 
muscle subjected to high concentrations of cyanide, an action on 
cellular oxidation-reduction reactions may be of significant im¬ 
portance in an explanation of the mode of action of the drug. 

Ouabain caused a relaxation of the intact intestine which is 
an opposite effect from that seen in isolated studies. The an¬ 
aesthetic may complicate the picture. In these studies Pentobarb¬ 
ital was used. The depressant effects of the barbiturates on the 
intact intestine as well as the isolated preparation have been inv¬ 
estigated (155, 156, 157). Bozler (15$) found that in dogs an¬ 
aesthetized with barbital, intestinal motility was weak, and per¬ 
istaltic waves could be elicited only after long delays. The same 
difficulty was encountered in this work in which it was usually 


necessary to wait for four hours for peristaltic activity to begin 












- 95 - 


Bozler used morphine to give an immediate response, Scott (159) 
counteracted the depression with physostigmine. No such agents 
were used in this investigation to avoid complication of effects. 

The balloon technique itself has been criticized by many 
authors especially Alvarez (160). Pearcy and Van Liere (161) be* 
lieved that distention of any part of the gastro-intestinal tract 
of dogs produced inhibition of every other portion. Lawson and 
Templeton (162) could find no such effect. Bozler (15$) using a 
lead bolus found that the transport of the bolus took place by waves 
which had the same frequency as those of the normal intestine and 
differed only by greater strength. At any rate, it can be said that 
using the balloon technique on rabbits anaesthetized with pentobarb¬ 
ital, ouabain caused a marked relaxation in the intact intestine 
with the cessation of all peristaltic activity. This is the opposite 
effect produced in intact studies,. 

The condition of the intestine during nausea and vomiting 
seems of importance in an explanation of this action of ouabain. 

The effect of nausea and vomiting on the ileum has been infrequently 
studied. Best and Taylor (163) give a thorough description of 
nausea and vomiting, but do not mention the small intestine. Opp- 
enheimer (164) found that during vomiting induced by apomorphine in 
dogs, the ileum showed increased activity. Following vomiting the 
intestine was quiet. Ingelfinger (165) showed that during artif- 
ically induced nausea in patients, balloons in the descending duo¬ 
denum were pushed backwards into the stomach. From this scant re¬ 
view, it seems that the small intestine is probably activated dur¬ 
ing nausea. 

Ouabain appeared to cause contraction in the denervated in- 






- 96 - 


testine in situ. From the work done, this cannot be considered 
conclusive« The relaxation caused by ouabain on the normal in¬ 
testine may be central in origin, and the action is similar to 
stimulation of the sympathetic nerves. Any contraction caused 
by the denervated intestine could be due to the removal of the 
central effect allowing the drug to exert its characteristic action 
directly on the intestinal musculature. Any such explanation of 
the action would have to assume that the central effect is always 
the dominant one, the direct effect being shown only when extrinsic 
and intrinsic nervous mechanisms have been abolished.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


PART I 

I* Ouabain 1 mgm. per Kg. and 6 ragm. per Kg. produced no signif¬ 
icant effect on the response of either normal or denervated 
gastrocnemius muscle of the rat. 

2. Digitaline Nativelle 1.1 mgm. per Kg. improved the response of 
denervated gastrocnemius muscle, but not of normal muscle. It 
is suggested that this may be due to a stimulant action on 
muscle fibres and a depressent action on the myoneural junction. 
This improved response was not considered due to the sensitivity 
of denervated muscle. 

3<> Alcohol in volumes equivalent to that injected with Digitaline 
Nativelle had no effect on the response of either the normal or 
denervated gastrocnemius. This indicated that the effect of the 
above drug was not due to the solvent alcohol. 

4* Digitaline German 30 mgm. per Kg. improved the response of 

normal gastrocnemius but not of denervated muscle. It is sug¬ 
gested that this may be due to improved neuromuscular response. 
Attention is drawn to the fact that this drug contains 50-60% 
saponin. 

5. The above effect of Digitaline German was entirely absent on 
normal gastrocnemius at a dosage of 65 mgm. per Kg. 

6. Ouabain 75 mgm. % on the perfused isolated dog leg caused a de¬ 
crease in contraction tension followed by an irreversible failure 
to respond. % work was done on denervated dogs leg.

tone accompanied by cessation of pendular movements. The effects 
appeared first with a concentration of 1 : 3 , 300,000 and differed 
only quantitatively from higher doses such as 1:1,000,000, the 
concentration chiefly used in this investigation. 

$. Ouabain 1:1,000,000 on strips of ileum subjected to calcium de¬ 
ficiency for several minutes caused no increase in tone. 

9. Ouabain applied to muscle subjected to calcium deficiency for 
three hours caused a decrease in tone. 

10. Muscle strips functioning normally and subjected to ouabain 

1:1,000,000 to 1:250,000 responded by relaxation with cessation 
of pendular movements. It was assumed that this relaxation 
was due almost entirely to that of calcium deficiency and that 
ouabain could not impede the decrease in tone due to the re¬ 
moval of this ion. 

11. Ouabain caused a sharp decrease in tone in intestinal strips 

previously bathed twice with a fluid devoid of calcium, mag¬ 
nesium and potassium. 

12. The same effect was produced in muscle bathed in a calcium- 

magnesium free solution. 

13* Ouabain exerted its full activity in the absence of either mag- 
magnesium or potassium from the bathing fluid. The drug acted 
normally also when both these ions were absent at the same time. 
Intestinal strips bathed in a potassium-magnesium deficient 
solution for three hours responded to the drug by an increase 

in tone. 

14. It is suggested that ouabain was unable to cause contraction in 

isolated rabbit intestine in the absence of calcium. 

15. Activity of the drug was not abolished by concentrations of 




< 









- 99 - 


nicotine and cocaine which were considered by many authors to 
completely denervate intestinal muscle. The action of the drug 
thus appears to be directly on the muscle* 

16. The drug exerted an effect on intestinal strips subjected to 

anoxia, both by shutting off the oxygen supply and by treatment 

with cyanide. It is suggested that anoxia was so severe by 
these methods to inactivate nervous mechanisms and also to have 
a marked effect on the muscle itself. 

17. On the intact intestine of the rabbit, ouabain 0.05 mgm. per Kg. 

to 0.01 mgm. per Kg. caused a decrease in tone and cessation of 

peristaltic movments, confirming the work of Hamet on dogs. 

1$. On the intact intestine denervated by nicotine intravenously, 
ouabain appeared to cause contraction of the intestine. In¬ 
sufficient work was done to make this conclusive. 

19• The effect of ouabain on the intact intestine may thus be central 
in origin, the contraction effect characteristic of isolated 
studies would thus be apparent only on the denervated intestine 


in situ....
