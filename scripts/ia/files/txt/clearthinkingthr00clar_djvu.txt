CHAPTER 1 


PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS 

Purpose of the Study .- In many quarters the present trend in geom¬ 
etry teaching is to emphasize the reasoning process, mathematicians 
have frequently stressed the discipli ary powers - the rigid training 
in reasoning - inherent in deino' strative geometry. A method of teach¬ 
ing geometry in order to secure the best possible tra. sfer of this 

improvement of reasoning ability has been ably outlined by Harold baw- 
2 

cett . Tc what extent does actual teaching practise in Alberta produce 
such results? Does our teaching of demonstrative geometry develop clear 
thinking, in geometric and non-geometric material?” These are the main 
questions this study attempts to answer. 

In Alberta in September, 1940, a new textbook^ in Geometry 1 was 
introduced. This course was first year high school demonstrative geom¬ 
etry, preceded by geometry in the last year of the intermediate school 
for 65 minutes a week. This text contained many clear invitations to 
teachers to lead their classes from reasoning in geometric material to 
the same kind of reasoning in non-geometric material. It stressed many 
of the important elements of reasoning; the importance of definition, 
role of assumptions, kinds of reasoning indirect argument (called 
argument by elimination), argument by emphasis, if-then reasoning, some 

i\ 

fallacies . At the same time, in an article which appeared in the 
Alberta Teachers’ Association magazine, September 1940 issue, teachers 
of the province were urged to stress the form of reasoning used in

geometry and to apply that form wherewer applicable, to non-geometric 
material. To what extent were teachers doing thie? How eucceeeful were 
euch attempts ae were made? What were the factors involved? Thie study 
attempts to provide tentative answers to these questions. 

The Scope of the Study .- Tests and questionnaires were used to secure 
information. There were ^ive tests in geometry and reasoning, a copy 
of Otis B Higher Examinati n of Mental Ability, and a record sheet supp¬ 
lied for each pupil who participated. Each teacher received an instruc¬ 
tion sheet and a questionnaire^ - . 

In area the etudy wa6 originally planned to cover six provinces; 
British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia. 
Some nine hundred pupils were originally arranged for. The precent 
analysis of the results of this study deals with Alberta only. 

In Alberta two groups were selected. One included 8 schools 
and about 160 participating students. This group of schools had taught 
Geometrylin 1940-41. A second group of 14^ pupils, as many as possible 
from the same schools as this first group, was also selected. This 
group had not taken Geometry 1. Many were taking Algebra 1. In Alberta 
it is optional whether Algebra 1 or Geometry 1 shall be studied in Grade 
X or Grade YA. Hence some schools would be teaching Algebra 1 and some 
Geometry 1, while larger schools would teach both, in any given year. 

In all, 17 different schools participated. Classes were, on the 
average, small. The two groups were selected to serve as an experiment¬ 
al and as a control group. 

Materials Used .- Tests were designed to evaluate the students’ mastery 
of a hieraeny of abilities. In general, it was assumed that the

development of the ability to reason by a study of geometry went through 
theso Btages. A pupil might advance tnrou^h this hierarchy to any stage 
and of course might have only partial matery of any on3 stage.

The ability to apply these generalized principles

Test _1V Part 1 and 'Teat V attempt to determine the transfer of 
reasoning ability to non-geometric material and were the particular 
concern of this portion of the study* The remainder of the tests were 
analyzed by Mr. L. Pallesen, B.Sc. of Botha, Alberta. 

In general, the ability to reason might conceivably be afffeeted 
by two main factors: 

1. mental ability 

2. Training (in geometry or other courses). 

The study wae designed to determine the results actually achieved and 
the relative importance of each of the above factors* 

Mental Ability of tne G-roups .- Mental ability was measured by the Otis 
Higher Examination of hentrl Ability, Form 3. Each participating stu¬ 
dent took this test, being allowed $0 minutes. The best comparative 
measure of mental ability provided by the test are the raw scores i.e. 
the number of items correctly finished by the student. Tnese scores

give o comparative rating of the students' ebil^/- to think in terms of 
symbols, to hold one or more ideas in eonsciouenees while interrelations 
between them are secured, and other similar features of mental ability. 
"Mental ability is measured by the iddividual's score in the test" (Man¬ 
ual of Directions and Kay, pag9 J>) 

On this basis, the non-geometry goup has a mean score of 45. 5 
and the geometry group a mean score of 45.0. Tabular results are set 
out below:

The observed difference between the means (0.5) does not exceed 1.08, 
hence this observed difference can be attributed to fluctuation of 


sampling. 


Histogram of the Distributions.

, 









An inspection of tne preceding histograms shows no marked difference in 
the distributions. We may thus proceed on the assumption that tne two 
groups are of equal .mental ability. 

IntellirBBce arid ability to Reason. - To what extent is the ability to 
reason linked with intelligence, and therefore impossible to train? To 
answer this question the score on Test V (see appendix) was correlated 
with mental ability. The score cn Test V was computed as follows; conclu 
sions correct plus reasons correct for these cofcfcect conclusions minus 
the irrelevant reasons added for these conclusions. This score was 
correlated with rew score on Otis B Higher Examination of mental Ability. 
The results were: 

Geometry Group . Non-geometry Group 

: r =0.46 N = 144 r ^ 0.*7 N = 1?1 

Standard error in r ^ 0.07 Standard error in r z 0.08. 

A statistical test indicates that there is no significant diff¬ 
erence between these two correlation coefficients. 

These results compare with similar results obtained by the P.E.A. 
which secured a correlation of 0.^6 between the score on their test 

“Certain Aspects of Logical Reasoning" and intelligence. Again, Edward 
1 

M.Glazer obtained correlations of 0.^4 and 0.^7 between the Otis In¬ 
telligence test scores and the "Applications of Logical Reasoning" test 
of the P.E.A. The P.E.A. tests mentioned above are similar in form to 
Test V of this study, so these results all tend to demonstrate a mild 
degree of relationship between mental ability and ability to reason. 
Mental ability is one factor, but only one, in ability to reason. Tnere 
must be others, or the above coefficients of correlation would be 
higher.

Trainin and Ability to Reason. - Having establisned the equality of tne 
two groups in average mental Ability, we must now consider training, the 
other important factor which might affect ability to reason. 

Clear thinking could readily be developed by parents tnrough the 
home training of their children. While this may occur in a few instances 
there ie no reason to believe that it is widespread or that it would 
affect one group more than the other. Similarly, other out-of-school in¬ 
fluences such as clubd and study groups may improve tne reasoning of some 
studaits, but a^air. there is no reaeon to believe that this effect is 
g»*e at or that it affects the groups unequally. 

Turning to the training received in school, we find that many 
factors operp^e here. Chief among them is the interest end ability of 
the teacher in attempting to develop clear thinking. Every subject 
offers opportunities for developing the ability to reason. The impor¬ 
tance of definition is nowhere so apparent as in Social Studies. Con¬ 
sider this statement from a social studies manual: n The Russo-Finnish 
war (of 1959) ended with a harsh treaty 11 , or the wording of Article 11 

of the League of Nations Covenant M war or threat of war shall-". 

What is a harsh treaty, or a tnreat of war? The r61e of assumptions 
stands out clearly in sociology. All men have one vote (equality). 

What assumption lie6 behind that? Science presents innumerable oppor¬ 
tunities fbr demonstrating the methods and limitations of inductive 
reasoning, and the fallacies that can arise. The alert teacher can 
readily illustrate that one exception disproves a p roposition, and no 
number inductively establisne.s ii. He can illustrate the fommon fallacy 
of arguing (inductively) from too few instances, and con demonstrate the 
weaknesses of argument by analogy. In mathematics (other than geometry)

many possibilities present themeexvis. By defining a power, a rule for 
multiplying powers can be secured, and the fact that a changed definition 
changes this rule (conclusion) can be shown. The error of assuming the 
conclusion can be illustrated very often w ien students are asked to prove 
ar. identity and they begin by treating it as an equation. 

All the above examples of training clear thinking, and ^any others 
ce\ be brought out by the alert teacher in subjects other than geometry. 

In geometry itself all of these Ban readily be stressed. To what extent 
ie this dene? 

There i.3 some reason to believe that training clear thinkers is 
not jAppermoot in the minds of most oeachers. In Alberta only with the 
introduction of the new text in Geometry 1 was any direct emphasis laid 
on this aepect of teaching, 'dost teachers are more interested in im¬ 
parting knowledge (facts) thar in training students how to use these 
logically. Whether the teachers of geometry as a group are irnre con¬ 
cerned with this latter aspect is not known. This study should show 
whether students who have taken Geometryl are better able to reason, 
but the foregoing discussion indicates that it cannot hope to deter¬ 
mine whether the subject itself or the method of teaching is res¬ 
ponsible, except by comparison of results from different teachers of 
geometry. 

Sex difference? in the Groups. - Anotherpoeeible difference in the 
groups is sex. It is usually assumed that girls’ interests do not 
incline towards mathematics as much as boys’. This is attributed to 
the traditional vocations commonly assigned to boys and girls b 2 ^ the 
public, to the special emphasis on home-making, which is considered the 
role of girls^to womanliness and to similar factors. If the groups

are equal in the proportion of each eex we need not inquire into the

groups can be considered 


equivalent for this factor. 

Having establisned the equality of the Geometry and Non-geometry 
groups in mental ability and sex, we snail now examine their perfonm- 
ance on the teste in an effort to answer the questions asked at the be¬ 
ginning of this chapter. 











CHAPTmn 11 


ANALYSIS UF xLoT IV hLSULTS. 

Test _1V, Pert 1 was designed to determine whether the student 
had generalized the principles of reasoning he would likely encounter 
in his study of geometry. Only those principles which derive from the 
Alberta text were included, but it covered most of the important prin¬ 
ciples of deductive reasoning and some fallacies. Each statement was 
matched with its contradictory*ae far as possible, e.g. item 1. "There 
is only one possible definition for a word" and item 21 "There roay be 
several definitions for a word". Thus out of 5^ items there were 17 
principles or fallacies stated. Students were asked to mark each true 
or false. The possible results were, for each p«ir (such as item 1 
and item 21) 

(a) They could be marked correctly: 1 - False, 21 - True. 

(l) They could be marked both true, or both false. 

(c) They could be marked exactly wrong: 1 - True, 21 - False. 

In classifying these, (a) was called correct, (b) guess and (c) wrong. 

The statu8 of (b) is in doubt. The student may know nothing 
about the principle in question and be guessing, or he may have been 
able to recognize the p ositive (true) statement ps correct but not its 
contradictory. At all events his result is worse than correct but 
better than wrong. Sucn results are galled "guesses" for convenience, 
but this word is not a good descriptive term as the above discussion in¬ 
dicates. 

The 17 principles cf Test _1V were classified under heading 
which would correspond to those of Test V. A statistical test was 
applied to the results obtained by the Geometry and Non-geometry groups 

1. Two propositions arG contradictory if one must be true and one must be 
false. From knowledge of the truth or falsity of one the truth or falsity 
of its contradictory can oe inferred.

The interpretation of the results of the Chi squared test is as follows 

"If Pis small, the divergence of fact from theory is significant of some

real effect end cannot be attributed to fluctuations of sampling”. An¬ 
other way of putting thi<* is: proceed on the hypothesis th&t the study of 
geometry and ability to reason are independent. If this hypothesis is 
correct our data give results which would be obtained 25 times in 1000 
(P -0.025). Hence we are justified on these grounds in rejecting tne 
hypothesis! If P j> 0.05, according the usage of R.A. Fisher, it is not 
safe to reject the hypothesis. The smaller is P, the safer we are in 
using the observed results.

The differences in the results shown in the above figures are 
statistically significant and indicate that the non-geometry group 
showed a definite superiority. Possibly the study of geometry ccnfueed 
the commonsense reaction of the untrained mind as regard 3 this particu¬ 
lar principle. 

T No. 5 Changing the meaning of one of the words in the Btatemeht of 
a definition has the effect of changing the definition. 

F No. 5? A definition remains unchanged even if the meaning of one of 
the words in the definition is changed.

This car. be interpreted to mean that the probability is 863 out of 
100C that any differences in the groups above can be attributed to 
errors in sampling. An inspection of the table of percentage re¬ 
sults shows considerable agreement. Here it appears that geometry 
teaching made no significant difference in ability to redognize this 
principle. 

F No. 8 A good dictionary will always settle any dispute about 
the particular definition ofa ward to use. 

T No. 16 Since a dictionary usually gives several possible defini¬ 
tions of a word, it does not always settle all disputes about the 
meaning of a word.

Obviously no significant difference between the groups occurr¬

low number of completely correct responses. Item No. 9 is possibly 

worded poorly. It might better have been M -agreed about the 

meaning of a word in an argument— 11 . An observation of the answer 
papers showed that most students marked No. 25 as true. Evidently 
the students of both groups are rt authority conscious”, and regard

factors may have produced the generally poor results. 

T No. 20 If one changes a definition, the conclusion which follows may 
also be changed even though the argument is logical. 

F No. 23 If an argument is logical then the changing of a definition 
should have no effect on the conclusion of the argument.

It may be noted that in each separate principle the non-geometry group is 
slightly superior. 

111. Indirect Argument, including these items. 

T No. 5 To obtain a conclusion in an indirect argument, all the possibili¬ 
ties must be considered and all but one of these possibilities must be eliminated, 
F No. 52 In any argument by elimination of possibilities it is enough to 
eliminate all but two of the possibilities in order to reach the conclusion.

Here the geometry group shows considerable superiority. 


B osei bly this can be attributed to the fact that indirect argu¬ 
ment is not so common as some tther kinds of logical reasoning* 

If so, this would indicate that the training in geometry can help 
develop logical reasoning. The wording of item No* 5 could have 
been improved by inserting the word “valid 15 before “conclusion 55 *

While group comparisons are not statistically significant, an examina¬ 
tion of the results of both groups is interesting. The uniformity 
of scores by each group under each heading, and the low p ercentage 
correct combined with the high percentage of wrong and guess, indicates 
the kind of result attributable to chance markings of these items. 

One might conclude that the concept considered in these items is beyond 
the pale of the students in our groups.

No statistically dgnificant findings are possible here, but 
it is of interest to note the relatively low correct score that both 
groups made. That the geometry group has much room for improvement in 
recognition of this seemingly elementary principle is evident. However,

X. Techinically False 7 - 29 No satietically significant differ¬

An examination of Table 1 Shows that the geometry gimup was 
superior on two items and the non-geometry on two. Each groupr showed 
a superiority in one principle. In the majority of cases the result 
was negative* no statistically significant differences were exhibited. 

Such differences as occurred for these cases afeould be attributed to 
errors of sampling or to the hypothesis that geometry or lack of it is 
unrelated to what Test IV measures. 

The evidence points to this general finding* geometry as taught 
to this fcest group, in general does not improve the ability of the stu¬ 
dents to redognize certain principles of logical reasoning. More spec¬ 
ifically, if one regards the non-geometry group as having received equal 
incidental training in logical reasoning except for the added geometry 
course of the geometry group, then the geometry teaching improved the 
recognition of principles of logical reasoning in two instances and 
confused it in two. 

In addition, low correct scores on several items indicate 
either that the items are faulty or that certain principles are neither 
commonsense nor are they being taught in geometry. On certain items the 
results are strikingly similar to those attributable to chance, as in 
throwing a 4-sided dice marked Tf; TT, FF, FT, where TF is the M Correct" 
marking of a pair of statements, FT the "wrong" marking and the other two 
the " guess" marking. The probability of results on a large number of 
throws is to approach the 1*2*1 ratio, and our percentage scores approach 
this in the following items* No. 8 and No. 16 On dictionary definitions 
(see p. 12)^ No. 15 and No. 27 on the validiity of arguments containing 
assumptions (see p. 17). Such items have already been examined for faulti¬ 
ness and show no logical blemishes or faulty aarding. One is forced to the 
conclusion that the concepts stated are beyond the pale of the students con¬ 


cerned

ANALYSIS OF TEST V RESULTS. 

Teat V was constructed to measure ability to reason in non-geom- 
etric material. It included all the principles of reasoning used in Test 
IV . Where teat ^1V attempted to determine whether the student had general¬ 
ized and abstracted the principles of reasoning he uses implicitly in 
geometry. Test V attempted to determine whether he can apply these prin¬ 
ciples to reasoning which ia non-geouetric. 

The test is similar in form to the test "Certain Aspects of Logical 
Reasoning" developed by the 8-year study (P.E.A.). A problem is given, 
conditions are set down in the directions, a choice from three conclusions 
and a choice from twelve supporting reasons is provided. 

The test includes ten problems: 

Problem 2 and 9 on definition 

Problems 3*4 and 6 on definition-conclusion (If-then reasoning) 

Problems 7 and 10 on indirect argument. 

Problems 5 and 8 on converses. 

Problem 1 on "A esuming the Conclusion" fallacy. In addition 
the reasons include all the fallacies used in Test IV . 

The reasons were pre-classified, and so worded that each reason 
was an example of a principle of reasoning or of a fallacy. Of the 120 
reasons, 28 are “ correct" . These is a range of from two to four eorrect 
reasons per problem. Since twelve reasons are given for each problem the 
chance of guessing the correct reasons is small. However, a student has 
one chance out of three of guessing the correct conclusion. Table 2 sets 
out the classification of reasons. Those in brackets are correct reasons 
i.e. thej support the correct conclusion given in the first column. Below 
certain other reasons appear the letter of the incorrect conclusion it 
supports. In two cases an incorrect reason pointedly supports the correct 
conclusion, and these are noted. The right hand columns give the total

number of reasons supporting each conclusion, while the total number of 
reasons in each classification appear at the foot of the table. 

In analyzing the results of this test, we note the following 
possibilities; 

1. Conclusion correct (a) reason correct 

(b) reason wrong 

2. Conclusion incorrect (a) reason correct 

(b) reason wrong. 

An arbitrary method of securing a score on the test can then 
be obtained. For this study it was agreed that the score should be the 
number of correct conclusions, plus the number of correct reasons for 
only these conclusions, minus the number of wrong reasons for only these 
conclusions, provided that the minimum reason score was zero. If a 
student marked the wrong conclusion he secured no points on that problem. 
If he marked the correct conclusion he received one point. To this was 
added the reason score: number right minus number wrong. This gave a 
total possible score of on the test. 

The construction of the test suits it for individual or group 
diagnosis. The results for each school were tallied on a master answer 
sheet. Then from this the reasons chosen were classified. For this 
analysis the correctness or incorrectness of the conclusion was disre¬ 
garded. 

Referring to table 2, the first classification of reasons is 
“General statement of If-then principle". Thwwe were 9 such statements, 

8 of them reasons which supported the correct conclusion. The state¬ 
ment is: “If we accept the assumptions on which an argument is based, 
to be logical we must accept the conclusion which logically follows, 
e ven though this conclusion is not necessarily true". The wording was 
varied slightly for most of the 9 statements. The 14^ students in the

non-geometry group who wrote the test V, chose 125 correct conclueione 
using the above statement correctly as a reason. However, this state¬ 
ment could be used correctly 8 times on each test so the total possible 
score was 8 x 14^ i.e. 1144. This this group answered 10.9!& of the 
possible. Also, there were 174 selections of this statement as a reason 
when the conclusion for the given problems selected was wrong. Hence 
15.2^ of the possible score on " wrong conclusion-correct reason” was 
obtained. This method of presenting the results will be used through¬ 
out, since inter group (but not intra group) comparison is possible*

Applying the Chi square test to the original frequencies in a 
2x2 table of the first two classifications (C.C.C.R. and W.C.C.R.) we 
find x 2 — 0.028 ])~ 1 P - 0.86 and for the second two, 

x 2 - 1.516 \J~- 1 P - 0.22 


The percentage sum given at the side represents the percentage 
of use of the reason, regardless of whether the conclusion is correct. 

Thus the non-geometry group used the general statement of the “If-then" 
principle correctly as a reason 26.1$ of the possible 1144. This disre¬ 
gards the correctness or incorrectness of the associated conclusion chosen. 
It does however, give a statement of the students' sensitiveness to the 
correct reasons involved in the argument. 

The Chi square test indicates no statistically significant differ¬ 
ences between the groups.

The second classification of Table 2 ie "specific statement of If-then prin¬ 
ciple." Since each statement relates to the problem the reader is referred 
to Table 2 and Test Y to examine the items included. A typical example 
is (Problem 4, No.4) " If one agrees that anything brilliantly planned de¬ 
serves admiration and that tne conquest of Norway was brilliantly planned, 
the prisoner'e conclusion follows". The results were:

superiority for the geometry group. 

"Specific Statement of Definition"is of course related to each prob¬ 
lem. By consulting Table 2 and Test V the complete list of such statements 
can be found. A sample (Problem 1 No. 5) is i "The word 'fainter 1 must be 
defined before we can decide whether or not Albert proved that air had 
been removed from the jar".

Chi square test: x 2 = 0.625, 1, P-0.45. 

No differences not attributable to errors in sampling occur here. 

Considering the results from all of the principles of reasoning 
considered so far in Test V, we find for the non-geometry and geometry 
groups: 

1* The actual differences in scores obtained were in all cases 
except one, only such as could be attributed to fluctuations of sampling 
or to the hypothesis that geometry courses and ability to reason (as 
measured by Test V) are independent. 

2. In general both groups have a better mastery of the applica¬ 
tion of specific principles than of the corresponding general principles 
of reasoning. 

Turning now to the remaining principles, which are fallacies: 

Argumentum ad hominem was subdivided into abuse, and attack on 
motives. An example of abuse is problem 1 and- 2 "Only a fool would say 
that air had been removed from the bell jar so Albert couldn't have 
proved that it had". There was one ai ch statement for each problem. The 
results were:

False authority, and the role of experts, is a vital issue in 
our society £oday. It is indeed difficult to decide in just what fields 
an expert is expert. Hence the 9 statements listed under false author¬ 
ity include problem 2 No. 8. "The Principal of the scnool said that air. 
Norquist was operating a restaurant", and probCCm 5 No. 9 * The chair¬ 
man of the banquet, at the conclusion of the address, stated that no 
respectable men were unable to find work nowadays" • The results were:

Technically false statements are often used as reasons. In 
Test V a reason which denied the data of the problem was considered 
technically false, and the sample problem clearly indicates this. 

Thus in problem 10 students were directed to assume that " these are only 
three types of governments in the world today" yet reason 12 states 

" According to the statements Jane Lade in the summary of her report 

there might be many more than just three kinds of governments in the 

world today" • Of the 9 such technically false statements, the results

Again the aarne kind of f inding. 

Considering all the results from Test V, we note that there 
is no statistical basis for differentiating the Non-geometry from the 
Geometry group in performance under any principle. A careful survey 
of the actual performance showa a small superiority for the Geometry 
group for almost every principle. Theconsistency of this superiority 
indicates that geometry teaching may have a small effect on improving 
ability to reason for this group. 

Turning to the percentage of correct conclusions for each 
prin<aple for each group, the following results were obtained;

The test of statistically significantdifferences between the 


non-geometry and geometry groups indicates that (except for one result) 
their performance cannot be differentiated. However, a study of the 
results obtained shows that, while performance wkth each principle of 
reasoning is similar, the geometry group often shows a slight super¬ 
iority. The combined effect of all these slightly better performances 
would indicate that geometry as taught has slightly improved the 
student's ability to reason in non-geometric material. Table 5 and 
the summary marshalls all the relevant factfc.Wi this point, and we note 
that on the 19 applications of principles to a problem, the geometry 
group had a superior performance in 14. The groups were even in per¬ 
formance 4 times, and the non-geometry group showed a slight superior¬ 
ity once (in the false authority fallacy). In selecting conclusions, 
as we have already seen, the geometry group performs better on four out 
of the five principles involved. Thus despite the lack of statistically 
significant differences in any one application of principles of logic 
used as reasons, the weight of evidence points to some superiority of 
the geometry group in the reasoning of Test V. This superiority is 
small, and is not outstanding in any one area. 

A n examination of the results by each group on each separate 
principle shows that all students use specific statements of principles 
as reasons, both correctly and incorrectly, more than they use the general 
statements as reasons. This finding supports the view that there is a 
heirarchy of levels in reasoning in which the specific application of a 
principle of reasoning to a problem precedes the generalization of the 
principle as applied to all such problems.

UHAPT&h IV 


A NALYSIS BE SCHOOLS. 

It hae bean shown that the observed differences in tne perfor¬ 
mance between the Non-geometry and Geometry groups are very email and 
in most cases statistically not significant. The number of cases is not 
unduly small (14} and 159 students), so the actual differences which 
could be found in larger samples would seem to be small. It is now 
proposed to examine the performance of schools within each group. 

A preliminary examination of the original data showed by 
inspection that the range of performance for each group was similar. 

We already know that the average performance also is similar for each 
group. Hence the analysis by schools is confined to the Geometry group. 

The analysis of Test _1V results is set forth in Table IV. The 
8 schools of the Geometry group are labelled A,B,C,D,E, F,G,H. Under 
the heading “ Definitions'* there were three items on Test _1V viz* 

1-21, 5-55 and 8-16. The average number of c n ^ect responses for school 
A is 70.6^, of wrong responses 9»&fo and of “guess" responses 19.6^. 

Since these add up to 10Qj& there were none of these items omitted by 
any etu'snt in this school. Note however, that school G omitted 
of these items, although for the sake of brevity this was not included 
in the table. The rest of the results in the table are presented in 
this manner. 

Under each heading an attempt was made to rank schools in order 
of performance A high correct seore and a low wrong ecfcre were the 
criteria. This ranking was done according to the formala* percent correct 
minus percent wrong divided by 100 (highest rating l). At the end a 
total (weighted) rank was assigned. Thus a heading with 5 items 
(e.g. “Definition") is given three times the weight ef a heading with one

This is a significant finding. Something about the students, teachfing 
or curriculum makes the performance of one school B much better tnan 
that of another school D. An attempt will be made to isolate th4 
factor or factors responsible. 

One interesting result soon becomes apparent. Some schools 
appear “cautious” i.e. their students leave a large number of items 
incomplete if they do not know the answer. An examination of Table 
V will show that school G is very “ cautious”. It may be objected 
that students in schools with many incomplete responses did not have 
sufficient time to complete the test. This hypothesis was rejected 
since an examination of the original data did not indicate that the 
items omitted were largely at the end of the test. Four schools 

are the opposite of cautious, since in each of these schools 
every student attempted every item. It may be that in some schools 
students have been warned of the “ Right minus Wrong” marking of “Tfcue 
False” items. The results from Test V can give evidence on this hy¬ 
pothesis. This is clear in the “Total Score” section of Table 111 , 
where we note that school G has the highest percentage of added (irrel 
evant) reasons. Hence school G cannot be consideedd"cautious? Ratner

thie last hypothesis holds, that the studente are wary of guessing 
on True-False teste, likely because they have been warned of the Right 
minus Wrong scoring. 

The results of Test by schools for the Geometry group appear 
in Table V_l. The letters refer to the same schools as in the analysis 
for Test JLV. The figures in the table give the percentage of possible 
score, and a^Jalready indicated in discussing Test V results, these 
percentages are low, and do not add up to 100$ for Correct and Wrong 
reasons in the same classification. 

An interesting observation is that the students use or select 
more specific reasons (whether correct or wrong) than of the corres¬ 
ponding general reasons* This holds throughout in almost all cases. 
This finding corresponds with the analysis already made for the com¬ 
bined scores for all schools in each group* 

The schools were again ranked, on the reasons correctly used 
minus the reasons incorrectly used, and also on the total number of 
correct conclusions chosen. Under this system of ranking school B 
was again first, school G second and then the remainder bunched far 
behind* 

The total score on Test V gave a similar ranking. The "Con* 
elusions Correct" heading is the p ercentage of possible score. Thus 
school A obtained 44.5$ of the total possible if each student nad 
selected all the correct conclusions. The "Reasons correct for these" 
heading gives the percentage of the possible number of correct reasons 
for only these correct conclusions . Thus school A secured 55$ of the 
numbers of correct reasons which belong.to the 44.5$ of correct conclu¬ 
sions scored on the test. This calculation explains why the total per¬ 
centage score is lower than the " Conclusions correct" score or the

"Reasons correct for these" score. 

The rank on "Total Score" for Test V again places schools B 
and G high. An additional school I ie Included here. It ranks second. 
The results from this school were not at hand when the main analysis 
was made, but a later partial analysis for this school showed tnat it 
ranked very high in Test ]£ results, so)it is brought in for •onsideration 
here. The results then show the schools in order on Total Score for 
Test V as B,I,G,C, etc. 

Consistently, schools B and G have been high.cn Test ^1V and V 
results, no matter how analyzed. School I ranks with school B in test 
V results, so it i^proposed to extend out investigation into the per¬ 
formance of schools B,I and G. It is again noted, that in total score 
on Test V, school B is nearly twice as high in performance as the lowest 
school. 

Does intellignece cause this spread? Already we have found the 
correlation between pupil »ental age and score on Test V to be 0.46, 
P.E. r 0.0*. ThiB shows that intelligence i^s a factor. However, we 
note that school B ranks first in ability to reason (measured by Tests 
IV and V) but 5th in mental ability. School I ranks first in mental 
ability and second in ability to reason. School G ranks 4th in mental 
ability and third in ability to reason. Thus although intelligence is 
a factor it is not the complete explanation. 

Is sex a factor? Usually it is assumed that girls do not reason 
as well as boys. The students of school B consisted of six girls, in 
school G there were 11 girls and 8 boys, and in school I tnere were 15 
girls and 9 boys. Unless we now assume the contradictory hypothesis that 
girls reason better than boys, it appears that sex is not a factor.

Ib year in high school a factor? The results arei 

School B had 5 students in let year, 1 in 2nd year. Ave. 1.17 years. 

School I had 20 " w 2nd year, 1 in Jrd, 1 in 4th. Ave. 2.24 " 

School G M 11 “ N 1st year, 8 in 2nd M 1.42 " 

School D " 20 ■ M let year, 10 in 2nd, 5 “ Jrd “ 1.48 » 

School jt 11 7 rt 11 1st year, 16 w 2nd year, 11 in 

third year, 2 in 4th year Ave. 2.22 " 

School E, the lowest ranking school on Test UT and V and tne 
second lowest in mental ability, has students who nave been in scnool 
as many years as those of school I, second highest school on Test V 
and highest in mental ability. Similarly, school D compares with schools 
B and G. Evidently year in high school contributes little if anything 
to the score obtained on Tests JLV and V. 

Are the courses taken in school a factor? If this were so one 
would expect second and third year students to excel in ability to reason, 
but we have found no clear cut evidence for this. Logical reasoning may 
conceivably be taught in English, or in Social Studies. These are com¬ 
pulsory subjects in Alberta, so all studoits in a given year of high 
school are (except for repeaters due to failure) taking the same unit of 
these subjects. Again, Algebra may have been of some value in training 
logical reasoning. It is possible that some 8 students of school G and 
22 of school I had previously taken Algebra 1. On the other hand some 
15 students in school D and 29 in school E also could have, and on tne 
supposition that they did, the results did not indicate any special value 
for Algebra. While there is no evidence for they hypothesis that other 
courses in school are an important factor t.iere is some evidence against, 
and we can reject the hypothesis. 

By rejecting possibilities in this indirect argument we are 
brought to the remaining possibility—the better performance in schools

B,I and G lies in the teaching* Let ue remember that there may oe 
other possibilities we have not considered. We must also keep in mind 
that mental ability is also a factor which cannot be eliminated. 

The training of the teachers was as followei 

School A — 

" B — 

1 G— University degree (B.A.) 

" D— University degree. Majored in Mathematics. 

" E— University degree (B.Sc.) 

ii jr — 

M G— Some work towards University degree. 

" H—University degree (B.Sc., M.A., H.S.T.D.) 

M I— University degree (B.A ., M.A., High School Teacher's Diploma) 

An inspection of training received indicates that it is not a 
differentiating factor. A 11 these teachers were experienced. Age is 
not a factor. The teacher of school G has had many years experience 
and is beyond middle age, t ie teacher of school 0. is relatively young 
and less experienced. The teachers of schools E and I fall midway befc 
Ifcween these extremes. Bex of teacher is not a factor* Lady teachers 
instructed in schools B and D, and male teachers in schools G and E. 

Schools D,E, and F, which fall low in the ranking on ability to 
reason, also happen to have low ranking in mental ability and are scnools 
with relatively large classes (52 to 57 pupils). This is inserted here 
to point out that no reflection on the teachers of these schools is in¬ 
tended. It may also point to size of class as a factor in determining 
a school'e performance in ability to reason. This finding should be set 
against the fact that schools C and H had very small classes and did not 
rank with the highest schools. 

We are finally driven to the teacher's aims and methods as a 
differentiating factor. Here we shall let the leacnere speak for them¬ 
selves in statements we quote. Although this method is subjective, it 
gives the teacher's opinion, of his (or her) aims and methods. Some of 
these may well be worth emulation#

Teacher of school I : 

"In the fall of 19^0* while waiting for the new text 'Geometry 
for Today' by Dr. Cook, to be issued, the class discussed and prepared 
a system of honors awards which was adopted for the students of the 

—-High School. Throughout this discussion, the members 

of the class became familiar with the concepts of (definition*, 'assump¬ 
tion', and 'theorem'. As the course proceeded, emphasis was placed on 
these concepts, both in geometrical and non-geometrical material. The 
class became aware of the various fallacies which may occ^r in reasoning 
and some pupils became very keen in their analysis of situations which 
came up for discussion* I am of the opinion that this emphasis in tne 
Geometry 1 course probably explains in part at least the results found". 

Summary of the statement of teacher of school Cr. 1 

rT ?he students were intelligent and possessed a good 
'esprit de corps 1 . n u* class commenced the study of Geometry 
1 with two concepts as fundamental: first, that geometrical 
and all reasoning was practical, desirable and the crown of 
human achievment. Second, we considered reasoning ability as 
a universal gift to humanity: it was assumed that those who di 
little to display the ability were but undeveloped add requir¬ 
ed more practice than others. 

Problems were encouraged which were intensely related 
to the local situations. The teacher considered he had reach¬ 
ed an efficient state of class attitude when most o^ his teach 
ing was the direct result of class request rather than of tea¬ 
cher imposition or demands of the course.

CHAPTER V 


CONCLUSIONS A ND SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY. 

On the basia of tne foregoing analysis we are now able to 
consider the findings. It must be borne in mind that these apply to 
the year 19^1 and may not now hold. The samples on which they are 
based is small. The teste which attempt to evaluate certain features 
of logical reasoning may not be valid and reliable, although by the very 
nature of their construction Tests lV,Badt 1 and Test V should be valid. 
With these reservations in mind we will consider the findings. 

The most striding finding is that on the average the geometry 
group is not superior to the non-geometry group in recognizing prin¬ 
ciples of logical reasoning. Also, it is not superior in applying 
these principles in non-geometric material, although the slight con¬ 
sistent superiority exists in toto, even though the actual partial 
differences are not statistically significant. The negative and 
rather dismal finding is that geometry, as taught on the average is 
not dfeveloping the ability to reason in non-geometric material. 

A heirarchy of difficulty in reasoning was found. Mr. L. 
Palleeen, in the analysis of Tests 1 to _1V, found that a knowledge of 
principles or theorems was an easier and prior stage to the applica¬ 
tion of those theorems to geometric problems. Similarly, this portion 
of the study finds tnat a recognition of principles of logical reason¬ 
ing is an easier and prior stage to their application in a specific 
fashion in non-geometric material. A still more difficult stage is 
the application of the generalized principle in non-geometric material. 
Evidence for these findings is the generally higher score on Test 1Y 
than on specific reasons of Test V, both of which were higher than 
the score on general reasons of Test V. Thus, recognition of the need 
for definition was about of the possible score (Test Vf_) ,

application of a generalized statement of the need for definition 
(e.g. A changed definition may lead to a changed conclusion even though 
the argument from each is logical) was about 15^6 of possible score on 
Test Y. So it was, in general, throughout. The hierarchy of difficulty 
may then be summarized in increasing difficulty* Recognition, specific 
application, generalized application. 

This finding has far-reaching pedagogical implications. Drill 
and instruction in the generalized statement of a principle of logical 
reasoning will lead only to recognitio n. Beyond that the student must 
be given problems to solve, in order to malster in stages the specific 
and generalized application of the principle. T’nis is, of course, in 
line with current educational practice* learning by doing. 

Certain schools were able to develop this ability to reason 
better than other schools. At the extremes, the test scores were alfr 
most twice as high. Very significant wa^ the finding of Mr. L. Pallesen 
in this connection. His independai t investigation of the results of 
Tests 1 - ^1V showed that the same schools were also the highest in 
reasoning in geometric material. This demonstrates that the ability 
to reason in non-geometric material is not developed at the expense of 
geometry as such. 

These schools which successfully developed the ability to 
reason were the subject of special eonsideration. A careful analysis 
of all the factors which could be reasonably considered as causes led to 
the rejection of all but two. Theywere the mental ability of the student 
and the attitude (aims and methods) of the teacher. Since mental ability 
is considered a constant in students of the age under consideration, tne 
variable factor* remaining is the attitude of the teacner. The kind of 
attitude (aims and methods) required is quoted for tne teachers who were

actually associated with high student ability to reaeon. 

Finally, the rejected possibilities indicated that training 
and scholarship of the teacher are not enough to develop the ability 
to reason in their students. Evidently the teacher must consciously 
want to develop this ability. He must be akfcet to the possibilities, 
and must actively think about the methods he might use. It is quite 
possible that sometimes teachers who have good training and qualifica* 
tions are inclined to “rest on their oars". This will not do. 

Certain features of this study deserve a more extended investi¬ 
gation. Thus the question of whether geometry is a suitable vehicle for 
the evelopment of logical reasoning might be investigated in small 
schools where all students (both non-geometry and geometry) have tne 

same teacher. The methods involved could be further investigated by 

1 

having one group of schools teach geometry in a directed manner, check¬ 
ing the results against a control group. Sex differences could be 
analyzed by comparing the performance of all the boys against all tne 
girls in a given group.

QUESTIONNAIRE 


The study in geometry in which you are participating aims to discover, 
or selected provinces, what geometric concepts have been mastered by 
he pupils, and how well the pupils can reason in geometric and non¬ 
eometric material. To throw light on these questions it is necessary 
o know what references teachers are using, the methods teachers use 
n presenting geometry in the classroom, and the like. Vith this in 
ind you are requested to fill in the following questionnaire. 


Does each student have a copy of a text? 
Name of text student uses.

What are your special qualifications for the teaching of mathematics? 
(University training, special summer courses, etc.) 


In addition to geometry, what other subjects do you teach? 


You are asked to examine the following quotations to see which most 
closely describes your own ideas of the aim of teaching geometry. 

Then indicate your first choice with a 1. If you consider the others 
would be second and third best, indicate your preference. Please give 
your opinion in this way. A space is provided below for any comments 
•about your own aims you may wish to make. 

A* "Geometry achieves its highest possibilities if it can 

establish a pattern of reasoning; if it can develop the 
power to think clearly in non-geometric situations; if it 
can develop an appreciation of the place and function of 
definitions and assumptions in the proof and conclusion. 

Such are the aims of geometry teaching today." 

B. "In human life today, as in the past, geometry has 

played a great part. The history of this contribution to 
civilization has itself great cultural value, but coupled 
with the mastery of useful geometric concepts so necessary 
for advanced work in any of the sciences, it provides the 
complete justification for the teaching of geometry in the 
schools." 











































c * The chief value of geometry lies in its power to train 

the mind. The rigid kind of teaching involved in proving 
propositions in geometry trains the mind to be critical and 
rigorous in thinking. It is the development of this habit 
of logical thinking that is the chief aim in the modern 
teaching of geometry." 

My choice : A._ B._ C. 

Comments: 


What outcomes in pupil behaviour do you expect as a result of the teach¬ 
ing of geometry? Opposite the outcome or outcomes you consider most 
important place a 1, opposite the outcome or outcomes next most impor¬ 
tant a 2 and so on. If you consider some of these outcomes not worth¬ 
while leave the space blank. 

-(a) The student will be able to prove a certain number of proposit ions. 

_(b) He will recognize the significance of defined and undefined terms 
for any argument. 

_(c) He will be able to solve geometric problems (deductions). 

_(d) He will be able to solve more or less original geometric problems 
(i.e. where the geometric applications are not stated in the 
problem situation). 

Je) He will require evidence for any important conclusions he is asked 
to accept. 

_(f) He will have acquired the habit of thinking by carefully graded 
steps as in the deductive proofs of geometry. 

I (g) He will have obtained some idea of algebra applied to geometry and 
vice-versa. 

[ 

Jh) He will have some idea of space geometry. 

_(i) He will have mastered a number of geometric concepts which are the 
necessary prerequisite for advanced work in mathematics. 

_(j) He will appreciate the contributions of mathematics to the progress 
of civilization.

Here are a number of statements often keenly disputed by teachers of 
geometry. Considering your own classroom methods as a basis for

D—You are inclined to disagree with the state¬ 
ment . 

_ia) The best way to make geometry interesting and useful is to provide 
the students with many real life problems which apply geometric 
principles, 

_(b) Students should be required to stick to one method of solving a 
problem. Individual proofs, all different, even though logical, 
will confuse the students and defeat the aims of geometry teaching. 

.(c) When a new principle occurs in the srudy of geometry, it should be 
discussed in terms of the students’ life situations, and for other 
studies if possible, e.g. the baseball game, the street corner 
argument, physics problems. Such a procedure is not really a 
waste of time. 

b (d) In a subject like geometry, class discussion is largely a waste of 
time. Students learn much more by watching demonstrations or 

; doing them themselves. 

Ke) A geometry textbook should always contain answers to numerical prob¬ 
lems so that students can try again if they get the wrong answer. 

.(f) Students often want to tackle new problems which would sidetrack the 
main trend of your day-by-day work. A teacher must prevent this. 

Please check your view: 

i(g) The proofs of none_; all_; some_; of the text theorems 

should be memorized. 

j(h) At times_; at any time_ \ at no "ime_; should students 

be allowed to work in pairs or groups w. v en solving problems. 


if pupils have taken or are taking courses, other than courses in 
mathematics and the sciences, in which some attention is paid to the 
principles of logical reasoning, please name these courses, with any 
necessary comment.

TEST IV 


Part I 


Some of the statements which follow are true, others are false. 

In the space to the left of each item mark the item true (T) or 

false (F). 

1. There is only one possible definition for a word. 

2. In an argument every important word should be agreed upon or 
defined if the same conclusion is to be reached by all. 

3. To obtain a conclusion in an indirect argument, all the 
possibilities must be considered and all but one of these 
possibilities must be eliminated. 

4. One can prove the lack of all merit in a person or institution 
by demonstrating the lack of merit in certain aspects of the 
person or institution. 

3. Changing the meaning of one of the words in the statement of 
a definition has the effect of changing the definition. 

6. If a statement is true then the converse of that statement is 
also true. 

7. A false statement used as a reason may lead to a wrong con¬ 
clusion. 

8. A good dictionary will always settle any dispute about the 
particular definition of a word to use. 

9. When the people concerned are agreed about the meaning of a 
word, a correct conclusion can be reached without a formal 
definition of the word. 

10. A man who is expert in some subject will be able to reason 
logically in any discussion. 

11. A logical argument cannot be disproved by ridiculing the 
arguer , or his motives, or by attackirg his motives. 

12. Any true statement can be used in support of a given argument. 

13. An attack upon certain aspects of a person or institution, even 
though justified, is not sufficient to prove the lack of all 
merit in that person or institution. 

14. A false assumption may lead to a false conclusion. 

13. If an argument contains an unproved proposition or assumption, 
then it cannot be valid. 

16. Since a dictionary usually gives several possible definitions 
of a YJord, it does not always settle all disputes about the 
meaning of a word. 

17. The converse of a true statement is not always true.

- 2 - 



18. If there are thr g and only three possibilities and one of 
them must happen, then if two of the possibilities are shown 
to be in fact impossible, then the third must happen. 

19- A true statement must be relevant (i.e. applicable to the 
given situation) if it is to bo used in logical argument. 



20. If one changes a definition, the conclusion which follows may 
also be changed even though the argument is logical. 

21. There may be several definitions for a word. 

22. Many arguments are lc ly proved by showing that the 
opponents motives are unworthy or ridiculous. 



23. Sven though those concerned are agreed about the meaning of a 
word in an argument, it is necessary to define it formally in 
order to reach a correct conclusion. 

24. A problem has only one solution even if all the important words 
in its statement are not agreed upon or defined. 

23. In any argument what is to be proved should not, either 
directly or indirectly, be used as part of the argument. 

26 . Even if an assumption is false, logical reasoning from this 
assumption will lead to a correct conclusion. 




27 . A conclusion cannot be drawn without somewhere in the 
reasoning accepting one or more assumptions. 

28. If an argument is logical then the changing of a definition 
should have no effect on the conclusion of the argument. 

29. A false statement may be legitimately used as a reason in a 
logical argument, 

30. If there are three and only three possibilities and one of 
them must happen, and if two of the possibilities are shown to 
be in fact impossible, then the third possibility may or may 
not happen. 

31. The statements of an expert should be used as reasons for 
supporting an argument only in the field in which he is expert. 


32. In any argument by elimination of possibilities it is enough 

” to eliminate all but two of the possibilities in order to 

reach the conclusion. 

33. A definition remains unchanged even if the meaning of one of 
the v/ords in the definition is changed. 

34. In a logical argument it is all right to use as a reason a 
proposition which assumes what is to be proved.

TEST V. 


sneral Directions: 


You have been given an answer sheet to go with this test. Fill in 
ae blank spaces at the top of your answer sheet. 

No time limit has been set for this test. If possible, sufficient 
; ime should be allowed for the completion of all the problems. About 
.xty minutes will probably be sufficient. 

Do not put any marks on this test booklet. 

You will find in this test booklet a number of problems, each of 
lich is a situation from everyday life. You are asked to consider the 
'Basoning process used in each situation. 

AN EXPLANATION OF SOME TERMS USED IN THIS TEST 
i idirect Argument : 

In an indirect argument a number of possible causes or conditions are 
msidered. All are eliminated except one, which then becomes the 
inclusion. 

Example: ’’According to Eolmes, there wore only four ways of entering 

le room-through the door, through the window, down the chimney, or 
trough the trap-door in the ceiling. The thief did not enter through 
' le door, nor through the window, and the chimney was too small for him 
> enter that way, so he must have ente r ed by the trap-door .” 

In this example of indirect argument the underlined statement is the 
delusion. 

•nverse: 


A proposition which interchanges the subject and predicate of another 
oposition. 

Example: Proposition:--All figures with four right angles 

are rectangles. 

Converse:-All rectangles are figures with four 

right angles. 

SAMPLE PROBLEM 

The members of a high school class in Social Studies were discussing 
e seizure of parts of China by Japan, and all agreed that_ a nation is 
stified in demanding the return of former territory. As Henry put it, 
nee an area has belonged to a country, it should remain a possession 
that country. In too many cases unjust wars by a powerful aggressor 
ve stripped a country of her rightful territory”. 

When John pointed out that since Quebec province once belonged to^ 
jance, France could rightfully demand its return as a colony , everybody 
ughed.

D irections : 

Assume that all the above statements are true, except the 
pne underlined. Use only the data given in the problem. According 
t;o the principles of logical reasoning with which you are familiar, 
.ndicate what you think of the underlined statement by choosing one of 
;he following conclusions. 


inclusions: 


John proved that France could rightfully demand the return of Quebec 
province as a colony. 

John did not prove that France could rightfully demand the return 
of Quebec province as a colony. 

More information is needed to decide whether or not John proved 
that France could rightfully demand the return of Quebec province 
as a colony. 


Mote : 

Since you are to assume that all the given statements (except the 
'•ne underlined) are true, you must accept as true that all the class 
igreed that a nation is justified in demanding the return of former 
;erritory. Further, you must also accept as true that Quebec province 
i'nce belonged to France. Your conclusion about John T s reasoning should 
[>e conclusion (A), above. 

Henry ? s statement, and the fact that everybody laughed, are addi¬ 
tional facts not required in determining which conclusion to choose. 


irection s : 

Choose the reasons which support or explain the logic of 
our conclusion. 


as ons : 

The word "territory” must be defined before we can decide whether or 
not John proved his point. 

John deserved to be laughed at for such a silly statement. 

If we accept certain assumptions, then to be logical we must accept 
the conclusion which follows from them. 

John was trying to stir up racial prejudice in Canada. 

Canada was at one time a possession of France. 






































Britain gained Canada as a result of war. 

‘ Y r e must admit that France could rightfully ask for the return of 
Quebec province as a colony if we agreed that Quebec was formerly 
French territory, and that a nation is justified in demanding the 
return of former territory. 

No schoolboy such as John can argue about questions which baffle our 
great statesmen. 

Some of the students may not have agreed that a nation is justified 
in demanding the return of former territory. 


ote : 

The important statements are those which are related to the 
rinciple that if we accept certain premises we must accept the logical 
inclusion which follows from these premises. 

The statements to be chosen are numbers 3 and 7. 

Where reasons add to or contra dict the data of the problem, re¬ 
ember that you are to use only the'data given in the problem and the 
rinciples of logical reasoning with which you are familiar, in 
etermining the conclusion. Thus reason $9, which denies what you are 
old to accept, must be ignored.

Albert wanted the bell to ring fainter so that he could show that air 
had been removed from the bell jar. 

Albert gave a good reason for saying that air had been removed 
iron the bell jar. 

One cannot tell from the readings of the pressure gauge whether air 
had been removed from the bell jar or not. 

Albert proved his point because the school janitor, on hearing of the 
discussion, stated that he was sure that sound required a medium to 
travel in. 

Since it had not yet been determined that sound requires a medium to 
travel in, Albert is assuming the conclusion that the class set out 
to prove.

VA small western town has a special license for restaurants. Mr. 
Jorquist, a merchant of this town, is the owner of a small general store 
/hich sells, among other things, cold meats, bread, pickles,^ and the like, 
poor farmers often come in, buy sausages and bread, cook the sausages on 
;he open-top heater in the store, and have lunch there. Mr. Norquist has 
i table with a bench at which they eat. Sometimes Mr. Norquist helps them 
:ook. They use a frying pan supplied by Mr. Norquist. 

The mayor of the town stated that according to the tov/n f s by-laws, 

:r. Norquist would have to obtain the special restaurant license. Mr. 
forquist replied that he didn T t keep a restaurant u . 


Directions : Accept the above statements as true. Use only these data, 

according to the principles of logical reasoning with which you are 
familiar, select the conclusion which you think applies. 


0NCLUSI0N5 : 

Norquist should not have to obtain the special restaurant license. 
. Mr. Norquist should have to obtain the special restaurant license. 

, More information is needed to decide whether or not Mr, Norquist 
should have to obtain the special restaurant license. 


Directions : Choose the reasors which support or explain the logic of 

your conclusion. 


E ASONS : 

• Mr. Norquist wants to get additional business by underhand means. 

• A changed definition will lead to a changed conclusion even though 
the argument from each definition is logical. 

. To make a sound indirect argument, one must consider all the 
possibilities. 

. Mr. Norquist was helping the town by helping the poor farmers so he 
should not have to pay for the special license. 

• Anyone who claims Mr. Norquist didn ? t keep a restaurant is just plain 
stupid. 

. We must know whether a place where people buy food, have it cooked, 
then eat it, is legally a restaurant. 

f A place where people drink beer is a beer parlor so a place where 
people eat meals is a restaurant. 

. The Principal of the school said that Mr. Norquist was operating a 
restaurant. 

. There is sufficient evidence to show that Mr. Norquist was operating 
a restaurant. 

I Since Mr. Norquist always helped cook, he was really selling cooked 
food. 

• One is not justified in using the statement one set out to prove as 
part of the argument. 

' If the mayor is going to argue that way, he must show that Mr. 
Norquist does not operate a grocery store, a hardward store, a con¬ 
fectionery (and so on for all kinds of business), so he must be 
operating a restaurant.

"A high school class in English had a debate ’Resolved that the use 
f cosmetics should be freely permitted in school*. At noon, Hazel and 
cny continued the argument as follows: 

3NY:—"You girls just want to f high hat* the high school boys, You doll 
up so that the older boys will take you out". 

A.ZEL: -Taint so. Using cosmetics improves a girl’s appearance and 
makes her attractive." 

DNY:--"What do you mean by ? girl ? ?" 

AZEL:-"A high school girl. Appearing attractive gives a girl more 
confidence and so improves her personality." 

ONY:---"Yes, but a painted doll looks terrible. You have no discretion. 

C-irls shouldn’t be allowed to use cosmetics in school". 
kZEL:-"I have too got discretion! Anyway, the use of cosmetics improves 
a girl’s personality, and anything that will improve a girl’s 
personality should be used by girls". 

DNY:--"I agree with everything you said so far, except that you haven’t 
any discretion". 

k-ZEL:- "Then you must a dmit that cosmetics should be used by high school 
; girls 

Directi ons: Put yourself in Tony’s placeT Choose one of the following. 

|_ conclusion s,__ 

INCL USIONS: 

. To be logical, Tony must admit that cosmetics should be used by high 
school girls. 

, Even if he is perfectly logical, Tony still does not have to admit that 
cosmetics should be used by high school girls. 

. Even if Tony is perfectly logical, we need more information to enable us 
to decide whether or not Tony must admit that cosmetics should be used 
by high school girls. 

Lrections : TThoo'se the reasons which explain or support the logic of 

_ your con clusion._ 

5AS0NS: 

if Since Tony agreed to all of Hazel’s statements except that she haddiscce- 
tion,he must admit the logical conclusion which follows from these statements. 
I Cosmetics should have some definition such as "lipstick, rouge, powder, 

; and mascara" before we can decide whether or not Tony must admit Hazel’s point. 

! Tony was insulting and talked like a smart alec instead of arguing, 

• so he should admit Hazel’s point. 

i It is quite true that painted dolls look terrible and that most high 
j! school girls have no discretion, so Tony need not admit Hazel’s point. 

|[ When one changes a definition, the conclusion is changed even though 
the argument used is still logical. 

li Bronx High, the best high school in the City of New York, encourages 
girl students to use cosmetics. 

m If one accepts certain assumptions, even though the conclusion which 
logically follows is not necessarily true, it should be accepted, 
i Just as a brightly painted barn doesn’t look attractive, a girl with 
crimson lips doesn’t, so Tony should not have to admit Hazel’s point. 
Hazel must be the kind who wants to flirt with the high school boys 
and that is why she thinks high school girls should use cosmetics. 

We need to know whether Tony’s statement that no high school girl ever 
has any discretion, is correct. 

. In a logical proof the statement one set out to prove cannot be used 
as an argument. _ 

, Since Tony must admit that cosmetics should be used by high school 
girls he cannot be a logical arguer.

ASONS: 


A person with plenty of self-respect must be respectable. 

I A man claimed that he had looked for work but we must have more informa¬

| The conclusion is not necessarily true, but if one accepts the premises 
on which an argument is based, to be logical he should accept the 
, conclusion which logically follows. 

Before we can decide whether or not he proved his point we must have a 
precise definition of ’’respectable 1 '. 

,j The man probably wasn’t a ’bum’ but the speaker was a prosperous 
I business man so he tried to picture the man as a ’bum’ deliberately 

I so that the speaker himself might appear in a more favourable light. 

Even respectable people sometimes can’t find work. The poor man might 
have been starving.

statement, :5 Respectable people want to work". 

If one changes a definition the conclusion which logically fellows is 
also changed. 

The chairman of the banquet, at the conclusion of the address,stated 
that no respectable men were unable to find work nowadays.

LUSCAR HOCKEY TEAM BEST 

"The Inter High School League, made up of Luscar, Bella, Setter, and 
rayville high school hockey teams, is approaching the play-offs. Because 
‘ the lack of finance the number of games has been limited. Here is the 
landing in the games which have been played so far: 

Jan. 21 Bella beat Setter 7-2 

Feb. 3 Trayville beat Bella 5-1 
Feb. 15 Luscar beat Trayville 5-3 

One of these teams must be the best. The best team, of course, always 
ns any well-conducted hockey match. With the able refereeing of Spike 
■Kernan, all the Inter High School League games have been well conducted 
iis year, which is in sharp contrast with last year T s showing.

I Amateur forecasters about hockey usually need an ice bag to cool them off. 
| The girl-friend of the Luscar coach gave Sportswrite a hot tip that the

Mas part of the argument. 

I We must have a proper definition of the word "best" before we can 

idecide whether or not Sportswrite proved that Luscar team is best. 

Since Sportswrite stated that one team must be best, and according to

(Bella beat it). Bella team wasn't best (Trayville beat it), and Tray¬

According to Alberta Law, the only reasons for which a student may 
3 excused from attendance at school are: 

L If he is sick. 

L If he is over 13 years of age. 

. If he is at necessary work by permission of the Principal of the school 
or a Justice of the Feace (for periods of not over six weeks). 

. If he has passed Grade VIII and further instruction is not offered in 
his local school. 

. If the Department of Education is satisfied he is receiving adequate 
instruction at home. 

In September, a farm hey, Kenneth Brown, had missed two weeks of 
3 hool. The teacher knew he couldn't be 13 for another half year. He 
idn't passed Grade VIII. He wasn't receiving any instruction at home-- 
i fact, he was helping with the harvesting. The family was very poor 
id could not afford to hire any help. The Principal of the school had 
-it given his permission for Kenneth to work at home. 

The teacher concluded that his absence from school was not exousable 
ad notified the attendance (truancy) officer.

ita given above. Select the conclusion which, you think applies.

IAS 0 NS : 

| Kenneth might have been sick and so missed the two weeks of school. 

The teacher was picking on Kenneth to report him in the circumstances 
given. 

. If one accepts the assumptions on which an argument is based, to be 
logical he must accept the conclusion which logically follows. 

. We must have a precise definition of '’excusable'', "necessary work", 
and "adequate instruction" before we can decide whether or not he 
should be excused. 

This teacher must have been one of those fussy ones who always stick 
to technicalities. 

A sound indirect argument considers all the possibilities and 
eliminates all but one. 

jj When one changes a definition the conclusion is changed even though the 
argument from each definition is logical. 

Farm boys should not be allowed to help with harvesting even though 
the family may be poor, because education is so important. 

Since Kenneth's absence was not excusable the teacher was justified in 
notifying the attendance officer. 

When fighting a war every man must do his part, so when the family is 
fighting a war against poverty, Kenneth must help with the farm work, 
j Kenneth might be working on permission of a Justice of the Peace,

A university student was reading a book on "How Men Think" when he 
|as struck by this statement: 

"A critical thinker can recognize problems, weigh evidence and draw 
larranted conclusions and generalizations from the data given". 

"Well," he said, "I can recognize problems and weigh evidence. I 
an also draw warranted conclusions and generalizations from the data 
iven. Although the author has not defined a critical thinker in this 
tatement, I believe it is true as far as it goes".

aid he could and let us accept in the same way as the student did, the 
ruth of the above statements about a critical thinker. Indicate what 
ou think of the underlined statement by choosing one of the following 
pnclusions: 


"I conclude", said the student, " That I am a critical thinker ". 
IQNCLUSIONS : 

. The student proved that he was a critical thinker. 

. The student did not prove that he was a critical thinker. 

. More information is required to decide whether he did or did not prove 
that he was a critical thinker. 


iractions : Choose the reasons which support or explain the logic of 
your conclusion. 


SASONS: 


. A straightforward definition of "critical thinker" is required before 
we can decide whether or not he proved his point. 

I This student just boasted about himself instead of giving sound 
arguments so he showed he wasn’t a critical thinker. 

The book "How Men Think" may not have been written by a reliable author 
who is an authority on Psychology and Logic. 

Without any proof, the student accepted the converse of the statonent, 
"A critical thinker can recognize problems, etc.", as true. 

Changing the definition will change the conclusion even though the 
argument from each definition is logical. 

A sound indirect argument considers all the possibilities and elimin- 
j: ates them all except one. 

L Just as a person who is free, white and 21 can vote, so a person who 
can recognize problems, weigh evidence, etc., is a critical thinker. 
Since the student has eliminated all the possibilities by showing he 
l| can recognize problems, weigh evidence, etc., the remaining possibility 
j must be correct and he has proved that he is a critical thinker. 

Ijl, Having accepted the truth of certain statements, to be logical we must 
j accept the conclusion which logically follows even though it is not 
necessarily true. 

i, Since the student failed to show that he had all the qualities of a 
critical thinker listed in the quotation given, he did not prove that 
he is a critical thinker. 

The converse of a true statement is not necessarily true.^ 

The student’s teacher of English remarked in class just two days

JASONS: 

The word "hail" must be accurately defined. 

The Granham Times reported snow and one can surely rely on anything 
that appears in print. 

The farmer was a fool to think that just because he said it was hail 
the company would pay the claim. 

A rich insurance company should certainly pay a poor farmer so 
I obviously in need as Mr. Metz was. 

1 A changed definition changes the conclusion even though the argument 
| from each definition may be logical. 

The.insurance company was merely trying to get out of paying the 
claim by stating that there was no hail. 

Mr. Metz is assuming the conclusion when he says that the storm was 
hail. 

Since Mr. Metz in his letter as quoted, claimed that the local teacher, 
the minister and several other prominent citizens could testify that 
the storm was hail,it probably was hail. 

In a sound argument, one cannot use the conclusion one set out to 
prove as a reason to support the argument. 

If there was a hailstorm then the company should pay the insurance. 

Just as rain in winter usually turns to snow, a hailstorm in summer ends 
up with snow, then rain; so the storm was hail. 

The conclusion is not necessarily true, but if we accept the premises 
on which an argument is based, to be logical we should accept the 
conclusion which logically follows,

We must know how Jane defined "communist, fascist and democratic" before

The only thing Jane proved was that the saying "Fools rush in where 
angels fear to tread" applies to her. 

;Goebbels claims that the common people of Germany are satisfied, and we 
[require more information to know whether his claims are correct. 

[Since we are told to assume that Jane proved that conditions in all 
ifascist governed and communist governed countries are unsatisfactory 
’for the common people, and since democratic government is the only one 
Heft, then democracy must be the only form of government which 
[satisfies the common people. 

;In an indirect argument one must eliminate all the possibilities except 
lone and then accept the remaining possibility,as it stands, asthe conclusion. 
jJane ? s arguments were silly because she wanted to please her teacher and 
'she knew she must favour democracy as a way of life to do that. 

[The conclusion may or may not be true, but if we accept the premises on 
Which it is based, to be logical we must accept the conclusion which 
logically follows. 

A changed definition leads to a changed conclusion even though the argu¬ 
ment from each is logical. 

Jane showed that fascist and communist governments are unsatisfactory to 
the common people, which left democracy as the only remaining kind of 
government, but she did not show that it satisfies the common people. 
,;Jane 7 s father said just the night before Jane gave the report that the 
people of Russia and Germany were on the verge of open revolt. 

A .school in which the teacher keeps good discipline is better ordered 
than one where students run wild. Similarly, the good order kept by 
fascist or communist governments satisfies the common people better 
I than a democratic government does. 

According to the statements Jane made in the summary of her report there 
[night be many more than just three kinds of governments in the world today. 





































APPENDIX 11 


Co mplete Sta tement of Teach er of School G. 

I have been asked to state the methods used by the 
school in their gain ir: G n trio and General reason¬ 
ing attained by a year's study of the Geometry One course of 
the High School Program of Alberta. 

Several initial satisfactory conditions should be noted. 
First, the students were intelligent. It is my belief that 
teaching results are strictly limited by inherited ability of 
students. Second the students of this school posessed a clear 
cut "esprit de corps", a group consciousness and pride in them¬ 
selves and each other which was partly the result of many years 
of association. Here of course, the smaller school possesses a 
distinct advantage over city institutions f Third, it was my 
second year with this school. Cooperation between students and 
teacher is much more difficult, during the first year, than dur¬ 
ing the second and third of association. 

Our class commenced the study of Geometry with two con¬ 
cepts as fundamental: first, that geometrical and all reasoning 
eas practical, desirable and the crown of human-achievement. 

Some preliminary time was spent on analysis of the utility of 
reason, both locally and his: ric lly. In social studies, 
leaders were presented as the men who had pre-eminently developed 
reasoning ability. Perhaps the attitude we developed was naive, 
but it was effective. Second we considred reasoning ability as 
a universal gift to humanity: it was assumed that those who did 
little to display the ability were but undeveloped and required 
more practice than others. In other words we combatted a poss¬ 
ible inferiority complex, and laid a reasonable basis for x he

thoery, that practice must he in inverse ratio to present 
efficiency. At the same time we organized an advanced class 
for those who Aid not need so much of the preliminary practice— 
when they could he spared from assisting the others. 

Our classes were small and our blackboard snace i Pr -e 
so we arranged for the students needing most practice to take 
their places at the hoard and there solve individual problems 
which each wrote clearly on his section, 

remained at seats, and prepared themselves to act as advisors 
when this was requested by the student at the board and allowed 
by the teacher. But each assistance must be for one step only, 
for it would be a disgrace to assume that the one assisted could 
not complete the work if he were started on the right course. 

The teacher n^ted the special abilities of each student_ 

especially of those who seemed to have fewest and endeavored to 
train these as instructors, where it could be '’.one. 

The teacher might take a somewhat retarded student,into 
his office and suggest something like this "I don T t believe that 
you have been doing your share of helping the rest of the class 
lately: we're going to take up some work of a new type soon, and

Such treatment puts an extra strain upon the teacher*s 
imagination in setting additional and more varied problems. 

But some of this work was done hy the student for part of his 
work was to compare problems for the class. Student problems 
were then written on the blackboard by the sponsor and analysed 
by the class, as to the adequacy of data, and solubility or in¬

additional data must be added to make them soluble. 

Problems were encouraged which were intensely related to 
local situations. Crndd surveying and other instruments were 
made with the aid of which the class surveyed heights and dis¬ 
tances within reach.

or demands of the course. The teacher*s work is then to clear 
ur> difficulties and to keep the class research from wandering
