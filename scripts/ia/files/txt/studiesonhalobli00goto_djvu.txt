STUDIES ON HALO BLIGHT, A BACTERIAL 
DISEASE OF OATS 


S. Goto 


INTRODUCTION 


The damage from bacterial diseases of oats is pro¬ 
bably far greater than is generally realized. Such diseases 
no doubt will assume more importance in Canada as the oat 
acreage increases. The demand for livestock and the wheat 
reduction program are both encouraging greater production 
of the coarse grains. 

Only a few bacterial pathogens of oats have been 
described and the literature regarding them is not extensive. 
Two have been reported to occur naturally on the oat plant: 
Bacterium coronafaciens Elliott, the causal organism of Halo 
Blight of oats; and Bacterium striafaciens Elliott, the 
causal organism of Bacterial Stripe Blight of oats. 

Bacterium alboprecipitans Rosen, B^ coronafaciens 
atropurpureum Reddy and Godkin, Xanthomonas translucens f. 
sp. hordeiavenae f 0 sp. nov. Hagborg, and X^ translucens f. 
sp. cerealis f. sp. nov. Hagborg have also been reported to 
be pathogenic to oats, but only under artificial conditions.

THE HALO BLIGHT DISEASE OF OATS 


The Halo Blight disease of oats is widespread in 
western Canada, especially when the season is favorable. All 
varieties of cultivated oats appear to be naturally suscep¬ 
tible in varying degrees. In addition other crops such as 
wheat, rye, and barley may be slightly susceptible under 
artificial conditions. 

The causal organism, B^ coronafaciens, is able to 
remain alive for some years in the seed and for some time 
in or on diseased plant residues. Seed-borne inoculum is 
most likely to cause primary infection of the emerging cole- 
optile and the first leaves of the oat seedling, especially 
during wet, cool and cloudy weather in the late spring. 
Higher, temperatures and less moisture tend to reduce the 
severity of the disease, and the damage under such conditions 
may be negligible. 

Inoculum from the primary lesions on the first 
seedling leaves may be carried to the other leaves by wind 
and rain, causing secondary infections. According to Elliott 
(15) the lesions from these secondary infections first appear 
on the leaf as light green spots, sunken in the middle. 

These enlarge rapidly, showing concentric rings in various 
shades of yellow, green, and brown. Later on the lesions 
become dry and yellowish brown.(Figure 1). At no time is 
there any bacterial exudate. The spikelets, too, are often

attacked. The typical halo may appear on the chaff, and the 
tissues between the veins may turn yellow and later trans¬ 
lucent. The pedicels dry and shrink, and the receptacles 
become shiny and translucent, giving the panicle a blighted 
appearance (Figure 2). In severely affected crops, these 
characteristic panicles are easily recognized. In less 
severely affected ones, only the lower leaves may be dead, 
while the newer growth may be entirely free of lesions. 
Lesions on the flag leaf are often in a favorable position 
to supply inoculum to the emerging panicle. This may cause 
partial or complete blighting of the spikelets, The grains 
may then be blighted or contaminated by the organism. Some¬ 
times they may show no outward symptoms of the disease, yet 
may carry sufficient inoculum to initiate primary infection. 

Bacterial Stripe Blight caused by B^ striafaciens 
can be distinguished from Halo Blight by the thin white 
scales of bacterial exudate and by the absence of the halo 
(16). 

Inoculum from contaminated seed is probably the 
most important to be contended with and is the cause of much 
emergence blight. Under the unfavorable weather conditions 
noted before, the secondary inoculum from the first leaf may 
not cause much infection and the later growth may be entirely 
free of disease. But under suitable conditions this inoculum 
may be widely spread and cause severe damage to the later 
leaves and heads. Thus the disease can be prevented if the

pathogen is controlled while on or in the seed. Since a few 
infected plants, under suitable conditions, can furnish 
initial inoculum for a widespread distribution of the patho¬ 
gen, the control must be complete to be effective. 

The determination of the effect of seed treatment 
on the control of Halo Blight in the field is often difficult 
under favorable conditions for the spread of the inoculum. 

For example, it is a common observation under Edmonton field 
conditions that oat plantings sown from treated seed differ 
little in severity of Halo Blight from those started with 
untreated seed. This may occur as a result of the rapid 
development of secondary infections produced by inoculum 
originating * in untreated seed or in inefficiently treated 
seed. 

The evaluation of seed treatment for the control of 
primary infection can be more readily studied under controlled 
greenhouse conditions, since secondary infections can be 
largely avoided there. The present studies were made under 
such conditions. 

OBJECTS OF THE STUDIES 


The physiological reactions of B^ coronafaciens have 
been carefully worked out by Miss Elliott (15). The present 
studies deal particularly with primary infection and measures 
designed to prevent it by the destruction of seed-borne

inoculum. The principal objects were to determine: 

1. The identity of isolates from a field of blighted 
oats as coronafaciens ; 

2. The effect of chemical treatment on artificially 
inoculated seed; 

3. The effect of environmental conditions on primary 
infection; 

4. The extent of antibiotic effects of other microorgan¬ 
isms toward coronafaciens in artificial media and in soil; 

5. The effect of chemical seed treatment on the oat 
host plant and on other cereals for comparative purposes. 

THE CAUSAL ORGANISM 


Source of Isolates 


In the summer of 1941, severe Halo Blight was 
noted in a field of Erban oats at Morningside, Alberta, Spe¬ 
cimens of affected leaves and panicles were secured. In addi¬ 
tion collections were made at Edmonton and Fallis. These in¬ 
cluded typical haloed lesions on the leaf (Figure 1) and blighted 
spikelets (Figure 2). The latter were easily distinguishable 
in the field from spikelets affected with physiological blast 
by the discolored, smooth, shiny appearance of the spikelet, 
and the shrunken pedicel. In addition, the flag leaf invari¬ 
ably possessed lesions from which the inoculum infected the 
emerging panicle.

Methods of Isolation 


The organism was readily isolated from the diseased 
tissue, even after eight months* storage at room temperature. 
Portions of this tissue were put through six successive wash¬ 
ings with sterile distilled water in petri dishes. These were 
then crushed in sterile water blanks and, from the suspension, 
loop dilutions were plated out in 2$ dextrose agar. 

Two organisms predominated. A viscid yellow one 
was commonly present. This was believed to be similar to the 
Bacillus avenae of Manns who considered it to be necessary 
before the white one could be actively pathogenic. Miss 
Elliott (15) however believes it to be merely a surface sap¬ 
rophyte. In our tests there were no indications that this 
organism was necessary for the white one to become pathogenic. 

Pathogenicity tests by leaf inoculation 


The isolates were tested for pathogenicity by 
inoculating the leaves of Victory oat seedlings without injury, 
using inoculum direct from the culture tubes. The plants were 
then placed in a humidity chamber for 24 hours and then 
returned to the greenhouse bench. The production of lesions 
was taken as an index of pathogenicity. 

The typical field lesions as illustrated in Figure 
1 were never obtained. The usual reaction was a light brown

region bounded by a more or less circular reddish brown ring 
and the whole by a yellowish region. Often the ring was 
absent, giving the lesion the appearance of a large circular 
to oval chlorotic area with normal turgidity. Often long 
water-soaked streaks developed along the leaf, similar to the 
lesions of Stripe Blight. These probably arose as a result of 
the organism’s being carried down the leaf by drops of water 
of guttation. 

Inoculation of oat leaves, water-soaked with a five- 
minute exposure to a water jet connected to an air line at 30 
pounds pressure, produced very severe symptoms which resulted 
in the quick shrivelling and death of the leaf. This was con¬ 
sidered comparable to the "epidemic type" of lesion described 
by Clayton (10 ) as resulting from inoculation of water-soaked 
tobacco leaves with tabacum . The uninoculated water- 
soaked leaves soon recovered their normal appearance. Thus 
water-soaking in the field may be the reason for the severe 
damage often done to the lower leaves of affected oat plants. 

Isolates selected for study were T14, T31, T33b, 

T37, and T47. 

Cultural Characteristics 


The procedures laid down in the Manual of Methods 
for Pure Culture Study of Bacteria were generally followed 
except where otherwise noted.

Cell morphology and Gram reaction 

On potato dextrose agar the organism is a rod 
.59 to .85 x 1.77 to 2.95 microns. On nutrient agar and 
tryptone-glucose skim-milk agar the rods tend to occur in 
chains. The measurements were made on smears stained with 
nigrosin. Capsules were demonstrated by Anthony’s method. 

No spores were observed with the use of Dorner’s method. The 
Gram reaction was negative. 

Temperature relations 

The organism grew well on potato dextrose agar at 
temperatures from 7°C to 30°C (Figure 4). At 5°C and 35°C 
no growth took place. Plates incubated at the latter temper¬ 
atures showed no growth when transferred to room temperature 
of 24°C after twelve days. 

Growth on media 

Growth was best on 2$ potato dextrose agar. On 
plates the surface colonies are white, raised, circular with 
entire margins, and of a starchy consistency; the sub-surface 
colonies are lens shaped. Under the low power the colonies 
have a granular appearance. In potato dextrose agar the 
organism has a characteristic sour odor. 

On tryptone-glucose skim-milk agar the growth is 
colorless and translucent with undulate margins. In nutrient

agar, the growth is sparse and white. 

Chromogenesis 

A green, water-soluble pigment appeared in three to 
four days in Sullivan's modified asparagin medium (9). This 
was accompanied by the formation of unidentified white crys¬ 
tals. Pigment production appeared to be associated with 
pathogenicity. 

On tryptone-glucose skim-milk agar, the organism 
caused a noticeable greening of the medium. This effect was 
not noted on potato dextrose agar or nutrient agar. In ultra¬ 
violet light no fluorescence was produced by the colonies on 
any of these media. 

Physiological reactions 

The Gnezda test for indol production in tryptone 
was negative. The Methyl-red test in peptone-glucose-KgfIP 04 
showed non-production of acid in this medium. The Voges - 
Proskauer test for the production of acetyl-methyl-carbinol 
was also negative. 

Slight growth on Simmon*s citrate medium indicated 
some utilization of citrate carbon, but the reaction of the 
medium was unchanged. No nitrate reduction in .1% KNO 3 
nutrient broth or hydrolysis of starch on „ 2 $ soluble starch 
nutrient agar was noted. In litmus milk , the reaction was 


alkaline and there was no curdling. Gelatin in nutrient broth

Acid was formed from dextrose and fructose but not

Summary 


The description, based on the above tests, agrees 
in general with that of Miss Elliott (17) and is as follows: 

Gram negative, capsule-forming, non-sporing rod, 

.59 to .85 x 1.77 to 2.95 microns, flourescin produced in 
asparagin medium, gelatin liquefied, citrate carbon utilized, 
indol negative, methyl red negative, acetyl-methyl-carbinol 
negative, nitrate reduction negative, starch hydrolysis nega¬ 
tive, no gas formed, acid formed in dextrose and fructose, no 
acid in salicin, alkali formed in litmus milk, temperature 
range 30°C to 7 °c. 

On the basis of the cultural characteristics and the 
symptoms caused by secondary inoculation, the identity of the 
isolates was determined to be coronafaciens . This was sub¬ 
stantiated by comparison with a culture of this organism from 
Dr. W. A. E. Hagborg of Winnipeg, also pathogenic on oat 
seedlings. A culture of striafaoiens from the same source 
was considered to bear no resemblance to our isolates. 

The original name Bacterium coronafaciens given by 
Miss Elliott is used throughout these studies. The name 
Pseudomonas coronafaciens (Ell.) Stapp is probably preferable 
now in view of Dowson’s new classification (13), but until 
the latter is more widely adopted, the original name is 
retained.

The varietal host range 

Elliott (15) first observed varietal reactions to 
B. coronafaciens . She noted that all varieties examined were 
susceptible and that differences between varieties became 
less noticeable in severe attacks as the season advanced. 
Aamodt and Platt (1) also failed to find immunity in any of 
the varieties tested in a year of severe infection, though 
under other conditions some differences in susceptibility 
appeared to be exhibited. 

A number of varieties obtained from the Cereal Divi¬ 
sion, University of Alberta, were inoculated hypodermically at 
the seedling stage in the greenhouse with a water-suspension 
of coronafaciens T47, incubated , and later compared. Dif¬ 
ferences in reaction were noted, but all the varieties proved 
susceptible to a greater or lesser extent. The ratings were 
based on the extent of the chlorotic areas. The results are 
shown in Table I.

STUDIES ON SEED TREATMENT FOR THE CONTROL OF 
PRIMARY INFECTION 


Introduction 


Seed treatment was investigated as a control mea¬ 
sure for Halo Blight by Elliott in 1919. Two methods were 
used: (1). soaking the seed in 1:320 formaldehyde for three 

hours; and (2) subjecting it to hot air at 100°C for 30 hours. 
The former killed many but not all of the bacteria on the seed, 
while the latter was completely effective in control. Neither 
treatment, however, can be considered satisfactory—the hot

air treatment because of its impracticability and the formal¬ 
dehyde dip because of the trouble involved and possible 
injury to the seed. 

A series of experiments was made to determine the 
relative effectiveness of seed treatment with Ceresan, Spergon, 
and formaldehyde in the control of Halo Blight. Ceresan and 
Spergon are the trade names for dust preparations containing 
ethyl mercury phosphate and tetrachloro-para-benzoquinone 
respectively. The formaldehyde treatment consisted of a wet 
application of a 1:320 solution of commercial formalin 
(Appendix XII). Since naturally infested seed was not avail¬ 
able, seed artificially inoculated with isolates from diseased 
tissue was used. 

Method of Seed Inoculation 


In these studies a heavy seed inoculation was con¬ 
sidered desirable for comparing the effects of different seed 
treatments. It was thought especially important to deposit 
some of the inoculum between the hull and the caryopsis. 

This was done by washing the seed in six to eight changes of 
sterile water under a partial vacuum, soaking it for about 
half an hour in a water suspension of the bacteria, and again 
subjecting it to a partial vacuum. The seed was then dried 
at room temperature before the chemical treatments were made.

The Symptoms of Primary Infection 


Miss Elliott described the primary lesion develop¬ 
ment in the field as follows: lf Lesions are first visible as 
light green oval spots 4 to 5 mm. in diameter with central 
sunken points of infection at first evident only on one side 
of the leaf. This center of infection increases slowly in 
size, penetrates the leaf tissue, and in a day or two forms 
a grey or brown dry tissue from one to several millimetres in 
diameter, evident on both sides of the leaf blade. The halo¬ 
like margin spreads rapidly becoming uniformly lighter green 
to yellow or showing concentric markings of different shades 
of green and yellow Tr ( 15). 

Under the conditions of these experiments,* infected 
plants, when two to three inches in height, usually showed 
translucent, water-soaked regions between the veins when the 
humidity was high, usually in the mornings and evenings. 

Later in the day as the humidity decreased, these areas dis¬ 
appeared and the leaf became quite dry and normal in appear¬ 
ance. This sequence was repeated for three to four days or 
longer, and the leaf gradually became chlorotic, ultimately 
shrivelling or collapsing (Figure 4). At other times, dark, 
shrunken areas appeared, usually at the tips or along the 
edges of the blade. Chlorotic areas developed around these 
and rapidly enlarged. Often a distinct streak of shrunken 
tissue extended along the whole length of the blade, probably

due to Inoculum flowing down in the water of guttation. Less 
frequently reddish brown lesions with or without the chlorotic 
areas occurred, as noted by Hagborg (25) 0 The latter type 
was also common when needle inoculations were made on leaves 
water-soaked for five minutes with a fine spray of water under 
thirty pounds air pressure. 

Effect of Seed Treatment with Formaldehyde and 
Ceresan on hulled* and hulless oats 
inoculated with B. coronafaciens 


This experiment was made to compare the effects of 
Ceresan treatment with the standard formaldehyde treatment 
on hulled and hulless oats inoculated with isolates of B. 
coronafaciens from blighted oats. 

Method 

Hulled and hulless Erban oats were used, the latter 
being dehulled by hand. After six 5-minute washings with 
sterile water under a partial vacuum, the seed was inoculated 
as previously described with water-suspensions of cultures 
T33b and T37, with water as a control. The seed was left in 

* By hulled oats is meant oats with hull, while hulless oats 
refers to oats without the hull.

this inoculum for three hours, drained, and left overnight to 
dry. Separate lots were then treated. The Ceresan was 
applied by shaking the dust and grain together in a 200 cc. 
Erlenmeyer flask. It was used at the recommended rate of 1/2 
oz. per bushel. After treatment the flasks were bunged with 
cotton and left for 12 hours. The formaldehyde was applied 
by immersing the seed in a 1:320 solution for two minutes, 
draining, covering with cheesecloth for four hours, and then 
drying at room temperature. 

The seeds were planted in glass-fronted galvanized 
iron cans 22 x 12 x 1.75 inches in size, kindly made available 
by the Cereal Division. The joints were sealed with battery 
sealing compound to make the cans water tight. 

The cans contained 7800 grams of finely sifted 5:1 
Edmonton soil and sand mixture, having a pH of 6.2, and 
adjusted to a moisture content of 17.6$. Twenty-five ker¬ 
nels were sown in each container, one inch below the surface 
of the soil, embryo pointing downwards, and against the glass. 
After seeding each was watered with 1000 cc. of tap water 
and placed at an angle of 45 degrees in specially constructed 
frames. This allowed the roots to grow against the glass 
so that daily observations of their development could be made. 

The glass was marked off into one-inch divisions 
from the seed level to the bottom of the glass. The number 
of root tips within each division as counted, multiplied by 
the lengthto the closest inch gave an estimate of the root

growth of the seedlings growing in the container. 

Some difficulty was experienced from roots not 
growing their whole length along the glass. This may account 
for some of the anomalies attributed to observer error. 
However, these were generally ironed out on averaging. Exam¬ 
ination of the root systems by removal of the glass front 
showed that they all grew close to or against the glass, and 
this method may therefore be considered to give a fairly good 
estimate of the root lengths. 

Results 

Data on emergence, leaf length, and root growth, 
taken on the fourteenth day after seeding are summarized in 
Table II; the results of the analysis of variance in Table 
III; the effect of inoculation in general on hulled and 
hulless oats in Table IV; the effect of seed treatments in 
general on hulled and hulless oats in Table V; the daily root 
growth for twelve days in Appendix I; and a graphical com¬ 
parison of the daily root growth from inoculated and non- 
inoculated seed is shown in Figure 5. 

Culture T33b was effective in lowering emergence, 
leaf length, and root length of plants from both hulless and 
hulled seed, while culture T37 caused a significant decrease 
only in leaf length of hulless oats. 

No significant differences were shown by the treat¬ 
ments with the exception of the formaldehyde on hulless oats,

which reduced the emergence, leaf length, and root length to 
a marked degree. Ceresan caused damage especially to hulless 
seed. This may be due to insufficient drying of the seed 
after inoculation and before treatment, which was found by 
Grimble (23) to increase the susceptibility of wheat to Cere¬ 
san injury. This is clearly illustrated in the graphs of 
the daily root growths shown in Figure 5. 

In this experiment neither Ceresan nor formaldehyde 
had any beneficial effects on seed inoculated with oat blight 
isolates. The effectiveness of culture T33b in reducing 
emergence and root growth of hulled oats is illustrated in 
Figure 6a and the effect of treatment with Ceresan and for¬ 
maldehyde on hulled, non-inoculated seed is shown in Figure 6b. 

The experimental set-up was factorial in design and 
was analysed as such. It will be noted that the three errors 
are of the same magnitude, indicating that in this particular 
experiment the soil heterogeneity and other environmental con¬ 
ditions could be controlled enough so that the required 
information could have been obtained just as well from a simple 
randomized block, providing that similar precautions were 
taken in the preparation of the test. 

The minimum significant differences were calculated 
for the treatments in general. 

The emergence data are expressed in terms of per¬ 
centage, but the extremely low value for formaldehyde treat¬ 
ment on hulless seed makes the validity of the analysis 
questionable (27). Hayes and Immer point out that if the

percentage range is between about 25 and. 75, no modifications 
are necessary. Inasmuch as the range for these emergence 
data is between 10 and 100, the figures were converted to 
sin^ 9, using the tables by Bliss (27, p.421-3). This con¬ 
version reduces the difference by increasing the size of the 
smaller values and reducing the size of the larger (23). 

Thus the significance of the Hull x Inoculation and Treatment 
x Inoculation interactions was removed so that the emergence 
data present a similar picture to those for leaf and root 
growth. 


Effect of Seed Treatment on Victory Oats 
Inoculated with B. coronafaciens 


A similar experiment to the foregoing was made 
using clean Victory oats obtained from the Cereal Division, 
and culture of B^ coronafaciens T47. The moisture content 
of the soil for this test was lowered considerably. After 
adjusting to a 22$ moisture content, the soil was placed in 
the glass-fronted containers and seeded in the usual manner 
with inoculated and non-inoculated oats treated with Ceresan, 
Spergon, and formaldehyde. Ceresan was applied at the rate 
of 1/2 oz. per bushel and Spergon at 2 oz. per bushel. The 
formaldehyde concentration used was 1:320. The surface of 
the soil was watered with 250 cc. of tap water and the cans 
were slanted at 45 degrees in the special wooden frames.

formaldehyde treated seeds was negligible, indicating that 
this factor was more important in very moist soil. 

Inoculation with coronafaciens was effective in 
lowering the germination, emergence, root and leaf growth. 

Of the chemical seed treatments, only the Ceresan treatment 
produced a beneficial effect on the inoculated seed (Fig,7a and 7b).

sterilized soil was concerned. Since the temperatures of 
the greenhouse were well within the range of the pathogen, a 
greenhouse pot experiment was made to determine whether soil 
saprophytes have any effect upon the amount of infection by 
the seed-borne pathogen. Culture T47 was again used on 
Victory oats. 

Method 


Six-inch pots were filled with a 3:1 mixture of 
screened soil and sand. Half of the number were covered with 
paper and placed in the steam sterilizer for five hours at 15 
pounds pressure. Both series were sown, 25 seeds per pot, 
with inoculated and uninoculated oats, treated with formalde¬ 
hyde, Ceresan, and Spergon. The pots were then watered with 
sterile water and the covers were replaced. These were 
removed when the plants started to emerge, and subsequent 
waterings were made with unsterilized water. 

Emergence and leaf infection notes were taken 21 
days after seeding. 

Results 

The results are summarized in Table VIII, and the 
analysis of variance is given in Table IX. 

Ceresan and Spergon gave markedly higher numbers of 
normal seedlings, but the leaf infection ratings were somewhat 
higher than in the checks. The seedlings from non-inoculated

seeds produced no leaf lesions and the per cent emergence was 
not lowered. The inoculated seed again produced poorer 
results in spite of seed treatment with Ceresan, Spergon, and 
formaldehyde. These effects were greater in unsterilized 
soil than in sterilized soil, which may indicate some syner- 
gystic effects by soil microorganisms to B^ coronafaciens .

Discussion 

The organism in these studies had three distinct 
effects upon oat seeds and seedlings: (1) It prevented ger¬ 
mination of inoculated seeds to a significant degree. Such 
seed apparently was predisposed to attack by molds to a 
greater extent than clean seed. This was clearly observable 
through the glass fronts of the containers used, as illustrated 
in Figure 6; (2) It caused a seedling blight which often 

killed young plants up to five or six inches in height, as 
shown in Figure 3; and (3) It caused isolated lesions which, 
under greenhouse conditions, did not affect the newer growth. 

In the field, however, under suitable weather conditions, 
lesions such as these are probably the most important source

of inoculum for secondary infections. 

Seed treatment with Ceresan, Spergon, and formalde¬ 
hyde was not completely effective in the control of the patho 
gen in any of the experiments. Though Ceresan gave consis¬ 
tently higher results in emergence, leaf and root growth on 
inoculated seed, the level of the non-inoculated check was 
not reached, indicating that the control effects were 
incomplete, formaldehyde and Spergon likewise failed to give 
complete control. 

EFFECT OF SOIL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS 
ON PRIMARY INFECTION 


Since the causal organism of Halo Blight is seed- 
borne, the soil environment at the time of germination may be 
a factor in influencing the extent of primary infection. 

Controlled temperature tanks were available and were used to 
determine whether soil temperature affects the severity of 
the disease in the seedling stage of the host plant. The 
effect of the application of lime to the soil, on primary in¬ 
fection, was also investigated under different soil environ¬ 
mental conditions.

whether soil temperature is a factor in the development of 
infection of oat seedlings from seeds inoculated with B. 
coronafaclens. Sterilized and unsterilized soil was used. 


Method 

Constant temperature tanks were adjusted to 1Q°C, 
22°C, 26°C, and 30°C. An equal quantity, namely 3800 grams, 
of a 3:1 mixture of Edmonton soil and sand adjusted to 16.6% 
moisture was added to each of 32 earthenware crocks. Half 
of these were sterilized at 15 pounds pressure for eight 
hours, after watering and covering with paper to prevent con¬ 
tamination. 

Victory oats, obtained from the Cereal Division, 
were inoculated as previously described with Culture 14, 
isolated in 1941 from Erban oats obtained from Morningside 
and found to be very virulent. This seed, together with 
uninoculated seed used for controls, was seeded 10 to a pot. 

Daily temperature recordings were made at 8:00 a.m. 
and 5:30 p.m. The fluctuations of the soil temperatures were 
considered to be negligible. 

Results 

The results are tabulated in Table X. 

The controls showed no infection of the leaves in 
either sterilized or unsterilized soil. The infection ratings 
were generally higher and the emergences were generally lower

This may be 

due to 

the 


fact that antagonistic organisms in the soil which may tend 
to reduce infection have been destroyed by the soil treatment. 

The range for infection appears to be very wide,

infection.

of the organism.", but no references are cited in sup¬ 

port of this statement. An experiment was made to determine 
whether such treatment was favorable to seedling infection. 

Method 

The soil-temperature tanks were adjusted to 15°C, 
18°C, 21°C, and 26°C. Finely powdered lime was added at the 
rate of 1:400 to 3:1 Edmonton soil and sand, and well mixed. 
The same mixture without lime was used for the controls. 

Both lots were brought up to about 26$ moisture. Records of 
the total weight of the crock and soil were kept and the 
moisture content was kept approximately constant by the addi¬ 
tion of water every two days. 

Inoculated seed and the checks were prepared in 
the usual way. Culture No. 47 was used and 25 seeds were 
planted in each pot. The greenhouse temperature was adjus¬ 
ted to 65°C. 

Results 

The results are noted in Tables XI and XII. 

The results of these experiments are variable and 
inconclusive. Lime application seems to reduce infection 
somewhat. Infection appears to be more severs in unsterilized 
soil. This is opposite to the effect obtained in the first 
experiment and may be due to an interaction between the 
lime and the microflora or the use of soils from different

Discussion 

In both culture media and in soil, the temperature 
range of coronafaciens was found to be relatively wide, 
being from 10°C to 35°C, and from 14°C to 30°C respectively. 
The addition of lime to the soil appeared to have a slight 
effect in lowering seedling infection instead of raising 
it as claimed by Derick (H). 

The indications are that the damage from seed- 
borne coronafaciens is generally greater in unsteri-

synergystic effects of soil organisms. This aspect of 
microorganic relationships is further considered in the 
next section on antagonistic relations. 

ANTAGONISTIC RELATIONS OF SOME MICROORGANISMS 
TO B. CORONAFACTENS 


Introduction 


Microorganisms growing together in artificial cul¬ 
ture media may exert a synergistic association effect, or an 
antagonistic one. From the standpoint of plant diseases, 
these relations, providing they hold under natural conditions, 
may be of some practical importance, inasmuch as the presence 
of one or more other organisms may render a plant pathogen 
more or less virulent. For example, White and McCullough 
(56) showed that the presence of an associated bacterium with 
Bacterium hederae increased the damage to ivy, while the 
presence of other associated bacteria decreased the damage. 

Considerable work on the isolation of antagonistic 
substances from microorganisms has been done in the medical 
field. Dubos (14) working with the antibacterial products of 
Bacillus brevis, and Fleming (l8) with those of Penicillium 
notatum found fractions more toxic to certain pathogenic 


organisms than the most powerful bactericides known.

In the field of Plant Pathology the early work on 
this line was done by Potter (40) who, using a staled turnip 
broth culture of Pseudomonas destruens , the causal organism 
of white rot of turnip, was able to demonstrate that toxic 
metabolic products therefrom were capable of killing this 
pathogen and preventing rot, when sprayed on the turnip. Lee 
(33) noted that Pseudomonas citri disappeared in unsterilized 
soil within six days, while it increased rapidly in sterilized 
soil. He attributed this to the deleterious action of the 
soil microorganisms. This was further substantiated by the 
work of Fulton (19). Porter (39) by using antagonistic bac¬ 
teria was able to demonstrate the protection of wheat seed¬ 
lings from Helminthosporium sp. and of flax from Fusarium sp. 

That the soil microorganisms play an important part 
in the control of cereal pathogens causing foot and root rots 
was shown by Henry (28), who demonstrated that the natural 
microflora of the soil was capable of inhibiting the growth 
of such organisms as Helminthosporium sativum and Fusarium 
graminearum . Sanford and Broadfoot (43) and Broadfoot (6) 
have also shown that various bacteria are capable of inhibiting 
certain plant cereal pathogens, especially Ophiobolus graminis . 

King et al (32) attributed the beneficial effects of 
the addition of organic manures to the soil for the control 
of root rot of cotton under continuous cultivation and irri¬ 
gation to the antagonistic action of other soil microorganisms 
on the causal fungus, Phymatotrichum omnivorum .

(54) and Allen and Haenseler (2) on the preparation of toxic 
substances from fungi, indicates that these products are 
important factors in producing the antibiotic effects. Broad- 
foot (6) points out that organisms antagonistic to Ophiobolus 
graminis in culture were not always antagonistic in the soil, 
and vice versa. Thus the growth reaction on artificial media 
cannot always be considered to be a reliable index of anta¬ 
gonism in the soil. Similarly Christensen and Davies (8) 
point out that while bacteria and fungi may have a distinctly 
antibiotic effect on certain fungi in culture media, in soil 
they may not, because the toxic substances may be adsorbed on 
the soil particles and hence become too dilute to be effective. 
Moreover, other microorganisms may neutralize or destroy this 
toxic substance. For example, Botrytis cinerea growing on a 
bacterium staled medium was shown to destroy or inactivate the 
toxic substance produced by Bacillus mesentericus , while 
Ustilago zeae had no such effect. 

Cheudiakov (20) found Achromobacter and Pseudomonas 
spp. capable of lysipg various soil fungi. He was able to 
protect wheat seedlings from attack by Fusarium sp. by 
bacterizing them with lytic bacteria. Bamberg (4) and John¬ 
son (31) suggest that the antibiotic effects of certain 
bacterial isolates on zeae is due to the enzymes produced 
by the former. 

Acid production, though depressing to certain 
organisms in culture media is not considered to be a large 
factor in antibiosis in the soil, inasmuch as the strong buffer

action of most soils nullifies any effect it might have (42). 

This "antibiosis" or antagonistic relation between 
microorganisms had been generally attributed to the competi¬ 
tion for food until De Bary in 1879 pointed out that this 
relation was of a much more complex nature. The production 
of toxins, lytic principles, enzymes, acids, and competition 
for nutrients have been claimed by various workers to account 
for this effect (50). It apparently is conditioned by many 
factors such as temperature, pH, oxygen relations, etc. 

Waksman (51) has summarized the modes of interference 
of the normal processes by antibiotic substances as follows: 

(1) Oxidizing a metabolic substance which has to 
be reduced in the process of bacterial nutrition; 

(2) Rendering nutrients unavailable by combination; 

(3) Competing for an enzyme required for bacterial 
metabolism; 

(4) By affecting surface tension of bacteria; 

(5) By influencing its respiratory mechanism; 

(6) By interfering with bacterial cell division. 

Broom (5) suggests that inhibition is caused by a 

deficiency of available carbon due to the original growth and 
thus the bacteria with greater fermentive powers inhibit those 
with less. Thjoita (49) claimed that inhibition was due to 
exhaustion of accessory food factors and that the addition of 
yeast extract would revivify old cultures. The addition of 
vitamins was claimed by Broadhurst to revivify old cultures, 
likewise, but Workman (55) showed that the determining factor

was the nitrogen added in the vitamin, and that the same 
stimulation was present in the absence of the vitamin. 

The relation may be "direct" or true antagonism, 
characteristic of the action of living cells as in the case 
of Bamberg T s bacterial isolates which were antagonistic to 
the smut organism only while in the living state (4) or it 
may be "indirect" wherein the effects are due to the meta¬ 
bolic products injurious to other organisms, as in the case 
of tfeindling's filtrates from Trichoderma and Gliocladium 
which were antagonistic to Rhizoctonia . Such products may 
be: (1) bacteriostatic, such as actinomycin from Actinomyces 

antibioticus ; (2) bactericidal but not bacteriolytic, such 

as penicillin from notatum ; pyocyanin from Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa ; and glyotoxin from Gliocladium ; (3) bacteriolytic 
such as gramicidin from Bacillus brevis . 

The Application of Antagonism 
in Seed Treatment 


The effects of antagonists and their metabolic pro¬ 
ducts to plant pathogens in artificial culture media and in 
the soil has been widely studied, but little has been done on 
the utilization of their effects on seed-borne pathogens. 

Previous work at this laboratory by Campbell (7) 
has shown that the spores of Colletotrichum linicolum are 
completely lysed by a short exposure to a soil bacterium.

He points out "that in many diseases oaused by seed borne 
fungi, the surface-borne inoculum might be rendered inocuous 
by such action soon after the seed was sown, in this way pre¬ 
venting much initial infection." 

Novogrudski et al (37) showed that the bacteriza- 
tion of diseased flax seed with soil bacteria capable of 
lysing Fusarium and Colletotrichum sp. significantly decreased 
the number of diseased seedlings growing from such seed. They 
concluded that bacterization gave some promise as an effective 
control treatment for seed-borne pathogens. 

Henry and Campbell (30) noted that some seed-borne 
pathogens, such as the flax pathogen, Folyspora lini, are 
inactivated to a marked degree by the natural microflora of 
the soil, whereas others, such as certain smut fungi which 
attack cereals, are not. 

The addition of antagonists to normal soil for the 
control of specific pathogens has usually given poorer results 
than expected, owing to the various soil effects such as the 
relations of other soil microorganisms, buffering capacity of 
the soil, adsorption of the toxic products by the soil par¬ 
ticles. The direct application of antagonists or their pro¬ 
ducts to seed might, however, be effective against certain 
seed-borne pathogens, as well as in protecting the seed from 
soil organisms.

Preliminary Tests with Two Antagonists on 
Selected Bacterial Phytopathogens 


Two organisms, a yellow bacillus and Bacillus 
vulgatus , found by Ark and Hunt (3) to be strongly antagonis¬ 
tic to a large number of phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi 
were obtained from the authors, and tested on coronafaciens 
and on several other bacterial plant pathogens available in 
the laboratory collection. Suspensions of the pathogen to 
be tested were added to potato dextrose agar at 42°C, poured 
into plates and cooled. Streaks were then made with the test 
organisms. The inhibitory power was measured by the extent 
of inhibition as indicated by the clear zone surrounding the 
streak. The general results are compared with Ark’s in Table 
XIII and illustrated in Figure 8. 

It is apparent that these two antagonists differ 
widely in their action against other bacteria. For example, 
though B^ vulgatus completely inhibits B^ atrofaciens , the 
yellow bacillus has no such effect. Yet both antagonists 
almost completely inhibit A^ sepedonicum . In general the 
yellow organism is far inferior in action to B^ vulgatus .

Antagonism of Other Bacterial Plant Pathogens 
to B. coronafaciens 


An experiment was made to determine whether any of 
the other bacterial plant pathogens that were available were 
capable of an inhibiting action on the Halo Blight organism*. 

Plates were poured from a potato dextrose agar suspen¬ 
sion of Bj_ coronafaciens and after cooling were streaked with 
the nine pathogens used in the previous study.

The relative inhibitive action of two bacterial 
isolates supplied by Dr. P.A. Ark, University 
of California, on coronafaciens (centre) 
and on several other plant pathogenic 
bacteria. 


Streak on left in each plate = Ag, a yellow baccilus 
Streak on right in each plate = A-^q, B-. vulgatus 







50 


Little indication of inhibitory action as indicated 
by the formation of sterile zones around the streaks was shown 
by any of these organisms. It was concluded that the produc¬ 
tion of substances inhibitory to coronafaciens was not a 
property of any of the bacterial pathogens tested. 

Antagonism of Some Spore Formers to 
B. coronafaciens 


The property of producing bactericidal substances is 
considered to be a characteristic of many groups of soil 
spore-formers. Cultures of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megathe ¬ 
rium , Bacillus, mycoides . Bacillus subtilis , and Bacillus 
vulgatus were available. Together with an isolate of B. 
subtilis from the Department of Dairying, these were compared 
with the two organisms obtained from Ark, for their antagonis¬ 
tic action against B^_ coronafaciens . 

Little or no antagonism was shown by any of these 
isolates with the exception of Ark f s two type organisms. The 
laboratory culture of B^ vulgatus did not show the antagonis¬ 
tic action exhibited by the one supplied by Ark from California. 
This may indicate some difference in physiologic strains of 
the same organism in ability to produce antagonistic substances.

Antagonism of Soil Actinomycetes to 
B. coronafaciens 


The production of powerful inhibitors by certain 
soil actinomycetes to plant pathogens has been reported. A 
number of actinomycetes were isolated from Alberta soils 
representative of the black, brown, and grey wooded soils. 

These were tested for antagonistic effects by inoculating 
plates of potato dextrose agar suspensions of coronafaciens . 

While many of the actinomycetes produced pigments 
that rapidly diffused into the surrounding media, little or 
no inhibitory effect was apparent. Some showed a very slow 
lytic action on colonies of the oat pathogen surrounding the 
inoculum, but in general these organisms were considered to 
be of little value. 

Antagonistic reactions of Isolates from Soil and 
Plant Tissue to B. coronafaciens 


The most promising antagonistic organisms found were 
certain bacteria isolated from dilutions of soil and macerated 
plant tissue. These were tested as before on potato dextrose 
agar suspensions of the Halo Blight organism. The best of 
these, as evaluated by the extent of the zone of inhibition, 
were retained and compared with Ark’s organisms for their 
inhibitory action. The sources and inhibitory ratings of the

* A9 = B^ vulgatus and A10 = yellow bacillus, isolates 
provided by Dr. P. A. Ark. 


The production of the sterile zones was apparent 
in two to four days of incubation at room temperature. At 
least six isolates were obtained which were considered 
superior antagonists to the two organisms, namely A9 and A10 
obtained from Dr.p.A.Ark an$ used for test purposes (see 
Figure 9). 

To determine whether the clear areas around the 
antagonists contained inhibitory substances, circles of agar 
were cut out of these zones of inhibition with a small steri¬ 
lized cork borer, and planted on potato dextrose agar

suspensions of B^ ooronafaclens , and incubated at room temper¬ 
ature. Circles from the sterile zones of A42 were the only 
ones which gave even a slight indication of a residual inhi¬ 
bitory action. A marked contrast was shown by the distinct 
and clear-cut circular zones produced by circles contaminated 
with the antagonist. Thus, it is fairly certain that the 
living cultures will be more effective in antibiosis than the 
metabolic products, in so far as these isolates are concerned. 

Four general reactions of other bacteria on 
plates of coronafaciens were noted: (1) the organism 
itself was inhibited as shown by the sparse growth along the 
inoculation streak; (2) the organism was compatible with the 
pathogen, and was in some cases stimulated as shown by the 
good growth along the streak; (3) the organism displayed a 
bacteriostatic -action, whereby the growth of the pathogen was 
merely checked, as illustrated by isolate A6 in Figure 9; 

(4) the organism inhibited the pathogen, in which case the 
line of demarcation between the sterile zone and the region 
of growth of coronafaciens was well marked. This is also 
shown in Figure 9 by the isolates in the top row, A8, A25, and 
A42.

isolates of bacteria were found to be far more effective anta¬ 
gonists of coronafaciens than the ones obtained from 
California for comparative purposes. Two of the best, A8 and 
A42 were compared with these California isolates, designated 
A9 ( vulgatus ) and A10 (yellow organism), for their effect 
upon the Halo Blight organism applied to the oat seed. 

Method 

A sample of Victory oats was inoculated with culture 
T47 of B^_ coronafaciens in the manner previously described. 

The inoculated seed was dried at room temperature for four 
days. Inoculated and non-inoculated seed was then soaked in 
separate water suspensions of the antagonists A8, A9, A10, 
and A42, and some in sterile water to serve as checks. The 
seed was finally dried at room temperature for two days. 

The glass-fronted containers were then filled with 
a 4:1 mixture of Edmonton soil and sand, adjusted to a 21% 
moisture content. The seed was sown, 25 to a can, one inch 
deep, embryo pointing downwards and against the glass. The 
containers were then watered with 250 cc. of water and placed 
in wooden frames at an angle of 45 degrees. Daily recordings 
of the root growth were made as previously described. 

Results 

The results are given in Table XV and the summary of 
the analysis of variance shown in Table XVI. The daily root

Inoculation with coronafaciens was effective in 
producing the symptoms of the disease and a general reduction 
in emergence and growth of the seedlings from non-bacterized 
seed (Figure 10). 

The antagonists varied in their effects upon the con¬ 
taminated seed, but A42, the yellow organism isolated from an 
oat glume, was the only one which induced a marked increase 
in germination, emergence, root and leaf length. The rela¬ 
tively little difference in damage between contaminated and 
non-contaminated seed when bacterized with A42 is illustrated 
in Figure 11. The marked improvement in emergence and root 
growth as a result of bacterization is apparent when Figure 
11A is compared with Figure 10A.

The high germination of contaminated seed treated 
with A42, and the high survival of the seedlings therefrom 
indicate a high protective value by A42. This is further 
shown by the relatively small percentage of seedlings attacked 
by molds. The antagonistic action, however, was not complete, 
inasmuch as the typical symptoms of seedling infection caused 
by B_j_ coronafaciens appeared on 3$ of the plants. 

None of the other antagonists showed any significant 
beneficial or detrimental effects, although there is some 
indication that A8 increased the damage by reducing the root 
growth somewhat. 

In spite of the relatively large amount of inoculum 
added, the disease symptoms as expressed by leaf lesioning 
were not sufficiently severe to show clearly differential 
effects resulting from bacterization. The germination and, 
to a lesser extent, the emergence appear to give a good index 
of the damaging effect of contamination of the seed with B. 
coronafaciens . 

The Effect of Fungal Isolates on Oats 
Inoculated with B. coronafaciens 


Many of the common fungi are also known to have 
antagonistic effects on specific plant pathogens. It has 
been noted that the production of pigment is often associated 
with antagonistic properties. A number of pigment producers

were therefore isolated and tested on B^_ coronafaciens carried 
upon the oat seed. Trichoderma 1001, found to be antagonistic 
toward 0^ graininis and other fungi by Ludwig (34), was used 
for comparative purposes. 

Isolates A12, A18, and A26 were obtained from soil 
dilution plates, Ac from manure, and Ao from a contaminated 
culture. All were Penicilliums with the exception of A26 
which was a species of Aspergillus . 

Method 


The inoculated seed was prepared as for the former 
experiment with bacterial antagonists. Heavy spore suspen¬ 
sions of Trichoderma 1001, Penicilliums Ac, Ao, A12, A18, and 
Aspergillus A26, grown on 2 % potato dextrose agar, were applied 
to separate lots of inoculated and non-inoculated seed. This 
was then air dried at room temperature for two days. 

The seed was sown in six-inch pots containing a 3:1 
mixture of Edmonton soil and sand mixture. One half of the 
pots of soil were sterilized and the other half left unsteri¬ 
lized. The sterilized series was prepared by covering the 
pots with paper and autoclaving for eight hours at 15 pounds 
pressure. After sowing the pots were watered with sterile 
water. The paper covers were retained on the sterilized pots 
and were removed when the seedlings began to emerge. 

Data on emergence and leaf infection were taken 21 


days after seeding

Results 

The results are summarized in Table XVII and the 
analysis of variance in Table XVIII. A highly significant 
decrease in emergence resulted from inoculation with B. 
coronafaciens . The non-inoculated series shows no disease 
symptoms as expected, while the inoculated series shows a 
varied reaction to the addition * of the dif¬ 

ferent fungi. 

In sterilized soil all the fungal isolates tended to 
reduce leaf infection, but in unsterilized soil A1Q and A26 
tended to increase it, possibly owing to some synergystic 
effect. Penicilliums Ao and A12, however, gave promising 
indications of increasing emergence and decreasing leaf infec¬ 
tion. Triehoderma 1001 did not appear to produce the anta¬ 


gonistic effects it does against fungus pathogens.

Discussion 

All the phytopathogenic organisms tested by Ark 
were not available. Of those that were, the results were 
substantially the same when treated with B^ vulgatus but not 
with the yellow organism. The latter was reported to be 
antagonistic to both B^_ carotovorus and B^ tumefaciens , but 
this could not be confirmed with our cultures of these 
organisms. 

A marked difference is shown in the reaction of the 
bacterial plant pathogens to these two antagonists, ranging

from no inhibition to complete inhibition. vulgatus is 
generally far more efficient in this respect than the yellow 
organism. This is illustrated in Figure Q. A^ sepedonicum 
and striafaciens are almost completely inhibited by both 
antagonists, but atrofaciens is completely inhibited only 
by B_j_ vulgatus . This illustrates specificity of antibiotic 
reactions. 

A number of isolations from plant tissue and soil 
dilutions were made that exhibited far greater antagonism 
toward B, coronafaciens on culture media than the antagonists 
obtained from Ark. Most of the effective isolates were 
chromogenic, though an especially good white organism was 
obtained. Selected plant pathogens, the B^ subtilis and the 
soil actinomycetes used were not so successful in the produc¬ 
tion of antibiotic substances. 

Evidence of protective action by bacterial and fungal 
antagonists to seed contaminated with coronafaciens was 
found. Bacterial isolate A42 and Penicillium A26 were con¬ 
sidered to be especially effective in reducing pre-emergence 
blight and, to a lesser extent, seedling leaf infection. In 
this respect these particular isolates were far superior to 
the antagonistic organisms used for comparative purposes in 
these tests, namely B^ vulgatus and a yellow organims used 
by Ark and Hunt (3), and a Trichoderma used by Ludwig (34). 

It is suggested that the application of suspensions 
of specific bacterial and fungal microorganisms to contaminated 
seed gives some promise as a method for control of Halo Blight 
of oats.

EFFECT OF SEED TREATMENT ON THE OAT HOST PLANT 
AND ON OTHER CEREALS 


Introduction 


A great deal of work has been done on the effect 
of seed treatment on various pathogens without sufficient 
attention being given to the reactions of the seed of their 
host plants to the chemical used. Thus, in the previous 
studies for the control of coronafaciens . formaldehyde 
gave some measure of control but the damaging effects to the 
host plant of such treatment overshadowed the benefit due to 
this control. 

These studies were undertaken chiefly to acquire 
information on the effect of seed fungicides such as formal¬ 
dehyde and Ceresan on the host itself. Since the same 
fungicides as are used for oats are likely to be applied to 
other cereals on the farm, studies were also made with 
several of these for comparative purposes. 

Considerable use of the glass-faced galvanized iron 
containers, as described in the previous experiments, was 
made. These allowed observations on the daily root growth 
and also on the protection offered by various chemicals as 
shown by the amount of mold attack and the time of pre¬ 
emergence blight of germinated seeds.

and sand were used in all the tests, unless otherwise indi¬ 
cated, at moisture levels as noted. The temperature of the 
greenhouse was thermostatically controlled at about 68° to 
70°C. 


Preliminary Experiment on the Effect of Seed 
Treatment with Ceresan and Formaldehyde 
on Oats, Barley, and Rye 


A preliminary experiment was made using three 
cereal grains treated with formaldehyde 1:320 and Ceresan 
1/2 oz. In the former treatment the seed was dipped in 
formaldehyde 1:320 solution for two minutes, drained, covered 
for four hours, and dried at room temperature. In the latter 
treatment, Ceresan at the rate of 1/2 oz. per bushel was 
shaken with 100-gram lots of the seed in small Erlenmeyer 
flasks, which were plugged with cotton bungs, and left over¬ 
night . 

Victory oats, O.A.C. 21 barley, and Dakold winter 
rye were used. The seed was sown in the glass-fronted con¬ 
tainers containing 8400 grams of a 3:1 soil and sand mixture. 
After sowing 1600 cc. of tap water were added, and the cans 
were placed in frames at an angle of 45 degrees. 

Observations were started on the third day after 
seeding. The glass was marked off at one-inch intervals from 
the seed level, one inch below the soil surface. The number

of the lower limit of the area thus marked off from the seed 
level. These results were then added to give an estimate of 
the total length of roots per container.

The results are summarized in Table XIX, and the 
daily root growth is shown in Appendix IV.

Neither Ceresan nor formaldehyde had any significant 
beneficial or detrimental effects on the root growth of bar¬

On rye, Ceresan had a marked beneficial effect, but formalde¬

root growth. 

Some difficulty was encountered by roots not growing 
close to the glass throughout their whole length, and thus 
observer error may account for the anomalies noted in the 
daily root growth. However, these were generally ironed out 
on averaging. 

Effect of Seed Treatment with Different Concentrations 
of Ceresan on the Root Growth of 
Clean Oats and Wheat 


The effect of different concentrations of Ceresan, 
varying from 1/2 oz. to 3 oz. per bushel, on the leaf growth 
and emergence of wheat was studied by Grimble (23). In 
general a definite increase in emergence and height at the 
recommended rate of 1/2 oz. was shown. A similar trend was 
obtained in the yield tests. Overdoses of Ceresan at rates 
higher than 1 oz. per bushel were found to be injurious when 
the moisture content of the seed was high, and when the treat¬ 
ment was carried out in tightly stoppered flasks. 

This experiment was made chiefly to compare the 
effect on root growth of treatment with Ceresan at half the 
recommended rate with treatment at higher rates. If the low 
rate should be sufficient for protection, the cost of treat¬ 
ment would be reduced considerably.

Method 

The glass-fronted galvanized iron cans previously 
mentioned were used. Each container was filled with 8400 
grams of 3:1 air-dry mixture of Edmonton soil and sand, then 
watered with 1600 cc. of water. The pH of the soil was 6.1. 
Clean Victory oats and Red Bobs wheat, threshed as under 
ordinary farm conditions were the varieties tested. The per¬ 
centages of wheat seed with damaged embryo covering was 17.5%. 

Treatments at the following rates were made: 0, 1/4, 
1/2, and 1 oz. per bushel. The grain was treated in 100-gram 
lots with weighed amounts of undiluted Ceresan. The seed was 
shaken with the Ceresan in glass bottles in a shaker machine 
for five minutes. It was then allowed to stand for 38 hours 
in wide-mouthed bottles covered with two layers of cotton 
cloth, to simulate ordinary methods of treatment. 

The seed was sown, 25 seeds to a can, with the 
embryo pointing downwards and against the glass, at a depth 
of one inch. 

The usual greenhouse space was not available for 
this experiment and a side bench was used instead. The loca¬ 
tion was such that half of the frames were close to an annex 
wall and the other half to a glass outside wall. It was 
observed that, in the early stages of germination, the dif¬ 
ference between the 1/4 oz. Ceresan treatment and the check 
was more marked in the cans near the inside wall than in those 
next to the outside wall. The explanation probably lies in

the extremely cold weather at the time of this experiment. 
Though the temperature of the greenhouse section was thermo¬ 
statically controlled at 6Q°F, the soil temperature of the 
cans close to the outside glass walls was about Q°F lower in 
the mornings than that in the others. 

After the first root length readings were taken, the 
experiment was moved to another bench where the temperatures 
could be kept more constant throughout the block. 

Results 


The results are summarized in Table XX and the daily 
root growth is given in Appendix V. 

The beneficial effects of the Ceresan 1/4 oz. on 
the root growth were especially noticeable on the second day 
after germination, but these differences were generally less 
apparent as the experiment progressed. 

The treatment of clean Victory oats in the usual 
manner with Ceresan at different rates gave a significant 
increase of root growth only at the 1/4 oz. rate. Emergence 
and leaf length of oats were not appreciably affected by the 
treatments. With Red Bobs wheat, all the Ceresan rates gave 
marked increases in leaf length. The indicated improvements 
in emergence and root lengths, however, did not prove to be 
statistically significant under the conditions of this experi¬ 


ment

Effect of Seed Treatment on Injured and 
Uninjured Wheat and Oats 


In the studies of the effects of seed treatment on 
grain, the condition of the seed should be taken into consider¬ 
ation. The amount of injury may vary with the variety and 
threshing methods. For example, grain threshed in a small 
rod-row machine may show a greater proportion of seed with 
broken or cracked embryo coverings than grain threshed with a

field machine. This injured seed may be expected to react to 
a greater extent than normal seed to the chemicals used in 
seed treatment. 

Method with V/heat 

Red Bobs wheat, threshed with a field machine was 
used. This was found to contain 25.6 per cent of damaged 
seed. To obtain the necessary number of damaged seeds for the 
test, artificial injury was resorted to, whereby the embryo 
covering was slit with a needle without damaging the embryo 
itself. 

In the formaldehyde treatment the seeds were immersed 
in a 1:320 solution, drained and covered with cheesecloth for 
four hours and dried overnight. The dusts were added to the 
seed lots in Manila coin envelopes, shaken and also left over¬ 
night, each treatment separate from the others. Ceresan was 
applied at the rate of 1/2 oz. per bushel, and Nomersan and 
Spergon each at 2 oz. per bushel. The checks were similarly 
shaken and stored. 

The glass-fronted cans were used, each filled with 
8600 grams of finely sifted dry mixture of 3:1 Edmonton soil 
and sand. The seed was sown ten to a can, one inch deep, 
embryo pointing downwards and against the glass. The containers 
were watered by replicates with 2000 cc. of tap water, and 
placed in their frames. 

Seed was considered to have germinated when the roots

The daily germination records indicate that of the 
five treatments on injured and uninjured wheat only the for¬ 
maldehyde on the injured seed appreciably reduces the rate of 
germination. The differences on the third day after planting 
are significant, but these tend to disappear and, by the 14th 
day, they are no longer apparent. Moreover artificial injury 
to the embryo covering actually caused little difference in 
the final number of germinated seeds. In spite of this the 
differences in emergence are highly significant. With injured 
seed only Ceresan treatment increases emergence, while formal¬ 
dehyde and Nomersan lower it. With uninjured normal seed 
both Ceresan and Spergon show marked benefit while formalde¬ 
hyde and Nomersan again lower the emergence significantly.

Obviously all the seeds which germinate do not emerge. The 
conclusion is that between germination and emergence death 
has resulted, and therefore the difference in germination and 
emergence of the same plants should give some index of the 
value of the treatment. These differences are shown in Table 
XXIII.

Artificial injury tends to have an over all detri¬ 
mental effect on both germination and emergence. It is 
apparent from the above table that in the case of uninjured 
seed, Ceresan and Spergon produce the most beneficial results 
in so far as emergence is concerned. With injured seed the 
same trend is shown, though the checks do better than might

be expected, probably because the broken covering permits 
quicker absorption of water, allowing an earlier start for 
the seedling. 

Formaldehyde greatly slows down the rate of growth 
and, while the percentage germination is not markedly low, 
especially when the seed is uninjured, the emergence tends to 
be low and the percentage of the non-surviving seedlings is 
very high. 

The explanation of these results is considered to 
lie with certain soil sarophytes, mainly Penlcillium and 
Mucor spp. and bacteria. The time that the seed showed evi¬ 
dence of attack was noted and the per cent daily attack of 
the wheat seedlings by soil saprophytes is tabulated in Table 
XXIV.

The results with injured seed are especially interest¬ 
ing. With the formaldehyde treatment the slowing down of the 
rate of growth so encouraged attack by soil organisms that in 
two weeks 70$ of the seeds and seedlings from injured seed 
were affected. This of course does not mean that all were 
necessarily killed, as many seeds were attacked after the seed¬ 
lings emerged. Many of the latter were stunted, as shown by 
the leaf data. The Ceresan treatment on the other hand gave 
a high degree of protection, only 8$ of the seeds showing 
attack. Neither Spergon nor Nomersan show much protective 
action and, in fact, both seem to encourage the growth of 
microorganisms under the conditions of this experiment. 

With normal seed, formaldehyde again tends to en¬ 
courage mold and bacterial growth, while all the other treat¬ 
ments tend to exert some protective effect, the greatest 
amount again being shown by Ceresan.

Injury to the seed resulted in a significant 
decrease in leaf length of seedlings from seed treated with 
formaldehyde, while it resulted in a significant decrease 
of root growth only in the case of the checks. 

The effect of seed treatment on leaf growth and root 
growth was significantly detrimental only in the case of for¬ 
maldehyde treatment on both injured and uninjured seed. 

Ceresan gave indications of benefit on both injured and un¬ 
injured seed, while Spergon appeared to benefit normal seeds 
to a greater extent than injured seed. 

Experiment with Oats 

An experiment was made with Victory oats to deter¬ 
mine whether the effect of injury and seed treatment was 
similar to that for wheat. The hulls were removed, and a 
portion of the seed-lot was artificially injured as in the 
previous experiment, using a needle. The seed was treated 
with formaldehyde, Ceresan, and ©pergon as in the preced¬ 
ing experiment and sown in the glass-fronted containers at the 
rate of 25 seeds per can. 

Results 

The results are summarized in Table XXVT and the 
daily growth of the roots is recorded in Appendix XI. The 
figures for the formaldehyde treatments were so low that they 
were not included in the analysis of variance shown in Table 
XXVII.

The emergence analysis indicates that the variabi¬ 
lity due to seed injury is very high with all treatments. 
Formaldehyde markedly lowered emergence of both injured and 
uninjured seed but Ceresan and Spergon greatly increased it. 

A similar effect in general was shown by the leaf length and 
root length data. In the case of the latter the damage- 
treatment interaction indicates that the treatments affect 
damaged and undamaged seed differently. The same trend, 
while not significant, is evident in the case of the emergence 
and leaf length figures. This is apparently due to the fact 
that Ceresan exerts a detrimental effect on injured seed and 
a beneficial effect on normal seed, while Spergon shows a 
greater increase than Ceresan with injured seed but a lesser 
increase with uninjured seed. 

Effects of Seed Treatment of Injured and Uninjured 
Seed in Sterilized and Unsterilized Soil 


The claim has been made that some of the beneficial 
effects of certain seed treatments result from chemical stimu¬ 
lation of the seed. However, under natural dconditions the 
effect on the seed itself is not readily separated from that 
on the soil microflora. If a definite increase can be shown 
to be due to the chemical in the absence of soil microorganisms, 
this claim may have some foundation.

Method 


Glazed six-inch pots were filled with 1400 grams of 
air-dry 3:1 soil-sand mixture, moistened with 330 cc. of water 
covered with newspaper and sterilized for 15 hours at 15 
pounds pressure. After seeding 25 seeds per pot, 320 grams of 
sterile soil was placed on top. A similar series unsterilized 
was used as a control. The pots were then watered. 

The seed used was of the Red Bobs variety. Each 
kernel was examined to ensure that the only difference between 
a normal seed and an injured seed was the broken embryo cover¬ 
ing of the latter. Seeds with cracked endosperms were dis¬ 
carded. Only about 25 c /o of the seeds in the sample had damaged 
coverings, so the deficiency was made up by artificial injury 
as in the previous experiment. The seed was treated in the 
usual manner. 

To determine the effect of treatment on the rate of 
emergence, counts were made at four-hour intervals for three 
days and at 12- and 24-hour intervals for some time later. 
These data are recorded in Appendix VIII. After 14 days of 
growth, the plants were carefully washed free of soil and the 
top and root lengths were measured to the nearest inch. They 
were then freed of the old seed, dried, and the dry weight 
was determined.

The treatments in general show significant differ¬ 
ences in emergence and in the lengths and weights of the roots 
and leaves. When the data are broken up, these differences 
in the case of root growth are shown to be due to the inter¬ 
action between treatments and soil. That is in the unsterilized 
soil the chemical treatments have a different effect than they 
have in sterilized soil. This is especially apparent in the 
case of the formaldehyde.treatment which is illustrated in 
Figure 15. The effect of Ceresan, while markedly beneficial 
in the case of emergence and in-root and leaf growth in 
unsterilized soil, shows little of this benefit in sterilized 
soil. Sterilization of the soil generally improved the

seedling growth of untreated seed, but the use of Ceresan 
brought the level of the growth in unsterilized soil to that 
of the check in sterilized soil. This is illustrated in 
Figure 14. 

A comparison of normal wheat seed with seed having 
the covering broken shows that the emergence was not appre¬ 
ciably lowered by any of the treatments. The emergence, 
however, was impaired in certain cases. Not all of the seed 
that germinated was able to survive and send seedlings above 
the soil surface. This is well illustrated by the formalde¬ 
hyde treatment. In sterilized soil uninjured wheat treated 
with this chemical was equally as good as that of the checks 
(Figure 12, lower left) but in unsterilized soil the damage 
was very great in spite of the fact that the germination had 
been 94$. Obviously, between the times of germination and 
emergence, many of the seedlings were killed, presumably by 
the attack of soil organisms. 

It would appear that the protective action to seed 
of chemicals could be evaluated by comparing the differences 
between the emergence and germination figures. On this basis 
Ceresan appears to have a high protective action on both 
injured and uninjured seed, Spergon on uninjured seed, and 
formaldehyde on neither injured nor uninjured seed. 

Moreover, injured seed might be expected to be 
attacked by soil saprophytes more than uninjured, and this 
generally held for the formaldehyde, Nomersan, and Spergon 
treated seed. However, the injured seed checks showed far

less mold damage than normal seed, possibly owing to a 
quicker utilization of the soil moisture because of the 
broken seed coats. The Ceresan treated injured seed also 
showed little mold damage owing to a protective action by 
the chemical or to a stimulation which promoted faster growth 
of the plant. 

In the opinion of Popoff (38) the stimulation of the 
organic mercury dusts is not restricted to the period of 
germination but is carried on to the close of vegetation. 

The existence of such a stimulation is not generally accepted 
(23) but the appreciable increases in emergence over the 
checks, due to Ceresan on both injured and uninjured wheat 
and to Nomersan in injured wheat in sterilized soil, where 
presumably no saprophytes are present, indicates some stimu¬ 
lation by the chemicals. This increase, due to Ceresan, is 
not carried into the leaf and root data. That due to Nomer¬ 
san is apparent in the root growth but only with injured seed 
in sterilized soil. In the case of Spergon the stimulation 
reported by Garrow (21) and McNew (36) for peas seems entirely 
absent with wheat. (See Figure 13, upper left). 

The indications are that in unsterilized soil both 
Ceresan and Spergon have a marked beneficial effect especially 
upon uninjured seed. Spergon tends to give an earlier start 
in emergence but is surpassed by Ceresan in sterilized soil. 
(See Appendix VIII). In unsterilized soil Spergon treated 
seed shows the greatest root length (Figure 13)* Formalde¬ 
hyde treatment consistently had a detrimental effect through-

out the experiment. 


Discussion 


Seed treatment may have two main effects on clean 
seed: (1) a direct effect on the host, either stimulatory or 

phytocidal; (2) a protective action against soil saprophytes. 

The increase in emergence due to treatment in 
sterilized soil where no soil saprophytes are present is 
attributed to a stimulatory effect by the chemical. Indica¬ 
tions of this are shown only by the Ceresan treatment among 
those tested. 

Ceresan however may also have severe phytocidal 
effects if it is applied to moist seed. This is clearly 
illustrated by the experiment with inoculated hulled and 
hulless oats (Page 19). A severe phytocidal effect is also 
shown when dehulled oats with the pericarp broken are treated 
with Ceresan. The symptoms here are typical of Ceresan injury 
as reported by Sass (45), including swollen roots and leaves 
accompanied by stunted growth. The protective action of 
Ceresan against soil saprophytes is well demonstrated by 
the marked decrease in mold damage. Thus it is apparent that, 
with this chemical, there is a fine balance between damage 
and benefit. 

No phytocidal effect by Spergon was demonstrated. 

The stimulatory action reported on peas (36) was not apparent, 
in the case of wheat. Under natural conditions, however, with

unsterilized wheat and uninjured seed Spergon treatment 
showed a marked beneficial effect, indicating a highly effec¬ 
tive protection against soil saprophytes. It is noted, how¬ 
ever, that this protection is lessened under conditions of 
excessive soil moisture. Under such condtions, the attack by 
molds and other organisms does not appear to be checked. 

Formaldehyde treatment appears to slow down the 
rate of growth definitely (Figure 12). With wheat, decreases 
in emergence often occur. In the absence of soil microor¬ 
ganisms, however, this decrease is very small either with 
injured or uninjured seed. The explanation is that in 
sterilized soil the soil saprophytes that normally would 
gain ready entrance through damaged seed coats have been 
killed. Growth is only slightly impaired by the seed injury, 
but though this injury in itself is not harmful, in unsteri¬ 
lized soil in the presence of the soil microorganisms, marked 
ill effects are caused. (Figure 16). 

The justification for treating clean seed with 
Ceresan as a routine procedure is that the emergence and 
yield are increased (23). On the other hand, Greaney and 
Machacek (24) state that unless an appreciable amount of con¬ 
tamination is present, treatment of the seed is unnecessary. 

The environmental conditions such as soil type, pH, 
microorganic flora, undoubtedly have some bearing on the 
value of seed treatment. For example Henry and Ludwig (57) 
have shown that seed treatment of peas with Ceresan may be 
of greater value in a brown soil than in a sandy soil.

It appears that the improvement to wheat by Spergon 
treatment is primarily due to a protective action against 
soil microorganisms, while that by Ceresan is due to an early 
short period of stimulation to the germinating seed, in addi¬ 
tion to a protective action. Formaldehyde, on the other hand, 
appears to have a phytocidal and non-protective action. 

It should be noted that the Improvement due to seed 
treatment cannot be wholly judged by such characters as root 
length and leaf growth. The improvement in health and stand 
is often apparent to the eye but difficult to tabulate. This 
is illustrated in Figure 16 where hulless oats treated with 
Ceresan is compared with that treated with formaldehyde and 
untreated checks.

SUMMARY 


1. Halo Blight of oats occurs widely in Alberta. It 
probably causes more damage than is attributed to it. 

2. Bacterium coronafaciens , the causal organism of Halo 
Blight, was isolated from infected leaves and heads of Erban 
oats from an Alberta field. 

3. Alberta isolates of coronafaciens were found to 
agree in essential characters with pure cultures of this 
organism. When artificially inoculated on Victory oats they 
proved to be pathogenic. 

4. Twenty-nine varieties of oats artificially inoculated 
all proved susceptible in varying degrees to local isolates of 
the pathogen. 

5. Oat seed inoculated with coronafaciens produced 
seedlings showing symptoms of primary infection. The following 
were the main effects: (1) prevention of seed from germinating 
(2) blighting of young seedlings; (3) lesioning of the first 
leaves. 

6. The soil temperature range for primary infection was 
found to be 14°0 to 28°C. 

7. Seed treatment with neither Ceresan, Spergon nor for¬ 
maldehyde completely prevented infection of oat seedlings from

seed contaminated with coronafaciens . 

8. Certain bacteria isolated from soil and plant tissue 
were highly antagonistic to coronafaciens in culture media. 
These were superior to antagonists obtained from other sources 
for comparison. 

9. Some of the above mentioned antagonists, when applied 
to oat seeds contaminated with coronafaciens t reduced the 
severity of seedling infection. 

10. A fungal antagonist, namel y Penicillium Ac, applied 
to contaminated oats, also reduced the severity of primary in¬ 
fection. 

11. Formaldehyde treatment caused severe injury, especi¬ 
ally to hulless oats and damaged wheat, owing to retarding the 
growth rate and predisposing the seed to attack by soil sapro¬ 
phytes. 

12. Ceresan had a slight stimulatory effect on wheat as 
measured by seedling emergence. It was highly effective in 
protecting the seed against attack of soil saprophytes. The 
treatment showed more benefit to uninjured seed than to injured 
seed. 

13. Nomersan stimulated wheat seedling emergence and 
caused a marked increase in root growth with injured seed in 
sterilized soil. It had little protective action against soil 
saprophytes.

14 * Spergon increased the rate of emergence and had a 

beneficial effect on clean seed oats and wheat. It was not 
effective against soil saprophytes in soil with a high mois¬ 
ture oontent. 

15. Mechanical injury to oat and wheat seed was not 
great in itself. The detrimental effects appeared to be due 
to increased attack by soil saprophytes. 

16. Both Spergon and Ceresan applied to clean uninjured 
seed of wheat and oats tended to increase the emergence, leaf 
and root growth. The greatest response was obtained in 
unsterilized soil, which suggests that under natural field con¬ 
ditions such treatments should have beneficial effects.
