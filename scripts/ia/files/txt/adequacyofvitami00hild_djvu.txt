THE ADEQUACY OF VITAMIN C IN ALBERTA DIETS 

I. INTRODUCTION: 

It has been known since Captain Cook's time, (1772) 
that citrus fruits are antiscorbutic, but it is only- 
in recent years that the active ingredient, namely 
Vitamin C, has been isolated and synthesized. The 
first work done on this was by Szent-G-yorgyi in 1928 
on an entirely different problem, that of oxidation- 
reduction systems in plants. During his investigation, 
he isolated a strongly reducing substance, which he 
named hexuronic acid. The first suggestion that hex- 
uronic acid might be identical with vitamin G, came 
from McKinnis and King (1930), but it was not until 
1932, that Svirbely and Szent-Gyorgyi stated definitely 
that vitamin C and hexuronic acid were identical. In 
the same year King and Waugh (1932) in America, 
isolated the crystalline vitamin C and noted the 
similarity to hexuronic acid. That the two are iden¬ 
tical, was later confirmed by other workers. 

The establishment of the identity of vitamin C 
along with Tillmans 1 discovery of an easy chemical 
method of estimation of vitamin C, (Tillmans et al-1932)

stimulated further research immensely, Tillmans made 
use of the reduction of 2,6, - dichlorophenol indophenol 
by vitamin C for its determination. His original 
method has since been modified to increase its specif¬ 
icity for ascorbic acid, by preventing interference 
through the presence of such substances as phenols, 
glutathione, and tannins. An extensive review of the 
indophenol and other methods is given by Bessey (1938) 3 , 
while King (1939) gives notes on the precautions neces¬ 
sary in the use of the 2,6,-dichlorophenol indophenol 
method. This latter method is today accepted as the 
most accurate chemical means of estimating ascorbic 
acid, especially if used in conjunction with the photo¬ 
electric colorimeter, which eliminates the large error 
inherent in the titration of deeply colored extracts, 
(Bessey, 1938) 4 . But to prove that vitamin C is really 
present in a tissue, we still have to resort to biological 
assay. 

The simplification of vitamin C determination, has 
opened up a vast field for surveys of the best and 
cheapest sources of the vitamin. In practically every 
country of the world this type of analysis has been 
carried on. In England, Olliver (1936, 1940) has made 
an extensive five year survey, of the sources of 
vitamin G, and the effects of canning, cooking and

storage on vegetables and fruits. Levy and Fox (1935) 
found the vitamin C content of fresh young alfalfa 
shoots to be 3 to 4 mg. per gm. of tissue, which is 
four times the potency of oranges. In Norway, Natvig 
(1939) gives values as high as 2200 mg. per 100 gm. 
of dried flesh of deep red rose hips. Winckelmann (1938) 
has found values up to 400 mg.% on the fresh hip pulp. 

Although these surveys have been carried out in 
numerous places, no extensive ones have been done in 
Canada. It is generally known that the vitamin C content 
of vegetables and fruits varies with the season, variety, 
soil conditions and locality. Therefore values obtained 
in other countries cannot always be accepted as criteria 
for the values for Canadian products. It is thus con¬ 
sidered desirable that surveys of Canadian vegetables 
and fruits should be performed, as an aid in estab¬ 
lishing dietary sources and intake of vitamin C. 

To determine the adequacy of the dietary intake, 
it was considered useful to do vitamin C excretion 
tests on several subjects, subsisting on the diets 
analysed. Many investigators have been seeking a prac¬ 
tical and simple method whereby vitamin G deficiency of 
a person can be readily estimated. Thus, much research 
has been done on an analysis of vitamin C in urine, to 
determine if the excretion has a fixed and definite

relationship to the body needs of the vitamin. Estab¬ 
lishment of such a relationship would be of practical 
importance to medicine, but so far experimental results 
have been many and varied. 

It has been confirmed that the excretion of ascorbic 
acid in the urine is dependent on the tissue saturation, 
(Johnson and Zilva, 1934: Kellie and Zilva, 1939: 
Spellberg and Kelton, 1939), which in turn is dependent 
on the previous diet. The excretion varies so greatly, 
even with the same individual, that it is difficult to 
state in arbitrary figures, the normal value for all 
people, (Johnson and Zilva, 1934). Spellberg and 
Kelton (1939), on surveying the literature, put the 
minimum normal excretion at 20 mg. per 24 hours. Harris, 
Ray and Ward (1933) noted that the normal daily output 
remained fairly constant at 30 - 33 mg., but in later 
work (Abbasy, Harris, Ray and Marrack, 1935), they state 
20 mg. per day to be the excretion on a moderately low 
intake and 10 - 15 mg. per day represents the border¬ 
line group. However, Evelyn, Malloy and Rosen (1938) 
have found with the photo-electric colorimeter method, 
that apparently normal healthy individuals have a 24 
hour excretion of 5 mg. or less. Thus it is evident 
that some doubt exists as to the value of analysing for 
urinary vitamin C, as an indication of dietary adequacy

in vitamin C. 

A better indication of dietary adequacy in vitamin 
C, is tissue saturation which is determined by titration 
of urine samples, before and after the administration 
of excessive test doses. The percentage excretion of 
the dose is low if the tissues are unsaturated, and if 
fully saturated about 60 - 80 % will be excreted in 24 
hours, (Baumann, 1937), but 50% or more of the test 
dose excreted in 24 hours can be taken as an indication 
of saturation (Smith, 1938), On the basis of these 
tests, the daily requirement has been put as high as 
100 mg. 

Although these determinations give some knowledge 
as to the saturation of the tissues, it is doubtful if 
this state is necessary for optimum health. Bietsehel 
and Mensching (1939) experimented with a vitamin G free 
diet, on which one of them lived for 100 days without 
manifestation of prescorbutic symptoms. He appeared 
quite as healthy at the end of the 100 days as he had 
been at the beginning, although the level of vitamin 
C in the blood and the excretion in the urine were 
practically zero. They say that a daily intake of 15 
mg. may be adequate. 

It is apparent that the literature on vitamin C 
is full of variations and contradictions and that at

the present time no uniform agreement exists on how to 
determine vitamin C adequacy. It would appear that a 
few years ago tissue saturation was considered essential 
without adequate clinical reason and that the final 
solution of the problem demands further clinical work. 
However, most investigators agree that more than the 
minimum preventative dose should be taken daily.

II, SCOPE OF PROBLEM: 

The problem herewith presented, was undertaken 
with the view to determine whether the diets in Alberta 
supply an adequate amount of vitamin C. In order to do 
this, three aspects must be considered: the sources, 
the conveyance or preparation, and the subject or 
recipient. The investigation was therefore carried 
out in three ways, namely:- 

Part I. 

Analyses of vitamin C containing foods in the 
meals served at Athabasca Hall, a University 
of Alberta residence for men. The kitchens of 
this Hall supply food for the residents of 
Pembina Hall (women’s residence) as well, so 
cooking is done for approximately 400 students. 
Thus it was assumed that the meals served there 
would be fairly representative of better class 
or well-supervised, large-scale cooking through¬ 
out the province. 

Part II. 

Analyses of the vegetables obtained from the 
university gardens, to determine their vitamin 
C content, when raw and when cooked. In this 
way the sources were established, and also the 
loss of vitamin C during preparation for meals.

Part III. 

Urinalyses of vitamin C carried out on subjects 
residing in Athabasca Hall and on students living 
elsewhere. These were done in the spring and 
again in the fall of the same year and the 
excretion levels for each season compared and 
correlated with the intake values obtained in 
Part I. 

The findings herewith reported are of importance 
not only as the first of the kind in Western Canada, 
but also as a contribution to the general problem, 
previously discussed, of the human requirements for 
vitamin C.

III. METHODS OF TITRATION: 

A. Determination of vitamin C in food. 

The method used for the estimation of vitamin G 
in food is a modification of the 2,6,-dichlorophenol 
indophenol titration method (Harris and Ray, 1933). 

The extracting acid is a 2$ solution of metaphosphoric 
acid in 2N HC1. Trichloracetic acid as an extractant 
is unsatisfactory as it reacts with the dye (Musulin 
and King, 1936), as does also H 2 S0 4 (Bessey, 1938 3 : 

Pett, unpublished data). The metaphosphoric - HC1 
acid mixture however, does not have any appreciable 
effect on the dye; no decolorization takes place until 
three or more minutes have elapsed. Metaphosphoric 
acid inhibits the catalytic oxidation of vitamin 0 
by copper ions (Musulin and King, 1936). The greatest 
specificity of the dye and maximum inhibition of as¬ 
corbic acid oxidase (Mack and Tressler, 1937) is 
obtained at a pH of Z - 3. Such pH is produced by 
2N HG1. 

Harris and Ray at first ran the dye solution into 
the unknown, but in later experiments reversed the 
procedure to give a more distinct end-point. Pett (1936) 
however, runs the dye solution from a burette into a 
known quantity of the vitamin G extract; this would 
increase the accuracy because the dye solution is

immediately reduced by the ascorbic acid, as long as 
any is present, and thus the other more slowly reducing 
substances have no chance to cause decolonization. The 
end-point for the titration is a pink color that persists 
for 10 seconds. 

A weighed sample (SO gm.) of food is put into a 
beaker and immediately covered with acid solution to 
prevent oxidation of the vitamin G. Raw vegetables, 
are first sampled by quartering before weighing. The 
sample is then rapidly ground up in a mortar, with sand 
if necessary, to a fairly fine pulp. The grinding is 
not prolonged beyond the minimum necessary amount of 
time; all operations should be performed as rapidly as 
possible. The mixture is then poured into a graduated 
cylinder, the mortar and beaker are rinsed with acid 
solution and the washings added to the cylinder con¬ 
tents. The final volume is made up to 80 c.c. with 
acid mixture (any fixed volume can be used). Allow 
to stand a few minutes with occasional shaking, then 
filter through ordinary filter,paper into a beaker con¬ 
taining a small pinch of zinc dust. The zinc dust 
reacts with the HG1 acid and reduces any dehydroas- 
corbie acid to ascorbic. In the case of potatoes, and 
any creamed or very starchy vegetables, it is better 
to centrifuge off the clear extract, for filtering is

a far too lengthy procedure with them. 

After allowing the zinc to react for 3 - 5 minutes, 
or until the foam has subsided, pipette 5 c.c. portions 
into test-tubes and titrate against a 2 , 6 ,-dichloro- 
phenol indophenol dye solution, which has been standar¬ 
dized against a pure ascorbic acid solution. The above 
volumetric procedure is similar to that used by Pett 
(1936), with a few modifications. 

The McHenry and Graham (1935) modified method of 
titration of deeply colored extracts was used when 
necessary. The basis of this procedure lies in the 
fact that most plant pigments are insoluble in CHC1 3 
whereas the indophenol indicator is more soluble in 
CHC1 3 than in H 2 0, and may be completely removed from 
aqueous solution by this solvent. About 10 ml. of 
CHC1 3 are placed in a 50 c.c. centrifuge tube, 5 c.c. 
of titration mixture added, and indophenol dye solution 
is run in. The titration mixture is kept well stirred 
without disturbing the CHOI 3 layer. When there appears 
to be an excess of dye, mix the two layers well by means 
of a stream of N 2 gas (00 2 was used by McHenry and 
Graham) through a pipette, then centrifuge the CHC1 3 
off. If the CHC1 3 is practically colorless, insuf¬ 
ficient dye solution has been added, and the titration 
must be continued. The end-point is reached when just

sufficient indicator has been added to give the CHCX 3 
a definite red tinge. The red color is quite stable 
and does not fade quickly as in acidified aqueous 
solutions. McHenry and Graham got a 97 - 99 % 
recovery by this method. 

The pigments of strawberries and red peppers are 
somewhat soluble in CHC1 3 and for these the above 
method cannot be employed. However, these pigments 
can be removed sufficiently to permit titration by 
comparative means, by shaking the acid extract with 
butyl or amyl alcohol. The alcohol is subsequently 
washed with a small volume of water and the water 
added to the color extracted acid solution. 

(1) Preparation of the Indophenol Dye Solution 

250 c.c. of approximately 0.05 % 2,6 ,-dichloro- 
phenol indophenol solution is prepared by dissolving 
0.125 gm. of dye in 250 c.c. of M/500 phosphate buffer 
solution, the pH of which is 7.2. The phosphate 
buffer stabilizes the dye solution, so that its 
potency remains fairly constant from 2 to 3 weeks, if 
kept in a refrigerator at 5°C, while not in use.

(2) Standardization of the Dye Solution, 

The standardization was done against a solution of 
pure ascorbic acid (5 mg. in 10 c.c. distilled H 2 0). 

The strength of the dye solution is such that one c.c. 
is approximately equivalent to 0.200 mg. ascorbic acid. 

(3) Effect of Zn on the extract. 

Many investigators have used H £ S for reduction of 
dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbic acid (Emmerie and Yan 
Eekelen, 1934: Bessey, 1938 4 ). Mack and Tressler (1937) 
advocate the discontinuance of H 2 S reduction, for it 
is a very lengthy procedure, and quite possibly reduces 
substances other than vitamin C, making them react with 
the dye to produce higher titration results. Instead

of H 2 S we used Zn dust for the hack reduction of 
dehydroascorbic acid, for it reacts with the HC1 to 
produce a very effective reducing medium. This may 
too reduce substances other than det^droascorbie acid, 
as Mack and Tressler claim H 2 S does. The Zn dust is 
left in contact with the extract for 3-5 minutes.

After the initial increase, the titration 
values remain fairly constant until the end of 2 hours 
where there is an indication of decline. There is 
definite decline at the end of 20 hours, where a value 
below the original value is obtained. On addition of 
Zn, the titration value is again raised to 1.05 c.c. of 
dye. 

Thus we can conclude that 5-5 minutes is sufficient 
time for the zinc to react with the extract; or until 
the foam that is produced has subsided sufficiently 
to allow clearing of the extract. 

(4) Method of Extraction. 

Harris and Ray (1933), Bessey (1938 4 ), Musulin and 
King (1936) and others, extract their material with acid 
solutions, until the material is exhausted and make the 
extracted solution up to a known volume. Thornton (1938) 
uses the volumetric procedure, similar to Pett’s 
modification (1936) and the one used here. Thornton 
obtains higher values by this method than by the extrac¬ 
tion method unless six extractions are used, then the 
values from the two procedures become equal. For his 
extracting medium Thornton uses IN, 2N or 3N H 2 S0 4 
with HPQ 3 , we use 2N HC1 with HP0 3 . 

As Thornton points out, this method is time-saving, 


and thus gives less opportunity for oxidation of the

ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid to occur. In 
this way, in using a strong acid to prevent catalytic 
oxidation by enzymes, there is little or no reversible 
oxidation, so the use of the H g S procedure is eliminated. 

A comparison was made, as part of this investigation, 
between the extraction and volumetric procedures. Haw 
potato extract from several potatoes chopped and thor¬ 
oughly mixed to make all samples equal, was used. 

(a) Extraction method. 

Two samples of SO gm. of raw potato were thoroughly 
ground up with sand and metaphosphoric-HCl acids and the 
extract strained through cheese cloth into a measuring 
cylinder. The extraction was carried out with 3 more 
volumes of acid and the strained solution made up to 
80 c.c. Zinc was added. 

(b) Extraction method. 

The same procedure as in (a) was carried out, but 
the solid material was separated by centrifuging. Four 
extractions were also done. 

(c) Volumetric method. 

Two samples of SO gm. of raw potato were ground 
thoroughly with sand and acid solution and the total 
volume of solid and extracting medium was made up to 
80 c.c. The mixture was well shaken, centrifuged, and 
the supernatant liquid poured into a beaker containing

Method (a) was not consistent, due probably to the 
procedure of straining which was difficult to handle 
without loss and is not suitable. Method (b) and (c) 
were consistent in the two different samples, but the 
volumetric procedure shows higher values. Very consis¬ 
tent results can be obtained by the volumetric procedure 
on different samples from the same material. Volumetric 
results (Thornton, 1938) are always higher than those 
obtained by the extraction method. 

The volumetric procedure was further tested for 
reliability. Firstly, values obtained from different 
percentage mixtures were compared.

These values are constant within experimental error; 
the ratio used most by us was 1:4. 


Secondly, values obtained from mixtures left ex¬ 
tracting and mixtures titrated immediately were com¬ 
pared. 

(a) Two samples of 20 gm. of raw potato were thoroughly 
ground immediately with sand, the mixture was made up 

to 80 c.c. volume with acid, well mixed and allowed to 
stand 5 minutes with occasional shaking. It was then 
centrifuged and the clear supernatant liquid was treated 
with Zn dust for 3-5 minutes. 

(b) The above was repeated, but instead of grinding 
immediately, the diced potato was left in contact with

the acid solution for 1 hour, which softens the tissue 
and makes grinding much easier. 

(c) (a) was repeated, but the ground up potato pulp 
was left 1 hour extracting in the cylinder with acid. 

(d) Same as (a), but instead of thorough grinding with 
sand, the potatoes were merely crushed with the pestle.

If the potato is left 

extracting with 

acid after 


grinding as in (c), there is a slight loss in the 


vitamin content, very likely due to oxidation. The 
loss is more than in (b) for in (c), the potato is 
finely ground and thus the vitamin C is more exposed 
to contact with oxygen and the resultant oxidation.

Method (d) although quicker does not give as high a 
vitamin C content, for the extraction is not thorough 
enough. Method (b) does not give as consistent results 
as (a), which is the method advocated. 

Thirdly, the argument may be put forward, that in 
the volumetric procedure, the titration value is higher 
due to the solid portion of the potato occupying some 
of the total volume, and thus the actual volume of 
extraction liquid is less than 80 c.c. Percentage 
moisture of the potatoes used is on the average 75$, 
so 5 gm. of the 20 gm. sample is solid material, and 
will occupy even less than 5 c.c. of the extraction 
mixture. Also the interstices of the potato are per¬ 
meated with liquid, so that the apparent volume is still 
smaller. To show this, different amounts of sand were 
added directly to the cylinder (up to the 5 c.c. mark 
in two cylinders and to the 10 c.c. mark in another 
two). The mixture of potato and acid was then added 
and the final volume made up to 80 c.c.

Although sand was added in considerable quantities, 
the values are consistent within experimental error. 

It is known that the added sand occupies some of the 
80 c.c., yet any increase in titration occasioned by 
its presence, is not manifested appreciably in the 
final result. It is then reasonable to assume that 5 
gm. of solid material present in the potato sample, 
would also make no appreciable difference in the titration 
value. The error introduced by it would still be less 
than that introduced by the length of the extraction 
procedure. 

These results are' essentially the same as those 
obtained by Thornton (1938). We concluded that the 


method was reliable

III. B. Determination of vitamin C in urine. 

The method used for estimation of vitamin C in 
urine is a modification of Abbasy, Harris et al method 
(1935). Five c.c. of urine are diluted with 10 c.c. 
of the acid solution used in the plant extractions 
(2% HP0 3 in 2N HC1) and is then titrated. The dye 
solution is a 1:10 dilution of the dye used for the 
plant titrations, making 1 c.c. of it approximately 
equivalent to 0.020 mg. of vitamin 0. It is standar¬ 
dized against a pure ascorbic acid solution of known 
strength. This dilution of the 2,6,-dichlorophenol- 
indophenol dye solution decreases its duration of 
stability to two days. The dye solution is run from a 
10 c.c. burette into the urine samples and the end 
point is a definite pink color that persists for 10 
seconds. 

(1) This method was tested for reliability by deter¬ 
mination of the percentage recovery of added vitamin 

0 .

(2) It was found that to titrate urine into dye gave 
very inconsistent and low percentage recoveries. The 
two methods were first shown to work equally well with 
pure ascorbic acid solution, then were compared by means 
of percentage recoveries of added ascorbic acid, from 
urine.

The error in method II. is probably due to other 
reducing substances in the urine. When the first portion 
of the urine is added to the excess dye, the ascorbic 
acid in it is very rapidly oxidized and the other 
reducing substances are left free to react with the 
excess dye. If the titration should require over two 
minutes, as is often the case when only small quantities 
of vitamin C are present, then there will be an

appreciable reduction of the dye by the more slowly 
reducing compounds. This will tend to give excessive 
titration values. 

In method I, as soon as a small portion of the 
dye comes into contact with the acidified urine, it is 
immediately reduced by the ascorbic acid, which is by 
far the best competitor for the dye. A reduction of 
the dye, by the other substances, will not occur then 
until all the ascorbic acid is used* Method II was 
discarded, for it is too inaccurate*

IV. EXPERIMENTAL AND RESULTS. 

Part I Investigation of meals served at Athabasca Hall. 

The purpose of this experiment was to determine 
the average daily amount of vitamin 0 obtained from 
the meals at Athabasca Hall. The kitchens in Athabasca 
Hall are modern, and steam is used for cooking all 
vegetables where possible. Fruits are stewed. Most 
of the vegetables used in the summer were obtained fresh 
from the university gardens; in the winter they were 
stored vegetables as potatoes, carrots, turnips, cabbage, 
etc., and canned vegetables as peas and beans. The 
oranges, apples, grapefruit and bananas were fresh or 
stored depending on the season when obtained. In the 
winter, any fruits other than the above mentioned were 
canned (peaches, pears, plums, pineapple) while In the 
summer other fresh fruits as peaches, plums, raspberries 
and strawberries were obtainable. 

To determine the vitamin 0 intake per day, the 
vitamin 0 containing foods were analysed. These foods 
included any fresh fruit served at breakfast, and the 
vegetables and fruits served at dinner and at supper. 

No meats were analysed as the amount of vitamin 0 
contained in meat after cooking Is considered to be 
negligible as a source of the vitamin. (Sherman and 
Smith, 1931). Soups and milk were omitted, (5 mg.

The analysis was carried out during the first 
complete week of each month (from Monday to Saturday). 
Actual analysis of the food served on Sunday was not 
performed, but the amount received was estimated from the 
values obtained on the preceding six days, for example:

The value used for "the other sources" for Sunday was 
the average of such values for the previous six days; 
the fruit chosen depended on what they had received on 
the other days, for throughout the winter, in one week, 
oranges were served on two days, apples on three days, 
grapefruit on one day and no fruit on the seventh.day. 
In the summer we usually inquired from the cook as to 
what fruit was being served on Sunday, as the above 
schedule was not adhered to so rigorously. During the

apple season (October and November) more apples were 
served than any other fruit. In the summer months of 
July, August and September, apples were omitted, oranges 
being the main fruit, occasionally substituted by cherries, 
peaches or grapes. The weekly average value of the fruit 
chosen for Sunday was then used. 

The analyses were based on 100 gm. average servings 
for vegetables and stewed fruits, on 1 fruit for oranges, 
apples and peaches, and on l/2 a grapefruit. This is 
purely arbitrary, but fairly representative of all 
servings. 

When the analyses for the week were complete, the 
total seven day value was calculated and from this the 
average daily value, which was taken to represent the 
average intake per day for all of the month.

Table X* 



AVERAGE DAILY INTAKE OF VITAMIN 

ATHABASCA HALL DIETARY 















































-30- 


Discussion of Table X. 

For 12 months the diet of Athabasca Hall residents 
was investigated in order to establish the average daily 
amount of vitamin C provided. The bar graph (Table X) 
shows clearly the variation per month in intake, and the 
effect of removal of citrus fruits (grapefruit and 
oranges) from the diet. If 40 mg. (800 I.U.) (Kellie 
and Zilva, 1939) is taken to represent the daily re¬ 
quirement, only one month, April, is below that amount. 
If the citrus fruits were to be omitted, only 5 months 
would supply the required 40 mg., these being the five 
summer months from June - October inclusive. 

The Canadian Dietary Standard for vitamin C is 
60 mg. per day, (1200 I.U. ). Even with oranges and 
grapefruit, the daily supply of vitamin C is below this 
standard for the seven months from November - May, 
(inclusive), and without them, only 3 months, June, 
August and October are adequate. We must conclude then, 
that citrus fruits are essential for a well-balanced 
diet especially during the winter months. In the summer 
months, the 40 mg. requirement could be maintained 
without them, but 40 mg. is probably bordering a minimum 
adequate intake, while 60 mg. gives more of a safety 
margin. To maintain the Canadian Dietary Standard, 
the diet should be supplemented with vitamin C during

the winter, since the average daily intake for the 
months from November to May (inclusive) is only 41 mg. 
From June to October inclusive, the average is 82 mg. 
just double the amount received in the other months. 

The intake of vitamin C in June is high, because 
of the abundant supply of fresh strawberries. July’s 
value is 21 mg. lower, but still adequate because of 
the fresh tomatoes and other fresh vegetables then coming 
into use. August supplies the highest quota, due to 
the increased content of potatoes, cabbage, cauliflower 
and tomatoes, all of which are then about at the peak 
of their vitamin C content. The intake in September 
and October drops slightly and November shows a definite 
decline, due mainly to the loss of ascorbic acid in 
vegetables on storing and the omission of fresh or 
canned tomatoes. In April the lowest values for potatoes 
and oranges were recorded, and no tomatoes were eaten 
during the week tested, all of which accounts partly 
for the daily intake being the least in April.

*Grapefruit, Oranges, Apples and Peaches have their vitamin C content 
expressed in mg. per fruit. 

/ These values are expressed in mg. per 100 c.c. of juice. The 
average number of c.c. of juice in a grapefruit is 160 c.c., in an 
orange it is 75 c.c. 

The average weight of peaches tested was 110 gm. 

The average weight of apples tested was 150 gm.

Discussion of Table XI. 

Table XI gives an indication of the sources of 
vitamin C in the diet throughout the 13 months inves¬ 
tigated. These values are compared with those listed 
by Bessey (1938 3 ) in his review, and with those compiled 
by Pett and Cantor (1939). Strawberries are the best 
sources, but were available only during the month of 
June, thus they cannot be used the year round. Oranges 
and grapefruit are both excellent means of obtaining 
vitamin C in both winter and summer, and as shown in 
Table X should certainly be included in the winter 
diets. Raw tomatoes are available in the summer, and can 
be substituted by canned tomatoes in the winter. However 
they become tiresome if used daily as oranges and grape¬ 
fruit are. Por second vegetables cauliflower, cabbage, 
turnips and parsnips form fairly good sources used in 
conjunction with potatoes which are universally con¬ 
sumed in the daily diet. Those vegetables and fruits 
supplying 5 mg. or less per 100 gm. cannot be considered 
as important sources of the vitamin.

Discussion of Table XII. 

The monthly variation of some of the fruits and 
vegetables analysed is indicated by Table XII. Potatoes 
chiefly show a seasonal effect. The new potatoes, used 
in August, give a high value and reach their peak in 
September, just before the first frost, after which the 
vitamin C value drops, (this will be shown later). 

From October on, decline in value is due to loss during 
storage. The vitamin C content is at a minimum in April, 
then increases slightly in May, June and July. The 
reason for this increase is obscure, but it may have 
been that a new variety of potato was used. Also, it 
is a somewhat common procedure in large-scale kitchens, 
to peel the potatoes some time in advance of cooking, 
and to leave them soaking in cold water. This would 
tend to bring about considerable vitamin C loss. But 
at the end of April the students leave residence, and 
the amount of food prepared is reduced enormously. 
Therefore, it would be possible to peel the potatoes 
just before cooking and thus preserve much of the vitamin 
content. 

Raw tomatoes show a definite peak in August. Any 
differences shown in canned tomato values cannot be 
considered significant, in view of the few samples 
analysed.

Carrots have a high value in August, then a gradual 
decrease on storage. 

Any changes manifested in oranges, grapefruit and 
bananas, cannot be explained on a seasonal basis, for 
these fruits are all picked in the unripe stage. The 
differences would be due to storage, transportation 
and other similar factors which were not investigated. 

The values for apples are consistently low.

Part II. 

Investigation of the Loss of Vitamin C during Cooking 

Part II forms the investigation of the natural 
sources and preparation of the vitamin C containing foods. 
The following tables were compiled from results of 
analyses on vegetables and fruits grown in the University 
of Alberta gardens. All the vegetables were tested as 
soon as possible after harvesting, usually on the same 
day. If any had to be left over until the following 
day, they were put in the ice box at 5°C until ready 
for use. The large vegetables as potatoes, turnips, 
carrots, etc. were cut into two equal parts, one of which 
was tested in the raw condition for vitamin 0, the 
other was first cooked, then tested. The vegetables 
were boiled in water until done, overcooking being 
avoided. 

The method of titration was the same as that used 
in Part I.

Discussion of Table XIII. 

The importance of this part of the investigation 
lies in helping to select the best varieties of vege¬ 
tables to be grown and in showing the probable losses 
of vitamin C in cooking in the home, as distinguished 
from the institutional losses found in Part I. The 
loss of vitamin C during cooking varied greatly; it 
was considerable in some, small in others and the odd 
vegetable showed an apparent increase. The percentage 
loss was less in fruits, due to their acidity (Bessey, 
1938 3 ). Leafy vegetables as kale, broccoli and beet 
tops had a high percentage loss. Celery and onions 
ranked very high in percentage loss of vitamin C, the 
reason for this is not apparent. 

It is noted that: 

42% of the vegetables and fruits tested lost less 

than 40% of their vitamin C. 

These are: Asparagus - tips 

" - stalks 

Beans - yellow waz 

" - green string 

Cabbage, cherries, corn, Adam crabapples 
currants (red and black), vegetable 
marrow, mammoth plums, potatoes, rasp¬ 
berries, scallop squash and strawberries

21% lost between 40% - 60% of their vitamin C content. 
Beet tops (3 varieties), beet roots (Detroit Dark Red), 
brussels sprouts, carrots (2 varieties), turnips 
(white). 

19% lost over 60%' of their vitamin C content. 

These were: broccoli, celery (white and pink), 
kale, onion and rhubarb, turnips (White Milan). 

18% showed apparent gain. 

These were: beet roots (Crosby’s Egyptian and Lutz’s 
Greenleaf), cherry-plums (2 varieties), crabapples 
(Piotosh), plums (Selected Seedling) and peas. 

The vitamin G content of the raw vegetables varies 
greatly with the different types. Even in one variety 
there is considerable difference between the individual 
samples, and thus one cannot state that any one variety 
of vegetable or fruit contains a definite amount. It 
is better to quote the range and average figure. Parseley 
was found to have the highest vitamin C content of the 
raw vegetables, rhubarb, the lowest. For the cooked 
vegetables and fruits, strawberries take the lead, with 
black currants a close second. Broccoli, kale, brussels 
sprouts, and asparagus tips are good sources of the 
vitamin; potatoes are also an excellent source in view 
of the fact that they are so universally consumed in the 
daily diet during winter and summer.

The values obtained on the raw foods are ranged 
similarly to those obtained by Olliver (1936, 1940) 
on vegetables and fruits grown in England, but she gets 
consistently higher estimations. They compare more 
favorably to those given by Bessey in his review of 
methods of assay and dietary sources of vitamin C (1938 3 ). 
It is also noted that the vitamin C content of asparagus 
tips is double that of the stalks, a result similar to 
that obtained by Olliver. 

Several different varieties of onions (see appendix 
I) were estimated for vitamin C content, and the increase 
of the vitamin in the green shoots over that in the bulb 
was noted. On the average, the green shoots contain 
a little more than double the amount contained by the 
bulbs. 

Wheeler et al (1939) note that the outer leaves of 
lettuce are slightly higher than the inner. This is 
comparable to our results. 

There has been much controversy about the cause of 
the apparent increase of vitamin C on heating some 
vegetables. Four different suggestions have been put 
forward as explanation for it. 

Reedman and McHenry (1938) claim that the vitamin is 
present as a protein conjugate, which is broken down on 
heating to give free ascorbic acid. This conjugate

-42- 


(called "ascorbigen" by Pal and Guha, 1939) is not 
readily extracted by acid solutions, and is therefore 
not estimated by indophenol titrations of acid extracts. 
When released from the protein, the freed ascorbic acid 
can be easily determined. Olliver (1936) suggests that 
there may be incomplete extraction from the raw vegetables 
especially woody ones, which are difficult to grind. On 
cooking the tissues are softened, and the extraction of 
vitamin 0 is more complete, with resultant higher es¬ 
timates. Van Eekelen (1935) believes the increase after 
cooking is due to the destruction of the ascorbic acid 
oxidase by heat. The last suggestion made by Mack and 
Tressler (1937) is that the increase is due to the 
decomposition of dehydroascorbic acid to physiologically 
inactive but strongly reducing products. The question 
is still far from being settled. 

The vitamin C content of the various vegetables 
and fruits were calculated out on a dry weight basis at 
the same time. This table appears in Appendix II. The 
resultant values are ranged similarly to the wet weight 
ones, but are much higher. The table is of little 
practical importance, for nutritionally, vitamin C 
content is based on food as we eat it, and dry weight 
figures are very hard to visualize in terms of our 
normal consumption. It is however included for reference

purposes. 

It was noted during titration of acid extracts from 
turnips and brussels sprouts, that on addition of dye to 
the titration sample, a pale green color, that darkened 
to a dirty blue on further addition of dye, appeared. 

This color made it very difficult to detect the pink 
end point produced by excess dye in acid solution; and 
would tend to make higher titration results. It seemed 
obvious that some substance was being extracted which 
reacted with the dye to produce these color changes. 

The acid extract from cooked turnips reacted very slightly 
in this manner, but the cooking juice reacted strongly, 
indicating extraction by the cooking water of this 
unknown substance. Cooked and raw brussels sprouts, 
and both varieties of raw turnips gave the reaction. 

No reference to this has been noted in the literature, 
and no explanation can be offered without further 
experimentation. If it is a substance other than 
vitamin C, reacting with the dye, the titrations are 
evidently erroneous and further investigation into the 
matter is desirable. 

Table XIV is a comparison of percentage losses; 
by heat or oxidation and by solution in the cooking 
medium, during food preparation. Those vegetables 
showing a loss are in table XIV, and those showing an 
apparent gain are listed in table XV.

Discussion of Tables XIV and XV* 

In Table XIV, the first 3 foods show about an even 
loss of vitamin C through oxidation and by solution in 
the cooking water. Beet tops, celery, carrots, Adam 
crabapples and corn show a much higher percentage loss 
due to oxidation. The last four varieties show more 
loss through the extraction of vitamin C by the cooking 
water, though the first sample under broccoli is an 
exception to this. Olliver (1940) claims that the 
greater loss of vitamin 0 occurs through solution in 
the juice, depending on the length of cooking and amount 
of cooking water. These figures indicate that consider¬ 
able loss can occur through the procedure of discarding 
the juice of vegetables (this is not done with fruits), 
but whether that or oxidation forms the larger cause of 
destruction seems to be a questionable point. It would 
indeed be more economical to use the water in which 
the vegetables are cooked. 

In Table XV the first 8 vegetables and fruits 
listed, show increase in content only when the values 
for the pulp plus the juice, are taken together. The 
last four show an increase in the cooked vegetable or 
fruit over the raw without including the vitamin C 
contained in the juice. In the fruits, the juice is 
used, so no loss is entailed. In turnips and cabbage

a very large proportion of the vitamin C is contained 
in the cooking water. The only vegetable in the last 
four is peas, which also shows a considerable amount 
of vitamin C in the cooking juice. As noted before, 
these increases may be due to destruction of the oxidase 
or the breaking up of an ascorbic acid - protein conjugate. 
These factors may also be active during the cooking of 
the vegetables listed in Table XIV. If this be so, 
oxidation must be playing a still larger part in the 
destruction of vitamin C than is indicated by the 
figures. 



-48- 


An investigation of the seasonal changes of raw 
potatoes (Netted Gem) was carried on during 1940 - 41. 

The figures obtained are included in Table XVT. Analyses 
were carried out on 3 or 4 tubers on Tuesday and Friday 
of each week. In compiling the table, all analyses for 
the one week are averaged, i.e. for about 6-8 samples. 
After September 30, the potatoes were stored in a root 
cellar a few degrees above freezing.

Discussion of Table XVI. 

It is noted that the vitamin C content of potatoes 
increases until the first frost occurs, then begins 
to decline quite regularly. At the end of February, 
the value is about one-third of the highest value. As 
in cooked potatoes, (Table XII), the peak is reached 
in September. The drop is more rapid at first, with a 
loss of 17.6 mg. from Sept. 10 to Nov. 1, (1 l/2 months), 
and only a further 9 mg. from Nov. 1 to Feb. 4, (3 
months). 

The vitamin G content as calculated on dry weight 
is given in the table. The values are much higher, 
but follow the same general trend as the wet weight 


values

The Athabasca Hall values are the averages for the

general the tendency is for the vitamin C content of 
the institutionally cooked foods to be less than the 
content of the home cooked foods. Rhubarb and celery 
are exceptions. To draw any definite conclusions, fur¬ 
ther investigation would be necessary.

Part III. 

Investigation of Urinary Excretion of Vitamin C 

Estimations of the vitamin C in urine were carried 
out on several subjects for the purpose of correlating 
the excretion of vitamin C with the dietary intake, 
figures for which were obtained in Part I. Therefore 
the subjects chosen were residents of Athabasca Hall. 

The normal excretion of vitamin 0 was determined on 
one day, and on the next day, the excretion was again 
estimated after a 200 mg. test dose of pure ascorbic 
acid* had been administered. This was done in the 
latter part of January 1940 and again in the latter 
part of September 1940. 

Urine was collected from 8.30 A.M*. on one day to 
8.30 A.M. the next day. After the last voiding, a 
200 mg. capsule of ascorbic acid was taken and the urine 
collected again until 8.30 A.M. the following day. 

The 24 hour specimens were preserved with a mixture 
of 5 c.c. of 20 % metaphosphoric acid and 15 c.c. of 
concentrated HC1. The titrations were done on the day 
of the final collection for the 24 hour period. 

During the summer the subjects were not all in 
continuous residence at Athabasca Hall.

A somewhat similar experiment was carried out on 
several students, but a different group was used each 
time. They included both male and female students, who 
resided at Athabasca Hall and elsewhere. The figures 
obtained are listed in Table XX.

Discussion of Tables XVIII, XIX and XX. 

The results obtained by different workers on the 
excretion of vitamin C as related to dietary intake and 
saturation of the tissues, are many and varied (Smith, 
1938). Abbasy et al (1935) say that an excretion of 
10 - 15 mg. vitamin C per 24 hours indicates a border¬ 
line intake, 20 mg. per 24 hours indicates normal or 
moderate intake, while Van Eekelen et al (1937) say 
40 mg. excretion per day indicates a liberal intake 
and saturation of the tissues. 

Johnson and Zilva (1934) found that the excretion 
of vitamin C in the winter was almost nil, never above 
10 - 15 mg. per day; but rose after the summer. In 
January, we obtained an average of 17 mg. per day 
(Table XVIII), which is higher than Johnson and Zilva r s 
results, and in Table XIX, though the average is 14.3 mg. 
only one excretion falls below 10 mg. and the majority 
of them exceed 15 mg. In Table XX however, the average 
excretion of students tested in March is 7.4 mg. and 
only one excretion exceeds 15 mg., which seems to agree 
with Johnson and Zilva’s results. This drop in value 
from January to March may be accounted for in part by 
individual variation, but would be more likely due to 
decreased intake, or gradual depletion of tissue content 
while subsisting on a barely adequate diet, (see Table X)

Even after a 200 mg. test dose, group II showed an 
average excretion of only 23.7 mg./day, 73.9$ of the 
cases "being below this average figure. 

Kellie and Zilva (1939) state that 30 - 50 mg. 
of ascorbic acid a day is sufficient to produce tissue 
saturation. The figures obtained here do not support 
this statement since those residing at Athabasca Hall 
received at least 41 mg./day during the winter, but 
according to their saturation tests by urinalysis, 
they are in the borderline group. Todhunter and Robbins 
(1940) give a minimum intake for saturation as 1.6 - 1.7 
mg./Kilogram body weight, or for a 60 Kg. person this 
would be 96 - 102 mg. per day, which seems to be a more 
accurate estimate. 

The state of saturation of the tissues is indicated 
more clearly by excretion after a test dose. Baumann 
(1937) estimates that 60 - 80 % of the test dose will 
be excreted in 24 hours by a healthy saturated person. 

In January (Tables XVTII and XIX), these percentages 
are not nearly approximated. However, September presents 
a better picture, with the average normal excretion 
double that in January, the test dose excretion four 
times as great and the percentage excretion greatly 
increased. Still L.T. and E.H.B. are the only two 
subjects that come within the range of Baumann’s 



' 



c

' . ; t

. . . ■ . . 










-58- 


percentage excretion, considering the fact that Baumann’s 
values are based on total excretion figures, not on the 
difference between the level of excretion before and 
after a test dose. 

In December (Table XX), the average excretion of 
G-roup III is 19.1 mg., three times the excretion of 
Group I in March. This is indicative of increased body 
stores, as are the higher excretions obtained in Septem¬ 
ber. 

As can be seen from the tables, the total excretion 
and percentage excretion vary greatly with different 
individuals. For example in Table XVIII in September : 

E.O.L, excretes before the test dose 23.2 mg. 
vitamin C, and after the test dose 65.9, yet L.B.P. 
excretes 27.4 mg. before (4.2 mg. more than E.O.L.), 
and only 23.3 after the test dose. The 200 mg. ingested 
by L.B.P. has then been absorbed, and taken up by the 
tissues or destroyed in the intestines. This could be 
shown by blood analyses. A.C.W. and J.L. listed in 
Table XIX also show this wide variation. It seems 
evident then, that different individuals have different 
capacities for saturation, and one fixed value for 
normal excretion cannot be applied to all individuals. 

To determine if a person is saturated or not with 
vitamin C, the test dose method is better to use than 
just an estimation of the normal level of excretion.

V. SUMMARY 

(1) A method of estimating vitamin 0 was modified from 
those used by Pett (1936) and Harris and Ray (1933) 

and the procedure was investigated to determine its 
reliability. It was found to be quite satisfactory. 

(2) The intake of vitamin C per day available in the 
meals at Athabasca Hall was determined. It was found 
to be 41 mg. per day for the months from November to 
May inclusive, and 82 mg. per day from June to October 
inclusive. 

(3) The range and average content of vitamin C contained 
in the foods served at Athabasca Hall, were established 
over the period of 13 months. 

(4) The seasonal variation of some of the fruits and 
vegetables analysed in (3) were compared. These were: 
oranges, grapefruit, apples, bananas, potatoes cooked, 
carrots cooked and tomatoes raw and canned. Monthly 
differences noted in values for oranges, grapefruit 
and bananas cannot be attributed to seasonal variation, 
since these fruits are picked while still green. The 
variation would be due to other factors not investigated. 

Potatoes reached their peak in vitamin C content 
in September, the lowest value in April. Raw tomatoes 
were at a peak in August, differences in canned tomatoes 
are not significant due to the few samples analysed.

Apples (McIntosh and Delicious) gave consistently 
low values; any differences are not significant. 

(5) Raw vegetables and fruits grown in the University 
of Alberta gardens, were analysed in order to establish 
some of the naturally occurring sources of vitamin C. 

Great variation was found, but the following list gives 
the sources in order of decreasing vitamin C content: 

Parseley, broccoli, black currants, brussels sprouts, 
kale and strawberries (over 60 mg. vitamin C per 100 gm.). 

Asparagus tips, beet tops, green string beans, 
chives, cress, cabbage, yellow wax beans, red currants, 
potatoes, raspberries and asparagus stalks (between 
20 - 60 mg. %). 

Turnips, scallop squash, onion, beets, carrots, 
radishes, tomatoes, peas, lettuce, cherries, celery, 
cherry-plums, marrow, crabapples, corn, plums and 
rhubarb (below 20%). 

(6) The losses of vitamin C incurred during cooking 
of the vegetables and fruits analysed in (5) were 
investigated. 42% of them lost less than 40% of their 
vitamin 0 content, 21% lost between 40% - 60%, 19% 

of them lost more than 60%, and 18% showed an apparent 
gain. 

The percentage loss due to extraction by the cooking 
water and that due to oxidation were compared. Some

vegetables lose by both methods, (asparagus, string beans, 
beet tops, carrots, celery and corn), others mostly in 
the water, (broccoli, brussels sprouts, potatoes, 
vegetable marrow, wax beans, cabbage, scallop, turnips 
and peas). 

(7) The seasonal variation in vitamin C content of raw 
potatoes was determined for the months of August, 1940, 
to February, 1941. It was found that values increase 
until blossoming is complete and the first frost has 
occurred. There is then a rapid loss amounting to 51$ 
in the first month and a half, and a further loss of 
30$ by the end of five and a half months. 

(8) Analyses of vitamin C in urine were carried out 
on residents of Athabasca Hall, in order to correlate 
their excretion of vitamin C with the intake established 
in (2). Great individual variation was found in the 
amount excreted before and after test doses (saturation 
test). The excretion in the fall, after the summer 
diet, was double that obtained in the spring, after 
diets low in vitamin C content.

VI. CONCLUSIONS 

From the experiments performed on the methods of 
analysis, we concluded that the volumetric procedure 
was quite reliable, and gave consistently higher results 
than obtained by the procedure of extracting the material 
until exhausted. Use of zinc is a far quicker and simpler 
means of reducing dehydroascorbic acid back to ascorbic 
acid, and it is advocated in place of H 2 S reduction, 
with the reservation that other substances may be reduced 
as well. 

After investigation of the daily intake of vitamin 
C by residents in Athabasca Hall, it was concluded that 
during seven months these residents are receiving a 
possible adequate supply of vitamin C, as judged by 
their intake and also by the excretion values. This is 
probably representative of the student body as a whole, 
and very likely could apply to most people being fed on 
a large scale basis in Western Canada. To fulfil the 
Canadian Dietary Standard for vitamin C requirement, 

(60 mg.), the diet would have to be supplemented. 

Another orange a day would raise the intake to this 
standard, or sufficient grapefruit juice or orange juice 
could be supplied. 

The importance of maintaining an adequate impor¬ 
tation of citrus fruits from other countries is shown 




. 

• 'i • • < 

'

by these findings, which are in all probability fairly 
typical of the country. If citrus fruits should become 
inaccessible to the general public, the requirement of 
vitamin C would have to be maintained by use of syn¬ 
thetic ascorbic acid. However, there is evidence that 
there is associated with vitamin C another factor, vitamin 
P, present in oranges (Scarborough, 1939). Vitamin P 
will decrease capillary fragility and clear up sub¬ 
cutaneous haemorrhages in certain cases where pure 
synthetic ascorbic acid is not effective. Thus, in view 
of these observations made by Scarborough, the better 
source for additional vitamin C would be the citrus 
fruits, either fresh or canned. 

From the results obtained on urinalyses of vitamin 
G and assuming saturation is needed, it can be concluded 
that deficiency is definitely shown at the end of the 
winter, but this is made up during the summer when the 
intake is very high. It is difficult to say how much, 
if any, the diet should be supplemented, for it is still 
questionable whether tissue saturation of vitamin C is 
necessary for optimum health. In fact there are inr- 
dications that it is not (Kellie and Zilva, 1939), 
(Bietschel and Mensching, 1939), During the winter, 
however, we would suggest an increased intake of the 
vitamin, to give a safe margin over the minimum require¬ 
ment to prevent scurvy.
