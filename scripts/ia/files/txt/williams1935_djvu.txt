Introduction 


In order to understand what is meant by the term 
field strength and how it is measured, it Is first 
necessary to have a clear idea of the process by which 
speech and music are conveyed from the transmitting 
aerial to the receiving aerial. 

The energy radiated from a transmitting antenna^ 
exists in the form of electric and magnetic fields, 
propagated outwards from the antenna with a velocity 
equal to that of light. These two fields are in phase 
with each other, have equal magnitudes or strengths when 
expressed in absolute units, and are at right angles to 
each other and to their direction of propagation. The 
direction of the electric component is usually vertical 
and that of the magnetic component therefore horizontal 
for waves of broad cast or lower frequency, and such a 
wav© is said to be vertically polarized. In passing it 
may be mentioned that short waves often exhibit remarkable 
rotation of their plane of polarization, especially after 
reflection from the Heaviside layer or after passing through 
some object such as a building. 

The effect of these waves, or radiation fields, on 
the receiving antenna may be considered as being due to 
either the electric field or the magnetic field, but not 

2 

due to both, since they are two aspects of the same thing •

Thus th© voltage induced in the antenna may be ascribed 
to the separation of charges in the conductor by the 
electric field, or to the cutting action of the conductor 
on the magnetic field travelling past with the velocity 
of light. 

Near to th© transmitting antenna there exists also 
another set of fields, th© induction electrostatic and 
magnetic fields, which are responsible for th© capacity 
and inductance of the antenna system respectively. 

The radiation fields, electric and magnetic, are in 

phase with each other but are in phase quadrature with th© 

antenna current, and their intensity varies inversely as 

th© first power of the distance from the antenna. Insofar 

as th© induction fields ©re concerned, the magnetic field 

is in phase with the antenna current but the electric 

field is in phase with the radiation fields, and therefor© 

o 

lags the antenna current by 90 . The strength of these 
induction fields varies inversely as the square of the 
distance from the antenna, and so they die out much more 
rapidly than the radiation fields do. At a distance of 
-A- ( X * wav© length) from the transmitter the strengths 
of the induction and radiation fields are equal, closer 
in, the induction fields predominate, further away,- the 
radiation fields are the stronger. 

Thus it is evident that measurements of the strength 
of the radiated fields should begin at distances of several 
wavelengths from the transmitter. It should be noted also 
that the value as measured is the effective value of the 
field strength, and is equal to ~ x the maximum value #

Field strengths are measured in volts, millivolts or 
microvolts per meter. This voltage may be considered as 
that which would be generated by the radiation magnetic 
field sweeping across a conductor one meter long, the 
conductor being placed in the plane of polarization of the 
wave and parallel to the wave front* , 

The measurement is made by picking up the transmitted 
signal with a suitable aerial, usually a loop, and then 
measuring the voltage developed in the aerial by the signal. 

The measurement of this voltage may be made directly with 
a calibrated vacuum tube voltmeter or indirectly by comparing 
it by means of an uncalibrated vacuum tub© voltmeter with 
a locally produced and accurately known voltage of the same 
frequency. It is the latter system that is used in this 
investigation* 

The relation between the strength of the signal and 
the voltage developed in the antenna is given by the equation, 

E « eh 

where E s voltage developed in the antenna in volts, 
e s field strength in volts/meter, 
h s effective height of the antenna in meters* 

The effective height of an antenna is a function of its 
physical dimensions and can be easily calculated from them* 

The modification of the above equation that is necessary 
when the antenna is tuned to the transmitter frequency will 
be considered later.

Propagation and Attenuation of Radio Waves . 

The radiation from © transmitter 


may be considered as being made up of 
two components, the sky wave and the 
ground wave. The ground wave follows 



the surface of the earth as it travels 

outwards from the transmitter and is vertically polarized 
since the electrostatic flux of a horizontally polarized 
wave would be short circuited by the semi-conducting earth* 
The ground wave is attenuated as it passes over the earth’s 
surface, the amount of attenuation depending on the-charac¬ 
ter of the surface and the frequency of the transmitter, but 
remaining practically constant as between night and day or 
from season to season. 

The sky wav© travels upwards from the surface of the 
earth and is reflected down by the Heaviside layer. The 
field strength of the wav© at a point so distant from the 
transmitter that only the sky wave reaches it is extremely 
variable and depends on many factors. 

The reception in the intermediate region where both 
sky and ground waves have appreciable magnitudes may be 
very poor at times due to interference phenomena. 

In this investigation only the ground wave will be 
considered.

obtaining values of field strength at various distances 
from the transmitter is, (ground wave only), 

E - — 8 y h J~ - millivolts/meter. 

where h * effective height of transmitting antenna in 
meters, 

I s antenna current in amperes, 

X s wavelength in meters, 
r s distance in kilometers. 

This equation is also written occasionally in the form, 

E _ l 77 jlH: - volts/meter. 

where h * effective height of antenna in cms., 
f s frequency in cyeles/second, 

I s antenna current in amperes, 
c s velocity of light in cms/second, 
d a distance from antenna in cms.. 

The effect of attenuation is introduced into the 
above equations by multiplying by an attenuation factor, 
and there have been many attempts made to find a formula 
to fit all conditions that may be encountered. The Austin- 
Cohen formula published in 1911 was derived from transmission 
measurements made over sea water, but was therefore not 
valid for overland transmission, Sommerfeld*s analysis 
for the latter case was published in 1909, but was too 
complicated for practical use. Recently, Rolf^has prepared 
graphs to simplify the application of Sommerf©Id*s theory. 
This theory dealt with transmission over a semi-conducting 
plane and therefore at large distances had to be corrected

for the diffraction effect caused by the curvature of the 
earth. 

Watson 1 has derived a formula for transmission over 
a semi-conducting sphere, but his formula is inaccurate 
if applied near to the transmitter* 

There is no need to give her© a detailed discussion 
of the attenuation of the ground wav© as there are numerous 
articles in the literature on the subject. Two or three 
equations will be given however for purposes of comparison 


with the simple formula given above.

The following are the chief reasons for making field 
strength measurements, 

1. Analyses of antenna systems. This includes the 
determination of the effective height, radiation resistance, 
radiated power and any directional properties of the 


ant enna.

2. Investigation of the attenuation of the waves 
as they travel outwards from the transmitter. 

3. Estimations of the service areas of the station. 

4. Interference measurements on two or more stations 
on the same frequency or on adjacent frequencies. 

The determination of the effective height, radiation 
resistance and radiated power is made by taking a series 
of field strength readings on a circle around the station 
at a sufficiently close distance (5 or 6 wavelengths) to 
eliminate the effect of attenuation and averaging the 
results. Then by substitution in the equation for trans¬ 
mission without attenuation the effective height, etc, 
can be calculated. 

Investigation of the attenuation of the waves is 
mad© by plotting curves of field strength against distance 
for various directions around the transmitter and making 
comparisons between the observed results and theoretical 
curves. 

The service area of a transmitter is defined as the 
are© lying within a given field strength contour line, the 
value of the contour being the minimum field strength that 
produces satisfactory reception. Following are listed a 
few of the recommendations found in published articles on 
the subject. 

In 1926 Goldsmith^ gave the following classification.

H© also stated that the outer limit of the service area 
usually lay just under the 10 mv/meter level* 

Edwards and Brown^in 1928 stated that at least 5 
mv/meter was necessary for continuous high quality recep¬ 
tion, and in another paper published in the same year 
Jansky said that for rural areas 100 microvolts/meter 
provided good service and 50 microvolts/meter fair service, 
but that values much larger than these were necessary for 
city areas. 

Ring 5 in 1932 gave the following recommendations for 
good quality service.

For fair service the strengths were on©-half of the above 
and for poor service they were one-quarter. 

It is quite probable that with the modern super¬ 
heterodyne receivers with high sensitivity and automatic 
volume control, good results are being obtained with signal 
strengths of less than 50 microvolts/meter in localities 
that are free from bad interference.

Historical Note 


The first field strength measurements appear to 

have been made by Duddell and Taylor^ in the year 1905 

by means of the direct measurement of the current in the 

receiving antenna with a sensitive thermal ammeter• In 
1 

1906 Pickard introduced the method of comparing the 
received signal with a locally produced signal of the 
same frequency. These measurements were made by aural 
comparison as the three electrode vacuum tube had not 
yet come into general use. In 1921 Pickard developed 
this comparison method into the modern system, an example 

2 

of which is excellently described In a paper by A,Jensen. 
This system is the one which was finally adopted for this 
investigation after considerable experimentation with 
other methods. 

The particular advantage of Jensen’s method is that 
as the local measuring voltage is introduced into the loop 
instead of being applied directly to the input terminals 
of the receiver, both the signal from the transmitter and 
the comparison signal are resonated in the loop so that 
the loop resistance, which varies considerably from time 
to time and place to place, does not have to be known.

Apparatus . 

1, Loop aerial . 

The loop aerial is constructed as a square coil, the 
length of the side being considerably greater than the 
axial length. The side dimension is approximately 70 cms. 
and the axial length 18 cms.. It is wound with 16 turns of 
#21 enamelled single cotton covered wire, the turns spaced 
1 cm. apart, with a space of 3.5 cms. allowed between the 
middle turns to leave room for the supporting pole. 

The diagonal supports are made of 3/8 11 oak board with 
strips of bakelite inserted in the ends end slotted to 
hold the wires. These diagonals ©re braced at the center 
with a square piece of oak veneer on each side and an oak 
block Is set in the bottom angle to carry the supporting 
rod. 

The chief difficulty involved in the construction of 
the loop is the problem of obtaining as large an effective 
height as possible so as to feed a large signal voltage 
to the fairly insensitive receiver used, while at the same 
time keeping the distributed capacity small so that the 
loop can be tuned over the broadcast band with a 350 micro- 
microfarad variable condenser. 

The effective height of a loop‘d in meters is the 
factor by which the field strength in volts/meter must be 
multiplied to give the voltage generated in the loop by 
the passing electromagnetic wave. It is thus a measure of 
the effectiveness of the loop as an aerial.

When the plane of the loop is directed at the trans» 
mitter, the electromagnetic wave induces no voltages in 
the horizontal top and bottom wires of the loop as they 
do not "cut” the wave, being perpendicular to the wave 
front# However, voltages are generated in the vertical 
wires forming the sides of the loop as they are parallel 
to the wave front and to the plan© of polarization of the 
wave. These voltages have equal magnitudes and act in 
opposite directions around the loop and so tend to cancel 
each other, but there is a small resultant voltage due to 
the slight phase difference caused by the distance between 
the sides of the loop* 

The voltage generated in 
each side is 

s Eg : eNl volts 

where e s field strength in volts 
per meter, 

N s number of turns in loop, 

1 = length of side in meters. 

The phase difference between E n and E 0 is 2TTd cos8

d s distance between the sides of the loop in meters, 

X s wavelength in meters,

The phase difference between two points one wave¬

between two points dcose meters apart is dcos •STT radians*

If the loop is placed at an angle e as shown, voltages 
of magnitude ©Ndsin© are generated in the top and 
bottom wires, but as there Is no phase difference they 
exactly cancel each other#

be added vectorially to obtain their resultant,E*

This formula explains the 
'’figure of eight” reception 
characteristic of a loop aerial 
since when cos © = 90® the 
voltage generated in the loop 
by the wave is zero* 

The effective height of a loop of ordinary size is 
usually small since 1 and d are small compared with the 
wavelength. 

For the loop constructed in this investigation the 
effective height is calculated as follows* 

Number of turns N s 16 
Horizontal length d s .705 meters 
Vertical, length 1 s .703 ” 

Wavelength A = 517 ” 

Thus h = 27TldN = 2 x .705 x .703 x 16 

s .096 meters or 9.6 cms. 

The inductance of the loop as calculated from its 
dimensions and the number of turns according to the formula 
given in Terman’s Radio Engineering is 327 microhenries. 
This value was checked experimentally by tuning the loop 
to various frequencies with a precision condenser, noting 
the capacity required for each frequency. 

The formula for resonance 
is then fa 1

Taking the best values as 321 microhenries and 55 
micromicrofarads, the maximum frequency at which the loop 
will resonate is than 

f = _ 10~ 3 __ - 1200 K.C. 

2 TT V 321 x 10" 6 x 55 x 10~ l2 ~ 


These measurements were taken without the transposed 
wires threaded in canvas strips that are used to connect 
the loop to the receiver® These will also add some induct¬ 
ance and capacity to the above values, so that the maximum 
frequency at which measurements can be taken will be 
somewhat less than 1200 K.C*. 

The distributed capacity could b© reduced by using 
a smaller loop, wider spacing of the turns or smaller wire. 
However a smaller loop would result in less induced voltage 



























for the same field strength, wider spacing of turns would 

increase the inductance as well as making the loop too 

bulky, and the use of smaller wire would increase its 

resistance and so decrease the Q. The ideal wire for use 

in winding loops for broadcast frequencies is litzendraht 

wire, commonly called ’’litz” • It is composed of a large 

number of very fine wires insulated from each other by 

enamelling and interwoven to form a wire of ordinary size. 

This wire has a particularly low radio frequency resistance 

due to its small ”skin effect 1 ’. 

An important electrical property of the loop is its 

V. The Q of a circuit is defined as the ratio to L , 

R 

where oo s 2TT x f , 


L = inductance of the circuit, 

R - resistance of the circuit at the frequency f. 

If an alternating voltage of 
the correct frequency is impressed 
on a resonant circuit having a 
certain Q , then at resonance a 
voltage of Q x E will exist 
across both the coil and the 

condenser. The loop, being tuned to the transmitter 
frequency acts as such a circuit and since the voltage 
generated in the loop by the signal is e x h , the 
voltage that appears across the loop is e x h x Q . 

It Is possible, however, to use only one half of 
this voltage. The loop tends to act as an ordinary

antenna^in addition to its function as a loop,due to its 
height above the ground, and in order to prevent the 
unwanted voltage that results from adding to the voltage 
already across the loop it is necessary to connect the 



of the loop with respect to ground and thereby eliminates 
the so-called ”antenna effect” of the loop. The ordinary 
loop voltage is unaffected by this arrangement except 
that its useful value is reduced to on© half of what it 
otherwise would be. 

In order to effect the comparison between the received 
signal and the locally generated signal, the loop is opened 
at the center and a resistance of on© ohm is inserted. 



Thus when a known oscillating current is passed through 
this one ohm, a known voltage is generated in the loop.

and when this voltage is adjusted to produce an effect 
on the receiver equal to that caused by the electromagnetic 
wave, it is then a simple matter to calculate the field 
strength, since 

I x 1 x Q/2 = exhxQ/2 or e = I 

E 

2, Receiver * 

As the primary considerations in the construction 
of this field strength measurement set were economy, 
portability and simplicity, commensurate with reasonable 
accuracy, the receiver was built as a two tube set with 
one stage of radio frequency amplification preceding a 
biased detector. 

The voltage developed across one half of the loop 
is applied to the grid of the radio frequency amplifier, 
and the output voltage of the amplifier is applied to 
the grid of the detector. The indication of the received 
signal is given on a 50-microampere d.c. meter in the 
plat© circuit of the detector. On account of the necessity 
for portability and hence the use of batteries, the choice 
of tubes is limited to the r, 50 H series of 2 volt, low 
current tubes especially designed for battery operation. 

The radio frequency amplifier is a type 34 super control 
R.P, amplifier pentode, and the detector is a type 32 
screen-grid R.P. amplifier used as a biased detector. 

A pentode amplifier and a screen-grid detector are used 
as they both give high amplification, for as much ampli¬ 
fication as possible is necessary owing to the small

number of tubes used and the resultant lack of sensitiv- 
ity. The use of a micr©ammeter as the indicating meter 
gives the set additional sensitivity. The actual reading 
of the microammeter is not used in the measurement except 
for the purpose of making th© locally generated signal 
equal to the received signal, 

A variable gain control is incorporated into the 
grid bias circuit of the radio frequency amplifier in 
order that both large and small signal strengths may be 
measured. Th© maximum signal strength that can b© accom¬ 
odated is limited by th© maximum output voltage of the 
oscillator and attenuator, while th© minimum strength is 
limited by th© deflection of the microammeter becoming too 
small to be accurately reproduced. 

A variable grid bias control on the detector tube 
is provided in case of need, but ordinarily this control 
does not have to be altered. 

A headphone jack is placed in th© plate circuit of 
the detector to assist th© operator in tuning the local 
oscillator to the frequency of th© transmitter by means 
of the heterodyne beat note, the frequency of this not© 
being the difference between the oscillator and trans¬ 
mitter frequencies. 

All high voltage leads to the receiver and oscillator 
have 80 millihenry radio frequency chokes in them and are 
bypassed to ground with .01 microfarad condensers. 

The filament, grid bias, plat© and screen batteries

for the receiver are all turned on simultaneously with 
a triple pole switch. The filament rheostat, however 
has an open position so that the filaments may remain 
off while the plate and grid voltages are still applied. 

The sensitive microammeter has a 1 milliamper© fuse 
in series with it as a precaution against a burnout if 
the plate current of the detector should exceed 1 milli¬ 
amper©. This meter also has a variable resistor shunting 
it in order to increase its range whenever necessary and 
the resistor has an open position so that the maximum 
sensitivity of the meter may be used. The meter is kept 
shorted during transportation to prevent the needle from 
oscillating and thus becoming bent by hitting the ends 
of the scale. 

The receiver is merely used as an uncalibrated 
radio frequency vacuum tub© voltmeter for th© purpose 
of establishing the equality of two voltages; one induced 
in the loop by the passing electromagnetic wave, and th© 
other injected into the loop by the local oscillator. 

The gain control, as stated above, serves to extend the 
rang© of voltages that can be compared.

3.. The apparatus that is used to provide a known radio- 
frequency voltage in the loop equal to the voltage induced 
by the radiation from the transmitter can b© divided into 


two parts, oscillator and attenuator* 

(a) Oscillator . 

The oscillator is of the conventional shunt feed 
Hartley type, using a type 31 power triod© for economical 
battery operation. The important point to be noted in the 
design and construction of the oscillator is that it must 
be extremely well shielded to prevent the existence of any 
stray fields outside the oscillator box, as they would b© 
picked up by the loop and th© known voltage from the 
attenuator would b© interfered with. 

To assist in the reduction of stray fields, th© 
oscillator tank coil is wound as a rectangular toroid, 
since theoretically a toroidal coil has no external field* 
Actually there is a small field produced, but it is very 
much smaller than if an ordinary adenoidal coil were used. 
The cross-section of the coil is rectangular since the coil 
form is therefore much easier to construct than in the case 
of the conventional doughnut type of coil. 

The toroid is built to fit in the rather small space 
in th© oscillator box originally provided for a solenoidal 
coil, and therefore its dimensions are somewhat restricted

Terman’s Radio Engineering the inductance is 228 micro¬ 
henries, and it is tuned over the broadcast band with 
a 0,00035 microfarad variable condenser« 

To obtain the oscillating current which is used to 
provide the known output voltage, the tank coil is opened 
at the neutral or grounded point, the current is measured 
with a 0-125 mi Hiampere thermocouple meter and then 
passed through an attenuating network* The value of the 
oscillating current is altered when necessary by a non¬ 
shorting tap switch arrangement which varies the plate 
voltage of the oscillator tube in steps of 22*5 volts 
up to a maximum of 135 volts, A fine adjustment of the 
current is obtained with the variable resistor shunting 
the meter and attenuator* This resistor is of the carbon 
compression type (non-inductive) in order that adjustments 
of it may not affect the frequency of the oscillator. 

A single rotary switch turns on both the plat© and 
filament voltages of the oscillator simultaneously, but 
the plate voltage circuit may be controlled independantlv 
by the tap switch mentioned above. 

Both the oscillator tuning condenser and its vernier 
are mounted well behind the front panel and the condenser 
shafts are extended through the panel for tuning purposes 
by means of steel couplings and short lengths of bakelite 
rod. This arrangement is necessary to eliminate the stray 
fields that would be present if the condenser shafts were 
allowed to protrude through the panel.

(b) Attenuator , 

The purpose of the attenuator is to introduce a 
small yet accurately known voltage into the loop. To 
accomplish this, as was previously explained, a 1 ohm 
resistor is inserted in the center of the loop and the 
current through this ohm is measured. The difficulty 
here lies in the accurate measurement of very small 
radio frequency currents. The best system is to start 
with a large current that can be conveniently measured 
with a thermocouple type mill!ammeter, and then to 
divide the current up with a network of resistances in 
such a manner that only a known fraction of it, which 
can be calculated from the values of the resistances 
forming the network, passes through the ohm in the loop. 

The most sensitive thermocouple milliammeter that 
can be obtained at a reasonable cpst is the 0-125 rang© 
miter. This instrument unfortunately has a square law 
scale so that readings below 50 or 40 milliamperes tend 
to be inaccurate. 

The range of field strengths that this measurement 
set is designed to cover is approximately 1 to 60 milli¬ 
volts per meter. This range is divided up into four sections, 
each section being covered by variation of the current in 
the attenuator between 40 and 120 mill!amps• 

The arrangement of the oscillator and attenuator is 
shown in the diagram on the next page.

The Variable resistor R is the non-inductive 

carbon compression resistor mentioned above. The 1 

ohm on the right is the output ohm or the ohm in the 

center of the loop, and the fraction of the current 

I that passes through this ohm is varied by the tapped 

399 ohm resistor. The balance of I of course passes 

through the input ohm on the left* Thus when the tap 

A is used the current through the output ohm is l/21 I, 

and the voltage injected into the loop is I millivolts, 

YI 

I being expressed in mi Hi amperes« 

Similarly when B is used the fraction of the current 
is 1/61, with C it is l/l61 and with D it is 1/401. 

These fractions were originally intended to be l/20, 
l/60, 1/160 and 1/400 respectively, but an error in the 
calculation of the sizes of the series resistors caused 
the denominators to be increased by one in each case. 
Fortunately the difference is not large enough to warrant 
the construction of new resistors • 



























’ 


























The attenuation ratios necessary to cover the range 
of 1-60 millivolts/meter in four sections and the corres¬ 
ponding resistances are calculated as follows. One ohm 
shunt resistors ar® used as they seem to he standard 
practice and they are the smallest resistances that can 
be easily constructed while using as fin© wire as possible. 
Since the resistance inserted in the loop is 1 ohm* the 
value of the current I required to give a voltage across 
this ohm equal to the voltage produced in the loop by a 
field strength e is readily found from the equation 

I x 1 xl = e x fc , 
a 

where l/a is the fraction of I that flows through the 1 ohm, 

and h is the effective height of the loop. 

The useful range of the thermocouple milliammeter is 

40-120 m.a. or a 1-3 ratio, and since h is very nearly 

0.1 meter, to measure a field strength of 60 m.v./meter 

using 120 m.a. oscillating current, 

120 x 1 x 1 * 60 x 0.1 or a = 20. 

a 

Thus the first attenuation factor is l/20. Now when I 

is reduced to 40 m.a., the corresponding field strength 

is l/3 of 60 or 20 m.v./meter. For continuity, the 

maximum field strength measurable on the next tap with 

120 m.a. again must be then 20 m.v./meter, so that 

120 x 1 x 1 s 20x0.1 or as 60, 
a 

and when I is reduced to 40 m.a. the corresponding field 
strength is similarly l/3 of 20 or 6 2/3 millivolts/meter*

By proceeding in this manner it is easily found that 
the range 7.5 to 2.5 m.v./meter is covered when a - 160 
and when a s 400 the rang© is 3 to 1 m.v./meter, the 
current I in each case being varied between 40 and 120 m.a. 
by means of the shunting resistor R. 

The construction of this attenuating network, presents 
no small.problem, since th© resistances have to have certain 
accurately known values at radio frequencies. Th© difficulties 
of constructing a resistor that will b© accurate at radio 
frequencies are concerned with the elimination of "skin- 
effect” and inductance. At high frequencies the current 
tends to travel on the surface of the wire, so that the 
effective or useful area of th© conductor is decreased, 
and its resistance thereby increased. This is th© so-called 
"skin-effect”. Also an appreciable amount of inductance in 
a resistor will introduce an inductive reactance in addition 
to the resistance present, so that the resistor will have 
an impedance greater than its resistance. However, since 
the resistance and reactance add at right angles to give 
the impedance, a small amount of inductance in a resistor 
has a negligible effect. 

The skin-effect can be considerably reduced by the us© 
of very fine wires, but the us© of fine wire is limited, by 
the current the wire has to carry, for if th© wire becomes 
heated, its resistance will increase. The inductive effect 
also can be practically eliminated by arranging th© wire 
in a narrow loop or bililar winding, sine© a small loop

has small inductance 


Thus if the foregoing precautions ©re observed, it is 
possible to construct resistors whose radio frequency 
resistances will not differ from their d.c. values by more 
than a very small ©mount, the calibration on d.c. being 
made with a Wheatstone bridge and a sensitive galvanometer. 

All the resistances in this attenuator ©r© wound with 
fine manganin wire in the non-inductive manner mentioned 
above. The maximum size of wire used is #30, with which 
the 1 ohm shunt resistors are wound. The 19 and 40 ohm 
series units are made with #36 wire, and the 100 and 240 
ohm units are wound with very fine wire, probably #42 or 
#44. 

Moullin states that if no manganin wire larger than 
#22 is used for standard resistors, they may be considered 
to have a resistance that is independant of frequency to 
the accuracy of measurement ordinarily possible at high 
frequencies. 

2 

Also Zenneck gives a table which shows that if the 
resistance of manganin wire is not to exceed the d.c. value 
by more than 0.1$ at a frequency of 500 KG, its maximum 
diameter should be .135 mm.. For an increase of 1$, the 
maximum diameter can be .75 mm.. The largest wire used 
here, #30, has © diameter of .25 mm., so that an increase 
in resistance of less than 1 % is to be expected from all 
the units used in this attenuator.

In Jensen’s description^ of his field strength set 
he states that the impedance at radio frequency of a 
bifilar winding of #36 wire 3,5 cm. long is only l/5 ofl% 
greater than its resistance. On the basis of this fact, 
all the units in this attenuator are assumed to have 
negligible inductance. 

The following are the actual sizes of the different 
units used ; measured on direct current.

every other one is removed. 

The connection from th© rotating selector arm of the

and the whole assembly is fixed to the panel by the 
single hole mounting system of the switch. A copper box 
completely encloses both toroid and switch, and the one 
ohm shunt units are mounted on small pieces of bakelite 
in shielded partitions in the back bottom corners of the 
box* 

The output ohm is connected to the loop circuit by 
two heavy copper wires running through a rectangular 
shielding tub© made of galvanized iron, the wires being 
supported by transverse strips of bakelite* This tub© 
passes from the attenuator box through the oscillator 
'shield box into the receiver shield box, where the wires 
are connected to a 5-way jack and so to the loop by means 
of a 3-way plug and wires threaded in strips of canvas* 

The knob of the selector switch has an arrow inscribed 
on it, and fastened to the panel behind the knob is a plate 
with numbers from 1 to 10 on it, each number corresponding 
to a tap on the ten point switch* As half the switch points 
are removed, the even numbers on this dial indicate open 
positions of the attenuator, and the odd numbers correspond 
as shown in the previous diagram*

When the switch arm is on tap 9, the attenuation is 
This ratio was not originally provided for but it may 
be useful at times for the measurement of extremely large 


51 


field strengths. 

This attenuator is the outcome of several experiments 
on the production of small known radio frequency voltages. 
The first system tried was a high 
resistance potentiometer across a 
one ohm as shown, but this was 
found to b© impractical as it was 



essential that the output circuit 
should draw no current through the 

potentiometer. The next arrangement tried was simply a 
tapped low resistance forming the 
output resistance through which 
the known current flowed. The 
variable resistance was a General 
Radio decade box, and a considerable 

amount of time was spent in calibrating this box at radio 
frequency with a special type of vacuum tube voltmeter 
using a screen-grid tube. The decade box, however, was 
found to have too much inductance, so that it was discarded 
and a series of small resistors with low inductance was 
constructed to take its place. 

However, at this point it was realized that even if 
these resistors functioned properly, the system was not 
very good because the locally produced voltage was not

injected into the loop but was applied directly to the 
receiver. This meant that the Q of the loop entered 
into the calculation of the field strength, and as this 
quantity is hard to determine besides being subject to 
considerable variation, it was finally decided to adopt 
the system described by Jensen^ but with considerable 
simplification in the interests of economy. 

Operation of the field strength set . 

The following is the procedure for taking a reading. 
The loop is taken from its box and is placed on the support 
which is fastened to the left side of the car at the rear 
window. The plugs on the ends of the wires from the loop 
are inserted in the jacks in the loop tuning condenser box 
and the 3-way plug on the end of the lead from this box 
is inserted in the jack in the panel of the receiver. 

The loop tuning condenser box is arranged to hang on the 
window near the loop support while the measurment set 
itself is placed in the back seat of the car. 

With the oscillator plate voltage tap switch in an 
open position, both filament switches are turned on and 
the filament rheostat is turned up until the voltmeter 
indicates 2 volts. 

The microammeter shunting resistor is then increased 
until the meter shows a small deflection. The best place 
for this resistor is just before the open position is 
reached. At this point the shunting resistance is about

■. ■ 




























equal to the meter resistance so that the range of the 
meter is about twice the full scale deflection* 

The headphones are plugged in and the receiver gain 
control is turned up. The loop is then rotated and the 
loop and receiver tuning dials are adjusted until the 
station is brought in and the microammeter deflection is 
a maximum. If the signal is modulated, the headphones assist 
materially in locating and tuning in the station* 

The microammeter deflection is then adjusted to a 
suitable value by means of the gain control and the reading 
is noted. 

Next the attenuator switch is set on a low tap, 1 or 3, 
and the oscillator plat© voltage switch is set on a low 
voltage point, about 45 volts. The oscillator is tuned to 
the transmitter frequency until a very low beat note is 
heard in the headphones. When the beat note is very low 

it may be seen with the swing of the microammeter needle. 

o 

At this point the loop is rotated through 90 until 
the reception from the transmitter is zero. The oscillator 
plate voltage is increased, and the carbon resistor and 
attenuator tap switch are varied until the deflection of 
the microammeter is the same as it was for the reception 
from the transmitter, with a convenient current shown on 
the thermal mi Hi ammeter. 

If the frequency of the oscillator varies while these 
adjustments are being made, it is readjusted with the 


vernier condenser

No dials or knobs associated with the loop or the 
receiver are touched after the microammeter deflection 

is once set with the receiver gain control. 

The measurement is then finished except for the 
calculation of the field strength from the equation 

e = 1 . I 

a h 

where e = field strength in millivolts/meter, 

1 = attenuation factor, 

a 

I = oscillating current in milliamperes, 

h “ effective height of loop in meters. 

In turning off the set after a reading has been 
taken, the microammeter is shorted and the oscillator 
plate voltage switch placed in an open position. The 
filament rheostat is turned off before either filament 
switch, otherwise if one circuit were opened first the 
voltage on the other filament would increase immediately 
to a dangerous value. 

The usual system of making a field strength survey 
is to take several series of readings in radial directions 
about the transmitter. About eight equally spaced radials 
are used and curves are plotted on semi-logarithmic paper 
showing the variation in signal strength as the distance 
from the transmitter is increased. 

From these curves contour lines of equal field strength 
can be plotted on a map of the country around the transmitter 
for comparison of the intensity of the radiation in various 


directions

Readings ar© also taken on a circle around the 
transmitter at a distance of about 5 wavelengths in order 
to obtain a value of the effective height of the antenna, 

A distance of 5 wavelengths is used in order that the 
readings may not be affected by either the induction fields 
that exist near the transmitter or by attenuation of the 
waves as they travel over the surface of the ground*

These readings were then plotted on polar paper, 

(see preceding page) so that the distance from the origin 
to any point on the curve represents the field strength in 
that direction at a point 1.69 miles from the transmitter* 

The curve in the southwest quadrant is estimated since at 
the time the readings were taken the roads in that area 
were impassible and observations could not be made on that 
portion of the circle.

and thus the average radius is r = /llTE = 1.92 ins.

Since the scale of the graph is 1 inch * 16 millivolts/meter, 
the average field strength is 1.92 x 16 s 30.6 buy. /meter.

The transmitter is unfortunately rather badly 
situated for this investigation of its effective height 
as it is closely surrounded by the University buildings, 
particularly the residences and the Plant Pathology lab, 
and the river valley and the built-up areas of the city 
are bound to have some effects. This last fact is seen 
in the irregularity of the curve towards the east. As 
there are not many big buildings directly on the south 
bank of the river valley, this irregularity is probably 
due to either the topography of the valley or to the 
proximity of the campus buildings. However, sufficient 
work has not yet been done in this area to determine the 
exact cause. 

If it is due to the valley, then it is to be expected 
that a similar irregularity wil^e found to occur in the 
south-west portion of the curve when it can be investigated.

The curves are plotted on semi-logarithmic paper and 
comprise pages 42, 43, and 44. On each sheet is plotted 
also the theoretical inverse distance curve for no atten¬ 
uation for purposes of comparison. An effective height of 
24.4 meters was used in the calculations for this curve. 

The chief us© of these curves in this investigation 
is for the construction of a field strength contour map. 
However they can also be used to make a comparison with 
curves predicted from attenuation theory. The formula 
used her© is that of Somxnerfeld as given by Eckersley^, 
as it is simple in form and easy to apply. 

In this formula the theoretical field strength values 

(from the inverse distance law) are multiplied by a 

reduction factor S. This factor is obtained from a graph 

showing S as a function of Sommerfeld’s ’’numerical 

distance”, called d_ • which is in turn a function of 

the earth conductivity c r , the wavelength X , and the 

distance from the transmitter x. The equation for finding 

d is as follows,

in cms and cr is expressed in c.g.s. units# 

Using a few normal values of reduction factors 

were calculated for several points on the theoretical 

inverse distance field strength curve until two new 

curves were obtained which fitted closely the observed 

results, one slightly high and the other slightly low. 

On page 45 are shown the observed curves for the south 

and south-east directions together with the theoretical 

curves for no attenuation, for cr * 0.3 x 10 and also 
-13 

0.4 x 10 c.g.s. units. The south and south-east curves 

were taken sine© there is more even topography in these 

directions. From this graph it is evident that the value 

-13 

of o~ lies between 0.3 and 0.4 x 10 c.g.s. units.

Eckersley states that cr = i x 10 for open pastoral 

-13 

country and for hilly country cr s 0.5 x 10 . Thus it 

seems that the conductivity as determined here is rather 
low for the open nature of the country. This may well b© 
due to the fact that the top few feet of the soil was 
frozen when these readings were taken and all water present 
would be in the form of ice. 

It was found when the readings for these curves were 
being taken that there was a small amount of stray pickup 
getting through from the local oscillator to the receiver 
and that the higher attenuation ratios were not what they 
were supposed to be. The effect of the stray pickup was 
eliminated by allowing it to be present when the signal

from the transmitter was being received and new attenuation 
ratios were found by a calibration process using the l/21 
tap as a starting point. The ratios as used for taking 
these readings are l/2X, l/54, l/lQ5, and l/X51. The 
exact cause of this discrepancy has not yet been determined 
but it is probably due to unforseen capacities in the 
attenuator system. 

From the curves showing the field strength as a 
function of the distance from the transmitter, points of 
equal field strength in the various directions are taken 
and plotted as contours on a map of the locality, page 47. 
Owing to the fact that all side roads were blocked with 
snow at the time readings were taken, it was possible to 
make measurements along only the main highways. To this 
extent the contours in the in-between areas may be slightly 
inaccurate, especially in the south-west. 

When this investigation was started it was desired 
to find whether or not the new L-type antenna recently 
erected was directional. As the effect for this antenna 
should be an increase in strength towards the north, there 
does not appear to be any marked directivity in this case. 
To make certain of this, however readings should be taken 
out to the limit of the ground wav© to get rid of any 
local effects caused by the city or the river valley. 

There is a considerable increase in strength towards 
the south and south-west, and a marked diminution exists 
towards the north-west. It is noticeable, however, that 
the diminution does not start until some distance from the

transmitter is reached. This effect may therefore be due 
to some strictly local cause along the St Albert road. 
Unfortunately owing to the condition of the side roads 
this explanation could not be tested. 

On the whole it may be said that with the new antenna 
the general shape of the contours is reasonably satisfactory. 

The increase in strength towards the south and south¬ 
east cannot be attributed to any reflecting or directing 
action of the buildings near to the transmitter as none 
of them have a height that is a sufficiently large fraction 
of one wavelength. Prom the value of the earth conductivity 
obtained for this direction, is it probable that this 
strength is normal and that there is more attenuation in 
the other directions. 

In conclusion the author wishes to thank Dr. MacLeod 
for his supervision and assistance during the course of 
the investigation, also Mr. Cornish for his help and th© 
use of his car for the fieldwork, and Mr. Sinclair for 
the operation of the transmitter*
