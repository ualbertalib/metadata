CHAPTER I. 
INTRODUCTION 


DEFINATION OF FLOTATION , 

Weinig and Palmer (l) define flotation as followsj- 
"Pinely divided ore is agitated in water containing ImUbles 
of air or gas, A small amount of ore or more reagents may¬ 
be present, bat not necessarily. Under these conditions the 
small particles of the so-called floatable minerals show a 
tendency to attach themselves to the films of the bubbles, 
which then carry the particles to the surface of the water. 

A small amount of a so-called frothing oil is generally added 
for the purpose of increasing the stability of the bubbles, 
so that they can be removed, taking their load of mineral 
particles with them. The floatable minerals tend to absorb 
a film of air or other gas, rather than a film of water, where¬ 
as the reverse is true of the minerals that are difficult to 
float. The latter minerals, because of the absorbed film of 
water, tend to remain in suspension in the water or sink to the 
bottom of the vessel. Thus there can be affected a more or less 
complete separation of the two classes of minersils, assuming, 
of course, that the grinding has been sufficient to unlock all 
of the particles of different composition. The separation does 
not depend upon differences in specific gravity; in fact, the 












- 2 - 


sulphide minerals, which are heavier than the oxidized minerals, 
ordinarily are the easiest to float* A particle of mineral may¬ 
be so large, however, that its weight will counteract its affinity 
for the film of the bubble.” 

FIOTATICH RBAGENTS * 

Chemical reagents added to the pulp perfom various 
functions* Those whidi lower the surface tension of the water 
and th-us produce a stable froth are known as frothing agents* 

The more common fa?othing agents are,- pine oils and cresols 
(CH^*C^Hi|. 0 H). Those which fom a film coating on the mineral 
particles and thxis cause the particles to attach themselves to 
the air bubbles are known as collecting agents* The more 
commonly xised collecting agents are, - potassium ethyl xanthate 
(C2H5.OCSSK), thiocarbanilid (C6H5.KH*C02SH*C5H5), oleic acid 
( (C3^yH^^02)3C^H^)f creosotes and crude oils* Other functions 
of the flotation reagents are to produce certain changes upon 
the particles of ore so as to increase or decrease the tendency 
of the collecting agent to coat the particles. These are known 
as activating, depressing, conditioning and sulphidizing agents. 
The activating agents increase the floatability of the minerals; 
copper sulphate (CaSCi^.5H20) is the only one known. Sulphidizing 
agents form a sulphide film on the mineral surface/ l^hus causing

the mineral to act as a sulphide, sodium sulphide (Na2S) is 
generally used. Depressing agents are those which decrease 
the floatahility of the minerals; some of the more in^ortant 
depressants are,-> lime (CaO), cyanides (BCN), sodium silicate 
(Na2Si40^), zinc sulphate (ZnS04. ), and sodium hichromate 

(Na2Cr20Y2B^0). Conditioning agents give alkalinity or acidity 
to the pulp solution, For acid pulps sulphuric (H2SO4) or 
hydrochloric (HCl) acids; and for alkaline or neutral pulps, 
lime, soda ash (Na^CO^) and cement are generally used, 

TYPES OP PLOTATIOH OPERATIQHS . 

There are three types of froth flotation processes. 
l)The agitation type, which depends upon the local super saturation 
of the water of a pulp with air by the mechanical action of a 
swiftly revolving beater, and the simultaneous preferential 
precipitation of the air in the fom of bubbles on the metallic 
mineral particles, (2) The pneumatic type in which the air is 
introduced through a porous medium at the bottom of the flotation 
cell, ( 3 ) The sub-aeration process in which the air is introduc¬ 
ed into the pulp below the impeller by reason of the centrifugal 
force induced by an impeller revolving in the pulp, 

FACTORS INPLOMCINa FLOTATION. 


Prom the defination given it is evident that there are 
many factors which influence flotation. This is especially true 











- 4 - 


for selective separation of the minerals in con^lex ores such as 
the Flin Flon ore. For concentration and separation of the 
minerals in the Flin Flon ore to give a copper concentrate, a 
zinc concentrate, prohahly an iron concentrate and a fa^irly clean 
tailing; some of the factors which have to he taken into consid¬ 
eration are,- mineral associations, size of mineral particles, 
chemical composition of minerals and its effect on floatahility, 
pulp water, contaminants, temperature and time of treahnent* 

Mineral Associations . !rhe manner in which the various 
minerals are associated with each other will influence the 
separation and concentration of the minerals into various products. 
Cres consisting of hard and soft minerals, or of brittle and 
tough minerals, fracture, in the coarse of grinding at the 
junction of the dissimilar grains. The softness and interstitial 
character of some sulphides also favor their liberation and their 
becoming ground to such a fineness as to present enhanced flotative 
properties. It can also be said that structural features of 
minerals belonging to different generations are different, the 
oldest minerals are fractured and conented by younger minerals. 
Gaudin ( 2 ) states,- "In the ores of this type the matrix is 
generally softer and disaggregation talces place readily at the 
boundary between the grains because of the sudden change in 
mechanical properties at that boundary* These properties result 
in the production of comparatively coarse ore particles derived 













- 5 - 

from the older fractured mineral and of finer ore particles derived 
from the vein filling. Pyrite frequently occurs ae a primary 
mineral with chalcopyrite and ^halerite fillings.'* This is true 
of FI in Flon ore where pyrite is the primary mineral and secondary 
chalcopyrite and zinc blende are the vein fillings. 

Size of Mineral Particles . The texture of an ore is an 
important factor in determining the size to which the ore should 
be ground in oi*der to liberate its minerals into particles con¬ 
sisting of one mineral only. Coarse grained ores do not require 
fine grinding to liberate the mineral particles but fine-grained 
ores require finer degree of grinding. In some cases where ex- 

A 

tremely fine grinding is necessary to liberate the mineral particles, 
there occurs a very poor recovery of metallic minerals in the fine 
sizes of flotation pulps which is not only due to the greater 
abundance of oxidized minerals in those sizes but also to non¬ 
flotation of particles that apparently are perfectly suited to 
float exc^t for their fineness. Gaudin (2) who carried out in¬ 
vestigations on the floatability of various particle sizes, states,- 
"The only interpretation that can be placed on the results is that 
there is a gradual decrease in readiness to adhere to air bubbles 
from coarse to fine particles, and that this tendency is manifested 
)y an acutely perc^tible reduction in recovery on proceeding from 
medium-fine (300 to 1000 mesh) particles to very fine particles 
[under 6000 mesh)". 










- 6 - 


Chemical Courposltion of Minerala. In the separation 
and concentration of ores hy flotation, the individual chemical 
properties of the surface of the ground ore particles, rather 
than the chemical composition of the ore as a whole, are the 
controlling factors that cause the particles to either float 
or sink, and determine the value of the ore* The physico¬ 
chemical reaction in flotation is between the surfaces of the 
mineral particles and the flotation reagents, for e^caoiple, 
zinc blende is easily floated when given a zanthate coating, 
but if zinc sulphate is added to the pulp* zinc blende will 
take a zinc sulphate coating and will be less easily floatable 
even with most active collectors* This same zinc-sulphate- 
coated particle can be made to float readily by coating it with 
copper sulphates* Surface coating of mineral particles may be 
accozoplished and controlled by the mill operator by adding cer¬ 
tain chemical reagents. But surface coating of mineral particles 

-^0 

may, sometimes, be due to secondary enrichment or oxidation* 
Gaudin (2) has this to say about secondary enrichment,- ”ilthough 
similar in some respects to the later stages of priinary miner¬ 
alization, secondary enrichment differs from them in that the 
sulphide grains have reacted with the metalliferous solution, 
which may or may not be the case with the later stages of primary 
mineralization. In other words, secondary enrichment occurs as 
coatings upon the surfaces of the primary sulphide grains and 











- 7 - 

may contain the same metal or a different metal from the primary 
grains*” Prom the point of view of flotation the coating of 
mineral particles hy secondary enrichment is a very important 
factor and in some cases an undesirahle one* Por exao^le, a pyrite 
grain may he coated by chalcopyrite hy secondary enrichment and 
when floating for copper, this copper coated pyrite will he float¬ 
ed* In such a case it is necessary to grind to such an extent as 
to tear the chalcopyrite coatings fromtkie pyrite in order to separate 
the sulphide copper from the barren pyrite* 

Tarnished surfaces of sulphides have flotative properties 
more like those of oxides than like those of untarnished sulphide 
surfaces, and are less easily floatable* Tarnishing or surface 
oxidation of ore particles may take place in the ground before 
mining operations begins it may also take place during the mining 
operations themselves which allow mine water and air to act upon 
the ore. Oxidation cannot be prevented, but during mining and 
dressing operations, it can be decreased by decreasing the length 
of time from the time the ore has been broken in the stope until 
it has been concentrated* 

It may be said that chemical composition of the minerals 
has certain effects on the floatability. A sulphide mineral 
particle is more easily floated than a non-sulphide particle, 
but even among the sulphides there is a sli^t difference in 
floatability. For instance, with the use of a frother only, the 






4 ?^

- 8 - 


order of floatability Is as follows:- copper, lead, zinc, 
nickel, cobedt, and Iron. But if a collector is added the order 
of floatability is the reverse of the above series. The order 
of floatability with the collector roughly corresponds with the 
order of oxidation of the sulphide minerals. By using an 
oxidizing agent, it is possible to float the sulphides in the 
following order:- copper, lead, zinc, and iron. Hence, it is 
the chemical coEt^osition of the minerals which will detexmine 
the order of separation of the minerals in the ore* 

Sometimes, soluble portions of the ore exerts a great 
influence upon the recovery of metal and upon the grade of the 
concentrate obtained. This is true in the case of the Flin Flon 
ore which has a little soluble copper salt produced after grind¬ 
ing, and which tends to promote the flotation of the zinc in the 
recovery of copper. The influence exerted by the soluble portions 
of the ore in most cases can be controlled. 

Puln Water . The purpose of water in flotation is to 
maintain the ore in a partially suspended, dispersed condition 
so that the particles may come into intimate contact with the re¬ 
agents and the bubbles; to thoroughly wet the gangue; and to dis¬ 
solve, or take into suspension, the various reagents that are used. 
The ratio of water to ore varies from four-to-one to one-to-one, 
depending on the grade of ore. With a very high dilution of pulp 
and low grade ore, each bubble in thb froth carries fewer mineral 





! 








- 9 - 

particles, and loses stability, since it is the mineral 
particles adhering to the babbles which give the stability* 
Hence, the amoant of water used has an important bearing on 
flotation; and when a satisfactory pulp dilution has been ob¬ 
tained in any given case, every effort should be made to keep 
this condition constant. Any variation in the dilution affects 
the reagents concentration, and also the action of the differ¬ 
ent physical and chemical forces* 

g^ntaminflutfl. OJhe purity of the water used in flotation 
should be taken into consideration* A fresh piece of sulphide 
mineral may be floated readily in distilled water with proper 
reagents added. The same p iece of mineral in a given ore pulp 
or in a given water may not float at all when the same reagents 
are used* Sometimes, foreign matter or contaminant, by acting 
as a depressant for a certain mineral may be helpful in a 
selective flotation* The foreign matter in water will vary from 
time to time. This factor cannot be eliminated nor very well 
controlled* 

A large proportion of the slimes in the ore pulp, de¬ 
rived from what Gaudin (2) assumes to be ”the micro crystalline 
alteration products of primary minerals by kaolinization, 
chloritization and sericitization'^ act as contaminants* 




f • ^

Teproeralnire* Tesiiperature of the pulp has an effect on 
flotation. Waxm solutions require a smaller amount of reagents 
and give speed and intensity to the physical and chemical re¬ 
actions. Most minerals are less easily floatable in cold water, 
especially zinc. 

Time of Treatment . All chemical reactions require 
appreciable and varied length of time for their con^letion. 

Lime requires ample time for the chemical reactions to taka 
place and is generally added to the ball mill, while xanthate, 
reacting very reqpidly, is added just before the froth is being 
taken off* This time interval is known as conditioning and 
proper time to be given for conditioning can only be known 
throu^ experience. The period will vary according to the 
minerals present in the ore and the reagents used. 

BMaENTS FOR COPPBR - ZINC - KON SEPARATION . 

The reagents to be used to give the best results for a 
particular ore can only be found out by experiment. For copper- 
zinc-iron separation, lime (CaO) or soda ash (Na^CO^) could be used 
for conditioning and to give the desired alkalinity. In the case 
of soda ash, it would be necessary to use a depressing agent 
for iron if iron accurs as pyrite, as sodium carbonate has no 
depressing effect, whereas lime has a d^ressing effect on pyrite. 

Pine oils and cresols are used extensively to give a

froth. The froth given pine oil is more voluminous than 
that given hy cresol. The choice between the two depends on 
the type of froth desired. Cresylic acid (cresol) has a 
slight selective action for zinc blende. 

Ethyl xanthates are the most generally used collectors. 
Xanthates have little selective action and if added in suffi¬ 
cient amount, they will float nearly anything. Thiocarbanilid 
is also used as a collecting agent, but due to its low solubility 
in water, it is seldom used directly, but ordinarily, is used 
as a solution of about one part of the salt in four parts of 
ortho-toluidin known as TT mixture. The ortho-toluidin has 
little or no value as a flotation reagent, and is used simply 
as a solvent* Due to the high cost of this solvent, thiocarbanilid 
is not used to as great an extent as the xanthates. 

The only activating reagent for zinc is copper sulphate 
(CuSOi^.^HgO). Zinc sulphate (ZnS 04 » 7 % 0 ) is a satisfactory 
depressing reagent for the zinc and iron. Sodium cyanide is an 
iii 5 )ortant reagent in flotation because of its great effective¬ 
ness in preventing the floating of zinc and iron minerals, but 
due to its high cost, it is used only where zinc sulphate cannot 
be used. 

It has been found by the Denver Laboratories of the 
Complex Ores Hecovery Con^any, Denver, Colorado (3), when carry-

ing out flotation tests on the Flin Flon ore, that sodlnm 
chloride (NaCl) had a depressing effect on the talc which 
floated with the copper minerals, thus lowering the copper 
concentrates* 

The amounts of the various flotetion reagents to he 
used depends on the nature of the ore and definite values can 
only he obtained from actual practice* 







CHAPTER 2, 


PLIN FLON ORE BODY 

DISCOVERY . 

Almost the first prospecting done in the region 
was in 1896, when Mr. Loucks (4) made an expedition to Reed Lake, 
where he staked a claim for gold. It was not mtil I 9 O 8 , how¬ 
ever, that any interest was taken in the region. About this 
time active prospecting was begun. In 1913, the finding of 
gold-bearing quartz veins on imisk Lake caused a great deal of 
activity in the region. In the summer of 1915, the Flin Flon 

to 

ore body was discoveredby the Creighton-Mosher party, and in the 
autumn of the same year the Mandy lens was located by Reynolds 
and Jackson. Since then the mineral belt north of the Pas, 
Manitoba, has attracted considerable attention. 

LOCATIOM . 

The Flin Flon ore-body (5) is situated at the 
south-east end of Flin Flon Lake. The ore-body lies in township 
67, ranges 29 and 30, west of the first meridian, five miles 
east of the second meridian west. The latitude is approximately 
54 ® 45 * north and longitude approximately 101® 55 * west^

lying in a right randant angle of the Inteiprovincial ■boundary 
and lies partially in the province of Manitoba and partially 
in the province of Saskatchewan,being cut in two places by the 
"boundary line* 

DBVELOBmT. 

After the discovery of the Plin Flon ore-body in 
19I^» some trenching was done that summer to obtain an idea of 
the size of the deposit* In the autumn of that year, claims 
were recorded. Diamond drilling was commenclid in March, I916, 
by Hayden-Stone (6) interests of Hew York and Boston, and in 
four months 6OOO feet of drilling were done. Failing to come 
to an agreaaent with the owners, the work was suspended. In 
the spring of 1917 » the Fasken interests of Toronto agreed with 
the owners to continue drilling, carrying on the work until 
July, I9I8. In all, 44 holes were drilled representing a total 
of 25,664 feet. 

In March, 1920 , an option was taken on the property 
by the Mining Corporation of Canada jointly with the Hew York 
interests. During that year two shafts were put down and some 
cross-cutting and drifting done on the ore-body. 

In Hovember, 1925 # the Mining Coipora^tion interested 


the Minerals S^aration Con^any, representing the Whitney interests 







Ci£ 









- 15 - 

of New York* A series of laboratory experiments was carried 
out by the Denver Laboratories of Conplex Ores Recoveries 
Conroany (7) a flotation process was developed for the 
concentration of the chalcopyrite and zinc blende. In order 
to test the process under th^ conditions existing at the pro¬ 
perty, an experimental pilot mill, capable of handling 25 tons 
od ore per day, was erected on the property in 1927• The mill 
operated on fresh ore from underground mining operations until 
February, 1928, It was decided to develop and work the d^sit 
and the Hudson Bay Mining and Snelting Company was fomed, with 
the IJhitney people holding a fifty per cent interest* 

The suceess of the project required adequate trans¬ 
portation in the form of rail connection with the Hudson Bay 
Railway, a distance of 87 miles* 

As soon as the steel reached FI in Flon, construction 
of a 3000 -ton concentrating mill at Hin Flon and a power plant 
at Island Falls was begun. In June 10th, 1930, the transmission 
line was testedand current delivered to the main transfomers at 
Flin Flon. Immediately, after the power was available, the mine, 
crashing plant and the concentrator equipment was planed in 
operation, but actual milling, concentrating and smelting 
operations did not comence till Nov^ber, 19 th, 1930.

of 1931 * 595 cars of "blister copper and 43 O cars of zinc

seven million pounds of copper, and forty-five million pounds

GENERAL GEOLOGY. 

The geological features of the ilin Plon ore- 
body, is described in a report by E. C. Wallace { 9)9 as 
follows:- ”The ore-body lies in amygdaloidal greenstones 
which are to be referred, to the earliest volcanic flows in 
this district. They have been named by E. L. Bruce (10)(who 
has mapped this area in detail for the Geological Survey), 
the Amisk volcanics, owing to their prevalence in the vicinity 



Associated with the greenstones, and 


probably somewhat later in age, although earlier than the 
granite intrusions, are quartz pozpliyries which are parallel 
in strike to the greenstones ( 326 ®) and which do not here dis¬ 
play clear-cut intrusive relationships into the greenstones. 
There are also lanqprophyric dykes which are apparently earlier 
than the intrusions of grajiite, probably earlier than the 
quartz porphyry flows, though later than the amygdaloidal 








a

greenstones* The later granite, which is found one mile 
southwest of the Plin Plon ore-hody, and to which may he re¬ 
ferred the granite porphyry iit rusion immediately north of 
the ore-hody, has been named hy Bruce the Kaminis granite* 

This granite is intrusive, not only into the volcanics re¬ 
ferred to above, but also into sediments that overlie the 
volcanics, but which are not exposed in the immediate vicinity 
of the Hin Hon property. “ 

Shearing took place, probably during the earlier 
st|ges of the eruption of the Kaminis granite* During the 
process of shearing, the quartz porphyry offered greater re¬ 
sistance to shearing forces than did the amygdaloidal green¬ 
stone* In all probability, the zones that suffered intensive 
shearing represent' a volcanic tuff interbanded with the more 
massive lava flows* In the process of replacements by sul¬ 
phides, the more sheared zones have suffered much greater diange 
than have the more massive members. 

The Plin Plon deposit are to be referred to the 
Kaminis granite as ore deposit representing deposition at higher 
temperatures* 

SHAPE MD EXTENT OP THE OBE-BODY * 

The ore-body, which skirts the south-east shore 












.:3 



- 18 - 

of the Jlin Hon Lake, strikes north 30 ® west, and dips from 
60 to 70 degrees to the north east. The diamond drill boring 
records show that, at the south end of the deposit, it pitches 
at a low angle to the south. In one place, qiiartz poiphyry 
dyke forms the hanging wall of the ore-body. *Hbrses* of unmineraliz¬ 
ed greenstone separate the ore-body into more or less independent 
lenses (Figure 1 and 2. Pages 19 and 20). 

The total length of the ore-body, on the surface 
is 2,593 feet; at a depth of 900 feet, it has a length of 
over 1000 feet. It has greatest width at 400 feet depth; and 
at 900 feet, it narrows to 35 feet. It is estimated that there 
are 16,000,000 tons of ore available. The ore-body is most 
compact at the north end and shows a tendency to intermingle 
with inclusions of considerable widths of country rock towards 
the south end and at depth. 

MINERALOGY . 

Macro8conic . Macroscopic examination of specimens 
show the principal metallic minerals are pyrite, zinc blende 
and chalcopyrite with small amounts of gold and silver. The 
zinc blende is of two varieties, sphalerite and marmatite. 

Some galina occurs where zinc Hends is abundant. Arsenopyrite 
occurs sparingly as clear cut crystals enclosed in pyrite.

There is no evidence of free gold or silver in the handspeci-

phides and with the gangue minersils.

sections with reflected light, show the sulphides in a hypi-

phide solutions were differentially inpj^overished in iron duriig

The relationships of the other sulphides, chalcopyrite, galena 
and arsenopyrite was probably prior to zinc blende (Plate 4*) 
and may have been contenporaneous with pyrite* 

Examinations of thin sections of the ore specimens 
have shown the gangue minerals to be hornblende, actinolite,

chlorite, sericite, hiotite, quartz and calcite (Plate 5*) 

J. Wright (11) carried out microscopic examination of 
rocks occuring in the PLin Hon area* He includes, besides 
the minerals mentioned above, the following,- epidote, 
feldspar, garnet, and o there in lesser quantities* 

Microscopic examinations of the ore specimenl^s 
have shown that the sulphides penetrate the crystals of horn¬ 
blende and other silicates and it i s clearly seen that the 
sulphides were introduced later than the silicates* Some of 
the quartz has been introduced during the sulphide deposition 
as it is closely associated with the sulphide minerals and 
bears no relation to the gangoe minerals which constitute the 
schistose rock. (Plates 6 and 7*)* Alteration of the feld^ars, 
hornblende, actinolite and biotite has yielded chlorite, 
sericite, and talc in considerable quantities* These minerals 
give a bandixg appearance to the rock and polarized light be¬ 
tween crossed nicols, shows that the minerals along the band¬ 
ing have a common extinction* 

There is a difference of opinion as to the altera¬ 
tion of the silicate minerals durirg deposition of the sul¬ 
phides* Alcock (4) suggests tha,t the silicate minerals were 
altered by the hot solutions which brought the ore. Th)^ wall 
rock near the sxilphide zone contains much sericite; and irregular 





■ ■ w 




- 23 - 

masses of talc have been found in chlorite schist and in the 
sericite schist of the footwall. J. P. Wright (ll) draws the 
following conclusion:-* interesting feature of specimens 

studied microscopically, is the small amount of alteration of 
the gangae minerals during the deposition of the sulphide. 

About fifty specimens of sulphide-bearing rock have been studied 
microscopically and these exhibit no evidence of widespread 
silicification or chloritization of the wall-rocks, which is a 
characteristic feature of seme deposits of similar type in 
othffl: parts of the world. Presh silicates are included within 
the sulphides and the minerals adjoining veinlets of sulphides 
are unaltered. In some specimens biotite or hornblende is 
slightly bleached and some feldspar is altered to saussurite 
in small areas. — Chlosdte and sericite are abundant in 
some sulphide bodies, Wt these minerals are also characteristic 
minerals of the metamorphosed rocks outside the deposit. Where 
pyrite crystals are developed these cut across foils of chlorite; 
bits of chlorite, sericite and spidote occur within the massive 
sulphides. Althou^ in some specimens it is difficult to prove 
that the secondary silicates resulted entirely from metamoxphi^ 
along shear zones before the sulphide bodies formed, nevertheless 
the available evidence sirggests strongly that this is the iiaport- 
ant source of these minerals rather than alteration associated

TYPES OF ORE> 

The ore consists of two fairly distinct types; solid 
sulphide and disseminated ores. The solid sulphide variety con* 
sists of very fine grained pyrite* containing zinc hlende, 
chalcopyrite with occasional fragnents of schist, quartz and 
calcite (Plate 2.). 

In places the ore is handed where the zinc hlende 
and the chalcopyrite fom narrow hands in the pyrite. 

The disseminated ore consists of schistose rock 
iaqpregnated with sulphides (Plate 6.) 

The solid sulphides occur in the centre and towards 
the hanging wall of the ore-hody (Figures Nos* 1 and 2. Pages 
19 and 20), and are, in places, in direct contact with the hang¬ 
ing wall; whereas the disseminated ore is largely confined to a 
zone along the footwall. Jklthough it is sometimes found on the 

side. 

hangiig wall''in the upper part of the deposit. The hanging 
dissaninated ore is fonnd to carry smaller percentage of copper 
and greater portion of gold and silver than the dissaainated ore 
on the footwall* The zinc blende is more abundant on the hanging 
waill side. Contacts between the solid sulphides and the *horses« 
of unmineralized TOcks are quite sharp; also the boundaries be*

tween the two types of ore axe fairly distinct, thoti^ in 
places a graduation between the two varieties is found. 

ORIGIN . 

The deposit is a replacement along the shear zone« 
The Kaminis granite and its offshoots seem to be the parent 
body from which the mineralizing solutions have come. Elsewhere 
in the area the sulphide bodies frequently occur in close as« 
sociation with quartz veins carrying gold. It is evident that 
the gold-bearing veins are the closisag phases of the granite 
intrusions and it is probable that the sulphides were derived 
from the same source. 

It seems that there was an earlier introduction 
ofiyrite which replaced and is^regnated the cmshed and sheared 
rock. Later movenents fractured and granulated the pyrite, and 
the chalcopyrite and the zinc blende were introduced. The seg¬ 
regation of these minerals into individual zones may have been 
by selective precipitation. Since the country rock was 
schistose even at the time of the first mineralization, its re¬ 
placement by pyrite would take place most easily along the planes 
of schistosity. 

BJTECT OP MINERAL COMPOSITION ON FLOTATION . 

The metallic minerals axe sulphides of iron, copper 














- 26 


and zinc* Being sulphides, the ore should not present any 
difficulties in separation and concentration* As there were 
two periods of mineral d^osition in the Hin I'lon ore-^hcdy, 
there is a possibility that the copper and the zinc minerals, 
of the later d^osition, coat the pyrite rntne ral particles, 
and thus make that mineral act as the coatingf For exan^ple, 
a pyrite grain may be coated by chalcopyrite and when floating 
for copper this copper coated pyrite will go to the copper 
concentrate. In such a case it would be necessary to grind 
to such an extent as to tear the coatings from thejyrite in 
order to separate the minerals* 

The zinc minerals are not purely zinc sulphides, 
they vary in composition from ^halerite to the iron variety, 
maimatite. It is not probable that the iron type would present 
more difficulties in separation than the sphalerite, but it is 
reasonable to expect higher iron in the concentrates due to 
the iron in the zinc blende* 

Gold and silver are present in both sul;^id€ and 
gangue minerals* That with the sulphide is recoverable in flota¬ 
tion concent ratios, but that in the gangue minerals, requires 
excessively fins grinding to be liberated* 

Chlorite, sericite and talc always present some 
difficulties in flotation. These minerals are flahy and present 
a large suaface for a small mass, and are readily floated* Thus

they tend to come up with the metallic mineral concentrates, 
decreasing the grade of those concentrates* 









CHAPTER 


PREVIOUS WORK OH FLIN FLON ORB 


Investigations on the concentration and separation 
of the minerals in the 51 in Plon ore were carried out hy the 
Ore Dessing and Metallurgical Laboratories, Department of Mines, 
Ottawa, the General Engineering Company, Salt Lake City, Utah, 
and the Denver Laboratories of the Complex Ores Recovery 
Company, Denver, Colo rado• 

INVESTIGATIONS BY T^ ORE DRESSING AM) METALLURGICAL LABORATORIES. 
OTTAWA. IN 1221. 

Investigations by the Or© Dessing and Metallurgical 
Laboratories(12) consisted of a large nismber of flotation tests, 
using the laboratory type apparatus on the differential flotation 
of the minerals in the Plin Plon ore* The object was to detemin© 
if the minerals could be separated into products suitable for re* 
duction, or metallurgical treatment into metallic state. 

The shipment received by the Ore Dessing and 
Metallurgical Laboratories consisted of 229 pounds of drill cores, 
crushed to about one-half inch size, from the exploration work 
on the massive sulphide zone. 


Possible Lines of Investigation . On account of the 





















- 29 • 

nature of the Flln Flon siilphide ore, which consists of 
practically solid sulphides of iron, zinc and copper with the 
gangue minerals less than ten per cent. It presented a most 
Intricate metallurgical problem to detezmlne the most economical 
method of treatment. Three of the most promising lines of 
Investigations decided upon were as follows 

1. The concentration of the copper mineral by selective 
flotation and the separation by differential flotation 
of the chalcopyrite, zinc blende and pyrite, resulting 
in copper and zinc products suitable for subsequent re¬ 
duction to the metals* 

2. The hydro-metallurgical treatment of the ore, or of 
concentration products, by roasting, leaching and 
electrical deposition of the metals. 

3* Pyritic smelting followed by reduction of the matte in 
converter to blister copper. 

The third method was not tried out, as it would re¬ 
quire a study of conditions at the metallurgical plants operat¬ 
ing on a similar class of ore, and also, would require an in¬ 
stallation of a small unit at the property to demonstrate the 
feasibility of this method of treatment. 

Tests on the^ Concentration and S^naration of the Minerals.

Summary and Conclusions. 

Conclusions drawn by the Ore Dressing and 
Metallurgical Laboratories from the above tests were as follows}-. 

1. The microscopic examination of the flotation products of 
Flin Plon ore showed}- **that each of the three chief sul¬ 
phide minerals of the ore - pyrite, chalcopyrite and 
sphalerite - occur for all purposes practically free from 
any other sulphide or gangue minerals. Mich of the 
material already ranges well below 200 mesh in size, and 

it would hardly seem feasible to even consider finer grind¬ 
ing because of the prohibitive cost. 

2. ’’The assays seem to indicate that the gold and silver occur 
more or 1 ess indifferently with either the chalcopyrite, 
the zinc blende, or the pyrite. Hence flotation merely 
separates the chief sulphide minerals of the ore and leaves 



























- 32 --- 


the gold and silver almost equally disseminated in each. 

3* "The results of the flotation tests show no difficulty in 
the concentration of the chalcopyrite by preferential 
flotation after grinding to 200 mesh, A copper concentrate 
is obtained as hi^ as 15 per cent copper with a recovery 
of 85 per cent of the copper values in the o re. There is 
no reason to doubt, as far as the copper is concerned, 
that these results could be obtained in practice — The 
results show that a separation has been made of the * 
sphalerite from the pyrite and gangue. A zinc concentrate, 
40 per cent zinc, with a recovery of 50 cent of the 
zinc values, has been obtained. 

4. "The results of the roasting and leaching tests showed good 
extractions of the copper and zinc. These small tests were 
not conclusive with regard to feasibility of this process 
as applied to the o re. To obtain reliable data, tests 
would have to be conducted in a small plant over a period 
of time, so as to obtain conditions approaching practice 

( 13 ).” 

INVESTI&ATIONS BY W 0^ DRSSSINa AND METALLURGICAL LABORATORIES. 
OTTAWA , IN 1922 . 

During 1922, testing was conducted by the Ore Dress¬ 
ing and Metallurgical Laboratories, Ottawa (l4), on the concen¬ 
tration of the disseminated ore of the El in Elon ore-body. Two 
shiianents were received by the Laboratories, one of I 30 pounds

and the other of 23 O pounds. 

The puipose of the experimental work was to deter¬ 
mine if the ore was amenable to concentration, with the pro¬ 
duction of a concentrate in as coarse a fom as possible, with 
high recovery of the copper values. Pyritic smelting of the 
sulphide ore having been decided as the better practice, the 
concentrate from the disseminated ore could be mixed with it 
and bring up the grade of the furnace charge. 

Lines of Investigation . On an ore of this class 
(disseminated ore) the first line of investigation would be to 
determine if a copper concentrate could be produced by jigging, 
removing as much of the copper values as possible in a coarse 
fom. This would be followed by tabling the flotation for the 
recovery of the remaining copper values, which are more intimate¬ 
ly disseminated in the gangue, or floating off with the slimes. 

If it were found that the copper values were not 
freed by crushing to a size suitable for jigging, the ore would 
be farther reduced for table concentration, followed by regrind¬ 
ing and flotation from the table concentration of finer particles. 

If it were found that a table concentrate could not 
be obtained after crushing to a size suitable for table work, the 
next line of investigation would be to grind the ore to a fine¬ 
ness at which the copper minerals were free with the production 
of a copper concentrate by flotation.

Experimental Tests “by Jigging , 

Test by jigging made on l /4 inch material showed 
that jigging was not practicable. The concentrate obtained was 
very low in grade, consisting of all the sulphides. The tailing 
contained a large amount of unfreed copper mineral. 

Table Concentration of the Sized Material . 

The object of this test was to determine if tabling 
could be used in conjunction with flotation. 

7000 grams of ore, crushed to pass 20 mesh, was 
sized and each size was tabled separately. The results were as 
follows 5- 

- 20+28 — the separation was very poor, and no distinct 
line of sulphides was obtained. 

- 28+35 separation was no better. 

- 35 + 4 S — the separation of the sulphides showed a marked 
in^rovement on this size. The proportion of 
middling obtained was smaller. The middling was 
re-run over the table, but no s^aration cotild be 
obtained showing the product was a true middling. 
The middling was added to the tailing. 

- 48+65 — the s^aration of this size was good. Both the 

tailing and concentrate looked clean. ¥ery little 
middliz^ was obtained.

-65+100 — the s^&ration was better than in previous size* 

-100+150 •* the separation looked very good, but considerable 
float material went with the tailing* The tail¬ 
ing was re-run giving a distinct copper sulphide 
line which was practically pure chal copy rite. The 
loss of copper by flotation in tabling this size 
would be appreciable. 

-150+200 - the separation on the table was excellent. The 

sulphides separated into two lines. The sulphide 
band nearest the gangue line was distinctly higher 
in copper than the band of sulphides higher rqp on 
the table. The tailing looked very clean and free 
from sulphides, but the analysis showed that the 
tailing contained I.90 per cent copper, a low re¬ 
covery. 


notation Tests . 

The next series of tests made were by flotation. Coal 
tar oils and fuel oils were used in the first few tests. These 
were unsuccessful; nothing but a voluminous froth was obtained, 
consisting of fine flaky gangue slimes. What actually happened 
when flotation of the copper was attempted in the presence of the 
talcy gangue, was that the material being in the fom of flat thin 
flakes, presented a large surface area, and congpletely surrotmded 












36 


and adhered to the ■bubbles thus excluding the chalcopyrlte from 
the interfacial boundaries. Various reagents were tried to hold 
down these slimes and coagulate them, but with no success. It 
was found that lime had the greatest effect on the coagulation 
and settlement of the talcy material. The first test made with 
thio-fizzan in an alkaline pulp with lime gave the results as 
indicated in test No. 2. (see table No. 1.) The results were 
fairly good. 

It was apparent that the talc slime interfered with 
the flotation. Hence the following series of gravity tests were 
run to determine if the gangue could be separated from the rest 
of the ore. 

Sravitv Test . 

The ore was dry crushed to 20 mesh and tabled with¬ 
out sizing on a small laboratory wilfley table. The results of 
Test No. 3 * were,as given in Table No. 2. 

The three sand products from the table were mixed 
together and a sample weighing 1000 grams was cut out for a 
flotation test, conducted similar to Test No. 2, the results of 
which are tabulated in Table No. 1. T^st No. 3* 

The recapitulation of the complete Test No* 3* s^ows 
that a total recovery of only 75 cent of the copper was ob¬ 
tained in the concentrates assaying 11.5 per cent copper and re-

presenting I 6.5 per cent lay weight of the original ore* 

Tests ITos* 7 soldi S were made to determine if the 
talcy material could he eliminated in the tailing without ex¬ 
cessive loss of copper* It was thou^t that perhaps wet crash¬ 
ing would free this talcy gangue material better than dry crash¬ 
ing which had been tried in Test No* 3* A 1000 gram sample of 
ore was prepared by dry crushing to pass 20 mesh, then placed in 
a ball mill for five-minute period for wet crashing. The crush¬ 
ed product was, then, tabled. The results are tabulated in 
Table No* 2* 

A series of tbsts, Nos* 11, 12 and 13 were made us¬ 
ing hydraulic classification after coarse crashing to eliminate 
the slimes interfering with flotation. 1000 grams of ore - 1/4” 
were crushed in wet ball mill for 3 minutes and the sands and 
slimes of the resulting product were s^arated in a Richard classi¬ 
fier. The sands were then reground to 100 mesh for flotation and 
the separated slimes tabled. The results are recorded in Tables 
Nos. 1 and 2* 

Flotation Tests * 

The next step tried, in the concentration of the 
yiin Flon disseminated ore, was to see if better recovery could 
be obtained by the removal of talc by preliminary flotation prior 
to flotation of copper, than by gravity concentration and froth 






- 33 - 


flotatlon* 

The procedure was as follows;- the ore was crushed 
hy dry crushing in rolls to 20 mesh. A 1000 gram lot was placed 
in a small hall mill. If lime was used it was added to the hall 
mill. The pulp, of ratio of one to one, solid to water, was 

ground to the desired size product. The flotation tests were 

conducted in a Ruth laboratory machine. The results are given 
in Table No. 1. Tests Nos. 13t 21h and 22h. 

It was observed that for the same reagents and the 
same amounts of reagents the recovery and grade were not thk 
same. It was thought that’ the size of crushing had an important 

effect on the results, and a series of tests. Nos. 26, 27, 28, 29, 

31 and 33# (Table No. 1.) were made to give results of flotation 
on different size products, and with various reagents. 

A straight flotation method was tried with middling 
returned to the circuit (Test No. 36). The results are 
shown in^Table No. 3* No. 3^* 

The results show that, returning the middling to be 
mixed with the feed to the rougher cell is detrimental. The 
middling builds up in the circuit and loads the circuit up with 
froth, finally reducing the grade of the concentrate, and in¬ 
creasing the loss of copper in the tailing®

Tests Nos# 44, to 54 (Tal)le No. 1.) were made to 
detemlne the froth removing properties of the various Fumols. 

Tests of Several Engineering Compapy . 

A small sazsple of ore was sent to the General 
Bagineering Company, to dieck the restilts of the Mines Branch. 

Tests, hy the GeneraJl Engineering Coinpany, were made in a 
Callow type pneumatic machine. The results are recorded in 
Table No. 1. 

Results of Tests. 

The gravity concentration tests on the Flin Flon 
disseminated ore showed grade copper concentrate. Flotation 
tests showed that s^aration and concentration by froth flotation 
process was possible; and that a preliminary removal of talcy miner¬ 
al was necessary in order to yield high grade copper concentrates. 

As high as 85 per cent recoveries of copper were obtained, running 
as high as IS per cent copper. The copper loss in the talc froth 
running from about 5 10 per cent and in the tailings about 7 

per cent. 

The recovery in the Ruth machine ie hi^er than in 
CJallow when using strai^t flotation. A 0.25 P©!* copper 
tailing was constantly obtained in the Ruth against a O. 5 O per 
cent or higher tailing in the Callow. This is due to the fact

that in the Callow, the middling is returned continuously to the 
rougher cell (Tests Nos. ^1 and 3S). When the talc was removed 
by preliminary flotation approximately the same results were ob¬ 
tained in both machines (Tests Nos. 15 and 37'b)» 

The work of these tests showed that there were four 
possible flow sheets for the treatment of the Slin Sion ore, as 
follows j-

should be, either treated in a separate circuit or tabled 
to remove the talc before being returned to the flotation 
circuit. Slow sheet No. 1. S’igure 3*

4. Removal of the bulk of the talc by hydraulic classification 
at different points in the grinding circuit and flotation

method for treatment of the Hia yion ore# 

INVESTIGATIONS BY TIffi DENVE R LABORATORIES. COLORADO. IN 1225.. 

B3q)erimental work “by the Denver Lahoratories (I5) 
consisted of concentration and separation of the Base metals. 

Most of the work was made on the massive sulphide ore, although 
a few flotation tests were carried out on the disseminated ore. 

Lines of InveLstl£;atiQn . The nature of the massive 
sulphide ore suggested the following lines of investigation:« 

1. Direct leaching of the raw ore to recover the minerals 
of chief commercial values. 

2. Hydro-metallurgical treatment of the ore by roasting, 
leaching and electrical d^osition of the metals. 

3. Concentration of the copper and the zinc minerals by 

differential flotation resulting in products suitable for 
subsequent reduction to the metals. 

Direct Leaching . 

An attempt was made to leach the raw massive sulphide 
ore to recover the minerals of chief commercial value in the El in 
Hon ore. The 0 nly commercially available oxidizers of sulphides 
minerals that will make them soluble in sulphuric acid, are at¬ 
mospheric oxygen and ferric sulphate. It was found that the zinc 











- 42 - 


blende and the chalcopyrite dissolved hardly at all in 36 hours 
in sulphuric-acid-ferric sulphate solution, at room teaqperature. 

Hot solutions would increase the yield, but were considered 
commercially in^racticable* 

Roasting and Leaching# 

To roast an ore like the Flin Flon, containing chal¬ 
copyrite, zinc blonde and pyrite, the teaqaerature used during 
roasting •‘must be a compromise that will give a reasonable re¬ 
covery of the first two, (which in themselves should be roasted 
at different tezaperatures) without making too much of the iron 
soluble (16)». 

Two methods of leaching were triads- (1) leaching by 
percolation, and (2) leaching by countercurrent decantation. 

Leaching by percolation requires smaller volumes of 
solutions to wash out the base-metal solutions entrained in the 
calcine, yields a rich pregnant liquor, and a residue which would 
be in a suitable mechanical form for che^ treatment by cyanidation 
for recovery of precious metals. 

In a countercurrent system, water could be used for a 
neutral-leach which would take into solution the water-soluble zinc. 
Acid formed by the hydrolysis of ferric and cupric salts, 
would dissolve zinc oxides. The neutral-leach curcuit co\ild be 
made the one for the ext Action of the zinc and the acid-leach

made acid Isy addition of sulphuric acid, the one for the ex¬ 
traction of the copper. 

Boasting tests were made in the laboratory 30-inch 
MacDougall-type furnace, electrically heated. The depth of 
bed on each hearth was from 1 to 1 l/4 inches. 

The results of Boasting Test Bo. 1. (Table Bo. 4.) 
show that the amounts of the copper and the zinc soluble in 
acid would be satisfactory commercially, but not the amounts 
soluble in water. If a satisfactory amount of the zinc and the 
copper could be made water soluble, this would eliminate the 
iron, and very likely prevent some impurities, from entering 
the solution and interferiig in the extraction of the copper 
and the zinc* 

The temperatures employed in Boastii^ Test Bo« 1. was 
evidently sli^tly too hi^ to give best results for the 
copper and too low for the zinc. Test Bo» 2« was attempted to 
see if the chalwopyrite could be sulphated and removed from the 
more difficultly oxidisable zinc blende by roasting at a low 
temperaturef The results obtained are given in Table Bo. 4* 

Addition of common salt was found to lower the 
tea^erature for formation of sulphates. Three per cent of salt 
was added to fifth hearth. The results of the test show that 
addition of salt lowered the sulphide sulphur in the calcine 




- 44 - 


from about o.p por cent to 0*2 per cent, but the water-soluble 
iron was not changed appreciably (Test No. 3* Table No. 4.) 

In leaching tests, the calcine was pulped with 3 per 
cent solution of H^S0» for the acid-leach, and with water for 

2 4 

the neutral-leach. The extraction sof leaching tests are given 
in Table No. 4. 


Treatment of Residue from Leached Products . 

The leached products from the original ore left be¬ 
hind a residue that had to be treated further for precious 
metals. The precious metals were recovered by cyanidation. 

Prom 33 ^0 59 per cent of the gold and from 5c to S2 per cent 
of the silver were recovered with heads carrying O.I3 ounces of 
gold and I.3 ounces of silver per ton of ore. Better recoveries 
were obtained with acidulated brine,- (2 or 5 parts of brine 
solution to 1 of residue)carrying 1 per cent of bleaching powder 
and 0.9 per cent of sulphuric acid. This solution gave an ex¬ 
traction of 89.5 per cent of gold and 73®2 P®r cent of silver. 

On agitating for 8 hours, up to 91*7 P®r cent of gold and 80.6 
per cent of silver were recovered. 


Conclusions on Boasting and Leaching. 

As a result of the tests on roasting the following 
conclusions were drawn by the Denver Laboratories, - 7*In 
roasting the original Plin Plon ore under conditions employed, 












1 


I 




45 


it is not 'believed to be feasible to alter the copper minerals 
only so the blende may be removed* K'either is it possible to 
sulphate both the zinc and the copper to such an extent that 
water-*leaching alone may be used and the dissolving of many 
other impurities thus avoided* In so roasting the unconcen¬ 
trated Hin Hon ore for subsequent leaching with sulphuric 
acid that 'both the zinc and the copper may be made soluble to 
a satisfactory extent and yet the amount of acid-soluble iron 
may be under one per cent, the operating staff, at least, be¬ 
lieve that such a treatment is not practicable with the best 
than can be done by present roasting methods ( 17 )»“ 

It was found that in leaching by percolation, air 
pockets were foxmed and led to uneven percolation and caused 
a slow rate of percolation of the leach liquors* 

To keep a neutral-leach for the zinc and a separate 
acid-leach for the copper, it would be necessary to have a 
hi^ degree of sulphation of the zinc (and the copper). Any 
zinc which w^ not removed in the neutral-leach, would be 
picked up in the acid-leach and thus would give considerable 
difficulty in recovery of copper. 

Ibr deposition of the zinc from the neutral-leach 
and the deposition of the copper from the acid-leach, it would 
be necessary to remove the impurities. 













- 46 - 

Tests on cyanidation of the leached residue showed 
that recovery of gold and silver was possible. But before the 
cyanide was add^, the copper and the acid would have to be re¬ 
moved thoroughly in order to prevent excessive cyanide consuo:^ 
tion* 

In conclusion, it may be said that, because the ratio 
of soluble inrourities to valuable constituents in the roasted cal¬ 
cine is high, many difficulties are brou^t about and passed on to 
the other stages of the process,- leaching, solution purification 
and electrolysis,- that the scheme as a whole would cost too much 
to compete with the practice of concentration plus smelting* 

notation Concentration* 

It was, therefore, deteamined to resort to flotation 
to make copper concentrates, and zinc concentrates! these coi:^ 
centrates containing as much of the precious metals as possible. 

It was planned to t^at the tailings for their precious metal 
content, by cyanidation, if they were rich enough to justify this 
treatment* Most of the tests were made on the massive sulphide 
ore. The results of the tests are recorded in Table Ho* 1* 

SOMMABY OP FLOTATION TESTS * 

Flotation tests were principally on the flotation 
reagents to determine what reagents and the amounts wo\ild yield 
the highest recovery and grade of concentrates of the v€duable

minerals* 

Reagents for tlie Remoyal of Talc * 

The disseminated ore contains an appreciable 
amount of talcy gangue which has to be removed “by flotation 
prior to flotation of the sulphide minerals* Experimental 
tests have shown that the talcy material is readily floated 
by frothing agents* Aldol (CHj*CH( 0H)*0]^.CH0), which is a 
good frothing, non-collecting agent, yielded a 5*7 per cent 
copper loss and O.g per cent copper in the talc froth* 

Various fumols were tried* Fcmol No* 21*, with 
4 pounds of soda ash yielded a 4*9 per cent copper loss in the 
talc froth* The same amount of fumol Ho* 21* with 6 pounds 
lime increased the copper in the talc froth from *90 per cent 
to 3*20 per cent, and the copper loss from 4*9 per cent to 
46.1 per cent* 

Various fumols have been tried; most of th®n yield¬ 
ing hi^ copper values and losses in the talc froth* Only 
fumols Hos* 20 and 21 in pulps containing soda ash and fumol 
No* 25 in pulp containing lime yielded a low loss of copper of 
about 5 per cent in the talc froth, but fumol No* 20 yielded a 
relatively high copper value* 

The General Engineering OoBQ>any atteo^ted to renove 
the talc by frothing it with pins oil* *05 pounds of pine

oil yielded a talc froth, running o*45 per cent copper, a loss 
of 3*2 per cent. Pine oil gave the lowest copper loss in the 
talc froth and was adopted as the talc removal in the flotation 
practice for the Plin Plon ore. 

Reagents for the Recovery of the Conner Minerals . 

Lime was added to the hall-^mill to give alkalinity 
to the pulp. Varying amounts of the lime were added, ranging 
from 2 pounds to 40 pounds per tone of ore. In some tests, the 
amount of the lime added was very small. This was due to the 
fact that the water from the tailings, which was still alkaline, 
was used agciin in the flotation circuit; as in the case of the 
tests hy the Denver Laboratories. 

Decreasing the lime from 40 pounds to 24 pounds, 
with 5 pounds of x-y reagent (4"parts x-*cake, 6 parts xylidin), 
concentrates increased from l4.2 to 16.7 cent copper, and 
the recovery of copper increased fnam cent to 67*9 P®^ 

cent. Tlie zinc content in the copper concentrate did not change, 
but the copper loss in the zinc concentrate increased from 7«7 
per cent to 10.6 per cent. Igi decreasing the x-y reagent to 
0.3 pounds and lime to l6 pounds, a higher grade of copper con¬ 
centrate was obtained, running 17*4 per cent copper and S7.4 per 
cent recovery, and the loss of the zinc in the copper concentrates 
was decreased from 10.6 per cent to 7.4 per cent. By decreasing

the x-y reagent 0,3 pounds the silver value in the copper con¬ 
centrates increased to 2,64 ounces per ton of ore. The silver 
value increased in the copper concentrate with the decrease of 
lime from 1.32> to 2.l4 ounces silver per ton of ore. If it is 
desired to recover the precious metals from the ore, with the 
copper concentrates, the amount of the lime added to the ball- 
mill will have to be low. 

The Greneral Engineering Company used x-cake 
(naphthylamine a) as a collecting agent, and Wattson^s residue, 
as a frothing agent, for the copper minerals. With 0.1 pounds 
of x-cake, 4 pounds of Wattson^s residue (equivalent to 0.6 pounds 
of oil) and l4 pounds of lime, a recovery of 83.1 per cent copper 
was obtaiiBd, but the grade of the concentrates was much lower 
than with x-y reagent, being only 8.00 per cent copper. By in¬ 
creasing the x-cake to 0.15 pounds and Wattson*s residue to 6 
pounds, the recovery didnH change, but the grade of the copper 
concentrates decreased to 6.70 P© 3 C* cent while the zinc increased 
from 5*6 to 7®2 per c^t. 

Tenth of a pound of thio-fizzan with 2 pounds lime 
yielded an average of 17*0 per cent copper and an average recovery 
of 82.6 per cent of copper concentrates from the disseminated ore. 
Increasing the thio-fizzan to O .25 pounds and the Ihne to 8 
pounds, increased the grade of the copper concentrate to 18.68 per 
cent copper, Imt the recovery decreased to 76.0 per cent.

- 50 - 

0.15 pounds Tf mixture (thiooarbanllid dls solved 
in ortlio««toluidin, 1|4), which is a collecting agent, with 6 pounds 
lime gave a recovery of S0»9 por cent and 18*8 per cent copper 
in the copper concwitrate* The same amount of TT mixture with 
4 pounds soda ash yielded, practically, the same copper concentrate, 
hut a lower recovery (74*9 por cent)* As the cost of the soda 
ash is higher than that of the lime, and the lime, hesides giving 
alkalinity to the pulp, acts as a depressant for the pyrite, the 
lime was adopted as the conditioning reag^t* Increase of the TT 
mixture to 4 pounds, the lime to 8 pounds and using Udol as a 
frother, the grade of copper concentrate decreased to l4»7 psv 
cent* 

The Denver Laboratories, for the concentration of 
the sulpMde ore, with 4 pounds of lime, 1 pound of soda a^ 2 
pounds sodium sulphite, 0*10 pound sodium x^thate smd 2 dr^s of 
pine oil, obtained a concentrate of 17»0 per cent copper, a recovexy 
of 7^*6 per cent, and a sine loss of 6*0 per cent in the copper con« 
cent rate* decreasing the lime to 2*7 pounds and increasing the 

sodius xanthate to 0»20 pounds and emitting the soda ash and sodium 
sulxdiite, but tsing 1«2 pounds sodium chloride (assumed to act on the 
talc, giving a cleaner copp^ concentrate), a copper recovery of 
81*9 pox' cant coiner concmitrate was obtained, zunning 17*0 per 
cent copper, per cent zinc, and,a zinc loss in the copper

concentrates of 9.0 per cent. 

The above reagents yielded satisfactory results 
and were adopted as standard for subsequent flotations* 

Reagents for the Recovery of the Zinc Minerals . 

Recovery of the zinc minerals, in the Plin Plon 
sulphide ore, was first tried by the Ore Dressing and Metallurgi¬ 
cal Laboratories, Ottawa* 40 pounds of lime added to the ball- 
mill, 10 pounds soda ash, 1 pound gravity fuel oil No* yield¬ 
ed a low recovery of the zinc. It was thought that by dewatering 
the copper tailings, the sli^t depressing effect of the lime on 
the zinc blende may be somewhat eliminated. In the subsequent 
tests the copper tailings were dewatered. The same amount of 
lime and gravity fuel oil No. 3^9 ^ pounds soda ash, increased the 
grade of the zinc concentrate from 29.0 per cent to 3^»5 per cent, 
and the zinc recovery from 44.1 per cent to 5^*3 per cent, when 
the copper tailings were dewatered. The copper loss in the zinc 
concentrate increased from 3*3 per cent to S.4 per cent. 

Sy decreasing the lime to 24 pounds, and addition of 
8 pounds of soda ash, 3 pounds of Wattson^s residue 1~B, 1 pound 
copper sulphate (activator for the zinc blende), the grade of the 
zinc concentrate increased to 40.7 per cent, but the recovery de¬ 
creased to 52*5 por cent, and the loss of 21.8 per cent zinc in 












- 52 - 


the tailings. By further decrease of lime to 20. pounds in the 
■ball-mill, and addition of 5 pounds of lime, 8 pounds soda ash, 

1 pound fuel oil, an increase of 3*S per cent zinc was o'btained, 
"but the recovery decreased “by 10 per cent approximately. Ten 
pounds of caustic soda substituted for 5 pounds of lime decreased 
both the grade of the zinc concentrates and the recovery; increas¬ 
ing the zinc loss in the tailings to 24.8 per cent. 

The General Engineering Company obtained a 60*3 per 
cent zinc recovery, using l4 pounds of lime in the ball-mill, 6 
pounds of sulphuric acid, 6.5 pounds Wattson^s residue, 1 pound 
G.B. Co. No. 209 and 0.1 pound G.E. Co. No. 56| By decrea^sing 
the Watt son >s residue to 0.75 pound and leaving out the sulphuric 
acid, the zinc recovery decreased to 5^*2 P®3r cent. 

The Denver Laboratories, using 2 pounds of soda ash, 

1 pound solium sulphite, 1 pound of copper sulphate, 0.10 pound 
xanthate and 1 drop of cresylic acid as frother, obtained a fair¬ 
ly high zinc concentrate (43.5 cent), a recovery of 7^.5 pe^^ 
cent. By substituting 0.5 pound of lime for soda ash and increas¬ 
ing the copper sulphate to 1.6 pounds and xanthate to 0.24 pounds, 
the grade of the zinc concentrate increased to 46.0 per cent and 
the zinc loss in the tailing decreased from 15*5 to 10.5 per cent.

were not feasible for the concentration of the Flin Floa sul¬ 
phide ore, and the concentration by flotation gave satisfactory 
recovery of both the copper and the zinc, it was considered that 
flotation concentration was the only commercially feasible method 
which could be ec^loyed. 

Before any definite conclusions could be drawn as 
to possible consnercial suceess of the concentration, larger scale 
operations were required* 

EXPERIMENTAL TWO-TON PLANT (IS). 

To confirm the results of the laboratory experiments 
on flotation a small pilot plant with a capacity of two tons per 
day was erected at the laboratories in Denver, based on flow sheet 
shown in Figure 6. 

On July 1st, 1926 , several carloads of the Flin Flon 
ore were received, and the plant was put in operation. Diffi¬ 
culties were immediately encountered due to the hi^ specific gravity 
of the ore, maiding it necessary to add so much water to keep the 
pulp flowing in the launders and flotation machine passages that 
the flotation circuit became too dilute to give good results. The 
circuit was rebuilt to conform to the flow sheet shown in Figure 7, 
and after these changes were made, good results were obtained* 

(See Table No. 1. Test No. 1. by Denver Laboratories).

The tailings from the two-ton mill were treated in 
a small cyanidation plant for the recovery of gold and silver. 

2‘5-TON FLOTATION PLANT AND IQ-TON CYANIDE PLANT . 

The results obtained from the 2-Ton plant showed that 
Flin Flon ore could he concentrated l^y flotation processes for the 
recovery of copper and zinc; and that precious metals, not picked 
vtp in these circuits could he recovered hy subsequent cyanidation 
of the tailings from the zinc circuit. On August 1st, 1926, it 
was decided to install a 25 ‘*Ton flotation plant at the mine, based 
on the flow sheet Figure 2, with a 10-Ton cyanide plant for treat¬ 
ing the flotation tailings. The mill was continuously in opera¬ 
tion from March 22nd, to 31st, 1927f The average of the results 
obtained are shown in Table No. 1, (Flotation tests 25-Ton P21ot 
Mill). 

Although the results showed a low extraction of the 
copper and low grade of the copper concentrates they were consider¬ 
ed fair in view of the small amount of the copper in the feed. 

These results were obtained on the massive sulphide 
ores, but as mining proceeded, disseminated ore was encountered. 

The talcy mineral in the disseminated ore gave a low grade copper 
concentrate and a low recovery of the copper, due to the talcy 
mineral floating off in the copper concentrate cells along with 
the copper. The zinc section was not greatly affected. 










- 55 - 


Mine development, at that sta^e, indicated that a 
close separation could not he made between the disseminated talcy 
ore and the massive sulphide ore in the mine. The flotation work 
showed that even a small amount of the talc (as the talcy mineral 
was called) would seriously interfere with the treatment of the 
sulphide ore. 

The talcy mineral has the property of absorbing a 
certain part of the oils euid reagents in considerable amounts, 
so that the promoter effect of the xanthate is largely overcome, 
unless a large amount is used, and hence there is little selective 
action between the chalcopyrite and the pyrite. 

Tests were again started both in the laboratory and 
in the mill in order to devise a process to, either overcome the 
effect of the talc or remove it before the regular flotation 
treatment. 

Test results showed that it was ia^jossible to over» 
come the absorbing effect of the talc by using starch in a neutral 
or acid circuit. Also, it was practically impossible to maintain 
exactly right alkalinity and add the exact amount to the mill 
when the character of the feed varied. The use of starch was dis« 
continued and a talc flotation substitued. A large percentage of 
the talc was removed in a ldv/-»grade product by adding pine oil to 
the alkaline pulp and floating the talc. The flow sheet of the 

pilot mill was changed to accommodate the talc removal as shown

in flow sheet, Figure 9* 

By removing the clean concentrates from the first 
two rougher cells in each circuit a "better extraction was obtain¬ 
ed,- «as the coarse mineral that floated in these cells was re¬ 
luctant to float again when sent to a cleaner, and it was found 
that the concentrates from these roughers were of better grade 
than the concentrates fomerly produced when all the froth was 
cleaned (19)”. By returning the middling froth and cleaner 
tailings to the third rougher cell, a higher grade zinc concen¬ 
trate was obtained than by returning to the original feed of the 
zinc circuit. Regrinding the zinc middlings lowered the tailings 
about 0*2 per cent zinc. 

On September 1st, 1927, a mixture of disseminated 
and sulphide ores was fed to the mill. IDhe results given in 
Table No. 1* were obtained for a considerable time. Disssninated 
ore alone was treated giving satisfactory recovery of the copper 
and grade of concentrates. (See Table No. 1.) 

The mill was operated until March 10th, 192S, treat¬ 
ing ore from various parts of the mine, and trying various changes 
in the flow sheets, reagents, etc., but it was found that the re¬ 
agents and flow sheet of September 1st, 1927, gave the best re¬ 
sults on both classes of ore* The Minerstl Separation talc cells 
were substituted for the Fagergren machine, due to lower maint^- 
ance cost and the advantage of having all cells of one type.

SUIvlMARY OF RESULTS OF 2^~T0N PILOT MIH.. 

The 25 -Ton mill, operatii^ contimiously for a con¬ 
siderable period, treating a mixture of sulphide ore and dissemin¬ 
ated ore, yielded a copper concentrate of l4.2S per cent copper, 
a recovery of 72*5 cent. The copper loss was 15«7 per cent 
in the talc froth and tailings, and 11*8 per cent in the zinc con¬ 
centrate. The zinc concentrate obtained ran 43*2 per cent zinc, 
a recovery of SI .6 per cent. The zinc loss was 6 .S per cent in 
the copper concentrate, and 11.6 per cent in the talc froth and 
tailings. , Almost half the gold and over one-third of the silver 
was removed with the copper concentrates* but 40.7 per cent of 
the gold and 45*1 per cent of the silver remained in the talc 
froth and the tailings. 

A continuous separation and concent station of the 
disseminated ore yielded a copper concentrate of IS.O per cent 
copper, a recovery of Sl»2 per cent; but 33-9 per cent of the 
zinc floated with the copper froth. Uo recovery of the zinc was 
made. The gold in the talc froth and tailings was 29.3 per cent, 
being appreciably less than for the mixture of sulphide and dis¬ 
seminated ores. The silver in the talc froth and tailings was 
43.7 per cent.

As the results of the work at the 25 -Ton pilot mill.

the following reqairements would have to he considered in order 
that the flotation operations would yield satisfactory results 3 - 

!• Pine grinding to liberate the mineral particles; avoid¬ 
ing too excessive sliming. (85 per cent - 200 mesh - 
65 per cent - ^00 mesh)* 

2. Removal of sufficient talc; the amount depending on the 
feed. 

3* Careful control of alkalinity throu^out the circuit. 

(PH of 9.0 to 9.4 in the copper circuit; 11.6 in the 
zinc rougher circuit). 

4. Proper pulp density in the flotation circuit, adding 
as little fresh water as possible to the circuit after 
the pulp leaves the classifier. (I .3 specific gravity 
or 30 solids). 

5* Proper time of conditioning after adding reagents. 

(Prom 3*5 ‘to 4 minutes at least ahead of the zinc float). 

Various other reagents were tried, but the reagents 
of September 1st, 1927, gave the best results on both types of 
ore. 

An atteoq)t was made to refloat the zinc tailings in 
an acid circuit and obtain a concentration of gold which would 
eliminate the cyanide plant, but this was unsuccessful.

THE •^OQO-TOIJ MILL> 

following the 25 -Ton pilot mill, it had heon de¬ 
finitely proven, that the concentration for the copper and the 
zinc;and the cyanidation for the precious metals in "both types 
of riin Hon ore, was commercially feasible* Designing and con¬ 
struction of a 3000 “*ton capacity mill was immediately started. 

A detailed description of the 3^00-ton mill was given in C*1.M* & U- 
Bulletin, Ho. 221, September, 193^, Concentration and Cyanidation 
at Elin Hon Pilot Mill. 

The flow sheit. Figure 10, will give some idea of 

the mill. 

This mill was put into operation gradually in June, 
24 th, 1930t coming into full production in Hovonber 19 th, 1930* 
and has operated continuously since that time. 

SIMilARY AHB CONCLUSIONS OF PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTAL WORK * 

The experimental tests, conducted by the Ore Dressing 
and Metallurgical Laboratories, Ottawa, the General Engineering 
Coinpany, and the Denver Laboratories, show that the only commer¬ 
cially feasible method of concentrating the Flin Flon ore is by 
froth flotation. Boasting and leaching cannot be commercially em¬ 
ployed because the ratio of soluble impurities to valuable constit¬ 
uents in the roasted calcine is high. The in^rities bring up and

pass on majiy difficulties to the other stages of the process,- 
leaching, solution purification and electrolysis,- that the 
scheme as a whole would cost too much to compete with the 
practice of concentration hy flotation followed hy subsequent 
smelting* 

Pyritic smelting cannot be en^loyed as the ore 
consists of two types,- the massive sulphide and the disseminat¬ 
ed. The latter is too low in sulphide minerals for direct 
smelting practice* 

Jigging and table concentration of disseminated ore 
gave low recovery of the valuable minereJ.s* Considerable copper 
went as slimes along with the tailings. 

Concentration by flotation gave satisfactory recovery 
of the copper and the zinc for both types of ore; and was thought 
to be the only commercially feasible method which could be en- 
ployed. 

Experimental tests on the concentration of the Flin 
Flon disseminated ore by flotation indicated that the talcy mineral 
would have to be removed before the copper and the zinc minerals 
were recovered. The talcy gangae is readily floated by frothing 
.agents. The frothing agent must be non-^collecting in order that 
the sulphide minerals would not be floated with the talc froth. 
Pine oil, used for the ronoval of talc, yielded a low copper loss

in the talc froth. In the 25-ton pilot mill, using pine oil, 
a froth was obtained running 0.4 per cent copper, O .76 per 
cent zinc, a copper loss of 3*7 per cent and a zinc loss of 
per cent. Several fumols have been tried, but the results 
were not as satisfactory ae those obtained with pine oil or 
Aldol. Pine oil gave the lowlist copper loss in the talc froth 
and was adopted as the talc removal at the Slin Plon concentrater» 
Varying amounts of lime were added to the ball*«mill. 

It was found that the amount of lime required was that amount 
which would give a hydrogen ion concentrate of 3»Q to In the 
copper circuit. Higher alkalinity of the pulp in the zinc cir¬ 
cuit was necessary. A pH of about 11.4 was maintained in the 
zinc circuit by addition of lime. 

Lime has a slight depressing effect on the chalcopy- 
rite minerals. A decrease of lime from 40 pounds to 24 pounds 
increased the grade of copper concentrate from l4.2 per cent to 
16.7 per cent copper and the recovery from 7^»5 P©!* cent to S7*9 
per cent. A decrease in the lime increased the silver values. 

A better recovery of the precious metals in the copper 
concentrates was obtained with x«cake than with x-y reagent. As 
hi^ as 4.5 ounces of silver and 0.26 ounces of gold per ton of 
copper concentrates was obtained* but the x-cake yielded a lower 
grade of copper concentrates* 










- 62 - 


Thiowfizzan was used for copper recovery in the 
concentration of the disseminated ore* Increasing the thio- 
fizzan from 0.10 pound to 0*25 pound smd the lime from 2 to 
8 pounds increased the copper concentrates from 17*0 to 18.68 
per cent copper, hut the recovery decreased fi^m 82*6 to 76.0 
per cent. O .15 pound of TT mixture yielded practically the 
same grade of copper concentrates as the thio-fizzan, hut the 
recovery was higher. 

Sodium sulphite, used as a depressant for zinc, 
yielded a sine loss of 6.0^ in the copper concentrates. Zinc 
sulphate suhstituhed for sodium sulphite yielded practically 
the same zinc loss.“' . 

A continuous operation of several days treating a 
mixture of heavy sulphide ore and diss^ninated ore, with 2.02 
pounds lime, 2.00 pounds of zinc sulphate added to the hallnnill, 
0.063 pound pine oil added to talc cells, O .09 pound xanthate 
to copper cells, yielded 14.28 per cent copper, and 4.1 per cent 
zinc in the copper concentrate, a recovery of 72.5 por cent 
copper. 49*6 per cent of the gold and 35»5 pe^r- cent of the 
silver was recovered with the copper concentrates. The same 
reagents used in treating a disseminated ore, yielded IS.C per 
cent copper concentrate, a recovery of 31*2 per cent; JO*66 per 
cent of the gold and 3^*2J per cent of the silver was recovered

with this concentrate

Dewatering the copper tailings for zinc flotation 
increased the zinc in the concentra.tes from 29 .C to 36*5 per cent 
and the recovery from 44.1 to 52*3 cent. 

Various reagents have been tried in the zinc circuit. 

It has been found that copper sulphate (activator for zinc 
minerals) yielded the best results. Mdition of 0.74 pound 
copper sulphate, 2.00 pounds lime, O .15 pound cresylic acid, 

0.12 pound xanthate to zinc rougher cells, and O.IS pound 
copper sulphate, 0.55 pound lime to zinc cleaner cells yielded 
a concentrate of 43»2 per cent zinc, a recovery of 81.6 per cent, 
and a loss of 11.6 per cent zinc in the tailings. 

The following reagents,- 2.02 pounds lime, 2.00 
pounds zinc sulphate added to the ballHnill; O.O 63 pound pine 
oil to talc cells; O.O 9 pound aerofloat, 2.S1 pounds sodium 
chlorite, 0.04 pound xanthate to copper cells; 0.74 pound copper 
sulphate, 2.00 pounds lime, O.I 5 pound cresylic acid, 0.12 
pound xanthate to zinc rougher cells; 0.18 pound copper sulphate, 
0.55 pound lime to zinc cleaner cells yielded a satisfactory 
recovery of the base metals and the precious metals during a 
continuous operation in a 25-Ton Pilot Mill and were adopted 
as standard flotation reagents at the Hin Plon mill.

mill practice on copper-zinc flotations where the copper mineral 
is chalcopyrite and the zinc mineral is zinc blende*

It is apparent that the reagent consuiaption is excessive 
and should be open to considerable improvement. 

Grade of concentrates and recoveries obtained at the 
plants, reported in Table No® 6*, are given in Table No® J* 

This table shows clearly that the concentration pro¬ 
cedure at Flin Hon, even with the excessive reagent consumption, 
is not all that could be desired* 

The copper concentrate produced carries only a little 
better than l 4 per cent copper while good average practice should 
yield at least 20 per c 4 nt • l 4 per cent concentrate, undoubted¬ 
ly, is expensive to smelt, as the large amounts of inpurities will

greatly increase the fuel and flux requirements, besides, in¬ 
creasing handling costs and reducing furnace capacities. More¬ 
over a copper recovery of only 72.5 p0r cent presents a consid¬ 
erable waste in an ore which is lean in copper at any time. 

The zinc concentrate produced, carries over 43 per 
cent zinc; this may be considered a reasonably high grade con¬ 
centrate, Recovery of zinc in the concentrate, however, amounts 
to only SI ,6 per cent, the balance going to the copper concen¬ 
trate, the talc froth, and the tailings, with the majority 
( 11.6 per cent) in the last two mentioned products. This is 
more th^ twice that reported at the other plants listed in 
Table No. 7 * 

GdB. and silver recoveries in the copper concentrate 
are low. Only 49.6 per cent of the gold and 35*5 of 

the silver are recovered as con^ared to SO.C per cent of the gold 
and S 9.0 per cent of the silver at Rouyn, and J 3*0 per c@at of 
the gold and the silver at imulet. Over 40 per cent of the 
gold and silver present inthe ore at Flin Flon is lost to the 
tailings. To recover some of this, the tailings from the heavy 
sulphide section is treated by cyanidation, but precious metal 
values in the talc froth and in the tailings of the disseminated 
ore section are an acc^ted loss in the mill practice.

It is thus apparent that the flotation practice at 
the yiin Flon mill, if based on the 25 -Ton Pilot plant operations, 
is open to considerable improvement* 

Possibilities of Improvement * 

The flotation operation developed by the laboratory 
and pilot plant operations is a straight selective or differential 
flotation process with a four stage separation,- talc - copper - 
zinc and tailings* 

There is one very definite alternative scheme possible, 
namely, a so-called bulk flotation, in which the sulphides are 
floated from the gangue minerals in a single operation and then 
the bulk concentrates treated by selective or differential flota^ 
tion for the separate minerals. By such a scheme, the mixed or© 
(sulphides and disseminated ores) would be subjected to a roijgh 
concentration whereby the copper, zinc and iron minerals woiild 
be separated from the gangu© minerals and thus could be arranged 
to yield a tailings (the gangue minerals) with minhmam metal values. 
This would be the final waste product of the mill; all other in- 
temediary products being sent back into concentration* The re¬ 
latively low grad© sulphide concentrate would be treated separate¬ 
ly by selective flotation to yield copper, zinc, and iron concen¬ 


trates 







- 6S - 


In this scheme of operation there are two possible 

ways to handle the talc fro m the disseminated ore;- (1) allow 

and 

it to collect with the hulk float concentrate/removed subse¬ 
quently, or (2) make a preliminary talc separation prior to 
bulk float of the sulphides* 

There are several apparent advantages from bulk 

flotation; 

1* The first operations are solely to make a clean tailings,- 
i.e*, one with minimum of metal values* Total recoveries 
would be immediately controllable by this operation and 
should tend to much higher recoveries of the metal values 
of the ore. . 

2, Raooval of from 25 to 50 per cent of the ore as clean 
tailings should result in considerable reduction in re¬ 
agent consumption, as the less bulk of material to be 
treated will require less total reagents to make the 
selective flotation concentrates* 

3* All metal values sire kept in circulation in the clean¬ 
ing circuits until such time as they report to one or 
other of the concentrates. Hence the grade of the con¬ 
centrates produced should be controllable within close 
limits* 

With these apparent improvements as a possible result

of bulk flotation operations, it was decided that some investi¬ 
gation on the suitability of the scheme was warranted. Three 
hundred pounds of the Flin Flon ore were obtained and from the 
mill* As received, this consisted of fine ore bin material, and 
was SLlmost entirely disseminated ore* 

Procedure * 

Any investigation on flotation involve the study of 
the effects of variations in a very large number of factors, any 
one of which may materially alter the efficiencies of the opera¬ 
tions. Exact coniparison of results of experiments are only 
possible when all conditions are, as nearly as possible, the same 
for each set of experiments. It is, therefore, impossible to 
coir5)are or correlate different experimental results unless the 
ore used comes from the same shipment, the water comes from the 
same source, and the reagents used are of the same origin. Under 
these conditions con^arison of bulk flotation experiments could 
only be made with selective flotation experiments, done on the 
same materials and under, as approximately as possible, the same 
conditions* 

Td check the results of bulk flotation, therefore, it 
was necessary to establish the efficiency of the selective flota¬ 
tion operation in the same laboratory* 

The present investigations, therefore, had to be divide

into two parts* 

1. Extensive selective flotation experiments, using 
essentially the reagents developed in the pilot 
mill operations, to determine the University of 
Alherta laboratory equivadent of the pilot mill 
operations; or at least to establish maximum re¬ 
covery conditions for the laboratory when operat¬ 
ing on the particular sample of ore obtained. 

2« To develop a bulk flotation procedure which would 
be con^arable with the selective flotation results 
obtained inthe laboratory. 

Direct comparison of the results of these two series 
of experiments on a recovery-cost basis should indicate the 
possible savings, if any, obtainable by the use of bulk flota¬ 
tion operations. 

Equinment . 

Ore as received at the laboratory was crushed in 
a 4” X 6” Dodge type laboratory Jaw Breaker (Figure 11.) to 
3/S”, and re-crushed in an Allis Chalmers sample grinder 
(Figure 12.) to 2S mesh Tyler. It was then stored in air-tight 
cans until required for experimented purposes. Orinding prior

CHAPTER 5.* 


METHODS OP CHEMICAL ANALYSES 

The products obtained, from the experimental woik on 
the concentration of the Plin Plon ore by froth flotation, were 
talc froth, copper concentrates, zinc concentrates, iron con¬ 
centrates and tailings* The materials determined in each pro¬ 
duct were, copper, zinc, iron and insolubles. Also gold and 
silver values were determined in some flotation products. 

Analyses for each product were made in duplicates. 

Analysis for Cont)er by Potassium Iodide Method # 

This method depends upon the fact that cupric salts 
when treated with potassium iodide libera,te iodine. The reaction 
is as follows 

2 CuSOi^ + 4 KI ” 2CttI + 2 + Ig 

The liberated iodine is titrated with standard thiosulphate 
solution. 

2 Na^S 0 +21= Na a 0^ + 2 Nal 

2 2 3 2 4 6 

When the free iodine has entirely vanished, the blue color 
(produced by starch with free iodine) will change to white, 
which is the end-point. 

The method used in the deteimination of copper in

the flotation products was the "Short Iodide Method (22)". 

This method is based on the repression of ionization of iron 
by the addition of sodium fluoride to an acetic acid solution 
containing the ferric salt. The iron fluoride, fonned 

does not react with KI. As, Bi, Cd, Co, Fe, Hg, Mn, Mo, 

Ni, Pb, Sn, U, Zn, do not interfere. Cr foms an insoluble 
sulphate, which holds Cu; hence £^^4 avoided when 

Cr is present. Vanadium interferes and when present, this 
method cannot be used. 

This method was adopted for the determination of the 
copper in the flotation test products because it is a very 
rapid method and gives most accurate results and is most pract¬ 
ical. A.H. Low, when speaJdlng of electrolytic method, and 
iodide method for copper determination, states,- "I, therefore, 
give the iodide, method the preference in most cases as being 
more practical and nearly if not quite as accurate as the 
electrolytic at its best ( 23 )”« 

Standard Solutions and Staadardization . Sodium thio¬ 
sulphate solution was made by dissolving 19.5 • grams of salt 
in 1 litre of distilled water. The solution was kept in the dark 
when not being used, to prevent changing in strength. 

To standardize the thiosulphate solution, 0.2 grams of

copper foil was weighed, placed in a heaicer and dissolved 


in 10 c.c. of 1:1 HNO^* The mixture was then diluted to 
25 c.c*, hoiled till red fumes ceased to come off, removed 
and diluted to 75 c*c** added till just aUcaline, and 

acetic acid added till solution was acid* The solution was 
then cooled and 15 c.c. of KI solution added (I gm.il in 5 
c.c* of water). The mixture was titrated till yellow color 
of free iodine was nearly gone and then 5 c.c. of starch 
solution added; then titrated again till "blue color of starch 
iodide disappeared* The thiosulphate solution was standardiz¬ 
ed before usiizg* 

Stardi solution was made by stirrizig 5 grams of 
stardi in to 200 c.c* of cold distilled water. It was then 
poured into 800 c.c* of boiling water and boiled until clear. 
10 grams of KaCl was added to prevent the starch from chang¬ 
ing and will thus keep indefinitely. The solution was allow¬ 
ed to settle and the clear liquid poured off for use* 


Procedure for Couoer Determination* A 0*5 gram sample 
was weighed into a 25O c.c* beaker, decoagjosed with I5 c.c* fiCl, 
5 c.c* HUO^ and a little KCIO^. When the reaction ceased 5 c.c. 
of HgSOj^ was added and fumed on a hot plate practically to dry¬ 
ness. The solution was then cooled, 10 c*c* of water and 2*c*c*

of ‘bromine water added, and ‘boiled to expell excess ‘bromine. 

While the solution was still hot, 20 - 25 c.c* of 
ammonlnm acetate was added to precipitate all iron as 
PeCC^H^Og)^ and 2 to 5 grams of solid (till red color 

changed to ‘bluish green or white). The mixture was then cool¬ 
ed and when cold 15 c.c® of KI solution was added and titrated 
with standard sodinm thiosulphate solution, using starch as 
indicator* 

Analysis for Iron and In8olu‘ble8 ‘by ^^Permanganate Method (22) 

The method depends upon the quantitative oxidation 
of ferrous salts to the ferric condition when potassium perman¬ 
ganate is added to their cold solution; the following reaction 
taking place; 

10 FeSOi^ + 2 KMnO^ + S H^SO^ = 5 ^2^4 * 

2 MnS0[^ + S HgQ. 

Potassiiam permanganate produces an intense pink color 
in solution, so that it acts as its own indicator* 

Reasons for choice of this method were that it gave 
rapid determinations, sharp and point, and accurate results. 

Standard Solutions and StandardizatAion . Potassium 
permanganate solution was made ‘by dissolving 5®26 grams of 
crystals in one litre of distilled water. The solution was 
kept in a colored ‘bottle to prevent decou^osition.

To standardize the permanganate solution, o*2 grams 
of sodixam oxalate was dissolved in 25O c,c« of water. To the 
solution 10 c,c« of H^SO^ was added and heated to JO* C. The 
solution was titrate hot to permanent pink tinge. 

Procedure for Iron and Insolubles Determinations. A 
0.5 gram sample was weighed into 25O c.c. beaker, 2 c.c. of water 
and 10 c.c* HCl added. When reaction ceased 5 c.c. HNO^ was added 
and boiled till brown fumes ceased. The solution was then cooled 
and when cold 10 c.c. of 1.1 B^SO^ was added and fumed strongly 
to white fumes. The sac^le was then coaled, 10 c.c. of water 
added, boiled to dissolve sulphates, filtered (while hot) and 
washed 5 or 6 timeswith hot distilled water. 

The residue was i^ited for insolubles. 

To the filtrate a strip of aluminum was added and 
boiled to reduce the ferric sulphate to ferrous sulphate. When 
the solution was coloress it was cooled and the altiminum strips 
washed, the solution filtered was then diluted to 25O c.c. and 
treated with standard potassiiam permanganate solution. The first 
permanent pink tinge was taken as the end-point. 

Analysis for Zinc by Ferro cyanide Method # 

The method used for the determination of zinc in the 

flotation products was slightly modified from the ’’regular method”

as outlined “by A* H# Low (24). 

This method depends upon the zinc precipitation by 
potassium ferrocyanide from acid solutions as insoluble zinc 
potassium feriucyanide* 

3 ZnClg + 2 ,*• KgZn^CMCll)^)^ + 6 KOI. 

Althou^ the procedure is not very short and rapid, 
it was adopted because of the fair degree of accuracy of results, 
if proper procedure is followed. Low values may result when 
iron, prepipitated as ferric hydroxide, is in very large quanti¬ 
ties* In this case some zinc may be retained inthe precipitate; 
but, thorough washing with hot ammoniacal chloride wash water, 
will ranove the zinc almost con^letely* 

Standard Solutionsand Standardization* Potassium 
ferrocyanide solution was made by dissolving 21*54 grams of 
salt in 1 litre of distilled water* 

To standardize the potassium ferrocyanide solution, 

0*2 gram of pure zinc was weighed, placed in 400 c*c. beaker, 
and dissolved in 10 c*c* of cone. HCl and diluted with 25 c*c* 
of water* When all the zinc dissolved, the solution was meuie 
basic with acidic with HCl, and 3 of acid added in 

excess* 

The solution was then diluted to 200 c.c. with hot

water and heated nearly to hoiling. The hot solution was divid¬ 
ed into two portions. One portion was titrated with ferrocyeuiide 
solution^ running few cubic centimeters at a time, tested on a 
porcelain plateto brown tinge,using urani\M nitrate as outside 
indicator. A greater part of the second portion was then added 
and titrated more cautiously till end-point was again passed. 
Finally, the last portion was added, the beaker rinsed with a 
large portion of the solution. From this point the titration 
was cofflpleted very carefully, testing after each addition of two 
drops, to end-point. 

The amount of ferrocyanide solution required to pro¬ 
duce a color change under similar conditions when no zinc is 
present, was detemined, and the correction applied. 

Uranium nitrate solution was made by dissolving 1 
gram of salt in 10 c.c. of water. 

Procedure for Zinc Determination. A O.5 gfam sazaple 
was weighed into a 400 c.c. beaker, and 10 c.c® of water, 10 c.c. 
HNO^, and 3 grams of KCIO^ were added. In 5 minutes 10 c.c. HCl 
were suided and the mixture heated at low temperature. To the 
mixture 10 c.c. of Isl was then added and the mixture 

evaporated to dryness. The residue was then cooled and taken up 
with 35 to 50 c.c. of ammoniacal solution (200 grams of KH4CI in 













- 79 - 


500 c.c. cone* Kf^OH and 750 c*c* H^O), Trolled a minute or two, 

bromine water added and the mixture boiled a short time to ex- 

pell the excess bromine. The solution was then filtered hot and 

washed ten times with hot ammonium chloride mixture (100 grams 

IIH^CI in 1 litre of water and 50 c.c» cone. NH^OH). 

The filtrate was neutralized with HCl and 3 c.c. of 

acid added in excess, hydrogen sulph^e was then passed into 

the filtrate to precipitate the copper. Copper was filtered 

out and the filtrate diluted to 200 c.c. with hot water and 

heated nearly to boiling. The procedure from this point to 

the 

the end was similar to/titration procedure for standardization 
of standard potassium ferrosyanide solution. 

Precious Metals Peterminations . 

Gold and silver in the flotation products Yfevk de- 
teimined by Pire Assaying. Two different methods were oiployed. 
The ’^Iron Nail Method”, was used on the products low in copper, 
such as talc froth, iron concentrates and tailiigs. On products 
high in copper, such as copper concentrates, zinc concentrates 
and the original ore, ”Perkins® i&icess Litharge Method” was used. 

The Iron Nail Method . This method was used because 
it required no preliminary fusion for the determination of re-* 
ducing power of the products, whose precious metal values were

to be determined. 


This method does not atten^t to oxidize the low 
purities, such as sulphur, arsenic and antimony, but aims to 
carry them into the slag. The ore is deconposed by the iron 
nails added to the charge and by the litharge present. The 
soda should be, at least, twice the amount of the ore in the 
charge, as this flux carries the loopurities into the slag* 

The reactions that take place are as follows j- 

7 PbO + PeSg + 2 NagCO^ = 7 Pb + + feO + 2 COg. 

Since only a limited amount of PbO is used (25 to 3^ grams), 
the remainder of the pyrite is decomposed by iron nails, 
thtis,- 

PeSg + Pe * 2 PeS* 

The PeS goes into the slag*

COABSE CRUSHING^ 

In October, 1930t a sMiment of 300 pounds of dlt- 
sanlnated ore was received from the Plln Hon Mines. 

Screening. 

The ore was minus 2 inch size when received. It was 
screened over l|4 inch and 14 mesh on a laboratory shaking screen^ 
yielding three ser^i products,^ plus 1/4 inch, minus l/4 inch, 
plus l4 me^, and miims l4 mesh material^ Bepresentative sao^les 
of 1/2 in^ size and ever were selected for microscopic and miner- 
ogrsphlc examdim^ions. 

Cruihiag. 

All the plus l/4 inch material was broken in a email 
Dodge bre^cer (figure 11.), set to about 3/2> iuch size. The pro¬ 
ducts of the Dodge bre^i^ w^e scre^ted giving the above screen 
products. 

All the minus 1/4 inch plus l4 mesh, from the Laboratory 
Shaking. SereenC figure 15*) was passed through an Allie-Chalmers 
saa^le grind^(flgure 12.) set to give about l4 mesh product. The 
products from the grinder was screwed as before. The oversize 
was crushed again until all the material was minus l4 mesh.

When craahod to minus l4 mesh, all the material 
was thoroia^hly mixed to ensure unifounity and then riffled to 
give a sanoale of about 20 pounds. The 20-pound sasq^le was used 
for preliminary chemical analyses of the ore and the screening 
analyses for mineral particles liberations. The balance of the 
materiedr was stored in large air-ti^t tin container until re- 
q[aired for tests*

iiineral Liberation Itae ^ grinding* 

Tine degree of grinding in flotation practice is to 
unlock the min^Tals so that no one particle, which is required 
to be s^arately recovered, may be a composite of more than one 
mineral* 

A test was made to detemine the effect of grind** 
ing.on the various minerals present in the ore. The procedure 
was as follows,«» a unit batdi of ore was dry ground with 3020 
grams of balls in the Denver Laboratory Veinig tjppe ball«^ill 
for 13 minutes* Screen analysis was made of ^:«und product 
and the metal values in each screen else det emined* The re« 
suits are reported in Table No* 8* 

The metal values in various scre^ sires* of the 
grinding test, showed that the zinc bl^de and the chalcopyrite 
were readily ground to minus 200 mei^» After the ore was ground, 
the per cent of the zinc blende retained on various screen sizes 
was sli^xtly hi^ier thcot the per cent of the chalcopyrite* Xbds 
would be es^ected since the hardness of the zinc blende, ihich 
is the iron variety, is slightly higher than the hardness of the 
chalcopyrite* In general, the percentages of the zinc blende 
and the chalco^rite retained on variotis screen sizes seem to

ran very close together. This seems to indicate that the 
two miUierals were still locked together. This would he ex¬ 
pected sj^ce the two minerals* which appear as solid solutions 
and ha;7e solidified practically at the same time from ma^Datic 
solutions* may still he coopositlt particles. Hence high degree 
of grinding would he necessary to liberate the mineral 
particles. 

The mineralogical analyses showed that the pyrite was 
readily crushed to minus 100 plus 200 mesh and with greater 
difficultythan the zinc and the chalcopyrite heyond 200 

meslu This was prohahly due to the fact that the average size 
of the pyrite crystals in the ore was over 200 mesh. It may he 
probable that the pyrite minerals* to plus 200 me^ size* were 
only liberated from the other odnersds and rcsaained as idiole 
czystalSf retaining their original pyrite fom. Orinding heyond 
200 mesh size would he crashing ^eh individual ^rite crystal 
to sm^er size. 

The per cent of the pyrite retained on the various 
screen sizes to plus 100 mesh ran close to that of the zinc 
blende and the chalcopyrite* hut h^ow 100 mesh size, the amount 
of the pyrite retained was greater. This would he expected 
since pyrite occurs as individual crystals in the ore and is 
practically not interlocked with the zinc blende mad the chal-

copyrlte • Xt is prol^Ms that the precious metals are as-» 
sociated with the zinc blende and the chalcopyrite* The 
Ottawa loaboratories have come to the following conclusion*- 
”Ho mineral was detected that would indicate the presence of 
gold and silver* It is concluded, therefore, that these pre¬ 
cious minerals occur in a state of extrase subdivision and 
will probably defy conoma^ration* They €q;>paTently occur as- 
_ sociated with either the chalcopyrite, the sphalerite or the 
pyrite (25)*** 

In conclusion,. it be said that grindibiig to 

minus 200 mesh is necessary to unlodc the mineral particles 
in the Hin Xlon disseminated ore» This degree of grinding 
fairly well liberates the minered particles for flotation 
purpose* 

firindine Tests * 

A series of tests on ball-mill dzy grinding was 
carried out, to detemine the Imigth of time and the wei^t 
of balla reqiiired to a mit l»tch which would give the desired 
degree of finmiess of grinding* The results obtained are shown 
in Table No* 9*

SgLB^TTVTR FLOTATION. 

Sigperimental woxk in flotation^ for any oro« is 
principally tests on the flotation rea^^ts and the emonnts re* 
q[aired to obtain the best resTilts. In the present investigation 
on the flotation of the Flin Flon disseminated ore« the reagents 
sheeted were, with few exceptions, those adopted at the Flin 
Flon 25*ton Pilot mill* Pine oil was used instead of aerofloat 
and cresylic acid* The amounts of the reagents, to be added, 
were based on those used in the 25-toa Pilot mill* The reagents 
were added to the pulp in solid form* 

STAHDABPIZATlCm OF TEST PBOCBDORSU 

Before any experimental work could be undertaken, it 
W 81 S necessary to detemine the length of time required for 
agitation and for rmaoval of froth in the various stages of the 
operation. 

Preliminary Test No. 

The Laboratory type Mineral Separation Sub-A machine 
was partly filled with water. The impeller of the machine was 
started and I 5 OO grams of ore were placed in the machina. Water 
was thm^ added until the level of the sli^tly above 

the level of the partition between the agitation coapartment and

the froth separation coopartment* This gave a dilution of 
about 3 to !• The pulp was agitated in the flotation cell 
for 30 minutes with 2.00 pounds of lime» and 2*00 pounds of 
zinc sulphate to the ton of dry wei^t of ore charged* At the 
end of 30 minutes conditioning, four drops of pine oil were 
added, air admitt^ and the pulp floated for talc; collecting 
three talc froths, each of five minutes interval8« 

To float copper, 2«rS pounds of NaCl were added and 
the pulp agitated five minutes; followed by 0»04 pound of 
potassium ethyl zanthate, smd one minute agitation, and then 
2 drops of pine oil, collecting two, five minutes interval, froths* 
For zinc flotation, 2«0 pounds of lime, 0*74 pound 
of copper suli^te were added, agitated for 10 minutes, followed 
by 0 •12 pound of xanthate and 2 drops of pine oil, and two,five 
minutes interval, froths collected* 

Iron was floated with 0*3 pound of xanthate and 8 
drops of pine oil, collecting the froth for 10 minutes* 

The machine was then drained of the remaining pro«* 
duct, thorougl:^ washed, and filled with water* The fiction 
products ware placed on a steam heated dri«r to dry* The tail¬ 
ings were dewater^ by decantation ai^ likewise dried*

Sssmination of eaclr of these products showed that the 
copper frothy the zinc froth, and the iron froth collected during 
the second five^intLte interval were in all cases largely com* 
posed of gangue minerals; and as the total amount collected in each 
case wae r^^atively small, it wats clearly indicated that a five* 
minute collection of froth for each flotation was sufficient* In 
excess of that time period the conc^tratee were too greatly 
diluted with gs^e minerals^ The tadc froth showed a gradual 
increase In metallic sulphides with increasing time of froth re¬ 
moval, indicated by a daitsnlng of the froth* However, as there 
was also a steady increase in reoaoval of this objectionable iiopuTity, 
it was decided, to standardise on a talc froth remaval of from 10 
to 15 minutes, to ensure complete removal of the talc;although it 
























91 


was ejqpscted that this longer period would tend to give 
metallic sulphide losses in the talc froth* 

Eygljfejaanr Teat 

The zinc concentrate produced in this first experi¬ 
ment showed an excessive iron contmit* It was assvimed this 
repres^ted insufficient pyrite depression^ due to insufficient 
conditioning prior to zinc flotation* To check this point a 
second esqperioental run was made increasisg the time of zinc 
conditioning from 10 minutes to 30 minutes* Bisagents used 
were the same as in Test No» 1* with the following exceptions»<i* 
30 minutes conditioning prior to zinc flotation, 6 drops instead 
of S drops of pine oil added to the cell for iron flotation, 
and the froths from the copper, the zinc and the iron flotations 
were collected for five minutes* Ta^ls Ho» 11* ^ws the re¬

The restilts obtained (Table No. II) showed no inw 
provement due to Increased time of conditioning prior to zinc 
flotation; and therefore it was considered that a 10 minute 
conditioning period prior to zinc flotation was sufficient. 

General Procedure of Teets for ilotation# 

Prom the standardization tests results, the follow¬ 
ing procedure was established for routine eigperlmental flotation 
testst- A unit baic^ of the Plin Plon distsemlnated ore was dry 
ground in the bsd^l-mill. with 6(^0 grams of balls for one hour, 
yielding a product of c^roxinately 99 mixzus 200 mesh 

(See Chester 6). The ore weus placed with lime and zinc sulphate 
in the Laboratory Sub«A flotation madiine, and the pulp condition¬ 
ed for 30 minutes. Talc was remoired for 12 minutes with pine 
oil as frothing reagent. To float copper, the pulp was condition¬ 
ed for ten mizsites. with salt; collecting and frothing agents 
were th«i added said oopp^ froth collected for five minutes. To 
float zinc, the pulp was conditioned for ten minutes with zinc 
conditioning and activatiBg reagents; collecting and frothing 
ag^f^s were then ndded and zinc collected for five minutes. To 
thil zinc tailing, collecting and. frothing reagents werh added and 
iron froth collected for five minutes. The machinh was then 
drained, thoxeughly imshed, and filled with water. The flotation 
products were th«L dried; the tailings dewatered and dried.

The results ob^ined by this pracedore, cis shown 
In the restate of Test No^ 2 * (Table were far from 

satisfactory* The co|^er concentrates carried as much of 
the einc (53*25?^) as of the copper (5^.65^) and the grade of 
copper concmitrates ( 6 * 62 ^) was low* Also the zinc concen* 
trates, althon^ collecting practiccaiy 9 ^ of the remaining 
zinc (31*7^ out of a badance of 3 ^*^^} and a similar amotuit 
of the remaining copper( 28 *^j^ out of a balance of was 
likewise a low grade concentrate ( 4 * 3 ^ zinc). However* the 
losses of copper ( 1 *^ 5 ^) and of the zinc ( 3 * 333 ^) were reason¬ 
ably low* and it was* therefore* ponsidered that this would pxove 
a satisfactory starting point for further work* 

SSLECTIVE JLOTATIOH TESTS* 

Having established a procedure which gave low losses 
in copper and zinc to the tailings* and at the same time fixed 
such variables as time periods v of conditioning and of frothing* 
pulp d^isity, degree of fineness of grinding* etc** the next 
step was to attempt to adjust reagent amounts to isprcve the 
selectivity of the different floats so as to produce a maxionsn 
selection of the desired aOnerals with minlmam contamination 
of a given mineral concmstrate with minerals from preceding or 
succeeding operations* The aBK>unt of ore available did not

allow of nultlplo te&te under Identical conditions to pro¬ 
duce a given concentrate in sufficient (plantIties to allow 
clea n i n g or recleaning-. Therefore, it had to be acc^ted 
that the (piality of the concentrate produced would not 
e^fual or even be directly coD^arable with the results of the 
25-ton pilot mill«. It was aSGRimed that satisfactory selective 
flotation would be realized if it were possible to obtain con¬ 
centrates, which obviously could be cleaned satisfactorily by 
8 ubse(pi^t operations, and at the same time did not indicate 
excessive costly reagent consuB^tion* 

It has been well estaldished by practice that the 
best procedure for selective flotation of copper-zinc-iron ores 
is to first float the copper then the zinc, and lastly the 
iron* This rnesaas that the copper concentrate first produced 
should carry a maxhmmi amomt of that metal* It may also carry 
considerable coBounts of zinc and of iron, as these metals can 
be zmaoved in cleaning operations on the copper concentrates, 
and returned to the GojfpBT circuit without seriously interfer¬ 
ing with 8 ubsecp:i^t operations* Similarly the zinc concentrate 

it 

may contain apprecial^ (pxantities of iron. But/should not 
carry any great amount of copp^, es this cannot be recovered 
without separate retreatment circuits* The copper may be re-

suitable depreseanti* but the copper product contained cazk- 
not go back to the copper circuit, as it will carry copper 
depreeeing agents with it, which will tend to reduce the 
copper recovery in that circuit* 

With these facts in Blind, it is obvious that selective 
flotation ezperiffli^ts, where no attenpt is made to clean 
the concentrates, would show satisfactory results when the 
copper concentrate shows a high recovery of the total copper 
present^ev^ if the concentrate also carries considerable 
zinc* On the other hand, the zinc concentrate should be 
low in copper, as presumahly all copper has been taken off 
prior to zinc float* Both of these concentrates may carry 
consideral^e ({uantitihs of iron, as this metal beii^ the 
last to be floated, can ba returned to either circuit without 
doing ham* Because both chalccpyrite and maxmatite carry 
iron in their chonical cenipasition, there is certain to be 
iron in both conemitrates in any event*

the reagent additions in such a way that the sine and iron 
content of the copper concentrates would be redoosd and at 
the same time make a g^^ter total recovery of the copper 
in these concentrates* 

jn^re waa three possible variables to be considered, 
piLlp alkalinity, as effected by change In cfoantity of lime 
added to the circuit, greater depression of sine by greater 
amount of zinc sulphate*, and variations In kind and quantity 
of copp^ activators* As lime is an active depressant for 
iron, changes in pulp alkalinity should be directly reflected 
on the Iron In the conc^trates*

(Table Ho* 12) shoSd that almost six pounds of lime were re^ 
(piired to raise the alkalinity to that used at the 23 -Ton 
Pilot mill (pH of 9*M); and over six pounds of lime» to raise 
it to that used at the Flin Plon Concentrator at the present 
day (pH of 10« to ll^)* 

The results of these tests (Tests Hos* It2t3f^t9t

obtained was when 2*00 pounds of lime were used (Test Ho* 1*);

only iron preset was practically that sh tch is carried in

Increasing the lime increased the zinc in the copper 
concentrates. It ts evident that increasing tlie lime increases 
the deprossi 2 )g effect on the chalcopyrite and hence the santhate 
acts on the zinc blends in preference to the copper minerals* 

The zinc in the copper conc^trates would be removed in the

In the Pr^iminary Test No, 2, an appreciable amount 
of iron (64,30S^) floated inthe zinc float (Table No, 11*), 

It was thought, that probably the zanthate used (0,12 pound 
in Preliminaxy Test N6« 2,) was in ezeese of the amount repiired 
to collect the zinc minerals: the ^cesa zanthate acting on 

the pyrite, thus floating the iron minerals in the zinc float.

In Test No* 1«» the amount of xanthate was redAiced to 0«0S 
poiind per ton of ore. ▲ deerease of xanthate decreased the 
Iron in the zinc concentrate (analysiSy^M 29»12j( in Test No«l« 
as a^inst 42.76j( in Preliminary Test Hb*2.). It was consid¬ 
ered that the iron content in the zinc concentrates was still 
too high, and could be reduced by a suitable depressing agent. 

Effect of Idme. The results of the tests (Table No* 13*) 
showed that any asioruit above 5»00 pounds of lime in the condition¬ 
ing circuit mad, 2*00 pounds in the zinc circuit (Test Ho. 10.) 
was suffidealt to duress practically all the pyrite and keep it 
out of the zinc froth# iny amount, over pounds of lixse in 
the conditionings circuit, would be a waste of that reagait. 
P^theroKire, the reeuXts showed that lime used In excess of 
5,00 pounds in the conditioning circuit and 2.00 pounds in the 
^tnc circuit decreased the zinc recovery. 

Effect of Soda Ash. In additi^ to what has been said 
previously with rei^edt to this reagmit, it may be said that 
soda a^ yieldsd a higher recovery of zinc than the lime, (92*3^ 
with sida ashs 88.0^ with lime). Althou^ the zinc recovery 
was higher, the results were not satisfactory, as the zinc con¬ 
centrates carried an s^preciable amount of iron.

gffect of Zinc Solohate^ Zinc sulphate is the 
practical depressaat for zinc hlende. The effect of this 
reagent t^on the zinc blende has been discussed in the 
*0iscu8Bion of Oopper Flotation Besults*** It may be added 
here, that any amount in excess of 2«67 pounds of zin£ sul-* 
phate decreased the zinc recoveries to less than 8S«0 per 
cent (Tests Nos* 10, 11, 12 and 13, Table No* 13«) Although 
the results of Test No* 11* show a sli^t increase of zinc 
recovery with the increcuse of zinc sulphate, bat this may 
be due to the collecting action of the cresol (effect of 
cresol diecussed on Page 103^* 

ggf ect of Thiocar^ilid* ISiiocarbanilld, used in 
place of xanthate, yielded very lew zinc recovery (1*6^), 
as well as a very low grada zinc concentrate (7*57 pw cent

Effect of Sodium Sulnfaide gad Cyanide* Sodixm sul¬ 
phide and cyanide yielded a zinc recovery of 79*5 P«3r cent

cresol was used in place of pine oil» In the sine circuit. 

1!he results of the tests showed that the cresol had a sll^t 
collecting action on the zinc blende* but it also had a 
colleeting action on the pyrite, thus raising the iron in

Pisgassion jy o a t, Flotation Results* 

The results of the copper and the zinc fixation tests 
showed that the pyrite* with proper d^ressing reagents and 
sufficient amounts of those reagents* could be practically ex* 
eluded from the copper and. the zinc concentrates. 

Effect Lime* Test No* !♦ showed that 2.00 pounds 
of lime in the conditioniz^ circuit and 2.00 pounds of lime 
in the zinc circuit was not sufficient to depress the pyrite 
from floating with the co^^er and the zinc froths. Since lime 
has a depressing effect onthe pyrite* it is evident that in^ 
creass of lime will decrease the iron recoveiy. The flotation

test results showed this to he the case* (Table No. l4.) 

Soda Ash. Tests, with soda auih used in 
place of lime, showed that a satisfactory iron concentrate 
could not he obtained (Teat No* 9.) since the pyrite floated 
with the copper and the zinc froths. Soda ash has little, 
if any, depressing effect on the pyrite. 

gffect Qj[ Zinc gulnhate» Zinc sulphate has no effect 
on the pyrite, or the recovOTy of the iron, htt increasing 
the zinc 8ul|diate increased the zinc in the iron concentrates 
since the zinc in the zone concentrates was decreased. (See 
"'^iscTission of Zinc Flotation Besults”). 

Effect of Thioearhanilid* The properties of thio* 
carhanilid, as a collecting agent has been discussed previous¬ 
ly. It also yielded low iron recoveries in the iron concen- 
tratee (10.6^). 

Effect of Sodim Salnhide and Sodigm Cyanide. Sodium 
sulphide and cyaxilde have a depreseing^ effect on the pyrite. 
These reagents added,along with lime, to the conditioning cir¬ 
cuit idelded an iron recovezy of 67«6 per cent Test No. l6.}.

grade of iron concentrates was higher (43*16)^ iron in Test No*

]Sffect of Xantbate# In sosie flotation tests, the 
ankonnt of xanthate used in the iron circuit was yaried. The 
results showed that 0^20 pound of xanthate was sufficient to 
collect the pyrite in the zinc tctiXings.

Precious metal values were detexmined in the flotar- 
tion products in some of the tests* The assays (Table No*15) 
showed that the silver was concentrated mostly in the copper 
and the zinc concentrates. The gold was mostly concentrated 
in the zinc concentrate* Over S5 per cent of the gold and 
over 73 cent of the silver floated with the sulphide miner¬ 
als froths. From 6 to 7 per cent of the gold and from 11 to 
13 per cent of the silver floated with the talc froth, ip- 
preciahle amount of the precious metals in the talc froth 
would he recovered in the tale cleaning operations* From 
these figures (Table No. 15#) it is evident that a large per¬ 
center of the precious metela would be floated with the sul¬ 
phide concentrates and only a small percentage would remain

In the tailings* In such a case, the precious metal values 
in the tailings could he accepted as a loss, as the cost of 
the cyanidation treatment woxild not Justify their recovery. 

SUMMARY AMD OOMCEUSIONS. 

The results of the treats on the selective flotation 
may he suBiaarized as follows,« 

1« At least 6 pounds of lime was required in the condi¬ 
tioning circuit to maintain an alkalinityin the 
copper circuit equivalent to that which is practiced 
at the Hin Flon Concentrator. 

2. Increase of lime in tho conditioning circuit decreas¬ 
ed the copper recovery, and increased the zinc in the 
copper concentrates, since the xanthate acted on the 
zinc blende in preference to the depressed copper 
minerals* 

3. Soda ash yielded very low copper, and iron recoveries* 
The zinc recovery was high, hut the zinc concentrates 
carried an cqxpreciahle amount of iron*This reag^t can¬ 
not he used to yield satisfactory results without a 
depressing agmt for pyrite and chalcopyrite* 

4* Thiocarhsnilid yielded low recoveries* It is not as 
powerful a collector as the xanthate* Since thiocar- 
hanilid is not very soluble in water and has to he

Sodlttm sulphide and sodium cyanide produced no decrease 
of zinc in the copper concentrate. In fact, opposite 
results were obtained, the zinc was activated. These 
reagents showed a depressing effect on the chalcopyrlte

COMPARISON OP RESULTS . 

A compairson hetween the reagent consuisptions, grade 


of concentrates and recoveries of metals obtained in the 
present investigation and those of the 25«Tou Pilot mill is 
shovn^ in Tables Nos. l6 and ly. 

Reagent 



Total reagent constant ion is fi^preciably higher in 


the present investigations, but this is almost entirely made 
of addi tional lime to the conditioning circuits. It 
has been pointed out elsei^re that it was necessary to great¬ 
ly increase the lime st^ly to the flotation circuit to obtain 
anywhere near the piilp pH value that was used at the Pilot 
mill, and it i s quite probable that difference in mineral 
content of the waters used would account for the difference. 

Cleaning the rougher concentrates in the present in¬ 
vestigation would have increased the reagent consumption.

Presumably, the amotints used for copper recovery would have 
been higher^ and those used for zinc resovvxy wou).d, probably, 
have been equal to the amounts used at the Pilot mill* 

Becoveries ^ 

The copper recoveries were not as high as those ob¬ 
tained at the 2^-Ton Pilot mill; the zinc recoveries were 
slightly hi^er* The grade of the concentrate was not as 
highf It is possible that cleanizig concentrates would raise 
the metal values, as well as, decrease the is^urities* 

The p recious metals distributions in the flotation 
products obtained by the writer and the prodxicts obtained 
at the Pilot mill, vary in some respectIn the present 
tests, the gold was concentrated mostly in the zinc concentrate; 
while the Pilot mill results showed that the gold was concentrate- 
ed mostly in the copper concentrates* The gold and silver 
recoveries in the copper and the zinc concentrates were practi¬ 
cally the same in both, the Pilot mill tests and the present 
investigation tests* 

Recovery percentages of various flotation products were calculated 
on the basis of the metal content in the feed to the re^ective 
circxiits; loss percentages were based on the tailings of the same 
(respective) circuits*

BULK ILOTAIION . 

There are certain Inherent diffieoltiee In the 
way of effective hulk flotation for separation of all the 
sulphide minerals in an ore into one fraction from which 
the individual minerals may he selectively floated later* 

To obtain satisfactory results, it is essential that all the 
sulphide minerals he activated or promoted to mazimum flota¬ 
tion conditions, and that there shall he a minimum of do- 
pressing effect or reag^ts present* When the selective 
flotation of the hulk flotation concentrate is made almost 
the reverse conditions are reqfolked* That is, one only (at 
a time) of the sulphide minerals is to he promoted to flota^ 
tion, the others are to he depressed* 

In the tseatment of a copper-zino-iron ore, such 
as the Flin Hon disseminated ore, hulk flotation will require 
an activator or promotor which will act equally effectively on 
all the sulphide minerals (chalcopyrite, zinc blende, 
pyrrhotite, and pyrite). The resulting floated concentrate 
has, then, to he treated by reagents in such a manner that 
the first, only the chalcopyrite will he left activated, or 










- Ill - 

made active to flotation whilst the other sulphide stirfaces 
will he deactivated or d^ressed* Having selectively float-* 
ed the copper, the balance of the bulk flotation concentrate 
has to be treatild to reactivate the zinc blende without re* 
activating the iron sulphide minerals. The tailing product 
from zinc flotation would be an iron concentrate* 

Obviously, there is another possible scheme of 
treatment of the bulk flotation concentrate, namely, to so 
treat or condition the bulk concentrate that the copper and 
^inc sulphide are d^ressed during the first retreatment, and 
an iron concentrate only floated; then to reactivate the zlnd 
blende only, leaving the copper minerals for a tailings from 
the selective treatment. There is, however, little likelihood 
of such a schesie working satisfactorily. In the first place, 
because of the relative floatability of the various sulphides, 
chalcopyrite is much more readily activated than it i s depress* 
ed, and to keep it down for any length of time would require 
considerable quantities of the copper depressing agent. Also, 
the sane substances which would activate the pyrite (if more 
were needed over that used in the bulk float) would also re¬ 
activate the copper. The zinc blende probably, could be handled 
either way. The substances used to depress the chalcopyrite 
msy also depi^ss the zinc blende, but the blende reactivation 





132 - 


would not be ae pronounced* Probably the most ioporiant 
objection to this alternative procedure in selective flota^ 
tion of this bulk float concentrate lies in the fact that 
pyrite ie less readily floated than chalcopyrite while it is 
fairly readily depressed by the cheapest-of-all depressing 
reagents, namely, lime* It was, therefore, reasonable to 
eliminate this possible method of procedure without actual 
ejqoeriment and no investigations were made on it* The more 
obvious procedure of treating the bulk float for selective 
recovery of first the copper and then the zinc, leaving the 
iron €U3 a selective flotation tailings, was adopted* 

has been mentioned earlier (Chapiter 4*),talc may 
be handled in one of two ways in the bulk flotation, either 
included in the bulk floation concentrate and subse^ently re<- 
moved, or removed previous to bulk flotation* For the purpose 
of the preset investigations it was considered advisable to 
remove it previous to bulk flotation; largely because this pro¬ 
cedure eliminated another variable in the scheme of tests* Ihi- 
doubtedly, to meke the investigations complete, the alternative 
procedure whould also be investigated*

flotation reported In Chapter clearly indicated that there 
is a strong tendency for copper and zinc to float together, 
and no difficulty was anticipated in making the hulk float. 

Bat difficulties might arise in the subsequent selective treat¬ 
ment of that concentrate for s^aration of the copper and the 
zinc minerals. 

C* S* Parsons (23) ejqplains the tendency for zinc 
to accooqpany the copper in the selective flotation on the basis 
that there is produced in the Plln Sion ore, after grinding, a 
little soluble copper salt and this salt tends to promote the 
flotation of blende* Copper sulphate is the accepted reagent 
for reactivating zinc blende tes^orarily d^ressed for the 
previous selective float of another mineral; and hence the 
natural occurrence of a soluble copper salt can be accepted as 
the probable cause of the presence of zinc in the copper concen¬ 
trate by selective flotation. It follows that little, if any, 
zinc activator would be required to raise all the zinc with the 
copper in the bulk float. 

Because the iron sulphides carry a considerabls por> 
tion, if not the major portiozi^ of the precious metal values in 
the ore, it was necessary to float the iron, also, in the bulk 
float. The most common and ches^jeat depressant for pyrite is 
lims, and this would Indicate that conditioning for the bulk 







114 - 


float should not includo lime. Ahemioe of lime In the cir¬ 
cuit, however, would have the flotation circuit slightly eu:ld, 
due to acidic decooposition products of the sulphides of the 
ore, and the selective flotation e:(periments had chearly In¬ 
dicated that an acid circuit was not satisfactory for talc 
removed* The alternative to lime appeared to be soda ash and 
thus preliminary ejqperimenta on bulk flotations required con¬ 
ditioning with soda €u»h for a neutral or alkaline circuit* 

Procedure g£. Teats * 

With the preceding theory in mind, the following 
schane of procedure for bulk flotation tests was adopted,- 
Ore saoqfxles in unit batches of 1^00 grams were to be condltlong¬ 
ed in an alkaline pulp with soda ash under agitation for JO 
minutes* Pine oil in amounts equivalent to 0*24 pound per ton 
of ore then added, and the talc froth produced, removed for 12 
minutes* following talc raodoval sulphide minerals were to be 
floated for S minute periods, using oollecting and frothing re- 
agmits only* The remaining materials were to be collected as 
tailizigs* Bulk flotation conc^trates from several batches 
were then to be treated under selective flotation procedures, 
similar to those used in the investigations on sslectlve flotac¬ 
tion of the raw ore itself,with preliminary conditionli^ follow-

•d hy 8 el 0 otiv« floats of first, copper and then sine. The 
main probleD ai^ared to be the deteimination of proper re- 
a^wits and amoviats for economical s^aration of the various 
valuable minerals from the bulk float concentrates* 

C* S*^ Parsons (25) stated that copper salts (produced 
during grinding of tha ore) activating the zinc blende, should 
be possible of elimination by sodium sulphide and suggested 
that selective flotation of bulk concentrate should be preceded 
by a conditioning with sodi^ sulphide and possibly a small 
amount of sodium cyanide* Selective flotation for copper also 
required the addition of zinc sulphate to duress the zinc^ and 
of lime to depress the iron* 

SUIPHIDg MimALS rLOTATIOl? TESTS * 

Preparation of sufficient bulk float concentrates 
to coupletely study the effects of variations in adl these 
factors, required considerably more ore than was available* 

It was, therefore, necessary to limit the investigations to 
a study of a vexy few of the many factors* Actually, the in¬ 
vestigations were limited to the deteimination of the effect 
df soda ^h in the preliminazy conditionlning and the suitability 
< of sodimn sulphide as a d^ctivator for the zinc in copper 
flotation*

results of the tests showed (Tests Nos* 1 and 2, 
Table No* 18*} that 0*133 potmds of thiooarbanilid or xanthate 
was not sufficient to completely recover the sulphide minerals* 
Test No* 2* showed that a depressant was required in the con¬ 
ditioning circuit in order that the copper and the zinc in the 
talc froth would be at a mlnisaM* 

Tests (Table No* 18*) showed that 4 pounds of lime

ZINC TESTS. 

The results of the zinc flotation tests are shown

risjgussion of Zinc notation Results . 

The zinc flotation results showed zinc recoveries 
to 92.^6 per cent. Increase of zinc depressing agents in 
the coxditioning circuit, in order to decrease the zinc in 
the copper circuit, i^owed a sli^t decrease in the zinc re¬ 
covery, but this was overcome by increasing the activator 
(copper sulphate) for zinc blende. Decreasing the zinc in 
the copper, float increased the zinc recoveries. 

R^very of Gold and Silver# 

The gold and silver concentrations (Table No. 21.) 
in the flotation products were analogous to those of the 
stral^t selective flotation process* Appreciable amounts of 
the gold (26.15^) and the silver (24.55^) raaainsd in the tall-

SUMMARY MD CQNQLaSIONS . 

The results of the hulk flotation teets may be ennmar* 
ized as follow8»«* 

1* The T>ulk flotation followed by a selectlTa flotation 
process, for the separation and concentration of the 
Flln Flon ore, was possible* 

A depressant.for the sulphide minerals was necessary 
In the conditioning operations In order to decrease 
the metallic minerals In the talc froth. Lime served 
this puxposii^ fairly well. 

3. Four pounds of lime and *200 pound of xanthate yield¬ 
ed maxlmom copper and zinc recoveries. 

4. Sodium sulphide and sodium cyanide decreased the zinc 
In the copper concentrates. 

5. Over 65 per cent of the gold and over 75 per cent of 
the silver floated with the sulphide minerals concen¬ 
trates* 

6* The reagents and ao^unta which jilelded most satisfactory 
recoveries in the bulk flotation were,-

COMPARISON WITH SlXSCTIVB FLOTATION* 


A comparison betwe^i the reag^t consumptions, grade of

conc6atrat«8» and recoTeries of metalsin the lialk flotation 
with 8ul}8equ«nt solectivo flotation and the straight selective 
flotation tests is shown in Tables Nos* 22 and 23* 

Eea^ent Conaumptiona* 

She reagents consisn^tion is appreciably higher* This 
is dne to the fact that the minerals had been activated in the 
bulk flotation operation^ and greater amounts of depressing re¬ 
agents were required, in the subsequent operations, to overcome 
this effect* 

HeCOvaries* 

The recoveries of the coxier and the zinc were practi¬ 
cally the ssmie for the two methods* The iron recovery was not 
as hi^ in the bulk flotation* 

The bulk flotation process yielded a sli^tly higher 
grade of copper concentrate, and appreciably higher zinc concen¬ 
trate* (Table No* 23*). 

The gold and silver concentrations in the flotation 
products were analogous* The bulk flotation tailings carried 
hi^er precious metal values* This was probably due to lower 
recovery of the iron minerals* No doubt, the values would have 
been the same had the iron recoveries been as high*

CONCLUSIONS , 


Conclusion , 

The experimental work showed that a preliminary hulk 
flotation followed hy a seleotire flotation method would 
yields if not hi^er recoveries and grade of concentrates, at 
least as high as a strai^t selective flotation* With higher 
reagents CO nsvsq^tion to attain the results equally as higl^no 
advantage could he gained hy adopting this practice for the 
separation and concentration of the Hin Hon ore*
