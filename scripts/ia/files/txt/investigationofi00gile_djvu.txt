CHAPTER I 


STATEMENT OF PROBLEM 

All subjects which may be taught in a small high school are listed 
among those appearing on pages 8 and 9 of the Handbook. However, since 
small high schools offer somewhat restricted programs, certain arrange¬ 
ments may be entered into concerning courses most commonly taught. 

The total enrolment, resulting from combining classes of two grades, 
may be a factor determining the extent to which the suggested arrangements 
will be employed. Details of these arrangements are as follows: 

(a) i. The practice of cycling Grade ten and eleven courses, 

and of combining these grades for instruction, may be applied to: 

Language 10 and 20 
Literature 10 and 20 
Social Studies 10 and 20 
Science 10 and 20 
General Mechanics 15 and 16 
Foods and Nutrition 10 and Fabrics 
and Dress 10 

ii. Students in a school where cycling arrangement is used 
are reminded that both Grades ten and eleven courses in a sequence must 
be taken before proceeding to Grade twelve. For example, if a student 
takes Science 20 as his first year high school science course, he must 
subsequently take Science 10 before registering in either Physics 30 or 
Chemistry 30 

Two other possible arrangements are double programming and scheduling

of certain electives 


2 


In view of the limitations existing in the small high schools 
to which this section applies, cycling, double programming and the 
scheduling of certain electives have been outlined as being 
acceptable and advantageous practices. 

It was felt that if the material in Science 10 and 20 were 
sequentially arranged, Science 20 may be relatively difficult for the 
grade ten student and Science 10 may be relatively easy for the grade 
eleven student. Thus a grade ten student taking Science 20 may not 
fully understand many of the important concepts which serve as a 
foundation for Chemistry 30 and Physics 30 and, as there is a one-year 
interval before grade twelve, he may forget much of this important back¬ 
ground material. It is possible for such a student to receive a tt C n 
standing in Science 20, then proceed to Chemistry 30 and Physics 30 if 
he receives a "B 1 ' standing, or better,in Science 10. 

The purpose of this study is to determine whether cycling Science 10 
and 20 affects achievement in Chemistry 30 and/or Physics 30.

CHAPTER II 


DESIGN 

There were two main groups in this study, Group A and Group B. 

Group A was the experimental group, and Group B was the control group. 

Group A consisted of those students who took grade nine in 1952-53, 
Science 20 in 1953-5^* Science 10 in 195^-55» Chemistry 30 and/or Physics 
30 in 1955-56. Group B consisted of those students who took grade nine 
in 1953-5^> Science 10 in 195^-55» Science 20 in 1955-56, Chemistry 30 
and/or Physics 30 in 1956-57* The same 104 schools in Group A made up 
Group B, that is, all the rural schools in Alberta which were "off cycle"* 
in 1953-54 and "on cycle"* in 195^-55 and offered grade twelve in 1955-56 
and 1956-57* Further restrictions for the selection of students in these 
schools were: 

i. Students must have taken grades nine, ten, eleven and twelve 
in the same school. 

ii. Students must not have repeated any high school science course 
nor taken any high school science course by correspondence. 

Using the same schools in both G roups A and B tended to stabilize 
the influence of other factors which may affect achievement. Some of 
these factors may be: change of teachers, qualifications of teachers, 
size of school, adequacy of library and science laboratory, socio-economic 


♦Grades ten and eleven taking Science 20 - off cycle. 
Grades ten and eleven taking Science 10 - on cycle.

status and intelligence. 

The total rural population was used, making sampling unnecessary. 

All of the students under study did not take the same grade twelve 
subjects. Because of the possible effect of transfer of learning, it 
was necessary to break each of the two main groups into the following 
sub-groups consisting of those students who took: 

1. Chemistry 30 with Mathematics 30 and Physics 30. 

2. Chemistry 30 with Physics 30, but not Mathematics 30. 

3. Chemistry 30, but not Physics 30 or Mathematics 30. 

4. Chemistry 30 with Mathematics 30, but not Physics 30. 

5. Physics 30 with Chemistry 30 and Mathematics 30. 

6. Physics 30 with Chemistry 30, but not Mathematics 30. 

7. Physics 30 with Mathematics 30, but not Chemistry 30. 

8. Physics 30, but not Chemistry 30 and Mathematics 30. 

Each sub-group was broken into three parts: Boys, Girls, Boys and Girls. 

To insure siinilar sub-groups for comparison, each sub-group in 
Group A was equated to the corresponding sub-group in Group B on the 
basis of the grade nine Departmental Examinations in Science and 
General. The General Examination served as a Mental Ability test. It 
was felt that these two examinations would have the greatest predictive 
value for grade twelve Chemistiy 30 and Physics 30 achievement than any 
other combination of two grade nine examinations. To validate this 
criterion, multiple correlations were found between Chemistry 30 (or Physics 30) 
and grade nine General and grade nine Science. 

Although the parent populations are normal in distribution, many 



5 


sub-groups were found to be not normally distributed. Product-moment 
coefficients of correlation are based upon noimal distributions, and 
therefore the raw scores were changed to M T M scores. 

Each sub-group in the Experimental Group was compared by analysis 
of variance with the corresponding sub-group in the Control Group. This 
was to insure that corresponding sub-groups were equated as to grade nine 
General and grade nine Science. Raw scores were used for the analysis 
of variance. Corresponding sub-groups were then compared, by analysis of 
variance, according to Chemistry 30 or Physics 30 raw scores.

CHAPTER IV 


DATA 

PART A: SAMPLE SIZE 

The statistical procedures used in this study could hardly be 
justified using sample sizes of twenty-five or less. Therefore, four of 
the eight sub-groups must be eliminated. These are: 

i. Chemistry with Physics, no Mathematics 

ii. Physics with Chemistry, no Mathematics 

iii. Physics with Mathematics, no Chemistry 

iv. Physics, no Chemistry, no Mathematics 

In six of the eight sub-groups in Table I, the sample size decreased 
from 1956 to 1957* in spite of a general increase in the Alberta grade 
twelve population during this period. Two possible reasons might be 
advanced to account for this shrinkage. Firstly, the shortage of 
qualified high school teachers is becoming more acute, especially in 
rural centralizations. This would force more high school students to 
take correspondence in certain subjects and/or move to larger centrali¬ 
zations to complete their high school programs and/or take more limited 
high school programs, especially in grade twelve. Secondly,the Experi¬ 
mental Group included some students who received a "G” standing in 
Science 20, proceeded to Science 10 and received a M B M , or better, 
standing, then took Chemistry 30 and/or Physics 30. The students in the 
Control Group received a f, C”, or better, standing in Science 10, received 
a ’’B 11 , or better, standing in Science 20, then proceeded to Chemistry 30

and/or Physics 30. This means that some students in the Control Group 
were unable to take Chemistry 30 and/or Physics 30 because of a "C" 
standing in Science 20 whereas some students in the Experimental Group 
took Chemistry 30 and/or Physics 30 even though they received a "C” standing 
in Science 20. 

The sample size of two groups: 

Chemistry with Mathematics, no Physics, and 
Chemistry, no Mathematics, no Posies, 
is affected further by equating the groups. This is explained in part B 
of this Chapter.

PART B: EQUATING GROUPS 


9 


In order to insure equal groups for comparing achievement in 
Chemistry 30 and Physics 30, each part (Boys, Girls, Total) of each sub¬ 
group in Group A was equated on the basis of grade nine General and grade 
nine Science, with the corresponding section (Boys, Girls, Total) of the 
sub-group in Group B. For example. Girls taking Chemistry 30 with 
Physics 30 and Mathematics 30 from Group A were equated with Girls taking 
the same subjects from Group B, on th© basis of grade nine General and 
grade nine Science. The comparison was made by analysis of variance, 
using the F ratio to test for significance. The F ratio is the comparison 
of the mean squares (Variance) about the means to the mean squares 
(Variance) within groups. 

The .01 level of significance is chosen because of non-normality 
of many distributions, even though the parent populations are normally 
distributed. For analysis of variance the distributions should be normal. 
However, the significance of analysis of variance is not seriously 
affected by non-normality, but a more stringent level of significance 
should be used. Therefore, the .01 level is used instead of the .05 
level.

N in Table II is not necessarily the sums of the numbers as 

shown in Table I - Size of Sub-Groups. It was necessaiy to delete some 

of the individual scores in six sub-groups: 

Chemistry with Mathematics, no Physics - Total, Boys, Girls 
Chemistry, no Mathematics, no Physics - Total, Boys, Girls 

in order to reach the .01 level of non-significance for grade nine 
General and grade nine Science. The individuals thus eliminated are not 
included in the Validation of Criteria or in the Comparison of Achieve¬ 
ment. The variances in the other six sub-groups were non-significant 
at the .01 level for grade nine General and grade nine Science without 
removing any individual scores. 

Details of Table II are shown in Appendix A, and a worked example 
of the method used in the analysis of variance is included in Appendix 

B.

PART C: VALIDATION OF CRITERIA 

I: NORMALIZING DISTRIBUTIONS 

The validation of criteria was done by computing multiple 
correlations from zero-order correlations* Zero-order correlations were 
computed by the product-moment method. The basic assumption for this 
method is that the distributions to be correlated are normally distributed. 
Many of the sub-groups were found to be not normally distributed, and 
therefore it was necessary to normalize the distributions. These 
normalized scores are called M T H scores and represent the percentage 
of cumulative frequency below the score plus one-half of the given score. 
The mean is forced to approximate 50 and the standard deviation is forced 
to approximate 10. (See Appendix C for an example of the method used in 
calculating "T” scores.) 

Figures I, II and III are examples of distributions before and 


after normalizing scores

II. CORRELATIONS 


16 


Multiple correlations were used to test the validity of using grade 
nine General and grade nine Science as the basis for equating sub-groups. 
Table III gives the various steps involved in the validation procedure. 

By way of clarification we might describe each of these steps very briefly. 

The zero-order correlations were computed by the product-moment 
method, using the formula^ 

r = Nflff - *X£Y _ 

- (1Y) * 2 ] 

IT* 

where r is the correlation coefficient, X is the ^ score in the first 

i mi 

distribution and Y the corresponding £ score in the second distribution. 

An example of the method used in computing zero-order correlation 

coefficients will be found in Appendix D. 

The partial correlation coefficients were computed by the following 
2 

formulae: 


r 12.3 


rl2 - rl3 r23 

Vx -r^ y 1-^23 


*13.2 


= rl3 - rl2r23 

/I - r^-12/1- r 23 


23.1 = r23_- 

TlTr 


271- rl 3 


The partial correlation coefficient is used to determine the relation¬ 
ship of two variables when possible effects of another variable or variables 
have been partialled out from the zero order correlation.

The significance of the zero-order correlations, the multiple

the .01 level of significance. The coefficients which are significant 
at the .01 level are naturally significant also at the .05 level. Those 
coefficients which are not significant at the .01 level are tested for 
significance at the .05 level. Those which are not significant at the 
.05 level are marked with an asterisk. Tables IV and V emphasize 
significance at the .01 level but it should be remembered that the .05 
level of significance is adequate.

From Group A there are seven zero-order correlations which are 
not significant at the .01 level. Five of these correlations are also 
not significant at the .05 level. From Group B there are ten correlations 
which are not significant at the .01 level. Eight of these are not 
significant at the .05 level. This would indicate that neither the grade 
nine General nor the grade nine Science alone would be an adequate basis 
for equating groups for comparison of achievement in Chemistry 30 or 
Physics 30. 

From Group A, after shrinkage, there are three multiple correlations 
which are not significant at the .01 level. Two of these are not significant 
at the .05 level. This means that, choosing the .05 level of significance, 
the battery of grade nine General and grade nine Science is not a valid 
basis for predicting grade twelve achievement in Chemistry 30 for those 
students (boys and girls, but not Total) who are not taking Physics 30 
and Mathematics 30. This means that any conclusions about these sub¬ 
groups in this study are of doubtful value. 

From Group B, after shrinkage, one multiple correlation is not 
significant at the .01 level but all multiple correlations after 
shrinkage are significant at the .05 level. 

The reason for all the multiple correlations after shrinkage 
being significant at the .05 level and two of the multiple correlations 
after shrinkage being not significant has not been determined. However, 
one reason may be that Group A is more homogeneously grouped than 
Group B. This may be indicated by the standard error of estimate. The 
standard error of estimate for the groups in question is larger for 





















■ 


. 




n

Group A than for Group B. 

All of the multiple correlations after shrinkage in Group B are 
larger than the corresponding multiple correlations after shrinkage in 
Group A except one, P(CM). This means that the battery of grade nine 
General and grade nine Science gives a higher prediction of achievement 
in Chemistry 30 and Physics 30 in Group B than the battery in Group A. 
This may indicate that cycling Science 10 and 20 has affected the 
Sub-Groups in the Experimental Group A in a manner that has not been 


determined in this study. 




PART D: COMPARISON OF ACHIEVEMENT 


23 


A comparison of achievement of each sub-group with respect to 
Chemistry- 30 or Physics 30 was made by analysis of variance. The same 
stringency of significance applies for comparison of groups as with 
equating groups, that is, the .01 level of significance of the F ratio 
is used. Analysis of variance assumes normality of populations but is 
not seriously affected by non-normality if a stringent level of signifi¬ 
cance, usually .01, is chosen. Table V summarizes the analysis of 
variance. More complete details of the analysis of variance for comparison 
of sub-groups is given in Appendix F. 

Table V shows that there was no significant difference (at the 
.01 level) between the corresponding sub-groups. At the .05 level of 
significance there was one sub-group which showed a significance of 
difference. This sub-group was Chemistry, but neither Physics nor 
Mathematics, Girls. The F value of 3.986 was slightly larger than the 
minimum significant value from the F Table, 3.9^5» at the .05 level (by 


linear interpolation)

CHAPTER V 


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

The mill tipie correlations used to test the validation of criteria 
showed, at the .05 level, that the criteria were valid for twenty-two 
sub-groups but not valid for two sub-groups. At the .01 level the 
criteria were valid for twenty sub-groups but not valid for four sub¬ 
groups. As the .05 level of significance could be used, all but two 
of the sub-groups showed that the battery of grade nine General with 
grade nine Science could be used as a basis from which to predict 
Chemistry 30 and Physics 30 scores, but it should be noted that the 
validation generally was not high. The correlation coefficient squared 
(Variance) indicated that much of the variance of most sub-groups was 
unaccounted for in this study. This would indicate that a better basis 
for the equating of groups may have given different results in the 
comparison of achievement in Chemistry 30 or Physics 30. 

The results for the two sub-groups, Chemistry 30 but no 
Mathematics 30 or Physics 30, Boys and Chemistry 30 but no Mathe¬ 
matics 30 or Physics 30, Girls, are not valid because of inadequate 
equating of groups. 

The sample sizes indicate that cycling Science 10 and 20 may 
have other effects which were not measured in this study. 

Within the limitations of this study, cycling Science 10 and 20 
has no significant effect upon achievement in Chemistry 30 or Physics 30. 
Such a finding may appear to be somewhat surprising in view of the normal

approach to curriculum development where attempts are made to insure 
a logical progression from grade to grade. However, Science 10 deals 
predominantly with Physics while Science 20 on the other hand deals 
with Chemistry. Consequently the degree of correlation is probably 
quite small. Where students taking Science 20 first might benefit from 
a knowledge of Science 10 facts, teachers may very well adapt lesson 
plans to fill in such gaps. In this sense then one would not expect 
cycling to have any pronounced effects on either Chemistry 30 or 
Physics 30. 



CHAPTER VI 


RECOMMENDATIONS AND AREAS FOR FURTHER STUDY 

Poor predictive instruments at grade nine level for success 
in grade twelve suggest the need for better criteria at grade nine 
than the Departmental examinations. Although the majority of the 
validations were significant, in most cases a large amount of 
variance was unaccounted for. If better criteria were found a 
future study might use analysis of covariance to determine 
significance of achievement. Again, a longitudinal study would 
probably be the most effective method. 

As an administrative device, the policy of cycling Science 
10 and 20 appears to be sound. In teaching Science 10 and 20, 
teachers must constantly be aware of the background of the students 
and must teach the necessary concepts of science to enable cycled 
students to grasp the concepts of the science course they are 
currently taking. 

Cycling other subjects in grade ten and eleven may have 
different results on the achievement in grade twelve*

F at .05 level = 3.90 
F at .01 level = 6.81 

The F ratio of 1.639 is less than either of the values from the F table 
for .05 and .01 levels, and therefore there is no significant difference 
between these groups.

SOURCE OF INFORMATION 

All data for this study was found in the files of the Department 
of Education, Edmonton, Alberta. 

The names of the schools which cycled were found on the Form A 
cards. The names of the students who took grade twelve in these schools, 
and the grade twelve marks obtained by these students, were found on the 
class lists of the Departmental Examination Results. The Principals’ 
Confidential Reports of the year previous indicated whether these 
individual students did cycle Science 10 and 20 and also indicated 
whether these students took grade ten and grade eleven in the same schools 
as they took grade twelve. Then these students’ individual grade nine 
cards showed whether they took grade nine in the same school and also 
showed their grade nine marks. The students’ names were eliminated from 
the study if they failed to meet all the criteria as explained in the 
design.
