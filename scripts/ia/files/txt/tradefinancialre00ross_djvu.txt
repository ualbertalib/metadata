INTRODUCTION 


The Netherlands has plaj^ed a prominent role in v/orld 
trade since the earliest times; even in the days of the Roman 
Empire, that part of the European continent now occupied by 
Holland was becoming important in the carriage of goods to Britain. 
Today, with The Netherlands striving to recover from the effects of 
the Second World Yifar, and with Canada developing into a trading 
nation of the first rank, it is appropriate to study the commercial 
relations of these two middde powers. 

Holland has been added in her growth by her position at 
the mouths of the Rhine and Meuse rivers. These important highways 
of commerce, with the hinterlands ofGermany and northeastern France 
lying along their upper reaches, have been one of the dominant 
factors in the economic life of The Netherlands. But geographical 
position alone does not account for the place which has been held 
by this nation. The people themselves, the product of an environ¬ 
ment generally unproductive, have developed the possibilities open 
to them, and with these their spirit of enterprise. The constant 
contact with the sea led to fishing and from that to a carrying 
trade, delivering the products of the North Sea fisheries to Spain 
and Portugal and returning products of those regions to the North. 

Dutch sailors working for the Portuguese learned the secrets 
of the new long range navigation, knowledge which they promptly put 
to use after the defeat of the Armada. In 1595 they carried out

their first home-sponsored voyage around the Cape of Good Hope and 
by 1602 there was formed the United East India Company (Vereenigde 
Oost Indische Compagnie) for the purpose of financing the ventures 
in the area now known as the Dulch East Indies. 1 This com¬ 

pany was able to break the Portuguese monopoly in the Far East, 
substituting for it Dutch control of all the trade in the Indies, 
although the sub-continent of India proper did not come under their 
influence. 

The United East India Company operated for almost two 
hundred years and by its requirements stimulated business within 
the Mother country to a great extent, as well as carrying The 
Netherlands to a prominent position in world trade through its 
monopoly in the tropical products. During its life, dividends to 
the amount of 1^6,000,000 guilders were paid out; this on a capi¬ 
tal of some six and a half million guilders. In addition, savings 
of employees of the company are estimated at about three times the 
amount of the dividends. 2 It can thus be seen quite readily 
that the effect of such a company on the economy of the home coun¬ 
try would be very great. In addition there was formed a company 
to exploit the Dutch territories in the f/est Indies. This com¬ 
pany, while successful, could not hope to achieve such astounding 
results as those which could be obtained by the East India Company.

However, important as are the accomplishments of these trading 
companies, it must be realized that they were aided to a very 
considerable extent by the operations of the Msterdamsche Wissel- 
bank, founded in 1609. It might even be claimed that that insti¬ 
tution was of prime importance because it enabled the merchants 
of all Europe to deal in a common currency, drafts on the bank, 
instead of in terms of the multitude of various coins then to be 
found on the continent.. Then too, its activities as a credit 
agency gave to The Netherlands the reputation of being a place 
where funds for promising enterprises could be obtained* 

By 1700 the French and the British ivere in a better position 
to compete against Holland in world trade than they had been pre¬ 
viously, and throughout the eighteenth century the latter found 
her commercial pov^rer declining. The French revolution and the 
subsequent Napoleonic period brought her fortunes very low. At 
this time, too, Britain was in the midst of an era of extremely 
rapid industrial expansion* Again Holland was in an inferior posi¬ 
tion, in that the natural resources so necessary to industrialization, 
coal and iron, were lacking in the country. Consequently her economic 
recovery^ was very slow. But clear-sighted leadership on the part 
ofWilliam I, the first ruler of the United Netherlands, gradually 
overcame the conservative ideas of the former commercial leaders 
and stimule.ted afresh the spirit of enterprise* A new company was

formed to take the place of the United East India Company, and 
this organization worked directly with the Government in develop¬ 
ing the resources of the East Indies. Unfortimately, there was 
founded the Culture System, whereby the Government exploited the 
Far East without giving the subject peoples any protection of their 
rights; but this period passed. With the improvement in transport 
consequent upon the opening of the Suez Canal and with the develop¬ 
ment of the sugar and tobacco industries, trade was still further 
stimulated. Other policies fostered by William I were those of 
charging the minimum port dues possible in Dutch seaports, and 
of free trade; Duties on manufactured goods were held down to 
8 per cent, while semi-finished goods and raw materials were 
allowed into The Netherlands duty-free. All these things, com¬ 
bined with the renewed enterprise of the merchants enabled the 
country to regain some of its former greatness in commerce. One 
of the chief gains was in the transit trade to the industrial 
regions of Germany and France; another in ocean transportation. 

Such a cursory glance at the history of Dutch commerce 
cannot give any true idea of the magnitude of the operations in¬ 
volved. Nevertheless it suffices to point out the background, the 
foundation upon which the present-day trade structure is built. 

During the inter-war period, Holland was playing an 
important role in the foreign trade of Europe. Rotterdam and 
its ”New Waterway" was busy as a transit port where goods from

abroad were started up the Rhine in the vessels especially adapted 
to that traffic* Transportation extended as far up the river as 
Basel. On the downstream journey, finished goods were carried for 
transhipment abroad. An entrepot trade was also to be found at 
the port. However, the main entrepot port for the products of 
the Netherlands East Indies was Amsterdam, There were the huge 
warehouses from which the tropical raw materials were auctioned 
to the world markets. But in addition to this type of business, 
Holland had expanded her industrial potential. Of the people 
engi-ged in trade and industry, 39? were in manufacturing as com¬ 
pared to 20? in agriculture and 25% in trade and transportation; 
and of the products exported, about 60% were manufactures. ^ 

Among the producers of these commodities were to be found such 
names as Phillips i,nd Unilever, names still of world-vdde sig¬ 
nificance, Agriculture, too, was of great importance. 

' It is of some interest to note that this activity is 
carried on by a nation of about 9 million people, living in a 
country of only 13,000 square miles, a good deal of which is be¬ 
low sea-level. It must also be remembered, however, that a good 
part of the economy is dependent upon the Netherlands East Indies, 
and its 70 millions of people as well as upon the ?/est Indies, 
although the latter arenot of such great importance. —

It would be well to look at the population figures for 
Canada before considering her growth as a trading nation. Accord¬ 
ing to the Census of 1941> the population was llj million, the 
area million square miles, 1 The relative economic value 
of certain parts of Canada’s vast areas must be borne in mind* 
Canada, as opposed to The Netherlands has no dependencies. 

The Position held by Canada in international trade has 
become increasingly important. During world War II this impor¬ 
tance was even more strongly emphasized as Canada took a leading 
part in supplying the instruments of war to the allies in Europe. 
Prior to the war Canada was the fifth trading nation of the world 
so far as total merchandise transactions are concerned, being 
actually ahead of The Netherlands in this respect. When trade is 
computed on a per capita basis, it is seen that Hollandhas been 
in a superior position to Canada, Just before the outbreak of 
hostilities Canada had slipped from the fourth ranking held in 
1929 to eighth, with Holland still near the top. The composition 
of exports from and imports into Canada has changed just as radi¬ 
cally as the total figures since Confederation. Exports of raw 
materials were about 30^ of the total, partly manufactured goods 
30 ^ and fully manufactured 40^ in 1942' as compared to the extremely 
high proportion of raw materials in earlier days. Imports too have 
changed so that only about 60 ^ are now fully manufactured, 2

Canada has increased in status to that of a middle power, 
with representation on many of the sub-committees of the United 
Nations Organization and special agencies sponsored by it® For 
example, she is on the directorate of the International Monetary 
Fund andthe International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 
with almost the same voting strength as The Netherlands» She is 
also taking an active part in the Food and Agricultural Organiza¬ 
tion* Previously to this, Canada had already shown great interest 
in the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, 
an agency which dealt with the immediate problems to be met whoi 
areas occupied by the enen^r powers were liberated* As a member 
of these various groups, Canada is assuming a more important 
place in world affairs; as a trading nation she is assuming a 
more important place in international trade* 

In the years immediately before World War II,The Netherlands 
had ranked from eighth to tenth in the list of countries to which 
Canada exported and from fourteenth to twenty-second in the list 
from which Canada imported, j. From the point of view of The 
Netherlands, Canada was not of consequence as a market for Dutch 
products and did not appear in the list of leading countries* As 
a source of imports, however, Canada stood between ninth and four¬ 
teenth* 2

The mutual trade of these two countries has in the past been of 
sufficient importance to warrant a more careful examination. It 
is the purpose of this study to carry out that investigation. 

The first requirement is a detailed review of the trade 
between Canada and The Netherlands during the fifteen years prior 
to World War II. This shouldmake it possible to pick out the main 
trends in ttePre-war commerce. Since the War itself has had great 
repercussions on the Dutch economy, it will be necessary to see 
precisely what those effects are. Then, too, the consequence of 
post-war aid which has been extended to Holland must be examined 
in the light of the short-run changes which it might bring about 
in the economic relations between the two countries. In view of 
the fact that some of the aid has been in the form of loans, the 
long-run effects must also be considered. Finally, the political 
situation in The Netherlands proper ardin the other parts of the 
Dutch Empire must be reviev/ed, because of the bearing which those 
conditions might have on the future of Holland in her trading 
relations with Canada,

SECTION I 


Study of Trade Between 
Canada and The Netherlands 
1924-1940 

This section, mainly statistical in character, is designed 
to show the trading relations of the two countries in some detail. 
The period used is chosen on the basis of world economic conditions; 
by 1924 the immediate effects of the First World War had ^most dis¬ 
appeared and the business recession of 1922-1923 had ceased to exert 
any great direct influence on trade. The cut-off date, 1940, marks 
the entry of The Netherlands into the Second 'World War; Canada, of 
course, had already been at war with the Axis Powers for eight 
months but some trade was still being carried on with Holland. 

1. Definitions 

Before going further it is necessary to define some of the 
terms which are to be used frequently. *> The Netherlands ” will mean 
that part of the continent of Europe which is commonly shown on maps 
as 'The Netherlands' or 'Holland'; overseas portions of the Kingdom 
of The Netherlands are not included in the term. This is in accor¬ 
dance with the terminology of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics. 
"' Imports: Valuation ' - 'Imports' means 'Imports entered for Con¬ 
sumption'..... Under the main provisions of the law, the value of 
merchandise imported into Canada is the fair market value or price 
thereof when sold for home consumption in the principal markets of 
the country from which, and at the same time T?dien, said merchandise

the price to jobbers and wholesalers generally, nor less than the 
actual cost of production at the time of shipment plus a reasonable 
advance for cost of selling andprofit. For Customs entry purposes, the 
value on the currency of the country of export is converted to Cana¬ 
dian currency at exchange ratios as authorized by law and Orders

exported includes Canadian products or manufactures, also exports of 

commodities of foreign origin which have been changed in form or 

enhanced in value by further manufacture in Canada,.The value of 

exports of Canadian merchandise is the actual cost or the value at 

the time of exportation at the points in Canada whence consigned for

export.”/ With regard to the country to which trade is credited, 
it will suffice to say that imports are classified as received from 
the country from whence the goods were consigned to Canada and thus 
not necessarily the country of origin. Exports are credited to the 
country of final destination if that is known, otherwise to the 
country in which theconsignee resides. 

The statistical study will begin with a consideration of total 
trade figures, Canadian exports to The Netherlands being the start¬ 
ing point. These data will be checked against Dutch ones when such

are available, Canadian imports from Holland will then be accorded 
parallel treatment. In order to see what proportion of each other’s 
trade the two countries enjoy, a table showing the total trade with 
all countries will be introduced. The trends indicated by the 
figures will be examined and discussed in the light of such con¬ 
temporary events aS the signing of trade treaties, the onslaught 
of the Depression of the early 1930’s and changes in general mone¬ 
tary exchange policy. Following this, a more detailed study of 
commerce by Customs Groups and selected specific commodities can 
be carried out to advantage. Certain of the more important trends 
will be indicated, 

2. Total Trade Data 

The first item for investigation is that of the total of 
Canadian exports consigned to The Netherlands, The data are given 
in Table A below. The figures for Canada deal only with Canadian 
produce. Foreign produce shipped out of thecountry again is not 
included. While this might lead to some discrepancy between the 
Canadian and Dutch figures, the detailed breakdown of Canadian and 
’Foreign® e^^orts is not available for the full period under dis¬ 
cussion, andit is therefore considered advisable not to use the 
’Foreign’ exports for any of the years. The exchange ratios used 
to convert the guilder totals into Canadian dollar equivalents are 
shovm in Appendix A,

The most stiking feature of the comparison of the Dutch and 
Canadian dollar totals is the great difference between them. It 
must be noted first that the guilder totals are rounded off to the 
nearest thousand. This alone will cause the dollar equivalents to 
be inaccurate and the last three figures in thedollar quotations 
are, therefore, not significant. Further, it is necessary to rea- 
lize that the exchange rates used are year averages, while the trade 
in goods is not necessarily evenly distributed throughout that 
period; this error in weighting causes still more inacciiracy. 
However, these discrepancies do not account for the very large 
differences in the totals. In most eases the Netherlands imports 
of Canadian goods appear to be much smaller than the corresponding 
Canadian exports to The Netherlands, The variation between the two 
is generally attributable to the great transit and entrepot trade 
carried on by Dutch merchants. This will be examined in detail 
later. Relative valuation methods and shipping costs probably serve 
to increase the discrepancies. There have been years, namely 1936 
and 193B, when the difference lies on the other side. In fact there 
is much greater correspondence between Canadian andDutch figures 
for the whole period 1936-193^ than during the preceding part of the 
study. This can be laid in some measure to the shipment of Canadian 
grain by way of the American ports so that the e3$)ort is credited by 
the Dominion to the United States of Merica; but the Dutch give

credit for the import to Canada. However, no full explanation of 
this tendency towards correspondence can be readily derived from 
the data available. 

Now the total imports from Holland will be studied, 
following which it will be possible to compare them with the ex¬ 
ports so that a picture of the balance of trade may be obtained.

Netherlands Data/ 


It should be noticed immediately that the differences be¬ 
tween Canadian and Dutch figures in regard to Canada's imports from 
The Netherlands are not of such relative magnitude as the differences 
in the export statistics® The factors of rounding of numbers and 
inaccurate weighting in exchange ratios operate as before to distort 
the results® It is of interest to note that the dollar equivalents 
obtained from the use of the ratios found in Appendix A, supplied 

by the Bank of Canada, are not the same as the corresponding ones 

3 

in reports in the Commercial Intelligence Journal,/ There is still 
a general unbalance to be accounted for. This can be mainly attri¬ 
buted to the fact that a good deal of the vegetable oils imported 
from Holland go by way of England or Belgium, because of tanker 
movements® Dutch Customs officials credit the export to the United

The Netherlands in 1939” 

3. This is primarily due to the use of different^ exchange rates in 
making the conversions, for example, the rate quoted by theBank of 
Canada as the average for the year 193S is slightly over 55 cents 
Canadian to the Dutch guilder; in the Commercial Intelligence 
Journal the figure given in an article dealing with trade with The 
Netherlands for that period is 53i cents.

The Netherlands, The discrepancy^ then, is mostly due to the 
differences in Customs treatment by the two countries. 

These totals for mutual trade having been presented in 
tabular form, it is no?/ advisable to show them graphically in order 
that they may be the more readily comprehended. Because the Cana¬ 
dian data are available for the whole time under review and the 
Dutch not, the former will be used. The divergence between the 
two national sets of statistics must still be borne in mind. When 
the relative proportions of each other^s trade enjoyed is examined 
further on, it ?dll be possible to compare once again the extent 
to which the figures disagree. The discussion of the relationship 
of Canada's exports to The Netherlands to her imports from The 
Netherlands must also be deferred until the pertinent numerical 
facts have all b een brought forward.

1925 , 193551936 , 1937 , 193 s* The total figures used are those 
given under , the breakdown by Customs groups in the Dutch

cussion of trade by countries did not correspond exactly with 
those presented in the Table. In that the information by 
Customs groups is that used by the Commercial Intelligence

It is unfortunate that the statistics fromThe Netherlands 
are not completej but enough data are available in the Dutch parts 
of Tables A and B, and in Table D to indicate themost important 
trends and to act as a check on the Canadian figures* By combining 
the material of all four Tables, certain significant relationships 
come to light. The comparisons to be made are four in number* 

The first is the percentage of total Canadian exports going to The 
Netherlands during the period 1924 to 1940, the second the percen¬ 
tage of total Dutch imports supplied by the Dominion during that 
time, the third the percentage of Canada*s total imports supplied 
by Holland and fourth, the percentage of the total exports of The 
Netherlands going to Canada, 

The method to be used in determining these percentages is 
of sufficient moment to warrant a fairly close scrutiny. The ob¬ 
vious and simple way in which to obtain the proportion of Canada’s 
total exports which have been sent to Holland is to divide the 
total export figure given by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics 
into the exports actually credited to The Netherlands by that same 
source, and then to express the answer as a percentage. In 
column 1 of Table E (the first of the four relationships required) 
this procedure has been followed. Following this and enclosed in 
brackets, there appears a figure which is smaller than theother 
in all but two cases. This is a more correct statement of the trade 
relationship. The total export figure for the Dominion remains

the same for each year as in the previous method; the amount of 
the exports to Holland is taken,not from the Canadian sources, 
but from the Dutch figures of Canadian goods entered for consump¬ 
tion in that country. The effect of this action is that allowance 
is made for goods originally consigned to The Netherlands which 
have later been diverted to the transit or entrepot trades. It 
must be borne in mind, however, that the corrected percentage is 
still liable to a rather wide margin of error, caused by such 
things as the roxmding off of guilder totals and incorrect con¬ 
versions to dollars due to the use of average data for the full 
year, as mentioned earlier in connection with TableA. In addition, 
cognizance must be taken of the fact that some Canadian goods 
pass to Holland by way of the British entrepot trade. But by and 
large this corrected percentage does represent the proportion of 
Canadian goods going to Holland somewhat more accurately. It 
must be realized that goods handled by the Dutch, goods moving 
by virtue of Dutch enterprise, are as important to the Canadian 
economy as though they were actually entered for consiimption in 
The Netherlands. 

in column 2 of the Table the percentage of the total imports 
of Holland supplied by Canada is shown. Two methods of determina¬ 
tion are readily apparent, the one to compare Canada’s exports to 
The Netherlands (as shown by Canadian Customs figures) with the 
total imports of that country (necessarily taken fromDutch statis¬ 
tics) ; the other to compare the goods credited to Canada by the

Dutch to their total imports. The latter is the way adopted as it 
seems to represent the dealings more precisely. If the first method 
were used, the general condition would be to give Canada credit 
for supplying a greater part of the needs of Holland than she had 
actually done from 1924 to 1940, 

Column 3 deals with the percentage of the total imports 
of Canada supplied by The Netherlands, Reference back to Table B 
shows that there is a considerable difference between the Canadian 
and Dutch treatments of the movement of goods from Holland to the 
Dominion, Consequently the two procedures outlined above present 
themselves once more. To gain both consistency and accuracy, the 
data of column 3 are arrived at by comparing the quantities of 
imports into Canada which were credited to The Netherlands ivith 
Canada's total imports, both sets of figures coming from Dominion 
statistics. 

The percentages shown in column 4 are those of the total 
Netherlands exports which were sent to Canada during the years 1924 
to 1940 , Unfortunately the data are incomplete so that the per¬ 
centages for the years 1926 and 192? cannot be shorn, Themethod 
chosen as the more accurate measure of proportionate trade is to 
compare the exports of The Netherlands, based on Canada’s imports 
from there, with the total Netherlands exports as given in the 
official Dutch publications. The limitations to exactness which 
were considered in the discussion of theother three columns still

The years 1936 and 193S are the two, mentioned previously, in 
which the corrected percentages are greater than the figures 
obtained by using Canadian data for the exports to The Netherlands 
The reason is that Dutch figures show a larger import frcm Canada 
than the Dominion claims to have exported to Holland in the 
years mentioned.

In essence, column 1 states the importance of The Nether¬ 
lands to Canada as a place to which Canadian goods have been 
shipped; column 2, on the other hand, states how important Canada 
has been to The Netherlands as a place from which she has obtained 
supplies. The items in column 3 show the significance of |Iolland 
as a supplier of Canadian wants in the aggregate; those in column 
the place which the Dominion holds as a market for Dutch exports. 
The clearest way in which to see these relationships is to view 
them diagrammatically and for this purpose. Chart 2 is presented 
immediately below. In order to prevent confusion, columns 1 and 2 
are plotted together and alongside them columns 3 and 4* In that 
the first two columns deal with the movement of Canadian goods to 
The NetheVlands and the other two with the passing of Dutch goods 
to Canada, it is felt that the division of the graph as given is 
the most logical one to use here. It is a simple enough matter to 
transpose the curves mentally if other relationships are desired.

Chart 2 


Relative Importance in Their Mutual Trade 
of 1 

Hanada and The Netherlands/ 





























































































































































































































































































































































































































- 19 - 


The percentages in all the columns are derived from trade 
totals for which no correction has been made for changes in the 
general price level« Such correction is not necessary to es¬ 
tablish the figures, although it is essential to an explanation of 
the variations to realize the effect which relatively small changes 
in the price level of other countries might have on the amount of 
trade between the two nations whose mutual relations are being 
studied. 

The changes in the proportion of Canadian goods sent to The 
Netherlands compared to the total Dominion exports (i,e. Column 1) 
have been relatively great from year to year, Canada’s relative 
trade with Holland declined to low points in 1930, 1934 and 1937* 

It should be noted that the proportional drop as well as theactual 
fall was smaller in each succeeding decline. This can be ob¬ 
served from the graph which is presented on semi-logarithmic 
rulings. The most obvious thing about the diagram is the close 
correlation between the movements of the curve for column 1 and 
that for column 2, the latter portraying what share of the total 
imports of Holland have been supplied by Canada, It is, however, 
apparent that the changes in the curve for column 2 are rather 
greater than in the other. In obtaining the data for the two 
columns, the dividend remains the same in both cases, only the 
divisor changing. The divisor for the first is the total Canadian 
exports for the particular year, for the second the total Dutch

imports for the year. In that the curves for the two sets of quo¬ 
tients are quite similar and move always in the same direction, 
it would seem to be indicated that the totals of Canadian exports 
and Dutch imports move under the same general influences of world 
trade, 

In addition to the general trends, certain disturbing 
influences may be found from time to time. Although the reasons for 
changes in trade are to be given detailed attention later, it might 
be of interest to point out that one of the greatest causes of the 
drop in Canada's relative position in 1930 was the competition in 
wheat offered by Russia in that year, a rivalry which caused the 
Dominion to lose a large part of her Dutch market for that period, 

A contributing factor in the fall of 1934 may have been the effect of 
the "^^Vheat mixing law” passed by The IMetherlands in her recovery 
programme. Although first brought into force in 1931^ the law 
became more stringent as time passed and the proportion of home¬ 
grown wheat which had to be included in flour was increased. 

The curves for columns 3 and 4 do not indicate the same 
correspondence as do the other two. The solid line in this section 
of the graph, portraying the relative importance of Dutch goods in 
the total of those imported by Canada, has a fairly steady trend, 
with Holland becoming slightly more important to theCanadian im¬ 
porter from 1924 until about 1935. From that time on, the tendency 
has been for Holland's position to decline rather more quickly than 
it had been increasing in the earlier years. The broken line gives

the record of the importance of Canada as a purchaser of part of 
the total exports of The Netherlands. Although there are minor 
variationsjthe main trend from 1928 seems to be dowiward. Canada 
was becoming less and less important to The Netherlands as a 
place to which a share of the country’s exports could be sent. 

This does not necessarily imply a lack of interest by the Dutch in 
the possibilities offered by the Canadian market; policies outside 
their control may have affected the amount of goods which Canada 
was willing to take. For example, besides the overall effects of 
the Depression, the Empire Preference scheme of 1932 might have 
been one of the contributing factors in the decline from 1932 to 
1933 and 193A« A study of the Canadian statistics sho?fs the 
proportion of textiles coming from Holland relative to total im¬ 
ports of textiles as declining whilst the portion coming from the 
United Kingdom was greater. Textiles have formed a high percen¬ 
tage of all those articles which were exported to Canada by The 
Netherlands during the pertinent period. It is not the present 
purpose to delimit the effect of different factors but merely to 
point out some of the possibilities. Because data are not 
available for 1926 and 192? the results cannot be as conclusive 
as those for column 3# 

Although the trade relations between Canada and Holland 
are the subject of our study and consequently of the greatest 
interest to us, the fact must still be borne in mind that for 
neither country is the other the most important one insofar as

trade is concerned. It would be well to look at some of the per¬ 
centages of trade with other nations before passing on to other 
matters. For example in the year 1936, of Holland's total foreign 
trade (i.e. exports and imports added), Germany's share was 20^, 
Great Britain's lk% and Belgium's 12^; these three co\mtries held 

46 ^ of the total trade. In 1935, the figures had been 23?, 14? and 
1 

10? respectively. / The general position before the second World 

War was that the Dutch imported more from the Germans than from 

anyone else and exported more to Great Britain than elsewhere. 

Canada's position is somevdiat the same. The United Kingdom and 

The United States have been Canada's best customers and the most 

important sources of her imports. In 1936 the United States took 

42 ? of Canada's exports, provided 57? of the imports. The figures 

2 

for Britain were 3S? and 21? respectively. / These illustrations 
suffice to show that the trade ofCanada and Holland with each 
other is of quite minor importance so far as the totals are con¬ 
cerned. 

The influences which might affect the relative position of 
of one country in the trade of another are manifold and it is not 
easy to isolate each one. However, some will be dealt with in 
the consideration of changes in the total trade between Canada and

Holland and stilJ. others when the more detailed study of trade by 
important commodities is undertaken. 

3. Changes in Total Trade 

At this stage, the discussion of the changes and trends in 
total trade between the two nations may be introduced. The purpose 
will be to examine the extent to which various economic and non¬ 
economic forces may have affected those totals. 

The first requisite is to eliminate the effect of price 
changes over time. This can be done through correcting the total 
figures for any given year by means of an index number of prices. 

In the case of our study the index used is that published by the 
Dominion Bureau of Statistics in its "Trade of Canada", Further, 
the series of totals to be considered is that based, not on the 
Calendar Year which has been employed so far, but on the Fiscal 
Year, The data utilized are all taken from the Canadian sources 
and represent the summation of figures from the detailed commodity 
study which is the special problem in the second part of Section I, 
The Fiscal Year is the year ending March 31st of any given year. It 
thus includes the last three quarters of a calendar year and the 
first quarter of the succeeding one. It is unfortunate that the 
requisite data are not available on the calendar year basis for 
the results are rendered no longer strictly comparable with those 
already presented, A full discussion of the problem of the index 
numbers along with the actual figures used in the computations is

given in Appendix B« The total exports of Canada to The Nether¬ 
lands and her total imports from there are to be foiind in Appendix 
C; also shown are the totals corrected to the base year which is 
1926 , This appendix is the aggregation of the Customs Group and 
commodity information contained in Appendix D which follows it. 

It has also been necessary to limit the data to the Canadian sources 
as the Dutch statistics are given for the Calendar Year, are not 
accessible for the full period under review, and are listed under 
customs classifications which cannot be readily adapted to fit into 
the Canadian groupings. However, when the particular commodities 
are discussed the Netherlands figures will serve as a check. 

The total exports of Canada to The Netherlands, expressed 
as "actual values" (the Customs figures as quoted by the Dominion 
Bureau of Statistics) and as "corrected values" (the aggregate of 
the Customs Group figures which have been converted by means of 
an index number into terms of 1926 dollars) are shown below in 
Table F.

With but tvo exceptions, the 'corrected values* follow the 

'actual values* in directions. In the fiscal year 1934 the 'correc 

ted value* of exports showed a decline while the 'actual value* 

increased 5 that is, there was really a decrease in volume of trade 

to The Netherlands in that year although the value x^ent up from 

the previous one. The other exception is in the year 1939 when 

the import fig’ires show a decrease in the dollar values but it is 

indicated by the 'corrected value* that the volume of imports from 

Holland had 5.n reality gone up. These two cases having been 

noted, it is well to see what general movements took place in the 

exports of Canada to The Netherlands and her imports from there^ 

From 1925 to 1928 exports credited to Holland 5,ncreased 

ranidly then nlummetted by 1931 to an even lower figure than at 
1 

the early date./ The drop to the position given for 1931 is s 
reflection of conditions during nine months of 1930 and only the 
first three of 1931* This decline was followed by a slow upsurge 
to 1934 in the Customs statistl.cs or 'actual values*, the vcluime 
of trade (indicated by 'corrected values') increasing very rapid¬ 
ly to 1928 levels with some slacking off in 1934® A slump to 
even lower dollar values and volume occurred by 1936, followed by 
tx^o years of recovery and then another recession in the fiscal 

1, The fact that these data are based on the fiscal year should 
be remembered in making a comparison with the curves shown in 
Charts 1 and 2,

year ended March 31, 1939, although the volume of trade did not 
change in such great proportions as the ’actual values’* 

The import curves do not show such violent and abrupt changes® 
As one of the reasons for this it sho\ald be borne in mind that the 
export statistics given here include those items which were handled 
by the Dutch in their transit and entrepot trades as well as those 
items which were actually entered for consumption* Therefore, the 
export figures reflect conditions and official policies in countries 
ether than The Netherlands« The Import figures are for those Dutch 
co.mmodities which were brought into Canada for consumption, although 
a small part may have been re-exported by Canadians* A gradual in* 
crease took place in the imports from 1925 until 1930, followed 
by a decrease until 1934« The dollar figure in 1934 was far below 
the 1926 one but the volume did not diverge to as great an extent* 
The fiscal year 1935 saw an increase in trade with the ’actual 
value’ still below the 1925 level* From then until 1939 there was 
a gradual but steady decline. 

Before passing on to a consideration of the reasons for these 
var5.ations note should be taken of the way in which the importance 
of Holland as a customer for Canadi-an exports has changed from year 
to year, these fluctioations in importance being then compared to 
Canada’s actual exports to there (not forgetting that the data for 
Chart. 3 include all commodities consigned to Holland). It is seen 
by this comparison, a stmultaneous study of Charts 2 and 3, that

Canada’s share in the trade of The Netherlands has moved in the 
same direction as her total exports credited to that nation* The 
timing, however, has not been exactly the same* 

The great decline in the fiscal years 1930 and 1931 can he 
said in general to be due to the onslaught of the Depression ai.- 
though other factors must also be allotted their share in the change 
In addition to the drop in actual dollar valiies, there was a notable 
falling off in the volume of trade as well* Many causes lay behind 
this* The first drop was in great part due to the decline in the 
transit trade* The falling off of the prices for products of 
The Netherlands East Indies affected the industries of Holland 
itself because the Indies were so important a part of the Dutch 
export markets, the net effect being that less money was available 
for the purchase of Canadian goods* The income from Dutch bottoms 
was curtailed sharply, with 1930 (the calendar year) being the 
worst in the country's history to that date. And finally, and 
closest to home for the Dutch, the agriculture of the country 
felt the stsTt of the Depression very badly, due partly to over¬ 
production and more immediately to the loss of very important 
foreign markets which latter was caused by the restrictive, national 
istic measures brought into force by customers of consequence, of 
whom Germany was the neatest* To some extent the effect of the 
Depression on the amount of Canadian goods taken by The Netherlands 
was ameliorated by the fact that the guilder was not depreciated

until late in 1936, whereas there had been a devaluation of the 
Canadian dollar in 1931* In spite of teiaporary gains, the picture 
tended to be very dark from the point of view of Canada* The Dutch 
agricilturist had to be helped because of the loss of his markets 
in Germany and Belgium, all this to the disadvantage of tbs Cana¬ 
dian farmer who could no longer sell as much grain to Holland as 
previously* ’’Production subsidies, milling regulations, excise 
and processing taxes, Sjoport monopoly fees, marketing regulationj^ 
price fixing, and control of production as well as import quotas, 

were among the measures taken by the liberty-loving Dutch in this

Mixing law” of July 4, 1931 may be given* In the beginning it be¬

too, suffered badly* 

III addition to the indirect effects on Canada’s exports 
to The Netherlands brought about by the general conditions of 
the Depression, there were other factors at worko The ffioneta3?y 
policy of various countries and the resiiltant bilateral agree¬ 
ments, based sometimes on financial grounds, sometjjnes on politi¬ 
cal, contributed to the. changes in trade during the 1930’s* 

Insofar as monetary policy is concerned, the most notable 
feature is the tenacity with which Holland clung to the gold 
standard. Great Britain devalued sterling by leaving the gold 
standard in 1931| countries to whom the United Kingdom was an 
important customer followed suit in order to keep the trade that 
was so necessary to them| Canada, Influenced by both London and 
New York depreciated to a position about midway between the 
British pound and the American dollar. In April 1933, the United 
States devalued the dollar until it was once more at approximately 
the old ratio with sterling| the rate was not absolutely stable 
at that figure. Throughout this period, the guilder remained 
firmly tied to gold at the old par. On September 26j 1936, the 
government of The Netherlands announced a ban on the export of gold, 
following this a few days later with the setting up of a currency 
stabilization fund. The Netherlands Bank was relileved of the obli¬ 
gation of redeeming its notes in gold, but exports under license 
were still allowed. The result was that the guilder depreciated 






- 33 - 


in terms of oth^r currencies* This action was taken at the same 
time that France and Switzerland, the only other remaining gold« 
standard nations in Europe left the standard* 

What were the facts of these various monetary policies, 
particularly as regards any influence they might have had on 
Holland’s trade with Canada? To begin with, the guilder could 
command a greater amount of Canadian currency end consequently 
(and in addition to changes brought about by the lowering of prices 
common to the time) of Canadian-made goods or Canadian grown 
commodities* This advantage to The Netherlands could not be long- 
lived if the guilder were to be kept at a stable rate at the same 
time that gold would of necessity be flowing from the country* This 
was so because the exchange ratio so favourable to Dutch buyers pre¬ 
cluded Dutch sellers from selling in Canadian markets as well as 
in other markets of the world. The only other alternative, and 
one which was not politically feasible, was to lower the standard 
of living in Holland so that Dutch goods could be offered at 
prices which could overcome the exchange differential when the 
guilder was compared to other currencies* Some of the restriction- 
ist policies mentioned in the discussion of the Depression generally 
were brought into being to combat the results of the retention of 
the gold standard* For example, attempts were made to solve the 
problem by the reduction of unemployment through subsidizing 
domestic industry, subsidies paid for by taxes on import monopolies

set up under government aegis. It is perhaps significant that 

after the devaluation of the guilder Holland's export trade revived 

greatly. However^ on this po5nt the Governor of the Netherlands 

Bank, speaking at the annual meeting at which the report for the year 

ended March 31# 1936 was presented, was not willing to concede 

that all the improvement was due to the severance from gold, but 

that a goodly part of the better conditions was the result of 

expansion of vrorld production, higher freight rates for ocean 

1 

shipping, improved business in the Netherlands Indies. / Cana« 
dian exports on Dutch account climbed steadily during the fiscal 
years 1931”1934 although the amounts shown as entered for consump¬ 
tion moved rather erratically. The steady decline in imports 
into Canada from Holland pointed oi’t above may be explained at 
least in part by the monetary policy of The Netherlandsj other 
factors mast also be borne in mind in this respect however. 

The period of the 1930’s could almost be called the era 
of special a^eeroents. As each country in turn engaged in res¬ 
trictive policies, trade declined almost to the point of stag¬ 
nation and nations felt impelled to make bilateral arrangements 
with other nations in order to gain those items deemed necessary 
to the national economy. These agreements took many forms, most of 
them, designed to circumvent the general provisions of ordinary

commercial treaties, a good many of which contained ’most-favonred- 
nation* clausesSome treaties were drawn up on the basis of 

special commodity deals; most of them vrere conceived as a means 

of ensnring paj^nt for goods exchanged and for the servicing of 

foreign capital investments. 

As examples of the special commodity type of treaty those with 
the United States and Hungary may be mentioned» Both dealt with 
wheat and are doubly important therefore, because generally speaking 
the exports of Canada to The Netherlands move in accord with wheats 
In February, 1936, the U.S.A. concluded an agr-eement whereby Holland 
guaranteed to take annually no less than % of her total quantity 
of foreign milling wheat from Americao* The full terms of the 
treaty are not available so that the other side of the bargain 
cannot b® given» A treaty dealing with the use of American flour 
was also signed, Tn July of the same year, Hungary and The Nether*^ 
lands concluded their agreements By it, Holland undertook to buy 
100,000 tons of the Humgarian crop of bread»wheat for that year 
within twelve months» The deal was strictly bilateral however, 
as the proceeds were to be used for the discharge of Netherlands 
credits to Hungarian firms (15% of the total proceeds) and the rest 
-for the purchase of Dutch goods® It is of interest to note that 
the treaty was not brought into force as the Hungarians were able to 
dispose of the crop more advantageously. In that the amount of 
grain involved was about 20% of the normal requirements of The 
Netherlands, it can be seen readily that such an agreement would

have worked considerable hardship on Canadian experts of wheat 
in that year® These two examples will serve to show the trend of 
commercial policy during the period, and to Illustrate the rigidi¬ 
ties which they can introduce into intematicnal trade» Also to 
be observed is the fact that commodity agreements were normally 
tied in with monetary compacts as vrell# 

As a rule these took the form of clearings agreements and by 
/lugust of 193B, Holland had such arrangements with Bulgaria, Chile, 
Czechoslovakia, Germany, Italy, Rouraania, and Turkey as well as 
a special type of clearing account with Spain^ It should be men¬ 
tioned at this point that the only treaty existing between Canada 
and The Netherlands during this time was the Commercial Treaty of 
July 11, 1924 ? a document containing a mutual grant of the most¬ 
favoured-nation clause) no special monetary restrictions ex5,sted 
between the two nations and payments by foreign exchange were free) 
the fact that Holland operated on a single schedule tariff system 
was offset to Canada’s disadvantage by the arrangement of quotes 
\uider the treaties with other countries# The most notable of all 
the contracts mentioned Jjmediately above was that with Germany, 
letified in 1937?^« There were three main considerations behind such 
a treatys Crermany was one of the best customers of the Butch, 
second only to Brita5.n as a rule, and was the ma5-n source of 
their imports; there was the possibility, hj means of the arrange¬ 
ment, of increasing the exports of The Netherlands and her colonies)

Germany owed Holland 35 ndllion guilders on balance* The result 
of this compact was that Butch trad© was activated to some extent 
and by careful control of exports the German balance was reduced 
to 8 miilion guilders* The effect upon the e^qport of ecimnodities 
from Canada to Holland due in good measure to these various agree« 
ments has been pointed out already. 

Some attempts were mad® by various groups of Baltic and 
Western nations to lead the way back to multilateral trading and 
away from the web of bilateral agreements and unilateral restrictions 
which were designed to increase the political and commercial bar** 
gaining power of the country imposing them* One of the moving 
spirits of these attempts was Holland* The Ouchy Agreement of 1932 
between The Netherlands and Belgium was a step on the road to reduc¬ 
tion of tariffs I it was never carried into effect partly because of 
the attitude regard5.ng Imperial Preference at the Ottawa Confer¬ 
ence of the same summer* The most 5japressive endeavor vras made 
in the signing of the ”Oslo Agreement” of May 28, 1937* This 
convention, sometimes known as ”The Hague Agreement”, was designed 
to effect the removal of the quantitative limitations placed on 
trade by Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden 
and The Netherlands. Certain commodities were listed, Including 
a second group in the Dutch East Indies* Provision was made for 
the entry of Great Britain into the agreement as well* Britain 
did not come in, the recession of 1937 supervened and the agree¬ 
ment was ended within the year*

In addition to those factors impeding Canada’s commerce al¬ 
ready emimerated, there were at the same time periods when various 
national trading monopolies entered the field of commerce spas¬ 
modically, selling on a market for a while then dropping out* 

This sort of competition was very disturbing to the price structure 
and in Canada’s staple exports was most distressing to the Canadian 
producer. One example, already mentioned, is that of Russia who 
in 193c and early 1931 came into the Dutch market with i-zheat and 
coarse grains at prices which Canada could not hope to match. In 
addition she sold rubber goods, such as running shoes, etc, (items 
of seme consequence to Dominion exporters) again at prices well 
below Canadian quotations. Nor was the Soviet the only state 
carrying out such a policy. Most of the special trading agree¬ 
ments signed at the time allowed the importer of the goods of a 
particular nation to re-export any surplus with little limitation 
on the pricing policy. This possibility, whether carried out or 
riot, was a threat to the ability of Canada to continue in the field 
of foreign ccmmerce with any certainty of good returns on her 
commodities. 

Naturally merchandise statistics in international trade 
tend to gain the greater share of attention since they are as a 
rule readily available and because commodity exchange is so funda¬ 
mental under the present standards of living. On the other hand 
the invisible items in the balance of trade tend to be overlooked.

We have noticed the declljie in Ihitch incoiros due to lowering of 

ocean freight rates and the reduced amount of goods carried« This 

was part of the reduction in national income of Holland and the 

results have been discussed# According to the Research Department 

of the Bank of Canada^ no estimates of the balance of payments 

between Canada and The Netherlands are available but the Dutch 

investments in Canada (G8.nadian bjsiness loans floated on the 

Amsterdam exchange^ etc*) net a return **probably not more than 

1 

about $1 million per annum.” / In addition there was an influx 
of ^hot money’ from Holland during the 1930’S| part of \^hich 
would h|j.ve been invested in Canada. There is, however, no clear 
evidence that the amount of bona fide Dutch money was large| much 
of it was unduubtedly refugee money from the interior of the 
Continent* 

An attempt has been made above to present the most impor¬ 
tant conditions and events of the period from 1924 to early 1939 
in the light of the effects which they have exerted upon the 
exports of Canada-to The Netherlands and her imports from there* 
The complexity of the divergent stresses and strains caused by 
the various factors and the recognition of the fact that the trade 
between any two nations can be influenced greatly by developments 
elsewhere, have rendered it impossible tc allot to each factor, 
condition or event its due share in each f3.uctuation of the trade 
between the two countries.

4* Trade by Customs Groups 

From a study of the movements of total trade figures, yith 
the possible reasons for variations in them, it is necessary to 
pass on to an examination of the more detailed aspects of Canada’s 
dealings with Holland* Only in this way can the relative impor¬ 
tance of different products of the Dominion as applied to Dutch 
comir.ercs be determined! only in this way can the relative impor¬ 
tance of various Netherland goods in Canada’s economy be esta¬ 
blished* The statistics for the study of the trade by Customs 
Groups ere found in Appendix G, those for the actual commodity 
studies in Appendix D., Due to the lack of particular data from 
Holland it will net b^ possible to mal:e the careful comparisons of 
changes in trade desired; instead only the figures for ell the 
trade credited to The Netherlands can be considered, bearing in 
mind, with reference to previous data, that a good deal of the 
commerce so credited is carried on with the specific p’Jirpose of 
transmitting the goods further inland than the Dutch frontiers* 

To gain a knowledge of the place which each Ctistoms Group 
has held in the dealings between the two nations, it is necessary 
to see what percentage of the total export (import) credited to 
Holland is represented by that Group, To that end, Tables K and 
J, as calculated from Appendix C are given immediately below. For

The data presented in the foregoing tables are shown below 
in the form of bar diagrams for ease of comparison. Chart 4 por¬ 
trays the information in Table H, Chart 5 that in Table J, 
dealing with exports and imports respectively. Each bar is divided 
into the nine parts necessary to the purpose, but only those 
Customs Classifications representing a relatively large percentage 
of the trade throughout the period are marked distinctively. The 
remainder are merely given their proper Group number. 

f!he other way in -vshich this variation in the relative im¬ 
portance of the different classifications could be shown is to 
have the vertical axis of the chart marked, not in percentages but 
in dollars; to give for each year and each Group the actual value 
of commodities moving. This would illustrate the changes both in 
total trade and in the part played by each type of good. However, 
in view of the fact that a careful study has already been made of 
total figures and that some of theClassifications would disappear 
almost entirely in years when trade was at a low ebb if the actual 
value procedure were adopted, it is considered that the percentage 
method will prove more useful. It has therefore been chosen.

No detailed interpretation of the charts and the reasons for 
the variations in importance of each Group from year to year will 
be attempted, but some isolated instances will be explained in ' 

order to point out a few of the ways in which changes, even of con- ij 

II' 

siderable magnitude, may occur. The first instance to be 
examined is found in the export section, relating the years 1926 
and 1927* In 1927 the total exports credited to Holland were about 
|3 million greater than in the preceding year. Group I, Agricultural 
and Vegetable Products increased roughly $2j million,Group VI, 
Non-Ferrous Metals and Their Products increased almost $1 million. 

In spite of this, the percentage figure for the Agricultural Pro¬ 
ducts is lower in 1927 than in 1926 while the Non-Ferrous Metals | 

I 

show an inerease. The reason for this seemingly odd result lies ||| 

in the different levels at which the two classifications were found I 
in the earlier year. In 1926 the total exports in Group I were || 

about $19 million, in Group VI just over $2| million. The second | 

example deals with the changes between the fiscal years 1931 and 
1932. Here too an inerease in the total exports is seen, again of || 

some $3 million. Looking once more at the relationships of Groups | 

I and VI (the two most important groups in exports to the Nether- I 

lands prior to the Second World War), the percentage which each J 

I 

bears to the total is perceived to have increased from 1931 to 1932. | 

A study of the actual values for the two years reveals that both I

have increased* The total increase for the two Groups is just 
slightly greater than theincrease for all the Groups together. 

Thus the other Classifications, while not changing in gross value, 
have declined proportionately as the two under review have in¬ 
creased both in total value and in the percentage of theover-all 
total which they represent. The very opposite situation with re¬ 
gard to these same Groups is found in the changes from the year 
1938 to 1939* The case in which the percentage figure for tm 
Groups has declined in spite of the actual value of each increasing 
is seen by comparing Classifications I (Agricultural Products) 
and IV (Wood Products) for the years 1937 and 1938. In the period, 
the total value for all Groups has gone up and has done so to a 
greater extent than has either of the ones being examined, this 
relatively larger augmentation being the cause of the falling off 
in percentage for Groups I and IV despite the fact that both show 
larger totals in the second year. 

Many of the same conditions obtain in the import section of 
the study. The changes in the percentage of the total which are 
credited to any particular Customs Classification are more readily 
apparent in Chart which deals with imports than in Chart 4* 

This is because the proportion of traEie pertaining to each of the 
different types of commodity is not as disparate Ydth regard to the 
commodities which Canada imports from The Netherlands as with regard 
to those Tft^ich she e^qports.

A detailed stud 7 of the changes in trade must be left until 
later when selected commodities are to be considered. However, 
certain relationships are to be seen at the present stage* By 
and large. Group I was the most important Canadian export classifi¬ 
cation during the whole period, althoughGroup VI, dealing with 
the Non-Ferrous Metals became a serious rival during the more 
restricted period from 1934 on, the time of Germany’s great re¬ 
armament drive. Wood and its products, an export of great signi¬ 
ficance to Canada generally, did not figure importantly in the ex¬ 
ports to Holland although there was a trend toward rather more im¬ 
portance with the passage of time* As with Canada’s exports to The 
Netherlands, so with her imports from there. Agricultural and 
Vegetable Products were very significant. Fibres and Textiles from 
Holland showed up as being relatively more important than Canada’s 
exports of that Group, while some importance attached also to 
Dutch chemicals coming into theDominion, It must be realized 
that Groups which in the aggregate were rather unimportant were 
probably very useful insofar as the trade of individual Canadian 
and Dutch exporters and importers was concerned. 

No further discussion of the changes in trade by commodity 
groups will be carried out. The main point to bear in mind when 
considering changes in the proportion wiich any Group bears to 
the total is that the particular change may be due to many causes, 
and may not necessarily proceed from any significant alteration in

the individual item itself. For this reason it is well to study any 
case which is of special interest, with great care. 

5. Trade in Selected Commodities 

The study of the trade between Canada and The Netherlands 
before the second great conflict must be carried a step further; 
an investigation of selected commodities must be made so that some 
of the problems met in the ordinary course of international trade 
may be illustrated. The examination will deal first with goods which 
Canada exports and which have been credited to Holland, then with 
those imported from that country. Items will be considered in the 
order of the Customs Groups, but not necessarily in the order of 
the sub-classes within those clas sifications. Detailed infor¬ 
mation for this inquiry is included in Appendix D which also dis¬ 
cusses the way in which the Customs Groups are sub-divided. 

Under Classification I there are four items of interest: 
Grainf, Milled Products, Rubber Goods and Oilcake, Ihen it is 
realized that the sub-section 'Grains’ normally ran to about 85% 
or more of the Agricultural and Vegetable Products exported to The 
Netherlands, and that as shown in Chart 4 that Group represented 
from 50^ to 80'^% of all Canadian exports to Holland, the impor¬ 
tance of this particular sub-section is brought home most force¬ 
fully, Rather than split the subject down still further so that 
only wheat is studied, the sub-section will be taken as a whole 
although most of the emphasis will be upon the one special grain.

During the 1920*s the bulk of the home-grown wheat in The 
Netherlands was used for feed and jji the preparation of whole wheat 
flouro Bread flour was made aLmost exclusively from imported grain. 
Detailed statistics on the imports into Holland from Canada are not 
available here for the whole period and data must be pieced to¬ 
gether from the reports of Canadian Trade Commissioners stationed 
in The Netherlands, The fact that a good deal of grain from the 
United States went to the Dutch by way of Canadian ports and was 
credited by them to Canada, as well as sane of the grain from the 
Dominion being credited to the U.S. should be kept in mind. The 
figures given by the Dominion Bureau ofStatistics include grain 
destined to the industrial areas up the Rhine and as a consequence 
they, too, are inaccurate. 

During the calendar years 1929 and 1930 the Argentine was 

important in the Dutch market with the resultant drop in total 

Canadian trade, then late in 1930 Russia sent great quantities of 

wheat toiiotterdam, cutting out Canada still more. TheSoviet was 

dominating the market until the middle of 1931 and during the first 

half of that year, she supplied 50% of the wheat imported into 

1 

Holland, 90% of the rye, 2^ of the barley / and 4B% of the oats./ 

1. With regard to the barley credited to Canada by The Netherlands 
as high a proportion as 50% is said by the trade to come from 
the United States.

By 1932 Russia had retired from the grain market in Holland, and the 
quantity of Canadian grains shot up to a level much higher,than in 
1931 . The volimie of wheat imported by the Dutch in 1934 was down 
about 30fo from the average of theprevious five years, mainly because 
of the operations of the Wheat Mixing Law, i/^ich set forth the fairly 
high proportion of home-grown wheat which had to be used in the 
flour. The Argentine was the chief source of wheat for Holland in 
1935> providing almost 60% of the country's requirements; Canada 
provided only 18^, As a comparison it should be noted (Chart I) 
that Canaria's total exports to The Netherlands in that year hit a 
new low. The next year, however, Canada had regained her premier 
position and supplied 55^ of the total taken. In 1937 both Argentina 
and the U.S, were active in the market, with and 24^ respectively 
Canada dropped to 21^. In that year, too, Romania, probably 
under the terms of the special clearing arrangements with Holland, 
had a 14^ share of the wheat imports o By 193B the-Americans had the 
greatest share of the business, and Russia had re-entered the lists, 
with the result that Canada was the third-place supplier. In 1939, 
partly due to the restrictions on shipping brought about by the Ifar, 
Canada had relinquished leadership to the United States and the ' 
Argentine, with France also providing a fairly large share of the 
Dutch import. In comparing the figures above with the data in Chart 
4, allov/ance must be made for the difference between the calendar 
years and the fiscal years which are used on the diagram.

Using Dutch statistics we see that in the years 1935 to 1939 
inclusive, the percentages which wheat comprised of all the imports 
credited as coming from Canada were 52, 77, 55, 32 and 35. A 
look at Chart 4 indicates that for the fiscal year 1936 (which 
means most of 1935 and the first quarter of 1936) Group I was not 
important, was in fact at the lowest point in the v«rhole period under 
survey. It would therefore seem that large quantities of the Non- 
Ferrous Metals were sent in transit to Germany for re-armament and 
stock-piling. 

Grains sent to Holland were important in Canadian statistics 
from 1924 on as indicated in Appendix D in the column showing the 
percentage of the total Canadian exports of them credited to that 
nation• 

Milled products, mainly flour, dropped in relative value in 
the 1930 's under the influence of the mixing law and the trend 
toward greater reliance on ’home industry*, the purpose of the 
latter being to stimulate employment in the days of the Depression. 

One of the more unlikely products in which the Netherlands 
market proved valuable to Canadian manufacturers, particularly in 
view of the large Dutch colonies in the Far East, was manufactured 
I rubber. The main items involved were pneumatic tire casings, inner 
tubes and some rubber and canvas shcBS. Just before the War, 
a decline in the importance of the Dutch outlets was indicated, 
with some attempts being made in Holland to improve the condition 


of local manufacture

The last sub-section to be noted in Group I is that of 
Oilcake andMeal* This commodity, not further sub-divided in the 
Customs statistics, was used as a feeding stuff for cattle by 
the Dutch, This was necessitated by their inability to grow 
enough for the large dairy industry of the country,The actual 
value of the exports to Hollajid varied considerably from year to 
year, the general tendency being strongly downward. The percen¬ 
tage figures also changed within mdde limits but even when the 
exports reached a fairly low level in the fiscal years 1936 andl93S, 
The Netherlands took 30^ of the total Canadian export. The industry, 
at least insofar as the foreign sales are concerned, declined 
consistently from 1925 onwards. Part of the regression was probably 
due to the increasing competition offered by Fishmeal producers 
in various countries including Canada. The Norwegian fishmeal 
could be sold in Holland at quite low prices and other nations 
also were quoting competitively in that market. 

Customs Group II deals with Animals andAiiinal Products, 
of which Mlk, Fats,Fish^ and Hides andLeather will be scrutinized 
more carefully. 

Considering that The Netherlands was at the time under dis¬ 
cussion one of the foremost dairying nations of Europe, it is 
strange to find that from 1925 until 1932 Canada had a large trade 
in condensed milk with the country. This product represented almost 
one half of the total commerce in theGroup, decreasing to one third 
only in 1931 and 1932, The greater part of it was for the entrepot

trade, destined eventually in all probability to The Netherlands 

East Indies. The chief Canadian supplier was a subsidiary of a 
1 

Dutch firm. / After 1932, the trade in milk was negligible, with 
no movements at all in a number of years. 

Fats and Fish Oils were of some consequence throughout the 
period, with the balance changing from one to the other with no 
apparent regularity although the fish oils tended to become the more 
important as time went on. Fish oil was one of the main Canadian 
items in the entrepot trade of The Netherlands. The proportion of 
fats and oils exported from the Dominion to Holland dropped towards 
the end of the period. 

The part of Canada’s exports of Fish which went to The 
Netherlands was hever great, but until the fiscal year 1936 it 
remained at a fairly consistent level, considering the changes in 
the price indices. Again the situation of a country fairly noted for 
some industry (in this case fishing, herring fishing specifically) 
importing the product of the same industry from, abroad is observed. 

In addition to the products entered in the Customs statistics fresh 
Canadian salmon also made its appearance with fair regularity in 
the Dutch shops. This was bought through the British entrepot 
' trade and is consequently shown as exported from Canada to Britain. 

It is probable that a portion of the canned Canadian fish actually 
entered the transit trade for Germany.

The trade in Hides and Leather varied a good deal from 
year to year, rising to large figures only in 1937 arid 1933. 
Occasionally manufactured goods of leather assiimed quite large 
proportions but normally the business transacted was in hides and 
unmanufactured leather. 

In absolute figures, the e^qDorts of Canadian textiles to 
Holland were low and unimportant. Proportionately, The Netherlands 
was just as important a market for those products of Canada as it 
was for the products of Group II, Animals and Animal Products. 
However, no textiles will be discussed in detail. 

Reference to Chart 4 will show that Customs Classification 
IV, Wood, Wood Products and Paper became an increasingly important 
part of the exports of Canada to Holland. Just how large a part 
of theDutch requirements were filled by Canada it is not possible 
to say with any precision because data are lacking, but the bulk 
of the raw material for the Netherlands paper industry came from 
the Scandinavian countries before the War. The relevant portion 
of Appendix D indicates that the share of The Netherlands in what 
forest products Canada did export became greater even though it 
never reached as much as J of 1% of the total. Up until the end 
of 1930, lumber and paper were the largest exports in the Group. 
Prom that time on wood pulp for the Dutch paper-making industry 
assumed first rank in the wood products going from Canada to 


Holland

Group V, Iron and Its Products, is another which has varied 
considerably from year to year both in the actual amount exported 
to Holland and in the share of the total exports to there which 
it has gained. The Dutch have taken as much as 3/4 of 1% of 
Canada's total exports to all countries of Group V; that was in 
the fiscal year 1933 when the trade in vehicles was particularly 
heavy. For themost part the share was well under l/3 of 1%, 

From 1930-32 household machinery (consisting almost entirely of 
electric vacuum cleaners and their parts) was the dominant item, 
but even before that the trade in this line waa active. No ob¬ 
vious reason for the abrupt termination of dealings in these 
machines can be found. The amount of trade was not switched over 
to any other country so that the possibilities of a change in 
method of handling from transit or entrepot to direct are pre¬ 
cluded, For the rest of the commerce in Iron, the commodity head¬ 
ing the list changed frequently, with farm machineiy leading quite 
often. Shortly before the commencement of the War, pigs and ingots, 
along with scrap, came to the fore. 

Of all the Groups of goods exported to Holland, only 
Group VI, Non-Ferrous Metals and Their Products, can claim any 
comparison with Agricultural Products, From 1934 onwards, this 
Group assumed greater and greater weight, Dutch statistics for 
transit trade throughHotterdam indicate that the better part of the 
Non-Ferrous Metals was actually transhipped to Gemany, The lead¬ 
ing metal for the whole period mth the exception of the fiscal year

1939 , was nickel which made up about 2/3 of the total in most 
years; at the time mentioned it was replaced by copper. Up uhtil 
the start of the Depression, zinc and lead shared second and third 
places; from that time on, second place was held by copper and the 
other two were relegated to lower positions. About half the nickel 
exported and credited to The Netherlands was refined, the remainder 
was in the form of nickel oxide or contained in matte. As mentioned 
before, the probable reason for the growth in importance of the 
share of the Non-Ferrous Group was the building up of the German 
military machine including the stockpiles necessary to the waging 
of a mechanized war. Some part undoubtedly is due to the recovery 
of the world from the business stagnation which had beset it, and 
some part to actually increased Dutch purchases, made for the 
strengthening of their national security. 

The item of note in the Non-Metallic Minerals, Group VII, 
is Asbestos. This product, mainly in the form of crude asbestos, 
ma.de up by far the greatest part of the trade in Group VII, Goal 
products occasionally made a slight contribution to the total. The 
amount of Non-Metallic Minerals credited to Holland varied from 
just over 1% to less than l/lO of 1% of the total exported to the 
world and in all the goods credited to The Netherlands alone, they 
exceeded 1% only one year in five. 

The exports of Canada to Holland under Group VIII, Chemicals 
andAllied Products, were very spotty before the War, The only 
product of any significance was toilet soap and there were years

when even that was not exported. However, the quantities were of 
sufficient magnitude to raise the proportion of trade represented 
by the Group over the 1% mark on a number of occasions. 

The trade in Miscellaneous Commodities, Group IX, was very 
limited. The only commerce of importance was in films for photo¬ 
graphers and moving pictures, and this dropped off badly in the 
fiscal year 1934^ never to recover. 

The consideration of those particular commodities which 
bulked largest in Canada’s exports to The Netherlands, the rise and 
fall in their amounts and relative positions leaves the impression 
that no simp].e answer is to be found to all those changes. They 
are the result of the influence of many conflicting factors, some 
operating from far outside the immediate surveillance of the ex¬ 
porters of the Dominion. Of these factors it is well to note such 

1 

ones as the boosting of the tariff rates in 193k}/ an action im¬ 
portant only to certain commodities from Canada; the much more 
effective setting of commodity quotas which served both to protect 
the domestic industries and to provide a bargaining point in the 
struggle to increase exports to other nations; the bilateral 

1. Holland operated on a single schedule tariff with no favours 
granted to special nations, the customs dues serving revenue 
rather than protective purposes. The increase in 1934 was from 
10^ to the new figure of 12% on most manufactured goods. On 
semi-manufactured materials the change was from free to a scale 
of 10^, 6% or 3%} depending on the degree of manufacture, Rav/ 
materials and foodstuffs remained on the free list.

trade and clearings agreements. Throughout the period commerce 
between Canada and The Netherlands was regulated only by means of 
the Trade Treaty of 1924 mentioned previously. Perhaps the best 

summation of the situation is the following quotation:."the bulk 

of the imports from Canada into The Netherlands is raw and semi¬ 
manufactured materials for further processing. The list of semi- 
and fully-manufactured goods is, however, gradually lengthening. 
Competition generally is keen, since Holland has but a single¬ 
column tariff of medium scope, and products from all lands reach 
this market on a more or less equal footing. The domestic industry, 
buying raw materials abroad from the cheapest seller and during 
crisis years protected by quota regulations which restrict imports 
from foreign countries, is a powerful competitor. The Hollander, 
by nature and custom a bom trader, will generally purchase only 

from the supplier, native or foreign, who can submit the lowest 
1 

offer, / 

Imports into Canada, ostensibly from The Netherlands, will 
be studied on a commodity basis as were the exports credited to 
that country. The importance of the different Groups is more 
evenly divided than was the case for exports. It must be remem¬ 
bered that the statistics for imports are a more accurate por¬ 
trayal of the actual conditions prevailing between the two nations 
since the route taken by commodities from Hplland to Canada was 
normally more direct than that taken by products flowing the other

way. Then too, the Dominion did not carry on such an extensive 
transit and entrepot trade as did The Netherlands. Lastly, reference 
back to Chart 1 serves as a reminder that the imports from Holland 
were as a rule much smaller than the exports credited to her. 

Groups I, dealing with Agricultural and Vegetable Products, 
contains the items normally associated with Holland and her trade. 

The first to come to mind, because of our association of The 
Netherlands with fields of tulips, is naturally the quantities of 
horticultural products. The change-over of Dutch agriculture, from 
grain production to horticulture, at least partly as a result of 
the cheap extensively-grown grain from the New World entering the 
Continental markets, is itself an interesting study but one which 
cannot be pursued here. The chief horticultural exports of Holland 
to Canada are in the field of trees, shrubs, florist stock, pre¬ 
dominantly bulbs. From 1925”1939 this item stood either first or 
second in rank with the exception of one year. Over 50^ of Canada’s 
imports in horticulture came consistently from Holland, and it is 
easily seen how important The Netherlands was to Canada in this 
field. These products represented fully 10^ of all the Canaidian 
imports from Holland in most years. Just what part of the total 
Dutch exports went to the Dominion it is not possible to say. 

Other agricultural products fluctuated in actual value and 
in relative position to a much greater degree than did the items 
just discussed. Alcoholic beverages, principally gin, were a

significant part of the trade until 1934, when Canadian purchases 
declined greatly, not to be revived. Following the same general 
trend as alcohol was cocoa and chocolate, although it was an even 
greater article of trade than the gin. After the instituting of 
the Imperial Preferences in 1932, Holland no longer supplied from 
25% to 35% of the Dominion's cocoa requirements but merely 3-=4% or 
less. 

Tobacco from Holland, mostly unmanufactured cigar leaf, 
was an item of some consequence but tended to fluctuate rather 
widely both in actual value and in the proportion of Canadian im¬ 
ports supplied. The only other vegetable product worthy of note 
was Vegetable Oils, Not for Food which first assumed prominence 
during the fiscal year 1934* In some years a large part of the 
Canadian demand was filled by the Dutch, but this condition varied 
from year to year. 

The Netherlands was never important to Canada as a source 
of Animal Products, Group II, only once reaching 1% of the total 
imports into the Dominion; in Group I, the level ran over 1^% on 
the average, with some of the individual items being supplied by 
the Dutch to a very great extent. The item of most constant im¬ 
portance was cured fish of various sorts. Milk products, mainly 
cheese,also entered in fair quantity from time to tMe, but the 
proportion of total Canadian imports was not large. 

Group III, Fibres, Textiles and Textile Products, represen¬ 
ted about 30% of the total imports into Canada which were credited

to The Netherlands, Only on two occasions did the figure drop 
to 15 % or lower. In sustaining such a high level for the Group, 
tiAD Sub-Groups were notable. Vegetable Fibres and Artificial Silk, 
In most years over half of the Fibres and Textiles imported from 
Holland came from the vegetable class, and in the class itself, 
practically all the movements were in binder twine, Nomally 
from a third to over a half of the-Dominion* s imports of blinder 
tvdne came from Holland, and in 1932 the proportion was four- 
fifths, During the early years being examined, the United States 
sent a good deal of twine to Canada but this trade declined and the 
United Kingdom became the supplier of second rank, nosing the 
Dutch out of first place from the fiscal year 1937 onwards. 

Artificial Silk, mostly yams and threads, shared top 
ranl^ing with Vegetable Fibres as one of the most valuable textile 
imports from The Netherlands. The Dutch supplies of artificial 
silk, hov/ever, did not play such a heavy role in the total im¬ 
ports of the commodity as did their binder twine. As a rule 
rather less than 12 % was imported from Holland, and in the fiscal 
years 1937 and 193^ under 2^. 

The only item of any enduring cons-equence to be found in 
Group IV, Wood, Wood Products and Paper, for the time 1925-1939 
was paper in its various forms. Although no large proportion of 
the total imports from Holland was involved, certain quantities 
of wrapping papers and pulp- or fibreboard, moved quite consis¬ 


tently, 




c. 


j

-Gk- 


No consistency is to be found in the items which moved 
under Group V, Iron and Its Products, If any particular product 
may be said to have had any general importance, that one was wire, 
although there were years in vhich no trade whatsoever was carried 
on in that line; nor may The Netherlands be said to have been a 
supplier of any consequence. 

Group VI which contains those commodities which are classed 
as being Non-Ferrous was somewhat akin to the two previous Groups 
in its relative position. Up until the middle 1920’s, electrical 
apparatus was an item of note but its importance diminished. From 
that time on, different metals and their products took the lead 
from year to year, none ever attaining any prominence in Canada’s 
total imports. 

Of all the Groups, VII is the one which had probably the 
greatest fluctuations. During the depths of the Depression, tliis 
Group made up a very much smaller part of the whole imports from 
Holland than before or after. The principal commodity in this 
Group which comprises the Non-Metallic Minerals and Their Products 
was unset diamonds. Customs statistics do not differentiate between 
stones of industrial quality and those destined, for the jewellery 
trade so that no estimate can be given of the types imported from 
The Netherlands. In most years, both Antwerp and London provided a 
larger share of the Canadian requirements than did Amsterdam, 

Antwerp being well ahead of the others. In spite of this, the 
Dutch generally supplied about a quarter of the total, although at 





- 65 - 


times the proportion went down as low as a tenth. 

Group VIII, Chemicals and Allied Products, was one the total 
actual values for which changed very little throughout the whole 
period when compared to some of the other Groups, A Sub-Group of 
note is that for Paints and Pigments, About 6^ of the Dominion's 
imports of them came from Holland but there was a considerable 
variation both ways from that figure from year to year and the trend 
for the few years before the War was downward. Another set of 
comraodities in vhich theDutch were of influence in theCanadian 
market is that dealing with Fertilizers, about 125^ - 15^ of which 
they supplied. This trade was built up from very small proportions 
before the Depression and following the recovery Holland’s share 
in the business declined. Only one other product is worth men¬ 
tioning separately and that is glycerine, the value of which changed 
in large measure from year to year. The changes in amounts from 
Holland and Germany varied inversely to some extent and conjectures 
can bema.de as to whether or not some of the movements were really 
Dutch transit trade in the German product. 

In the Miscellaneous Commodities, Group IX, the variatiohs 
in the relative importance of the different Sub-Groups v/ere great, 
and no attempt will be made to explain them. The only consistent 
item was that under the term ’Containers’| it referred to the value 
of the coverings protecting the goods imported into Canada from The 
Netherlands.

In summary it should be pointed out that the only items of 
lasting stability in Holland’s exports to the Dominion were her 
native horticultural products, her binder twine, artificial silk 
to some degree and the products of her diamond-cutting and polishing 
industry. 


6 . Probable Trends 

To give any estimate of the vfay in which trade would have 
developed had the Second World War not intervened is most diffi¬ 
cult, The picture was distorted by the actions of Germany in her 
preparations for war and by the restrictions place4on multilateral 
trading during the 1930’s. Neglecting the first of these factors, 
it is still a question as to how long a time would have elapsed 
before bilateral agreements ¥/ere discarded as being wasteful from 
the broader viewpoint in international trade. One of the under¬ 
lying causes of those very agreements was the fact that from 1931 
on there was no stable world money market through vdiich the finan¬ 
cing of foreign trade could be effected on a multilateral basis, 
and until confidence was restored in the monetary soundness of such 
countries as Great Britain and the United States, no such stability 
could exist. 

However, some predictions can bemade. Agricultural products, 
mostly in the form of wheat and feeding grains, would have continued 
to be the chief export of Canada to The Netherlands, wj.th a fairly

large proportion of the whole amount being transhipped from there 
to Germany and Switzerland, With the relaxation of laws in most 
European countries decreeing that home-grown grain must be mixed 
with foreign in the production of bread, Canada could have expected 
an increase in the amount that she could sell, bearing in mind the 
fact that severe competition would have had to be met from other 
grain-exporting nations. The flour trade, too, might have been 
stimulated. The extent to which Canada might have been willing to 
meet Scandinavian competition in ■wood pulp and so increase her ex¬ 
ports of that commodity to Holland would have depended more upon 
the American demand for pulp than upon the rivalry to temet. 

An increase in the Non-Ferrous Metals destined for uses other than 
armaments could have been expected but the volume would have been 
somewhat reduced if the military requirements were no longer exer¬ 
ting their influence on the total demand. 

Insofar as the imports are concerned, it is probable that 
the chief ones would have continued to lie in the field of horti¬ 
culture, Binder twine might have declined still more in importance 
and the gro'wth of the Canadian rayon industry would probably have 
reduced the imports of artificial silk from The Netherlands, The 
value of diamonds from Holland would have depended upon the 
ability to meet Belgian and British prices. The whole trend in 
Canada’s imports from the Dutch had been downward and there is no 
obvious f^^ason to suppose that an increase might have been expected

With regard to the position that the two nations held in 
world trade during the 1930’s, it is of interest to see the posi¬

It is readily observed that Canada was the more important 
of the two i-n total trade, due for the most part to her prepon¬ 
derance in the export trade. The very figures tell the story of the 
condition of the countries; Canada a young nation, expanding the 
use of its natural resources. The Netherlands an older nation, able 
to continue its disproportionate balance of imports because of its 
capital exports. Both were important in the foreign commerce of the 
world, each in its special capacity. It remains for the succeeding 
sections of the study to unfold the changes which occurred in their 
positions as a result of the Second World War.

Section II 

The War Period 
September 1939-Mav I945 

When the German Army invaded Poland on September 1, 1939» 
and a state of war once more existed between England and Germany, 
the Dutch who had been neutral throughout the First World War 
found themselves again in that difficult position with the effects 
upon the national economy that might be expected when nations were 
looking more seriously than before at the possibilities of economic 
warfare* The event of more immediate importance so far as this 
study is concerned, was the declaration of war against Germany by 
Canada on September 10, 1939. 

Exports from The Netherlands both to Great Britain and 
Germany dropped after the war beganj due to the desire to lay in 
stocks of essential materials and the consequent relaxing of many 
of the quantity controls, imports increased. But Dutch shipping 
circles felt great apprehension over the decision of the allied 
governments to seize German exports, whether carried in enen^ or 
neutral ships. It should be remembered in this connection that 
about one-third of the activity of the port of Rotterdam centered 
around the transit trade in goods going to and from Germany* In 
view of this and the lowering of the clearings balance due 
Holland from Germany, trade between the two was somewhat stimu- 

lated the end of 1939.

On March 31> 1940 a decree came into effect whereby the 
gold stocks of the Netherlands Bank were revalued* Since no 
stabilization operations were attempted^ the guilder declined 
about 18^, with the New York rate at about $0.53 American. The 
new rate set by the Dutch authorities had been just over $0.ft6 
American, so that some of the reaction to the war conditions can 
be seen in this difference. 

Early on May 10, 1940 the German attack on The Netherlands 
began and within five days the Dutch were forced to capitulate. 

The material damage done at the time was relatively small; some 
sections of the country were inundated according to the plan for 
the consolidation of the forces in 'Fortress Holland* and some 
fighting took place in cities and their outskirts with the result 
that bombing was resorted to hy the attackers. As a last warning 
to the people of Holland the Luftwaffe gutted the business dis¬ 
trict of Rotterdam. The Immediate effect of these overwhelming 
blows upon the nation's population was to stun them utterly. 

The occupation had begun. 

Busy as she was with the war in France, Germany had little 
time in the first few months of the Dutch occupation to interfere 
in the ordinary routine of the country. This lack of interference, 
coupled with the correctness of the German troops led the people 
to accept the situation quietly. However, the civil administration 
appointed by the Reich soon took steps to subjugate the nation and

to Integrate its production into the German War requirements, 

Dutch agriculture was an industry with a complete set-up 
for state control (the result of policies developed during the 
1930 *s) \dien war broke out. This was exploited by the Germans 
to increase the exports of butter, bacon, eggs and so on to Ger¬ 
many or to supply their armed forces. The reliance of Holland on 
imported feedstuffs necessitated a reduction in the numbers of 
cattle and pigs as time went on and these supplies were no longer 
available. The imports of fertilizers which were also of great 
importance to the industry were cut off so that even the root crop 
harvests declined. Farm labour was exempted from the drafts 
which were sent off to augment the needs of Germany’s war indus¬ 
tries, but still the output diminished. The surplus left over for 
the use of the civilian populatim decreased but did not reach a 
dangerously low level until the war was carried onto Dutch soil. 
The areas cultivated were reduced throu^ the construction of air¬ 
ports, fortresses, minefields, etc, by the Germansj this situation 
first became serious with the start of the Allied offensive in 
Jtme of 1944f at which time even larger areas were sown to mine¬ 
fields and great tracts inundated to prevent invasion. Before 
the enen^ was forced to evacuate the country, about 200,000 acres 
had been flooded with salt water and 300,000 with fresh. These 
actions, together with the space taken by the airports and so on 
mentioned above, took from production about 25^ of all the farm 
land available in Holland, In addition, many of the horses used

had been appropriated for military work, cutting down production 
still more. 

The foreign trade of The Netherlands was also changed to suit 
the purposes of the Germans, In pre-war days Holland had exported 
to Germany mainly foodstuffs, taking manufactures and coal in re¬ 
turn, This was continued but gradually the balance swung over to 
an export of more finished goods, with the production guided by 
the occupying forces. As a rule, the exports equalled some three- 
quarters of the imports before the War. After a year-and-a-half 

of German rule the percentage rose to 95%, by 1943 was 170% and 

1 

before the fighting started in Holland was 200%,/ In that most of 
the payment was made in new issues of the Netherlands Bank, issues 
representing loans t© Germary, the standard of living of the people 
suffered. Trade with countries other than Germany declined badly, 
Industiy, closely linked to the German needs for warfare, slowed 
down as raw materials for most other purposes were cut. The resul¬ 
tant unemployment was hidden from view through the use of Dutch 
labour for military construction in all parts of occupied Europe 
and by the transfer of skilled workers from plants in The Nether¬ 
lands to Germany itself. But a paralysis spread over the factories 
of the nation,

Before the war, Holland had had one of the most efficient 
transportation systems in Europe* In addition to passenger facili 
ties, freight was handled quickly and competitively by rail, 
inland navigation on the canals and rivers and by road* The ports 
were noted for the volume of traffic handled. Following the capi¬ 
tulation, all transportation came under German control j the uses 
to which it was put were geared to German plans rather than the 
normal exchange of goods from one part of the country to another. 
Hundreds of the vessels formerly used on the canals were confis¬ 
cated for the ultimate invasion of England, fuel for the remainder 
was drastically reduced! motor trucks were e^ropriated by the 
occupier, and fuel for the others cut down. The Allied offensive 
from the air in 1943 did profound damage to the railways of the 
nation, in addition to the track broken up by Geman order and the 
locomotives €md freight cars taken away for the enei^y*s own roads* 
Such then was the state of The Netherlands in September, 
1944 vdien the Allies made their desperate bid to end the War 
quickly with a lightning stab northwards across the Dutch frontier 
a drive intended to link up with airborne forces dropped in the 
Arnhem area* It was about this period that the 50,000 acres of 
Walcheren Island were inundated through allied actioni the Ger¬ 
mans, believing an evacuation of the country near at hand, des« 
troyed many of the port facilities of Amsterdam and Rotterdam, 
flooded some of the polders* The attempted liberation failed*

The winter of 1944-45 was tragic to The Netherlands* 

The areas still occupied by the enemy were systematically stripped 
of all stores, machines and materials of use to them in the con¬ 
tinuance of the struggle* The very cables of Holland*s network of 
electrified railroads were removed to provide the Germans with 
copper* As for the Dutch people, the death-rate due to malnutri¬ 
tion and plain starvation increased greatly. The rations were of 
the most meagre and even the tulip bulbs which might have served 
as the immediate basis of renewed trade with the United States and 
Canada sold for high prices as food* The hunt for manpower to send 
into Germany increased in tempo and with this increase came a still 
harsher treatment of offenders who tried to evade the orders* 

The real liberation of The Netherlands began in February, 
1945 and was completed only with the downfall of the German armed 
might in May of that year. In the last three months of war, still 
more damage was inflicted upon the country. As the Germans fled 
they took with them large quantities of looted consiamers goods and 
the means of transporting them, whether car, truck, horse and cart 
or bicycle* As a last gesture they blew a long gap in the dyke 
protecting the Wiermingermeer polder and once more it was claimed 
by the waters from which it had been wrested ten years previously. 
But Holland was now free. 

It is necessary to consider the conditions prevailing in 
the various sections of the Netherlands econoiEy at the time of the

liberation in order to estimate the goods requisite to a re¬ 
newing of industrial and commercial activity* 

Agriculture, the industry which was the most important in 
pre-war Holland, should receive first notice* The extent to which 
the farm and meadow lands were put out of production because of 

flooding and other military use has already been indicated. The 

1 

number of Dutch farms destroyed has been estimated at 8,000 /, 

2 

while milk cows had decreased by 28^, pigs by 67% and poiiltry 87%/ 
Many farms could not be operated in 1945 because of the minefields 
and the lack of equipment of various sorts, though some of the 
horses were returned from Germany and this eased the situation to 
a slight degree. However, production in that year amounted only to 
about 50% of the pre-war figure. First priority had t© be given 
to the draining of flooded lands and within a year of the libera¬ 
tion all those areas were free of water. But that having been 
accomplished there remained the problem of equipment for soil 
cultivation, harvesting and horticultural productioni fertilisers 
for the depleted and the water-logged lends| livestock such as 
cattle and horses. Actually the increase in pigs and poultry was 
so greAt that the numbers had to be curtailed again because of the 
lack of imported fodder.

Next to the farms, the transportation facilities presented 
the worst picture in freed Holland* Only a third of the steam 
locomotives were left and most of them were in bad condition 5 
a fifth of the electric and Diesel^electric \anits were to be found 
and agadnthe majority were not fit for use. Some 300 passenger 
coaches out of a pre*n^ar 1800 were left in Holland; only 1,000 
goods wagons of an original 30,000. Of the road transport some 
40 ^, generally of the older types, appeared for service. Although 
no accurate check was possible on the state of the inland navi¬ 
gation, it was estimated that only about one-half of the peacetime 
tonnage of 4,000,000 would be recovered. Nor is the actual number 
of pieces of equipment the only criterion by which to judge the 
condition of transportation* In the railways, bombing had des¬ 
troyed sections of the right-of-way; electric cable was not to be 
had for those parts of the system s© served; the lack of coal would 
have been a severe limiting factor in the use of more trains; the 
Germans in retreating had blown up all the main bridges over the 
canals and rivers, as well as many smaller ones. The consequence 
of the last action mentioned was that the countly was cut up into 
•separate sections which had only the military bridges of the Allies 
to link them; railroads could not run and the destroyed bridges 
blocked the waterways as effectively as they ruined the rail lines. 
Work on reconstruction began Immediately, with Canadian Army 
Engineers as well as the British bridging the rivers and canals

so that the distribution of essential supplies could be carried 
out by road* Vehicles were provided also* Following this the 
routes for inland navigation were cleared* Within four months some 
of the main rail services had been restored, although the north 
and the south of the country had not yet been Joined* The har¬ 
bours had been cleared sufficiently to handle necessary cargo* 

Trade and industry were both in a bad way by the War*s end. 
It is estimated that at that time the direct material loss due 
to the war was over 10 billion guilders, or nearly one-third of 
the national wealth in 1939* This loss was caused by direct war 
activities, the actual fighting and bombing, requisitions by the 
Germans, lack of repairs and so on* Trade was computed to have 
lost about 60^ of the pre-war value, partly due to depreciation of 
stocks on handI industrial plant saw a decline of 1^$* The ad¬ 
verse effects upon the soil and the damage to domestic establish¬ 
ments were included in the 10 billion guilders* The Dutch whose 
foreign investments had been very great lost much through the 
struggle* From 1933 onwards growing amounts had been put into 
branch plants in Germany to overcome the tariff barriers so that 
ultimately there were l^- billion guilders tied up in that statej 
the dividends from this investment for 1938 were 21 million guil¬ 
ders, in comparison investments in the U.S.A. yielded 46 million 
and those in the Netherlands East Indies 33 million* Much of the 
German investment must have been lost through the air offensive

and later ground attacks* Of the others^ much must have been 
dissipated in the Japanese phases of the conflict, and much in 
the obtaining of supplies and money to carry on the Free Netherlands 
Government war effort. These losses, together with the amounts of 
monetary gold which had been lost totalled 2.8 million guilders. 
Trade and industry had indeed been hard hit by the War. 

Bold action was demanded in the financial field. During 
the period of the conflict the bank notes in circxilation had i»- 
creased over five«»fold from 1 billion guilders to billioni 
prices in that time had, through quite rigid control, advanced not 
more than 75^ for the rationed goods. With the decrease in pro“ 
duction and supplies, liberation offered the greatest danger of an 
inflationary upsurge in prices, the benefit if any, accruing to 
those who were most deeply implicated in the black market. The 
first action took place in July of 1945 when all notes of 100 
guilders had to be turned into blocked accounts within a five day 
period, the bills becoming inv^id after that* In two months 
note circulation had declined to under 2 billion guilders. In 
late September the next step was ready. At that time all notes down 
to 1 guilder were called in and placed in blocked accounts. Each 
person was allowed 10 guilders of the new currency to tide them 
over the week| at the and of that period, employers paid wages in 
the new bills and 25% of the blocked accounts were freed under 
special conditions. Within the week some 600 million guilders had

been released and by the end of the year about 1*1 billiono The 
purposes in these operations were three:- First, to deprive 
black-market operators and collaborators of their war gains; 

Second, to form the basis of heavy capital and capital-gains 
taxes in order to try to effect a balance of the deficit budgets 
of the occupation period; Third, the monetary reason, to try to 
establish a balance between the amounts of money and of goods 
available. 

So much then for the conditions prevailing in The Netherlands 
at the time of the liberation and shortly afterwards# As nearly 
as possible, the needs of the nation must be determined. These 
needs appear to be soJhter-dependent that they form a circle, a 
vicious circle such that in order to produce one good in suffi¬ 
cient quantities, another is needed which can be obtained only 
through the use of the first coMnodityo The importing of the 
requisite materials, of necessity on credit, is the action which 
cam break the wheel. 

In agriculture the main requirements a year after the end of 
the war appeared to be first of all the equipment for restoring 
the farms to their former levels of productivity and then feed- 
stuffs for getting the dairy industry re-established. Food for daily 
consumption was also needed* Steel for railways, for bridge con¬ 
struction, was imperative in the transportation field, as were 

rolling stock and motor vehicles* Harbours had need of steel for

new installations. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry had 

estimated as the most urgent needs at the time, needs which should 

have been filled before the Spring of 1946, the following:- 

231 f800 tons of chemical products (probably including fertilizers), 

160,000 tons of paper and raw materials for the making of paper, 

500,000 tons of iron and steel, and over 2,000,000 tons of build- 
1 

ing materials* / In finance the requirements were loans, loans 
with which to procure the materials necessary to building up the 
national productivity, so that the monetary reforms instituted to 
control inflation would not come to nought, loans to help Holland 
regain her position as an important world trader* 

Such is the recent history of Holland, the country which 
fought the Germans for five days then endured the occupation for 
five yearsI such is the damage inflicted upon the people and the 
national wealth; such is the need for things to restore the Dutch 
economy* A survey must now be made of the aid extended to the 
nation*

SECTION III 

Post"War Aid to The Netherlands 

The aid given by the Allied armies in the period following 
the collapse of the German army has been mentioned already and 
little need be added* Besides construction work, soldiers helped 
in the harvesting of the 1945 crop since the Dutch man^power situ¬ 
ation was still rather confused at that date. As pointed out above, 
vehicles had also been provided so that the nation could re-establish 
its communications. In addition, military stores were sold to the 
Netherlands government* By the end of June, 1946, negotiations 
were almost completed for this transaction* The Netherlands had 
claims in the amount of $33,700,000 against the Canadians for 
goods and services, including billetting of soldiers, provided. 

These claims were settled by contra accounts in the amount of 
$37,700,000, so that there was a net balance owing by the Dutch 

to Canada of $4>000,000* The Claims of the Dominion were made up 

as follows: $8,400,000 was for military stores purchased in 

Canada, mostly personnel equipment for the Dutch forces| $4,000,000 

for Canadian stores held in England and parts of Europe other than 

Holland; $25,300,000 for stores and equipment of the disbanding 

1 

Canadian Army, stores still held in depots in The Netherlands*/ 

The bulk of this last item was made up of vehicles which could be 

used to ^eikt advantage in restoring the transportation system 

of Holland. Thus it is seen that for only $4 million in Canadian

exchange the Outch were able to finance the purchase of over $30 
million worth of foreign supplies* 

Whether or not this sum was considered as being advanced under 
the terms of the Canadian Loan to The Netherlands is not deter¬ 
minable* 

Loans to the total of $125»000,000 have been granted to 
Holland* The first, for $25,000,000, was effected on May 1, 1945, 
i.e. before the conclusion of hostilities* The second agreement 
was entered into on February 5, 1946 and superseded the first, pro¬ 
viding for the incorporation of the $25 million into a loan not t© 
exceed $125 milliimo The procedure outlined was as follows; 

Amounts desired are to be requisitioned by the Netherlands govern¬ 
ment and at such time are to be paid into a special account at the 
Bank of Canadaj interest at the rate of three percent is to be 
paid on these amounts until the date of consolidation of the loanj 
the consolidation date is to be April 30, 194^^, at which time the 
principal and interest to that time are to be considered as the 
total amoimt of the loan| Government of The Netherlands bonds to 
the face value of the debt are to be delivered to the Minister of 
Finance for Canada at that date| the bonds are to mature serially 
in twenty-seven eqiaal annual amounts of principal commencing on 
April 30, 1950 and ending on April 30, 1976; interest is to be paid 
annually on the bonds, the first nine serials at the rate of two 
and three-quarters percent, the next twelve at three percent €Uid

the remaining six at three and one-quarter percent; payment is to 
be made in Canadian dollars or fine gold at the option of the 
Government of The Netherlands; any portion of the loan not re¬ 
quisitioned by April 30, 1947 shall be considered to have lapsed 
and to be no longer payable unless further agreement shall have 
been reached* Full texts of the Agreements of May 1, 1945 and 
February 3, 1946 are given in Appendix £« A perusal of the terms 
of the two compacts will indicate that the final conditions are 
not nearly as favourable as those under which tie first loan was 
grantedo 

Both agreements were made under the terms of The Export Credits 
Insurance Act, Chapter 39 of the Statutes of Canada, 1944* The 
loans were provided for the purchase of Canadian-produced goods and 
at least to begin with all transactions were carried out on 
Netherlands Goverranent account* The two agencies for Holland 
throughout the war period and afterwards were * Netherlands Pur¬ 
chasing Commission* at New York and ‘Economic, Financial and Ship¬ 
ping Mission* at Washington. To the end of j|5ril, 1946, Dutch 
purchases in Canada for the war and post-war period had totalled 
slightly over $50,000,000. How much of this was chargeable against 
the loans and how much had been paid for with free foreign exchange 
or disinvestment cannot be ascertained* The Netherlands govern¬ 
ment, in accordance with Dutch traditions of enterprise, wished to 
resume trading on the normal private basis as soon as possible* This

did not prove entirely feasible under conditions in Holland* 

However, in April, 1946 steps were taken to allow *token* trading 

to commence* This gave Dutch importers permission to obtain 

quotations directly from Canadian exporters, quotations containing 

present price, 1939 price and available date* If the Netherlands 

Import Permit Department approved the request to import on the 

basis of the commodity being essential as well as upon the price 

policy, the order was to be placed through the official Purchasing 

1 

Mission in New York* / This was certainly a very small step to-* 
wards the resumption of private trading* 

In addition to the loan from Canada, The Netherlands 
received aid from other countries* A loan of |200nmillion was 
obtained from the United States, the terms of which are not 
available although it may be supposed that they correspond fairly 
closely to the Canadian* Perhaps the change in Canadian terms 
may be linked to the American loan in a way similar to the effect 
of the policy in the United States with regard to the loans to 
Great Britain by both nations* 

No loan was forth-coming from the United Kingdom but a 
monetary agreement was signed in September of 1945 between the 
British and the Dutch whereby the sum of £5 million was made 
mutually available during the period of three years in order to 
control capital transfers between the two* A rate of exchange 

mid-way between the 1939 rate and the old mint par was agreed upon*

The treaty was to cover transactions with the Netherlands East 
Indies and the Netherlands West Indies as well* An important pro¬ 
vision was the third party availability which covered only current 
requirements* 

The short-run course of the commerce between Canada and 
Holland will be influenced by the loan, by the immediate require¬ 
ments of the Dutch nation, by the condition of the pre-war suppliers 
of Netherlands needs and by official policies in Holland. It was 
seen at the end of Section II that besides food, the main require¬ 
ments were in semi- and fully-manufactured goods. Ordinarily, 

Canada would not supply a great deal of the last-mentioned, but 
with the export facilities of the Dutch much impaired by the War 
and the position in the Netherlands East Indies precluding any volume 
of Foreign exchange becoming available to the Mother country from 
that source, some reliance has to be put in obtaining materials 
from someone willing to grant credit, Canada has already extended 
that credit and as a consequence the quantities of all goods taken 
from her will increase considerably above the pre-war levels. 

Evidence of that is seen in the preliminary figures released by 
the Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics for trade in 1945• 

Values are not given but only quantity (in Metric tons); a measure, 
however, of some accuracy in the aggregate. Canada stands in third 
place as a source of imports with 11*7% of the Netherlands total* 

The United States had supplied just over 30%; Germany 15%, most of

which was coal for Dutch domestic and industrial use* The 
Canadian figure may be contrasted with the average value supplied 
by the Dominion during the 1930 *s of just under of the total 
Dutch imports^ For the 1945 period the exports from The Nether¬ 
lands to the Dominion represented 1*2^ of the total exports, a 

1 

slight increase over the pre-war percentages* / It is probable 
that the loan was responsible for at least a portion of the gain 
in Canada’s position as a supplier* 

The United States had not previously been so important in 
the trade of Holland and this would indicate, partly that the 
American loan might have had some effect on the results, and in 
view of the predominant position assumed by the U«S* as a source 
of industrial goods and materials, and partly the condition of the 
pre-war suppliers of the bulk ©f those commodities to The Nether¬ 
lands* Canady,becoming more prominent during the War as an 
industrial nation,can expect that at least in the short-rim she 
will increase both the amoimt and the proportion of her finished 
goods and partly-msoaufactured materials in exports to Holland* 

Of the nations which prior to the Second World War had stood at 
the head of the Dutch list, Germany and Great Britain are the two 
most affected by the conflict* Germany was the chief country from 
which Netherlands iaqjorts were drawn, imports of finished metal 
goods being the most notable, along with coal from the Ruhr*

Britain, an even better market for Dutch products than was Germany, 
supplied in return great quantities of coal and manufactures of 
iron, steel, etc., including tinplate# With the industrial 
capacity of the German state reduced to a very small fraction of 
its former size, and with its production of steel goods under 
careful scrutiny from the political point of view, it would seem 
unlikely that Germany oan become important in the supplying of 
Dutch needs in those lines for some years. Britain, too, has 
had her factories bombed, has had machinery used so intensively 
that depreciation has ti©n place at a rapid rate. The replacement 
of these means will require some time and not until then can she 
become as great an exporter as before, even though the bulk of the 
manufactures be sent out of the country. With these two nations 
out of the running Canada should be able to enter the Dutch market 
for goods other than the raw materials %diich so dominated her 
trade before the War. 

With the requirements of The Netherlands such as they are 
an expansion can be looked for in the field of metal wares, in 
building materials (particularly luuiber), wood pulpp grains and 
at least for a short period other foodstuffs. A limiting factor 
in the amount of expansion is the post-war Canadian demand for 
these same products, especially building materialsi the great 
demand for them in the United States with the high prices thltt

prevail and Canada*s need for American exchange, which last item 
can have some effect on the official policy pursued by the Cana¬ 
dian authorities responsible for trade and finance. However, the 
policies followed by the Netherlands government will also have 
some effect on the trade between Canada and that coiintry both 
immediately and in the long-run. Of such policies two can be 
mentioned, the programme of industrialization for the nation and 
the customs union with Belgium and Luxembourg* 

No details of the industrialization programme are yet 
available but it is indicated that Holland wishes to build up 
those industries in which she was dependent upon Germany before 
the War, particularly those industries in which such a programme 
would not call for an excessive amount of continuous subsidization 
and protection* 

The long-run trend of Canadian exports to The Netherlands 
before the War was towards a some^iat greater proportion of semi- 
and fully-manufactured goods* The net effect of the operations 
of all the factors mentioned in the discussion of the short 
course of the commerce between Canada and The Netherlands would 
seem to be a speeding-up of that process*' The extent to which 
those gains in diversification can be retained will depend in 
good measure upon the efficiency of Canadian production so that 
prices of the former suppliers can be met once they are ready to 
enter the trade again* Much of this ’efficiency*, of course.

SECTION IV 

Long-Run Effects 
of 

Post-War Aid to The Netherlands 

In the consideration of this topic, two main themes must be 

dealt with. One is the mechanism of transfer with regard to the 

loan to Holland; the other is the Dominion’s relationship to 

other countries such as Great Britain and the United States, In 

discussing the transference of funds, account will be taken of 

the effects on Canada at the time of making the loan and the later 

ones when the loan is repaid; the situation in The Netherlands 

T.¥ill be dealt with similarly. The comparison, in brief, of 

these effects with the ones occasioned by Canada’s relations with 

other countries will then be undertaken. 

The terms under which the advance was made to Holland have 

been discussed in detail in Section III of this study, but at this 

point it is necessary to look at the manner in vsiiich the necessary 

funds may be raised. The loan was made under the provisions of 

’’The Export Credits Insurance Act", Chapter 39 of the Statutes of 

Canada for 19i44“45, assented to August 15, 1944^ and it is the 

Act itself, rather than the terms of the particular agreement, 

that states that the full amount of the loan must be spent on 

1 

Canadian-produced goods, / The sum made available to The 

1, Statutes of Canada, 1944-45; Chapter 39. Preamble and Section 
22 (1) (b).

Netherlands was $125 million. The monies necessary could be 

obtained by the Minister in two ways* The Act allowed bonds 

and debentures backed by the Canadian Government to be sold to 

the public in order to raise funds* The other method was to take 

them from the unappropriated monies in the Consolidated Revenue 
1 

Fund. / Although the two methods were given, the terms of the 
Act would indicate that insofar as loans to foreign countries for 
the purposes of reconstruction and the stimulation of Canadian 
trade might be concerned, it would be preferable to appropriate 
them from theConsolidated Revenue Fund, The selling of bonds and 
debentures v/ould seem to be more applicable to the other phase of 
the business allowed under the Act, that of insuring Canadian ex¬ 
porters against loss due particularly to non-payment for exports 
on the part of foreign importers. No data are, however, available 
as to the method actually used for the raising of the funds* 

Certain results are to be expected from the transfer of 
purchasing power from Canadians to the Dutch. Since the loan 
must all be spent on Canadian-produced goods, no difficulty arises 
through the variations in exchange rates which woilLd most pro¬ 
bably occur if the loan had to bemade available in currencies 
other than Canadian, although such changes would in any case be 
minimized because of the careful exchange control still exercised

by the two nations. The problem of price control must also be 
considered, with the effect it might have upon the results nor¬ 
mally expected from such a transfer of funds. This will be done 
following the discussion of what would ordinarily take place. 

Since the monies for the loan are to be raised for the most part 
through taxation, there should be a corresponding decrease in the 

demand for Canadian goods by Canadians, such a decline to be offset 

1 

by the increased demand by Hollanders, / Nevertheless it should 
be realized that there would be price changes brought about in cer¬ 
tain sections of the commodity markets. It would be supposed that 
the downward forces would appear most sharply in consumers* goods 
and the upward ones in the machinery and raw materials lines, al¬ 
though a portion of the loan would probably be spent on foodstuffs, 
thus offsetting consumer goods price declines. But one of the main 
influences at work throughout the period over which the loan must 
be taken is the reconversion of Canadian life and industry from 
war-time to peace-time conditions. There is thus a latent demand 
becoming effective in Canada, a demand for much the same things 
which are wanted by the Dutch, The demand is for consumers’ goods 
to a great extent, and consequently there would be a derived de¬ 
mand for producers* goods. The possibility of an independent 

1, This is based upon the assunption that the burden of taxation 
falls to a great extent upon the ultimate consumers of finished 
goods rather than upon production organizations.

demand for the latter type, through a desire to re-equip war¬ 
worn factories, also exists. The tendency would be to force up 
the price of those commodities which Canada exports. The rise in 
the price of producers’ goods brought about by increased Canadian 
demand for them would be reinforced by the added Dutch demand. 

The drop in price of consumers’ commodities which might be ex¬ 
pected as the result of a loan provided through taxation would be 
overcome to a considerable degree by the latent war-time demand 
making itself felt and by the portion of the total Netherlands 
purchases devoted to that type of good. No information has been 
released which would indicate the proportions of the aid spent on 
different types of goods and so the sectional distribution of the 
effects cannot be determined. However, the net effect of the Dutch 

loan on sectional price levels in Canada would seem to be almost in¬ 

significant in view of the special conditions found in the immediate 
post-war period, especially so when it is realized what a small 
part of the national income is involved, and even more so when the 

loan to The Netherlands is seen to be but a small part of the total 

loans made by Canada to other countries such as France, Belgium 
and China, as well as the separate one to theUnited Kingdom for the 
sum of in billion. Nevertheless, there would be some pressure 
exerted on the prices of producers’ goods by the loan to Holland 
and this pressure would merely be emphasized by those loans to 
other countries. ^The extent to which the price controls mentioned 
above are maintained, until the expiry date for obtaining funds, 
will affect the results of such pressure.

Most of the price controls in Canada vwere off by April 2, 
1947, the expiry date for the extension of aid being the 30th of 
the same month. However, the controls which are probably of the 
greatest importance in this study were kept in force. They per¬ 
tained to grains, basic iron and steel goods, wood-pulp, construc¬ 
tional wood products, and oils and fats. The effect of the price 
control was to stabilize prices, but at the same time shortages 
were felt at those prevailing levels. This shortage was made still 
more acute by the export of goods wanted in Canada, Therefore the 
period of readjustment would be lengthened. This, with any rami¬ 
fications which it might have on the Canadian economy, would repre¬ 
sent the main sacrifice of Canadians in granting loans. 

As to the effects of the loan on the Dutch economy, cog¬ 
nizance must be taken of the special circumstances surrounding 
the granting of it. The fact that the whole economy is to be re¬ 
built, and production which was brought almost to a standstill by 
the War recommenced through the agency of the loan (and loans by 
countries other than Canada as well) would have some bearing on 
the actual changes found in the price structure of the country. 

As has been pointed out already in the earlier sections, Holland 
started to reconstruct herindustries under conditions of a severe 
shortage of capital as compared with her position prior to the War, 
Consequently, it would not be possible to employ the total labour 
force available, or at least not possible to employ it at a real 
wage rate at all comparable to that obtaining before the War,

With aggregate as well as individual incomes low, there would be 
very little saving with which to build up the capital equipment of 
the nation, a good deal of the meagre savings probably being re¬ 
served for the payment of relief benefits of some sort. With the 
granting of the loan, the necessary capital equipment could be 
brought into the country to replace that destroyed during the con¬ 
flict, destroyed by actual combat or by undermaintenance* Produc¬ 
tion of investment goods in Holland could also be increased through 
the medium of the loan. With the resultant increase in productivity, 
gain in production both for home demand and for export should make 
itself felt. Unemployment should decrease and the shortages of 
many types of goods tend to disappear* Prices of consumption goods 
and of some producers’ goods should drop and a consequent rise in 
real wages should make itself apparent within a relatively short 
time. The same problem of latent desand engendered by the War 
exists in Holland that exists in Canada, but in a more acute form, 
and it would have an effect on the speed with which readjustment 
could be made, depending upon how quickly the most urgent needs 
could be met. 

The short-nm result of the loan so far as Canada is con¬ 
cerned would be an increase in exports and for The Netherlands, an 
increased in imports. 

The repayment phase of the transfer presents rather different 
problems. To begin vdth, the terms of the loan are such that repay-

ment, as well as annwal interest payments, may be made in Canadian 
dollars or in fine gold* Whereas there were no effects on either 
country from the exchange rate varying in the first phase, there 
is a definite possibility of there being some in the repayment of 
the loan* The ordinary result which might be expected from the 
second part of the transaction is a lowering of the price of 
Dutch-produced goods in terms of Canadian dollars because the 
guilder woxild have depreciated due to the abnormally large amount 
on the market seeking Canadian dollarso As a consequence Dutch 
exports should increase and Canadian exports decrease« The actual 
extent to which the exchange rate would be affected would also de¬ 
pend upon monetary policies of the governments at the timej i»diether 
stable rates were being maintained or not* If payment were made in 
gold instead, the result would be the same although arrived at 

more indirectly through changes in the quantity of money in cir- 

1 

culation, provided of course that the gold was not sterilized* / 

The extent of this effect depends upon the size of the remitt€ince 
in comparison with the national income; in the case of the re¬ 
payment of the Dutch loan that proportion is very small* Commen¬ 
cing in 1950 an amount somewhat less than $5 million will come due 
each year* In addition, interest must be paid annually* This sum 
will start at about $3 million and over the twenty-seven year 
period will decline to a final figure of some $172,000. Of these 

1* It has been assmoed that the velocities of cirexalation have not 
changed in sufficient degree to offset any effect upon the price

amounts remitted to Canada, it is quite probable that a part may 
be financed through Canadian capital being invested in Dutch enter¬ 
prises if the terms are attractive enough, rather than through 
increased Canadian imports of goods from The Netherlands* 

It would be indicated, therefore, that with the repayment 
based as it is on small amoimts each year for a long period, the 
effect at any one time will not be very great on the economy of 
either nation. It is likely that the long spread of time over 
which the loan is to be paid back was specifically designed to 
prevent any great disequilibrating effects. In addition it should 
also even out the hardships which might be caused to either party 
to the agreement by fluctuations in the general price level resul¬ 
ting from possible business cycle disturbances* 

The theme dealing with the actual mechanism of transfer and 
its effects on the economies of both the Dominion and Holland having 
been completed, that with the relationship of Canada to other 
countries such as Great Britain and the United States must be con¬ 
sidered* 

The first situation to note, as indicated before, is that 
Canada has made loans to coiantries other than The Netherlands, 
and that these loans have been of such a size as to render the 
total quite remarkable, particularly when the position of Canada 
as a capital importer before the War is remembered* The loan to 

the United Kingdom was for the amount of $1 t billion and the effects

of the Dutch loan pale into insignificance beside it, the latter 
being just the size of the other* Aid has also been extended 
to France (|242,500,000), to Belgium ($100,000,000), and to China 
($60,000,000), very large amounts* A grant of $15 million was 
made to The Netherlands East Indies for the purpose of stimulating 
the Dominion*s trade. The study made of the effects of the loan 
to Holland points out the chief changes which should result from 
it. The other advamces mentioned serve to reinforce those trends 
or tendencies discovered in the study. Therefore, although the 
actual effects engendered by the Dutch loan are very small, the 
general findings are valid* 

Next, the importance of Canada’s trad® with these other 
nations must be taken into consideration. It is true that the 
Dominion has found The Netherlands to be about her eighth t© tenth 
best customer throughout the pre-war years, but the portion of 
Canadian exports actually going to that country was very small 
(about 1.2%) \diereas the United Kingdom and the United States were 
very important both as customers and as sources of imports. In 
the latter category too, Holland was relatively unimportant to 
Canada. V^hen the amounts of trade with those two nations in parti- 
cular are contrasted with that between The Netherlands and Canada, 
it is seen that even relatively large changes in the terms of trade 
as a result of the Dutch loan would be quite unimportant, even 


inconsequential, in the light of the results which might obtain

with minor changes among the combination of Great Britain, the 
United States and Canada, as changes even between the first two 
woiild have ramifications affecting the Dominion. 

With the effects of the grsjiting of the loan deteradned to 
some extent and also those of the repa3n3ient of it, it might still 
be c^led into question how important the actual repayment is felt 
to be by the Canadian authorities. Although no such comment has 
been made officially, the possibility exists that the aid extended 
was one of the easiest ways to bridge the gap of reconversion from 
war to peace and that the beneficial effects are great enough that 
they would outweigh any deleterious ones resulting from non-payment 
when the serials become due. It is, however, highly improbable 
that The Netherlands would default on such an obligation. The 
humanitarian motive behind the loan must also be considered* It is 
very unlikely that the project was embarked upon purely with the 
object of making a business profit from the extreme needs of the 
Dutch people*

Section V 

The Dutch Political Situation 
and 

Its Influences 

The eventual course of trade between Canada and The 
Netherlands will depend somewhat on the political atmosphere within 
the Dutch Empire* That situation will determine to a great extent 
the commercial policies to be followed^ and accordingly as those 
policies are restrictive and nationalistic or not, they will set 
the pattern of commerce, or at least modify the pattern endeavour¬ 
ing ‘ to establish itself* The governmental and political structure 
in The Netherlands proper will be studied first and then that in 
the parts of the Empire outside Continental Europe* 

No historical development of the parliamentary system in 
Holland need be attempted but the set-up existing during the period 
examined in Section I should be outlined* The king (in the present 
case in Holland, the queen) governs with his ministers and the king 
is inviolable, he cannot be called to account for his actions* 

The obvious difficulties to democracy are overcome through the 
ministers being responsible for all acts| each decree is signed by 
the minister whose portfolio is interested as well as by the king* 
That minister is responsible to parliament and so to the people* 
Parliament is called the *States-Gener€d* and consists of two 
Chambers* The members of the First Chamber (the less powerful) 
number 50 and are elected by the provincial states or parliaments;

the Second Chamber members, nximbering 100, are sent to the States- 
General by the general electorate, the system of voting being 
proportional representation by parties rather than by candidates* 
The 50 members in the First Chamber are elected for si* years, with 
half retiring at the end of each three year period} those in the 
Second Chamber are elected for four years straight* Following an 
election, the king selects a cabinet organizer from the foremost 
men of the Second Chamber. He in turn selects likely candidates 
for a ministry and presents them to the monarch for appointment 
or not as the latter seds fit* If any of those chosen are members 
of the Chamber, they cease to be members on becoming part of the 
government and those seats are vacant* 

The king shares legislative authority with the States- 
General* Legislation is proposed by the king (on the advice of his 
ministers) to the Second Chamber, which body can make alterations 
in it. The measure is then passed to the First Chamber for dis¬ 
cussion and approval. The king must give the royal sanction to 
the amended legislation before it is published in the Staatsblad 
(the Government Record or Official Gazette) and becomes law* Only 
the government has the authority to propose budgetary matters but 
ordinary legislation may be initiated by the Second Chamber* The 
First Chamber, the weakest of the governmental bodies, cannot 
even propose legislation directly* In contra-distinction to the 
Canadian system, the Chambers meet at their own will and not at

the behest of the government* Normally they are in session, but 

not sitting except when called, all but four days of the year* 

In striving through proportional representation to give 

complete democratic expression to the will of all the people, 

Holland found herself before the War beset by numbers of parties 

and pressure groups each striving to gain recognition and to make 

its voice heard in parliament. As an example, it may be pointed 

out that in the election of 1933 there were 54 groups presented to 

the nation, of which 14 received enough support to gain at least 

1 

one seat in the Second Chamber. / The result of such a multi** 
plicity of parties has been that the only government which could 
function was a coalition of parties and groups who could sink their 
differences sufficiently to co-operate. This condition has ob¬ 
tained since the early 1920*s. One of the reasons for the great 
number of parties was the fact that politically the people were 
split not only according to general social beliefs but religious 
ones as well. Thus a structure of parties imagined as a vertical 
stratification by social policies was divided horizontally accor¬ 
ding to religion in addition. With such a diversity of beliefs 
and principles to be reconciled it was to be expected that many of 
the coalitions would be weak, as proved to be the case. It was 
not vhtll the crisis of 1939 that the Social Democrats who commanded 
23 out of the 100 seats would enter a government. The Social

Democrats (Social-Democratische Arbeiders Partij) were in favour of 
radical labour legislation and eventiial nationalization of indus¬ 
try and land. It was this government, or at least ceartain ministers 
from it, which fled to London when Holland was overcome by the 
Germans. Dr. Gerbrandy was the premier and head of the government- 
in-exile • 

Back in The Netherlands, the Reichskoramissar Seyss-Inquart 
disbanded all the important parties on July 5fl941> leaving the 
field open for the pro-German National Socialists. In London, as 
the liberation approached, a crisis developed which ended in Dr. 
Gerbrandy forming a cabinet in which there was no representation of 
the Catholics or the Commimists, two groups which were very effed- 
tive in building up the resistance movement* Only one Resistance 
member was included. This was the government which returned to 
Holland when it was freed in May of 1945. Within a week, Professor 
Schermerhorn had formed his "Netherlands Peoples Movement”, a 
non-religious, rather socialistic party. By the end of June, 
Schermerhorn who was a member of the Resistance was asked to form 
a government. The cabinet was made up mainly of people who had been 
connected with the underground. Schermerhorn was succeeded by Dr. 
Beel in July, 1946. Since that time there has been a strong 
support of leftist tendencies, a fairly natural reaction when the 
circumstances of Dutch political life from the late 1930*3 are con¬ 
sidered.

The Dutch Empire has consisted of four administrative 
areas since 1922* These are The Netherlands, The Netherlands Indies, 
Surinam, and Curasao* During the War they were declared to be four 
separate parts of the Kingdom. Of Surinam and Curasao little need 
be said as the populations there are relatively small; there has 
existed a measure of representative government though not self- 
government for a great .part of the twentieth century and no politi¬ 
cal upheavals have occurred there since the capitulation of Germany 
and Japan* The Netherlands Indies, the area in the Far East, 
present a different problem. 

Within the area of the Indies are to be found about 150 
different ethnic groups with various civil codes and languages* 

In spite of the fact that their colonial policies have not always 
been in the best interests of the native population, the Dutch 
have striven since the beginning of the present century to give 
these subject peoples a greater voice in their own affairs, and 
with such a diversity of races and ideals to be reconciled the 
Dutch have been a stabilizing factor in the political life of 
the area* 

The first representation was allowed by the creation of 
the Volksraad (People*s Council), in 1916. In the beginning this 
body was predominsuitly European, only half the members were elected 
and could not legislate but only advise the Governor-General* The 
budget was controlled through The Hague. In 1925 local self-

government was started in Java, the most populous section of the 
Indies, and projected for other parts of the dependencyo At the 
same time, the Volksraad was made co-legislative and discussion 
of the annual budget was transferred to it from the States-General 
in The Netherlands* By 1931 the Council of 60 members consisted 
of 30 Indonesians, 25 Netherlanders and 5 representatives of the 
Chinese and Arabs | of the sixty, thii*ty«eight were elected by 
indirect vote, the remainder appointed by the Governor-General* 
Dm*ing all this period the nationalist movement was 
growing and developing with various groups forming and splitting 
off from other, older groups* The more moderate factions tried 
to bring about a eo-operation between the different population 
segments of the area| the extremists wanted a national liberation, 
bound up with which was a propounding of Marxist principles* One of 
the better known members of this latter category was Soekamo* 

The Japanese, when they had occupied the Indies during 
the War, emphasised the *Asia for the Asiatics* theme in that part 
of the world, more particularly when defeat became inevitable* 

During the occupation one of the chief collaborators was Soekarno, 
leader of the Nationalist Independence Party and Just before the 
final capitulation the Japanese declared Indonesia to be indepen¬ 
dent and installed him as head of the new state* The Allies were 
not strong enough to cover all the newly-liberated territory and 
as a consequence Soekarno had time to establish himself firmly, 
particiilarly when resort had to be had to the Japanese for police

out from Holland as Acting-Govemor-General to replace van Starken- 
borgh Stachouwer who had been there before the War and had been 
interned by the Japanese* He was also the Mini.ster for Overseas 
Territories in the home government* He was willing to meet the 
Indonesians, even Soekarno, to discuss the situation and try to 
arrive at a solution satisfactory^ to both* After discussions, van 
Mook returned to The Netherlands, leaving for the East again in 
January, 1946, to meet the new premier of the National Indies 
Government, Sutan SjahTir[uho had not been a collaborate^ (another • 
old-time extreme nation^is'^^ut leader of the Resistance)* By 
a very close vote the States-General decided to send out an investi¬ 
gating committee and to revoke any decisions made fey. van Mook* 
However, a general plan was proposed fey the latter whereby the 
Netherlands East Indies were to be part of the Empire on a basis 
of equality with special autonou^ feeing granted to Java* 

Professor Schermerhorn on turning the government over to 
Dr* Beel was made Chairman of the Dutch Commission General to 
Indonesia and theCheribon Agreement between himself and Sutan 
Sjahrir was announced on November 13, 1946* By its terms, the 
Republic of Indonesia (Java, Sumatra and Madura) will be recognizedj 
this Republic and the other territories of the Netherlands Indies 
wil3 be formed into a United States of Indonesia which will be part 
of a Netherlands-Indonesian Union, each part having equal partnership

operation between the parts* Defence, foreign affairs and finance 
will be administered by the Union, other matters by the local 

1 

councils* The Agreement is to be implemented January 1, 1949* / 

That there is still a wide area of disagreement is apparent from the 
actions taken by the Dutch military forces in the Indies to stop 
the shijanent of tropical products under the aegis of the Indonesian 
Government, even though in American ships. However, the Indonesians 
seem to be coming to the opinion that they would be better off in 
the long run with some such arrangement as the Cheribon Agreement 
which gives them the protection of an established power rather 
than being left completely free but alone* 

As to the effects that the East Indies problems might have 
on The Netherlands, although the home country stopped exploiting 
the Indies directly as a source of Income in the latter part of the 
nineteenth century, large dividends still came "to Holland from the 
investments in Java, Sumatra and to a lesser extent, the other islands* 
The sale of cinchona, pepper, kapok, rubber and other tropical pro« 
ducts to nations other ths^i Holland provided these dividends and 
foreign exchange for the payment of the import balance of The Nether** 
lands, at least to a good degree* On the attitude of the Indonesian 
Republic to foreign capital, three-quarters of which was Dutch, de¬ 
pends part of the wealth of Holland itself* How that attitude will 

develop cannot be prophesied with any accuracy*

The study of the political situation in the various 
parts of the Kingdom must be related where possible to the pre¬ 
diction of trade given previously* Since the commercial rela¬ 
tions being studied §re those directly between Canada and The 
Netherlands, the effects of political changes in the Empire should 
be traced through the results they produce in the homeland* The 
policies of Holland are not apt to be revised to any degree by 
events in the West Indies, including the territories of Surinam 
and Curasao, which are to be granted a greater measure of autonomyo 
That area, controlled by a larger proportion of Europeans, serving 
throughout the War as the headquarters of many Dutch firms, and 
having its econon^ based on oil the profits from which tend to 
be more stable than from the agricultural products of the East 
Indies, should not occasion any ^eat change in Holland’s former 
commercial policies* The effects of the Indonesiam situation have 
been noted already* Such an important part of the Dutch income 
derived from there in former days that any reduction in income 
from that source will affect the trade of The Netherlands adversely* 
In addition to aigrthing caused indirectly through the 
ramifications of politics in the outer Empire, home policies will 
also influence the trad© between Canada and Holland. Any social¬ 
ization of the means of production, if it results in a standard of 
living that is higher for the bidlk of the people, mean in¬ 

creased exports of Canadian grain unless a nationalistic policy

of self-sufficiency is followed at the same time* If industrial¬ 
ization of the country is encouraged by subsidies, tariffs, etc., 
whether under a scheme of socialism or not, there might be ad¬ 
verse results for the export of certain manufactures from Canada* 
Any accurate determination of the modifying effects of political 
considerations in the Dutch Empire upon trade with Canada is very 
difficult. There are too many imponderables, too many courses 
which events might take within the next few years*

Section VI 

Broader Aspects 
and 

Conclusion 

It is recognized that present-day techniques in produc¬ 
tion and communication preclude a return to complete national 
isolation; it is recognized f\irther that the bi-lateral agreements 
of various sorts resorted to during the 1930‘s were not as advan¬ 
tageous to all parties as might have been desired and that therefore 
multi-lateral agreement and co-operation should be encouraged^ 

To this end the United Nations Organization was established and 
among its V€oriou3 branches of endeavour are to be found certain 
Special Agencies which can have a profound effect upon world 
economic conditions« This effect would be reflected in the trade 

between Canada and The Netherlands and^it is consequently appro¬ 
priate to examine those agencies here* Those to be discussed are: 
The International Monetary Fund; The International Bank for Recon¬ 
struction and Development; The Food and Agricultural Ch*ganization; 
The World Trade Organization* 

The International Monetary Fund was the result of various 
meetings held during the War by the financial and monetary experts 
of a number of the Allied Nations, culminating in the meeting at 
Bretton Woods, New Hampshire in July, 1944. The proceedings and 
the iiltimate decisions occasioned a good deal of bickering, both 
academic and political, but the Fund was brought into being

December 27, 1945 and the first meeting of the directors held in 
March, 1946o The details of organization and administration are 
not as important to our present study as are the reasons for which 
it was established* As summarized from the Final Act of Agreement, 
the purposes of the Fund are: 

(i) To promote international monetary co'-operation through 
a permanent institution* 

(ii) To facilitate the expansion and ^owth of trade, with 

a high level of employment and development of resources* 

(iii) To promote exchange stability and avoid competitive 
depreciation* 

(iv) To assist in the establishment of a multi-lateral system 
of payments and to eliminate exchange restrictions* 

(v) To give confidence to members by providing an oppor¬ 
tunity to correct their balance of payments easily* 

(vi) To shorten the duration and lessen the degree of dis¬ 
equilibrium in international payments* 

All decisions of the Fund are to be guided by the above 
purposes* 

Insofar as the objectives of the Fund are attained or can 
be attained, particularly with regard to exchange stability and pro¬ 
motion of multi-lateral payments with few restrictions, world trade 
will be improved and rendered more regular than formerly* AsvAth 
world trade, so with the commerce of the Dominion and Holland as 
conditions become settled. 

The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
was a product of the same conferences which brought forth the Fund* 
With a capital of about |8 billion to back it up, its long-run pur¬ 
poses were much the same as those of its conference mate* To 
achieve these, the immediate pxirposes were given as:

(l) To assist in the reconstruction and development 
of members by co-operation with private finance 
in providing capital* 

(ii) To provide capital if private finance cannot* 

(iii) To facilitate the transition from War to Peace 
by international investment, 

(iv) To help raise the productivity of members by 
the provision of long-term capital, 

(v) To promote the long-term, balanced growth of 
international trade. 

Both the institutions mentioned started out with some forty of the 
United Nations subscribing and since that time others have Joined 
although one very essential member, Russia, has remained outside 
the Fund and the Bank® The Bank, for all its expressed purposes, 
did not begin very auspiciously; too much weight was being given 
to the political considerations of its loans and not Bsany nations 
(aid can oi0.y be granted to members of the Bank) came forward for 
capital. Early in March, 1947 the Presidency of the Bank was 
accepted by an American corporation lawyer after it had been vacant 
for three months* With this new leadership,would-be borrowers 
came forward and soon requests for over $2 billion were on hand. 

As with the International Monetary Fund, if the purposes of the 
Bank can be fulfilled considerable advantage should accrue to 
Canada and The Netherlands in their mutual trade. 

The third special agency of the United Nations to merit 
study is the Food and A gricultural Organization, There are many 
aspects to this body. Nutrition, Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, 
Marketing and Statistics, but in connection with this investigation 
only the Marketing will be examined. Information is derived from

the Report of the First Session of the Conference, held late in 1945* 
All the subdivisions of the Conference had an interest in 
Marketing* Underdeveloped countries were in need of all possible 
technical information in order to improve marketing possibilities 
so that there would be as little wastage as possible; the more 
developed required aid in improving the existing facilities for 
marketing, particularly in effecting economies in overelaborate dis¬ 
tributive services* The greatest problem facing the delegates was 
to find methods of attaining economic adjustment of international 
markets» The technical aspects dealing with the handling of 
goods, infestation, standards of nutrition, commercial grades, 
physical facilities and so on for agriciiltural produce were con¬ 
sidered carefully and any gains made in these fields would aid 
people directly but the influence on international trade would be 
negligible* The suggestions of the Conference with respect to the 
economic aspects would have greater effect and they are presented* 

The FAO should: (l) collect and publish reports on supplies, 
prices, demand and their trends in agricultural produce; (2) invest¬ 
igate the special circumstances regarding surpluses and shortages 
of the staple products; (3) investigate consumer markets and the 
means of stimulating demand for general and specific commodities; 

(4) study completive distribution methods and costs; (5) investigate 
marketing methods including administrative techniques; (6) study 
methods used for wider distribution of food, especially to classes 
with extra need; (7) assemble and analyze price-support and income-

stabilization policies. Such proposals if carried out effectively 
would tend to regularize trade, with long-rvin benefits to most 
nations. In addition the Conference felt that it sho\ild through 
its organization be able to co-operate with other international 
bodies such as the Fund, the Bank and the World Trade Organization 
through its reports and analyses. 

The last agency to be considered is the one having to do 
with world trade. Only the preliminary meetings have been held 
up until March, 1947 so that no estimate of the influence of the 
body can be made. Its main endeavours lie in trying to promote 
international trade so that the full benefits of specialization may 
be made available to all. To achieve this result, barriers to 
trade must be destroyed, impediments to commerce such as tariffs, 
quotas, and subsidized home industries overcome. The main consider¬ 
ations in this field are political and it will be only very slowly 
that progress can be made in the face of opposition from pressure 
groups of all types in the various nations. Great Britain would 
be very loath^ to give up Imperial Preference, the United States 
the preference with Cuba. Barriers erected for purposes of 
national defence wou3.d be lowered only with growing confidence in 
the possibility of peace. However, such achievements as the World 
Trade Organization might gain would improve international commerce 
greatly and Canada and Holland would both be beneficiaries to some 
extent.

Thus to the considerations affecting trade between the 
Dominion and The Netherlands already noted in preceding sections 
must be added the influence of the various international bodies 
set up under the United Nations. These groups are attempting to 
bring about better relations between countries and with their 
success will come freer trade with less national jealousy; with 
their failure will come the return of narrow restrictionist 
policies on nationalistic lines^ No really clear answer can be 
foreseen* 


The trade between Canada and The Netherlands has been 
traced through times of prosperity, with the world recovering from 
the First Great War, times of drastic business slump in the early 
1930*s, the slow painful return from the narrow restrictions of 
that period (restrictions intended to aid the recovery of any 
particular nation at the expense of all others if necessary) until 
a condition of at least semi-normalcy had been attained by 1938* 
Then came the calamitous events of four-and-a-half years of war 
as a new conflagration swept Europe and spread to other parts of 
the world. Immediate aid had to be given to the war-tom nations, 
and that extended to The Netherlands was examined in as great de¬ 
tail as possible; the effects of such help both on the giver and 
on the receiver were studied, effects in the short-run and in the 




j. wii'W;

long-rtm* A consideration of the political situation in Holland 
and her overseas empire followed. The new world-wide organizations 
resulting from the realization that no longer could nations live 
entirely unto themselves were investigated* An attempt must be 
made to integrate all the facets of the study, to arrive at some 
conclusions as to the general trends which Canadian-Dutch trade 
might be expected to take in the future* 

Canada’s imports from The Netherlands after showing an 
increase in the late 1920*s, declined* They decreased slowly 
but almost inexorably, not only in value but in volume as well* 

With the first year of world War II they stopped practically 
completely, only a few items which had previously entered Canada 
in bond being gradually released as the war proceeded* Holland*s 
artificial silk industry could not continue to compete in Canadian 
markets with the domestic product, and Holland twine, once so 
essential to the Canadian farmer at harvest time, lost its high 
place in the imports of the Dominion as harvesting was done to a 
greater extent with combine harvesters and as England entered the 
market to supply a greater and greater proportion of the total 
amount of twine actually used. The Dutch, noted for their pro¬ 
duction of agricultural commodities, were not able to enter many 
of those goods into Canada because of the type of things which 
they raised, mostly perishable vegetable and dairy products; their 
produce was intended for the great industrial areas of Great Britain 
and Germany, places close to the spot at which it was grown*

Of all the things grovm in Holland the only ones of real and 
general interest to Canadian importers were those connected with 
florist stock and that line of horticultural produce* So famous 
were the Dutch for their fruit trees and their bulbs that Canada 
consistently took over half of her horticultural requirements from 
The Netherlands* The actual items entering the Dominion were 
principally bulbs and rose bushes* Of the other stock, Canada 
took only sample quantities from Holland, What the future will 
bring for the Dutch it is hard to predict* Before the start of 
the great conflict there was an increasing industrialization of 
The Netherlands* As in other countries, so there too, the attempt 
to get away from national specialization, and to export one*s 
unemployment to other nations, was seen. Following the recent 
War an atten^t was started to get Dutch production back once more 
to old levels* But what use is high productivity in the Dutch 
vegetable fields, on the Dutch dairy farms, in the cheese fac* 
tories and creameries, in the fruit orchards, if there is no 
longer a place tc market those things in the growing of which the 
Dutch farmers are so adept? The huge market of the German indus« 
trial area is smashed, shattered* The fate of that market is as 
yet undecided by the victors in the struggle* To allow Germany 
to become again an industrial power is to give to the Dutch far¬ 
mers a pjace to which they may send their produce, a place from 
which they can receive in return manufactured articles* To allow

Germany to become again an industrial power is, it is felt, to 
tempt fate to release German destruction upon the world for a 
third time* 

Most probably an attempt will be made to industrialize 
Holland still further, to carry on from the start made during the 
late 1930 *s* In that way the Dutch might be able to stabilize 
their national production and life, in case the special agencies 
set up by the United Nations should fail in their objectives to 
improve international trading relations* And what of the overseas 
empire and its produce? Even though the Dutch might lose their 
political power in those regions they will still have vast amounts 
of capital tied up there. In order to protect those investments 
to the best possible degree, Holland will probably trj also to be 
one of and to stimulate the group of nations who wish once more to 
restore principles of freer trade than has been possible for many 
years. With that lowering of the barriers there would oome an 
increasing flow of goods across international frontiers and an in* . 
creasing return to national specialization, provided of course that 
there was a confidence in its continuance. 

But the rise of Dutch agriculture must depend on the return 
to economic health of the United Kingdom and Germany* Canada is 
interested only in a limited line of Dutch goods and it is improbable 
that there will be any great increase in the diversity of those 
things taken in the years ahead over the variety imported from

The Netherlands in the pre-war years* Probably the only prediction 
that can be made with reasonable assurance is that hortic^iltural 
products and diamonds will continue as important items* The hope 
of renew0d life for Holland does not lie with Canada, except in the 
short-run, yet upon the economic health of that country lies to 
some considerable extent the future economic well-being of the 
Dominion* 

While agricultural products, mainly ^ain, were the prin¬ 
cipal exports from Canada to The Netherlands during most of the 
pre-war period, manufactured goods from the Dominion were becoming 
increasingly important in the list of commodities sent overseas* 
There was, as time went on and the effects of the Depression upon 
agricultural prices were felt, a conscious effort to diversify 
Canadian production in order to stabilize the national economy, 
to insulate it against the shocks caused by violent fluctuations 
in the prices of fam produce* Concurrently with that effort there 
was one to diversify the items entering the export trade as well* 
The fact that it succeeded to some extent was reflected in the 
somewhat larger proportion of non-agricultur€= goods which were 
exported* This action of the Dominion was very like that adopted 
by Holland at that same time, although the latter did not seem to 
require the same diversification of exports at least insofar as 
relations with Canada were concerned since the commodities imported 
into Canada from The Netherlands were distributed over the range

of products to a better degree than Canada*s exports to the Dutch* 
The extended industrialization coinmenced in the 1930*s was carried 
further and further during the Second World War and at the end of 
the conflict Canada found herself to be one of the few unharmed 
industrial countries of the world. Unharmed though she was, there 
were still problems of reconveraion to be met and those have been 
noted earlier in the study* 

Before the War, Canada sent vast quantities of goods, 
mostly raw materi^s and semi-manufactured commodities to Holland, 
at least the Customs records indicated that country as the des¬ 
tination* However, a closer investigation revealed that Holland 
was in many instances merely a depot through which the items tra¬ 
velled on their way to the ultimate users* Consequently any dis¬ 
cussion of possible future exports from the Dominion to The 
Netherlands must be modified by a consideration of the amount of 
transit and entrepot trade which might be built up by the Dutch 
in post»-war Europe and in the overseas possessions* 

Grain was always the main Canadian commodity exported to 
Holland. Of that sent, a goodly proportion was destined for the 
hinterlauad of the Dutch ports, industrial Germany, that part of 
industrial France near the Rhine, and Swit 25 erland* But Canada 
did provide a grekt deal of the bread wheat used in Holland, pro¬ 
vided it, that is, when the Canadian price was fully competitive 
with the prices quoted hy the other major producers* Although

animal products were of no real importance in the exports of the 
Dominion to The Netherlands, there were times when a certain amount 
of them was sent to Holland* As an example, it will be remembered 
that for a while condensed milk was sent to Holland, one of the 
greatest dairying countries in the world, milk destined for the 
most part to be sent to the East Indies* Wood products, mainly 
woodpulp, became important at such times as the Scandinavian com¬ 
petition could be met, and there was a tendency for those exports 
to increase slightly* Following the War, Canadian paper was sent 
over in order to re-establish the Dutch press* The main items of 
export other than the agricultural were non-ferrous metals* Holland 
used some herself but shipped the bulk on to Germany and it was 
seen that the amounts increased greatly during that period in 
which the Reich was re-arming in preparation for the Second World 
War. Small quantities, almost token shipments, of other Canadian 
goods reached the Dutch market, but there was a definite attempt 
being made on the part of the officials of the Canadian Trade Ser¬ 
vice to increase the manufactured goods sent to Holland (and t© 
other countries), part of the general plan to stabilize the foreign 
trade and with that the domestic economy of the Dominion* 

The aid extended to The Netherlands in the immediate 
post-war period, given in the form of a loan, provided the Dutch 
with the essentials for getting their country once more on its feet* 
Whilst some of the aid was taken-in the form of foodstuffs, and 
some in the form of fertilizers’ and special chemicals needed to

render the salt-soaked land sweet again, so that the agriculture of 
the stricken country could regain its former productivity, a large 
proportion was teten in the form of capital goods such as construe•• 
tion materials, heavy equipment, transportation facilities for the 
restoration of shattered communications, etc*. 

Canada will be in a position to benefit by those exports 
for some time, being able to supply the complementary equipment, 
the repair parts necessary and so on* She is one of the few sources 
of many of those articles left intact after the War. But, as 
already pointed out, Holland will depend in great part on the re¬ 
covery of the rest of Europe in order to establish a steady and normal 
life for herself once more. Canada cannot hope to continue exports 
to The Netherlands on the present scale for any length of time. 

Some of the things sent over during the emergency will be useful 
and necessary only for a very restricted period, and when the 
edonomy of Holland is stabilized there will no longer be the great 
call for them. Then too, as the other countries of the world re* 
turn to normal they will be back as suppliers of some of those items. 

On the whole it would seem that the future trade of Canada 
with the Bitch could be divided into two distinct periods, apart 
entirely from the periods considered under the mechanism of transfer 
of the loan. There will be a fairly active interval of a few years 
during which Canada will supply the diverse goods once bought by 
the Dutch from Germany, Grefet Britain and other countries now

desperately trying to lift themselves out of the morass of post¬ 
war productions* But once any semblance of normalcy returns to 
the trading relations of the world, Holland will look again to all 
the nations for her needs* There will be very little buying from 
Canadians merely because Canada helped The Netherlands to recover 
from the great desolation wreaked by wai*; Canada will have to compete 
as to quality and price with all others* With any breakdown in the 
trade barriers which served to make nations self-sufficient, Canada 
should find herself, with the return of many competitors to 

the markets of The Netherlands, in a position to become a figure 
of continuing importance in those markets* As a supplier of grain, 
particularly bread wheat, and flour she should be most notable, as 
she has been in the past. Some of the non-ferrous metals should 
COBB again into prominence as exports, to be used not for armaments 
but structural purposes, and in the making of electrical equipment* 
Manufactures of all kinds wil3 assume a significance which they did 
not have formerly, due to Canada*s increasing industrialization* 

This may be offset to some extent by Dutch activities along the 
same lines. But tempering all these predictions there is the vision 
of the Hollander, who,*,o'’by nature and custom a bom trader, will 
generally purchase only from the supplier, native or foreign, who 
can submit the lowest offerIjnportant as Holland has been to 
Canada in the past and important as Canadian exporters hope that

Rate of Exchange of the Netherlands Guilder in 

Terns 


The table giyen below is supplied throu^ the eoui*tesy of 
the Bank of Canada* It will be noted that the guilder is quoted 
in both Merican and Canadian funds | and further noted that 
monthly rates are included as well as the year ayerages* 

The purpose of the New York figures is to give a comparison 
of movements in the relative value of the Canadian dollar^ in 
order to emphasize the fact that it is not advisable to consider 
one currency as having a stable value whilst all the others 
change* It is of double iffi{K)rtance to realize this when it is 
remembered how great a part of Canada's trade has been carried on 
with the U.S,A* From this it is of interest to see that the 
appreciation of the guilder in Canadian funds from September, 1931 
until about April of 1933 is due to the depreciation of the 
Canadian dollar in New York rather than to a change in conditions 
between Canada and The Netherlands* 

The next point to note is that Holland clung to the gold 
standard (the traditional gold parity) until September 26, 1936, 
at which time she abandoned it in favour of an exchange stabili* 
zation fund. It was earlier on the same day that both France 
and Switzerland had gone off the gold standard; the Dutch were 
left in such a position, as the last gold standard country in

Europe 5 that there vas no other real alternative to the deoislon 
taken. During the period 1933 to September 1936, the guilder 
was quoted at a premium of some 70% above the rate obtaining 
prior to the upheaval in the world monetary situation. Follow¬ 
ing the change in policy in Holland, the new rate was at a point 
about midway between the previous ones. 

From May 1940 until November 1945 no quotations on the 
basis of regular market dealings were given. In the latter month 
a new par of 37.9 cents U. S. wan established . This figure 
(41*7 cents Canadian) corresponds ai^roximately to the •milltaiy* 
rate used during the stay of Allied troops on the Continent until 
late 1945*

Appendix B 


Index Numbei;‘s Used in 
Correcting the * Actual Values^ of Trade 

The purpose in using these index numbers of the prices 
of goods over a time series is to allow the changes in volume of 
trade to become more apparent than they are from the figures of 
the declared values over the series* For that reason the totals 
of foreign commerce of Canada with The Netherlands mi^t be divi¬ 
ded by the index number for the year and the result multiplied hy 
100. This would present some idea of the movements in volume* 
Whilst the movements of prices within a country may safely be 
based on the changes in wholesale prices, when it comes to dealing 
with the items of international trade it is found that such a 
procedure does not serve well enough* Here a difference must be 
made in the prices of those commodities entering the state as 
imports and those going out as exports* For that reason, the 
Dominion Biureau of Statistics gives a separate index of average 
values for both exports and imports* 

The problem of choosing a base year is difficult, althou^ 
in this case the choice is limited to two possibilities, 1926 and 
1936• Because of the inadvisability of retaining a base year too 
long, with the consequent tendency towards distortion of results. 
The Dominion Bureau of Statistics adopted 1936 as the base in 
price-index calculations from the year 1937 onwards* It is felt, 
nevertheless, that the better year to use in the present study

would be 1926 , since the data extend only to 1939 and the 
weighting factor might cause more serious discrepancies if the later 
base year were to be used retroactively to 1925♦ The numbers used 
are taken from "Trade of Canada Fiscal Year Ended March 31” for 
the years 1927, 1931, 1935 and 1939* Due to the change in base 
year from 1937 onwards, it is necessary to convert the figures 
for the latter period to a 1926 base* This is done by means of 
the formula: 

Given Year Index (1936 base) x 1936 Index (1926 base) 

100 

The results check out closely against the 1935 index which is 
given on both bases by the original source* 

The next difficulty is to be found in the weighting of the 
different items entering into trade* "Trade of Canada” gives 
average values based on the cost of obtaining in the given year the 
quantities of the good moving in the base year, this cost being 
expressed relatively to the cost in the base year* This method 
of weighting can lead to a considerable margin of error* The 
same problem presents Itself in determining Aether to use the 
average index for all exports and imports or to modify the totals 
under each customs group and then to add these* The latter course 
is followed since it overcomes some of the distortion which would 
be present if averages for the total figures were used* Therefore

the data presented below are given on the basis of the nine main 
Canadian Customs Classifications, with 1926 as the base year and 
divided into an index of prices for both exports and imports* 

One other problem remains to be discussed before the 
actual index numbers are given. It was found that two indices 
published by the same governmental source, both relating to the 
prices of exports and imports by Customs groups, do not correspond. 
The variation of the index calculated by “Prices and Price Indexes 
1940“ from that given by the other Dominion Bureau of Statistics 
source, “Trade of Canada“ is considerable* Nor is there consis* 
tency in the deviations* 2 Although this discrepancy exists, it 
is not possible to reconcile the two sets of data* The rejected 
index (Prices and Price Indexes) is perhaps the more accurate of 
the two because its quantity wei^ting is an average of the 
physical amounts handled annually from 1926<-1931* However, the 
information was not available for the complete period being studied 
and had to be discarded for that reason* 

1 As an example, the indices from 1936 to 1939 for the exports 
of Fibres and Textiles (Customs Group III) are given* The 
index based on "Trade of Canada” is followed by that based 
OB “Prices and Price Indexes’* enclosed in brackets* Both use 
1926 as the base year* 1936- 63*1 (50*7), 1937- 69*3 (65.8), 
1938- 67*8 (69.1), 1939- 56.1 (52.8).

Appendix C 

Total Canadian Exports Credited to The Netherlands 

and 

Total Canadian Imports Credited to The Netherlands 

for 

Fiscal Years Ended 
March 31 
1925 - 1939 

The total figures given are derived from the totals of 
the various Customs Groups for which data are published by the 
Dominion Bureau of Statistics® The detailed material on the exports 
and imports of Canada credited to The Netherlands is shown in 
Appendix D; only the summations are presented here in order that 
they may stand out more readily® The tables show the material for 
each of the nine Groups or Classifications which are used by the 
Canadian Customs service ^ the names of ^ich broad classes are self» 
explanatory® However, if a more thorough knowledge of the sub-classes 
is desired so that the actual commodities to be found in any parti¬ 
cular Group may be comprehended, a more exact examination will be 
found in the following Appendix® 

For each year there are three figures in the ’Total* line® 
These are listed as ’Actual Value*, *Corrected Value* and ’Percentage 
of Canada’s Total Export (Import) Credited to The Netherlands’® 

The term ’Actual Value’ refers to the data found in the original 
sources published by the Government; it is made up of the dollar 
values which were entered by the Customs Service as representing

the iBonetary worth of the goods involved at the tiaie of entry or 
exit* * Corrected value* is an expression of the monetary worth 
of the commodities handled in any given year based on the prices 
relative to the base year^ 1926* To make this conversion, the 
index nxjmbers in Appendix B are used. The total •actual value* for 
each Customs Classification in the year under review is divided 
by the index number appropriate to it and the<|iotient multiplied by 
100. The resultant figures on being added together form the 
•Corrected Value* in the •Total* line* The third item states the 
relative importance of Holland in Canada’s whole foreign trade* 

It will be remembered that such relationships, if based entirely 
on the data of one country are not very accurate statements of the 
mutual dependence of one nation on the other* 

In addition to the merchandise exports and imports, deal¬ 
ings in coin and bullion between Canada and The Netherlands are 
also shown. These amounts are not included in the totals since 
they are more gener^y related to the problem of balance of pay¬ 
ments rather than to commodity trade* 

In the numerical tables, exports are set forth first and then 
the imports*

Detailed Statistics of Trade Betweea 
Canada and The Netherlands 
(Fiscal Years 1925-1939) 


The first part of this appendix gives the data taken from 
•♦Trade of Canada” covering the period indicated, and(fealing with 
exports I the second part indicates the import figures from the 
same source« The terms used in the left hand column are self- 
explanatory but some indication of the method by which the Customs 
Groups are sub-divided should be g.lven* 

There ase nine Groups in the Canadian Customs Classifi¬ 
cation, both for exports and importSo They are indicated by means 
of Roman numerals, as I, II, III, etc*. Each Group is broken down 
into Sub-Groups which are shown as capital letters. A, B, C, etc.. 
There are from two to sixteen Sub-Groups in eveiy Group. The Sub- 
Groups in turn are classified by Sections, the intimation of a 
Section being an arable numeral, 1, 2, 3, etc.. As mai^ as nine of 
these Sections may be found in a Sub-Group. The last headings 
shown in the appendix are the sub-sections with the marking in 
small Roman figures, i, ii, iii, etc.. In the source the only 
further break-down is by actual items, the particular commodities 
dealt with. 

Both for exports and imports some liberty has been taken 
with the system in the interests of space-saving where the qaanti- 
ties involved have been of little consequence♦ However, the full
