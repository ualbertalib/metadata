PREFACE 


The following report deals with an investigation on 
electrosmosis carried out by the author during the winter 
of 1948-49. The greatest part of time was consumed const¬ 
ructing an apparatus and developing a technique which was 
suitable to obtain the hydraulic and electric permeabilities 
and the relationship between voltage gradient and hydraulic 
head. The soils used were rather different in their physical 
properties - one being a silt, the other a clay. 

Various observations are reported that have been made 
during the course of the tests and recommendations for 
further testing have been made. Difficulties encountered 
and errors made have also been included so that other 
investigators do not have to spend time needlessly. 

The author wishes to thank Professor J. A* Harle 
for his interest in and direction of the investigation. 
Thanks are also due to Mr* R. If. King,B* Sc. , whose able 
assistance in construction details was freely given and 
greatly appreciated.

GENERAL 


Electro-osmosis, one of the electro-kinetic 
phenomena, is a means of moving a fluid through a media. 
This is applicable to the draining of fine grained soils 
into a well point where normal methods of ground water 
lowering are not satisfactory. The forces involved may 
be employed ina reverse manner also, that is they may 
be used as a potential barrier opposing the normal 
drainage thus keeping ground water away from some part¬ 
icular area. 

The initial phenomenon was first described by 
Reuss (2) in 1808 with subsequent experimental contri¬ 
butions by Wiedmann (3) and by Quincke (4). Theoretical 
development is due mainly to Helmholtz who is responsible 
for the electric double-layer concept. 

The action of electro-osmosis ( or electro- 
endosmosis) has been proposed to be as follows 

Consider a capillary tube filled with a fluid. 
Due to an existing ionic condition in the fluid, the 
inner wall of the capillary becomes coated with an 
electrical double layer, one charge is on the liquid 
in immediate contact with the capillary and the other 
on the capillary. Now, if an external potential dif¬ 
ference is applied to the capillary it will cause the 
movable inner layer to be displaced relative to the

THEORETICAL GOUSTDERATIONS 

Consider a capillary filled with water* 
Empirically it has been found that the water in such a 
capillary moves under electric potential. Thus, it must 
be assumed that the cylindrical surface of the liquid 
carries a charge which must be equal and opposite to one 
carried by the capillary wall. 

Let the charge/cm length of surface of the liquid 
cylinder be tf e n and the applied electric field ft E n . Then 
we have a force acting on the cylinder of 

F = eE 
e 

The liquid solid system represents a cylindrical 
condenser with capacity:- 

C = PS where 
4xrd 

D = dielectric constant of water, 

S = surface area of condenser, 

d = distance between charges. 

If the capillary is assumed to be of unit length 
and to have a circular cross section of radius ,f r". 

S = 2rrr 

C = -§rrD « rp

Prom this the following results are:- 

(1) Amount of water transferred is proportional to the 

square of the radius of the capillary ( within limits 

the applied potential and a factor P^ 

4q 

(2) Since ^ is proportional to e, the amount of liquid 
moved is directly proportional to the quantity of 
electricity conducted. This is Wiedemann’s Law, 

We can consider the factor DtP as a charac- 
teristic constant of the solid-liquid interfacial 
system. Since P and rq are statistical averages, 
dependant upon temperature, and ^ is always associated 
with P and iq, it is best to let Ptf - k Q . 


We now have:- V - r^k^S

system contain n c capillaries, then the volume flow is,

we have Vp = knE, or for nk = k e 

Vp = kgE . 

This expression is the same as that derived 
by Darcy for the flow under hydrostatic head. If we 
say that the flow due to hydrostatic head is Yg = kl 
where k is the coefficient of permeability, and I is 
the hydraulic gradient, the total velocity of pore water 
resulting from the summation of electrostatic and hydrostatic 
heads will be given by 

It = !p + Vg 

= kgE + kl 

From this equation, we may compute the rise in 
piezometric head with time. If we say, 

F = cross section of piezometric tube 

A = cross section of the sample 

h = height of rise at constant level at time 
t after starting the test 

k = coefficient of permeability in cm/sec.

in cm^ per volt sec.

It might be well to observe that in the 
derivation of these equations, some very important 
influences have been neglected* These are: - 

(1) Electrolysis occurs at the cathode 
due to the galvanic current in the capillaries* 

(2) Conductivity of the soil particles was 
neglected* 

A more accurate consideration would be as 
given by Smoluchowski (6)* This is as follows: - 
the current is composed of a galvanic phase, a 
surface current transporting the charges of a 
double layer , a third phase flowing through the 


particles* Thus, the form of the velocity

distribution in the capillaries is not yet clear 
and will have to be found by physical researches# 

In the laboratory it has been found that the 
effect of electrosmotic disturbances is considerable 
During the experiment polarization of the electrodes 
and increases in electrical resistance have been 
observed# It has also been observed by others 
that accessory phenomena influenced osmotic rise (6) 
These influences would be less evident in the field 
due to a large scale application, whereas in the 
laboratory, they are of considerable importance# 

We should, therefore, apply values found in the 
beginning of the experiment that have not been 
influenced very much by accessory phenomena# If 
we consider the equation

EXPERIMENTAL WORK in ELECTROSMOSIS 

The work undertaken by the author consisted of 
developing a technique for the determination of the 
hydraulic and electric permeabilities k and k e and 
obtaining a relationship between potential gradient and 
hydrostatic head. The soils used were Calgary silt 
(from the mudslide on the North Hill) and B.C. Clay 
(Fairmont). Their properties are shown below.

Apparatus and Test Procedure 


The following items of equipment were employed: 

(1) D.C. Power supply unit 

(2) Potential Divider 

(3) Electrosmometer 

(4) pressure gauge 

(5) constant pressure apparatus. 

The electrosmometer is much the same as the one 
described by Gueze, de Bruyn and Joustra (5) but, with a 
few modifications, was made more versatile. It consists

of a plastic cylinder 9*3 cms. long, 4*4 cms. inside 
diameter and .3 cms. thick, fitted with aluminum end 
plates. Iron electrodes were used because it is expected 
that this material would be used in the field. The 
plastic cylinder was drilled to accomodate two burettes, 
one at the high pressure end and the other at the low 
pressure end. The burette at the high pressure end had 
to be fitted upside down so that the hydrogen that was 
liberated at the cathode might have some way to escape. 
The following diagram and photograph are given to present 
a clear picture of the apparatus as it was employed.

Determination of ?T k TT 

To determine the hydraulic permeability TT k TT 
the soil sample was packed and tamped into the cylinder, 
using a wire gauze spacer and a filter paper at each end 
to keep the soil from seeping into the holes in the electrodes. 
The apparatus was assembled as shown above and water introduced 
from the supply to the low pressure end ( valves 1 and 5 
closed). Secondly, water was introduced into the high 
pressure end (valves 2 and 5 closed). Next, valves 1 and 
4 were closed and valve 5 opened so as to obtain a 
reading of atmospheric pressure on the gauge, then valve 5 
was closed. 

By means of the constant pressure apparatus 
(consisting of a brass cylinder with a screw adjusted 
piston) any pressure up to 2,200 cms. of water absolute 
was applied to the high pressure end of the osmometer. 

At constant time intervals the amount of water transferred 
was observed by reading the burette on the low pressure 
end. A constant pressure was maintained by continuous 
adjustments of the screw on the constant pressure apparatus. 

Pressure was read on the PV gauge which was 
calibrated with a monoraeter. 

Determination of ,T k e TT 


As before, the sample was packed and both ends

of the cylinder were filled with water. This time, 
however, it was not necessary to use the constant 
pressure apparatus, so, it was removed and in its place 
a graduate was used to measure the amount of water 
passed through by an electrical potential gradient. A 
potential was applied across the electrodes and, at 
constant time intervals, the amount of water transferred 
was observed. 

This was repeated for both soils for various 
potential gradients. 

Determination of Potential Gradient versus Hydrostatic Head 

As in part one, the sample was packed and the 
apparatus assembled. A potential was applied across the 
electrodes and then the hydrostatic head was adjusted by 
means of the constant pressure apparatus so that no water 
transfer occured in either direction. This condition was 
observed on the low pressure end burette which could be 
read to .01 cc. 

In all tests the samples represented 100 grams 
dry weight of Calgary silt and B.C. Clay. Each sample 
was mixed with an amount of tap water approximately 
equal to the liquid limit of the respective soils. Also 
in all tests of part one, the hydraulic head was kept constant 
while in all tests of part two, the potential gradient was 
kept constant. In part three the potential gradient was

kept constant and the hydraulic head adjusted to obtain 
a balance. 

DISCUSSIO N of EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

In the following the results of the experiments 
will be discussed with specific reference to the graphs that 
are included. 

Constant k 

The hydraulic permeability TT k Tt was determined as 
given above. Graphs 1 and 3 show the linear relation 
between water transferred versus time for constant pressure, 
while graphs 2 and 4 show the linearity between water 
transferred versus absolute pressure for unit time. 

In all the tests the major difficulty encountered 
was that of leakage between the sample and the cylinder. 

In graph 1, the 2,140 cm line shows the effect of such a 
leakage. These leakages must be watched for or they may 
cause much confusion in the interpretation of the test 
results. Calgary silt could not be tested for pressures 
above 1,$50 cms of water absolute because the soil would be 
forced from the sample into the low pressure chamber and 
leakage would result.

These values, except the last, were obtained by 
testing one sample. The variation is seen to be quite 
small, about 5% of the mean value of 1.38 x 10~ 7 cms/sec.

It can be seen that there is a small variation 


in each sample and a larger one between samples. It was 
found, however, that the mean value, .69 x 10-6cms/sec 
gave satisfactory results as is showrn on graph 11.

The coefficient of electrical permeability

described above. Graphs 6, 7 and 8 show water transferred 
in cubic centimeters against time in minutes for various 
voltage gradients. Graph 6 shows very well the difficulty 
in obtaining values that may be checked in the laboratory.

voltage gradients, however, there seems to be no constancy 
about k 0 . This may be explained by two variables in the 
experiment. The first is the degree of tamping given the 
samples - this could not be controlled. This would affect 
the effective value of the capillary radius which changes 
the flow by a squared factor (within limits) as shown in the 
theory. The second variable, which was controlled to some 
extent, is the degree of plasticity of the sample. The 
three samples of the 4 volt/cm line were mixed differently. 
All had 150 gms of soil but the first was mixed with 
75 cc of water, the second with 50 cc and the third w T ith 
25 cc. This shows that k e is considerabl}r changed by the 
amount of water in the samples, being greater with more 
water. 

Graph 7 is for Calgary silt. It shows three 
interesting results in the testing. The first observation 
is that the amount of water collected was greater than 
that supplied in all tests. This means that the sample was 
being dried faster than water entering it. This was 
substantiated by the observation that the cathode end of 
the soil was dry and hard at the end of the tests while the 
anode was still wet. 

The second observation was that there was a 
marked decrease in k 0 when the sample was undisturbed and 
tested again. This is shown by the change of slope between 
the lines 1 and 2, 3 and 4« This indicated that the 
properties of the soil have been altered but, whether this 
is actually the case or just a result of using small samples

will have to be checked in the field. One factor affecting 
n k e tT in the laboratory tests will be the Fe(OH)^ that is 
formed at the anode. The Fe(OH)-^ is observed as a blue-green 
stain moving through the sample. Upon drying, the 
compound breaks down and may be observed as a reddish 
stain, • 

2 i* e (OH) ^ —————Fe ^0^ ^ 3 HI ^0 

During a five hour test it may move up to three centimeters 
into the sample# 

The third observation was the effect of temperature 
on the constant TT k e ,f # This is shown by the lines 6 and7« 
Line 5 (plotted by dots) was a first run on a sample at 
4 degrees C, Line 6 (plotted by crosses) was the second 
run on the sample at 20 degrees C. Line 7 was a first run 
( under as similar conditions as possible) on a sample at 
20 degrees C. From these lines it can be seen that the 
effect of temperature is quite marked, the lower the 
temperature the smaller rT k e n . 

Graph 8 shows that for very high potential gradients 
(up to 10 volts/cm) the results remain the same. Values of 
k e from these curves checked very well with that obtained 
at lower potential gradients. 

In computing the values for the electric permeability 
we have, for B.C. Clay: 

1.12 x 10“5 cm 2 per volt sec. at 6v/cm 
1.5^ x 10-5 " ” » at 4V,/cm 

1.22 x 10-5 " " " at 2V/cm

This shows that there is a maximum value for TT k T 

e 

at 4 volts/cm. The mean value is 1.3 x 10“^cm 2 per volt 
Higher voltages could not be used on B.C. Clay since the 
sample shrank, leakage resulted and the test terminated. 
For Calgary silt there seems to be a linear 
relationship between the flow in centimeters per second 
and voltage gradient. This is shown on graph <?• 

The values computed for T! k e TT are: 

1.14 x 10~5 cms^ / volt sec at 11.4 V/cm 


1.03 x 10“5 
.37 x 10-5 
.70 x 10-5 

1.14 x 10-5 

1.23 x 10" 5 


" at 3.6 V/cm 

" at 4.3 V/cm 

" at 2.9 V/cm 


This shows that there is a minimum value for 
tr k e T? at $.6 V/cm. The mean value is 1.0 x lO^cm^/ volt 
Graph 10 shows the variation of TT k 0 TT with the voltage 
gradient• 


In obtaining TT k e ", the initial difficulty was 
in removing the hydrogen from the cathode. This was 
solved by using a 50 cc burette upside down connected to 
the high pressure end of the electrosmometer. This gave 
the hydrgen a large area to escape through. Smaller 
openings were found to slow up the hydrogen, causing 
and undesirable accumulation.

Relation Between Potential Gradient and Hydrostatic Head 


Graphs 11 and 12 show the hydiestatic head that 
may be maintained by a potential gradient. The experimental 
and theoretical results check very closely, at least over 
the practical range of voltage gradients. 


Graph 11, for B.C. Clay, indicates a secondary 
phase in the relation between the gradients. It has been 
suggested that the higher voltages cause the clay to 
collapse on itself and seal its pores. Shrinkage of the 
sample was observed during the t est, an observation that 
gives some support to the suggestion. 


Graph 12, for Calgary silt, gives very good 
agreement between theoretical and observed results. Since 
the pressure gauge could not be read closer than 20 cms. 
of water at high pressures, the results are well within 
the experimental error. 

In the derived expression for the relation 
between gradients we have:

From this expression we should get the value of k e at the 
beginning of the test. This equation was found to give results 
of the order of 100 times greater than the previous method. 

The reason for this variation probably lies in the fact 
that the expression was to be used with an electrosmometer 
with a large value of F. Our value of F was very small, 
about .12 cm , which would invalidate the above expression 
for our particular apparatus. 

Graphs 13 and 14 show pressure rise with time 
for B.C. Clay and Calgary silt respectively. Tanc* can 
be obtained from these graphs. Graph 14 gives the variation 
in the results for various tests. The brown and red lines 
give results of individual tests and the black line shows 
the mean value. 

Graphs 15, 16 and 17 are of general interest only. 
Graph 15 is a pressure run for various voltage gradients 
( first and second tests on each sample ) plotted for three 
hours. The main observation is that the second test gives 
a slow linear pressure rise while the first test gives a 
rapid rise that reaches a maximum and maintains a constant 
high pressure. The significance of this is not known. It 
is probable that the change in the soil characteristics is 
mainly due to the small soil sample. 

Graph 16 and 17 show currents with time for constant 
potential gradients. It is observed that polarization affects

the current within two minutes. It is also observed that 
for the higher voltage gradients this effect seems to be 
overcome. The current rises again to nearly its former 
value, then decaying smoothly with time. It is not certain 
what causes the current to rise again but it may be due to 
the fact that the hydrogen begins to escape from the cathode. 
Graph 17 shows the variability of currents with the test 
sample under constant voltages. The colored lines are the 
different test results and the black line gives the mean 
value. 


Comparison of Flow due to Hydrostatic Head and Osmotic Flow 

To compare quantity flow it is necessary to use the 
same units. For convenience, the unit will be taken as 
cubic centimeters per hour per pressure gradient.

From this set of values it can be seen that the volume 


of water transferred in 


cc/hour per unit gradient is 1000 


times greater for electrosraotic than hydraulic flow for 
B.C. Clay and from 100 to 200 times greater for Calgary silt

SUMMARY of OBSERVATIONS and CONCLUSIONS 

This research must be considered as a preliminary 
investigation and the conclusions as tenative* Many more 
tests on different soils must be made before final 
conclusions may be drawn. 

(1) Electrosmotic permeability of soil is not constant 
by varies w T ith moisture content, temperature and, to a 
small extent, with the applied potential* 

(2) Hydraulic permeability was found to vary slightly 
with the amount of water passed through the sample and with 
the samples. It is known that it changes with temperature, 
liquid media, integrated total flow of liquid media, influencing 
interface. (7) 

(5) Passage of D. C. current consolidates the material; 

• 4$ for 3C Clay in 17 hours and .6% for Calgary silt in SOmins. 

(4) Passage of D. C* current changes the physical 
properties of the material* Cathode drying was observed. 

This changes the potential gradient in the sample* 

(5) Passage of D*C* current increases the temperature 

due to resistance heating, thus changing the factor • 

4n 

(6) There is marked deterioration of the iron anode 
due to the liberated oxygen (electrolysis) attacking it. 

(7) Quantity of hydrogen produced during tests was 
found to be within J of l°/ 0 of that computed due to the 
amount of current flowing.

($) It was observed that Fe(OH)^ was transferred as 

a blue green stain 1 3 centimeters into the sample during 
a five hour test. On drying, the hydroxide changed to an 
oxide that could be observed as a reddish stain. 

(9) The quantity of water passed per coulomb of electricity 

was found to be .045 cc/coulomb. ¥iedmann T s law was obeyed. 

* 

(10) For practical purposes, the relation between 

hydrostatic head and potential gra d ient may be expressed 

as: * 

h e k e U 

- IT 

where h » hydrostatic head in cms of water (gauge) 

k e = electrosmotic permeability 
k » hydraulic permeability 
U - applied volts 

(11) The values of k and k e and the relationship 
between potential and hydrostatic head may be obtained by 
the electrosmometer. It is expected that the apparatus 
could be used to measure streaming potential and 
consolidation.

In conclusion it is suggested that an apparatus 
be built that is ribbed on the inside and that has probes 
fused into the plastic cylinder• The ribbing would reduce 
the effect of shrinkage of the sample and the probes 
would allow observation of the potential gradient during 
the tests. 

It is also suggested that all further testing 
be done at low potential gradients, up to a maximum of 
two volts per centimeter. This is recommended since, 
although higher potential gradients are interesting, low 
potential gradients will be used in the field.
