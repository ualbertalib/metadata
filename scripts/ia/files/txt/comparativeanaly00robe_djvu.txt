Introduction 




PAKT A 


1NTROUJCTO RY STATEMENT 

Much discussion centres, quite naturally, around 
the topic of university entrance. Certain Grade 12 students 
are “barred from continued study because of failure to meet 
the required standards in the Grade 12 Departmental 
Examinations. The study to be presented on the following 
pages is designed to discover some of the differences between 
those who do matriculate and those who do not. It is my 
purpose to try and make a survey of these differences, a 
survey v^hich shall be both quantitative and qualitative. In 
other words it is my purpose not only to assess the quantity 
of knowledge displayed on the answer papers of the samples 
selected, but. further to determine as -\ell as possible the 
quality of thinking which lies behind the answers set down. 

THE SAMPLING 

The sampling was designed to select the answer papers of 
two groups of Grade 12 students who wrote on the Social Studies 
3 examination in July, 1944. This study, then, is confined to 
but one phase of the testing program, and cannot pretend to be

in any sense complete. One of the samples chosen includes 
150 answer papers in the lower ranges of the H B n category- 
group. The second sample includes 150 answer papers in the 
lower ranges of the ,, C H group. The following table shows the 
range and frequency of marks in each of the two samples.

THE METHOD 

The educational process has always "been accompanied by 
some sort of testing or measuring pm gram and the various 
methods of measuring the results of education, it appears, 
have been subjected to grave criticism in all ages. Be that 

as it may, if there is such a thing as educational achievement 

0 . 

it must exist in some measurable amount. The most simple 
method of measurement is, it seems to me, to gather the 
required data from answer papers and so estimate the quantity 
ofb knowledge there displayed. 

This quantitative measurement is, however, insufficient 
in summing up the results of such a testing device as the 
Social Studies 3 Paper. A certain quality of thinking must 
determine not only the amount but the value of the answers 
to the various types of questions. The question arises, 

'•Does this quality vary as between individuals, and as 
between groups of individuals?” Another question might be, 

"Is the quality of thinking as between individuals and 
groups of individuals measureable?” If we accept the thesis 
that anything which exists must exist in some measureable 
quantity, the qualitative measurement must be attempted.

That such qualitative measurement has proven difficult and 
perhaps uncertain is well known. Nevertheless, the 
importance of qualitative measurement, particularly at the 
Grade 12 level, renders it almost imperative that such 
attempts he made. With this in mind, it has "been my purpose 
to attempt to deteimine the quality of thinking required by 
questions appearing on the paper, and, from a study of the 
answer papers, to determine the quality of thinking shown 
in the answers to these questions. 

THE QUANTITATIVE DATA 

In order that the understanding of the quantitative 
data gathered for this study might be facilitated a system of 
graphs has been devised. One set of graphs, of the frequency 
polygon type will be used to illustrate the frequency of 
scores in the "B" and "C" groups. Bar graphs will be used to 
show the relative standings of the two groups studied and this 
type of graph also serves the purpose of showing the relative 
discrepancy between the achievement of the two groups on the 
various questions comprising the paper. Further, in view of 
the fact that each question includes several items, a further 
use of the frequency polygon has been necessitated to 






\. r 









- 




: 1 ■ ■: i: i 



r * 



















- 5 - 

demonstrate the abi iity of each group to answer the particular 
items within ea£h questions In certain instances, too, 
frequency polygons will he included to show the frequency of 
complete inability to answer various items included in the 
test. The freqient use of bar graphs showing the area of 
discrepancy, a percentage measure, has, to my mind, justified 
itself in that it demonstrates readily the value of various 
questions in discriminating between the two sets of answer 
papers studied. 

THE QUALITATIVE ASPECT 

The quantitative analysis of the answers gives a quite 
definite picture of the relative standing of the respective 
groups. A scheme so readily adaptable to statistical 
treatment does not seem to be available for qualitative 
measurement. Fortunately, however, some conclusions as to 
the quality of thinking may be drawn from the quantitative 
data. The interaction between the item to be answered and 
the student responding to the demand, results in the answer 
set down by the student . These answers must measure quality 
of thinking to some extent if our testing device, the 
Social Studies 3 Paper, is functioning as it should.

Two of the factors are available for study, the question or 
item calling for a response, and the response received. From 
a study of these some conclusions may be deduced as to the 
mental processes of the third factor, the student responding. 

A further process attempted in connection with the 
qualitative aspect of this analysis proved to be both 
difficult and unweildy. This called for the reading of all 
answers in each group of papers. The answers to any items 
where one statement at least was required varied so widely 
in content and in expression as to make classification 
almost impossible. However, the process was perhaps not 
without value, in that several general impressions were left 
with the reader. 

THE PAPER 

For the purposes of this study the questions included 
in the test have been grouped according to a plan which 
would seem to present most clearly the differences in 
ability demonstrated by the "B" and "C" groups. The first 
and most valuable questions for this particular study are 
the ones which most markedly discriminate between the groups. 
A second grouping of questions has been made which includes

those items in which an approximately average discrimination 
has been achieved. A third group of questions includes those 
items which achieved less than average discrimination. The 
basis of all the groupings above has been the average 
di scrimination achieved by the entire paper. The amount of 
discrimination, based on the percentage of the possible mark 
achieved by each group studied, will be presented in 
graphical form as the "area of discrepancy. " 

Por the purposes of this study a further grouping has 
been found necessary. Each of the three basic groups of 
questions has been subdivided into those which called forth 
a better than average response and those which called forth 
a less than average response of the n B M and W C M groups to 
the entire paper, each group taken separately. This 
average has been worked out on a percentage basis for 
Social Studies alone. Since the English mark, which is 
included in the final mark on the Social Studies test, is 
derived solely from one question, it has been thought best 
to dispense with the English results. Any figures or 
percentages given hereafter have been worked out on the basis 
of Social Studies marks alone. The English mark will be 





- 3 - 


discussed in connection with question 8, the item on which 
the English mark was based. 

The table on the following page presents the system 
adopted in grouping the questions. 

A reference to the table of grouping brings to light 
a number of facts which are listed below: 

1. The questions under Category 1, the questions, 
that is, which have achieved the greatest discrimination 
between the H B" and "C n groups, are also those which proved 
most difficult. In five out of the eight questions, the 
response of both the "B" and "C" students was beiow their 
average achievement on the entire paper. In three of the 
questions under Category 1 the response of one group was above 
its average for the entire paper, the achievement of the other 
group being below its average on the entire paper. 

2. No question which achieved greater than average 
discrimination between the groups studied elicited an above 
average response by both groups. 

3. The response to the two questions listed under 
Category 2 was better than average by both groups of students. 

4. Of four questions listed under Category 3, one

question proved difficult for 'both groups while on the other 
three the response of Doth groups was above average. 

* 

5. It appears that, generally speaking, those 
questions which are difficult for one group are difficult 
for the other. The same follows for the less difficult 
quest ions. 

6. The questions listed under Category 1 (c) would 
seem to have best served the purpose of discriminating 
between the "B" and "C" groups, in that the "B" students 
achieved, as a group, better than average marks. The "C" 
students,on the other hand, received less than average marks 

The problem which arises out of the findings listed 
ab<ove is to endeavor to seek in the questions the reasons fcr 
the differences in achievement shown. What type of thinking 
is required in each Category and class? Can these "types” of 
thinking be grouped by themselves into categories which will 
match the Categories and Classes listed in the preceding 
table? If this should prove to be the case, then certainly 
some progress has been made in the direction of determining 
the quality of thinking which lies behind the answers. 

Before such an attempt is made, however, a more detailed 
analysis of the questions under each aroup must be carried 


out .

In order that an understanding of the question analysis 
may be facilitated the following graph showing the relative 
standings of the H B W and M C H groups is presented. It vdll he 
noticed that, with the English marks excluded, the grouping 
overlaps. This does not occur when the English marks are 
inc.luded. The uniformity of the sampling is clearly 
demonstrated, the ”B" group curve being shoMi in black, and 
the W C H group curve in red. The class interval chosen is 
three. The area shorn in green is not meant to indicate 
the number of ”C" students actually better than some "B" 
students in Social Studies achievement, but is merely 
intended to indicate the fact that such a group exists. 

That is, some n C M students suffered with the inclusion of 
English maiks into the final score. The reason for this 
will be made clear by an examination of the correlation 
tables for "B” and ,, C” groups on the succeeding pages. Both 
tables demonstrate a very definite n egative trend. The 
students whose achievement in Social Studies was high 
suffered with the inclusion of the English mark, while those 
whose Social Studies achievement was low, gained with the 
inclusion of the English mark. Those students whose

achievement was poor in both Social Studies and English, 
are not included in the samples selected. It can he 
safely stated, then, that the inclusion of the English mark 
did not serve as a discriminatory factor within each of 
the groups studied, hut it did serve to segregate the two 
groups. Because of this lack of positive correlation with 
Social Studies achievement, the English will he treated, as 
stated before, in connection with the item (Question 8) on 
which it was marked and will he considered as a separate 


item

PABT B 
CATEGORY I 

Since the first of the three categories into vehich 
the questions on the Social Studies Paper have been grouped 
promises to he the most interesting and enlightening by 
virtue of the high ratio of discrimination of the items 
which this category includes, the analysis of this group of 
questions will he first undertaken. Further, since it is 
solely on the three items listed underclass (c) of this 
category that what might he termed an absolute discrimination 
between the "B" and "C " groups is achieved, these items will 
he dealt with first. The term "absolute discrimination" is 
here used to denote the fact that on these particular items 
(Questions 3, 7, and 12) the "B" group achievement was 
better than average while the "C " group was below average 
in achievement. 


QUESTION 3 

Question 3 is based on a map of the Ear Eastern War 
Theatre, and the items to be located are those of Pre-war, 
present, and post-war interest. Thirty places or regions 
are to be located on the map .supplied. Six of the regions

are mentioned by nane, and location only is demanded. The 
remaining regions are to be indicated without names and the 
places to be named are indicated on the map by numbers. 

The response of the two groups of students is shown 
graphically on the following page. Total possible marks for 
Question 3 were twenty-three, but no student of either group 
received more than twenty. Two ”0" students received no

weighted toward the upper half of the scale of scores, while 
the n C H group curve is weighted toward the lower half of the 
sca^le of scores. The second in the series of graphs concerned 
with Question 3 presents, by means of bar graphs, the relative 
standing of both groups. The bar graphs in black show the 
average achievement of the "B" group on the entire paper, as 
percent of possible achievement, and the average percentage 
achievement on Question 3. The "B" group achievement, here, 
is better than their average achievement on the entire paper. 

The bar graphs in red refer to the "C H group, showing, 
first, their average of achievement on the entire paper and 
second, their average achievement on Question 3. The

average for the "C" group? A study of the responses to the 
various items included in the question may serve to segregate 
those items causing the discrimination.

The preceding table shows for the items in Group X 
an average discrimination of approximately 19$. For the 
items included in Group Y the average discrimination is 
about 7.8$ and the items in Group Z achieved an average 
discrimination of approximately 16$. 

It will be noted that the items comprising Group X 
are of a more general nature than those listed under 
Group Y and Z. Further, in all cases, excluding only the 
items. Mandated Areas, and Allied attacks, the places were 
named . location only being required. The remaining tv;o 
items requi led a general knowledge of* pre-war and present 
conditions. If a tentative conclusion may be drawn here, 
we might state that those items calling for a general type 
o f knowledge and for rec og nit ion appear to achieve the 
greatest average d iscriminat i ai between the: "B" and "C" 
group students. 

The items listed under Group Y achieved, on the 
average, the lowest amount of d isc liminat i on and in general 
appear to be those places which would not be so likely to be 
"crammed" for this particular test, or to be those almost 
certain to be "crammed.” as "Tokyo" and "New Guinea", which 















- 25 - 


are the two "best known” items in Question 3. The above 
findings might, tentatively, seem to indicate that items 
not concerned particularly with the work of the term do not 
serve to discriminate so definitely between the "B M and M C w 
groups. Further, those items which are very obviously likely 
to be included in the test do not serve to discriminate 
between these groups of students. 

The items included in Group Z achieved a discrimination 
of about 16$ or approximately an average amount of 
discrimination as compared with that achieved on the entire 
question. The items included in Group Z are those which in 
general were of particular interest during the school tern 
preceding this test and which might have been judged to be 
included in the test. These items, too, are more detailed 
and ability to name , as well as recognize locations, is 
required. We might conclude that the "B H group show better 
ability in detailed recall of both locations and names, than 
the ”C " group. Peihaps, too, it might be concluded that the 
"B" group students are better "crammers". 

There follows a list of items most often correctly 
answered by the two groups of students.

It is perhaps worth noting that in answering the items 
listed here the "B" group were superior in all cases and 
further, that, proportionately, the greater number of items 
are those appearing under Group X, which required location - 
only, the names being given . The two "best known" items are 
those likely to be we 11 known or "crammed". The discrimination 
achieved by such items is low . The two most "poorly answered" 
items were item 6 (Paramushiro) and item 17 (Coral Sea). The 
discrimination achieved by these items is low. An important 
exception is itemo (Japanese Mandated Area) which achieved 
good discrimination though poorly answered by both groups. 



























- 27 


The answer would he based on general historical knowledge, 
not current interest. In general.it appears likely that 
items too well known and too little known do not 
discriminate between the "B” and ”C M grcups. 

GENERAL STATEMENT 

It is perhaps not proper, here, to draw any fixed 
conclusions, but for the purpose of this study, it is 
perhaps permissible to set down these points. 

1. The "B" group seems to demonstrate relatively better 
ability than the U C 11 group to recognize and locate regions 
of more general application to the course in Social studies 

2. The "B” group shows relatively better ability than 
the ,, C” group to name the more detailed place names of 
current interest. 

3. Those items either very well or very poorly answered 
achieved relatively little discrimination between the "B" 
and M C n groups. 

4. Those places not of current interest did not, on the 
whole, seive to discriminate between the "B" and "C" groups

QUESTION 7 

Question 7 requires of the student a general knowledge 
of conditions in Great Britain and United States from 1919 
to 1944. The Question is, “Compare conditions in Great 
Britain since 1919 with those in the United States in the 
same period, under the following headings: 

(a) Their economic positions at the close of 
World War 1. 

(b) Two problems which they had in common. 

(c) Two problems peculiar to each. 

(d) The political parties that endeavored to 
solve these problems. 

(e) The parties most successful in each country. 

(f) Frequency of political changes. 

(g) Their attitudes towards the League of JN at ions. 

(h) Two illustrations of their close cooperation 
in the present struggle. 

The graphs on the following page indicate several 
important facts. The frequency polygons demonstrate the 
relative achievements of the ”B“ and “C “ groups, the 
black line indicating “B“ group scores, the red line

indicating "C" group scores. The M B W group range of 
scores is from 4 to 20, with the Mean at 11.39 and the 
Mode at 13. The ,, B H group curve is thus weighted toward 
the upper range of the scale of scores. The “C” group 
range of scores is from 2 to 17, with the Mean at 8.8 and 
the Mode at 9. The 'C” group curve is, then, weighted 
slightly toward the lower range of the scale of scores. 

The bar graphs on the same page indicate the 
relative achievements of the two groups on the entire 
question. The green area in the "B H group graph represents 
the percentage achievement on the entire paper. The black 
area represents the average achievement of the W B" group on 
Question 7. That is, the achievement on the entire paper was 
54.42$, on Question 7 it was 56.95$ or 2.53$ abtive the 
ave rage on the paper. Question 7, then, presented slightly 
less than average difficulty to students of the ,, B ,, group. 

The red area in the "C M group graph represents 
average percentage achievement on Question 7. The green area 
represents the difference between this and the average of 
"C” group achievement on the entire paper. That is, "C" 
group achievement on the entire paper was 45.57$, on Question 7

it was 44$, leaving a difference of 1.57$. This means that 
the "C" group students found Question 7 slightly more 
difficult than the average of the entire paper. 

The green area in the bar graph at the foot of the 
page represents the percentage "area of discrepancy" which is, 
for this question, 12.95. This area represents a discrimination 
greater than the average percentage discrimination achieved 
hy the entire paper, 8.848. 

The problem, again, is "What kind of thinking is 
required by the question?" The nature of the question implies 
that those students who are able to respond must possess 
general knowledge of eccnomic and political problems in both 
countries, based on certain specific facts relating to these 
problems and conditions. On the other hand, those students 
who) possessed a fairly good general knowledge of conditions 
and who had the ability to reason from these could have 
achieved at least average results on this question. The 
following list might, then, include the "types" of thinking 
required: 

1. Recall of specific detail. 

2. General knowledge of conditions. 

Ability to reason from general knowledge 
of conditions.

RESPONSE TO ITEMS OE QUESTION 7 

In connection with the analysis of the response to the 
various items of Question 7 it might he stated that English 
ability could he expected to have played some part in the 
discrimination achieved hy the items included. A reference 
to the test paper will show that little space has been 
allowed for each answer, especially for answers with a 
value of four marks which meant that a statement of four 
specific facts was required, one mark being allowed for each. 
The ability to make concise statements of fact, then, was 
indirectly tested by Question 7, particularly in reference 
to items (a) and (c) which carried a full value of four 
marks each. A reading of the answer papers has shown that 
the students of the M B M group were slightly superior in 
this skill. 

The graph which follows presents the response to the 
various items of Question 7, the black line showing "B n 
group achievement, and the red line, "C 11 group achievement.

entire question. The letters of the X-axis represent the

possible achievement on each item. The percentage basis 
was necessitated by the fact that the values of items 
differed. The response of both r, B H and H C” groups to 
items (b), (g), and (h) was above average, items (g) and 
(h) eliciting the best response by both groups. Below 
average response was made to items (a), (c), and (f). 

It will be noted that items (a) and (c) are the two items 
with a value of four marks each. Greatest discrimination 
was achieved by items (d) and (e). "B” group response to item 

(e) was also above average, while that of n C M group was just 
average. The averages here referred to are the average 
achievements of each group, taken separately, on the entire 
question. 

The table on the following page will show, ^1). the 
item, (2) M B M group percentage achievement on each item, 

(3) "C w group percentage achievement on each item, and 

(4) percentage discrimination achieved by each item.

From the above, it will be seen that item (g) achieved 
the least discrimination and that item (h) while the 
response was slightly better, achieved greater discrimination. 
Item (g) called for one statement about each nation, namely 
the attitude toward the League of Nations. Practically all 
the students in each group attempted this itemand, as is 
obvious frcm the table above, the majority of answers were 
correct. Item (h) called for two illustrations of cooperation 
between Great Britain and United States in the present 
struggle. A good many students in bath groups, though 
predominantly in the "C” group set down the same example in 



















36 


both columns of the answer page. The most popular answers 
by both groups included, the Laid-lease Bill, examples of 
war cooperation, and the various Conferences held by war 
leaders of the two nations. The "C 11 group students, 
however, appeared to be more satisfied with one answer, 
set down twice . One reason for lower "C" group achievement 
lies perhaps in their less careful reading of the question 
or failure to properly understand what is required of them. 

It will be noted, further, in connection with item (h) 
that it is the "best answered" item and at the same time the 
item of most current interest. Further, while the knowledge 
required to answer item (g) would be "learned", perhaps the 
"C" group students were not quite so capable as the "B" group 
in connecting known facts to the generalized conception of 
"cooperation", called for in the answer to item (h). 

As has been mentioned earlier, the response to items 
(a), (c) and (f) was below average by both the "B" and "C" 
groups, the response to item (c) being poorer than to any 
other item included in Question 7. Discrimination was 
below average on item (a). The most common answer was

"unemployment". Here, too, the "B" group in general seem 
to have shown some superiority in detailed knowledge and 
ability in concise statements of fact, although not to 
such an extent as to pennit the conclusion that they were 
measureably superior in these two skills. The failure of 
both groups on this item seems to have been due to lack of 
sufficient specific knowledge. In many cases the same 
answers were set down in both columns. In other cases the 
students tried to avoid the issue by repeated generalities. 
I am speaking here particularly of the use of such terms as 
"unemployment", "inflation", and "depression", which some 
students used wherever the opportunity offered throughout 
the entire paper, without indicating any specific under¬ 
standing of what these terms connote. One thing which 
seems to be clear, however, in regard to item (a) is the 
fact that the "C" group students were on the whole more 
satisfied with such generalities and with incomplete 
answers. "B" group students were, on the whole, more 
inclined to attempt complete answers. 

With regard to Item (c) it might here be mentioned 
that this was the item most often "not attempted" by both 







- 38 - 


”B" and "C” group students. Apparently it called for a 
type of knowledge or thinking which prohibited certain 
students of both groups from attempting an answer. The 
knowledge required was concerned with two problems peculiar 
to each of the two nations and again many students answered 
Unemployment” and “inf lation”. Thirty-three “C ” students 
andetwenty-one “B” students could not attempt an answer. 
However, the discrimination achieved by this item was 
about equal to that achieved on the entire question, the 
”B” group seeming to have a relatively better knowledge of 
specific fact8 relating to the two countries. A reading of 
the answer papers showed that the majority of "attempted” 
answers which did not receive marks were derived from a 
general conception of world conditions of economic depression, 
rather than from any specific knowledge relating to the two 
countries with which the question was concerned. 

Item (f) was also of such a nature that some students 
could not attempt an answer. Twenty-five ”C" students and 
eleven "B” students were not able to attempt an answer to 
this item. The response of both groups was below average, 
the percentage discrimination achieved being 12. The item 





- 39 


concerns the frequency of political changes in the two 
countries. Sixty-three "B" students either could not 
attempt an answer or gave an answer which received no 
marks. Eighty-one n C " students, or over half this group, 
received no marks. Many students who received partial 
marks attempted to list actual party changes. The better 
students generalized the answer to "many changes" and 
"few changes" or "less frequent changes". Here again, the 
M B" group students showed some superior ability in 
generalization or general knowledge. 

Item (b) requires the statement of two problems 
common to each nation. The response was above average by both 
"B" and "C" groups, the discrimination being 15 percent, or 
above average discrimination. There were few students in 
either group who did not attempt an answer, since 
"unemployment", "inflation" or "depressi cn" fitted in so well. 
The most c anmon answer was "unemployment" and "conversion to 
peacetime industry" second. Most students, then achieved 
half marks on Item (b), and the marks were generally given 
for the answer "unemployment" which did not necessarily

reveal anything more than a vague general knowledge of 
conditions. Discrimination occurred chiefly because the 
"B * 1 group students revealed superiority in specific over 
gene ral knowledge. 

Item (e) is concerned with the political parties most 
successful in each country. Fifteen M C H and seven "B n 
students were not able to answer at all. A total of fifty-five 
"C” and twenty-one "B" students either failed to answer or 
received no maiks for the answer set down. The best known 
political party was the Democratic or "New Deal" party of the 
United States. A majority of students attempting the question 
received half marks on Item (e), and the discrimination on 
this item resulted from more specific knowledge of British 
Political parties demonstrated by some of the "B M group students. 

Item (d) achieved greatest discrimination between the 
"B n and "C" groups and is concerned with the political parties 
endeavoring to solve the post-war problems of World War I. 
Fifty-eight "C" and twenty-four "B" students either did not 
attempt an answer or failed to receive marks for answers 
given. In the majority of cases in both groups this resulted 




- 41 - 


from the fact that no answer was attempted. The best 
known political parties were the Republicans and Democrats 
of the United States. The "B" group again showed 
superiority in knowledge of British political parties, 

•'Labor” being the one mentioned most often. 

GENERAL STATEMENT, QUESTION 7 

It appeared that a good deal of "guessing* was 
attempted in ansv/ering Question 7. The "guesses" seem to 
have been based on a general and rather vague knowledge of 
world affairs during the period with #iich the question is 
concerned. However, relatively good discrimination was 
achieved and, if anything, showed that the "B" group students, 
on the average, had a relatively superior general knowledge 
as compared with the "C" group students. The following 
tentative statements might be made here. 

1. United States political parties were better known 
than British, but the "B" group showed better knowledge, 
generally, of the British political situation. 

2. The "B" group answers revealed a more specific 
grasp of the details with which the question was concerned. 

3. "B" group answers showed a better ability to 




42 - 


generalize, perhaps due to possession of more specific facts. 

4. "B H group students appear to have some advantage 
in being able to relate knowledge of specific detail to a 
generalized problem. 

5. '‘B 11 group students seem to have a more clear and 
definite unde rstanding of the question itself. Many "C n 
group answers showed lack of ability to prcperly interpret 
the question.

QUESTION 12 

In connection with Question 12 a list of ten features 
of the Streit, Culbertson, and St as sen Peace Plans are given. 
The student is required to write the name of the plan from 
which each feature has been taken. The graphs following will 
serve to show the relative achievement on Question 12. In the 
frequency polygons at the top of the page the black curve 
represents ,, B M group achievement with the Mean about equal +0 
the mean achievement on the entire paper. The curve in red 
shows "C" group achievement on Question 12, with the Mean at 
4.106 representing less than "C" group mean achievement on the 
entire paper. The bar graphs at the foot of the page show,

achievement of this group on the entire paper, (2) that "C" 
group average achievement on Question 12 is 4.51$ lower than

The ability to answer items was varied as can readily 
he seen by reference to the graph which follows. The X-axis 
lists the items and the Y-axis shows percentage achievement. 
Items 1, 8, and 10 received the best response, and item 5 the 
poorest. This does not imply that answers were not attempted 
to items not answered correctly. Relatively few students, 
either "B" or "C"j failed to attempt answers to each item. This 
type of question seems to offer more opportunity for "guessing” 
since -placing the answer only is required. Most students 
seemed willing to "take a chance". The table which follows 
presents the average discrimination achieved by each item.

Least discrimination was achieved by Item 5, which 
proved most difficult for Loth "B" and "C" groups. 

Greatest discrimination was achieved by ItemS* which was 
amongst those Items receiving the best response. A grouping 
of the three "best answered" Items reveals these facts. Each 
item contained a "clue" which anyone studying the Plan could 
hardly fail to recognise. Item 1 reads "Eleven Regional 
Federations, each of which is a cultural and an economic 
unit". Item 8 reads, "The author of the plan is governor of 
Minnesota,, (now' \vifch the U.S. Navy)". Item 10 reads, "This 
plan, first publicised in 1938, proposed the immediate 
federation of fifteen democracies-- Great Britain and the 
self-governing Dominions, the U.S.A. and the democracies of 
Western Europe". Items 8 and 10 could be definitely placed by 
information outside the general purpose and purport cf the 
Plans. Item 1 begins "Eleven Regional Federations" which may 
here have served as a "clue". It is my belief that recognition 
of the detailed facts and implications of the Plans was not 
well known by the students of either group, though ,r B" group 
students show superiority in recognition of these details.

GENERAL STATEMENT, QUESTION ia 

The following conclusions appear to be most evident 
from the analysis above. 

1. ”B” students show about average knowledge of the 
proposed Peace Plans, while "C" students show less than 
average knowledge. 

2. In recognition of details connected with these 
Plans, the "B" group students are superior to the ”C” group. 

3. The items containing the most obvious "clues” 
received the best response. 

4. Those Items based on a detailed knowledge of the 
less striking but eojaally important features of each Plan 

are not"well answered”. Where such answers were correctly 
made, the ”B" group students showed themselves superior to 
the ”C” 


group .

5. "Guessing'” appeared to Toe quite common. Those 
students v/ho did not attempt particular items, generally 
did not attempt the question at all. Those who did attempt 
the question generally attempted every Item, even to the 
extent that one student wrote r *Stasser/ ? in every bracket. 

6. The most "difficuit" Item, Item 5, achieved the 
least discrimination.

CATEGORY I 
Class (T o) 

Included in Category 1 are those questions on the 
Social Studies Test which achieved better then average 
discrimination between the n B H and "C” groups. Class (b) 
includes those questions in Category 1 which proved most 
difficult. In other words, the average achievement of both 
"B” and M C W groups in answering these questions was below the 
average of their achievement on the entire paper. The 
questions must involve a type of thinking or knowledge, or 
both, which is relatively difficult for the students comprising 
the two groups being studied. Though the questions appear to 
vary widely in type and content an analysis of the Class (b) 
questions and of the response to them may bring to light 
certain elements which they have in common. 

QUESTION I 

Question 1 is concerned with a map of Italy End the 
Central Mediterranean Area. No names of places are given 
but rectangles are placed on the map for place-names and

arrows indicate the exact location of the places required. 

Part (b) of Question 1 requires the location of the 
present battle-front in Italy (July, 1944). Part (c) of 
Question 1 requires the naming of three places recently 
prominent in news of Canadian Forces in Italy, iio 
rectangles are supplied for these last place-names. Three 
types of skill are required of the student. 

1. He must correctly name a place located on the 

mep . 

2. He must locate by means cf a double line, the 
position of the battle-front, a. more general type of 
knowledge. 

3. He must locate and name three other places of 
his choice. 

The graphs on the succeeding page show the achievement 
of each group on the entire question. The frequency polygon 
at the top of the page presents the frequency of scores for 
the M B M group in black and for the "C n group in red. It is 
perhaps notev/orthy that the "C M curve shows the greatest 
frequency of scores to be in the area over the lower half of 
the scale of Scores. The "B" curve shows, on the other hand.

a more even distribution of scores over the full range of 
the scale of scores. Two "B” students and one "C” student 
achieved a total of 12 out of the 17 marks allowed for 
Question 1. The curves show too that, in the majority of 
cases, n B H group achievement is better than "C H group 
achievement, but some "C " students are the equal of the 
"B 11 students in this skill. This has been the case in 
all questions studied thus far. 

The bar graphs on the lower half of the page 
indicate the average percentage achievement of each group on 
the entire question. The black area in the upper bar 
graph indicates the achievement of the H B" group. The green 
area indicates the difference (21.95$) between achievement 
on Question 1 and the entire paper. This would indicate 
that Question 1 was “hard” for the "B" group. The area shown 
in red on the central bar graph indicates "C" group average 
achievement on Question 1 and the Green area indicates the 
difference (25.92$) between the achievement of this group on 
Question 1 and on the entire paper. The third graph on the 
page' indicates in green the percentage “area of discrepancy"

(10.82) which is greater than the average discrepancy 
achieved by the entire paper (8.848). It is apparent 
that students of both groups find the memorising of exact 
detail such as is demanded in Question 1 a difficult 
process. Pew names were given which did not belong on the 
map. Many students did know place-names but failed to 
locate them properly. 

There follows a list of place names most frequently

The “best known" place name is "Sicily". Aside from 
this well recognized place, there is no other item which 
was correctly named by as many as 50 percent of the "C" 
group. Aside from "Sicily" five items v/ere correctly named 
by more than 50 percent of the "B" group. In the main the 
trend of the "C" group scores for items approximates that 
of the "B" group scores for items, the first seven items on 
the above list being "best known" by both groups. Item (b) , 
the battle-line^ is amongst the "best known" items. The 
items least often attempted and least often correct are the 
three place-names included in Item (c), Most students had 
either answered all they knew or seemed to feel that their 
duty had been dene. They did net appear to feel the same 
compulsion to answer items in (c) as they did in (a). 

A list of the answers to Item (c) will illustrate what is 
meant by the above statements.

Taranto, Leghorn, Florence, Sangro River, end Elba 
were chosen most often. It seems that if these had been 
located on the map as those items under Question 1 (a) they 
would more frequently have been named. Perhaps the fact of

- 57 - 


having to both locate and name these items made the task more 
difficult. At any rate, the discrimination achieved by Item 
( c) was not as great as that achieved by the items under (a) 
and (b). 

GENERAL STATEMENT, QUESTION I 

"Why should Question 1 prove more difficult than 
Question 5?" "Why should the discrimination achieved b£ less 
than that achieved by Question 3?" Several answers may be 
attempted to the above questions. 

1. Though Questions 1 and 3 both require skill in 
"map work", there is a difference in type. Question 3, it 
seems to me, involves many more items of a "general knowledge" 
character than does Question 1. This might have caused some 

of the difference in achievement, since both "B" and "C" groups 
tend toward lower achievement where specific detail is required 

2. Perhaps a part of the explanation may lie in the 
greater amount of publicity given the " Pacific Theatre" 
operations in the literature, movies, and radio during the 
Spring term of 1944. 

3. The items of Question 1 demanded recall of names 
associated wi th locations. It will be remembered that, in 
the case of many of the "best known" items of Question 3, 




- 58 - 


the name was given and location only was required. 

4. The map in Question 1 required a quite complete 
and detailed knowledge of place-names connected with Italian 
geography and the M Italian War Theatre". The detailed 
knowledge required appears to he the chief reason for the 
relatively low achievement of hoth groups. Little allowance 
was made for answers interchanging two names of places set 
closely together (e.g. - Turin and Milan). In marking 
Question 3, considerable latitude in naming was allowed. 

5. It will further he noted that the "area of 
discrepancy" is not greatly in excess of 8.842. This 
question was of a type which hoth groups found difficult 

to answer. Questions of this type do not serve to discriminate 
as well between the "B H and "C" groups here studied, as do 
those requiring less specific and detailed knowledge. 

6. Lastly, the "best known" items list reveals the 
fact that the items of more general and "long-term" interest 
are on the whole better known and, with the exception of the 
item known to almost all students in both groups (Sicily), 
achieve greater discrimination. Perhaps one would be

justified in concluding that the difference in achievement 
on Question 1 is not due so much to quality of thinking as 
to Quantity , The H B W group students do show more ability 
in the kind of recall here demanded, but in general seem to 
find the same items difficult to recall as do the W C H group. 





- 60 


QUESTION 2 

Question 2 includes a list of sixteen persons whose 
names appeared in the "news” during the 1943-1944 term. 

An important fact was to he stated, about each of the 
persons named. Specific answers were demanded, though in 
many cases half marks were allowed for an answer sufficiently 
specific to definitely “place” the person referred to 
without giving quite sufficient information to fulfil the 
requirement, “state an important fact". As is the case with 
Question 1, a detailed knowledge is required and specific 
statement of facts is necessitated. The following analysis 
is designed to assess and compare the ability demonstrated 
by each of the groups studied, in this field of intellectual 
endeavor. 

The first of the graphs depicting the achievements 
of the “B” and “C" groups on Question 2, appears on the 
succeeding page. Frequency polygons again are used to show* 
the frequency of scores achieved by each groip, the 
frequency of "B“ group scores being represented by the black 
line, and the frequency of “C “ group scores by the red line. 
No member of either group received full marks, the “B” group

range extending from 0 to 7, and that of the ”C” .group 
extending from 0 to 5 marks. Six H B" group and eighteen 
”C n group members show zero achievement. The curves show 
that, in the great majority of cases, in both groups, the 
scores achieved were less than 50 percent of the possible 
marks. The mean mark for ”C” group students was 1.29, or 
16.12 percent of possible marks. The bar graphs on the 
lower half of the page represent the mean achievements as 
’’percentage areas”. It can readily be observed that 
average achievement is low for both ”B" and ”C” groups. 

The area in green depicts the difference between the 
average achievement on Question 2, and the average of 
achievement on the entire paper. It v;ill be observed that 
achievement was low in the case of both groups, the "C ” 
group ’’area of difference” being 29.45 percent, while that 
of the ”B” group is 17.55 percent. 

The final bar graph shows the percentage ’’area of 
discrepancy”, which in this instance is relatively high, 
20.75. Question 2, as a matter of fact, achieved greater 
discrimination than any other question on the entire test.

ANALYSIS CP ITEMS, QUESTION 2 

There follows an analysis of the answers to the 
various items included in Question 2. The graph on the 
following page may prove helpful. The X-axis letters 
represent the items. These are given in the order of 
M Bgroup achievement, those items receiving "best response 
being placed at the left. The Y-axis numerals indicate 
the frequency of attempted and correct answers to each item. 
The graph is designed to picture two main facts with 
reference to each of the M B H and "C" groups. 

1. (a) The broken black line indicates the frequency 
of attempts by M B W group students to answer each item of 

the question. (b) The solid black line indicates the 
frequency of correct answers made to each item of the 
question by "B M group members. 

2. (a* The broken red line indicates the frequency 
of attempts by "C M group students to answer each item of the 
question. (b) The solid red line indicates the frequency 
of correct answers made to each item of the question by 

u C n group members.

observable. It will be noted, too, that the "C” group 
curve of correct answers approximates that of the W B M 
group curve of correct answers. Item (p) , though 
attempted more often than Item ) was not answered 
correctly so often. Item ( a) refers to General Broz 
(Tito), who is the "best known” person on the list of 
items. The most common "wrong” answer here was, 

"Leader of Czecho-Slovakian Partisans". Some answers 
given were obviously guesses. With regard to Item (p), 

"Hon. C D. Howe”, it might be said that there appeared 
to be more opportunity for mistakes. The great majority 
of students knew, apparently, that Mr. Howe was a 
Cabinet Minister, but were not quite so sure as to his 
portfolio. 

Item (b)^ "Chester W,. Nimitz", was also well 
answered by both "B" and "C M groups, though many who knew 
that he was an .American Naval Commander neglected to 
mention the theatre of operations with which he was 
connected. This lack of specificity was about equally 
distributed between the two groups in this instance. 

Item (1) , "Matihe w Halton”, was relatively better known

to the "B" group, than to the ”C” group, achieving greater 
discrimination than any item of Question 2. Perhaps "B” 
group students were more frequent readers of "news" 
articles than were "C M group students. 

Item n C ” "Hikolai Vatutin, and item (e) show an 
increased number of attempts but less success than that 
achieved on the preceding items. In the case of Item (c), 
a reading of the papers disclosed the fact that proportion¬ 
ately more students are willing to hazard a ”guess” where a 
"foreign” name appears. Item (e), "Sir Harold Alexander", 
shows great discrepancy between answers attempted and 
answers correct. Sir Harold Alexander is named, in the 
majority of cases, as an army leader or as a British Naval 
Minister, being confused with A.V. Alexander. It will be 
noted that ”C” group and ”B” group curves of attempted 
answers rise together at this point. The types of incorrect 
answers given were also similar. 

”B” group members were more inclined to attempt 
answers to Item (n), "Sir John Uunningham”, than were "C" 
group members but achieved relatively little more success. 
This appears to have been due, as in the case of items

mentioned earlier, to lack of specific knowledge, more than 
to a complete lack of knowledge. 

Item (i), 11 John w. Dafoe”, poses an interesting 
problem. Relatively more ”C” students than ”B H students 
attempted this item, and were proportionately more 
successful than the ”B” students. This resulted in low 
discrimination for item (i). Many "B H students confused 
John W. Dafoe and Dr. Dafoe of Quintuplets fame. "B” 
students showed more inclination to confuse these names 
than did ”C” students. 

The numbers of students attempting item (j), "Sir 
Ernest MacMillan", ?/as also out of all proportion to 
results attained. This was due to a confusion of the name 
with that of the Hon. MacMillan of the Albert a G overnment. 

Item (g), "Mohammed Ali Jinnah", achieved very 
little discrimination. The great number of attempts by 
"C" students to answer this item perhaps accounts for their 
relatively greater success. As appeared usual with such 
names, a good deal of "guessing" accounts for some of the 
discrepancy between "attempteds" and "corrects". 










- 68 - 


Item (d), M Ht. Hon, Viscount Cranborne n , achieved 
almost no discrimination. The majority of students 
answering recognized him as a British Cabinet Minister 
or placed him as an Ambassador, but few answers v;ere given 
which were correct. Specific knowledge was lacking. 

“Sir William Mulock", Item (h) was confused with 
the Hon. W. Mulock, Postmaster General. A very large 
number of students gave this answer to Item (h). 

GENERAL STATEMENT, QUESTION 2 

The items included in Question 2 required, as has 
been stated before, specific knowledge. The conclusions 
as to the capacity of "B" and "C" group students in the 
type of recall here demanded are listed below. 

1. "B” group students attempted more answers, and 
in proportion could answer correctly more often than could 
"C" group students. H B” group answers show relatively a 
greater tendency to state facts than do "(J” group answers. 

2. General knowledge displayed by both groups was 
actually greater than the marks would indicate, the "B” 








- 69 


group shov/ing some superiority here. 

3. What might he termed "wild guessing” was fairly 
common on hath sets of answer papers. 

4. Confusion of names in many cases may have been 
due to either haste or to lack of recognition of initials. 

5. A demand for specific knowledge appears to make 
for lower achievement hy both groups, hut especially for 
the "C" group, their achievement being relatively lower 
than that of the "B" group on Question 2. 




- 70 


QUESTION 9 

The Italian political and economic situation from 
1918 to the period of \7orld War 2 is the subject of 
Question 9. A complete answer to the various items 
included would necessitate a knov/ledge of specific 
detail, a knowledge of general trends, and an ability to 
generalize and draw certain inferences from specific 
knowledge. The first page of graphs concerned with the 
analysis of the response to this question includes 
frequency polygons indicating the frequency of scores on 
the entire question and bar graphs showing, 

(1) "3” group average achievement on Question 9, 
as compared with their average achievement on the entire 
paper; 

(2) "C" group average achievement on Question 9, 
as compared with their average achievement on the entire 
paper. 

(3) the discrimination between the above two groups 
as represented by the "area of discrepancy". All areas and 
numerals shown in the bar graphs have been worked out on 

a percentage basis for purposes of clarity.

The curve in red shows frequency of "C” group 
scores and the curve in "black sho?/s the frequency of r, B” 
group scores. The t otal possible score on Question 9 was 
13, no member of either group achieving full marks. A study 
of the ranges of marks achieved shows relatively little 
difference "between the two groups, "but the "B” group curve 
shows a more even distribution of achievement than does 
that of the "C ” group, which shows the greatest frequencies 
over the lower half of the scale of scores. The mean score 
for ”B” students is 6.24 or 48 percent of possible marks. 

"C” group average achievement is shown by the mean of 4.843 
or 37 . 25 percent of possible marks. 

The above percentages representing average 
achievement by each group on the entire question are shown 
in the bar graphs. It will be noted that the ’’area of 
discrepancy” is not greatly in excess of 8.848, the average 
discrimination achieved by the entire paper. Further, it 
appears that the excess of discrimination over 8.848 percent 
is caused by the fact that the M C” group achievement on 
Question 9 was relatively poorer than that of the ”B” group.

This type of question, then,while difficult for both 
groups studied is relatively more difficult for the 
“C" group than for the “B" group. 

ANALYSIS OF ITEMS, QUESTION 9 

The graph vdiich follows compares the percentage 
achievement of the “B“ end “C “ groups on the items 
included in Question 9. The curve in black indicates the 
f, B lf group achievement. A "U" curve is approximated, Items 
(a) and (e) receiving best response, and Item (c) the 
poorest, with Items(b) and (d) receiving less than average 
response. Perhaps the most interesting feature of this 
graph is the upward rise of "C" group achievement on Item 
(c). “C" group achievement is indicated by the curve in 
red. Items (a) and (e) will be discussed first. 

Item ( a) asks for a brief comment on the statement, 
“After 1918 Italians complained that they had won the war 
and lost the peace". “B“ group response was relatively 
good as compared with "C“ group response. An analysis 
of data concerned with Question 9 shows that only 
seventeen "B“ students received no marks for Item (a) 
while sixty "C" students received no marks for answers to

Item (a). A study of the answer papers has indicated that 
difference in ability to interpret the question resulted 
in the high ration of discrimination achieved. Fifty-seven 
"C M students attempted responses which did not answer the 
question. Three "C " students did not attempt the item. 

All "B H students’ attempted Item (a), seventeen failing to 
receive marks. The wrong answers given dealt in the main 
with post-war conditions in Italy, not with an interpretation 
of the statement made. A table of scores on Item (a), which 
had a value of two marks, will serve to indicate "B M group 
superiority in specific statements of fact. Scores indicate 
facts stated, since the marking system was designed to be 
as objective as possible.

or made a more general answer, which would receive partial 
marks. A reading of the answer papers has seemed to 
indicate that “both these types of answers appeared more 
commonly on n C 11 than on "B” papers. The "half” marks 
indicate statements too vague or general to rate full marks 
as objective items. 

Item (e) asks for a possible explanation of the Italian 
people’s support of Musso3-ini f s militaristic policy. Achieve¬ 
ment of both "B n and "C" groups was above average, with "C’s” 
relatively better than "B’s". That is^the discrimination 
achieved by this item was less than that achieved by the entire 
question. A total of four marks was allowed for Item (e). The 
following table shows the distribution of marks.

group students received over half marks for Item ( e), 
while more "C M than n B n students received marks ranging . 
from two to zero. Relatively few students of either 
group received no marks. This item allowed for a good 
deal of choice in explanations attempted and many students 
derived their answers, in whole or in part from the 
answers made to other items of Question 9. We may say 
that B B M answers are more complete than "C " ansvvers, and 
more specific , since their marks are generally higher and, 
since marking was objective, each item of information 
received a mark. Although a fairly general explanation 
did receive a mark in this instance, it can be seen that 
,, B M group students tended to set down more complete answers. 
The latitude permitted in answering, here, seemed to make 
this item ’’easy” for both groups. The "B” group range of 
answers was greater, and to some extent, more specific, than 
the "C H group range of answers. A further feature mitigating 
against greater discrepancy was the fact that some repetition 
of answers to other items included in Question 9 was allowed 
in Item (e). The most popular answers to the item are

More than 50 percent of "C" students received no marks. 
Almost the same number of "B" and "C" students received one 
mark. More "B” students than "C" students received two 
marks. The question asked requires an answer which might 
be the result of memorized knowledge. While neither group 
achieves good results on either type, recall or inference, 
the "C” group suffers relatively more than the "B" group.

more specific knowledge than do "C" group answers. 

Item (d) asks for a tabulation of Italian economic 
progress from 1922 to 1930. This item achieved good 
discrimination, perhaps because of the type of answer 
required. M B M students showed superiority over "C" 
students in the factual knowledge required. This item 
was just as difficult for M C 11 students as was item (b), 
but was relatively more "easy" for "B” students. Perhaps 
"B" group students may be inferred to possess relatively 
more knowledge of specific detail but do not possess 
relatively greater ability to reason from this knowledge. 
Pour marks were allowed for Item (d) and perhaps this fact, 
too, mitigated against the "C 11 group, who, on the whole, 
seem to have been less inclined to set down full answers. 
Listed below are answers commonly found on "B" papers, 
which did not often appear on "C" group ansv/er papers. 

1. ‘'Italy became self-sufficient". 

2. "Drained marshes". 

3. "Developed water-power". 

4. "Stabilized currency 1 ’. 

5. "Revived foreign trade".

"B" group superiority in knowledge of specific 
facts is here again revealed. 

Item (c) asks, "Prom what quarter did Mussolini 
draw much of his support in later years?” This item is of 
particular interest in that no discrimination was achieved 
or, perhaps I should say, what little discrimination was 
achieved favored the ”C ” group. One mark only was allowed 
for Item (c) v/hich may serve to explain to some extent the 
"C ” group achievement. Marks received by neither group are 
high, ninety-two M C M students and ninety-three "B" students 
receiving no marks. Of the students answering correctly, 
the ”B” group and ”C” group students appeared about equal 
in ability. Prom the results it would appear that where the 
statement of only one fact is required, "C " students are more 
nearly the equal of "B" students in ability to answer. 

GENERAL STATEMENT, QUESTION 9 

1. Tbe kind of knowledge or reasoning ability 
required by Question 9 has caused this question to be 
"difficult” for both groups, but it is relatively more

difficult for "C" than for ”B n students. 

2. "B" group answers indicate a relatively broader 
basis of knowledge of specific facts than do ”0” group 
answers. 

3. Inhere more than one specific fact must be stated, 
"B" group students show relatively greater ability than do 
”C” group students. 

4. Where detailed information is required, while 
neither group shows good ability, the "B H group is 
relatively better than the "C" group.

QUESTIOH 1C 

Question 10 has two parts each of which includes 
f®ur items from C gnadian history. Part (a) demands a 
statement of the important contribution made to 
Canadian constitutional development by each of the four 
Acts listed below. 

(1) The Constitutional Act of 1791. 

(2) The Act of Uni cn, 1940. 

(3) The B.H.A. Act, 1867. 

(4) The Statute of Westminster, 1931. 

Part (b) asks the student to give one important 
accomplishment of the federal administration of each four 
Prime Ministers listed below. 

(1) Sir John A. Macdonald. 

(2) Sir Wilfred Laurier. 

(3) Sir Robert Borden. 

(4) Hon. W.L. Mackenzie King. 

Achievement by both "B" and. "C" groups was low on 
Question 10, lower^in fact, than on any other question on the 
entire paper. Discrimination is slightly greater than the

average discrimination achieved by the entire paper. The 
graphs on the following page vriXI indicate the above facts. 

The frequency polygons show "B" group frequency of 
scores in black, and ”0” group frequency of scores in red. 
Total possible marks for Question 10 are eight. "B" group 
range extends from 0 to 7, and "C" group range extends 
from 0 to 5. A n cteworthy feature of this graph is the 
large number cf "C" group students receiving no marks for 
Question 10. The frequency here indicates that almost 
one-third of the "C " group could not make a response which 
would entitle them to any marks. The high frequency of low 
scores indicates the difficulty of this question for both 
groups, but indicates also that the question was relatively 
more difficult for "C" than for "B" students. The "means” 
of both groups are low. 

The bar graphs show mean performance, as a percentage 
of possible marks, and compare the percentage achievement 
on Question 10 with the percentage average achievement on 
the entire paper. The areas in green in the first two bar 
graphs indicate that "B" group achievement was slightly 
over ^-3-^ the ”B" group average for the entire paper,

while H C M group achievement was less them half their

is somewhat in excess of the average "area of discrepancy" 
for the entire paper, indicating that discrimination was 
greater than average. The excess over 8.848 is due to the 
fact that "C" group performance was relatively poorer than 
"B" group performance. The form of the question indicates 
that a specific statement cf facts is required. 

ANALYSIS CE ITEMS, QUESTION 10 

Each item of parts (a) and (b) of Question 10 is 
valued at one mark and one specific fact was required in 
answer to each item. The graph which follows indicates 
the achievement on each item. It is clear that Items (3) 
and (4) of Part (a), and Items (1) and (4) of Part (b) 
were best known. Greatest discrimination is achieved by 
Items (3) and (4) of Part (a) and by I tern (4) of Part (b) . 
Item (2), Part (a) and Item (1), Part (b) achieved very 
little discrimination.

From the shove table it may be deduced that 
differences in marks are caused not so much by wrong 
answers as by complete unability to answer. One reason, 
too, for the discrimination achieved by Items 3 and 4 is 
apparent. Many M C M students did not attempt Question 10 
at all and. one-half of the "C" group students did not 
attempt Item 1. Greatest discrimination is achieved by 
those items which proved le£s difficult, that is, Items 
(3) and (4). In explanation of the relatively low 
discrimination achieved in Item (2) it might here be 
stated that the most popular answer by both "B" and

M C M groups v/as, "Upper and Lower Canada were united". 

Although some discrepancy in marking was observed, here, 
the general practice seemed to he to grant a half mark 
for this response. Since such an answer appears to he 
fairly obvious from the title of the Act, it will readily 
he understood that the discrepancy achieved would he low. 
Further, 112 "B" group and 116 "C" group students received 
no marks, either not attempting any answer or giving a 
completely wrong answer. Perhaps the most popular "wrong" 
answer v/as, "United all the Provinces of Canada". 

Item ( o) was best known, as v/culd almost he expected. 
Perhaps the fact that seme students did not attempt an 
answer to this item was because erf the difficulty of the entire 
question appeared so great as to discourage any attempt to 
answer at all. The most favored responses are listed below. 

1. "Gave Canada her Constitution" - (B) 

2 . "Canada became one Dominion" - (B) and (C) 

3. "Canada became self-governing" - (B) and (C) 

Many "C" group students, and "B" group for that 

matter, had alieady used answer (1) and therefore did not 
use this answer again. 









- 90 - 

Item (4) was also relatively well known and achieved 
greater discrimination “between "B" and "C n groups than did 
any other Item of Question 10. The "B" group answers 
showed a relatively greater understanding of the main 
puipose of the "Statute of Westminster" than did those of 
the "C" students. Ability to make a concise statement of 
a known fact was perhaps to some extent a reason for "B" 
group superiority. "C" group answers were inclined to be 
more vague and indefinite to the extent that often no 
marks were allowed. The chief difference seemed to lie in 
actual knowledge of the "Statute" . 


PART (b) 

Item (1) of Part (b) achieved 3-ittle discrimination, 
"E" group response being about average while "C" group 
response was above their average on the question. Pifty- 
eight "B" and sixty-nine "C" students did not attempt an 
answer. Pavored answers referred to Sir John A. Macdonald’s 
part in Confederation, many being so poorly stated as to 
receive only one-half mark. Better answers by both groups 
referred to the "building of the C.P.R." and to the 
"National Policy". Correct answers by both "B" and "C"

groups were quite similar. 

Achievement cn Item (2) was relatively low by hoth 
groups and discrimination was not great. Seventy-three 
"B" and eighty-four ,, C H students could not attempt the 
item and the numbers receiving no rnaits for answers given 
were about equally distributed as between groups. The 
discrimination achieved seems to have been, again, the 
result of superior ability in recall on the part of the 
M B H group. 

Item (3) was "difficult” for both groups but 
achieved greater discrimination than did Items (1) and 
(2). Ninety-seven ”B M and one hundred ten ”C" students 
could not attempt an answer and here again the number 
giving answers worth no marks was about equally 
distributed between the two groups. The discrepancy in 
achievement again seems to have been a function of ability 
to answer at all rather than of any particular difference 
in type of answer given. 

Item ( 4 ) received a better response than any other 
item of Part (b), and also achieved greater discrimination. 
Fifty ”B" and seventy-six "C 11 students failed to answer

"but here forty ,f C 11 students failed to receive marks for 
attempted answers, as against thirty-one "B" students who 
answered incorrectly. Oiily one of the answers appearing 
in the "Key” was given “by any number of "C" students, that 
being, "Present War Effort”. ”B” group "favored answers" 
included the above answer and also, "No Commitments Policy" 
and "Price Control". "B" group answers were more specific 
and indicated better knowledge than did "C " group answers. 

GENERAL STATEMENT, QUESTION 10 

The discussion on the preceding pages makes the fact 
obvious that Canadian history is not well known by the 
groups which are the subject of this study. Although the 
items included are those which might be said to be of 
prime importance in an understanding of Canadian political 
organization and problems, they appear to be outside the 
field of knowledge possessed by these groups of students. 
Eor the purposes of our study the following conclusions 
are stated. 

1. The type of specific knowledge or receJLl here 
demanded makes the question difficult for both "B" and 
|»C « 


groups.

2. Perhaps because of the above mentioned fact, 
discrimination is greatest on the best known items, n B" 
group showing relatively better ability in recall of 
specific detail than 'C" group students. 

3. The items appear to be better known in 
proportion to their "nearness in time". 

4. Where answers are given "B" group students show 
a broader range of knowledge than do "C" students, which 
implies.of course^a superior ability in recall and in 
application of knowledge to the question.

QUESTION 11 


The subject of Question 11 is the proposal of 
Lord Halifax advocating a common foreign policy for 
Great Britain an<3 the Dominions. Also included is his 
suggestion that the British Commonwealth and Empire 

"must be the fourth power in that group upon which- 

the peace of the world will henceforth depend." The 
question demands an ability to draw various conclusions 
from the information given or from knowledge of the 
"Halifax Proposals". Certain recall of details connected 
with the "proposals" is also required in Items (a), (b) 
and (c) . 

The graphs on the following page show something of 
the ability of the "B" and "C " groups to answer this type 
of question. Total marks for Question 11 were eighteen. 
The curve in black, showing frequency of "B" group scores, 
indicates a wide range of individual variations in ability 
but the mode is at 9 marks and the mean at 9.23 or 51.29 
percent of possible marks. The "C" group curve , in red, 
shows that "C" group ability was relatively not as good as

that displayed by the "B” group, the range being from 0 
to 13 marks, the mode at 7 marks, and the mean at 5.83 
or 32.42 percent of possible marks. 

The bar graphs below indicate that Question 11 was 
more difficult than average, since both "B" and ,, C n 
average scores (in percent) were below their average 
achievement on the entire paper. The green areas in the 
upper two bar graphs show that "B" group achievement was 
3.13 percent lower than achievement on the entire paper, 
while "C" group achievement on Question 11 was 13.15 
percent lower than their average achievement on the entire 
paper. The question was^ then^relatively more difficult 
for "C" than for "B" group students. The question, too, 
achieved a high discrimination as is shown by the "area of 
discrepancy" of 18.87 percent shown in the lower bar graph. 
Prom the above it may be inferred that the "B" group possess 
relatively greater ability in the type of thinking required 
to answer Question 11. As has been stated before, the 
question involved recall of certain details, ability to 
correctly interpret the statements given in the question.

and ability to apply the infoimation given in the 
question to certain specific Canadian problems. 

ANALYSIS ON I TELES, QUESTION 11 

The first six items of Question 11 ask for a knowledge 
of details connected with the "Halifax Proposals”. Item (g ) 
asks what difficulties might arise as a result of four 
listed Canadian features. Items (h) and (i) ask for reasons 
for opposition to the proposal and for one argument in favor 
of it. The graph on the following page compares the 
percentage achievement of the "B” and "C ” groups on each item 
Above average achievement by both groups is indicated on 
Items (a), (b), (c), (d) , (g3), and (i). Items (e) and (g2) 
show "B” group below average and 'C " group above. Items (f), 
(gl), (g4) and (h) show both groups below average. Greatest 
discrimination was achieved by Items (b) , (gl) and (g3) 
while Item (e) achieved least discrimination. The Items will 
be grouped as above for the following discussion. 

Items (_a), (b) , (c), (d) , (^3), and (i) . 

It will be noted, here, that Items (a), (b) , (c) , 
and (d) are among those requiring answers involving

specific knowledge nofc given in the opening statement of 
Question 11* Item (a) asks, "Who is Lord Halifax?" 
Sixty-seven "B" and ninety-two "C" students received no 
marks for item (a), vrong answers being either too general, 
as "British .Ambassador", or wrong, as "British Ambassador 
to Canada". Item (b) asked for the naming of the other 
three members of the group referred to in the opening 
statement of Question 11. Thirty-six "B" and seventy-six 
"C" students received no marks. The most common wrong 
answer consisted in naming three members of the British 
Commonwealth, Canada being one member naned. Item (b) 
achieved a high re„tio of discrimination, perhaps partly 
due to the fact that thirty-two "C" as compared with six 
"B" students could not attempt an answer. However, the 
discrimination is partly due,also, to the fact that 
relatively more "C" than "B" students misinterpreted the 
question. 

Item (c) asks, "What was the reaction of the Canadian 
Government to this proposal?" Seventy 'B" and eighty-one 
"C" students received no marks, a great many students giving 
"favored" as an answer or making some general statement

which attempted to avoid the issue as “a common foreign 
policy could not be attained”. The above answer was allowed 
one-half mark. 

Item (d) asked, ”By what ties other than political 
is Canada bound to the Em pire?” Response was relatively 
good. Two marks were allowed for item (d) and almost all 
students of both groups attempted the item. The following 
table will show if B" group tendency to give more complete 
ansvvers than ”C ” group students.

One-half mark each was allowed for any four correct 
items contained in the answer. Most favored answers were, 
•'economic ”, "respect for the Crown", "language", "racial ties". 
The discrepancy in achievement seems to have been due in large 
part to "C" group tendency to set down incomplete answers.

Item (g3) is concerned with the difficulty likely 
to arise as a result of the presence of two racial groups 
in Canada, if Lord Halifax’s proposal were adopted. Item 
(g3) achieved good discrimination, "B" group being 
relatively better than "C" group response. Fifty-four 
"B M group and eighty-seven "C" group students received no 
marks on this Item. A total of one mark was allowed, eighty 
"B w and forty-eight "C" students receiving one mark, 
sixteen "B M and fifteen "C" students receiving one-half 
mark. We may infer from the above findings, I believe, 
that "C" group students did not show as good ability to 
ansv/er as a group, as did "B" students, but that some "C" 
students were as capable of answering as were the "B" 
student s. 

Item (i) asked for one argument in favor of the 
Halifax proposal. Fifty-nine "B” and eighty-five "C" 
students received no marks. Of these thirty-nine "C" 
and only sixteen "B" students could not attempt an answer. 

Of those who did answer correctly most received the full 
score of one mark, the favored response being, "The 
British Empire would be more united and strong."

Item ( e) asks, in which part of Canada are British

Empire ties strongest. Eight "B M and seventeen "C” 
students did not attempt an answer, and forty-six "B" 
and forty-seven ”C" students received no marks for 
answers submitted. Of those students able to answer 
correctly, the majority in both groups received only one 
out of a possible two marks. "Maritime Provinces" and 
"Ontario” were the ansv/ers most often given by members of 
both "B" and "C" groups. "C" group answers were similar to 
and, in the main, as good as "B" group answers. This item 
showed a discrimination of approximately seven per cent, 
which showed that relatively "C" students were good on this 
item. 

Item (g2) is concerned with the difficulty which 
might arise out of acceptance of the Halifax proposal due 
to Canada’s proximity to United States. "C " group achievement 
was about average, while "B” group achievement was below 
average on Item (g2). Discrimination achieved was approximately 
ten percent. Seventy-nine "B" and ninety-three "C" students 
received no marks, but more "B" students attempted ansv/ers

which were entirely wrong than did "C" students. M C H 
group correct answers were less varied than were "B" group 
correct answers. Wrong answers "by both groups indicated 
poor ability in interpreting the question and applying 
information given to the problem proposed. The striking 
feature here, perhaps, is the fact that fewer "C" group 
students could attempt to apply the inference in the question 
to the probDem.

Items (f), (gl), (g4), and (h) are those items on

of achievement on Question 11. 

Item (f) asked for an explanation of Canada* s "no 
commitments" policy. Although this item was not well 
answered the "C" group showed less ability to answer than 
did the "B" group, discrimination achieved being about 
17.5 percent. Forty-seven "C" and twenty-seven "B" 
students could not attempt an answer. Of those who did

complete an<3 m©re specific answers by those M B n students 
able to answer correctly, accounted for their superiority 
over "C M students in marks achieved. Certain discrepancies 
in marking v;ere here noted. An example of an answer not 
considered exact enough to warrant full marks is, 'Canada 
will not commit herself to any treaties". This particular 
response was allowed no marks in the majority of instances, 
but received one mark in others. The above answer is 
more typically "C M group than "B" group. The answer, 

"A policy of meeting situations as they arise," is more 
typically "B” group, and appears on relatively few 'C M 
group papers. "C" group show relatively less ability than 
”B M group students in interpretation. 

Item (gl) is concerned with the difficulty of 
acceptance of the Halifax proposal because of Canada’s 
geographical isolation. Discrimination achieved here is 
about 25 percent. One hundred two "B" and one hundred 
twenty-three ”C M students received no marks. This resulted 
chiefly from poor attempts to answer rather than from 
inability to answer, although forty-two "C " students did 
not attempt any response. More than half the students of

■both "B" end "C " groups misinterpreted the question entirely 
in its relation to the problem proposed. Answers like 
"Canada might be attacked by other countries" appeared on 
the answer papers. Relatively, the "B" group responses 
indicated their superiority in interpretation and in 
reasoning from this interpretation. 

Item (g4) concerns the relation between the Halifax 
proposals and Canada’s need for foreign marks. Discrimination 
achieved by this item was approximately 16 percent, 
achievement by both groups being below their averages on the 
entire question. Twenty "B" and forty-five "C" students 
were not able to answer and approximately seventy of each 
group gave responses worth no marks. Host favored correct 
answer was "Canada might have to forfeit some foreign 
markets", followed by "Canada is not self-sufficient". 

Wrong answers were about equally distributed between the 
groups, the discrimination in achievement seeming, again, 
to be a function of ability to answer at all, rather than 
of type of answer given. 

Item (h) asked for reasons for rejection of the 
Halifax proposal in Canada. Nineteen "B" and thirty-eight

"B" group correct answers show more variety than do 
"C” group answers. The favorite "C” group answer, also 
appearing on many "B" papers was, ''Canada likes to be

CATEGORY 2 

Both the questions which are included in Category 2 
are in Class (a). These are the questions of the Social 
Studies Test which achieved approximately average 
discrimination. Further, the average achievement of "both 
”B” and ,! C •’ groups on these two questions was Better than 
their average achievement on the entire paper. The question 
included in Category 2, Class (a) are Question 6 and 
Question 13. 

QUESTION 6 

Question 6 employs the ••matching” device to test 
ability to recognize the meanings of twelve terms commonly 
used in the discussion of social, political and economic 
problems. Association of the term and its definition are 
required. The Bar graphs on the following page indicate 
the achievements of the ”B" and "C'• groups on Question 6 
and compare this average achievement with the achievement 
of each group on the entire paper. The first "B" group 
graph shows a percentage achievement of 78.39 which, on

superiority of 24.32 percent over ”0" group average 
accomplishment on the entire paper. The discrimination

about the average discrimination achieved by the entire

the items in order as given on the test paper, with the 
numerals indicating the location of these correct answers 
in the column of definitions. Items (15) and (3) were

items are "excess profits tax" and "inflation". Item (5),

little discrimination. Item (16), "Cartel", proved 
to “be the most difficult item for "both groups and 
achieved a discrimination which v?as relatively low, 

Greatest discrimination was achieved hy Items (10), 

"free ent eip>ri se" , (7), "economic nationalism", and (12) 
"subsidy". Items receiving the least frequency of correct 
response hy hoth groups were Items (4), "imperialism", 

( 1)), "nationalism", and (16), "cartel". The general 
conformity of curves shows that terms or definitions not 
well known to one group were not well known to the other, 
and, conversely, terms well known to one group were well 
known to the other. 

The final graph in connection with Question 6 is 
placed on the next page and shows the frequency of items 
not attempted . The relatively high frequency over Item (36) 
"cartel", indicates again the difficulty of this item. 

Aside from those not attempting the item, seventy "B" and 
seventy-nine "C" students attempted an answer which was 
incorrect. Of these forty-five "B" and forty "C" students 
used Item (11), ”a policy of limiting the franchise to men" 
as an answer. Other answers varied, particularly in the "C"

group, which would indicate either a greater tendency to 


“guess” or a relatively less certain ability to associate 
other definitions with the correct terms. The graph 
further indicates 'the general tendency of students to make 
some response to most items. Compare, for example^the 
answers to Item 4, "A policy of territorial expansion, by 
f oix3e if necessary". The graph indicates that only two 
”B” and four "C " students did not attempt this item, and 
yet sixty-five "S" and eighty-two 'C" students received 
no marks for answers given. 

GENERAL STATEMENT, QUESTION 6 

1. Results would indicate that students of both 
groups find association of definitions and terms less 
difficult than recall of specific detail. This might not 
have been the case if both the term and its definition had 
not been given. 

2. The term "cartel” and its definition are least 
"well known" of any on the list. Perhaps this concept is 
difficult to teach or is not well known generally. 

3. Questions of the "matching" type encourage a 
considerable amount of "guessing". However, "B" group

responses show more consistency then do U C H group responses. 

4. Fair discrimination w j as achieved and "B n group 
students show a greater general ability to associate the 
terms and definitions given. The superiority of M B n group 
achievement over "C H group achievement is the result of 
their greater ability to answer items not too well known 


and not too obscure

QUESTION 13 

The purpose of Question 13 was, evidently, to test 
the knowledge of the students in “post-war planning" in 
Canada, in Alberta, end in the local community. Total 
marks allowed v/ere 10, Item (a) being valued at 4 marks, 
and Item (b) at 6 marks. The graphs on the following page 
indicate the success of both groups in answering 
Question 13. The range of scores for both groups is 
from 0 to 10, eleven "B" and seven "C" students receiving 
full marks. In each case the mode is above the mean in 
the scale of scores, and the "B" group scores show a 

relatively greater frequency over the upper half of the 

of 

scale/[scores. 

The bar graphs on the lower half of the page 
indicate percentage achievement on Question 13 and compare 
the percentage accomplishment of each group with the 
achievement of that group on the entire paper. The average 
percentage "B M score of 65.03 and "C" score of 56.47 
indicate that the question was relatively “easy" for both 
groups, although an approximately average amount of

discrimination was achieved, as is indicated by the 
percentage "area of discrepancy" of 8.56. This type of 
question, requiring a more general knowledge and items 
of relatively "local" import appears to he within the 
range of ability possessed by both groups of students 
here studied. 

ANALYSIS OB' ITEMS, QUESTION 13 

Item (a) asks the student to state briefly what he 
considers to be two broad underlying purposes of any post¬ 
war reconstruction programme for Canada. Two marks were 
allowed for each "purpose" stated. The graph, on the 
following page, comparing the percentage achievement of the 
"B" and. "C" groups on the items of Question 13 will serve 
to indicate that Item (al) proved to be "easiest", that is, 
a great majority, (76.5$) of students of both groups 
could state one "purpose". Item (a2) achieved a 
discrimination of 10.5 percent between "B" aid "C" group 
students, indicating again that "B" students possess a 
broader basic understanding of the larger problems of 
the times. The favored answers by both groups were:

Item (b) of Question 13 asks, "With particular 
reference to your own community and province describe in 
a paragraph the proposals that have been made for post-war 
reconstruction projects." The graph indicates that 
"B” group answers displayed as broadly based a knowledge 
of local "post-war planning" as did the answers of the "B" 
group and yet, taken individually, the "B" group ansv^ers 
were more complete and definite. A table of scores will

IS 


It will be observed that there is relatively little 
difference in the number of students receiving no marks 
but the greatest frequencies of "B" scores occur in the 
upper range of marks, from 4 to 6, while the greatest 
frequencies of "C " scores occur in the range of marks from 
2 to 4, This indicates a superiority on the part of the 
"B" group in setting down more specific items in their 
answers to Item (b), which would indicate, individually, 
a broader basic knowledge of "post-war problems". 

GENERAL STATEMENT, QUESTION 13 

1. The question was "below average in difficulty for 
both groups. 

2. Discrimination was achieved showing that the type 
of knowledge called for was possessed in greater amount 

by the "B" students.

CATEGORY 3

CATEGORY 3 

Included in Category 3 are four questions, three of 
them in Class (a) and one in Class (h) . Questions 5, 8, 
end 14 are included in Class (a) which means that the 
achievement erf hoth groups was above average on these 
questions. Question 4 comes under the heading, Class (h) , 
which implies that achievement of both groups was below 
average on this question. The fact that all four questions 
are included in Category 3 indicates that the amount of 
discrimination achieved by each was less than the average 
discrimination achieved by the entire paper. Questions 4 
and 5 tested ability to draw and interpret graphs. For the 
purpose of comparison these two questions will be discussed 
successively on the following pages. 

QUESTION 5 

Question 5 inc 3ud.es a bar type graph indicating 
production of petroleum in four leading countries and also 
a series of eight items involving interpretation of the 
graph presented. A ninth item asks that certain facts 
relating to oil production, the figures for which are given, 
be indicated on the graph. All items were valued at one

mark each, save Item (9) which was valued at two marks. 
Question 5 proved to he the "easiest 11 question on the 
paper for both groups and almost no discrimination was 
achieved. The graphs included here indicate the relative 
simplicity of the question. The "B H and "C" curves of 
the upper graph approximate the "J" curve, with the 
greatest frequency of scores by both groups occurring over 
the upper limits of the range of possible scores. No 
student of either group achieved less than 6 out of the 
possible 10 marks. 

The bar graphs occupying the lower half of the pafee 
of graphs indicate the relative achievements of the ,, B M 
and "C" groups. The "B" group bar graph indicates a 
percentage achievement of 94.3 which, as is shov/n by the 
area in black, is 39.88 percent above the average of 
achievement of this group on the entire paper. The "C" 
group graph indicates an achievement of 92.97 percent, 
which, as is shown in red, is 47.4 percent above the average 
of achievement of this group on the entire paper. The"area 
of discrepancy" of 1.33 percent, indicates that this type 
of question is about as "easy" for "C" as for "B" group 


students.

A study of the items disclosed the fact that 
percentage score on all items except Items ( 3 ) and (5) 
was above ninety for both groups. Item (3) asked for the 
naming of the country that showed the most consistent 
decrease in production. Seventeen "B M and twenty-five 
"C " students misinterpreted the question. Item (5) 
required the naming of the country that showed the least 
fluctuation in production. Twenty "B M and twenty-six 
"C” students appeared to misinterpret this question. One 
might conclude that both groups displayed good ability 
in interpreting graphs of this type and. that where an item 
proved difficult for "C" students it also proved difficult 
for "B“ students, that is, if any item may be said to have 
proved difficult. 

QUESTION 4 

The second of these "graph " questions to be here 
studied is Question 4. This question included a graph and 
two items. A graph indicating the rise of cost of living 
during Wo rid War I was reproduced on the test paper.

A second, graph was prepared and reproduced on the test 
papers. Item (a) asked for the completion of this 
second graph to indicate the rise in the cost of living 
during World War 2. The first page of graphs which 
follows indicates the achievement of n B H end "C H groups 
on Item (a) . The letter (N) on the X-axis indicates 
that a small number of students in both groups could not 
attempt an answer. As is indicated by the sharp rise of 
the curves over 0 marks, eighty-six "B" and ninety-five 
B C M students attempted answers which v/ere incorrect. 

These were answers which did not show the effect of the 
imposition of the "price ceiling". One mark was allowed 
if the graph rose from 100 to approximately 115 from 
1939 to 1941. A second mark was allowed if the graph rose 
slowly from 1941 to 1944 from 115 to approximately 118. 

Some students showed a too sharp rise in the first 
instance end so lost both marks. Others, who received one 
mark, continued the gradual rise, missing the implication 
of the effect of the imposition of the "price ceiling".

graphs included with this discussion of Item (a) indicate

percentage^achievement as compared with achievement on the 
entire paper. The item was obviously difficult for both 
groups? ,, B H group achievement being 28.5 percent and n C n 
group achievement being 22.83 percent. Discrimination 
was better than on Question 5. This question involved 
recall and perhaps a certain reasoning ability and/ as 
has proved to be generally the case? these factors 
tend to result in lower achievement by both groups. It 
seems that the greater discrimination achieved by Question 
4 (a) than by Question 5 is likely to have been caused by 
the fact that "B 11 students do show some superiority over 
U G n students in the two types of mental ability mentioned 
above•

shows relative achievement on Item (b). This item 
required the placing of an arrow at a point on the date¬

the price ceiling came into effect, as the graphs indicate 
both groups showed better ability to answer Item (b) than

responses which were worthless. The majority of students 
who received a mark at all received full marks for Item (b). 
The bar graphs indicate that achievement on Item (b) was 
better than the average achievement on the entire paper. 
Discrimination was 6.5 percent, slightly in excess of that 
achieved by the more difficult Item (a). 

“B H group achievement on Question 4 taken as a whole, 
v/as 43 percent while "C H groujj average achievement was 
36.91 percent, which would indicate that though the 
question was "hard” for both groups, it was relatively 
"harder" for M C n than for "B” students. 

GENERAL STATEMENT, QUESTIONS 4 AND 5 

1. Question 5, where no recall of specific details 
was required proved to be "easy" for both groups. 

2. Little discrimination is achieved by this type 
of question. 

3. Question 4 proved more difficult for both 
groups because of the recall of detail which was required. 

4. Greater discrimination between the groups is 
achieved by this type of question, than by the type 
represented by Question 5.

QUESTION 14 

Five items are included in Question 14, each of 
which is concerned with some problem dealing with the 
probable post-v/ar situation in Europe. Students are asked 
to choose one of three proposed answers to each item as 
an expression of their opinion as to the most reasonable 
solution to the problem proposed. One answer to each 
problem, is, apparently, considered to be reasonable, the 
other two of each group being such as to be deemed 
unreasonable. The graphs on the following page indicate the 
degree of success achieved by the "B” and "C" groups studied. 
The frequency polygons show that the greater number of 
students in both groups could choose correctly the statements, 
which, in the opinion of the examiners, contained the 
solution to each problem. Eifty-five '’B” and twenty-ei ght 
"0“ students received full marks for the question. The 
mode for the '€ 11 group is at 8 marks. Since 10 marks were 
allowed: for Question 14, this serves to indicate that the 
Question proved to be relatively "easy". The "B” group mean 
is at 7.93 or 7 9.3 percent of possible marks. The 'C M 
mean is at 7 .36 or 73 ,6yJof possible maiks.

The bar graphs on the lo?;er half of the page of

the accomplishment of both groups was hi#i on this question 
as compared with their average percentage achievement on the 
entire paper. "B H group achievement on Question 14 was 
24.91 percent above the percentage achievement of this group 
on the entire paper. "C" group achievement was 28.09 percent 
above the average percentage achievement of "C " students.on

5 .7 which indicates that a lower than normal discrimination

the "C" group found this question relatively more "easy"

and the majority of students in 'both groups were able to 
answer correctly. This item dealt with the occupation 
of Germany following cessation of hostilities. Wrong 
answers were fairly evenly distributed between parts (a) 
and (c) of this item. As is indicated by the graph, "C" 
students were more successful in answering Item (2) than 
were "B" students. Most frequently given incorrect 
answer was part (a), ’’German military forces under new 
leaders should carry on until a democratic German 
government can be elected. Seventeen ”B” students were 
apparently misled here, possibly by the inclusion of the 
words "democratic German government", which did not 
appear in the other choices. Item (3) was well answered 
by both groups, as is apparent from the graph. This item 
deals with food and relief problems during the period 
of transition from military to civilian administration. 

Item (4) was answered correctly by ninety-three 
"C" and one hundred thirteen "B” students, achieving 
good discrimination betv; een the two groups. This item 
is concerned with the type of government to be permitted

In Germany at the close of the war. The three choices 
here are ( a) democracy, (b) any government which is not 
totalitarian and which suits the German people, (c) any 
form of government, totalitarian or democratic. 

Thirty-four "B” and fifty-two ”C” students chose part 
(a) which was considered wrong. One ”B” and thirty-three 
"C M students chose part (c), which was also considered to 
be wrong. 

Item (5) proved to be more difficult than any other 
item included in Question 14, and yet more than half the 
students of each group were able to answer correctly. 

Item (5) achieved relatively good discrimination between 
the "B” and ”C” groups. The problem concerned the 
post-war status of the smaller European nations subjugated 
by Germany. The proposals were, (a) "Sh culd be encouraged 
to form federated groups”, (b) ‘'Should be cbliged to 
amalgamate into one or more larger states or to unite with 
a great power”, (c) "Should be given complete sovereignty 
in all matters, i ncluding the right to make war or 
conclude peace”. Choice (a) was considered correct. 

Sixteen ”B" and thirty-four "C" students elected choice (b)

while thirty-nine "3" and thirty-four "C" students elected 
choice (c) . One U C" student did not attempt Item (5), this 
being the sole instance in Question 14 of a student not 
attempting an item. It is my belief that the opinion 
expressed by students choosing part (c) was probably based 
on a judgement formed on the first half of the statement. 

GENERAL STATEMENT, QUESTION 14 

/ 

The purpose of Question 14 appears to be to ascertain 
the understanding of immediate post-war plans possessed by 
the student. Further, perhaps, the question attempts to 
measure right opinion as that underlies the choices made. 
Here the term, right opinion, refers to the opinions which 
would seem to reveal an understanding of our basic "peace 
ideals" as expressed in such documents as the "Atlantic 
Charter". 

1. Both groups of students possessed the knowledge, 
understanding, or "attitude" required to answer Question 14. 
The term-"attitude" is employed here since, because of 
the form of answer required, "right" attitude might prompt 
correct atiswers just as well as might understanding. 














- 138 - 


2. The result achieved in Items (2), (4), and (5) 
might suggest that students are in many cases answering 
from "cues" and not from complete interpretation of the 
choices allowed. 

3. When specific knowledge of detail is not 
required and when specific statements of facts are not 
necessary, both ”B H and H C n group achievement is likely 
to he above average. 

4. In questions of this type it would appear that 
the more difficult items achieve greater discrimination, 
with "B" group students showing superiority in answering 
items of this kind. 











139 


QUESTION 8 

Because of its influence on the English mark and 
Because of certain peculiarities in connection with the 
results, discussion of Question 8 has Been left until the 
last. The question involved the writing of an essay 
of 150 words on any one of the five topics listed Below. 

1. The significance of the Atlantic Charter for 
the World after the War. 

2. A Social Security Plan. 

3. Civil Aviation in Canada. 

4. Canadian Immigration. 

5. Women’s Branches of Armed Services. 

A total of 20 marks was allowed for Question 8, the 
marking Being as objective as possiBle, with a system of 
extra marks for expansion of details mentioned in the 
essays. As the list would indicate, a fairly wide choice 
of topics was available, the object Being not only to 
test the knowledge of the students on the topics listed, 
But also to discover their ability in English.

achievement of the ”B” and "C” groups on the Social 
Studies material contained in the answers. The frequency 
of scores for hoth groups ’’piles up” ever the central 
portion of the range of score.s. The ”B” group mean is 
12 marks, or 60 percent of possible marks, and the 
”C” group mean is 11.23, or 56.15 percent of possible 
marks. Both these averages indicate that achievement was 
relatively high on the question. The bar graphs on the 
lower half of the page compare the scores achieved by 
both groups on Question 8 and on the entire paper. It will 
be observed that ”B” group average achievement is only 
5.58 percent above the average achievement of this group 
on the entire paper. ”C” group achievement, on the other 
hand, is 10.58 percent above the average achievement of this 
group on the entire paper. The figures above will serve to 
explain the relatively small ’’area of discrepancy”, 3.85 
percent, and will also indicate that "C” group students 
found Question 8 pr qportionately more ’’easy” than did 
the ”B” group students. 




- 142 - 


ANALYSIS OF ITEMS, QUESTION 8 

Since each student was required to write on only 
one topic, the type of student attempting each item 
has had some effect on the comparative results. The 
first graph on the following page will indicate that 
"C" students who wrote on Topics (2) and (4) secured 
higher marks than did the "B w students who selected 
these two topics. The actual and percentage average 
scores have been listed in the table at the foot of the 
page of graphs. The greatest discrimination was 
achieved by Topics (1) and (3), while fair discrimination 
was achieved by Topic 5. The second graph, on the right 
hand side of the page of graphs,shows the relative 
"popularity 11 of the topics. Topdcs (1) and (5) were 
selected by relatively few students in either group. 

Topic (4) was most often selected loy members of both 
groups, but was especially favoured by "C" students. This 
is the topic "Canadian Immigration". 

Item (1) was attempted by students who proved to 
be about average in the "C" group and slightly above 
average in the "B" group. Both the "B" and "C"

students selecting Topic (2) proved to be "above average” 
students in their own groups. The average percentage 
achievement on the entire paper of those "B” students 
selecting Topic (3) was 60.35 which would indicate that 
they are a select group, since this average is above the 
average percentage achievement (54.42) of the ”B” group 
on the entire paper. The ”0” group which selected 
Topic (3) proved to be about average. This perhaps 
explains the great discrepancy in average marks received 
for answers to Topic (3). The "B" students attempting 
Topic (4) were a below average "B” group, and the "C” 
students selecting this topic were slightly above 
average as a group, which perhaps explains, in part at least, 
the fact that ”C ” group achievement was better than “B” 
group achievement on Topic (4). 

A reading of the answer papers has shown that the 
Social Security Plan selected under Topic (2) was most 
often the Beveridge Plan. The topic appeared to have been 
"learned” as was indicated by the completeness and 
uniformity of the answers of both groups. If anything, 
t&e "C” group essays indicated a more detailed knowledge. 











3 : ;:

of the Plan, which might perhaps indicate "cramming”. 

Answers to Topic (4), "Canadian Immigration", also 
revealed a fairly good knowledge of the advantages of 
immigration. Criticism of the Social Security Plans 
was almost non-existent and discussion of disadvantages 
and problems likely to arise out of immigration was 
weak. The above statements apply almost as much to the 
"B" as to the "C" group. 

The "B" group writing on Topic (5), "Civil Aviation 
in Canada", showed superiority in detailed knowledge of 
pre-war conditions and showed, in general, a better 
understanding of the possibilities and problems of post¬ 
war aviation. "B" group essays on Topic (5) were quite 
' definitely superior to "C" essays in content and 
expression. 

Topic (5), "Women’s Branches of Armed Services", was 
selected by a group of "C M students whose average percentage 
achievement on the entire paper was 49.6. This topic was 
selected by a group of "B" students whose average percentage 
achievement on the entire paper was 50.43. The relatively 
uniform ability in Social Studies achievement possibly 








- 146 


accounts for the low discrimination. Possibly what 
discrimination was achieved could he accounted for on 
the basis of English ability, since below average ”B n 
students had relatively high English ability and high 
"C” students had a relatively low English score. This 
negative correlation between English ability and Social 
Studies achievement, for the groups studied , was 
mentioned earlier. 

GENERAL STATEMENT, QUESTION 8 

1. The fact that a wide choice of topic was 
allowed possibly accounts for the relatively high 
achievement of both "B n and M C 11 groups in answers to 
Question 8. 

2 . "C” group students, on the average, were almost 
as successful as were "B” students in marks received for 
answers to Question 8. 

3. Criticism and discussion of the topics was 
weaker than ability to set down definite ”learned" 
information. 

4. A reading of the papers gives the impression tha t 
topic (3) was less likely to have been especially '’learned” 
for the test. "B” group essays on this topic were more 
complete and exact in detail. 









- 147 - 


5. Item (2), especially, seemed to have "been 
"memorized” by students from both groups and details of 

% 

the "Plans" seemedi to be well known to the students who 
wrote on this topic. 

6 . The topic, "Canadian Immigration", contained a 
relatively good discussion of the problem with fairly 
varied detail. 

7. Students of both groups seemed to be able to 
write on these topics but were not particularly good at 
suggesting or criticizing the possibilities of 
application of the details suggested. The essays on 
"Canadian Immigration" and "B" group essays on "Civil 
Aviation" contained some of the better discussions of 
this type. Where details could be "learned" the 
constructive thinking appeared to suffer. 







- 148 - 


THE ENGLISH MARKS 

As was mentioned earlier, the correlation between 
English ability and Social Studies achievement exhibits 
a negative trend . This must necessarily be so because 
of the effect which marks for English ability play in the 
estimation of the final score for this test paper. The 
English mark, derived from a study of the essays written 
on the topics included in Question 8, was set at a total 
value of 20. However, since the total mark for Social 
Studies material was divided by two before the English 
score was added, English ability in many cases proved 
decisive as to grouping* This fact was brought out in the 
first of the series of graphs included in this thesis. The 
method of arriving at the final score is illustrated 
below* 

173 + 20 • Final score.

173 is the total marks on Social Studies material and 20 
is the total possible English score. From the above, the 
total possible Social Studies score is 86.5 while the' 
highest final score would be 86.5 + 20 or 106.5. The 
English mark comprises, therefore, approximately 18.8 









. . 










149 


percent of the final score. 

In order, then to discover the correlation between 
English and Social Studies information the best plan has 
seemed to be to compare these on the basis of Question 8 
alone. This method is faulty, perhaps, but it should 
demonstrate whether the ability to set down information, 

* t 

and good English ability are correlated, without inter¬ 
ference from the effect of the English mark on total 
score, and without the interference which the English 
score played in the grouping. The average English score 
for the "B” group is 12.06 or 60.3 percent of possible 
marks. For the ,, C n group the average English score is 
11.34 or 56.7 percent. Both groups achieved better marks 
in English than on Social Studies material and the 
discrimination achieved by the English nark was less than 
that achieved by Social Studies material contained in the 
entire paper . 

On the following pages two correlation tables are 
presented. The H C 11 group table shows a definite absence 
of correlation, from observation alone. The "B" group 
table showed some slight possibility of trend. However,

this did not p rove to he the case, the Coefficient of 
Correlation proving to he - .0113. The assumption, here, 
would he that English ability did not influence Social 
Studies ability on the essays written in answer to 
Question 8. This of course refers only to ability to 
write English. 







PART E 


(a) Summary and Conclusions, 
("b) Suggestion.

SUIffllARY AED CQHCIUSIONS 

The analysis of answers to the Social Studies test 
suggests perhaps first tfcrat "B" group students show a 
definite superiority in recall of specific detail. It is 
this ability which explains the achievement of f, B M students 
on those questions of Category 1 which require a knowledge 
of place-names, locations, names of prominent persons, and 
knowledge of historical detail. The importance of this 
type of mental ability can hardly be overestimated, since it 
is from detailed knowledge that generalizations are made, 
conclusions are drawn, and well-founded opinions may be 
derived. Further, the type of question demanding this 
ability has, in the case of Category 1 questions at least, 
demanded a more or less "absolute” power of recall, since 
11 cues” were not given as they are in more objective questions 
such as the "matching” type. 

A second type of mental ability demanded is knowledge 
of a more general type. Possession of this type of 
knowledge, whether of the recognition type or absolute recall 
appears, from an estimate of relative achievements, to be one 
of the reasons for ”B” 


group success.

A third, type of mental ability, demonstrated perhaps 
best by the answers to Question 11, is that required to 
interpret a statement, and to apply the inference suggested 
by the statement to particular situations. This type of 
mental ability, it seems to me, is of particular value and 
Question 11, to my mind, is one of the best questions on 
the entire paper. This type of ability, required by 
Question 11, appears to be possessed in greater measure by 
”B M group than by M C M group students. 

The two questions appearing under C at ego ry 2 were 
such that students of both the "B" and "C " groups achieved 
better than average marks. Question 6 required the 
students to match definitions and terms. The results show 
"B" group superiority in "recognition” of this sort. 

Question 13 on post-war reconstruction, was relatively well 
answered by both groups but "B" group ability was expressed 
in greater completeness of answers, particularly with 
regard to the aims of post-war planning. Possibly this is 
the result, not only of knowledge of specific facts, but 
also of superior ability to generalize from those facts. 

Listed under Category 3 were Questions 5, S, 14, and 4.

Achievement of “both groups was above average in answering 
the first three questions of this group, which indicates 
ability in graph reading, ability to write on a general 
topic of current interest, and a general knowledge or 
"attitude” as to the application of democratic ideals in 
relation to the immediate post-war situation in Europe. 

In the analysis of Question 8, it was noted that general 
discussion and criticism were the weakest parts of the 
essays. Pacts were "learned" as facts and few conclusions 
were drawn from them. Where attempts to do so 7/ere made 
the results we re vague and inadequate. Ansv/ers to 
Question 14 indicated to some extent, perhaps particularly 
with the "B" group, a tendency to form judgments from "cues", 
Question 4 repaired a knowledge of certain specific details, 
the result being lower average achievement by both groups 
than on the other questions included in this Category. A 
second result was an increase in discrimination between the 
groups. 

It would appear that "B" group average superiority may 
be accounted for on the basis of their relatively greater 
capacity in the abilities listed on the next page.

1. Recall of specific detail. 

(Example, question 2 - Discrimination, 20.15%) 

2. Recall of general knowledge and trends. 

(Example, question 7 - Discrimination, 12.95$) 

3. Ability to generalize from known facts. 

(Example, question 11 (h) - Discrimination 13.5$) 

4. Ability to apply generalization to particular 

situations. 

(Example, question 11 (g) - Discrimination 17*96$) 

5. Ability in recognition. 

(Example, question 12 - Discrimination, 13.74$) 

The application of these abilities by "B" group 
students to the items on the test resulted in more complete 
answers where detailed or general knowledge was required, 
more valuable answers where generalization or reasoning 
from facts was demanded, and greater success where 
recognition was asked for. 

In the following types of question there is little 
di sc riminat i on . 

1. questions requiring reading of graphs. 

(Example, question 5 - Discrimination 1.33$) 

2. Essay questions permitting a wide choice of

3. Items of relatively great difficulty. 

(Example, Question 6, Item 16). 

4. Questions or items of greater than average 
simplicity. 

(Example, Question 5) . 

That these exhibited proficiencies of n B M students 
are relative must he remembered. Where recall of specific 
facts or details is. required, it has been noted that the 
achievement of both groups is low . Where ability to 
generalize or to apply generalizations is required, the 
achievement of both groups is also low . The acquisition 
of skills such as that required for the writing of an 
essay or for graph reading, appears to be a more simple 
matter for the students of both groups. 

The findings of the study, too, would seem to 
indicate the following points. 

1. General knowledge of historical detail increases 
with proximity in time . 

2. Knowledge of Canadian history appear^ to be poor. 

3 . Where the student is not required to write out 

his statements or ideas, greater success is achieved. 

4. Graph reading is "easy” provided no recall of 


detail is necessary.

A SUGGESTION. 

Perhaps the impressions which have been left with me 
are due to the sampling for this particular work, and might 
not he home out in a study of higher category students, hut 
it does seem that these students completing the Grade 12 
Social Studies course possess a rather superficial knowledge 
of current problems and factual detail. The result is a 
certain glihness hut an apparent difficulty in getting 
"down to brass tacks”. It would seem to me that there are 
certain basic concepts in connection with political and 
economic questions which should he knorwn and which students 
at the Grade 12 level should he able to apply. It is 
perhaps for this reason that I was particularly impressed 
with Question 11. The particular ability required to 
successfully answer such a question is that vhich, it seems 
to me, is moat likely to he called for in actual life 
situations. Further, I do believe that this ability can he 
"taught”, that is, that students can learn to apply 
generalized know ledge to particular situations.
