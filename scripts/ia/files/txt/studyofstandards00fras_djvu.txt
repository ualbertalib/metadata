INTRODUCTION 


During the better part of a century that it has been estab¬ 
lished the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Force has acquired an 
enviable reputation among law enforcement agencies throughout 
the world. To help maintain the high standard of efficiency 
typical of their organization the R.C.M.P. exercise great care 
in selecting recruits from among the thousands of young men who 
yearly apply for engagement with the Force. 

It is the responsibility of the R.C.M.P. Personnel Depart¬ 
ment to ensure not only that a sufficient number of recruits is 
engaged each year but also that only those men are selected who 
have personal qualities that will enable them to develop into com¬ 
petent members of the R.C.M. Police Force. 

The selection procedure at present in use in the R.C.M.P. 
can be divided into two stages - the preliminary screening process 
and the personal interview. When the applicant first approaches 
the Force for engagement it is determined by the preliminary 
screening process whether he fulfils certain requirements in re¬ 
gard to citizenship, marital status, education, medical fitness 
and body build.^ These standards are specific and definite and 
there can be little uncertainty as to whether the applicant con¬ 
forms to them. 

Having met the above standards, and having had his background 
and character thoroughly checked, the applicant is administered 
the R.C.M.P. Psychometric Test, which is a device for estimating 

the mental capacity of the applicant. He is then personally 
interviewed by the Divisional Personnel Officer, who uses as a 
guide the applicants score on the R.C.M.P. Psychometric Test. 

# The actual requirements in regard to these items are given in 
the last page of the introductory section.

During the course of the interview, which lasts about an hour and 
a half, the Divisional Personnel Officer (hereafter D.P.O.) de¬ 
cides whether or not the applicant meets certain standards in re¬ 
gard to personal qualities and personality characteristics. 

There are certain qualities and characteristics that success¬ 
ful R.C.M. Policemen "must almost inevitably have in common”/ 1 ^ 
These characteristics comprise the standards of selection in the 
second stage of the screening process (i.e. the personal inter¬ 
view). The desired qualities are:- good citizenship; proper 
motivation for applying; interests that indicate energy of chara¬ 
cter, independence of mind, self-reliance, and an acceptance of 
physical or mental challenge; common-sense; loyalty; sympathy, 
tact and understanding; self-respect, neat and tidy appearance; 
self-control; confidence; endurance and persistance; initiative; 
leadership; versatility; aggressiveness (but not too much).^ 

The D.P.O. scarcely expects to find all these qualities in 
one applicant but these are the standards he uses as guides when 
after the interview he makes his decision and recommends the ap¬ 
plicant T s rejection or his acceptance into the Force. 

The D.P.O.*s task is a difficult one. The standards he has 
to guide him in his selection are neither specific nor tangible. 
Using the knowledge he has acquired on a special training course^ 
in conjunction with the knowledge he has gained through experience 
in the Force, he must judge whether or not the applicant possesses 
sufficient of the above qualities to be considered a potentially 
competent R.C.M. Policeman. 

In any organization wherein the interview technique is used 

# D.P.O.»s are relatively young commissioned R.C.M. Policemen who 
have had at least 10 years service in the Force. On appointment 
to the post of D.P.O. they receive a short T Man-Management* 
course which includes a study of elementary psychology and the 
theory of interviewing.

as the sole method of selecting applicants, the efficiency of 
selection depends upon the skill and accuracy with which the 
interviewer can (1) determine the personal attributes common 
among those successfully engaged in a particular occupation; 

[2) estimate, during the course of the interview, the similarity 
of the personal attributes of the applicant to those of men suc¬ 
cessfully engaged in the occupation in question. 

Skilled and effective interviewing is a task at which some 
men are more apt than others but at which few become expert 
without special training and a good deal of conscientious effort 
and practical experience. Many large organizations in an effort 
to make the interviewer’s task less difficult and at the same 

time productive of more satisfactory results, have adopted the 

( 2 ) 

use of psychometric tests' . These tests, by supplying infor¬ 
mation about the applicant’s mental capacity, personality chara¬ 
cteristics, interests, and special abilities, enable the inter¬ 
viewer to assess more easily and accurately the suitability of 
the applicant for the job in question. 

Purpose of the Investigation. 

The aim of this investigation is to 
study the standards and methods of selection at present being used 
by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Force and to determine there¬ 
by any way or ways in which these standards could be modified or 
complemented to increase their effectiveness. 

Tools of the Investigation 
1. The Data Sheet. $

test group by the staff of the R.C.M.P. Personnel Department, 
contained information in regard to/various aspects of the mem¬ 
ber's background, training and ability. 

It is our intention to analyze the data thus supplied in an 
effort to determiner 

(1) the efficacy of certain of the standards of 

selection (connected with the preliminary screening 

# 

process) now being used by the Force. 

(2) if there are any indications of ways in which 
present standards of selection could be modified or 
complemented to make them more effective. 

2. The Strong Vocational Interest Blank 

It was decided to use 

this psychometric test in an effort to determine whether there 
is a (vocational) interest pattern typical of R.C.M. Policemen 
and if so whether existing standards and methods of selection 
are discriminating effectively between applicants on the basis 
of that interest pattern. 

3. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 

It was de¬ 
cided to use this psychometric test in an effort to determine 
whether there are personality characteristics typical to S.C. 
M.Policemen and if so whether existing standards and methods 
of selection are discriminating effectively between applicants 
on a basis of those personality characteristics. 

The M.M.P.I. is basically a clinical instrument designed 
to be used as an aid in identifying individuals in need of 
psychiatric treatment. However, according to current 


it Those standards of selection pertaining to medical fitness 
and body build are not considered in this investigation.

psychological theory the functional disorders, that is, abnor¬ 
malities, are, in effect, extreme forms of tendencies present 
in all of us to varying degrees. Thus a psychometric device 
which is of value in identifying extreme deviants may be of value 
in identifying personality differences among groups of normal 
individuals such as comprise the R.C.M.P. 

jL-he rest Group 

By permission of the Commissioner and through the 
co-operation of the Officers Commanding^a general call for volun¬ 
teers to participate in this project was issued throughout R.C. 
m.P. divisions K and E. The members of these two divisions were 
assured that their answers to such tests and questionnaires as 
they might receive would be treated as confidential and would be 
kept in locked files; further ) they were given the Commissioner's 
assurance that R.C.M.P. personnel would have no access to these 
files. 

The response of the members was prompt and gratifying; 325 
volunteered to complete such test material as they might receive. 
This test group was composed of Officers, N.C.O.'s and Constables 
who varied widely as to age, length of service and place of birth. 
j.t was composed of members engaged in federal, Provincial, Muni¬ 
cipal and Northern service, of members from all sizes of detach¬ 
ments, of members engaged in various types of duties. The test 
group was therefore considered to be a fairly representative 
sample of members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Porce. 

lIandling_of Test^Material 1 

The test material was mailed to each 
member of the test group by the staff of the R.C.M.P. Personnel

department. A stamped, addressed envelope was included and when 
the member completed the enclosed material he mailed it directly 
to the Psychological Laboratory, University of Alberta. 

The criterion Groups. 

The Officer Commanding of each division, 
with the assistance of the Divisional Personnel Officer, divided 
the 325 volunteers into groups on the basis of their efficiency 
as members of the Force: these groups will be referred to as 
Criterion Groups I, II and III. Criterion Group I contains the 
most efficient members of the test group, Criterion Group III 
contains the least efficient members, and Criterion Group II is 
composed of those members who were assigned an efficiency rating 
midway between the most efficient and the least efficient - the 
mediocre members. Those who have served in the Force for less 
than five years and are > therefore 4 relatively new and inexperienced 
members, were not assigned an efficiency rating and were put in a 
separate group, Criterion Group IV. 

In the table below is given the composition by Division (K 
and 1) and criterion group of the test group.

REQUIREMENTS OF AN APPLICANT FOR ENGAGEMENT IN THE 
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE* 

l*he preliminary screening requires that an applicant must fulfil 
the following requirements: 

He must be a British subject resident in Canada, single, 
between 18 and 30 years of age; height not less than 5*8" 
in socks, weight not over 185 lbs* if he is 6*1" or under, 
not over 200 lbs. if he is over 6*1". Grade 8 education. 

If the applicant fulfils the above he is given an R.C.M.P. 
Medical Examination Form and advised to have this completed by his 
own doctor at his own expense, this being evidence that he is 
physically fit at the time of application. In the event that the 
medical examination is satisfactory, he is instructed to complete 
the Formal Application Form and is required to produce his Birth 
Certificate, proof of education and two letters of reference (not 
from relatives). Provided all documents are satisfactory, the 
Force T s Educational Test No. 1 is administered to the applicant. 
This test is considered to be at a grade 10 level. 

If the results of the Educational Test are satisfactory, the 
character background of the applicant is investigated. Should it 
come to light, either by his own admission or as a result of the 
character investigation, that the subject has been convicted of an 
offence, the application is rejected. The only exceptions gener- 
ally made in this connection are minor infractions of the Vehicle 
Traffic Act. A conviction under the Juvenile Delinquents Act is 
usually considered a delinquency and not an offence. 

A complete file together with fingerprints is submitted to 
Headquarters and thoroughly checked. Instructions are then for¬ 
warded to the local Divisional Personnel Officer with instructions

that the Psychometric Test is to be administered and a clinical 
interview carried out. 

The Psychometric Test is used as a guide by the Divisional 
Personnel Officer in conducting the clinical interview which fol¬ 
lows. 

The recommendations of the Personnel Officer are based upon 
a comprehensive study of the educational and occupational back¬ 
ground of the applicant, as well as the background of his family. 
The motivation is closely scrutinized, as are also such items as 
ability to absorb and apply instruction. Stability, initiative, 
tenacity, ability to carry out and follow up orders, physical fit¬ 
ness and physical ability to work long hours and endure hardships 
are all matters for consideration. 

The results of the Psychometric Test and clinical interview 
are forwarded to the Senior Personnel Officer, the complete file 
then being appraised and the successful applicant offered engage¬ 
ment. 

The applicant is required to sign an engagement contract for 
five years’ service. He is advised that the marriage regulations 
of the Force do not permit him to marry until he has completed at 
least five years’ service, is at least 26 years of age and has 
cash or convertible assets amounting to not less than $1200.00* 

The offer of engagement is subject to the applicant’s pro¬ 
ducing a vaccination and dental certificate, and also submitting 
to a final medical examination by a Medical Officer of the Force, 
which includes a chest X-ray and Wasserman Test.

THE DATA SHEET 


For each member of the test group a data sheet was filled 
out. This data sheet contained information on various as¬ 
pects of the individual's background, training and ability. 

Table A contains the composition by Division (K and E) 
and by Criterion Group of the data sheet test group.

It was our purpose to study and analyze the material 
supplied by the data sheet and thereby determine: 

(a) Whether or not (in regard to the various aspects of back¬ 
ground, training and ability covered by the data sheet) there 
were features or conditions more common among efficient than 
among relatively inefficient members of the Force, or vice 
versa. 

(b) Whether or not existing standards of selection are in 
accordance with or show cognizance of any such differences 
here determined. 

For the proposed study the material on the data sheet 
was divided into fifteen sections. These sections, each of 

# There were originally 327 volunteers. Subsequent to the 
beginning of work on this part of the investigation two 
volunteers withdrew.

The method used in the analysis of the data was the same 


for each section. The section was subdivided into a number 


of qualitatively or quantitatively different categories; the 
members of each criterion group separately were divided into 
these categories. The percentage of the criterion group that 
fell into each category was calculated. There was thus obtain¬ 
ed for each criterion group a percentage distribution according 
to category. A comparison was mad© of the percentage distribu¬ 
tions of the four groups and such conclusions drawn as were in¬ 
dicated by the differences shown. 

Not all the information required on the data sheet was 

Un¬ 
available oft each member of the test group. However in the 

majority of cases the sheets were completely filled in. For 
each section the number of cases in which the required informa¬ 
tion was not available is listed on the right hand end of the 
percentage distribution table for that section.

it was to be administered to all serving members below the 
rank of Staff Sergeant, as well as to all recruits. Since 
promotion in any organization will be awarded to the members 
who are most efficient, our Criterion Group I will contain a 
larger percentage of members above the rank of Staff Sergeant 
than will the other criterion groups. Consequently Group I 
has a larger percentage^than have the other groups^of members 
for whom there is no record of Psychometric Test Score (19 f 0 in 
Group I as against Q% in each of Groups II and III). 

The test scores of the members of each criterion group 
were tabulated under intervals of ten. Table I contains the 
resulting percentage distribution of test scores for each of 
the criterion groups.

(a) Criterion. Groups^I^ II A III. 


Table I shows that in each of 
Groups I, II and III the highest percentage of members is in 
the 60-69 bracket. Criterion Group I has a slightly higher 
percentage in this bracket than Group II and a considerably 
higher percentage than Group III. 

If 60-69 is considered the median bracket, then the per¬ 
centage distribution shows that the least efficient group has 
a lower percentage of its members in the median bracket and a 
higher total percentage in those brackets below the median. 

The mediocre and most efficient groups have approximately 
equal percentages below, and at, the median. All three groups

have approximately equal percentages above the median. 

This distribution indicates that the lowered efficiency level 
of some members of Group III is due, in part at least,to a lower 
level of mental ability. However, for those members of Group III 
whose scores equal or exceed the median, factors other than level 
of mental ability are responsible for their lowered efficiency level. 
The distribution further indicates that to only a very slight extent 
can the efficiency superiority of Group I to Group II be attributed 
to superior mental capacity. 

(b) Criterion Group IV. 

This group has its highest percentages in the 
60-69 and 70-79 brackets. (These percentages happen to be equal). 

It has a higher percentage of scores above the median (60-69) bra¬ 
cket and a lower percentage below that bracket than any of Groups 
I, II and III. 

It may be concluded from the above data that the use of the 
R.C.M.P. Psychometric Test does reduce, among applicants accepted 
by the Force, the number who will later prove tofce inefficient mem¬ 
bers due primarily to insufficient mental capacity. 

A comparison of the percentages in the 40-49 and 50-49 brack¬ 
ets indicates that present requirements in regard to psychometric 
test score are such that the number of recruits unsatisfactory in 
this respect is reduced, with a minimum wastage of applicants* 

Training Course Score 

Each applicant who is recruited into the Force receive^ a 
six-months formal training course. This course is divided into 
two parts, Part I and Part II; the recruits are examined at the end 

of each part and given a percentage standing. 

For each member the percentage standings in Part I and in Part 

II were averaged and this average was taken as his standing

Because of the large number of cases in Criterion Groups 
I, II and III in which there was no record of training course 
scores, it follows that resulting percentage distributions would 
not be reliable. Therefore no observations or conclusions are 
offered on the basis of the data presented in Table II. 

Educational Level 

The concern here was with the standard or level of formal 
education of the members of the test group. In summarizing 
the information on the data sheets those members whose formal 
education was below a Grade IX level were tabulated under one 
category. Of those who fell in the Below IX category, only 5 
had not attained Grade % standing. Those members who have at¬ 
tended a teacher training course were tabulated under the Uni¬ 
versity category. An additional column was added for tabulat¬ 
ing the number of members of each group who had taken addition¬ 
al educational training of some type after they had left school 
or university. 

Table III contains the percentage distribution for each 
criterion group in respect to level of formal education and

I. Formal Education 

(a) Criterion Groups I, II and III 

The percentage distribution 

in Table III shows that the bulk of members in each group falls 
in the Grade Ten to Grade Twelve range. In Groups I and II the 
highest percentage is in the Grade Eleven category with notice¬ 
ably lower percentages in the Grade Ten and Grade Twelve cate¬ 
gories. In Group III the highestfpereentage is under Grade Ten 
with an almost equally high percentage under Grade Twelve, 
while the percentage under Grade Eleven is noticeably lower. 

Groups I and II have almost equal percentages in the ’Below 
Grade Nine’^ category, both of which are much higher than the 
Group II percentage in this category. Group I has a consider¬ 
ably higher percentage of members with University education than 
has either of the other groups. Since there was discernible no 
consistent difference between the three groups in regard to for¬ 
mal education of a below-University level, further investigation 
of those members with University education was carried out. It 
was found that of the total number of members with University 
education 50 % were in Group II, 37-Jin Group I and 12-| f 0 in 

# Because of the very few (5 in all) members who have an educa¬ 
tion below a Grade 8 level, the ’Below Grade 9’ category could, 
for all practical considerations, be treated as a Grade 8 
category.

Group III.^ 

The percentage distribution in regard to educational 
level indicates that, other things being equal, the amount 
of formal education received (especially of Grade Twelve stan¬ 
dard or below) is not, on the whole, a significant factor in 
regard to degree of efficiency attained. ' rr There is, however, 
some indication that members with a formal education of Univer¬ 
sity standard tend to climb to the higher efficiency levels. 

The present policy of the R.C.M.P. in regard to education¬ 
al qualifications of recruits, that of not demanding a high 
standard of formal education but rather of requiring applicants 
to attain a certain standard on an educational achievement test, 
is supported by the above data. 

(b) Criterion Group IT 

As in the other three groups, the bulk 
of members in Group IV fall in the Grade Ten to Grade Twelve 
range. It has, however, a higher percentage in the Grade Twelve 
and a lower percentage in the below Grade Nine category than 
has any other group. This percentage distribution in Group IV 
may be a reflection of a generally higher standard of education 
amongst the population as a whole or it may indicate that stan¬ 
dard which applicants are required to attain on the R.C.M.P. 
educational achievement test is somewhat higher than is neces¬ 
sary. Investigation of the R.C.M.P. educational achievement 
test scores of the four criterion groups would help to clarify 
this point. 


# 

## 


The percentage in' each criterion group of the total number 
of members in I, II and III is: I - £5.4, II - 53.2, III - 


21.3 


Gh4dt> 


This observation is valid only insofar as the Greup 8 to 
uife&p 12 educational range Is concerned.

II. Additional Education 

Table three shows that approximately half the number of 
members in each of Groups I, II and III has acquired additional 
education of some sort. Groups I and II are in this respect 
more similar to one another than either is to Group II. Group 
IV has a noticeably lower percentage who have taken additional 
educational training than has any of the other groups. How¬ 
ever, as Group IV is,on the whole, a much younger group (see 
Table Four) and thus has had less time to acquire such training, 
little significance can be attributed to the percentage differ¬ 
ence at this time* 

Although little difference was apparent ii^regard to the 
percentage of each group that had taken additional educational 
training, some difference might lie in the kind of additional 
education taken. The type of additional education was\there¬ 
fore investigated and tabulated under four headings: Clerical, 
Technical, Academic and Mixed. Under the mixed category were 
tabulated those members who had taken more than one of the other 
three types. Had time been available, a finer breakdown of the 
Mlaced category (viz., into Mixed Clerical/Technical, Mixed 
Clerical/Academic, etc.) might have been of some value* 

Table 3A contains the percentage distribution for the 
Criterion groups with regard to type of additional education.

(a) Criterion Groups I, II and III 

All three groups have their 
highest percentage in the Clerical category. Group I has its 
second highest percentage in the Academic category, whereas 
in Groups II and III the second highest percentage is under 
Technical. Group I also shows a noticeably higher percentage 
under Mixed. 

This distribution indicates that a large percentage of 
all three groups shows an interest in clerical training, but 
that the most efficient group has a larger percentage of its 
members interested in Academic pursuits and a lower percentage 
interested in Technical pursuits than has the mediocre and least 
efficient groups. The least efficient group shows slightly less 
interest in Academic and slightly more in Technical than does 
the mediocre group. 

(b) Criterion Group XV 

Group IV shows a lower percentage under 
Clericalj and a higher percentage under Technical J than does any 
of the other groups, and thus in regard to additional education 
shows more similarity to the mediocre and least efficient group 
than to the most efficient group. However, as Group IV in¬ 
creases in age and more of its members take additional courses, 
this distribution may change. 

Present Age 

The present age of the members of each group was tabulated 
under intervals of five. Table IV contains the percentage dis¬ 
tribution by age of the four criterion groups.

(a) Criterion Groups I, II and_III 

Group I has the highest per¬ 
centage of its members in the 35 to 39 bracket and has nearly 
as high a percentage in the 40-44 bracket. Group III has its 
highest percentage in the 30-34 bracket and nearly as high a 
percentage in the 25-29 bracket. The age ranges for these 
groups which include^ the bulk of members ^bi: Group I - 35 to 
49 years; Group II - 30 to 44 years; Group III - 25 to 39 years* 
This percentage distribution shows that from Group I to 
Group III there is a decrease in the age level of the groups, 
and this suggests that lack of experience is one of the reasons 
for the lowered efficiency rating of some members of Group III. 
Whether or not this is so will be more apparent after tabula¬ 
tion and analysis of the data on length of service. 

(b) Criterion Group IV 

As Group IV is composed of members recruit 
ed within the last few years, it has a much lower age level than 
any of the other groups. Nearly Q5°/ 0 of its members are below 25 
years of age. 

Length of Service 

The length of service of each member in the total test 
group was determined. This information was tabulated under inter 
vals of five. Table 5 contains the percentage distribution in 
regard to years of service for each criterion group.

(a) Criterion Groups I, II and III 

Group I has the highest per¬ 
centage of its members in the 15-19 years of service bracket, 
whereas both Groups II and III have their highest percentages in 
the 5-9 bracket. The bulk of Group I members falls in the range 
10 to 24 years of service. The bulk of members in Groups II and 
III sse in the 5 to 19 range; however, Group III is more heavily 
weighted in the 5-9 bracket and less heavily weighted in the 10- 
14 and 15-19 brackets than is Group II. Each of Groups II and \ 
III has only about half the percentage of members with more than 
19 years of service that Group I has. 

The percentage distribution for length of service shows 
that the members of the most efficient group have for the most 
part appreciably more years of service in the Force than have 
those of the mediocre group; a corresponding relationship obtains 
between those of the latter group and those of the least effici- 
ent group. A crtese correlation between length of service and 
level of efficiency is thus implied. 

As a further check upon the relationship between length of 
experience and efficiency in the Force, the total number of mem¬ 
bers falling into each length of service bracket was determined 
and the percentage of th^ttotal that was in each criterion group 
was calculated. Table 5A contains the percentage distribution 
according to criterion group, of the members in each ’service* 
bracket:

In the foregoing table the percentages in the brackets *25- 
29 years* and *30 years and up* are extremely high in Group I 
and very low in Group II plus Group III. It must be noted here 
that members with this extent of service are well within the 
pensionable range, that many of the less efficient members when 
reaching pensionable age would not wish to remain in the Force, 
and that the most efficient members would be more Mkely to wish 
to remain and would be retained by the Force. The proportion of 
efficient to inefficient members in these brackets would thus be 
much higher than in the other brackets. 

The distribution in Table 5A shows that from the bracket *5- 
9*years* to the bracket *25-29 years* there is, with one slight 
exception, a steady increase in the percentages in Group I and a 
steady decrease in the percentages in Group III. Thus, when com¬ 
paring the efficiency of groups of R.C.M.P. members with varying 
service records, the higher the "service bracket** of the group, 
the larger will be the percentage of its members in the most effi 
cient group. 

The information derived from Tables 5 and 5A indicates that 
there is a positive correlation between length of service and de¬ 
gree of efficiency. A further indication is that,with few excep¬ 
tions, even the best of *Mounted Policemen* require at least ten 
years of service before attaining a Group I level of efficiency.

(a) Criterion Groups I, II and III 

The percentage distribution 
in Table 6 shows that by far the highest percentage of members 
of each of the criterion groups is in the bracket *20-24 years*. 
The percentage distribution in the three criterion groups is 
very similar. Therefore no conclusion in regard to the relation¬ 
ship between age of engagement and efficiency rating can be drawn 
on the basis of this distribution. 

(b) Criterion Group IV 

In Group IV the percentage of members who 
engaged between the ages of 20 and 24 years It the same as those 
in Groups I, II and III. However, a higher percentage of Group 
IV members engaged when below 20 years of age and a lower percen¬ 
tage between the ages of 25 and 29 years than in the other three 
groups.

(a) Criterion Groups I, II and III 

The percentage distribution 

in Table 7 showw that Group I has a higher percentage of married 
members than either Group II or Group III, and that these latter 
two groups have about an equal percentage of married members. 
However, in each of the three groups over 85% of the members are 
married men. Whatever differences there are in these percentage 
distributions can for the most part be explained by reference to 
existing marriage regulations in the Force and to the percentages 

of the three groups in the f 24-29 years of age’ bracket (Table 4) 

# 

and the *5-9 years of service® bracket (Table 5). 

Nothing can be determined here of the comparative efficiency 
of married and unmarried men. 

(b) Criterion Group IV 

Because of existing marriage regulations, 
Group IV comprises unmarried men only. 


# In each of Table 4 and Table 5 the bracket referred to con¬ 
tains those members who have just become eligible for marriage 
under current marriage regulations.

Background 


15 


The background, whether rural, urban, or a combination of 
the two, of each member of the test group was ascertained. Table 
8 contains the percentage distribution, according to type of back 
ground, of the members of each criterion group. Only in Group IV 
was there any tabulation in the Mixed category.

(a) Criterion Groups I, II and III 

All three groups have a higher 

percentage of members with urban than with rural backgrounds. Of 
the three groups,Group I has the highest percentage with urban 
and the lowest with rural backgrounds. Group III has the highest 
percentage with rural, and the lowest with urban, backgrounds. 

It is apparent from the above data that there is a notice¬ 
able decrease in the percentage of members with urban backgrounds 
and a corresponding increase in the percentage with rural back¬ 
grounds, as one proceeds from the most efficient to the least ef¬ 
ficient group. 

It was determined from the tabulation sheets that the pro¬ 
portion of urban-raised to rural-raised members of the entire 
test group was 2:1. The percentages of the number of rural-raised 
members in each criterion group to the total number of such mem¬ 
bers were then calculated; similar calculations were made in re¬ 
gard to urban-raised members. 

Table 8A contains the percentage distribution by criterion 
group of members with rural and urban backgrounds.

The percentage distribution in Table 8A shows that the 

vfc 

greater percentage of rural-raised members are in the mediocre 
and least efficient groups, whereas the greatest percentage of 
urban-raised members are in the mediocre and most efficient 
groups. 

The data presented in Tables 8 and 8A indicate^ that an 
urban background is a factor making for efficient service in the 
Force. 

(&) Criterion Group IV 

The percentage distribution under back¬ 
ground for Group IV shows that, unlike the other three groups, it 
has a higher percentage of its members in the rural than in the 
urban category. That is to say, Group IV has, of all the groups, 
the highest percentage of rural-raised and the lowest percentage 
of urban-raised members. In the light of the inference drawn in 
section (a) above, the distribution in Group IV does not argue 
favorably for the future efficiency of its members, other things 
Deing equal. 


Father y s Occupation 

The occupation of the father of each member of the test 
group was determined and tabulated in one of the categories list¬ 
ed in Table 9. In the original tabulation there were separate 
categories for skilled and semi-skilled tradesmen; however, in a 
great many cases it was difficult to place a given occupation 

definitely into one o? the other of these two categories. There-

fore, the skilled and semi-skilled occupations were tabulated 


in one Category - Tradesman. As the numbers in each of the 
categories from "Clerical” to "Managerial-Executive" (inclusive) 
were too few to be statistically reliable, they were grouped to¬ 
gether and recorded in the category "White-Collar Workers”.

(a) Criterion Groups I, II and III 


The percentage distribution in 


Table 9 shows that well over half of the entire test group is com 
posed of members whose fathers are (or were) Tradesmen (skilled 
or unskilled) or Farmers. 

There are noticeable differences between the distribution of 


Group I and that of the other two groups, which are quite similar 
in their pattern of distribution. Group I has a lower percentage 
in the Unskilled and in the Farmer category than has either Group 
II or Group III* Group X has a higher percentage in the Police/ 
Military and White-Collar categories than has either Group II or 
Group III. 

Thus in the most efficient group there is a higher percen¬ 
tage of sons of Police/military men and of White-Collar workers 
and a lower percentage of sons of Unskilled Workers and of Far¬ 
mers than in the mediocre and least efficient groups.

However, a study of the distribution in Groups II and III 
shows in each of the categories except the 'White-Collar 9 that, 
although Groups II and III are more similar to one another than 
either is to Group I, Group III is slightly more similar to 
Group I than is Group II. Thus the position of Group III in re¬ 
lation to Groups I and II detracts from the significance of any 
inference which might be drawn from the data. 

In an effort to clarify the above situation, further cal¬ 
culations were carried out. The total number of members that 
fell in each of the categories in question was determined, and 
the percentages of the total in each of the three criterion 
groups were calculated. 

Table 9A contains the percentage distribution according 
to criterion group of the total number of members in each of 
five occupational categories.

weighting in Groups II plus III than in Groups I plus II. 

(2) Police/Military has a heavier weighting in Groups I plus 
II than in Groups II plus III. In the Tradesman category the 
weighting is almost equal. 

(3) White-Collar workers have a slightly heaviei^reighting in 
I plus II than in II plus III.

The information furnished by Tables 9 and 9A when taken in 
conjunction indicates that, other things being equal, the sons 
of Police or Military men, and to a lesser extent, those of 
f White-Coliar f workers more frequently develop into efficient 
members of the Force than do sons of unskilled workers and far¬ 
mers. Further, sons of tradesmen (skilled and semi-skilled) 
develop into efficient members more frequently than sons of 
farmers and unskilled workers, less frequently than sons of 
Police or Military men and, to a slight extent, White-Collar 
workers* 

(b) Criterion Group IV 

Group IV is less similar to Group I than 
is either Group II or Group III. It shows a higher percentage 
of sons of farmers and unskilled workers and a lower percentage 
of sons of white-collar workers than any of the other groups. 

In view of the observations in (a) above, such a distribu¬ 
tion in Group IV may not prove favorable. 

Pre-Engagement Occupation 

The type of employment of each member of the test group 
previous to his engagement in the Force was determined and tabu¬ 
lated under one of the headings listed in Table 10.

or tradeswork before joining the Force* 

Group I has a higher percentage in the ’Tradesmen* cate¬ 
gory and a lower percentage in the ’Unskilled* category than has 
either Group II or Group III. The latter two groups have approx¬ 
imately equal percentages in these two categories, but such 
slight differences as there are make Group II more similar to 
Group I than is Group III. 

Group I has a larger percentage of its members in the ’Cleri¬ 
cal’ category than has Group II, whereas Group II has a larger per¬ 
centage than has Group III in this category. 

This distribution indicates that members whoscpre-engagement 
occupation was that of a tradesman (skilled or semi-skilled) or a 
clerical worker more frequently become efficient members of the 
Force than do members whose pre-engagement occupation was of the 
unskilled type* 

The percentages in the categories ’Clerking/Selling’ and 
’Professional’ are higher in Group I than in Group II or Group 
III; however, Group III in both categories is more similar to 
Group I than is Group II. In an effort to clarify the situation 
further calculations were carried out. 

Table 10A contains the percentage distribution according to

above-mentioned categories*

The percentage distribution in Table 1QA showl^ that in the 
Unskilled’ category the weight falls in Groups II plus III, 
whereas in the ’Clerical Worker T , ’Clerk/Salesman’ or ’Profes¬ 
sional man’, the weight falls in Groups I plus II. In the 
’Tradesman’ category there is a slightly heavier weighting in 
Groups I plus II than in Groups II plus III. 

In view of the information derived from Tables 10 and 10A 
it may be concluded that, other things being equal, recruits 
whose pre-engagement occupation is that of a white-collar worker 
(Clerical, Salesman, Professional) more frequently develop into 
efficient members of the Force than do recruits whose pre-engage¬ 
ment occupation is of an unskilled type. Those whose pre-engage¬ 
ment occupation was that of Tradesman (skilled or semi-skilled) 
more frequently develop into efficient members than those whose 
occupation was unskilled, less frequently than those whose occu¬ 
pation was that of a ’White-collar worker’. 

Criterion Group IV 

The percentage distribution of Group IV is 
less similar to that of the most efficient group$ than is the 
distribution of either Group II or Group III. Over 75$ of the 
members of Group IV were employed, before engaging in the Force, 
as unskilled workers. Although this distribution is not favor¬ 
able (cf. section (a) above), account must be taken of the much 
larger percentage of the members of this group who engaged when 
below twenty years of age (vide. Table 6).

(aJ Criterion Groups_I^ II_and JEII_ 

The percentage distributions 
in Table Eleven sbow only very small differences in the various 
categories between the three criterion groups. Group I has 
higher percentages in the 2 and 3 sibling brackets than has 
Group II or III, but in all other brackets the percentages in 
Group I are exceeded by the percentages in Group II and/or 
Group III. 

All that can be derived from a study of Table 11 is some 
slight indication that members with 2 or 3 siblings more fre¬ 
quently develop into efficient members of the Force than do mem¬ 
bers with a larger or smaller number of siblings. 

The percentage distribution according to criterion groups 
of the total number of members in each sibling category was cal¬ 
culated. Table 11A contains this distribution.

The percentage distribution in Table 11A shows that in the 


2 or 3 siblings categories the weight is slightly heavier in 
Groups 1 plus II than in Groups II plus III, whereas in all 
other categories the weight in Groups II plus III approximately 
equals or is slightly greater than the weighting in Groups I 
plus II• 

The data contained in Table 11A supports the indication 
found in Table Eleven. However, in both Tables 11 and 11A the 
differences between the most efficient, the mediocre and the 
least efficient groups in regard to the number of siblings are 
so small that it is difficult to draw any inference. 

(b) Criterion Group IV 

The percentage distribution of Group IV 
in regard to number of siblings shows the same general pattern 
as Groups I, II and III. It may be remarked that its percentages 
$n the 2 and 3 siblings categories are more similar to Groups II 
and III than to Group I. 

Humber of Charges 

The number of times each member had been charged for mis¬ 
conduct was determined. The percentage distribution according 
to the number of charges per member was determined for each of 
the four criterion groups. This distribution is presented in

(a) Criterion Groups_I JL lI_and_III_ 

The percentage distribution 

shows that in each of Groups I, II and III by far the largest 
percentage of members have had no charges laid against them, 
that the percentage of Group I in the No-Charge category is 
slightly higher than that of Group II and III, 

The second highest percentage in each group is in the one- 
charge category. Here, however, Groups I and II are approxi¬ 
mately equal and Group III is much lower. 

Group III has by far the highest percentage of members who 
have been charged more than once and Group I the lowest percen¬ 
tage in this respect. 

This distribution, reflecting as it does the obvious re¬ 
lationship between conduct and efficiency, is much as would be 
expected. 

vb ) Criterion Group IV_ 

Group IV has a higher percentage of its 
members who have had no charges laid against them than any of 
the other groups. Because of this group's comparatively short 
period of service no comparison can be made in this section be¬ 
tween it and the other groups® 

Military Training 

In regard to military training, members of the test group 
have been tabulated under three headings: 

(1) No military training (other than R.C.M.P. training) 

(2) Cadets or Boy Scouts only.

Force. The writer neglected to make this point clear to the 
personnel of the D.P.O.’s department who were compiling the 
data sheets. As a result, any adult military training, whether 
received before engagement, during engagement or between periods 
of engagement^ was recorded on the data sheet. It was in many 
cases impossible to determine from the entries on the data sheet 
whether the training had been received before or after engage¬ 
ment. Therefore if a member had received any adult military 
training, apart from R.C.M.P. training itself, it was tabulated 
under that heading. 

Table 13 contains the distribution, by type of military 
training, of the members of each criterion group.

la) Criterion Groups I, II and III 

The percentage distribution in 
the three groups, although not equal in each category, is simi¬ 
lar. The highest percentage in each group is under f Adult Mili¬ 
tary Training 1 , the second highest under ’No Military Training’, 
and the lowest under ’Scout-Cadets only’. 

The percentage distribution of the least efficient groups 
is as similar to that of the most efficient group as it is to 
the mediocre gi?oup. This distribution would indicate that mili¬ 
tary training (other than that received in the R.C.M.P. itself) 
bears little, if any, relationship to efficiency in the Fcrce.

(b) Criterion Group 17 


26 


The percentage distribution in Group 17 
shows that it has a higher percentage of members with adult mili¬ 
tary training and a lower percentage with no military training 
than any of the other groups* 

In view of the observations in (a) above, little (if any) 
significance can be attached to this distribution in regard to 
the future efficiency of the members of this group* 


Nativity and Immigration Age 


1. Nativity : 

Table 14 contains the percentage distribution of members 
of the four criterion groups with regard to the country of their 
birth. In the original tabulation, each specific country was al¬ 
lotted its own category. However, it was found that the largest 
proportion of the members of the test group was born in Canada, 
that, of the remainder, the majority were born in the British 
Isles, a few in the United States and a very few in other count¬ 
ries. 

A more consolidated tabulation chart was drawn up, which 
contained only four categories - Canada, British Isles (and 
other parts of the British Empire), the U.S.A* and 'Others 1 . 

(In only three cases out of the entire group were members born 
in other parts of the British Empire than Canada and the British 
isles. Thus the second category is referred to hereafter as the 
British Isles group).

27. 

(a) Criterion Groups I, I^ and III 

Each of the criterion groups 

I, II and III has a higher percentage of its members who were 
born in Canada than who were born elsewhere. In Group I, how¬ 
ever, the percentage of members born in Canada is lower than 
that in Group II and that in Group II is in turn lower than that 
in Group III. The percentage of members born in the British 
isles is highest in Group I and lowest in Group III. 

The distribution thus shows that the more efficient the 
group the higher the percentage of British-born members. 

Because the analysis of the data on Age and Length of Ser¬ 
vice indicated a positive correlation between efficiency and 
experience, it was considered advisable, before drawing con- 

'/esiltA / 1 &e*-V'cc v 

elusions, to investigate the gene ral-ag e levels of Canadian- 
born and British-born members within each criterion group. 

Table 14A contains the percentage distribution with re¬ 
gard to length of service of these two sub-groups. (For com¬ 
parison between sub-group and total group, Table 5 may be con¬ 
sulted ).

The distribution in Table 14A shows that in each criterion 
group: 

(1) The bulk of Canadian-born members falls within the range 
5 to 19 years of service. 

(2) The bulk of British-born members falls within 10 to 24 
years of service. British-born members have thus, as a whole.

more experience as members of the Force than have Canadian- 
born members similarly considered. Therefore the larger per¬ 
centage of British-born in the more efficient groups may be 
as much or more the result of experience as of nativity per se. 
This distribution also suggests that the ratio of British-born 
to Canadian-born has decreased considerably in the past 15 years. 
This ratio amongst those members with over fifteen years ser¬ 
vice is approximately 5:7, whereas for those with below fifteen 
years it is 1:9. 

To ascertain more definitely whether or not British-born 
members more frequently become efficient members of the Force 
than do Canadian-born members, a comparison was made between 
Canadian-born and British-bom members who had approximately 
equal periods of service, i.e., fell within the same "Service" 
bracket (5-9, 10-14 etc.) Therefore the total number of 
Canadian-born and the total number of British-born who were in 
each "Service* bracket was determined and the percentage of 
totals in each of the three criterion groups was calculated. 

Table 14B contains this percentage distribution according to 
criterion group of the Canadian-born and British-born members 
in each Service* bracket.

brackets are omitted from consideration in the interpretation 
of fable 14B. In the bracket ’5-9 years’ there are only four 
British-born members; therefore this bracket is also excluded 
from consideration for the present purpose. 

In the bracket ’10-14 years’ of service the Canadian-born 
and the British-born have a percentage distribution among the 
three criterion groups that is approximately the same. In the 
‘15-19’ bracket the British-born group has a slightly higher 
percentage of its members in Criterion Group I than has the 
Canadian-born group, an approximately equal percentage in 
Group II and a lower percentage in Group ill. In the ’20-24’ 
bracket the British-born group has a much higher percentage of 
its members in Group I than has the Canadian-born group; also 
in this bracket the bulk of British-born members is in Groups 
1 and II, whereas the bulk of Canadian-born members is in Group 
IX. 

The percentage distribution in fable 14B indicates that 
amongst members of the Force who engaged twenty or more years 
ago, those who were born in the British Isles more frequently 
developed into efficient members than did those who were born 
in Canada. This difference in efficiency potential/between 
Canadian-born and British-born recruits has decreased with the 
passing years and is scarcely discernible at the present time^ 
(b) Criterion Group IV_ 

Over 90 % of Group IV was born in Canada. 
With the above indications regarding nativity in mind, the data 
furnish no clue to the probable efficiency to be expected of 
these members of the Force.

Immigration Age

Table 14C contains the percentage distribution according 
to immigration age of the members of each criterion group who 
were not born in Canada. Although some differences between 
Criterion Groups I, II and III are apparent, these are such that 
the distribution of the least efficient group is as similar to 
that of the most efficient group as it is to that of the mediocre 
group. From these distributions therefore no apparent relation¬ 
ship between immigration age and efficiency can be discerned.

Interests and Activities 

The personal file on each member of the Force contains, in 
the great majority of cases, a complete account of his main in¬ 
terests and activities from the time he was in school up to the 
present. Considerable difficulty was experienced in finding a 
way to summarize and tabulate the wealth and variety of infor¬ 
mation offered. Time did not permit too detailed a transcrip¬ 
tion and study of this data. It was felt to be most expedient 
under the circumstances to study the record of the interests and 
activities of each member and from the knowledge thus obtained 
to classify him in regard to each of the following three main 
aspects of his interests and activities: 

(1) Whether his interests and activities are restricted or 
diversified. 

(2) Whether they are mostly solitary, mostly gregarious, or 
a more or less T half and half’ combination of the two.

The percentage distribution in Table 15 shows that in re¬ 
gard to: 

S§stricted = Diversified 

A negligible percentage of the members of 
any group falls in the ’Restricted’ category;and this indicates 
that the interests of the members of the test group as a whole 
are of a diversified rather than a restricted nature. 
Solitaryra^egarious 

A negligible percentage of any group falls in 
the ’Mostly Solitary’ category. It is indicated here that the 
interests of the test group as a whole are more of a gregarious 
than of a solitary nature. The percentages in the ’Mostly Gre¬ 
garious’ and the ’Mixed’ categories show that from Group I to 
Group IV the groups are progressively more gregarious in their 
interests and activities.

±ndoqr Outdoor 

A negligible percentage of any group falls into 
the f Mostly Indoor’ category. This distribution indicates that 
members of the test group as a whole show more interest in outdoor 
than in indoor activities. The percentages in the ’Mostly Outdoor’ 
and ’Mixed’ categories show that from Group I to Group IV the 
groups are progressively more interested in outdoor activities. 

It has been previously determined that each criterion group 
from I to n has a lower age level than has the group proceding 
it. As the percentage distributions under Interests and Activi¬ 
ties indicate that from Group I to Group IV the groups are pro¬ 
gressively more interested in vigorous pursuits and less inter¬ 
ested in quieter pursuits, it is felt that the differences shown 
in Table 15 are in all probability a reflection of differences in 
the age levels of the four groups. 

A more detailed investigation of interests and activities of 
members of the Force will be necessary to determine any relation¬ 
ship that exists between nature of interests and activities and 
general efficiency in the Force.

PART 1. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS . 

Of the sections dealt with in the foregoing pages, certain 
ones yielded little information in regard to any relation between 
a particular aspect of background, training and ability, and ef¬ 
ficiency as an R.C.M.Policeman. Other sections afforded definite 
indications that such a relation did exist. It is well to remem¬ 
ber that each section has been dealt with separately and conclus¬ 
ions drawn on the proviso of other things being equal. 

1. A factor which contributes to the relative inefficiency of 
some members of the Force is that of lack of sufficient mental 
capacity to meet the high standards required. New members as 
a whole attain a higher standing on the R.C.M.P. Psychometric 
Test than older members. It may therefore be concluded that 
the use of the Psychometric Test, a device for estimating the 
mental capacity of applicants, reduces the number of recruits 
who will later prove inefficient because of inadequate mental 
capacity, further to this it is indicated that the present 
selection requirement in regard to psychometric test score is 
such that it effectively eliminates applicants who are unsatis¬ 
factory in this Respect with a minimum wastage of satisfactory 
applicants* 

2. The amount of formal education (if not below a Grade 8 stand¬ 
ard) possessed by members of the Force has little connection 
with their efficiency as R.C.M. Policemen. The present selec¬ 
tion requirement in regard to formal education is a wise one. 

The new members of the Force have as a whole a higher 
standard of formal education than have the more experienced 
members. This higher standard may be in the main a reflection 
of a generally raised standard of education in the general

34. 

population or it may be the result of the selection require¬ 
ment in regard to the educational achievement test. If the latter 
is the case, the requirement on that test could be lowered without 
impairing present standards of efficiency in the Force. An inves¬ 
tigation of the educational achievement test scores of the members 
of the four criterion groups would throw more light on this situa¬ 
tion, 

3. There is a positive correlation between years of experience in the 
Force and degree of efficiency attained. Very few of even the best 
members attain a high (Criterion Group I) level of efficiency un¬ 
til they have approximately ten years of service in the R.C.M.P. 

4. New members in the main are joining the Force at an earlier age 
than did the older members. Further investigation is required to 
determine whether or not there is a relation between age of en¬ 
gagement and efficiency. 

5. Members who possess a rural background less frequently develop 
into efficient members of the Force than do members with urban 
backgrounds. A very large proportion of the group o:$3iembers re¬ 
cruited within the last five years has rural backgrounds. These 

facts indicate that more consideration should be given to type of 

* 

background (rural or urban) when selecting recruits for the Force. 

6 . Members whose father T s occupation is that of an unskilled trades¬ 
man or a farmer less frequently develop into efficient members 
than do members whose father’s vocation is on a higher occupation¬ 
al level. Sons of police and military men are most promising of 
all. There is a greater proportion of sons of unskilled workers 
and farmers among the new members than among the older members. 
These facts suggest that it would profit the Force to give more 
attention to the occupation of the fathers of prospective recruits.

It is well to consider in connection with, paras, (5) and (6) 
above that the advantages afforded both rural children and chil¬ 
dren of low wage-earners are much greater now than a few decades 
ago. 

7. Members whose pre-engagement occupation was of an unskilled 
nature develop less frequently into efficient members of the 
Force than do those whose employment previous to engagement was 
on a higher occupational level. Members whose pre-engagement 
occupation was of a t white-collar ' nature are most promising. 
There is a high percentage of the group of new members whose 
pre-engagement occupation was of an unskilled type. The facts 
here determined indicate that the efficiency of selection would 
be increased if more attention were paid to the type of work at 
which the applicant is employed. 

8. There is no indication that* at the present time, there is a 
relation between country of nativity and efficiency as a Mounted 
Policeman. At one time, however, in the history of the Force, 
members born in the British Isles more frequently developed into 
efficient Mounted Policemen than did Canadian-born members. 

The proportion of the Force composed odjfaembers born in the 
British Isles has decreased considerably within the last twenty 
years and the R.C.M.P. is becoming composed, to an Increasingly 
greater extent, of Canadian-born members. 

9. Little indication was found of a relation between the number 

of the member f s siblings and his efficiency as a Mounted Police¬ 
man. 

10. A more detailed investigation than the present one is required 
to determine what, if any, relation obtains between efficiency 

in the Force and pre-engagement military training, marital status, 
engagement age, and nature of interests and activities.

THE MINNESOTA MULTIPHASIC PERSONALITY INVENTORY. 


The first psychometric test to he sent to the 325 members of 
the R.C.M.P. (K and E Divisions) who volunteered to participate 
in this investigation, was the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
inventory in its Group Form (Hereafter referred to as the M.M.P.I. 

The rationale of the M.M.P.I. is that the total personality 
of an individual comprises a number of traits or characteristics 
in dynamic interrelationship; that, although in all individuals 
the personality matrix is structured from the same component 
traits, the degree to which each of the traits is operative varies 
from individual to individual; and that the resultant personality 
patterns are diverse. The M.M.P.I. is designed to measure the de¬ 
gree to which each of ten clearly defined personality traits 
varies from the norm of the statistically average individual. The 
profile chart which may be thus drawn up permits analysis of the 
relative strength of the traits, the pattern of which is often 
more important than the presence of any one trait to an abnormal 
degree. ^ 

The ten personality traits measured by the M.M.P.I. will be 
often referred to in the following pages, usually in abbreviated 
form. The name of each trait and its abbreviated form is listed 
below:- 


Hypochondriasis-Hs 

Hysteria-Ey 

Depression-D 

Psychopathic Deviate-Pd 
Masculinity-Femin¬ 
inity-Mf 


Parano ia-- -Pa 

Psychasthenia-Pt 

Schizophrenia---Sc

Social Introversion-Si 


The M.M.P.I. was used in this investigation in an effort to 
determine whether:

inefficient Mounted Policemen in regard to the degree to which 
various traits are present in their personality patterns; 

(b) it discriminates between groups of R.C.M.Policemen and men- 
in-general; 

(c) existing standards of selection are in accordance with or show 
implicit cognizance of any differences determined; 

(d) the M.M.P.I. in its present or in some revised form would 
prove a useful tool in distinguishing between desirable and un¬ 
desirable applicants, provided that the differences cited in 
(a) and (b) above were discernible. 

When work was commenced on the M.M.P.I, data, 308 completed 
test blanks had been returned and scored. Table (B) contains the 
composition by Division (K and E) and by Criterion Group of the 
total M.M.P.I. test group.

The conscious or unconscious tendency of subjects to 
present a certain picture of themselves in taking a personality 
inventory has an influence upon the scores they make. This test¬ 
taking attitude may be one of two general types: 

(a) Defensive - the subject is cautious in his replies and 
tends to put himself in a too favorable light. 

(b) Plus-getting - the subject is overly honest and self-

critical and tends to make himself appear worse than 
he really is. 

The K scale on the M.M.P.I. is a device for determining 
test attitude and for taking its effect into account by correct¬ 
ing the scores on the five scales most susceptible to its effect. 
The use of the K factor thus increases the validity of any clini¬ 
cal interpretation based on those scores. 

Our primary consideration in dealing with the M.M.P.I. is 
its value as a discriminatory tool; the clinical meaning of sig¬ 
nificant differences found to obtain between groups, although im¬ 
portant, will be a secondary consideration. If the M.M.P.I. does 
differentiate effectively between test groups an item analysis 
will be carried out, subsequent to this investigation, to deter¬ 
mine those items which are of discriminatory value. 

Significant differences between means of K-corrected raw 
scores on a scale would indicate that the scale was discriminat¬ 
ing between groups on a basis of answers to items plus considera¬ 
tion of test attitude. Significant differences between means of 
raw scores (uncorrected for K) would indicate that the scale was 
discriminating between groups on a basis of answers to test items 
alone. The use of raw scores (uncorrected for K) would thus give 
a clearer indication of the discriminatory value of M.M.P.I. items, 
per se, and consequently of the expediency of carrying out an item 
analysis. 

In the work that follows the various test groups will be com¬ 
pared on a basis of raw scores uncorrected for K. If, however, a 
clinical interpretation is given of differences between group 
scores it will be subsequently determined whether the addition of 
the K factor necessitates any change in that interpretation.

Personality Scores and Patterns 
The mean raw score on each of the scales of the M.M.P.I. 
was determined for the four criterion groups of Mounted Police¬ 
men. By converting these means into Standard (T) scores, group 
profiles were drawn. The T scores of the four groups (calculated 
from raw scores and from K-corrected raw scores) are included in 
Table 20; the group profiles are reproduced in Tables 21 and 
21(a). 

The group profiles indicate: 

(a) Differences are present among the scores of the criterion 
groups on several of the personality scales. 

(b) Although there are differences among the personality scores 
of Criterion Groups I, II and III, the personality patterns are 
similar insofar as the composite pattern of the three groups 
differs from that of men-in-general. /? 1 The pattern presented 
by Group IV, on the contrary, differs from both that of the 
other criterion groups and that of men-in-general.

profile of this group, because of the method used in for¬

To determine whether the 

differences between group scores 

were of statistical 

significance, 

critical 

ratios were calcu- 

lated between the means listed in 

Table 22. 

Critical ratios 

were not calculated, 

however, 

when it was apparent, 

from an ex- 

amination of the means, standard deviations 

i and critical ratio(s) 

already determined, 

that the resulting ratio would be quite in- 

significant. It may 

be safely assumed that 

the missing ratios 

are of a value below 

1.00. Table 

23 contains the critical 

ratios that were determined.

The critical ratios in Table 23 show that on only four 
scales does the M.M.P.I. discriminate between criterion groups 
and then only at the to 4% level of significance. The Hy and 
Pt scales differentiate between G-roups I and III, the Pa and Sc 
scales between Groups Hand III 

A further examination of the tables of means and critical 
ratios yields the following observations: 

(1) Many of the critical ratios are, comparatively speaking, of 
much greater significance than others. In the main, the ratios 
of comparative significance occur between Groups I and III and 
between Groups II and III; (the ratios between I and II are, 
with but one exception, comparatively insignificant). 

(2) On the majority of the scales to which these ratios of com¬ 
parative significance apply, Group III scores highest of the 
three criterion groups; on the remainder, with one exception, 
Group I scores highest. 

Thus, Group III scores highest on: 

Pt, Sc, Si, Pa, F, Pd 

Lowest on: 

Hy, K 


Group I scores highest on: 

Hy, K 

lowest on: 

Si, Pt, F 


Group II scores highest on: 

L 

lowest on Sc, Pa, Pd. 


If the information in paragraphs (1) and (2) above is con¬ 
sidered in conjunction with that afforded by the ratios which are 
of actual significance (Zfo to 4% level), it is strongly indicated 
that the basic personality pattern of Group III differs from that 
of Groups I and II; that is to say, the group comprising the least 
efficient members differs in personality pattern from the other 
two groups.

Clinical interpretation of the above data reveals in the 
personality pattern of Group III tendencies toward a mode of 
life-adjustment in respect to which it is distinguishable from 
that of Group I and Group II. Specifically, the members of the 
least efficient group tend to be characterized by a less 
socially-oriented (or more inward-turning) mode of life-adjust- 
ment (with more asocial behaviour manifestations indicated) 
than do the members of the most efficient and mediocre groups; 
of the latter two, it is indicated that the mediocre members 
are, as a group, slightly less socially-oriented than the most 
efficient members. 

Influence of the K Factor : 

Thus far in our consideration of the 
personality scores of the criterion groups the means which were 
used were those of raw scores uncorrected for K. In this sec¬ 
tion comparisons of means of raw scores corrected for K will be 
made between the various groups; the results will point to any 
need for modification of the clinical interpretation of differ¬ 
ence between the criterion groups. 

The K (correction) factor is used on five scales - .5& is 
added to the raw Hs score; .4K to the raw Pd score; IK is added 
to both the raw Pt and raw Sc scores; .2K is added to the raw 
Ma score. In calculating corrected means, the appropriate K 
factor was added to each individual raw score. 

Table 24 contains the corrected means, theif standard de- 

# Adjustment - the process of fitting one T s self, one’s 
individuality^into the social pattern. 

Socially-oriented type of adjustment - that type of adjust¬ 
ment which shows recognition of and sensitivity to social 
demands. 

Inward-turning type of adjustment - that type of adjustment 
which tends to avoid meeting social demands in concession 
to inner demands, the demands of one’s individuality.

The change in actual size of the means themselves has little 
relevancy to our purpose here. Our concern is with the changes 
in the differences between means which will result in the alter¬ 
ation of critical ratios. 

An examination of the critical ratios listed against the 
five scales in question (in Tables 23 and 24) reveals that some 
changes have been effected. The addition of the K factor has, 
with but one exception, tended to reduce the value of the criti¬ 
cal ratios. This exception is the Hs scale; here the ratios have 
been raised from insignificance to comparative significance, dif¬ 
ferentiating between Group I and the other two groups, (as does 
Hy); for both Hy and Hs then, Group I scores highest of the three 
groups. Since, clinically speaking, elevated Hs and Hy scores 
are both indicative of a socially oriented type of adjustment, 
support is afforded the previous contention that (although both 
Group I and Group II tend to adjust in a more socially-oriented 
manner than Group III) Group I has a slightly greater tendency 
to adjust in this direction than has Group II. 

It is to be noted, further, that the addition of the K 
factor erases any indication of differences in strength of ten¬ 
dency toward asocial behaviour; otherwise the alterations in C.R.

values effect little change in the kind of over-all picture pre¬ 
sented. Indications that Group I and IT tend to adjust in a 
more socially-oriented manner than Group III, although less mark¬ 
ed, are still in evidence. 


Personality Scores - New and Old Members . 

The members comprising Criterion Group IY have all joined 
the R.C.M. Police within the last five years and are thus a group 
of relatively new members. 

To determine whether new members would show any significant 
difference in personality scores from those of the older members, 
the mean raw score of Group IY on each of the scales was compared 
to the mean raw score of all other members of the test groups. 

In this section Group IY will be referred to as the New group and 
the others as the Old group. 

Table 25 contains the means, their standard deviations, and 
the critical ratios of the differences between those means, for 
the New and Old Groups.

The critical ratios listed in Table 25 indicate that

several scales discriminate significantly between New and Old 
Groups and that others discriminate at the 1% to 4 $ levels of sig¬ 
nificance. 

(a) On the following scales the New group scored significantly 
higher ( 2% level or better) than the Old: 

Sc, Ma, Pt, Pd, F. 

(b) On the following the Old group scored significantly higher 
(4 °/o level or better) than the New: 

L, K. 

It is evident from the above that the M.M.P.I. does discrim¬ 
inate effectively between New and Old members of the Force. An 
important point to be considered in connection with the differences 
indicated is whether they will be an aid or an impediment to the 
new members in their efforts to adjust to life in the Force. 

An examination of the means and critical ratios listed in 
fables 23 and 25 will confirm the following observations: 

4a) With but one exception (the Ma scale) those scales which 
differentiate significantly between new and older members of 
the Force are also the scales on which critical ratios (on a 
basis of the comparative significance of their values) indica¬ 
ted differentiation between the least efficient members (Group 
III) and the other members of the older groups (Groups I and II). 
(b) In each case the variation of the new members from the older 
members is congruous with the variation of the least efficient 
members from relatively efficient members. 

The scores of the new members are thus more similar to those 
of the group of least efficient members than to those of the other 
two groups. 



11 . 

A clinical interpretation of the personality differences be¬ 
tween New and Old groups, as shown by the M.M.P.I. , indicates 
that the new members of the Force are less inclined than are older 
members to adjust to life in a socially oriented manner. Further, 
they have a greater tendency toward hyperactivity and asocial be¬ 
haviour. 


Influence of the K factor.

score means (for the five scales on which the K factor is used)

A comparison of the critical ratios listed in Tables 25 and 
26 shows that, with but one exception, they have been lowered in 
value. That exception, as was the case with Criterion Groups I, 
II and III when the K-factor was added, is the Hs scale (on which 
the Old group scores higher). 

The effect of the addition of the K-factor necessitates only 
one change in the clinical interpretation already given - the 
greater tendency of the New group toward asocial behaviour is 
less marked. 


The data presented thus far in our study of M.M.P.I. results 
indicate that new members of the Force, in regard to personality 
scores and pattern, are somewhat different from older members,

but that of the three groups of older members it bears more 
similarity to the least efficient than to either the most 
efficient or the mediocre group. This does not argue favorably 
for their future satisfactory adjustment to life in the Force 
and, therefore, for their future efficiency as R.C.M. Policemen. 

In regard to the foregoing, two conditions which distinguish 
Group IT are to be taken into account. 

(1) Group IT is, on the whole, much younger than any of the 
other groups. 

(2) Many members of Group IT are still in the process of adjust¬ 
ing to a new and different environment. 

These factors could account to some extent for the scores 
of new members varying from the scores of older members. The 
somewhat general elevation of the Group IT p e ople over those of 
the other groups might be so accounted for. However,the above- 
mentioned factors do not account for the selection of scales on 
which this variance is expressed. The selection of those scales 
is determined by basic personality features, not by difference in 
prevailing environment. 

Personality Scores - R.C.M.Policemen and Men-in-General . 

By arrangement with Dr. S. R. Hathaway, co-author of the 

M.M.P.I., raw score means of the groups of average, normal 5 adult 

males used in the standardization of the M.M.P.I. were secured. 

# (4) 

These groups are representative of men in general. ' 

The group of experienced R.C.M. Policemen, that is all 
members of Criterion Groups I, II and III, were taken as repre¬ 
sentative of R.C.M. Policemen.

The critical ratios listed in Table 27 reveal that four 
scales - MF, Hy, Pt, Sc - differentiate significantly between 
counted Policemen and men in general. Two other scales - Ma, 
x j - differentiate between the groups at the 1% and 2% levels 
of significance. 

In comparison with men in general, Mounted Policemen score: 

(1) significantly higher (2% level or better) on scales Hy, Ma, 

D and Mf, 

(2) significantly lower on scales Pt and Sc. 

The M.M.P.I. discriminates, effectively between R.C.M.Police¬ 
men and Men in general and indicates that Mounted Policemen have 
a personality pattern distinct from that of men in general. 


A clinical interpretation of the differences in scores be¬ 
tween the two groups indicates that Mounted Policemen in compari- 
son te men in general are more socially-oriented in their adjust-

ment to life, have a greater tendency toward hyperactivity and 

# 

toward depression, and tend to be more feminine in their interests. 

The addition of the K factor to raw scores necessitates only 
one alteration in the clinical interpretation just given. The K> 
corrected scores indicate that, in addition to the above noted dif¬ 
ferences, Mounted Policemen show a stronger tendency toward asocial 
behaviour than do men in general. 


Personality Scores - New Members and Men in General. 

Group IT was not included in the comparison of Mounted Police¬ 
men with men in general. Group IT is composed wholly of young, 
comparatively inexperienced constables who have not yet engaged 
for a second term of service. They could not, therefore, be con¬ 
sidered as representative of R.C.M. Policemen generally. In this 
section the New members of the Force are compared to men in general. 

The critical ratios pertaining to the differences between mean 
scores of these two groups are:

The addition of the K factor increases the value of the cri¬ 
tical ratios on four of the five scales on which it is used; on 
the fifth scale it reduces the C.R. value to some slight extent. 
The addition of the K factor will, therefore, effect no modifica¬ 
tion in any clinical interpretation offered below, but rather, 


# The Mf scale, in the writer’s opinion, is not an entirely satis¬ 
factory one. In such work as he has done with the M.M.P.I. male Mf 
scores have been, with few exceptions, above 50. The M.M.P.I. is 
being used in two projects now in progress at this university; the 
means scores obtained for the Mf scale in both these projects tend 
to confirm the above opinion. The mean raw score on the Mf scale 9 ? 
for a group of 96 male Army personnel is 22. 8 ' 5 '; for a groun of >5 
male civilians employed at various kinds of work it is ' ,

will increase its validity. 

oix of the scales (calculating from uncorrected raw scores) 
afford critical ratios that are significant at the level or 
oetter; with the addition of the K factor this number is raised 
to seven. The scales that differentiate between the two groups 
are: 

Mf, Hy, Ma(Ma + .2K), Pd(Pd + o4K), Pt(Pt-flK), Hs(Hs+.5K), Sc+lK. 
Group IV scores higher on all these scales but Hs. 

xt is evident from the foregoing that the M.M.P.I. discrim¬ 
inates effectively between new members of the R.C.M. Police and 
men in general. Here, as before, it is important to regard the 
nature of these personality differences in relation to the outlook 
for satisfactory adjustment to life in the Force. 

examination of the foregoing tables of means (both uncorrected 
and N-corrected) and critical ratios will confirm the following ob¬ 
servations : 

(1/ eoth New members and R.C.M.Policemen score significantly 

higher (3% level or better) than men in general on the follow¬ 
ing scales: 

Mf, Ma, Pd, Hy.

score significantly lower than men in general on the follow¬

behaviour. However the mode of life adjustment of the older 
members of the Force is more socially-oriented, whereas that of 
the new members Is less socially-oriented (therefore inward¬ 
turning) than that of men in general.^ 

It may be concluded from the foregoing data that new members 
of the Force, although they are similar in certain personality 
characteristics to the older, more experienced members, have a 
personality pattern that does not adhere to the personality pat¬ 
tern typical of R.C.M. Policemen. 


SIMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory was used in 
this investigation to determine: (1) whether differences in per¬ 
sonality pattern could be discerned between groups of efficient 
and relatively inefficient members of the R.C.M. Police and between 
groups of R.C.M. Policemen and men in general. (2) whether current 
standards and methods of selection showed implicit cognizance of 
any differences so discerned. 

1. The M.M.P.I. discriminates effectively between: 

(a) R.C.M.Policemen and men in general. 

(b) New members of the Force and men in general. 

(c) New members of the Force and older members of the Force. 

The M.M.P.I. discriminates, but less effectively than in the 
above instances, between efficient and relatively inefficient 
members of the Force. 

2. R.C.M. Policemen in comparison to men in general adjust to life 
in a more socially-oriented manner; show a greater tendency 

# Some argument might be offered against this interpretation on the 
basis of the Hy scores. It is felt that the Hs scores counter¬ 
balance the effect of the Hy scores, thus increasing the signif¬ 
icance of the Pt and Sc scores.

toward, hyperactivity and asocial behaviour and a slightly 
greater tendency toward depression. 

These personality characteristics, then, may be considered 
as typical of successful Mounted Policemen and therefore desir¬ 
able in those who are engaged for service in the Force. 

Efficient members of the Force show a somewhat greater ten¬ 
dency to adjust to life in a socially-oriented manner than do 
relatively inefficient members; however there is little, if any, 
difference between efficient and relatively inefficient members 
in regard to tendencies toward hyperactivity, depression and 
asocial behaviour. Therefore, in relation to successful assimi¬ 
lation into life in the Force and efficiency as a R.C.M.Policeman 
a socially oriented type of adjustment to life appears to be of 
primary importance, the tendencies toward hyperactivity, depres¬ 
sion and asocial behaviour of secondary importance. 

5. New members of the Force in comparison with older members are 
less socially-oriented in their adjustment to life and have a 
stronger tendency toward hyperactivity and asocial behaviour. 

The variation in personality pattern of new membersffrom older 
members is, in the main, congruous with the variation of the 
least efficient members from the most efficient members. 

4. New members of the Force in comparison with men in general show 
a greater tendency toward hyperactivity and asocial behaviour* 
Their mode of adjustment to life is less socially-oriented than 
that of men in general, that is to say the mode of adjustment is 
of an inward-turning nature. 

5. In view of the foregoing it may be concluded that the personality 
pattern typical of new members of the Force is, despite similarity 
in one or two aspects, basically different from the pattern typi-

cal of R.C.M. Policemen. 

6 . The findings in this part (Part II) of the present investiga¬ 
tion indicate that more effective selection, in regard to per¬ 
sonality characteristics of recruits for the R.C.M. Police, is 
desirable. If those responsible for the selection of recruits 
were provided with some device enabling them to judge, more accu¬ 
rately the similarity of the applicant’s personality pattern to 
that of successful Mounted Policemen the efficiency of selection 
would be increased. 

7. This investigation has shown that the M.M.P.I. contains many 
items that discriminate between R.C.M. Policemen and men in gener¬

INDIVIDUAL PROFILES. 



APPENDIX A. 


individual Profiles. 

The raw scores of each of the 308 members were converted 
into standard (T) scores and an individual profile chart was 
drawn up for every member of the test group. 

It was our intention to submit these charts, bearing only 
the profile, the subject T s age and an indent ification number, to 
an expert in the use of the test and in the interpretation of 
profiles, and to have him: (1) select from among the 308 profiles 
any which indicated that the general efficiency of the subject 
would be impaired because of a personality problem; (2) indicate 
the general type of personality difficulty involved. The profile 
charts were numbered in such a way as to afford no indication of 
the subject's efficiency rating. 

By arrangement with Dr. S. B. Hathaway, co-author of the 
M.M.P.I., the services of one of his graduate students, Mr. G-. 

M. Guthrie, were secured for this part of the project. 

At the present time we have received from Mr. Guthrie a 
a list containing the numbers of those charts on which the pro¬ 
file indicated the presence of such personality difficulties as 
would impair the subjects efficiency.'^ 

Hereafter those members whose efficiency may be impaired 
because of the presence of personality difficulties shall be 
referred to as E-jmembers. 

Using the information furnished by Mr. Guthrie’s report, 
the number of E- members in each criterion group was determined 


# These personality difficulties render the individual less 
efficient than he otherwise would be, not necessarily in¬ 
efficient.

and expressed as a percentage of that criterion group,, 

These percentages are: 

Group I Group II Groun III Group IV 

9.6% 8.9% 13.2% 24.1% 

Criterion Groups I, II and III. 

Of the three groups of exper¬ 
ienced members, the least efficient group has the highest per¬ 
centage of E- members. The groups of most efficient and med¬ 
iocre members are approximately equal in this respect. 

When complete information is received in regard to the 
type of personality difficulties involved some differentiation 
between efficient and relatively inefficient members on a basis 
of type of personality difficulty may be attempted. Until such 
information is received little more can be said in regard to 
the personality difficulties of Groups I, II and III. 

Criterion Group IV 

Group IV has a much higher percentage of E- 
members than has any other group. This condition demands at¬ 
tention. 

The personality difficulties of these members either 
(a) had been developed after engagement with the Eorce and were 
therefore precipitated by prevailing environmental conditions, 
or (b) had been precipitated prior to engagement but had not been 
detected by present methods of selection. 

If (a) above is the major reason for the higher percentage 
of E-members in Group IV it suggests the need of an investiga¬ 
tion to determine and rectify those conditions in the R.C.M.P. 
which make it difficult for new members to adjust quickly and 
easily to life in the Eorce.

If (b) above is the major reason for the higher percen¬ 
tage of E- members in Group IV it indicates that present 
standards and/or methods of selection, insofar as personality- 
characteristics are concerned, are inadequate and that there¬ 
fore those responsible for the selection of recruits for the 
Eorce are in need of more adequate tools to aid them in as¬ 
certaining whether or not applicants shall be recruited into

THE STRONG VOCATIONAL INTEREST BLANK 


The second psychometric test to be sent to those members of 
the R.C.M.P. who had volunteered to take part in this investiga¬ 
tion was the Strong Vocational Interest Blank, 

The Strong Vocational Interest Blank (hereafter referred to 
as the Strong) is based on the principle that men engaged in a 
specific occupation have a characteristic set of likes and dis¬ 
likes which differentiate them from men in other occupations. 
Consequently, if a man has an interest pattern similar to that of 
the men successfully engaged in a given occupation, he should be 
able to adapt himself to that occupational environment and should 
prove effective there because he would find the work congenial.) 

The Strong is designed to determine the similarity of the 
subjects interests to those of men successfully engaged in var¬ 
ious occupations. In addition to the occupational scales there 
are three special scales which measure: 

(1) The maturity of the subject’s interests,# 

{2} If his interests are more similar to those of business or 
professional men or to those of the ’ordinary working man’, 
the extent to which his interests tend to be more typically 
those of women or those of men. 

The Strong was used in this investigation in an effort to 
determine whether: 

vaj differences could be discerned between the interests of 

efficient and relatively inefficient members of the R.C.M.P. 
(bj differences could be discerned between the composite inter- 

f The Interest Maturity Scale is most reliable for subjects below 
twenty years of age and is not applicable to those over twenty- 
five years of age. It has therefore been disregarded in this 
investigation.

est pattern of R.C.M.P. members and that of men in general, 
v c; existing standards of selection in the R.C.M.P. are in 
implicit accordance with any differences thereby revealed, 
vdj the Strong, if such differences as cited in (a) and (b) can 
be discerned, would be an effective tool in the difficult task 
of distinguishing desirable from undesirable applicants. 


When work was commenced on the Strong,278 of the 525 Strongs 
had been returned and scored. Table C contains the composition 
according to Division (K and E) and criterion group of the Strong 
test group.

The group profiles indicate that: 

(a] differences do exist among interest scores of the four groups 
of Mounted Policemen on many of the occupational scales. 
v b / although there are differences among the interest scores of 
the four criterion groups, their interest patterns show mark¬ 
edly similar trends, insofar as the composite interest pattern 
differs appreciably from that of men-in-general. 


Interest Scores - Criterion Groups I, II and III 
Table 31 contains the means and standard deviations on each 
of the occupational scales for Groups I, II and III. To deter¬ 
mine whether the differences between group scores on the occupa¬ 
tional scales were significant, critical ratios were calculated 
between the means listed in Table 31. In those cases where it 
was apparent (from an examination of means and standard devia¬ 
tions and critical ratios already determined) that the remaining 
ratios would be quite insignificant, calculations were discontin¬ 
ued for that scale. These critical ratios are listed on the right 
hand side of Table 31*

In view of the above data it can be concluded that there are 
significant and discernible differences between the basic interest 
patterns of efficient and relatively inefficient members of the 
Force •

♦ 

It is to be noted that on over half the total number of scales the 
mean scores of Criterion Groups I, il and III show a progressive 
increase or decrease in size from Group I to Group III. On four¬ 
teen scales Group I scores highest, Group II second highest and 
Group III lowest. On ten scales Group I scores lowest, Group II 
second lowest and Group III highest. Except on those scales listed 
in sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 above, the actual differences between the 
means are not significant (in fact, some are most insignificant), 
nowever, the frequency with which the mean score of Group II, for 
any given scale, is in a position between that of Group I and 
Group III makes this point worthy of consideration as it may indi¬ 
cate the presence of interest trends.

Consideration of the comparative degrees of interest in 
various occupations (listed immediately above and in Section a) 
shown by the criterion groups indicates that the differences in 
interest patterns of Criterion Groups I, II and III may be sum¬ 
marized as follows: 

(a) Criterion Group I (most efficient) has interests more similar 
than has Criterion Group III (least efficient) to those of men 
successfully engaged in occupations which entail: supervision 
and direction in an advisory capacity; persuading and influenc¬ 
ing others; administrative and office work; activity in the 
business sphere. 

(b) Group I has interests less similar than has Group III to those 
of men successfully engaged in occupations involving:- interest 
in the medical and physical sciences; relatively little super¬ 
visory or administrative activity; lengthy preparatory or train¬ 
ing periods; relatively little persuasive activity or co-opera¬ 
tive group activity (team-work); activity in the professional 

or trades spheres. 

(c) Criterion Group II shows more interest in occupations entailing 
physical activity, especially of an outdoor nature, than does 
either Group I or Group III.

The Strong scales differentiate most effectively between the 
most efficient members and those comprising the remainder of the 
test group; the differentiation of mediocre from least efficient 
members is less clear-cut. 


Interest Scores - New and Old Members. 

Criterion Group IV is composed wholly of members recruited 
within the last five years and is therefore a group of relative¬ 
ly new members. 

To determine whether members recruited within the last five 
years have any significant variation in interest pattern from that 
of members previously recruited, the mean interest score of Group 
IV on each occupational scale was compared with the mean score of 
all other members of Groups I, II and III combined. (The latter 
will hereafter be referred to as the T 01d Group T , in distinction 
to Group IV which will be referred to as the ’New Group*) 

Table 35 contains the means and standard deviations of the 
uld and New Groups on the occupational scales, together with the 
critical ratios of the differences of the means:

An examination of the critical ratios listed in Table 33 
shows certain of Strong's Occupational Scales differentiate signif¬ 
icantly, or at no lower than the level, between the groups of 
■Old 1 and 'New T members.

Of these scales in (a) and (b) that discriminate between 

the ’New’ and ’Old’ Groups of members, five have previously been 

shown to differentiate between Criterion Group I(Most efficient) 

and Criterion Group III (least efficient). 

The ’New’ Group scores significantly higher (1% level or 

better) than the ’Old’ Group and Group III scores significantly 

higher (3% level or better) than Group Ion-.

The other five scales that discriminate between the’New’ 
Group and the ’Old’ Group do not discriminate between any two of 
the Criterion Groups: 

Accountant and Banker — The ’New’ Group scores significantly 
lower [1% leyel or better) on these scales than the ’Old 1 Group* 
Criterion Group III scores lower than Criterion Group I (but at 
no considerable level of significance). 

Physician — The ’New’ Group scores significantly higher (5% 
level) than the ’Old 1 Group. Group III scores higher than Group 
I (but at no considerable level of significance).

(5 % level) than the 'Old* Group. Criterion Groups I and III are 
approximately equal. 

Real Estate Salesman — The ’New’ Group scores significantly 
higher (5% level) than the ’Old’ Group. Group I scores higher 
than Group III (but at no considerable levelof significance). 

On the five scales that discriminate between the ’Old* and 
’New’ Groups and also between Criterion Groups I and III the varia¬ 
tion of the ’New* Group from the 'Old 1 Group is congruous with the 
variation of Group III from Group I. This congruity in variation 
implies that the interests of the group of new members may be more 
similar to the interests of the group of least efficient members 
than to those of the group of most efficient members. 

The tables of means and standard deviations (Tables 31 and 33) 
were examined for general trends that would strengthen or weaken 
the above implications. This examination showed that: 

(1) Of the sixteen scales on which the ’New* Group scored lower 
than the ’Old’ Group, Group III scored the lowest of the three 
criterion groups in fourteen cases, Group II in two cases and 
Group I in 0 Gases. 

(2) Of the twenty-four scales on which the ’New’ Group scored 
higher than the ’Old’, Group III scored highest of the criterion 
groups in twelve cases, Group II in 6 cases and Group I in 6 
cases. 

The data in paragraphs (1) and (2) above strengthens the in¬ 
dications previously found that insofar as the interest pattern of 
the ’New’ Group diverges from that of the ’Old’ it does so in 
closer congruency with that of the least efficient, than with that 
of the most efficient, members of the ’Old’ Group.

Time could not be found during the course of this investiga¬ 
tion to calculate the hundred and some odd critical ratios requir¬ 
ed to compare the mean score of Group IV on each occupational scale 
with that of each criterion group, whereby the indications stated 
in the preceding paragraph might have been further reinforced (in 
the writer’s estimation). 

In concluding this section, the manner in which the interest 

? ' 
v. 

pattern of Group IV approaches most closely to that of each one of 
Groups I, II and III is described briefly as follows: 

Group IV shows more similarity to Group I than to either of 
the other groups only in regard to interest in occupations entail¬ 
ing persuasive activity and/or verbal facility. It shows more simi¬ 
larity to Group II only in regard to interest in occupations involv¬ 
ing physical activity, especially of the outdoor type. Group IV 
shows more similarity to Group III in regard to interest in occupa¬ 
tions which entail: relatively little supervisory and/or administra¬ 
tive activity; training in the medical and physical sciences; lengthy 
preparatory periods; and activity in the professional sphere. 


Interest Patterns - R.C.M.Policemen and Men-in-General . 

The mean score of Strong’s ’Men-in-general* group is zero on 
each occupational scale. t2) A profile for the 'Men^in-General* 
group was drawn (Table 3a) and compared to profiles of the criter- 
ion groups of Mounted Policemen. The standard deviations of the 
means of the ’Men in general’ group were not available to the 
writer at the time of the investigation 77 ', and therefore it was not 
possible to calculate critical ratios of differences between means 
of the f Men-in-general’ group and means of the groups of Mounted 
Policemen._ 

#i Efforts are being made to secure this information from the author 
of tha test.

The observations which follow are offered without benefit of 
statistical confirmation. They are brief, general and tentative 
in nature. The profile of the group ’Experienced Members’ of the 
I'orce has been taken as representative of Mounted Policemen gener¬ 
ally. 


On certain of the occupational scales the means of Mounted 
policemen and of ’Men-in-general’ differ widely; these are listed 
in 1(a) and 1(b) below. Listed in 2(a) and 2(b) are other scales 
on which the differences between the means of the two groups, al¬ 
though less than those in 1(a) and 1(b), are quite noticeable. (In 
each case the Mounted Policemen score higher in (a) and lower in 
(b) than the ’Men-in-general’ group).

Prom a consideration of the scales listed above and of the

here. 


Mounted Policemen show more similarity of interest than do 
men-in-genera^ith men successfully engaged in occupations which 
entail: physical activity of an outdoor nature; active participa¬ 
tion rather than administration; exercise of delegated authority 
rather than of personal persuasiveness to achieve ends; relative 
freedom from dependence on the convenience of others.

Mounted Policemen show less similarity of interest than do 
men-in-general with men successfully engaged in occupations en¬ 
tailing: interest in the fine arts; persuasive ability and verbal 
facility; lengthy periods of preparatory study in which is involv¬ 
ed more theory than practice. 


Occupational Level and Masculinity-Femininity 
The Occupational Level (OL) and Masculinity-Femininity (MF) 
scales are not occupational scales;therefore, although they have 
been included throughout Part II whenever occupational scales were 
listed, no specific reference has been made to them. 

The purpose of the OL scale is to indicate whether the sub¬ 
jects interests are more like those of business and professional 
men or those of the common working man. The higher the subjects 
score, the greater the similarity of his interests to those of 
business and professional men. The MF scale serves to indicate 
whether the subjects interests are more like those typical of 
men or of women. The higher the subjects score the more T mascu- 
line 1 are his interests. 

uL Scores - Group I scores significantly higher than either Group 
ix or Group III, with Group IY scoring the lowest of any group. 
, 01d t members score higher than *New T members, but the difference 
of their mean scores is not significant (Critical Ratio^ - 1.6^) 

MF Scores - Group II scores significantly higher (1 % level) than 
Group I and higher than Group III (Critical Ratio - 1.49). T New T 
members score higher than f 01d 1 members but the difference of the 
mean scores is not significant (Critical Ratio - 1*62). 

On both the OL and MF scales Mounted Policemen score some¬ 


what higher than men-in-general. It has not as yet been determined 
whether the difference between their mean scores if of statistical

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS. 

The rationale of vocational interest tests is, that the 
nature of an individual’s basic interests has a more or less de¬ 
cisive bearing on the degree of success he may achieve in a given 
occupation and the concomitant ease with which he may achieve 
that success; that if an individual’s interests are similar to 
those of men successfully engaged in an occupation there is a 
good chance that he too will be successful in that occupation. It 
follows that if the individual’s interests are more similar to 
those of the most successful rather than to those of the least 
successful members of that occupation then, other things being 
equal, the probability of his future success therein is increased. 

1. This investigation has shown that many of the scales on the 
strong Vocational Interest Blank discriminate effectively be¬ 
tween groups of efficient and of relatively inefficient members 
of the R.C.M.P., which is to say that successful assimilation 
into the Force is a function of the basic interest pattern of 
the individual* 

2. Despite variations in intra-group patterns (indicating corres¬ 
ponding variations in efficiency in the Force) there is, never¬ 
theless, a composite interest pattern peculiar to members of the 
Force as a whole. This composite interest pattern of the R.C.M. 
Policemen has been shown to differ, widely in some cases, from 
that of men in general. Although statistical confirmation is 
lacking, it may be anticipated that many of the occupational 
scales will discriminate between R.C.M. Policemen and men-in- 
general. 

3. The investigation has shown that members recruited into the

Force within the last five years make scores on several of the 
occupational scales that are significantly different from those 
of older members of the Force. There were strong indications also 
that this group of new members tends to have basic occupational 
interests more in common with those of the least efficient than 
with those of the most efficient members of the »01d f , i.e. exper- 
ienced J group. 

4. It would appear then that the present standards and methods of 
selection show little implicit cognizance of the differentiation 
of basic interest patterns discerned by the Strong. If those 
responsible for the selection of recruits for the Force were 
supplied with some device for determining the similarity of the 
applicants’ basic interest pattern to that of successful members 
of the Force, more efficient selection would be effected. 

5. The foregoing considerations serve to indicate that the Strong 
Vocational Interest Blank might well be utilized for the improve¬ 
ment of the method of selection of recruits for the R.C.M.F. By 
means of an analysis, of Strong Interest Blanks completed by mem¬ 
bers serving in the Force, those items can be determined which dis¬ 
criminate between the basic interest patterns of Mounted Policemen 
and men-in-general, as well as between the most efficient and least 
efficient members of the Force. A special R.O.M.P. occupational 
scale, based on these items, might thus be devised and incorporated 
into the Strong in its present form; alternatively, these items 
could be combined with items of discriminatory value chosen from 
other tests in devising a special R.C.M.P. selection test.

GENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS, 



GENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


The purpose of this investigation was to study the standards 
and methods of selection currently used by the R.C.M.P. and to 
determine thereby any ways in which their standards and/or methods 
could be modified or complemented to increase their efficiency. 

The selection procedure of the R.C.M. Police can be divided 
into two stages - the preliminary screening process and the per¬ 
sonal interview. In the preliminary screening process the stand¬ 
ards an applicant is required to meet are so specific and definite 
that there is no room for uncertainty as to whether they are met. 
The efficiency of certain of these standards was studied by anal¬ 
yzing information from a personal data sheet that had been compil¬ 
ed for each member of the test group. This study comprised Part I 
of the investigation. In the second stage of the screening process 
the standards an applicant is required to meet are neither speci¬ 
fic nor tangible. The Divisional Personnel Officer has afguide list 
of qualities and characteristics considered desirable in recruits. 
With these qualities in mind the D.P.O. conducts an interview and 
decides whether or not the applicant is suitable for engagement in 
the Force. The efficiency of the standards and method of selec¬ 
tion used in the second stage of the screening process was studied 
by analyzing the results of two psychometric tests, the Minnesota 
Multiphasic Personality Inventory and the Strong Vocational Inter¬ 
est Blank (for men), completed by members of the test group. The 
study of the results of these tests comprises Parts Hand III of 
the investigation. 

The findings and conclusions are as follows: 

1. The R.C.M.P. Psychometric test (a device for estimating the

applicant T s mental capacity) is an effective aid to accurate 
selection, 

2. The present standard in regard to formal education is a wise 
one. Further investigation may indicate that the standing re¬ 
quired on the R.C.M.P. educational achievement test can he low 
ered with no resulting decrease in the competency of recruits. 

3. (a) Members with rural backgrounds less frequently develop 

into efficient members of the Force than do members with 
urban backgrounds« 

(b) Sons of unskilled tradesmen and farmers less frequently 
develop into efficient members of the Force than do sons 
of men on a higher occupational level. 

(c) Members whose pre-engagement occupation was that of an un 
skilled tradesmen less frequently develop into efficient 
members of the Force than do those whose pre-engagement 
occupation was on a higher level. This finding is defi¬ 
nitely supported by the scores made by the various groups 
on the Strong Occupational Level T scale. Group I (the 
most efficient members) score highest on this scale, then 
Groups II, III and IV in that order. 

Present standards of selection do not show cognizance 
of the above; if more attention were accorded these points 
there is a strong likelihood that the efficiency of selection 
would be increased. 

4. Both the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory and the 
Strong Vocational Interest Blank proved to be of value in dis¬ 
cerning differences between groups of: 

(a) R.C.M. Policemen and men in general. 

(b) New and older members of the Force. 

(c) Efficient and relatively inefficient members of the Force

5. The analysis of the M.M.P.I. and Strong results revealed that 
members of the Force recruited within the last five years dif¬ 
fer from the more experienced members in regard to^ertain im¬ 
portant personality characteristics and also in regard to the 
nature of their vocational interests. There are strong indica¬ 
tions that, in regard to those personality characteristics and 
vocational interests wherein they are similar to the more ex¬ 
perienced members of the Force, the new members are more like 
the least efficient than like the most efficient of the exper¬ 
ienced members. 

These findings suggest that the standards and method of 
selection used in the second stage of the screening process 
are producing less effective results than is desirable. 

6. There are two ways in which selection in the second stage of 
the screening process may be made more accurate. These are:- 

(a) By the use of more skilled and experienced interviewers. 

(b) By complementing present standards with more definite ones 
and at the same time providing interviewers with psycho¬ 
metric devices which, when used in conjunction with the 
personal interview, will make it possible to estimate more 
accurately the similarity of the personal attributes of the 
applicant to those of successful Royal Canadian Mounted 
Policemen. 

7 9 .The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory and the Strong 
Vocational Interest Blank can be of value in effecting more ac¬ 
curate selection. By means of an analysis of these tests com¬ 
pleted by R.C.M. Policemen, those items can be determined which 
discriminate between Mounted Policemen and men in general, and 
between efficient and relatively inefficient members of the
