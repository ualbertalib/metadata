ABSTRACT 

The area discussed in this thesis lies 
approximately 100 miles north-east of Vancouver, B*C., 
and constitutes the western part of the Ashcroft Sheet 
(Map 408A) which is bounded on the south and north 
by the 50th and 51st Parallels respectively, and on 
the west by longitude 122 degrees. The Ashcroft sheet 
comprises an area along the western fringe of the 
Interior Plateau, and the eastern flank of the Coast 
Range. Lytton is situated at the confluence of Fraser 
River and Thompson River; Lillooet is situated some 
five miles south of the confluence of Fraser River and 
Bridge River. The elevation of Fraser Valley is ap¬ 
proximately 1000 feet above sea level. To the east, 
the hills of the Interior Plateau rise to more than 
5000 feet; while to the west, the coast Moimtains rise 
to over 9000 feet. The area is sparcely populated and 
has no known important mineral deposits. 

The thesis is divided into three parts: 
geography of the area, geology of the area, and the 
geology of the Lillooet area. The stratigraphy, 
structure, and lithology of Foimtain Ridge, lying 
immediately to the east of Lillooet, are discussed 
in detail.

Along Fraser Valley, from south of Lytton 
to north of Lillooet, there extends a belt of Lower 
Cretaceous rocks, probably over 7000 feet thick, con¬ 
sisting of massive beds of argillite, arkose, gray- 
wacke, conglomerate, and some tuff. This belt consists 
of fault blocks, which appear to form a graben south 
of Lytton, and a step-faulted block at Fountain Ridge. 
The beds are generally steeply folded; and at Fountain 
Ridge they form a synclinal structure. The v/riter 
considers these beds to have been derived from the 
erosion of igneous and volcanic rocks which formed 
a height of land to the west. 

Fraser Valley, as far north as Lillooet, 
is flanked by intrusive masses of granodiorite, which 
on the west form part of the coast Moimtains, and on 
the east,the northward extension of the Cascade 
Mountains. These igneous rocks intrude several thous¬ 
and feet of schist, phyllite, and intercalated vol- 
canics which the writer has tentatively correlated 
with the Chilliwack G-roup, and which are probably of 
Permian or Pennsylvanian age. similar igneous rocks 
intrude the Lower Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, sever¬ 
al periods of intrusion are apparent; but what age rel¬ 
ationships these have to the age of the Coast Range 
igneous bodies the writer does not know.

To the east of Foimtain Ridge lies the 
western fringe of the Interior Plateau, The rocks 
here form some 2000 or more feet of volcanics, and 
presumably are a correlative of the Spence Bridge 
Volcanic Group, considered to be of Lower Cretaceous 
age* It is probably that part of this area consists 
of Tertiary volcanics* The TOiter considers these 
volcanics to overlie the Lower cretaceous sedimentary 
rocks of Fountain Ridge* 

Fraser Valley is filled with fluvio-glacial 
deposits of sand and gravel. Glacial striae on the 
hilltops indicate a general south-easterly movement 
of the Pleistocene ice sheet*

INTRODUCTION 

PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION 

The purport of this thesis is the compil¬ 
ation of a geological report on the areas flanking 
the v/estern and eastern slopes of Fraser Valley, 
British Columbia, from Lytton northward to Pavilion, 
and on the area flanking the eastern slope of Fraser 
Valley from Lytton southward to Keefers. The spec¬ 
ific problem concerns the structure, stratigraphy, 
and lithology of Fountain Ridge, east of Lillooet, 
from the mouth of Cinqfoil Creek at its southern 
extremity to the Camelsfoot Mountains extending 
northward from the mouth of Bridge River. 

The locations investigated are referable 
to the Ashcroft Sheet (Map 408A)• For the purpose 
of correlating strata mapped on this sheet, the reg¬ 
ional stratigraphy of the adjacent Nicola, Hope and 
Princeton sheets is discussed.

was engaged as Junior Geologist by the Geological 
Survey of Canada to assist Mr. K. C. McTaggart in 
completing the mapping of the v/estern portion of 
the Ashcroft Sheet. Mr. McTaggart was under the 
direction of Dr. S. Duffell whose party was complet¬ 
ing the mapping of the eastern portion of the 
Ashcroft Sheet. 

Particular attention was paid to the Lower 
Cretaceous sedimentary strata along Fraser Valley. 
For this reason, traverses across these beds were 
more closely spaced than those across areas of vol- 
canics and igneous intrusives. Because mapping was 
done on the scale of four miles to the inch, the 
nature of the wbrk precluded any detailed studies 
of structure or stratigraphy. However, in the case 
of Foimtain Ridge an attempt was made to ascertain 
the structural and stratigraphical relationships 
in some detail. 

The method of mapping was by means of 
pace and compass, positions being plotted on the 
Ashcroft sheet (contour interval of 500»)• To as¬ 
sist in pacing a counter was used. Considerable 
difficulty was experienced in estimating distances 
traversed while climbing through bush, v/herever

possible, stations v/ere located by means of triang¬ 
ulation, sightings being taken v/ith a Brimton compass 
on two or more knov/n landmarks. Aneroid barometers 
were also used, corrections being made prior to 
leaving camp in the morning, and on return in the 
evening. Hov/ever, as the contour intervals v/ere 
often found to be inaccurate, barometer readings were 
not particularly useful as a means of determining 
one’s position. 

Rock specimens v/ere collected of all types 
encountered. Directions of glacial striae, attitudes

ary beds, v/as taken to observe ’tops’ by means of

Laboratory Work 

The laboratory work consisted of an exam¬ 
ination of thin sections and crushed moimts of rocks 
from Fountain Ridge and the Lov/er Cretaceous vol- 
canics to the east of Lillooet. 

The samples so examined v/ere from scatter¬ 
ed localities; and while they did not give a detailed

EHTSICAL GEOG-RAPHY 


RELIEF AED ELEVATIONS 

The south-western portion of the Ashcroft 
Sheet comprises a section of the Coast Mountains, 
hounded on the east by the Fraser River. On the 
! eastern side of Fraser River, south of Lytton, the 
I Cascade Mountains extend south-ward to Hope, on the 
Ashcroft sheet the Coast Mountains are particularly 
rugged, rising on the average v/ell over 7500 feet 
i above sea level, v/ith some peaks exceeding a height 
I of 9000 feet. 

The relief of this region undergoes a mark¬ 
ed change east of the Fraser River and north of the 
Thompson River. Here lies part of the western portion 
of the Interior Plateau, characterized by flat topped 
hills around 5000 feet in hei^t. The area is deeply 
I incised with valleys 2000 to 5000 feet deep. 

In the north-western corner of the Ashcroft 
Sheet, between Bridge River and Fraser River lie the 
Camelsfoot Motmtains, rising to a height of not more 

than 6000 feet. These mountains are gently rolling, 

i 

i though presenting a steep slope from Bridge River 

valley.

In general, the v/estern part of the Ashcroft 
Sheet is extremely rugged and difficult to traverse. 
The water level of the Fraser River at Lillooet is 
approximately 800 feet above sea level. 

DRAINAGE 

The area of the Ashcroft Sheet is drained 
primarily by the Fraser and Thompson Rivers. The 
confluence of these two rivers is at Lytton. Into 
the Thompson River, just above Spences Bridge fla^vs 
the Nicola River, similarly, Bridge River joins the 
Fraser River about five miles north of Lillooet. 

Into these rivers flow numerous creeks. 

The drainage pattern, as a whole, is dendri¬ 
tic. During the spring rim-off creek beds, which dur¬ 
ing mid-s\jmmer afford a mere trickle of water, become 
rushing torrents, piling up alluvial fans where their 
gradient becomes less steep as they enter the Fraser 
and Thompson Valleys. The writer observed several 
instances of levees, ten or more feet high separated 
by narrow gulches fifteen to twenty feet deep, dovm 
which the spring r\m-off water must have poured as 
though through a giant hydraulic sluice. The erosion- 
al power of the stream system is very great.

During the spring flood the Fraser River 
becomes greatly swollen, rising six or more feet 
above its mid-summer level. At this time the river 
bars become completely re-sorted; and although the 
large bars remain from year to year in the some 
general positions, they shift somewhat and continual¬ 
ly change their shapes. The Fraser River is always 
muddy, unlike the Thompson River which becomes quite 
clear in late summer. The amount of fine grained 
and colloidal material carried down the Fraser River 
each year, and deposited on its delta, must be very 
great. Johnston (1921) states that the maximum load 
carried by flood waters of the Fraser River amounts 
in weight to 230 parts per million, whereas at low 
water the load may be as low as 10 parts per million. 
This fine grained material affords a curious phen¬ 
omenon, causing the river to »sing». When standing 
on the bank a soft, hissing sound is continously heard. 
Although the writer has found no reference to this 
phenomenon, he is of the opinion that it is due to 
the corrasion of the multitude of tiny grains of 
material being sv/irled along in the current. 

On the Ashcroft sheet the Fraser, Thompson 
and Bridge Rivers flow generally in a south-ward

direction* Nicola River, in the south-eastern portion 
of the sheet, flows to the north-west. The drainage 
I from the Coast Mountains, where snow remains above an 

I 

altitude of 6000 feet until late summer, is generally 
toward the Fraser River to the east. 

A notable anomaly to the drainage pattern 
is caused by a trough-like depression of the Interior 

I Plateau between the Fraser and Thompson Rivers. The 

( 

! drainage into this trough is effected by Hat creek, 

which flows northward. In the vicinity of the Trachyte 
Hills this creek divides. One branch flows to the 
I north-west into pavilion Lake, which is drained by 

i 

I Pavilion Creek into the Fraser River. The other 
branch flows to the north-east into Bonapart River, 

I a creek v/hich flows from the north, past the village 
of Cache Creek, emptying into the Thompson River at 

Ashcroft.

! CLimTE 

The climate in the Ashcroft, Lytton and 
Lillooet area is generally temperate and dry. Annual 
and diurnal temperatures vary considerably. During 
mid-winter the mean monthly temperature is probably 

seldom lower than ten degrees of frost. In mid-summer 
the temperature on hot days often rises well over

ninety degrees Fahrenheit in the shade. As is to be 
expected in a dry climate, the diurnal temperature 
range is considerable, in mid-simimer the mean lowest 
temperature is probably around forty degrees Fahrenheit, 

Temperature ranges vary with altitude. In 
mid-summer, at an altitude of four to six thousand feet 
the mid-day temperature is pleasantly warm; while the 
night temperature is unpleasantly cold, falling to 
aroimd forty degrees Fahrenheit, Conversely, at alti¬ 
tudes of less than 1000 feet in the Fraser Valley the 
mid-day temperatures are often very hot, rising as 
stated above, to around ninety degrees Fahrenheit; 
while the night temperatures are pleasantly cool, l/Yith 
some anomalies, it is probable that the vertical temp¬ 
erature gradient falls one degree Fahrenheit for every 
300 feet rise in altitude. Detailed information on 
temperature ranges is given by Dawson (1894) in an ap¬ 
pendix to his report. 

Rainfall throughout the year is scanty, 

Dawson (1894) states that the annual rainfall at 
Spences Bridge is around ten inches. Even in that 
part of the coast Mountains included on the Ashcroft 
Sheet the annual precipitation is small compared to 
that of the more westerly mountains in the coast ranges.

The prevailing v/esterly winds, by the time they ar¬ 
rive in the area of the Ashcroft sheet are comparative¬ 
ly dry. 


In the Fraser Valley the prevailing v/ind 
is from the north, probably being a subsidiary air 
current of the westerly winds. The writer has observ¬ 
ed, his observation being confirmed by local inhabit¬ 
ants, that this prevailing northerly wind is usually 
accompanied by clear, dry v/eather; whereas when the 
wind does on occasion come from the south, it brings 
rain. 

Local variations are found in the amount 
of precipitation. In Botanie Creek valley, just north 
of Lytton, the anntial precipitation is imusually high. 
According to Dawson (1894) the snow lies to a depth 
of three or more feet during mid-winter. This large 
precipitation is no doubt the reason v/hy such a luxuri¬ 
ant and varied growth of vegetation is found. At cer¬ 
tain times of the year the Indians freouented this val¬ 
ley in their search for herbs and roots. It is of 
interest to note that the Indian word »botanie» means 
♦root gathering place*.

FAUNA AM) FLORA 

The faima in this region generally frequent 
certain horizons pecTiliar to their species. Although 
overlapping of these horizons does occur it can be 
said, for example, that the grizzly bear (TJrsus horr- 
ibilis) which is commonly found in this region, makes 
its habitat above 5000 feet; while the coyote (Canis 
latrans) which is often seen in the sage-brush cover¬ 
ed flats of the Fraser Valley, is seldom to be foimd 
above 5000 feet* 

The black tailed deer (Cariacus macrotis) 
is very abundant, being found at all altitudes up to 
timberline. The white tailed deer (Cariacus virgin- 
ianis) is not so common, and usually frequents the 
heavily forested areas in the valleys. The black bear * 
(Ufsus americanus) is very common, usually being foimd 
above 2000 feet to timberline. Mountain goats (Oream- 
nos americanus) v/ere observed by the v/riter, surpris¬ 
ingly enough, at altitudes as low as 1500 feet on 
granite cliffs just south of Texas Creek in the Fraser 
Valley, Although no moose (Aloes gigas) were seen, it 
is evident from the prolificity of their stools that 
they have as wide a range as the black tailed deer. 

In the sage-brush covered areas, especially on rocky 
slopes, rattlesnakes are sometimes encountered. 








.A —-View, at elevation of 1,500 feet, 

looking in a north-westerly direction 
from Botanie Mountain across Fraser 
Valley. Note the rocky, arid slopes of 
Fraser Valley, sparcely wooded with 
black spruce. Also note the lodge pole 
pine in the left foreground, and the 
poplar in the right foreground. 


B - Fraser River, near Lillooet, 

shovring the calcium carbonate encrusted 
high water line along the shore. The 
river at this point is about 300 feet 
wide. Note the ferry cable.

Of the trees found in this region the yellow 
pine (pinus ponderosa) is particularly noticeable, be¬ 
ing foimd in stands at elevations usually of 1000 to 
2000 feet. The white pine (Pinus albicaiilis) and the 
jack pine (Pinus contorts) occur singly or in small 
stands, usually at higher altitudes of 3000 to 5000 
feet. Lodge pole pine (Pinus murrayana) is particular¬ 
ly common at lov/er altitudes along the Fraser Valley. 

Of the spruces, the black spruce (picea mariana) is 
most common. White spruce (picea canadensis) and Sitka 
spruce (Picea sitchensis) are also found, the latter 
growing to a considerable size in small stands in well 
watered valleys above 1000 feet. Among the firs, bal¬ 
sam fir (Abies subalpina) is the commonest. The white 
fir (Abies grandis) grows well in moist areas above 
1000 feet. The Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga douglasii) is 
not so common. The western larch (Larix occidentalis) 
is sometimes seen. 

In the Fraser Valley the poplar (Populus 
tremuloides) is very common along the lower reaches of 
the numerous streams. In the same locale the saska¬ 
toon bush (Amelanchior florida) grows abundantly, in 
similar moist places along streams, but at higher al¬ 
titudes the devil’s club (Oplopanax horridum) grov/s in

CULTTJHAL GEOGRAPHY 

ROADS /iM) FERRIES 

On the Ashcroft sheet the main highway 

follows 

hetv/een Vancouver and Kamloops/the Fraser River on 
the east side to Lytton, thence continuing along the 
Thompson River on the south side to Spences Bridge. 

I Here the highway crosses the Thompson River, temporari- 

i 

I ly leaving the river valley to pass through the village 
of Cache creek. This highway has an asphalt surface 
and is well maintained. The main highway between 
Lillooet and Lyiiton follows the Fraser Valley along 
the east side. From Lillooet this road continues 
northward to Quesnel through the village of Pavilion. 
This road is gravelled and well maintained. Gravelled 
I roads run from Lillooet south to the mouth of Texas 
Creek, and from Pavilion through Upper Hat Creek to 
Ashcroft. Numerous smaller roads and trails criss- 

! 

i 

I cross the coimtry, especially in the Interior plateau 

i 

area. Thro\igh the Coast Mountains trails are poor. 
Consequently, traversing is very difficult. 

With the exception of the bridge at Lillooet 
there are no highway bridges across the Fraser River. 

At Lytton, after high-water in late June, there runs 
a ferry large enough to transport automobiles. Else-

where, at Keefers, Inzman creek and Pavilion there ex¬ 
ist only small cable ferries; while at the latter loc¬ 
ation a one man rowboat constitutes the sole means of 
crossing the Fraser River. 

RAILWAYS 

The main lines of the Canadian Pacific and 
Canadian National Railways from Vancouver east pass 
through Lytton, Spences Bridge and Ashcroft. The 

I C.PIR* follows the east side of Fraser Valley, the 

! 

I C.N.R* the west to Lytton, and thence along the Thomp- 
j son Valley to Kamloops. 

The Pacific Great Eastern Railway from Howe 
Sound to Quesnel passes through Lillooet and Pavilion. 

1 There is no rail connection betv/een Lillooet and Lytton. 

SETIBELIBNTS AND POPULATION 

Ashcroft, Lytton and Lillooet are villages, 

I the population of each not exceeding two to three 

hundred persons. During the fruit packing season the 
population of Lillooet is considerably increased. The 
villages of Pavilion, Upper Hat Creek and Cache Creek 
consist only of a post office and a general store.

The population is a mixture of persons of 
European descent and local Indians. Many of these 
Indians have small farms or homesteads in Fraser Val¬ 
ley. Both Lillooet and Lytton Indians, and those from 
the Ashcroft area are of shushwap stock. During the 
war of 1939-45 several hundred Japanese have been set¬ 
tled at Lilboet. 

WATERPOVJER 

During the summer of 1946 the British 
Columbia Power Commission conducted a survey near the 
headwaters of Seton Creek about four miles south-west 
of Lillooet. In late summer Y/ork was commenced on 
the construction of a dam across Cayoosh Creek at the 
falls above the confluence of Cayoosh and seton Creeks. 
The hydroelectric power developed here will be greater 
than the domestic requirements of Lillooet and its 
adjacent areas; and it is intended to utilize this sur¬ 
plus power in irrigating the sage-brush covered terr¬ 
aces of Fraser Valley. 

FISHERIES 

During the summer of 1945 under the super¬ 
vision of the provincial government Department of 
Fisheries, v/ork was commenced on the building of a

fish ladder on Fraser River immediately above the 
mouth of Bridge River. High water, during the simmier 
of 1946, hampered further construction until the 
autumn. The site of this fish ladder is at a parti¬ 
cularly rapid stretch of the river. 

Local Indians have the privilege of killing 
salmon at all times of the year, provided they do not 
sell or ship, or cause to be sold or shipped the fish 
so caught. Their usual method of taking salmon is 
by means of a large net which resembles a butterfly 
net. 

FAEIIEHG 

In the Fraser Valley the climatic and soil 
conditions are very favorable for the raising of 
tomatoes, melons, celery and other market garden pro¬ 
duce. Tomatoes are raised in large numbers, particul¬ 
arly by the Japanese and Chinese, for shipment to 
Vancouver and the prairie provinces. Fruit trees grow 
well, though only a small amount of fruit is shipped. 

The greatest difficulty in farming is caused by the 
scanty rainfall, irrigation is a necessity, and long 
ditches have been dug from all streams on the nearby 
mountain sides, in general, mixed farming is practiced.

LmfBERING 

L™bering is a minor industry in the 

Lytton-Lillooet area* It is usually carried out on a ; 

I 

small scale, a few men running a portable sawmill |; 

and cutting timber from Crovm lands. Larger mills 

are established about tv/o miles east of Keefers and on | 

Kwotlenemo Lake at the head of Fountain Creek* A small ' 

>1 

boz mill at Lillooet supplies the local needs for fruit 
packing cases*

GEOLOGY OP THE AREA

STRATIGH.4PHY 


PREVIOUS V/OHK 

In 1871 Dr. A. R. C. sel\vyn, then DirectoF 
of the G-eological Survey, and Mr. J. Richardson made 
a reconnaissance from Yale, along the Fraser and 
Thompson Rivers to Kamloops. At this time he gave the 
name Jackass Mountain Group to an assemblage, several 
thousand feet thick, of coarse conglomerate, quartzite, 
sandstone and argillites typically represented at 
Jackass Moimtain, some tv/elve miles south of Lytton on 
the east side of Fraser River. 

From 1877-94 Dr. G. M. Dawson carried out 
extensive reconnaissance surveys in the general area 
of the Ashcroft sheet, publishing a great wealth of 
detail in his report of 1894. Dav/son^s map of 1894 
indicates his traverses, which for the most part fol¬ 
lowed numerous trails in the area. Much of the Coast 
Mountains, not easily accessible, Dawson provisionally 
mapped by means of binoculars. However, despite the 
reconnaissance nature of his v/ork, Dawson’s observa¬ 
tions have proved to be remarkably astute. Dawson in¬ 
cluded the Jackass Mountain Group with other formations 
in British Columbia in the all inclusive Queen Char-

lotte Island Group which he considered to be of Lov/er 
Cretaceous age. 

In 1912 N. L. Bowen assisted by E. L. Bruce, 
now head of the Department of Geology, Q'ueens universi¬ 
ty, made a reconnaisance survey along the Fraser Valley 
from Lytton to Vancouver. Bowen correlated the jackass 
Mountain Group, and other formations which he consider¬ 
ed to be of Lower Cretaceous age with the Pasayten 
Group to the south. 

No further work was done until 1945 when Dr. 

S. Duffell and Mr. K# C. McTaggart commenced work on 
the Ashcroft Sheet (Map 408A), adjacent to the Nicola 
Sheet to the east and the Hope sheet to the south. 

With the exception of a very small part of the sheet, 
along the Fraser Valley south of Lytton, the only 
geological reports on the area are those of G. M. Dawson 
in 1877 and 1894. These proved of great value as guides. 
The Ashcroft sheet v/as completed in 1946. It is ex¬ 
pected, however, that no complete report on the area 
will be published until 1948- 49.

CHILLBVACK GROUP 

This group consists of several thousand 
feet of slate, phyllite, crystalline limestone, ser- 
icitic and chloritic schists with intercalated beds 
of volcanics, conglomerate and quartzite, cairnes 
(1943) has mapped it just south of the Ashcroft Sheet; 
and McTaggart (1946) has mapped it extending into 
the Ashcroft sheet in the vicinity of Keefer»s. The 
writer is of the opinion that lithologically similar 
beds he mapped near Lillooet are also members of the 
Chilliwack Group, Cairnes states that certain marine 
forms indicate an Upper Carboniferous or Lower Permian 
age for the Chilliwack Group, This group is usually 
highly folded, and intruded by peripheral stocks, 
dykes and sills of the Coast Range batholiths, 

CACHE CREEK SERIES 

The Cache creek Series is very widespread 
in western and central British Columbia, Dawson 
(1894) divided the series into upper and a la*/er 
sections. The lower section consisted of phyllite, 
schist, cherty argillite and quartzite with some 
crystalline limestone and intercalated volcanics. 

The upper section consisted of several thousand feet

of limestone, quartzite and cherty argillite. The 
upper section is typically found in the Pavilion Lake 
area. The Chilliwack Group is probably a correlative 
of the lower section of the Cache creek Series. 


The Boston Bar Series along the Fraser River 
north of Hope were correlated by Dawson (1877) with 
what he considered to be Cache creek beds occurring 
at Texas and cayoosh creeks in the Lillooet area, and 
which he considered to be of Lower Carboniferous age. 
Probably the same series v/as described by Bateman 
(1911) as occurring along Siwash creek south of Boston 
Bar, and named siwash series. Camsell (1919) reports 
the same series of rocks in the valley of Cc^uihalla 
River, east of Hope, extending northward to Boston 
Bar. He considered them to be of cache Creek age. 
Cairnes (1957) states that the Fergusson series on 
Bridge River is probably a correlative of what he tem- 
ed Cache creek beds near Lillooet, which latter were 
described by Dawson (1894) along Cayoosh Creek. In 
using the term Cache creek Series the writer will con¬ 
fine his description to Dawson»s upper section. 


Cache Creek Series, at Pavilion Lake, north¬ 
east of Lillooet, is fossiliferous in some horisons and

is characterized by the large foraminifera FusiAa. 

The series is considered by Crockford and Warren (1935) 
to be Permian in age. Cockfield (1944) collected fos¬ 
sils in the Nicola area which suggested a Pennsylvanian 
age. 


Drysdale (1913) considered the Cache Creek 

I 

Series (including Dawson^s upper and lower sections) | 
to tdal some 15,000 feet. Daly (1915) gives a thickness | 

I 

of 13,700 feet for the Cache creek Series east of Kam¬ 
loops, evidently also including both upper and lower 
sections of Dawson.

NICOLA GROUP 


This group consists, for the most part, of 
pyroclastics and volcanic flows, estimated by Rose 
(1912) to be 10,000 feet thick. Duffell (1946) des¬ 
cribes this group, occurring in the Ashcroft area, as 
consisting of green andesites, tuffs and breccias, 
argillaceous and arenaceous beds and fossiliferous 
limestone, in the Nicola area, south of Kamloops Lake, 
Cockfield (1944) describes this group as having, in 
addition, some conglomerate. This same group is found 
in the Princeton area, to the south of the Nicola area, 
and is described by Rice (1945) as containing red and

purple feldspar porphyries and cherty argillite* 

Near the head of McGillivray creek, on the 
west side of the Fraser River between Lillooet ajid 
Lytton, the writer noted extensive* flov/s of purple 
feldspar porphyry, apparently similar to those described 
by Rice (1945), and which may be of Triassic age* They 
may also be Tertiary, although the writer has tentative¬ 
ly correlated them with volcanics in the Spences Bridge 
area, wiiich Duff ell (1946) considers to be of Lower 
Cretaceous age* 

LADNER GROUP 

This group consists largely of slates, with 
some schist, phyllite, quartzite and fine conglomerate. 
The age is placed by Cairnes (1943) as Upper Jurassic 
and possible Lower Cretaceous. The group is typically 
found between Boston Bar and Hope, and to the east of 
Fraser River. McTaggart (1946) tentatively correlated 
beds, occurring on the Ashcroft sheet near Keefer’s, 
with the Ladner Group, and considered them to be of 
Middle to Upper Jurassic age.

to the east of Hope, this group is described by 
Caimes (1943) as consisting of tuff, agglomerate, 
arkose, argillite and conglomerate. Caimes consid¬ 
ered this group to be of Lower Cretaceous age, though 
with Upper Jurassic affinities. Mr. K. C« McTaggart 
(1946)# mapped a succession of rocks at Lytton which 
he considers to be a correlative of the Dewdney creek 
Group. This succession lies in faulted contact with 
the intrusives of the Coast Mountains, and consists of 
some 6500 feet of tuffaceous arkose, conglomerate and 
shale, overlain by 2200 feet of laminated argillite and 
siltstone with some tuffaceous arkose. The succession 
is non-marine at the base and marine toward the top. 
Overlying this succession, possibly unconformably, is 
the Jackass Mountain Group, the basal member of which 
is a bed of conglomerate, several hmdred feet thick. 
Overlying this conglomerate, McTaggart described several 
thousand feet of tuffaceous arkose, conglomerate and 
i argillite of non-margin origin, which he considers to 
be of Albian age. 

During the summer of 1945 McTaggart collect¬ 
ed fossils from these beds. Dr. F. H. McLearn report¬ 
ed on the fauna as follov/s:-

Dr. Bell considered the florule as a whole 
to indicate an Aptian and Albian age. He states, 
"Cladophlehis sp. is a new species that was noted 
previously in a collection from a part of the skeena 
Group. It was there accompanied by some Jurassic 
hold-overs; but the florule as a whole was considered 
to be provisionally Aptian.” 

JACKASS MOUNTAIN GROUP 

The basal member of the jackass Moimtain 
Group is a massive conglomerate, the cobbles being 
mainly of leucocratic diorite, quartzite, and some vol¬ 
canic, probably varying in thickness from 500 to 1500 
feet. It is overlain by several thousand feet of 
massive beds of arkose, quartzite and shale. The 
typical section occ\irs at Jackass Mountain, just to 
the west of Kanaka Mountain, some twelve miles south 
of Lytton. 

At this locality Dawson (1894) collected 

the following fossils. 

Belemnites impressus (Gabb) 

Pecten meekiana (Whiteaves) 

Ancyloceras percostatum (Gabb) 

Crioceras iatus (Gacb) 

Pholadomya vancouverensis (Whiteaves)

These he provisionally considered to indic¬ 
ate an age equivalent to the Loxver Shasta of California, 
of lowermost Lower Cretaceous age. 

The writer unsuccessfully searched for 
Dawson’s fossil locality, and is of the opinion that 
the locality is not in the Jackass Mountain Group, but 
below the conglomerate. 

At the mouth of Stein Creek, near Lytton, 
Dawson (1894) collected non-marine forms, including 
Goniobasis ? sp. and selachian fish remains. These 
beds, according to Mr. K. C* McTaggart § overlie the 
Jackass Moimtain Group, and are possibly of Albian age. 

Dawson (1894) also reports collecting Aucella 
mosquensis var. concentrica on the west side of Fraser 
River three miles north of Intlpam Creek. At this 
locality the writer collected Aucella sp. These beds 
are highly folded, being intruded by diorite; and are 
considered by the writer to imderlie beds of Jackass 
Mountain Group age. Dawson also collected what appear¬ 
ed to be the crushed shells of Qstracoda , and fish bones 
from the shale at the mouth of Botanie Creek just north 
of Lytton. The age of these beds is uncertain; but 
the writer, who examined them briefly, is of the opin-

-ion that the conglomerate, indurated arkose and shale 
are part of the uppermost lackass Moimtain Group, and 
possibly of the same age as the beds at the mouth of 
Stein River. These beds at stein River also contain 
fish bones, and are considered by McTaggart, as pre¬ 
viously mentioned, to be Albian in age. 

Dawson (1894) correlated these beds at 
Botanie Creek with Cretaceous beds in the Fraser Val¬ 
ley, and in the opinion of the Tvriter, correctly so. 

i 

j He also correlated these beds with a series, some 
1 5,000 feet thick, of conglomerate, sandstone and 

I argillite at Ashcroft. A large, coarsely ribbed 
Fecten from the Ashcroft beds was described by Dr. 

T. W. Stanton as follows, ”So far as the characteris¬ 
tics are preserved, this specimen might be Jurassic, 
Cretaceous or Tertiaiy; but it is probably from the 
Jurassic”. The genus Fecten , is living at the present 
I day, so its presence is not indicative of the age of 
these beds. 


Duffell (1946) considers these beds at Ash¬ 
croft to be of Middle and Tipper Jurassic age, and cor¬ 
relates them with beds near Keefer’s which McTaggart 
(1946) tentatively considered to be of Ladner Group age.

From the same locality in which McTaggart 
in 1946 obtained the Angiosperms previously mentioned, 
Dawson in 1890 (see p.l48 of 1894 Report) collected 
plant remains. On these he reported as follows 


Platanus obtusiloba (Lesquereux) This is a 
species found in the Dalcota Group in 
Nebraska. 

Ill 

Magnolia tenuifolia ?(Lesquereux) This is 
found in tne Dakota of Nebraska and 
also in the Dunvegan Group of Peace 
River. 

Meninspermites allied to M.grandis of the 
feakota Oroup, but probably 'specific- 
ally different. 

Ill 

Laurophyllum several leaves referable to ' 

this genus, and near the Dakota species. 

sequoia A fragment v/hich may be s .rechenbachii 

Phragmites sp. or Carpolites sp. 


Dawson evidently considered the whole assemb¬ 
lage to be of Lower Cretaceous age. This particular 
locality is in the sandstone and shale beds above a 
conglomerate bed of undetermined thickness. Although 
the writer has only briefly examined these beds he is 
of the opinion that they lie within the Jackass Moun¬ 
tain Group. 


Pasayten Group, occurring in the Coquihalla 
area to the east of Hope, is probably of the same age

as the Jackass Mountain Group. Lithologically the 
two groups have a marked similarity. At Jackass 
Mountain the vn?iter measured a thickness of approxi¬ 
mately 1,500 feet for the basal conglomerate member 
(See Plates), in the Yale district Cairnes (1923) esti¬ 
mated a thickness of 1,400 feet for the conglomerate 
member of the pasayten Group. Cairnes (1943) consider¬ 
ed the succession of conglomerate, arkose, argillite 
and tuffs to be of Lower cretaceous age. Camsell 
(1911) reports that Aucella piochii and Prionocyclus 
sp. occur in the Pasayten Group. 

Bowen (191^ was of the opinion that the 
Lower Cretaceous beds along the praser River south of 
Lytton were correlatives of the Pasayten Group, and 
similar in fossil content to the Lower Cretaceous 
Shasta Series of California. 

The distribution of correlatives of the 
Jackass Mountain Group is very uncertain. Cairnes 
(1943) considered the Jackass Mountain and Dewdney 
Creek Groups to be of the same age, that is, Lower 
Cretaceous and possibly in part Upper Jurassic. Cam- 
sell (1919) reported a patch of conglomerate on the 
v/est bank of the Fraser River at Hope, which he thought

to be of Cretaceous age. The pebbles are of granite, 
granodiorite, slate and volcanics. He states that here 
it rests on the granodiorite batholith, but farther 
north rests unconformably on highly folded slates. 
Cairnes (1920) reported the same patch, and also tent¬ 
atively considered it to be of Lower Cretaceous age. 

In the Coquihalla area he also reported lithologically 
similar patches of conglomerate on cedar creek, on a 
ridge west of Tulameen Moimtain and on the summit of 
Silver Peak. The latter he reported to be 1,500 to 
2,000 feet thick, resting on the p lutonic rock of the 
coast range batholith. 

Cairnes (1943) described a series of some 
5,000 feet of beds at Harrison Laice as being of Lov/er 
Cretaceous age. The basal member is a thick conglom¬ 
erate of granitic detritus, overlain by light colored 
sandstones and sandy, grey argillite. These in turn 
are conformably overlain by massive, pale green beds of 
tuffaceous sediments. Dr. S. H. Criclcmay^ is of the 
opinion that these beds are definitely of Lower creta¬ 
ceous age. In his report (1930) he identified the 
following fossils from these beds:-

all inclusive Queen Charlotte Island Group* According 
to Anderson (1938), Whiteaves described many fossil 
invertebrates from the Lower Cretaceous beds of the 
Queen Charlotte Islands as being identical with, or 
analogues of, molluscan species occurring in the Horse- 
town Group, of Aptian age, in California. 

SPENCE BRIDGE VOLCAHIC GROUP 

The v/riter is of the opinion that this group 
is younger than the lackass Mountain Group* The beds, 
as described by Duffell (1946), consist of purple, red 
and green andesites, dark brown basalts, tuffs, breccia 
and agglomerate, with some interbedded conglomerate and 
tuffaceous sandstone* Duffell believes them to be of 
Lower Cretaceous age* Rice (1945) also considered the 
Spence Bridge Group to be of Lower Cretaceous age, and 
younger than the pasayten Group* 

There has been considerable difference of 
opinion as to the age of the Spence Bridge Volcanic 
Group* Correlations are difficult to make on litho¬ 
logic evidence, as volcanic beds are local in character. 

In 1877 Dav/son (1894) placed this group stratigraphical- 
ly below the Lov/er Cretaceous beds in Fraser Valley* 
Later, however, because of their association v/ith the

Kamloops Volcanic Group he placed them v/ith these 
Tertiary beds. 

Drysdale (1912) described a part of the 
Spence Bridge Group as follows:- «A coarse conglomer¬ 
ate near the base of the Spence Bridge Volcanic Group 
is composed of much granitic material, with boulders 
arranged overlapping one another eastward. The old 
fluviatile dq) osit appears from this to have been laid 
down in a river probably flowing from the Coast range 
into an interior basin to the east, where the sediments 
were soon entrapped and protected from erosion by young¬ 
er volcanics.” 

Drysdale (1912) was of the opinion that the 
Spence Bridge Volcanic Group v?as probably of the same 
age as the volcanics in the Hazelton Group. From tuffa- 
ceous beds on the western slopes of the pimainus Hills, 
east of the Spences Bridge, Drysdale collected the 
following plants, which were identified by W. 1. Wilson.

Wilson considered the assemblage to be of 
Lower Cretaceous age, probably equivalent to Kootenay 
flora, but with a definite Jurassic aspect. Dr. F. E* 
Knowlton, to whom the collection was later submitted, 
likewise considered them to be Kootenay flora, v/ith 
decided Jurassic affinities. 

COLDWATER GROUP 

This group, occurring to the south of Kamloops 
j Lake consists of conglomerate, sandstone, shale, tuff, 
and some coal. According to Cockfield (1944) these 
beds are of Upper Eocene age. Drysdale (1912) had pre¬ 
viously considered them to be Eocene, and questionably 

I 

Oligocene, correlating them with what he termed the 
Silikameen Beds. At Princeton, and elsewhere in the 
I Silikameen area. Rice (1945) described the Princeton 

i 

Group (probably the same as Drysdale’s Silikameen beds) 
as consisting of the conglomerate, buff colored sand¬ 
stone, and brown shale. Rice states that these beds 
are of Eocene or oligocene age. in places these sedi¬ 
ments are associated v/ith, and have intercalated beds 
of mauve and green andesites and dark bro\m basalt.

Some thirty miles north of Lillooet, MacKenzie 
(1920) correlated the French Bar Formation with the 
Coldwater Group. This formation consist of approximate¬ 
ly 2,000 feet of conglomerate and sandstone, the con¬ 
glomerate boulders having been derived mainly from 
detritus of the Coast range. 

KAMLOOPS VOLCANIC GROUP 

The uppermost beds of the interior Plateau in 
the Kamloops area are of relatively flat lying basic 
volcanic flows, probably two to three thousand feet 
thick. Rice (1945) describes these rocks as ”dark 
brown, mostly amygdaloidal, flat lying ’plateau^ basalt; 
and red, purple and grey »valley* basalt, commonly 
vescicular and flat lying." These basalts are rusty- 
red weathering, and present a most striking appearance. 

Cockfield (1944) reports v/hite to pale grey 
rhyolite in the Kicola area south of Kamloops Lake. 

The v/riter has observed similar rhyolite in volcanic 
beds to the east of Lillooet. These volcanic beds in 
the Kamloops area are considered by Rice (1945) to be 
of post-Oligocene age. Cockfield (1944) was of the 
opinion that most of the Tertiary volcanic rocks were 
probably of Oligocene age, but that some may be of

STRUCTURAL REIATIONSHIPS ALOM> FRASER RIFER 

ABSTRACT 

The Coast Range batholiths have intruded 
the Permian? sediments, and are in faulted contact 
with the Lower Cretaceous sediments# The gneissosity 
of these plutonic roclcs coincides with the regional 
strike of the Permian? rocks, and also with the general 
trend of the Coast Mountains, lA^ich is to the north¬ 
west# . /. 

Fraser Valley.occupies a line of faulting 
along the eastern flank of the coast Mountains# Both 
step-faulting and graben faulting are likely present 
along Fraser Valley.

In part, at least, the granodiorite intrus- 
ives were of the ’permissive* type. Along Cayoosh 
Creek near Lillooet the Chilliwack sediments are not 
generally highly contorted, the intrusives having gent¬ 
ly eased upward and penetrated along bedding planes, so 
that in places there is lit-par-lit injection. This 
relationship was also observed by Bowen (1912) near 
Agassiz, where granitic masses intrude cherty slates. 

He states, "these receive nimerous dykes and sills 
from the granite beneath, but preserve their regional 
strike and dip* In short, there is shorn the most 
absolutely convincing evidence of replacement, rather 
I than displacement, of the sediments by the invading 
magma." In the Coast Mountains, and in the adjacent 
stocks along Fraser Valley, there are numerous outliers 
and inclusions of presumably Chilliv/ack sediments. 

The sequence of the orogeny of the Coast 
I Range, and the folding of the Palaeozoic sediments 

I is open to argument. It is not certain whether the 

! 

Coast Range batholiths pushed up the overlying sedi¬ 
mentary rocks, or whether the folding of these rocks 
caused a release of pres\ire which allowed the magma to 
rise, perhaps both principles v/ere involved. At all

parallel relationship of the regional strike of the 
Palaeozoic sediments and the regional trend of the 
long axes of the hatholiths and related stocks.

Kanaka Batholith 

Structural Relationships 

The name Kanaka Batholith has been applied 
by the writer to a batholith of granodiorite at Kanaka 
Mountain. The batholith occupes a large part of the 
I Nicoamen Plateau to the east, and is an eastward ex¬ 
tension of the Coast Range batholiths, extending south¬ 
ward into the Coquihalla area. Along Fraser Valley 
this batholith is in faulted contact with the Lov/er 
Cretaceous sedimentary rocks. To this fault the v/riter 
has applied the name siska Creek Fault. 

From Thompson River to the southern edge of 
the Ashcroft Sheet, a distance of some fifteen miles, 
the vn?!ter recorded several attitudes of gneissosity 
along the western contact. These showed remarkably 
little deviation from a mean of approximately 3S5 
I degrees, which is the direction of the long axis of

the batholith or stock, and as pointed out previously, 
with the regional strike of the intruded Palaeozoic 
sediments was observed at several other places along 
Fraser Valley. Further, the dip of the flovj layers 
was approximately 50 degrees to the east at all local¬ 
ities where attitudes ?/ere measured. This again showed 
a marked accordance with the dip at several other lo¬ 
calities as far north as Lillooet. 

Siska Creek Fault 

The writer has so named this fault because 
of an excellent exposure he studied a^q^ Siska Creek 
which cuts at nearly a right angle across the fault# 
This fault marks the contact between Kanaka Batholith 
and the sedimentary Lower cretaceous beds# From just 
south of Lytton the fault can be traced intermittently 
to the southern edge of the Ashcroft Sheet. 

The idea of a faulted contact between the 
Coast Range intrusives and the Mesozoic sedimentary 
rocks along Fraser Valley is not a new one. Bowen 
(1912) referred to the contact between the intrusives 
and Cretaceous rocks near North Bend as follows, "close 
to the granites the attitude may be nearly, or quite 

vertical. The granite does not, however, give any 
evidence of being intrusive. The relation shown is due

The fault,as shown above,has a shear zone 
from 200 to 300 feet wide. The trace of the shear 
zone is indicated in the topography by a shallow 
hollow along the contact,caused no doubt by the 
fact that the sheared rock is more easily eroded 
than the harder rock on either side •

to the down faulting of the cretaceous beds*” Again, 
referring to the age of what he termed biotite granite 
intrusives he stated, ”lt is probably pre-cretaceous 
in age, although the only observed contact with the 
Cretaceous was a faulted one”. As a result of his 
structural studies along Fraser Valley from Lytton to 
Hope, Bowen postulated the idea of a graben structure 
for the Lower Cretaceous sedimentary beds. In his 1912 
report he states, on p.l08, ”the Fraser Valley from 
Lytton to North Bend follows a line of graben faulting.” 

Likewise, Camsell (1919) came to the same 

conclusion in commenting on the position of a patch 

of presumably Lower Cretaceous conglomerate near Hope. 

on 

This patch has previously been referred to/p.37. Cam- 
1 sell states, ”The position of this conglomerate can 
j only satisfactorily be explained by do’ym-faulting along 
j a north and south line, a line which was afterwards 

followed by the Fraser River in cutting out is valley”. 

The exposure at siska Creek indicates that 
here the fault is striking just west of north, and dip¬ 
ping steeply to the v/est. No alteration of the grano- 
diorite was evident; but the sedimentary beds adjacent 
to the fault zone are tilted at a high angle and general¬ 
ly smashed. The sediments show slickenside in several

directions. Some breccia is present, and considerable 
carbonaceous gouge, apparently derived from the crush¬ 
ing of argillite. Carbonatization is general in the 
sediments adjacent to the shear zone. The shear zone 
is apparently two to three hundred feet wide. No 
evidence could be obtained as to the amount of dis¬ 
placement, but it is probably in the order of thousands 
of feet* 

Botanie Batholith 

Structural Relationships 

The Botanie Batholith is a northward exten¬ 
sion of the Kanaka Batholith, and is defined from the 
confluence of the Kraser and Thompson Rivers, through 
Botanie Mountain to the southern end of Fountain Ridge, 
a distance of some twenty five miles. The nature of 
its contact v/ith the Lower Cretaceous? volcanics to 
the east is not definitely kno\m, but is probably 
faulted. North of Siwhe Creek the batholith is in 
faulted contact with Lower Cretaceous sediments along 
the east side of Fraser Valley. 

This batholith shows some differentiation 
from granodiorite to quartz-diorite and more mafic 
varieties. In this respect it differs from the Kanaka

Batholith which is largely granodiorite. Cache Creek 
inclusions and outliers, whereas infrequently found in 
the Kanaka Batholith, are nimerous and extensive in 
the Botanie Batholith. The gneissosity is in general 
accordance with that on the western edge of the Kanaka 
Batholith. 

Botanie creek Fault 

Along Botanie Valley, in a general north and 
south direction, there is a fault zone, marked at the 
mouth of Botanie Creek by an escarpment of diorite 
intruded by dykes and sills of pink pegmatite. The 
texture of this pegmatite is that of coarse granite. 

The attitude of this fault could not be determined; 
but minor faults in the main fault zone indicate a near- 

I 

j ly vertical dip. It is probable that this nearly vert- 

j ical attitude is not maintained to any great depth. 

I 

I The writer had an excellent opportunity to 

I study this fault zone along the railway cutting of the 
Canadian National Railway which follov^s the north bank 
of the Thompson River. Three sequences of intrusives 
were noted, the earliest being a moderately basic dio¬ 
rite, and lastly intruded by a pegmatite containing 

pink orthoclase. The fault zone is several himdred 
yards wide, and consists of numerous parallel faults. 









McGILLIVRAY CREEK SHEAR ZONE 


View looking eastward across Fraser 
Valley and the mouth of Cinquefoil Creek 
toward the Interior Plateau, The southern 
end of Fountain Ridge can be seen in the 
lower left corner. 

The granodiorite is probably in faulted 
contact with the argillaceous sediments, at 
the southern end of Fountain Ridge. Its con¬ 
tact with the Lov/er Cretaceous? volcanics is 
apparently faulted. A definite shear zone is 
indicated mid-way in the granodiorite stock 
itself. The stock has inclusions of phyllite 
and schist, probably from the Chilliwack Group. 

Note the.high, flat topped volcanic hills 
of the Interior Plateau, separated by deeply in¬ 
cised valleys. These hills are of nearly flat 
lying flows of basalt and andesite.

The escarpment is a very striking topographic feature, 
and Dawson (1894) was of the opinion that it was a 
fault scarp. 

McGillivray creek Fault 

The northern part of the Botanie Batholith 
has a marked fault zone extending from south of 
McGillivray Creek to the mouth of Cinquifoil Creek. 
This fault zone is characterized by intense shearing 
of the diorite, and consequent kaolinization? and 
mineralization. In this region, copper minerals in 
particular are found in shear zones in the plutonic 
rocks.

to be part of the Jackass Moimtain Group, overlying a 
sedimentary series which he also considered to be a 
correlative of the Dewdney Creek Group* He was of the 
opinion that an unconformity separated these two groups, 
near Lytton. 

At Jackass Mountain the writer measured a 
section which apparently indicates an unconformity bet¬ 
ween the Jackass Mountain Group and the underlying 
sediments (see Plate 8). Within, and above the con¬ 
glomerate zone the strata dipped from 30 to 45 degrees 
to the east; while below the conglomerate zone the dips 
varied from 65 to 75 degrees to the east. This evidence 
is by no means taken as conclusive. Lithologically the 
rocks are much the same both above and below the con¬ 
glomerate zone. The idea of an unconformity is possibly 
supported by the fact that all fossil fauna collected 
was in a horizon underlying the conglomerate zone; al¬ 
though numerous fragments of plant remains v/ere found 
above the conglomerate. Such evidence must, however, 
be taken with reserve, as pointed out by Tv^renhofel 
(1936). In referring to fossil evidence as indicative 
of an unconformity, he has this to say, "Changes in 
fauna and flora indicate changes in environment. Mere 

differences in species do not suffice, or even differ¬ 
ences in genera, since one may find these differences

I 

West of Kanalca Mountain the Lower Cretaceous 

sediments in Fraser Valley are faulted, probably form- ^ 

■i'i 

ing several fault blocks* Two major fault zones, ap- |i 
proximately four miles apart, were studied by the xvriter, 
To the enclosed area of rock he has applied the above 
name. This block is bounded on the east by the Siska i| 

Creek Fault, or its extension. The fault at the north 
strikes roughly northeast; while that at the south 
strikes to the south east. The western contact is also, 
presumably, the extension of a fault mapped by McTaggart 
(1946) on the west side of the Fraser Valley in the 
Lytton area. This fault block appears, then, to be 
completely bounded by faults, and may possibly be a 
graben.

Fountain Ridge extends from the mouth of

GIACIATICM 

GLACIAL STRIAE 

Dawson (1894) made ntonerous observations on 
the directions of glacial striae in the Kamloops, Lytton 
and Lillooet areas, and came to the conclusion that the 
general movement of the ice sheet was to the south-east* 
Dawson noted striae at 7,000 feet and concluded that the 
ice must have been in places over 6,000 feet thick. He 
W8S of the opinion that the Cordilleran region had ^ 
considerably higher level than it does today, and thought 
that subsidence coincided with the retreat of the ice. 

The writer observed many glacial striae on 
the ridges and hilltops to the east of Fraser Valley; 
and these all supported the idea of a south-easterly 
j movement of the ice sheet. Striae observed to the west 

I of Fraser Valley, in the Coast Mountains, v/ere by no

that although the continental ice sheet, probably 

j several thousand feet thick, moved in a south-easterly 

! direction across the Interior Plateau, it was bounded 

the 

on the west by the alpine glaciation of/Coast Mountains. 

As the trend of these mountains is to the south-east, 
the ice sheet apparently moved parallel to the Coast

FLWI0-GLACIAL DEPOSITS 

The Fraser River has, by rejuvenation, cut 
a deep and narrov; channel through the fluvio-glacial 
material in its valley. Along the slopes of Fraser 
Valley are numerous terraces. The writer made a good 
many measurements of altitude on a number of these 
terraces and found may to coincide at two and sometimes 
three distinct levels* These levels were generally 
at altitudes of from 1,000 feet to 1,500 feet, and are 
evidently river terraces. They have been cut from 
fluvio-glacial deposits of silt, sand and gravel, ^ich 
in late pleistocene time must have filled the valley. 

Horizontally stratified, buff colored silts, 
termed ’white silts’ by Dawson (1894), are prominent 
in the Fraser Valley near Pavilion. Here the Fraser 
River has cut a narrow gorge, some 200 feet deep, 
through these silts and the underlying glacial deposits 
of gravel. Dav/son assumed these silts to have been 
formed by a flooding of Fraser Valley follov/ing the 
subsidence of the land mass in late Pleistocene time. 
Presumably, Dawson meant a marine transgression, v/hich 
does not seem likely*

The writer has closely examined these silts 
and the associated glacial deposits of sand and gravel, 
and is of the opinion that the former are lake deposits, 
formed during a period when the Fraser Valley was temp¬ 
orarily dammed by ice and moraine material* These 
views will be further enlarged upon in Part 3*

aEOLOGICAL HISTORY AND REGIOHA.L TECTONICS 

PALAEOZOIC ERA 

In the area comprising Kamloops, Lytton, 

Hope, and Lillooet, no pre-Carboniferous, and probably 
no pre-permian, sedimentary beds have been found* 

For this reason it is considered that this portion of 
British Columbia must have been a land mass during 
the greater part of the Palaeozoic era. It is probable 
that Cascadia, as this land mass is named, existed 
as far back as Precambrian time, and persisted through¬ 
out the Palaeozoic era, contributing largely to the 
sedimentation in the Rocky Mountain geosyncline, and 
to basins in the present regions of Alaska and Yukon* 

During Upper Carboniferous time, or later, 
the land mass of Cascadia, which by this time had 
probably been worn down to a low lying peneplain, 
gradually subsided beneath the encroaching Vancouver 
sea which is presumed to have advanced from the 
west* In this sea v/ere deposited the sands, muds, 
and calcareous ooze which later formed the quartzites, 
phyllites, and crystalling limestone of the widespread 
Cache Creek series*

this time must have been a broad miosyncline. As the 
land mass being inundated was probably very low, it is 
natural that the clastic sediments would be fine grain¬ 
ed, in evidence, the coarsest sedimentary beds of the 
Cache Creek Series are sandstones and quartzites. 

These beds, although patchily distributed, are of wide 
extent throughout the western interior of British 
Columbia, extending, according to Crockford and Warren 
(1935), from the International Boundary northward into 
Alaska, From fossil evidence, such as the abundance 
of crinoid stems, corals and foraminiferae in the lime¬ 
stone beds it is probable that the Tancouver sea v/as 
v/arm, or moderately so. There Y/as some volcanic activ¬ 
ity during this period; and intercalated beds of ag¬ 
glomerate are found in the Cache creek Series, 

^fflSOZOIC ERA 

The end of the Palaeozoic era was marked 
by local uplift and deformation, as indicated by the 
unconformity between the Cache creek series and the 
overlying Nicola Group, According to Drysdale (1918) 
some coastal regions underwent continuous sedimenta¬ 
tion from Permian into Triassic time. The sediments 
of the Nicola Group, deposited during a submergence 
in Upper Triassic time, consist of sandstone, argillite

and limestone, probably indicating moderately low re¬ 
lief in the existing land mass. Continuous sedimenta¬ 
tion from Permian to Triassic time would also indicate 
that orogeny was moderate. As in the Permian period, 
volcanism contributed tuffaceous and agglomeratic beds 
to the basins of deposition. It is probable that vol¬ 
canism was continuous from Permian into Triassic time. 

As with the Permian beds, the sediments become less 
clastic and more calcareous in the upper part of the 
Nicola section, indicating a progressive transgression 
of the sea. The fauna similarly indicates a moderate¬ 
ly warm environment. 

At the end of the Triassic period the land 
again rose, and probably remained high during most of 
Lower Jurassic time. During Middle Jurassic time the 
land mass subsided, and locally at least, remained so 
into early Upper Jurassic time, as shov/n by the conform¬ 
able succession at Harrison Lah:e. Local orogeny in 
late Upper Jurassic time caused, in the Harrison Lake 
area, an unconformity between beds of this age and 
those of early Upper Jurassic time, 

Volcanism was prevalent during Middle and 
Upper Jurassic time. Thick beds of lavas, tuffs and 
agglomerates were intercalated in the sandy and muddy

sediments* Topographic relief during these times was 
probably moderate, the basins of sedimentation being 
shallow and brackish. The sea was probably cooler 
than in Triassic time, as corals and crinoids are not 
in evidence. 

During Upper Jurassic time the Jurassic 
Revolution is considered to have given rise to the 
initial stages of the Coast Mountains. Great batho- 
liths of diorite provided the source for the thick 
conglomerate beds of late Upper Jurassic age. it is 
probable that the seas v/ithdrev/ during this time, 
leaving linear basins of deposition into v/hich were 
quickly accumulated coarse gravel, sand and some mud. 

Local rising and falling of the land mass 
occurred from then on into Lower cretaceous time. 
Indeed, no sharp demarkation can at present be drav/n 
between beds of late Upper Jurassic and early Lower 
Cretaceous ages. The orogeny of the Coast Mountains 
probably continued into Lower cretaceous time, ac¬ 
companied by active volcanism. 

sedimentation during Lov/er Cretaceous time 
was rapid, and the elastics consequently coarse. Yol- 
canism was markedly active during late Lower Cretaceous 
time, contribufting largely to the spence Bridge vol-

-canic Group, It is probable that the Laramide Revolu¬ 
tion began at this time, giving rise in late Upper 
Cretaceous time to a height of land where the Rocky 
Mountains nov; stand, Sxich an orogeny would have caused 
a retrogression of the sea in the Kamloops-Lytton area, 
and probably over a much wider area, as indicated by 
the absence of sedimentary beds from Middle cretaceous 
to Upper Eocene time, 

CENOZOIC ERA 

The Laramide Revolution caused rapid denuda¬ 
tion of the land mass. Early Teriary sediments, of 
Eocene age, wererapidly accumulated in deltas and lake 
basins. The Puget Group was deposited in the delta of 
the ancestral Fraser River; while the coldwater Group 
of coarser elastics were laid dovm in lake basins erod¬ 
ed in the imderlying cretaceous rocks. Volcanic acti¬ 
vity continued through the Eocene epoch and at least 
o 

into Lower M^cene time. 

At the close of the Miocene epoch re-elevation 
of the land mass occurred, as indicated by an unconform¬ 
ity betv/een the Coldwater beds and the overlying beds 
of the Tranquille Group of early Lower Miocene age. 

Sedimentation during the Miocene epoch was apparently 
much the same as in Eocene time, the elastics being

generally coarse, though with some shale, and inter¬ 
calated beds of volcanic agglomerate. 

The close of early Lower Miocene time 
marked a great increase in volcanic activity; and dur¬ 
ing Lower Miocene time some 2000 feet or more of ba¬ 
saltic and andesitic lava flows and agglomeratic beds 
were laid dovm in depressions of the oligocene eros¬ 
ion surface. These volcanics are represented by the 
Kamloops Volcanic Group, 

Possibly ih Middle Miocene time further 
warping produced broad end shallow synclinal and anti¬ 
clinal folding in the Ka-mloops Volcanic Group. This 
was accompanied by minor igneous intrusions and extru¬ 
sions, and was follo^ved by a long period of erosion, 
p robably extending into and throughout the pliocene 
epoch. During this time the land mass was worn down 
to a peneplain, the evidence of which is now seen in 
the flat topped hills of the Interior Plateau, Further 
regional uplift may have taken place at the close of 
the Pliocene epoch, and it is probable that consider¬ 
able faulting occurred at this time on the eastern 
flank of the Coast Mountains, along the present course 
of the Fraser River, This uplift of the Interior 
Plateau caused a marked rejuvenation of the major

streams and rivers. The rivers became entrenched in 
the canyon-like conrses we see today along the Fraser 
and Thompson Rivers. 

At the close of the pliocene epoch the topo¬ 
graphy of the Kamioops-Lytton area was probably much 
the same as it is today. During Pleistocene time 
the region became cold; and the Cordilleran ice sheet 
spread over the whole of British Columbia. When the 
glaciers retreated they left much fluvioglacial materi 
al in the old stream valleys. New streams followed 
these old river channels and cut deeply into this gla¬ 
cial material indicating further regional uplift. 

This uplift may still be in progress, as the writer 
saw evidence of recent land slides along the trace of 
the Siska Creek Fault.

ABSTRACT 

At the present time this area is of slight 
importance to the mining industry. Placer gold has in 
the past yielded more value than other minerals, and 
will likely continue to do so. Placer mining is today 
carried out on a small scale. 

Large deposits of coal and lignite occur in 
the Hat creek district but are of too low a grade to 
at present attract investment. Deposits of epsomite 

i and sodium carbonate near Spences Bridge are small, and 

j 

j are intermittently worked. 

i 

I 

I Some gold prospects have yielded fair assays; 

i and it is probable that development work will be carried 
out along Cayoosh creek in particular. It is of interest 
to note that these gold prospects are confined to the 

I Permian? phyllite and schist. Several occurrences of 

i 

copper minerals have been foimd in shear zones in the 
batholith intrusions of granodiorite. so far these are 
of no importance, though good deposits may be found in 
the future. Some deposits of stibnite and molybdenite 
have been found in the gold bearing Permian? rocks, but 
nothing of commercial value.

PLACER DEPOSITS 
Gold 

In 1857 placer gold was discovered in the 
gravel bars of the Fraser and Thompson Rivers. This 
discovery precipitated a rush for gold in the area, and 
resulted in the discovery of many rich deposits. The 
following year gold was discovered in the gravels of 

i 

Bridge River. Curiously enough, it was not until 1886 
that gold was found in Cayoosh Creek, west of Lillooet. 
During these early years the most systematic mining 
seems to have been done by the Chinese. In Cayoosh 
Creek, during the period 1886-90 the Chinese mined gold 
j to the value of more than |?150,000 according to Dawson 
(1894). On Bridge River, in 1886, a dozen Chinese are 
reported to have earned |66,000. 

Since then placer mining has been carried on 
steadily, though in varying degrees. During the years 
I of depression following 19S9 placer mining received an 

i 

impetus, due no doubt to the lack of other work, to the 
encouragement offered placer miners by the British 
Columbia chamber of Mines, and to the increased market 
value of gold. In the past few years placer mining has 
received very desultory attention, interest seems to

scale* 


Along the Fraser and Thompson Rivers placer 
mining is confined, for the most part to the working 
of gravel and sand bars and low benches a few feet above 
v/ater level. In only a few places have the higher bench 
gravels been mined, because of the excessive amount of 
overburden, and the lack of water* Washing methods 
commonly employ various styles of sluice boxes, with 
some rockers being used. The gold varies in sige from 
very fine dust to small flakes of a few cents each in 
value. Coarser gold is not often found. 

Along Cayoosh creek, a swiftly flowing moun¬ 
tain stream, placer mining is being carried out along 
a stretch from tYJo to five miles above the confluence 
of Seton and Cayoosh Creeks. Coarse gold is taken from 
gravels in the stream bed. Bars are rained at low water, 

and the creek bottom itself where the water can be di- 

i 

j verted. 

I 

i 

j The source of gold in Cayoosh Creek is most 

i 

j probably the auriferous Permian? phyllite and schist 
through which the creek flows. Rough pieces of gold 
with adhering fragments of quartz have been mined from 

the gravels. The sources of placer gold in the Fraser 
and Thompson Rivers are not known for certain. Dawson

gold 

About twelve miles south of Ashcroft, on the 
west side of the Thompson River, a property previously 
ovmed by Martel Gold Mines, Ltd. was intermittently work¬ 
ed between the years 1934- 39. A total of 1,035 feet 
of drifting, cross cutting and sinking was done, accord¬ 
ing to Dtiffell (1946). Values in gold v/ere found in 
lenticular quartz veins in folded slates of Peimian? 
age. 

In the south west corner of the Ashcroft 
Sheet, near Pyramid Mountain, about twelve miles south 
west of Lytton, gold -^ues are reported by McTaggart 
(1946). These occur in quartz veins v/hich are often 
parallel to the schistosity of the Permian? phyllite 
and schist which constitutes most of the country rock. 
This area is accessible only by means of rough trails; 
and developement v/ork has consequently been negligible.

west of Lillooet, along Cayoosh creek, a good 
deal of prospecting has been carried out in lenticular I 
quartz veins in the folded schists of Permian? age. 

Coarse gold has been found about eight miles up the j| 

creek from Lillooet; but as yet only a few feet of 
tunnelling has been done. 

Copper 

Some 25 miles south east of Ashcroft, in a 
batholith of granodiorite, the 0*K. Mine and Kathleen 
Claim are situated. During the years 1914-18 some 
10,000 tons of ore were mined from the former location 
(Duffell, 1946). This ore occurred in a fault zone in 
the granodiorite. The minerals, mostly chalcopyrite 
with some chalcocite were in a gangue of quartz, assoc¬ 
iated with much sericitized v/all rock. The granodiorite 
i 

I is considered to be Jurassic or later in age. | 


Between Laluwissin and McGillivray Creeks, 
on the east side of Fraser River, about 20 miles north 
of Lytton, the v/riter noted a very minor deposit of 
chalcocite in a shear zone in the granodiorite batho¬ 
lith. This chalcocite is associated v/ith quartz in a ' 
rusty, v/eathered zone. Tunnelling and open cutting 
have been carried out only to the extent of a fev/ feet. 
No chalcopyrite has been found.

MolybdeniJEi 

Some molybdenite was mined by the Martel 
Gold Mines, Ltd., but not in sufficient quantity to be 
marketable. No other deposits have been found. 

Antimony 

In the south west corner of the Ashcroft 
Sheet, near Skihist Mountain, stibnite occurs with 
quartz in a shear zone. This shear zone is more or 
less parallel with the contact between Jurassic phyl- 
lite and intrusive granodiorite. No developement work 
has been done, probably because of the relative inac¬ 
cessibility of the location. 

I Iron 

I On the west side of Thompson River, near its 

j confluence with Nicola River, a deposit of hematite 
occurs in a shear zone cutting a batholith of grano¬ 
diorite. The hematiteis in the form of stringers and

as the matrix in a fault breccia. Very little develope¬ 
ment work has been done; and it is doubtful if the de¬ 
posit is of canmercial value.

wide area but are, according to MacKay (1925), of poor 
quality. The deposits are easily accessible by road;

STRATIGRAHIY 


PREVIOUS V/ORK 

No previous detailed study has been made of 
Fountain Ridge. Dr. G. M. Dawson during the years 
1877-94 made reconnaissance surveys in the Kamloops 
area and came to some general, though astute conclusions 
as to the stratigraphy and structure of Fountain Ridge. 
Dawson (1894) in referring to the Lillooet area stated, 
"if a complete section could be reconstructed, the 
Cretaceous rocks v/ould be found to possess in the aggre¬ 
gate a volume approaching 10,000 feet". The writer 
estimated over 7,000 feet of sediments in Fountain 
Ridge. 

Extending north-west from Fountain Ridge to 
Chilko Lake the belt of Lower Cretaceous rocks widens 
considerably, and several persons have studied these 
rocks, notably along Bridge River. 

Some seventy-five miles north west of Lilloo¬ 
et, Bateman (1912) describes 15,000 to 20,000 feet of 
sediments conformably underlain by at least 10,000 feet 
of volcanics. These beds he believed to be of Lower 
Cretaceous age. The lower section consists of por- 
phyritic andesite, breccia and tuff; the upper section

of conglomerate, arkose, laminated argillites and silt- 
stone, and some limestone. From the upper beds of the 
upper section Bateman collected the following fossils: 


Aucella crassicollis (Keyserling) 

Aucella piochli (Gabb) 

Aucella pallasi (Keyserling) 

Belemnites impressus (Gabb) 

I’erebrat'ula sp, 

Bateman believed this fauna to have affinities v/ith 
that of the Shasta series in California. Bateman’s 
section for the upper series above the volcanics is as 
follows: 


Several thousand feet of alternate beds of 
dense, black argillite and greenish arkose, with 
a few thin beds of crystalline limestone in the 
argillites. 


Dense, grey to black argillite with some sandy 
beds and intercalated andesite flows 


Massive beds of indurated, greenish-grey arkose 
composed of angular fragments of quartz and 
feldspar 


Conglomerate of well roimded pebbles of cherty 
quartzite and andesite in a matrix of quartz 
and feldspar fragments, app. 500 feet thick 


Bateman (1912)^ describes identically the 
same section in the vicinity of Eldorado Creek north¬ 
west of Lillooet. Here he collected the following 
fossils, as identified by Dr. T. W* Stanton:

zie (1920) has described the Eldorado series as consist¬ 
ing of more than 10,000 feet of conglomerate, sandstone, 
shale and some limestone. He believed this series to 
be of Lower Cretaceous, age and to lie conformably on 
the Cadwallader Series of Jurassic age. The Cadwallader 
Series comprises a great thickness of metamorphosed 
sedimentary and volcanic rocks. 

MacKenzie collected the following fossils 
from the uppermost section of the Eldorado series at 
spruce Lake: 

Aucella crassicollis (Keyserling) 

Belemnites sp. 

Ammonites

Dolmage (19S4) found in the vicinity of 
Chillco Lake, some eighty miles north v/est of Lillooet, 
a series of beds of conglomerate, arkose and shale 
v/hich he correlated with the Eldorado series on Bridge 
River. In these beds he found Aucella crassicollis . 

The Eldorado Series is possibly a correlative 
of the strata described by Bateman (1912). 

Cairnes (1937) describes the Hurley Formation 
on Bridge River as consisting of banded calcareous, 
argillaceous and tuffaceous sediments. He considered 
this formation to be a correlative of the Eldorado 
Series, of Lower Cretaceous and possibly, in part, of 
Upper Jurassic age. From the Hurley Formation he col¬ 
lected abvindant crinoid stems, a few molluscs, bryozoa, 

I algae (possibly of the genus Pachytheca ) and several 
i varieties of gastropods.

I Dawson (1894) in referring to the rocks of 

Fountain Ridge said, »»it may be stated that the black¬ 
ish sandstones, quartzites and argillites form the mass 
of the lower part of the formation, while the greenish 
and grey sandstones and quartzites, with the conglomer¬ 
ates, characterize its upper parts^’. In this general 
observation Dawson was correct. The v/riter has given 
the name Lillooet Formation to this lower section, and

the name Fountain Ridge Formation to the upper section. 
With regards to the thickness of the section exposed at 
Fountain Ridge, Dav/son (1894) stated ”it must exceed 
7,000 feet, while it is very probable 10,000 feet or 
more^.. 

FOSSIL LOCALITIES 

Fl-The fossils v/ere obtained from massive 

beds of laminated, bluish-grey arkose and siltstone 
underlying by a few hundred feet the Jackass Mountain 
conglomerate. 

F2 - The fossils were obtained from a lense 

of coquina, one foot thick, in a bed of dark grey silt- 
stone. This siltstone is interbedded with a greenish- 
grey arkose containing several bands, 6 inches to 2 feet 
in thickness, of a pebble conglomerate. The pebbles 
vary from 1/4 inch to 1 inch in diameter, and are mainly 
of quartzite. 

F3 —- The fossil was obtained from a massive 
bed of rusty, bluish siltstone. The bed has been 
markedly sheared. 

P4 — This fossil apparently came from 

massive beds of argillite and siltstone which underlie, 
by a few hundred feet, the beds at Fl#

F5, 6 - The fossils were obtained from a 
lense of coquina, a foot and less in thickness, in a 
bed of dark grey argillite. This argillite is inter- 
bedded with siltstone and minor beds of arkose. These 
beds are intruded by dykes and sills of diorite (see 
Slide #30). 

] 5»7 -— These fossils were obtained from a 
bed of siltstone, several feet thick, interbedded with 
arkose. Approximately 100 feet stratigraphically above 
this fossil zone is a lense of conglomerate in the 
arkose. The pebbles, averaging less than an inch in 
diameter, are of quartzite and igneous rook. 

P8 -— These fossils were obtained from a 
boulder of thinly laminated siltstone and argillite, 
presumably from adjacent highly folded beds of lamin¬ 
ated argillite, siltstone and sandstone. These beds 
are intruded by dykes and sills of diorite. 

F9 - These fossils were obtained from a 

bed of laminated argillite and siltstone, interbedded 
v/ith arkose. Approximately 100 feet stratigraphically 
above this fossil zone plant remains were found in a 
bed of arkose.

LILLOOET FOmiA-TION 

This formation was named by the writer. It 
consists of massive beds, commonly tuffaceous, of argil¬ 
lites and slates, laminated argillite and siltstone, 
minor arkose and graywacke, with intercalated beds of 
argillaceous and arkosic tuffs. The beds are generally 
steeply folded, and in places show drag folds and over¬ 
turning, Where they outcrop along the faulted contact 
with the Palaeozoics the beds are highly folded and 
partly mashed. It is doubtful that this marked folding is 
entirely caused by faiilting, as the beds appear to be 
just as highly folded where they outcrop along the Fraser 
River Bend, Probably an unconformity exists betv/een 
this formation and the overlying Fountain Ridge Forma¬ 
tion; and the more highly folded nature of the beds in 
the Lillooet Formation can therefore be attributed to 
their older age. However, it is to be expected that 
argillaceous beds will more readily fold than will aren¬ 
aceous beds; so that the beds of the Lillooet Formation 
may not have been subj'ected to any more stress than 
those of the Foimtain Ridge Formation, 

In some localities where laminated siltstone 
and argillite occur, the laminae are highly crumpled, 
evidently from stress applied prior to consolidation,

and possibly during compaction of the sediments* It is 
likely that the sediments were laid down as near-shore 
deposits in deep troughs, under such conditions crump¬ 
ling could be caused by slumping of the sediments. The 
only other explanations would seem to be some erogenic 
stress, or the pressure resulting from the intrusion of 
a magma into adjacent beds, prior to their consolidation. 
No evidence of intrusion was seen. 

Most fossils were collected in a zone immedi¬ 
ately underlying the Fountain Ridge Formation. 

FOUNTAIN RIDGE FORMATION 

This formation was named by the writer. It 
probably rests unconformably on the Lillooet Formation. 
This unconformity is by no means obvious, and may be in 
the nature of a disconformity in some places. The form¬ 
ation consists of much more arenaceous material than 
the underlying Lillooet Formation. The basal member is 
usually a lens shaped bed of conglomerate, plus or minus 
300 feet thick, which has been found to rest, apparent¬ 
ly unconformably, on beds of argillite, arkose and tuff, 
depending upon the locality. The basal member is not 
always conglomerate, but in places is a massive bed of 
arkose. This is to be expected, as the conglomerate 
appears to grade laterally into arkose. Twenhofel

(1936) states, ^any clastic deposit may be expected to 
grade laterally into another clastic deposit of some 
other degree of texture, or into a deposit of different 
lithology”• On this basis of reasoning only a general¬ 
ized section of Fountain Ridge is here presented; for 
there are numerous minor differences in the succession 
at various parts of the ridge. 

Above this conglomerate zone the beds con¬ 
sist mainly of massive arkose and grayv/acke, with minor 
interbedded siltstone and argillite. Some 2,000 feet 
stratigraphically above the basal conglomerate zone is 
another conglomerate zone, the lenses of v/hich vary 
from 10 feet to 30 feet in thickness. In other beds 
of arkose are several smaller conglomerate ^ones, 
varying in thickness from a fev/ inches to two or three 
feet. 


Where the basal conglomerate zone is some 
300 feet thick it has a marked lithological resembl¬ 
ance to the Jackass Mountain conglomerate. The cobbles, 
averaging three to four inches in diameter are of 
leucocratic diorite and quartzite, with some cobbles 
of volcanic rocks, in a matrix of arkose. The other 
conglomerate zones are lithologically much the same. 

The uppermost bed of the Fountain Ridge Formation is

of very coarsearkose, or gritstone, which appears to 
grade laterally into another minor conglomerate zone. 

The interpretation of an imconformity bet¬ 
ween the Lillooet and Fountain Ridge Formations is 
admittedly based on inconclusive evidence, which is 
presented as follows 

1. Although in several localities numerous 
dykes and sills of diorite, feldspar porphyry and 
aplite intrude the Lillooet Formation, no intrusions 
into or above the basal conglomerate zone of the 
Foimtain Ridge Formation v/ere observed. 

2. Along the west side of Fountain Ridge, 
at the base, there extends a sill-like intrusion of 
diorite. In one locality the basal conglomerate zone 
appears to lie directly on this sill. 

3. The conglomerate zone was found to be 
directly underlain by argillite in some localities, 
and by arkose in others. It is possible for arkose 
beds to grade laterally into argillite. However in 
one instance this variation occurred within a distance 
of half a mile, and the field relationships suggested 
that the conglomerate was unconformably overlying two 
lithologically distinct beds.

4. The beds of the Lillooet Formation are 
generally much more highly folded than those of the 
Fountain Ridge Formation, 

5# Although the interpretation is open to 
argument, it is probable that a bed of conglomerate 
300 feet thick is more likely to be interformational 
than intraformational* 

6, As indicated by lithological similarity, 
this basal conglomerate zone may coincide with that 
of the Jackass Mountain Group, The writer measured a 
section on Jackass Mountain which apparently indicated 
(see Plate 8) an unconformity at the base of the 
Jackass Mountain Group, It is suggested that a similar 
unconformity, though apparently not of the same magni¬ 
tude, may exist at the base of the Fountain Ridge Form¬ 
ation. This interpretation is based on the premise 
that the Foimtain Ridge Formation and the lov/er part 
of the Jackass Mountain Group are of the same age. 

Fossil fauna and flora indicate a Barremian age for 
the Lillooet Formation and an Aptian age for the Jackass 
Mountain Group. It is suggested that the Fountain 
Ridge Formation may also be of Aptian age.

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 

Fossil collections from localities both 
above and below the base of the Foimtain Ridge Forma¬ 
tion indicate a Lower Cretaceous age for these beds* 
Most fossil localities are in a zone just underlying 
the basal conglomerate of the Foimtain Ridge Formation, 
certain of these fossils indicate the beds to be 
possibly of Barremian age. The fossils from Fl8 were 
taken from beds presimiably equivalent to those of the 
lowermost part of the Lillooet Formation as they are 
underlain by granodiorite, and beds of the Chilliwack 
Group. These indicate an age, according to Dr. F* H. 
McLeam, "probably quite early Lower Cretaceous". Of 
the fossils from the Fountain Ridge Formation, no 
precise age is indicated, other than Lower Cretaceous. 
If, however, the Fountain Ridge Formation is of the 
same age as the lower part of the Jackass Mountain 
Group, it is then probably of Aptian age. It is prob¬ 
able that if an unconformity exists between the 
Lillooet and Foimtain Ridge Formations it possibly re¬ 
presents a period of time during the transition from 
Barremain to Aptian time. 

One fact may not be in accord with this idea, 
and that is the crystalline nature of the igneous in-

-trusives in the Lillooet Formation. Intrusives of 
aplite were foiond; hut many dykes and sills are of 
fairly coarse diorite, which may indicate that intru¬ 
sion took place at a depth of 5,000 feet or more. In 
order for the interpretation of an unconformity to be 
tenable it is necessary to postulate the erosion of 
some 5,000 feet of sediments during a period inclusive 
of Barremian and Albian time, and possibly between 
the Barremian and Aptian stages. However, as the 
Lower Cretaceous occupied a period of possibly 
20,000,000 years, and as the area was probably under¬ 
going orogeny, the hypothesis is not untenable. 
Furthermore, it is probable that the coarseness of a 
crystalline rock is not entirely a function of depth; 
and therefore intrusion may have occurred at much less 
than a depth of 5,000 feet. 

Bateman (1912) described a section of what . 
he believed to be Lower cretaceous sedimentary rocks, 
some seventy-five miles north-west of Lillooet. The 
basal member v/as a conglomerate, approximately 500 
feet thick. This conglomerate may be a correlative of 
the conglomerate zone at the base of the Fountain 
Ridge Formation. These conglomerate zones may indicate 
a marked acceleration of the orogeny, possibly toward 
the end of Barremian time. It is of interest to note.

in this connection, that Anderson (1938) in referring 
to a conglomerate member at the base of the Horsetown 
Group in California states, ”In middle Lower Cretaceous 
time, at the beginning of the Horsetown Group epoch, 
an uplift occurred in California and Oregon, and poss¬ 
ibly along the entire West coast, including Alaska”. 

The basal section of the Horsetown Group is of Hauter- 
ivian age. if Anderson*s assumption is correct, there 
is reason to think that a similar uplift may have re¬ 
sulted in the formation of the conglomerate zones near 
L 3 rbton, Lillooet and Chilko Lake, in general, the 
fauna from these latter localities indicates a correla¬ 
tion with that of the Shasta Series, The Foxmtain 
Ridge Formation, Lillooet Formation, and the jackass 
Mountain Group may be equivalent in age to the Horse- 
tGvm Group. 

A study of thin sections made of clastic 
rocks taken from various horizons of the Lower creta¬ 
ceous succession indicate, by the angularity and poor 
sorting of the fragments, a rapid accumulation of 
sediments. The land mass, during Lower Cretaceous 
time, probably had considerable relief. The sediments 
may have been deposited in irregular and deep troughs, 
or may have formed an alluvial plain. Twenhofel (1936) 
states, ”Wedge shaped lenses of gravel, several

himdred feet thick, can be built up in deep off-shore 
depressions”• The conglomerates at the base of the 
Fountain Ridge Formation may have formed in this manner. 

During the greater part of the time, massive 
beds of sand and mud were deposited, most probable in 
deep troughs. The crumpled laminae before mentioned 
were probably caused by slumping of the sediments along 
the steep gradient of the trough. Twenhofel (1956) 
further states, "Deposits are fimctions of the supply 
and of the depths of the waters, the sediments having 
wider distribution and lesser thickness the less deep 
the waters, and less distribution and greater thickness 
the deeper the waters”. The beds of Foimtain Ridge 
may be of this latter type. Although an attempt has 
been made to correlate them in a general way, individu¬ 
al members cannot be traced laterally for very far. 

The association of plant remains with the marine fauna 
indicate that the deposits v/ere laid down very close 
to shore. Petrographic studies of Fountain Ridge 
indicate that the rocks supplying the detritus in Lower 
Cretaceous Time, were igneous, volcanic and sediment¬ 
ary. 

It is probable that the land mass which sup¬ 
plied this detritus lay not far to the vjest. phemister

(1945) states, ”No Lov/er Cretaceous sediments are 

exposed in the vicinity of Vancouver-nor do 

any beds of this age appear to have formed, since the 
Upper Cretaceous strata rest directl^^” on the Jurassic 
rocks". This would indicate that the Vancouver area 
during Lower Cretaceous time was high; and it seems 
very likely that the erosion of this land mass, which 
probably extended northvmrd, formed thick deposits 
in a deep trough along its eastern shore.

STRUCTURE 

PREVIOUS WORK 

The only previous work on Fountain Ridge v;as 
done by G. M* Dawson (1894). Here again, Dawson made 
some veiy astute observations, although he states that 
along the Big Bend of the Fraser River, although both 
sides of this part of the river have nov7 been examined, 
the irregularities found are such that no really satis¬ 
factory general section has been obtained”. Dawson 
says, however, ”The general structure of Fountain Ridge 
is that of a syncline, which appears to be simple in 
its southern part, but becomes wider and more irregular 
and complicated to the north”• In this observation 
Dawson was correct. 

Since Da\¥son» s reconnaissance surveys no work 
at all has been carried out in the immediate vicinity of 
Lillooet.

of the Big Bend and continues in a north-westerly di¬ 
rection across the Camelsfoot Mountains. 

The fault is not exposed in Foimtain Valley; 
but is v/ell exposed along the banks of the Fraser 
River, where the Lower Cretaceous sedimentary beds, 
and the volcanics with which they are in faulted con¬ 
tact, are highly folded and smashed. Nowhere, however, 
did the vrriter see any distinct contact betv/een the 
sedimentary and volcanic beds, the fault being marked 
by a zone of sheared and altered rocks. Dawson (1894) 
states, ^^To the east of Fountain Creek, Cretaceous 

rocks, generally sandstones - are not only much 

shattered and reddened, but also as a rule highly 

silicified; and in consequence - no precise line 

I was discovered between them and the distinctly volcanic 
rocks- 

As will be observed from Map No. 1 (Geologi- 
j cal Map of Lillooet Area, B.C.) the fault comes to the 

i 

surface at more or less the same elevation along the 
Fountain Valley; so that its dip cannot be determined 
here. Even where the fault crosses Fraser River, its 
trace at the surface falling some 1500 feet, there was 

I 

I no evidence of a dip either to the east or west. It is

apparent that the fault has a very steep dip, possibly 
of approximately 80 degrees to the east. It is probable 
that this dip decreases at depth, as illustrated in 
PLATE 12. 


The interpretation of a dip to the east was 
based partly on the dip of the Lillooet Fault, which 
v;as reasonably accurately measured as 40 to 45 degrees 
to the east, and partly on the relationship of the 
volcanics to the east. Dawson, in his 1877 report 
supposed these volcanics to constitute an underlying 
part of the Cretaceous sedimentary beds of Fountain 
Ridge. In his 1894 report he believed them to overly 
the sedimentary beds, as he states, ”A more detailed 
examination of the region, in the light of further 
studies of the formations elsewhere, has since afforded 
grounds for reversing this opinion”. Duffell (1946) 
has mapped volcanics in the Spence Bridge area, extend¬ 
ing north-v/esterly toward Hat creek, which he believes 
to be of Cretaceous age, and probably belonging to the 
Aptian stage, 5 ^ as fossils from sandstone beds in these 
volcanics indicate such an age. The volcanics east of 
Fountain Ridge probably form a continuous series with 
those at Spence Bridge, with the possible inclusion of 
some*Tertiary volcanics. The volcanic beds in faulted

contact v/ith the granodiorite, in the McGillivray 
Creek shear zone, form identically the same section as 
found to the east near Spence Bridge. At the former 
location a greenish agglomerate, possibly two or three 
hundred feet in thickness, is underlain by granodiorite, 
and overlain by thirty feet of conglomerate and sand¬ 
stone. These sediments are conformably overlain by 
600 or more feet of basalt, which is columnar in the 
lower section. 

This fault probably is a shear zone of nim- 
erous parallel fault planes, having a total width of 
possibly 1000 feet. 

LILLOOET FAULT 

The Lillooet Fault, which similar to the 
Foimtain Valley Fault possibly consists of numerous 
parallel fault planes, passes just to the west of 
Lillooet, and continues southward along Fraser River. 

To the north of Lillooet the fault passes through a 
sharp rise in land (see Map Ho. 1), thus affording 
a means of determining its angle of dip. This v/as 
estimated to be 40 to 45 degrees to the east. The 
fault continues in a north-westerly direction along 
Bridge River.

PLATE 14

The contact between the Lower Cretaceous 
argillaceous rocks and the Permian? phyllite, schists, 
and greenstones is usually well defined, on the creta¬ 
ceous side the rocks are highly folded, overturned folds 
and drag folds being commonly observed in the argilla¬ 
ceous rocks; while the arenaceous rocks are generally 
smashed and weathered to a reddish color. The Permian? 
side of the contact is well marked by a serpentinized 

zone which is particularly conspicuous to the south of 

1 

Lillooet. This serpentine has evidently been derived 
from the shearing and hydrothermal alteration of green¬ 
stones which were probably basic volcanics. Bateman 
(1912)^ refers to several hundred feet of andesitic 
tuffs and breccias, chloritic and serpentinized rocks 
v/hich he believed to be of Cache creek age, as occurr¬ 
ing north-west of Lillooet along Bridge River. These 
probably belong to the series here called the Chilliwack 

Group. At Texas Creek, some twelve miles to the south 

I 

I of Lillooet, an excellent example of a fault breccia 
is to be seen. This breccia is composed of angular 
fragments of Cretaceous sandstone in a limonitic matrix.

tion, however, is in many localities cut by dykes, and 
more commonly sills, of diorite, feldspar porphyry and 
aplite. Dykes and sills, of apparently the same com¬ 
position intrude the Chilliwack Group. It is not knov/n, 
however, whether the intrusives in the cretaceous rocks 
are of the same age as those in the Permian? rocks; 
but it is presumed that in part, at least, they are. 

The intrusives in the Chilliwack Group are partly of 
the permissive type, as indicated by the gently folded 
beds of the Chilliwack Group along Cayoosh creek, and 
by the lit-par-lit injection into them. In other local¬ 
ities the chilliv/ack beds are highly folded and crumpled, 
It was not possible to determine whether this folding 
took place during, or prior to the period of intrusion. 

The age of these intrusives, into the Lower 
Cretaceous beds at least, is considered to be Lower 
Cretaceous, on the grounds of a probable unconformity 
I existing between them and the overlying Lov/er Cretaceous 
I beds. These intrusives are tentatively, correlated, 
on lithological evidence in the field only, with those 
intruding the chilliv/ack Group in the Lillooet area. 

This correlation is by no means certain; nor are the 
relationships knovn of these intrusives to the coast 

Range igneous bodies. In this respect, Phemister (1945) 
stated, ”0n both Vancouver Island and the Queen Char-

-lotte Islands stocks, similar petrographically to the 
Coast Range bodies, occur cutting rocks of knoTO age, 
but there must alv;ays remain a certain element of doubt 
as to whether or not these bodies are really contempor¬ 
aneous with the main batholith”• 

Measurements of the gneissosity on large 
intrusive bodies along Fraser Valley indicate a very 
steep dip to the east. This seems to be a regional 
trend. 

OENERAL CONCLUSIOTS 

Structurally, Fountain Ridge is S 3 rnclinal. 

The southern part forms a simple syncline; the central 
part has three smaller synclines; sjid the northern part 
has two well defined synclines. North of the Big Bend 
of the Fraser River the structure becomes flatter, 
with possibly several shallov/ sjnticlines. The pitch of 
these synclinal axes is apparently very slight. It was 
not possible to make any measurements, but on the basis 
of the generalized cross sections, the plunges are 
estimated at approximately two degrees. The main 
syncline plunges to the south; although minor folds 
apparently plunge to the north.

The main synclinal axis cuts midv/ay across 
the Big Bend, and here the synclinal structure is 
clearly seen. Outcrops along the river are generally 
flat lying; and it is evident that the trough of the 
syncline, in this locality, is broad and undulating. 

The exact nature of the eastern flank of the syncline, 
near the mouth of Fountain Creek, is not knovm. Some 
minor, though steep folding was seen; and it is likely 
that faulting complicates the structure in the vicinity 
of the contact with the volcanics. To the south, this 
syncline forms the main structural feature of Fountain 
Ridge. 

Near the confluence of Bridge and Fraser 
Rivers there is an excellent synclinal exposure, the 
fold in this locality being very tight. It was not 
possible to trace this fold for any distance along 
Bridge River, although to the south the fold is fairly 
well defined for six or seven miles. It vms generally 
observed that folds could be traced across country 
by the presence of reddish ?/eathering zones. These 
reddisli zones, in all cases, were in arenaceous beds. 

It was noted that whereas the argillaceous rocks folded 
under stress, the interbedded arenacous rocks, being 

more competent, were smashed and sheared. Caution is 
needed, however, in using reddish zones to trace folds.

as shear zones are also marked by reddish weathered 
rocks. 


It must be emphasized that the geological 
map (Map No, 1) and the sections A-B to S-T inclusive 
are generalized. The reconnaissance nature of the 
field work precluded any more detailed study of the 
structure. It is probable that the structure of Foun¬ 
tain Ridge is further complicated by minor shear zones. 

The Lower Cretaceous? volcanics to the east 
of Fountain Ridge are in general gently folded to near¬ 
ly flat lying. The Lower cretaceous sedimentary rocks 
to the north of Fountain Ridge become gently folded 
in the area of the Camelsfoot Mountains, The Permian? 
rocks to the west of Fountain Ridge are in general 

I 

highly folded. 

On the assumption that the volcanics overlie 
j the lower Cretaceous sedimentary beds, and on the 

evidence of a dip to the east for the Lillooet Fault, 
step faulting (see Plate 12) has been postulated to 
ezplain the structural relationship of Fountain Ridge. 
Wedges of Lower Cretaceous rocks are found continuously 
along Fraser Valley (see Map 408A) where they have prob¬ 
ably been relatively preserved from erosion. In some 
localities these wedges appear to be grabens; while

GEOMORHIOLOGY 

FLWIO-<>LACIAL DEPOSITS 

Fluvio-glacial deposits in Fraser Valley are 
of silts, sand and gravel, in general, the silts over- 
lie the sand and gravel deposits. 

Along Fraser Valley the gravel and sand 
deposits form moraines. There are also alluvial fans 
v/hich consist largely of houlder clay material, appar¬ 
ently derived from glacial deposits. These alluvial 
fans are not of recent origin, as present streams are 
deeply entrenched in them (see Plate 14). It is sug¬ 
gested that they were formed at the close of the glaci¬ 
al period when there must have been a considerable 
’rim off’ from melting snow and ice. similar material 
was observed, notably in McGillivray creek valley, 
literally choking the valleys adjoining Fraser Valley, 
and deeply incised by present streams. 

Some deposits of sand and gravel were evi¬ 
dently laid doivn in bodies of water, and probably at 
steep gradients, as they show folding and faulting 
v/hich was probably caused by slumping of these sedi¬ 
ments. This folding and faulting is plainly seen just 
north of Lillooet along the cutting of the Pacific

Great Eastern Railway. In places, old stream channels, 
of Pleistocene age, cut through these glacial deposits. 
It is evident that most of the glacial deposits v/ere 
well sorted by v/ater from the melting ice. 

The silts, forming deposits a himdred and 
more feet thick, are difficult to explain. In general 
they overlie the coarser material, and seem to be lake 
deposits. It is quite likely that at the close of the 
Pleistocene epoch moraines and ice blocks in places 
dammed Fraser Valley, resulting in the formation of 
long lakes in which were deposited the fine material 
which now form the silts. 

PERMAPROST 

Directly east of Lillooet, at the base of 
Fountain Ridge, a local resident has driven a tunnel 
through glacial material, some seventy-five feet into 
the hillside, the end of the timnel being approximately 
forty feet from ground level. This tunnel is a local 
curiosity by reason of the fact that it is a natural 
refrigerator, ice being formed at the end of the tun¬ 
nel even in the hottest weather. Indeed, it is claimed 
that more ice is formed in hot weather than in cold. 

The tunnel is completely dry, and the ice apparently 
forms by the freezing of water vapor in the air. This

may explain the fact that more ice is formed in hot 
v/eather than in cold, the v/armer air probably causing 
an increased draft through the tunnel, and supplying a 
greater quantity of moisture. The curious feature is 
that ice should form at all. Permafrost is not to be 
expected in Fraser Valley, yet the fact remains, that 
in this location at least, the ground is at present 
permanently frozen. It is not implied, however, that 
permafrost exists, or is to be expected in the glacial 
deposits of Fraser Valley. 

EROSION OF FOUNTAIN RIDGE 

Fountain Ridge is rapidly being eroded away 
on the v;est flank. This precipitous face is continually 
subjected to landslides, the writer observing two small 
I slides in the space of a month. V/ide fissures, several 
feet across, extend along the cliff tops, eventually 
resulting in the falling away of great blocks, several 

i 

I very large blocks have slid off the face, and are shorn 
in Plate 20. These blocks are so large that their 
nature is only perceived from a distance; and they con¬ 
sequently introduced an error in stratigraphic cg.lcula- 
tions v/hen first traversed. Some idea of the rapidity 
I of erosion is indicated by the fact that the top of 
the ridge shoi»vn in Plate 20 is no more than two feet

horizontal on the other side. 

BIG BEND OF FRASER RIVER 

The Big Bend of the Fraser River is the 
douhle-U bend situated some four miles north-east of 
Lillooet, and directly east of the confluence of Fraser 
and Bridge Rivers. The Big Bend geographically defines 
the northern end of Fountain Ridge. 

The Fraser River here cuts directly across 
the formations of Fountain Ridge, and its course is 
evidently antecedent to the present height of land. 

The course of Fraser River at the Big Bend has apparent¬ 
ly been controlled by the induration and structure of 
the beds through which the river has cut. The present 
course is within the Lillooet Formation.

GEOLOGICAL HISTORY 


GENERAL CONLUSIONS 


In the Lillooet area the earliest rocks 
known as mainly quartz-mica and chloritic schists, 
crumpled phyllite with thin bands of crystalline lime¬ 
stone, and intercalated beds of serpentinized green¬ 
stone. These beds have been correlated by the writer 
with the Chilliwack Group, of Pennsylvanian or Permian 
age, in the southern part of the Ashcroft sheet. They 
have also been referred to by Dav/son (1894) and Bateman 
(1912)5^ as belonging to the Cache creek Series, the 
upper section of which has been shovm by Crockford and 
Warren (1935) to be of Middle Pemian age. The writer 
is therefore uncertain as to the age of these beds, no 
fossils having been found, and tentatively considers 
them to be of Permian age. 


No rocks of Jurassic age were found in the 
Lillooet area. However, some thirty-five miles north¬ 
west of Lillooet, MacKenzie (1920) describes Jurassic 
rocks underlying the Eldorado series of Lower Cretaceous 
age. Caimes (1937) describes the Hiirley Formation 
along Bridge River, some fifty miles north-v^/est of 
Lillooet, as probably being of Lower Cretaceous, and 
possibly in part of Upper Jurassic age. It should be

emphasized that no sharp demarcation can be made bet¬ 
ween rocks of Upper Jurassic and/or Lov;er Cretaceous 
ages along Fraser Valley; and it is probable that more 
or less continuous sedimentation v/as effected during 
the transition from one period to the other. 

The rocks of Fountain Ridge, and its north¬ 
ward extension, are of Lower Cretaceous age, the lower 
section possibly belonging to the Barremian stage. The 
writer considers that the upper section may be of Aptian 
age. The overlying volcanics are considered by Dr. S. 
Duffell (1946)# to be, at least in part, of Aptian age. 

With the exception of some possibly Tertiary 
volcanics, no rocks of any other periods are known in 
the Lillooet area. 

The Chilliwack Group as a whole consists of 
highly metamorphosed argillaceous, arenaceous and vol- 
I canic rocks. The argillaceous types are now represented 

i 

by phyllites, and the arenaceous and volcanic types by 
schists and greenstones respectively. It is likely 
that the sedimentary beds were near shore deposits. 

The volcanics may have been sub-marine, although there 
is no evidence of this, except the indirect and probable 

evidence of a sinking landmass as indicated by the over- 
lying Middle Permian limestones near Pavilion Lake.

This is based on the assumption, however, that similar 
limestone overlay the present sediments of the Chilli¬ 
wack Group, in the Lillooet area. This assumption is 
probably tenable, as crystalline limestone occurs with 
the phyllite, and lithologically similar rocks to those 
of the Chilliwack Group are found underlying the Pemnian 
limestones in the Kamloops area. As previously men¬ 
tioned, the upper section of the Cache creek series is 
probably over 8,000 feet thick; while the lower section, 
which the writer is tentatively correlating with the 
Chilliwack Group probably exceeds 5,000 feet in thick¬ 
ness. 

! 

During Triassic time the Lillooet area was 
apparently high, as no Triassic beds have as yet been 
found. In adjacent areas the Nicola Group, probably of 

I 

Upper Triassic age, was laid dov^ni. These beds are 
argillaceous, arenaceous and limy, with a considerable 
amount of intercalated volcanics. 

I During Lower Jurassic time the land was gen¬ 

erally high, as no beds definitely of this age have been 
found; although MacKenzie (1920) placed the upper part 
of the Cadwallader Series, some thirty-five miles north 
v/est of Lillooet, as tentatively of Lov7er Jurassic age.

During Middle and upper Jurassic times the 
area was generally inundated, although certain areas 
were probably high* No Jurassic beds have been found 
in the immediate area of Lillooet, and the writer has 
therefore tentatively assumed that the Lower Cretaceous 
beds rest directly on the chilliw^ack Group* In the Hope 
area Camsell (1919) found presumably Lower Cretaceous 
conglomerate resting unconformably on slates which 
Cairnes (1943) has placed as of Chilliwack Group age 
and younger* 

It is generally considered that the orogeny 
of the Coast Range began in Upper Jurassic time* Un¬ 
doubtedly, considerably intrusion took place in post- 
Barremian time, and most likely during the span of Lower 
Cretaceous time, and this intrusion may have been assoc¬ 
iated with orogeny* The writer is of the opinion that 
the orogeny of the Coast Range took place over a long 
span of time, possibly beginning in Upper Jurassic time 
and continuing to post-Oligocene time* During post- 
Oligocene time the major faulting (along Fraser Talley 
apparently took place, as no Tertiary volcanics are 
found to the west of the shear zone, it is possible, 
of course, that Tertiary volcanics would have been erod¬ 
ed off the Coast Mountains* This orogeny, over such a

long span of time, was possibly not a continuous uplift, 
but a series of uplifts. 

Troughs of deposition in Lower Cretaceous 
time were probably deep and narrow, and the topography 
evidently rugged, as indicated by the general coarse¬ 
ness and poor sorting of the clastic sediments, espec¬ 
ially in those deposited during, or possibly in post- 
Barr emian time. 

The orogeny of the Coast Range seems to have 

been one of general regional uplift, as indicated by 

the general accordance of elevation of the peaks, in 

both north-south and east-v/est directions. Sedimentary 

• % 

beds of Cretaceous, possibly Jurassic and Permian ages 
remain as patches in the interior parts of the coast 
Mountains, but have largely been eroded away, exposing 
the batholiths of dioritic rocks. The continued region¬ 
al uplift of the Coast Range resulted in dovm faulting, 
or step faulting of the Jurassic? and Lower cretaceous 
rocks along the eastern flank of the coast Mountains.

LITHOLOGY OF FOTJNTAIN RIDGE 

ABSTRACT AITD lOTERPRETATI (W 

The arenaceous (using the terra in its text¬ 
ural sense) rocks are generally medium grained, the 
grain sizes averaging 0*2 - 0.5 mm. in diameter. These 
have been designated as arkoses and grayivacke. The 
term arkose has been applied where the clastic material 
is largely feldspathic; and the term gra3rwacke where 
the fragments are largely of volcanics, and considered 
to have been derived from the erosion of volcanic beds. 
There is no clear cut distinction between these types 
as found at Fountain Ridge, some of these arenaceous 
rocks have been designated as tuffaceous, thereby im¬ 
plying that volcanic glass (not derived from the ero¬ 
sion of volcanic beds) forms a part of the rock. 

This interpretation is based on the probable 

I presence of shards of volcanic glass, and the general 

I 

! isotropic character of the groundraass, which is taken 
to indicate (unless there is much chlorite present) a 
vitric nature. It should be stated that the vu*iter is 
av;are that even the presence of shards does not prove 
that volcanic dust settled into the sediments from the 
air^f, as they^ could have been derived from the erosion 
of an ash bed.

Pirsson (1915) recognizes three main types 
of tuffs, namely; vitric, crystal, and lithic. He states 
that most tuffs are a mixture of all three. The vitric 
tuffs are composed of fragments of volcanic glass; the 
crystal tuffs of fragments of crystals and euhedral 
crystals; and the lithic tuffs of fragments of volcanic 
rock. The thin sections of arenaceous rocks examined 
by the v/riter certainly contained numerous angular frag¬ 
ments of volcanic rock, such as felsite and volcanic 
glass. The presence of shards in any quantity is ques¬ 
tionable; and the presence of crystals derived from ex¬ 
plosions in volcanic vents is, in the writer’s opinion, 
impossible of proof, one way or the other. 

Where clastic material is fairly v/ell rounded, 
the presence of volcanics(ash) would be indicated by the 
angularity of the volcanic fragments. Hoxvever, in the 
case of the arenaceous rocks examined the elastics were 
in all cases angular, and in most cases poorly sorted 
I as to size. Thus, on this basis, no differentisbion as 
to origin could be made between fragments. 

The interpretation, therefore, as to whether 
these arenaceous rocks are tuffs or tuffaceous (in the 
sense of the volcanic material having been transported 
to these sediments by aeolian means) or whether the vol-

-canic material is v/liolly clastic, dexiends to a large 
extent on the field relationships of the beds* In gen¬ 
eral, the beds of the Lillooet Formation are laminated, 
differing lithologically, in a vertical direction, 
within a fev/ feet, and often within a few inches* The 
beds of the Fountain Ridge Formation, on the other hand, 
are massive, and little lithological difference can be 
noted over a stratigraphic section of several hundred 
feet* On this basis, the writer is of the opinion that 
v/hereas there may be several distinct beds of tuff in 
the Lillooet Fonnation; tuff beds are a minor feature 
in the Fountain Ridge Formation* Many beds in the 
latter formation, however, may have received wind borne 
volcanic ash, and therefore could be termed tuffaceous* 
In short, the beds of the Fountain Ridge Formation are 
essentially of a clastic nature; and in the ?7riter»s 
opinion the majority of volcanic material was derived 
from the erosion of volcanic beds* 

The arenaceous rocks examined v/ere composed 
essentially of fragments of rock* It is presumed that 
these fragments of rock were derived from the Chilliwack 
Group, the igneous rocks of the Coast Range, and very 
likely Jurassic and Lower cretaceous sedimentary and 
volcanic rocks* The detrital material in the probable 
order of abundance consists of fragments of feldspar.

volcanics (glass, felsite, basalt and rhyolite), argil¬ 
lite (probably including metargillites and phyllites), 
and quartz* Minor amounts, as detrital material, of 
calcite, epidote, and biotite v;ere observed. The 
groundmass was in most cases difficult to distinguish 
from the fragments, and in all cases was felsitic* 

This distinction between groundmass and detrital frag¬ 
ments was made difficult, and sometimes impossible by 
alteration* 

In some rocks considerable chlorite formed 
part of the groundmass* In other rocks the groundmass 
was partly isotropic, vjhich the writer considered to 
indicate the presence of partly devitrified volcanic 
glass. Most of the feldspar showed alteration, in vary¬ 
ing degrees, to sericite (in the case of orthoclase) 
and possibly paragonite (in the case of plagioclase)* 

A white, opaque alteration product of feldspar., which 

i is probably a kaolinite type of mineral v/as observed in

the feldspar was probably also effected by hydrothermal 
action. In view of the structural interpretation, which 
assumes that the Fountain Ridge Formation v/as at one 
time overlain by many hundred feet of volcanics, it is 
not unlikely that the sedimentary rocks should have been 
subjected to hydrothermal alteration. 

The Lillooet Formation represent a much finer 
phase of sedimentation than the overlying beds. These 
beds are probably of Barremian age, as indicated by the 
fauna, and probably represent the off-shore deposits of 
a land mass of moderate relief. There was evidently 
considerable vulcanism at this time. 

The over luring conglomerate zone may mark a 
period of accelerated uplift, as previously outlined, 
or may be a basal conglomerate formed in a sinking 
trough. At any rate, the land mass was probably rugged, 
thick and poorly sorted sediments being deposited in 
deep troughs, or on an alluvial plain. It is evident, 
from microscopic examination of these elastics, that 
the material was not carried far, for the fragments are 
very angular, and usually poorly sorted as to size. 
During this time vifLcanism was again active, though pro¬ 
bably not to the same extent as prior to the uplift. 
Later, however, a great increase of volcanic activity

in Lower Cretaceous, and possibly in Aptian time, 
resulted in the formation of many hundred feet of vol¬ 
canic flows and pyroclastics* 

The volcanics examined to the east of Foun¬ 
tain Ridge are considered by the v/riter to be of Lower 
Cretaceous age, as previously explained. Some of the 
uppermost beds may, however, be of Tertiary age. The 
only volcanic of probably Tertiary age examined by the 
writer was a flat lying flow of fresh, vescicular, oli¬ 
vine basalt occurring in the north-west corner of Map 
408 A# This rock is represented by Slide 46-00 7^55. 

The other volcanics were folded, more altered, and con¬ 
sisted of pyroclastics, basalts and minor rhyolite. 

The above conclusions reached by the wTiter 

I 

I are based on the examination of a few specimens from 

I scattered localities, and on the field examination of 

I a stratigranhic section several thousand feet thick 

I 

I 

I and some fifteen to tv/enty miles in linear extent. It 

I is obvious, therefore, that only very general conclus¬ 
ions were reached.

Field Notes 

Specimen from highly folded argillaceous 
and arkosic beds.' Intruded by dykes and sills 
of feldspar porphyry (slide ^37) 

Megascopic Description 

Indurated, greyish black, argillaceoixs rock, 
weathering brov/nish. 

Microscopic Description 

Structure -—indistinct orientation of 

. grains along bedding planes. 

Texture - fragmental material; fragments 

average less than 0.05*ram. 
(measured) in diameter. 
Composition (estimated) “ • 

70^5 of the rock is of cryptocrys- ' ■ 
talline m8.terial; felsitic, with carbon¬ 
aceous matter, minor chlorite and 
possibly some partly devitrified glass. 

SOJ^ of the rock is of microcrystall¬ 
ine quartz and feldspar, v/ith minor 
calcite and P 3 rrite. 


Remarks 

Fragmental material cannot be distinguished 
from the grouhdmass. The rock has been baked 
by intrusives, and probably hydro thermally alter¬ 
ed, though there is no marked evidence of this. 
The rock has essentially the same composition as 
Slide #24, though there is no distinct evidence 
of volcanic material.

Megascopic Description 

Light grey, feldspar porphyry. 

Microscopic Description ' 

Texture - porphyritic, the phenocrysts 

averaging 2.0 to 3.0 mm. 
(measured) in diameter, the 
other grains measuring on the 
average app. 0.2 mm. in diameter. 

Composition 

The rock is felsitic, with phenocrysts, 
of zoned plagioclase (indeteminate) , and 
very minor quartz. Titanite,“and large 
grains of apatite are“ present. Very minor 
chlorite, and some epidote (probably from 
the alteration of feldspar) are present. 

There is some pyrite. 

The quartz, in part, is secondary." 

The most striking feature of this rock is 
the large amount of calcite (app. 20^ of 
the rock) which seems to have in part 
replaced, in ah intimate mixture with fel¬ 
sitic material, the feldspar phenocrysts. 

In general, the rock is highly altered, 
and probably is of syenite composition.

Two miles north-east of the mouth of 
Fountain Creek* 

Field Notes 

Stratigraphically close to Specimen #25* 
Occurs as a bed, somewhat smashed, as it is in 
a shear zone. 

Megascopic Description 

Bright green, arenaceous rock. 

Microscopic Description 

texture - fragmental, the fragments 

averaging 0.2 mm. (measured) 
in diameter. 

Composition 

The rock is composed wholly of frag¬ 
ments of volcanic rocks, with much glassy 
material, partly devitrified. Some frag¬ 
ments shov; trachitic structure, with a 
dendritic grov/th-of magnetite. The ground 
mass is felsitic, being highly altered to 
chlorite, and was probably derived from 
volcanic ash. Plagioclase fragments (of 
varying composition) are comparatively 
unaltered. The rock thus appears to show 
differential alteration, the groundmass 
apparently having been more basic, and 
therefore more readily altered, some plag 
ioclase crystals are zoned. Pyrite and 
limonite are present in minor amounts.

South hank of Red Creek, one mile west of 
Fraser River. 

Field Notes 

volcanic flow, underlying the flow from 
which Specimen #54 was taken. The beds are 
folded and sheared, and are close to the faulted 
contact with the Lower Cretaceous sedimentary 
rocks. 

Megascopic Description 

A dark, grey feldspar porphyry. 

Microscopic Description 

Texture ’—- 'basaltic, with trachitic and 
porphyritic structure 

Composition 

Labradorite 

Augite (minor) - less than 10^ 

Chlorite (very minor) 

Magnetite (minor) 

Hematite (minor) - less than 5^ 
Calcite (very minor) 

Remarks 

The rock is, in general, microcrystalline 
to cryptocrystalline, with lath shaped crystall¬ 
ites of indeterminate plagioclase forming a 
trachitic structure in the felsitic groimdmass. 
Some phenocrysts of labradorite have a zoned 
structure. These phenocrysts have imdergone 
sericitization. Less than lOjJ of the rock is of 
augite,..which has in part altered to chlorite. 
Magnetite appears to be primary, forming less 
than ^0 of the rock, secondary hematite fills 
fractures in the rock and cleavage cracks in the 
plagioclase phenocrysts. Some calcite fills 
pores in the rock. 

Classification

Locality 

On Red creek, one mile from Fraser River. 
Field Notes 

"K volcanic flow rock, folded and somewhat 
sheared, in the proximity of a faulted contact 
with Lower Cretaceous sedimentary rocks. 


Megascopic Description 

Lark grey, fine grained, homogeneous rock, 
shov/ing flow bands. Fractures filled with 
hematite. Weathers reddish. 


Microscopic Description 

Texture —*—- Basaltic, 
structure 

Composition (estimated) 
Labradorite 
Olivine 
Hornblende 
Magnetite 5^ 


with trachitic flow 


. 


Minor chlorite, from the alteration of 
hornblende, is present. Fractures are filled 
with hematite and calcite. The plagioclase is 
not more sodic than Ab55An45, as determined from 
measurements of extinction angles in the zone 
at right angle to 010. 


Remarks 

The hornblende has probably formed after 
pyroxene. The optical characteristics of this 
hornblende are as follows: 

Color - yellowish green; not markedly pleochroic; 
very low refringence; birefringence app. 0.15 
to 0.20; nearly parallel extinction; sign of 
elongation is positive; optically negative; 2\r 
is less than 60 degrees as measured on a section 
parallel to 100; basal cleavage or parting; stout, 
prismatic crystals.
