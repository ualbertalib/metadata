I'MTRODUCTIOIM • 


The development of catalysts useful in the 
synthesis of hydrocarbons and related products from 
mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen has been , 
until recent years, a purely empirical study. To 
fundamental knowledge of the requirements for a good 
catalyst was available and a method of trial and 
error had been used exclusively in the early work of 
Fischer and co-worker. 

hot only the composition of the catalyst 
and the supporting medium but also the conditions of 
pressure, rate of gas flow, and indeed the whole syn¬ 
thesis procedure as first evolved was based on purely 
empirical data. 

On this basis, several practical, though 
probably uneconomic, plants were built in Germany. 
However, before English and American capital could be 
interested in similar plants, more fundamental know¬ 
ledge of the process w r as necessary. Cost and effic¬ 
iency factors which the Germans could afford to ignore 
in their great need for hydrocarbon fuels could not 
be ignored by companies which must compete both with 
crude oil and with other possible synthesis processes. 

dth this incentive many investigations have

•oeen pursued in recent years. These studies have not 
been directed towards finding new catalysts in gen¬ 
eral but rather towards obtaining a better under¬ 
standing of the catalysts already known. 

These investigations may be roughly divided 
into three classifications:- 

1) Fundamental studies directed towards an under¬ 
standing of the mechanism of the reaction and 
the parts played by the various promoters and 
supporters. 

2) Pilot plant work to determine the optimum 
conditions under which the synthesis should be 
run. 

3) The chemical engineering problems of reactor 
design, cooling systems, recycling processes, 
etc., on a pilot plant scale. 

These three types of studies are, of course, 
very closely interdependent and correlation between 
them must be maintained. 

The work carried out by Boomer and others 
at the University of Alberta has been primarily aimed 
at determining the activity of various catalysts and 
the conditions under which they will operate most sat-

isfactorily. A great deal of time was expended on 
catalysts which in the end proved unsuitable due either 
to low activity or short life. This only became ap¬ 
parent after a rather long period of testing in the 
pilot plant reactors. One of the aims of this in¬ 
vestigation is to evolve a method of testing based on 
fundamental properties of the catalysts that would 
show in a short test the approximate capabilities of a 
particular catalyst as to activity and life. It was 
hoped that these studies might also throw some light 
on the mechanism of the reaction. 












THE THEORY - OF ADSORPTION. 


The phenomenon of adsorption, the concen¬ 
tration at the interface of molecules dispersed in one 
of the phases, has been known and studied for many 
years. C.W.Seheele in 1773- and AbbC F.Fontana in 1777 
observed that gases were adsorbed on charcoal, but it 
was not until about 1915 that any satisfactory picture 
of adsorption, based on a fundamental mechanism!*! was 
advanced. 

The amount of adsorption occuring at equi¬ 
librium, "a”,is known to be a function of temperature 
and pressure (or concentration,if adsorption takes 
place from solution). The equation for the isotherm 
is, then, 

a = f(P) . (T constant) 

for the isobar, 

a = f(T) .. (P constant) 

and for the isotere, 

P = f(T) . (a constant) 

Empirically it was early discovered that at low 
pressures the equation for the isotherm became 
a: =1 kp 

which is analagous to Henry 1 s Law for the solubility 
of gases in liquids.

-5- 


• At higher pressures it is necessary to write 
a = kpVn 

where "n" is greater than one. The factor ,l n t! is not 
constant over any large pressure range. This equation 
for the isotherm was first proposed by Bemmelen in 
1888 but is usually referred to as the Freundlich iso¬ 
therm since he revived it in 1922. This equation ex¬ 
presses satisfactorily the adsorption of a gas over a 
small range of pressure but has no fundamental sig¬ 
nificance. It is particularly useful as an interpola¬ 
tion equation where it can be made to fit the experts 
mental data. 

Several modifications of the Freundlich iso¬ 
therm have been proposed. Arrhenius gave 

dx _ k(s - x) 
dc x 

where M s n is the saturation value of u x n ythe amount 
adsorbed. This also only applies over a very short 
range of pressure in most cases. Schmidt proposed 

ft = k < s - 

earlier, and later modified this to 
xe A(s-x)/s = kcs 

which agreed -well with experimental results in a great 










-Ro¬ 


many known cases. 

All of these were empirical expressions. 

In 1914 two different theories were advancedj both 
with some fundamental basis. Langmuir proposed an 
isotherm based on the assumption that adsorption in¬ 
volved forces of the nature of the chemical bond 5 and 
that the adsorbed layer was consequently only one 
molecule thick. Polyani on the other hand believed 
that adsorption was purely physical in nature and that 
the adsorbed phase was many layers thick. 

Langmuir made three assumptions as the basis 
for his derivation:- 

(1) that the attraction between the mol¬ 
ecules is less than the attraction between 
a molecule and the adsorbing surface 

(2) that the probability of evaporation of 
a molecule from the surface is the same 
whether the neighboring positions are filled 
or not 

(3) that molecules striking adsorbed mol¬ 
ecules are elastically reflected and only 
those striking the bare surface have a chance 


to be adsorbed. 














- 7 - 


With these assumptions the isotherm 
v abp 

TTF 

can be derived kinetically as Langmuir did it, thermo¬ 
dynamically or statistically. 

This isotherm, where it is applicable, will 
fit the experimental data from low to high pressures. 

Polyani did not derive an actual isotherm 
equation. Starting with the assumption that the ad¬ 
sorbed gas acts as a compressed film on the surface 
and obeys the same equation of state as in the. gas 
phase, he derived equations for expressing 6, the 
potential, as a function of (f> , the volume adsoroed. 

The (■ , (p curve is independent of temperature. It 
can be plotted from one experimentally determined iso¬ 
therm and other isotherms then plotted from it. 

Although the physical concept of adsorption upon which 
this theory is based has been discarded, it does cor¬ 
rectly express the temperature dependence of adsorption 
for the systems to which it is applicable. 

Zsigmondy in 1911 proposed a theory of 
capillary condensation to account for adsorption. It 
is known that the vapour pressure of a liquid in a 

i

capillary is lower than that in the bulk phase if the 
liquid wets the capillary walls. It is also known 
that many adsorbent materials have pores of minute 
size, so that it is logical to assume that this 
capillary condensation does play some part in adsorp- 
tion. 

Patrick, in 1920, approached this theory 
empirically. A variation of the Preundich equation 
was used 

v = k(P/P 0 ) 1/n 

where P Q is the vapour pressure of the liquid. Others 
based their approach on the extrapolation of the Kelvin 
equation to the small radii of capillaries present in 
adsorbents. When the capillaries are not too fine 
and the relative pressure, P/P 0 , is approaching unity 
the isotherms are successfully represented by the 
equations thus derived. In other cases capillary con¬ 
densation plays a relatively unimportant role. 

DeBoer and Zwicker in 1929 proposed a 
polarization theory to account for multimo1ecular ad¬ 
sorption, assuming that adsorbed molecules were 
polarized and could adsorb a further layer, polarizing 
these molecules in turn.

Emmett and Bn^iauer^ showed that the polar¬ 
ization theory cannot account for more than a small 
part of the energy holding even a second layer of 
molecules, particularly with such gases as argon. 

Brunnauer, Emmett and Teller in 1938 pro¬ 
posed a theory of multimolecular adsorption which is 
now generally accepted as a good approximation in most 
cases. They derived the isotherm equation 

(P/v # (P 0 -P) (l/v m C) ^ C-l.P 

v rn C P 0 

where v is the volume of gas adsorbed 

v rn is the volume of gas to form a unimol- 
ecular layer over the whole surface of the 
adsorbent. 

P is the equilibrium pressure. 

P 0 is the vapour pressure of the liquid. 

C is a constant characteristic of the system. 
The values of G and vl, are obtained from the slope 

iii 

and intercept of the straight line plot of P/P 0 
against (P/vi(P 0 -P). The surface area of the adsorbent 
can be calculated from a knowledge of the size of the

adsorbed molecule. 

This derivation is based on the assumption 
that the same forces are operative in adsorption that 
cause condensation. It is in effect a generalization 
of Langmuir’s treatment of monomolecular adsorption 
and contains the same assumptions. 

Five types of adsorption isotherm are de¬ 
scribed by Brunnauer^. Of these, the B.E.T. equation 
as given previously describes adequately three types. 

A somewhat more complex treatment is necessary for 
the other two types, taking into account the effect 
of capillary condensation. 

These five types of adsorption isotherm are 
shown in Figure I. Type I is characteristic of mono- 
molecular adsorption, that is, the Langmuir isotherm. 

A saturation adsorption corresponding to a unimolecular 
layer is reached at a pressure less than the vapour 
pressure of the liquid. This is a special case of 
the B.E.T. general equation, which may be simplified 
to 

V - Vm(C/Pq)P 
14-(C/P 0 )P 

for this type of isotherm. This is an expression of 
the Langmuir isotherm equation.

Five Types of Adsorption Isotherms.

Type two isotherm is characteristic of multi- 
molecular adsorption where E-p the average heat of ad¬ 
sorption of the first layer, is. greater than E^, the 
heat of liquefaction. Inthis case a complete first 
layer of adsorbed molecules is formed on the surface 
before second and higher layers begin to condense. The 
point "A" on the curve indicates the completion of the 
first layer of molecules. 

Then Ej is less than E^, the plot of the ad¬ 
sorption isotherm takes the form shown in Type III. 

This type is characterized'by the formation of second 
and higher layers before the. first is completed. 

Types IV and V show evidences that capillary 
condensation is occuring at pressures less than the 
vapour pressure of the liquid. The simple expression 
of the B.E.T. equation does not apply to these rather 
rare cases. The equation derived by Brunnauer, Emmett 
and Teller for these cases is much more complex and 

v, 

involve^ three further assumptions in addition to those 
already used:- 

(1) That the capillaries are of uniform size 

(2) That the walls of the capillaries are 
plane parallel surfaces 









- 13 - 


(3) That the capillaries are open on the 
sides. 

As pointed out by Brunnauer 1 , this theory is 
open to some criticism. Alien P/P 0 is small, it reduces 
to the Langmuir isotherm and since the adsorbing surf¬ 
ace is heterogeneous, the assumption that Ej is con¬ 
stant over the surface is not valid. At higher values 
of P/Pq, Ej will be more nearly constant. The agreement 
is found to be good with experimental results over the 
range 0.5>P/P 0 > O.Ofl for the types of isotherm to 
which the equation applies. At higher values of P/P 0 
capillary condensation plays an important role and 
must be taken into account. At temperatures above 
the critical temperature for the adsorbate the assump¬ 
tions used break: down and the equation is not applic¬ 
able. It is probable that only unimolecular adsorption 
occurs in this range. 

All these investigations and ‘the resultant 
equations apply only to Van der Waal’s adsorption, 
that is, where the attraction is physical in nature. 

In activated adsorption, or chemisorption as it is 
sometimes called, different forces come into play and 
these derivations do not apply. 
































THE MEASUREMENT OF SURFACE AREAS. 

‘ Tien the adsorption isotherm is of Type T, 
(Fig. I) the evaluation of the surface area can be 
carried out by means of the special case of the 'B.E.T 
equation noted previously* which is the Langmuir iso¬ 
therm. If we write this equation in the forms- 
P/v - l/(v m b) -J- (p/v m ) 

it is obvious that a plot of p/v against P will be a 
straight line of slope l/v m . The surface area can be 
calculated if the size of the adsorbed molecule is 
known. 

Certain precautions are necessary in the 
choice of experimental conditions in order that v m 
should represent a monomolecular layer over the-whole 
surface and not just the more active parts. The ad-, 
sorption should,be measured at pressures close to the 
vapour pressure at any particular temperature* which 
means in most cases working at temperatures only 
slightly higher than the boiling point at atmospheric 
pressure. 

then the isotherm is of Type II, the B.E.T. 
equation applies. The best range of application is 
at a relative pressure of from 0.1 to 0.4. Again we 








- 15 - 


should be working at a temperature only slightly above 
the boiling point. If P/P is plotted against p 

vfPo-p) 

a straight line will be obtained. Prom the intercept, 
1/(v m C), and the slope, (C -1 j / (v m C), the value of v m 
and hence the surface area, is obtained. 

The size of the measuring molecule is of 
great importance in the measurement of surface area. 

The surface area obtained will vary to a certain ex- 
tent with the measuring molecule, since some larger 
molecules, will be excluded from the smaller capillaries 

which are open to the smaller molecule. 

7 

Emmett and Dewitt, using this method, have 
reported excellent agreement in severed hundred ex¬ 
perimental determinations, checking their results by 
using different measuring gases. Ultramicroscope 
measurements also give values in good agreement. 

In the majority of cases It is satisfactory 
to take only one or two measurements of adsorption, 
.carresponding to a relative pressure of about 0.4. 

When C is large,, the slope of the line joining this 
one point to the origin in the plot of P/P 0 against 
P/v(P 0 -P) is l/v m within the limits-of experimental 











- 16 - 


error, since (C-l) and C are approximately equal and 
the intercept, l/v rn C will be negligibly small. 

In this Investigation, all surface areas 
were measured using nitrogen as the adsorbed gas at a 
temperature of 83° K. At this temperature the vapour 
pressure of liquid nitrogen is 158 cm. of Hg so that 
pressures 'between 15 and 70 cm. of Hg are in the Use¬ 
ful range of relative pressures of from 0.1 to 0.4. 

It has been suggested that the surface area 
of a catalyst for the Fischer-Tropsch reaction should 
be, in some degree at least, a measure of the activity 
This investigation indicates that surface area is not 
a controlling factor, but it is assumed that a certain 
minimum area is necessary for affi efficient catalyst.

be mbchanism of the 


The most widely accepted theory for the 
mechanism of hydrocarbon synthesis on cobalt-thoria- 
kfciselghur catalysts is that of Craxford and Rideal^’* . 
Several steps are postulated leading to the eventual 
formation of a hydrocarbon molecule. First, carbon 
monoxide is chemisorbed on the surface. This is re¬ 
duced by hydrogen to the metallic carbide, CogC, or 
alternatively forms the carbide by reaction with another 
molecule of carbon monoxide. lloleeular hydrogen then 
forms a -CHp group, still attached to the surface of 
the catalyst by a chemical bond. In the absence of 
chemisorbed hydrogen these methylene groups condense 
as macro-molecules or chains, still partially held to 
the catalyst surface by valence bonds in this trans¬ 
ition state. Widely separated chemisorbed hydrogen 
atoms disrupt these macro-molecules and they are de¬ 
sorbed as hydrocarbon molecules.. If chemisorbed 
hydrogen atoms are present in any great quantities 
then the chains will be short, in fact the majority 
of the methylene groups will be reduced to methane, 
rather than the higher hydrocarbons desired. 









- 18 - 


This series of reactions may be summarized as follows;- 

i) 2Co-b GO 4- Hg. -> Co 2 C -f-HgO 

ii) H 2 (mol?) + Co 2 C -V 2Go + -CHg 

iii) x(-CH 2 ) (-GH 2 ) x 

iv) hydrogenation cracking off of (-Cii 2 ) x chain 
as an. aliphatic hydrocarbon? saturated or 
olefinic. 

v) if the catalyst 'surface is not largely Co 2 C 
then chemisorbed hydrogen atoms will break 
off most of the methylene groups as methane 
as fast as they are formed. 


Although no direct evidence that cobalt 
catalysts are capable of cracking hydrocarbons has 

A 4 

been round? Cranford shows that there is an optimum 
rate of synthesis gas flow over the catalyst bed? and 


postulates that at slower rates of flow the h\ 
carbons produced in the first part of the bed are 


cracked in the later part to methane with consequent 
reduced yields. Cranford^further shows that the rate 
of formation of carbon dioxide steadily drops as the 
flow of synthesis gas is increased? showing' no maximum? 


so that the formation of carbon dioxide cannot be 
connected directly with the synthesis reaction. The 









- 19 - 


reaction is probably: - 

CO 4- 2H 2 -> H 2 0 4- -CH 2 
rather than:- 

2C0 4 - 2H 2 —> 002 4 - ~CH 2 

The experimental, evidence on which Craxford bases this 
hypothesis*is shown in Figure II. in graphical form. 



FigureTT 





















- 20 - 


Using this hypothesis as a basis, Craxford 5 
then investigated the rate of carbiding of promoted 
and unprornoted catalysts in atmospheres of carbon mon¬ 
oxide alone and of synthesis gas. He tested five 
catalysts in all:- 

i) Cobalt metal 

ii) Co:Th0 2 ? 100:18 

iii) CosKAiselguhr , 1:1 

iv) Co:Th0 2 :Kg , 100:18:100 

v) Co:Th0 2 :Kg , 100:21:100 

Of these, number (iv) was a successful synthesis 
catalyst but number (v) was inactive due probably to 
some uncontrolled factor in its preparation. 

The rate of carbiding was slowest on the 
cobalt metal, and fastest on cobalt promoted with the 
thorium oxide alone. The others in order of increasing 
rates were:- (iii), (v) and (iv). 

The order was the same, (although the rates were faster) 
in the synthesis gas mixture as in carbon monoxide 
alone. 

The rate of hydrogenation of. ethylene was 


next measured over these five catalysts. All were found 












- 21 - 


to have substantially the same activity as hydrogen¬ 
ation catalysts. 

The rate of reduction of the cobalt carbide 
was measured by admitting pure hydrogen to the carbided 
catalysts at 175° C. Cobalt alone, which had the 
slowest rate of carbiding, was found to have the slow¬ 
est rate of reduction of the.carbide also-. Cobalt 
promoted with thorium oxide, which had the fastest rate 
of formation of the carbide, also had the greatest 
rate of reduction. The other three, which were the 
only ones that could be classified as useful catalysts, 
were in the reverse order:- (iv), (v) and (iii). 
in order of increasing rate of reduction of the carbide. 

Thus it was shown that the most useful 
catalyst,,number (iv), had the fastest rate of carbide 
formation combined with, the slowest rate of carbide 
reduction among the useful catalysts. Catalyst number 
(v), which was not so successful, had a lower rate 
of carbide formation and a faster rate of carbide 
reduction, number (iii), which is a rather poor 
catalyst for the synthesis reaction, was still slower 
in its rate of carbide formation and faster in its 
rate of reduction of the carbide. 












- 22 - 


This suggests an effective and relatively 
rapid method for testing the efficiency of synthesis 
catalysts. The combination of a rapid rate of carbide 
formation with a slow rate of reduction of that carbide 
should indicate a good catalyst. 








EXPERIMENTAL 


I APPARATUS 

The apparatus used was an adaptation of 
that design first proposed by Emmett for the study 
of adsorption. It is shown in Figure III. Storage 
bulbs, C,D,E,F, for the gases used in these measure¬ 
ments were connected by stopcocks, 3,4,5,6, to a 
vacuum line. This was connected through a stopcock, 

1, to a McLeod gauge and through stopcock 2 to a 
Mercury diffusion pump backed by a rotary oil pump. 
Through stopcock 8 the line M,R was connected to the 
vacuum line and the gas storage bulbs. A mercury man¬ 
ometer, M, which could be evacuated through the stop¬ 
cock 7, was used to measure the pressure inthis part 
of the system. A series of bulbs of known volume, 

I,II,III,IV,V, and the reaction chamber, R, (which 
could be surrounded by an electric furnace or vacuum 
flask) were connected to this manometer. 

The volume of the line from the manometer 
to stopcocks 8 and 10 and the calibrated volumes, B, 
was calibrated, so that with the mercury level at 
known points between the bulbs, B, the volume of the 
system was accurately known.

II PREPARATION OF GASES 

The gases used were nitrogen, hydrogen, 
helium and carbon monoxide. Nitrogen was tank 
nitrogen passed through a liquid air trap to remove 
all condensible gases and vapours. It was recognized 
that small amounts of oxygen might be present in this 
tank nitrogen, but it was felt that the effect of 
this would not introduce a significant error in surface 
area measurements. 

The hydrogen used was tank hydrogen, passed 
over platinized asbestos at 450° to 500° C., then 
through an activated charcoal trap immersed in liquid 
air. The only impurity of any account in tank hydrogen 
is oxygen, which is completely removed by this treat¬ 
ment. Small amounts of nitrogen, if not removed by 
the charcoal scrubber, would have little effect on 
the measurements. 

Helium was commercial helium passed through 
an activated charcoal scrubber immersed in liquid air. 
Ho appreciable impurities are present in such helium. 

Carbon monoxide was prepared by dropping 
formic acid (85%) into concentrated sulfuric acid 








.

- 26 - 


(s.g. 1.85) at 100° C. The gas was passed through 
dehydrite and soda-lime tubes to absorb moisture 
and carbon dioxide, then through a glass wool packed 
trap immersed in liquid air. The only impurities 
present in carbon monoxide prepared in this manner 
are moisture and acid spray and a small amount of 
carbon dioxide, all of which will be completely 
removed by this treatment. 

Each bulb in turn was evacuated, using the 
mercury vapour pump, and filled with one of these 
gases. Bulb C was filled with nitrogen, D with 
hydrogen, E with helium and F with carbon monoxide. 
The hydrogen system was so arranged that a continuous 
stream of purified hydrogen could be passed into the 
bulb D, and thence through stopcocks 4,8,10 and 11 
over the catalyst for the reduction step. 

Ill MODIFICATIONS 

The apparatus as shown in Figure III was 
used for the first part of the investigation; the 
determination of adsorption isotherms and surface 
areas. The determination of the rate of carbiding 
and the rate of reduction of the carbide required a 
larger known volume of the reaction gas than could

be held in the bulbs B and also required that this 
gas could be circulated over the catalyst. Periodic 
measurement of the volume of gas remaining at known 
pressure or of the pressure at known volume was also 
necessary. It was still desired to carry out surface 
area measurements so that the design of the system 
must not be changed basically. 

The first modification made with these 
requirements in mind was as shown in Figure IV. The 
large calibrated volume, Q, and stopcock 14 were 
added before the catalyst chamber and two connected 
bulbs, S, after it. Enough Dowtherm was in these 
two bulbs to fill one of them. With the Dowtherm 
level at stopcock 11 the volume was known; circulation 
was obtained by raising and lowering the mercury 
level in bulb Q with stopcocks 11 and 14 open; 
surface area measurements could be carried out by 
simply leaving bulb Q full of mercury. 

After three runs had been made with this 
arrangement, discrepancies in the results obtained 
made it clear that this was not a satisfactory setup. 
The solubility of hydrogen and methane in the Dow- 
therm was tested by circulating these gases with no

catalyst in the system. It was found that hydrogen 
was not soluble but that methane was very soluble. 

A second modification was then made as 
shown in Figure V. Two ground glass check v&lVes, 

Vi and Vgj were placed in the system} allowing 
gas to flow into the catalyst chamber only and Vg 
allowing it to flow out only. A small bulb, T, 
added extra volume to the system to aid circulation. 
Raising and lowering the mercury level in the bulb 
Q with stopcock 15 closed and 14 open raised and 
lowered the pressure. As the pressure increased, 
gas was forced into R through V^, and as the pressure 
decreased it flowed out through Vg. With the mercury 
level in Q aFa known mark and stopcock 15 open to 
equalize the pressure the system had a known volume 
and the gas remaining could be determined by measur¬ 
ing the pressure. With bulb T closed off by stop¬ 
cock 15 and stopcock 15 open the apparatus was still 
suitable for adsorption and surface area measurements. 
Reduction of the catalyst could be carried out by 
opening the two way stopcock 17 to the atmosphere 
and passing hydrogen through.

Two faults are inherent in this last design 
First, the circulation is slow and somewhat uncertain 
second, the pressure has to be varied about 16 cm. of 
mercury to give circulation. Since these are zero 
order reactions and not dependent on pressure or con¬ 
centration, these two faults should not affect the 
results, providing a sufficient concentration of the 
reacting gas can be maintained over the catalyst to 
prevent the reaction from becoming first order. The 
pressure variation is accentuated by the fact that 
the products of the reaction are left in, so that the 
partial pressure of the reacting gas steadily de¬ 
creases as the reaction procedes. 

IV PROCEDURE 

Preparation of the Sample : - A weighed 
sample of the catalyst to be tested was put in the 
chamber R and the whole sealed in place. The sample 
was degassed at 100° C. or 25° higher than the high¬ 
est temperature to be used, until the pressure was 
less than 0.001 mm of mercury and would hold this 
with the mercury diffusion pump shut off (stopcock 
2 closed). The time for this step varied from one

half hour for some keiselguhrs to two or three hours 
for some catalysts. 

Measurement of the Dead Sp ace :- Stopcock 
10 was closed and a measured amount of helium taken 
in the bulbs B by opening stopcocks 5 and 8. With 
these stopcocks closed again the pressure in the bulbs 
was read on the manometer M. The temperature of the 
water bath around the bulbs was recorded. 

The catalyst temperature was brought to the 
temperature of the measurement to be made by means of 
the electric furnace or a thernos flask containing an 
appropriate cooling agent. Stqpock 10 was opened, 
allowing the helium to expand into the reaction vessel. 
The new pressure was read on the manometer. 

After the modification of the apparatus the 
only difference in this procedure was that stopcock 
14 was used in pls.ce of stopcock 10. 

Calculation of the dead space was made as 

follows: -

Determination of Surface Area : - The catalys t 
was degassed at 100° C. until a vacuum of at least 
0.001 mm of mercury could be maintained with the 
mercury vapour pump shut off. 

Stopcock 10 was closed and the chamber R 
was immersed in liquid air. A measured amount of 
nitrogen was taken in bulbs B by opening stopcocks 
3 and 8. With these stopcocks closed again the 
pressure and temperature of the gas in the bulbs was 
recorded. 

Vg is the volume of the bulbs and line 
containing the nitrogen. 

Pg is the pressure in cm of mercury. 

Tg is the temperature of the gas. 

Stopcock 10 was opened and the new pressure recorded.

area and adsorption measurements were made on re¬

The catalyst chamber R was raised rapidly 
to 400° C. in an atmosphere of helium or nitrogen or 
evacuated. At this temperature hydrogen was passed 
over the catalyst in a rapid stream by opening stop¬ 
cocks 4, 8, 10 and 11. After the first modification 
stopcock 14 was also open, and after the second mod¬ 
ification, stopcocks 15 and 17 (to atmosphere). 

Bulb D was supplied constantly with purified tank 
hydrogen. 

After two hours the catalyst was cooled in 
a slow stream of hydrogen, and kept in an atmosphere 
of hydrogen until the next step was to be carried 
out. The sample was in some cases stored in helium 
or evacuated but nitrogen was not used because of the 
possibility of contamination with oxygen. Nitrogen 
was used to determine the surface areas of reduced 
catalysts without apparent harm. 

Measurement ofthe Hate of Carbiding ; - 
After the reduction, the catalyst was evacuated at 
225° C. to less than 0.001 mm of mercury and stop¬ 
cock 14 closed. Bulb Q was filled with carbon mon¬ 
oxide by opening stopcocks' 6 and 8. With these

stopcocks closed again the pressure arid temperature 
of the gas was recorded, and the S.T.P. volume was 
calculated. 

With the first modification, stopcock 14 
was now opened, mercury run into bulb Q until the 
pressure was greater than atmospheric, stopcock 11 
opened and the gas circulated back and forth over the 
catalyst. A reading was taken by lowering the 
mercury in Q, closing stopcock 11 when the Dowtherm 
level reached it, and reading the pressure and temp¬ 
erature of the gas remaining with the mercury level 
in Q at a known volume mark. 

With the second modification, carbon mon¬ 
oxide was admitted to R by opening stopcock 14. 

With stopcock 15 closed and 17 in the circulating 
position the pressure was raised and lowered by 
raising and lowering the mercury level in Q. A 
reading was taken by lowering the level of mercury 
in 0 to the known volume mark, opening stopcock 15 
to equalise the pressure, and recording the temper¬ 
ature and pressure. 

In both cases, from the known volume, 
temperature and pressure the volume of gas remaining

- 39 - 


reduced to S.T.P. was calculated. Since the 
reaction is 

2Co 4 - 2C0-^ Co 2 C 4 - C0 2 

twice the volume which has disappeared represents 
the amount of carbon monoxide actually used up to 
that time. 

Volume of carbon monoxide used per gram 
of cobalt in the sample was plotted against time. 

After ten hours the remaining gas was pumped off 
(to less than .001 mm) and stopcock 14 closed. 

A sample run is shown in Table II. 
Measurement of the Rate of Reduction of thi 
Carbide :- This procedure was identical with that 
described for the measurement of the rate of carbiding. 
The temperature used was 175° C. and hydrogen was 
used in place of carbon monoxide. Again, since the 
reaction is : 

Co 2 C4- 2H 2 ~~> 2 Co4~ CH 4 

the volume of Hydrogen actually used in the reaction 
is twice the apparent loss in volume.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 


I SURFACE AREAS 

The surface areas of four different keisel- 
guhrs were measured. The results are shown in Table 
III and Figures VI and VII. These measurements were 
made partly as a check on the apparatus. The surface 
areas of untreated catalyst keiselguhrs were known 
to be about 18 to 20 square meters per gram and those 
of alkali washed keiselguhrs to be about 2 square 
meters per gram. The values obtained are therefore 
reasonable. 

It is apparent that the best support for 
a catalyst would most probably be Filter Cell because 
of its large surface area. A mild acid wash has no 
effect on its fine structure, since it has not changed 
the surface area. 

The surface areas of six catalysts were 
measured in the unreduced state, as charged to the 
units. These results are shown in Table IV and in 
Figure VIII. 

The first tested, shown as B.M., was a 
catalyst prepared by the U.S. Bureau of Mines and 
had the composition 

Co:Th0 2 SMgO:Kg - 100:6:12:200

No, 1 (a) was prepared by LaZerte, Loshaek 
and Scott 9 at the University of Alberta, in 1945, It 
had the composition 

Co:ThC 2 :Kg - 82:18:100 

No. 1 (b) had the same composition as No. 1 
(a) but was prepared one year later by Wright and 
Dim^ock 10 at the University of Alberta. 

Nos. 2, 4, and 7 (a and b) were also pre¬ 
pared by Wright and Dimmock in 1S46 and had the 
following compositions 

No. 2 Co:Th0 2 :Mg0:Kg - 36:2:4:58 

No. 4 Co:Th0 2 :Kg - 100:18:100 

No. 7 Co:Th0 2 :MgO:Kg - 100:6:12:200 

No. 7 (a) was unpelleted and No. 7 (b) was pelleted 

once with 5% graphite added. All others were pelleted 

with 5% graphite. 

Of these catalysts, probably No. 2 is the 
least active. Wright and Dinpock in a private com¬ 
munication have stated that yields were very small 
from this catalyst. On the other hand, No. 7, which 
has nearly the same surface area, is the most active 
of these catalysts when tested in the pilot plant 
units'** 0 .

It is apparent , therefore, that surface area is not 
the controlling factor in catalyst activity. The 
surface areas of the catalysts tested are not in any 
comparable order to their activities. 

The surface areas of catalysts B.M. (a) and 
No. 7 (b) were measured after reduction. These results 
are shown in Figure VIII and in Table V below.

Emmett in a private communication reports 
little change in the surface area on reduction but these 
two catalysts show over 50% loss. It is possible 
that some oxidation of the catalyst is responsible 
although the greatest care was taken to avoid this. 

II ADSORPTION 

Several attempts were made to obtain re¬ 
producible results on the adsorption of carbon mon¬ 
oxide and hydrogen on B.M. catalyst. Since these 
are chenisorptions and only partially reversible with 



t

pressure, each equilibrium point must be approached 
carefully from a point of lower adsorption. 

The only reproducible results that were ob¬ 
tained were for the adsorption of hydrogen on the re¬ 
duced B.M. catalyst. These are shown in Figure IX. 

In this case, the curves do not represent 
true equilibrium conditions since.even after eighteen 
hours.further adsorption could be detected at 200° C. 
and 42 cm pressure. Readings were taken after 10 
minutes at the equilibrium pressure. Conditions were 
reasonably steady after this time and the points were 
reproducible within the limits of the accuracy of the 
experiment. 

The difficulty of obtaining reproducible 
results and the slowness of the determination led to 
its abandonment. The adsorption of carbon monoxide 
on the reduced catalyst and of hydrogen on the carbided 
catalyst could not be measured and these were thought 
most likely to be significant. 

Ill RATE OF CARBIDING AND REDUCTION OF THE CARBIDE 

Catalyst #7, as a fairly successful catalyst, 
was tested for rate of carbiding and rate of reduction

of the carbide. Six samples in all were run, to 
obtain reproducible results if possible. The results 
are shown in Figures X and XI. 

Runs 1, 2 and 3 show some measure of re¬ 
producibility in the rate; that is, their slopes are 
nearly parallel. Since Dowtherm was in contact with 
the reaction gases in these three runs and presumably 
dissolved some of them, the results are not sig¬ 
nificant. Similarly, the rate of reduction of the 
carbide for samples 2 and 3 is in error. Sample 
one was spoiled by the admission of air after three 
hours carbiding. 

The last three runs, 4, 5 and 6, which 
were made after the Dowtherm bulbs were removed and 
replaced by the internal circulating apparatus, show 
little obvious agreement in the rates of carbiding. 
The slopes of the graphs of runs 4 and six are nearly 
the same but run 4 shows a much larger initial jupp. 
Run 5 dropped off in rate after one hour but up to 
that point agreed well with run 6. After 10 hours 
runs four and six reached the same final state 
representing approximately 50% of the Co in the

form of carbide. Run 5 was spoiled by admission of 
air after 10 hours carbiding. 

The rates of reduction (Figure XI) of runs 
4 and 6 are in agreement for the first part of the 
curve but run 6 dropped off suddenly in rate,after 
30 minutes showing no further reaction. This would 
indicate that only a small amount of carbide had been 
formed, or more probably that the greater part of the 
carbide formed had been rendered inactive in some 
manner. Runs 2 and 3, made with the Dowthem trap in 
the system, are lower presumably due to previously 
absorbed gases being given off. 

Although it has not been possible to obtain 
reproducible results up to the present on the rate of 
carbiding or rate of reduction of the carbide, it is 
felt that this procedure has some value. It is 
probable that with better temperature control and 
faster circulation of the gases this method could be 
made useful. Measurement of the volume of gas remain¬ 
ing, at constant pressure, rather than the pressure at 
constant volume, would be faster and would not in- 
terupt the runs.

The most important factor in these measure¬ 
ments appears to be exact reproduction of the procedure 
in each run. Small differences in the reduction tech¬ 
nique and subsequent storage of the catalyst overnight 
are suspected to affect the rates of carbiding and 
reduction of the the carbide to a considerable extent. 



. 








SUMMARY - 


The surfctce areas of several keiselguhrs 
were measured. The values obtained were of the proper 
order and it was possible to designate "Filter Cell" 
as the best catalyst supporter of those tested on 
this basis. Acid washing was shown to have no effect 
on the surface area of Filter Cell. 

Dhe surface areas of cataLysts, unreduced 
and reduced, were measured and shown not to be the 
controlling factor in catalyst activity. Reduction 
of the catalyst was found to reduce the surface area 
substantially. 

Adsorption of carbon monoxide and hydrogen 
on these catalysts was not measured successfully. No 
significant results could be obtained. 

A method was evolved for the measurement 
of the rate of carbiding and the rate of reduction 
of the carbide on these catalysts. Reproducible 
results were not obtained but some correlation has 
been shown. With a perfected technique the method 
would probably prove successful.
