CHAPTER I 


WHY AND HOW DATA WAS COLLECTED 

This investigation has been made to ascertain the 
status of education throughout the Grande Prairie Inspector¬ 
ate, with the purpose of finding as many factors as possible 
influencing the growth of the young people living within its 
boundaries* 

When one considers the people of the Grande Prairie 
Inspectorate from either a sociological or an educational 
point of view, it becomes apparent that there are children 
who come from very poor homes, far from the railroad or any 
town* Fifty percent of the country homes have no automo¬ 
bile and over fifteen percent of all rural school-age 
children have never visited a town or village. Naturally 
there is lack of understanding when these pupils begin to 
study modern transportation, communication, banking and 
other allied problems found in the Intermediate uourse of 
Studies. 

There are of course children who come from well 
established modern homes. The majority, however, come from 
an average home where the father farms one or two quarters 
of land and has enough equipment to do all his own work. 

Many people think, without considering the subject’s 
many angles, that the pupils of the Grande Prairie area are 
getting the same opportunities of education as the pupils of 
central and southern Alberta. What these people have failed 
to take into account, is the service and the informal

education that children receive from railroads, highways, in¬ 
dustrial centres and the proximity of big markets. Consider 
this letter from a girl of fifteen who found it necessary to 
go into domestic service when she wished to get an education 
that would fit her for specialized work. This is one example 
of many similar letters received from young folk of this 
newly developed territory. 

"I'll not be coming to school any more. I'm going out 
to work because I really have to, in a way. There isn't any¬ 
thing I hate leaving more than school, but I guess I just 
haven't luck with getting an education. There really isn't 
anything I'd like better than to finish school but I have to 
leave all my brothers and sisters. They want me to go to 
school. I'm going to my sister's place at the coast and try 
get a job in Vancouver. I'm sorry, and thankful to you for 
going through all the bother of getting me books and things 
and helping me along. Good-bye, Mrs. _ and say good¬ 

bye to Shiela for me." 


A number of these problems and questions prompted the 
writer to make a comprehensive study of the Grande Prairie 
Inspectorate. It is hoped that this survey will reveal a 
clear and complete picture of the territory whereby some of 
the deficiencies may be studied and in time overcome. The 
least this study can do is to provide a basis for creating 
plans of improvement. 


How Data Was Collected 


Before the middle of May 1942, twelve hundred copies 
of the questionnaire found on page were prepared. One copy 
was sent to every town, village and rural school pupil in 
grades seven to twelve inclusive throughout the Grande Prairie 
Inspectorate. Accompanying the questionnaires was a letter of

explanation to the teacher concerned. 

Mne hundred and forty-one pupils and students answered 
the questionnaire. kach of the forty-eight questions was 
tabulated under appropriate headings and in all cases of doubt 
no entry was made. A questionnaire sent to the teachers was 
likewise summarized. A copy of this questionnaire may be 
found on page 

To become more intimately acquainted with any area, it 
is necessary to know something of its history and its people. 
The two following chapters are devoted to a few historical 
facts closely connected with this study.

CHAPTER II 


THE PEACE RIVER COUNTRY 

For more than a hundred years after the discovery 
of the Peace River country (1792-1793), all communication 
was by means of canoe and river-boat on the Upper ohurchill 
and Athabasca Rivers and Lake Winnipeg. It was a difficult 
journey of several months for the Indian trappers and white 
traders ferrying the season's fur catch to Grand Portage or 
later to Hudson Bay. These northern traffic lanes were 
followed until the beginning of the twentieth century when 
more direct routes were established by w T ay of rail and 
improved roads. 

The discovery of the Peace River area was incidental 
to the fur trade of the Canadian West. The result of 
Alexander MacKenzie's voyage was the establishment of a 
number of trading posts along the river, the nearest to 
Grande Prairie being at Dunvegan. The furs brought from 
the different tribes were sent via Lake Athabasca, Lake 
Winnipeg and the Great Lakes to Montreal. 

The arrival of domestic animals to help transport furs 
and food was also a direct result of the fur trade. The need 
for a more balanced diet influenced men to till the soil for 
many years but during this time, agriculture remained an 
unimportant industry. About 1808 a fur trader at Dunvegan 
sowed small plots of grain for experimental purposes rather 
than for utility. Three and one half acres v;ere under

cultivation in 1829. Agriculture did not develop any more than 
was necessary to satisfy local needs. There was no desire to 
expand and thus to destroy the fur business. 

Family life did not exist as only a few men were re¬ 
quired to carry on the fur trade. However it soon became evi¬ 
dent that the Peace River country had a climate suitable for 
the growing of crops. At Shaftesbury, near the present site of 
Peace River town, the first agricultural settlement of any 
importance was established. The Anglican and Catholic missions 
encouraged farming, hence towards the end of the nineteenth 
century a few farms occupied by half-breeds and a small number 
of white people could be found. As early as 1896, wheat grown 
in the Peace River Country took a prize at the international 
Seed ii-xhibition at Chicago. This was grown on the Anglican 
Mission Farm under the care of Reverend .brick. 

The Elondyke gold rush had its influence on migration. 
Men came by trail as far as Shaftesbury, where they abandoned 
their pack horses for boats and scows. They travelled up the 
Peace and the halfway Rivers, planning to complete their 
journey by crossing the mountains northwest of the Peace. 

Most of them failed to reach the Alondyke. A few of these 
returned to take up land west of the Shaftesbury settlement. 

In the meantime, the fertility and climate of the Peace River 
Country became more widely known. The stories of surveyors, 
traders, gold prospectors and missionaries reached potential

settlers everywhere. The agricultural industry was beginning 
to take shape. 

The growth of population was slow for many years. It 
was a long trek into a new country in the first place* 

Shipping distances to markets discouraged settlers, despite 
the agricultural value of the soil and climate. The few 
established settlers were so widely scattered that many people 
were afraid of the isolation and loneliness that was bound to 
be a part of a new life in the north. The great distances be¬ 
tween farm homes was partly due to the limited rainfall, being 
just over sixteen inches. A large farm was necessary to meet 
the expenses of a home with an average standard of living* 

Low altitude areas which were menaced by frost in the early 
fall and late spring were naturally avoided by settlers. 

These factors combined to make the settlement of the Peace 
River country rather slow. 

In 1890, the railroad reached Edmonton. The land 
through the south part of the province was settling rapidly, 
hence the Peace River Country grew closer to the world. Now 
the settlers began to pierce the intervening stretch of 
forest, muskeg and rough lands to establish two routes. One 
approach was by way of the Athabasca River, Lesser Slave Lake 
and the Peace River Trail; and the other, the Eason Route, 
wound through the barriers of swamps and forest to Sturgeon 
Lake and the Grande Prairie Trail. By 1911, the census^ of

the Peace River Division No. 16 revealed a population of 
approximately twelve hundred white people. 

Naturally the scattered population did not have the 
facilities for a high standard of living. The early settlers 
recall the struggle of those with children to get schools 
established as the bachelors fought it from the start. Be¬ 
cause of factional strife as to location of site, schools 
were delayed from one to ten years. The roads were very poor 
and in many cases were just trails. Notwithstanding these 
difficulties, the early pioneers held church in schools or 
homes at least once a month. There was very little sickness 
during the early days which was fortunate as the distance to 
the nearest doctor was very great indeed* Here is a story 
relating the experiences of one of the first white women in 
the Drande Prairie area. 

"My nearest neighbor was seventy miles away. The 
Bensons of Kleskun Lake had come into the country in 1906 but 
they remained only a few months. Our eldest daughter was 
born in December, 1907. The nearest doctor was 250 miles 
distant at Lesser Slave Lake, and the only person one could 
dignify by the name of nurse was at Spirit River. This 
woman was married to a half-breed minister and she agreed to 
care for me. However, she arrived when the baby was a day 
old and did the best she could." 

Schools were very slowly organized and many times were 
established too late to be of much jise to the children of the 
first settlers. Mr. W. D. Albright, superintendent of the 
Beaverlodge Experimental Farm, tells of the difficulties of 
the Beaverlodge district in early days, notwithstanding the 
fact that this district had definite advantages of location 
and soil fertility. In the beginning, the settlement was

made up of four families, augmented later by sixteen families 
from Ontario who had dissented from the Methodist Church in 
Canada* Having a religious organization already, they helped 
the settlers to establish a district and open a school, even 
though there was no inspector and the mail came once a month. 

There was no lack of friendliness and hospitality, but 
distances, lack of roads and conveyances contributed to iso¬ 
lation and loneliness. The store, the schools, churches and 
homes had spasmodic and infrequent meetings. On July 1st, 
all the settlers, washed and unwashed, came in wagons, buck- 
boards, horseback and on foot. Celebrations sometimes lasted 
for days. Indians, half-breeds and whites played together. 
During the day there were races, games, stunts on horseback 
and many other forms of amusements. At night, a platform 
served as a dance hall where all took part in the Red River 
reels and Jigs. 

The construction of the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British 
Columbia Railway from Edmonton to Peace River and the extension 
built from McLennan to Spirit River and later to Grande Prairie 
in 1916 created a stir and raised the hopes of men. Land 
fever went on the rampage and the price of land reached dizzy 
figures. Real-estate agents, some honest and others not, did 
a land-slide business. These agents painted pictures, most 
beautiful to the imagination, of large cities to be built here 
and there in the Dorth. Some came to stay, some to buy land 
and sell it at a profit and others to appraise the true possi¬ 
bilities of an unknown land. Thus the Peace River area gained

many new settlers who would not have considered the venture a 
few years earlier* 

Demobilization in Europe, soldier- 3 ettlement schemes, 
continued high wheat prices and widespread publicity of this 
north country combined to swell the tide of migration* But 
this did not continue for long. 

During 1921-1925 the Peace River Country lost more 
people than it gained. Prices of agricultural products de¬ 
creased, while freight rates increased. 1924 was a dry year. 
The price of machinery was so high that a number of small land 
owners sold or rented their land to one who would be able to 
farm it. This meant that many original settlers became large 
land owners with even greater distances between neighbors. In 
the meantime, however, roads were cut, keeping pace fairly 
well with the development of the railroad. From 1922 and on, 
Government, agricultural, railroad and commercial interests 
united to speed up the settlement of the country. 

About the time when settlement recession was causing 
considerable alarm, the Wembley district produced a wheat king, 
Herman Trelle. Trelle was interested in pure wheat strains 
which would be most suitable to the Peace River Country. His 
first prizes were won in 1922. Since that time he has won 
distinction in the national and international competitions, 
hence his name and that of the Peace River became famous. The 
daily press described his achievements in the most glowing 
terms. Here are some of the statements which appeared in the 
press at that time.^

"The Peace River development will double the population 
of Vancouver." 

"The Peace River district is capable of producing 
500,000,000 bushels of grain annually." 

"The Peace River district is a young man’s country with 
unlimited opportunity." 

Many of the statements were extreme but some of the 
prophecies came true. The country can support a large popula¬ 
tion and according to the Dominion survey made during the 
summer of 1942 under the direction of Mr. K. Acton, this 
country will see further and quite rapid development as soon 
as the war is over. The potential advantages of the Alaska 
Highway and its contributions to further development will play 
an important role. There are beautiful spots and fertile 
regions but the many submarginal areas must not be forgotten. 
The men and women who are living on these lands today have had 
and are still having a hard struggle. 

From one point of view at least, Grande Prairie is the 
centre of the region south of the Peace River and it may be 
said that this town’s commercial and social institutions have 
penetrated north of the Peace more than those of Peace River 
have penetrated south. Grande Prairie has headquarters of 
regional supervision for banks and insurance companies, of 
provincial agricultural representatives and a modern munici¬ 
pal hospital. It has the best equipped High School in the 
North Country. On the other hand. Peace River is still the 
centre of the fur trading industry. It is the headquarters

of the Anglican Bishop and is the land settlement headquarters 
for the entire area. The town is the supply centre and shipping 
point for northern posts. It is ideally located on the Peace 
at the break of rail and water transportation. More Indians and 
half-breeds live and visit there than in any other town in the 
entire region. It is an interesting place, full of memories and 
fur trade traditions that will never die.

EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS 

The education of children in areas not organized into 
school districts has always been a matter of individual con¬ 
cern. During the early part of the Peace River settlement, a 

certain amount of education was offered by the mission schools 

1 

with special attention to Indian children. Some parents 
attempted to give instruction in the home or made arrangements 
with others, perhaps neighbors, to teach their children. The 
Department of Education organized a correspondence branch 
which has given instruction to hundreds of pupils of the 
elementary and high school grades. These efforts usually re¬ 
sult in the organization of a school district. 

The organization of a pioneer school depended upon 
certain factors - the number of ratepayers in a district, the 
initiative of the local settlers and the assessment of the 
proposed area. The first school house is easily recognized. 

It was constructed of logs, was poorly equipped and poorly 
heated. The room was spacious, measuring about £4 by 3U feet, 
the size depending upon the needs of the ratepayers and the 
available timber. The building itself was usually hastily 
constructed so that the air was always fresh but too cold for 
comfort during the winter. The floor was made of native ship- 
lap which dried leaving cracks large enough to admit mice. 

T 

The St. Francis Xavier Residential School at Sturgeon Lake 
has over one hundred Indian children in regular attendance. 
Three teachers are giving instruction.

Inside, the logs were left in rounded form. The blackboard 
was small and homemade, thus the teacher was often instructed 
to use it sparingly in order to preserve the surface coating. 
The pupils' desks were homemade and uncomfortable, notv/itb- 
standing their complicated construction. After a year's use 
the nails tore the children's clothes as the heat and cold 
ceused the nails to protrude. The teacher was fortunate if a 
homemade desk and chair were provided for her use. The 
library was practically a nonentity, hith very little extra 
equipment, the teacher was left to her own resources. 

Before the formation of the Divisions throughout this 
country, a number of schools were operated during the summer 
months as the districts concerned were not able to pay their 
teachers during the full school year. After the formation of 
the Orande Prairie Division, these schools have operated 
during the full school year and all expenses related to their 
operation are paid by the Division. During the early days 
the teachers were poorly paid and in many cases had to wait 
two or three years before getting their salaries in full, 
thus the teachers seldom stayed for more than one or two 
years. The boarding place in many districts was, and still 
is, a problem, where the homes are small buildings of two or 
three rooms. 'This fact alone frequently explains why some 
teachers stay such a short while. Delay in building the first 
school, short terms of school's operation, frequent changes of 
teachers and poor road conditions all combined to retard the 
educational development of this area when compared to the

progress made in well-established and more favoured communities. 

The school was erected by means of voluntary labour of 
the ratepayers concerned. To finish the building, JlbO.UO 
grant was given by the Department of education. Local effort 
plus a maximum grant of ^500.00 per year provided the cost of 
operation. Taxes were very hard to collect as the settlers 
were poor, hence large arrears of texes were quite common. 

With the growth of the community more taxes were collectable. 

The school became better equipped and higher salaries were 
paid if the local board possessed vision with respect to the 
value of a good teacher, Many local boards levied such a 
small mill rate that the school plant and the wages paid to 
the teacher were neglected. As the community developed, roads 
improved and villages began to support a high school room. 

This manner of establishing schools in pioneer days is much 
the same plan used in outlying districts at the present time. 

The Department of Education of Alberta has a definite 
policy with regard to the establishment of a school district. 

A district may be formed in any part of the province provided 
that there are eight children between the ages of five and 
sixteen who are living in the area considered. The length and 
width of the district should not exceed four miles. The num¬ 
ber of residents who are liable for school taxes must be at 
least four. Organization takes place when three residents 
petition the department and the boundaries have been approved 
by the Minister of Education. A vote is usually authorized 
to determine whether the people of the district are behind the

proposal. Bitter arguments often erise between men with 

families and those who are single or childless. In one 
2 

district now organized and operating, it took eleven years 
to settle the quarrels. In the majority of cases, however, 
the people are co-operative. Another grant of $15.00 to 
$30.00 per year is given during the first five years of oper¬ 
ation to help establish a suitable library. The inspector of 
schools, now known as the superintendent, acts in a consulta¬ 
tive capacity and may organize a district in absence of local 
petitioners. 

Notwithstanding special aid given to newly organized 

districts, the history of those throughout the Grande Prairie 

area was sad. On the establishment of the .Division in 1938, 

fifty-six districts had a combined debt of more than sixty 

thousand dollars, of which seventeen thousand were arrears of 

teachers* salaries. Thirty-seven districts were in a sound 

financial position but of these, twenty-three had neglected 

to keep a well-built school in good repair, or had made no 

effort to replace a poor building with a new up-to-date 
3 

structure. The amount of debt varied from a few hundred 
dollars to twenty-six hundred. Services of some teachers who 
had responded to advertisements were unsatisfactory.

Sometimes, assistance in hiring teachers was secured from the 
local inspector or from the Department of Education. Today, 
the divisional board and the superintendent work together in 
the matter of securing teachers and allocating them to their 
respective schools. Thus outlying districts, theoretically, 
have a better opportunity to receive efficient instruction, 
but in practice this may or may not be true. All teachers 
gravitate to the towns and villages, hence it would be unfair 
to keep a good teacher against her wishes in an outlying 
school. This means that the outlying districts are receiving 
the services of young teachers with little or no experience. 
On the positive side of the picture, these districts by join¬ 
ing the school division are getting teaching service for the 
same length of time as any other school. 

During 1930, tw r o inspectors served the Peace River 
country with 106 and 101 school districts in their respective 
territories, each of which extended from three hundred to 
four hundred miles. Limited railroad facilities and very 
poor roads added to the difficulties of supervising these 
areas. The amount of time given to each school could be at 
best, only a few hours, thus little guidance could be given 
to the inexperienced teachers. 'The inspectors could not give 

adequate supervision when so many duties demanded attention.

Today, there are four superintendents in the Peace 
River area, which indicates that the number of schools has

increased and that the country has developed correspondingly. 

1 

There are three hundred and eighteen districts now operating. 
Two of the territories, the Peace River and Fairview Inspec¬ 
torates, are relatively small but large enough to keep a 
superintendent very busy. ihe Grande Prairie Inspectorate has 
115 districts, eighty-seven of which are located in the Grande 
Prairie Division. The opirit River and McLennan Inspectorate 
forms an elongated area of eighty-nine districts which 
stretches from Lesser Slave Lake to the British Columbia boun¬ 
dary. It can be seen that the amount of supervision in these 
territories is not adequate and in this respect, very little 
improvement can be noticed during the last twenty years. 

On the other hand there is another side to the growth 
of the Grande Prairie Inspectorate. Lore facilities have been 
provided in the older settlements. School fairs were held in 
three centres, Grande Prairie, Sexsmith and Valhalla Centre. 
These have now been discontinued but there is no doubt that 
some other form of organization will take its place after the 
war. The musical festival which is held in Grande Prairie 
will be in its eleventh year next May. Interest this year 
seems higher than ever. The syllabus includes vocal and 
instrumental solos and duets, dramatics and elocution, church 
choirs, rhythm bands and choral speech. 

The annual track meet has become a part of school life. 
Throughout the inspectorate, eleven elimination centres of

CHAPTER IV 


THE PARENTS 

it has been said that the pioneer of the early days 
was an individual who had the spirit of adventure, and the 
courage and vision to see things through regardless of sacri¬ 
fice and hardship. He was an outstanding example of self- 
sufficiency and daring, one who had no fear of the unknown, 
kany of the parents, men or women, of the children studied, 
belong to this class. 

in 1897 came the Gold Rush to the Yukon. Large parties 
of Americans, in the hope of discovering some overland route 
to this new Eldorado of the Worth, came across the border and 
passing through Calgary and Edmonton reached the Peace River 
country. A number of these went no further, and with those 
who came later, the Americans make up approximately twenty per¬ 
cent of the adult population. Question 23 asked the pupils to 
give the land of the father’s birth, rhe results are tabulated 
in table I.

Americans and Canadians, although born in either the United 
States or in Canada, who cannot speak English. It is to be 
regretted that people who have lived in an -nglish speaking 
country all their lives cannot speak the language. In any 
school where the children from such homes make up the majority 
of the children enrolled, the teacher has a hard problem to 
solve, for the influence of the majority is noticeable. 

Language of The People 

The writer was interested in finding out the percentage 
of homes of European parentage using -nglish at all times. 

The answers to question 30 of the pupils 1 questionnaire were 
tabulated after observing the answer each pupil had given to 
question 23. Table II gives a summary of the findings. It 
will be observed that 33 c jo of European homes use the English 
language entirely. This means that approximately one-third 
of the men from European countries make an effort to speak 
English in their homes. Apparently two-thirds of the men and 
women have made little effort to learn English, which is 
regrettable. Fifty-two percent of the rural foreign homes 
use English at all times as compared to twenty-eight percent 
in towns and villages. The homes referred to in the preced¬ 
ing sentence represent the pupils from the intermediate grades 
as it was realized that a number of students in the high 
school grades came directly from the rural areas. 

On first thought, one might be of the opinion that the 
environment of towns and villages would induce these Europ¬ 
eans to learn English more speedily than their countrymen who

the country plan to make their homes in that area and thus 
wish to be in a position to discuss agricultural problems with 
their English neighbors. Their recreation and social life is 
closely allied to that of their neighbors, hence the incentive 
to learn English is that much greater. There are more commun¬ 
ity get-togethers. Their children are playing with English- 
speaking pupils and as interest in other boys and girls is 
genuine, English is learned. In the towns and villages, the 
foreign-born men and women have a tendency to visit among 
themselves. Probably the fact that they are too poor to dress 
in the fashion of others in their neighborhood has something 
todo with this practice. It is easier to get along in town 
without English as there are fewer common problems between the 
English-speaking group and the foreign one. The tendency of 
foreign homes to use English at all times is slightly greater 
when high school pupils are considered. As the number of cases 
studied is small, little reliance may be placed on this conclu¬ 
sion although it might be expected in view of the fact that the 
parents have been in this country a correspondingly longer 
time. It is also interesting to notice that the mothers are 
less proficient in the use of English than are the fathers. 

The men encourage this state of affairs in some homes as they 
still have their old country ideas of the relative status of 
men and women; the men are the breadwinners and the women run 
the affairs of the household. 

How long have these European fathers lived in Canada? 

The answers to number 32 of the questionnaire indicate that 
only twenty-one percent have lived in this country for less

than fifteen years while the remaining seventy-nine percent 
have lived here from sixteen to thirty-five years. The average 
man or woman can learn to speak English quite well in three to 
five years, hence there is little excuse for the plea, "We 
have been in this country Just a short time." The data also 
indicates that the more recent immigrants have learned English 
as well as, or possibly better than, the older foreign settlers. 
In some cases the older men have realized their mis take with 
the result that they have advised the younger ones to learn 
the language. 

It is fitting to ascertain the percentage of children 
from foreign homes who can speak their mother tongue, question 
31 asks for this information. While tabulating the answers to 
this question, care was taken to observe the answer given to 
number 23 in order that the results would be more accurate, 
for it can be readily seen that an affirmative answer would not 
mean anything if the child came from an English home and had 
not read question 31 carefully.

The results tabulated in table III vary a great deal 
but they indicate that a high percentage of the children in 
the group studied understand their mother tongue. If the 
number of cases studied had been greater, no doubt there 
would be more uniformity. Over seventy percent of all the 
pupils coming from a foreign home can speak their own language 
while a much smaller percentage have the ability to write 
their mother tongue. Eo record was kept of this ability. 

Parent Education 

Approximately one-tenth of the adult population does 
not understand English well, so that record cards, reports of 
progress and modern ideas of education are all strange to this 
group. The teacher*s effort in connection with any one of 
these items is wasted. Ko attempt has been made to help the 
foreigners or to persuade them to learn the language. Time, 
effort and financial assistance should be available to overcome 
this waste of time and to give these new Canadians a good know¬ 
ledge of English. 

Liany parents from English-speaking countries require

guidance. The parent who writes "BUNK” on the report of pro¬ 
gress form, sums up his opinion very briefly and insultingly, 
but this does not promote the education of his child. It 
does not help to improve the relations betv/een the parents 
and the school. i'ime and money should be devoted to give the 
parents an opportunity to understand. If the salaries of 
teachers were large enough to attract young men and women of 
vision, courage and ability, study groups could be organized 
to discuss and to eliminate many misunderstandings. As it is, 
the majority of the parents compare the Progressive system of 
education with that of their own school days. 

irrom study groups there would emerge definite suggest¬ 
ions which might be more practical and more fitting than some 
of the principles now in use. Parents, teachers and other 
educators would learn together. They would recognize the 
teacher as a leader. They would realize the need for certain 
equipment rather than regarding the request for such material 
with suspicion. No one questions the fact that milk is 
necessary to support the life of children but when tools for 
general shop or domestic science courses are required for the 
boys and girls who are not benefitted by an Academic pro¬ 
gramme, there is strong opposition. All teachers should have 
the courage and vision to lead in the education of the 
adults with respect to modern trends of the present programmes 
of studies. They should be missionaries of education, free to 
advocate its principles without fear. However, every man or 
woman who is now a teacher is not capable of giving this type

of valuable service, hence it is imperative that the salaries 
be large enough to attract teachers better suited for leader- 

sh ip.

If it is assumed that the Grande Prairie area repre¬ 
sents a more or less average territory, then our present 
educational system is inadequate in its preparation of Canada’s 
future farmers. The boys should have an opportunity during 
the adolescent age to study agriculture. ihis would mean that 
more agricultural colleges would have to be set up or provision 
w r ould have to be made for a number of short-term courses every 
year. These young men who plan to be agriculturalists require 
guidance in tlacksmithing, carpentry, rotation of crops, 
animal husbandry etc. Correct methods eliminate wasted time

and energy as well as amateur use of farm machinery. The 
present programme in the Grande Prairie Inspectorate is defin¬ 
itely academic as can be seen in uhapter VI, The picture is not 
much brighter when the skilled workmen are considered for if ft is 
assumedthat ten percent of the young men wish to learn a trade, 
there is no provision for such training unless they con afford 
to go to the city. very few parents are financially able to 
provide their sons with this opportunity,

is assumed that 65$ are required for domestic purposes, then 
they should be given a home-making course. It is realized that 
65$ is high, but whatever the percentage that group is not 
getting adequate help from the academic programme. Domestic 
ocience courses would be an invaluable asset to every mother, 
but under the present educational set-up, this guidance is not 
given. 

Summary of Answers to Questions 24 to 29 Inclusive 

hinety-three percent of the parents on farms were gain¬ 
fully employed throughout 1926 to 1941, while 87$ of the men 
in the towns and villages had work. Over 90$ of the farmers 
work for themselves, owning their own farms and homes. In 
the towns 68$ v/ork for themselves, 90$ own a business or re¬ 
ceive a good salary and 72$ own a home. In the country only 
50$ own an automobile as compared to 58$ in the towns and 
villages. Twenty-three percent of the farmers carry insur¬ 
ance while 52$ of the townsmen carry this protection. 

On the average, even prior to the war, the adults of 
the Grande Prairie Inspectorate were gainfully employed whether 
they lived in the country or in the towns. There were cases 
where the profit was so little that the people concerned be¬ 
came discouraged but the total so affected was a small minor¬ 
ity. Gainful employment of the vast majority is conducive to 
progress. 

The low percentage of farmers who do not carry insur¬ 
ance is revealing. These men should be educated as to the 
value of protecting their families against times of need.

They should be urged and assisted in formulating a scheme to 
protect their incomes during years of crop failure. The farmer 
is one of the hardest to convince when such co-operation is the 
topic considered. Education in living together, in helping one 
another socially and economically cannot be complete without 
education as to the value of co-operation to the group of which 
he forms a part. The educationist can work on the child but he 
has the pupil for only four or five hours a day. The other 
eighteen hours are spent in the environment of his own home 
where the rugged individualist impregnates the child with his 
theory. This does not imply that any particular farmer makes 
it his business to teach the child "Let each one look out for 
himself." It merely asserts that the child will naturally 
incorporate such theories into his own make-up. 

It has been stated that ninety percent of the parents 

own their own land, but that is not quite the full story. 

Around fifty-four percent of these farms are mortgaged with 

1 

small and large debts. Automobile dealers report that approxi¬ 
mately forty percent of the cars are not fully paid for, whether 
the owner lives in the town or country. 

In spite of the high percentage of employment among the 
people of the Grande Prairie area, it is clear that the net 
profit of the majority of homes is small. This directly 
affects education. High school and technical instruction is 
not free, so that many boys and girls in the inspectorate will 
have no opportunity of taking advanced courses.

There are 87 more girls than boys considered in this 
rence increases through the higher grades 
until in Grade 12, there are only 18 boys out of a total of 
69 pupils. 

.Vorking with the figures of table VI some conclusions 
may be drawn as to the relative opportunities of higher edu¬ 
cation received by boys and by girls. In the Grande Prairie 
area, there were 114 more girls than boys attending the upper 
grades, that is from 9 to 12 inclusive, as Grade 9 may be con¬ 
sidered a definite step toward higher education. Out of the 
total of 464 pupils there were 175 boys, which represents 38$ 
of the school population of the group studied. Alberta school 

statistics show that the boys make up 45$ of the provincial 

1 

enrolment in the grades considered. The attendance of boys in 
these grades in the Grande Prairie area is 7$ less than in the 
province as a whole. This fact can be stated in another way. 
There were 6 b)o more girls than there were boys attending the 
upper grades in the Grande Prairie Inspectorate. Referring 
again to the Alberta school statistics, it is found that there 
were approximately 25$ more girls than boys in the four grades, 
which disparity is 40$ less than in the Grande Prairie area. 

If the boys and girls received equal opportunities of 
acquiring higher training, it must be assumed that equal num¬ 
bers of boys and girls attended educational institutions. 
Provincial figures show that Alberta has not reached this

educational achievement. After studying the findings of table 
VT it is clear that the boys of the Grande Prairie area are 
not getting an average provincial opportunity of attending 
classes in the upper grades. 

Table VII was prepared to determine the relative oppor¬ 
tunities of pupils in the Grande Prairie Inspectorate and 

pupils in the province to complete Grade XII. As the total of 

1 

pupils has been approximately the same in the inspectorate 

2 

during the last three years and in the province for the same 
period of time, it can be assumed that the total number in the 
different grades to the total pupil population will indicate a 
reliable ratio. For example there were 163,425 pupils in the 
province attending school during 1940-41 of which 7153 were 
taking grade 12. This represents 4.4$. In the Grande Prairie 
area, 69 pupils out of 3,137 were taking grade 12. This 
represents 2.2/*?. The following table summarizes the findings.

It will be seen that the percentage of pupils attending 
high school in the area studied is much less than the provin¬ 
cial average. Considering the separate grades, the attendance 
in Crade 10 in this area is 71$ of the provincial enrolment 
for that grade, 67$ of the provincial attendance in Crade 11, 
and only 50$ in grade 12. As it happens, the percentages in 
Crade 9 compare favourably, but this only signifies that the 
average boy or girl in the Crande Prairie area has equal oppor¬ 
tunity to take grade nine when compared with that of the 
province. *>hat happens after the examinations have been 
written is another matter. 

Theoretically, approximately 8£$ of the total number of 
pupils should graduate from high school or other advanced 
institutions, hence the percentages given in table VII are low 
in either case. Even if all young men and women who are 
taking technical education are added or accounted for, the 
argument still holds. How will the percentage be affected? 
During 1940-41 there were approximately one thousand men and 
women taking advanced training in the technical schools. When 
this is added to 7,153 and calculated the percentage is 5.2, 
which is still low. 


Retardation 

Are the pupils of the Crande Prairie area retarded? In 
order that some comparisons might be made, a table was made 
showing the average age of all pupils according to sex and 
grade. The average age was calculated to the nearest month 
and all cases of doubt were not included in the computations.

will thus be possible to make comparisons to provincial 
averages as the data contained in the annual reports are

The high school girls on the average seem to be a little 
older for their grades than are the boys. Is this a sign of 
retardation in the girls? Investigation shows that this may 
not be true in every instance as many girls in this part of the 
north stay home for one or two years until the father is in a 
position to send his daughter to high school. In grade nine, 
many of the boys ride long distances to attend classes where 
grade nine has been authorized, but this would not be feasible 
for most girls in a similar position. The findings in the 
higher grades are in agreement with the results of most in¬ 
vestigations. Around the age of fourteen boys become acceler¬ 
ated in their mental abilities and generally surpass the girls 
in rational thinking. 

The problem of retardation is closely related to the 
rate at which settlement has taken place. When new settlers 
come in one by one, the establishment of a school district may 
be delayed from five to ten years, which naturally retards 
education in outlying areas. But is it to be expected that 
the average boy and girl is retarded in the Grande Prairie 
area at the present time? Table IX is arranged in such a way 
that a comparison with the province can be made. The average 
age of the pupils in a certain grade was secured from the 
annual report of the Department of Education, 1941. 

It appears that the pupils of the Grande Prairie rural 
and town areas are older for their grades than are the pupils 
for the province as a whole. This is a reliable index of 
retardation. There is an exception in Grade nine rural but 
the difference is not very great. It is hardly possible that

the pupils in the Grande Prairie rural are asked to meet 
higher or lower standards before being promoted, hence the 
degree of difficulty should be about the same. It might mean 
that these pupils have a little less grounding, or that geo¬ 
graphical or economic factors tend to cause retardation. 

Another index of retardation is obtained when the 
percentage in each grade which is under age, normal or over¬ 
age is considered. Average age is used to calculate the 
number who are in the normal group. Table X, columns 3 and 4 
reveal that the percentage of children who are under age in 
each grade in the Grande Prairie area is negligible with

trades XI and XII excepted. The percentages of normal aged 
children in this area is less than are the corresponding figures 
for the province v.ith Grades 9 (rural), 8 (town) and 12 excepted.

The general trend however shows that there are propor¬ 
tionately fewer pupils of normal age in the Grande Prairie 
Inspectorate than there are in the province. ..hen columns 7 
and 8 are checked, all grades with the exceptions of Grades 
9 and 12 have a greater percentage of over age pupils. Al¬ 
though the pupils are not greatly retarded, there is definite 
indication that they are not up to average. There is no 
doubt in the writer’s mind that this retardation is a result 




















* 

















.

of inadequate educational facilities throughout the area. The 
retardation could be due to lack of intelligence but this is 
hardly probable when the group considered co::.ls frc such a 
large area. This study will not reveal any information on 
this particular problem but it seems reasonably safe to assume 
that the average ability of this area is equal to that of any 
other part of the province and that any difference which might 
be found would not materially affect the conclusion.

Table XI was made to compare the examination results of 

Grade IX students of the Grande Prairie Inspectorate and of 

the province. Passes in the Grande Prairie area during the 

last three examination years were 86,i, 84^ and 94$J respectively. 

1 

The provincial average for 1929-40 was 82.53>b. This substan¬ 
tiates the assumption that the pupils of this area cannot be 
said to be retarded because of lack of ability.

CHAPTER VI 


PUPILS* ATTITUDE iC Vi ARDS ADVANCED -DU C AIT ON 

Do pupils in general desire to complete a high school 
education? The pupils were asked this question in number 8 of 
the questionnaire. Table XII gives a summary according to 
grade and sex. It is realized that a number of these pupils 
who are of the opinion that they want to get a high school 
education will change their minds, but the converse of this is 
also true.

A high percentage of the pupils in the Grande Prairie 
Inspectorate have signified their desire to complete their 
schooling, which will be academic if they remain in this area. 
Table XII also reveals that more and more pupils, as the grades 
get higher, see the value of going to school. No doubt many 
who have difficulty in school and are discouraged over finish¬ 
ing Grade 12 would be glad to attend a vocational school. The 
table shows that the town boys and girls are more desirous of 
completing their education than are the rural pupils. Better 
facilities, short distances to school and a fuller social life 
induce the urban children to continue. Town parents are not 
obliged to extra expense as the children can live at home, 
whereas country pupils coming to a town school have to make 
boarding arrangements, Eany rural parents, notwithstanding the 
fact that they can afford to pay for board and room, do not 
favour having the children so far away from home influence, nor 
do they wish to live alone. Education is stressed in youth 
organizations in towns, and these youth training groups have a 
great influence. The example of older pupils and friends con¬ 
tinuing their education persuades younger students to follow in 
their footsteps. 

Eighty-five percent of all pupils throughout this area 
have signified a wish to take courses above Grade 9. Y^hat are 
their chances of realizing this wish? The findings of table 
XIII indicate that many pupils are thwarted in their ambition 
to get even a partial higher education. The pupils were asked 
in question 9 to indicate whether circumstances would allow 
them to continue their training, wdiich survey is covered in 


table XIII.

Pupils are not in a position to give accurate informa¬ 
tion. Some who considered that they will attend high school, 
but will have to leave early will balance more or less with the 
number of those who felt that they could not go and will find 
that it is possible later. Of the pupils in the intermediate 
grades who reported a desire to take further instruction, only 
78$ expressed a favourable opinion. In high school 89$ were

certain that they would be able to attend and this should be 
quite accurate as many were in their last year. However this 
leaves eleven out of every hundred unuble to complete their 
studies. It should be noted that 81 $ of the boys in all grades 
desire to complete their education as compared to 69$ of the 
girls. The latter are more interested in advanced education. 

At this point, it might be v.ell to find out what oppor¬ 
tunities the older brothers and sisters had when they v/ent to 
school. The material was gathered from the answers given to 
questions 34, 35 and 36 and from table XIV seventeen hundred 
and seventy-three boys and girls were found to be older than 
the cases studied. Cf these, 1363 had left school, hence 410 
of the older ones were attending school as at June 30th, 1942.

It can be seen that 18.2$ left school with less than a 
grade eight education while 64$ did not take any high school 
education at all. The greatest number of pupils left school 
at grade eight. 3o pupils have a better chance to get an 
advanced education now than did the older brothers and sisters? 
Yes they do. From table XIII it was found that 78$ of the 
pupils in the intermediate grades believe they will have an

opportunity to take advanced training. The picture is far 
brighter for the younger brothers and 3isters. The Grande 
Prairie area is getting more and more settled. The pioneer 
stage is falling behind and parents are becoming more edu¬ 
cation-minded. 

Question 10 asked for remarks of explanation from pupils 
who considered themselves unable to complete high school even 
though desirous of doing so. These answers form table XV. All 
modifying statements of ”1 think" were excluded from the table.

Lack of financial backing is the greatest obstacle and as there 
are no scholarships provided for these people, it may be con¬ 
cluded that it will be impossible for them to finish high 
school. Opportunity of returning to school often comes after 
a year or two, but usually it is refused as it is hard for any¬ 
one to settle down to the routine of studying, after an absence 
from it. The communities of alberta ere losing potential 
assets. Confidential reports from the principals and teachers 
support this statement. 

Those who are needed at home nay be considered from two 
points of view:- 

1. Present world conditions make it impossible to hire 
men, hence the sons and daughters are doing full or 
part-time work. 

2. An estimated 30$ of those needed at home probably 
means that financial circumstances will not permit 
higher education. An aggregate of 168 pupils out 
of 940 in the Grande Prairie Inspectorate will not 
have the opportunity to get advanced instruction. 

This represents 18$. 

Table XVI indicates the encouragement received by the 
pupils to continue school. It will be noticed that the per¬ 
centage is high throughout. The average is 96/0. Those who are 
already in high school would be expected to answer"yes"except 
in unusual cases. On the average, the pupils in towns and 
villages have received more encouragement than those who live 
in rural communities but the difference is too small to draw 
any conclusion.

were their intention to leave school as soon as the fifteenth 
birthday was reached. table XVII sum. .arizes the findings.

fifteen, so it is safe to say that the 85 /j of the pupils v/ho

greater number intended to leave school in rural areas than 
in the towns and villages. Probably this is because unskilled 
work is more plentiful in rural areas. Also, there are few 
influences and examples in a scattered community to encourage 
pupils to continue school training* 

The answers to question 13 form table XVIII. From it 
is learned the percentage of pupils who have plans for the 
future. Probably the pupils of Grade 7 are too young to know 
anything definite about their vocational desires, but even 
so 60$ of the grade seven pupils say that they have a plan. 
There is no doubt that these ideas for the future will change 
but so do older people alter their means of livelihood. Rural 
boys and girls are not quite as certain about their plans as 
are those who live in towns and villages, curing Grade 9 and 
the succeeding years, more girls than boys have made their 
plans. It is hard to estimate how many pupils have expressed

a fancy as to their considered vocation, but it must be assumed 
that they have expressed themselves honestly. The table indi¬ 
cates that 24# of the entire group have no plans. Lvery pupil 
should have something concrete in mind, whether it may or may 
not materialize. Pupils are not getting the required guidance 
to help them formulate plans. To substantiate this statement, 
Table ttx was summarized from the pupils 1 responses to question 
15 which asked - "Have you received advice on what you should

The pupils reported that all three agents had given aid 
in many cases, hut it is only a conservative one-half of the 
vocational guidance needed. It is hard to believe that these 
young people have received such inadequate guidance from their 
teachers. What are the reasons? 

1. i*any teachers are themselves unacquainted with the 
different vocations and neglect to make it their business to 
find out. 

2. A majority of teachers do little professional 
reading. 

3. A number of teachers are not sufficiently interested 
in children and do not realize the value of professional train¬ 
ing in furthering the pupils 1 vocational aptitudes. 

4. Too often, ambitious young people suited for leader¬ 
ship are not attracted by the teaching profession in which 
salaries are inadequate of meeting the expense of future training.

Taxpayers refuse to recognize this fact and they fight any idea 
of raising teachers 1 salaries. This indicates an absence of 
educational interest among the parents. 

It should be mentioned that the writer does not insin¬ 
uate that the teachers are neglecting to promote such training 
'berately. The teachers thei 1 s need more training in 
vocational guidance. 

The answers to question 14 were tabulated under nine 
headings to make table XX, a survey of vocations chosen by 
pupils of the Grande Prairie Inspectorate. If any child showed 
doubt in his answer, no entry was made. Teaching seems to be 
most popular and this is understandable. ..hen children have

confidence in their teachers leadership, it is one form of hero 
worship to decide to become teachers. The miscellaneous group 
mentioned in the table represents thirty different vocations, 
hence the total number of vocations indicated by the pupils was 
thirty-eight. The children were unaware of the work involved 
in some of these vocations. The general impression after tabu¬ 
lating the results was that rural pupils are less interested in 
farming in the higher grades. The interest v/as not high in any 
case. Very little interest was shown in transportation or 
communication. trades were barely mentioned. Ko doubt these 
omissions are due to the fact that there are no facilities to 
promote these interests, and teachers are lacking in general 
knowledge to arouse the pupils* curiosity. In spite of the war 
which is now in its fourth year, the pupils do not realize the 
positions available in factories. i*ore information on the many 
vocations of life should be presented by the teachers to allow 
pupils to more wisely select the work for which they feel them¬ 
selves best fitted. 

Questions 16, 17 and 18 were seeking to find out what 
knowledge young people have of their own talents and abilities 
and its bearing upon the choice of a vocation. The findings 
support the writer’s contention that pupils are not getting 
adequate vocational guidance. The intermediate grades showed 
indecision, naturally, due to immaturity, oixty percent of 
the high school pupils have definite ideas on the subject, but 
this is not a true indication. Tothing conclusive can be 
drawn from pupils who believe that they can make efficient

secretaries because of neatness and correct spelling, or that 
an architect needs only to be good at designing. Cn question¬ 
ing several young men who planned to become doctors, not one 
realized the cost of training nor the length of preparation. 

Is Advanced education Iecessary? 

Table XXI was prepared from answers to question 19 to 
determine how many pupils are convinced that an advanced edu¬ 
cation is necessary for everyone, eighty-five percent are of 
the opinion that a high school education is necessary.

No doubt there are many of the 15 ,j who would be delighted to 
have the opportunity of taking advanced education in a 
technical school. 

V*hat objections do these pupils give? A few of those 
prove interesting and will again reveal the need for more 
thorough teacher and parent guidance, l’he following ere 
quotations. 

1. i as not got the brains to sc 

school education. I am one of them.” 

2. ”A farmer does not need an education. He can get 

along nicely without it." 

3. "There is no use to have an education when you 

don’t want to go farther in life.” 

4. "One can work himself up in a profession without 

schooling • ” 

5. "You can do without education because you get along 

alright without it." 

6. "Although education is a big help, there are people 

who make good without it." 

7. "oome jobs require a different kind of education." 

(iwenty pupils gave this answer, these pupils rea¬ 
lize that the present educational system has 

deficiencies•) 

8. "People do not learn from books. A farmer can get 

along without it." 

9. "If all ] re educated there would be no one 

left to farm." 

On the other hand, why do 85$» of the pupils believe an 
education is necessary? Over 50 c /o of the positive answers to 
question 19 did not express themselves clearly enough to en¬ 
able the writer to understand them, hence no record of these 
was made. Here are some of the typical replies which were 


recorded:

1. "education can be used anywhere and at anytime," 

2. "education is a preparation for living." 

This answer was given by three pupils. 

• , an earn an easier living." 

Fifteen percent of the | gave this answer. 

4. "education helps you to get any Job you want." 

Around thirty-five percent of the pupils gave 

this answer. 

5. "’..ithout education you cannot be anything but a 

farmer and I don't want to bo one." 

6. "An education is necessary to meet social 

requirements." This answer was given by seven 

high school students. 

The rural pupils do not, on the whole, realize that 
the most progressive farmers are those who have had a very 
good education. To become an efficient farmer demands organ¬ 
ization, forethought and practical economics of the highest 
order. The rural school teacher should do more to help these 
boys and girls to understand a fanner's responsibilities more 
clearly.

has practically disappeared and more emphasis is being placed 
on French, stenography is not a popular subject as other 
commercial subjects are not offered at the same time. The 
principals have given information to the effect that there is 
a heavy demand for commercial subjects, but lack of space, 
equipment and properly qualified teachers will not permit the 
inclusion of these subjects to a degree which will help these 
students. Pupils are however quite enthusiastic about Book¬ 
keeping. oewing should be offered to more girls. Biology and 
Geology are two frequently chosen options in the town and 
senior rooms. The number of options is limited for there are 
no courses in General Shop or in Domestic Science. 

The "C" student gets little benefit from the programme 
of studies offered in the high schools throughout this area, 
if'or example, only of the students took General science 1. 

As General Science 2 is not offered, they are required to take 
Physics 1 or Chemistry 1 in their second year, --any other 
instances may be cited to show that the ”0" student has to be¬ 
come academic or leave school. The latter usually takes place. 
Only one village school has an adequate supply of typewriters, 
but there is no provision for proper desks or a special room. 

An opportunity for those who wish to take subjects for 
which they are particularly fitted is lacking. The "A" and 
,T B n pupils in this area are also handicapped.

who are going to ounday School regularly. It is assumed that 
a Sunday School education is necessary to give the foundation 
whereby uhurch services may be more easily understood and 
appreciated. Forty-nine percent are not gettin, this 
education. It will also be noted that less than 20$ of the 
high school pupils attend Sunday School but this is to be 
expected as these young men and women are usually attending 
uhurch. See table XXV. Approximately 75$ of these pupils 
attend Uhurch regularly. Twenty-five percent are not getting 
a uhurch education at all throughout the towns and villages. 
This is rather surprising as the facilities are near.

The rural boys and girls attend poorly for the follow¬ 
ing reasons: 

1. distance to Sunday School, which may be held in a 
Church or school, i3 too great• 

2. Winter roads are usually blocked, thus making it 
impossible for the minister to conduct services. As few commun¬ 
ities have laymen capable of giving leadership in religious 
activities, it means that very little is done during the cold 
winter months. Furthermore, many parents are of the opinion 
that the children have walked far enough during the week and 
that they should have a rest on Sunday. 

3. A number of communities have so many religious de¬ 
nominations represented that the distance to a particular 

1 

church is that much greater. 

4. Fifty percent of the parents of the country have no 
automobiles, hence cannot attend church which is within easy 
distance of modern transportation but is too far for horses to 
travel. 

5. Personal grievances have been allowed to interfere 
with co-operation among the people with regard to religious 
activities. 

Girls go to Sunday School and Church more regularly than 
do the boys. As the pupils grow older, this difference is more 
noticeable. As the number of cases studied in the high school 
is small, this conclusion may be subject to correction.

In conclusion to this phase of pupil life, it may be 
observed that the young people of the Grande Prairie Inspec¬ 
torate are not getting sufficient religious instruction, 
citizenship studies in the schools partially offset this defic¬ 
iency but this phase of life needs more stress. 

The Picture Show 

Ahat opportunities are there for town and rural pupils 
to attend the moving picture shows? Are there any educational 
films shown from time to time?

The majority of pupils have little opportunity to see 
pictures of the outside world. The data given in table XXVI 
was secured from answers to the 7th and 8th questions in the 
teachers’ questionnaire. The value of some moving pictures is, 
to say the least, questionable, but every evening’s programme 
contains a newsreel and very often a travel picture. There is 
one moving picture machine in the Grande Prairie Jivision which 
belongs to the teachers, worthwhile programmes have been given 
by this means.

The pupils living in an area well served by regular 
theatre programmes attend regularly and in the opinion of the 
teachers, too often. The teachers feel that parents should 
know that loss of sleep is contrary to good health rules and 
works against normal progress. In the writer’s opinion, 
children below a certain age, as set by the medical authorities , 
should not be allowed to visit the theatre on nights preceding 
a school day. Lairing the v.eek, these young people should have 
the opportunity ana the guidance necessary to participate in 
first hand play instead of sitting in a stuffy theatre. 

Hobbies 

A good percentage of pupils have a hobby. While some of 
them are not particularly well chosen, they represent a beginn¬ 
ing and with proper guidance from the teachers and the parents, 
they may develop into something worthwhile. It wqs found to be 
disappointing and this conclusion applied to leadership given 
to the pupils with respect to hobbies. Table XXVII shows a 
high percentage throughout but it is the writer’s opinion that 
this is not high enough. Practically every boy or girl is 
capable of devoting part of his or her spare time to some par¬ 
ticular field of personal interest, be it mental or physical. 
Nineteen percent of the pupils have indicated that they have no 
hobby of any kind. What are the reasons for this? 

1. .Some parents regard any hobby as play, and play as 
a waste of time. A few of these parents can be excused as they 
came from a European country in which they knew nothing but 
hard work. After taking up a homestead in Canada, it v/as

4. Many of the homes in the outlying districts have 
facilities so limited that it would be hard for a child to have 
a hobby even of the simplest kind. 

In general, the pupils living in towns and villages have 
greater opportunities to take up a hobby. Table JGCVII indicates 
that with one exception, the Grade eight town girls, the percen¬ 
tage of pupils who have a hobby is greater in towns. There is 
no great difference in interest tetv;een the intermediate grades 
and the high school section, although the percentages are uni¬ 
form in Grades 10, 11 and 12. 

Sports 

In answer to question 46, 98/o of the pupils reported 
that they participated in sport and preference was in the order 
named below. 

Softball. 

Swimming. 

Hockey. 

Lack of equipment limits the number of sports in which 
the pupils can participate, Some children ski, but this 
interest during the last tv/o or three years has declined due to 
the fact that the community leaders in this sport have joined 
His Majesty's Services. It can be safely stated that the Korth 
Country is conducive to interest in sports, as the people have 
to rely on informal community get-togethers for their social 
life. Games and dances are the most popular forms of enter¬ 
tainment.

that they have a home litrary but the number of volumes in 
some of these is very limited indeed# Forty-seven percent of 
town pupils have access to books at home or to books in the 
town library. It is assumed that a home wl ribes to 

a number of good magazines, has a number of good books and 
receives the daily paper is providing incentives to worthwhile 
reading. The average country child has little opportunity to 
develop a reading habit. The value of building up a good 
school library cannot be over-estimated, for it is there that 
such a child will become introduced to the pleasures of reading. 
Over 91 fa of the pupils report in answering question 48 that they 
are fond of reading, so the teachers must be doing their best 
with the limited facilities at their disposal. 

Cne more observation should be made. The percentage of 
pupils who like to read books in the intermediate grades is 
higher than that of the high school pupils. .hy is this? The 
only conclusion the writer can come to is that this is due to 
the present system of education which has been in force since 
1926. This means that those of the intermediate grades have 
more enthusiasm for reading under the new system than pupils of 
the high school group who were taught by the older system in 
the smaller grades. The difference was found to be 9 c r in 
favour of the intermediate grades# 

Table XXVIII summarizes the answers given to question 
47 in regard to reading material. 

A large percentage of the pupils enjoy adventure and 
travel books. A little over Z/j did not state a preference.

stating that any kind of material is interesting. There were 
pupils who stated that they did not like to read books. Some 
of the latter came from homes with no reading material and the 
library of the school district is inadequate. This lack of 
interest may be due to a poor start in school or other interests 
which predominate at the time. There are a few boys who con¬ 
sider the reading of books as a pastime for ladies, hence will 
report ft no interest”, notwithstanding the fact that they enjoy

was taken to avoid having several children from one family 
reporting what items were contained in the home. The figures 
given in the table are reliable. The item "library facili¬ 
ties", was omitted, having been discussed previously. 

The lack of these items is a rough index of the fact 
that the pupils of the Grande Prairie Inspectorate are re¬ 
tarded. Thirty percent of rural homes have no access to the 
radio, thus a teacher will have difficulty in conducting 
current events successfully, especially if there are no news¬ 
papers in the district. Pupils from such homes cannot keep up 
with the events and progress in the world about them.

CHAPTER VIII 


Gr riAiiHi Ai'TAlN^iluT 

An analysis of data collected on birth place of pupils 
reveals that out of 941 pupils, 863, 31, 15, 15, 7, 4 and 6 
were born in Canada, United states, Poland, Norway, Russia and 
other European countries respectively. Uo appreciable differ¬ 
ence could be found as to desire of continuing school or in 
plans for the future, when land of birth was taken into con¬ 
sideration. Polish girls and boys are usually very interested 
during the first seven or eight years of school, after which 
there is a sudden drop of interest. As the number considered 
from this point of view was small, no definite conclusion can 
be made. 

The size of families ranges from three to tv/enty-one, 
but the average family has from three to five children. No 
difference could be noted in educational interest when compar¬ 
ing large and small families. Children from large families, in 
most cases, expressed a desire to complete high school but re¬ 
ported that this would be impossible as finances would not per¬ 
mit. The data collected proves that the children of large 
families are particularly handicapped in obtaining an education. 

If pupils do not move from one school to another, ability 
of teacher remaining constant, it is assumed that a child will 
make better progress, ^o the children move frequently? The 
answers to question 6 show that forty-3even percent of the 
pupils remain in one school. Thirty-two percent attend two 
schools, while twenty-one percent attend three or more schools.

It is the £l/o that will suffer a certain amount of retardation 
but there is no way of comparing this data with that of other 
similar areas. The writer is of the opinion that the average 
for the provinco would be less than 21Jo for all pupils who 
attend three or more schools. 

If it is assumed that the average child takes three 
years to a division, then after completing seven years of 
attendance, he should have completed Grade 7. Cn examining

the writer that some step of progress should be measured for 
one year’s work. It therefore does not appear logical that 
48 $£ of the grade 7 rural boys lack sufficient intelligence 
and energy to complete the work. ike case of the grade 7 town 
boys is another example, where 51 /j are taking more than seven 
years of schooling and 14 are taking more than eight years. 
All percentages which appear below the horizontal line in 
table XXX. represent the pupils taking more time than is 
expected of them. What can be deduced from this survey? The 
grade seven boys, rural and town, show the most retardation. 

As the sample of boys from towns is small, little reliance 
can be placed on the percentage who take more than seven years 
to complete the grade. Nevertheless the trend seems to be 
that the pupils suffer a set-back when they come from the 
integrated programme to the course of studies given in Grades 
7, 8 and 9. i.hen the latter grades begin to take a more inte¬ 
grated programme this retardation should disappear. On the 
average, the percentage indicated below the horizontal line 
seems high, and if the findings are reliable, the present pro¬ 
gramme of studies should be revised with the least possible 
delay. It is realized that there are other causes of retard¬ 
ation in the Grande Prairie Inspectorate. A few are listed 
below: 

1. Approximately fifteen percent of the teachers are 
using older methods of teaching. »hen one of these succeeds 
a modern teacher it tends to retard the pupils of the inter¬ 
mediate grades.

2. Long distances from school contribute to loss of 

time. 

3. Nine recently established school districts admitted 
children of advanced ages for their grades. Previous to the 
opening of the new schools, the attendance of these pupils had 
been very irregular in their nearest established schools. 

The writer is of the opinion that the amount of work 
which the intermediate pupils are required to cover and know 
reasonably well before promotion is too great for at least 20/o 
of the children. All intermediate pupils take the same load, 
regardless of ability, interests or time available for home 
studies. 

Table XXXI is a similar survey for the high school and 
the findings are much more satisfactory. The high school 
course makes allowances for slower pupils by lightening their 
programme of studies.

The pupils were given an opportunity to express their opin¬

giving the necessary help to round out their lives and that 
there is nothing lacking. Table XXXII also reveals that the 
intermediate pupils are more critical than the high school 
students and can see room for improvement. Probably the older 
pupils, with the exception of Grade 12, have become so accus¬ 
tomed to the present programme that they fall to see what is 
needed. If the pupils are aware of these things, they will 
help to educate their parents. The parents who support edu¬ 
cation will demand wider school service, notv/ithstending the 
fact that their taxes will be increased. The educationist 
should point out educational deficiencies for progress cannot 
be obtained without an eye to improvement. The educationiet 
must be on his guard against those who are willing to increase 
taxes at the expense of property owners and who will not have 
to help pay the bill. 

The Grade 12 boys seem to be outstandingly well informed 
when compared to the other high school pupils. The sample is 
small, hence the figures given in table XXXII may not present 
a true picture. Gn the other hand, some of these boys come 
from good homes, have travelled a little, and are in a position 
to assert themselves. 

The principals report that 51$ of the girls are getting 
the education required for teaching, nursing and university, 
but the remaining 49$ are not taking a course most suited to 
their needs or abilities. The school must provide for a great¬ 
er number than 51$. Better facilities must be provided.

i’HE '.ETCHERS 


The teachers of the Grande Prairie Inspectorate are not 
satisfied v.ith the present educational facilities. This con¬ 
clusion was reached after study of table XXXIII. In item 6 of 
the teachers* questionnaire, space was provided to list the 
most pressing needs of each school and apparently the teachers

gave this matter careful consideration. For example, regular 
inspections of the superintendent disclosed that adequate 
science equipment is needed in 22 schools, and yet the teach¬ 
ers report that only nineteen require it. Hence the most press¬ 
ing needs indicated by the teachers are a bare minimum.

There is no excuse for some of these deficiencies, how¬ 
ever. Items 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 and 17 could be attended to by the 
ratepayers of the district if drawn to their attention by an 
alert teacher. Throughout the Division the Local Boards are 
permitted to recommend that these things be done and the 
Divisional Board is in a position to treat all schools equally. 
i£v9n so, the Local Boards need to be prodded often to persuade 
them to make even a little effort on behalf of the children. 

It will be noticed that no one complained about the size 
of the school. Throughout this area, there are at least five 
which are too small, uoes this indicate that teachers have 
given up hope, or is it because they had not thought of it? 
Probably both reasons have some bearing on the findings. High 
School teachers are quick to realize when a building is inade¬ 
quate and usually have a feasible scheme w r hich would overcome 
the defects. However, Town Boards are usually a little 
suspicious, as they fail to recognize the school as the teach¬ 
ers 1 workshop. Schools must have suitable tools to promote 
maximum educational growth. 

All town and village teachers listed shop courses, 
Domestic science. Science equipment and proper accomodation 
for typing as the most serious needs. In addition, the 
principal of each school advocated the building of a gymnasium 
and assembly hall combined. Is this feasible? 

Yes, it is, for throughout the Grande Prairie Inspector¬ 
ate lumber is easily and quite cheaply obtained. Under proper 
leadership, every town or village could have a community hall

which would serve as a library and general meeting place for 
the adults. It could also serve as place to hold indoor games 
as badminton and basket' 11* In two of the towns there 
are ex-athletes who are keenly interested in promoting 
physical growth* They would be willing to act as overseers and 
caretakers for reasonable salaries, ihe pupils need this 
opportunity of gymnasium play. 

Teachers 1 Activities 

Are the teachers making an effort to work in close har¬ 
mony with the parents to overcome some of the deficiencies 
pointed out in Table XXXIII? No, the teachers do not seem to 
know the value of clear understanding between the school and 
the parents. Table XXXIV gives a summary of the activities of 
sixty-four teachers during the school year 1941-42. Around 
Christmas and -aster of each year, the teachers are asked to 
send in a summary of their work in the community and its re¬ 
sults. Suggestions are alv/ays welcomed and if these are appli¬ 
cable in other districts, the teacher concerned is informed, 
ureait is given wherever possible.

The fact that there a.e only 49 schools out of 64 which 
have a Red oross elub of some kind would indicate: 

1. That some teachers are not interested in Red cress 
work or perhaps do not fully realize its irrportence. 

Z. That the children have had a Red dross Jociety but 
due to lack of organization the children have become indiffer¬ 
ent . 

the parents of the children do not respond 
the idea but would support a school club under some other name 
for the reason pointed out in number 2. 

4• That a few of the teachers do not know business 
procedure and are not themselves acquainted with Red uross 
work. 

5. That lack of confidence persuades the teacher to 
wait until next year. Forty percent of the teachers were en¬ 
thusiastic about the idea but reported that they were waiting 
until t] 1Dllowing term. This form of reasoning becomes a 

habit• 

6. That it is too much work for a lazy teacher. 

Parents 1 ^ay or Tays 

According to table XiXIV less than forty percent of the 
teachers provide an opportunity for the parents to visit the 
school throughout the school year. . hy is this? 

in one or more of the districts in which a teacher had 
taught, parents were invited with the result that a very few 
mothers came. The pils id teacher ..ere very disappointed, 
so a decision was made that a Parents 1 ~ay would not be 
attempted again. 

The answer to this reasoning is that a failure in one

district may not be in the next one, hence there should be no 
definite conclusion after one or more attempts. The fact that 
two or three mothers did appear is encouraging# svery effort 
should be made to make the afternoon interesting to these 
ladies# If one mother learns how hild i? getting along 

and has an opportv . school at work, she will 

v;ant to come again, not alone, but accompanied by a neighbor 
or tv.o# rn Of a pi e will yield good 

results# 

Teachers agree that the fathers ask more questions 
relative to school interests than do the mothers# How can 
these men be induced to come? If a teacher were to ask Mr. 
Smith to lead a discussion on "Horse Buying" at a Parents’ Day 
meeting, one may be safe in saying that the men of the commun¬ 
ity will be there for they know Mr# Smith to be an authority# 
Cnee the parents are there, the enthusiasm and delight of the 
pupils will carry everyone along# 

There is no set formula in relation to the parents’ 
day. ^very programme must be organized with the peculiarities, 
interests and races, perhaps, of the district in mind. A very 
small but important point should be added before leaving this 
thought, namely, that all teachers must be timely in setting 
the date. The men and women cannot attend if everyone is busy 
seeding or harvesting# 

Poor roads and adverse weather conditions have ruined 
many initial attempts at organizing a parents’ day. As the 
country develops, this drawback will disappear. Teachers can 
overcome this partially by setting an alternative date and

sending word home with the children on the previous day. 

Parents will come to a regular programme but will usu¬ 
ally avoid elas riod*. By having an open afternoon, this 
objection can be overcome. Later, the 3 become 

familiar with the teacher and classroom they will attend dur¬ 
ing school hours. 

Generally speaking, the teachers do not visit the homes 
of their pupils until an invitation is issued. The teacher 
must learn that some farmers do not think of such formalities. 
Cf one thing the teacher can be sure - most farm people are 
very hospitable and welcome all who come to their door. The 
town and rural teachers have an excellent opportunity to visit 
because they have a common interest with the parents in the 
children. If a child is not making progress according to his 
ability, a talk with the parents may help to overcome this 
problem. This kind of co-operation will spread. It gives the 
teacher an opportunity to talk education and to present the 
teacher’s point of view. The parents will learn to realize 
that the teacher is human, sincere and genuinely interested in 
their children. The pupils, too, are always thrilled when 
their teacher is in the home. 

The teachers who have had more than one Parents' Day 
agree that every effort brings better succeeding results. To 
make a success of Parents' uays a teacher must have organiz¬ 
ing ability, personality and knowledge, and he must be con¬ 
vinced of the value of such gatherings. Such a teacher is 
worth far more than ^840.00 per annum. As a social engineer.

the teacher should receive comparable wages with the other 
professions for his services. 

Town teachers are more active than the village and rural 
teachers in promoting the work of youth organizations like the 
Boy Scouts and irl Guides. Probably the pressure of public 
opinion is greater in towns than it is in the villages and 
country in this respect. As a rule, the town teachers stay 
during the week-ends. Hie vLllage and rural teachers go home 
as often as possible. Phis does not help to prganize much 
needed young people’s groups. From a study of table XXXV it 
can be seen that very few children can benefit from these 
interesting and educational organizations. There are eleven 
groups which study the Bible, but only three of these are under 
the guidance of teachers. Phe pupils of the Grande Prairie 
rural are definitely neglected when we consider that there are 
42 schools without the influence of any youth organization.

many occasions pointed out that their salaries will not per¬ 
mit them to attend summer school and at the same time take 
care of their obligations. Jalaries must be increased if the 
boys and girls of this area are to receive the services to 
which they are entitled. 

Teachers'Juggestions 

Comments received in answer to question 10 are summar¬ 
ized below: 

1. xhe school should be the centre of the conmuni 
where people meet to discuss their problems, to take part in 
first hand amusement and to help in young people*s activities. 
The leader should be a teacher with the ability to organize in 
such a way that the burden of responsibility will not fall on 
one or two individuals. (This can be done if the salaries of 
the teachers are large enough to induce young men and women 
with constructive tendencies to take up teaching as a career.) 

2• -very community should have a central library to be 
operated by an executive elected by the community. ^ provincial 
library board should be appointed to advise the local boards as 
to the books that should be placed on the shelves and to give 
any other information which might be required from time to 
time.

ted in order that the turn-over of teachers on rural staffs 
might be reduced. It would give such a teacher an opportunity 
to live and work with the people of the district, 

4. The progressive teachers are of the opinion that a 
good school library should come ahead of a radio.

5# Avery com: should advocate a building programme 

to awaken ratepayers to the fact that homos require Improve¬ 
ments to Insure health and happiness. 

6* it*ide speakers should make It their duty to vi: 
the outlying districts. (If roads were reliable, this .culd 
be done more than it is new, as a number of speakers have 
expressed a wish to speak to the people of outlying districts.) 

7. Every community which requires it, should have night 
school during the winter months to help the foreign-speaking 
people. Added to this, there should be a col.: unity hall to be 
used to give instruction in vocational courses, t If night 
schools could be operated, certain religious objections to 
sports would be gradually overcome as the old' r men and women 
learn to understand the true purpose of physical education.) 

8. Pamphlets should be written ] tng the nt 

system of education, to be sent to every home. (The writer 
feels that this would not help as those who would take time to 
read them have already followed the modern trend of education).

C&rdPTilH X 

SOi&AKZ AND ^OKCLLIJlONS 
The Parents 

1. Only one-third of the foreign parents speak -English in 
their homes. This is because: 

a. No sys ten of free adult education has teen provided. 

b. ^Sympathetic leaders have not been sufficiently 
supported in their efforts to instill a sense of 
moral obligation in these new Canadians to learn 
the English language and manner of thinking. 

c. fc-any foreign-speaking parents misunderstand a demo¬ 
cracy, thinking it to mean a form of government 
which will allow all to do as they see fit, thus 
learning the language is a personal matter instead 
of a moral obligation to a community’s welfare. 

2. A majority of ^nglish-speaking parents do not understand 
the modern methods of teaching nor have they a sufficient 
grasp of what the schools are attempting to do for their 
children. This was found to be quite obvious for the follow¬ 
ing reasons: 

a. The parents object to increased cost of education 
on general principles rather than for any 
specific reason. 

b. The average parent has an opinion that the teacher 
is well paid for services rendered. 

c. Ratepayers do not realize the cost in time and 
money required to produce well qualified teachers.

The Pupils 

1. From this study it can be concluded that the boys of the 
Grande Prairie Inspectorate and the girls, to a lesser degree, 
are not getting an average provincial opportunity of getting a 
higher education. Reasons for this are: 

a. The general circumstances of a large percentage of 
rural pupils will not permit a higher education. 

b. The majority of pupils come from farms where they 
have started work of adults, due to present world 
conditions• 

c. Guidance groups and capable leaders are lacking. 

d. A distance of over 400 miles makes easy access to 
University, formal, Technical and Hospital training, 
difficult. 

2. Ihere is definite indication of slight retardation in the 
Grande Prairie rural area, not due to lack of general ability 
or intelligence, but because: 

a. The Grande Prairie area is just emerging from the 
pioneer stage. 

b. Regular attendance at school in this country is very 
difficult at times because of severe weather and 
lack of good roads. 

c. Geographic or economic factors tend to cause retar¬ 
dation. 

d. Lack of adequate educational facilities is the great¬ 
est cause of retardation. 

e. Thirty percent of the homes lack radios and 80 Jd lack 
libraries. These deficiencies are factors of retar¬ 


dation

3. Advanced Education is desired by 85# of the pupils yet 
approximately 20# of this group will be disappointed in their 
ambition. Here are the reasons: 

it impossible to attend university, 
technical school and even high school in some cases. 

b. sufficient encourajei ent and help from the parents 
and the teachers is lacking. 

c. hew courses, additional facilities and properly 
qualified instructors are required to .meet vocation¬ 
al needs. 

4. Vocational guidance is receiving little consideration in 
the Grande Prairie Area for several reasons: 

a. Low salaries do not attract the most capable teachers 

b. Pupils are ignorant of the work and ways of the world 
because of residence far from centres of industry and 
suitable educational facilities. 

c. Widely scattered settlement of people makes it diffi¬ 
cult to establish youth training organizations that 
give the required kind of vocational guidance. 

d. Alberta Normal Schools are too pressed for time to 
give their students a good grounding in vocational 
guidance. 

5. Rural pupils* activities are generally limited because: 

a. It is difficult to arrange church and Sunday school 
so as to serve all people. 

b. Nineteen percent of the pupils need more guidance 
with respect to hobbies so that they can make better 
use of the limited materials found in their districts

c. Participation in sports is limited to those few 
activities requiring very little or no equipment, 
and also because leaders in sport have Joined the 
services• 

d. Reading facilities, even in schools, are so poor 
that the pupils have little incentive to develop 
the reading habit. 

6. Grade attainment is not noticeably affected by a pupil’s 
nationality nor by the size of the family. Grade attainment is 
affected by changes of residence, quality of instruction and 
accessibility of school. 

7. Pupils in the rural and town intermediate grades are retard¬ 
ed in grade attainment because: 

a. Ko allowances are made for varying abilities. All 
pupils must cover the same amount and kind of material. 
The high school does not suffer in this respect. 

b. Fifteen percent of all teachers use old methods of 
instruction. 

c. Geographic and weather conditions contribute to loss 
of time. 


The Teachers. 

1. Teachers feel the urgent need of better libraries, sports’ 
equipment and facilities for the teaching of general shop 
and domestic courses. 

£. Rural teachers are negligent about organizing either youth 
or adult training groups, that would meet many needs in a 
community.

3. Parents* ^ays, which should be community events, are ignored 
in most localities because: 

a. The families are not accustomed to the idea. The 
parents are afraid to enter the school while work is 
in progress. 

b. The teachers are not good advertisers and organizers. 

c. The teachers fail to visit the homes of the pupils. 

4. Few teachers in this area have high qualifications because: 

a. Salaries are comparatively low, so that there is no 
incentive for good teachers to come north. 

b. Four hundred miles from ^dmonton to Grande Prairie is 
a negative factor in making a decision about teaching 
in this area. 

Implications of Data 

The majority of .English and foreign-speaking parents do 
not possess even an elementary understanding of modern methods, 
aims and objectives of education. They are rather indifferent 
to the privileges that the schools are offering their children. 
Provision should be made to overcome this lack of understanding 
by the introduction of periodic adult short-term courses. In 
the beginning, special emphasis should be placed on teaching the 
foreign settlers the language and ways of the Canadian people. 
Later, these short-term programmes should include courses most 
helpful to the interests and needs of a particular community. 
Education, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Cooking, Dewing, Lusic 
and Literature would be topics for discussion groups. To 
establish a well-knit Canadian Democracy, these adult schools

must increase enthusiasm for general knowledge. Jpecial empha¬ 
sis should be given to vocational guidance so that a teacher’s 
leadership could be supplemented by wise advice from the parents. 
Such a programme would reveal the value of co-operation between 
the school and the home. 

The cost of books ana instruction should be a federal 
responsibility, -ach community shoula be able to provide a suit¬ 
able place of instruction and living quarters for the men and 
women. When the youth training courses were given in this area 
during the winter of 1940, there was no great difficulty in 
arranging accommodation for the students. 

Throughout the thesis, the lack of adequate funds has been 
stressed as the major cause for the deficiencies found in the 
present educational programme. Without additional financial 
assistance from the government, the pupils of the Grande Prairie 
Inspectorate will not get suitable advanced education. Two-thirds 
of the pupils throughout the area are attending schools within 
the division. It would be well to make some brief comments on 
the services given by the division and on its financial status. 

In 1938, when the Grande Prairie Division was formed, there 
was an average debt of $625.00 per school room and at the present 
rate of liquidating this debt it will take another six years. 

The average sum allocated to operate a room during 1941-42 was 
approximately $1100.00. This provided for an average salary of 
$798.00. No general shop or domestic science courses were 
offered. High school instruction was inadequate. Health 
services were entirely neglected, very little provision was 
made for the teaching of music in schools even when the teacher

94 


had suitable training. All other facilities and services were 
correspondingly poor. 

To improve the financial status of the division, and 
consequently the service to the ratepayers, school taxes could 
be increased from the present rate of 15 mills to 18 mills. 

This increase would provide funds to pay an average salary of 
approximately $1050.00 but there would be no provision for 
improving facilities. To meet the requisitions set by the Grande 
Prairie Division during the last three years, the two municipal¬ 
ities have been forced to borrow. This indicates that increasing 
the mill rate is not the full solution to the problem of inade¬ 
quate funds. 

It is impossible for the Grande Prairie Division to offer 
the type of service given by Divisions which have no debts, or 
with those which have a greater assessment per room. A mill rate 
of four in the Foothills Division will provide the same amount of 
money as a mill rate of fifteen in the Grande Prairie Division. 
The Grande Prairie unit of effort is four times as great as that 
of the Foothills Division. This is not fair to the ratepayers 
of the lower assessed area. 

Further study will reveal that other inequalities which 
existed among the small school districts are now found among 
divisions. To overcome these defects it is apparent that the * 
cost of education should be a provincial responsibility. If 
this suggestion were put into effect, all divisions would have 
the same financial footing, and educational facilities and 
quality of instruction would also be equalized. This suggestion 
implies that a uniform mill rate be levied throughout the

province on all assessable property in rural areas* All money 
should be collected by the provincial government and redistri¬ 
buted to the divisions. Ihe amount of money allocated per room 
would be set by the provincial government* 

This does not suggest that a division could not ask the 
government to levy another mill or so in the area to provide 
for more than the provincial standard. 

The above mentioned plan should be carried a step further. 
The federal government should subsidize all the poorer provinces 
so that all can offer a Canadian standard of education. If this 
were done, every child throughout Canada would have an equal 
chance of getting a training most suited to his needs and abili¬ 
ties. A province would have the right to provide for more than 
the Canadian standard of education should that be the wish of 
the people. 

At present, non-resident pupils have to pay tuition fees 
and living expenses in order to take training in line with their 
vocational interests. If the provinces and the dominion adopted 
the suggested scheme, there should be no tuition fees and a 
living allowance should be made for all pupils lacking the 
necessary financial backing to continue their training. The 
amount of living allowance for each investigated case of need 
could be determined. The approximate number of pupils who would 
need their way paid per thousand adults or per thousand pupils 
could be calculated. 

The teachers' salaries should also be standardized and 
made large enough to attract capable young people. They would

be more content to remain at their posts for a longer time, 
thus rapid turn-over of teachers would be reduced and the 
quality of services rendered would be improved. 

It is realized that the proposed scheme of improving 
Canadian education would entail much time and effort in its 
organization and administration, but the writer is convinced 
that Canada would soon reap the benefits of an education which 
would be within reach of every Canadian boy and girl.
