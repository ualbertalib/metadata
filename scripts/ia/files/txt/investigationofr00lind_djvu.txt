CHAPTER I 


THE PROBLEM AND ITS SETTING 

In setting up this study, it is taken for granted 
that facility in the fundamental skills of arithmetic is 
necessary in our society, and that as educators, we should 
aim to help our students attain as high a level of achieve¬ 
ment as they are capable of in this area. It is generally 
recognized that although many pupils are achieving up to 
their level, and some are over-achieving, there are those 
who are not getting the results of which they are capable. 

In an attempt to assist the groups who are not achieving 
to the limits of their ability, the following investigation 
was made in the city of Edmonton. It is hoped that this 
thesis will be of help in the setting up of similar research 
projects which may eventually yield answers to this teaching 
problem. 

In dealing with remedial teaching of arithmetic, the 
Encyclopedia of educational Research states that up to date 
(1950), research had not advanced to the point where questions 
concerning relative merit of procedures could be answered 
with assurance* The editor summarizes: (a) there is a 
sizable problem; over fifty per cent in upper grades and 
high school suffer (b) most common sources of error can

easily be found (c) numerous programs have been success¬ 
ful (d) selected individuals with normal or above normal 
I.ft. *s can be brought up to perfect scores on fundamental 
processes (e) perfect scores are difficult to maintain, 
so review will always be necessary. 

Dr. Weaver^* states that he found four published 
studies in relation to individual differences and diagnos¬ 
tic and remedial programs in the years 1951 to 1956. He 
says there have been all too few truly major and signif¬ 
icant experimental research studies which deal directly 
with fundamental aspects of the learning process. 

One of these is by Allen Bernstein * 2 3 who, from a 
group of 523 students who were given the Cody diagnostic 
arithmetic test , selected fifty-five students who needed 
special help. Teaching clinics were set up, wherein a 
maximum of six students were taught at a time. Wholly 
individual instruction was given. The project continued 
for two semesters, and the pupils attended for periods 
varying from one lesson to the whole semester. The mean

number of lessons attended was seventeen decimal two. 
Special exercises were prepared by the teacher, and work¬ 
books were used. These students were excused from regu¬ 
lar mathematics classes to attend the clinics. - The Cody 
Test was repeated at the end of the semester. A control 
group of forty-eight was taken from the General Mathe¬ 
matics group at the beginning of the next semester and 
given the same test. The result reported by Mr. Bernstein 
stated that the mean gain for the experimental group was 
thirteen decimal nine points while that for the control 

group was one decimal two points.

Jean Hamilton estimates that eighty per cent of 
the children in need of remedial instruction in our regu¬ 
lar classroom are of normal or above normal intelligence, 
which percentage remains about the same as it was fifty 
years ago. She warned that care should be taken that no 
stigma be attached to a child in a remedial class. She 
also pointed out that research in the field of individual 
differences indicates weaknesses in homogeneous grouping. 
She stated that teachers must know what children need to 
know about arithmetic, and how children learn, so that they 
can build up the pupils 1 background. A balance must be

maintained between the use of concrete objects and abstract 
things; either can be overdone. A pointed quotation is 
also made regarding learning through experience: 

We forget that one of the most worthwhile 
experiences children can have is to think, 
and this can often be done best in a quiet and 
relaxed classroom. 

5 

Lesta Hoel reminds us that we can no longer merely 
treat symptoms in remedial work, but we must look for the 
cause and take measures to bring about a permanent cure. 

A long-term program must be developed where we deal with 
present symptoms but where we also carry on a prevention 
program. She says that in the last analysis, corrective 
or remedial teaching is merely correct teaching. Heavy 
class loads characteristic of classrooms of today make 
teaching more difficult but we can do better. 

ft 

Alice nach suggests three things to do to increase 
the effectiveness of our mathematics program in junior high: 

(1) Raeh teacher needs to know the emotional climate 
in a classroom which will result in the most 
effective learning. 

(2) He must know the techniques that help build this

emotional climate so that children may gain new 
insight in the study of mathematics and develop 
a liking, an appreciation and a curiosity for 
the subject. 

(3) The eighth grade is in an unpredictable age. 

We need enough of the elementary approach to 
stabilize the group, but enough of the second¬ 
ary approach to challenge and hold the interest 
of the group.

CHAPTER II 


THE RESEARCH DESIGN 

Teachers and principals representing six junior 
7 

high schools in Edmonton showed special interest in a 
remedial arithmetic program in grade eight. Arrangements 
were made through the administrative staff of the Edmonton 
Public School Board to introduce such a course experiment¬ 
ally for the school year 1956 to 1957, They asked that 
the classes concerned be of the standard size of thirty to 
thirty-five pupils so that no additional teachers would be 
required. Permission was granted to reduce the number of 
periods set aside for the exploratory subjects to the 
minimum required by the provincial Department of Education, 
in order to get class time for the course. They also 
desired that a remedial reading program be carried on in 
conjunction with the one in arithmetic. 

Principals stated that because of timetable dif¬ 
ficulties it would be easier if remedial classes v/ere made 
up as units that would remain together for all subjects, 
including the regular mathematics. 

The six schools had a total of approximately 800

pupils in twenty-six grade eight classes. From these, 

225 pupils were selected for eight remedial forms. Since 
they had to be organized at the beginning of the term, 
they were made up, except at Garneau, from those pupils 
who had shown below-average achievement in the school 
year preceding. 

Garneau included in their two remedial classes, 
pupils who rated lower than grade eight decimal one stand¬ 
ing on the Stanford Advanced Arithmetic Test in Computa¬ 
tion, Form J 8 when it was given in October. These students 
were brought together only for the special lessons and 
then returned to their original groups for other subjects. 
They attended the regular mathematics courses as well. 

The balance of the grade eight scholars had study periods 
in other classrooms while the remedial class was in 
session* 

During the first week in October, Stanford’s Form 
J was administered to all the twenty-six classes in the 
six schools. This test was also given at that time to 
seven grade eight forms from two other city junior high

schools which were not operating such extra lessons.

The object was to use their results for control purposes. 

For the next eight weeks, sixteen to twenty half-hour 
periods were set aside for remedial arithmetic in each of 
the six schools. 

Special exercises with answer keys, instructions 
and suggestions regarding methods and procedure were sent 
out to each of the teachers in charge of remedial classes'!' 0 
Within the limits of administrative requirements and local 
conditions, teachers were however, left free to handle the 
course in whatever way they saw fit. An attempt was thus 
made to have the project fit into the regular curriculum 
on a normal basis, the idea being to see to what extent a 
remedial program could be made effective under such con¬ 
ditions. 

At the end of the eight weeks of instruction, a 
recess of similar length occurred while similar classes in 
reading were held. 

The third eight-week period saw the remedial arith¬ 
metic program continue. When sixteen to twenty more lessons 
had been given, the program ended and a forgetting period 
of approximately three weeks was allowed. During the first 
week of May, Form K of Stanford*s Achievement Test in Com¬ 
putation was given to all the grade eight pupils in the

thirty-three classes of the eight co-operating schools. 

Each teacher in charge of a special class also answered 
a questionnaire regarding the program} 1 

When all the tests and other data had been gather¬ 
ed, comparisons were made. Since the Edmonton Public Schools 
obtain Laycock I.Q,. scores for its pupils, comparative I.Q. 
ratings were available from the cumulative record folders. 
The main comparison was made between sixty-one paired 
groups, equated on the basis of I.Q. standings and on the 
Form J test. One group of sixty-one was obtained from the 
£25 students in remedial classes and the other group of 
sixty-one was taken from the 740 pupils who were not in the 
extra course. The range of I.Q.*s in the matched couples 
varied from eighty-tv/o to 125, and the range of achievement 
on Form J (forty-four questions) was from eighteen to 
thirty-four. These sixty-one pairs were then compared 
according to their results on Form K of the Stanford Test.

CHAPTER III 


PRESENTATION AND INTERPRETATION OF DATA 

Overall results of tbe statistical findings arrived 
at from the administration of Forms J and K of Stanford’s 
Arithmetic tests in Computation in October 1956 and May 
1957 respectively are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 shown 
on the following pages# 

The forty-four items on each of these tests cover 
adequately the fundamentals in arithmetic computation. The 
two forms are well-balanced in the types of calculations 
asked for. Although the testing time for both is set for 
thirty-five minutes (and said by Stanford to be ample), 
the time allowed the Edmonton classes was thirty-three 
minutes because of the length of the class periods. No 
pupil got all correct on Form K; three scored forty-three, 
while the lowest mark was nine. 

Table 1 is an analysis of the pupils in the schools 
tested, in respect to their Laycock I.ft.*s. The scholars 
in the special classes rated slightly lower on the average 
than the ones in the regular program did. There was a range 
of I.'ft. from seventy-two to 148 in the remedial group, and 
from seventy-six to 149 amongst those who did not have to 
take extra tuition. Although most of the students had been

classified according to their achievement during the pre¬ 
ceding year, the difference between the two sections ac¬ 
cording to their I.Q. range seemed to be insignificant. 

Table 2 summarizes mean scores earned by the 
pupils of the eight schools where Forms J and K were 
administered. The Stanford mean grade equivalent on Form. 

J for October would be eight decimal one, while the grade 
equivalent on Form K for May would be eight decimal eight. 
On Form 2 the total population in this investigation had 
a standing of eight decimal one. The remedial pupils 
stood at seven decimal five, while the non-remedial 
students averaged eight decimal two. On Form K, the total 
population had a mean of eight decimal seven, the remedial 
scholars eight decimal two, and those not taking the course 
attained nine grade equivalent. 

According to these statistics, the special pupils 
achieved at a level six months behind the Stanford Form J 
average, but improved by seven months according to Form K. 
means after the seven month interval* 

The balance of the population was one month ahead 
of the Stanford mean and improved eight months in the same 
period. The total group equalled Stanford*s J average in 
October, but improved only six months in grade equivalent 
by May. Thus they were one month behind the norm reported 
by the test makers.

means were respectively decimal seven years and decimal 
eight years. This is explained by the fact that the non- 
remedial group made its improvement in the latter part of 
the test, which would reflect a higher relative change in 
grade equivalent. 

The score of the remedial group in school two 
changed from twenty-six decimal forty-nine of Form J to 
thirty-three decimal ninety-three on Form K, which is 
equal to a grade equivalent change of seven decimal seven 
to nine decimal three or one decimal six years of improve¬ 
ment in decimal seven years. Similarly, school eight’s 
special pupils improved from seven decimal seven to nine 
or one decimal three years. So these classes had altered 
from below average achievement on Stanford’s J test to 
above average accomplishment on Form K. On the other hand, 
school five remedial group dropped from seven decimal six 
grade standing to seven or decimal six yeatfs reversal in 
decimal seven years. Several factors such as negative at¬ 
titude toward the course or the maladministration of a 
final test could have influenced the results. 

Of the total school population, students in schools 
two, three, five, seven and eight reached or exceeded Stan¬ 
ford’s October mean score on Form J (29). Schools two, 
three, five, six, seven and eight reached or exceeded Stan¬ 
ford’s May mean score on Form K (32.5).

Table 4 shows that sixty-three decimal eight per 
cent of the special-class pupils improved more than deci¬ 
mal seven years in achievement according to Stanford’s 
means, while fifty-three decimal eight per cent of the non- 
remedial students improved more than decimal seven years 
in that period. 

Almost twelve per cent of the remedial pupils, 
however, got poorer results on form K than they had ob¬ 
tained on Form J. Nearly twenty per cent of the non- 
remedial group got a lower standing on Form K than on 
Form J. Over twenty-four per cent of these getting spec¬ 
ial help, and twenty-six decimal five per cent of those 
who did not attend extra classes made average progress of 
decimal seven years. 

Table 5 classifies the boys and the girls into six 
groups according to I.Q,. *s in order to indicate whether one 
sex or any X#Q. group profited more by the extra sessions.

Table 5 does not seem to show any appreciable dif¬ 
ference in improvement between boys and girls, but does 
seem to indicate that increasing benefit occurred with in« 
creasing I.Q. 

The comparisons so far seem to indicate that the 
remedial program as carried out in the six schools was 
profitable. To test this assumption further, equated pairs 
were set up from amongst the 224 remedial and the 736 non- 
remedial students who had taken both tests. Sixty-one pairs 
were obtained, each pair being equated exactly on the basis 
of I.Q. and achievement on Stanford Fom J. The I.Q. *s

The standard deviation difference, using Garrett's

Critical Ratio 1.89 = 3.10.

A hypothesis that some gain will come about as the 
result of remedial teaching was set up, and the one-tailed 
test of significance was applied, since we are interested 
only in those pupils who showed positive improvement.

With 120 degrees of freedom, a critical ratio of 
one decimal ninety-eight is significant at the five per 
cent level and a critical ratio of two decimal sixty-two 
is significant at the one per cent level. 

The results of this investigation, however, must he 
regarded with caution. The statistical design did not con¬ 
sider the possible effects of differential approaches to 
remedial teaching. It is thus questionable whether the 
critical ratio of three decimal ten can be considered as 
necessarily indicating significant gain in achievement by 
the remedial group over the non-remedial as a result of 
the special instruction.

SUMMARY 


THE PROBLEM 

The purpose of this investigation in Edmonton 
was to obtain data regarding the efficacy of a remedial 
arithmetic program in computation in grade eight. Cer¬ 
tain administrative problems such as size and selection 
of classes, timetabling, and availability of time and 
teachers for the additional course had to be faced. 

PROCEDURE 

Five of the six Edmonton public schools in which 
a remedial arithmetic course was attempted, selected their 
classes on the basis of achievement in arithmetic in the 
preceding year. These classes then moved as a unit through 
all the other courses as well. The other school set up its 
special classes on the basis of achievement on Stanford’s 
Form J test in computation. The remedial pupils in this 
school left their regular classes for the special instruct¬ 
ion periods, and then returned to their original group 
after each lesson. In all cases, the standard class size 
of about thirty pupils was maintained.

Form J of Stanford’s advanced arithmetic test in 
computation was used as a preliminary test in October for 
all the grade eight students in the thirty-three class¬ 
rooms taking part. This yielded a total population of 
975. The eight special classes selected from this popu¬ 
lation contained 225 students who were given two eight- 
week periods of instruction and practice. These instruc¬ 
tion periods were separated by an eight-week period in 
which no remedial arithmetic was practised. Total number 
of remedial class periods in the sixteen weeks varied from 
thirty to forty, each being about thirty-three minutes in 
length. 

Teachers stressed the meaningful approach, followed 
by drill and practice exercises. Practice exercises were 
supplied to the teachers to supplement their own material, 
and suggestions were given as to the order of their present¬ 
ation to the pupils. The teachers were not specialists in 
arithmetic, but all were experienced and interested in the 
problem. 

In May, Stanford’s Form K arithmetic achievement 
test was given to the total population as a final test. 

One group of sixty-one pupils who had taken remedial courses 
was paired with sixty-one pupils who had not taken such 
extra classes. Their I.Q.’s ranged from eighty-two to 125. 
The main comparison was then made between these two groups

who were equated according to I.Q. and equal achievement on 
the initial Form J test. 

FINDINGS 


The change in grade equivalent from Form J to Form 
K by the special classes varied from minus decimal six 
year to plus one decimal six years in the seven-month inter¬ 
val. Individual change in grade equivalent varied from 
minus three decimal two years to plus four decimal eight 
years. 

The total remedial population had a mean grade 
equivalent standing of seven decimal five on Form J and 
eight decimal two on Form K. This represented progress 
of decimal seven year in the decimal seven year term. The 
total non-remedial population had a mean grade equivalent 
standing of eight decimal two on Form 2 and nine on Form K, 
showing change of decimal eight year in the decimal seven- 
year interval. 

About twelve per cent of the remedial students and 
twenty per cent of the non-remedial pupils had poorer grade 
standings on Form K than they had on Form J'. 

Approximately sixty-four per cent of those who had 
extra help and fifty-four per cent of those who did not 
have additional aid improved more than decimal seven year in 
grade standing in decimal seven year.

When sixty-one pairs of pupils were equated accord¬ 
ing to I.Q. and attainment on the preliminary Form J test, 
and an ogive was constructed, the graph showed a tendency 
in favor of the tutored scholars. 

When results on Form K by the equated groups were 
analyzed statistically, a critical ratio of three decimal 
one was obtained. This indicated significant difference 
in achievement between the two elements at the decimal 
zero one or decimal zero five level of significance.

CHAPTER V 


CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 


CONCLUSION 


The evidence yielded by this investigation indicates 
that a remedial program of the type used here, can effect a 
significant improvement in arithmetic computation. 

There was disparity between results obtained by the 
groups taking part. Some of the factors that probably con¬ 
tributed to these variations were pupil and teacher dif¬ 
ferences, and varying student attitudes toward the course. 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

Suggestions that might be considered for future 
investigations are: 

1. An attempt should be made to study the effects of 
a remedial program on each class taking part, and 
thus try to eliminate some of the variables that 
affected this one. Thus more specific ideas re¬ 
garding effectiveness of different methods might 
be forthcoming. 

2. The selection of pupils for special help might involve 
(a) The use of standardized arithmetic achievement 


tests

(b) Recognition of the limitations of selection 
on the basis of I.Q. 

(c) Flexible grouping in order to insure that 
remedial pupils will not be segregated, 

3. The selection of teachers for this course: 

(a) Only teachers who are particularly interest¬ 
ed in remedial work should be assigned to 
such classes. 

(b) Such teachers should have special training 
in this field, and should be the instructors 
presenting the regular mathematics lessons. 

(c) The teachers should be inspirational, sym¬ 
pathetic and patient. Pupils who have not 
the will to learn will not learn. 

4. Timetabling 

(a) Every effort should be made to have the time¬ 
table fit the desired program. The program 
should not have to be altered to suit the 
timetable. 

(b) Since there is leeway in the number of periods 
to be used for exploratory subjects, these 
might be reduced to a minimum, making more 
time available for remedial work. Those 
pupils who were not in the special class 
would then have available a similar number of

periods for enrichment work. 

(c) More time could also be obtained by using 
part of the regular mathematics periods 
for corrective lessons. 

(d) A class size of thirty is too large for 
remedial work, although some favourable pro¬ 
gress might be made if positive attitudes to 
study and learning could be developed. At 
present it does not seem possible to decrease 
the size of classes in hdmonton. 

5. Methods 

(a) Students who understand the number system and 
the operations that can be carried out with 
it, and who have the proper learning attitude 
can be helped. Several approaches, rather 
than any one alone, should be used. One method 
might strike the proper chord in one pupil, 
where another has failed. 

(b) Care must be taken in the use of manipulative 
materials in grade eight. Improper use or 
application may cause children to consider 
such things childish. 

6. Materials 

(a) Many workbooks are available, but care should 
be taken in their selection. They should give

much practice in the basic arithmetic skills. 

The exercises should be so arranged that the 
skills are repeated as they accumulate. 

(b) The teachers of this special subject could co¬ 
operate in drawing up the type of exercises 
that would be found necessary. (See Appendix 
A for the kind of exercises developed in such 
a manner for this investigation. They were 
planned so as to have three levels of dif¬ 
ficulty for each of the fundamental operations). 

(c) Individual teachers could develop their own 
meaningful practice exercises that would fit 
in to the local situation. 

(d) Most modern texts include review exercises; 
teachers must be selective. 

(e) Pupils enjoy mental arithmetic if it is not too 
easy or too hard. The teacher must be able to 
decide the degree of difficulty best suited for 
his particular group. 

(f) Standardized achievement tests should be avail¬ 
able for initial and for final testing. These 
tests could be developed within a school system, 
or could be purchased from test makers. Teachers 
should be able to make at least a simple statist¬ 
ical analysis of the results and to interpret 


them

APPENDIX B 


INSTRUCTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR TEACHERS OF 
REMEDIAL ARITHMETIC CLASSES 


<L 

: 


aaaeAJ . : .. . 




58 


TO TEACHERS OF REMEDIAL ARITHMETIC CLASSES 

Following are some suggested procedures for your 
remedial arithmetic classes, but feel free to use your own 
ideas. If you let me know briefly after the classes are 
over, what plans you did follow, I wsuld appreciate it 
very much* Since the remedial classes are concentrating on 
the fundamental computational skills, various practise and 
drill methods will be followed. Before you use each of the 
practise exercises supplied, you will likely have a few 
minutes of "warming up" by means of mental arithmetic, flash 
cards, visualization, etc. and a short discussion period 
wherein you try to gain the confidence of the pupils and to 
have them talk about difficulties they have in the particu¬ 
lar skill. As pupils do the practise exercises, you vail 
want to keep them working under a bit of pressure (timing, 
etc.) for best results. 

When most have finished, let the pupils check their 
own answers as you read them from the key • Encourage them 
to keep records of their own work, but assure them that this 
class is purely for giving help, and that no records will 
be kept by you on results of practice, for reports or 
records. 

Maybe you would like to know in what sequence I 
plan to present the practise exercises on the basis of 
two periods a weeks

STANFORD ACHIEVEMENT TESTS 

A limited testing program in arithmetic computation 
is being conducted in relation to the experimental course 
in reading-arithmetic which is in operation in some schools. 
It is felt that, not only will these test results be signi¬ 
ficant to teachers as an assessment of relative pupil abil¬ 
ity in this field, but that they may lead to the develop¬ 
ment of city tests at the Junior High School level. You 
will be asked to administer Form K of this test during the 
spring term. 

Mr. E.B. Lindberg of Garneau School is doing thesis 
work in relation to this topic and will be compiling in¬ 
formation which will be sent to participating schools when 
it is available. 

G.R. Conquest, 

Assistant Superintendent of Secondary Schools.

EDMONTON PUBLIC SCHOOL BOARD 
STAFFORD ACHIEVEMENT TEST, GRADE VIII 


64 


March 1, 1957. 

The limited testing program in arithmetic computa¬ 
tion started last fall in relation to the experimental course 
in reading - arithmetic which is in operation in some schools 
is being continued this term. All the grade eight teachers 
of arithmetic at the schools taking part in this program 
are now being asked to administer Form K of the Stanford 
Achievement Test in arithmetic computation during the week 
of May 8. This will be about three weeks after the second 
eight-week period of special arithmetic classes is com¬ 
pleted, and will thus allow for a short "forgetting” per¬ 
iod before the ’k’ test is given. It is felt that when 
results of this test are considered in conjunction with 
the results of Test J last fall, they will be significant 
to teachers as an assessment of pupil ability in this field. 
The over-all findings will be sent to participating schools 
when they are available. 

G.R. Conquest, 

Assistant Superintendent, Secondary Education.
