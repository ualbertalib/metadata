INTRODUCTION 


Frost heave is a freezing ground phenomena that appears in 
connection with the transition of ground water from a liquid to a solid 
state. It has been the subject of observation since the seventeenth 
century, although it was not mentioned in literature until considerably 
later. 

Only recently, due to the growth of the automobile as a means 
of transportation, has the technical problem of frost action on roads 
become practically and economically significant. 

The heaving of soils due to frost action and the subsequent 
loss of soil stability due to thaws constitutes one of the more important 
problems confronting airfield, highway and railway engineers. The cost of 
repairs to runways, highways and railroad subgrades has amounted to millions 
of dollars per year on this continent. 

A small heave that is a minor nuisance to highway traffic is a 
menace on a railway track and calls for immediate correction lest human 
lives be endangered, to say nothing of potential property damage. 

Continuous inspection and prompt adjustment by the maintenance 
crew is required throughout the winter months. Adjustment is made by 
“shimming” the rails on an even and gradual approach and departure from 
the heave site, using hardwood shims of varying thickness. A heave of a 
few inches over a short area may necessitate shimming of hundreds of feet 
of rail and the heave affecting only one rail requires the shimming of 


both sides

Various solutions to the problem of frost heaving are possible 

s Z-H 

as outlined by Beskow and by Winn and Rutledge. 

(a) Design of pavement strong enough to overcome subgrade defects. 

(b) Replacement of detrimental subgrade with good material. 

(c) Drainage of subgrade and underlying soil. 

(d) Treatment of the existing subgrade soil. 

(e) Stabilized soil base construction. 

Some of the solutions are not feasible from the economic point 

of view. 

The practice of replacing frost heaving material has been used 
extensively in some areas. The resulting traffic disruption and the expense 
of bringing in replacement material may make this method impractical in some 
cases. 

Draining low lying lands would not be feasible economically. 

This investigation deals with the more simple solution of treat- 
ment of the existing subgrade with Lignosol % with reference to: 

(1) Development of a simple and economical method of injecting the 
Lignosol solution into the subgrade. 

(2) The effectiveness of one treatment over a period of years when 
the treated soil is subjected to seasonal rains, evaporation and 
leaching of the solution by ground water. 

(3) The cost of treating a frost heaving section compared with the 
cost of annual maintenance.

The laboratory program included tests to determine: 

(a) The effect of Lignosol on the frost heaving properties of 
various soils and inert glass spheres. 

(b) The suitability of Lignosol as a frost deterring agent as 
compared with other admixtures. 

(c) Whether there was a residual effect on a treated soil once 
the Lignosol was leached out. 

(d) The effect of Lignosol on the permeability of a soil.

Theory of Frost Action 

The term frost heave designates a condition in which soil has 
been raised above its normal level by the formation of ice layers somewhere 
below its surface. 

The physical laws controlling frost heave in soils have been 
defined by the research work of Taber*/ Mullis/ Bouyoucos£ Benkelman,^ 
Casagrande and Beskow. 

Briefly, water freezes in certain soils in the form of layers 
or lenses which grow at the expense of unfrozen water supplied by gravity 
or capil3.arity from a free water source* Under prolonged freezing action, 
the growth of these layers, in the direction of greatest heat transfer, 
cause an upheaval of the surface, which may amount to more than one foot. 
This movement, referred to subsequently as the frost heave is often enough 
to disrupt road pavements. Where non-uniform heave occurs it may produce 
irregularities which are distinct traffic hazards. 

When the temperature rises above the freezing point, thawing 
starts at the surface and progresses downward. This action liberates the 
large quantity of water which has accumulated in the form of ice layers. 
Unless the pavement possesses sufficient beam strength, failures in the 
form of breakage and displacement occur. This condition is known as the 
’’frost boil 1 ’ and is distinct from the frost heave as previously defined. 

There are two distinct systems of frost action which are 
generally encountered in engineering practice. 

In a ”closed system” the change in volume is due to the freezing 
of interstitial water only. The water in the voids simply turns into ice 
on freezing and the volume change accompanying this change in state of the 
water is 9 percent. 









5 


In countries where the frost line penetrates to a great depth, 
appreciable heaving may result, especially if the soil is saturated at 
the time of freezing* The freezing of five feet of sandy soil with a 

moisture content of 5 to 10 percent would result in a heave of about one 

inch, but the same soil when saturated could have an upheaval of up to three 
inches. Silts and clays with a moisture content of 30 to 50 percent may, 

upon freezing, give a surface uplift of three or four inches* 

This amount of heave if uniform throughout the area is not very 
detrimental on highways and railroads; it can however cause serious damage 
to buildings and other structures. 

Pockets of heterogeneous material, protection against frost 
penetration provided by crossings and embankments, variation in height of 
water table and other factors generally contribute to a non-uniform heave. 
When, however, the mechanics of frost action was made the subject of a 
scientific investigation, it was found that the change in volume of the 
water on freezing was of minor importance as a cause of heaving and was of 
no significance as a cause of spring breakup. 

In an "open system” there is both free access and free exit 
of water to or from the freezing soil. In a system open from below the 
heave is greater than in a closed system as the water may be drawn from 
below and thus contribute to the formation of ice lenses within the earth 
mass. 

In soils with a silt or clay content under favorable conditions 
of freezing the growth of ice lenses may increase the volume by as much as 
two hundred percent in the frozen soil. This increase in volume will 
produce a corresponding heave of any structure, highway or railroad resting

on the material. On thawing, the moisture content of this soil is greater 
than it was before freezing, by the amount of water in the ice lenses. 
Consequently a soil that was reasonably stable before freezing may be 
just soft muck, incapable of supporting any type of building foundation 
or any kind of highway or railway. 

In engineering practice ’’open systems’ 1 are encountered wherever 
the vertical distance betwen the water table and the frost line is smaller 
than the height of capillary rise of the soil. Since the water which then 
migrates out of the ground-water reservoir is continually replenished, the 
ice layers grow continually during the frost periods and the ground surface 
located above the zone of freezing rises. 

The treatment of the problem of frost action in soils has con¬ 
siderable practical significance in the north temperate zones where the 
winters are so severe that freezing occurs to considerable depth. 

In many countries having this climate the problem of frost 
action on roads reached such importance shortly before 1930 that special 
investigations were undertaken independently at the same time in several 
different countries. 

It is a well known fact that water attains its maximum density 
at 4 degrees C. (39.2 degrees F.) and cooling below this temperature causes 
the water to expand. The volumetric expansion amounts to 9 percent of the 
initial volume. Thus 100 cubic feet of water at 0 degrees C. may become 
109 cubic feet of ice at the same temperature. 

Frost heave is dependent on the presence of water in substantial 
accumulation near the surface.

An examination of a sample of heaving soil will show that the 
ice appears in regular strata or lenses of varying thickness. The total 
thickness of all these layers corresponds very nearly to the total frost 
heave. The water content is much larger than for unfrozen soil and is 
frequently even greater than that of a soil in a saturated unfrozen 
condition. 

Obviously, water must be supplied to the freezing ice layers by 
upward flow from the ground-water. Simon Johanssonf in 1913, was the first 
to explain this phenomenon, which he verified by controlled freezing 
experiments. Later Dr. Stephen Taber^a geologist at the University of 
North Carolina, explained the mechanics of frost heaving more fully. 

The damage to highways and railways in. Sweeden was so serious 
that in 1925 a conference was held to consider the problem. As a result 
the Institute of Roads and Geological Survey jointly sponsored an extensive 
theoretical and experimental investigation of the problem. The results of 
more than ten years of work was reported in a comprehensive treatise by 
Dr. Gunnar Beskow^in 1936. 

4 - 

Benkelman and 0Instead'of the Michigan State Highway Department 
have presented an alternative hypothesis based on frost line fluctuation, 
where the surface is prevented from settling as the ground thaws, by 
adjacent frozen soil* This theory? - may apply to comparatively small pockets 
of material very susceptible to frost action, surrounded by highly impervious 
soil. 

Taber ! s theory lias been accepted in this country as giving a 
truer picture of frost action and is most commonly used. According to Taber 
ice crystals begin to form in the centre of the voids of a saturated soil.

He states that ice crystals tend to grow in the direction of minimum 
resistance to expansion and in the direction of heat transfer. Under 
natural conditions in the ground the minimum resistance to expansion is 
vertical and the direction of heat transfer is vertical from the warmer 
soil below to the freezing temperatures above the surface. Thus the 
crystals most frequently grow in a vertical direction and the ice lenses 
extend horizontally in the fissures opened by vertical growth. These 
crystals eventually press against the thin adsorbed water film surrounding 
the soil particles. The adsorbed water, being under great pressure, has a 
lower freezing point than that in the centre of the voids. This water 
cannot ‘‘squeeze out 11 ; instead there is a transfer of molecules from the 
films to the growing crystals. To maintain pressure equilibrium, water 
is pulled to the films from the unfrozen soil belov/. If the growing 
crystals are within the range of capillary rise in the soil from a source 
of water, the system is an ,l open n system. The ice layer continues to grow 
as long as the frost line stays at that level and at a rate determined by 
the permeability of the soil. 

q 

Dr. A. Casagrande stated that one should e?xpeet considerable 
ice segregation in non-uniform soils containing more than three percent of 
grains smaller than 0,02 mm,, while for very uniform soils at least ten 
percent is required. 

Capillarity, being a combined effect of grain size, shape and 
size distribution, is also useful for defining a limit. Capillarity can 
be determined simply by measuring the height to which water will rise above 
the free water surface in a tube containing soil to be tested. If the 
capillary rise of water extends into the freezing zone ice segregation may occur.

For ice segregation to occur a soil must be permeable enough 
to allow a flow of water to the freezing zone* A material is said to be 
permeable if it contains continuous voids* Furthermore, the flow of water 
through all of the voids of a saturated soil obeys Darcy*s Lav/: Q = k i A t 
where 

Q = quantity of flow A = cross sectional area 

k = coefficient of permeability through which flow takes 

i = hydraulic gradient place 

t = the time for the measured 
flow 

The permeability of a soil depends on the grain size, properti.es 
of the pore fluid, void ratio, shape and arrangement of the pores and the 
amount of entrapped air and foreign matter in the voids. Any change in 
these factors will affect the permeability of the soil. 

The following is an explanation of why the treated soil which 
did not heave in the field showed a large heave in the laboratory.

The growing ice crystals at (a) exert a certain suction or 

vacuum pressure n s rt * It is this suction that draws up the adsorbed water 

surrounding each particle. The rate of crystal growth depends upon the 

rate at which free water can be supplied to the growing crystal. This 

rate is determined by the hydraulic gradient ~JL~ in the laboratory and

in the field. The height to free water in the field is very much

larger than that in the laboratory, hence the hydraulic gradient in the 
field is comparatively very small. The flow of water to the growing ice 
crystals may be so small in the field that the frost line would have 
penetrated to a considerable depth before any appreciable ice segregation 
occurred. This also explains why, under certain field conditions, there 
is no excessive heaving until late in the winter. 

A high water content favors segregation and additional water 
may be drawn from the water table to form very thick layers. It is obvious 
that other conditions beihg favorable for frost action, we may expect heave 
where the depth from the surface to free water is least. Thus in general, 
heaving occurs most in cu&& and least in fills. On sloping ground where 
there is part cut and part fill, the heave may be very large on the inner 
side of the road and small on the outer, causing tilting of the road bed 
that may even be perilous to traffic. In places of high ground water, where 
fills are made of heterogeneous material dumped at random and care is not 
taken to eliminate dangerous frost heaving material from the fill, large 
differential heaving may occur. 

Another requirement for ice segregation is that the rate of 
penetration of the frost line must be relatively slow. The range of 
permeabilities for which serious ice segregation will take place depends 
upon the rate of penetration of the frost into the ground. Thus the heave 
in a certain section may vary from yes.? to year. 

Clays in general are so impervious that they are seldom 
susceptible to serious frost action. At the other extreme, clean gravels 
and sands are not susceptible to frost action because of their lack of fine 
particles. The soils which give the most trouble are the silts and sandy silts

with their relatively fine texture and high permeability permitting ice 
segregation to proceed at a relatively rapid rate# 

A thorough understanding of these fundamental principles will 
enable one to do much to eliminate detrimental frost action. Identification 
of soil types and survey of ground water levels will identify spots 
particularly susceptible to frost action. 

The conclusions of all investigations on frost action can be 
summarized as follows: 

(1) Destructive frost heaving is almost invariably associated with 
the formation of segregated ice. 

(2) The total amount of frost heaving is very closely equal to the 
sum of the thickness of all layers of segregated ice. 

(3) The total amount of ice segregation is in direct proportion to 
the increase in total water content of the frozen soil. 

(4) The soil must have a water content equal to a state of capillary 
saturation for ice segregation to take place. 

(5) A supply of water must be available for the growth of ice 
crystals, either from some portion of the soil itself or from 
some external source, e.g. ground water table. 

(6) For normal field conditions of temperature a certain minimum 
percentage of grains smaller than 0.02 mm. is necessary for 
ice segregation. 

(7) One slow gradual decrease in temperature well into the freezing 
range is necessary and sufficient to cause ice segregation and 
frost heaving. Subsequent thawing and refreezing may increase 

the severity of the frost heaving but will not change the basic action. 

(8) A cumulative curve of degree-hours of freezing plotted against time 
is a qualitative measure of the increase of frost heaving with time. 

(9) The following factors are all necessary for ice segregation and 
frost heaving. If one of these factors is not present, frost 
heaving will not occur: 

(a) Capillary saturation of the soil at the beginning of or 
during the freezing process. 

(b) A free supply of water from within or without the soil. 

(c) A minimum percentage (3 to 10 percent) of grains smaller 
than 0.02 mm. 

de 

(d) A gradual increase in temperature of the air above the soil 
below freezing temperatures.

FIELD AND LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS 


Considerable success has been achieved in recent years at the 
University of Alberta in tests on a laboratory scale and also in trial 
field treatments in the elimination of ice segregation in soils by the 
injection of Lignosol. During the winter of 1946-47 two graduate students, 
Messrs. R.A. Hemstock and 3.R. Sinclair, working under the direction of 
Dean R.M. Hardy, established that three to four percent of Lignosol within 
the depth of frost penetration will in most cases eliminate ice segregation 
under the most severe conditions of freezing and in soil types most highly 
susceptible to frost action. 

In 1950 the Northeastern Paper Products Limited of Quebec City 
sponsored an extensive field investigation at the University of Alberta* 

The field trials were made for the purposes of developing methods for the 
injection of the admixture, to secure data from which the cost of a treat¬ 
ment could be evaluated, and also to acquire information on the permanence 
of the treatment. 

Field trials have been made in a rink using artificial ice and 
also at three locations on a railroad grade subject to natural freezing 
conditions. At each of these locations severe frost heaving amounting to 
from four to ten inches occurred annually. 

Lignosol is water soluable and fairly satisfactory methods 
have been developed for injecting it into the soil at depths of three to 
six feet below the surface using a grouting technique with pressures 
ranging from ten to sixty psi. The solution seems to **channel” through 
the soil under the grouting pressure, but it appears to gradually permeate 
the soil with time and to accumulate more readily in the more permeable 


12 






13 


soil strata in the treated zone* It has been found difficult to inject 
sufficient solution to give the optimum quantity of three to four percent 
Lignosol in the treated zone, but the fact that the solution permeates 
more readily into the more permeable soil strata has contributed consider¬ 
ably to the effectiveness of the field treatments* 

It was expected that the solution would be gradually leached 
out of the treated zone by ground water. However, the field trial sections 
have now been observed for two and in one case three winters, with no evidence 
of rapid leaching of the admixture. In fact the effectiveness of the treat¬ 
ment appears to be somewhat better the second winter than during the initial 
winter. It is not that the heaving is any less than during the first 
winter, but rather that it is more uniform. 

The Lignosol can be readily leached out of the laboratory 
treated samples but there is evidence that a permanent residual remains 
in the soil. This aspect of the treatment is still being studied. 

The field trials were made in an area where the frost pene¬ 
tration normally ranges from four to eight feet. The expansion of the soil 
moisture on freezing may produce a surface heave of from one-half inch to 
one inch per foot of frost penetration. This of course is not prevented 
by the Lignosol treatment and it may be somewhat increased due to the 
additional water added to the soil in injecting the lignosol. This 
amount of heaving is not objectionable on the railroads provided it is 
fairly uniform. However, irregular heaving due to ice segregation where 
the soil and moisture conditions are most favorable frequently results in 
differential heaving of several inches over comparatively short stretches 
of track. The practice in many parts of Canada is to shim the tracks on 
either side of the badly heaved locations. The necessity for shimming was 
completely eliminated over the treated sections during the past two winters.

Materials Tested 


Soils 

In order to correlate laboratory observations and field ex¬ 
posure, laboratory tests were conducted on soil from the Fallis, Stony 
Plain and the Spruce Grove test sections. The Fallis soil is a sandy 
silt which is a typical dangerous frost heaving soil* When tested in 
the frost action cabinet it gave a heave of over 60$ of the length of the 
sample. (See av\d tos) 

The silt used in some tests was from East Kootenay, B*C# and 
had too many fines to give good frost action. 

Glass spheres, which are chemically inert, were also tested in 
the frost action cabinet to try and determine whether the predominating 
effect of Lignosol in reducing frost heaving is physical or chemical. 

The glass spheres used in these tests were obtained from The Flex-O-Lite 
Mfg. Corp., St. Louis, Mo. (U.S.A.). To secure finer sizes, Pyrex glass 
was wet ground in a ball mill with steel balls. After grinding for about 
twenty hours, the mixture was poured into a large container and allowed 
to settle completely. The water was then decanted. The glass particles 
were then treated with 12 normal solution of hydrochloric acid, (with 
nitric acid as the catalyst), to remove the iron. The process of washing 
with hydrochloric ac5.d and decanting was carried out for a period of one 
week, at which time all traces of iron had been removed. The glass was 
then washed with distilled water until all traces of the acid were removed, 
then dried thoroughly at approximately 100 degrees G. The glass was then 
mixed with the glass spheres to give grading curves as shown in Figure 18. 
The grading curve for other mixtures of soil, and soil and glass are shown 
in Figures 19 and 20.

Admixtures 


C ha nges 

Calcium chloride, which reduces the thickness of adhesive 
water films on the soil particles through increased surface tension, 
increases the cementing action of the clay binder, and in general re¬ 
duces the freezing point of the water in the soil mixture. 

Aerosol 

Aerosol is a wetting or dispersing agent and it was assumed 
that it would alter the capillary characteristics of a soil and eliminate 
the migration of soil moisture to the frost line. However, laboratory 
tests showed that three percent aerosol in a test soil increased rather 
than decreased frost action. 

Lignosol 

A waste product of the pulp and paper industry, it is often 
referred to as a sulphite liquor. It has been refined to reduce the 
moisture content. An analysis showed it to contain approximately 50 
percent water, 15 percent sugar, 30 percent other organic material, and 
traces of lime and monosulphide. In appearance it resembles molasses. 

It is a dark viscous liquid, smooth and sticky in texture. It is completely 
soluble in water and is therefore easily applied in any strength as a 
solution to the soil particles. 

Experimental Procedure 

Preparation of Test Specimens for Frost Action 

Throughout this investigation specimens have been prepared 
with physical characteristics (density, moisture content, percentage of 
admixture, etc.) as nearly as possible like those that might occur in a 


stabilized road or base

Mixing and Molding 

The soil to be tested was air dried and carefully pulverized 
with mortar and pestle in order to break down all lumps without crushing 
the soil particles* A batch consisted of enough material to mold two specimens, 
one of which was completely tested; the rest of the material was carried 
along as a substitute in case re-testing was required® 

In designing a mixture, the percentage of admixture used was 
computed as a percentage of the dry soil, and the moisture content computed 
as a percentage of the combined dry weight of soil and admixture. All 
specimens were molded at approximately the optimum moisture content for the 
particular type of soil or mixture as determined by the Proctor procedure. 

The admixtures were dissolved in water before adding to the dry soil, then 
thoroughly mixed by hand to insure uniform distribution of all ingredients, 
and the soil and admixture allowed to stand overnight in sealed containers 
to further facilitate distribution of the admixture, and allow any chemical 
changes to start. 

Special molds were designed for use in the frost room to eliminate 
the difficulties encountered due to the sample freezing to the container. 

A six-inch length of lucite tubing, 1.25 inches inside diameter, was cut 
into one-half inch lengths. Thus the mold actually consisted of twelve 
identical lucite rings, placed one on top of the other as shown in Figure 1. 

The lucite rings fitted into a specially designed brass holder as shown in 
Figure 1.

Figure 1. 

This holder allowed the sample to be compacted in the Incite 
rings and the rings containing the soil to be removed from it without any 
disturbance. A cutting edge was provided so that specimens could be cut 
from undisturbed field tube samples. 

The specimen and rings were removed from the holder and set 
up in the frost action cabinet described under a separate heading. 

When the frost line started penetrating into the sample the 
soil in the top ring became frozen first. With gradual penetration of 
the frost line, ice lenses started forming below the top ring and the 
enclosed soil. Further freezing caused the ice to start forming in and 
below the second ring pushing it and the top ring higher. This process 
continued until the soil was frozen to within an inch of the bottom. 

Thus the rings offered no resistance to the formation of ice lenses as 
any of the soil that froze in the ring was just pushed up by the ice 
lenses forming below it.

Leaching Equipment and Procedure 

Leaching tests were carried out to see how much Lignosol would 
leach out of the soil by forcing water through it. A gravity system was 
tried first but the addition of Lignosol decreased the permeability to 
such an extent that it took a month or more for one inch of water* to run 
through the specimen. A standpipe was then attached giving a larger head, 
but this still took between two and three weeks to get an inch of water 
through. 

The details of the apparatus which gives the best results are 
shown in Figure 2. The top of the specimen was connected to a water pipe 
as shown and the pressure reduced to approximately five pounds per square 
inch. (Higher pressure caused channels to form in the sample.) At this 
pressure an equivalent of four inches of water could be forced through the 
sample in any twenty-four hour period. 

The soil for leaching was prepared in the same manner as for 
the freezing tests, compacted in the mold and the water line connected to 
it. Water was allowed to seep through the sample until the solution 
issuing from the outflow valve was clear. The amount of water forced 
through the sample was measured and recorded. It varied with the type of 
soil and the percentage of admixture used. 

Frost Action Test Equipment and Procedure 

In order to reproduce in the laboratory natural soil freezing 
conditions, the cold room was used in conjunction with the frost action 
cabinet. 

^The amount of water that would cover the cross-sectional area of the 
specimen to a depth of one inch.

The cold room is insulated with eight inches of cork in walls, 
ceiling and floor; it measures 7 by 9 by 6§- feet inside; has an automatically 
controlled temperature range of 10 to -30 degrees C. and is cooled by a 
blower type cooling unit. The controls and refrigeration plant for the 
cold room are set on the outside of the room, using a freon compressor 
powered by a ij- H.P. motor. 

The original equipment for performing laboratory tests on the 
effect of the Lignosol treatment in preventing frost action has been rebuilt 
to permit more expeditious handling of the samples and provide more accurate 
control of the temperature gradient throughout the sample. Six samples, one 
inch in diameter and six inches long were set up simultaneously. These were 
prepared for freezing in about four hours. A good indication of the effect 
of Lignosol in preventing ice segregation was obtained in from three to 
seven days by observing the relative behavior of treated and untreated 
samples in the freezing cabinet. 

The schematic cross-sectional drawing of the frost action 
cabinet, Figure Ay shows the arrangement of the soil specimens during the 
test. The freezing temperatures are transmitted to the sample only through 
its upper surface. The frost action cabinet is insulated throughout as 
shown and has an automatically controlled water temperature range of +25 to 
-15 degrees G. 

There was some evaporation from the test specimens during the 
test period and the last two sets of samples were wrapped in waxed paper 
and the top covered with paraffin. A small air vent was provided in the 
top surface to allow the escape of air displaced by the rising capillary 


water,

FROST ACTION C$B0^eT 
Figure 4. 

The bottom of the specimen rested on a porous bronze plate 
which was attached to a board, with 1-J- inch holes drilled in it to 
accommodate the six samples. The board fitted loosely into the cabinet 
and sat on four legs which provided a two-inch depth of water in the 
supply pan. The water was warmed by an immersed rod heater and was 
thermostatically controlled. It fed directly through the porous plate 
to the soil capillaries and thence to the zone of freezing. Thus there 
was a continual flow of heat upward through the sample to the zone of 
freezing. This condition, on a reduced vertical scale, was comparable 
to the temperature conditions in the field.

Test Procedure 

The testing procedure followed was a modification of that of 
preceding investigations, checked by a preliminary study with the equipment 
and materials previously described. Since the main objective was a deter¬ 
mination of the relative effects of frost action in various types of 
stabilized soils treated with Lignosolj the test procedure was relatively 
simple as compared with the methods used by preceding investigators♦ The 
ground work had been laid by their studies of the effects of types of 
freezing, rate of freezing, pressure, water availability, size of grains 
and voids, etc. 

All tests were carried out on 11 open systems”, that is, water 
was always available to the bottom of the specimen. Each test consisted 
of a slow descent of the frost line through the entire six-inch specimen. 

In some tests the temperature was gradually lowered from 20 degrees G. to 
-30 degrees C. over a period of three weeks, while in others the temperature 
was immediately lowered to -30 degrees C. and kept there for the duration 
of the test. In some cases the specimens were frozen then allowed to thaw 
out, followed by a quick re-freezing. This was done in order to study the 
various effects of temperature gradients and re-freezing on the rate and 
amount of heaving. The procedure chosen was a very severe test, but is 
certainly within the limits of natural occurence in the northern latitudes. 

All specimens were tested under very similar conditions and 
general preparation technique. Tables 3 to 10 outline the daily temperature 
variations for eight series of frost action tests and other important data 
on the temperatures of the room and water. The cumulative degrees-hours of 
freezing plotted against elapsed time of test are shown in Figures 10 to 17.

Consolidation Tests 

A series of consolidation tests, Tables 11 to 21, were run on 
the East Kootenay silt and on the tt Glass sphere mixture A” with varying 
percentages of Lignosol* The results of these tests were used in computing 
the permeabilities of the soil and glass using the following equation: 

I, _ T av H 2 X 
" t(l + e) 

where: 

T = time factor for 50% consolidation = 0*2 

av = 6 1 ~ e 2 

P 2- P X 

H = i height of specimen in inches (corrected for consolidation) 
t = time in seconds for 50fo consolidation 

y = density of water or fluid 

The material to be tested was mixed with the required percentage 
of Lignosol and water and allowed to stand overnight* The following day it 
was compacted in the consolidation ring and the consolidation test carried 
out to completion* 

Viscosity and Density 

The viscosities and densities of a series of water Lignosol 
solutions were determined for use in correcting the values of permeability 
as determined from the consolidation results* The viscosities were deter¬ 
mined using the viscosometer and the densities by using a hydrometer* The 
results of these tests are shown in tabular form in Table 2 and in graphical 
form in Figures 8 and 9*

Collection of Data 

A complete record of all details of procedure and test 
data that may in any way enter into the interpretation and correlation 
of results has been kept for each specimen. ^/#+* /7, 

Throughout the investigation, specimens were numbered con¬ 
secutively for identification. Each series of six specimens was tested 
at the same time under identical conditions of temperature variations. 

During the test periods, daily readings of the temperatures 
of the room air and the water in the reservoir were taken. All temperature 
readings were made to the nearest degree Centigrade with thermometers hung 

the 

above the test specimens and immersed in^water through a small tube provided 
for this purpose. 

A chronological record of the occurrence of frost action was 
obtained by making daily measurements of the heave of the top of each 
specimen. Movements were recorded to the nearest 0.01 inch. The rate of 
heave curves. Figures 10 to 17, show this data and when correlated with the 
temperature and photographic records, gave valuable information regarding 
the temperature range for destructive heaving, the rate of penetration of 
the frost line and the reduction in heaving by the addition of various 
percentages of Lignosol. 

Photographs which were taken of some specimens within an hour 
after their removal from the frost action cabinet provided a permanent 
visual check on the other records.

SPECIMEN AT PLCTlOfvJ 

© F TEST 

Figure 5. 

Figure 5 is a photograph of a typical specimen at the 
completion of the test* Usually six specimens were photographed as a 
group. Visual inspection of the tested specimens was necessary to 
determine completely the effect of the admixture on the type of frost 
action, that is, on the characteristics of the segregated ice and the 
sections of the specimen that were affected. In the cases of the 
specimens with a low initial water content, it is possible,bjr comparing 
the rate of heave curves and the photographs, to determine exactly when 
and where in the specimen a state of capillary saturation was reached 
and ice segregation began. In other cases, the time at which the specimen 
was completely frozen can be determined.

The moisture content of each specimen was taken at the start 
and completion of each test. A representative sample was taken and its 
moisture content determined at start of test, while the moisture content 
at completion of the test was determined on the entire sample. 

Presentation of Data 

The data accumulated to date has been assembled in the form of 
charts and curves for rapid study and appraisal. These charts and curves 
are, for the most part, self-explanatory and a detailed discussion of them 
is not necessary. Significant trends in the data as they relate to effects 
of soil gradation, type and percentage of admixture and moisture content 
are discussed. 

Data Charts 

The vital test data for all specimens has been summarized in 
tabular and graph form in Figures 10 to 17, and Tables 3 to 10. The per¬ 
centage of heave is the ratio of the increase in height of the specimen 
during the test to the original height. 

Figure 10 presents the data for the East Kootenay silt group 
which were mixed with varying percentages of Lignosol, as part of the study 
of the percentage admixture on the rate and amount of heave. The specimens 
were all compacted at a moisture content as close as possible to the optimum 
as determined by a Proctor compaction test. The data in Figure 11 is for 
specimens using inert glass spheres with varying percentages of Lignosol. 
With two exceptions, the group was compacted at optimum moisture content. 
This group was tested in order to try to determine whether the effects of 
Lignosol in reducing frost heaving were physical or chemical. 

Figures 12 and 13 present the data for various types of soil 
mixtures with different admixtures.

The data in Figures 13 to 17 are for specimens from the 
Lignosol treated field sections. 

Probably the most obvious trend in the data presented on 
these charts is the correlation between moisture content and frost action. 

A moisture content of at least capillary saturation is necessary for ice 
segregation to occur and where ice segregation had occurred, the resulting 
moisture content was very high. These observations are verified 
definitely by the data on the charts, average final water content and 
initial water content indicating very closely the trend of the percentage 
of heave. 

Although the percentage of heave indicated, in general, the 
extent to which frost action may be expected to occur in the various 
mixtures, it is not considered that it can be taken as a basis for rigid 
comparison of the mixtures. As an example, if one mixture shows a heave 
of 50 percent and another a heave of 25 percent, there is not sufficient 
evidence to conclude that the latter is twice as resistant to frost damage 
as the former. The important conclusion in such a case was that both 
mixtures are liable to serious frost damage, the exact extent being 
entirely dependent upon the conditions of initial moisture content, 
density and temperature, a variation of any one of which might result 
in a definite change in the relative amounts of damage. 

The per e e nt age-of-heave data can, however, be used as a basis 
for a general grouping of the various materials as to whether they are 
resistant or non-resistant to frost action, and if non-resistant, under 
what conditions the damage will occur. 

The influence of the individual admixtures on the reduction of 
frost action was evident from the data charts, the general indication being

that the protection furnished is directly proportional to the percentage 
of admixture,, 

Aerosol, in the percentages tested (up to 4 percent) had little 
effect in reducing frost action in inert glass spheres. When 3 percent 
aerosol was added to a test soil from the Fallis section there was no 
decrease in ice segregation in the first test while a second test showed 
a very marked increase. Consequently, it has been established that 3 
percent Aerosol has a detrimental effect on this type of soil. 

Calcium chloride definitely reduced frost action because of 
its freezing point lowering effect. The test showed that as long as the 
chemical is present in the soil, 3 percent of calcium chloride will reduce 
frost damage to a minimum by preventing freezing at -15 to -25 degrees C. 

The permanency of this admixture is one of the items that had not been 
investigated. An interesting observation, however, was that the specimen 
started heaving once the frost line had penetrated to a significant depth. 
This may indicate that the rising capillary ?/ater carried with it most of 
the chemical from the lower part of the specimen, or that the chemical is 
readily carried out from the soil by permeating water. 

The effects of Lignosol appeared to be directly proportional 
to the percentage of admixture and that 3 percent Lignosol reduced ice 
segregation to a minimum. 

In interpreting the data on these charts, as well as elsewhere 
in this paper, heaves of 5 percent or less were not considered as indicative 
of serious damage*

Rate-of-Heave Curves 

The rate-of-heave curves shown in Figures 10 to 17 present 
v a chronological record of the occurrence of frost action in all the 
specimens tested. The daily heave measurements furnished the data 
1 for the rate-of-heave curves and the daily temperature readings furnished 
the data for the cumulative temperature diagram accompanying each set of 
curves. 

The rate-of-heave curves are a qualitative measure of the 
amount of water that can be sucked up to the freezing zone. If freezing 
occurs rapidly the water is frozen into many thin layers; if it occurs 
slowly the layers are thick. 

In the laboratory the conditions are ideally suited for 
maximum ice segregation. Specimens tested under identical conditions 
can be compared as a group. Specimens of different groups may be accurately 
compared if the test conditions were identical^ the same. Ko’wever, small 
variations in test conditions may cause a large difference in heaving.

Development of Procedure for Injection of Lignosol Solution into the Soil 

In view of the success in treating frost-susceptible soils with 
Lignosol on a laboratory scale that had been previously secured at the 
University of Alberta, it was considered that a field program was warranted. 
An experimental project was carried out during the 1950-51 season to deter¬ 
mine whether a constructed railroad bed could be satisfactorily treated 
with Lignosol so as to eliminate or decrease frost heaving. 

Since its construction the Canadian National Railways have had 
considerable frost heaving problems on the main line west of Edmonton. 

The subgrade was constructed of material taken from embankments and borrow 
pits in the area and consists of a mixture of fine sand and silt (Figures 19 
and 20). The adjoining land is low-lying and covered with muskeg. Due to 
the insulating properties of the muskeg the water table is fairly well 
stabilized; its depth from the surface varies from 7 to 10 feet, usually 
rising to within 5 feet from the surface during the fall rains and the 
spring thaw. Thus with Alberta 1 s cold winters we have ideal conditions 
for frost heaving. 

Three sites which had given trouble were chosen for 

treatment with Lignosol. These were at Spruce Grove, Stony Plain, and 
Fallis. 

A hydrostatic head of approximately 12 feet was first tried 
(1950-51) but was quite slow and in the case of fine grained soils was 
not at all suitable. A -g-inch Foreman rotary gear pump powered by a 5/8 
H.P. Johnson engine and fitted with a release valve was then obtained and 
used quite successfully. 

Using the pump which gave higher pressures than the hydrostatic 

head (usually operating in the order of 10 to 15 psi.), required a little 
more care in installing the injection points.

The first injection point tried consisted of a 3/4 inch pipe 
with a spiral auger welded to it. This point was turned into the soil and 
a hose connected from the top of the injection point to the supply of 
Lignosol solution. The auger tended to crack the soil and loosen a cone- 
shaped portion of the soil around the auger, allowing the Lignosol solution 
to escape to the surface. This point was therefore abandoned. 

The next point used was merely the 3/4 inch pipe placed to a 
depth of about lgr feet in a 1-J- inch auger hole and then tamped with clay 
to provide a seal between the pipe and the subgrade material. This was 
found satisfactory for use with low pressures; where the soil was highly 
impermeable the seal quickly broke allowing the solution to escape to the 
surface. 

Both of the points first tried required the excavation of the 
ballast to the top of the subgrade, and the sinking of an auger hole to a 
depth of 3 to 4 feet below the surface of the subgrade. This and the care 
required to keep the solution from leaking up around the pipe required 
too much time so the system was abandoned. Therefore, the original 
equipment for injecting the Lignosol was redesigned during the 1951-52 
season. A projection pipe was made as shown in Figure 21.

Throughout the winter months level observations were made on 
the track at the three sites* Bench marks had to be installed to use as 
a reference elevation. These consisted of a block of concrete about one 
foot deep poured into the bottom of a 6 inch diameter auger hole that had 
been dug to a depth of 6 feet. A 3/S inch rod was anchored in the concrete 
block and extended to the surface. A one-inch diameter pipe was placed 
around the rod from just above the concrete block and extending to the 
surface, leaving the rod free and extending about 2 inches above the pipe. 
The auger hole was then backfilled with soil.

The Lignosol treatment of 1950-51 successfully prevented ex¬ 
cessive heaving at Mile 50 Fallis and was fairly successful at the Spruce 
Grove section. However it was not as effective as anticipated at the Stony 
Plain section. It was therefore proposed to re-treat the Stony Plain and 
Spruce Grove sections during the fall of 1951* The treatment at Stony 
Plain was unavoidably delayed until December 1951, at which time the frost 
line had penetrated to a depth of 3 1/2 feet. A method of removing the frozen 
ballast with a minimum of effort had to be devised. This was accomplished 
by using a kerosene pressure burner to thaw out the ballast. 

Suitable areas for the injection points were located in the 
frost heaving zone. The unequal spacing of the ties did not allow an equal 
distance between holes; some ties were too close together to allow the use 
of a shovel in cleaning out the ballast. Sites for the holes were chosen 
so as to provide a maximum working space but close enough together to allow 
complete saturation with Lignosol of the area between two adjacent holes* 

The pressure burner was used to melt the top ice layer and thaw 
out the frozen ballast below. The flame was played over the exposed area 
for a period of time (approximately 5 minutes), then switched to another 
area. The gravel was loosened by means of picks and crowbars and allowed 
to cool,off, thus transmitting its heat to the ground below. It was then 
cleaned out and the process of heating and cleaning continued. 

Once the frozen zone had been penetrated a crowbar was driven 
five or six inches into the bottom of the hole, removed and the hole 
plugged with a piece of wood. Straw was then piled and trampled down, 
completely filling the excavation and serving as an insulation.

The following day the straw was removed and a specially made 
pipe was driven into the ground so that the solution was forced into the 
soil at a depth of four and one-half feet to five and one-half feet. The 
strength of the solution varied from 33 to 35 percent by weight, depending 
on the weight of the bag of Lignosol. The majority of the bags weighed 
85 pounds thus giving a 35 percent solution. The Lignosol was hauled to 
the site in bags and mixed with water in 25 gallon drums. Using cold water 
the maximum solution strength that could be obtained in a reasonable length 
of time was 25 percent. 25 To facilitate mixing, the water was heated to a 
temperature of approximately 80 degrees F. 

The dates, amounts of solution pumped in and the spacing of the 
holes are shown on Plan No. 2. 

When the solution was first forced through into a new hole the 
pressure went up as high as 60 psi., but as soon as channels formed in the 
soil the pressure dropped from 60 psi. to a normal 6 to 10 psi. (It was a 
matter of seconds before the pressure dropped from 60 to from 6 to 10 psi.). 
After the solution was pumped in, the pipe was withdrawn and a Y/ooden peg 
driven into the hole to prevent Lignosol from an adjoining hole being 
forced out. 

The initial plan was to pump two barrels (45 gal.) of solution 
into each hole. As this figure was approached, Lignosol usually began to 
bubble out from a previous hole. In some cases the hole punched by the 
crowbar was too large 5 as a result the tt seal w around the pipe was broken 

x In the laboratory, using warm water, agitation and allowing the solution 
to stand overnight, a 100 percent solution was obtained. Thus a stronger 
solution can be used in the field if prepared beforehand.

and the solution leaked out around the pipe. Whenever this occurred the 
pipe was driven down another foot and the pumping continued until the 
solution again started to leak out. This trouble was encountered in three 
of the eight holes. 

In order to determine the approximate cost of treating sub¬ 
grades with Lignosol a careful record was kept of the total time spent in 
treating the Stony Plain section. Eight injection holes were excavated 
in the SO feet long by 10 feet wide section. 

A breakdown of the time spent on various phases of the work 
is as follows: 

Thawing and removing 3 feet of ballast 


and punching holes through to the 

unfrozen soil.80 man hours 

Hauling water to the site, heating it 

and mixing Lignosol solution ...... 10 man hours 

Installing injection points, pumping 
solution into subgrade and removing 

points .. 6 man hours 

Repairs to equipment, etc. •••••••• 3 man hours 

Back filling and tamping. •••• 6 man hours 

Miscellaneous .. g man hours 

Total 110 man hours 


Once the frost line has penetrated to any great depth this 
method of removing the frozen soil would be too costly; however, the frozen 
soil could be penetrated quickly and economically by the use of power drills 
or similar equipment. With minor modification in procedure and using 
laboratory mixed solutions it is feasible to treat subgrades during the 
early winter months.

To determine the cost of treating subgrades with Lignosol 
during the summer season, four holes were excavated at Spruce Grove. 

The solution will migrate throughout a 5 foot radius from a hole ; the 
four holes would cover an area 40 feet long by 10 feet wide. There was 
no Lignosol on hand to actually treat the section so the time for injecting 
the solution was determined from the previous winter’s work. The following 
is a breakdown of the various phases: 


Excavating 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 feet of 

ballast. 1 man hour 

Hauling water to the site and mixing 

Lignosol solution (estimated) ...... 2 man hours 

Installing and removing injection pipe 1/2 man hour 

Pumping solution (estimated) ... . . . 1 man hour 

Backfilling and tamping •••••»••• 1 man hour 

Total 5 1/2 man hours 


It took 5 1/2 man hours to treat an area 400 square feet, or 
11 man hours to treat an area of 800 square feet as compared to 110 man hours 
in December 1951. Thus, two men should easily be able to treat a section 
100 feet long in an 8 hour day.

The grain size curves for the soils from the three locations 
show that all the soils are susceptible to frost action. The soil from 
the western extremity of the frost heaving area at Spruce Grove is a fairly 
coarse sand and gravel mixture but the percentage of fines is quite high, 
making this soil capable of heaving due to ice segregation. This area is 
at a private crossing which is probably why more gravel was encountered 
there. The area to the east has a small percentage of grain sizes in the 
sand range, the greater majority of the grains being of a silt size with 
about 25% running into clay sizes. The plot of the frost heave at Spruce 
Grove, Plan 3, shows that the heaving is more pronounced as the subgrade 
ceases to be of the sand-gravel mixture. 

The soil at Stony Plain is a silty clay with between 25 to 35 
percent of clay size grains. This soil is susceptible to ice segregation 
but on a lesser scale. (The further to the right the grain size curve of 
a soil falls from Deskew*s plot of non frost heaving soils, the less 
susceptible is the soil to ice segregation.) However, the water table at 
Stony Plain is stabilized at the eight foot depth$ thus the soil would be 
saturated by capillary action (moisture content of 40 to 50 percent). When 
six feet of this soil freezes the expansion of the ice may cause an uplift 
of three or more inches. 

Since the area is within the station grounds the drainage 
conditions are also very poor. The ground to the north of this area slopes 
gradually upward to a bank about two feet higher than the existing subgrade. 
The area to the south carries a spur track and is therefore flat. When 
the periodic levels were taken at this place during the winter, it was 
noted that following a thaw the area lay under a two-inch coating of ice

or water, depending on the temperature. After a mild spell the water 
penetrated into the subgrade, froze and caused the track to heave. Sub¬ 
sequent snowfalls and thaws increased the heaving. 

The Fallis soil is a sandy silt with about 5 percent of clay 
size grains. This type of soil is most susceptible to ice segregation 
providing the other requirements are met. With the water table at the 
seven foot depth and the severe winters, this area would normally give 
the most severe frost damage, but the levels indicated only a very slight 
displacement. In the freezing cabinet the ice segregation produced heaves 
of over 50 percent of the height of soil. 

Field Results 

Plans No. 1 to 3 show the injection points, amount of solution 
injected at each point and the changes in elevation of «set« points. The 
«set w points were nails driven into every second tie, throughout the length 
of the frost heaving area. The elevations were taken to the nearest one- 
hundredth part of one foot and in a few instances the plot of the elevations 
is somewhat erratic. This was probably due to the rodman not centering the 
rod directly over the nail, or the ice which usually covered the nail heads 
was not completely removed. 

The data as plotted on Plan No. 1 shows that the Lignosol 
treatment at Fallis (1950-51) successfully prevented excessive heaving 
for the second season. No shimming was required within the treated area 
(Figure 24) > whereas untreated areas heaved and had to be shimmed as shown 
in Figures 23 and 25. 

The C.N.3. maintenance crew had at one time removed the detri¬ 
mental material for about 50 feet on each side of the treated area

(see Plan 1) and replaced it with a sand-gravel mixture. Because of 
poor selection of the back-fill material, or using some of the excavated 
material along with the gravel, the area still has some tendency to heave. 
The centre portion of the area, which is the original subgrade was treated 
with Lignosol. The treatment reduced the heave so that it is of the same 
magnitude as that of the excavated and back-filled areas; as a result, 
although there is still some heaving, it is fairly uniform and does not 
cause any appreciable damage. Levels which were taken during the summer 
of 1952 showed that there was very little settlement once the ground was 
completely thawed. 

Plan No. 3 shows the data for the Spruce Grove section 
(treated in 1950). There was no differential heaving; the maximum heave 
recorded was less than 0.3 feet which could have been caused by the freezing 
of interstitial water. This area required no maintenance throughout the 
winter and levels taken during the summer showed no undue settlement. The 
track east of Spruce Grove was realigned during the summer of 1952, follow¬ 
ing the last set of levels (August 6, 1952) with more ballast being added 
and tamped under the ties; therefore a new set of zero readings should be 
taken at this section before the fall freeze. 

The data for the Stony Plain section is shown on Plan 2. This 
area was treated in 1950 and re-treated in December 1951. The results of 
the treatment will be discussed in detail as special factors enter which 
are not applicable to the other two treated areas. The heaving was not 
excessive throughout the winter of 1951-52; the highest recorded value was 
slightly higher than 0.4 feet. Since the area is in the station grounds 
all trains proceed at a low speed and no shimming was required. Following

the very wet spring excessive settlement and springiness of the track 
was noted* The levels showed that there was a maximum displacement of 
0.6 feet between the elevations taken in February and those taken in 
August. 

A total of 320 gallons of solution was pumped into the sub¬ 
grade in December 1951. The length of the treated area was 77 feet and 
the width 10 feet (taking a diffusion of 5 feet on each side of the hole). 
The solution if uniformly dispersed throughout the area would be 0.066 
feet deep. Upon freezing and expanding y percent the thickness of ice 
would be 0.072 feet. A severe frost of four weeks duration followed the 
treatment. The next set of levels indicated a heave varying from 0.02 to 
0.20 feet throughout the area, the average being 0.08 feet which compares 
favorably with the computed heave. The concentration of solution near 
the injection holes could account for the uneven heaving. 

It was impossible to back fill the frozen ballast properly, 
thus leaving numerous voids through which surface water could percolate 
downward, and the frost line at these points would go down deeper and 
faster. 

Following the severe frost there was a mild spell during which 
excessive thawing occurred and when the next set of levels were taken a 
perceptible heave was again noted. There was still some water covering 
this area at the time, although most of the snow had thawed. It is 
probable that the heaving was caused by the surface water draining down 
into the soil during the mild spell, especially in places which were 
back filled. The subsequent freezing during the night and on encountering 
the frozen soil underneath caused heaving.

The displacement of the track was almost identical during 
the two winters, but no levels were taken during the summer of 1951 
to determine the lowest elevation of the subgrade. 

The absence of a snow cover and the disturbed ballast allowed 
the frost line to penetrate to depths well beyond the five foot range, 
generally taken as the average for this region. Consequently when the 

X 

levels were taken in May 1952, the subgrade was still frozen. and it 
was not until early in June that the ground was completely thawed out. 

This was when the C.N.R. maintenance crew reported a springiness of the 
track. The frozen subgrade prevented the downward seepage of the water 
from the melting ice layers, and the heavy precipitation caused an 
accumulation of water just below the ballast. As a result when the sub¬ 
grade thawed out the moisture content was very high, tending to make it 
sloppy. No failure occurred because of the load bearing action of the 
ballast but definite movements were noted when a heavy train passed over 
the area. The track settled as much as 0.2 feet under the load, to spring 
back to its original elevation once the train had passed. (Damage to road t 
- in Alberta during the spring of 1952 was so severe that traffic was- 

eomplotely disrupted in places until tho faulty are a could be repai re d . 

This was eaus e d b y the l argo a c cu mula tion of moisture in the oubgrade 


The Stony Plain area will undoubtedly give trouble until some 
suitable drainage for the surface water is provided. The general opinion 
is that if the surface water is drained off the Lignosol treatment would

In May 1952 frozen soil was encountered at a depth of 1 1/2 feet below 
the surface muskeg, and at a depth of 6 inches in a shaded area.

eliminate or give a negligible heave. An area east of the station 
grounds, but with fair drainage has given considerable trouble and 
it was suggested that this area be treated and used as a comparison 
for determining the amount of heaving caused by the freezing of 
surface water which has percolated into the soil. 

Injection Pipe 

The injection pipe as shown in Figure 21 was found to be 
very satisfactory for the job. Some trouble was first encountered with 
the hose connection pipe breaking off under the vibrating effect caused 
by hammering the pipe into the ground. The initial attachment was a 
piece of pipe welded to the main pipe. This broke off after a few blows 
and a couple of braces were then welded to help take the jarring effect. 
This worked a little better but still gave trouble and the final solution 
was a soft brass weld. This was flexible enough not to crack while 
driving and the rest of the section was treated using this pipe. The 
frozen soil had to be removed before the pipe could be driven into the 
subgrade in winter. During the summer trial the ballast was removed as 
it consisted of rock and gravel, but where the soil was fine gravel with 
no rocks the pipe could be driven into the subgrade with no excavation 
whatsoever. Sven where excavation is necessary, only the top foot or 
two of rock and gravel need be removed (fifteen to twenty minutes work 
per hole), as the point penetrates very readily into the soil, especially 
after a rain when the ground is soft. The pipe is very easily pulled out 
of the ground after the treatment. The holes made by the pipe should be 
plugged after use. When the pipe was moved to a new* position and pumping

commenced, the underground pressure which was built up would force 
the solution to bubble out from a previous hole. These holes could 
probably be sealed by wooden pegs, 2 to 3 feet long. With minor 
modifications this pipe could be used for large field programs. 

Pressure Injection 

The one-half inch Foreman rotary gesjr pump powered by a 
5/S H.P. Johnson engine was found to be very satisfactory, both for 
efficiency and simplicity of operation. The pump is capable of producing 
pressures up to 60 psi. and the mounted pump and engine can be very 
easily carried by two people. The complete set of equipment for 
treating areas with Lignosol can easily be carried in a car. 

Solution Strength and Mixing 

Solution strengths of 100 percent by weight can be easily 
obtained providing it is thoroughly mixed and allowed to stand for a 
period of six to twelve hours. This solution would allow' a more complete 
saturation of the soil with Lignosol. The solution could either be mixed 
in a large tank in the field and allowed to stand overnight before using, 
or mixed in the laboratory and hauled to the field in tanks. 

Cost of Treatment 

The method previously described of thawing and removing 
frozen ballast is not practical. Specialized equipment could be used in 
penetrating the frozen ballast to economically treat the subgrade during 
the winter months. However, treatment should be made before the ground 
has frozen too deeply thus giving the solution a chance to diffuse 
throughout the soil. The cost as determined during the summer of 1952 
is approximately ten cents per square foot of treated area. This includes 
the cost of the Lignosol and of the periodic inspections and check levels.

LABORATORY RESULTS 

Permeability 

The results of the consolidation tests run on the East 
Kootenay silt were used to compute the permeabilities. Corrections 
were made for density and viscosity of the Lignosol solution. Five test 
specimens of the silt were tested in this manner. They contained 0, 2, 4> 

6 and 8 percent Lignosol respectively. Similar tests were run on the glass 
spheres with specimens containing 0, 2, 5> 6 and 7 percent Lignosol, 

The results of these tests are shown in Figure 1. The test results 
indicate: 

1. The effect of the Lignosol was to decrease the permeability of 
both materials. 

2. The addition of 4 percent Lignosol reduced the permeability of 
the silt to one-half of that with no Lignosol. The addition of 
8 percent Lignosol reduced the permeability to one-tenth its 
original value. 

3. Two percent Lignosol reduced the permeability of the glass to 
one-half of that with no Lignosol. 

Seven percent Lignosol reduced the permeability to one five- 
hundredth of its original value. 

4. In both materials the reduction in permeability was greater at 
the higher bearing pressures. 


Density and Viscosity 

The density and the viscosity of the Lignosol solution increased 
with the solution strength (Table 2). 

The results of the viscosity tests were plotted on semi-log 
paper (Figure 9). There were no solutions tested between the forty to 
one hundred percent strength, but the graph shows the tendency to form a 
straight line between these two points. 

Figure 8 is a graphical plot of the density test results.

Leaching Tests 

Since Lignosol is water soluble it was assumed that the 
solution would be gradually leached out of the treated soil. In the 
laboratory leaching tests water was forced through the treated specimen 
until the outflow water was clear. All specimens were examined after 
leaching. The soil in all cades was smooth to the touch as it is when 
Lignosol is known to be present. The untreated soil was gritty to the 
touch. The smoothness was apparent despite the fact that there was in 
most cases no visual trace of Lignosol. The one exception was in the 
Alcan-Kootenay-glass mixture in which the water had channeled through 
the sample leaving small isolated pockets of Lignosol. 

Assuming that the effect of Lignosol on soils can be detected 
by feeling whether it is smooth or gritty, the test results indicate that 
although Lignosol can be readily leached out of the soil some residual 
effect remains. 

Freezing Tests 

Laboratory freezing tests were run on various mixtures of 
soil and inert glass spheres, using varying types and percentages of 
admixture. 

Six specimens were tested at one time under identical 
temperature conditions. The results of these tests are shown in 
Tables 3 to 10 and Figures 10 to 17. 

Table 3 and Figure 10 show clearly the effect of varying 


percentages of Lignosol on the frost heaving properties of the East 
Kootenay silt. With an admixture of 4 percent Lignosol the heave was 
negligible; 8 and 10 percent Lignosol gave no movement whatsoever.

It was expected that some heaving would occur due to the freezing of 
the interstitial water, but from observations on varying strengths of 
Lignosol solution it was noted that the solution when frozen becomes 
a slush and not a solid mass. Some of the water freezes and crystalizes, 
but the remaining more concentrated solution remains in the form of a 
slush. A 50 percent water-Lignosol solution remained unfrozen at 
-20 degrees F. 

Results of test specimens Nos. 7 to 12 are shown in Table 4 
Figure 11. The material was the inert glass, mixture "A". The maximum 
heave recorded was 4*5 percent. This occurred with a 4 percent admixture. 
Lignosol contents lower and higher than 4 percent gave less pronounced 
heaving. This heave was small compared to the heaving of other test soils. 
Therefore for all practical purposes the material may be considered as 
not susceptible to ice segregation. 

Table 5, Figure 12 brings out clearly the effect of Lignosol 
on a mixture of soil and glass spheres. The heave in the Alcan-Kootenay- 
glass mixture was 33*5 percent with no admixture, 19*0 percent with 2 
percent Lignosol and 10.9 percent with 3 percent Lignosol. 

Tests were also conducted on a specimen of East Kootenay silt 
which had been treated with an admixture of 8 percent Lignosol and. then 
subjected to a leaching test. The water issuing from the sample was clear 
after an equivalent of 21 inches had been forced through. A specimen was 
cut from the leached sample and subjected to freezing temperatures. To 
determine the residual effect, if any, of the Lignosol treatment, a specimen 
of untreated material with a moisture content and density as close as 
possible to that of the leached specimen was tested at the sane time.

The untreated specimen had a maximum heave of 43 percent while the 
leached specimen heaved 35 percent, indicating some residual effect. 

Tests No. 19 to 24 (Table 6, Figure 13) show the results 
of treating the •‘A” glass spheres with Lignosol and aerosol. A 5 percent 
heave occurred in specimens treated with 2 and 4 percent Lignosol, while 
specimens treated with 2 and 4 percent aerosol heaved 10 and 7 percent 
respectively. 

The other two specimens consisted of soil from the Fallis 
test section. It is clearly shown that this soil is very susceptible 
to frost action. The laboratory specimens heaved over 60 percent. 

Tests No. 25 to 30 (Table 7, Figure 14) give the results 
for the Fallis soil with different admixtures. The initial moisture 
content was the same but the effect of the admixtures made it impossible 
to get the same density in all cases. Three percent of Lignosol reduced 
the heave to 7.2 percent. The specimen treated with 3 percent Lignosol 
and leached with 40 inches of water produced a heave of 51*8 percent. 

The aerosol (3 percent by weight) had no marked effect and a 
maximum heave of 51.2 percent was recorded. Three percent of calcium 
chloride reduced the heave duping the early stage of the test. From the 
observations on the test specimen it was noticed that calcium chloride in 
the soil lowers the freezing point so that a lower temperature is required 
to produce the ice lenses that cause frost heave. The top of the sample 
did not freeze until the sixth day, producing a 3 percent heave. Excessive 
heaving was noted once the frost line had penetrated to a depth of about 
4 inches. A heave of nearly 25 percent occurred in the last six days of 
the test, making a total heave of 47.2 percent.

Laboratory tests showed that the freezing point of pure 
water is lowered from 32 degrees F. to 23 degrees F. by the addition 
of 10 percent of calcium chloride. Any fraction or multiple of this 
percentage will lower the freezing point by a corresponding amount; 
that is, the freezing point lowering is directly proportional to the 
amount of chemical present. 

A solution of calcium chloride does not freeze solid at, or 
just belovj, its freezing point — only a feu crystals of ice are formed. 

This ice is composed of nearly pure water, which upon being frozen, 
releases its calcium chloride. The extra calcium chloride is added to 
the remaining solution making it more concentrated and thus lowering its 
freezing point. Because of this mechanism, a 10 percent solution does 
not freeze solid until a temperature of -2 degrees F. is reached. This 
low solid-freezing point permits the use of relatively small percentages 
to be effective in minimizing frost damage. 

A soil containing 3 percent by weight of calcium chloride 
remained unfrozen at a temperature of -20 degrees F. 

Laboratory tests showed that calcium chloride is readily 
leached out of the soil. In the freezing test the movement of the water 
leached out the calcium chloride. When the frost line had penetrated to 
the depth of this leached soil excessive heaving occurred. 

In the field calcium chloride tends to migrate downward, 
with the percolating water. Once it has leached out of the freezing 
zone the soil is again susceptible to frost action. 

A specimen of East Kootenay silt treated with 6 percent Lignosol 
and leached with 21 inches of water heaved 31.B percent as compared with 
43*0 and 35*3 percent for no admixture tests (Specimen Nos. 13 and 1 
respectively).

Tests No* 31 to 36 (Table S, Figure 15) were on soils from 
the three test sections. Undisturbed samples from the Fallis test 
section were taken on May 3, 1952, and from the Stony Plain and Spruce 
Grove sections on August 6, 1952. Samples No. 32 and 36 were taken at 
the 1951 injection points, Plan 2. 

The presence of Lignosol in Specimen No. 32 was detected by 
the dark colored pockets and by a musty odor. Lignosol treated laboratory 
samples developed a strong characteristic musty or mouldy odor when kept 
in sealed containers for periods of four or more weeks. Specimen No. 36 
had the musty odor but no visible trace of the solution. Both specimens 
heaved over 40 percent. Specimen No. 31 was from the untreated section, 
which has given no trouble; the heave was thirty-six percent. Specimen 
No. 33 was the coarse sand from Spruce Grove, while No. 34 was the silty 
sand. The latter sample ?/as taken from the 1950 injection point. There 
is a marked difference in frost heaving between the two soils. The coarse 
sand heaved 25 percent while the silty sand heaved 45 percent. 

Specimen No. 35 was the Fallis soil treated with 3 percent 
aerosol. The heave was 104 percent, which definitely shows that aerosol 
has a detrimental effect on the frost heaving properties of this soil. 

The soil from the treated section at Stony Plain was leached 
with fifteen inches of water, then tested in the frost action cabinet. 

The results of this test are shown in Table 9, Figure 16, Specimens 
No. 39 and 41. The first specimen heaved over 57 percent while the 
latter heaved only 36 percent. The initial moisture content and density 
in both specimens ?/as almost identical.

The Alcan-Kootenay-glass mixture treated with 8 percent 
Lignosol and leached with 25 inches of water heaved 10 percent as 
compared to 33*5 percent for Specimen No. 15. As explained previously 
the solution did not all leach out of Specimen No. 40; there was 
approximately 30 percent of the Lignosol still in the soil although the 
water forced through the sample was clear* The water ^channeled” 
through the material leaving isolated pockets of Lignosol. 

The soil from Stony Plain was treated with 3 percent Lignosol 
and tested (Specimens No. 44 and 46). In all the tests on the soil from 
this section it was noted that the soil from the 11 feet east site heaved 
more than that from the 52 feet east site. From the grain size curves 
it was seen that the latter soil is well graded. Consequently the void 
ratio and permeability are lower. This type of soil is then less 
susceptible to frost action. 

In the Spruce Grove soil 3 percent Lignosol reduced the heave 
to 9 percent. 

Lignosol reduced the heave in the H B M glass spheres. Specimens 
Nos. 38, 47 and 48. Specimen No. 27 when treated with 6 percent Lignosol 
and then leached with 40 inches of water heaved almost twice as much as 
the untreated glass (Sample No, 33). 

Lignosol may change the void space in the soil so that a 
sandy soil would have the same permeability as a silt.

CONCLUSIONS 


1* Method of Injection 

Using the method described in this investigation it was 
difficult to inject sufficient solution to give the optimum quantity 
of 3 to 4 percent Lignosol in the treated zone. This has not proved 
to be as serious as previously expected due to the fact that the 
solution permeates more readily into the more permeable soil strata and 
thus contributes to the effectiveness of the field treatment. The 
solution strength used throughout the field investigations was between 
thirty-three and thirty-five percent. 

The viscosity of the solution increases rapidly with the 
addition of Lignosol. With the more impermeable soils higher solution 
strengths tended to break the seal and leak out around the injection 
pipe. With silty soils the more viscous solutions and higher pressures 
caused channels to form through the soil. With time the Lignosol 
solution then gradually permeated throughout the soil. 

The injection pipe shown in Figure 21 maintains a good seal 
when driven 3 or 4 feet into the soil. With a good seal more viscous 
solutions and higher pressures can be used. The viscosity of the solution 
decreases when heated; warming the solution before injecting it into the 
soil would therefore allow the use of more concentrated solutions. 

2. Effectiveness of Treatment 

Lignosol is readily leached out of the laboratory specimens 
but some residual effect remains. The outflow water was usually clear 
after 20 or more inches of water had been forced through the sample.

In the field Lignosol was injected into the soil at a 
depth of 4 to 5 feet. The migration of water due to rains and 
evaporation usually occurs in the top two feet of the soil. It is 
only following a spring thaw or a heavy rain that there is an 
appreciable movement of water at the five foot depth. Thus it may 
be a matter of four or five years before 20 inches of water passes 
through the treated soil. 

The field trial sections have been observed for t?/o 
winters with no evidence of rapid leaching. 

The following table gives the maximum and average heave 
for the three test sections. The increase percent heave was computed 
assuming that 5 feet of the soil had frozen.

The three sites chosen for treatment with Lignosol were 
short sections which had given trouble and were easily accessible for 
treatment. The maximum heave at these sections before treatment was 
usually about 0.4 feet (over and above the heave caused by the freezing 
of interstitial water). This is a conservative figure but will be used 
in this analysis. 

For Fallis the computed heave caused by the freezing of the 
water in the voids was 0.07 feet. The total heave for this section before 
freezing was then 0.47 feet. 

The treatment at Fallis thus reduced the heave by 68 percent 
the first winter and by 60 percent the second winter. From Plate 1 it was 
seen that the heave for the treated section and for the section where the 
detrimental material was excavated and replaced with non-heaving material 
was almost identical. 

The important fact for the Fallis section was that the Lignosol 
treatment reduced the heave in the original subgrade so that it was of the 
same magnitude as that in the ^replaced i! section. The difference between 
the maximum and average heave was small, showing a uniform heave throughout 
the area, thereby eliminating the necessity for shimming. 

There is therefore no evidence of any large increase in ice 
segregation due to the leaching out of the Lignosol. 

For Stony Plain the computed heave due to the expansion of the 
soil moisture on freezing was 0.22 feet. The total heave for this section 
was then 0.62 feet. 

The percent reduction in heave was 27 percent in 1950-51 and 
10 percent in 1951-52. The drainage in this area is very poor as previously 
mentioned and most of the heave was probably caused by the surface water

percolating into the soil and freezing. The more severe heave in 1951-52 
was possibly due to the water penetrating more readily through the injection 
holes. 

The total heave for Spruce Grove was taken as 0.54 feet. The 
Lignosol treatment reduced the heave by 61 percent the first year and 33 
percent the second year. 

The initial amount of Lignosol injected at Spruce Grove was 
In 

possibly/'sufficient to completely eliminate ice segregation. Leaching 
further reduced its effectiveness. It is suggested then that this section 
be retreated. 

With the more severe laboratory conditions the heave in the 
specimens from the three test sites ranged from 35 to 60 percent. A specimen 
from the treated section at Stony Plain heaved an additional 15 percent after 
leaching. There is then some Lignosol left in the soil after one year. 

3. Cost of Tre atment versus Shimming 

The following is a breakdown of the approximate cost of shimming 
a heaved section of track. The maximum heave is assumed to be three inches 
and the length of the heaved section as fifty feet. 

To give a uniform approach and departure, at least three rail 
lengths have to be shimmed on either side of the heaved area. The total 
length of shimmed track would then be 280 feet. 

The track would have to be re-shimmed three times before the 
maximum heave occurred. To lower the track to its original level requires 
two stages. Six men are required to do the necessary shimming in an eight 
hour day. Thus 240 man hours would be consumed in placing and removing the 


shims

Thus the yearly cost of shimming a 50 foot heaved section would 
be approximately six dollars per lineal foot. 

The Lignosol treatment, if good for only one season, would give 
a saving of approximately five dollars per lineal foot of heaved area. 

This treatment would definitely be economical in cases where 
treating short lengths of track would eliminate extensive shimming* 

The unit cost of shimming long heaved sections would be 
somewhat lower, for shorter sections somewhat higher. 

Modifications in equipment and procedure could further reduce 
the cost of treatment. 

There is a slow order of 20 miles per hour for all trains 
proceeding through the heaved areas. This constitutes an additional 
expense v/hich was not included in this analysis.

4. Resid u al E f fect 

Laboratory test results indicate some residual effect* 

For the East Kootenay silt the reduction in percent heave due to the 
residual effect was 12 percent in one case and 4 percent in another. 

In the Alcan-Kootenay-glass mixture the reduction in heave 
was 23 percent. The lignosol in this case was not completely leached 
out of the soil. 

In the soils tested there was a proportional decrease in- 
ice segregation with an increase in Lignosol content. The residual 
effect of the Lignosol (after leaching) also reduced frost action. 

With the inert glass spheres there was no such correlation. 
The frost action was reduced with 5 percent of Lignosol. This was 
probably due to the reduction in surface tension of the water. However, 
the leached sample heaved twice as much as the untreated one. 

5. Other Admixtures 

Calcium Chloride because of its freezing point depressent 
effect, provides good resistance to frost action wherever the temperature 
does not fall below a certain mark (depending on the strength of the 
solution). 

Aerosol (3 percent) had a detrimental effect on the frost 
heaving properties of the Fallis soil. The test specimen heaved over 
100 percent. 

Action of Lignosol 

The hypothesis that frost action is reduced by wetting 
agents was proved erroneous. Aerosol, which is superior to Lignosol 
in reducing surface tension did not afford, any protection against ice 
segregation.

The most probable explanation is that the addition of Lignosol reduces the 
void space in the soil. Thus the permeability of a treated silt may be in 
the order of that commonly encountered in ciAys. 

The reduction of permeability by the addition of Lignosol may 
have a wide range of application in engineering practice. It could be used 
to decrease the seepage losses through canal banks, dykes and earth dams. 

Rate-of-Heave Curves 

It was impossible to freeze the various groups of specimens 
under identical conditions. Thus the amount of heave of a specimen in a 
particular group could be compared with the amount of heave of any other 
specimen in that group. However, it was only possible to make a rough 
iSive comparison between specimens of different groups. 

An attempt was therefore made to reduce the percentage heave 
to some common basis. The most logical basis on which to make a comparison 
seemed to be the percent heave per degree hour of frost. Similar specimens 
which were tested in different groups were compared for percent heave per 
degree hour of freezing. The results are shown in Table A* 

An examination of these results showed that no correlation exists. 

A further analysis was made by comparing the percent heave of 
these same specimens over a short interval of time, at which time the 
specimens were heaving at their maximum rate. The results are shown in 
Table B. 

These results are not conclusive, but there appears to be the 
same order of heave during the time the heave was at the maximum rate.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS 

1# The method developed for injecting the Lignosol solution into the 
subgrade is portable and simple in operation. Modifications in 
procedure could make the method more efficient. 

2. The Lignosol treatment is effective for two or more years. 

3. The cost of treating subgrades with Lignosol is approximately 10 cents 
per square foot. The annual cost of shimming a short heaved area is 

far' 

approximately 60 cents per square foot. 

fa 

4* Lignosol reduced ice segregation in all the **test soils* 1 . 

5. Lignosol is more effective than Calcium chloride or Aerosol in 
reducing frost action. 

6. Lignosol reduced the permeability of the test soil and the inert glass 
spheres.
