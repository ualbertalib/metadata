INTRODUCTION. 


The field of modern atomic physics ia mainly a 
study of the constitution of the atomic nucleus, the 
electro-magnetic properties of its constituent 
particles and their behavior when interacting with 
each other* A great deal of information concerning 
the behavior of bound electrons, such as the extra- 
nuclear electrons of an atom, has been gained from 
a thorough study of the line spectra of the elements. 

It is hoped that the laws of motion and interaction 
of electrons thus derived may be carried over into 
the field of nuclear physics to furnish a reason¬ 
ably complete explanation of the observed phenomena 
associated with the nucleus. Considerable progress 
has already been made along these lines* 

Of late years the domain of spectroscopy has been 
extended to the field of nuclear physics. With the 
development of optical instruments of high resolution, 
it became evident that many atomic spectrum lines were 
not single as expected, but consisted of a number of 
components. This hyperfine structure was not amenable 
to explanation in terms of a theory which regarded 
the atomic nucleus merely as a massive charged particle* 
Concurrently with quantitative measurements of this 
hyperfine structure, theories of its cause were

formulated. It was soon recognized that a study 
of hyperfine structure might provide a fruitful 
source of knowledge concerning the properties of 
the nucleus. Although nothing about the nuclear 
constitution can be learned from hyperfine structure, 
values of its total mechanical angular momentum and 
magnetic moment may be deduced. The numerical values 
of these two properties fcrm a critical test for a 
theory of nuclear constitution. 

At present there are three effects in terms of 
which the main features of hyperfine structure are 
explained. If an element is comprised of more than 
one Isotope, each will give rise to an atomic spectrum 
which may differ slightly from that of the others. 

This is termed the isotope displacement effect. By 
including in the Hamiltonian of the atomic system the 
kinetic energy of the nucleus there result two types 
of displacement in the energy levels. One is due to 
a change in the Rydberg constant,and is the same for 
all levels. The effect is only observable in the case 
of light elements, most markedly in hydrogen (a). The 
other type of displacement varies from term to term and 
may be traced to a set of terms in the Hamiltonian 
representing an interaction between the momenta of the 
extra-nuclear electrons (b). The consequences of this

effect for the two neon isotopes has been worked out 
by Bartlett and Gibbons (c). They found that the 
theoretical displacement of the energy levels, although 
in the right direction, were much smaller than the 
observed shifts* 

A second reason for isotope structure is a 
deviation from the Coulomb law in the region near the 
nucleus* By assuming nuclei of finite radius which 
varies with the atomic weight, Racah, Rosenthal and 
Breit (d) have had some success in explaining large 
isotope displacements such as occur in thallium* 

Recently Schuller and Schmidt (e) have also considered 
the effects on the levels of single isotopes of 
deviations from spherical symmetry of, the nuclear 
field. However, many outstanding discrepancies still 
remain which throw doubt upon the assumptions and 
methods of theoretical predictions® 

The second type of structure, which is called 
hyperfine structure to distinguish it from isotope 
structure, occurs in elements which have but one 
isotope. Pauli (f) suggested that this was due to 
the existence of a nuclear angular momentum with an 
associated magnetic moment.

Successful theoretical interpretations have been made 
on the basis of this assumption so that it is at 
present possible to deduce the numerical values of 
these moments from a knowledge of the hyperfine energy 
level separations of the atom in question. To determine 
energy level separations of an atom it is necessary 
to measure the wave-number separations of the 
components of its spectrum lines. It is the object 
of this investigation to determine a number of energy 
level separations of singly-ionized thallium {H II) 
and from some of these to evaluate its nuclear magnetic 
moment. 

The hyperfine structure of Tl n has been of 

interest because of its simplicity and the magnitude 

of the separations to be measured. Also, its term 

analysis is fairly complete, through the efforts of 

a number of investigators (g). The hyperfine structure 

of some of the lines were observed by the above.

Smith and Convey (j) greatly extended the analysis 
with improved accuracy, the latter (j) calculating 
a number of values for the magnetic moment* In the 
investigations of both of the above, many large 
isotope displacements were observed* 

Previous investigators have been concerned with 
those spectrum lines associated with the lower terms 
of II II, In the type of light source used in 
interferometer work, lines associated with the higher 
terms are generally fainter* Unfortunatfily, it is a 
custom to choose only the strongest and most easily 
accessible lines of a spectrum first, and neglecting 
those which entail more experimental difficulty; even 
though they are equally interesting from a theoretical 
point of view. Since a considerable amount of data 
on thallium has already been accumulated, it was 
considered worthwhile to extend this to higher terms 
so that a comparison of the structure of a number of 
terms of the same kind and belonging to the same 
spectrum would be possible. In the case of T1 II 
many of these lines are in a rather difficult region 
of the spectrum* Some of these, in the region 
2600A - 5250A were investigated with the use of the 
quartz Lummer - Gehrke plate. As only plane - 
polarized light may be used with an interferometer 
of this type, an added difficulty was met with. A

Mcol prism,which may be used to eliminate one of 
the plane-polarized components,was found to absorb 
effectively all radiation below 3200&* Consequently, 
a V/ollaston prism had to be used* This separates 
the two component vibrations by only a small angle, 
instead of absorbing one as does the Niool* When the 
two images of the light source are formed, they 
overlap almost completely* Only the light forming 
that part of one image clear of the other can be used* 
This greatly reduces the amount of light acting on the 
photographic emulsion,so that exposures of from ten to 
forty hours 1 duration were required. Considerable 
difficulty was encountered in maintaining the strength 
of the light source throughout these long periods, as 
well as in keeping other conditions,mainly the 
temperature of the optical apparatus, unaltered.

THEORY 0? HYPERFIUE STRUCTURE 


The fundamental postulate (f) of the present 

theory of the hyperfine structure of atomic energy 

levels is the existence of a nuclear angular momentum 

with an associated co-directed magnetic moment* We 

shall denote these vectors by ~X and respectively and 

connect them by the relation 

£ = £ (I), e. I AD 

i 1838 Bme 


where g (I) - the nuclear g factor 

1 ~ m ratio of mass of electron to that 

18ZB 2 M of proton* 

and the universal constants e,h, m,c have the 

conventional meanings 

e~eleetronie charge 

h«-Planckfs constant 

m-eleetronie mass 

c-veloeity of light. 

The vector 1 is defined quantum - mechanically as is the 

general atomic angular momentum vector "S' (ref. (k) eq.n*3,p.46) 

Eigenvalues of l fc and any one component I a are 

I (1+1 jh*' where I is any integer or 
4ir % half-integer. 


and where M x is integral or 

Itr half-integral as I is 

integral or half-integral. 

M r has the range of values 

I, 1-1, 1-2, ........... --(I-l),-I. 

The values of I for the elements of odd atomic weight have 
been found to be half-integral (k) p. 424-. and zero for 
elements of even atomic weight.

The magnetic moment of the nucleus gives rise to 
a magnetic field with which the extra-nuclear electrons 
interact* The resultant interaction can be divided into 
two parts, one of which is associated with all the 
electrons in closed shells. This is constant for all 
energy levels and hence may be disregarded. The other 
part, associated with the valence or optical electrons 
causes the splitting of the ordinary fine-structure 
multiplet levels into hyperfine levels. Tor the 
purpose of the following theoretical calculations it will 
be assumed that the nuclear interaction energy is small 
as compared to the energy of electrostatic and spin-orbit 
interactions. An expression for the nuclear interaction 
energy H f has been adopted in the form 

H« = * I. J......(1) 

where * is a constant for a given fine structure 
multiplet or J level and the vector J represents the 
total angular momentum of all the optical electrons. 

This energy is then considered as a small perturbation 
on the J levels. Actually, the assumption that H ? is 
small is not always valid and there occur discrepancies 
between theory and experiment which can be explained by 
treating the nuclear interaction (1) on au equal footing 
with the spin-orbit interaction. Goudsmit and Bacher (1#) 
have carried through detailed calculations of this kind 
for the case of the anom2p.ous levels of mercury and 
aluminum.

In the following pages methods of evaluating the 
intervals between hyperfine levels by use of the 
expression (1) will be indicated. As the calculations 
are rather complex, the results for the case of a one 
valence electron atomic system will be partly quoted in 
section (A). In section (B) the results of (A) will be 
used in the calculations of a two electron system. 

(A) Single Electron System. 

Neglecting nuclear interaction, the energy levels of 
a single electron system in the absence of an external 
field are characterized by the set of quantum numbers l^.nos.) 
n ,1,3 ,mj,I ,M* , where 

n— The total q_.no. of the valence electron. 

1 --the orbital angular momentum q_. no. 

j - the total angular momentum q_.no. 

mj --the q_.no. of any one component of the vector 
customarily the z component . 

I —the nuclear angular momentum q_.no. 

Mj — the q_.no. of the z component of the vector I. 

Ihe energy levels are degenerate in or independent of 
the values of mj and M^or any other quantum numbers derived 
from these two. Including the weak interaction (1) in the 
Hamiltonian of the system removes part- of this degeneracy, 
for each multiplet or j level is divided into several by its 
addition. 

According to quantum-mechanical perturbation theory 
(ref. (k) chap.II), the eigenvalues of H 1 , or the 
displacements of the hyperfine levels from the unperturbed

j levels, are given by the diagonal elements of a 
matrix in which is diagonal with respect to 

the quantum numbers representing the degeneracy in 
the unperturbed j levels i.e. a pair of quantum 
numbers derived from ny, Mx. We define the vector 
as the total angular momentum of the atomic system, 
i.e. the sum 

It is defined quanturn-mechanically as we define I on 
page 7. As it is the sum of *1 and 1, its quantum 
number f, will have the range of values 

(i+j), (i+j-i).. -£-ji • 

and for any value of f, the quantum number m^of any one 
component of If, will have the range^values 

• f, (f-1), (f-2),.. -f . 

For a discussion of the addition of angular momentum 
vectors kindly see ref.(k) chap. 3, sec.6. 

Hence, we may derive from the degenerate quantum 
numbers mj, M x , the numbers f, m* , in which H 1 is 
diagonal. Thus, the eigenvalues of H ? are given to 
a first approximation by 

m,) 

in the notation of ref. (k) 

Comparing this expression with ref. (k) chap. II sec.9 5 
note that we have co-related the set (n,%, j) with their n$ 
* ; the quantum number f with their number % and the 

perturbation H 1 with their V.

we have

The eigenvalues of (2) are the displacements of 
the hyperfine or f levels from the unperturbed j levels. 

The form of (2) shows that the intervals between f levels 
obey the Lands"interval rule, which reads in this ease - - 
the interval between two adjacent f levels is proportional 
to the higher f value of the pair. Experimentally 
observed intervals generally follow this rule quite well. 

The observations of Smith and Beggs (m) on the spec tram 
of Bi II are a good example of its verification. 

As shown by Fermi (n) , the value of I may be 
deduced from the equation (2) by a measurement of the 
relative intensities of the components of a line for 
which either the initial or the final level has a small 
or zero hyperfine structure.

The theoretically difficult part of the problem 
is theevaluation of the constant a(j) of (2)* 
Hargreaves, Casimir, Goudsmit (o) and others have 
obtained values of a(j) for the case of an electron 
whose X value is not zero. These values were obtained* 
non-relativistieally, by treating the nucleus and 

ehav3<icf 

optical electron simply as a pair of^magnetic particles. 
For s eleetr.ons (2=0), an expression was derived by Fermi 
(n). By introducing the magnetic field due to the 
nucleus into the Dirac equation of the electron (p), 

on 

Breit and Doermann (q) obtain A expression^ Sif^H 1 which 
is then used in the Schroedinger equation with the 
results of both Goudsmit (o) and Fermi (n), These 
calculations clearly indicate the nature of the 
approximations involved. As shown by Goudsmit (o), 
all of the above results agree poorly with experiment 
for various reasons. Improved results were obtained by 
Breit and Wills (r) ,who made a complete relativistic 
calculation of the constants. We shall quote their 
values and apply them in later calculations, Equation

results may be obtained by the use of semi-empirical

However, we shall use the above results for a two 
electron system, for it is difficult to see how to 
determine the necessary constants in G-oudsmit ! s 
formulae (eqns. (5) and (6) ref* (u)). 


(B) Interaction Constants for a Two Electron System . 

When there are more than one optical electron^ in 
the atomic system, calculations of the interaction 
energies become more involved. Neglecting nuclear spin 
interaction, the energy levels of an atom are still 
characterized by a quantum number J representing the 
total angular momentum of all the optical electrons* 

The effect of a nuclear interaction, as in the one 
electron spectrum, is to split the J levels into a 
number of components. We shall show that the splitting 
conforms to the Lande^interval rule or eqn. (2) of 
the previous section. The object of this section is

to evaluate the constant a(j)sf (2) for a tv/o electron 
system in terms of the one electron constants. 

Following the method of Breit and Wills (r),we shall 
carry through the calculations for a pair of electrons 
with the configuration label (ns,^!) or simply (s/l). 

The states of the conf iguration (s .D- are 
characterized by the set of quantum numbers ns,n T l/ 
specifying the conf iguration; a set of quantum numbers 
which specify the type of coupling, i.e. the relative 
magnitudes of the electrostatic and spin-orbit 
interactions - - we shall denote this set at present 
by the single symbol y ; the numbers J and Mj to which 
we add the nuclear spin quantum number I and MjOf p.7 # 
Provided the nuclear interaction is small, the 
unperturbed levels of such a system will always be 
characterized by J. 

If the coupling is extreme (Jj) or (LS) then the 
symbol t will represent the y s of the individual 
electrons, or their resultant L and S, respectively. 
Generally the coupling is not extreme and the states 
of the system may be approximately expanded in terms 
of the (jj) or (IS) coupled states, depending on 
whether the coupling is nearly (jj) or(LS) respectively. 
Tints we may represent a state in intermediate coupling 
either as

and a determination of the constants K^defines the

Since the one electron constants,eqns. (3)(4)(5), 
depend upon the j values of the individual electrons, 
it will be necessary to malce preliminary calculations 
with the (-j) coupled states of ( 10 ).

not very important, for the relativity correction

tube accompanied by a rare gas purification train 
was utilized to produce the spectrum of the thallium. 

Two crystalline quartz and two glass Lummer - Gehrke 
plates were used individually to form interference 
fringes of the spectrum lines, thereby in general 
resolving each into its components. In the case of 
the bi-refringent quartz plates, a Nieol or Wollaston 
prism was placed in the light beam immediately before 
the plates to eliminate one of the two plane-polarized 
components. The horizontal interference fringes so 
produced were focussed upon the slit of a Hilger S, 
spectrograph by means of a quartz-fluorite achromat 
rigidly attached to the spectrograph. The dispersed 
patterns of each spectrum line were then photographed 
together and the resultant photographic impressions 
measured by means of a Gaertner comparator reading to 
sasBxss 0.001 m.m. Subsequent calculations we re 
performed mostly with the aid of an eight-figure 
Millionaire calculator. A more detailed description 
with diagrams of some of the above listed parts with 
a discussion of the associated experimental procedure 
follows. Section (A) deals with the light source 
and purification train, concluding with a digression 
on the candidates unsuccessful attempt to further the 
analysis of the hyperfine structure of the gold spectrum.

In section (B),the theory underlying the measurement 
of small wave-number separations by use of the 
Lunmer-Gehrke plate is discussed• A description of 
the optical arrangement of the apparatus and the 
necessary datd for the Lummer-Gehrke plates concludes 
this section* r fhe last section (C),deals with a 
number of pertinent experimental factors involved in 
the investigation* 

(A) The Discharge Tube and Purification Train 

The discharge tube was made up in the University, 
following in the main, the design of the lamp by 
Schuler and Gollnow (v)* The body of the lamp 
consists of two separate cylindrical electrodes made 
of brass and sealed with Zn-Sn solder. The two 
electrodes fit loosely into either end of a pyrex 
cylinder which serves both the purpose of keeping 
them separated and of forming a vacuum seal. A 
longitudinal cross-section of the assembled lamp is 
shown in fig* 1. 

A is the anode and 0 4m the cathode with 
incorporated water-jackets J* These two parts were 
machined out of a solid brass cylinder, thus avoiding 
the use of soldered joints in the vicinity of the 
two flat ends faces F, F^which are likely to become

heated or acted upon by the discharge. These faces 
were separated a distance of about 1 m.m. by means 
of the glass cylinder G, the ends of which were 
ground square and flat, to insure proper alignment 
of the electrodes• Vacuum seals between the glass 
and electrodes were made at W with the aid of 
Dennis/on T s Sealing Wax. The built-in water-jackets 
J serve both to control the temperature of the 
discharge taking place in the cavity H, and to 
prevent softening of the sealing wax. The inlets are 
at E and outlets at F. It was found unnecessary to 
electrically insulate the two cooling systems, if the 
lamp and water supply taps of the building were 
connected by about twenty feet of rubber tubing. 

I and 0 are the inlet and outlet,respectively,for 
the rare gas* They are sealed to the purification 
train with sealing wax. The indicated direction of 
gas flow reduces diffusion of metallic vapor out of 
the cavity H and prevents it from condensing on the 
quartz window Q,, which seals the anode and through 
which the light passes to the interferometer. 

The cathode cavity H consists of a small solid 
aluminum cylinder. It slides into the central hollow 
cylinder of C with its front face eoplancr with 1£. 

Its other end is coupled with the head of a rod S 
which screws into a tapped plug P. P fits snugly

into C # A conical glass joint M is sealed to the 
cathode body at 1. Into the glass ping If is sealed 
a hollow rod R with a long slot X. S slides into 
R and is fastened with a pin* Thus rotating the 
plug If translates the cavity H without danger of 
straining the ground joint,if H should become wedged. 

The design of Schuler and Gollnow of the cavity 
was found unsatisfactory for the purpose of this 
investigation. This is shown in figure E (a). The 
incoming gas enters the cavity C (fig.2) and leaves 
it through six small radial channels R near the 
curved face F. The radial channels communicate with 
a peripheral groove G which is connected to the rear 
by the channel K along the cylinder. It was found 
that after several hours 1 run a discharge formed in 
the groove G. As brass sputters readily compared to 
aluminum, the body of the lamp disintegrated rapidly 
in the regions marked 1, the intensity of disintegration 
increasing with the size of the cavity so formed. The 
result was the appearance of zinc and copper lines in 
the spectrum and a loss of control over the discharge. 
Further, the life of the lamp would have been very 
limited, for repairs at this point are impossible if 
the brass were burned through. The cavity shown in 
fig. E (b) was found to be more satisfactory. Again 
there are six radial channels but each is individually 



32 


connected to the rear by a longitudinal channel 
drilled through the aluminum cylinder. The cap p 
prevents ions from reaching brass at the ends of 
the radial channels and at the same time serves to 
retain the molten metal inside the cavity* It 
also restricts the diameter of the light source 
without limiting the volume of the cavity* This is 
a necessary feature when the Wollaston prism is in 
use as will be discussed under section (B). 

In operation the discharge tube was sealed to 
the glass purification train shown diagramatically 
in fig# 3* The system was filled with pure helium 
at a pressure of about 10 m.m* of mercury from the 
supply flask F* The tv^o mercury diffusion pumps B, 
in series, circulate the gas in the direction of the 
arrows through the reservoir A, mercury trap G, into 
the liquid-air cooled activated charcoal trap D» This 
removes traces of any impurities in the helium except 
hydrogen* The purified helium then enters the lamp S 
at I, takes part in the discharge,and together with 
any other gases evolved f leaves through 0 to return to 
the pumps* The purpose of the reservoir A is to store 
up the helium after a run has been completed, so that 
it is not necessary to draw fresh gas from the supply F

passing the argon over successive boats in 0, filled 
with calcium metal and cuprous oxide respectively, 
and heated to a temperature of about 700*0 practically 
all chemically active gases were removed from it. 
Remaining impurities were finally removed in D cooled 
with carbon-dioxide snow. 

During an exposure the discharge was operated 
at a pressure of about 10 m.m. Hg with a current of 
about 0*6 amperes. Shis resulted in a potential drop 
of about 300 volts across the lamp. The power was 
obtained from a full-wave rectified set consisting of 
two RCA - 872 mercury vapor valves; two 2000 volt 3K7W 
transformers and a suitable filter. The current was 
controlled by a bank of four 1500 ohm water-cooled 
rheostats* It was found necessary to use this rather 
large current of 0*6 amperes in order to obtain 
photographs of the weak lines investigated in a 
reasonable exposure time. High temperature of the 
light source ensues large current with the resultant 
increased Doppler effect. However, a comparison of 
photographs with several taken witha lower current 
showed nofc appreciable broadening of the lines. With 
apparently constant conditions, the intensity of the 
T1 II lines varied considerably during an exposure, 
decreasing with a decreasing amount of thallium in the 
cavity. The thallium evaporated in the cavity >

condensed on the anode inset B (fig.l. ) in a black 

powdery form, the deposit gradually building up to 

short-circuit the lamp. In order to increase available 

space for condensation, the inset was removed. Under 

these conditions exposures of more than fifty hours 1 

duration could be obtained with about one gram of metal. 

******* 

This is perhaps a suitable point at which to 
make a few observations concerning the candidate’s 
efforts to obtain measurements in the hyperfine 
structure of the gold spectrum. A few lines of the 
Au I spectrum have been resolved and measured by 
previous investigators (y) 9 and an attempt was made 
to further the measurements in the spectra of both 
Au I and Au II. 

Original trials to excite an intense spectrum 
were made with a different type of discharge tube* 

It consisted of a large brass anode cylinder 
externally water-cooled, with a small uncooled 
cathode suspended at its center. Iron, carbon and 
Molybdenum cathodes of various shapes and s±%es were 
tried. At a temperature below the melting point 
of gold, iron sputtered more readily, covering the 
gold with tm a film. Above its melting point ; an 
iron-gold alloy was formed with the loss of both

spectrum and gold, The carbon electrodes were 
better in this respect, but when the gold melted 
it rolled up into a ball, thereby lessening the 
chances of getting a strong spectrum. Further, 
the carbon electrodes continually poured out 
impurities in the discharge thereby producing a 
rich band spectrum which obliterated any existing 
gold lines. Baking the electrode in a vacuum at 
red heat for many hours before introducing it into 
the lamp did not greatly improve the situation, 

A sheet molybdenum cathode of small dimensions 
seemecfco be about the best. But since many molybdenum 
lines as well as bands mate their appearance, it was 
impossible even with this to obtain a spectrum free 
of doubtful lines. 

Under the best conditions of excitation, the 
gold was in a molten state, thus evaporating freely 
and condensing on the window of the lamp through 
which the light passed, This made it necessary to 
open the lamp frequently. After a few hours 5 run, 
a thin film of metal condensed on the anode surface. 
When the lamp was opened and exposed to air, days 
were required to diminish the flow of gases coming 




37 


out of the film. 

This lamp was finally discarded and that designed 
hy Schuler and Gollnow made up. In this lamp, 
molybdenum and carbon cathodes were tried again. 

Carbon gave the same trouble as before.With a 
molybdenum electrode, the gold never covered the 
surface property due to the cathode cooling system, 
with the result that the Mo I spectrum was strongly 
excited, the sputtered Mi) ions condensing on the 
gold. Finally, aluminum cathodes were made. With 
this metal, the temperature must be kept below its 
melting point and one must depend upon sputtering 
only for gold vapor. With pure helium, a fairly 
clean Au I spectrum was obtained but this was in all 
cases very weak. Only enticing momentary glimpses 
of Au II lines were obtained, these appearing under 
conditions in which the lamp was extremely unstable. 

According to the dats of Blechschmidt (aa) and 
others, gold sputters readily as compared to the 
metals used in the construction of the hollow 
cathodes. Of course,his data does not include 
the low range of voltages used in this investigation 
viz. 200-600 volts. On examining Blechschmidt ? s

curves of rate of sputtering vs. applied voltage, 
it appears that some of them cross, indicating that 
the relative rates of sputtering of two metals 
varies with the voltage applied. Apparently, this 
is what has happened in the case of gold and 
the metals used in the cathodes. With a metal of 
low melting point, such as thallium, sputtered 
atoms probably form only a small percentage of 
the vapor formed by- ordinary evaporation. The best 
arrangement for obtaining an intense spectrum of 
Au I and Au II for interferometer work would be 
a separate means of producing the gold vapor. In 
the kind of lamp used, this might be accomplished 
by placing an evaporator in the anode just before 
the cathode cavity, so that the rare gas stream 
would sweep the metaJLie vapor into the cavity. 

This arrangement would make art possible to control 
vapor density and excitation conditions independently 
of. each other. 

The excitation processes occurring in a discharge 
of this kind are complicated and at present not fully 
understood. A paper by Sawyer (bb) is about the most 
complete on this subject to date.

(B) Theory of Lummer - Gehrke Plate 

The Lummer-Gehrke plate consists of a long 
rectangular glass or quartz plate with two 
optically plane and parallel faces, to one end of 
which is cemented a prism. A cross-section 
perpendicular to the plane of the optical faces is 
shown in fig.4, in which PQ, and RS are the optical 
faces, and SXY the prism. 



Let us consider a ray of light of wave-length \ 
incident upon the Base of the prism at B. It is 
totally reflected at C to D where it is partially 
transmitted along DP*and partially reflected along 
LF* At F it is again divided into a reflected ray 
FG and transmitted ray FK. The same process is 
repeated at the points G,H,J,etc. Thus to each ray 
entering the prism at 1, there is a system of parallel 





















41 


rays emerging from the face PQ, and another system 


emerging from the face SR, these two systems being 

/Vn 

symmetrically directed about the axis 0. Consider 
any plane MU which is perpendicular to the direction 


A 


of the rays Pp, GR, etc. If all the rays belonging 
to this system reach the plane in phase, a line of 
maximum illumination perpendicular to the plane of 
the paper will be formed* in the focQ.1 plane of the 
lens L through which they pass. If on the other hand 
alternate rays of the system reach the plane KN 
differing in phase by an odd multiple of nrr , they will 
nearly annul each other, with a resultant line of 
minimum illumination in the foe01 plane of the lens. 

The annulment will not be complete since consecutive 
rays are not of equal amplitudes. Thus, as the angle 
of emergence i of the rays is changed, there will be 
a succession of parallel bright and dark fringes formed 
in the foe01 plane of the lens. A ray of different 
wave-length will form a different set of such fringes. 
If the difference in wave-length is small, it is 
possible to determine its magnitude by a measurement 
of the two sets of fringes. It is the object of this 
section to Indicate how this is performed. Referring 
to fig.4, let 

t - thickness of the plate. 


m, - index of refraction of the plate with respect 
r to air. 


r - angle of incidence of ray CP to normal at P. 
i - angle of emergence of ray Pp* at P. 
if - the grazing angle at P. 



- 42 - 


The optical path difference of the ray GR' and Dp’ 
at the plane MB' through G is 
$ * f (135 4 ^G)- bp' 

This is readily reduced to the form 

$ * 2t*[c*cos|r) .( 1 ) 

If this system of rays is to produce a line of maximum 
illumination, then we must have 

S = - 2t*|*.* cos (r) *. .*(2) 

where n is a positive integer* 

By application of Snell 1 s Law of refraction this 
reduces to 

i = *\ .(gt) 


This equation states that the Bright fringe of order n 
of the wave-length \ is formed by the light emerging 
from the plate at an angle i* 

Since A n is large, we can determine the difference 
in the angles of emergence the orders n and n+1 

for wave-length \ by differentiating and setting 
fcn*l. After rearranging the terms we have

of the fringes of A and A-vSX for the same order n is 
obtained by differentiating with n constant* After

Ithen the fringe of order n for wave-length x+ax 


just coincides with the fringe of order n*l for wave¬

us to determine this wave-length difference, which will

be dealt with more fully later.

is due to McLennan and McLeod (w).

However, it very often happens that the n T th order 
of one component does not lie betvfeen the n T th and ntl’th 
orders of the other. If this is not the case then it is 
necessary to add 4to the expression (10) equal in 
number to the number of fringes overlapped. Thus it is 
easy to see that results derived from one plate are not 
unambiguous. But, if a pattern for the same spectrum 
line is obtained with a plate of different optical 
properties, the amount of overlap as well as the fractional 
part (10) will in general be different. The method of 
obtaining an unambiguous result for the separation of two 
components is then to measure two patterns obtained with 
different plates, and adding to the fractional parts (10) 
of each, the corresponding 4^5 until a ccmncidence in 


value is obtained

As was mentioned above, the for each plate 

are calculated from a knowledge of its optical constants. 

For the particular plates used, the following is a list 
of the details* 

1. One quartz plate of length 13 cm. and thickness 0.4493cm 
with optic axis parallel to the long edge. The 
extraordinary ray was eliminated and a dispersion 
formula due to Coode-Adams (x) was used to calculate 
and in the range X260Q-A3000 A. The calculated 
values of ju. agreed to one unit in the fifth decimal 
place with experimental values. 

2. One quartz plate of length 13 cm. and thickness 0.582#cm 
with the optic axis parallel to the short edge of the 
reflecting face of the plate. The ordinary ray was 
eliminated and a single three term Cauchy formula 

was used in the range A2600 -^3000 A. The calculated 
values of p. agreed to one unit and better in the fifth 
decimal place. 

3. Two glass plates, one of length 13 cm. and thickness 
0.4872 cm.; the other of length 20 cm. and thickness 
0.6198 cm. Cauchy formulae were used in both cases 
in the range \611Q -X6180A but there were only 
sufficient experimental values of p- to determine the 
constants of the formula. 

The optical arrangement of the apparatus was as follows. 


(x) Coode - Adams.- Proc. Roy. Soe. A in ,209, 











48 


The light from the discharge tube passed through a 
small aperture five-inch quartz lens placed immediately 
in front of the lamp. The condensed beam passed 
through a second quartz lens of focal length six 
inches, which formed an image of the light source 
on the prism base of the Lummer plate. The size of 
the image as well as the cross-section of the light 
beam between these two lenses was governed by the 
mutual distances between the lenses and light source. 
With this arrangement of lenses, the maximum of light 
incident on the Lummer plate was used in the formation 
of fringes of low order, from which best measurements 
are obtainable. After passing through the Lummer plate, 
mounted on an adjustable holder, the light was brought 
to a focus on the spectrograph sli$ by means of an 
achromatic lens of focal length 23 cm. 

As was discussed under INTRODUCTION, a ¥/ollaston 
prism was used for the region 2600 - 325 oJl to separate 
the component light vibrations before allowing one to 
pass through the Lummer plate. A small diameter light 
source, sharply defined, was of great advantage in 
separating them*

(C) Some General experimental factors . 

The discharge tube and purification train were 
permanently mounted upon an adjustable table* The 
Lummer plate and its holder were enclosed in a double- 
walled box of rT Ten-®est ft . Both the box and the 
spectrograph rested upon a rigid steel girder mounted 
upon a stone-topped bench* With this mounting, relative 
motion between the spectrograph and interferometer system 
was reduced to a minimum* Nevertheless, the effect of 
mechanical vibrations,due mainly to pedestrian traffic 
in the nearby corridor and lecture room^was quite evident 
on most of the plates obtained from long exposures 
running through the day* 

During an exposure of greater than a few minutes 1 
duration, it is essential to maintain the temperature 
of the Lummer plate as constant as possible, in order 
to prevent changes in its optical constants* By means 
of a mercury-contact thermoregulator, the temperature 
variation was confined to a range of 0*4C* The room 
temperature was also under control but it was not 
necessary to have thef^recision in this case* 

In the ultra-violet region Eastman 33; and in the 
red, Eastman Process Panchromatic and Spectroscopic 
S-IXI plates were used* They were generally developed 
in Agfa fine-grain developer and fixed in an acetic-acid 
fixing and hardening solution*

SEP^IMFNTAL RESULTS and discussion 
T he lines analyzed together with the hyperfine 
splittings of their initial levels are presented 

•at 

below. For each line, the approximate wave-length 

» - >, 
in A units is given at the'top left; with its 

classification, as taken from the tables of Kllis 

and Sawyer (g), immediately to the right* At the 

top rc^fct is given the separation of the final level 

a(*i Lj ) in wave-number units (cm;) and the reference 

from which it was obtained. We recall that 

(i) - Schuler and Keyston - Zeit.f. Physik 70,1,(1931)* 

(3) - Smith and Convey - Can.Journ* of Research^14,^6^) 

The diagram at the left represents the initial 

and final levels of the line investigated; the label* 

to the right* of each level,its f value* The hyperfine 

separations are drawn approximately to scale, but 

the separation^between J levels are not* The vertical 

arrows in each diagram, with the labels A, b, C, etc* 

represent the components of the line which were observed 

and interpreted as belonging to the indicated levels* 

The numbers near these are the theoretically expected 

relative intensities* The wave number separations of 

these components are given in the table to the right* 

In this table, the symbols 0,6, that the 






51 


measurement to the right of them were obtained from 
the quartz Lummer plate of thickness 5,825 mm,,and 
4,872 mm, respectively, Generally, if one of these 
symbols is repeated in a table, two different 
photographs have been measured. If the symbol Q,4 *>y 6 
is followed by (blend), the components have not been 
resolved on that plate and the measurement to the 
right has been disregarded in obtaining the average, 
^he interpretation of the structure of the lines 
in the red region, belonging to the 6s5fT~6s6$ 
has not been completed. Sufficient measurements are 
at hand, but the patterns are so complex, that the 
interpretation was found difficult.

Smith and Convey (j) give a value of 0,695 for 
(7*^) through an interpretation of the line \4286. 
However, on checking this result it was found to 
he 1,809, The difference between these two values 
is probably due to the fact that the separation of 
the final level of 6p* 3 P x of A4286 is unreliable as 
may be seen by examining the table in their paper. 
Also, the value obtained by them is derived from 
only one measurement.

In this line two components A and B were 
observed. The component A was much more intense 
than B so that these two could not both be from the 
level Hence it was inferred that A was a 

superposition of the two components from the level 5 ?; 
and B the strongest expected component from the 
level The line/\2801 was again resolved on 

the line spectrum, so that a rough check of the 
above values for A - B was possible.

Both the components A and B were much stronger 
than C, vd.th A the strongest. Hence A and B were 
taken as having the two hyperfine levels of *F 
as initial levels, and C as the strongest transition 
betY7een the 3 F 3 and 6*1)^ levels. The three components 
of this line were resolved on the line spectrum and 
thus their separations could be checked approximately.

Combining the results of the lines\2780, A2801, 

A2833, completes the analysis of the fine and hyperfine 
structure of the 7 3 F term*. A diagram is shown in 
fig.8. To the of the diagram, all those 

separations obtained from each line are bracketed. 





7 3 F Term 


FIG. 8, 


This rather complicated arrangement of levels 
may not be unambiguous, since each of the separations 
ha£ been obtained from an examination of only one 
line. But there is further evidence as to the 
separation between sp^F^and 3 F 3 levels , although 
of an approximate character. Fllis and Sav/yer (g) 

































56 


separated these through the lines\4292,X4291 , giving 
a value of about 5 cm. , These lines are classified 
as \4292.72 - 7 3 F X 

\4291.72 6p" 5 P z - 7 % 

From A2801, the A s P epara tion of 3 F 3 is 0.56 and from 
(j), the separation of 3 V z is 0.557. Thus we should 
expect the two components of A4291.72 to he 
unresolved on the line spectrum* and we may say that 
^4291.72 arises from the transition 6p£p- 7>*F. 

Since the separation of 3 P l (hy A278o)is large, we 
expect that the weaker line A 4292 must he the 
strongest component of the transition 3 P*-i.e. 
6p(P a - • 

Hence, the wave number separation of A4291, A4292 

3 3 

gives us pP-p?<*5 cm".' 

Also, the line\2705 {6’p^- 7^,) was found on 

the line spectrum, and consisted of two components 

with a separation of about 4.7 cm! The components 

to be expected for this line in order of decreasing 

intensity are , 3

Hence these two components would not he resolved 

and we have the value 4*7 for the separation 7*F, - 7 s!f, . 

Although these checks are only approxisoate, 
they do indicate the correct order of magnitude, a 
necessary check when working with Lummer plates. 

These levels form a good example of what is 
to he expected when the nuclear spin interaction 
energy is of the same order as the spin-orbit 
interaction. Heedless to say, it is useless to 
attempt to reconcile the observed separations with 
any formulae under THEORY, since we there assumed 
that the nuclear interaction was small as compared 
to the spin-orhit interaction. There is one 
interesting feature about the diagram of^F levels 
(fig.8). According to the perturbation theory, 
two neighboring levels with the same f value should 
exert a repulsive effect upon one another. This 
effect is quite evident in the case of the two 
levels with f=1 and the two with f = £.

Calculations of Nuclear g-Factor . 

Of those investigated, the only configuration for 
which the terms and levels are known to be in the right 
order is the 6s9d. Although the known levels of 6s8p 
are too, the^ level has not been located, and the f P, 

O M 

level is badly perturbed by the level 8,(see Ellis and 
Sawyer (g)). Hence we shall calculate g values from 
the dat& of the 6s9d configuration only, not taking 
into consideration perturbation effects* 

Using the ^level as a reference, the energy 
difference in cm* 1 between the levels of the 6s9d 
config-uration are obtained from (g) and given below. 

W( \ )« 0 

W( 3 3>- )»-294 , ,

G 0 =-164.4 

We note that should be equal to the Lande interval 
factor for the 3 U term, if the coupling were strictly (LS). 
The values of derived directly from (35) are 19.7 and 14 

with an average 16.9. This forms a rough check on the 
calculations.

With the above value f or , we can evaluate 

in the approximation of equation (9). We have 
( ~yO~ zxdt/Z* where the factor 6^ is the 

relativity correction H. 

If we compare the magnitudes of a(j) and a(s), using 
the expressions on p.20; the above value for(-l^ and 
Racah T s (s) value of 2340 for Srr 
we see that 

a :a(s)^l:50,000 
a(i-£):a(s)'v 1:50,000 

Thus it is clear that the d electron contributes little 
to the splitting of the 3 D levels, and for calculations 
of g to three figures, may be left out of consideration* 
For the 9 3 Dj level, we apply the formula (32) with 
neglect of the d electron and get 

540 

where ^ F = 2340. 

Similarly for the 9 J D ( level we get 
g(l)= 2.53 

For the # D 1 J D L levels, we must evaluate the 
constants 0 , 0 * of formula (34)* 

Substituting the results (36) into that part of 
the secular equation (28) for 1=2.®2, we get two roots 


s 


of £ viz

Then by (31 T ) and the first root of £ i.e. 5.2, we

Normalizing the K f s we get

Then by (26) we get the e T s

Substituting these into (34), and using Racah T s value

g(l) = 2.30 for the('L x ) level.

Comparing these values with those of Table 71 of 
Smith and Convey ( j), we see that the values of g(V 
derived from the n*D, and n D^levels increase with n.

Since for all of these levels, the contribution of 
the & electron is small compared to s electron, it 
appears that the calculated values of a(s)/g(l) are 
in error* A correct determination ought to take into 
consideration the screening effect of the d electron. 

It is rather difficult to account for the low 
value of g(l) obtained from the^D^level, for it is not 
near to any term likely to perturb £1*. On the other 
hand, the value of g(l) derived from thelevel is 
in good agreement with the values of Smith and Convey (j), 
even though thelevel is distincly perturbed by the 
6p*'D a level (see Ellis and Sawyer(g))* Of course, the 
hyperfine splitting of this level is small, and hence 
it should not greatly affect the splitting of the 9d D z 


level

I am happy to have this opportunity to express 
my appreciation of the guidance, assistance and kindly 
interest extended by Prof. Stanley Smith during the 
prosecution of this research. I am also indebted to 
the other members of the Physics Department and to 
Dr. Boomer of the Chemistry Department for suggestions 
and advice. 

May I also extend my thanks to Mr. Gleave and 
to Mr. MacFarlane for making up and repairing 
apparatus as it was required. The liquid air used 
in the experimental vtfork was always promptly supplied 
by Dr. Boomer and Mr. Thomson of the Chemistry 
Department. 

I am very grateful to the University for the 
award of a University of Alberta Research Scholarship. 
Without this financial assistance it would have been 
impossible to devote my full time to the problem at
