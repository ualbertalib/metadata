SYNOPSIS 


The main purpose of this survey was to. secure data 
that would provide a picture of current conditions and 
practices in the field of Alberta school health services* 

The survey investigated seven aspects of school health 
services: heedth personnel, health equipment, sanitation, 
nutrition programs, mental health, immunization and 
health inspection programs. 

To obtain the desired information questionnaires were 
mailed to the superintendents of all the school divisions, 
and to the secretary-treasurers of all the city, town, vill¬ 
age, and consolidated public school districts in the 
province. Of a total of 127 questionnaires mailed, 99 were 
returned for an average return of 78 percent. 

The general picture as revealed by the questionnaire 
survey was one of great variation in the nature and extent 
of services provided within different types of administra¬ 
tive units and also within administrative units of the 
same kind. The survey showed that much has been done 
toward providing adequate school health services, espec¬ 
ially in city and town school districts. However, that 
much pioneer work in school health services remains to be 
done in Alberta is indicated by the fact that almost one 
quarter of all rooms reported no personnel or facilities 
for carrying out a preventive health program that included 
health inspections and immunization programs.

CHAPTER I 


THE PURPOSE OP THE SURVEY AND REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE 

Considerable material has been written on the process 
that Alberta has made in the field of public health services 
since her first Public Health Act of 1907. As is to be 
expected, information is readily available on the nature 
and extent of the many services directly administered by 
the Department of Health and on the services provided by 
such private agencies as the Alberta Tuberculosis 
Association, and the Alberta Red Cross Society. However, 
there is one phase of health services in Alberta on which 
information is scanty and that is the nature and extent of 
the province*s school health services. The fact that 
school health services in Alberta are not directly 
administered by a strong central authority but are dependent 
to a considerable extent on local initiative may account, 
at least in part, for this dearth of information. The 
gathering of information, which must necessarily precede 
any attempt at appraisal, is the object of this study. 

THE PROBLEM 

The purpose of this study is to investigate the 
status of school health services in the province of Alberta. 
Specifically, this survey will attempt to ascertain: 

(1) the legitimate purposes of school health services, 

(2) the number and nature of existing agencies contributing 




















\ 


- 





















































-2- 


to school health services in Alberta, 

(3) the present status of health services provided to 
pupils—the nature and extent of such services in schools 
in divisions and in independent school districts, and the 
methods of financing these services. 

DEFINITION OF TERMS 

A definition of school health services that has been 

accepted by several writers in the field of health is the 

one prepared by the Committee on Terminology of the Health 

Education Section of the American Physical Education 

Association.^ By health services, according to this source, 

is meant: "All those procedures designed to determine the 

health status of the child, to enlist his cooperation in- 

health protection and maintenance, to inform parents of the 

defects that may be present, to prevent disease, and to 

2 

correct remediable defects.* 1 

The above definition is suitable for purposes of this 
survey as it does not include actual health teaching in the 
classroom. Health instruction, according to Williams and 
Shaw, is a distinct division of the broad field of school 
health and is defined as “that organization of learning 
experiences directed toward the development of favorable

health knowledge, attitudes, and practices, 11 

Briefly, then, school health services as defined in 
this survey are those practices, exclusive of actual health 
teaching, which are conducive to the acquisition and main¬ 
tenance of the good health of the school child, 

REVIEW OP THE LITERATURE 

A review of relevant literature was made to determine 
the need for further information on Alberta school health 
services, and to ascertain the legitimate place of a health 
services program in the school. 

Related Studies , Sources of information dealing 
specifically with school health services in Alberta are 
few but the search for background material pertinent to 
this investigation revealed several surveys of particular 
interest. The Alberta Health Survey, begun in 1948 and 
completed in 1950, was found valuable for its account of 
the many agencies contributing to public health service 

4 

in Alberta, This survey was prepared by the Alberta 
Health Survey Committee for the provincial government, 

A grant of $42,592 was made to Alberta by the federal 
government to assist in carrying out the survey which was

wide in scope* Its purpose was to investigate Alberta*s 
public health facilities in eleven different fields so as 
to determine the exact extent of our health needs and to 
provide a foundation for future planning* 

Another recent Alberta health survey (August 1947 to 
June 1948) of a more limited nature was one carried out by 
the Federal Department of Health and National Welfare with 
the cooperation of the Alberta Department of Health. This 
was a nutrition survey of the area within the Foothills 
Health District. "The purpose of this survey was to discover 
whether any malnutrition existed among the people of the 
district, to advise on methods of correcting any serious 
conditions found, and to indicate what health services would 

7 

be required to avoid malnutrition in the future. ,l 

Also a survey made by the Canadian Public Health 
Association was found of value because it revealed the most 
recent thinking of Canadian authorities on the administration 

o 

of school health services. One object of this survey was to 
investigate the nature of school health practice in each 
province. The general conclusion of the study was "that many

health agencies were so busy giving a school service that 
they had no time to study the service to see if it was 
worthwhile or even necessary, * 11 ^ To prevent waste of time and 
effort it was recommended that the children be given a 
thorough medical examination when they entered school, 

"From then on they should be examined medic ally only when 
referred by the teacher to the nurse and from the nurse to 
the physician," 10 

The previous studies all indicate a dearth of information 
specifically on Alberta school health services. More closely 
related to the present survey, however, is one made by the 
National Committee for School Health Research, This study, 

"A Health Survey of Canadian Schools", was undertaken in 
1945, The purpose of the survey was a general assessment of the 
status of school health facilities and practices in Canada, 

Data were gathered covering 90 percent of the elementary 
schools and 75 percent of the secondary schools of Canada, In 
Alberta 94,5% of elementary schools, and 86,2% of secondary 
schools participated in this survey, 11 This report is a 
valuable one in the field of school health services, but 
covers only three areas in the field—school environment,

mental health facilities, and nutrition. Ho information 
is supplied on school immunization programs, school 
inspection programs, nor on special school health personnel. 

In the National Committee^ Report, too, since most of the 
percentage data are based on schools rather than on 
individual classrooms, a detailed picture is not presented. 

A review of the relevant literature reveals, then, 
inadequacy in our present information on school health 
services in Alberta. It is hoped that this survey will 
fill the gap in our knowledge. 

The Functions of Health Services for Scliools . That good 
health is important for the individual citizen and nation need 
not be argued; however, the extent of the responsibility of 
the school in the achievement of maximum good health for all 
is still a point for debate. 

In recent years, several factors have placed the problem 

of health services on the doorstep of the school. One factor 

which has made health increasingly important in education is 

our new philosophy which calls for the education of the whole 

child for life. u As we study the recent developments of 

education, we find that modern education has devoted more 

and more attention to the individual child. The educator 

has come to consider in increasing degree the welfare of the 

whole child—his physical and mental health as well as his 

12 

intellectual progress. 11

Another factor that has increased the deioand for school 

health services has been the social changes affecting the 

home* "Today, the home devotes considerably less emphasis on 

many functions that were well-established family obligations 

13 

in former decades*" Too, the continuous progress of society 

toward the democratic ideal has had its influence in the 

movement toward greater school health services* "The 

increasing recognition of equal opportunity as a democratic 

ideal has promoted cooperative action to safeguard the physical 

14 

and emotional well-being of children." 

Still another very potent factor has been the great mass 
of accumulated evidence in Canada and United States to show 
that the youth of America has a very poor health record. The 
results of a survey made by the National Education Association 
in 1938 indicates that "at least 22 percent of the pupils in 
high schools suffer from malnutrition, tuberculosis, eye and 
teeth defects, or some other imperfection which could be 
remedied or actually corrected if care were available. Of the 
school children examined in six selected cities, 65 to 
95 percent had defects of some seriousness; 33 percent had 
diseased tonsils; 34 percent defective vision; and 50 percent 
defective teeth." A survey made by the National Committee

for School Health Hesearch in 1947 (on the causes of 

absenteeism in Canadian schools) shows that 50*9 percent of 

all days lost in rural schools and 74.9 percent of all days 

16 

lost in urban schools were due to medical causes. For 

Alberta the average percentage loss of days for health 

reasons was 45.7 percent for rural pupils and 78.3 percent 
17 

for urban pupils. The Annual Report for 1950 of the 
Rocky Mountain House Health District indicates that of 1278 

pupils examined 579, or 45 percent, had remediable health 

13 

defects of various kinds. These are but a few samples of 
the many reports and surveys that indicate the low status of 
pupil health and that, along with the other factors mentioned, 
are pointing out the need for increased school services. 

"Since in our democracy, the school is the one institution 

which touches practically all of our youth, the educational 

19 

system should include significant health procedures." 

Evidence of this increased interest in the health of 
the school child is provided by a survey made in 1943 by 
the Canada and Newfoundland Education Association (now the 
Canadian Education Association) to determine the most urgent 
needs in education in Canada. Of 15 urgent needs in education, 
as revealed by the survey, health examination and

follow-up treatment for all children was listed as first in 

importance* ”The first aim of the schools is to develop 

young Canadians sound in mind and body. Healthy children 

are public assets; sickly ones are liabilities.” 20 

Assuming, then, that the need for a school health services 

program is real and urgent, what should be the functions of 

such a program? Turner states that the first function of 

school health services is that of health protection. ,f If 

laws are passed demanding that every child attend school, 

then it is incumbent upon the state to see that the child 1 s 

health is not injured by that procedure which the state 
21 

requires.” This preventive function of health services in¬ 
cludes the providing of a healthful school environment, 
physical, dental, and psychological examinations, and 
immunization services. The second function of health services 
is the correction of defects. "Having recognized the needs 
of children through physical examinations, it becomes obvious 

that we should do something to correct the defects that were 
22 

observed.” Regarding this second function, authorities 
appear to agree that remedial service is a legitimate one but 
there are divergent opinions on the extent of such services.

Turner limits his remedial function to providing special 

classes (sight-saving classes, special classes for the hard- 

of-hearing, the mentally retarded and the crippled), to 

informing the parents of the defect, and to encouraging and 

assisting in the securing of treatment through an adequate 

follow-up service. 11 As an educational agency, the school 

does not have the responsibility for providing medical care. 

It does have the responsibility to tell parents what was found 

to be wrong, to encourage the prompt use of medical or 

clinical service for the treatment of defects of tonsils, 

teeth, nose, throat, eye, ears, lungs and heart, and to provide 

soecial classes or a modified educational program for children 

23 

whose status demands it. 11 The 1950 report of the Canadian 

24 

Public Health Association supports this view. The twofold 
objectives of school health services as recommended by this 
Association is firstly preventive health service and secondly 
the continuous supervision of pupils* health for the purpose 
of supplying information to the family and the family physician. 
This association believes that the responsibility for 
treatment remains with the parents and their own physician. 

On the other hand, the 1944 report of the Canada and 
Newfoundland Education Association suggests that it is not

satisfactory to make treatment of defects a strictly parental 

responsibility. n Medical and dental inspection and treatment 

are becoming more and more a state responsibility insofar at 

least as they apply to the young people of the nation, who 

25 

are most easily reached through the schools," 

In summary, a review of the literature has shorn that 

authorities agree that the general function of school health 

services is to assist in providing the pupil with the good 

health necessary to achieve the educational objectives. 

"Whatever the objectives accepted (for education) we must 

recognize that health maintenance aids the individual in his 

26 

progress toward them." Specific functions of a health 
services program are twofold: the preventive function of 
supplying healthful school living and detecting defects, and 
secondly the corrective function of assisting in securing 
treatment of defects through cooperation with parents and 
various health agencies. Further, the review of the literature 
had revealed that three main factors make an inventory of 
school health services in Alberta timely: lack of information 
on the topic, our present-day philosophy of education stressing 
the education of the whole child including physical as well as 
mental development, and the poor health records of modem youth.

CHAPTER II 


THE PROCEDURE OF THE STUDY 

As revealed in Chapter I, an intensive reviev/ of the 

available literature dealing with the subject of school 

health services was first made as a basis for the attack 

on the problem* Library research uncovered considerable 

material of a general nature* But for specific details on 

school health services in Alberta it was found necessary to 

make extensive use of numerous annual reports and current 

publications of health agencies* The Canadian Almanac and 

Directory was found valuable for indicating possible sources 
1 

of material* The bibliography included in Elementary and 

2 

Secondary Education in Canada, 1944-6 was also useful. 
Additional information was obtained through correspondence 
with officials of Health Departments and private health 
agencies in Canada. Much material was obtained, too, by 
visits to the various divisions of the Alberta Department of 
Health and by personal interviews with health unit personnel 
and officials of private health agencies in Alberta*

services in Alberta for the school year 1950-51, the

questionnaire method was used* Questionnaires were sent to 

3 

the superintendents of the 57 school divisions* To round out 
the picture, questionnaires were sent, also, to the 7 
city public school districts, the 24 independent town school 
districts, the 20 independent village school districts, and to 
the 19 consolidated school districts of the province of Alberta. 
From a total of 127 questionnaires mailed, 99 replies were 
received for an average return of 78 percent. The percent of 
replies received from each type of school district is 
indicated in Table I below*

school districts) , it is believed that the data obtained 
are accurate. To avoid misinterpretation, questionnaire 
items were made as specific as possible, and to encourage 
a maximum of accuracy and participation school officials 
were assured that data for any particular division or 
district would be kept confidential* 







CHAPTER III 


SCHOOL HEALTH AGENCIES AND SPECIAL PERSONNEL 

This chapter will present the findings of the 
questionnaire survey on the number and distribution of 
health agencies and special health personnel serving the 
schools in the province. Preliminary, however, to the 
presentation of data, the nature of these agencies 
contributing to school health services vail be discussed. 

Grouped according to the method by which they are 
financed, there are four broad classes of health agencies 
from which a school in Alberta could receive health services. 
In one class are those agencies financed cooperatively by 
the provincial government and local governments. In a 
second class are those agencies or special personnel 
financed wholly by local authorities (school districts, school 
divisions, rural municipalities, and urban governments). 

Making up a third group are those agencies financed wholly 
by the provincial government, and in a fourth class are 
certain private agencies that voluntarily contribute to 
school health services. 

COOPERATIVELY FINANCED SCHOOL HEALTH AGENCIES 

Included in the first group, those agencies financed 
jointly by the provincial and local governments, are the 
full-time rural health units, the one-nurse health units, 
and the public health nurses.

Full-Time Health Units # In 1929, by an amendment to the 
Public Health Act, provision was made for forming health 
units in Alberta. This step was an attempt to bring to the 
rural population of Alberta public health advantages 
previously enjoyed only by larger cities. Based on the 
theory that prevention is much cheaper than cure, a unit*s 
“work is organized to provide a general preventive health 
service for the residents of the area served.“ ^ 

The first two full-time health units to be formed in 
1931 were the Hed Deer and the Okotoks-High Hiver (now the 
Foothills) Health Units. In addition to these two original 
units, there are six other full-time health units operating 
in the province at present. These units are Lamont, Stettler, 
Rosebud (Didsbury), Two Hills, Drumheller, and the Edmonton 
Rural Health Unit (formerly the Sturgeon and Clover Bar 
Health Units). * 2 

The following table shows the size and staffs of the 
eight full-time health units as revealed by their annual

reports for 1950.

According to the Public Health Act the Minister of 
Health may form a unit upon request of a local governing 
body (councils of cities, towns, villages or municipalities), 
or a combination of local governing bodies* Such body or 
bodies must represent more than 60% of the population of the 

A 

area* ~ The Department of Health defines the area to be 
served by the unit and the per capita contribution of each 
governing body* The area is then formed into “wards", each 
of which is represented on a health board by a member 
appointed by the councils of the contributing bodies* 

This health unit board then engages the unit staff which 
must include a doctor, at least two nurses, a sanitary 
inspector and a secretary-technician* Although the provincial

government contributes grants up to 60% of the annual 
operating costs of the unit, under this administrative 

5 

scheme the community is able to run its own health program* 

The school health services provided by the unit are 
preventive only and consist of periodic physical examinations 
of pupils, an immunization program, sanitation of schools and 
grounds (advice only), and public health education in and 
through the schools (talks, free literature, and films) * 

Some units also provide a preventive dental service* 

Health unit personnel usually travel to the schools in the 
area to carry out their periodic inspections and immunization 
of pupils* Consultations with teachers and parents, and 
follow-up visits to the school are an important part of 
this preventive service* 

One-Nurse Health Units . Nine other areas in the province 

are served by one-nurse health units which have offices located 

at Colinton (Athabaska Health Unit), Brooks, Holden, Granum 

(Macleod Health Unit), Barrhead (Pembina Health Unit), 

Rocky Mountain House, Spirit River, Wainwright, and 

Strathmore (Wheatland Health Unit)* Table III indicates

Each unit is staffed by one public health nurse who works 
alone to bring a basic preventive health programme to the 
whole population in her area. This programme includes 
maternal and child welfare, communicable disease control, 
first aid service, health education, and a school health 
program consisting of inspection of pupils and immunization. 

Like the larger rural health units, the one-nurse health unit 

g 

is equipped with drugs and medical and surgical supplies. 

One-nurse health units are really understaffed rural health 
units. These units are temporary compromises between no 
health unit service and that provided by full-staffed units.

The one-nurse units "will eventually be fully staffed when 

9 

necessary personnel becomes available* 11 In these units, as 
in the full-time health units, the health services are 
financed by local authorities cooperating with the provincial 
authorities. Fifty percent of the operating costs of 

10 

one-nurse units is borne by the provincial government. 

Together Tables II and III show that these nine one-nurse 
health units with the eight full-staffed rural health units 
serve an area of 34,093 square miles and 244,600 people or about 
25% of the population of the province. 

Public Health Nursing . Public health nursing began in 
Alberta in 1918 when four public health nurses were appointed 
as the first field staff. At that time Public Health was a 
branch of the Department of the Provincial Secretary. In 1919 
when the Department of Health was formed, the Public Health 

11 

Nursing Division was organized as a branch of that department. 

Public health nursing in Alberta takes three forms: 

public health nursing with district health units (full-time 

rural health units, and one-nurse health units considered 

above), public health nursing with child welfare units, and 
12 

district nursing.

The three one-nurse child welfare clinics in the province 

are situated in Calgary, Medicine Hat, and Vegreville. This 

type of nursing differs from health unit nursing and district 

nursing in that it is designed to cover urban and near-urban 

areas only and to deal with child health alone, rather than 

with the whole picture of community health. The school 

services of the child welfare clinics consist of inspection 

of school children, immunization, and health education. 

District nursing is specially designed "to supply medical 

aid to remote communities which vary anywhere from thirty to 

13 

eighty miles from the nearest doctor or hospital." Operating 

from her small cottage, provided and furnished by the community, 

the district nurse offers a diversified program. At the 

office in her cottage the nurse receives emergency cases, 

patients who cannot reach a doctor or are not sufficiently ill 

to require the care of a doctor. The nurse also answers calls 

of the sick in homes. Families needing her services are 

responsible for the nursed transportation. A nominal fee 

is charged for treatment. Tne nursed salary and her drugs 

and surgical equipment are provided by the provincial 
14 

government. 

As time permits, the district nurse carries a preventive 
health service into the schools that includes health inspection 
of students, immunization programs, and health education.

In 1950 the Nursing Division had under its supervision 28 

operating district nursing centres, serving a rural population 

15 

of approximately 30,000. Three other units are operating in 

the province under the Nursing Services Act of 1950: the Local 

Improvement District of Milk River, and the Municipalities of 

Warner and Bow Island, In the case of the two municipalities, 

the Department of Public Health pays 60 percent of the whole 

16 

cost and the municipality 40 percent, 

SURVEY FINDINGS ON STATUS OF SCHOOL HEALTH PERSONNEL 

Tables IV and V that follow show the findings of the 
questionnaire survey on the percent of school rooms in divisions, 
and city, tov/n, village, and consolidated school districts served 
by the various types of health agencies and personnel described 
in group one above. Included, too, in these tables are the 
data found for the second main group of health agencies. This 
group contains the special health personnel hired by local 
authorities to serve the schools, such as part and full-time 
school doctors, nurses, dentists, optometrists, and guidance 
specialists. 

The data shown in Tables IV and V, and succeeding tables 
are those reported by 47 school divisions containing 3248 
classrooms, 7 cities with a total of 1365 classrooms, 18 towns 
with 268 classrooms, 16 villages with 120 classrooms, and 11

Table IV shows that the health agency serving the largest 
percentage of classrooms in school divisions, village school 
districts and consolidated school districts is the full-time 


health unit. In the city public school districts the health 
personnel most often reported is the full-time school nurse, 
serving 87.2% of all classrooms. The part-time school doctor 
serves the largest percentage of rooms in the town 
school districts. The part-time school doctor is a community

doctor hired regularly by the school district or some other 
local authority to perform certain health functions in the 
school* The figures for part-time school doctors do not 
include doctors hired occasionally by schools during periods 
of emergency* The table shows that only city classrooms (71*7 
percent) report the services of school dentists. The figures 
for guidance specialists indicate only guidance personnel 
hired by school divisions or school districts on a full-time 
basis, and do not include teachers and principals doing 
part-time guidance work. 

Both the city and town school districts reported all rooms 
being served by one or more of the health agencies or personnel 
listed in Table IV. The school divisions reported 663 rooms or 
20.4% not being served by any of these agencies. Thirty-one 
village classrooms (25,8%) and 17 consolidated classrooms 
(26.5%) were without the services of any of the special 
health personnel or agencies under consideration.

Table V is a breakdown of those health agencies and health 
personnel in Table IV that consist of doctors or nurses or both* 
to show the actual percentage of rooms served by such personnel♦ 
Under the column headed ,r Doctors” in Table V are the data 
showing the percentage of classrooms served by doctors without 
the assistance of nurses (part-time school doctors working 
alone). The data under the column headed ‘Curses 11 include 
one-nurse health units, district nurses, and part and full¬ 
time school nurses working without the assistance of medical 
doctors. The data under "Doctors and Nurses” show the 
percentage of rooms served by full-time health units together 
with those served by both school doctors and nurses. 

The table shows that almost three quarters of the 
classrooms in the school divisions, the village school districts 
and the consolidated school districts have the services in 
some form of doctors, nurses, or both. In the divisions 
861 rooms (26©5%) indicated no services by such personnel; 31 
village classrooms (25.9%) and 17 consolidated classrooms 
(26©6%) reported no health services from doctors or nurses./ 
Twenty-one city classrooms or only 1.6% and 19 town classrooms 
cr 7.1% reported no health services by doctors or nurses. 

The data shown in Tables IV and V merely indicate existing 
conditions in the schools with regard to the employment of 
special health personnel. They are not intended to infer that 
classrooms served by one or more of these agencies necessarily 
have satisfactory school health services programs. The actual 
health services offered by special personnel, as will be seen in

succeeding chapters, varies considerably from district to 

district and from school to school* 

PROVINGIALLY FINANCED HEALTH AGENCIES 

In the third class or group of health agencies, those 

financed wholly by the provincial government, there are a 

number of agencies that serve the school population as a part 

of the general public* One of these is the Tuberculosis 

Division that provides free chest X-rays to residents of 

Alberta, through its stationary and travelling clinics, and 

free treatment to those suffering from tuberculosis* Other 

provincial agencies provide free treatment to victims of 

poliomyelitis, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis* However, these 

are really public health agencies rather than school health 

agencies* Only one of the provincial health agencies, mental 

guidance clinics, will be considered in detail, since its 

primary concern is with the school population* 

Guidance Clinics * Since 1929 when the first guidance 

clinics were held in Calgary, Edmonton and Lethbridge, the 

Alberta Department of Public Health has become increasingly 

concerned about the great need for preventive work in the 

field of mental illnesses and mental maladjustments. "Recent 

surveys in Canada show that one-half of all Hospital beds in 

Canada are occupied by the Mentally Ill, and that approximately 

17 

60,000 Canadians are being cared for in Mental Hospitals."

Of concern to the schools is the fact that many of those with 

mental illnesses or emotional maladjustments are found in the 

school-age group* "Statistics indicate that about 20% of all 

those admitted to the Mental Hospitals each year are under the 

age of 25*-—Authorities agree that the bulk of serious 

18 

Mental Illness had its roots in childhood*" 

Spurred by these recent findings on the extent of mental 
illnesses, the Department of Public Health in 1947 decided to 
take further steps to meet this serious situation* In that 
year the first full-time guidance clinic was organized with 
headquarters in Calgary. In 1948 a second full-time clinic 
was set up in Alberta with regional headquarters in Edmonton* 
These permanent clinics have a staff consisting of a 
psychiatrist, a psychologist, two or more psychiatric social 
workers and a steno-receptionist* The Calgary clinic serves 
Southern Alberta, and the Edmonton clinic Northern Alberta* 
Periodic clinics are held, too, in the central part of the 
province by guidance teams from staffs of the Provincial 
Mental Hospital, Ponoka, the Provincial Mental Institute, 
Edmonton, and the Provincial Training School, Red Deer. By 
June 1950, regular clinics were being held in 37 centres, other 
than Edmonton and Calgary, and a new service had been 
inaugurated whereby six centres in the Peace River country 

ns-

19 

were to be visited semi-annually. However, as pointed out 

by the Alberta Health Survey, complete provincial coverage has 

not yet been attained. "This would call for the enlargement 

of the clinic set-up in Red Deer and the organization of clinic 

teams at Lethbridge to serve the extreme south of the province 

and eventually at some point in the Peace River area to serve 

20 

the settled parts of the north of the province." 

"The primary function of the (Guidance) Clinics is to 

21 

promote good Mental Health." They seek to detect and treat 

mental illness in its early stages when there is still a good 

possibility for cure. Thus guidance clinics are primarily 

concerned with the pre-3chool and school-age groups of the 

population. In 1949, 70% of new cases referred to the clinics 

22 

came from the schools. School cases (pupils failing to make 
adequate personal, social or educational adjustments) are 
referred by the teachers or health unit personnel to the 
superintendent who makes the appointment with the clinic. At 
the clinic referred cases are given a series of physical and 
psychological examinations in order to assess the child*s 
problem. Pertinent data are obtained, too, by interviews with

Table VI, which shows the number and percent of divisions 
and school districts reporting the services of guidance clinics 
in the school year 1950-51, includes both the permanent clinics 
and the travelling guidance teams. Nineteen percent of the 
divisions, 38.9 percent of the towns, 62.5 percent of the 
villages, and 63.6 percent of the consolidated school districts 
reported "never” or "no record" with reference to being 
served by guidance clinics. 

PRIVATE HEALTH AGENCIES 

A fourth and last group of agencies contains all the 
voluntary agencies that contribute in various ways to school 
health services. A number of welfare agencies, the Alberta 
Red Cross Society, the Alberta Tuberculosis Association, the 
Canadian Cancer Society, and the Canadian National Institute 
for the Blind assist and stimulate good health teaching through 
the provision of much free health literature, the formation of 
health clubs, such as the Junior Red Cross, and by sponsoring 
health poster and essay contests. 

In the 99 questionnaires returned from all divisions and 
districts, the Home and School Association was the voluntary 
agency mentioned most often (19 times) as assisting the school 
health services program in some way. Students' unions were 
mentioned six times, Imperial Order of the Daughters of the 
Empire twice, the Junior Red Cross twice, and the Lions and 
Elks Clubs were each mentioned once.

primarily a local responsibility* Ho division of the Health 
Department is designed solely to provide for and supervise 
specific school health services. The provincial government 
does assist local communities in the setting up of certain 
health agencies (full-time rural health units, one-nurse 
health units, and public health nurses) which provide the 
schools with a preventive health service. Since school 
health services are a local responsibility, the survey indicates 
considerable variation in the provision of special school health 
personnel* The cities lead the way in providing special 
personnel, reporting 92.6% coverage of rooms by both doctors 
and nurses, 71.7% coverage by school dentists, and 85*2% 
coverage by full-time guidance specialists. On the other 
hand, less favorably equipped are the school divisions, the 
village, and consolidated school districts which report 
that over 25% of the rooms have the services of neither 
doctors or nurses, and that none of the classrooms are 
served by school dentists*

The above table and Table VIII, which follows, have 
been prepared to show the conditions prevailing in Alberta 
as a whole as well as in the five administrative units 
surveyed* The data under the last column headed "Alberta* 1 
are not the averages of the percentages in the preceding 
five columns, but rather are separate calculations based on 
a summation of data on all rooms covered by the questionnaire* 

As shown in Table VII, the articles which the greatest 
percentage of school rooms in all divisions and districts 
have available are first aid materials, classroom thermometers, 
soap, and paper towels* However, only the city classrooms 
make these items available to all rooms* It will be noted 
that almost one-tenth (9*5%) of all classrooms under survey 
are not supplied with soap. Less complete than for the 
other items are the facilities for measuring pupil height 
and weight, and for testing sight and hearing. The 
percentage figures for scales, height standards, eye charts, 
audiometers, and health record cards include only those 
rooms permanently equipped by school boards* They do not 
account for rooms served solely by such items carried by 
visiting school and district nurses, and health unit 
personnel* 

Table VIII on the succeeding page shows certain 
existing conditions in schools with regard to handwashing, 
toilet, and drinking water facilities* The facilities 
for drinking water are listed in order of desirability.

Attention is drawn to the fact that, at the time of this

drinking water supplies in open containers. The consolidated 
school districts and the large school divisions with their 
great number of rural rooms were the worst offenders in this 
respect. 

In addition to the ideal water flush type toilet, two 
other sanitary indoor type toilets are listed in Table VIII. 
The chemical toilet considered in the survey is one in which 
a chemical is used in the receiving tank. In the case of 
septic toilets chemicals ere not used; the overflow from the 
tank goes to a tile drain. Table VIII shows that in the 
provision of toilet and handwashing facilities the divisions 
again have the poorest record. Nearly two-thirds (66,2%) of 
all classrooms in divisions are served by outdoor toilets. 

On the other hand, the city, town, and consolidated school 
districts show much more favorable records with percentages 
well below the provincial average of 43.9% for this item. 

SUMMARY 

The data collected by the questionnaire to reveal the 
status of basic health equipment and sanitation facilities in 
Alberta classrooms indicate that the highest percentage of 
classroom coverage is for the following items: first aid 
kits, classroom thermometers, soap, and paper towels; the 
average classroom coverage for the province ranges from 87.6% 
to 94.1% for these items. Less than 50% of all classrooms 
reported access to special equipment needed by teachers to 
measure height and weight and to test sight and hearing. 

Less than half (47.3%) of all classrooms are served by

running water supplies; for this item the percentage of 
classroom coverage ranges from 23.7% for divisions to 98.8% 
for city school districts. Open containers for drinking 
water occur in 14.8% of all classrooms, and occurrence 
ranges from none in city and town school districts to 22,5% 
in divisions. Outdoor toilets serve 43.9% of all classrooms. 
The highest percentage for this item (65.2) prevails in 
divisions while the lowest (1.2%) occurs in city school 
districts. 



CHAPTER V 


SCHOOL NUTRITION 


“The nutrition of the school child is a subject of ranch 

1 

controversy at the present time, n The controversy rages 

over the school lunch program, specifically over the value of 

the hot lunch and supplementary feeding. “There are those who 

go so far as to propose that a complete meal be provided at noon 

2 

for every school child. “ In 1947, an evaluation sheet based on 

a publication of the Federal Nutrition Division was sent to 

schools conducting hot lunch programs in New Brunswick. “In 

reading the replies it was noted that many of the teachers in 

reporting first-hand impressions stated their opinion that a 

well-planned school lunch program pays dividends in improved 

learning ability, lessened fatigue, and absenteeism-and an 

increased interest in foods that promote increased weight and 
3 

height.“ On the other hand, some authorities in the field of 
nutrition question the value of both the hot lunch supplement 
and the complete school meal. In 1946, the Canadian Red Cross 
Society sponsored a two-year school lunch program study in which 
600 school pupils were paired in control and experimental groups.

For two years the experimental group received a complete hot 

meal at noon* “The preliminary analysis of the data tabulated 

shows no superiority in the height and weight gains or physical 

fitness of the school lunch group over the non-school lunch 
4 

group. 11 Referring to the same study, Elizabeth Chant 

Robertson, a Canadian nutrition authority, makes the following 

comment about the value of hot supplements. "It (the hot jar 

method) is based on the belief that children eat better if 

their lunches contain some hot food. Up to now, there seems 

to be little evidence that such is the case. When it was tested 

in the school meal study recently carried out in Toronto by 

the Canadian Red Cross Society, it was found the children ate 

cold lunches as well as those containing a hot food.-The 

calories provided by the heat in the food amounts to very little 

only some 6 to 10 calories in factj Therefore, the emphasis 

5 

on the hot school meal does not seem to be justified," 

Further research should eventually solve this controversy 
over the value of school lunch programs. This chapter will 
merely show a brief picture of what Alberta schools are doing 
in the field of nutrition. The data shown in the following 
tables are those gleaned from the nutrition section of the 
questionnaire sent to school divisions and school districts.

Table IX shows that vitamin pill administration in some 
form is provided to more than half the rooms covered by the 
survey. In the provision of both vitamins and milk the city 
school districts are far ahead of the other districts. Except 
for the one percent of rooms in which it is available to all 
students, milk in the city classrooms is supplied to undernourish¬ 
ed and needy pupils only, as selected by the school nurse. 

The information offered on the school meal program shows 
that a very small proportion of rooms are served with complete 
meals. The provision of a hot dish or hot beverage is much 
more common, and the school divisions with their large 




















































- 40 - 


number of rural rooms show more activity than the districts 
in providing such programs. The hot beverages served are 
cocoa and hot chocolate, the former being reported by far the 
more often. The hot dish served is usually soup but stew, 
and macaroni and cheese dishes were occasionally mentioned 
as substitutes for variety. Four divisions reported using 
the hot jar method in which the pupils bring food in a jar 
that can be heated in a steamer at school.

In Table X, the classrooms provided with school lunch 
programs have been classified to show a comp arisen between 
rural and urban rooms in school divisions. The table shows 
that more rural rooms than urban are served by school meal 
programs, although the percentage difference is not so great 
as might be expected. Since few rural pupils, unlike urban 
pupils, live close enough to the school to return home for 
lunch, all, or practically all, country classrooms would have

most pupils remaining for the noon meal. This fact should 
provide a greater incentive for the provision of hot school 
meals in rural areas. As indicated by the table, over one- 
half of the rural classrooms provide no school meal programs.

Table XI shows that the operating expenses of school 
lunch programs are beixg met in several different ways. School 
boards working cooperatively with parents, or local clubs, or 
with both, always provide the necessary equipment —stoves and 
utensils, and often cocoa and sugar. Parents in some cases 
provide money (usually 5 or 6 cents per day per pupil for a 
hot plate), or ingredients in other cases —milk, soup bones, 
or vegetables. Community clubs often provide labor and cash 
donations. The local club most often mentioned as helping 
toward school lunch programs is the Home and School Association.

School clubs are also included in the percentage figures for 
local clubs in Table XI, This table shows that school 
divisional boards finance wholly the lunch program in only 
1,4% of all division classrooms included in the survey. 

However, they assisted in 26% out of the total 36,1% of 
divisional classrooms provided with school lunches. These 
figures would seem to infer that school boards are willing 
to help other agencies in school lunch programs, but are 
reluctant to undertake the total responsibility, 

SUMMAEY 

The section of the questiormaire that surveyed school 
nutrition programs in Alberta schools found that vitamin pill 
administration in some form occurs in 53,5% of all classrooms. 
School divisions lead in programs that make vitamin pills 
available to all students. 

Milk administration which occurs in some form in 21,6% 
of all classrooms ranges from no room coverage in consolidated 
districts to 74,3% room coverage in city school districts. 

School hot lunch programs (the value of which is currently 
being debated by nutrition authorities) were also surveyed. 
Couplete school meals are provided in only 1,1% of all 
classrooms, and hot plates or hot beverages in 27,6% of all 
classrooms. Divisions reported the largest percentage of hot 
lunch programs (36,1) as would be expected because of their 
large percentage of rural students. 

The provision of school lunch programs is largely

CHAPTER VI 


SCHOOL BillIZATIOH USD HEALTH BTSPECTIOH SERVICES 


Chapter IV offered information on the facilities in 
Alberta schools for health protection in the field of 
school environment, sanitation and health equipment* The 
present chapter will show the extent of health protection 
provided to the school population by current immunization 
and health inspection practices* The questionnaire 
findings on school immunization practices will be presented 
first* 

SCHOOL HMJHIZATION 

Because the school brings children in close contact, 

“the health department has the responsibility of bringing 

about the immunization of a large percentage of school 

1 

children against certain diseases. 1 * Another reason for 

school immunization is that “the school group is somewhat 

more susceptible to certain communicable diseases than the 

2 

adult population.“ A perusal of current literature on 
school immunization indicates that authorities are generally 
agreed that a minimum program includes immunization of all 
pupils against smallpox and diphtheria, and protection 
against typhoid fever in areas with a high incidence of the

districts reporting regular programs indicate that their 
programs include immunization against both diphtheria and 
smallpox. 

The percentages for whooping cough include immunization 
programs begun at pre-school ages. According to information 
gained from interviev/s with health unit personnel, these 
programs are usually completed in grade one since reinforcing 
doses for whooping cough are rarely given beyond age six. 

HEALTH TESTS 

Health tests which are used in conjunction with 

immunization programs are not usually given on a regular basis 

to all pupils. Interviev/s with health unit and public 

health personnel, and a study of the annual reports of these 

health agencies indicate that it is general policy to give 

health tests only to selected pupils whose immunity to 

certain diseases is in doubt, or who are suspected victims 

of tuberculosis. The questionnaire returns revealed that 

the Mantoux test, the most general, was available to 62 # 6% 

of all classrooms. Positive reactors to this test are 

provided free X-Hay service at the provincial government 

4 

tuberculosis clinics discussed earlier. Schick test 
administration was available to 56.4%, and the Dick test 
to 54.3% of all classrooms surveyed.

SCHOOL HEALTH INSPECTION SERVICES 

As with iuanunization, there is general agreement that 

school health inspections are desirable, and even necessary* 

“The first responsibility of the health department is 

believed to be the medical examination of all children 

5 

entering the school system regardless of age.” The usual 

reason offered for giving such examinations f, is to assure 

that each child will be in the best possible condition to 

6 

profit fully from his educational experiences, 11 There are, 

however, differences of opinion on the frequency of school 

medical examinations. "The precise form of medical supervision 

is under debate here as elsewhere and we are not without 

critical observers who question the value of the periodic 

medical examination,-The question at issue is whether 

the time would not be better spent in other ways, leaving 

the teacher, nurse and parent to single out children for 

7 

special attention." As pointed out earlier in this survey, 

the Report of the Study Committee on Public Health Practice 

in Canada expresses the view that complete inspections beyond 

8 

the year of school entrance are wasteful. At variance with

this view ox* one complete medical upon school entrance with 

subsequent attention only to referred pupils is the current 

practice in Great Britain where the Board of Education has 

laid down regulations that a pupil "must be given a full 

9 

routine inspection three times during its school life." 

Alberta*s school policy on this question will be dealt 
with after a consideration of Table XIII which shows the 
percent of rooms with regular inspection programs, and the 
nature of these programs.

be assisted by a nurse. This inspection includes the 
measuring of height and weight, the testing of sight and 
hearing, the checking of teeth, skin, nose and throat, 
heart, nerve and glandular conditions, and orthopedic 
defects. The nurse f s inspection is less detailed than the 
complete medical given by a doctor. It excludes the testing 
of the heart, and usually excludes the checking for nerve 
conditions, and orthopedic and ear defects. 

It will be noted, on comparing Tables XII and XIII, that 
the figures showing the total percent of rooms in divisions 
and school districts with regular immunization programs and 
with regular health inspection programs are very close 
throughout. Most classrooms with immunization services also 
reported health inspection services. 

In Alberta *3 school inspection programs no general 
pattern of medical supervision is discernible. The 
questionnaire returns showed inspection programs to vary 
considerably in the number of medicals during a child*s 
school life and in the grade levels at which inspections 
are offered. Complete inspections by personnel that included 
doctors varied from two to four during the school life of the 
child. Classrooms provided inspection service by full-time 
health units usually reported three complete inspections 
during a pupil's school life at grade levels I, IV, and VII, 
and the inspection of referrals from all grades. The number 
of inspections provided by health personnel that included 
nurses only varied from two to nine during the school life of

In Table XV the tota.1 percentage of rooms reporting 
immunization and inspection programs, in divisions and in 
each type of school district, is broken down to show the 
percentage of rooms with programs financed by local effort 
alone and also the percentage financed by local effort with 
government support. The column headed "Locally Financed 11 
includes programs financed wholly by school boards or by the 
local governments of municipal districts, cities, towns, or 
villages. The figures under the column headed "Cooperatively 
Financed" show the percentage of rooms in each school 
administrative unit with programs financed by local authorities 
(local governments and school boards) in conjunction with the 
provincial government. The province 1 s share of the cost in the 
cooperative financing of school immunization and inspection 
programs varies from 50 to 60 percent and is used to help 
maintain public health nurses and health units which provide 
the school services. 

Table XV indicates that more than three times as many 
rooms in divisions and more than twice as many rooms in 
village and consolidated school districts are provided 
immunization and inspection services by local authorities with 
provincial aid than by local authorities alone. The city and 
town school districts show considerably more ability to provide 
immunization and inspection services by independent effort than 
do the less urbanized areas—the divisions, and the village 
and consolidated school districts.

SUMMARY 

A substantial percentage of Alberta classrooms covered by 
the survey have regular iimmmization programs (79*1%) and also 
regular inspection programs (77*7%)* However, only the records 
of the city and town school districts equal or better these 
provincial averages. The percent of classrooms reporting 
regular immunization services ranges from the low of 70*1 for 
school divisions to the high of SB.5 for city school districts* 
All regular immunization programs throughout divisions and 
school districts include protection against diphtheria and 
all, with the exception of a few town classrooms, also include 
protection against smallpox* 

Health inspection coverage of classrooms by special health 
personnel ranges from 64*2% in village school districts to 
98*5% for city school districts* The pupils in half of the 
rooms surveyed in all divisions and districts receive complete 
medicals by doctors from two to four times during their school 
life* Pupils in one quarter of all classrooms receive 
nurses* inspections only* 

Pupil health records are kept for 76*3% of all classrooms 
surveyed although the records for only 42*3% of the rooms are 
filed in the schools. 

According to the data offered on the financing of school 
immunization and inspection services, each of the less 
urbanized units of school administration (divisions, village 
and consolidated school districts) shows a larger percentage 
of rooms than the city or town districts, in which the two 


- 54 - 


preventive health programs are financed with the aid of 
contributions from the provincial government* However 9 the 
city and town school districts show a larger percentage of 
room coverage by immunization and inspection services because 
of considerably more local effort* The need for more 
provincial aid to provide school health personnel in rural 
areas and in smaller urban centres is indicated if immunization 
and inspection services are to becoms available to the more 
than 25% of classrooms in school divisions and in village and 
consolidated school districts not yet covered by either service* 



CHAPTER VII 


GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

The main object of this survey was to present a picture 
of existing conditions in the field of Alberta school health 
services* The survey has indicated that the general picture 
of Alberta 1 s preventive program is one of extremes and 
inequalities. Facilities for carrying out a preventive health 
program vary greatly among the different types of school 
administrative units surveyed. For exaiqple, all classrooms 
in city school districts are served by one or more types of 
special health personnel, and over 85% of these rooms reported 
the services of personnel that include doctors, nurses, guidance 
specialists and dentists. On the other hand, consolidated 
school district classrooms reported no services by dentists 
or guidance specialists, and over one-quarter of these rooms 
reported no special personnel of any kind. Nor is there 
uniformity of services noted among similar types of administra¬ 
tive units. Using the supply of special personnel again as an 
example, over one-fourth of the divisional classrooms have the 
services of both doctors and nurses but less fortunate are one- 
fifth of divisional classrooms that are served by no special 
personnel of any kind. Similar extreme variations are noted in 
the survey of all aspects of school health services. Such data 
suggest certain questions. Should pupils be denied health 
services because of the area in which they happen to live and 
attend school? It is true that the democratic principle of 



- 56 - 


freedom of choice is practised by leaving the provision of 
health services to local communities, but does not the 
application of this principle violate another democratic 
ideal — that of equality of opportunity? Since the state 
dictates that the child attend school, must not the state then 
assume the responsibility for the health and safety of the 
child while he is at school? 

It is not the purpose of this survey to present an ideal 
school health services plan for Alberta* That remains a subject 
for further study* Some general proposals, however, suggested 
by the questionnaire data and by the bibliographic material 
referred to in this study, are offered for consideration* 

School Health Personnel . An important part of a school 
health services program is dependent on the availability of 
school health personnel. Absence of preventive programs in 
more than 20% of all rooms indicates failure on the part of 
local initiative alone. To provide adequate health measures 
for these rooms more full-time rural health units should be 
established without delay. Health unit systems, besides 
providing adequate staff and facilities, have the merit of 
supplying needed government financial assistance without 
destroying local control. Schools in the more remote areas, 
where establishment of health units is not yet feasible, should 
at least have the services of a district nurse. 

Health Equipment and Sanitation . The survey has shown 
that in the field of school health equipment the facilities 
most often omitted are those for checking height and weight,

and sight and hearing. It is true that school health personnel 
carry such equipment with them on their periodic visits to the 
schools. However* even in schools fortunate to be served by 
special personnel certain basic equipment is needed if the 
teacher is to play her important part in the preventive program — 
the making of intelligent referrals. All classrooms should have 
access to such basic equipment as eye charts* scales* and height 
standards \ too* if the purchase of an audiometer is not feasible 
a suitable watch should be supplied to check hearing* 

School divisions reported the largest percentage of rooms 
with unsatisfactory sanitation facilities. Especially notice¬ 
able in divisions was the large percent of classrooms served 
by open drinking water containers (over 20%) and outdoor 
toilets (65%). As a preventive health measure all schools* 
where running water is not available, should be provided 
closed containers with individual drinking cups, snd outdoor 
toilets should be replaced by sanitary septic or chemical type 
toilets* 

School Nutrition . The provision of hot school lunches is 
recommended as a desirable procedure. If hot lunches are no 
more nutritious or palatable than cold ones* at least the 
cooperatively developed lunch program and properly supervised 
lunch hour provide excellent situations for practical lessons 
in health and personal development* 

Milk and vitamin pills should be supplied to the 
undernourished*

part of any preventive health program are measures taken to 
safeguard the pupils 1 health by immunization practices and 
periodic health inspections. 

A minimum immunization program should include protection 
of all pupils against diphtheria and smallpox. 

The inspection program should include one complete 
physical examination by a doctor, preferably at the year of 
school entrance. Fewer complete inspections of all pupils 
would allow more time for doctors and nurses to deal with 
referrals and to make follow-up visits to parents to encourage 
treatment. The time of special school health personnel 
should be spent on those who need their help.
