CHAPTER I 


1. PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATION 

The purpose of this study is to determine the degree of 
relationship which exists between the scores on the Grade IX and 
Grade XII Departmental examinations, with a view to evaluating the 
Grade IX examinations as predictive of the Grade XII examination 
results. 

During the past few years in Alberta, there has been a 
marked increase in emphasis upon a testing programme to provide 
teachers with information for the guidance of students. Standard¬ 
ized tests are being used in ever-increasing numbers. In spite of 
this trend, however, the chief means of predicting success in the 
high school is still the results of the Grade IX Departmental 
examinations. The efficacy of Grade IX marks in predicting Grade 
XII success has never been measured in this province. 

2. RELATED STUDIES 

The entire field of correlations between scores on school 
subjects, and between scores obtained in various grades may be 
divided as follows: 

(1) correlations between junior high school and senior 
high school scores, 

( 2 ) correlations between scores on subjects in high school, 
and ( 3 ) correlations between scores on subjects in high school 

and scores on subjects in college.

The main body of information available pertains to the 
relationship between high school and college marks. Jones and 
Laslett (12) found that the college entrance examination predicted 
college success more accurately in senior college years than in 
junior. In the same study, it was found that good scholastic 
records depended mainly on intellectual ability and on industry, 
and that the best single criterion for the prediction of scholastic 
success is the average high school mark. 

Many investigators such as Edds and McCall ( 4 ), Finch and 
Nemzeh (7)» Jones and Laslett (12), Schmitz (l5)j Thurber (18) and 
Williamsen (23) found that as a single predictor of college success, 
the average of the high school marks is superior to an intelligence 
test score. Separate studies by Douglass (2) and Nelson (14), on 
the other hand, revealed that success in any one subject or in 
combination of subjects in the high school had no bearing on marks 
obtained in college. Wagner and Strabel (19) stated that prediction 
was better for females than for males but that the best results were

CHAPTER II 

METHOD OF INVESTIGATION 

1. DIVISION OF POPULATION 

For this study the student population of Alberta was divided 
into three groups as follows: 

Group I - City - This group contains the students from 
centers with a population greater than 10,000. 

These centers are Calgary, Edmonton, Lethbridge 
and Medicine Hat. 

Group II - Town - This group contains all students from 

communities with a population of less than 10,000 
but greater than 1,000. This includes the towns 
of Banff, Blairmore, Camrose, Cardston, Claresholm, 
Coleman, Drumheller, Edson, Grande Prairie, Hanna, 
High River, Inni3fail, Lacombe, MacLeod, Magrath, 
Olds, Ponoka, Redcliffe, Red Deer, Raymond, 
Stettler, St. Paul, Taber, Vegreville, Vermilion 
and Wetaskiwin.^ 

Group III - Rural - This group contains all centers with a 
population of less than 1,000.

2<> SELECTION OF STUDENTS FOR THE STUDY 

Students with the following two qualifications were selected 
for the purposes of this investigation: 

1. Residence - The candidate must have taken his schooling 
from Grade IX to Grade XII, inclusive, in the same community. Any 
movement of a candidate from one community to another automatically 
eliminated him from the investigation. 

2. Examinations - The candidate must have completed his 
Grade XII in one of the years 1941, 1942 or 1943 and have written 
Department of Education exanimations in the following subjects: 

(a) Grade IX 


English 


(Eng. IX) 


Mathematics

1* Original or first test scores were used throughout. Or 
conversely stated, supplemental test scores were disregarded. 

2. The Algebra II and the Trigonometry and Analytical 
Geometry marks were averaged to give a score called Mathematics 
XII (Maths. XII). 

3<> At least two of Biology II, Chemistry II and Physics II 
were required. In the case of all three having been taken the three 
were averaged. 

4* The scores Average IX and Average XII were obtained by 
averaging the scores of the four subjects in each grade. 


3. SOURCE OF DATA 

The candidates were chosen from students who had received 
their High School Diplomas in the years 1941, 1942 or 1943* The 
data were taken from the files of the Records Department of the 
Examinations Branch, Department of Education, Government of Alberta. 

The years 1941, 1942 and 1943 were chosen for the following 

reasons: 

(1) The years 1944 to 1947 were considered to be abnormal 
because of the unusual veteran enrollment in high school, and because 
of the considerable numbers of students lured from high school to 
take well-paid jobs. 

(2) The recording of the 1943 results was incomplete at the 
time of the investigation. 

(3) Because the staff of the Examinations Branch were making 
constant use of the student files, it was decided to use the years

1941 > 1942 and 1943 » thus affecting a compromise between inconvenience 
to the staff and the recency of data* 

( 4 ) No significant change had taken place in the high school 
curriculum since 1941 * 

( 5 ) The effect of the war on the students was, because of 
their age, negligible* 

Statement (5) above may sound somewhat arbitrary. The only 
study we were able to find regarding the effects of the war on high 
school scholarship was that of Feingold (l)* He concluded that the 
effects were slight, and on the basis of this conclusion we have 
permitted ourselves to assume that war effects may be disregarded. 

A total of 6622 student files was examined from which 2199 
students were selected as eligible* These were divided into three 
groups, as follows, 

Group I - City - 1263 students 
Group II - Town - 274 students 
Group HI - Rural - 662 students 

Total 2199 students* 


4* SjWPLING PROCEDURE 

The above numbers would obviously not meet the requirements 
of random sampling for the reason that our two qualifications of 
eligibility, residence and examinations, greatly favored City over

Column ( 2 ) shows the high school enrollment for the three 
groups in the year 1942* The totals for Groups I and II were 
secured from the returns made by high school principals to the 
Department of Education. The total for Group III was obtained by 
subtracting the sum of the first two totals from the overall 
enrollment of 20,133 students as shown in the 1942 Annual Report 
of the Department of Education. 

These totals were considered to be not quite accurate. 

The largest deviation was felt to exist in Group III for it was in 
this group that all students who for various reasons such as late 
registry, special cases and correspondence were placed, when they 
should have been more properly placed in Groups I and II. For this 
reason the actual attendance was modified as shown in column ( 3)0 
From column ( 3 ) the ratio of the number of students in each group 
was obtained as shown in column ( 4 )*

Column (5) shows the actual number of student files in each 
group that meet the requirements of eligibility for that group for 
the three years of 1941, 1942, and 1943* The reason that the number 
of eligible student files in Group III in this column is so low in 
proportion to the attendance, is that students could not meet the 
conditions of eligibility because (l) the students had moved to other 
centers to complete their high school programs, and (2) their Grade XII 
programs fell short of our requirements, the largest number being 
eliminated because they lacked either Algebra II or Trigonometry and 
Analytical Geometry. 

Column (6) represents the actual sample drawn at random 
from each group. A total sample of five hundred was drawn, the number 
from each group being determined by the ratio from column ( 4 )• For 
example, the sample from Group I is 184 cases. This figure was 
determined by dividing five hundred by nineteen (the total of the 
ratio) and multiplying the quotient by seven, the ratio of City 
students. 

After the sample of 500 had been drawn, the distribution by 
sex within each group was found as shown in Table V.

5. CONSTANT ERROR 

It was found that the method used in transmuting Grade IX 
scores was different from that used in transmuting Grade XII scores. 
This discrepancy has resulted in the introduction of a constant 
error. To compensate for this error, a correction factor for the 
means of the Grade XII subjects was calculated. This correction 
factor was determined by averaging the means of the four Grade IX 
subjects and subtracting from that average the average of the means 
of the four Grade XII subjects. The difference between these two 
averages is the correction factor. It was found to have a value of 
6.30.

CHAPTER III 


SUMMARY OF DATA 

The findings of this investigation are divided into three 
sections: 

(1) means and mean differences, 

(2) correlation coefficients, the significance of correla¬ 
tion coefficients and the significance of the 
difference between correlation coefficients, 

( 3 ) prediction of Grade XII marks from Grade IX scores* 

1* MEANS AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MEAN DIFFERENCES 

The means for the entire sarnie, and for the City, Town 
and Rural groups have been summarized in the following tables* The 
significance of the difference between the Grade IX and the Grade 
XII means is also shown in each case.

Assuming the sample to have been taken at random from a 
population in which school marks are normally distributed, the 
differences between the Grade IX and the Grade XII means for the 
Average, English end Social Studies are small enough to be 
explained by errors in sampling and measurement. We can conclude, 
therefore, since the differences could occur by chance in more than 
5f4 of the cases, that there is no significant difference between 
the Grade IX and Grade XII means for these subjects. The size of 
the differences between the Grade IX and Grade XII means for 
Mathematics and Science, could occur in less than Vfo of the cases 
as a result of sampling errors. Therefore, the difference between 
the Grade IX and Grade XII means for Mathematics and Science must 
be regarded as highly significant and attributed to some cause other 
than chance.

Assuming the sample to have been taken at random from a 
population in which school marks are noimally distributed, there 
are differences between the Grade IX and Grade XXI means for English, 
Science, Social Studies and Average that could have occurred through 
chance errors in sampling and measurement in more than 5% of the 
cases. We can conclude, therefore, that there are no significant 
differences between the Grade IX and Grade XII means for these sub¬ 
jects. The difference between the Grade IX and Grade XII mean for 
Mathematics cannot be explained by the possibility of chance errors 
in sampling and measurement since a difference of the size obtained 
could occur through sampling errors in less than 1% of the cases* 
Therefore, the difference between the Grade IX and Grade XII mean for 
Mathematics must be regarded as highly significant and attributable 
to some cause other than chance*

Summary 

A significant difference was found between the Grade IX 
and the Grade XII mean fbr Science both in the entire sample and in 
the Rural group. The mean for Grade IX English was also found to 
differ significantly from the mean for Grade XII English in the 
Rural group. In all but the Town group a significant difference 
was found between the Grade IX and Grade XII means for Mathematics. 
No significant differences were found between the Grade IX end the 
Grade XII means for the other subjects either in the entire sample 
or in the three groups. 

Since the overall Grade IX and Grade XII averages were 
equated by means of the correction factor, it is obvious that the 
plus and minus differences found in subject comparisons must be 
equal to zero. Hence the significance of the differences observed 
consists merely in the comparative "difficulty" of Grade IX and 
Grade XII examinations in the several subjects for the three groups. 
For example in the case of Rural students (see Table IX), English 
of Grade XII seems relatively easy and Mathematics relatively 
difficult in comparison with those subjects in Grade IX.

2* CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE 


The correlation coefficients for each subject of the Grade 
IX scores versus the Grade XII scores both throughout the entire 
sample and in the City, Town and Rural groups, are summarized in 
the following tables. The significance of the correlation coeffi¬ 
cients obtained is shown in each case, 

A comparison of the correlation coefficients obtained for 
each subject has been made between the sample and the City, Town 
and Rural groups; the City group and the Town and Rural groups; 
and the Town and Rural groups. The significance of the difference 
between the correlations is shown in the second part of each table.

The correlation coefficients, obtained from a randomly 
selected population in which marks of this kind are normally dis¬ 
tributed, were found to be very significant, and due to some 
relationship other than chance, since differences from a correla¬ 
tion of zero of this size are large enough to have occurred through 
chance factors in less than 1% of the cases. 

The comparison of the correlation coefficients for All, 
City, Town and Rural groups shows no significant difference for 
the All versus the City, Town and Rural groups, the City versus 
the Town and Rural groups, or the Town versus the Rural group. We 
can conclude, therefore, that there are no significant differences 
between the correlation coefficient of the Grade IX Average versus 
the Grade XII Average since differences of the size obtained could 
have occurred in more than 5 $ of the cases through errors in 
sampling and measurement.

The correlation coefficients obtained are very significant 
and due to some relationship other than chance, since the differences 
from a correlation of zero are large enough to have occurred through 
chance factors in less than 1 % of the cases. 

The comparisons of the correlation coefficients show no 
significant differences for the All versus the Town and Rural groups, 
for the City versus the Rural group and for the Town versus the 
Rural group. Since differences of the size obtained could have 
occurred through chance factors in more than 5$ of- the cases, we 
can conclude that there are no significant differences between the 
correlation coefficients of the Grade IX English versus the Grade XII 
English for these groups* The comparison of the correlation 
coefficient for the All versus the City group shows a difference 
that is barely significant. We can conclude, therefore, that there 
is a significant difference between the correlation coefficient of 
the Grade IX English and the Grade XII English in these two groups, 
since a difference of this size could occur in more than 1% but in 
less than 5% of the cases through sampling errors. Comparison of 
the City versus the Town group shows a difference that cannot be 
attributed to chance errors in sampling, since a difference of the 
size obt ined ccvld have occurred in less than 1% of the cases 
through chance errors. Therefore, there is a very significant 
difference between the correlation coefficient of the Grade IX 
English versus the Grade XII English in the City versus the Town

Assuming the sample to have been selected at random from a 
population in which school marks are normally distributed, it was 
found that the differences between the correlation coefficients 
and a correlation of zero could occur in less than 1% of the cases 
because of chance errors in sampling* We can conclude, therefore, 
that the correlation coefficients between Grade IX Science and 
Grade XII Science for the entire sample and for the City, Town and 
Rural groups are due to some factor other than chance* 

The comparison of the correlation coefficients for All, 
City, Town and Rural groups revealed, in every instance, a dif¬ 
ference in correlation coefficients that could occur because of 
chance factors in more than 5% of the cases. We can conclude,

Summary 


The relationship between the Grade IX and the Grade XII 
scores in the subjects and the average for the entire sampLe, and 
for the groups, revealed correlation coefficients ranging from 
0.Z)$ to 0.74* The comparison of the correlation coefficients 
shows no significant difference for the Average, Mathematics, 
Science, and Social Studies, between the entire sample and the 
groups, the City from the Town and Sural groups, and the Town 
from the Rural group* The only exception is in the case of English, 
This subject revealed significant differences between the entire

3. THE PREDICTION OF GRADE XII MARKS FROM GRADE IX SCORES 

* 

The following table shows the prediction equations for 
the Average and the four subjects, English, Mathematics, Science 
and Social Studies, for the sample and the City, Town and Rural 
groups, 

# 

The efficiency of prediction, E, that is shown, expresses 
as a percentage the proportionate reduction in the error of 
estimate from the maximum error characteristic of zero correlation* 
That is, the range of likely hypotheses for any predictive estimate 
is a certain percentage less than the range of such hypotheses 
when the correlation coefficient equals zero.

Assuming that the relationship between the Grade IX and the 
Grade XII scores is linear anti that these results are obtained from 
a random sample of a normally distributed population, we can 
estimate the Grade XII score from a given Grade IX score by means 
of the prediction equation. By linearity we mean that for each 
successive change in one variable, there is a proportionate change 
of a constant amount in the other variable. The estimated Grade XII 
score obtained from the prediction equation is the most probable 
score. It is an average estimate. The standard error of estimate 
gives the limits within which the predicted score will not be in 
error in more than one case in three. 

To illustrate the use of the table, X= 0.66Y + 16.93 is the 
equation for predicting the Grade XII Average score from the Grade 
IX Average score for a student in the City sample when 0.68 is the 
correlation coefficient. The error of estimate is ir 7*66, or 
nearly 8. Given a Grade IX Average score of 70» for instance, for 
a City student in our sample, and substituting this score in the 
above equation, gives a result of 63 ±8. This means that given the 
Grade IX Average score of 70 we can predict that the Grade XII 
Average score will be within the limits of 55 and 71 with a chance 
of being correct in two-thirds of the samples. 

The correlation coefficient of 0.68 has a predictive 
efficiency 26.7% better than a guess.

CHAPTER IV 

1. CONCLUSIONS 

On the basic assumption that the departmental examinations 
employed are valid measuring instruments, this study has revealed 
that a positive correlation, ranging from 0»4& to 0.74 for the 
sample selected, exists between the Grade IX subjects and the same 
subjects in Grade XII<> This finding agrees with the findings of 
other investigations. However, an exact comparison is difficult 
because of a lack of studies of similar groups. The obtained 
coefficients are quite in line with those obtained by other inves¬ 
tigators at the high school-college level. 

A Grade XII score predicted from a Grade IX score is not 
very accurate. The index of predictive efficiency, devised by 
Clark Hull for work such as this, shows that the predicted score 
varies from 9 to 32 percent better than a guess, depending on 
the subject in which the prediction is made. Again we must con¬ 
clude, as have other investigators, that the Grade IX scores yield 
low predictive index values for Grade HI and alone are of little 
practical use. 

The correlation of a subject in Grade IX with the same 
subject in Grade XII was found to be the same in the City, Tom, 
and Rural groups. A possible exception is the relation of Grade 
IX to Grade XII English between the City and Town groups. Perhaps 
a further investigation with a larger sample, especially in the 
Town group, would reveal more convincingly the nature and the 
extent of this difference.

Pace 33. 


Because of the use of the correction factor, only a relative 
comparison can be made of the Grade IX and Grade XII means. It was 
found that the Grade IX means differed from the Grade XII means only 
in the cas'e of Mathematics. If the mean is used as an indication 
of difficulty, we can conclude that Grade XII Mathematics was found 
to be more difficult than Grade IX Mathematics. In the Rural group, 
it v;as found that, for English and Science, the mean of Grade XII 
scores was higher than the mean of those in Grade IX. The Town 
sample, on the other hand, revealed no differences in subject means 
between Grade IX and Grade XII, but it was felt that the size of the 
sample is rather too small to make this finding conclusive. Further 
studies with larger samples might reveal the reason for these 
differences. 


2. IMPLICATIONS 

The prediction of a Grade XII score from, the Grade IX score 
is not much better than a guess, using Hull’s index of predictive 
efficiency as the measure. This was to be expected, because, as 
other investigators have shown, there is a multitude of factors 
affecting the scholarship of the student* Some of the factors are: 
the maturity of the student, physically, mentally, emotionally, and 
socially; the influence of his social contacts; the home, school, 
and community environments; and the student’s own personality, 
aptitudes, capacities, and interests. The action of these other 
factors would tend materially to reduce the predictive efficiency 
of the Grade IX scores. Perhaps then, the best answer to the problem 
of prediction is a careful choice of a sample having one factor 
variable while the ether factors are held constant. Prom such a

study as this, the effect of each factor could be evaluated for its 
influence on scholastic attainment* From these analyses a better 
predictive measure could be devised, which would more satisfactorily 
meet the requirements of a high predictive efficiency index. It is 
evident from this and other similar studies that as a predictor, the 
single factor method fails* A predictive measure of utility to 
educators will, no doubt, be a complexity of factors weighted 
according to their influence*
