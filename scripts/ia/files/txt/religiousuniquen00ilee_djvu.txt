CHAPTER I 

INTRODUCTION 

Despite those who would make Jesus merely a man of 
his own day, and a product of his environment, there was 
uniqueness in Jesus, The expectation v/as that this would 
show itself mainly in nis teachings, however, after study¬ 
ing the problem and the sources, and comparing Jesus’ 
teaching with the Judaism of his day and with the religion 
of the Old Testament, it was found that there was a novel 
spirit manifested in the teachings, but that this was not 
the heart of the matter, nather we had to come to the con¬ 
clusion of the Primitive uhurch and of Paul that here there 
was a totality of distinction. Jesus was partly a man of 
his day, and therefore there were Jewish elements in his 
teaching and life, but there was also an element of creat¬ 
ivity about him in every aspect of his life, teaching, 
actions, death and resurrection, it seemed the conclusion 
had to be that it was the act of Cod in human history that 

was unique. We had to say with Peter, "You are the Christ, 

1 

the Son of the living Cod" » Soil® of the force was taken 

2 

out of this, because in Mark we had, "You are the Christ" , 

3 

and in Luke, "The Christ of cod" • in Mark’s transfigur¬ 
ation narrative however, the voice said, "This is my beloved

Son; listen to him" , and the other two merely amended 
this or expanded it somewhat* 

iviany have felt that in the wew Testament there were 
two religions, one Jesus' own religion, and the other the 
religion about Jesus, that the simple Gospel of Jesus, 
consisting of the sermon on the Mount, and tne other 
teachings, had been transformed by haul and the other 
primitive Christians into the uhristologieal Gospel, of 
which the main doctrine or article of faith was that Jesus 
was the Son of God, Upon surveying tne material in the 
Gospels, it would seem that this was the natural outcome 
of what had happened. These men were attempting to ev¬ 
aluate what had happened in uhrist and this was the con¬ 
clusion to which they came. As we studied his life, 
actions, teaching, death ana resurrection, we too were 
forced to this conclusion. The early church gradually 
began to understand that they were a new community, en¬ 
trusted with a new message * 

"Christianity was wording towards 
self -consciousness"' ♦ 2 

Although we felt that this only gradually came about 

after the resurrection, it did so because the seeds had 

been sown in Jesus 1 2 lifetime, and were only coming to 

fruition afterward.

Paul was therefore no innovator. The task to 
which he set himself was that which occupied all 
Christian teachers in that first generation. It 
always happens that when a great event is finally 
over men begin to reflect on it and try to form 
some judgment of how it came about and what it 
signified and how it will affect the future. So 
when Jesus had departed it was clear to his fol¬ 
lowers that something wonderful had taken place . 1 

And once again we were attempting to evaluate and to 

understand the originality in Jesus and his message which 

produced this new society with a new message. What were 

the seeds in Jesus and in everything concerning him which 

did come to fruition after the whole play was over? St. 

2 

John said, "and the Word became flesh and dwelt among us* . 
Why did they feel that and what did they see in Jesus? 


Men had been conscious in his lifetime of a 
mystery in Jesus, and the sense of it grew even 
deeper after his departure . 3 


Again and again in the Gospels we are told 
that the disciples failed to understand some act 
of Jesus 1 2 3 4 until after he had risen, and this may 
be taken as literally true. After the Resurrection 
they were able to see their experience of Jesus 
with new eyes. The inner purport of much that had 
perplexed them or had seemed at the time quite 
trivial was now made plain. They could apprehend 
the divine message which had been conveyed to them 
through the earthly events * 4 

What was this mystery? Where can we better find the answer 

than in the gospels? E. F. Scott feels that the gospel 

writers were not averse to the theological doctrines which 

had sprung up, that Mark contains many of the ideas of 

Paul, and that these can also be traced in Luke, and that

these writers, being aware of the problems of the Christ¬ 
ian community wished to determine the facts, What do we 

1 

see in these facts about Jesus that Floyd V. Filson can 

say: 

The New Testament message' concerning uou speaks 
continually of ’the Lod and rather of our Lord Jesus 
Christ T , (II cor. 1: 3; Lph. 1: 3; I Fet. 1: 3). 
what it has to say concerning c-oa is vitally linked 
with the teaching ana work or Jesus, to whom c-oa 
was unquestionably the central reality ana ror whom 
prayer to (fod, as rather was so significant that his 
Aramaic wora for rather, Abba, lived on even in the 
erreeK tradition and m the prayer life of the ohurcn, 
(ids:, 14: 36; nom. 8: 15; o-a, 4: 6). in the minds 
of the New Testament writers, theism is interlocked 
with christology. otatements concerning u-od con¬ 
tain a reference, expressed or implied,to the person 
and work or Jesus ohnst. Therefore we can grasp 
the distinctive character of the New Testament mes¬ 
sage concerning cod only' by a clear discernment of 
the originality of its teaching about Jesus uhrist* 


Thus it would seem that our faith is xounded upon the rock 
of Feter, who saw coa in Jesus Christ, 

As the early Christians looked at Jesus, they saw 
how he lived, how ana what he thought, how he acted, and 
how he died, ana they saw this all m the light or the 
resurrection. 

The revelation he brought was identical with 
his own Ferson and with the things he did and suf¬ 
fered * 2 


From the first, therefore, there have been 
two elements in Christianity, distinct from each 
other and yet woven together, on the one hand

there is tne Christian message, the truths about 
God and man’s relation to him which Jesus proclaimed* 
They are profound and far-reaching, so much so that 
men have never fathomed their full significance. 

The effort of Christian thought was to understand 
these truths and to unfold them and apply them from 
time to time to man’s changing needs, but along with 
this message of Jesus there was the tradition concern¬ 
ing his own life, tie spoke with authority; there was 
something in himself which gave confirmation to what 
he taught, if his message was to be accepted he had 
therefore to be personally known, how had he lived? 
What had he done to convince his followers that he 
uttered the mind of uod? Without this knowledge of 
Jesus his message was only a religious theory which 
might or might not be true, he was himself the 
evidence on which it rested. Men had been conscious 
of this in his lifetime, and felt as they listened 
to him that his word was with power 1 


The evangelists, perceive that Jesus’s teach¬ 
ing had been part of his redeeming work, his word 
was with power and by means of it he had imposed 
his will on men and demons. After each of his 
actions he had spoken significant words, and it was 
these which put the seal on that which he had done. 

The great final act of his death was all of a piece 
with what he had ever been teaching, and could not 
be understood if it were taken wholly by itself. 

It is an old Creek saying, ’Speak and l shall know 
you’, and this applies in a unique degree to Jesus 
for he never spoke without a transparent sincerity. 

He put himself into his words, so that they revealed 
his nature and supplied the key to everything he did. 
They were nothing else than his action made intel¬ 
ligible. So the evangelists combine the teaching of 
Jesus with their narrative of his life « 2 


Now it has been observed that Jesus naturally was 
partly a product of his Jewish heritage. Many of Jesus’ 
actions were shaped largely from his study of the Old 
Testament Scriptures, of which he was sucn a good student .

Many of his teachings came from these, either quoted or 
in essence, as well as from. Rabbinical literature. Much 
of Jewish belief about God, life and human nature Jesus 
just accepted and used. But in his actions and teachings 
there was much that was unique. His silences often were 
pregnant with new meaning as well as his sayings and 
actions. Besides being a reopening of the great prophetic 
line he was the outstanding creative genius. It was the 

way he handled his heritage, and the life which issued 

1 

from it that was so novel. Morgan , felt that if Paul 
abrogated the Law, Jesus also did so in his own way. 


If Jesus does not proclaim the Law 1 2 3 4 s abrogation 
as a statutory system, by tacitly dropping whatever 
in it is without moral significance, by bring¬ 
ing into the foreground the spiritual principles 
underlying it and by giving to these principles 
a larger and finer application, he really makes 
of it something new. 


Jesus’ way of dealing with everything was certainly pro- 

phetic, and the people said that he was a prophet, that 

2 

he spoke with authority and not as one of the rabbis • 

But others saw even more than that in his method of "But 
3 

I say unto you" , and in his being willing to forgive sins. 

They saw a real creative genius and they said, "This Is 

4 

the Christ, the Son of the living God" . A creative genius

builds something new from wnat is already present, and 
thus also did the greatest creative genius of all time* 


If one can say it without irreverence, Jesus 
is original in the same sense - not that he creates 
raw material, but that he uses it to build a new 
structure , 1 


And harold Guy says: 

The prophet, as the 1 2 3 one who speaks openly 
( -iff o -) before men, is still needed and will still 
be heeded when he speaks with the authentic voice. 
That voice, as we have had occasion to remarK more 
than once, is heard supremely in the utterances 
and work of Jesus, it was inevitable that there 
should be in Jesus points of contact with his pre¬ 
decessors, jlmo revelation of God ever came as a 
bolt from the blue, without antecedents or gene¬ 
alogy. Jesus was in the prophetic line, and he 
made use of the same means of receiving knowledge 
of God - prayer; faith, obedience - and the same 
means of communication to others - action as well 
as word - as the prophets had used before him and 
as men of God have used since. 

So Jesus was an original, prophetic, creative gen¬ 
ius, using his heritage as it seemed best to him, as 
well as something more, even the very Son of God himself. 


They have found that some principles are 
inherent in the nature of things, and that all goes 
wrong when these are put aside. Originality con¬ 
sists, not in breaking away from these principles 
but in a deeper understanding of them. In them¬ 
selves they are as old as time, but since they 
survive all changes there must be something in 
them deeper than we yet know. It is the very mark 
of an original man that what he does appears to 
be perfectly natural, his poem goes to your heart 
because it touches an emotion you have felt your¬ 
self . 3 

This was what happened to the folk among whom Jesus lived

and taught, he expressed reality for them, and they knew 

it because their heart responded* iMo one ever expressed 

reality as Jesus did and so it was felt he was the Son of 

God* he uncovered their hearts for them and they saw 

truth, reality, and authority. "He had brought a new 

revelation but it only disclosed what had been implicit 
1 

in the old one" • 

And Jesus did add new meaning to some of the religious 
concepts, and phraseology of his day. His teaching pro¬ 
claimed in extreme and radical form the nature of God and 
God’s will for men. He put new understanding into the con¬ 
cept of God’s nature. How far will a person go for some- 

X 

one else? We go only -so tar, but as Haul said; 

Why, one will hardly die for a righteous 
man - though perhaps for a good man one will dare 
even to die. nut God shows nis love for us in that 
while we were yet sinners Christ died for us. 

The seeking father was expressed in Christ. Jesus’ idea 
of the kingdom of God was new, and also his concept of the 
Messiahship, and of the fellowship of belieVers. Because 
of his guiding principle of complete obedience to God’s 
will, and his better understanding of that will, his ethic 
was far more demanding and discriminating than the Jewish 
ethic. He stressed the inwardness of religion, and the

humility inherent in the prophets, but this had been lost 
track of in the maze of Jewish law-making and keeping. And 
there was a new element of complete self-giving in Jesus 1 
ethic, which is often thought of as the plus of Christianity. 
Jesus understood that there are spiritual laws in harmony 
with the nature of God, which must be obeyed, or the result 
will be spiritual death. Also Jesus had his own unparalleled 
way of expressing truth. Some people refer to it as the use 
of the "gigantesque". His method of presentation was cert¬ 
ainly that of a creative genius. The kind of orginality we 
have in Jesus is summed up in a few words: 


This does not mean that Jesus disowned or 
abandoned Judaism, neither he nor his followers did 
that. They held rather that they offered the true 
Judaism. They knew that the acceptance of their 
position meant the radical transformation of the 
Judaism in which they lived, and this meant that 
the recognized Jewish leaders would be immediately 
and vitally affected by such changes. The intent of 
Jesus and the Apostles, however, was not to destroy 
or abandon Judaism, but rather to act under God the 
father in bringing the ancestral faith to its truest 
and climactic form* 1*

CHAPTER II 

SOURCES 


The Biblical sources used for this thesis were the 
Synoptic Gospels - Matthew, Mark, and Luke, These sources 
have been treated in various ways by the critics, since 
they have been studied as historical documents. 

One treatment has been that or the Literary unticism 
scnool, wnere the gospels themselves have been separated 
into various sources, Mark, which was the first gospel and 
a basis for the other two, Q,, which was the source or the 
teacmng, and M and L, wriicn were the distinctive parts 
of Matthew and Luke. This was the division roughly, al¬ 
though there may have been a few other sources as well. 

This fact is a very clear hint that any 
profitable investigation of the life and teaching of 
lesus must work more and more with the four Syn¬ 
optic sources, MK, M, L, rather than with the 1 
tnree synoptic wospeis. 

ne gives an excellent treatment of these various sources 
and concludes: 


The conclusion to be drawn from this discuss¬ 
ion is that we nave in the synoptic record four 
sources for the teaching of our Lord. Of these 
MK, representing the reminiscences of Peter, takes 
the leading place and supplies tne frame work 
which we must use. As supplements to what we have 
in MK, we can use ^ and L with confidence and 
with greater reserve, M. Each source has its own 
peculiarities. MK is a simple, objective record

of word and deed: Q, is - M a~r 

- the words of Jesus - a collection of the 
oracles of the Lord modelled on the prophetic 
books of the Old Testament: L is a selection of 
interesting and memorable stories about Jesus 
and striking parables from his teaching: M is 
an attempt to make a ’new’ Law by combining the 
teaching of Jesus with the Law of Moses. In Q, 

Jesus is the Prophet; in M the Kabbi, however 
unorthadox; in L he is one who fulfils the pro¬ 
phecy in Isaiah and Uiii^ : ’The Spirit 

of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed 
me to bring good news to the poor* he has sent 
me to proclaim liberty to the captives and res¬ 
toration of sight to the blind, to set at lib¬ 
erty those that are oppressed, to proclaim the 
year of the favour of the Lord. In Mark he is 
all this and something more - something which 
lies hidden in the enigmatic title ’Son of Man’. 

Q, M, and L emphasize different aspects of our 
Lord’s life and teaching to such a degree that 
we might almost call 4) a Gospel for the votaries 
of ethical religion pure and simple, M a Gospel 
for ecclesiastics, and L a Gospel for evangel¬ 
ists and missioners. These are rash general¬ 
isations and not to be pressed too hard; but 
they serve to convey the general impression made 
by these three sources. And it is just because 
0,, M, and L make each a single and simple impres¬ 
sion that they stand, in a manner, apart from 
Mk. They simplify by what they omit. MK on the 
other hand is obscure and difficult - and the 
most important of them all - first because it 
presents a picture of the whole personality of 
Jesus and reveals him as someone greater than 
can be measured by any of our ordinary stand¬ 
ards. it is St. Mark’s portrait before which 
we must stand. We may fill in the details of 
his Sketch from our other sources; but if we 
desire to keep the picture true to the life, we 
must keep the outline which MK presents. 1 

There have been various theories as to how these 

sources were first put together. According to Manson the 

"Ur-Marcus” theory is now discredited, and the ’’Proto- 

Luke” hypothesis of Streeter is also without much credence.

Marie was likely written in Greek, but Q, was thought to 
have been first written in Aramaic, and Manson seemed to 
feel that the original language of L, as a written document, 
was Greek. Perhaps lvi was written first in Aramaic. How¬ 
ever this may be, it seems very definitely accepted now 
that before ail of these, there was a period of oral trad¬ 
ition and that this period was Aramaic. 

The idea of the period of oral tradition before the 
written gospels has been one of the great contributions 
of "Form Criticism" to the study of the gospels. This 
school did not study the gospels according to their 
literary sources, but rather studied them as a collection 
by the early Christian community of various forms of the 
sayings of Jesus, which it finally wrote down. Most of the 
context of the sayings has no value, since it was supposedly 
supplied for the sayings by the authors of our present gos¬ 
pels, or by the Christian community. Many of the sayings 
and stories about Jesus have also been supplied or altered, 
according to the Form Critics, by the creative Christian 
community. Some of this development in criticism was very 
good. The idea of a period of oral transmission and the 
idea of forms have been a big help. Cibelius, the most 
usable of these critics has classified the forms as - 
sermons, paradigms, tales, legends, analogies, and the 
Passion Story. But some of these critics have gone so far 
as to feel we cannot have a historical life of Jesus at all,

and that we cannot know what, of the sayings even, are to 
be attributed to Jesus, and what to the early Christian 
community. They often felt that a historical life of 
Jesus was not essential anyway, as long as we had the 
uhrist of faith. Sperry quotes George Santayana as saying: 


The gospels are not historical wotks but 
products of inspiration...Their criterion of 
truth is not evidence or probability; it is con- 
gruity with the faith...(They) were composed 
in the church, by the church, and for the church. 
...It was the church that gave authority to the 
Gospels, not the Gospels that determined the 
faith of the church. 1 


and 

I am not attempting to reconstruct a Life of 
Jesus, i am only studying the idea of Christ in 
the Gospels. And in that idea, beneath the legend¬ 
ary figure of Jesus on earth, there is undoubtedly 
a theological and mystical figure of Christ the 
Son of God, the eternal Word of the Father - the 
idea of God in man...The critic can never reach 
any historical conclusions about the historical 
Jesus, because almost everything we know about him 
or can reasonably suppose rests not on independent 
lay evidence about the person of Jesus, but on 
inferences drawn from the existence of Christ in 
the mind of Christians,..As in poetry, so in rel¬ 
igion, the question whether the events described 
have actually occurred is trivial and irrelevant... 
The spiritual value of the idea of Christ does not 
depend on its having been already realized in facts 
but on the depths to which it sounds the ultimate 
vocation of every living being...This mystery is 
entirely natural; by no means the invention of a 
wild theosophy but only a poetic expression of the 
dawn of spirit in every reflective mind. 2

Bultmann stated the extreme form critical position very 
well: 


I do indeed think that we can now know 
almost nothing concerning the life and person¬ 
ality of Jesus, since the early Christian sources 
show no interest in either, are moreover frag¬ 
mentary and often legendary; and other sources 
about Jesus do not exist* 1 


Little as we know of his life and personality, 
we know enough of his message to make for ourselves 
a consistent picture* Here, too, great caution 
is demanded by the nature of our sources. What 
the sources offer us is first of all the message 
of the early Christian community, which for the 
most part the church freely attributed to Jesus* 

This naturally gives no proof that all the words 
which are put into his mouth were actually spoken 
by him* As can be easily proved, many sayings 
originated in the church itself; others were mod¬ 
ified by the church. Critical investigation shows 
that the whole tradition about Jesus which appears 
in the three synoptic gospels is composed of a 
series of layers which can on the whole be clearly 
distinguished, although the separation at some 
points is difficult and doubtful...Hence every¬ 
thing in the synoptics which for reasons of lang¬ 
uage or context can have originated only in 
Hellenistic Christianity must be excluded as a 
source for the teaching of Jesus...By means of 
this critical analysis an oldest layer is deter¬ 
mined, though it can be marked off with only 
relative exactness...Of course the doubt as to 
whether Jesus really existed is unfounded and 
not worth refutation. No sane person can doubt 
that Jesus stands as founder behind the historical 
movement whose first distinct stage is represented 
by the oldest Palestinian community. But how 
far that community preserved an objectively true 
picture of him and his message is another question. 2 


Other modern critics, however, believed we could have

a life of Jesus from our sources. They accepted 
much of the early tradition about the gospels, such as 
Papias’ idea that Mark wrote down what he remembered 
of Peter’s story of the gospel, and other such ideas* Some 
of these critics made Jesus a man of his day and felt that 
his very Jewishness attested his historicity* 


Taking the gospels at their face value they 
attest what we should have expected from early 
and trustworthy reports of Jesus. His speech, 
as quoted, his categories of thought, his sub¬ 
jects of discussion were all in the manner and 
range of contemporary Judaism. *. In revealing 
the Jewishness of Jesus the gospels supply at 
the same time credentials for the general ac¬ 
curacy and contemporaneousness of their own 
material* 1 


Others like E. F. Scott feel that the gospel material 
is as accurate and trustworthy as it was possible for the 
writers to be, and that from them we can know the Jesus 
of history* He sets forth the theory that the Gospels 
were written as a historical anchor for the Christian 
faith. Therefore, since memories were good in those 
days and the authors were desirous of providing a his¬ 
torical picture of Jesus, and since they were relying 
on trustworthy apostolic tradition, the gospels give 
us a good picture of Jesus. 

This whole problem of the authenticity and 
reliability of the Gospels comes back, however, 
to the impression made by the Gospels themselves* 

You are as entitled as the next man to trust your 
instinct and intuition in this matter. 2

That is the presupposition of this essay, and the writer 
feels there is authentic history in the Gospels. The 
essential facts, looked at from various points of view 
by various authors, and yet unchanged, is one reason for 
this. With E. F. Scott it is felt that the purpose of 
the gospel writers was to provide as authentic an account 
as possible of Jesus 1 life and teaching. 

It was felt that to deal with the gospels in the mode 
of Form Criticism would be a study in itself, and that the 
conclusion of such a study would be that definitely there 
was some slight influence of the early church on the gos¬ 
pel tradition, but that it contains a real history of the 
life and teaching of Jesus. To enquire into the religious 
uniqueness of Jesus, these sources, Matthew, Mark, and 
Luke, have been taken as authentic. There are other 
sources, like the Gospel of John, which could have been 
considered, but it seemed best to concentrate on these, 
and from them to study the earthly life of Jesus. The 
method of procedure has been to set down various topics 
and gather together all the material on these subjects, 
first in the separate gospels, and then to put the mat¬ 
erial from the separate gospels together on a certain 
topic. 1 have accepted the view of Manson that the var¬ 
ious sources have their own peculiarities, and that one 
version may be earlier - and more authentic than another, 
and that we can tell from the style and other factors,

e.g. Mark is more realistic and shorter, while Matthew 
and Luke are amplified. Also I have accepted the idea 
from Form Criticism that in the period of oral tradition 
there was some influence of the Christian community upon 
the gospel material. The Little Apocalypse was from the 
early church. Their influence was felt in the arrange¬ 
ment and selection of the material as well. And as the 
various topics are dealt with, if these factors influence 
the material and the essential spirit of Jesus, they will 
be brought up for discusssion* Otherwise the three gos¬ 
pels have been accepted, and from them was obtained a 
picture of Jesus 1 life ana teaching, with a view to see¬ 
ing, if possible, just what it was that made Jesus orig¬ 
inal . 

In the overall picture, such sources as Paul, and the 
Apostolic Preaching, have born their witness, as to what 
they saw unique in Jesus, but the proof for conclusions 
drawn has all come from the three Synoptic Gospels. 

These were the sources used, and this the method of pro¬ 
cedure. ,

CHAPTER III 

THE JEWISHNESS OF JESUS 

Jesus was a Jew and to minimize the role his Jew¬ 
ish heritage and background played in his life and teach¬ 
ing would be quite mistaken. This was admitted as we 
began the search for originality. Jesus was influenced by 
Judaism and by the uld Testament Scriptures especially, 
but the originality came in because of what he did with 
his heritage. He did not just accept everything, but was 
very discriminating in picking out the best and disregard¬ 
ing the rest. He was thus building something new from 
the old, just as any great creative genius would do* 


Therefore the originality of Jesus can be 
approached as one approaches the originality of 
great creators in other areas of human activity. 
Shakespeare’s Hamlet restB ultimately on the 
Danish history of Saxo Grammaticus and borrowed 
devices from Thomas iiyd’s play The Spanish 
Tragedy. The hero of the one is a northern 
barbarian; of the other, a helpless weakling. 
Hamlet is more than both, and the earlier works 
are read to-day only because they were used by 
Shakespeare. Likewise Charles Dickens had all 
sorts of raw material to draw upon for his Pick¬ 
wick Papers. Some of his characters are easily 
recognized as having prototypes before his pen 
began to write. Who that has read Pickwick can 
forget Mr. Alfred Jingle?...Yet he had existence 
before Dicken’s day...The Alfred Jingle of Pick¬ 
wick Papers is original. 

If one can say it without irreverence, 

Jesus is original in the same sense - not that 
he creates raw material, but that he uses it 
to build a new structure. When a Chicago apart¬ 
ment is wrecked, the old bricks are piled up 
and sold. They go into new buildings. They 
make up the side walls and the rear. Hew bricks

are used only for the front. Some of the bricks 
Jesus used were worn smooth. They had no corners 
left, jb'or example, "You must love the Lord your 
God, with your whole heart, your whole soul, your 
whole mind, and your whole strength," and "your 
neighbour as yourself", hut the mortar that he 
used to fasten that brick in place was the story 
of the good Samaritan, and in all religious ex¬ 
perience since his day love of neighbour has had 
a new tone because of it. 1 


Because of the work of such men as Joseph Klausner, 

G. G. Montefiore, Robert Travers Herford, and R. ii. Charles, 
and others, the knowledge or Jewish parallels to the say¬ 
ings of Jesus has been greatly increased. So much so that 
many of these felt that there was nothing original about 
Jesus. 


Whatever he meant by it, Jesus from the first 
to the last preached the kingdom of God. And what 
ever it was taken to mean by those who used the 
term, the concept of the kingdom of God was wholly 
Jewish...But the point at present is simply this, 
that in speaking of tne kingdom of God, Jesus 
was using a purely Jewish term, and using it just 
as it had been used for centuries before his time. 
It has not been shown that he added any new 
feature to the meaning which it had for the com¬ 
mon understanding of those who heard him. 2 


Klausner felt that Jesus was a Jew till his last breath. 

He and Montefiore, in the commentary on the first three 
Gospels, found countless parallels to Jesus’ teaching in 
the Jewish sources. 

Jesus was not merely a copyist, but rather a creator 
of something new, but there are many parallels between the

sayingsof Jesus and the Rabbinical literature and the 

literature of the Old Testament. And there were many 

concepts taken over by Jesus, but he put his own stamp 

on them. Ivlontefiore gave us parallels to a great many 

of Jesus 1 ideas and therefore we cannot say he drew a 

system of ethics out of thin air. Jesus taught rather a 

way of life than an ethic and it was found that there are 

only a few essential ideas original with Jesus. Montefiore 

worked through the gospels in detail and found little that 

was new with Jesus. The Beatitudes were worked through 

carefully, but the ideas were already in Judaism. I was 

unable to go through all his work in detail, but we 

accepted the fact that there was much of Judaism in Jesus, 

"There is hardly anything in the Lord’s Prayer for which 

1 

some parallel cannot be found in earlier religion” . 

Yet as a whole it expressed Jesus’ unique message to the 
peoplel Moore in his book on Judaism showed us so much 
from the Old Testament and Rabbinical literature that was 
the same as Jesus. The Jews were monotheists and in Isaiah 
there was the idea of a mission for Israel to the Gentiles 
and even of their suffering for them. But what these men 
were really doing was picking out the very best in Judaism, 
and this did influence Jesus. Most of the Jews did not 
understand this at all. Usually they did not interpret

passages as a whole in any way, but only verses here and 
there in the way of midrash. It took Jesus to pick out the 
very best in his heritage, and to discriminate between the 
necessary and the unnecessary, and to build something real 
for living from it. In other words the seeds of Christian- 
ity were in Judaism, but it took Jesus to hoe away some of 
the rubble; so the seeds could spring up. Moore felt that 
Jesus accepted all the JewIs n law, but there were places where 
he really disagreed with the law if he felt he should. He 
healed the man with the withered hand on the sabbath. The 
Jews could waive their sabbath laws, if it were a matter of 
life and death, but actually this was not. It was merely 
doing good rather than harm. Jesus accepted the Jewish Script 
ures and was greatly influenced by them, but he chose what 
he wanted from them, and he interpreted them as he saw fit. 

I'or the Jew the written and the unwritten law had equal author 
ity, and every part in it was the revealed word of God. 

It was wrong to transgress even the most trivial part. 

Jesus however in the prophetic spirit interpreted Script¬ 
ure and even contradicted it, "But I say unto you". 

As Moore felt, Jesus did believe, as his people, in 
monotheism, in God the creator and preserver, the holy 

ruler of the world who is also merciful and gracious. "The 

1 

Lord upholdeth all that fall". God is active, and this

was the core of Jesus’ teaching that God is active now . He 

believed at the same time that man has freedom of the will 

and can choose between the right and wrong, and that the 

result of sin is judgment. He told the woman taken in 

1 

adultery to go and sin no more , and we have the story 

of the gathering of the nations, where those who had done 

the will of God inherit the kingdom, but those who have not

are cast into everlasting darkness . The main thing for 

Jesus as well as the Jews was to do the will of God, but 

Jesus’ idea of God’s will was different. He did not think 

the ritual and ceremonial purity and atonement essential 

for salvation; it was the moral that Jesus eared about. Of 

course, here again he was in the line of the great prophets 

who wanted mercy and not sacrifice. Jesus used the best 

in his religion and of it he made something new. We only 

need to compare the endless rules in the Mishnah with what 

Jesus taught to see he picked out the heart of things. In 

a few words about whether it was better to do evil or harm, 

3 

Jesus gave us a principle of Sabbath observance „ But in 
the Mishnah there are twenty pages of rules about what to 
do and what not to done the Sabbath. Moore would probably 
say Jesus accepted these, but I doubt if he would pay much 
attention to them.

If a man put out the lamp (on the night of 
the Sabbath) from fear of the Gentiles or of 
thieves or of an evil spirit, or to suffer one 
that was sick to sleep, he is not culpable; 

(but if he did it with a mind) to spare the lamp 
or to spare the oil or to spare the wick, he 
is culpable. But R. Jose declares him exempt 
in every case excepting that of th© wick, since 
he thereby forms charcoal. 1 


There are thirteen pages of regulations for "Bills of 
Divorce", fourteen pages for "Oaths" and seven pages on 
"Hands" (clean), and likely this book has been cut down. 

If a man poured water over the one hand 
with a single rinsing, his hand is clean; but 
if over both hands with a single rinsing, R. 

Meir declares them unclean unless he pours 
over them a quarter-log or more. If a loaf 
of Heave-offering fell (on the water) it 
remains clean. But R. Jose declares it unclean. 2 


In Judaism repentance was shown this way, but for Jesus and 
the prophets it was shown in a new heart and such like. And 
God wanted repentance so badly He did not just wait as a 
Sovereign for people to return to Him. He went out and 
sought the lost according to Jesus. 

I believe Jesus accepted the cultus of his day, but 
he did not put great emphasis upon it. He told the man 
whom he had cleansed to go and show himself to the priest, 
and do an offering for his cleansing. Jesus himself taught

in the synagogue . He prayed , but he did make a distinction 

3 

between ritual and sincere prayer . He was taken as a boy 
4 

to the temple , and he went to Jerusalem, for the Passover 
5 

feast . He fitted in to the system and he used it, if he 

6 

could, and cleansed it when he had to , but he lived his 

religion. It was not just a cultus. It was only as this 

helped the Godly life that it could be used. 

His motive for ethics was the same as the Jews, to do 

the revealed will of God, But he seemed to apprehend it so 

much more clearly, and to expect it to be truly obeyed, not 

watered down by all their little laws. The reason Moses 

had allowed them "Bills of Divorce" was because they could 

not live un to God’s demand on a man and woman joined together 

7 

till death parted them . Jesus’ ethic is more demanding, 
but it rests on the same basis as Judaism. And much of the 
best of the Old Testament is in harmony with Jesus’ require¬ 
ments, although he added a self-giving quality to it that 
it did hot have. Theprophetic spirit demanded that one should 
not speak ill of others nor demand usury of them, that the 
poor should be cared for, that all should be chaste and mod¬ 
est and humble. In Judaism itself there was the idea that

vou should not even look on a woman to lust any more than 
v 1 

commit adultery, just as Jesus said. There were evid¬ 
ently Rabbinical parallels to cutting off your hand or 

2 

plucking out your eye, if it offended . Jesus esteemed 
humility, and this also has been praised in the Old Testa¬ 
ment, by the best of the prophets. They, especially Isaiah 
and the Ps&lms, influenced Jesus. According to Tasker, he 
had a real appreciation of the genius of Hebrew religion. 

He did not say that the two commandments he gave of love 
God, and fellows was original, but that they were the 
greatest,commandments* 

There were two influences of the Scriptures which we 
saw in Jesus. His life was penetrated by them, and he quoted 
them. This, of course, came together many times, because 
he quoted them as he was arrested by them. Tasker gave us 
a very good idea of this: "The influence of the Old Testa¬ 
ment upon His thought and teaching goes very much deeper 

3 

than the mere quotation of individual passages" . Accord¬ 
ing to him the Old Testament conditioned the development 
and understanding of Jesus ? divine vocation. It was bom 
in on him early that he was to be the fulfillment of what 
he read in the synagogue. As he obeyed his parents he 
realized that the perfect sacrifice could only be made by

perfect obedience. There was a growing awareness, and then, 

as he submitted to John’s baptism, the message came in the 

1 

words of the second Psalm . When he was tempted he answered 

2 

from Scripture, especially Deuteronomy , When he began his 

3 

ministry, he felt he was fulfilling Isaiah 61 • He stood 

up and declared it in the synagogue. As the opposition grew, 

so did his realization of his death. He remembered that the 

4 

prophets had been killed . But the realization that his 

death was not to be just another martyrdom came clear to 

5 

him as he studied the Suffering Servant of Isaiah , During 

the last week of his life there was the influence of the 

Old Testament. Was he not thinking of Jeremiah and Ezekiel 

6 

when he instituted the New Covenant at the Last Supper . 

7 

And his cry on the cross was from Psalm 28 . 

And Jesus did quote much scripture. The major part 
of these quotations came from Deuteronomy. In fact he quoted 
Deuteronomy fifteen times. Some were in Exodus, and one in 
Leviticus and Numbers. But the rest of his quotations, ex¬ 
cept for two from Genesis, and three from Leviticus were from

the prophets and the Psalias. He quoted from Isaiah five 
times, hut only nnce from Hosea, Malachi, and Zechariah. A 

list of all these is given in the hack of a Harmony of the 

1 

Gospels * It is quite evident that it was not the Priestly 
code which influenced Jesus, hut rather the prophetic strain 
in the Scriptures, and yet with his obvious knowledge of 
these we cannot say his rejection of so much of the tradition 
was merely because he was an ’amme-haaritz’. He really knew 
his Scriptures and tradition, and his silences were pregnant 
with meaning. 

It was not the negative golden rule stated positively 
that put something new into Jesus 1 teaching. That was not 
actually Jesus’ gospel. It was something far more self- 

giving than that. Jesus accepted much about God (which was 

% . h 

believed in his day) and much of the then-current escatology, 

but into all of these things and others he put more of God’s 
meaning. With this,later chapters will deal. 

We feel that Jesus was a Jew from what he said, which 
paralleled Judaism, and from what he did not say, wherein 
he assented to recognized beliefs. But we also feel that he 
had a new spirit, both from what he said, and also from his 
silences, where Judaism was especially verbose. Jesus was 
a Jew , but not all Jews were Jesus. Colwell quotes Case:

While effective leaders are always men 
of their own day, sharing abundantly in the life 
of their fellows, they exhibit also in some un¬ 
usual degree ability to effedt the release of 
fresh ideas or ideals, a power to concentrate 
upon some slumbering interest, a self-sacrificing 
readiness to serve some worthy cause, a new in¬ 
sight into life’s values, a peculiar capacity 
for organizing hitherto incoherent yearnings, 
or an inspiring personal devotion to a timely 
enterpriseo 1 


Of all men, Jesus, whom we believe to be the Son of 
God, was able to transform his heritage almost beyond

CHAPTER IV 


JESUS* UNIQUE METHOD Off PRESENTATION 
Jesus used many of the forms of Jewish teaching, but 
still his method of presentation had a uniqueness about it, 
which made it possible for the people to remember his teach 
ing easily. Also it made them sit up and listen to his 
teaching as something new and different. 

His sayings were often in the prophetic manner: 

Woe unto thee, ChorazinI woe unto thee, 

Hethsaidal for if the mighty works had been done 
in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you they 
would have repented long ago in sackcloth and 
ashes. But l say unto you, it shall be more tol¬ 
erable for Tyre and Sidon In the day of judg¬ 
ment than for you. 1 

0, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth the 
prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto 
herI how often would I have gathered thy child¬ 
ren together, even as a hen gathereth her chick¬ 
ens under her wings, and ye would not l Behold 
your house is left unto you desolate. For I 
say unto you, ye shall not see me henceforth, 
till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh 
in the name of the Lord* 2 

and countless others which could be mentioned. As the 

Jewish rabbis also, he used parables, proverbs, hyperbole, 

and paradox. Jesus told so many parables and they are so 

well known that there seems no advantage in quoting any. 

A few of the proverbs are: "Ye cannot serve God and mammon

"For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners"; and

Some of 


1 

"Therefore by their fruits ye shall know them" . 

Jesus f proverbs were not original with him, but a great 
many were of which these quoted are examples® 

Jesus used the same forms of parallelism as was 
characteristic of the Hebrew poetry, and the rhythm also* 

His teachings were easily remembered because they were in 
this form, and we can say the same thing about Jesus as 
Burney about the prophets, "It is obvious that they must 

2 

have possessed wonderful powers of poetical improvisation" . 

It was the poetry of a great creative genius. The following 

are examples of Synonymous, Antithetic, Synthetic, and Step 

parallelism: 

Love your enemies 
Do good to your haters, 

Bless your cursers, 

Pray for your persecutors. 5 

For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; 
And whosoever shall lose his life for My sake and 
the gospel * s shall save it, 4 

They make broad their phylacteries, 

And enlarge their fringes, 5 

He that receiveth this child in My name, receiveth 
Me; 

And he that receiveth Me, receiveth Him that sent 
Me • 6 


Thus Jesus did use the same forms in his teaching as 
the Rabbis, as well as much of the Old Testament parallelism,

but there was something different about Jesus 1 teaching 
which arrested the people f s attention. Naturally the con¬ 
tents of his radical teachings had much to do with this, 
but that was not everything. His parables were unique not 
only because of the teaching, but because of the way he 
told parables. Colwell says, and I wish to agree with him 
although Cadbury does not: 

Thus we miss in the teachings of Jesus all 
technical vocabulary and those abstract definit¬ 
ions or special uses of terms which are so char¬ 
acteristic of the schoolroom and of the modern 
pulpit...The quality of some of this narrative 
as narrative is often overlooked. It was a 
teacher of English literature and not a prof¬ 
essor of Bible who pointed out to me many years 
ago the bare narrative quality of many of the 
finest parables. If you will take as an ex¬ 
ample the parable of the prodigal son and elim¬ 
inate all descriptive adjectives or adverbs, 
all description of any kind, you will take 
almost nothing from the story. It is action 
itself in words. It is narrative stripped to 
the running gears, without adornment and without 
refinement, 


It was felt by Colwell and others that this narrative 
quality was illustrated in parable after parable, such as 
the good Samaritan, the buried treasure, and the pearl 
of great price and others, and that this quality could 
be attributed to Jesus himself. The period of oral trans¬ 
mission was brief, and usually the editors explained and 
expanded Jesus' short sayings. 

Jesus 1 method of argument was also much the same as 


1. Colwell, E. C., An Approach to the Teaching of Jesus . 
(New York, Abingdon-Cokesbury Press), 1946, p. 27*

the Jewish method, by analogy and comparison. There was 

the a fortiori argument; "If God so clothe the grass..* 

1 

shall he not much more clothe you" ? and "If ye being 

evil know how to give good gifts to your children how 

2 

much more shall your Father which is in heaven" ? and there the 

argument drawn simply from equivalence, "The measure you 

3 

give is the measure you get" , and "Freely ye have received, 

4 

freely give" . Jesus often used Old Testament examples 
in this type of argument. These showed in Jesus’ mind a 
kind of mathematical logic. 


They show in Jesus 1 2 3 4 5 6 mind, if they are gen¬ 
uine, a kind of quantitative mentality - a ten¬ 
dency to deal with moral truth in terms of 
measure or size. Even when Jesus follows an 
opposite tack and speaks in the form of paradox 
the quantitative element often remains: 5 


"He that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater 
6 

than John" , and "He that is greatest among you shall be 
7 

your servant" • This was all characteristic of the Jewish 
mind. But there was a novel quality in Jesus’ arguments 
also • 

He argues from human behavior and from the 
processes of nature to spiritual truths. He does 
not hesitate to infer that what man does God also 
will do, or will be even more likely to do. A

churlish parent does not answer a son’s petition 
for bread or fish by offering useless objects, 

A lazy neighbor and an unjust judge ultimately 
respond to importunity, A shepherd seeks a lost 
sheep with energy even when ninety-nine others 
are perfectly safe. How much more will God care 
for the requests and needs of his human children. 
...Whether by induction or by illustration, 
spiritual truth came to him in close association 
with the observable data of outward life. He 
assumed a kind of mathematical consistency be¬ 
tween the natural world and the spiritual, 1 


Jesus’ knowledge of the nature of God was such that his 
great insight into human nature and the natural v/orld 
showed him from where he could profitably draw analogies 
between the two, and he did not hesitate, nor argue. He 
merely stated well-known facts of human nature and the nat¬ 
ural world, comparing the working of God unto these, and 
allowing the hearts of people to argue in favour of his 
statements, ’’The facts of religion and the ethics may be 
directly observed in nature and in men since all of life 
is homogeneous and mutually analogous ? Jesus did not give 
expression to a complete system of theology, but his teach¬ 
ing was incidental, concrete and popular, and unsystematic. 
He spoke to human need when it arose, and his arguments for 
the nature of God he took from analogy with nature and man. 

But the distinctive factor in Jesus’ presentation was 
his language. It, like his message, was rugged and extreme.

The words of Jesus have the rugged fiber 
of the cypress tree and the jagged edge of the 
crosscut saw. Nothing but an excessive famil¬ 
iarity with his words or an insulated ignorance 
can keep us from perceiving this rigorous element. 
His language is extreme - extravagant. Hyperbole, 
antithesis, and paradox mark his style. His fig¬ 
ures of speech are crammed with energy. Explos¬ 
ive as hand grenades, they are tossed into the 
crowds that listen. A tremendous vigor, an 
exuberent vitality, surges through his words. 1 


Many people call this quality the humour of Jesus. I 
prefer to agree with Colwell that there is nothing humour¬ 
ous about them, but rather as he says rigorous indictment. 


Professor E. J. Goodspeed used to quote a 
saying of G. K. Chesterton as applied to this 
quality in the words of Jesus: f The words of 
Jesus’ said Chesterton, ’are gigantesque’. This 
is the most appropriate of all adjectives for 
the sayings of Jesus. They are the sayings of 
a giant - freighted down with tremendous weight 
and loaded with explosive power. 2 


Jesus’ words had to be rigorous to convey his rigorous mes¬ 
sage, and we cannot explain away this element in his teaching 
without doing injustice to his message. It has been tried, 
by saying the quality comes from Oriental rhetoric, or frogi 
lack of historical knowledge, but the attempt has been un¬ 
successful, because this was a consistent part of all 
Jesus’ teaching. 

Examples of this quality are numerous, but here are a 


few:

Or wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me 
cast out the mote out of thine eye; and lo, the 
beam is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast 
out first the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt 
thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy 
brother’s eye* 1 

Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, 
neither cast your pearls before the swine , lest 
haply they trample them under their feet, and 
turn and rend you* 2 

Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened 
unto a certain king, who would make a reckoning 
with his servants. And when he had begun to rec¬ 
kon, one was brought unto him, that owed him ten 
thousand talents * (each about |1000) But for 
as much as he had not wherewith to pay, his lord 
commanded him to be sold***and the lord of that 
servant, being moved with compassion, released 
him, and forgave him the debt. But that servant 
went out, and found one of his fellow-servants, 
who owed him a hundred shillings (about 17gf each): 
and he laid hold on him, and took him by the 
throat, saying, Pay what thou owest. So his fel¬ 
low-servant fell down and besought him, saying, 

Have patience with me and I will pay thee. And 
he would not: but went and cast him into prison, 
till he should pay that which was due...Then his 
lord called him unto hi$, and saith to him, Thou 
wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, 
because thou besoughtest me: shouldest not thou 
also have had mercy on thy fellow-servant, even 
as I had mercy on thee?..... 3 

But whoso shall cause one of these little 
ones that believe on me to stumble, it is profit¬ 
able for him that a great millstone should be 
hanged about his neck, and that he should be sunk 
in the depth of the sea* 4 

Ye blind guides, that strain out the gnat, and 
swallow the camel l 5 


And again I say unto you, It is easier for a 
camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich 
man to enter into the kingdom of God* 6

Some of the other contrasted extremes are bread versus a

a grain of mustard seed versus a mountain, and a boat’s 
cable versus sewing thread. As Colwell very picturesquely 
puts some of the ideas; 

A mountain gathers its limbs under it, 
summons up all its strength, and leaps into the 
sea. The corpses bury one another. The man 
who would save his life must lose it. The 
first is last, and the last first. 1 

Another distinctive thing about Jesus’ language was 
that besides using much analogy from nature and human life, 
his teaching was full of images drawn from daily life. With 
Jesus, everything was so concrete and vivid. A long list 
of these with their scriptural references is found in 
Colwell. 


In the words of Jesus we find references 
to salt, a lamp and a bushel basket, a shirt, 
wild birds, wild flowers, grapes and thorns, 
figs and thistles, the foundations of a house, 
sick people and a doctor, patches, wineskins, 
children playing on the street corner, the far- 
mer sowing a crop, weeds, mustard, yeast, buried 
money, a pearl, a fish net, the dogs eating under 
the table, a vineyard, the mint and dill growing 
in the garden, whitewashed tombs, a hen and her 
chicks, a fig tree in the spring, bridesmaids, 
sheep and goats, a robber in a strong man’s house, 
the farmer and his crop, a cup of water, a mount¬ 
ain, a coin, a poor but devout widow, a coat left 
in the house, a bridegroom, fox holes, a plow, 
lambs and wolves, three loaves o,f bread, an egg 
and a scorpion, bigger and better barns, the crows, 
the rain clouds before the storm, a lost sheep, 
a lost coin, a prodigal son, a dishonest manager, 
a sick beggar, a servant waiting on table, an 
unjust judge, and vultures around a dead body. $

Thus Jesus had a striking method of presentation. 

His parables had a unique narrative quality, noted by 
students of the English language. His arguments were by 
analogy from nature and human nature, and cannot really be 
called arguments at all, but rather inferences - about the 
spiritual realm. And his language was uniquely extreme 
and rigorous, as well as concrete and vivid* Jesus had 
a striking way of presenting a new message. 

naving now dealt with the technical questions involved, 
we turn to the message of Jesus as seen in his life and 
teaching*

CHAPTER V 


THE SEEKING FATHER 

Mark seemed to emphasize Jesus’ speaking with 
authority, his exorcism of demons, and his working of 
miracles in the realms of nature and of human nature as 
the reason for his popularity, or at least for his 
attracting attention, either approving or disapproving. 
This was likely very true, hut this thesis also maintains 
that there were original elements both in Jesus’ religion 
and in his ethic which flowed from his religion. 

Jesus put more end new content into the conception, 
which the Jews held, of the nature of God. He accepted 
the Jewish belief that God was the king and ruler of the 
universe, as well as its creator and preserver. The Old 
Testament and Rabbinical literature also had called God 
"Father", and the best strain in Judaism thought of His 
forgiving the repentant. 


In early Judaism we find the Fatherhood of 
God prominent in doctrine and piety: it is a 
common theme of Rabbinic teaching, and ’Father’ 
is a common mode of address in prayer. One of 
the products of Jewish piety in this period is 
the name ’Father in heaven 1 for God, a phrase 
which also meets us in Matthew. This name is 
always used in a personal way, ’Our Father who 
is in heaven’ or with some other possessive 
pronoun...In the Rabbinical literature the 
Fatherhood of God is conceived as an ethical 
relation between God and Israel...Many fine and

noble thoughts of the Rabbis centre round the 
doctrine of the Fatherhood and all that it 
implies of duty and privilege...Enough has been 
said to show that when Jesus spoke of God as 
Father he was not presenting a new and revolut¬ 
ionary doctrine for men’s acceptance; but rather 
taking up into his teaching something that had 
been part of the faith of prophets, psalmists, 
and sages for centuries before:...Yet although 
the doctrine was neither a*novel thing nor 
yet peculiar to Christianity, it did become one 
of the central things in the new faith and that 
at a very early date...Moreover, one has only 
to read the New Testament to realise that ’the 
Father’ was not a mere article in a creed or 
just a title for God, but a burning conviction, 
a spiritual experience which gave ne?; meaning and 
value to life, and brought new peace and joy to 
human hearts...The question is at once posed: 

What did Jesus do to this old belief in the 
Fatherhood of God to give it such power and 
influence over the lives of men? 1 


We certainly cannot delete Hosea from the Old Testament, 
and he felt that God was most merciful because He loved 
His people so. But Jesus, in his teachings and in his 
actions, represented God as even more than this, as 
loving his children with such a love that ge would go 
out and search for them, repentant or not. He would 
attempt to make them repentant, and in so doing He would 
suffer with and for them. He loved them with a kind of 
love of which mankind had no conception until Jesus rev¬ 
ealed it. It was something very new, and unique in Jesus. 
Jesus put such content into the term ’’Father”, which had 
already been used, that the nature of God and of father¬ 
hood were understood in an entirely new way:

According to Montefiore one of the unique 
things both in Jesus’ teaching about God and 
in his own example was that love involved seek¬ 
ing out the lost. He also described Jesus’ 
teaching about divine fatherhood as ”an old 
familiar doctrine” of the rabbis in ”a high 
degree of purity, warmth and concentration” 1 


Jesus felt that man should have perfect trust in 

2 

God, ”your Father who is in heaven” • He is perfectly 

trustworthy and impartial, ”for he maketh his sun to rise 

on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and 
3 

on the unjust” . Jesus’ relationship with his Father 
was so intimate and personal that perfect love cast out 
fear. He knew instinctively that you should: 


Be not anxious for your life, what ye 
shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for 
your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the 
life more than the food,and the body than raim¬ 
ent? Behold the birds of the heaven, that they 
sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into 
barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. 

Are not ye of much more value than they? And 
which of you by being anxious can add one cubit 
unto the measure of his life? And why are ye 
anxious concerning raiment? Consider the 
lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil 
not, neither do they spin: yet 1 say unto you 
that even Solomon in all his glory was not 
arrayed like one of these. But if God doth so 
clothe the grass of the field, which to-day 
is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall 
he not much more clothe you, 0 ye of little faith? 
Be not therefore anxious, saying, What shall we

eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal 
shall we he clothed? For after all these things 
do the Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father 
knoweth that ye have need of all these things. 

But seek ye first his kingdom, and his right¬ 
eousness; and all these things shall be added 
unto you. 1 


He judged from eafcthly fathers 1 2 3 love for their children 
that God knew how to love His children even better: 


If ye then, being evil, know how to give 
good gifts unto your children, how much more 
shall your Father who is in heaven give good 
things to them that ask him? 2 


Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? 
and not one of them shall fall on the ground 
without your Father: but the very hairs of 
your head are all numbered. Fear not there¬ 
fore: ye are of more value than many sparrows. 3 


Manson felt that: 


Jesus did not preach in public about the 
Fatherhood of God, but occasionally spoke 
privately about it to his closest friends and 
followers. For them he made God the Father 
real, not by argument or by much speaking, 
but because it was obvious that the Father 
was the supreme reality in his own life... 

The experience of God as Father dominates 
the whole ministry of Jesus from the Baptism 
to the Crucifixion...Thus at the very begin¬ 
ning of the ministry we are shown an experience 
on the part of Jesus which involves the relation 
of son to father between Jesus and God... 

Once again, in the prayer in Gethsemane, the 
Father appears as the supreme reality in the life 
of Jesus/ the will of the lather is the dominat¬ 
ing factor in the--life —

of the Son. And in the prayer this absolute 
trust in the Father and complete obedience to 
his will overcame the natural shrinking from 
the approaching ordeal* 1 


Scott pointed out that Jesus was thinking of all humanity 
and not just the Jews, when he said, "Our Father": 


Take the words ’Our Father*, familiar to 
every worshipper in the synagogue. When Jesus 
uttered them he was not thinking of a chosen 
race which claimed to stand in a special rel¬ 
ation to God. He spoke for all humanity, 
and in the name ’Father* he gathered up every¬ 
thing he had taught of God’s love and compassion, 
and of his care for each of his children. 2 

It was the grand discovery of Jesus that 
every human being had a destiny of his own, a 
personal claim on God. This may be regarded 
as the distinctive element in the religion of 
Jesus. His conceptions of God’s power and 
wisdom and goodness had all, in some measure, 
been anticipated, but he was the first who 
dared to believe that the sovereign God was 
mindful of every human soul. He taught us to 
call God ’Father* in the consciousness that 
each one of us has something in him of God’s 
own nature, and that his life, though it may 
count for little by earthly standards, has 
a value in God’s sight...We are to pray to 
God in the confidence that he knows us one 
by one and will give to us what we separately 
need. 3 


Jesus taught us about the nature of God in his parables 
and also in his own actions toward people, and it was 
Manson who said, "at- the same time it shines through his words 
and deeds, in such wise that those who see him see the 
Father. By what he is he makes the Father real to men,"

And what he revealed to us was the forgiving, seeking, suf¬ 
fering quality of the Father’s love. He told the story of 
the shepherd who had ninety-nine sheep safe, but one was 

lost, and he went out and sought till he found the lost 

1 

sheep . Also he told the story of the woman who had lost 

2 

her coin, and she hunted till she found it . And the parable 

of the "Prodigal Son" was also to illustrate this seeking 

and suffering quality in God. The father did not wait till 

the son was ho$e but when he was still a long way off, he 

ran to him and rejoiced that he had returned 0 Jesus said, 

"Even so, I tell you, there will be more jop in heaven 

over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous 

4 

persons who need no repentance" . Jesus was so different 
from the Rabbis, who demanded that all the little laws 
be fulfilled, because he knew the Father’s heart yearned 
over his children and that God wanted them in a right 
relationship to Himself* 


The question as to forgiveness, as far as 
the teaching of Jesus is concerned, is thus the 
question what is to be done about this debt or 
this estrangement. And the answer of Jesus is 
perfectly simple. Let the debtor realise that 
he is bankrupt and throw himself on the mercy 
of God. God will cancel the debt...Forgiveness 
is thus a free gift of God...It is at this 
point that we touch what is one of the most

remarkable points in the teaching of Jesus, and 
one which deserves much more attention than it 
commonly receives* This is the principle which 
may be briefly put: He who would be forgiven 
must himself forgive. 1 


God is seeking his children and suffering for them, but 

they have not understood this gift unless it has entered 

their relationships with their fellowmen. 

Jesus himself wept over Jerusalem and said,"How 

often would I have gathered thy children together, even as 

a hen gathereth her own brood under her wings, and ye 
2 

would not!", and again in Luke it said, "and when he drew 

nigh, he saw the city and wept over it" . One of the 

things that was said about Jesus himself was that, "this 

4 

man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them". 


Jesus* own actions set no limits to the people 
whom God lovos. He associated with tax collect¬ 
ors, nonreligious people, sinnersin respect to 
the will of God as revealed in the Bible. Jesus 
did this against the prudential wisdom of the 
religious leaders of his race. An enemy alien 
was the hero of the parable of the good neighbour. 
The father of the prodigal son added, a tenderness 
to the definition of God which it had not known 
before. Seven times a day was not enough for 
Jesus to forgive a man. Four hundred and ninety 
times a day was not enough, and he spoke for God. 4 


Jesus did associate with sinners, but always to make them 
understand the forgiving quality of God’s love, and in so 
doing he gave them new heart to live a life more in harmony

with his. Somehow forgiveness is the power unto a new 
life, and this assurance of God's forgiveness Jesus gave 
many * 


No problem is more crucial than to determine 
how, as men live in the modern world, 'sinful, 
and sad because sinful, and sorrowful in sinning', 
they can be sure that God pardons freely, accept¬ 
ing them at once and before they become any 
better as His reconciled children; and this in 
such a manner that they can face life with 
serenity, and can offer to all who have been 
defeated in the moral struggle the same dis~ 
tinct personal assurance of the Father's for¬ 
giving love. The brief answer to this question 
is that we acquire this certainty of fatherly 
pardon, and in the full sense acquire it only, 
in the presence of Jesus Christ. 1 


Lacchaeus became a changed man in the presence of Jesus 

Christ, and he said, "Behold, Lord, the half of my goods 

I give to the poor, and if I have wrongfully exacted ought 

of any man, I restore fourfold. And Jesus said unto him, 

2 

To-day is salvation come to this house" . Jesus forgave the 

3 

sins of the woman who anointed him , and he also forgave the 

4 

woman who had been taken in adultery . They were then to 
go in peace and sin no more. Jesus knew the power of for¬ 
giveness over a life, "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven 

for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same 
5 

loveth little" .

It is a simple psychological fact, I am 
persuaded that the only people in the world to¬ 
day who live in the glad consciousness that 
their sins have been forgiven are those who have 
encountered Jesus. They have met Him in the 
lives of the good; above all, they have stood 
face to face with Him as He shows Himself in 
the Gospels, and in His presence they have been 
able to trust the Father's mercy and begin life 
again...They now know that the essence of God’s 
nature is just such compassion as Christ’s. To 
look at Jesus is to know how God would have us 
think of Himself...As we contemplate Jesus 
presented in the Gospels, we discern not merely 
that God is love, but what kind of love this 
is...At the touch of penitence all doors fly 
open, and the child is at the Father’s breast. 1 


And the supreme example of God’s seeking and suffer¬ 
ing with His children was Christ’s offering of himself upon 
the cruel cross of Calvary. While we were yet sinners 
Christ died for us. It was a great love which could say 

as the angry mob was yelling curses at him, ’’Father, for- 

2 

give them; for they know not what they do”. 


It is that Jesus meets the natural hesitation 
of sinners to believe in God’s forgiveness, by 
His own attitude to them of loving friendliness 
and goodwill...He sought the company ofthe sin¬ 
ful habitually and with open eyes, and did so 
not for subtle reasons, or as an example to 
anyone, but because by nature He could do no 
otherwise, because It was the only possible out¬ 
come of His Intimacjr with the Father...He ex¬ 
pressly justified His intercourse with outcasts 
by pointing out that to act so is a reflection 
of God’s own mind...For Jesus to keep beside Him 
the stained and covetous doubtless was an ex¬ 
pression of love like to God’s, but also it meant 
such pain as we can barely understand, it is an

agony to see vileness eating into the life of 
those we love. Of this willingness to suffer 
in prolonged and faithful proximity to sinners 
the Cross is the last and highest manifestation. 1 


Jesus revealed the quality of the Father’s love, and 
that at least was new, whether the name "Father" was or 
not. 

For the love of God is broader 

Than the measure of man’s mind; 

And the heart of the Eternal 

Is most wonderfully kind. 2

CHAPTER VI 

THE KINGDOM OF GOD 

Many of Jesus' ideas about the last things were sim¬ 
ilar to the expectations of the other Jews, but a new 
element of urgency entered into the concept of the Kingdom 
with Jeuus, and there was even the idea that in Jesus the 
Kingdom was at hand, because "From that time began Jesus 

to preach, and to say, Repent ye; for the kingdom of 
1 

heaven is at hand*. 

in Jesus® day there were various apocalyptic concepts 
about, and Jesus was in agreement with so$e of these. He 
felt sure that God's rule must come in power someday, and 
he looked foreward to this with the others. Thus there 
was in his teaching the future glorious hope of the Jews, 
but because he felt himself to be the Messiah of God, he 
was a new element even in these hopes. He said: 

For the Son of man shall come in the glory 
of his Father with his angels; and then shall 
he render unto every man according to his deeds. 
Verily I say unto you, There are some of them 
that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of 
death, till they see the Son of man coming in 
his kingdom. 2 

Mark and Luke say, "till they see the kingdom of God". 

The idea of a future judgment was present in Jesus

as for example in the parable of the tares: 


As therefore the tares are gathered up 
and burned with fire; so shall it be in the 
end of the world. The Son of man shall send 
forth his angels, and they shall gather out of 
his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, 
and them that do iniquity, and shall cast them 
into the furnace of fire: there shall be the 
weeping and the gnashing of teeth. Then shall 
the righteous shine forth as the sun in the 
kingdom of their Father. 1 


That was the point of other stories of Jesus such as: 

2 3 

the drag net , the rich man and Lazarus , and the story 

4 

of the nations before the Son of man . Jesus said, "But 

I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the 

5 

land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee". The 

ultimate rule of God was to come some day, and the people 

should be ready, because they do not know the hour: "For 

as the lightning cometh forth from the east, and is seen 

even mnto the west; so shall be the coming of the Son of 
6 

man". The same idea was illustrated by the story of the five 

wise virgins with their lamps trimmed and ready and the 

five foolish virgins whose lamps were not ready after which 

Jesus said, "Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor 
7 

the hour". Also, but of that day or that hour, knoweth no

one, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but 
1 

the Father”* Jesus seemed to expect this consummation 
very soon, but it was not so realized. Albert Schweitzer 
was the one who emphasized this eschatological view in 
Jesus’ teaching. This was not a view unique with Jesus: 


In other words the belief in the nearness 
of the Day of the Lord is not one of the unique 
features in the eschatology of Jesus but a 
belief which, like the belief in demons or the 
Davidic authorship of the Psalter, was the com¬ 
mon property of his generation* 2 

The common world view among the Jews of 
Jesus 1 2 3 4 day was that human history was rushing 
to its conclusion, that this conclusion would 
be characterized by God’s intervening destruct¬ 
ion of the wicked and of the present order, 
and that God would establish a new order in 
which his will would be done on earth as it is 
in heaven. The results of the last generation 
of study make it seem probably that Jesus shared 
this faith and hope. 3 


But: 

The expectation that God would bring the 
present age to an end soon was not central in 
Jesus’ thinking. It was not the focus of his 
thought nor the foundation of his faith. It 
does not dominate his teaching. 4 


Yet the preaching of the kingdom of God did dom¬ 
inate Jesus’ teaching, and he stated that that was the 
reason for his coming into the world, "I must preach the

good tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities

also: for therefore was 1 sent"* Manson stressed the fact 
that the Kingdom was a personal relationship between the 
King and the subject, and that this idea was explicitly 
stated in Rabbinical passages, and also frequently implied 
in passages of the Old Testament. The individual Israelite 
makes the Sovereignty of God manifest in the world by ack¬ 
nowledging its obligations. But Jesus placed his whole 
emphasis upon this relationship, and to him the greatest 
thing was to do the will of God. He felt that the Kingdom 
of God was present in him and that it was something new. 

He had a new idea of the will of God. C. H. Dodd dealt 
at length with "realized eschatology" in the "Parables of 
the Kingdom". 

The final consummation to many before Jesus had meant 
doom, and to John the Baptist it also meant doom. For him 
it was also near at hand and it was judgment: 

Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you 
to flee from the wrath to come. 2 

He shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit 
and in fire: whose fan is in his hand, and he 
will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor; 
and he will gather his wheat into the garner, 
but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable 
fire. 5 


But Jesus felt that with him the Kingdom of God had become

a present reality, and the message he had for the people 
was of glad tidings. It was not doom, hut: 


The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, 

Because he anointed me to preach good tidings 
to the poor: 

He hath sent me to proclaim release to the 
captives, 

And recovering of sight to the blind, 

To set at liberty them that are bruised, 

To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord* 1 


And he said, "To-day hath this scripture been fulfilled in 
2 

your ears"* The Kingdom of G-od was NOW, because Jesus did 
the will of God, and the will of God was expressing His 
redeeming love on earth now. The Kingdom could not come 
completely until the end, but it could begin to come, if 
Jesus and those who understood his message let God reign 
in their hearts. To Jesus the present Kingdom was very 
important, because it was a quality of life for the pres¬ 
ent. His ethic was not an interim ethic, but one that was 
building the final Kingdom. Jesus certainly felt that with 
him something new was started, "Verily, I say unto you, 
Among them that are born of women there hath not arisen a 
greater than John the Baptist: yet he that is but little 
in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he", and "The law 

and the prophets were until John: from that time the gos- 

4 

pel of the kingdom of God is preached".

held that the Kingdom had come in some real sense during 

1 


his own ministry", and: 


When we turn to the teaching of Jesus we 
find that what he says about the sovereignty 
of God is remarkable not so much for novelty 
as for the intensity with which the sovereignty 
is felt as a doMnent factor in his life...His 
preaching of the Kingdom is not just the point¬ 
ing of his hearers to some happy state in the 
future, when the will of God will be perfectly 
realised; it is primarily the living of a life 
of complete loyalty to God and unquestioning 
obedience to his will here and now. The core 
of all that Jesus teaches about the Kingdom 
is the immediate apprehension and acceptance 
of God as King in his own life. From this 
central experience all the rest of the teach¬ 
ing on the Kingdom naturally follows. ? Thy 
Kingdom comes 1 2 3 4 may be paraphrased f Thy will be 
done on earth as it is in heaven 1 ...The essence 
of his preaching of the Kingdom is in the words 
r Thy will be done’: all the rest is commentary. 2 


Jesus regarded his work and the response to it as a small 

beginning of the Kingdom. He said, "Be mastered by this 

3 

willl Be ruled by this God!" and he meant "Nowl" And it 
was good news because God offers us the resources of His 
Kingdom here and now. Jesus said, "But if I by the Spirit 

of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come 

4 

upon you", and "And being asked by the Pharisees, when the 
kingdom of God cometh, he answered them and said, the king¬ 
dom of God cometh not with observation: neither shall they

say, Lo, herel or, There 1 for lo, the kingdom of God is 

1 

within you". 

The Kingdom was present bedause it was something into 

which you could, enter. The conditions for entry into the 

Kingdom were exacting, because they were "to do the will 

of God". Jesus said, "For I say unto you, that except 

your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the 

scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the 
2 

kingdom of heaven", and "Not every one that saith unto me, 

Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but 

3 

he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven", and 

"I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and the 

west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, 

in the kingdom of heaven: but the sons of the kingdom shall 

4 

be cast forth into the outer darkness", and "Verily I say 

unto you, Except ye turn, and become as little children, 

5 

ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven". It 

w$s impossible to enter into the kingdom, if we treasured ' 

anything above the will of God, "It is hard for a rich man 

6 

to enter into the kingdom of heaven". Mark and Luke ordin¬ 
arily used kingdom of God, where Matthew used kingdom of 
heaven. I believe they are equivalent here.

The Kingdom was also present, because it was likened 

unto things which gradually grew. It was likened unto a 

1 

grain of mustard seed which became a large shrub , and also 
2 

unto leaven. Those who were already of the Kingdom were 

to the world as leaven is to the dough. Also it was the 

most important thing in life to be doing the will of God, 

to be seeking first the Kingdom of heaven. Jesus said, 

"It is good for thee to enter into life (Mark has in one 

place Kingdom of God for life) maimed or halt, rather than 

having two hands or tw 7 o feet to be cast into the eternal 
3 4 

fire". The Kingdom is likened also to a hidden treasure, 

5 

and also to a pearl of great price. 

Jesus’ message, in life and teaching, was that the 
greatest thing in life was to do the Father T s will. This 
took Jesus to his cross, and his disciples to a long road 
of service to their fellowship. When this was going on, 
then the Kingdom of God was in their midst and, like the 
leaven, it was a real influence. Jesus brought in the King¬ 
dom, because it was one of serving your fellowmen and thus 
doing the will of God, rather than just keeping the whole 
law. Jesus’commission to the twelve he sent out was, "And 
as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast 

out demons: freely ye received, freely give”. Because 

he had already said to them, ’’Fear not, little flock; 

for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the 
2 

kingdom”. 

The Kingdom is really the reign of God over His people, 
eternal, present and future. In Jesus was seen a complete 
obedience to the will of God, which he saw as one of ser¬ 
vice and love for all. The Kingdom had come in him, a 
small beginning; yet,.the disciples were still to pray 
that God’s will should be done on earth, because in their 
own strength, the disciples could not do the will of God, 

But it was new with Jesus that men, although not in their 
own strength, could and had to help build the Kingdom, by 
allowing the Kingdom to reign in their hearts. To Jesus, 
the Kingdom, was not a programme far off, but it was the 
quality of life here and now. It meant hearts completely 
surrendered to God, 


The earthly life is the road to the eternal. 

By impressing this truth on men Jesus gave a 
new character to religion, and it dominates the 
Lord’s Prayer. Almost in one breath we are to 
pray for the Kingdom of God and for his help 
in living this single day. 3 

Let us repeat, the new thing, which Christ¬ 
ianity announced as its gospel was the fact that 
the Kingdom was at hand, was indeed already pres¬ 
ent ’in the midst’ of the disciples as a group, and 
that in Jesus the Christ had at last come, and was 
to come again, 4

CHAPTER VII 


THE MESSIAHSHIP 


The concept of a Messiah was not new with Jesus, 

When the Jewish hope of an earthly kingdom had waned, then 
the apocalyptic hopes had grown up and many of these had 
included the idea of a Messiah or Anointed One to save the 
people. Some looked for a military Messiah of the }.ine of 
David, and some for one who would come on the clouds of 
heaven and establish a heavenly kingdom: 

But we cannot say that the general concept¬ 
ion was novel with Jesus. So, once again, of 
his Messiahship. There had not been in ante¬ 
cedent Judaism any single consistent doctrine 
of the Messiah. There were various theories 
as to the Messiah f s nature and mission. Some 
held that he would appear before the end of 
the present age, to usher in the kingdom; others 
that he would come when this age had ended to 
rule over the new age* 1 


But Jesus had his own idea of the Messiah, from which he 
could not be shaken by temptation, and he put new meaning 
into an old concept once again* 


The fact with which we have to reckon at 
all times is that in the teaching of Jesus his 
conception of Cod determines everything, in¬ 
cluding the conceptions of the Kingdom and the 
Messiah. The Kingdom is where Cod’s will is 
done on earth as it is in heaven. But what is 
Cod’s will but the expression of God’s nature?

& Brothers Publishers), 1949, pp. 59 - 60.

The Messiah is the person who realises the King¬ 
dom by utter obedience to God’s will, by volun¬ 
tary identification of his will with God’s. The 
Kingdom on earth manifests itself as the society 
of all those who follow the Messiah and take upon 
themselves the yoke which he bears. In this 
sense the Messiah is the firstborn of many breth¬ 
ren and the founder (or pioneer) and perfecter 
of faith, it is this conception of Messiahship 
for which Jesus used the enigmatic term ’the 
Son of Man’• 1 


One of the questions, which has occupied the minds of 
men, has been whether tlesus himself was conscious of his 
Messiahship and whether he put the new content into the 
concept or whether this whole idea sprang from the Early 
Uhureh. l prefer to go with those who believe that Jesus 
did have a messianic consciousness. Manson felt that it 
depended on Jesus’ religious experience, but however the 
consciousness came to Jesus, he did feel his messianic 
mission® 


The modern denial of messianic consciousness 
has stemmed from two able scholars: Guignebert 
and Bultm&nn. On the other hand Goguel and i)ib- 
elius who are just as able have come to the op¬ 
posite conclusions. C. T. Craig is unquestion¬ 
ably correct when he says, ’I believe that in 
each case the form of religious faith held by 
the scholar was contributory to the decision 
made’. Craig’s own testimony in summing up a 
fine study is: ’It seems to me that the evid¬ 
ence points to the fact that it was not the 
early Christians who first believed that the 
person of Jesus was central in God’s deliverance.

It is a belief which goes back in some form to 
the Master himself• 


1 


When we take this latter view we are in good company 
with C, J. uadoux, Goguel, Hlausner and Filson. We believe 
that Jesus himself used the term "Son of Man", and 

The designation ’Son of Man* is unquestion¬ 
ably Messianic as Rudolph Otto has shown con¬ 
clusively m ms monumental work 'The Kingdom of 
God and the Son of Man T . He is joined in this 
position by George Foote Moore, Dalman, Goguel, 
and T.W. Manson« 2 

Thus we accept the passages of messianic portent as 
authentically from Jesus, He felt himself to be the 
Messiah of God, the Son <bf God, the Son of Man, because of 
a special relationship with God, Perhaps it was a growing 
consciousness, but it was felt by Mark that the bapt'sm ex¬ 
perience was when Jesus really became conscious ofhis mission, 
and his unique relationship to the Father. Straton felt 
that: 


It was not the resurrection that caused 
the disciples to believe that Jesus was the 
Messiah but it was an amazing confirmation of 
a previous conviction. The disciples 1 2 could 
scarcely have believed that Jesus foas Messiah 
after the resurrection unless they had already 
believed it, in some sense, before that event-- 
the resurrection came as a divine confirmation 
of this belief 2 5 

Jesus did not envisage himself as a political Messiah, 

4 

"My kingship is not of this world". This was obvious also

from part of the temptation narrative: 


Again, the devil taketh him unto an exceed¬ 
ing high mountain, and showeth him all the king¬ 
doms of the world, and the glory of them; and 
he said unto him, All these things will I give 
thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. 

Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: 
for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord 
thy God, and him only shalt thou serve, 1 


And he did speak about the Messiah coming in glory. That 

was a part of his Jewish heritage which he seemed to accept 

for himself. Later he was to come in glory. This might 

perhaps have been the hope of the Early Church entering in, 

we cannot be sure. At his trial Jasus was supposed to have 

said, "Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at 

the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven 

The last clause was omitted from Luke, but in another place, 

he has, "Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he 

3 

find faith on the earth"? 

But Jesus ! concept of the Messiah was far different 
from that of his contemporaries or his forerunners. He 
felt himself to be the Messiah then, and not a glorious 
Messiah, but a suffering servant sent to redeem God’s people 
Second Isaiah had felt that Israel should redeem the other 
nations through suffering, but Jesus felt that this was the 
Mission for the Messiah, God’s Anointed:

The new element that Jesus added to the 
Messianic concept - and an element which likely 
grew in his own consciousness as he was frust¬ 
rated in not having his message of the Kingdom 
accepted by the religious leaders - is that of 
the Suffering Messiah. "He believed that he 
was the Messiah because he had to suffer. This 
is the great paradox, the great originality of 
his gospel". That this is a part of the orig¬ 
inal tradition is beyond doubt. No Jew in his 
day had ever heard of a messiah who would have 
to suffer;consequently this view could not have 
been applied to Jesus from the outside. This 
concept of the Suffering Messiah was completely 
new and to it was added the idea of redemption. 1 


Jesus felt that only God or His Anointed could forgive and 

therefore the following is proof that he felt himself to 

be the Messiah: "But that ye may know that the Son of man 

hath authority on earth to forgive sins (then saith he to 

the sick of the palsy), Arise, and take up thy bed, and go 

unto thy house". And he felt his programme to be one of 

redemption. He said to the Pharisees who were accusing 

him of eating with sinners and publicans,"They that are 

whole have no need of a physician, but they that are 

3 

sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners". 

Jesus explained his mission as the Messiah, both when he 

4 

stood up and read in the synagogue , (already quoted in 
this thesis), and when he answered John the Baptist’s query: 


And Jesus answered and said unto them, Go 
and tell John the things which ye hear and see: 
the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk,

the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, 
and the dead are raised up, and the poor have 
good tidings preached to them. And blessed is 
he, whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbl¬ 
ing in me. 1 

After the story of Zacchaeus, we read, "For the Son of 

2 

man came to seek and to save that which was lost". 

And he felt that the redemption was to come through 

service and suffering. He said, "I am in the midst of you 

3 

as he that serveth", and also, "even as the Son of man 

came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to 

4 

give his life a ransom for many"® Every once in a while 

he tried to teach his disciples that he had to suffer, and 

also that they would have to suffer, because only suffering 

is really redemptive. After Peter’s confession it was said, 

"From that time began Jesus to show unto his disciples, 

that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of 

the elders and chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, 

5 

and the third day be raised up". In Matthew and Luke it 

is the "Son fat man" instead of he. And again, "Jesus said 

unto them, The Son of man shall be delivered up into the 

hands of men; and they shall kill him, and the third day 

6 

he shall be raised up". Very, much the same idea was con-

Again he said, ♦♦that this

tained in another passage . 

which is written must be fulfilled in me, and he was 

2 

reckoned with transgressors”. And in Matthew and Mark, 

it was recorded that he spoke of his death as the "blood 

3 

of the covenant, which is poured out for many". The story 

4 

of the vineyard and the husbandmen was to illustrate that 
he must die. 

Thus Jesus added the new element of redemptive service 

and vicarious suffering to the Messiah concept. As Sperry 

said, "The identification of the Messiah with the Suffering 

Servant of the Lord, as portrayed in Isaiah 53, was no part 

5 

of the Jewish Messianic hope". 

One cross was for our master; Him we shall 
never forget; 

For he gently poured His Father’s love, on 
everyone He met. 

He healed the sick, made blind eyes see, 
helped the faint heart beat; 

Mercy, truth and judgment were the path¬ 
ways of his feet. 

He robbed no man; he helped the weak; made 
the dark hours bright, 

For Him a cross upon the hill led on to 

realms of light. 6

CHAPTER VIII 

THE FELLOWSHIP OF BELIEVERS 
From the time of the deliverance from the Red Sea, 
the lews had felt they were the chosen people of God* 

But when many of the people turned from God to other gods, 
then only a remnant were faithful. And so the group of 
the faithful was now by the choice of the individual, not 
by accident of birth only. Isaiah conceived this ideal 
Israel to be the "ServantEzekiel conceived of a rem¬ 
nant to enjoy salvation, whatever might happen to the rest 
of the world. This became the dominant note in Judaism 
after the Exile. Those who should keep the whole law were 
to enjoy salvation. They were the faithful remnant. 

But Jesus had a different idea of the remnant. He 
himself fulfilled the prophecy of the "Servant", and was 
therefore the faithful remnant. And he called others to 
share his mission, and they would also be the faithful 
remnant, "The true Israel or people of God are those who, 

under Christ’s rule, are engaged in the warfare for the 

1 

consummation of the Kingdom". Jesus chose disciples, and 
later others were gathered in, and they were the true 
Israel, the Church of Jesus Christ. In other words the 
fellowship of believers was really a continuation of the

idea of the people of God, yet there was something new 
about this too# It was those who did the will of the God, 
revealed in Jesus Christ, who were the true Israel, the 
true church of God. They were to be the continuation of 
the remnant idea seen in Jesus. Those who accepted Jesus 
as the Messiah, and his idea of the Kingdom and will of 
God made up the fellowship of believers. Those who were 
willing to accept his ideal of service and suffering were 
the fellowship. They were the present manifestation of 
the Kingdom upon the earth# 


Again and again it is impressed upon them 
that discipleship is synonymous with sacrifice 
and suffering and the cross itself. This at 
once suggests that what was in the mind of Jesus 
was that he and his followers together should 
share that destiny which he describes as the 
Passion of the Son of Man: that he and they 
together should be the Son of Man, the Remnant 
that saves by service and self-sacrifice, the 
organ of God’s redemptive purpose in the world. 1 


Paul called it the "Body of Christ", and felt it was 
suffering with Christ* 


Jesus proclaims the Kingdom of God, he 
states the demands it makes, he declares the 
glories it promises. He calls men to receive 
it, to enter into it. He sets out to create 
in Israel that Son of Man. But not many can 
be found to go with him any part of the way, 
and none to follow him to the end. The last 
part of the way he travels alone: and at the 
cross he alone is the Son of Man the Incarn¬ 
ation of the Kingdom of God on earth. The

Son of Man is rejected and slain. That ought 
to be the end of the story; but it is not. The 
sufferings and death of Jesus are the birth- 
pangs of the Son of Man. The cross proves to 
be the key that opens the Kingdom of God to men. 

The death of Jesus accomplishes what his teach¬ 
ing could not. Within a few years we find 
Paul living, suffering, and rejoicing in Christ. 

By dying, Jesus has brought the Son of Man 
into existence, given to that dream-figure 
a body, a local habitation, and a name. It 
is the Church, his own body, of which he is 
the head. 1 


Thus the fellowship of believers are to share with Christ 

his task, and to attempt to finish it for him, just as the 

twelve, who were the beginning of the fellowship, were to 

do. "And he saith unto them, Come ye after me, and I will 

make you fishers of men". They were to be "the salt of the 
3 4 

earth", and "the light of the world". And Jesus said to 

them, "Blessed are ye when men shall reproach you, and per¬

heaven, and he sent them out with the same programme of 
service as that which he had laid out for himself, "And as 
ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

and to heal the sick"• Jesus seemed to equate the mes¬ 
sage of this little band, with that of himself and God, for 

he said, "He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that 

1 

receiveth me receiveth him. that sent me"# 

The fellowship was to be the living message of service, 
of sacrifice and of the redeeming love of God on the earth, 
as Jesus had been when he was here. It was a demanding 
fellowship: 


Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any 
man would come after me, let him deny himself, 
and take up his cross, and follow me. For 
whosoever would save his life shall lose it: 
and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake 
shall find it. 2 

And there came a scribe, and said unto 
him, Teacher, I will follow thee whithersoever 
thou goest, And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes 
have holes, and the birds of the heaven have 
nests; but the Son of Man hath not where to lay 
his head. And another of the disciples said 
unto hi$, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury 
my father. But Jesus saith unto him, Follow 
me; and leave the dead to bury their own dead. 3 
Luke has also - but go thou and publish abroad 
the kingdom of God. 

And another also said, I will follow thee, 
Lord; but first suffer me to bid farewell to 
them that are at my house. But Jesus said unto 
him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and 
looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. 4 

He that loveth father or mother more than me 
is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or 
daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And 
he that doth not take his cross and follow me, is 
not worthy of me.

Jesus told the rich young ruler to sell all that he had 

1 

and give it to the poor, and follow him . 

They were to serve as the Son of Man had served: 


But Jesus called them unto him, and said, 

Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it 
over them, and their great ones exercise authority 
over them. Not so shall it be among you: but who¬ 
soever would become great among you shall be your 
minister; and whosoever would be first among you 
shall be your servant: even as the Son of man came 
not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and 
to give his life a ransom for many. 2 


When disputes about greatness arose Jesus said, "But he 

3 

that is greatest among you shall be your servant", and 

"whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled; and who- 

4 

soever shall humble himself shall be exalted". Jesus 

demanded that they should take his yoke upon them and learn 

of him, and that they should drink the cup he had to drink, 

5 

and be baptized with his baptism of suffering • After 
Peter’s confession he spent much time trying to make plain 
to the disciples their role, as the New Israel, the people 
of God, those living under the will of God, which he had 
been teaching them. Manson expressed this as follows: 


We should now expect that what Jesus has 
to say in his preaching of the Kingdom will be 
directed towards producing in them those qualities

of loyalty, trust, and obedience which he him¬ 
self manifests towards God. And this is the 
case. The great issue of life is represented 
as the choice between God and some other ruler 
of one’s life. ’No man can serve two masters: 

Ye cannot serve God and mammon’. The first 
essential of discipleship is to say ’No’ to 
self, that is, to every private and personal 
interest that might interfere with one’s com¬ 
plete devotion to the Kingdom...The second 
element in the conception of man’s right 
attitude to God as King is trust...They are to 
fear nobody save God: and him they are to learn 
to trust...(and thirdly) The mark of kinship 
to Jesus is the doing of God’s will* 1 

To the period after Peter’s Confession 
belongs the enunciation of the three great 
paradoxes of the Kingdom: He who would save 
his.life shall lose it, and he who loses his 
life shall save it. The last shall be first, 
and the first last. He who would be chief in 
the community must be the servant of all. 2 


This New Israel was to be permeated by the spirit of 

Jesus, and they were to be his representatives in the world, 

as Paul says his ’’Body”. They were to be his little band, 

the fellowship of believers in him and in all he stood for. 

As Newton Plew said, ’’Though the Rule of God is not a 

3 

community, it implies the gathering of a community”. Bow¬ 
man in his ’’Intention of Jesus” stated that what was so 
original in Jesus lay in his combination of the ’’Suffering 
Servant” and the ideal community. 

Jesus was the Messiah, and His followers 
shared in the salvation which He brought, shared

in His earthly vicissitudes, and shared in the 
hope of the high calling which was theirs in 
Him. This is no mere imitatio Christ!. This 
is a complete and absolute dedication of all 
life to One who is bringing the fulfilment of 
the final purpose of God for human life. It 
involves entrance into a new fellowship and a 
new community. 1 


We have now seen what Jesus’ unique personal relation¬ 
ship to God caused him to add to the main religious con¬ 
cepts of the Jews, and wherein Jesus was religiously un¬ 
paralleled. It is well for us now to see how this ex¬ 
perience made his ethic, or better, principles for living, 
also original.

CHAPTER IX 

HUMILITY IN JESUS 1 ETHICS 

Before we deal with some of Jesus’ ethical teaching, 
we should make it clear that Jesus was not mainly an ethical 
teacher. Jesus dealt in an original way with everything he 
touched, and his etnic was novel, because it flowed from a 
unique religious experience. Jesus’ special relationship 
with his Father shaped his religious conceptions and made 
him discriminate where the Jews did not, and exactly the 
same thing happened ethically. Jesus was unique ethically 
because of his discrimination, and also because his ethic 
was directly the result of his close communion with God. 

Cdve quoted Klausner as saying that Jesus "set up nothing 
but an etnico-religious system bound up with his conception 
of the Godhead”, and also, something we consider an advant¬ 
age and he considered a disadvantage, that "his ethical 

teaching was not lost in a sea of legal prescriptions and 

1 

items of secular information" . Jesus did not give us an 
ethic, but rather some laws of the spiritual realm, which 
he understood because he knew God so well. To Jesus there 
were laws of the spiritual realm written into the very 
nature of things, which like the laws of nature are not 
broken but break you, if they are not obeyed. They are a

result of the very nature of God Himself. Grant stated 
this well: "On the contrary, they are grounded in the very 
nature of things, which is - as Augustine said - the expres 
sion of the will of God. The ethics of the Gospel find 
their sanction upon no lower level than the eternal purpose 

of God, which, so the Hible conceives it, reflects the very 

1 

nature of God". Sometimes Jesus applied these large prin¬ 
ciples to individual cases, but more often he just gave us 
these guideposts for living, and he certainly did not give, 
like the Jews, a whole set of rules for every part of life. 
It was the will of God which counted in every situation. 
Jesus said, "For whosoever shall do the will of my Father 
who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother" 
Thy will be done is the main petition in the Lord’s prayer, 

and in the garden Jesus prayed, "not my will, but thine, be 
3 

done". This very fact made his teaching on morality often 
very novel in comparison with the Jewish ethic even though 
Klausner felt that there was nothing new in Jesus’ ethical 
teaching. This thesis maintains that there was. Jesus re¬ 
vealed the will of God, and it was more demanding than the 
Jewish ethic. The best in the ethic of the prophets and 
the psalmists foreshadowed Jesus. "For thou desirest not 
sacrifice; else would 1 give it: thou delightest not

in burnt offering. The sacrifices of God are a broken 

spirit: a broken and contrite heart, 0 God, thou wilt not 
1 

despise"o "He hath showed thee, 0 man, what is good; and 

what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and 

2 

to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" As Maneon 
said, "the moral teaching of Jesus is nart and parcel of 

3 

his religion and is not separable from it except by violence," 
and: 


For all the moral precepts of Jesus, in the 
last resort, flow from a single principle which 
is not itself moral but religious; and the under¬ 
standing of any part of the ethical teaching 
demands a grasp of the whole religious context 
in which it has its place. In other words, the 
ideal picture of human life which Jesus draws 
in what he has to say about morals is a picture 
of life in the Kingdom of God on earth, life 
as it may be lived by men who acknowledge one 
supreme loyalty, in whose hearts one supreme 
passion burns; and it is only as we hear the 
call to that loyalty and feel that passion that 
the moral teaching of Jesus grows luminous® 4® 

Jesus said, "Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly 
5 

Father is perfect"® Nothing could be more demanding than 
that® Although Luke made it "merciful" rather than "perfect", 
to him to be merciful as God was is to be perfect. 

Jesus realized that only attitude for us, as erring 
men and women, before God and our fellows was humility,. He

realized it, as the Jewish teachers, who kept the minutiae 
of the law and thought they did all that was required, did 
not. Colwell has a very good chapter on the humility in 
Jesus* teaching. 

Pride is the vice and humility is the virtue 
throughout much of Jesus* teaching. In the Bea¬ 
titudes which open the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus 
awards God*s blessing to the poor in spirit, to 
the mourners, to the meek, to the peacemakers. 

Ihen he discusses religious observances, the 
point which he emphasizes is that people who go 
to church to be seen have received the only re¬ 
ward they will get, but that true worship is 
not ostentatious. 1 

Jesus condemned this ostentatiousness in everyone, but es¬ 
pecially in the Pharisees, because they were self-righteous 

in their religion. It was evident from the story of the 

2 

Pharisee and the Publican . He said, **all their works they 

do to be seen of men**, and for this purpose they wore long 

robes, they liked the best seats at everything, and to be 
3 

called "Rabbi** ♦ He chastised them greatly for their 
hypocrisy: 


Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, 
hypocritesl for ye cleanse the outside of the 
cup and of the platter, but within they are 
full from extortion and excess...for ye are 
like unto whited sepulchres, which outwardly 
appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of 
dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness. Even 
so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto 
men, but inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy 
and iniquity. 4

in his teaching, Jesus told people to do their praying, 

1 

their fasting, and their charity in private . 

Jesus* himself was very humble. As we said before, 

he associated with all kinds and conditions of men. And 

he would not allow the people to call him good, for he 

2 

said no one was good but God . When the woman praised the 

one wno bore him, he said, * # Yea rather, blessed are they 

3 

that hear the word of God, and keep it n . He went out 

4 

into the hills alone to pray * 

What the legends of the temptation say in 
effect is that Jesus decided that God was not 
to be manifested in power, in miracle, and in 
glory. This is a reverse way of saying that, 
if the career of Jesus ?/as a revelation of God, 
it was a revelation of humility, a revelation 
that did not emphasize pov/er, either earthly 
or supernatural. 5 

The parable of the mustard seed and the leaven showed that 

Jesus regarded his work as a humble beginning, from which 

something great would grow. Colwell believed that the 

reason we have so much trouble knowing what Jesus thought 

of himself was because he was too humble to bother about 

declaring himself, and too busy proclaiming the will of 

God. Jesus thought little of himself because he thought 

much of God. 

And Jesus advised his disciples of the three para¬ 
doxes of the Kingdom which have been quoted before, but

which bear repeating: "He who would save his life shall 
lose it, and he who loses his life shall save it. The 

last shall be first, and the first last. He who would be 

1 

chief in the community must be the servant of all"* When 

they began to reason together about who should be greatest, 

Jesus took a child and told them that they must become as 

little children to enter the Kingdom, "for he that is least 

2 

among you all, the same is great"* He told them to take 

the lowest seat at a marriage feast, "For everyone that 

exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth 

3 

himself shall be exalted"* Jesus was opposed to pride 
because it separated man from God, and man from man* One 
completely lost in service and devotion to God would have 
no time for pride* 

What I have been trying to say is that Jesus 
saw in God a love that knows no frontiers, that 
is a little careless of ethics - sending its 
rain on evil and good alike. Jesus realized that 
this love creates that humility which alone makes 
possible the service of man. Love that knows no 
frontiers is possible only to the humble. 4 

Jesus put an unparalleled stress on humility.

CHAPTER X 

THE WAY HE DEALT WITH THE LAW 


One way in which Jesus was unique ethically was the 
way in which he health with the Law. Moore claimed, that 
Jesus accepted all the Jewish Law, hut he certainly did 
not accept it in the way the Jews did. They accepted every 
rule as of equal importance and as from God, to he kept with 
the same faithfulness. Mot so Jesus. He emphasized what 
was important in the Law, what God really did want kept with 
faithfulness, and he even contradicted the Law in places, 
and set something of his own over against it. But he did 
not really make less demand upon the people, it was merely 
a different kind of demand and harder: 

The motto for any son of the kingdom, as 
for Jesus himself, is: ’Not what I will hut what 
thou wilt•’ What is required is something which 
goes heyond the prescriptions of the torah and 
tradition: ’Unless your righteousness exceed the 
righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees ye 
shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.’ 

’When you shall perform all thingsthat are com¬ 
manded you, say : We are unprofitable servants, 
we have done (only) what we were bound to do.’ 

It is clear from these passages and many others 
of similar import, that Jesus set up a standard 
of obedience to God every whit as rigorous as the 
most rigorous exposition of the Law. ... What 
Jesus is concerned about is not the decision of 
particular legal problems, but the disposition 
of man’s will towards God: and here he demands 
the complete subjection of th© whole man to 
God’s will* 1

Here we have to do with a difference of 
method in dealing with moral problems. The 
scribal method of definitions of terms and ded¬ 
uction from already established rules and dec¬ 
isions could not but compare unfavourably with 
Jesus’ way of piercing by prophetic insight to 
the heart of any moral problem. 1 

Sperry felt that the originality of Jesus was most 

manifest in his handling of the maw. The Jews had the 

moral Law and the ceremonial Law, wnich were the written 

Law, and they also had the unwritten Law. Every bit of 

this was held to be uniformly binding. But Jesus, in true 

prophetic spirit made the moral Law the important one. And: 

Jesus did not hesitate to criticize the 
limitations of scribal and Pharisaic interpret¬ 
ation of the nav;; and he even went beyond 
criticism of their interpretation to criticism 
of the Law itself, as in his solution of the 
conflict between the permission of divorce and 
the intention of the Creator revealed in the 
earlier passage in Genesis (Mark 10: 5 - 9). 

The principle is sound: law must be interpreted 
in the light of its own clear intention, of 
the lawgiver’s purpose, expressed or implied. 

In this case the intention of the divine law¬ 
giver is clearly expressed. The later permis¬ 
sion of divorce (by Moses, vs. 5) can there¬ 
fore be viewed only as a concession, a modific¬ 
ation in the actual enforcement of the law; 
and this meant an evaluation, a criticism, of 
the Deuteronomic code as contrasted with the 
first book of Torah, Genesis. It is clear then 
that, as Knopf, Branscomb, and others have said, 

Jesus went beyond criticism of the current oral 
interpretation of the Law to criticize the Law 
itself* 2 

Jesus expected goodness to spring from a changed heart, a 

heart in harmony with the will of God, instead of expecting 

a lot of rules to be fulfilled by an unchanged man. The Law

was too narrow for him; what he wanted was new conduct in a 
new life. Jesus said, "Not that which entereth into the 


mouth defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of 


1 

the mouth, this defileth the man," and, 
good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but 
bringeth forth evil fruit...The good man 


"Even so every 
the corrupt tree 
out of his good 


treasure bringeth forth good things: and the evil man out 

2 

of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things". 

What Jesus offers in his ethical teaching 
is not a set of rules of conduct, but a number 
of illustrations of the way in which a trans¬ 
formed character will express itself in con¬ 
duct...The question of the interpretation of 
the commandment f Thou shalt love thy neighbour 
as thyself’ arises. The lawyer desires a 
definition of’neighbour. Jesus replies with 
the parable of the Good Samaritan: and by the 
time the parable is finished, he has brought 
the matter round from a discussion of the mean¬ 
ing of ’neighbour’ to a concrete example of 
1 neighbourliness’. The lawyer’s question is 
never answered, in place of a rule of conduct 
to obey he is given a type of character to 
imitate. This is typical of the method of Jesus 
in dealing with moral questions. He refuses to 
legislate because he is concerned with the springs 
of conduct rather than with the outv/ard acts. 3 


And Jesus was concerned with changing and transforming 

people, and therefore associated with the tax collectors 
4 

and sinners . He was not bound by the Jewish Law; he 

wished to make effective the law of God. He forgave the 

5 

sins of the woman who had sinned because she loved much.

He picked out as one of the essentials that we must be 
forgiving to be forgiven, when we are in an unforgiving 

spirit, we are unable to appropriate the forgiveness of 

1 

God , and it must be even unto seventy times seven or a 

2 

very great number of times • To Jesus, the two greatest 

commandments were as the lawyer said, "Thou shalt love the 

Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, 

and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy 

3 

neighbour as thyself"* And although the Jewish Rabbis 
counted all the law as of the same value, Jesus meant that 
these two were prior. They actually took precedence over 
the others* 

In this way Jesus certainly did discriminate and 

choose the important things in the Law. And he could do 

so because of certain essential principles which were part 

of his belief. One of these was, "Every kingdom divided 

against itself is brought to desolation; and every city 

4 

or house divided against itself shall not stand". There¬ 
fore, "no man can serve two masters: for either he will 
hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to 

one, and despise the other . le cannot serve God and 
5 

mammon#" If our desires conflict with the will of God,

we cannot allow ourselves to rule, and at the same time 
really serve God. Jesus recognized tnis forcibly, from 
his understanding of the essentials he chose from the Law 
what God really desired of his people. Another principle 

was, "he that is faithful in a very little is faithful 

1 

also in much"* Jesus accused the Pharisees of wilfully chang¬ 
ing the spirit of the Law because of their tradition. They 
could see the essentials, but in their own interest they 
simply would not do so: 

And he said unto them, Well did Isaiah pro¬ 
phesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, This 
people honoreth me with their lips, But their 
heart is far from me. But in vain do they wor¬ 
ship me, Teaching as their doctrines the pre¬ 
cepts of men. Ye leave the commandment of God, 
and hold fast to the tradition of men. And he 
said unto them, full well do ye reject the 
commandment of God, that ye may keep your 
tradition, for Moses said, Honor thy father 
and thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil of 
father or mother, let him die that death: but 
ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his 
mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been 
profited by me is Corban, that is to say, Given 
to God; ye no longer suffer him to do aught 
for his father or his mother; making void the 
word of God by your tradition, which ye have 
delivered: and many such like things ye do. 2 

And Jesus changed the ^aw where he saw fit with his 

"But I say unto you". In dealing with their sabbath laws, 

he made his own judgment on what was all right to do. "One 

3 

greater than the temple" was here. "For the Son of Man

is lord of the sabbath” • for him, it was not unlawful 

for the disciples to pluck grain on the sabbath, if they 

were hungry. David did the very same thing, when he ate 
2 

the showbread. Jesus himself healed on the sabbath, and 
this was unlawful, to the Jews, unless it were a matter 
of life or death. He healed the man with the withered hand, 
because it was lawful to do good on the Sabbath rather than 

3 

harm and he knew they, in their hearts, were plotting harm . 
This was also the point of the following story: 

And the ruler of the synagogue, being moved 
with indignation because Jesus had healed on the 
sabbath, answered and said to the multitude, 
fhere are six days in which men aught to work: 
in them therefore come and be healed, and not 
on the day of the sabbath. Hut the Lord ans¬ 
wered him, and said, le hypocrites, doth not 
each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or 
his ass from the stall, and lead him away to 
watering? And ought not this woman being a 
daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound, lo, 
these eighteen years, to have been loosed from 
this bond on the day of the sabbath? 4 

Jesus disagreed also with their laws on adultery and 
divorce. There should really have been no bills of divorce¬ 
ment, because male ana female should stay together till 

carted by death. Divorce was merely a concession by Moses 

5 

because they were not living up to God's high principle. 

"And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, 
except for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth 
adultery:and he that marrieth her when she is put away com-

mitteth adultery” . Mark and Luke did not have, “except 

for fornication”, "What therefore God hath joined together, 

2 

let no man put asunder" . in this, Jesus was far more 

demanding than the Jews, as he was in his estimate of sins 

of the flesh. "Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt 

not commit adultery: but l say unto you, that every one 

that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed 

3 

adultery with her already in his heart" * Jesus felt that 
men should be able to be trusted to tell the truth; so he 
said: 


Again, ye have heard that it was said to 
them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thy¬ 
self, but shalt perform unto the Lord thins 
oaths: but i say unto you, Swear not at all; 
neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of 
God; nor by the earth, for it is the footstool 
of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the 
city of the great Ling, neither shalt thou 
swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one 
hair white or black. Hut let your speech be, 

Yea, lea; Lay, Lay: and whatsoever is more than 
these is of the evil one* 4 

Jesus was continually at variance with the religious 

leaders of his day, and we have one record of his becoming 

rather violent about their profaning of the law of God. He cleansed 

5 

the temple of the money-changers during the Passion Week . 

Jesus was original both in the way he chose from the 
Law the important factors, and also in the way he overrode

the Law at many points. Jesus dealt uniquely with the 
Jewish Law^ 

The ethical or moral teaching of Jesus 
was not a conventional morality then, nor is 
it now. Jesus preached to a very moral people 
and a very religious people, yet he was not 
satisfied with tneir morality and faith, con¬ 
formity to a conventional pattern of behavior 
was not enough for him. 1

CHAPTER XI 


THE UNIQUE DEMAND OF JESUS 

As well as dealing with the Law in his own way, Jesus 
made far more stringent demands upon the disciples, than 
the Jewish Law did. Even Montefiore admitted this: 

As has been said by a Jewish scholar, 

"Jesus teaches an excess in virtue, an excess 
in forbearance, an excess in gentleness, an 
excess in giving and yielding. He does - and 
here there is originality - very often oppose 
the principle of measure for measure, and it 
is against this principle that he is speaking 
here. Virtue, the full virtue of a disciple, 
is an excess, a full devotion, an overflowing 
measure”. 1 

Jesus’ demands were unicue because he knew the seeking 
nature of the love of God, and his disciples because they 
were called to form the Boc$r of Christ, must be filled with 
this self-giving spirit in all their relationships. They 
were to reveal to the world this spirit of love, this sur¬ 
plus of Christianity. Jesus demanded ethics, but he demanded 
something far more, the love of God, as he himself had re¬ 
vealed it. This extra was what made possible the entering 
of the Kingdom. And this Is what is so difficult for human 
nature, and only possible as a result of the realization of 
God’s great self-giving love for us. As Matthew said, "What 
do ye more?” When we realize the conditions of Jesus’ day, 
and how the Jews had such a supressed hatred for the Romans,

we marvel all the more at Jesus’ demands. He was not a 
product of his day, but of the love of God. He really 
meant that our actions must be determined by God’s spirit, 
and not by others’ treatment of us. His call to love in 
spite of everything was certainly seen on the cross, as he 
forgave those who had put him there. The plus of Christ- 
ianity stemmed from the fact that God had first claim on 
lives, and they were to love God with all their heart, and 
their neighbour as well: 

But the discovery of God as father carries 
along with it the discovery of neighbours as 
brethren. The experience of God’s love brings 
with it the knowledge that that love is for all 
men. In the light of God’s love to himself a 
man sees other men, as it were, through God’s 
eyes: and to see them in this way is to love 
them. The kind of love that is meant here is 
not to be watered down to a mere general ben¬ 
evolence .. .It is something more than acts of 
kindness, for it is the root from which they 
spring. It is a new relation towards men, 
created by a new relation to God* 1 

Men were to follow Jesus to the utmost of losing their lives 

to find real life. 

Some have suggested that the positive golden rule was 
original with Jesus. It was not, but that is of no account, 
because it was not even like Jesus’ characteristic teaching: 

Jesus’ teaching proclaims in extreme and 
radical form the nature of God and God’s will 
for men. This will of God requires love for 
enemies - even for personal enemies - prayers 
for oppressors, and unasked service to the 
exploiter. And the motivation is the believer’s 
relation to God: ’’These things”, said Jesus

"You must do if you are to be the children of 
God". 1 

You do not truly love God, unless you love your brother: 

But I say unto you, that every one who is 
angry with his brother shall be in danger of 
the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his 
brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; 
and whosoever shall say, Thou foo]-, shall be in 
danger of the hell of fire. If therefore thou 
art offering thy gift at the altar, and there 
rememberest that thy brother hath aught against 
thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, 
and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy 
brother, and then come and offer thy gift. 2 

The following were some of the demands of Jesus: 

Resist not him that is evil: but whosoever 
smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him 
#he other also. And if any man would go to 
law with thee, and take away thy coat, let him 
have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel 
thee to go one mile, go with him two. Give to 
him that asketh thee, and from him that would 
borrow of thee turn not thou away. 3 

Love your enemies, and pray for them, that 
persecute you. 4 

Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your 
heavenly Father is perfect. 5 

But when thou makest a feast, bid the 
poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: and 
thou shalt be blessed; because they have not 
wherewith to recompense thee: for thou shalt 
be recompensed in the resurrection of the just. 6 

Jesus praised the poor widow for her small contribution, 

because she gave all that she had. That was the demand of

Jesus upon all those who followed* 

Jesus knew that there was a higher Kind of goodness 

than justice, and that this was love. This love forgave 

and also redeemed, in Jesus' life, we saw this demand lived 

out, and also in his cross. And this was what Jesus asked 

of those who dared to follow him. As oadbury felt, the 

plus sign and the cross of Christianity look very much 

alike, cave said, "The impulse to Christian character 

comes from what He was, as much as from what He taught and 

1 

what He was reveals what we must strive to he"*

CONCLUSION

CONCLUSION 


As a result of this study, it is maintained that 
Jesus was unique. The novelty was seen from his life, 
teaching, death and resurrection, it showed itself in 
his religious concepts and his ethical principles. 

Jesus was partly a product of his environment, but 
all jews were not Jesus, he used his heritage in his own 
unparalleled fashion, choosing from it the very best, and, 
with this and the new elements which he added, building a 
new structure. 

His conception of the nature of God as a love which 
seeks and suffers with and for his children was new to 
the Jews, except to a very limited extent. They at least 
did not ever put the main stress upon this and he did. 

His other original religious conceptions were: the king¬ 
dom of God as a present reality in himself and in those 
who accepted his Idea of the kingdom, which was that of 
suffering service for others in accord with the will and 
nature of God; the Messiahship as that of the redeeming, 
Suffering Servant; and the *New Israel" as those who to¬ 
gether make up the kingdom of the Suffering Servant, and 
who give themselves in loving service in imitation of 
their Master. 

Lthically Jesus gave more stress to humility than the 
Jews were accustomed to. He dealt in a novel way with the

Law, choosing from it what was best, adding to it, and 
changing it where he believed it should be changed. And 
finally, and most important of all, as far as principles 
for living go, was the unique demand for something more 
than just justice and goodness, for the expression in life 
of the love which God, while we were yet sinners, showed 
for us by giving of his time and life. 

Jesus was unique. His life and his teaching created 

that impression on the people of his day, because it was 

new teaching, with the authority of a life behind it. His 

death and resurrection confirmed the impression, and the 

spirit of Christ in men’s hearts ever since, has created a 

fellowship of those who are united through this belief in 

the unique Son of God. The transformed lives of men have 

been the witnesses of this truth unto others. 

What grace, 0 Lord, and beauty shone 
Around Thy steps below! 

What patient love was seen in all 
Thy life and death of woe! 

Thy foes might hate, despise, revile, 

Thy friends unfaithful prove: 

Unwearied in forgiveness still, 

Thy heart could only love. 

0 give us hearts to love like Thee, 

Like Thee, 0 Lord, to grieve 
Far more for others’ sins than all 
The wrongs that we receive. 

One with Thyself, may every eye 

In us, Thy brethren, see 

That gentleness and grace that spring 

From union, Lord, with Thee 0 1
