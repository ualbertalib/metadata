CHAPT m I. 

PURPOSE OF IOTE3TIGATIQH. 

(The purpose of this investigation is to study the vocabul¬ 
aries of high school students in the schools of the Province of 
Alberta, in an effort to find out the JSLlowing: 


I. 

To what extent do students use in writing the words 

they already know, i.e. what is the correspondence 
between vocabulary of expression and that of recogni¬ 

II. 

tion? 

How rapidly do students acquire new words and to what 

extent do they use those words? 

III. 

What is the correlation between extent of vocabulary 

and native intelligence? 

IV. 

To what extent does knowledge of another vernacular 

besides English affect command over the English language? 

Y. 

What, if any, is the effect of occupational status of 

a child®s father upon the richness of the Ghild f s own 

YI. 

vocabulary? 

To what extent does general excellence in composition 

depend upon possession of a large vocabulary? 

VII. 

How does a student 1 s ability in reading compare with 

ability of composition and knowledge of English words? 


and such other factors as may seem relevant concerning age, sax, 
whether habitation is rural or urban, etc*

CHAPTER II 
SOURCES OP DATA* 


In the October 1934 issue of the A.T.A. Magazine, official 
organ of the Alberta Teachers* Alliance, there was published an 
appeal to the teachers of the province to obtain themes from their 
students in Grades YII to XII upon the topic "The Most Exciting 
Ride I Ever Had", The response to this appeal was most generous, 
and several hundred thanes were received. Prom this source it was 
intended to form a selection of about five hundred subjects distrib¬ 
uted as evenly as possible over Grades VII to XII inclusive and 
distributed between schools of as many different sizes as possible. 
This ideal was not wholly obtained for various reasons. 

Pew of the smaller school and practically none of the rural schools 
apparemjjLy teach Grade XII, and consequently most of the subjects 
in this grade were drawn from one source. However, since many of 
the students, after completing the earlier part of their secondary 
education had come to the city for their Grade XII, a fairly re¬ 
presentative selection, it is felt, of the Grade XII population has 
been obtained. 

The complete data that was desired from each child in¬ 
cluded the following: 

I, Rating of composition according to Hudelson scale, 

II, Analysis of fifty running words from the compositions 
for comparative word frequencies, using Thorndike’s 
"Teacher’s Word Book of 20,000 Words",

VI. Supplementary information such as: 

(a) Age

(c) Grade

Among the several hundred essays submitted, there were 
comparatively few from Grade XI and none at all in this grade from 
city schools. To remedy this discrepancy, thirty eight students from 
an Edmonton school were asked to write the theme in the middle of 
February, about four months after the others had been written. This 
will perhaps bias slightly the results from this grade. 

The high number of subjects from Grade VII is due to the 
fact that there was a misunderstanding as to what room subsequent 
tests should be given, with the result that they were given to the 
wrong class, necessitating an analysis, which would otherwise not 
have been done, of the compositions written by that class. 

The original distribution of subjects by grades and schools 
is shown in Table I. 

From this table we can see that of the whole population, 
the two cities of Edmonton and Calgary are together responsible for

two hundred and forty nine subjects, or 45*2$ of the total* The 
reason for this is mainly that of expediency, to save the expense of 
time and money involved in sending small bundles of testing material 
to schools where there are only a few students, with the attendant 
uncertainty and irregularity of receiving the tests again for mark¬ 
ing when wanted* However, it is partly due to the necessity of 
going to city schools for Grade XII pupils, the fact that few papers 
were received from Grade -XI, and the necessity of adding an addit¬ 
ional Grade VII class as mentioned above* 

Two hundred and fourteen, or 38*S^of the essays analyzed 
were received from small town or village schools, including Bellevue, 
Camrose, Bast Coulee, Xamont, RedeXiff, and Tofield* Eighty seven 
essays, or 15*$> of the essays came from rural schools, including 
Balemead, Hillock, Mapova, Merna, Nacotown, Pincher City, Sunniebend, 
Turin, and Wallace* 

Table I does not however represent the complete population 
studied* In the first place, many more compositions than those of 
the students included in this table were scored or rated. Also, 
students who were absent when the topic was assigned were present 
to take some or all of the subsequent tests, and similarly students 
present for the writing of the theme were absent in some cases for 
the other material* This means that the total population studied 
even disregarding those who wrote the composition and nothing else, 
is somewhat larger than that indicated, whereas the population upon 
which complete data were obtained is somewhat smaller* This will 
be indicated where relevant*

CHAPTER III 
SCORING THE THMES 

The themes were first of all scored by comparing them 
with the samples in the Hudelson English composition scale* This 
is a collection of compositions which are given values ranging from 
8*00 to 9*5, the step or difference between each composition and 
the next in value being .5. The difference in ability from one 
composition to the next in the series is supposed to be equal all 
along the line, so that a rating of "6.0 represents exactly twice 
as much composition merit" as a rating of 3*0. The top two are the 
only compositions not written by school children. 

However, It must be admitted that, though the investigator 
practised on the samples provided until his "systematic error" had 
reached a negligible amount, this rating is not wholly satisfactory. 
One hundred and forty of the essays shown were rated by a person 
other than the investigator» Moreover, despite the utmost care, the 
fact remains that this method of rating is not objective, and many 
factors, such as grammar, punctua tion, mastery of idiom, spelling, 
clarity, choice of language, maturity of style, and numerous others 
must be taken into account; and while one rater might place emphasis 
on one phase in forming his judgments, another person might lay 
stress on quite different factors. Also, the rating might be biased 
by such extraneous factors as neatness and writing, despite all 
efforts to the contrary.

Nor did the investigator find the scale wholly satisfactory. 
It seemed that the series did not contain sufficient samples and ac¬ 
cordingly it was quite difficult to rate one that fell between two 
consecutive samples on the scale. Moreover, the samples are quite 
short in proportion to those obtained from Alberta students, and it 
was difficult to decide how far verbosity was a virtue or the re¬ 
verse. Finally, the samples rated 4.5, 5.0,5.5, in the series seem 
rated too high in comparison with the others. 

In compiling diagrams and calculating means, medians, norms, 
etc., the writer has taken into account all the themes he scored, 
regardless as to whether they are included in the populationas 
shown in fable I or not. This is done so that by having a larger 
population the results for Alberta may be more valid. However, 
in order that the results may be more homogeneous, only those themes 
which he himself scored have been considered. In making comparisons, 
deriving coefficients of correlation, etc., the rating of the Table 
I population alone has been considered, regardless of who did the 
scoring. 

Five hundred and ten scores have been included in the anal¬ 
ysis of the Hudelson ratings, the distribution according to grade 
and merit being indicated on Table II. In this Table are indicated 
the norms that the author of the test has derived, the means, med¬ 
ians, and Standard Deviations of our five hundred and ten cases, as 
well as the third and first quartiles (Qg and Q x ) and the Semi- 
Interquartile Ranges (s). Diagrams I to VI give the frequency 
polygons of the distributions from Grades Vil to XII respectively.

with the data graduated by means of the normal curve according to 
the method illustrated on page 75 of Camp's "Elementary Statistics". 

Hudelson does not tell us. whether he derived his norms by 
means of the Medians or the Means, but this does not greatly matter, 
as in our data the correspondence between these two measures is 
fairly close. Remembering the sources of error inherent in the 
comparatively small population and subjectivity of the marking, it 
seems that though his norms are fairly applicable to Alberta students 
in Grades XII and XI, below that they are too low by increasing 
amounts. Taking the Means and Medians to one decimal place as Hudel¬ 
son does his norms, and comparing the three .scales we get the 
following:

the children

January, 

whereas the

compositions were 

written in October, 

with the 

exception 

of half the 


Grade XI ones, which were written in February. Indirect corrobor¬ 
ation to this will be furnished presently, whan we see that Alberta 
students are better at comprehension in reading than certain American 
students, and a priori we should expect a certain relationship to 
exist between excellence of comprehension and ability in handling 
the vernacular in writing.

A comparison of the frequency polygons with the theoretical 
normal curves reveals a quite close correspondence in all cases 
except for Grades VII and XII* These grades had the lowest pop¬ 
ulations, the number of subjects being sixty-six and forty-four; 
and the discrepancies between observed and theoretical discrepancies 
is probably largely due to the paucity of data* However, it is 
interesting to observe that the sharp drop which occurs in both cases 
just above the middle of the range is strikingly similar to the drop 
that occurs just below the fifty percent mark in certain departmental 
high school examinations. Such discrepancies are well shown in a 
dissertation by Monroe MacLeod entitled 5, A Statistical Study of the 
Validity of Objective and Essay Examinations in History II". In 
that case the reason for the sudden drop seems to be that the ©x» 
amin ers are loathe to give a mark just below the passing mark, and 
shove it up or down a bit. Similar subjective factors no doubt 
enter here. In Grade VII the nadir of the depression occurs at 
the point 5*55 and in Grade XII at the point 6*95. In the opinion 
of the writer, the Hudelson value 5.5 is the point at which a 
composition changes from being definitely ppor to being tolerably 
good; and the value 7*0 marks the point at which a composition 
ceases to be immature, adolescent, or childish, and becomes repre¬ 
sentative of good mature writing* This is probably at least part 
of the explanation for these discrepancies* 

In the case of Grade XI the scores are definitely skewed 
negatively from the ideal distribution. The quartile co-efficient

of Skewness, (Q 3 - 2Qg j. Qi)/ S , where the Q* s are the quar tiles and 
’’s” the semi-interquartile range, is in this case — 0.417. The 
Grade VIII scores are also somewhat skewed, hut in the other dir¬ 
ection* Here the measure of skewness is -j~0.232. In Grade X the 
scores clustartoo closely around the point just above the Hudelson 
score 6 . 0 . 

Considering the subjectivity of marking, the scoring seems 
to have been done reasonably well, especially in Grades VIII to XI 
inclusive* Ho doubt this is partly due to compensating errors, one 
theme being marked too low, and the next too high, and so on.

CHAPTER IV 

AHALYZIBG THE WRITTEH VOCABULARY 

In studying the importance of words actually used by 
students the compositions analyzed were those shown in Table I* 

Prom each theme fifty running words were chosen, starting about 
eight or ten lines from the beginning, and without reference to 
new sentences, paragraphs, etc* Then the comparative importance of 
each of these fifty words was found by reference to Thorndike's 
"Teacher's Word Book of 20,000 Words 11 * 

This book contains the twenty thousand words "found most 
frequently and widely in general reading for children and young 
people"• Each of these words is classified according to its imp¬ 
ortance* The classifications run as follows: la, lb, 2a, 2b— 

5b, 6, 7,— -20* Thus la means that a word is in the most import¬ 
ant and most common thousand; and also that it is in the more 
common five hundred of that thousand* A word in the less common 
five hundred of the first thousand is classified as lb and so on 
up to 5b. Prom there on the words are classified only to the near¬ 
est most common thousand; thus a rating of 14 implies that there are 
at least thirteen thousand, but not more than thirteen thousand 
nine hundred and ninety-nine words in the English language that 
are more common. In this study an additional classification, BO -f 
has been made for words that do not occur in the Word Book and are 
therefore less common than any of the twenty thousand words that 
do occur in it.

are not very accurately placed. Proper names have in general lower 
ratings than they should have®---—-Some words recently introduced 
into books and magazines have lower credits than they should have® 
Words used in books about history and chemistry probably have some¬ 
what higher ratings than they should have, and words used in books 
about music and athletics somewhat lower ratings than they should 
have® For certain reasons the credits for abbreviations like in*, 
bbl., yd., etc., are probably too low and far less reliable than 
those for words.......Probably also there are some errors due to 

faulty marking, tabulating, or copying......It is, however, enor¬ 
mously superior to any one person’s judgement, and its occasional 
misleadingwill be outweighed probably fifty to one by its sub-

stantially correct guidance concerning the frequency and range of 
occurrence of words' 1 * 

A study of the words used by Alberta students shows that 
often one word is used where another is intended, e.g. break for 
brake, new for knew, of for off, etc® In such cases the tabulation 
has been made from the word meant rather than actually written® 

Quite often also two words have been written where they should have 
been joined together. Examples of these are: motor cycle, street 
car, a while, up set® In each of such cases the composite words 
rather than the separate components have been tabulated. Occasion¬ 
ally also two words have been joined by the student, such as light¬ 
ening- quick, fast-approaching, alright, etc. Where such combina¬ 
tions are found in the Word Book they are considered for this study 
as being’ one word; otherwise, they are considered as two and class¬ 
ified accordingly. Proper names, such as Jimmy, Idaho, Edmonton, 
etc., have been included where they occur in the Word Book, other¬ 
wise they have been skipped over, and considered as not having been 
written. This was thought preferable to classifying them as 2 q 4 , 
as other words not in the Work Book have been classified, because 
in childrens compositions a large number of place names and names 
of friends are mentioned, and it was felt that such procedure would 
bias the results too much in favor of the rarer words. 

The comparative distribution of the words from classification 
lb to 20 4, and from Grade VII to XII is shown in Table III. Since 
there are not equal numbers in each grade the frequencies have been

reduced to percentages to make them comparable with each other and 
to permit generalizations* Prom these results curves have been 
drawn in Diagrams VII to IX inclusive, using the classifications 
la to 20 as abscissae and the comparative frequencies as ordinates* 
Por purposes of comparison the comparative frequencies in Grade YII 
from la to %0 have been plotted in Diagram YII on the usual Cartesian 
co-ordinates. This system does not reveal very much except that 
there is a very sudden drop at the beginning of the curve, a nd 
then the curve flattens out running more or less parallel to the 
horizontal axis. Accordingly, to get the whole curve on one sheet, 
and at the same time examine the lower part of the curve under a 
microscope, as it were, the curves have been plotted on Pour Cycle 
Ratio Chart or Semi-Logarithmic graph paper. This has the advant¬ 
age of revealing any "hands by spacing out the points in the lower 
part of the curve, whereas such trends might easily be overlooked 
in a curve such as that in Diagram YII* However, in interpreting 
such curves, caution must be exercised, as the vertical distances 
between points on the lower half of such paper are greatly exagger¬ 
ated. Maturally this is so when each deck or cycle represents ten 
times as great a vertic^L distance as the one immediately below it. 

Diagram YIII shows the curves for Grades YII, VIII, and IX. 
The reason for plotting thea& curves on one sheet is partly because 
at the present moment such paper is practically unavailable. How¬ 
ever, such a scheme is very serviceable for purposes of comparison. 

In order to avoid getting the curves tangled up with each other.

the vertical axis has been moved to the right two of the larger 
units for each successive grade. Diagram IX shows similar curves 
for Grades X, XI, and XII, with the tails of the preceding theoret¬ 
ical curves also indicated® 

For each grade a smooth curve has been drawn by eye among 
the points® For various reasons this is preferable to the actual 
frequency polygon. In the first place there are so few words in 
the higher classifications that discrepancies easily occur, and the 
comparative frequency might easily be too high by one student using 
the same uncommon word two or three times in his fifty words. For 
instance, in Grade VII, with ninety-three students, all the words 
in the eighteenth thousand were contributed by one pupil, in the 
seventeenth and the thirteenth by two® Similarly, since words at 
such high altitudes, so to speak are quite rare, a classification 
might quite easily be skipped over, as has been done in Grade IX, 
with its eighty-eight students, in the thirteenth, fifteenth, seven¬ 
teenth, and twentieth thousands. Incidentally, since no matter how 
far down one goes on semi-logarithmic paper one never reaches ?ero, 
points representing zero frequencies had to b© omitted. 

Another source of discrepancy lies in the topic itself. 

Since all subjects wrote on the most exciting ride they had ever 
experienced, we find the same words occurring over and over again. 
Thus the word ’pilot 9 occurs in the sixth thousand and that Class¬ 
ification has consistently too great a frequency. ’Aeroplane (or 
airplane) is in the tenth thousand, and in every case but that for

Gra&e XI the frequency is too high. Many children found their 
most exciting moments on a roller coaster (even though they do call 
it a rolley coaster) and accordingly the nineteenth thousand, in 
which ’coaster) occurs, is unduly affected. Thus in Classification 
17, we find ’windshield 9 ; in 18 ’speedometer’, ’propeller’, and 
’shaky’; in 19 ’accelerator* and ’street-car’; in 20 ’trailer’ ana 
goggles’. However, up to and including at least the fifteenth 
'thousand, the topic of the essay seems to provide for a wide choice 
and variety of words. 

diagram 

An examination of Table III and derived A reveals the rather 
surprising fact that high school students, out of all the scores of 
thousands of words in the English language, choose around eighty 
percent of the ones they use from the most common five hundred,words, 
although individual cases varied from 94$ in lower grades to 58$ in 
higher gradesJ and from ninety to ninety four percent from the most 
common two thousand, with similar individual differences. No wonder 
high school students don't like spelling; they never use the words 

when they do learn them, and a knowledge of spelling is unnecessary 

in reading, or comparatively sol 

The second surprising feature about this set of curves is 

that they indicate very little change from Grade VII to Grade XII. 

Acquisitions to written vocabulary seem to be extremely gradual, 
especially of the more uncommon words. There is an obvious increase 
in the theoretical number of words at the Twentieth thousand mark 
as shown in Diagram IX, and at corresponding lower levels, but when 
we realize that the increase at the twentieth thousand is only from

These results have been plotted in Diagram X, the abscissa© 


representing grades and the ordinates representing comparative fre— 


quencies. This diagram shows that there is a definite and well- 
marked drop in the use of the first five hundred words, and a grad¬ 


ual increase in the use of words of lesser importance, which increase 
becomes less and less as higher and higher levels are reached. 

These two factors,- meagreness of vocabulary at all educa¬ 
tional levels, and extrema slowness of growth, have been noted by 
several previous investigators. 0. C. Brandenburg conducted an in¬ 


vestigation which is reported under the title of w Pyechological 
Aspects of Language" in the Journal of Educational Psychology, vol¬ 
ume 9, pages 313 - 332, 1918. However, his test was more in the 
nature of a word recognition test. He chose two hundred words 
evenly spaced throughout the Webster Academic Dictionary, and each 
word in his test represented one hundred and forty in this diction¬ 
ary. They were arranged in increasing order of difficulty, and the 


criterion of the child®s knowledge of the word was his ability to

They were drawn from sixty-eight classes in Grades II to XII in¬

scattered through Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, and Colorado, varying 
in population from twelve hundred to thirty thousand. The test was

tween Alberta and the American states mentioned above^ it is quite 
evident that there is little relationship between the size of a 
person’s writing and his reading vocabulary. 

We shall find this corroborated when we come to consider the 
Vocabulary Test the Alberta children answered. 

F. P. GBrien conducted an investigation somewhat similar to 
the present one which he describes in "The Vocabulary of High School 
Students in Written Composition", Journal of Educational Research, 
volume 11, pages 344 - 350, 1925. He tabulated his results accord¬ 
ing to Thorndike’s Teacher’s Word Book. This goes only as far as 
the first ten thousand words in the "Teacher’s Word Book of 20,000 
Words", which is a revision of it. As far as it goes, it is sub¬ 
stantially the same as the latter, although a few words have had 
their classification changed. He drew his subjects from fourteen

As in OBrien’s experiment, the older edition of Thorndike f s Word 
Book was used. In this edition not all the words were classified

"The teacher of English must not expect training in word 
recognition to transfer to a large extent to word usage in composi¬ 
tion writing"# That makes it practically unanimous# 

P. M# 3 yin on ds and Baldwin Lee have also studied the subject 
in somewhat the same manner, using the earlier edition of the Word 
Book, but as their results are not readily comparable with such as 
given above, they are omitted# Their findings are outlined in 
"Studies in the Learning of English Expression", Teachar T s College 
Record, volume 31, pages 50 - 58, October 1929# 

Table IV is a synthesis of the results obtained in this 
investigation (classifed under A); those which OBrien found (ent¬ 
ered under BI and BII for Groups I and II respectively); and those 
obtained from college students by Witty and Pry (classified under C)#

Since the fifth classification did not exactly include the fifth 
most common thousand, these were found by a method of straight line 
interpolation, and the difference was classified under the head 6 -10. 
This is probably not strictly accurate, but close enough for prac¬ 
tical purposes. The Table shows us that regardless of time, place, 
or educational attainments, students choose from eighty-four to ninety 
percent of their words from the most common thousand, four to seven 
percent from the second most common thousand, two to four percent 
from the third thousand and so on. Alberta students seem to choose 
somewhat fewer from the first thousand than do other students of 
similar educational standing, which of course means that they use 
more words that are not so common than do others.

CHAPTER ¥ 

ANALYZING THE RECOGNIZED VOCABULARY 


As mentioned in Chapter II, besides a study of the written 
vocabularies of the students, a vocabulary test was also given. 

This was derived from the Word Book and modeled after the Thorndike 
Test of Word knowledge* The latter was designed for Grades IY to X, 
and as our subjects were in Grades YII to XII, it was desired to 
have one somewhat more difficult, which was accomplished by choosing 
more of the uncommon words than Thorndike has* 

The test was drawn up on the multiple-choice form, so that 
for each test word the student had to find the best synonym from 
among five possible answers* The words were chosen and arranged 
according to decreasing frequency and importance in the language 
as measured by Thorndike's Word Book* The words were chosen accord¬ 
ing to the following scheme* 

Five words from each of the first four thousand 
Six 11 tf n ,f " next nine n 

Five Tf " " " " four ” 

Two ,T " " ft last three f? 

At each level words were chosen so as to avoid inflections 
of more common words, such as 'knew®, 'brought', etc., with one or 
two exceptions that will be pointed out below* Words beginning with 
prefixes, such as 'unseen', 'transcontinental', etc., were also 
avoided* The words were chosen from all through the book* 

The correct response word was judged by three criteria. In

the first place, it had to he one for which a synonym could he found 
in a standard dictionary* For this purpose Annandale’s n Concise 
English Dictionary'* was used* In the second place the synonym had 
to he at least as common as the stimulus word itself, preferably 
more so. Finally, the stimulus word had to he capable of definition 
in one or at most two words* there any one of these criteria could 
not he satisfied, the word was discarded and another chosen. 

The position of the word was chosen at random. There were 
five possible positions* Starting at the beginning of the test, 
a column of figures from Wentworth and Hill’s Logarithmic Tables 
was chosen and the last digit of the logarithm noted. When a 1 or 
£ occurred, the response word was placed in the first position; where 
a 5 or 4 occurred, in the second position and so on. 

Of the possible response words, particular attention was paid 
to one other besides the correct one. A word analogous in form or 
meaning; or suggestive in some way or other was used where possible. 
Thus for words similar in form w© have •precious* as an alternative 
for ’precarious*, ’parrot’ for ’parapet*, ’lapel* for ’ladle*, etc. 
For analogies in meaning, there is ’companion* for ’accompany*, 
’hatred* for ’rage*, ’significant’ for ’signify These occur 
mainly in the first part of the test. In the last part, this in¬ 
direct suggestion was more subtle* Thus for No. 60 9 ’Boulder’ is 
somewhat similar to ’bowler* and as the latter is a hat, the word 
was included in the possible choices. Similarly in No. 46, ’averse* 
suggests ’reverse*, so ’opposite* was used. In No. 99 * jejune’ 
Resembles *jeune* so the word 1 young* was included.

The position of the analogous response word was also 
chosen at random. After the correct response had been filled in, 
there still remained four possible positions for the analogous word. 
Each suit in a deck of card was arbitrarily given a position and by- 
shuffling and cutting the deck, the analogous words were located. 

The remaining possible response words were chosen haphaz¬ 
ardly being of about the same degree of difficulty as the stimulus 
word. Thorndike in his test has made all the possible responses to 
be the same part of speech, such as noun, adverb, verb, etc., as is 
the stimulus word. In this test, as long as the word looked as if 
it might be the same part of speech, it was considered satisfactory. 

The fallowing is the final form of the test, with the posi¬ 
tion of the correct response word indicated in each case. Thirty 
minutes w*t**allow©d for its completion.

Before the test was given to all the students, it was first 
tried out on three Edmonton classes, including one in Grade VII, 
one in Grade IX, and one in Grade XII# These classes included, 
thirty-four, twenty-nine, and twenty-four students respectively# 

The test seemed to give satisfactory distributions and be suitably 
graded for difficulty, the respective medians being 42*9, 67#5, and 
78#3# Two slight changes only were made# In the original draft, 

I I I 

Ho# 13,'nearly, had been erroneously printed as nearby# However, 
’next* was considered as the correct response, and the tests marked 
accordingly* In Ho# 30, the original fifty response for f devout f 
was ’devoted® which apparently was too close to the meaning of the 
stimulus word, as many chose it in preference to the correct response 
’religious?• Accordingly, it was changed to ’hungry’# 

In order to test the test, a number of students in Grades 
VII, VIII, and IX also answered Form A of the Thorndike Test for 
Word knowledge, which as mentioned above, is very similar in form. 

In all, one hundred and eight students wrote the two tests, but for 
comparative purposes one hundred and seven were considered# Go the 
above test one student had obviously guessed at every word, as his 
answers were all 2’s and 3’s and his total score only 19, whereas 
by the operation of chance alone he should get a score of 20# The 
usual product - moment method of deriving a co-efficient of corr¬ 
elation was utilised, with the following results:

The co-efficient of correlation between this test is vary 
high, with a very low Probable Error. Accordingly we may consider 
it to have a high degree of reliability. It is noteworthy that the 
Standard Deviations in these two tests for the population testaJis 
almost the same. To compare the means, we must add 3 to the Thorn¬ 
dike 1 Mean, as that much is subtracted from each score to get the 
final score, probably to make the norms for the different forms of 

the test comparable. Accordingly, the Thorndike Mean would be 56.655,1 

' 

which is more than 8 greater than that of the above test. It was 
the intention to make the above test more difficult that the Thorn¬ 
dike test, and this has evidently been accomplished. 

However, the test is by no means perfect. Sandiford, in his 
"Educational Psychology"/pages 318 et seq. lists the criteria of a 
good test as validity, accuracy, reliability, objectivity, economy 
of time‘and effort and satisfactoriness of norms. Its validity is 
at the moment problematic; but we do know one thing , and that is 
that it does not measure the vocabulary the child uses of his own 
accord. Confirmation of this statement will appear later.

V® M® Sims made an investigation concerning the "Reliab¬ 
ility and Validity of Pour Types of Vocabulary Tests", which he 
discusses in the Journaf^ U o^6°esearch f volume £0, page 94, 1929* 

He chose seventy words from the Thorndike Test of Word knowledge. 
Form B, which he submitted to on© hundred and ten students in 
Grades V to VIII® The words were arranged in four tests. Identif¬ 
ication, matching, multi pi e-regponse (such as ours), and checking® 

He comes to the conclusion that the co-efficient of reliability of 
the Multiple-Response form is f0®84, somewhat lower than that ob¬ 
tained in this investigation, but still quite high® 

Validity he measured by a series of correlations between 
the scores obtained on the different tests® His co-efficients of 
the different tests with the Multiple-Response test were as follows: 


Identification ®74 
Matching ®93 
Multiple-Response .84 
Checking ®54 


The final conclusion he reaches is that all forms of the 
test except the checking test have a high degree of validity. Al¬ 
though the matching test is the best, the Multiple-Response test 
is very high also in this respect. 

Accuracy Sandiford defines as follows: "A test is perfectly 
accurate when the units of measurement are wholly appropriate and 
absolutely equal at all points of the scale". Inasmuch as the 
number of words chosen from each thousand is not in this test fixed.

the assumption is a priori that just to that extent the test is not 
accurate* 

Reliability has already been discussed* 

The test is perfectly objective as two examiners marking 
one copy cannot get different results. 

This test is quit© economical in cost f and also in time 
taken to mark it. Even in its present rather unwieldy form (mimeo¬ 
graphed sheets) a copy can b© marked in a couple of minutes* 

As for the norms, these are yet to be derived. 

As mentioned above, rareness of a word does not always corr¬ 
espond with its difficulty. Thus No. 7 ’immediate* is a comparat¬ 
ively common word, falling in the second thousand, but it appears 
quite difficult for some students in the lower grades studied. Its 
high rating probably comes from the inflected form ’immediately*, as 
these two are considered as one word. 

No. 73, ’coyotes* seems much easier than would be suggested 
by its position in the thirteenth thousand, but this is probably 
due to local association. Yery few of them are seen in the New 
England states nowadays, and practically none in Great Britain. 

Another word with a high degree of rareness is ’chum*, which 
occurs in the eleventh thousand. Nevertheless, none of the subjects 
seemed to have any difficulty with it. This word probably has a 
less evident provincialism about it, and is not so common in other 
parts of the world as here.

No# 97, ’quandry* is spelt wrong, but this apparently 
has not affected its useful ness* 

No# 10, Accompany* really has two possible synonyms# After 
the test was set up and distributed, it was found that ’companion’ 
has official sanction as a verb# However, ’attend* seems still the 
best choice, and accordingly is considered the correct answer# 

A slight degree of ambiguity exists in No# 3, as ’notice* 
is occasionally used synonymously with ’sight’, e*g# '* It cam© to my 
notice"# However, the equivocalness here is practically negligible# 
In marking this test, no allowance was mad© for guessing# 
Concerning this type of test, Sandiford, in his "Educational Psy¬ 
chology", gives the following formula for deriving the final score: 

Score = Eights _ -Wrongs 

N — 1 

where N is the number of responses presented* But he goes on to say 
that "If four or more choices are allowed, chance plays a comparat¬ 
ively insignificant part in determining the score and usually need 
not be considered"* It was further felt that the element of guessing 
minimized still more by the suggested incorrect choice, as mentioned 
above; and by normalizing the distribution. However, we shall see 
that the element of chance is not so negligible as Sandiford would 
have us believe. 

Results were obtained from all schools indicated in Table I, 
with the exception of Wallace School# In addition, this test was 
given as part of the University of Alberta School of Education

survey of the King George School at Leduc, and these results have 
been incorporated into the data in attempting to establish grade 
and age norms. From the King George School tests were received from 
twenty-three pupils in Grade 21, fifteen in Grade 2, twenty-six 
in Grade 12, In all, the test was administered to five hundred and 
fifty-nine students, of whom eleven were not considered in finding 
grade averages as they had either ommitted to indicate the grade or 
the grade shown did not agree with that indicated on the October 
composition or other tests. In finding averages and trends, the 
results from both the original and the revised forms of the test 
were used, since the revision was very slight* The test was admin¬ 
istered in all cases with the exception of the school in Leduc during 
the month of February, 1955* At Leduc it was given the March foll¬ 
owing,

and Qg as usual stand for the first and third quartile respectively. 
On the diagrams the Median is indicated by Qg. The Semi-interquartile 
Range (Qg — is indicated by "s fT , Diagrams 21 to ZYI show 

the actual and theoretical distributions in Grades YII to 211 resp¬ 
ectively. 

In considering the distribution of Grade YII on Diagram 21, 
the most striking feature is the way in which the scores are pi^ed

up at the lower extremity, while the upper extremity tapers off 
comparatively gradually. Other things being equal, by the laws of 
chance alone,a student should be able to obtain a score of twenty. 
(One student in this grade obviously guessed at every answer and 
obtained nineteen • This score has been discarded). In most cases, 
and especially in the lower grades,the students answered every item 
regardless of their knowledge thereof* Accordingly a student who 
knew only five or ten items and guessed at all the rest would nor¬ 
mally obtain a score somewhere between twenty and thirty. And the 
reason that the distribution tapers off at the top is that the more 
a student knows, the less he will need to guess, and therefor© the 
more nearly is his score commensurate with his actual vocabulary. 

The fact that the distribution is so skewed probably means 
that the theoretical curve is also pushed up on the scale. However, 
it has been considered "as is", and no attempt made to orient it 
more accurately. 

In this diagram as in the ones following, the upper and 
lower limits for each grade have been indicated. These will be dis¬ 
cussed in detail below. 

for 

The theoretical curve A Grade VIII only approximately coin¬ 
cides with the actual frequency polygon. This is also true for 
Grade 2. However, no doubt with a greater population, these distrib¬ 
utions would come closer to the ideal. 

Diagram XI, indicating the distribution for Grade XI, is 
quite interesting in that the actual curve approximates the theor-

atioal one very closely, except that frequencies which should be 
at the very centre of the curve appear to be pushed, not just a 
little to each side, but to the very extremities, upper and lower* 
About seventeen percent of the population tested are either quite 
inferior or quite superior to the milling herd as far as vocabulary 
goes. 

The distributions for Grades IX and XII might provide very 
fine inspirations for Gothic architecture, but as approximations to 
the normal curve they are distinctly disappointing. Probably finer 
grouping would smooth them out somewhat, but would certainly not get 
rid of all the superflous modes. The explanation for these discrep¬ 
ancies probably lies in the fact that the populations in each grade 
are quite heterogeneous. In one respect at least they fall into 
two well-defined groups, unilingual and bilingual, and this no doubt 
has much to do with the peculiar distributions. The question of 
bilingualism will be fully dealt with later. 

In Diagram XVII, the mean scores for each grade have been 
plotted, and the trend indicated. This trend line has merely been 
sketched in by sight* Bince a child's grade is not a measure of 
ability or achievement in any single subject or groups of subjects, 
a more detailed study of trends has been left until ages are con¬ 
sidered. A superficial examination of the trend line for grades, 
however, seems to indicate that it lies between a straight line 
and an exponential curve. 

In Diagram XVIII the quartiles for the grades are plotted.

The second quartile, or median would have been plotted on the same 
diagram as the mean, except that as they lie very close together, 
it would have complicated the diagram too much. However, a study 
of Table V indicates that the median follows the mean very closely 
and in all cases except Grade VII is greater than the mean by less 
than 1.1. In Grade VII it is less than the mean by a little more 
than 2. 

In general, the first and third quart lie follow the median 
quite closely, the distance from the third quartile to the median 
being somewhat greater than that from the first quartile to the 
median. The one exception is in Grade X, where the third quartile 
takes a sudden drop, accompanied by a corresponding diminution of 
the Semi-Interquartile Range. 

The limits for the grades were found by taking one half the 
distances from the mean of one grade to the mean of the next grade 
above or below it. This seemed reasonable, as the test was given 
about the middle of the school year. The lower limit for Grad© VII 
was found by subtracting one-half the difference between the Grade 
VIII and the Grade VII mean from the Grade VII mean, and the upper 
limit for Grade XII was established similarly. Since these grade 
limits are established by interpolation, which is only an approx¬ 
imation; or in the case of the extreme upper and lower limits by 
extrapolation, which is even less approximate, they can be considered 
only as tentative. However, an examination of Table VI would ind¬ 
icate that they are reasonably accurate. 


It would perhaps have been statistically sounder to have

worked from the medians rather than the means* The reason for 
this is that in computating the mean one taeitly assumes that all 
the eases are concentrated at the centre of each group or cla^ 
whereas in the computation of the median, and other percentiles, 
the assumption is that the cases are distributed evenly throughout 
the class. And in finding the number of cases in each grade we 
have used exactly the same system as in finding percentiles* That 
is, we have subtracted the cumulative frequency to the lower grade 
limit from the cumulative frequency to the upper grade limit* 

However, it was desired to find the theoretical as well as 
the actual number of cases at each grade level, using for this 
purpose the integrals under the normal curve* And since Gamp's 
Table I (Elementary Statistics, p* 380) is based on the mean and 
derived product moments, we have chosen the mean as our grade norms. 

The grade limits so derived are as follows:

Table VI (%) indicates the percentage of students in each 
grade who are at each of the other and the same grade norms. Thus, 
of the pupils in Grade VII, 42.30% are below Grade VII standard.

21*70% at Grade VII, 7.90% at Grade II, and so on. The theoretical 
as well as the actual percentages have been given. These have been 

derived from the applications of the normal curve as indicated in 

■ 

Diagrams XI to XVI respectively. 

In these diagrams, the Grade limits as mentioned above, 
have been indicated. The area under the frequency polygon between 
the grade limits thus represents approximately the actual number of 
cases at each grade level; and the area between the same limits 
under the normal curve represents quite accurately the theoretical 
number at each grade level. 

Occasionally we find both theoretical and actual frequencies 
at one grade level greater than at the next grade level towards the 
centre. Thus in Grade IX both the theoretical and actual frequencies 
of students at the Grade XI level are greater than the corresponding 
frequencies at the Grade X level. This is to be expected, as the 
widths of the grade levels are not uniform. 

The number below Grade VII level decreases and the number 
above Grade XII level increases as we go from the lower to high 
grades. This is naturally so as the mean with each successive grade 
increases, or moves from left to right in our table. 

Table VI (b) indicates the theoretical and actual relative 
frequencies of each grade below, above, and at that grade level. 
Generally speaking, about twenty percent of the population of each 
grade, is at its own grade level, with thirty-five to fo_rty-five 

percent above and below. This would indicate that despite assump- 

«* 

tions, extrapolations, and what-not, the grade limits have been

fairly well chosen. However, Grade VIII is an exception, with well 
over forty percent at its own grad© level, and just over twenty 
percent above that grade level. 

DIoTRIBUTIOH BY AGES 

In grouping the data according to the ages of the subjects, 
eleven more cases, as mentioned above, are considered than in the 
grouping according to grades. This gives us a total frequency of 
five hundred and fifty-nine, distributed as shown in Table VII. 

The agei of the subjects were taken as at their last birth¬ 
day, which might range anywhere from no days at all before the test 
was written to just short of a full year. It was thought inadvis¬ 
able to attempt a grouping of less than a full year, as such groups 
would contain very few frequencies and be much more subject to the 
fluctuations of chance. Instead, all cases are considered as con¬ 
centrated at the half-way point from one year to the next so that 
an age of sixteen is taken as being sixteen and one-half years. 
Horms or averages for finer divisions than one year can be found 
either by interpolating in Table VII or Diagram XIX, or by substit¬ 
uting the age in the regression equation. 

Although all avaAable cases have -been considered, means and 
other measures of ages below twelve and above nineteen cannot be 
considered reliable, as the greatest frequency for any one of those 
groups is six. Accordingly, in Diagram XIX, the lines connecting 
the mean points to the rest of the curve are dotted.

The coefficient of correlation between vocabulary score and 
age is quite low, being only .215-J: .027. This is not surprising, 
as the extent of a child*s vocabulary depends on many other factors 
besides his age* Possibly, in fact if does not depend on age at all, 
but varies directly according to age to the small extent to which it 
does simply because his age is a very crude measure of the breadth 
of experience that a child has in using the English language. Many 
factors indubitably tend to affect and influence a person*s know¬ 
ledge of the language, such as familiarity with the vernacular in 
every day life, cultural background, education, and degree of intell¬ 
igence. Even where everything else is equal, including Intelligence 
Quotient, there still may be differences in achievement on a test 
such as ours. According to Spearman’s "two factor" theory of intell-j 
igence, two persons equal in all other respects and with an equal 
"g" factor, or gieneral ability may differ in their n s" factors, or 
specific abilities. Thus we should not expect too high a degree of 
correlation between even such things as mental age and vocabulary 
achievement. 

Another factor which no doubt tends to minimize the degree 
of correlation between vocabulary achievement and age is that pre- j 
sumably the youngest children in our population are more brilliant 
than the average for their age, otherwise they would not be accel¬ 
erated a grade or two and so come into the grade range of our study. 
Conversely, at the upper end of the scale the older students are less 
brilliant than their contemporaries who have graduated from high

school a year or so ago. Theoretically these two factors should 
cancel each other, hut practical experience and surveys such as 
those conducted hy the Alberta School of Education in Port Saskat¬ 
chewan, Stoney Plain, Bruderheim, and Lamont show us that it is 

i 

much easier to keep a student in a grade longer than one year than 
to promote a child ahead of his classmates; especially as depart¬ 
mental regulations state a minimum hut no maximum time that must he 
spent in certain grades. The net result, therefore, is that as a 
rule the children of less than average ability are retarded much 
more than are the superior students accelerated. And accordingly 
the correlation bet?>/een age and vocabulary score is less than what 
a random sampling of the population at the upper age limits would 
give us. However, as inferred above, even under the best of con¬ 
ditions, we should not expect such relationship to be very marked. 

Letting Y stand for vocabulary score, and A for age, the foil 
owing measures were derived from Table VII .

.standard any given score represents, Analogously with the use of 
"M.A. M for mental age and “C .A.“ for chronological age, we might 
say it gives us the V.A. , or vocabulary age. loth the regression 
lines corresponding to these equations have been indicated on 
Diagram XIX* 

In this study only the correlation rati? of V. on A. has 
been considered, because extent of vocabulary is, to some small 
extent at least, a function of age, but the reverse is not true. 

The correlation ratio, Eta, is a measure of dispersion of 

column means and the more closely Eta approaches 1, the less is 

• / ,2 

the dispersion. Accordingly, the smaller the value of 1 — (Eta) , 
ranging from 0 to 1, the less is the dispersion. But for this 
expression we have a value of ,779,'which is quite large indeed. 

The smallness of th s absolute value of (Eta)^— r", also 
varying between the limits of 0 and-l, gives us a measure of trie 
linearity of regression, or the closeness with which tne age means 
approximate a straight line. This measure for our population is 
•l‘?» wi tn a Probable Error of- .023, as derived from the formula 
1 6 745 x 2 VTe ta^TITr, where A is the .number of cases, is tmis 
case 659. This definitely indicates non-linearity, shich is 
corroborated by an inspection of Diagram XIX. Vocabulary 
achievement, therefore, is not, mathematically,' a simple function 
of age. 

On the same diagram are plotted grade means. Assuming t 
a child progresses at the rate of 1 grade per year, at the age of 
thirteen and one half, he would be half way through. Grade VII, and 


































Page 67 


so on. The upper three grade means approximate the corresponding 
age means quite closely, hut in the lower grades the corresponding 
age means are much higher. Probably this is true becap.se whatever 
acceleration does take place occurs in the primary and intermediate 
grades of the public school and practically none after Grade YII 
is reached f It is here that the departmental regulations requiring 
a minimum time in each grade are introduced. Accordingly the more 
brilliant students are affecting the grade mean of the grade or 
grades above that corresponding to their own age. 

Because of the great number of factors affecting a child’s 
vocabulary, age norms alone cannot be considered satisfactory, meas¬ 
uring as they do only the length of time which he has had to acquire 
a word knowledge, furthermore, they appear to be unduly influenced 
by the less clever students, or at least the students of less vocab¬ 
ulary attainments than their contemporaries. On the other hand, 
students in the same school grade are^supposedly at least, at the 
same level of academic attainment, although in this attainment a 
knowledge of Ptaglish is only one factor among many. It is probably 
best to use both and let individual circumstances guide one.

CHAPTER VI 


RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VOCABULARY AND 
OCCUPATIONAL STATUS* 


Up to this point we.have made several assumptions, such as 
those concerning the effect of intelligence, social status, and bi- 
lingu alism, on a child*s command of the English language, for the 
purpose of explaining various results of our data. It would have 
been incorrect to make those assumptions without some evidence to 
support them, and that is the purpose of this chapter and the two 
immediately following. 

The present chapter will be devoted to discovering whether 
there is any relationship between the score a child obtains bn the 
vocabulary test and the occupation of his father, or occasionally 
of his mother. All those who wrote the test were asked to write 
down the occupation of their respective fathers, and these have been 
classified ihto seven groups. The classification is by no means 
precise, as often an occupation would seem capable of being class¬ 
ified in two or more groups. The classifications, together with the 
vocations included therein are as follows: 

1, Agricul tural : farmer 

2, Commercial : Commercial traveller, merchant 

3, Managerial : credit manager, banker, life insurance in¬ 
spector, mine manager, lumber yard manager, dairy in¬ 
spector, railroad conductor, grain company superintend-

making it too cumbersome they were omitted from the classification.

Some of these occupations were as follows; lumberman, broker, 
cattleman, elevator-man, pumpman, private investigator, collector, 
letter carrier, oil agent, pool hall proprietor, musician, truck 
and taxi driver, bank messenger, and so on* A few others, such as 
engineer, agent, foreman were too vague for one to know approximate- 1 


ly to what group they belong# Some students answered the question as 
to their father's occupation by "Unemployed' 1 , "Retired", or merely 
left a blank. There were accordingly a large number of students 


not included in this phase of the study* However, in all, three 
hundred and fifty-one subjects were classified* 



In order to iron out grade differences, the vocabulary 


were tabulated according to their distance from the grade mean 
measured in terms of the grade sigma or Standard Deviation* Then 
the frequencies in each occupational division were collected* Thus, 

considering the mean as the origin, and sigma as the unit of measure-} 

1 

ment, all scores regardless of grade, lying between the origin and 

!| 

f 1 sigma were grouped together for each vocation and so on. This 


gives us Table ¥111 where A is the actual frequency and fo the perc¬ 
entage in each vocational group* 


In Grade II, the origin minus sigma happened to come to 


exactly 60*0, and accordingly a score of sixty is just on the divid¬ 
ing line between the two groups— origin minus sigma, and origin minus 
2 sigma. When this happened, the frequency was split, half being 
assigned to the lower and half to the upper group* This is why 
half frequencies occur in Table VIII.

thirty-four percent of the total frequency will lie between the mean 
and plus or minus sigma, fourteen percent between plus and minus 
sigma and plus or minus 2 sigma respectively* and two percent be¬ 
tween plus or minus two sigma and plus or minus 5 sigma. Thus the 


entire frequency lies between minus 3 sigma and plus 3 sigma. This 


provides us with a method for finding what we may call a coefficient 

is 

of normality, and will tell us to what extent our sample^above or 


below an ideal universe from which we may suppose it to be drawn. 
Prom Table VIII frequencies below the origin have been, for comput¬ 
ation purposes, considered negative and those above the origin posi¬ 
tive. The percentage that each frequency is of the total of the 
vocational group in which it lies has been computed and considered 


positive or negative as the case may be, as have the ideal percentage 

s 


mentioned above* Then the ideal percentages have been subtracted fx 
from the actual ones with due attention to signs, and the differences 
collected. An example will perhaps make this clearer. For instance, 
for the managerial group, the problem is as follows. 


— 2<r _<r o $r 3<r" 

— 3.9 —10.6 —12.5 46.2 26.9 1.9 

— 2 —14 — 34 34 14 2 


subtract —1.9 3.6 21.5 12.2 12. $ —.1 

The total of the differences is 450.2. Suppose we now divide 

by one hundred to make our final index more analogous in size with 
other co-efficients used in statistics. Taking it to two decimal 
places, we have a final coefficient of normality of 4 .50. 

What are the limits between which this coefficient moves? 


Suppose the total frequency of our sample is farther from the mean 











Page 73 




or origin of the ideal universe than either plus or minus 3 sigma. 

Then we have a problem like this: 

— 3S — 2<S~ -S' o 2(T 3 <r 

— 100 % 

— 2 — 14 — 34 34 14 2 

sub- 

tract —100 B 14 34 — 34 —14 

and the sum of the differences is —100# The coefficient of norm¬ 
ality will therefore be —lOO/lOO - =-1.0. The limits between whichj 

our index can move are therefore i 1.0, and if the distribution is j 
perfectly normal, the coefficient will equal 0.0. j 

What does the coefficient measure? It tells us to what 
extent our sample is above or below what it should be if drawn at 
random from a perfect universe. In this case it tells us to what 
extent the scores of the students in each occupational group are 
superior or inferior to those of the whole population studied. 

Apologies are due for this digression into the realm of 
more or less pure statistics, but as far as the writer knows, this 
coefficient of normally is original with him, and therefore an ex¬ 
planation of it was in order. 

The coefficients of normality for the various vocational 

i 

groups were found to be as follows: Commercial —.21; Clerical .35; 
Agricultural .— .25; Managerial .50; Professional .62; Skilled .22; 
Unskilled .01. Since over two hundred subjects are not represented, 
there is no way in which we can check our results. Theoretically, 
the sum of the products of our coefficient and the number of cases 

in each group would, be zero. 











Page 74 


It is rather surprising to find that the children in the 
commercial group are inferior to the population as a whole for usually 
merchants and salesmen are well up in the social and economic scale# 
However, with our comparatively small samples, extraneous factors 

such as lack of mental ability might easily enter, and we have no j 

. 

knowledge that our business men are representative of business men 
as a whole# 

■ 

The students whose parents are in clerical occupations do 
better than the average# Clerical occupations, although usually 
not highly remunerative, are generally economically secure, and per¬ 
haps this is what we find here# 

Wq might be tempted to ascribed the lowness of the coeffic¬ 
ient for agriculture to the fact that thirty-four out of one hundred 
and seven students speak a foreign language; but the proportion for 
unskilled labor is even higher, and yet the children in this class¬ 
ification do much better than the farming population. Probably the 
truth lies in the fact that farmers notoriously have little leisure, 
and the same applies to their families. When a lad walks a mile or 
so to school and then home again, and has chases to do both before and 
after school, he is not going to have much time for reading# And his 
parents being constantly busy, they are not going to spend much money 
on books they wont have time to us©# 

Those students in the managerial group are much higher than 
any of the others, except the professionaj. group# People in these 
occupations are generally well paid with a good deal of leisure and 
the education to use it#

As was expected the professional group ranks highest of 
any. This is no doubt partly due to the fact that students in this 
group live in homes where books are available; and probably these 
students inherit some of the intelligence and special aptitudes 
which made possible a professional education for their parents. 

Those in the skilled group are somewhat above the average, 
which is not suprising as skilled craftsmen are generally intellig¬ 
ent and able men, who, in normal times at least, earn a good living. 
It is, however, rather surprising that the unskilled group do as well 
as they do, for generally these people are at the bottom of the 
social and economic scale, or at least near it. Furthermore, thirty- 
two of these come from homes where another language is spoken. Per¬ 
haps a more detailed study with a greater number of subj ects would 
change this coefficient. 

In conclusion, we may say that there is a definite relation- 
shop between the vocabulary of a child and the occupation of his 
parent. In this study, with a comparatively small population and 
our classification made more or less arbitrarily on very scant data, 
we could not expect more definite results. It would be interesting 
to check the achievements in English against more complete data con¬ 
cerning the home environment, such as that furnished by Sims Socio- 
Economic Score Card. 

Fo attempt has been made to allow for high or low intelli¬ 
gence in this chapter, because the test given, the Otis-Self-Admin¬ 
istering, is entirely a reading test, and it was felt that a low 

intelligence score might arise from the same cause as a low vocab¬ 
ulary score, i.e., lack of ability in reading.

CHAPTER YXI 


EFFECT OF BILINGUALISM OH YGCABULARY 


One hundred and nine of the students tested came from homes 
where another language besides English is spoken, and it was felt 
that a priori this would militate against them doing as well on the 
vocabulary as their classmates* Accordingly each student was asked 
to indicate what language or languages are spoken in his home* 

These languages were classified into four groups, as follows: 

1* Central European : Ukrainian, Slav, Slovak, Polish 
Bohemian 

2. Teutonic : German and Jewish 

3* Scandinavian : Finnish, Swe&sh, Norwegian* 

4. Romantic : French and Italian 

It was rather surprising to find that of all the students 
tested, only two came from French-speaking homes* Apparently all 
the French-speaking students go to separate school, which were not 
included in this study. However, since there are so many people 
in this country whose native tongue in French, no statement on bi¬ 
lingualism is complete that does not include a study of French- 
speaking subjects. 

The scores were grouped according to the same method as in 
the previous chapter* That is, the distance from the grade mean, 
measured in terms of the Standard Deviation of the grade, was taken.

These frequencies were reduced to percentages and the co¬ 
efficients of normality found as in the previous chapter. They were 
as follovis: Central European —,,.23; Scandinavian 0.0; Teutonic —.35 
Homan tic — .05. For the whole group it was —.33. 

These indices are not ambiguous. In not one case is the co¬ 
efficient positive. In other words, not one group does on the aver¬ 
age better than the population from which they are selected; and 
only one, the Scandinavian, does as well. That, incidentally, being j 
the smallest group is the one that gives us the least reliable co¬ 
efficient. A larger sampling might prove it to be definitely in¬ 
ferior to the general population. And since these groups are below 
the average of which they themselves formed a part, they are even 
farther below their classmates who speak only English.

The literature on this, as on other phases of vocabulary 
study, is meagre; nevertheless our results corroborate those of 
previous investigators* In the Journal of Educational Psycho logy, 
vol. 24, 1933, page 696 ,there is an article entitled ,,r fhe Essay 
Versus the Objective Examination .As Measures of the Achievement of 
Bi-lingual Children'*, by Floyd F. Caldwell and Mary D® Moury. Six 
hundred and forty-three children in Grades III to Till inclusive 
were tested and divided into two groups, Spanish-speaking and Eng¬ 
lish-speaking* The children were tested in the fields of English 
and History by means of both an essay and an objective examination* 
Concerning the comparative achievements in the field of English, 
the results are summarized as follows; "The median scores of the 
Anglo-American children on objective and essay tests in English exc 
e@d those of the Spanish-American children by 18*1 percent and 28*6 
percent, respectively,*,*®*" 

Another recent study in this field is reported in the Journal 
of Educational Research, vol 27, 1934, under the title of "The Eng¬ 
lish Handicap of Junior High-School Pupils from Foreign Speaking 
Homes, and Remedial Measures", by Ralph A* Fritz and Nellie R« 
Rankin.* Two hundred and one students of Arma, Hansas, were tested, 
the tests comprising the Otis 3elf-Administering Mental Test, The 
New Stanford Achievement Test, and the Sim’s Socio-Economic Score 
Card* The first method was to compare the two groups, English and 
foreign speaking; the second to compare pairs matched for intellig¬ 
ence of social and economic environment. Part of their results are

Both by the method of comparing whole groups and the method 
of matched pairs these investigators come to the conclusion that 
foreign children suffer a handicap in school work, and that this 
handicap is greater in English than in other fields. A plan for 
remedial teaching is evolved, with particular stress on oral and 
written composition. Bo doubt such a policy would be very sound in 
Alberta, where apparently the foreign speaking children are also 
deficient in English, and where there are so many of them,almost 
twenty per cent of the population studied.

CHAPTER VIII 

REjjATIGH3H1P BETWEEN INTELLIGENCE ALL VOCABULARY 

Earlier the assumption was made that there Is probably som© 
relationship existing between inherent or native intelligence of a 
pupil^the excellence or reverse of his score on the vocabulary test. 
To discover the extent of this relationship, the scores of as many 
students as possible on the Otis Self-Administering Mental Test 
were procured. With some exceptions, this test was given to the 
students at about the same time as the Vocabulary test. However, 
the Intelligence Quotients of most of the students from Lamont were 
obtained from the Alberta School of Education survey of the schools 
in that town made in March, 1934. About half the I.Q. ! s of the 
Strathcona High School in Edmonton were obtained from the record 
cards of the pupils in the school files. Care was taken, however, 
to select only those obtained on the Otis Test. In some cases, 
these were two or three years old, but as the Intelligence Quotient 
is considered constant for any given purpose, these were accepted* 

In Salemead Rural High School this was written by the students in 
the autumn of 1934, and these results used. 

In Grades VII and VIII the Intermediate Examination, Form B, 
was used, while in the high school grades Form B of the Higher Exam¬ 
ination. Although most teachers allowed the students thirty minutes 
in which to answer the test, a few classes were allowed only twenty 
minutes. As the test is standardized to both time limits, this is 
immaterial.

In analyzing the data obtained from these tests, all scores 
were translated in equivalents of the absolute score on the Higher 
Examination. For the Intermediate Examination this was done by 
means of the tables which appear on the Interpretation Chart for 
Higher Examination; which chart has been included as Table 12# The 
same procedure was used to convert twenty minute scores Into thirty 
minute scores. Where the I.Q. alone was obtained, as from Lament and; 

certain cases in Strathcona High School, the pupil's age was consid¬ 
ered to be one half year more than that obtained on his last birth¬ 
day. Then, on the same chart his I.Q. was found and the appropriate 
score obtained. This would no doubt introduce a few errors by plac- 

ing some pupils too high and others too low, but these errors would 

. 

compensate each other. 

The reason for using the Higher Examination score or equiv¬ 
alent was that it was desired to have a measure of the student’s 
absolute mental ability without reference to chronological age. On 
the same chart Binet Mental Age equivalents are given and these might 
have been used. However, this was not done as the distance from one 
year to the next is not constant. For instance, the distance from 
a mental age of nine to that of ten is represented by fonr seven ty- 

! 

fifths of the total score, whereas the distance from a mental age of ; 
sixteen to one of seventeen is represented by eight sev©nty-fifths 
of the total score. Vocabulary and intelligence score were ob¬ 
tained from four hundred and ninety-two pupils, the coefficient of 
correlation between^hem computed. Letting 9 stand for the score 

obtained on the Otis Test and V for that obtained <|n the Vocabulary

flie coefficient of correlation so obtained is very much higher 
than that derived between ¥ocabulary Score and chronological age. 
Moreover, the Probable Error is relatively small, and the chances 
are fifty out of one hundred that the correlation lies between r + 

1 P.E. and r - 1 P.E.; or between .6 14 and .650. To go still fur¬ 
ther, the chances are ninety nine out of one hundred that the true 
r lies between r + 4 P.E. and r - 4 P.E.; or between .560 and .704. 

In other words, we have a "reasonable” sureness that it lies between 
the limits indicated (Camp, page 263). This is very much greater 
than the coefficient of correlation between vocabulary score and 
chronological age, and indicates that a child*s vocabulary depends 
much more upon his mental maturity than upon the length of time 

he has been in the world.

The two regression equations give up the vocabulary score a 
child should attain, given a definite intelligence score; and the 
intelligence score corresponding to his vocabulary score. These 
have been translated into Mental Age terms, the value for the mean 
of d being taken from the Interpretation Chart mentioned above. It 
is permissible so to translate these equations as the regression co¬ 
efficients do not cl^end on the Otis score, but wholly on the distrib 
ution of the frequencies. In this form they are more valuable than 
in the other, for insofar as the m.a. obtained from this intellig¬ 
ence test corresponds to the m.a. of other tests, these equations 
will apply to them. The lines which these two equations represent, 
as well as the column and row means, or intelligence and vocabulary 
means respectively, have been pjotted in Diagram XX* 

The measures of linearity of regression derived from the 
correlation ratios, are materially less than these measurejwith 
respect to the computations on vocabulary score and chronological 
age. This means that the column means cluster more cicely around 
the regression lines, and this is evident from Diagram XX • Here, 
as in Chapter V, the extremities of the distribution are rather 
irregular, this being no doubt due to the paucity of eases. In 
short,oroficiency in vocabulary depends much more upon mental than 
chronological age. 

So far w§ have assumed our populations to be drawn from a 
universe in which the various measure studied are distributed accord 
ing to the normal law, and we have normalized our distributions on

the basis of that assumption* However, we do know that the distrib¬ 
ution of intelligence follows this law very closely and so we are 
enabled to test our sample by means of the dhi test. This is des¬ 
cribed by Gamp in his "Elementary Statistics", page 264 et seq. 
Speaking of if, he says "It should not be applied, without some mod¬ 
ification to cases where the universe is partly inferred from the 
sample". 

Therefor© it is quite applicable here. The distribution of 
the Otis scores was tested by means of it, and it tells, using Gamp* 
condensed tables, that we may expect to get a sample as far from per 
feet as this one from 91.6 to 98.3 percent of the time; or interpol¬ 
ating in the tables, 95.2 percent of the time. Just how perfect it 
is we shall see he low. However, there is certainlyno reason for 
suspecting that it is not a truly random sample of the population 
studied; and since it is a random sample with respect to the intell¬ 
igence test, we may infer that it is to a great extent with respect 
to the vocabulary test, remembering, however, that here we encounter 
bilingualism and other factors which do not affect a person 1 s inw 
telligence (although they may affect his manifestation thereof) but 
do influence his vocabulary. The distribtuion of the Otis scores 
for the whole four hundred and ninety-two cases is indicated in 
Diagram XXI, while the analogous distribution of vocabulary scores 
is shown in Diagram XXII. 

As mentioned above, all students were considered to be ex¬ 
actly six months older than they were on their last birthday. The

variates were than grouped according to age, grade and Otis score; 
and the scores were so arranged that the variates automatically fell 
into groups with an I*Q* of 100 - 110, 110 - 120, and so on; the 
I*Q. limits "being chosen from Diagram IX with the assumption that 
all students were six months past their birthday* An illustration 
will probably make this clearer, so below is given as an example 
the distribution of all students sixteen years old and in Grade XII*

The frequencies were then collected by grades and by ages, so 
that two tables were derived, distribution of I.Q*®s by grades, and 
distribution of I*Q* ! s by ages* These distributions are shown in 
Tables Xa and Xb respectively* On these tables, "Delta' 1 stands 
for the coefficient of normality/'# 

Since mental growth after eighteen and indeed after an 
earlier age in the opinion of some psychologists is very gradual, 
all frequencies above seventeen years have been grouped together* 

At the lower end of the scale the group limits for the age 
of eleven years, six months, had to be extrapolated, but this seamed 
reasonably accurate, using Table lx* 

In all, four hundred and ninety*-nine intelligence scores' 
were tabulated; this being somewhat more than in the correlation. 
Seven students in the classes tested wrote the intelligence test 
but not the vocabulary test*

Sandiford tells us (Educational Psychology, page 162) that 
in a normal population, thirty percent of the cases have an I.Q. of 
100 to 110, thirteen percent from 110 to 120, six percent from 120 to 
130, one percent above 130; and corresponding percentages for I.Q. 1 s 
below one hundred. Upon these facts has been founded our method of 
deriving of coefficients of normality for our various ages and grades 
In chapters six, and seven, the coefficient of normality was derived 
from the relative frequencies measured in terms of sigmas above and 
below the mean. However, our coefficient is a versatile animal, 
and is equally applicable here. Using the same system as previously, 
but measuring our relative frequencies from an I.Q. of 100, they 
were compared with the relative frequencies of I.Q.*s as stated in 
Sandiford. Since our coefficient is really a measure of difference 
between our sample and the theoretical universe from which it was 
drawn, it has for the time being been called delta. 

Our reason for tabulating our variates according to the 0 tis 
score rather than computing the I.Q. is that the limits to the 
classes fall between two even numbers. In the example shown above 
they fall at 70.1, 60.1, 50.1, etc. Since the Otis score is in 
even numbers, by this means we avoid having any of the cases fall¬ 
ing at exactly at an I.Q. of 140, 130, 120, etc., corresponding to 
the Otis scores just mentioned, and so there are no partial fre¬ 
quencies in any of the groups. 

Table X fa) shows us that for every grade except Grade X 
the coefficient of normality is positive, meaning that the intell¬ 
igence of the students in the grades is higher than that of the

whole population from which our universe is drawn* In Grade XII 
it is quite high, being .60. As this is indubitably the heaviest 
school year, it is natural that a higher than average intelligence 
is necessary to cope with it. In fact, the whole high school seems 
to be a continuously more selective factor in weeding out the duller 
students, who begin to drop out of school once they reach Grade VII 
or VIII. This does not account for the high coefficients in Grades 
VII and VIII or at least only partially. It was surmised in Chapter 
V that whatever academic acceleration fakes place occurs below these 
grades, so that we have here a certain number of young and clever 
students. Table X (b) reveals this to be the case, as the delta 
from elven and one half to thirteen and one half years run from 1.00 
to .55 respectively. At the eleven and one half year level, however, 
there are only five students, which is too small a number to permit 
generalizations. 

In Diagram XIX it was shown that the age means on the voc¬ 
abulary Test were in the lower grades studied considerably above the 
corresponding grade means, and it was suspected that the younger 
pupils were accelerated and therefore influencing grade means above 
those corresponding to their own ages, how we know that the younger 
pupils are considerably above the average in Intelligence Quotients, 
and this is no doubt what has happened. 

It is rather surprising that the deltas both for Grade X and 
for the corresponding age (16-f) are below the deltas for the grades 
immediately above and below. We find what is presumably a result of 
this in Diagram XVIII, where there is a sudden drop in the third

inter¬ 
quartile for Grade IX, and this is reflected in the semi-/quartile 

range for this grade. 

In discussing the age means of the vocabulary scores, the 
hypothesis was made that these means were unduly lowered hy the less 
hrilliant students being retarded in the higher grades while their 
more brilliant contemporaries have passed on to other fields of end¬ 
eavor. Had the coefficient of normality of the intelligence quot¬ 
ients for these years been negative, this hypothesis would have 
been directly corroborated. Since, however, for both seventeen and 
one-half years, and for more than seventeen and one-half years it is 
positive, it would seem that our hypothesis is fallacious. Such, 
however, is not necessarily so, for while those still in Grade XII 
are bright, those of the same age who have already graduated from 
this grade may be even more so. This is indicated by two facts, 
ffirst, the delta of intelligence quotients drops from .29 to .06 in 
progressing from an age of seventeen and one-Half to higher ages, 
indicating that the more clever of these older students have already 
left school. Second, the delta for Grade XII, .60, is higher than 
for either of these age groups, indicating the presence of younger 
brighter students advancing rapidly through their academic career. 

But if the grade norms for the Vocabulary Test, especially 
at the higher levels are too low, the age norms ar€ probably too 
high. They are applicable no doubt to students in the grades studied 
but since students in these grades are somewhat more intelligent 
than the average of mankind, these age norms should not be applied 
either to students below Grade VII, or to children who have left

school before completing a reasonable amount of high school work* 

In discussing the low scores obtained by bilingual students, 
it was suggested that, since the Otis Test is entirely a reading 
test, should these students obtain low scores on the Otis Test, that 
might be due to a deficiency in English rather than a meagre accomp¬ 
lishment in English being due to a low intelligence* 

The Otis scores of eighty-two bilingual students were 
studied by dividing them into I*Q.®s as was done with all the scores 
above, and it was found that on the average bilingual students do 
make lower than normal scores on the Otis Test* The Central European 
group, comprising forty-seven cases is the only one large enough to 
consider separately. For this group the Coefficient of Normality 
on the Otis Test is -.26, compared to 1*35 on the Vocabulary Test* 

For the whole bilingual population, the delta for the Otis Test was 
-.07, compared to -.22 on the Vocabulary Test* Although the two 
groups are not wholly comparable, the Otis group comprising only 
about seventy-five percent of Vocabulary group; admitting that the 
Otis test is a true measure of the mentality of bilingual students, 
it would seem that the bilingual children are hampered on the Voc¬ 
abulary Test beyond the amount which would be expected from their 
lower intelligence* This is so because both for the Central Europ¬ 
ean group and especially for the whole forsign-speaking group, the 
deltas for the Vocabulary Test are appreciably lower than for Otis 
Test*

CHAPTER IX 


SEX DIFFERENCES IN VOCABULARY. 


It is not pretended that this section is an exhaustive 
and complete inquiry into the problem of vocabulary differences 
between the two sexes. It was not expected that any great differ¬ 
ence would be found, and accordingly only a superficial examination 
of the problem has been attempted. 

The method used was that of matched pairs. In matching a 
boy with a girl, rather rigorous requirements had to be met. Both 
had to have passed the same birthday, i.e*, they had to be within a 
year of each other in chronoligcal age® They were chosen from the 
same school, the same grade, and the same occupational group. 
Students speaking English only were considered* Finally, the great¬ 
est difference in the Otis score allowed between each member of the 
pair was three, representing a difference in the mental age of six 
to eight months. The various pairs are represented below, with the 
respective scores. To obtain the differences, the girlfe score was 
subtracted from the boy’s*

One would naturally expect that a person who did very 
well on the Vocabulary Test would also excell in other branches 
of English* An effort was made to discover if this was so, and 
to what extent* 

The scores obtained by the students in Grades VII, VIII, 
and IX on the Hew Stanford Reading Test were studied. Although 
this test is designed primarily for Grades IV to IX, it has age 
norms up to the age of nineteen years, two months, and It was the 
original intention to give this test to all the students. However, 
it was soon seen that from Grade X up most students obtained al¬ 
most perfect scores on this test, and as it did not measure any 
differences in ability in the higher grades, the test was admin¬ 
istered to only some of the students in these grades, and even 
these scores have been discarded. 

As this test was administered during February, the norm 
would be for Grade 7.5, 8.5 or 9.5 as the case might be. The 
means and medians of all the students tested in these grades were 
found and the results were as follows:

Taking either the mean or the median, as the average 
score, the norm seems satisfactory for Grade VII students, a 
trifle low for Grade VIII and very much too low for Grade IX. 

The norms given stop at Grade 10.0, where the norm is 102, so we 
see that according to the Hew Stanford Reading Test, the Grade 
IX students are accelerated to the extent of one whole grade. 

In the higher grades the discrepancy was even worse, scores fre¬ 
quently being above the entire range of the norms. 

There may be several reasons for these discrepancies. 
Canadian students may be better trained in reading than their 
American contemporaries. Methods of teaching reading may have 
improved to such an extent in the last few years as to make the 
norms obsolete. This is at least plausible in view of the great 
strides forward that have been made in the scientific study of 
this subject. And because the given norms above Grad® 8.4 and a 
score of 92 have been extrapolated, error in computing them might 
easily enter. 

The Hew Stanford Reading Test is divided into two sections, 
and so arranged that equivalent scores on each test represent equiv¬ 
alent standards of achievement. In determining the averages above 
the arithmetical mean of the two scores was used. The first part 
of the test is on paragraph meaning. The subjects read paragraphs 
that became increasingly difficult, and in the last sentence, 
there are one or more blanks to fill in, this testing comprehension 
of the matter read. There are eighty such blanks and twenty five 
minutes is allowed to complete this section of the test. Although

Although in half the cases the girls are superior to the 
boys, yet the highest vocabulary difference in favour of a girl (9) 
is equalled by one boy and exceeded by four, only one having a diff¬ 
erence of less than nine over his mate where he is superior at all. 
Moreover, the average difference in mental ages is scarcely equiva¬ 
lent to one week against the girls, whe^lts the average difference in 
vocabulary score is equivalent to about one year in favour of the 
boys* Although these differences may be due to chance, considering 
the fewness of cases, considering the size of the vocabulary average 
difference, it seems unlikely. We cannot say that more boys than 
girls do well on this test, but when the boys do exceed the girls, 
they do so by a substantial margin* Perhaps this is due to the boys 
having a wider range of interest than the girls, such as in sport, 
mechanics, adventure, etc. However, a more thorough investigation is 
necessary before our information can be considered wholly reliable.

this is theoretically a purely objective test, in practice it is 
not perfectly so, as it is often difficult when a child gives an 
unorthodox response to decide whether he has understood what he 
has read or not* 

The second part of the test, for which ten minutes are 
allowed, is a word test* It consists of eighty very short sent¬ 
ences in which the last word must be chosen by underlining from 
five choices presented, and so is very similar to our Vocabulary 
Test, but much less difficult* 

Two hundred and twenty-seven students in the Grades VII, 
VIII, and IX answered both the Reading and the Vocabulary Tests, 
giving us two scores on the former and one on the latter* Each of 
these scores was correlated with the other two* The highest co¬ 
efficient of correlation obtained was between the Vocabulary Test 
and the Word Section of the Reading Test, being .85 & .012* It is 
not surprising that the greatest concomitance should be found be¬ 
tween these two tests, as they both measure the same thing; but it 
is very gratifying that the correlation should be so high with such 
a relatively low probable error, as this gives us evidence as to 
the reliability of our test beyond that furnished by the Thorndike 
Test of Word knowledge* 

The next highest coefficient of correlation was that between 
the two sections of the Reading Test, being .81 i *016* The two 
sections of the test measure abilities that are somewhat different 
yet with many elements in common, and accordingly this coefficient 
is indicative as to the validity of the two tests*

The lowest coefficient although still high, being .78 ± 

£17 was that between the Vocabulary Tost and the paragraph section 
of the Reading Test. Comparing this with the coefficient between 
the two sections of the reading test, we may safely say that the 
Vocabulary Test is almost if not quite equal in validity to the 
word section of the Reading Test. Indeed, considering the Probable 
Errors, it may easily happen that further study would prove the 
Vocabulary Test to be fully as valid as the Reading Test. 

It is interesting to note that the students tested did 
somewhat better and with less deviation on the paragraph than on 
the word section of the Reading Test. The respective means for 
the two sections were 96.02 and 93.07; the respective sigmas 12.8 
and 14.00. 

The coefficient of correlation between the Vocabulary Score 

and the Hudolson composition score was also obtained. In this case 

who 

only those students A wrote the Vocabulary Test in February and the 
composition in October were considered, but as there were four hun¬ 
dred and twenty-two of these, the sample is amply large. . 

The coefficient of correlation here was found to be .66 i: .019. 

That this is lower than those obtained with respect to the Reading 
Test is not surprising. In the first place, the subjectivity of 
scoring the compositions makes complete accuracy impossible. The 
very fact that the Hudelson score is obtained by a scale rather than 
a test might raise doubts as to the soundness of correlating the 
Hudelson and the Vocabulary scores by the product moment method of 
correlation. However, the Hudelson rating is supposed to measure

composition merit quantitatively, so this procedure was thought 
permissible* 

Another reason why we should not expect a high correlation 
between the Hudelson rating and the Vocabulary score is that comp¬ 
osition merit depends on many things besides extent of vocabulary. 

One with a meagre vocabulary may work carefully with close atten¬ 
tion to spelling and other mechanical details, and so achieve a 
high score. On the other hand, a clever student, bored with the 
whole proceeding, may write carelessly, with but little consider¬ 
ation to punctuation and grammar. 

Considering these things, the coefficient obtained is really 
quite high and speaks well for the Hudelson scale, despite its 
imperfections. 

The scores obtained on the Vocabulary Test were also comp¬ 
ared with the written vocabulary as shown by the themes themselves. 
The more words a person uses that are not in the most common five 
hundred, the richer in general we may assume is his vocabulary of 
expression. Accordingly the number of words chosen from the most 
common five hundred is a rough inverse measure of the extent of 
the expressive vocabulary. This number was accordingly correlated 
with the vocabulary score. The same compositions were used here as 
were used in finding the coefficient of correlation between the 
Hudelson score and the Vocabulary test, so that with over four 
hundred cases the sample may be considered adequate. The coeff¬ 
icient was found to be -.22 ± *051. There is apparently only a 
very slight connection between the words a child knows and those 
he uses. This is what we should expect, in view of the fact that

growth in written vocabulary, as shown in Diagram VIII, IZ, 
and Z, is very slow indeed*

CHAPTER XI 

CONCLUSION 


The results of this summary may he recapitalized very 
"briefly. By the time a child has reached Grade Vii f his voca¬ 
bulary that he uses in every day life is practically complete, 
and there is henceforth very little growth and transfer of words 
from recognition only to use. Furthermore, about eighty percent 
of the words he uses <come from the most common five hundred in 
the language. This may go up to as high as ninety-five or as low' 
as sixty percent, but such cases are exceptional. Perhaps this 
is as it should be, and certainly one is in no dangerof being 
misunderstood when one sticks to such common words. If this is 
a desirable state of affairs, however, much time spent in learning 
the spelling and inflections of the more uncommon words might con¬ 
ceivably be used to better advantage in practising using such words. 

The growth in recognized vocabulary is much more encourag¬ 
ing. As on the average one word in our test represents two hundred 
in the Word Book, in the grades studied growth in recognized voc¬ 
abulary takes place at the rate of about one thousand words a year 
or more. However, there are wide variations within each grade; 
only about twenty percent of the students being at their own grade 
level, with about forty percent below and forty percent above the 
grade level. 

These variations are due to many factors, perhaps the chief 
of which is the inherent intelligence of the pupils. Chronological 
age plays some slight part, and perhaps sex also. Environment, as

as revealed by the parent* s occupation is quite important, the 
children coming from professional homes having a great advantage 
over those from farm homes, for instance. The fact that bilingual 
children are definitely weaker in their accomplishment in the Voc¬ 
abulary Test indicates that familiarity with the language plays 
an important part in the acquisition of new words, as w v ould norm¬ 
ally be expected. Therefore, the teacher of foreign-speaking stu¬ 
dents should make extra efforts to compensate for this handicap 
by frequent practice in written and oral composition and by as much 
time devoted to supplementary reading as possible. Proficiency 
in the use of the language would seem to be more important than 
mechanical excellence, desirable as that may be, 

Excellence in recognized vocabulary is accompanied by ex¬ 
cellence in other fields of English, notably reading. This is no 
doubt true as these two skills are greatly interlinked and largely 
dependent upon one another. And in general those who know the most 
words will express themselves better than those who do not, but 
they will not use a greater variets^ of words to do so, or at least 
only to a small extent. 

The vocabulary test designed for this work seems to he a 
good measuring tool and well adapted to the high school grades. It 
seems to be well graded in difficulty to show differences in ability 
and is difficult for even the most proficient high school student. 
This Is shown by the faot that out of over five hundred cases, not 
one student made a perfect score, and only two reached ninety-five or

over. It possesses a high degree of validity, and would seem to he 
very reliable. The test is easily understood and can be answered 
quickly. The scoring can also be done very rapidly; much more so 
than for any of the other tests used in this study. 

Tentative grade norms have been established, and also age 
norms, but the latter appear to be too high at the lower levels 
studied and too low at the upper levels. These could be adjusted 
at the bottom by obtaining scores from children of normal ability in 
the grades below Grade YII, and corrected for the top possibly by 
using scores obtained by University and Normal school students, and 
by students in technical institutes and agricul tural schools. 

Many courses are open for investigation in this field. In 
the first place, it would seem necessary to obtain norms for the 
American tests used that are locally applicable, and probably for 
other tests of similar nature. The Hudelson norms in the lower 
ranges and the New Stanford Reading norms in the upper ones seem 
especially unsuitable. 

There also seems to be a place for a reading comprehension 
test similar to the New Stanford, but much more difficult. This 
might be obtained by using technical material and material dealing 
with abstractions, although probably in such cases, native intelli¬ 
gence would become increasingly more important. 

A thorough study of the handicap suffered by bilingual 
students and remedial measures to overcome them would be a valuable 
contribution to educational science, especially in a country like

this where so many students come from foreign-speaking homes. 

In such an investigation, French students should especially he 
studied, if only for the reason that French is a Canadian lang¬ 
uage as much as English. It would also he interesting to know 
how French-speaking bilingual students compare, with respect to 
their command of French, with those who speak and use that 
language only.
