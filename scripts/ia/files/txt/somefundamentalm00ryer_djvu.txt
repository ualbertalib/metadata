PART I 


INTRODUCTION 

The synthesis of hydrocarbons in the gasoline range was 
first investigated by Fischer and Tropsch in 192$. Synthesis gas, 
consisting of carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the ratio of is2, 
when passed over a cobalt, nickel or iron catalyst formed hydrocar¬ 
bons with a small amount of oxygenated compounds. The optimum 
conditions found were a temperature of 200°C. and a moderate 
pressure between one atmosphere and seven atmospheres. In 193ii 
Ruhrchemie undertook industrial development of the process and by 
1936 the first industrial plant was in operation. By 19h0, one 
million tons per year of synthetic hydrocarbons were being produced. 
Plants were also built in France, Japan, Manchukuo and planned for 
other areas. Today commercial plants using natural gas and oxygen 
as raw materials are planned for gas fields in the United States. 

The original purpose of the Fischer Tropsch process was 
to produce liquid hydrocarbons for internal combustion engines. 

These are still the most important products, but the by-products 
are important for the production of aliphatic compounds for chemical 
industry. 

However, no fundamental knowledge of the requirements 
for a good catalyst was available and a method of trial and error 
had been used exclusively in the early work of Fischer and his 
co-workers. 

Not only the composition of the catalyst and the supporting 
medium but also the conditions of pressure, rate of gas flow, and 
indeed the whole synthesis procedure as first evolved was based on

purely empirical data. On this basis the German industries designed their 
practical, though probably uneconomic plants. However, before lihglish and 
American capital could be interested in similar plants, more knowledge 
of the process was necessaiy. Cost and efficiency factors which the 
Germans could afford to ignore in their great need for hydrocarbon 
fuel could not be ignored by companies which must compete both with 
crude oil and with other possible synthesis processes. 

With this incentive in mind many approaches to the problem 
have been pursued in recent years. These studies have not only been 
directed towards finding new catalysts but also towards obtaining a 
better understanding of the catalysts already known. 

The work carried out by Boomer and others at the University 
of Alberta has primarily been aimed at determining the activity of 
new catalysts and the conditions under which they would operate most 
satisfactorily. 

In the investigation reported here a measurement of the 
surface area of a catalyst with a bentonite carrier was made. This 
property was compared with that of a catalyst with a kieselguhr 
carrier. The catalytic activity was compared with that of other 
catalysts containing different carriers. 

The rates of decomposition of various oxygenated compounds 
over a cobalt catalyst have been determined together with their acti¬ 
vation energies. It was hoped that the information might aid in 
determining the mechanism of the synthesis reaction. 





THE THEORY OF ADSORPTION 


Adsorption^ is an increase in the concentration of a 
substance on a surface or at the boundary of two phases. The type 
of adsorption occurring most frequently is positive in character and 
corresponds to an increase in the concentration at the boundary. 

When the adsorbed substance does not remain at the boundary but is 
carried into the adsorbent, the phenomena is known as absorption or 
sorption, corresponding to a solution in the interior of the adsorbent. 
The term sorption is often applied to gases adsorbed either on carbon 
or on metals. Absorption on or solution in metals corresponds to 
an occlus5_on. 

Adsorption negative in character is rare. Negative adsorp¬ 
tion takes place when the solvent for the substance to be adsorbed 
is to a great extent adsorbed itself. Typical examples of this occur 
in the use of gels. 

( 2 ) 

The solid that takes up the gas or vapor is called the 
adsorbent. The gas or vapor attached to the surface of the solid is 
called the adsorbate. If the gas enters the inside of a solid, two 
things may happen. Either the gas merely dissolves in it, forming 
a solid solution, or it reacts with the solid and forms a compound. 

If the gas remains attached to the surface of the solid, again two 
things may happen. First, there may be a weak interaction between 
solid and gas, similar to condensation, or, second, there may be a 
strong interaction, similar to chemical reactions. The former is 
called physical adsorption or Van der Waal’s adsorption, and the 
latter is called chemical adsorption or chemisorption. Van der Waal’s 
adsorption implies that the same forces that are active in condensation. 



that is, the Van der Waal*a forces, are also active in physical 
adsorption. 

When a gas or vapor is admitted to a thoroughly evacuated 
adsorbent its molecules distribute themselves between the gas phase 
and the adsorbed phase. The disappearance of the molecules from the 
gas phase occurs with great rapidity in some cases, in others at a 
measurable rate. After a while the procsss stops and a state of 
stable equilibrium is reached. The amount of ga3 adsorbed per gram 
of adsorbent at equilibrium is a function of the temperature, the 
pressure and the nature of the adsorbent and the adsorbate. 

For a given gas and. unit weight of a given adsorbent the 
amount of ga3 adsorbed at equilibrium is a function of the final 
pressure and temperature only. 

(1) a s t ( p,T ) 

where a = the amount adsorbed per gram of adsorbent, 
p = the equilibrium pressure, 

T a the absolute temperature 

When the pressure of the gas is varied and the temperature 
is kept constant, the plot of the amount adsorbed against the pressure 
i3 called the adsorption isotherm, and the equation is: 

(2) a « C ( p ) 

T = constant 

When the temperature is varied and the pressure kept constant 
one obtains the adsorption isobar. 

(3) a - f ( T ) 

p = constant, for the adsorption isostore, that is, the 
variation of the equilibrium pressure with respect to the temperature 
for a definite amount of gas adsorbed*

At constant temperature the adsorption of a gas or vapor 
increases v/ith increasing pressure. In Fig. 1 adsorption isotheras 
of ammonia on charcoal are shown.

Fig. 1 

The above curves represent pure physical adsorption, 
even at highest temperatures. 

Since the adsorption process is always exothermic, the 
amount adsorbed at equilibrium must always decrease with increasing 
temperature according to the principle of Le Ch&telier. Fig. 1 
shows that this is actually the caset the lower the temperature 
the greater the adsorption. At small adsorptions the volume increases 






































linearly with pressure. The 15>1.?°C. isotherm obeys Henry* s Law* 

v * kp 

where v is the volume adsorbed, 
p is the pressure 

At somewhat higher adsorptions for equal increments of 
p the increments of v become smaller and smaller. The volume 
adsorbed becomes proportional to a power of the gas pressure 
smaller than unity.

where n is greater than 1. This is the Freund!ich isotherm 
equation. The factor n is not constant over any large pressure 
range. The Freundlich equation expresses satisfactorily the adsorption 
of a gas over a small range of pressure but has not any fundamental 
significance. It is particularly useful as an interpolation equation 
where it can be made to fit the experimental data. 

In 1915 two entirely independent theories were proposed 
by Polanyi and by Langmuir. Their approach was different. Langmuir 
believed that the adsorption was a chemical process and that the 
adsorbed layer was unimolecular. Polanyi believed the adsorption 
was a physical process and that the adsorbed phase was many layers 
thick. Both treatments were successful in many instances and both 
have their limitations* The Polanyi theory applies to Van der 
Waal*s adsorption only, the Langmuir theory applies within limits 
to both chemical and physical adsorption. 

Langmuir made three assumptions as the basis of his 
derivative: 

(1) That the attraction between the molecules is less than 
the attraction between a molecule and the adsorbing surface.

(2) That the probability of evaporation of a molecule from 
the surface is the same whether the neighboring positions are 
filled or not. 

(3) That molecules striking adsorbed molecules are elastically 
reflected and only those striking the bare surface have a chance 

to be adsorbed. 

Therefore the Langmuir ^^ adsorption isotherm may be 
written as: 

a P 

y - -- 

IfbP 


where y = amount of gas adsorbed per unit area or per unit mass 
of adsorbent. 

P = oressure 


b = k 


1 constants of proportionality 


a = constant 

’a* and *b* are evaluated from experimental data. 

Polanyi assumed that the adsorbed gas acts as a compressed 
film on the surface and obeys the same equation of state as in the 
gas phase, he derived equations for expressing ( , the potential 

as a function of fl } the volume adsorbed. The ( , 0 curve is 

independent of temperature. It can be plotted from one experimentally 
determined isotherm and other isotherms plotted from it. Although 
the physical concept of adsorption upon which this theory is based 
has been discarded, it does correctly express the temperature 
dependence of adsorption for the system to which it is ^plicable. 

The capillary condensation theory attributes adsorption to 
condensation of the gas in the capillaries of the adsorbent. It has 
long been known that a liquid wetting the wall of a capillary has a 
lower vapor pressure in the capillary than in the normal bulk nhase. 







' 









* 




» f 



























This behavior was extrapolated to capillaries of molecular dimen¬ 
sions. Zsigmondy assumed that in such very small capillaries 
condensation can take place at pressures considerably lower than 
the normal vapor pressure# The capillaries at the smallest radii 
fill at the lowest pressure. As the pressure is Increased, always 
larger capillaries fill, until finally at the saturation pressure 
all the pores of the adsorbent fill with liquid. 

Another theory based on the assumption that physical 
adsorption is more than one molecular layer thick is the polariza¬ 
tion theory proposed by de Boer and Zwikker in 1929* It explains 
the adsorption of non-polar molecules on ionic adsorbents by 
assuming that the uppermost layer of the adsorbent induces dipoles 
in the first layer of adsorbed molecules which in turn induce dipoles 

in the next layer and so on until several layers are built up. 

(3) 

Brunauer, 3nmet and Teller in 193$ proposed that the 
same forces that produce condensation are also chiefly responsible 
for the binding energy of multimoleeular adsorption, which shall be 
called the multimoleeular adsorption. 

According to both the polarization theory and the multi- 
molecular adsorption theory the force? involved in adsorption are 
short range forces, that is, only the first adsorbed layer is 
attracted strongly by the surface. The second layer is adsorbed 
essentially, not by the surface, but by the first adsorbed layer 
and the adsorption propagates from layer to layer. The two theories 
differ from each other with respect to the type of forces that are 
assumed to produce the adsorption. According to the polarization 
theory adsorption is due to induced dipoles. According to the multi- 
molecular adsorption theory it is due to the totality of forces

Brunauer, Qnmet and Teller in 193$ proposed a theory of 
multimolecular adsorption which is now generally accepted as a good 
approximation in most cases. 

The following isotherm equation was derived for multi-

v ( P 0 -P ) ~P(T 


obtains a straight line whose slope and intercept give the values 
of v R and G. The surface area of the adsorbent can be calculated 
from a knowledge of the size of the adsorbed molecule. 

If the adsorption takes place in a limited space, so that 
even at saturation pressure only a limited number of layers can be 
adsorbed on the adsorbent, one obtains the expression:

A search in the literature on the Van der Waal f s adsorption 
of gases reveals that there exist five different types of isotherms* 



?• to 


Fig. 2 

Type 1 is the well known Langmuir adsorption isotherm. 
Equation (C) describes a Type 1 isotherm, and equations 
(A) and (B) describe Type II isotherms where C >> 1 or E^, 

(heat of adsorption of the gas in the first layer), is greater than 
Ej^, (heat of liquefaction of the gas) 5 in other words, when the 















. 

. 












attractive forces between adsorbed gas and adsorbent are greater 
than the attractive forces between the molecules of the gas in the 
liquefied state. It should be noted, however, that when the forces 
between adsorbent and adsorbate are small, that is, when < E^— 

then equations (A) and (B) describe type III isotherm. The point 
, A I on the curve of Type II isotherm indicates the completion of the 
first layer of molecules. 

•types IV and V suggest that the complete, or almost complete, 
filling of the pores and capillaries of the adsorbent occurs at a 
pressure lower than the vapor pressure of the gas. This lowering of 
the vapor pressure indicates that as the pressure of the gas is 
increased some additional forces appear that make the heat of adsorption 
or energy of binding in some higher layer to be greater than E^, the 
heat of liquefaction of the gas. This must be necessarily so, since 
the last adsorbed layer in a capiilaiy is attracted on both sides, 
and therefore its heat of evaporation must be greater than that of 
any other layer, with the possible exception of the first layer 
where the adsorptive forces are very different, types IV and V show- 
evidences that capillary condensation is occurring at pressures less 
than the vapor pressure of the liquid. The simple expression of 
B.E.T. equation does not apply to these rather rare cases. The 
equation derived by Brunauer, Unmet and Teller for these cases is 
much more complex and involved. Three further assumptions to those 
already used are: 


1. That the capillaries are of uniform size. 

2. That the walls of the capillaries are plane parallel surfaces 
3* That the capillaries are open on the sidesi 2 !)

As pointed out by Brunauer this theory is open to 
criticism, in that it has several limitations. At low pressures it 
reduces to the Langmuir equation, consequently all the criticism 
that has been levelled against the Langmuir theory can be directed 
equally well against the multimolecular adsorption theory in the 
low pressure region of the adsorption isotherm. The most active 
parts of the surfaces of most adsorbents are strongly heterogeneous, 
with strongly varying heats of adsorption, therefore the Langmuir 
equation is not obeyed. For most adsorbents the theory breaks down 
in the region from zero pressure to P - 0.05, and for some 

p o 

adsorbents as high as 0.10. 

The multimolecular adsorption theory is at its best in 

the middle adsoiption region, that is, the region proceeding and 

following the building up of a unimolccular layer. Since most 

adsorbents have capillaries that are at least several molecular 

diameters wide, the difficulties due to eapillaxy condensation do 

not yet begin to appear in this region. Thus the two-constant 

equation (A) is obeyed very closely for many adsorbents to at 

least P r 0.35 and sometimes to .50.

THE MEASURE ENT OF SURFACE AREAS 


porous materialare usually considered to have 
•inner 1 as well as »outer» surfaces. The * inner* surface comprises 
the surface of the cracks, crevices and capillaries that extend 
into the individual particles. The * outer* surface is, roughly- 
speaking, the portion of a porous material subjected to direct and 
free bombardment by the molecules of the enveloping gas. The * total* 
surface area refers to the sum of the areas of the * inner* and * outer* 
surfaces. 


It is at once evident that different values for the area 
of the total surface of a porous material are likely to be obtained 
depending upon the particular method used for making the measuremaits. 
The present discussion will, therefore, be restricted to those methods 
of measuring surface areas that depend upon measuring the volume of 
gas adsorbed by the solid catalyst. Such methods in general have the 
advantage of being applicable to all types of porous or finely divided 
catalysts, including those whose nature and surface might be altered 
by suspension in any of the liquid media that are common to a number 
of methods for measuring surface areas. 

If the volume of some gas such as nitrogen or argon required 
to form a physically adsorbed monolayer over the entire 'inner* and 
•outer* surface of a catalyst can be detemined, the total area can 
be calculated by multiplying the cross sectional area of each adsorbed 
molecule by the number of molecules in the monolayer. 

It is evidmt that the reliability of the method will depasd 
largely upon the accuracy with which one can choose the point on the 
isotherm corresponding to a monolayer. A multiplication of the 





































'

. 






















12 


(12) 

number of molecules required to form the single layer by the 
average area occupied by each adsorbed molecule yields a numerical 
value for the absolute area of a given weight of absorbent. The 
absolute surface area values obtained obviously depend upon the 
accuracy with which the point corresponding to a monomolecular adsorbed 
layer can be picked. Originally this point (designated as , A* in 
Isotherm II, Fig. 2), was selected empirically as the lower pressure 
extremity of the long linear portion of the experimental adsorption 
isotherm. 

Therefore if we write the B.E.T. equation in the form, 

p = 1 + ( F /v m ) 

V <V B b) 

it is obvious that a plot of p /v against p will be a straight 

line of slope — . The surface area can be calculated if the 
v m 

size of the adsorbed molecule is known. The above equation is, as 
previously noted, the Langmuir isotherm. 

Certain precautions are necessary in the choice of experi¬ 
mental conditions in order that v should represent a monomolecular 

m r 

layer over the whole surface and not just the more active parts. 

The adsorption should be measured at pressures close to the vapor 
pressure at any particular temperature, which means in most cases 
working at taaperatures only slightly higher than the boiling point 
at atmospheric pressure. 

Mien the isotherm is of iype II, the B.E.T. equation 
applies. The best range of application is of a relative pressure of 
.1 to .ii and at a temperature only slightly above the boiling 
point.

In this investigation all surface areas were measured 
using nitrogen as the adsorbed gas at a temperature of 83°K. At 
this temperature the vapor pressure of liquid nitrogen is l£8 cms. 
of Hg so that pressures between 15 and 70 cms. of Hg. are in 
the useful range of relative pressures of from 0.1 to O.iu 

Measurements of the surface areas of catalysts are important 
for several reasons. In the first place, they indicate the extent 
to which varying activity may be attributed to changes in surface 
areas. Secondly, the area values provide a means for determining 
whether promoters and supports improve catalysts by increasing or 
maintaining area or by qualitative changes that increase catalyst 
activity per unit surface area. 

For example, two catalysts of widely different areas may 
show the same activity per unit bulk or reactor volume or per unit mass. 
It is then essential to know the area difference because of the signi¬ 
ficance of the surface composition of the low area catalyst. Provided

the surfaces of the two catalysts have the same relative accessibility 
the surface of the low-area catalyst is qualitatively superior, as 
demonstrated by its greater activity per unit area (specific activity) 
It is also important to study the catalyst of greater area with 
respect to the preparation techniques responsible for the high area 
structure. It should thus be possible to combine this knowledge and 
incorporate the superior chemical or promoter composition in the 
structure of greater surface. The ultimate objective of such studies 
is to obtain a thermally stable catalyst of optimum specific activity 
and area. 

It has been shown that the surface area of a catalyst for 

the Fischer Tropsch reaction is a measure of the activity. However, 

( 21 ) 

in J. Roxburgh investigation, he indicated that the surface area 
is not a controlling factor, but it is assumed that a certain minimum 
area is necessary for an efficient catalyst.

A* Apparatus 

The apparatus used was an adaptation of that design first 
proposed bj Barnet for the study of adsorption. This is shown in 
Fig, 3, Storage bulbs A-B-C for the gases used in these sieasure- 
ments were connected by stopcocks, 1,2,3, to a vacuum line. This 
was connected through a stopcock, k» to a McLeod Gauge, and through 
stopcock 5 to a mercury diffusion pump backed by a rotary oil 
pump. Through stopcock $ the line, (1), was connected to the 
vacuus line and the gas storage brilbs, A mercury manometer, which 
could be evacuated through stopcocks $ and 7 was used to measure 
the pressure in this part of the system, A series of bulbs of known 
volume, I, II, XXI* IV, V, and the reaction chamber, 1, (which could 
be surrounded by an electric furnace or a vacuus flash), were con¬ 
nected to this manometer. 

The volume of the line fm& the manometer to stopcocks 7 
and 8, and the calibrated volumes, were calibrated, so that with the 
mercuiy level at known points between the bulbs, the volume of the 
system was accurately known, 

B, Preparation of Gases 

The gases used were nitrogen and helium. Nitrogen was 
tank nitrogen passed through a solution of CrClg# Fig, h, to remove 
traces of oxygen. The CrCl^ thus formed was reduced to CrClg by 
granular sine. The nitrogen was then passed through 
and Cad 0 to remove ary moisture. As a final precaution against 
any condensible gases and varors the nitrogen was passed through a 
liquid air trap.

C. Procedure 

i. preparation of Catalyst^ 10 ^~~The composition of catalyst 
f C f was: 

Co : ThOg 5 MgO : Bentonite — 100 : 6 j 12 : 200 
It was prepared by the rapid simultaneous mixing of boiling 
solutions of cobalt and thorium nitrates. 

irO grams Cobalt, 2.U grams ThQg per litre 
and sodium carbonate (88 grams NagCO^ per litre) and a warm aqueous 
suspension of magnesia and bentonite (both passed through 72 mesh 
B.S.S.)• 

.The mixture was boiled for two minutes with vigorous 
stirring, filtered rapidly, and the precipitate washed free from 
occluded salts with boiling distilled water. The filter cake was 
dried in air at 110°C. and graded into 7 - 1U B.S.S. granules. 

To aid in pelleting the catalyst, the dried catalyst was 
ground and mixed with 5 per cent graphite. The granulated or the 
pelleted catalyst was then ready to be charged into the test unit* 

ii. Preparation of the Sample —A weighed sample of the catalyst 
to be tested was put in the chamber and the whole sealed in place. 

The sample was degassed at 100°c. until the pressure would remain 
at less than 1x10 rain, of mercury, with the mercury diffusion 
pump shut off. This step took approximately one hour. 

iii. Measurement of the Dead Space —The system was completely 
evacuated and a measured amount of helium was admitted through the 
charcoal scrubber into Bulb 2. With the stopcocks closed the pressure 
on the manometer was noted. The temperature of the water bath was 
recorded.

The 'dead space' around the adsorbent sample up to 
stopcock 7 was determined using the purified helium. To make this 
dead space determination a volume of purified helium was admitted into 
the burette B, the stopcock 8 being closed. The volume of this 
helium was measured with the calibrated burette and manometer. After 
having placed the desired cold bath around the sample bulb, (cracked 
ice at 0°C.), the stopcock, B, was opened and the volume of 
helium left in the burette at equilibrium was determined. The 
difference between the original volume of helium and that left in the 
burette was the volume required to fill the 'dead space' to the 
observed pressure. Such a calibration assumed, of course, that 
helium was not adsorbed but merely filled the space surrounding 
the adsorbent. The assumption was justified, because at adsorption 
temperatures of 0°C. the adsorption of helium on all nonporous, and 
most porous adsorbents would always be very small compared to that 
of the adsorbate being used. 

Calculation of the 'dead space* was made as follo?ra:

. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

A. Determination of Surface Area 

The catalyst was again degassed at 100°C until a 
vacuum of at least 0.001 mm. of mercury could be maintained with 
the mercury vapor pump shut off. 

Stopcock 5 was closed and the catalyst chamber was 
immersed in liquid air. A measured amount of nitrogen was taken 
in bulbs B by opening stopcocks 2 and 7* With these stopcocks 
closed again the pressure and temperature of the gas in the bulbs 
was recorded. 

Stopcock B was opened and the new pressure recorded. 

The mercury level was varied in bulbs B to give several known 
volumes with corresponding pressures between 15 and 75 cms. of 
mercury. 

Vg is the volume of the bulbs and line containing Ng 

Pg is the pressure in cms. of mercury. 

Tg is the temperature of the gas. 

Vg is the known volume of bulbs and line to stopcock 10.

Surface Areas—The surface areas of catalyst *0* ( Co t ThOg J 

MgO : Bentonite — 100 s 6 : 12 ? 200 ) and of the Bentonite 
carrier were measured. The results are shown in Tables I and II 
and Figures 6 and 7. 

Comparing the yields obtained with the various surface 
areas of the catalysts containing different carriers, we find 
that the catalyst containing the bentonite carrier may have a 
better activity than the others. It is, therefore, apparent that 
the best support for a catalyst would most probably be bentonite 
because of its larger surface area. 

The composition, average run, yield in gm./cu.metre, 
surface area, are shown in Table III.

PART II 

DECOMPOSITION OF METHANOL FORMIC ACID 
AND ETHYL ALCOHOL OVER A FISCHER TR0P3CH CATALYST 

( 9 ) 

A. Order of Reaction 


Since the rate of a chemical change is proportional to 
the concentrations of the reacting substances, it is evidait that 
the speed of the process must fall off as the reaction proceeds, 
for the reactants are being continuously consumed. The change of 
reaction rate with, time must be represented by a curve similar to 
that shown in Fig. 1, belowt 



Change of the Rate of Reaction with Time 
Fig. 1 

The reaction decreases with time in a function which becomes 
asymptotic with the time axis. It is obviously not a simple matter 
to define the general rate of a reaction, and so in practice the 
velocity is considered at a particular instant. In this way 
valuable results can be obtained. In the study of chemical 
kinetics reactions are divided into classes determined either by 





ce

molecular!ty, that is, by the number of atoms or molecules taking 
part in each act leading to chemical reaction, or by the order of 
the reaction, that is, the number of atoms or molecules whose con¬ 
centrations determine the velocity, or kinetics, of the process. 

Reactions may be classified kinetically as being either 
homogeneous or heterogeneous. A reaction is said to be kinetically 
homogeneous if it takes place in one phase only. If two or more 
phases are involved in the process as in a gaseous reaction pro¬ 
ceeding on the surface of a solid catalyst or on the walls of the 
container, the reactipn is said to be heterogeneous. 

Reactions of the First Order —In a first-order reaction the rate 
is directly proportional to the concentration of the reacting 
substance. The condition can be expressed mathematically in the 

forms 

- -3T = kI (1) 

where c is the concentration of the reacting substance, for 

this equation states that the rate of disappearance of the reactant 
at any instant is proportional to its concentration at that instant 
If a is the initial concentration of the reacting species, and 
x is the decrease after the lapse of time t, the concentration 
remaining will then be (a-x); the reaction velocity can be 
obtained by substituting (a-x) for c in (1); thus, 

- A ,(,*-*). = k (a-x)

The quantity , which is a measure of the rate of 

dt 

decomposition is called the reaction velocity, and the propor¬ 
tionality constant k is referred to as the velocity constant, 
the velocity coefficient, or sometimes as the specific rate. 

The reaction velocity at any instant is thus equal to the product 
of the velocity coefficient which is constant at a definite tempera¬ 
ture for the given reaction, and the concentration of the reactant 
at that instant. In order to see how the velocity constant may 
be evaluated, it is necessaiy to integrate (2) in the form, 

dx s k d t 

(a-x) 

remembering that when t is 0, that is, at the beginning of the 
reaction, the amount x is 0, whereas after time t it is x, 

the result is; 

k = JL in - — = .1:29.1.. log — iL.„ ( 3 ) 

t a-x t a-x 

An alternate method for testing equation (3) is a 
graphical one. Equation (3) may be rearranged to the form: 

In (a-x) = - kt + In a 

log 10 ~ j t + log 10 a (k) 


Since for any one experiment a is constant, equation (h) is the 
equation of straight line when log (a-x) is plotted against t. 

In such a plot the f y* intercept will be log^Q a while the slope 
will be (~ k l/2.303) * Consequently, when a log (a-x) versus 
t plot constructed from the experimental data is found to be linear, 
the reaction is first order.

By taking the slope of the line, k-^ follows as: 
ki = 2.303 (slope) 

(19) 

B. Affect of Temperature on Reaction Velocity 

Arrhenius first pointed out that the variation of rate 
constants with temperature can be represented by an equation similar 
to that used for equilibrium constants, namely: 

din k = A # (5) 

dt RT 2 


In this Arrhenius equation k is the reaction rate 

constant; T the absolute temperature; R the gas constant in 
•a 

calories; and A E a quantity characteristic of the reaction 
with the dimension of an energy. A E is known as the energy 
of activation and plays a very important role in chemical kinetics. 

Integrating equation (5) and assuming that A E* is 
a constant we obtain: 


or

where and C are constants of integration. However, if the 

integration is carried out between the limits k = at T = 
and k = at T = T^, thai

( 6 ) 


From equation (6) it is evident that as soon as two 
different tenperatures and two different values of k are available 
A E be evaluated; or when £ E and a value of k 

at some one temperature are known, k at another temperature may be 


calculated,

and y intercept equal to C. Consequently if such a plot is 
constructed and is found to be linear, the equation is confirmed. 


Further by taking the slope of the line, 
readily through equation (7). 


4 E may be calculated 


C. The Energy of Activation 

In reactions involving two or more molecules it is 

logical to presuppose that before reaction can take place the 

molecules must come in contact with each otherj in other words, 

they must collide. If collision is a sufficient cause for reaction, 

the rate of reaction should equal the rate of collision. However, 

when the number of molecules actually reacting in a gaseous reaction, 

as obtained from the observed velocity constants, is compared with 

the total number of molecules colliding, calculated from kinetic 

theory, the latter are found to exceed the number undergoing 

transformation by many powers of ten. This discrepancy can be 

explained only by the assumption that molecules, in order to react, 

must be in some special configuration at collision, or that they 

must be in some exceptionally high energy state, or both. Although 

configuration does play a part in certain reactions, the appearance 
■& 

of the A E term in the Arrhenius equation and other considera¬ 
tions definitely favor an exceptional energy state as a prime 
requisite for reaction; that is, the molecules must be activated 
before they can react on collision.

According to the concept of activation reactants do not 
pass directly to products, but must first acquire sufficient energy 
to pass over an activation ’energy barrier*. The ideas involved 
can be made clear with the aid of Fig. 2. 



Fig. 2 

In this figure A represents the average energy of the 
reactantsj C that of the products} and B the minimum energy 
which the reactants must possess in order to react. Molecules 
existing in state B are said to be activated or in an activated 
state. Since molecules must be activated before reaction, the 
reaction must proceed from A to C, not directly but along path 
A.B.C. In other words, molecules must first climb the energy 
barrier before they can roll down the hill to form predicts. 

The energy that the reactants at A must absorb in order 
to become activated and react is the energy of activation & E , 
of the process A—> C, 

This energy is obviously E = Eg - E^ , that is, 

the difference in energy between the activated state and that 
corresponding to the average energy of the reactants. By the same

argument it can be seen that the energy of activation , 

■ft 

of the reverse process C->. A must be A s ^3 ~ 

From these two activation energies the difference, A E, between 

« * 
iv, and ^ E 0 , follows asi 

* # 

AE = - AE 2 

= ( ) - ( %* E C ) 

= e/ b - S A + - B/b + E c 

= E c - E a 

But ZE = E c - is the difference in energy between 
reactants and products, or the heat of reaction at constant volume. 
This must mean that in going from the activated state to the products 
the molecules give up not only the energy absorbed on activation 
from A to B, but also the energy AE corresponding to the 
difference in energy levels of C and A. Hence it may be con¬ 
cluded that the thermodynamic relations between energies of products 
are in no way violated by the concept of an activation energy. All 
it does is to introduce two quantities such that their difference 
always leads to the heat of reaction. At the same time it is 
evident that no information can be obtained from heats of reaction 
without the aid of kinetic study or other considerations. 

D. The Mechanism of the Synthesis Reaction 

Experiments on the rates of formation and reduction of 
cobalt carbide on cobalt-thoria-kieselguhr catalysts under various 
conditions indicate that the first step of the synthesis gases with 
the catalyst give cobalt carbide ! 1 ^ Wien this is reduced by 
chemisorbed hydrogen atoms only methane is formed. Reduction by 
molecular Hydrogen, however, leads to the formation of longer chain 
hydrocarbons. Hence, in order to obtain oils, the conditions of

the synthesis have to be adjusted so that only very few chemisorbed 

hydrogen atoms are present on the catalyst surface. 

It is significant that the three metals, cobalt, nickel 

and iron, which show activity as Fischer catalysts at atmospheric 

o 

pressure, all react at 200 C. with carbon monoxide to form carbides. 
Fischer postulated that such carbides are intermediate compounds in 
the synthesis. Bohr and Jessen found that precipitated and reduced 
cobalt reacted smoothly at 230°C. with carbon monoxide as follows: 

2 CO + 2 Co - y Co 2 C + C0 2 

At higher temperatures the carbide becomes unstable and free carbon 
is formed as well. 

Mechanism of the Synthesis of Hydro carbons from Carbon Monoxide 

and Hydrogen —During the synthesis the catalyst is in contact with 

both hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and the formation and utilization 

of the carbide can be envisaged as follows: 

Go + CO ——-v Co - CO (chemisorption) (i) 

Co - GO + CO Co - G (surface carbide) 4 GQg (ii) 

Co - CO 4- H^~ Go - C (surface carbide) + HgO (iii) 

Co - C i Hg -—>-CHg —-v higher hydrocarbons (iv) 

The oxygenated product of the Fischer synthesis over a 
cobalt catalyst is water and not carbon dioxide, a fact which suggests 
that (iii) proceeds more rapidly than (ii) for it is impossible 
that the water could be produced by the water-gas shift reaction. 

co 2 + h 2 - --> CO -f H 2 0 (v) 

since at 200°C the equilibrium concentration of water vapor would 
be extranely small. This fact together with other evidence, indicates 
that in the synthesis of hydrocarbons the Fischer catalyst must be 
inactive for the water gas shift reaction although normally it is a 
most effective catalyst for it. 

In more detail the mechanism of the Fischer synthesis

The normal initial period, 'when methane is being formed 
before the synthesis of oil sets in, is easily understanda&Le 
on this basis, because the experimental evidence is that during 
the first few hours after admission of synthesis gas to the 
catalyst, carbide is being slowly built up. 

Since, during this time the catalyst will be incompletely 
covered with carbide and chemisorbed hydrogen ca.n therefore be 
present on its surface, methane will be synthesized; but as less 
of the surface becomes available for chemisorbed hydrogen, so 
the formation of methane will diminish and the synthesis of oil 
set in. Ultimately, when the surface is completely covered with 
carbide to the exclusion of chemisorbed hydrogen, the synthesis 
will cease and the catalyst will be choked with heavy waxes as 
there is no means left for removing them from the surface. Hence 
revivifaction in hydrogen must be carried out before the synthesis 
can. continue. 

Although no direct evidence that cobalt catalysts are 
capable of cracking hydrocarbons has been found, Craxford shows 
that there is an optimum rate of synthesis gas flow over the 
catalyst bed, and postulates that at slower rates of flow the 
hydrocarbons produced in the first part of the bed are cracked in 
the later part to methane with consequent reduced yields. Craxford 
further shows that the rate of formation of C0 2 steadily drops 
as the flo?r of synthesis gas is increased, showing no maximum, 
so that the formation of CO2 cannot be connected directly with 
the synthesis reaction. The reaction is probably: 

CO + 2H 2

rather than

The experimental evidence on which Craxford bases this hypothesis 
is shown in Figure 3 in graphical form;

E. Decomposition of Oxygenated Compounds 

Unimolecular reactions in gases have a rather exceptional 
theoretical interest because they involve, apparently, the spon¬ 
taneous change of isolated molecules. The thermal decomposition of 
methanol vapor satisfies the experimental criteria of a homo¬ 
geneous unimolecular reaction. 

It will be shown that the decomposition of methanol 
vapor is a homogeneous reaction which satisfies the chief experi¬ 
mental criterion of a unimolecular change. It should therefore 
be possible to calculate the unimolecular velocity constants. For 
this purpose it is essential to know the limiting value of the 
pressure increase attending the decomposition. It can hardly be 
expected that the experimentally observed * end point* would be 
the proper value for insertion in the unimolecular equation,

because the products formed in the primary decomposition of the 
methanol undergo slow subsequent reactions, continuing after all 
the methanol is decomposed. It is, in fact, found that the curve 
obtained by plotting pressure increase against time does not 
become parallel to the time axis, but continues with a small 
upward slope, after the main reaction is over. A correction for 

(lit) 

this is easily applied, (Hinshelwood ), in a way which is 
illustrated in Fig. h • 



Curve I is the experimental curve, which does not become quite 
horizontal in the normal v/ay. The line A.B, to which the curve 
is asymptotic, is drawn and produced to meet the pressure axis at 
A. The vertical distance between A.B, and the horizontal line 
A.C, at any time gives the pressure increase attributed to the 
subsequent reactions. By subtracting these values from the 
ordinates of curve I curve II is obtained, which is the ideal 


















decomposition curve of the methanol and is asymptotic to the 
horizontal line A.C, which represents the time end point of 
the reaction, 

F. Thermal Decomposition of Methyl Alcohol 

Methyl alcohol decomposes catalytically in the presence 
of Fischer Tropsch Catalyst to formaldehyde and hydrogen at 
approximately 185°C, Formaldehyde rapidly decomposes into 
carbon monoxide and hydrogen so that the resultant equation is: 

CH 3 OH -* CO + 2H 2 

As formaldehyde undergoes certain condensation reactions 
which are more prominent at high pressures, it is not surprising 
that the pressure increase during the decomposition of methyl 
alcohol decreases as the initial pressure increases and depends 
on the vessel surface, 

( 11 ) 

A study of the decomposition permits operation at 
atmospheric pressure where the experimental procedure is greatly 
simplified, it being justifiable to suppose that the catalyst 
mixture giving the maximum decomposition into carbon monoxide and 
hydrogen will be particularly suitable for the synthesis of 
methanol from these same gases under pressure. 

The decomposition is a true measure of the activity 
of the catalysts only when the time of contact and the concentra¬ 
tions are the same in each case. It will be seen at once that the 
decomposition is by no means a simple reaction, as evidenced by 
the complexity of the products. Formaldehyde, methyl formate, 

CO 2 and methane are formed in addition to CO and Hydro gen • The 
decomposition may be represented tentatively by the following 
scheme:

G. The Thermal Decomposition of Ethyl Ucohol 

In spite of numerous experimental results the complexity of 
the reactions prevents more than a qualitative indication of the re¬ 
action involved. Many primary and secondary reactions are possible. 

The nature and course of the reaction depends upon the catalyst, con¬ 
ditions of temperature and space velocity used. Among the gaseous 
products may be hydrogen, 00,00^ , GH 2 - GIL, , CH^ and CH 3 - CH^ • The 
liberation of carbon is also possible and a few liquids such as water 
aldehydes, esters and polymerisation products can be formed. 

The formation of OIL during the decomposition may occur in 
several ways. The primary decomposition of alcohol to aldehyde followed 
by the decomposition of the aldehyde to methane and carbon monoxide, is 
probably the most frequent and largest source of methane. The hydrogen¬ 
ation of CO may be mentioned as a second important source. Boomer and 
Morris believed that several other reactions must be considered in exper¬ 
iments at atmospheric pressure. The reactions that appear worthy of con¬ 
sideration are as follows: 

(1) CH 3 CHG -vCH 4 4 GO 

( 2 ) CO 4 3H 2 ->ch 4 4 H 2 0 

(3) 2C0 4 2H,-»CH 4 4 C0 2 

(4) C0 2 4 4H 2 -^ CH 4 4 2H 2 0 

(5) 4C0 4 2H 2 0-?CH 4 4 3C0 2 

It is possible that any or all of these secondary reactions can 


be sources of methane. Some such as (1) and ( 2 ) may be considered probable 
and even established by the elimination of others from the range of 
possibility.

The production of C0 9 during the decomposition of ethyl 
alcohol may occur through the operation of several reactions. The 
following secondary reactions may be listed as possibilities as shown 
by work done elsewhere 

(1) 2C0 -> CG 2 4 C 

(2) C 4 2H 2 0—* C0 2 4 2H 2 

(3) CO 4 h 2 o — co 2 4 h 2 

Sabatier showed that ethyl alcohol could undergo two important 
types of decomposition; one to ethylene and water, a reaction promoted 
chiefly by oxide catalysts, and the other to hydrogen and acetaldehyde 
promoted chiefly by metals. Many catalysts promote both reactions. 

Thoria yields approximately equal volumes of ethylene and hydrogen. 

A supported thoria catalyst promotes the ethylene reaction 
almost exclusively.

H. The Thermal Decomposition of Formic Acid/ 

The catalytic decomposition of formic acid vapor at the 
surfaces of metallic oxides can be explained by considering that the 
reaction takes place in an adsorbed layer one molecule thick, partially 
covering the catalyst surface. Two alternative modes of decomposition 
take place on the Fischer Tropseh catalyst, i.e. 




(1) C0 2 4 h 2 

(ii) CO 4 H^o 


The simplest assumption to explain the fact of catalysis by 
surfaces is that the energy necessary for activation of the reactant 
molecules is lowered by association with the catalytic surface. This 
leads one to expect a rough parallelism between temperature coefficient 
of reaction rate and specific catalytic activity (i.e., the catalytic 
activity per unit area of superficial surface). Such a parallelism might, 
of course, be completely mashed by a wide variation in the number of 
molecules adsorbed per unit area. As a result it would seem reasonable 
to expect that -when the heat of adsorption is large, a considerable 
alteration of the activation energy would be produced because of the 
”molecular field” in which the adsorbed molecule finds itself. Simul¬ 
taneously, a relatively large fraction of the surface would be covered 
by the adsorbed layer.

APPARATUS 


The apparatus used is shown in figure 5* The liquid to be decomposed 
was stored in bulb II. This bulb could be heated to various temperatures 
and give various pressures of gaseous reactant in the storage bulb I. Stop¬ 
cock 2 connects these bulbs to prevent the condensation of reactant in the 
connecting lines, these and bulb II were maintained at a temperature above 
the boiling point of the reactant. 

A manometer was connected to the storage bulb I and the amount of 
gas used in a reaction could be determined by readings of this manometer 
before and after the reaction. 

The storage bulb was connected through stopcock 3 to the reaction 
vessel III by capillary tubing which was also heated. A manometer M was 
connected to this bulb. This vessel, which contained the catalyst, was 
surrounded by a furnace which was held at a constant temperature t 2 degrees 
by a thermoregulator. The temperature of the reaction vessel was determined 
by an iron constantan thermocouple. 

The whole system could be evacuated through stopcock I (a three-way 
stopcock) which connected to a mercury diffusion pump and then a hyvac 
pump. 

, 

The gases necessary for carbiding and reducing the catalyst entered 
the system through stopcock I and left the system through stopcock 4*

CHEMICALS 


The methyl alcohol used in this investigation was purified according to 
the following procedure (Fieser* Experiments in Organic Chemistry”, Part II, 
page 355)* 

A good grade of methyl alcohol was placed in a large flask provided 
with an efficient condenser and about 5-15 gms. of magnesium turnings was 
added, the amount being adjusted according to the quantity of water probably 
present. When the first vigorous reaction was over and the magnesium was 
largely dissolved, the mixture was refluxed for 2-3 hours to complete the 
dehydration, and the dry alcohol was then distilled from the residue of 
magnesium hydroxide and magnesium methoxide. 

The ethyl alcohol obtained was 98%. This was then purified by 
fractional distillation. 

Formic acid C.P. grade was used. This was further purified by 
fractional distillation* 

Acetone C.P. grade was used. This was further purified by fractional 
distillation. 

The gases used were hydrogen and carbon monoxide. 

The hydrogen used was tank hydrogen passed over copper foil at 300 c C, 
then through an activated charcoal trap immersed in iiwuld air. The only 
impurity of any account in tank hydrogen is oxygen, which is completely 
removed by this treatment. 

Carbon monoxide was prepared by dropping formic acid (85$) into concen¬ 
trated sulfuric acid (5 g* 185°C). The gas was passed through dehydrite and 
soda lime tubes to absorb moisture and carbon dioxide, then through a glass 
wool packed trap immersed in liquid air. The only impurities present in 
carbon monoxide prepared in this manner are moisture and acid spray and a 
small amount of carbon dixoide, all of which will be completely removed by 


this treatment

PROCEDURE 


Preparation of Sample s 

A weighed sample of the catalyst to be tested was put in bulb III 
and the bulb sealed in place* The sample was degassed at 200°C until a 
vacuum was obtained and would hold with stopcock 3 shut off* Then purified 
at 200°C was passed through stopcock 1 over the catalyst for two hours* 

Pure carbon monoxide was then passed over the catalyst for an additional 

, ‘(h 

six hours - thus activating the catalyst and preparing it for the decompo¬ 
sition of the various substances to be tested. 

Determination of the Rates of Decompostlon : 

The catalyst was again degassed at 20Q°G until a vacuum could be 
maintained with the mereury vapor pump shut off* Stopcocks 1 and 3 were 
shut off thus isolating the system. Stopcock 2 was opened and the methanol 
in bulb II was heated to boiling. The vapors were stored in bulb I - main- 
tained at 110°C. When a reasonable amount of methanol vapor has accumulated 
stopcock 2 was shut off and stopcock 3 was opened - admitting methanol 

vapors to the catalyst chamber at 2GG°C• Stopcbck 3 was then shut and the 

■ !\ - \ 1 \ 
pressure change on Manometer M with time Was recorded. 

The reaction of acetone ethanol and methyl alcohol were studied over 

an oxidized catalyst (°C ,! ) at temperatures, between 200° - 210°C. 

- 

The decomposition of formic acid, ethanol and methanol over cobalt 
catalyst were also investigated over a temperature range of 190 - 230°C. 





RESULTS 


Th© following tables I - V list the data of fourteen typical 
runs. The temperatures of the line, furnace and reaction chamber 
are noted, together with the weight of catalyst. 

In columns one and two the time and pressure readings on 
manometer M are presented. In columns three and four, the rat© of 
change of pressure at various times are tabulated. 

In this first series of runs using Catalyst H C% air was 
admitted to th© reaction chamber after activation, thus oxidizing 
the rediiced catalyst. Her© the pressure decreases with time. It 
would seem to indicate that by allowing air to enter, the catalyst 
was poisoned and, the overall result was one of adsorption rather 
than decomposition. 

On analysing the products, it was found that only methyl 


alcohol was present

Table VI compares the rates of pressure change H dP/dt M at various 
times w t M with various reactants at two temperatures. 

It appears that over the oxidized catalyst no decomposition is taking 
place. Instead we may have an adsorption with the rate depending on diffusion. 

These results may have some importance in considering the decrease 
in catalytic activity as the synthesis reaction proceeds. This decrease in 
activity makes it necessary to reactivate the catalyst frequently.

Tables VII to XXXVI list the data of typical runs for the decomposition 
of methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, and formic acid, and the synthesis from 
CO ♦ 2 ^ 2 * The catalyst used here was Co s ThC^ 1 MgO 1 Kieselguhr, 100 : 

6 : 12 j 200 : (Catalyst M 8 rt ). The catalyst was reduced and activated with 
special precautions to prevent air from coming in contact with it. It was 
assumed that the catalyst surface in these decompositions was similar to the 
catalyst surface in the synthesis of hydrocarbons. The temperature used 
(185 - 230°C) is the range used in the synthesis of hydrocarbons. 

For each run listed here there are two tables presented. These runs 
are included as typical of the results at the various temperatures and with 
the various reactors. The first table of each set represented by Tables 
VII, IX, XI, etc. show the pressure change vs. time. Tables VIII, X, XII, 
etc. show in column one - time in minutes} column two - apparent pressure 
in cms. Hg; and in column three - correction n x f * which must be subtracted 
from column two to obtain the actual pressure, according to the method 
indicated in Fig. 4* Column four shows P c , the corrected pressure difference. 
Column five gives the corrected final pressure Pf, minus the corrected pressure 
P c . Column six shows the log of Pf - P c . 

Fig. 16 shows a typical d©composition curve of Pressure vs. Time. 

Fig. 17 shows the plot of log Pf - P c vs. Time for the rate of decomposition. 
This plot gives a straight line showing that the decomposition follows a 
first order rat© equation. 

The other figures list similar data to these.

Table XIII lists the data for the decomposition of methyl alcohol. 
Column one shows k - the velocity constant as obtained from the slopes 
of the graphs of log Pf - P c vs Time. Column two shows log k 5 column 
three the temperature at which the velocity constant was found. Column 
four lists the absolute temperature and column five - the reciprocal of 
the absolute temperature. Fig. 22 is the plot of log k vs. i/T. The 
slope obtained multiplied by 4.58 gives the activation energy for methyl 
alcohol. This activation energy was found to be 22,300 calories.

Figures 30 to 35 give similar results to methyl and ethyl 


alcohol for the decomposition of formic acid. Table XXVII gives the 
data necessary for finding the activation energy for the decomposition 
of formic acid. The activation energy is 15*300 calories.

Tables XXVIII to XXXIII list the results for the synthesis of 
2 H 2 + C0 # In these tables it is shown that the pressure chance decreases 
with time. Therefore the negative value for k obtained Is indicative for 
a synthesis rather than a decomposition occurring. The reaction occurring 
is of the following type: 

n CO ♦ (2n + 1) A 2 “+ Cn + 2 + n%0 

= -267,600 calories (exothermic) which gives a decrease in volume. 

In these curves it is assumed that in the first part of the reaction 
one product is synthesized, then as the reaction proceeds another type of 
product is produced. The rate of formation of the first product by the 
reaction appears to follow a first order reaction as can be seen by Figs. 

38, 40 and 42. Apparently the catalyst surface is nearly saturated ?/ith 
carbon monoxide, hydrogen is then admitted and strikes the surface and 
will be adsorbed. As soon as the hydrogen is adsorbed it will react with 
the carbon monoxide. The rate at which the hydrogen is adsorbed is 
proportional to the hydrogen in the gaseous phase, thus indicating a first 
order reaction. Another explanation may be that the rate is independent 
of carbon monoxide and hydrogen concentration. The reaction depends on 
the rate at which some Intermediate is formed, and that intermediate may 
be following a first order.

CONCLUSION 


The results of the decomposition of CH^OH, C 2 H 5 OH and HCOQh and 
the synthesis of CO + 2^ are listed in Table XXXIV. 

From the data of Table XXXIV it can be seen that at temperatures 
commonly encountered in the synthesis of hydrocarbons below 200 °C the 
decompositions are lower than synthesis rate for hydrocarbons. 

If this first order reaction rate for CO + 21^ is faster than that 
for methanol, ethanol and formic acid, it indicates that the latter cannot 
be an intermediate step in the Fischer Tropsch synthesis at temperatures 
below 200°C. However, above 200®C the evidence does not remove the possi¬ 
bility that they are intermediate steps in the synthesis. 

The activation energies for methanol, ethanol, and formic acid 
over a Co t ThOg t Mg s Kiesielguhr catalyst were found to be 22,300 
calories, 28,000 calories, and 15,300 calories respectively. 

Formic acid deeomposeB in the two wayss 


HC00H 


H2 + C02 (1) 

KpO + CO (2) 


On the surface of glass, in the neighborhood of 280°C the alternative 


reactions take place with nearly equal speeds, yet the heats of activation 

are very different. 1 * the heat of activation associated with the 

* co 

decomposition into carbon monoxide and water, is about 16,000 calories, 

while Ecos is afecmt 28,000 calories. From this data it appears that the 

reaction taking place over the Go i Thoria s MgO catalyst is (2) i,e. the 

formation of HO + 00. The table below Eco- represents the apparent heat 
2 

of activation in the decomposition of formic acid vapor into carbon dioxiae 
and hydrogen.

Croxford and Rideal reported the decomposition of ethanol at the 
surface of a thoria catalyst to have an activation energy of 30,000 
calories. The value for the activation energy obtained compares favorably 
for the decomposition of ethyl alcohol in this investigation. 

From the International Critical Tablesthe energy of activation 
for gaseous methanol was found to be 21,300 calories, which compares 
favorably with the results obtained. 

Eidus^ has also investigated the hypothesis that methanol, 
ethanol and fertile acid were intermediate in the synthesis of hydrocarbons. 
In ills investigation, he determined reaction products formed when these 
compounds were passed over a Go j ThOg ; MgO ! kioselguhr catalyst and 
did not investigate the rates of the reaction. From his work he concluded 
that methanol, ethanol and formic acid are not intermediate in the synthesis 
of hydrocarbons. The work reported here supports Sidus 1 conclusions.
