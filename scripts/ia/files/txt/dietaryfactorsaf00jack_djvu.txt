ABSTRACT, 


The effects of various dietary factors on rat serum 
lipase were tested and from the experimental data obtained 
the following conclusions were made; Variations in serum 
tributyrinase levels of normal adult and weanling male rats 
could not be accounted for on the basis of consumption of Purina 
Fox Checkers. The high tributyrinase levels of alloxan diabetic 
adult male rats can be correlated to the amount of Checkers 
ingested daily. 

It has been shown that the serum tributyrinase levels 
of adult male rats are elevated with increased ingestion of 
dietary Crisco, butter, cottonseed oil, linseed oil, corn oil, 
and olive oil. There were significant differences in the 
activity of the enzyme which depended on the nature of the 
dietary fat. On the other hand, the serum tributyrinase 
levels of weanling male rats decreased with increased ingestion 
of Crisco and this may be accounted for on the basis of 
diminished protein consumption. 

The lowest tributyrinase levels were obtained with diets 
free of fat. These values were much lower than those obtained 
with fasting rats. The ingestion of fat soluble vitamins A, D, 
and E, or glycerol, does not affect these basal enzyme levels. 
Ingestion of stearic or oliets acid increased the lipolytic 
activity of rat serum.

From inanition experiments it was possible to conclude 
that a tributyrin hydrolyzing enzyme present in the serum of 
adult male rats was in some way connected with the utilization 
of the body depot fats during starvation. It is evident that 
significant differences due to previous dietary history may 
occur within what is usually considered a n normal range 11 for 
the enzyme.

INTRODUCTION 


This investigation is concerned with the study of the 
lipolytic activity of the serum of albino rats* Wistar strain* 
More than one enzyme may be involved, but for convenience, we 
will speak of a single enzyme, tributyrinase* Tributyrinas© is 
a member of a group of enzymes known as lipases which in general, 
hydrolyze the esters of fatty acids and alcohols* The exact 
function of this enzyme is unknown although its ability to 
hydrolyze certain fatty acid esters was demonstrated as early 
as 1896. 

The terminology with respect to the lipases is at present 
confused. This is due mainly to the fact that the lipolytic 
enzymes are not entirely specific in their action, in the sense 
that each particular member appears to hydrolyze quite a number 
of lipid esters* The enzyme which we call serum tributyrinase, 
for example, splits tripropionin and ethyl butyrate, as well as 
a variety of other lipid esters* As a result of this variation 
in specificity different workers propose different names for 
what appears to be the same enzyme system* The names most 
commonly used in the literature for the particular enzyme under 
study ares butyrinase, tributyrinase, non-specific serum 
esterase, senna ester a se, serolipase, and serum lipase. We 
feel that the only safe practice is to name the enzyme after

the substrate used for assay, therefore, from here on we will 
use the term * serum tributyrinase". 

The problems regarding the origin, physiological function, 
and exact nature of serum tributyrinase are over half a century 
old* It was stated by von Hess (39) that Hanriot (15), in X896, 
was the first to investigate the origin of “seroiipase”. The 
following lines from the paper by von Hess (39) are presented 
here because they mention early conflicts regarding the nature 
of 11 ser©lipase” and bring to light many features of historical 
interest* 

“THE NATURE OF SEROLIPASE* It is to be noted that most 
of the work on blood lipases has been done with artificial esters 
and not true fats* Even Hanriot (15) says, that fats, while 
acted upon by the blood are not suited for the study of hydrolysis 
because of their insolubility and small amount of cleavage. In 
their place he used a fatty acid ester monobutyrin* This is more 
easily emulsified and split by the blood serum and therefore 
better adapted for following the course of hydrolysis* Kastle and 
Loevenhart (19) and Loevenhart (20) also laid stress upon the 
similarity of action of lipase upon ethylbutyrate and fats* 

"Following this a heated discussion arose concerning the 
lipases of the serum* Arthus (3) and Doyen and Morel (10) claim 
that the blood serum does not contain a true lipase but only 
esterases of the lower fatty acids* In 1901* Bitnii-Schljachto (6)

found that serolipase splits artificial fats as easily as 
raonobutyrin. It may be agreed that esterases resemble enzymes 
in general; but the question now arises whether or not they are 
identical with true lipases. 

Strangely enough, JUO years later the problems of 
emulsification, specificity of the enzyme, choice of substrate, 
and many others are not settled and are still being argued by 
the foremost workers in this field. 

In 1911, Rona and Michaelis (29) described a method for 
the estimation of M ester and fat hydrolysisby the blood and 
serum. This method was based on the measurement of the amount 
of surface tension lowering due to the hydrolysis of tributyrin 
and monobutyrin and the subsequent liberation of butyric acid. 
Aberhalden and Rona (2) were the first workers who attempted t© 
relate the serum tributyrinase levels to the diet. They 
reported in 1912 that dogs which had previously been starved 
and then fed excess fat showed an increase in the serum 
tributyrinase activity as determined by the method of Rona and 
Michaelis. 

In the same year von Hess (39) showed that in the dog, 
ligation or extirpation of the pancreas did not alter the 
concentration of tt lipase w in the serum. It is important to 
note that the substrate used by von Hess was tributyrin, because 
Cherry and Crandall, in 1932 (8), described a modification of

Loevenhart’s method (20) in which they used olive oil as a 
substrate and demonstrated exactly the opposite results. The 
latter appear to be the exact antithesis of the findings of von 
Hess. In recent years, however, many workers have contributed 
to the currently accepted idea that the lipases of the pancreas 
and serum are not the same. The fundamental difference is that 
the serum tributyrinase acts most readily on short chain fatty 
acid esters, whereas, the lipase of the pancreas shows greatest 
activity with the esters of long chain fatty acids. The use of 
these two substrates, tributyrin and olive oil, brings to light 
the fact that although the pancreatic lipase does increase in 
the serum after ligation of the pancreatic ducts the serum 
tributyrinase levels ordinarily present remain essentially 
unaltered. Furthermore, von Hess demonstrated that not only 
ligation or extirpation of the pancreas but also ligation of 
the renal arteries or thyroidecton^r had no effect on the serum 
tributyrinase levels. He concluded that this enzyme had little 
relationship to the pancreas, thyroid gland, or kidney. This 
investigator also found that this enzyme is not activated by 
bile salts. Once again this points to a distinction between 
serum tributyrinase and pancreatic lipase since the latter 
enzyme is the classical example of an enzyme activated by 
bile salts (33), (13)* 

Further significant contributions to the study of serum

tributyrinase were made in 1912 when Rona and coworkers studied 
the effects of time and temperature on the activity of the enzyme* 
It is also of interest to note that in this same year Rona and 
Ebsen (27) made the first attempt to keep the pH of the reaction 
medium constant with the aid of phosphate buffers® 

Aberhalden stated in 1913 (1) that the lipolytic action 
of the blood and serum of well nourished dogs increased when the 
animals were starved® It will be of interest to note later in 
this thesis the effect of starvation on the serum tributyrinase 
levels of rats fasted after a number of dietary regimens. 

Rona and Bien, in 1911* (26), determined the pH optimum 
of rabbit serum tributyrinase to be about 8. They stated that 
serum tributyrinase was different from stomach esterase and 
probably different from intestinal tributyrinase. They also 
showed that serum tributyrinase reacts upon different esters with 
different velocities and suggested that the constitution of the 
esters was probably the important factor. Later in the same year 
these workers concluded that the lipases of the pancreas and 
serum were not identical. Their opinion was based on pH optima 
studies and differences in the effects produced by calcium, 
magnesium, barium, manganese salts, and sodium fluoride, on the 
enzyme activity. 

Pietri, in 1915 (23), made the important observation 
that sodium butyrate retarded the velocity of reaction of the

enzyme under study whereas glycerol had no effect. This indicates 
that an accumulation of the products of reaction would hinder 
enzyme activity. The inhibition attributed to sodium butyrate 
was not due to change in pH. A similar observation has recently 
been reported by Schoenheyder (32) who worked with pig liver 
esterase. Pietri also noted that blood letting diminished the 
enzyme activity* This has recently been confirmed by Tuba and 
Hoare (38). 

Green and Summers reported in 1916 (ill.), that feeding 
increased the amount of fat in the blood and to some extent the 
"lipase tt also. They stated, furthermore, that feeding adult dogs 
after a prolonged fast may result in only a slight rise in blood 
fat but it would cause a large increase in blood "lipase"• They 
also showed that the effects in puppies differed slightly from 
those obtained when adult dogs were used* 

Forbes and co-workers (12), demonstrated that rats which 
had previously been starved and then fed various foodstuffs, 
showed a rise in serum tributyrinase after the ingestion of 
Oleic and stearic acid and after a meal containing fat* They 
reported that glycerol, sugar, protein, and Checkers, had little 
or no effect* Unfortunately their method necessitated the killing 
of the animals and therefore they were unable to follow the lipase 
levels for any period of time* It is interesting to note at this 
point that Bach (!*) reported that the fat content of the diet did

not influence the serum tributyrinase levels* 

Recently Glotzer and Seligman (13), and others (30,31), 
have shown, under various normal as well as pathological 
conditions, the presence in serum of a lipase similar to 
pancreatic lipase, with respect to velocity of action, 
activation, and inhibition. Lagerlof (21), has similarly 
demonstrated what appears to be pancreatic lipase in normal 
serum. He has also described a method of increasing the 
pancreatic lipase fraction of the serum with opiates. Lagerlof 
has pointed out that heparinized plasma and serum show the 
same activity under a series of varying conditions. He 
concludes that they contain the same sort of esterase and 
that it is not physically or chemically bound to the fibrin. 

Flock and Bellman (11), reported that the lipolytic 
esterase content of lymph increases after a meal containing fat, 
whereas it is unaffected by a fat-free meal. Hess and Vioilier 
(16), on the other hand, state that the tributyrinase content of 
rat blood plasma is greatly reduced on a fat-free diet* 

In view of these findings and preliminary work by Hoar© 
(18), we felt that it was important to study the effects of 
various dietary regimens ©n the tributyrinase content of rat 
serum. In 1 9k9 Tuba and Hoare (36) developed a titrimetrie 
micr©method for the determination of the lipolytic esterase 
content of small amounts of serum. Previous methods required

such large quantities of blood or serum that small laboratory- 
animals, such as rats, had to be sacrificed for the purpose of 
determining the serum esterase levels* The method devised by 
Tuba and Hoare permits the drawing of small amounts of blood 
from laboratory animals and therefore the enzyme levels can be 
determined periodically in the same animals* Aside from the 
obvious advantage of using fewer animals a repetition of runs on 
the same animal permits one to acquire a larger number of well 
controlled observations which can then be subjected to statistical 
analyses similar to those made during our investigations*

D. COLLECTION OF RAT SERUM# 

Samples of blood were collected between the hours of 8,00 
a,m, and 10.00 a.m.* as a routine practice. Blood was obtained 
from the tail by "milking M into specially designed centrifuge tubes 
the total amount of blood removed from an individual animal did not 
exceed o.I* ml. • The tubes were allowed to stand a few minutes* 
then they were centrifuged for five minutes at 3000 r.p.m. . The 
serum was removed by means of a micr®-pipette and stored in 5 ml* 
test tubes. These tubes were stoppered immediately and placed in 
storage at 5°C. . Determinations were carried out within three 
days of the time of collection of the sample. Hoare (18) reported 
that a sample of serum kept over 100 days* at a temperature of 
5°C. showed no change in lipolytic activity. 

On occasion* particularly at the termination of inanition 
experiments, animals were decapitated and the blood collected. 

When rats are fasting or receiving insufficient food they drink 
very little water and subsequently the blood becomes very viscous. 
Under these conditions it is very difficult to obtain adequate 


blood from the tail,

E. MICRO-METHOD FOR THE ESTIMATION OF SERUM TRIBUTYRINASE. 


Mcro-Kjeldahl tubes of approximately 5 ml. capacity 
are used for the enzyme determinations. Into one of these 
tubes are pipetted 0.10ml. serum, 0.20 ml. distilled water, 
and 1.00 ml. veronal buffer of pH 8.20. The mixture is warmed 
to 37°C. and then 0.02 ml. of tributyrin, also at 37°C., is 
added with constant shaking. The contents of the tube are 
mechanically agitated for 30 minutes at 37°C. on a Warburg 
shaker at the rate of 120 swings a minute, which maintains 
the substrate in a finely dispersed state. The pH of the 
experimental tube at the end of 30 minutes is 7.9 but the 
average of the initial and terminal pH values is 8.0f>, which 
is considered a^better representation of the situation. 

Serum tributyrinase activity is terminated and the 
serum proteins are precipitated by the addition of Il.O ml. of 
ethyl alcohol. The mixture Is transferred to a 10 cm. 
centrifuge tube and centrifuged for five minutes. The 
supernatant is poured into a 25 ml. erlenmeyer flask, which 
is stoppered at once to minimize the absorption of carbon 
dioxide. The contents of the flask are titrated with O.Q23N. 
sodium hydroxide, using phenolphthalein as an indicator, to 
a faint but persistent pink color. 

A control tube is used which is identical with the 
experimental tube except that the serum is boiled for 30 
seconds before the buffer and substrate are added.

Enzyme activity is measured by the difference between 
the experimental and the control tubes. The serum tributyrinase 
activity in units is equivalent to the number of ml. of Q.025N. 
sodium hydroxide required to neutralize the amount of butyric 
acid liberated by the enzyme contained in 100 ml. of serum at 
37°C. and at pH 8.05. One ml. of O.Q2f>N. base is equivalent 
to one tributyrinase ( Lipase*- ) unit. 

Replicates on the same serum* using this simple and 
rapid micro-method* have repeatedly shown good agreement well 
within the limits of $% experimental error. 


# The term n Lipas@ unit 11 was previously used by Tuba and Hoare 
for what we now term a Tributyrinase unit. Three of the graphs 
presented in this thesis bear this older designation.

F. THE CARE AMD FEEDING OF ANIMALS* 

In all cases that rats were housed in individual cages 
and their ears were marked to facilitate identification. Fresh 
water was available to the animals at all times. They were 
generally fed ad libitum except during inanition experiments 
when the animals were either totally starved or placed on graded 
amounts of food* These exceptions will be dealt with under the 
topic n Inanition Experiments". 

Food consumption was recorded daily for each animal. The 
food containers were weighed each evening at which time the food 
was replenished. Since we often fed diets of high fat content 
the food trays were filled only slightly in excess of the amount 
of food an animal would eat and the containers were frequently 
emptied and washed. In this manner we were successful in 
preventing rancidity and subsequent spoiling of the diets. Food 
consumption data, as well as being essential to the interpretation 
of our results, were used as an indication of palatability and by 
this criterion none of the diets had become spoiled or rancid* 

Some of the more stable diets were made up every two or three 
weeks but diets which contained butter were made up once a week* 
Spillage was taken into account when the food consumption was 
recorded. All diets were stored in a refrigerator at 5°G. *

All the animals were weighed individually at the 
beginning of each experiment and at one week intervals thereafter* 
Growth was generally good and was used as an indication of the 
general health of the experimental animals.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

(I) Relationship between the amount of a stock laboratory 

ration ingested and serum tributyrinase levels* 

In order to determine the effect of total daily food 
consumption the animals were maintained on a stock laboratory- 
diet of Purina Fox Checkers, which were powdered to minimise 
scattering by the rats. This diet was fed to normal weanling 
male rats, normal adult male rats, and alloxan diabetic adult 
male rats. 

(i) In normal weanling male rats and normal adult male rats. 

Six weanling male rats, 21 days old, and six adult male 
rats were placed on the diet of powdered Checkers, which they 
received ad libitum for six weeks. The means of the results 
for these two experiments are given in Table I. There is no 
correlation between daily food consumption and serum tributyrinase 
activity in either growing or mature animals ( r= 0.06 and 0.01 
respectively ). There is, however, a highly significant 
correlation between the weights of the animals and tributyrinase 
levels in the weanling group ( ra?0.56 ). This further confirms 
the observations of Tuba and Hoare (37) that serum tributyrinase 
levels increase from low levels at birth to higher levels which 
become constant in the mature animal. The lack of correlation

between the weights of the adult group and their serum 
tributyrinase levels ( r =0.16 ) is therefore to be expected. 

(ii) In alloxan diabetic male rats. 

Twenty adult male rats were fasted overnight and each 
was injected subcutaneously with 160 mgm. of alloxan monohydrate 
per kg. of body weight. Fourteen animals died within twenty four 
hours. The remaining six rats were very definitely diabetic as 
shown by a pronounced hyperglycemia with blood sugar values 
ranging from 300 to 500 mgm. per hundred ml. of blood. The 
blood sugars were determined by the method of Eeinecke (2i|). 
Pronounced glycosuria* polyuria, and polydypsia were also 
evident and the blood was thick and dark suggesting hemoconcentration. 

These six rats, were maintained on a diet of powdered 
Checkers for a period of six weeks to allow the diabetic state 
to become fully established and the serum tributyrinase levels 
to become stabilized. Hoare reported (l8) that the serum 
tributyrinase levels increased to about the sixteenth day when 
a steady high range was reached. At the end of the pre-experimental 
feeding period the mean serum tributyrinase activity for the group 
was well above normal, in accordance with the findings of Tuba and 
Hoare (37)# While on experiment, the rats were fed powdered 
Checkers for six days, the amount of food eaten by each animal was 
measured daily, and the serum tributyrinase (lipase) activity was

estimated every two days* The mean tributyrinase values are 
given in Table II as well as the mean average food consumption 
for the 21* hours immediately preceding the bleeding for 
determination of tributyrinase levels* 

The regression line shown in Figure 1 was calculated 
from the 3 tributyrinase values and the 6 daily consumption 
levels determined for each rat during the course of the above 
experiment. The calculated equation for this regression line 
is T - hkC - 6k0 ( T = tributyrinase in units/100 ml* serum 

and G food consumption in gm./day/rat ) and this has a highly 
significant t value ~ 3*1 ( PC0.01 ). This together with the 
value of r - 0.6i* for the data of Table II, indicates that 
there is a highly significant correlation between food ingested 
and serum tributyrinase concentration in alloxan diabetic adult 
male rats* 

A simple arithmetical comparison of the consumption and 
enzyme data of the preceding two tables seems to indicate that 
the abnormally high tributyrinase activity associated with 
alloxan diabetes in rats is largely attributable to the increase 
in food consumption* This can readily be proved statistically. 
We have used the individual consumption and tributyrinase data 
for six alloxan diabetic rats ( Table II ) and for six normal 
adult rats ( last 3 weeks in Table I ) and there is a highly 
significant correlation, r — 0.63 with a t value of 3*59 at 
the 1% level.

The lack of correlation in normal adult rats eating 
unrestricted amounts of powdered Checkers is probably due to 
the wide fluctuations in the activity of the enzyme within a 
group of animals eating much the same quantity of food from 
day to day and from week to week ( Table I )• Only when both 
consumption and tributyrinase vary markedly from the normal 
ranges, as in the alloxan diabetic group ( Table II ) is 
this correlation readily shown. 

The fact that a correlation between food intake and 
serum tributyrinase concentration could be obtained under 
certain conditions led to a consideration of the effect on 
the enzyme of various dietary constituents, notably fat. In 
this regard, H@ss and Vioilier (16) have reported that the 
absence of fat from the diet reduces the serum tributyrinase 
content of rat plasma*

(II#) The effect of dietary hydrogenated vegetable fat on the 

serum tributyrinase levels and growth of male rats# 

(i) On the serum tributyrinase levels of weanling male rats# 

Groups of ten weanling male rats were fed ad libitum 
for six week periods on a number of synthetic diets containing 
the various levels of fat indicated in Table III# Each diet 
(diets 3 to 7 inclusive) contained 2 % cod liver oil and the 
balance of the fat was made up with Grisco* Tributyrinase levels 
were estimated weekly except at the end of the first week, when 
the animals were too small to bleed* The daily food intake of 
individual animals was variable on some of the diets, especially 
when higher concentrations of fat were fed* Consequently the 
values for food consumption reported in Table III in grams eaten 
per rat per day are the means of the total food eaten by the ten 
animals of each group over a period of one week# From the food 
consumption data the amount of fat eaten per rat per day has 
been calculated* 

A significant correlation exists between the amount of 
fat eaten daily by weanling rats and the levels of serum 
tributyrinase* The value of r _ 0.71* The formula of the 
regression line shown in Figure 2 is T = -33F + 5I|0 
(T— tributyrinase in units/100 ml# serum and F — fat consumption 
in gm*/day/rat*) and this has a highly significant value of 
t - 5*2. The standard error of the estimate for the line is±5l.

(ii) The effect on the serum tributyrinase levels of 
adult male rats. 


The preceding experiment was repeated with a group of 
ten normal adult male rats. Tributyrinase activities were 
determined at the end of each week of the feeding period. As 
with the weanling animals the average daily consumption of food 
became less as the fat concentration of the diets was increased. 
The daily consumption of fat once more was higher as the dietary 
fat concentration was increased. A highly significant correlation 
exists between the coasumption and enzyme data given in Table IV. 

( r = 0.?8 ). 

The formula of the regression line shown in Figure 3 is 
T = 33F +■ 390 ( T » tributyrinase in units/lGO ml. serum and 
F = fat consumption in gm./day/rat. ) and this has a highly 
significant t value of 6.9. The standard error of the estimate 
for this regression line is it 5$. 

A striking fact concerning the regression lines for the 
above two experiments is that the slopes have opposite signs. 

The increased lipolytic activity of serum associated with 
increased fat ingestion in the case of adult animals could be 
expected if serum tributyrinase has a role in the metabolism 
of fats. The findings with weanling animals is surprising. 

The data in Table V offers some explanation.

(iii) Growth of weanling male rats on hydrogenated vegetable fat. 

The growth of weanling rats fed the various diets listed 
in Table V was best on Checkers, which contained about 5$ fat. 
Growth on the synthetic diets containing 5 and 10$ fat was not 
as good, but they were not as palatable as the Checkers, judging 
by consumption data. This diminished rate of growth can b© 
accounted for on the basis of lowered daily food consumption 
which in 9 week old rats (at the end of the 6 week feeding 
periods) ranges from 20 grams on the Checker diet to 6.2 grams 
on the 60$ fat diet. The synthetic diets which contained mere 
than 5$ fat not only interfered with the rate of growth, because 
of inadequate protein intake, but tended to maintain the mean 
tributyrinase levels near the values of 320 to 1*80 units per 
100 ml. reported by Tuba and Hoar© (37) for 3 to k week old rats. 

After the termination of the feeding experiments, each 
group of animals was placed on Checkers for one week. An 
improvement in the rate of growth was noted in all but one 
group, and the enzyme levels increased toward the range ©f 
values characteristic of the stock laboratory diet. 

Deuel and his co-workers (9) found that rats fed ad 
libitum on synthetic diets containing 5 to !?0$ fat showed 
better growth than those fed lower concentrations of fat or 
a stock laboratory diet. Their results were similar for 
cottonseed oil and a hydrogenated vegetable fat, mar garine.

Barki, Collins, Elvehjem, and Hart (5) fed various levels of 
three vegetable oils and butter to growing rats and observed 
that the dietary concentration of each for optimal growth was 
characteristic of the fat* These levels were 10$ for corn 
oil and 35% for butter fat, whereas coconut oil and soybean 
oil concentrations had no effect on growth. In our experiments, 
which were primarily designed for tributyrinase studies, the 
closest approximation to both “normal ,f growth and serum tributyrinase 
activity was obtained with the synthetic diet containing 5% fat* 

Our results are probably affected to some extent by the fact that 
each synthetic diet contained 2% cod liver oil.

(II'I) The effects of some fats and oils on the serum 

tributyrinase levels of adult male rats# 

After we had shown that the amount of Crisco ingested 
could be related to the serum tributyrinase levels we decided 
to extend the investigation to include other dietary fats* 
Furthermore, we wished to find out if differences in composition 
of these fats would give rise to variations in the lipolytic 
activity of rat serum* Accordingly we selected the following 
fats and oils: butter, cottonseed oil, linseed oil, corn oil, 
and olive oil* Butter was chosen because it has the most 
constant composition of any animal fat and because it contains 
a large proportion of short chain fatty acids* The vegetable 
oils varied in the amounts and kinds of fatty acids which they 
contained and in their tocopherol content* 

Ten groups, each containing six adult male rats, were 
fed Checkers ad libitum for one week* At the end of this pre~ 
experimental feeding period the initial tributyrinase values 
were determined (Table VI) and the animals were weighed* They 
were then fed diets 8 to 17 for a period of four weeks* The 
mean tributyrinase levels, mean changes in body weight, and the 
mean food consumption, for each group during the four week test 
period are listed in Table VI. 

Studies on diets h and S» which were conducted as a 
part of the previous experiment on the effect of a hydrogenated 
vegetable fat on the serum tributyrinase levels of adult male

rats, are also included for comparison in this section* To 
simplify the statistical analyses and graphs the serum 
tributyrinase values for four weeks only and for the first 
six rats of each of the two groups on the Crisco diets are 
considered* 

Statistical analysis of the food consumption data 
shows that no significant differences exist between the six 
groups of animals fed diets containing 8 % fat and the same is 
true for the six groups of rats fed diets containing 23$ fat* 

There is of course a significant difference in the amount of 
fat ingested by the six groups of rats eating the 8% fat diets 
and the six groups receiving the 23 $ fat diets* 

An analysis of variance of the serum tributyrinase 
levels for all twelve groups of rats indicates that many significant 
differences exist* The calculated minimum significant difference 
is ±1*0 tributyrinase units per 100 ml* serum* This means that 
if the difference between the mean values for any two groups of 
rats during the four week test period exceeds I 4 .O tributyrinase 
units then the two groups can be said to differ significantly 
from each other* 

It can be seen from Table VI*, that for each fat fed, 
a significant difference in tributyrinase levels exists between 
each group of rats eating a diet containing 8% fat and the group 
eating 23$ of the same fat* This can be accounted for on the 
basis of differences in the amount of fat ingested* Other

(38) 


significant differences in the tributyrinase levels can be 
detected which cannot be accounted for on the basis of 
variations in fat consumption* For example* if we consider 
the six groups of rats on the diets containing 8$ fat we can 
see that Crisco does not differ significantly from butter as 
far as the effect on serum tributyrinase is concerned but it 
does differ significantly from all the other fats. Furthermore* 
it can be seen that the effect of butter differs significantly 
from every other fat which was fed with the exception of Grisco* 
These variations can be accounted for only on the basis of 
dissimilarities in the composition of the fats. At the 23% 
fat levels fewer significant differences exist and this 
suggests that there my be a dietary concentration of fat 
below 23% for which the serum tributyrinase shows its maximum 
response* 

It can be seen from Table ¥1.* that on the basis of 
decreasing magnitude of tributyrinase levels the various fats 
tested can be arranged in the following order; Crisco* butter* 
cottonseed oil* linseed ©11* corn oil* and olive oil* It might 
be noted that at the 23% fat level the mean serum tributyrinase 
value for diet 13* which contained butter, was much lower than 
it should have been according t© the position it has been given 
in the order listed above* This apparent discrepancy may be 
accounted for by the fact that butter contains some 1$% water 




(39) 


as well as traces of other non-lipid materials* The difference 
is not great at the 8# fat level but it is magnified almost 
threefold at the 23% fat level* If this Is corrected for, then 
batter may occupy the position given it in Table VI* 

We could find no single factor on the basis of which the 
above results could be explained. The order of the serum 
tributyrinase values parallels the total molar fatty acid 
content more closely than any other single variable to which 
they were compared. Our endeavours along this line led us to 
believe that probably there my be a number of factors involved 
which might affect the relationship between the amount of fat 
eaten and the serum tributyrinase levels®

(IV} The effects of some derived lipids and fat soluble 
vitamins on the serum tributyrinase levels of adult 


male rats. 


Our previous experiments have shown that both the amount 
and kind of fat ingested influence the serum tributyrinase levels 
of adult male rats. A careful scrutiny of the results obtained 
by feeding various kinds of fats indicated that perhaps the total 
number of moles of fatty acids ingested might be the principle 
factor responsible for the alterations in the serum tributyrinase 
content of rat serum. It has been stated by various workers (33)* 
(3i0* that some of the fat soluble vitamins affect the levels of 
various esterases of the serum. Hess and Viollier in 191*8 (16), 
and other authors (7)* have shown that in E avitaminotic female 
rats the cholinesterase activity was below normal. We felt, 
therefore, that we should also test the effects of ingestion 
of the fat soluble vitamins A, D, and E, on the serum tributyrinase 
levels® 

Adult male rats weighing at least 2f>0 grams were housed 
in individual cages and given food and water ad libitum. The 
daily food consumption, body weight, and levels of serum 
tributyrinase were determined for each animal after they had 
received Purina Fox Checkers for one week. After these initial 
values had been established, the animals were placed in groups 
of six on the diets indicated below, for periods of four weeks.

and at the end of each week the various experimental data were 
again obtained, as well as at the end of the fifth week during 
which interval of time the animals were starved* 

The rats were fed diets 18 to 23 inclusive, during the 
four week test period. Diet 18 was a control diet which was 
fat free but it contained the fat soluble vitamins A, D, and E. 
Diet 23 was also a control diet and in addition to the fat 
soluble vitamins mentioned above it contained 10$ Crisco. 

Diet 19 consisted of the basal control diet, with the crystalline 
vitamins A, D, and E omitted, in order to estimate the effect, 
if any, of these three substances on the serum enzyme. The 
remainder of the diets were devised to test the effect on the 
serum tributyrinase of the glycerol, oleic acid, or stearic 
acid, present in a diet containing 10$ triglyceride* Diets 20 
and 22 contained an amount of glycerol and stearic acid, 
respectively, that would be equivalent to that present in a 
10$ tristearin diet* Diet 21 contained an amount of oleic 
acid which would be equivalent to that found in a 10$ triolein 
diet* 

The effects of the six diets on the levels of serum 
tributyrinase are indicated in Table VII. Enzyme levels at 
zero time and means of the four weekly values obtained during 
the test period are presented, as well as the average daily food 
consumption and changes in body weight* The changes in body

weight which occurred as a result of feeding each diet for 
four weeks show that in every case the animals gained weight* 
Weekly fluctuations in the serum tributyrinase levels are show 
in figure 10* 

The weight gains of the six groups of animals after 
four weeks on the diets were not significantly different from 
each other, despite the fact that the first three diets were 
fat free* This may be taken as an indication that the food 
consumption was adequate and that the animals were in good 
health in every case* The animals must also have had ample 
reserves of the three fat soluble vitamins A, D, and E, and 
of the essential fatty acids to carry them through the test 
period when they were receiving diets lacking these nutritional 
factors* There are no significant differences in food consumption 
on the basis of which the enzyme levels can be interpreted* 

The serum tributyrinase values of the animals receiving 
the first three diets are the lowest of the six groups, and 
they do not differ significantly from each other* A fat free 
diet, therefore, results in a profound decrease in enzyme 
activity from the levels found in animals receiving the stock 
laboratory ration* This change is not modified by the absence 
of the fat soluble vitamins A, D, and E, (diet 19) or by the 
addition of glycerol (diet 20)*

serum tributyrinase activity which is in each case significantly 
greater than what may be considered a basal value established 
by the three fat free diets. The enzyme levels for diets 22 
and 23 do not differ significantly from each other. It is of 
importance to note that values for these two diets are not as 
great as those obtained with all six groups during the initial 
period on Purina Fox Checkers. Since the Checkers contain 
approximately 5$ total w fat M , there must be present lipids or 
other factors which effect the serum tributyrinase activity, 
and therefore levels of the enzyme in the serum of animals 
receiving this diet cannot be accounted for on the basis of 
the ingestion of triglycerides or saturated fatty acids alone* 

The use of oleic acid (diet 21) as a supplement to the 
basal diet produced tributyrinase levels which were significantly 
greater than those obtained for any of the other groups that were 
tested. However, in spite of the fact that fatty acid equivalent 
to 10$ triglyceride was present in the diet, enzyme activity was 
not as high as with Checkers. 

It was possible to conclude from this experiment that 
the ingestion of the fat soluble vitamins A, D, and E, does not 
affect the serum tributyrinase levels to any appreciable extent. 
The same appears to be true for glycerol. It is difficult to 
draw any concrete conclusions regarding the stearic and oleic 
acids because our previous experiments (diets 8 to 17) seem to

indicate that diets of high oleic acid content should produce 
lower enzyme levels than the diets rich in unsaturated fatty 
acids, if they are to have an effect at all. Perhaps further 
studies involving other fatty acids varying in chain length 
and degree of saturation might throw some light on this problem.

2% cod liver oil, for six weeks and their tributyrinase levels 
were determined weekly. The first group consisted of six adult 
male rats and the second group contained six weanling male rats* 

In both cases the enzyme levels were very low and although this 
is to be expected in the adult animals it is surprising, in the 
light of our experiments with Crisco, to find such low values in 
weanling rats* The regression line for this experiment, (figure 2) 
might lead us to expect higher enzyme levels In the case of 
weanling rats on diets low in fat, such as 2% cod liver oil* 

In the experiment in which the fat soluble vitamins were 
added to diets free of fat (diets 18 and 20) the tributyrinase 
levels for adult male rats were lower than those obtained with 
diet 2 which contained only 2% cod liver oil* Diets 2 and 19 
were fed to adult male rats and the resulting tributyrinase 
levels for diet 2 (Table XI) were significantly higher than the 
values obtained with diet 19 (Table VU)* This is an important 
point to keep in mind when conducting further dietary studies* 

It is undoubtedly a fact that the cod liver oil in various diets 
modifies the effect of other dietary fats on the serum 
tributyrinase levels* This modifying effect may be eliminated 
by adding concentrates of the fat soluble vitamins or by feeding 
the purified vitamins as we did with diets 18 to 23*

(VI^ Inanition experiments* 

Tuba and Hoare (37) reported that adult male rats 
which had been starved for a period of one week showed 
virtually no change in their serum tributyrinase levels* 

This observation appears unusual in the light of results 
which were presented earlier in this thesis with regard to 
the experiments on diets of graded fat content and fat free 
diets* Our findings suggested that the tributyrinase levels 
of adult male rats should be very low when the animals were 
completely deprived of food and hence of dietary fat (Table VII 
and Figure 10). This inconsistancy between the tributyrinase 
levels of starved rats and the animals on diets free of fat 
prompted us to investigate further the effects of starvation 
from several different viewpoints* 

(i) The effects of prolonged starvation on the serum 
tributyrinase levels of adult male rats* 

Because Tuba and Hoare starved their animals for only 
one week we thought that perhaps the serum tributyrinase 
response could not be demonstrated in this length of time and 
therefore we starved the animals until a few had died. Six 
adult male rats were fed powdered Purina Fox Checkers ad libitum 
for one week and their normal tributyrinase levels were determined* 
They were then starved and the enzyme assays were repeated on the

seventh, eleventh, and fourteenth days* Table VIII shows the 
weights and tributyrinase levels for these animals over this 
test period* Green and Summers reported (llj.) that there is 
an increase in the serum w lipase w levels of dogs during 
prolonged starvation. Our results showed a slight increase 
in the serum tributyrinase levels of adult male rats on the 
seventh day but this elevation is not statistically significant* 
We found, however, that starvation beyond eleven days lowered 
the serum tributyrinase levels and that this decrease is 
significantly different from the Checker values* It is 
interesting to note that two of the animals succumbed after 
the bleeding on the fourteenth day* When animals were returned 
to ad libitum feeding on a Checker diet, for one week, the 
serum tributyrinase levels were raised to the "normal” range 
for this ration. 

(ii) The effect of limiting food intake on the serum 

tributyrinase levels of adult male rats* 

Complete deprivation of food did not reduce the serum 
tributyrinase levels until the animals were near death and 
therefore we thought that it might be possible to lower the 
enzyme levels by limiting the food intake of a group of 
animals. This experiment was also intended as a supplement 
to the experiments in which we attempted to correlate the

food intake with the serum tributyrinase levels of rats on a 
diet of powdered Purina Fox Checkers. We felt that perhaps 
the variation in serum tributyrinase levels within a group of 
adult male rats was so great that the small normal differences 
in fat consumption on a diet which only contained $. 2 % fat, 
would not be sufficient to produce a detectable change. 

Six mature male rats which had been eating powdered 
Checkers ad libitum for several weeks were then limited to 
If? grams each daily for one week. During the following four 
weeks they were maintained on daily levels of 12, 9* 6, and 
3 grams of food per day for one week on each successive 
decrement. The mean serum tributyrinase levels remained 
within the normal limits for the first four weeks of the 
experiment. Only at the end of the week on a daily intake 
of 3 grams of food did the results given in Table IK show a 
decline from normal serum tributyrinase concentrations. We 
were surprised to find that the enzyme levels in this 
experiment could not be correlated to food consumption. This 
brings to light a very important point. The serum tributyrinase 
is not only connected with the ingestion of fat but it would 
also appear to be associated in some manner with the utilization 
of body stores of lipids. Once again as might be expected the 
weights of the animals and the activity of the enzyme showed no 


correlation.

(iii) The effects of post-dietary starvation on the serum 

tributyrinase levels of adult male rats after feeding 

various synthetic diets* 

The previous inanition experiments seem to indicate 
that starvation exerts a special effect on the serum 
tributyrinase levels of adult male rats* We felt that some 
new light might be thrown on in vivo lipolysis if rats were 
starved alter feeding various synthetic diets containing known 
kinds and amounts of fats* The effects of post-dietary 
starvation on the serum tributyrinase, following the feeding 
of twelve synthetic diets, are indicated in Table X* Enzyme 
levels for zero time, and means for the four weekly values 
obtained during the test periods are presented again (see also 
Tables VI and VII) for comparative purposes, as well as the 
initial mean weights and changes in body weight. It should be 
noted that there are large variations in the amount of body 
weight gained on the various diets while the amount of weight 
lost in all the starvation experiments is relatively constant. 
Since only adult male rats were used the weight gains during 
the experimental period can be attributed to increased deposition 
of fat. During the post-experimental starvation period the fat 
depots would be used by the animals as a source of energy. 

The starvation values obtained for each group of 
animals may be compared with the aid of the calculated minimum

significant difference, which was 11*0 tributyrinase units 
per 100 ml* serum. Starvation following four weeks feeding 
on the two diets which contained butter (diets 8 and 13) 
produced slightly lowered tributyrinase levels which were 
barely significant. Total deprivation of food after 
feeding diet 10, which contained linseed oil, failed to 
elevate the tributyrinase levels significantly. Post-dietary 
fasting after the test periods on all the other diets resulted 
in significant elevations of the tributyrinase levels. The 
increases in serum tributyrinase levels for the two groups 
of rats which had been starved after feeding on diets 21 and 
23, which contained oleic acid and Crisco respectively, are 
just barely significant. The increase in tributyrinase 
activity, which resulted from starvation of the group of 
animals that were fed the stearic acid diet, was just 
significant. All the other elevations are either very 
significant of highly significant. 

The above experiment indicates that the previous 
dietary history may affect the tributyrinase levels produced 
during starvation. This would appear logical since several 
workers have demonstrated that the composition of the depot 
fat depends to some extent on the type of fat fed an animal 
(17). It is curious that an enzyme which splits tributyrin 
should be so intimately concerned with oleic acid. This 
problem remains for further investigation.

(VII.) The effects of pre-dietary and post-dietary feeding of 
Checkers on the serum tributyrinase levels of weanling 

and adult male rats. 

Tables XI and XHillustrate the effects of pre-dietary 
feeding of Checkers to adult male animals and the post-dietary 
feeding of Checkers to both adult and weanling male rats. The 
weanling rats were not fed Checkers prior to the feeding of the 
test diets because we were primarily interested in noting the 
effects of the experimental diets immediately after weaning* 

It may be noted in Table XI that pre-experimental 
feeding of Purina Fox Checkers to adult male rats gives rise 
to relatively high tributyrinase levels and that these can be 
equalled only by diets containing large amounts of Crisco 
(diets 6 and 7). The post-dietary feeding of Checkers gives 
rise to enzyme levels which are somewhat lower than the 
pre-experimental levels and the difference is statistically 
significant* This could be accounted for on the basis that 
it may take longer than one week for the enzyme activity to 
return to values characteristic of this diet* 

The serum tributyrinase levels in weanling rats responded 
to post-dietary Checker feeding in a manner similar to the adult 
animals. This may appear surprising in view of the opposing 
results obtained with the Crisco diets* (Figures 2 and 3)« It 
must be realized, however, that these animals, after seven

weeks on experiment, have reached a period of adolescence and 
it can no longer be said that the newly established tributyrinase 
levels are those of M weanling ,f animals. Even so the picture is 
puzzling and it is quite possible that other factors may be 
involved. Once again it can be seen from Tables XL and XU that 
previous dietary history might influence the serum tributyrinase 
levels.

(VIII^ The effects of various normal and experimental conditions 

on the serum tributyrinase levels of male rats* 

Some odd bits of information were compiled and subjected 
to statistical analysis with very interesting results. The 
minimum significant difference for the mean values listed in 
Table XM is ± 30 tributyrinase units per 100 ml. serum. Tuba 
and Hoare (36) have reported that the ’’normal range” for serum 
tributyrinase levels in adult male rats on a Checker diet is 
from 1*60 to 700 units per 100 ml. serum. An examination of 
Table XU, with the aid of the minimum significant difference 
listed above, shows that significant variations due to other 
factors may occur within this range. Starvation values have 
been obtained which are well within the reported ”normal 
range” for animals on a Checker diet. Furthermore, it can 
be seen that variations in the manner in which an experiment 
is carried out can cause significant differences in the 
tributyrin splitting power of rat serum. Previous dietary 
history, for example, can alter the enzyme levels of adult 
male rats as evidenced by the values for the starvation 
experiments. In previous sections we have shown that the 
amount of fat ingested influences the serum tributyrinase 
levels and once again the most striking effect on the enzyme 
values (Table XJE) was due to diets free of fat.

It is important to keep in mind, however, that other 


factors may play an important part in establishing the 
lipolytic activity of rat serum. The differences in 
behaviour between adult and weanling rats on Crisco diets 
have not been fully explained. Other factors which deserve 
further investigation are, first of all, the relatively high 
tributyrinase levels established during periods of food deprivation 
and secondly, the behaviour of this enzyme in weanling rats. 
Although some light has been thrown on various factors which 
affect rat serum tributyrinase the priciple problems concerning 
its exact physiological functions and origin remain unanswered.

SUMMARY, 

(i) Variations in the serum tributyrinase levels of 
normal adult and weanling made rats could not be accounted 
for on the basis of consumption of Purina Fox Checkers. 

The high tributyrinase levels of alloxan diabetic rats can 
be correlated to the amount of Checkers ingested daily. In 
the case of the diabetic rats, however, the amount of food 
consumed was very much greater and showed more individual 
variation than in the case of the normal animals. 

(ii) Adult male rats showed a positive correlation between 
the serum tributyrinase levels and the daily consumption of 
Crisco, a hydrogenated vegetable fat. The opposite effect 
was obtained with weanling animals. Their serum tributyrinase 
levels decreased with increased ingestion of Crisco. It is 
thought that this was possibly due to retarded growth as a 
result of reduced protein intake on the diets of higher fat 
content. 


(iii) The correlation, in the case of the adult animals, was 
found to apply not only in the case of dietary Crisco but also 
with various other fats which were tested. The nature of the 
dietary fat was also found to influence the enzyme activity. 
The effects due to the different fats cannot be accounted for 
on the basis of differences in fat consumption.

(iv) Various derived lipids and fat soluble vitamins were 
also fed in order to test their effects on the serum tributyrinase 
levels. It was found that diets free of fat produced minimal 
levels and ingestion of the fat soluble vitamins A, D, and E, 
or glycerol, did not alter these basal enzyme levels. Oleic 
acid and stearic acid both increased the serum tributyrinase 
levels when ingested by adult male rats and this effect was 
most pronounced with oleic acid. 

(v) Cod liver oil itself affects the serum tributyrinase 
levels and undoubtedly modifies the effects produced by other 
dietary fats. Concentrates of the fat soluble vitamins or the 
use of a mixture of the pure vitamins could replace the cod 
liver oil usually used in synthetic diets and thereby obviate 
its effects. 

(vi) From inanition experiments it was possible to conclu.de 
that a tributyrin hydrolyzing enzyme present in the serum of 
adult male rats was in some way connected with the utilization 
of the body depot fats during starvation. 

(vii) Information was compiled and subjected to statistical 
analysis in order to demonstrate differences in the serum 
tributyrinase levels due to variations in experimental procedure, 
starvation, and diets deficient in fat* It appears that 
statistically significant differences may occur within what is 
usually considered a "normal range" for the enzyme.

ON RAT SERUM LIPASE 

III. THE EFFECT OF TOTAL FOOD CONSUMPTION AND OF 
DIETARY HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE FAT 1 

By Jules Tuba and Jack D. Taylor 

Abstract 

There is no correlation in either weanling or adult normal male rats between 
daily food consumption of a stock laboratory diet and serum tributyrinase 
activity. Limiting the food intake of adult male rats has no statistically signi¬ 
ficant effects on serum tributyrinase. The abnormally elevated serum tribu¬ 
tyrinase levels of alloxan diabetic adult male rats may be accounted for on the 
basis of increased food consumption. Weanling and adult male animals main¬ 
tained on synthetic diets containing from 5 to 60% fat show a correlation between 
serum tributyrinase concentration and daily fat consumption. In the case of 
adult rats increased fat ingestion is accompanied by increased enzyme activity. 
However, with weanling rats increased fat consumption results in lowered 
tributyrinase concentrations and retarded growth. The results with growing 
animals are attributed to the decreased intake of food, and the corresponding 
decrease in protein consumption, which accompanies the increase in dietary fat 
concentration. Replacement of the synthetic diets by the stock laboratory diet 
is followed by altered tributyrinase levels in both weanling and adult animals. 


Introduction 

A striking characteristic of adult rat serum lipase noted by Tuba and 
Hoare (5) was that throughout a starvation period of one week enzyme con¬ 
centrations remained at normal levels. Repetition of this experiment by us 
indicated that this finding held true for periods of starvation up to 14 days 
and only a day or so before death did lipase values decrease. It therefore 
appeared probable that variations in food intake would not likely account 
for the altered lipase levels which were found associated with various experi¬ 
mental states (5). Independence of serum lipase concentration and daily 
food consumption would thus be the opposite of findings in this laboratory 
with rat serum alkaline phosphatase. In the case of the latter enzyme, Tuba 
and Madsen (6) have shown a highly significant correlation with consumption 
of food, particularly of fat, except in the presence of certain modifying dietary 
factors. In spite of the findings with starved animals, an attempt was made 
to correlate serum lipase levels of both weanling and adult male rats with-the 
daily ingestion of stock laboratory diet and of a hydrogenated vegetable fat, 
Crisco. The relationship of food consumption and activity of the enzyme 
was considered in alloxan diabetic adult male rats as well. 

Experimental 

Animals were housed in individual cages and were given food as described 
below for individual experiments. Weights were noted at weekly intervals 
and these observations were used as a check on the health or rate of growth

of the animals on the different diets. Data concerning weights is included 
in the tables only when correlation with lipase concentrations has been found. 

In order to determine the effect of total daily food consumption the animals 
were maintained on the stock laboratory diet of Purina Fox Checkers, which 
were powdered in order to minimize scattering by the rats. This was fed to 
weanling, normal adult, and alloxan diabetic adult rats. The effect of fat 
was tested by feeding synthetic diets which contained 5%, 10%, 25%, 40%, 
and 60% of this dietary constituent to weanling and normal adult male rats. 
Each synthetic diet contained 2% cod liver oil and the remainder of the fat 
was made up with Crisco, a hydrogenated vegetable fat. Each of this group 
of diets contained 20% casein, 40% McCollum’s salt mixture, and the remain¬ 
ing fraction was made up with sucrose in every case. Adequate amounts of the 
following vitamins were added: thiamine hydrochloride, pyridoxine hydro¬ 
chloride, calcium pantothenate, niacin, riboflavin, and choline. Consumption 
by each animal was noted daily. In order to simplify reports of data and 
statistical studies, consumption figures for each group were totaled every 
week, and the values appearing in the tables are the averages in grams per rat 
per day for each week of the test period for each diet. 

Serum tributyrinase levels were determined once a week by means of the 
titrimetric micromethod of Tuba and Hoare (4). The tributyrinase activity 
of serum in units is equivalent to the number of milliliters of 0.025 N sodium 
hydroxide required to neutralize the butyric acid set free by the enzyme 
contained in 100 ml. serum in 30 min. at pH 8.05 and 37° C. 

Results 

The Effect of Total Food Consumption 

In Normal Weanling and Adult Male Rats 

Six weanling male rats, 21 days old, and six adult rats were placed on the diet 
of powdered Checkers, which they received ad libitum for six weeks. The 
means of the results for these two experiments are given in Table I. There is 
no correlation between daily food consumption and serum tributyrinase 
activity in either growing or mature animals (r = 0.06 and 0.01 respectively). 
There is, however, a highly significant correlation between the weights of the 
animals and tributyrinase levels in the weanling group {r = 0.56 at the 1% 
level). This further confirms the observations of Tuba and Hoare (5) that 
serum tributyrinase levels increase from low levels at birth to higher levels 
which become constant in the mature animal. The lack of correlation 
between the weights of the adult group and their serum tributyrinase levels 
(r = 0.16) is therefore to be expected. 

The effect of limiting the food intake of normal adult animals was tested 
also. Six mature male rats which had been eating powdered Checkers ad 
libitum for several weeks were then limited to 15 gm. each daily for one week. 
During the following four weeks they were maintained on daily levels of 12, 
9, 6, and 3 gm. of food for one week on each successive decrement. The mean 
serum tributyrinase levels for the group remained within normal limits for the

In Alloxan Diabetic Adult Male Rats 

Six alloxan diabetic rats with pronounced hyperglycemia were used for this 
experiment. The mean serum lipase activity of the group was well above 
normal, in accordance with the findings of Tuba and Hoare (5). These 
animals were fed powdered Checkers ad libitum for six days. The amount of 
food eaten by each animal was measured daily and serum lipase activity was 
estimated every two days. The mean lipase values for this group are given 
in Table III as well as the mean average food consumption for the 24 hr. 
immediately preceding the bleeding for determination of tributyrinase levels.

The regression line shown in Fig. 1 was calculated from the three lipase 
values and the six daily consumption levels determined for each rat during the 
course of the above experiment. The calculated equation for this regression 
line is T = 44C — 636 (T = tributyrinase and C = food consumption) and 
this has a highly significant t value = 3.1 {P < 0.01). This, together with 
the value of r = 0.64 for the data of Table III, indicates that there is a highly 
significant correlation between food ingested and serum tributyrinase concen¬ 
tration in alloxan diabetic adult male rats. 

A simple arithmetic comparison of the consumption and enzyme data of 
the preceding three tables seems to indicate that the abnormally high tribu¬ 
tyrinase activity associated with alloxan diabetes in rats is largely attributable 
to the increase in food consumption. This can readily be proved statistically. 
We have used the individual consumption and lipase data for six alloxan 
diabetic rats (Table III) and for six normal adult rats (last three weeks in 
Table I) and there is a highly significant correlation; r = 0.63 with a t value 
of 3.59 at the 1% level. 

It was shown above that this correlation does not exist in normal adult rats 
receiving food ad libitum or in limited amounts. When the animals are 
starved or receive restricted amounts of food it would appear that the levels of 
serum tributyrinase must remain at or above certain unknown values and 
that the rats die when the enzyme concentration falls below these levels. 
The lack of correlation in normal adult rats eating unrestricted amounts of

powdered Checkers is probably due to the wide fluctuations in the activity of 
the enzyme in a group of animals eating much the same quantity of food from 
day to day and week to week (Table I), and it should be noted that the value

laboratory diet and serum tributyrinase levels in alloxan diabetic adult male rats. 

of r for this experiment is almost significant. Only when both consumption 
and lipase vary markedly from the normal ranges, as in the alloxan diabetic 
group (Table III) is this correlation readily shown. 

The fact that a correlation between food intake and serum tributyrinase 
concentration could be obtained under certain conditions led to a consideration 
of the effect on the enzyme of various dietary constituents, notably fat. In 
this regard, Hess and Viollier (3) have reported that the absence of fat from 
the diet reduces the serum tributyrinase content of rat plasma. 

The Effect of Dietary Hydrogenated Vegetable Fat 
In Weanling Male Rats 

Groups of 10 weanling male rats were fed ad libitum for six week periods 
on a number of synthetic diets containing the various levels of fat indicated 
in Table IV. Each diet contained 2% cod liver oil and the balance of the fat

was made up with Crisco. Lipases were estimated weekly except at the end 
of the first week, when the animals were too small to bleed. The daily food 
intake of individual animals was variable on some of the diets, especially when 
higher concentrations of fat were fed. Consequently the values for food 
consumption reported in Table IV in grams eaten per rat per day are the 
means of the total food eaten by the 10 animals of each group over a period 
of one week. From the food consumption data the amount of fat eaten per 
rat per day has been calculated. 

A significant correlation exists between the amount of fat eaten daily by 
weanling rats and the levels of serum tributyrinase. The value of r = 0.71. 
The formula of the regression line shown in Fig. 2 is T = — 33F + 540 
(T = tributyrinase and F = fat consumption) and this has a highly significant 
value of t = 5.2 at the 1% level. The standard error of estimate for the line 
in + 51.

In Adult Male Rats 

The preceding experiment was repeated with a group of 10 normal adult 
male rats. Lipases were determined at the end of each week of the feeding 
period. As with the weanling animals the average daily consumption of food 
became less as the fat concentration of the diets was increased. The daily 
consumption of fat once more was higher as the dietary fat concentration was 
increased. A highly significant correlation exists between the consumption 
and enzyme data given in Table V (r = 0.78 at the 1% level).

The formula of the regression line shown in Fig. 3 is T = + 33F + 385 
(T = tributyrinase and F = fat consumption) and this has a highly signi¬ 
ficant t value of 6.9 at the 1% level. The standard error of estimate for this 
regression line is + 55. 



Fig. 3. The regression line for the relationship between serum tributyrinase levels and 
fat consumed per day by normal adult rats. 


A striking fact concerning the regression lines for the above two experiments 
is that the slopes have opposite signs. The increased lipolytic activity of 
serum associated with increased fat ingestion in the case of adult animals 
could be expected if serum tributyrinase has a role in the metabolism of fats. 
The findings with weanling animals is surprising. The data in Table VI 
offers some explanation.

The growth of weanling rats fed the various diets listed in Table VI is best 
on Checkers, which contain about 5% fat. Growth on the synthetic diets 
containing 5 and 10% fat is not quite as good, but they are not as palatable as 
the Checkers, judging by consumption data. The diminished rate of growth 
on all the synthetic diets can be accounted for on the basis of lowered daily 
food consumption which in nine-week-old rats (at the end of the six week 
feeding periods) ranges from 20 gm. on the Checker diet to 6.2 gm. on the 60% 
fat diet. The synthetic diets which contain more than 5% fat not only inter¬ 
fere with the rate of growth, because of inadequate protein intake, but tend 
to maintain the mean lipase levels near the values of 317-484 units per 100 ml. 
reported by Tuba and Hoare (5) for three- to four-week-old rats. 

After the termination of the feeding experiments, each group of animals was 
placed on Checkers for one week. An improvement in the rate of growth was 
noted in all but one group, and the enzyme levels increased toward the range 
of values characteristic of the stock laboratory diet. 

Deuel and his co-workers (2) found that rats fed ad libitum on synthetic 
diets containing 5 to 50% fat showed better growth than those fed lower 
concentrations of fat or a stock laboratory diet. Their results were similar 
for cottonseed oil and a hydrogenated vegetable fat, margarine. Barki, 
Collins, Elvehjem, and Hart (1) fed various levels of three vegetable oils and 
butter to growing rats and observed that the dietary concentration of each for 
optimal growth was characteristic of the fat. These levels were 10% for corn 
oil and 35% for butter fat, whereas coconut oil or soybean oil concentrations 
had no effect on growth. In our experiments, which were primarily designed 
for lipase studies, the closest approximation to both “normal” growth and 
serum tributyrinase activity was obtained with the synthetic diet containing 
5% fat. Our results are probably affected to some extent by the fact that each 
synthetic diet contained 2% cod liver oil. However, experiments are now in 
progress with this and a number of other fats to see what effect they have on 
growth and lipase concentration. 

The adult animals used in our six week feeding tests gained 110 gm. on 
Checkers and from 85 to 125 gm. on the various synthetic diets. Transference 
from the synthetic diets to a diet of powdered Checkers for one week resulted 
in a return of tributyrinase activity to levels ranging from 510 to 630 units 
per 100 ml. which are typical for the stock laboratory diet. 

The problem of constancy of tributyrinase levels during starvation remains 
unanswered. Since diet does affect the activity of the enzyme, one can only 
assume until further work is done, that the starvation levels are associated 
with utilization of body stores of fat.
