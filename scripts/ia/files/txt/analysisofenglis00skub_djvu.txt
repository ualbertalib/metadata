CHAPTER I 


AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY 

The Problem 

for the past several years much concern has been shown 
by the superintendent of schools, the principals, and the 
teachers of the Smoky Lake School Division over the final 
results in grade twelve English. In the last twelve years 
the percentage of students scoring “B" or better on the 
departmental examination in grade twelve English has ranged 
from a low of approximately twenty per cent to a high of 
about fifty per cent, with the average percentage of passes 
below thirty-five per cent. This has been about twenty- 
five per cent below the provincial average# On the other 
hand the number of passes in other grade twelve subjects on 
the departmental examinations has been average or slightly 
above. Many students who were contemplating a university 
education have been delayed a year or two because they 
lacked the matriculation requirement in English. 

Apparently there has been considerable difficulty in 
expression in good fluent English among students throughout 
the grades in the Smoky Lake School Division. This has been 
reflected especially in written work. Several attempts have 
been made, through the use of standardized tests, to compare

results in the Smoky Lake School Division with norms sup¬ 
plied with the tests. However, very little attempt has been 
made to analyze the test results to determine the aspect of 
English where the greatest weaknesses lie. 

Other Investigations Studied 

The investigation conducted by Mr. G. H. Robinson*' on 
the analysis of errors made by 1238 non-English speaking 
pupils in the Lamont Inspectorate in 1934, the analysis of 

p 

errors as compiled by Mr. D. M. Sullivan on the grade nine 
and grade twelve examination papers in 1943 for twenty-four 
schools where pupils were predominantly of Ukrainian-speaking 
ancestry, and the study made by Mr. J* L. Gibeault^ on the 
effect of instruction in French upon the mastery of the 
English language in the English-french schools of the St. 

Paul Inspectorate in 1939, were all carefully studied. Al¬ 
though all were related to this investigation, no attempt 
has been made to duplicate any of the above studies.

Instead, the Investigator has, through the medium of stan¬ 
dardized tests, tried to discover the types of errors most 
common in the schools of the Smoky Lake School Division. An 
attempt has been made to determine the particular aspect or 
phase of the English language which seems to present the 
greatest difficulty, and to suggest possible means for im¬ 
proving standards of English. 

The Group Chosen for Study 

In this investigation, the students of grade ten were 
chosen for two reasons. First, the number of students was 
sufficiently large to enable the investigator to draw reason¬ 
able conclusions and yet not so large as to make the analysis 
cumbersome® Second, weaknesses and difficulties in English 
discovered in the Smoky Lake School Division could be dealt 
with in the two years before the students had completed grade 
twelve and had written their English 30 departmental examina¬ 
tion* The grade ten students of the McLeod School Division 
were chosen as the comparison group because it was assumed 
that.English does not present the same problem for them as 
it does for pupils in the Smoky Lake School Division. 

Methods Followed in this Investigation 

With the permission of Mr. W* E. Frame, Chief Superin¬ 
tendent of Schools for the Department of Education, and the

co-operation of Mr. W. S. Korek, Superintendent of Schools 
for the McLeod School Division, and of Mr. H. A. Kostash, 
Superintendent of Schools for the Smoky Lake School Divi¬ 
sion, the Go-onerative English Test. Single Booklet Edition . 
Higher Level, Form S was administered to all grade ten stu¬ 
dents in the two school divisions. In the Smoky Lake School 
Division, the tests were administered in December by one 
person so as to insure uniformity of directions and proce¬ 
dures. In the McLeod School Division, which was to provide 
the comparison group, the tests were administered a week 
later by the principals of the co-operating schools. The 
same directions and procedures were followed in each case. 

In this way results were obtained for 110 grade ten students 
in the Smoky Lake School Division and 94 grade ten students 
in the McLeod School Division. 

When all the test papers had been returned, they were 
scored according to the key, and the results compiled and 
tabulated. The raw scores were then converted into scaled 

4 

scores. Scaled scores made possible the comparison of each 
student T s achievement on one part of the test with that of 
any other, as well as comparison between each of the two 

4 

Scaled Scores are units so scaled that the scores will 
tend to form a normal distribution. It is so defined that a 

score of represents the seore which an average child 
would make at the end of a particular course, if he attended 
an average school and had taken the usual amount of the sub¬ 
ject in question.

groups of schools and the norms supplied with the tests, 

Comparisons between the groups of schools were made on 
the basis of average scaled scores on each of the three tests 
as well as certain parts of the tests. Average scaled scores 

were obtained for vocabulary,^ speed of comprehension,^ level 

1 8 
of comprehension, ' and total reading comprehension. Like¬ 
wise average scaled scores were obtained on mechanics of 
expression, effectiveness of expression, and total English 
scere^ on the three tests. Comparisons were also mad© for 
each part of the test on mechanics of expression: grammati¬ 
cal usage, punctuation, capitalization, and spelling. In 


5 

he Vocabulary Score Indicates the extensiveness of 
the individual’s word knowledge. Speed of word recognition 
plays little part in determining the vocabulary score* 

^The Speed of Comprehension Score represents the 
product of the rate at which an individual has attempted 
to comprehend the test material and his success in compre¬ 
hending it. It is not, like many speed of reading scores, 
merely a measure of the number of words read without regard 
to the thought content. 

7 

The Level of Comp rehens ion Score provides a measure of 
the ability of the student to comprehend materials of in¬ 
creasing difficulty at a rate at which he chooses to work. 

It is a measure of ,, power ,, or “depth" of comprehension, 
indicating the extent to which a pupil is able to grasp the 
full .import of what he reads. 

g 

The Total Beading Score is a composite score in which 
each of the other three scores has equal weight. It may be 
regarded as a measure of linguistic ability and an index of 
scholastic aptitude. 

? The Total English Score is a measure, in terms of 
scaled scores, of a pupil’s English ability where all three 
tests are given equal weight* All factors tested are taken 
into consideration in computing this score.

the absence of scaled scores on these parts, comparisons 
were made on the basis of the average number of correct 
answers. The test on effectiveness of expression gave part 
scores on sentence structure and style, active vocabulary, 
and organization. Again comparisons were made between the 
two groups of schools on the basis of the average number of 
correct answers. 

By reference to a booklet of norms supplied with the 
tests, it was possible to compare the sealed scores of stu¬ 
dents in the McLeod and Smoky Lake School Divisions with 
the scores made by 90,000 students In 200 Public Secondary 
Schools of the Sast, Middle West, and West United States. 

The Analysis of Errors 

All students 9 test papers from the Smoky Lake School 
Division were analyzed and the results tabulated to show the 
number of students who marked each possible response. Most 
of the questions on the test had four or five possible res¬ 
ponses. The students marked their choices on separate 
answer sheets. The analysis showed the number of students 
who marked response number one as the answer in any particu¬ 
lar question, the number who marked number two, and so on, 
as well as the number who did not attempt the item at all. 
The completed tabulation gave a clear picture of the number 
of students who gave the correct response in each question

and how the Incorrect responses were distributed among the 
other choices* ‘This gave the freqiency with which certain 
types of errors had been made. The investigator tried, 
wherever possible, to ascertain the reason for the errors 
made and to determine the probable underlying aspect of the 
English language which presents difficulties to the students 
in the Smoky Lake School Division. 

Schools Used in this Investigation 


The group of students under particular investigation 
was made up of all 110 students in the six schools of the 
Smoky Lake School Division* These schools were;

CHAPTER II 


THE NATURE OP THE TESTS 


The Cooperative English Test, Single Booklet Edition, 
is divided into tests of expression and tests of reading 
comprehension, involving respectively the active and pas¬ 
sive use of the language* The "Expression 1 * tests measure 
mechanics of expression: 

1. Grammatical Usage 
2* Punctuation and Capitalization 
5o Spelling 

and effectiveness of expression: 

1* Sentence Structure and Style 
2* Active Vocabulary 
3# Organization* 

The Reading Comprehension test, which is divided into a 
vocabulary section and a reading section provides four 
separate scores: 

1. Vocabulary Score 
2* Speed of Comprehension Score 
3* Level of Comprehension Score 
4* Total Reading Score. 

The Correlation Coefficients 


The authors of the tests state:

9 


In the vocabulary section of the test the average 
correlation coefficient between individual items and 
the total score is *52* For the reading section it 
is *40. Because the more discriminative items in the 
reading section tend to have been placed first in the 
test, those items which actually determine an indi¬ 
vidual’s score tend to have an average validity index 
greater than the average values presented above* This 
is a desirable feature of the test which operates to 
increase its accuracy of measurement* 

A study of the intereorrelation between the three 
part scores on the Cooperative Reading Comprehension 
Test indicates that they measure closely related 
abilities* An effort was made to reduce the effect 
of word knowledge on the comprehension scores by con¬ 
trolling the vocabulary level of the reading sections. 
That this effort was fairly successful is indicated by 
the only moderately high correlations between Vocabu¬ 
lary and Speed of Comprehension (*75 at both higher 
and lower levels) and between Vocabulary and Level of 
Comprehension (*72 at the higher level)* The correla¬ 
tion between Level of Comprehension and Speed of Com¬ 
prehension Is *87. 

The value of the intercorrelations between the 
scores on Test A: Mechanics of Expression . Test B: 
Effectiveness of Expression , and Test C: Heading 
Comprehension indicate that these tests measure re¬ 
lated abilities; the correlation between Mechanics 
and Effectiveness is *67* that between Mechanics 
and Reading Comprehension is *60, and between Effec¬ 
tiveness and Reading Comprehension is *74.^-° 

However, since the reliability coefficients for the tests 

are higher than these figures, the factors covered by the 

separate tests appear to differ sufficiently to justify 

separate measure.

English Tests -- Their Construction. Interpretation, and 

Use . New York, Cooperative Test Service, 19.50.

Bear^ reports that 

Reliability coefficients have been computed which 
show considerable stability at the 50 point of the 
scaled scores* These range from .75 on Cl and #82 
on C2 for a level of comprehension with only one 
scale completed to better than .90 for vocabulary and 
total scores. For secondary and college groups, cor¬ 
relations of between .70 and .80 with intelligence 
tests have been reported, and of between .59 and .73 
with school marks. Thus, we may conclude that these 
reading tests have about the same relation to school 
achievement as do group intelligence tests. 

12 

Harris indicates in his review that 

The one validity study referred to in the des¬ 
cription of the tests is the one in which Form 0M 
and 1957 Form were correlated with several different 
criteria, one of which was the teacher*s estimate of 
excellence in using oral and written English; the 
median of the product-moment coefficients of corre¬ 
lation between the tests and the teachers* estimate 
was .53* However the reliability of these estimates 
is probably low and the estimates were made on a 
five-point scale which introduces an upper limit 
for x that is below unity; this median value, then 
is probably conservative. 


The Reading Test 


The reading section of the test used is based on the 
premise that reading comprehension is essentially a thinking 
process, a process which requires mental facility in manipu¬ 
lating verbal concepts, a background of experience, and skill

Tests," Oscar K. Buros, ed., The Third Mental Measurements

in the specialized techniques of reading comprehension. 

These three interrelated abilities, when combined with skill 
in the mechanics of reading, determined the level of compre¬ 
hension which any student attained. It also determined the 
maximum speed with which a student was able to read and com¬ 
prehend materials of a given level of difficulty for a 
specific purpose. 

Although there are literally hundreds of skills in¬ 
volved in reading comprehension, the ones found on the test 
may be classified under these main headings: 

I. Vocabulary (60 five-choice items; 13 minutes) 

A. Recognition Vocabulary 

1. items using words of increasing difficulty 

2. items requiring increasingly close discrimina¬ 
tion (among the choices) 

II. Reading (90 five-choice items; 23 minutes) 

A. Determining the meaning of words from context 

1. meanings selected to harmonize with the content 

2. meanings determined by figures of speech or the 
tone of the writer 

B. Organizing meanings 

1. connecting preceding thought with present and 
oncoming thought 

/ 

2. giving each element its appropriate weight 

C* Construing the writer f s meaning 

1. determining the central thought

2* understanding statements from the passage which 
support the principal thought 

5* understanding new statements which support the 
principal thought 

D. Drawing conclusions from the content 

1. making interpretations not stated in the 
passage about the central thought 

2. determining the writer’s tone 

5. determining the writer’s intent 

4. determining the writer’s point of view 

5* recognizing the methods used in developing 
the passage 

6* evaluating the thought content 

7* generalizing by applying the conclusions to 
different situations 

The Expression Tests 

The expression tests included tests covering two aspects 
of the active use of English. The first, Test A: Mechanics 
of Expression , concerned matters of correct usage in grammar 
and syntax (15 minutes), punctuation and capitalization (15 
minutes), and spelling (10 minutes). The second, Test B2: 
Effectiveness of Expression , attempted to measure those 
factors of effective self-expression which lend themselves 
to objective testing techniques. The factors included 
sentence sense and a feeling for style (15 minutes); extent 
of active vocabulary (10 minutes); and ability to organize 
materials effectively (15 minutes). 









13 


The items dealing with sentence structure and style 
tested the following: 

1. Avoidance of unjustified partial sentences 

2. Avoidance of unjustified "comma splice" 

3* Avoidance of strung-out sentences 

4. Proper placing of modifiers 

9* Avoidance of incongruity caused by dangling modifiers 

6* Avoidance of ambiguity caused by poor sentence 
arrangement (unclear reference, etc.) 

7* Use of parallel structure in expressing parallel ideas 

8. Effective handling of subordination 

9 . Discrimination in choice of connecting words 

In addition to these elements of sentence structure, 
the following points, concerned with methods of achieving 
desired effects, were tested: 

1* Emphasis achieved by 

(a) repetition 

(b) use of climax 

(c) placing the important elements in emphatic position, 
and of unimportant elements in inconspicuous 
position 

(d) use of full expression in clause or sentence for 
important elements, and less ponderous expression 
(modifiers, appositives, etc.) for less important 
elements 

2. Variety achieved by 

(a) avoidance of tiresome repetition of the same word

(b) varying type of sentence structure 

(c) varying type of modifier 

Adapting the sentence form to the character of the idea 
or the feeling to be expressed 

A section of the test also measured the active or 
working vocabulary* The words used were from the Thorndike 
Word List . and were those frequently used. They differed 
from the vocabulary section in not being of the recognition 
type. The students were to recall a word that fitted a 
definition given. 

The last part of the Effectiveness of Expression test 
represented an attempt to measure the ability to organize 
materials. Among the factors involved in this ability were: 

1. Ability to discriminate between relevant and irrelevant 
material. 

2. Ability to recognize the relative breadth of scope of 
various topics. 

Ability to classify materials under appropriate 
headings. 

4. Ability to arrange materials in an effective order. 

5. Ability to handle transitional material effectively.

CHAPTER III 


ANALYSIS OF TEST RESULTS 

Comparison of Smoky Lake and McLeod School Division Scores 

With U^ S» Norms 

By converting the raw scores on the Cooperative English 
Test into scaled scores, it was possible to make comparisons 
of scores of the two groups of schools used in this investi¬ 
gation with norms based on 90,000 students in 200 schools of 
the Public Secondary School System of the East, Middle West, 
and West United States. The norms as given in the booklet 
were n end-of-year” norms. ^ Since the tests were adminis¬ 
tered to students who had spent only four months in the 
tenth grade, their grade was taken as 10.4. By means of 
interpolation, norms were calculated for a grade of 10.4 
by finding the difference between the norm for end-of-grade 
nine and end-of-grade ten and subtracting six-tenths of this 
difference from the norm for end-of-grade ten. Table I 
shows the comparison of the scores made by the two groups 
of schools with United States norms in the seven types of 
measures for which scaled scores were available. 

The table revealed some significant facts. The scores 
of the students in the McLeod School Division compared

favorably with the norms. The figures showed that the students 
were almost a year ahead on the Reading Comprehension test but 
were seven months behind on the test on Mechanics of Expression. 
On the test of Effectiveness of Expression the scores of stu¬ 
dents were comparable with those of the students used in es¬ 
tablishing the norms. The three tests, collectively, showed 
them to be only one month ahead. In other words, on the three 
tests as a whole the students scored what they should have 





















17 


scored had they spent five months in grade ten. 

On the other hand, students in the Smoky Lake School 
Division, on the average, were from seven months to one and 
one-half years behind those used in establishing the norms. 

On the Heading Comprehension test they were about one year 
behind; on the test on Mechanics of Expression and the Ef¬ 
fectiveness of Expression they were almost one and one-half 
years behind* On the three tests as a whole, they were 
more than one year below the norms for their grade# In 
other words, their scores on the three tests as a whole 
were those of an average student who had spent two months 
in grade nine. 

Comparisons on Parts of Tests 

By examining the parts of the test further, it was 
possible to make comparisons of the average scores made by 
the students in the two groups of schools. Since norms were 
not available for parts of these tests, comparisons were 
made between the two groups of schools on the basis of the 
average number of correct answers. Scaled scores were not 
available for part scores on either of the "Expression Tests". 
Table II gives a comparison of the average number of correct 
responses on each of the parts of the two tests of Mechanics 
of Expression and Effectiveness of Expression.

It was interesting to note that Smoky Lake School Divi¬

students on only one part of the two tests, namely, on gram¬ 
matical usage* The difference was probably not very signifi¬ 
cant* The average scores in spelling in the two groups of 
schools showed only a small difference* Since part scores 
could not have been converted into scaled scores, it was not

possible to determine accurately how significant the differ¬ 
ences really were. However, they did give a rough indica¬ 
tion of the sources of weaknesses or strengths. Probably 
most significant was the great difference in average score 
in Active Vocabulary. McLeod School Division students scored 
almost double the number of words per pupil scored by those 
of the Smoky Lake School Division. 

Summary of Observations on Comparisons 
Between Students in McLeod and Smoky Lake School Divisions 

The two foregoing tables tend to show that students in 
the Smoky Lake School Division were weak in the mechanics 
of reading or in the techniques of reading comprehension 
measured by the test on Heading Comprehension. This probably 
indicated lack of skill in using the necessary techniques 
for understanding the content of reading material of the 
kind presented in the test. Their performance on the test 
of Mechanics of Expression indicated weaknesses in many of 
the factors involved in skill in written expression, in 
spite of the fact that their average score on grammatical 
usage was slightly higher than the average score in McLeod 

School Division. Particularly low scores were revealed on 

/' : 

the test of Effectiveness of Expression. This probably in¬ 
dicated the need of developing greater skill in organizing 
material and presenting it effectively in writing. Greater

CHAPTER IT 


ANALYSIS OF DIFFICULTIES ON THE READING COMPREHENSION TEST 

Vocabulary Section 

The vocabulary section of the Cooperative English Test, 
Single Booklet Edition, included a sampling of words from the 
subject-matter of many fields# The items ranged in difficulty 
from easy words with widely divergent choices to very diffi¬ 
cult ones with the choices separated only very slightly in 
meaning. All of the words were from the Thorndike Word List, 
their distribution by thousands as indicated by the Teacher f s 
Word Book of Twenty Thousand Words 3-4 being shown in Table III. 

From the analysis of errors made, it was found that only 
eight of the sixty words were known by more than fifty per¬ 
cent of the grade ten students in the Smoky Lake School Divi¬ 
sion. It was also quite apparent that items having words 
of widely divergent choices were answered better than items 
having words separated only slightly in meaning. There 
appeared to have been some difficulty in distinguishing 
different shades of meaning of certain words. For example, 
test item number 37 had the word "cite" followed by five

choices: (I) find, (2) prove, (3) dispatch, (4) mention, 
(3) reveal. Only ten students chose the correct response, 
namely mention , whereas the largest number, thirty-five, 
chose find : thirty-two chose reveal : ten disnatch : and 

























23 


eight prove . Fifteen students apparently did not know the 
word at all and therefore omitted the item. On the other 
hand an item having widely divergent choices gave better re¬ 
sults, as for example, rodent which was followed by five 
choices: (l) front tooth, (2) slender bar, (3) roundup, (4) 
small animal, (3) pony. There were seventy-eight students 
who had made the right choice, namely, small animal . Only 
four students gave slender bar : nine roundup : three front 
tooth : and three pony . Thirteen students did not make any 
attempt to answer the question, either because of unfamili¬ 
arity with the word or lack of time. 

It was quite apparent that many of the words were only 
vaguely known by the students. Too often they attempted to 
determine the meaning of the word by association with another 
word similar in sound or appearance. In some cases the 
students tried to determine the meaning of the word by con¬ 
sidering its probable derivation. The investigator noticed 
interesting peculiarities in about twenty-five of the words, 
twelve of them shown in Table IT in order of frequency. 

It should be noted that about ten of the words in the 
test were not those commonly used at the grade ten level. 
However, of the remaining fifty words, the students apparently 
had only a vague and hazy idea of what the words meant and 
relied on apparently meaningful context to deduce the correct 
meaning. This may have been the reason for the great number 


















24 


of confused responses. In some cases the errors could have 
been made as a result of faulty or careless reading habits, 
as for example the confusion of surly and surely, derelict 
and dialect . smug and snug , caucus and cactus . Table IV

illustrates the words which were not entirely unknown to the 
students but that were confused in meaning by sound simi¬ 
larity, appearance, or derivation. 

Heading Section 

The passages within the reading section of the test, 
chosen from a wide variety of sources, included sampling of 
reading materials of various kinds and degrees of diffi¬ 
culty. No selections from poetry are included in the test. 
The items based on the selected passages were classified in 
terms of the outline for the test which has been presented 
on page 11, the resulting classification shown in Table V. 
The majority of the items were of the type in which the 
students were to construe the writer’s meaning from the 
passage, or to draw conclusions from the context. 

Since only two students in the Smoky Lake School 
Division completed scale two (Item 60), the analysis of 
difficulties has been confined to the items in scale one, 
namely the first thirty items on the reading test. Twenty- 
seven. students of the 110 did not attempt any items above 
number 30 in the reading section. By contrast, in the 
McLeod School Division, only eleven students did not attempt 
items beyond number 30. In the McLeod School Division, 
there were seventeen students who completed sixty items and 
three who attempted all ninety items on the reading test.

In the Smoky Lake School Division the students were unable 
to read rapidly enough to attempt, in the limited time 
provided, all of the items in the first scale which were 
within their range of comprehension. 

Although it was rather difficult to analyze errors in 
reading, it was possible to make a few significant observa¬ 
tions on this phase of the test* The students in the Smoky 
Lake School Division were about a year below the norms in 
their speed of comprehension and more than half a year below

the norms in their level of comprehension as rated by the 
Cooperative English Test, They apparently lacked skill in 
using the necessary techniques for understanding the content 
of reading materials of the kind presented in the test and 
were unable to read as rapidly as was usual for their grade. 

From the analysis, it seemed probable that items of the 
type A and B, namely, determining the meanings of words from 
contexual clues, and organizing meanings presented less dif¬ 
ficulty than those of type C and D, namely, construing the 
writer's meaning and drawing conclusions from the content. 

It seemed that students had the greatest difficulty when 
they were required to answer questions by drawing a conclu¬ 
sion from the content of a reading passage. 

It was considered desirable to find out whether the 
students whose scores on the Reading Comprehension test were 
low were deficient in mental ability, in background experi¬ 
ence, in the mechanics of reading, or in the techniques of 
reading comprehension measured by this test. After the 
tests had been scored, all of the students who marked no 
items, numbered J>Q or above on the reading section were given 
sufficient time to attempt as many additional items as they 
could. Their level of comprehension scores were then re¬ 
computed. It was found that of the twenty-seven students 
only four did not significantly increase their level of com¬ 
prehension score. The rest of the students increased their

level of comprehension scores by an average of three to five 
points. This meant that their level of comprehension was 
increased by almost one grade. This comparison of the two 
"level of comprehension 11 scores for each pupil provided a 
rough approximation of the extent to which the pupils were 
handicapped by faulty mechanics of reading, if we recognize 
that there is some correlation between speed and level of 
comprehension as indicated by the authors of the test. 
Otherwise there might be evidence that other factors than 
faulty mechanics of reading contributed to the low scores 
on level of comprehension.

CHAPTER V 


ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF THE TEST OF 
MECHANICS OF EXPRESSION 

Grammatical Usa&e 

The test of Mechanics of Expression covered a compre¬ 
hensive list of grammatical points which represent accepted 
usage for serious and relatively formal, though not neces¬ 
sarily ,, literary ,t , writing, rather than colloquial usage. 
There were no so-called "errors” in written English which 
are considered by most linguistic scholars to be good 
modern usage. Although scores made by the students of the 
Smoky Lake School Division were somewhat higher than those 
of the students in the McLeod School Division, there were, 
nevertheless, several significant points which are worth 
considering. 

The Use of the Double Negative 

Mr. D. M. Sullivan and Mr. G. H. Robinson drew atten¬ 
tion in their theses to the extensive use of the double 
negative among students of Ukrainian ancestry. It was 
interesting to note that of the five items dealing with the 
use of the double negative all were particularly well done. 
In only one situation was there some doubt in the students’ 
minds. In the sentence, "The sky was a deep sapphire blue 
without scarcely a cloud to hide the twinkling stars", only

seventy students recognized the error. Thirty-two students 
did not recognize the error and assumed that there was 
nothing wrong with the sentence as given. It would appear 
that the use of the double negative which has been so pre¬ 
valent among students of Ukrainian origin has begun to dis¬ 
appear* The students have probably learned to think in 
English rather than to compose their thoughts in Ukrainian 
and then make a more or less literal translation into English. 

Difficulty with Words of Similar Sound 

There seemed to have been some difficulty with homonyms. 
Students had trouble locating the error in sentences using 
the following words: 

principal and principle, 
capital and capital . 

and already . 
affect and effect . 
accept and except 
their and there . 
quite and quiet . 

When a sentence involved the use of these words, less than 
a third of the students recognized the error; the majority 
either said that there was no error in the sentence or marked 
another part of the sentence as incorrect. 

Difficulty with “had of n and "would of ” 

A fairly large number of students were not able to see

any error in sentences which, made use of had of and would of 
instead of the correct form. Twenty-five students accepted 
as correct "they would of laughed at us” as compared to 
seventy-one who recognized the error. In the sentence, "you 
would of sworn she was a dancer", sixty-nine were able to 
see the error, while twenty-nine assumed it was correct 
usage. The use of had of probably presented less diffi¬ 
culty. In the phrase "if they had of started earlier", 
ninety-nine saw the error as compared to eleven who were 
unable to recognize any error. 

Difficulty with "who", "whom", "which " 

The correct use of which f who , and whom, presented 
some difficulty among the students. The six items dealing 
with their incorrect usage were: 

(1) We heard someone approaching our camp, but could not 
tell whom it was until the visitor reached the edge of the 
clearing. 

(2) According to the stories of the old West, it was the cus¬ 
tom never to ask a newcomer whom he was or where he came from. 
O) Shortly after his arrival, he telephoned to Mr. Fields, 

who he had known when he was in college. 

/ 

(4) During his term as President, thousands of appeals for 
pardon were received by Lincoln from soldiers which had got

(j?) A copy of the Students 1 Handbook was gi¥en to each of 
the new students, most of who were freshmen. 

(6) He is more likely to give the responsibility to someone 
who he is sure he can trust. 

The grade ten students in the Smoky Lake Division were equally 
divided on sentence four* Fifty percent marked which as being 
wrong usage and about an equal number marked it as correct 
usage* In the remaining sentences approximately thirty per¬ 
cent were not able to see any wrong usage in the sentences. 

Difficulty with ¥erb Tenses 

Correct tenses of verbs seemed to present some diffi¬ 
culty, especially in the longer sentences. It was also noted 
that in the longer sentences there was often the difficulty 
of choosing the verb to agree with the subject, especially 
when there were intervening phrases or clauses between the 
subject and the verb. In the sentence "Mr. Johnson and his 
two sons were obviously enjoying the circus; in fact it was 
hard to tell whether Tommy, his brother Dick, or their father 
were having the most fun," it was observed that only thirty- 
seven students recognized the error as lack of agreement be¬ 
tween the subject and the verb.

Miscellaneous Difficulties 

There were a few other errors which, though not too 
significant, are worth mentioning. ALmost fifty percent of

the students failed to see the error in "Neither renters or 
buyers could be found”* Another error which many failed to 
note was the use of these kind . In the sentence, ”It is 
very difficult to carry out the work efficiently under these 
kind of conditions”, only fifty-eight students recognized 
the error in the sentence* Some difficulty was observed in 
the correct use of adverbs, as for example, ”A less consci¬ 
entious man would have acted different ”. ’’Several million 
acres of private-owned forest land” and ”He told me not to 
take things too serious ”* 

Punctuation 

The punctuation section of the test consisted of a 
number of passages without any punctuation marks. There 
was a number, below the text, at each place where some 
punctuation was probably required* The students were to 
decide what punctuation, if any, was needed there. The 
punctuation section tested the correct use of the comma, 
apostrophe, semi-colon, period, colon, and quotation marks. 

Difficulty with the Apostrophe 

By observing the frequency of certain errors, it 
appeared that the use of the apostrophe to denote the pos¬ 
sessive case and as used for words in the contracted form 
presented the most difficulty. In the part of the sentence

11 its hull pierced below the water line” only thirty-six 
students said that no punctuation was required; fifty-six 
placed an apostrophe before the "s", and eighteen placed 
an apostrophe after the “s”. In "the merchant shins engine 
room", nineteen said no punctuation was required; fifty-five 
placed an apostrophe before the “s’ 1 , and thirty-five after 
the "s". In "General Francos forces," twenty-six said no 
punctuation was required; fifty-four put an apostrophe be¬ 
fore the "s", and thirty after the "&"• In the sentence 
beginning with " Its not the difficulty of carrying out the 
project", twelve students said no punctuation was required; 
eighty-nine noted that it was a contracted form of it is 
and put an apostrophe in place of the omitted letter, while 
seven put an apostrophe after the "s". Using the apostrophe 
to denote plural possession as in "my friends almost unani¬ 
mous disapproval" was done correctly by only twenty-six 
students; fifty-one said no punctuation was necessary and 
thirty placed the apostrophe as for a singular possessive, 
namely before the "s" rather than after the "s". In the 
sentence, "The fact remains that the books a best seller 
today", only forty-eight students realized that the word is 
a contraction and placed the apostrophe before the "s". 
Forty-one said no punctuation was necessary and twenty-one 
put an apostrophe after the "s".

Capitalization 

In this part of the test four short passages were given. 
The students were to study each word that had a number 
printed under it and decide whether the word should be capi¬ 
talized or not. The most frequent error was the failure to 
capitalize a word when it appeared as part of a name. 

Examples are: 

St. Patrick’s Day 
the Yankee Clipper 
La Guardia Held 
Old Uncle Billy 
American Civil War 
General Grant 
Union Leader 

A fairly large number of students capitalized the word 
doctor in "two British doctors 11 . 

Spelling 

The spelling part of the test consisted of sixty items 
with the word in each item spelled in two ways. The students 

were to choose the correct spelling in each pair. In three 

/ 

of the items both words were incorrectly spelled. In these 
three items less than twenty-five per cent of the grade ten 
students in the Smoky Lake Division recognized these cases. 
For example, fifty-four students indicated commitse and

twenty-eight indicated comittee was the correct spelling. 
Only twenty-eight students recognized that neither was the 
correct spelling. The other groups where both words were 
incorrectly spelled were welfair and we11fare and proffessor 
and professer . 

Other words where gross errors were exhibited by the 
students in distinguishing the correct spelling were:

It appeared that some of the words were not recognized 
as incorrectly spelled because of careless pronunciation in 
tbe student’s oral work. Evidence of this was seen in words 
like temperture . voluntary, distroy f canidate . abundance . 
suffacate , and convience . There was also some evidence of 
difficulty in deciding whether a letter was to be retained 
or not when another word has been formed from it by the 
addition of ing f lv f able . etc. lor example, a large number 
of students gave comeing . truelv . adviseable , usualv . as 
correctly spelled. There was also some evidence of diffi¬ 
culty with other instances of double letters and letters not 
doubled as in career , carreer , difficult y dificult . aparent . 
apparent . ommission . omission , possession , posession . and 
prefered . preferred .

CHAPTER VI 


ANALYSIS OP RESULTS OE THE TEST OE 
EFFECTIVENESS OE EXPRESSION 

Sentence Structure and Style 

The first part of this test consisted of two passages 
of prose* Two different versions of each passage were given 
in adjacent columns, and the students were asked to decide 
which version of each sentence, or other indicated portion 
of the passage, was more effectively expressed* In addition, 
there were items in which the students decided which one of 
several general statements best represented the basis for 
their choice of the more effective version* These items on 
the reasons for choices tested the students* awareness of 
the principles involved in effective expression and their 
application to specific situations* These items also tested 
the students 1 ability to recognize various devices which were 
useful in securing desired effects. In the last section of 
this test, four different sentences on the same subject were 
given; the students were to select the one which was the most 
effectively expressed. 

The analysis of the results of the test showed that the 
students did not have very much difficulty in deciding which 
version of each sentence or portion of a passage was more 
effectively expressed. In fact, the ratio of correct to

incorrect responses on each item was approximately nine to 
two, and in many cases even higher. However, the students 
performed very poorly in determining the reasons for their 
choices. In one case only eleven students recognized the 
reason a section was inferior was that it was not a complete 
sentence. In another case only twenty-seven students gave 
the reason as “two sentences are punctuated as if they were 
a single sentence." Many students had difficulty in recog¬ 
nizing sentences or parts of a passage which were inferior 
because of dangling participles, monotonous repetition of 
structure, obscure meaning because of poor word order, and 
independent clauses separated only by commas. In general, 
students had little difficulty in recognizing sentences 
which are expressed effectively, but had more difficulty 
in determining the reason why one sentence or one part of 
a passage is inferior and another superior. 

Active Vocabulary 

This part of the test attempted to measure the extent 
of the students’ active or working vocabulary, ^ach of the 
sentences in the items described a certain word. A number 
in parentheses indicated the number of letters there were 
in the word. The students were to think of the exact word 
which best fitted the description and to find its first 
letter among the choices given following the sentence. The

words used were from the Thorndike Word List and such that 
were not only frequently used but also descriptive enough 
to be readily recognized. 

The scores of students in the Sinoky Lake School Divi¬ 
sion were very low as compared with the scores of students 
in the McLeod School Division. The average number of cor¬ 
rect responses in McLeod School Division was thirteen words 
per student. In Smoky Lake School Division the average was 
only seven words per student. Five words were known by more 
than fifty percent of the grade ten students. However, 
thirteen of the words were known by less than twenty percent, 
and of these thirteen words four were known by less than 
seven percent of the students. The four words which ap¬ 
parently were not known by the students were fluctuate . 
fatalist . repertoire , and arbitration . The five words 
which were well known were damp, signature , pioneer, chime , 
and massacre . 

Organization 

The last part of the test of Effectiveness of Expres¬ 
sion purports to measure the students r ability to organize 
materials. Two types of items were used. In the first, 
various thought elements were presented in random order, 
and the students were asked to arrange the elements in the 
best order to form a well-organized and effectively expressed

paragraph* A variant of this type presented statements 
representing whole paragraphs of a theme; the students were 
to decide what order of the paragraphs gave the best orga¬ 
nization for the theme. 

itirther elements in organization were measured in an 
outlining test, in which the students organized various 
topics and answered questions which were designed to test 
how well they had classified and organized the different 
topics. 

There appeared to be least difficulty in deciding 
which sentence should come first in order to form a well- 
organized paragraph. Usually it was the topic sentence; 
this was probably the reason why most students were cpite 
successful in finding its proper place. However the proper 
order for the remaining sentences gave considerably more dif¬ 
ficulty* One sentence, in particular, was placed correctly 
by only twelve students. In some cases it was found that a 
sentence placed in a wrong order did not materially change 
the thought of the paragraph. However it did to a large 
extent condition the effectiveness of the passage. It was 
in cases of this type that students were least successful in 
getting the correct order of these sentences. Apparently 
they were concerned with a sentence order that merely con¬ 
veyed the meaning intended without much attention to whether 
a different order would create a more effective result.

In the outlining test, there was the apparent difficulty 
of discriminating between relevant and irrelevant materials* 
In completing the outline many students inserted items which 
had little or no bearing on the topic* For example, under 
the topic "General Responsibilities of the Forest Rangers", 
one of the headings was "Conservation of natural resources” 
with two sub-headings given: (1) Fire prevention, (2) Fire 
fighting. The third was to be chosen from a suggested list* 
Only twenty-five students chose the correct sub-heading 
"Combating erosion"* The remainder of the students chose 
as sub-headings the following; (a) Repairing telephone 
lines (b) Roads and trails (c) Yalue of public property, 
and (d) Greater danger of forest fires in the fall* 

There was also some indication of difficulty in recog¬ 
nizing the relative breadth of various topics. For example, 
under the heading "Building of new improvements" only a few 
students recognized the scope of this heading. Two sub¬ 
headings were given, namely, "Lookout towers" and "Cabins 
and ranger stations". Many students indicated as a third 
sub-heading "Assistance to people in difficulty", "Extent of 
area controlled", "Management of forest lands", and "Enforce¬ 
ment of game laws"* Only thirteen students indicated the 
correct choice: "Roads and trails". It was obvious that the 
students failed to grasp the scope of a sub-heading or its 
relationship to the heading and the topic. 













CHAPTER VII 


CLASSIFICATION IN TERMS OF ACHIEVEMENT OF GRADE TEN 
STUDENTS IN THE SMOKY LAKE SCHOOL DIVISION 

Although it was observed that the average scaled 
scores of the students in the Smoky Lake School Division 
were below the test norms and below those of the students 
in the McLeod School Division, it was considered desirable 
to determine the distribution by grade level of the students 
according to their achievement in each of the seven types 
of measures for which scaled scores were available. From 
the booklet of norms, shown in the appendix, the range of 
scaled scores corresponding to the various grade levels was 
obtained. The tables in this chapter give the distribution 
of 110 grade ten students in the six schools of the Smoky 
Lake School Division according to grade level of achieve¬ 
ment in vocabulary, speed of comprehension, level of com¬ 
prehension, total reading comprehension, mechanics of 
expression, effectiveness of expression, and total English. 
Although the tables are self-explanatory, a short summary 
follows each table.

Summary of Observations 

In some types of measures, as many as eighty per cent 
of the grade ten students in the Smoky Lake School Division 
were below the norms of the Cooperative English Tests* Many 
were found to be at the grade seven level of achievement in 
certain phases of English* On the other hand, twenty per 
cent of the students scored as well as, or better than the 
grade ten students used in establishing the norms. It can 
be said that from sixty to eighty per cent of the grade ten 
students in the Smoky Lake School Division had an English 
achievement which was below the norms for their grade as 
rated by the Cooperative English Test.

CHAPTER VIII 


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

Grade ten students in the Smoky Lake School Division 
were found to be on the average from one-half to one and 
one-half years below the norms in achievement in various 
phases of English as rated by the Cooperative English 
Test* Prom sixty to eighty per cent of the students 
achieved scores which were below the norms for their 
grade and below the scores of the McLeod School Division 
students used as a comparison group. 

Vocabulary and Reading 

One-quarter of the grade ten students in the Smoky 
Lake Division displayed gross errors in the mechanics of 
reading. They were unable to read rapidly enough to at¬ 
tempt , in the time limit, all of the items in the first 
scale which were within their range of comprehension. 

When they were given sufficient time to attempt as many 
additional items as they could, their level of comprehen¬ 
sion scores showed a significant increase. Much could be 
done for these students, who displayed obvious errors in the 
mechanics of reading, by providing the opportunity for super¬ 
vised oral reading of easy materials and by preparing simple

analysis* Stearn gives these worthwhile suggestions: 

1* Start pupil reading something . Be sure it is 
not too difficult, but be even more sure it is 
interesting to him* 

2. Encourage him to read better and better boohs, 
not by telling him they are better, but by sug¬ 
gesting them as interesting reading. Be sure 
they are interesting. Avoid the adult classics 
like the plague at this stage and concentrate 
on good, fairly light modern stuff instead. 

3* Give him plenty of practice with well-organized 
remedial material. He can really improve if 
given a chance. 

4. Keep him well informed of his progress, both in 
relation to his own past performance and to the 
perfomanee of the class and the groups. 

3» Don’t ask him for "book reports". Let him spend 
the time in reading instead. 

Good reading habits are essential for progress in any 
subject in school. Since it was apparent that the diffi¬ 
culties discovered among the grade ten students have been 
carried forward from the lower grades, the solution to the 
problem must of necessity be an attack throughout the grades. 

The teaching of English is first of all a res¬ 
ponsibility of the entire school staff. Eor sub¬ 
stantial results in the field of language learning, 
therefore, a determined and persistent school-wide 
attack upon the problems of reading, writing, 
speaking, and listening is necessary. 

/ 

All teachers in the secondary school have a 
responsibility for the improvement of language

expression on the part of youth. Provision for an 
abundance of such activities as letter writing, 
floor talks, panels, group discussions, conversa¬ 
tions, and similar forms of speaking and writing 
should be made in all subject matter fields.16 

Students should be encouraged to do more reading at 
their own level. Por those who have not developed a real 
taste for reading, good magazines could be used to advan¬ 
tage. Certain magazines show a universal appeal to young 
people regardless of age, sex, or intelligence. 1‘hese 
include McLeans, Reader's Digest . Saturday Evening Post , 
and Colliers . 

Many teachers have reported classroom experiences 
with magazines which have resulted in improved reading 
tastes and extended reading interests on the part of 
high school youth. It seems clear that the reading 
tastes of American people could be materially altered 
for the better, particularly in the field of maga¬ 
zines, if all schools were to provide youth with the 
opportunity to become acquainted with the many good 
materials available.17 

Although students must read at least ten books a year 
from a prescribed list, they should be encouraged to read 
many more. Students in the Smoky Lake School Division, some 
of whom were found to be reading at the grade eight level, 
should read twenty or more good books in a year. They should 
select books of different types and by different authors. In 
other school subjects, where all of the students possess the

same textbook, various sections could, be assigned as reading 
selections, subject to time limits and progress checks. In 
this way, the responsibility for reading improvement could 
be distributed amongst all teachers. 

It is necessary for students to increase their speed 

of comprehension. It has been customary to urge speed even 

at the cost of temporary loss of comprehension. 

Keep forcing yourself to read rapidly. At first 
your comprehension of ideas will be interfered with. 

But with persistent daily practice you can soon n 
learn to grasp ideas with remarkable quickness.- 1 * 0 

However more recent findings in investigations of reading 
disabilities show other things than speed per se to be 
important, and therefore it would probably not be justi¬ 
fiable to place as much emphasis on speed alone since dif¬ 
ferent kinds of reading for different purposes are recognized. 

There is evidence of a need for systematic vocabulary 
development. It appears that many of the students have a 
fairly large vocabulary but are not always sure of the 
exact meaning or the right choice of words. Many devices 
such as word games, good crossword puzzles, and word com¬ 
petitions could be used to stimulate vocabulary development. 
The dictionary is indispensable in learning the correct 
meanings of words encountered in reading. However, unless

words are filled with the content of personal experience, 
they are likely to remain empty symbols in the mind of the 
learner and hence be misused or readily forgotten. 

Power to get meaning from the printed page begins 
with word recognition. In the elementary and junior 
high school, teachers should arouse an interest in 
words, their multiple meanings and their varied forms. 
They should help pupils develop a method of attacking 
unfamiliar words through the many techniques of word 
analysis, pursuit of context clues, and use of the 
dictionary. This requires ingenuity in devising 
activities that both interest and challenge children 
and young people. Emphasis upon first hand experi¬ 
ences as a basis for giving meaning to words is es¬ 
pecially important. 3*9 

The danger of teaching vocabulary without reference to 
the content of experience Is great when new words are Intro¬ 
duced in list form for learning through memorization of 
spelling and meanings without reference to context or need. 
Growth in vocabulary should be a by-product of new experi¬ 
ences demanding the use of new words for describing, identi¬ 
fying, or communicating. From this background of experience, 
words whose pronunciation, meaning, or spelling causes dif¬ 
ficulty may be lifted for special consideration as separate 
items, but the procedure in such cases is always from the 
whole to the part.

Mechanics of Expression 


Although grade ten students in the smoky Lake School 
Division scored higher than the grade ten students of the 
McLeod School Division on grammatical usage, they were below 
the norms on the Mechanics of Expression test as a whole. 
Seventy-five per cent were below their grade level in this 
phase of English* This would seem to indicate that more 
time needs to be devoted to correct usage in everyday 
language. There is the apparent need of consistent empha¬ 
sis on homonyms, correct use of who, which, whom, correct 
verb tenses, and the use of the apostrophe for denoting 
possession or in contraction. In order to fix a particu¬ 
lar usage it would be well to rely for practice more on 
the composition of short illustrative sentences from the 
students 7 own writing or speech. 

There is probably no better way to waste time 
than to ask students to change sentences which 
they themselves would never think of writing or 
saying. Unless the students recognize the language 
of the practice exercises as their own, the carry¬ 
over of the work into their personal, independent 
use of language is destined to be small because of 20 
their failure to see any connection between the two. 

The use of the double negative, so prevalent among 
students of Ukrainian origin, has diminished considerably. 

It Is apparent that students of Ukrainian origin are

beginning to think in English rather than to compose in 
Ukrainian and to translate into English. 

Spelling, which is associated with good writing, ap¬ 
pears to require some attention. Correct pronunciation 
would do much toward eliminating many spelling errors. 

Grade ten students in the Smoky Lake School Division failed 
to note many misspelled words because of careless pronunci¬ 
ation. Proficiency in pronunciation is a habit, rather than 
a subject matter, and as such cannot be achieved as a unit 
boxed off for intensive study and thorough coverage in a few 
weeks devoted exclusively to the topic. The alternative is 
to make improvement in pronunciation a Continuous responsi¬ 
bility in all classes and an integral aspect of all oral work. 

Students should be trained to re-read their written work 
and find their own errors in usage. After they have prepared 
an assignment, they could be asked to go over the work and 
locate errors according to a chart arranged beforehand by the 
teacher. The chart should consist of specific instruction for 
guidance. Models of correct form, for imitation by the 
pupils, will provide quicker and more lasting improvement than 
a large number of rules, which may or may not have much 
meaning for the pupil. In this way the teacher could be 
spared a great deal of time correcting errors which students

themselves are aware of but make because of carelessness. 

Effectiveness of Expression 

Seventy-four per cent of the grade ten students in the 
Smoky Lake School Division scored below their grade norms 
in effectiveness of expression. This would seem to indicate 
the need of developing greater skill in organizing material 
and presenting it effectively in writing. Students should 
receive constant practice in the use of parallel construc¬ 
tion to express parallel ideas. There is evidence of need 
for writing sentences of different types such as periodic, 
balanced, and complex. The ability to handle sentences 
well results from a gradual maturing of ability to think, 
to oj^ganize ideas, and to express ideas. The attack of the 
school strategically follows the natural stages of language 
development: (l) the clear thinking and expressing of single 
ideas, (2) the thinking and expressing of several ideas, and 
(j>) the giving of emphasis to expression and adding interest 
through the use of a variety of sentences. There is an 
urgent need among the students for abundant practice on all 
types of sentences, especially the longer sentence, to avoid 
unjustified partial sentences, strung-out sentences, and 
poor sentence arrangement in their writing. However, the 
goal should be to incorporate these types of sentences into 
their written and spoken English.

Students should be careful to avoid more or less literal 
translations from foreign languages which sound crude or 
incorrect in English, Double negatives seem logical to 
Ukrainian speaking students because they use them, and cor¬ 
rectly so, in their own language. It is quite common and 
proper to use sentences with four or five double negatives 
in the Ukrainian language. When translated, these sentences 
would be incorrect and very crude in English. Fortunately 
the use of the double negative in English among Ukrainian 
students is disappearing. 

The following should receive particular attention: 
avoidance of tiresome repetition of the same word, varying 
type of sentence structure, varying type of modifiers, choice 
of connecting words, and adapting the sentence form to the 
character of the idea or feeling to be expressed. 

Above all, there is a need for a desire to improve. 
Practice on difficulties is one thing. Using effective 
expression in written and spoken English can come about 
only by habitual use and a willingness to raise the stan¬ 
dard of effective English in everyday practice. In conclu¬ 
sion, it is well to keep in mind that growth in language is 
not like building a wall by adding a stone here and another 
there. It is far more like growing a tree by letting it 
live in the rain, the sunshine, and the wind.

Directions: This part consists of selections taken from stories, articles, humorous anecdotes, textbooks, etc. Foil 
ing each passage are several multiple-choice items concerning the selection. In each case you are to read the selec 
carefully first, and then decide on the basis of the selection which one of the choices given after each incomplete st 
ment best completes the meaning of the statement. If you cannot decide, you may go back to the passage. Put 
number of your choice in the parentheses at the right of each item. Since this test measures Speed of Comprehen 
as well as Level of Comprehension, enough material has been included so that even the most rapid readers prob; 
will not finish in the time allowed.

Slight knocking or pinging in an engine is not, as 
vertising implies, evidence of an unsuitable fuel, 
ien an engine is knocking, actually the maximum 
i sepower is being produced. Only when such knock- 
is considerable, under severe and exceptional circum- 
tces, will there be any danger of harm to the engine, 
is advisable to select the type of fuel best suited for 
r car, have the proper spark adjustment made, and 
her continue to use the fuel exclusively, or (if for some 
^on its quality declines) another suitable fuel of ap- 
kimately the same octane number. Actually, there 
ttle difference in the resultant power and gasoline 
ige obtained by different fuels with different anti- 

E k qualities, providing the proper spark adjustment 
ide in each case, and any improvement in perform- 
will not be sufficient to compensate for the difference 
□st between the better nonleaded fuels and the 
Lium leaded fuels. Assuming proper carburetor and 
k adjustment, choice of brand or type of gasoline has 
‘.tically no effect upon mileage per gallon.

I went out to Charing Cross to see Major-General 
Harrison hanged, drawn, and quartered; which was done 
there, he looking as cheerful as any man could do in that 
condition. Thus it was my chance to see the King be¬ 
headed at Whitehall and to see the first blood shed in 
revenge for the blood of the King at Charing Cross. 
After that I went home where I was angry with my wife 
for her things lying about, and in my passion kicked the 
little fine basket, which I bought her in Holland, and 
broke it, which troubled me after I had done it.

I was traveling across Siberia in the coldest part of 
winter when the coach I was riding in encountered 
another in a narrow pass. I bid the coachman give a 
signal with his horn. He blew with all his might but 
could not make the horn sound. 

That evening as we sat before the fire at an inn we 
heard a horn sounding behind us. We looked around 
and now found the reason why the coachman had not 
been able to sound his horn; the tunes were frozen up in 
the horn and came out now by thawing, plain enough, 
and much to the credit of the driver. So the honest 
fellow entertained us for some time with a variety of 
tunes without putting his mouth to the horn.

statement that

horn because it was affected by the

Truth, indeed, is something that is believed in com¬ 
pletely only by persons who have never tried personally 
to pursue it to its fastnesses and grab it by the tail. 
Teachers believe wholeheartedly in unchangeable truths 
and spend their lives trying to determine them and spread 
them; the so-called intellectual progress of man consists 
largely of a concerted effort to block and destroy their 
enterprise. In whole departments of human inquiry it 
seems to me quite unlikely that the truth ever will be 
discovered. Nevertheless, the rubber-stamp thinking of 
the world always makes the assumption that the exposure 
of an error is identical with the discovery of the truth— 
that error and truth are simple opposites. They are 
nothing of the sort. The average man of today does not 
believe in precisely the same imbecilities that the Greek 
of the ancient world believed in, but the things that he 
does believe in are often quite as idiotic. In other words, 
he doesn’t make the same mistakes as the ancient Greeks 
but he makes others just as stupid.

Romanticism, then, although it has its epochs, is in its 
essential characteristics rather a spirit that shows itself 
at all times, in various degrees, in individual workmen 
and their work, than the peculiarity of a time or a school. 
Depending on the varying proportion of curiosity and the 
desire for beauty—natural tendencies of the artistic spirit 
at all times—it must always be partly a matter of indi¬ 
vidual temperament. The eighteenth century in Eng¬ 
land has been regarded as almost exclusively a classical 
period; yet John Carroll, a type of so much that breaks 
through what are conventionally thought to be the 
influences of that century, is still a noticeable pheno¬ 
menon in it, and the reaction in favor of naturalism in 
poetry begins early in that century.

I said that I preferred a safe horse to a fast one, a horse 
with no spirit whatever, a lame one, if he had such a 
thing. Inside of five minutes I was mounted and per¬ 
fectly satisfied with my outfit. I had no time to label 
him “This is a horse” and so if the bystanders took him 
for a sheep I cannot help it. I could see that he had as 
many fine points as any man’s horse and so I hung my 
hat on one of them behind the saddle. He went along 
peaceably enough but seemed absorbed in meditation. I 
said to myself, “This creature is planning some deviltry. 
No horse ever thought over a subject so profoundly as 
this one is doing just for nothing.” The more this 
preyed on my mind, the more uneasy I became, until the 
suspense became unbearable and I dismounted to see if 
there was anything wild in his eye, for I had heard that a 
horse’s eye is very expressive. I cannot describe what a 
load of anxiety was lifted from my mind when I found 
that he was only asleep.

(1) The fundamental theory of the transmutatio 

(2) metals is to be found in the writings of the Gi 

(3) alchemists, although in details it was modified 

(4) elaborated by the Arabs and the Latin alchern: 

(5) Regarding all substances as being composed of 

(6) primitive matter—the “prima materia”—anc 

(7) owing their specific differences to the presenc 

(8) different qualities imposed upon it, the alchei 

(9) hoped, by taking away these qualities, to ob 

(10) the “prima materia” itself, and then to get f 

(11) it the particular substance he desired, usually si 

(12) or gold, by the addition of the appropriate qi 

(13) ties. The “prima materia” was early ident: 

(14) with mercury, not ordinary mercury, but 

(15) “mercury of the philosophers,” which was 

(16) essence or soul of mercury freed from the 

(17) Aristotelian elements—earth, air, fire, and wat 

(18) or rather from the qualities that they repres 

(19) Thus the experimenter had to remove from c 

(20) nary mercury earth or an earthy principle, 

(21) water or a liquid principle, and to fix it by ta 

(22) away air or a volatile principle. The “p 

(23) materia” thus obtained had to be treated 

(24) sulfur or with sulfur and arsenic to confer up< 

(25) the desired qualities that were missing. This 

(26) fur again was not ordinary sulfur, but some pr 

(27) pie derived from it, which constituted the phi

(31) which persisted in one form or another dow

The theory of surplus value is as follows: the value of 
any commodity (not to be confused with its price, which 
may or may not coincide with its value) is determined by 
the amount of socially necessary labor required to pro¬ 
duce it, and this labor is measured by its duration. For 
a commodity to be transformed into another of greater 
value, there must be brought into action a unique kind 
of commodity, human labor power. This is paid for at 
its value (that is, the amount needed throughout the 
whole of society to enable workers to live, work, and 
reproduce their kind). Let us assume that the value of 
a worker’s labor power is represented by four hours of 
labor. In four hours, therefore, he creates enough value 
to repay his wages. But he has contracted to work for 
eight hours. He therefore creates in the four remaining 
hours additional value. That additional value, known as 
surplus value, is appropriated by the owner of the means 
of production. 

51. The writer definitely states that there is a 

distinction between 

51-1 the cost of a commodity and its price. 

51-2 labor power and the value of a com¬ 
modity.

labor power.

price.

Mrs. Patrick Campbell was seated at dinner one 
fening next to an amateur naturalist who was telling 
| great length about the remarkable organization of ant 
mmunities. “They have teams and working units 
^ th subdivisions of labor,” he went on. “An ant com- 
linity even has an army!” 

“No navy, I suppose?” said Mrs. Campbell. 

. Mrs. Campbell’s remark indicates that she 

50-1 was curious about ants. 

50-2 was tired of hearing about ants, 
ij 50-3 doubted the stories about ants. 

' ! 50-4 was trying to be politely interested 

in ants. 

50-5 wanted to see how much the natu¬ 
ralist really knew about ants. . . . 50( ) 


52. Surplus value is never created if 

52-1 the value of a worker’s labor power 
is less than the value he creates in 
four hours of work. 

52-2 the value of the worker’s labor power 
is the same as the value of the goods 
he produces. 

52-3 the value of the goods the worker 
produces is greater than the value of 
his labor power. 

52-4 the means of production are owned 
by the workers. 

52- 5 machines are used in place of human 

labor power.52( ) 

53. To clarify his explanation, the writer makes 
use chiefly of 

53- 1 overstatement. 

53-2 illustration. 

53-3 analogy. 

53-4 figures of speech. 

53- 5 imagery.53 ( ) 

54. The writer’s principal contention is that 

54- 1 surplus value created by the workers 

should be returned to them in wages. 

54-2 workers should always produce more 
value than they receive in wages. 

54-3 human labor power is unique. 

54-4 socially necessary labor is measured 
in terms of its duration. 

54-5 surplus value is created by workers. 54( )

As happy an instance of futile classicism as can 
well be found, outside of the Far East, is the 
conventional spelling of the English language. A 
breach of the proprieties in spelling is extremely 
annoying and will discredit any writer in the eyes 
of all persons who are possessed of a developed 
sense of the true and beautiful. English spelling 
satisfies all the requirements of reputability under 
the law of conspicuous waste. It is archaic, cum¬ 
brous, and ineffective; its acquisition consumes 
much time and effort; failure to acquire it is easy 
of detection. Therefore it is the first and readiest 
test of reputability in learning, and conformity to 
its ritual is indispensable to a blameless scholastic 
life. 

Which one of the following words, if sub¬ 
stituted for “happy” in line 1, would 
convey most nearly the same meaning?

(4) however faulty or defective, it will at least mani- 

(5) fest how eager I have been to make concessions 

(6) intended to avert those storms that seem ready 

(7) to burst on my country. I am not surprised that 

(8) men who hate liberty should detest those who 

(9) prize it, or that those who want virtue themselves 

(10) should persecute those who possess it. The whole 

(11) of your political conduct has been one continued 

(12) series of weakness and servility. But I must 

(13) allow you one merit, a strict attention to your own 

(14) interests; in that view, who can wonder at your 

(15) disapproval of any measure that must deprive you 

(16) of your places and reduce you to that insignificance

MECHANICS OF EXPRESSION 
PART I: GRAMMATICAL USAGE 

(15 minutes) 

Directions: Read each sentence and decide whether there is an error in usage in any of the underlined parts of the 
sentence. If so, note the number printed under the wrong word or phrase, and put this number in the parentheses at 
he right. If there is no usage error in the sentence, put a zero (0) in the parentheses. 

'To sentence has more than one error, and some sentences do not have any errors. The sentences are to be judged 
in the basis of suitable usage for general written English. 

Samples: 

8. He says that he ain’t coming home with us today... 8(2)

n this sentence, ain’t is wrong. The number printed below this word, 2, is therefore written in the parentheses. 

9. She isn’t ready to go home.9( 0 )

n this sentence, there is no error in any of the underlined words. A zero is therefore written in the parentheses.

PART II 

PUNCTUATION AND CAPITALIZATION 

(15 minutes) 

Directions : In the passages below, at each place where there is a number below the line of text, decide what punctuatior 
if any, is needed there. At the right of that line, in the group numbered to correspond to the place in the text, locat 
the punctuation you consider correct for that place. (“N” means “no punctuation.”) Write the number of the correc 
choice in the parentheses at the right, as in the sample. 


Sample:

8-2 

8-3 


9-1 

9-2 

9-3 


N 


- 8 ( 1 ) 


. 1 — 9 ( 2 ) 

In the sample, at the place in the sentence marked 8, no 
punctuation is required. “N,” meaning “no punctua¬ 
tion,” is choice 1, so you would write 1 in the parentheses, 
as shown above. At the place marked 9, a period is 
needed. The period is choice 2, so you would write 2 
in the parentheses.

EFFECTIVENESS OF EXPRESSION 
PART I: SENTENCE STRUCTURE AND STYLE 

(15 minutes) 

Directions: Different versions of each passage of prose are given in the two columns below. In this part of the tes 
you will be asked to choose the better version of each section, and to answer certain questions about the section 
First, read quickly through Column 1 of the passage to get the meaning of the whole passage. Then read the directioi 
below. 


Column 1 


Column 2

A boy has many hard problems to deal 
with; for example, there is the difficult task 
of getting the whole world into your head. 
You have to make a picture of it, and that 
is easy, but it must correspond with the 
world outside, but that keeps changing. 
You succeed in picturing the sun going 
around the earth; then you suddenly 
learn something more, and are forced to 
picture the earth whirling around the 
sun. This means a complete readjustment. 
At one time I thought the earth was flat, I 
had to put China and the Far East to the west 
of me, this was not an easy task for a boy. 
I did accomplish that, but shortly after, 
I studied a book which made the earth 
round like an orange. China’s loca¬ 
tion again was made uncertain to me.

An example of the many hard problems a 
boy must deal with, the difficult task of 
getting the whole world into your head. 
You have to make a picture of it; that’s easy, 
but the picture has to correspond somewhat 
with the world outside, which keeps changing. 
Having the sun going around the earth, 

something more is suddenly learned and the 
earth must be pictured whirling around the 

sun, necessitating a complete readjustment. 
I remember how, when I thought the earth 
was flat, I had to put China and the Far East 
^ to the west of me—no easy task for a boy. 
Then, when I had accomplished that, I studied 

a book which made the earth round like an 

orange. Where was one to put China then?

te following questions by putting the number of the correct choice in the parentheses at the right. 


Column 1 

A method of testing and grading samples of 
wool that has been in use for centuries is the 
visual method, and experts have always disagreed. 
What one appraiser saw and felt in a bit of un¬ 
cleaned fleece was not always what another saw. 
The United States Treasury Department has now 
officially adopted a new means of testing wool. 
This is a mechanical-chemical-photographic 
method. It is a means of testing wool im¬ 
ports whereby their freedom from grease, dirt, 
burrs, etc., is determined by the new method. 
In the laboratory, dust, grease, and 
other impurities are removed by chemicals, 
burrs, seeds, etc., are not so removed. 
Another chemical bath makes the vegetable matter 
highly visible when photographed, while the wool 
itself does not show on the photographic plate.

For centuries samples of wool have been tested

have disagreed through all these centuries. 
Different appraisers seeing and feeling some¬ 
thing different in a bit of uncleaned fleece. 
Now the United States Treasury Department 

has officially adopted a mechanical-chemical- 

photographic means of testing wool imports for 

their freedom from grease, dirt, burrs, etc. 
In the laboratory, chemicals remove the dust, grease, 


and all other impurities, except burrs, seeds, etc. 
This vegetable matter is made highly visible when

As a result the destruction of rare and beautiful birds 
has been greatly reduced, though not entirely 
stopped, in late years. 

Not so many years ago birds were slaughtered ruth¬ 
lessly for their plumage,-.which was used to decorate 
women’s hats. 

Through the agitation of the Audubon Societies and 
other groups of bird lovers, laws have been passed 
restricting such traffic in the plumage of birds. 

Few people realize what an important part women 
have had in the extermination of some of our most 
beautiful birds. 

In 1878 it was estimated that there were over three 
million white egrets in Florida alone; today there 
are only a few of them left—the rest have been 
killed for plumes.
