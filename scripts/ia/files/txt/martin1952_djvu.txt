THE PROBLEM 


The problem, with which this investigation was 
concerned, was the design and construction of an 
electrical flow model, which could be applied by 
analogy to flow problems encountered in the analysis 
of petroleum reservoirs, especially those dealing 
with the design of secondary recovery projects.

ABSTRACT 


A Potentiometric Petroleum Reservoir Analyzer 
**The Design and Construction of an Electric Analog Simulator 
Applicable to the Analysis of Natural Petroleum Reservoirs.* 1 


Many reservoir engineering problems are essentially problems 
in fluid mechanics. The differential equations describing the reservoir 
flow system are not easily solved, due very often, to an inability to 
express mathematically the complex boundary conditions which prevail. 
However, in most cases, solutions may be obtained by the use of analogy. 

The fundamental requirements for the existence of an analogy 
between two physical systems are outlined with special reference to fluid 
flow and electron flow phenomena. To meet these fundamental requirements 
it is necessary to introduce certain assumptions and restrictions con¬ 
cerning the nature of the fluid flow. 

The potentiometric model selected for this study is capable 
of solving problems involving the two dimensional steady state flow of 
single phase fluids through porous media. More complex models capable 
of solving unsteady state flow problems are possible, but were considered 
beyond the scope of the present research program. 

The model developed during this investigation is semi-automatic 
in operation, and employs electronic controlled null-balance motors. 

The machine is capable of locating the isopotential lines of a flow 
pattern, and is also capable of plotting the flow lines directly by

the use of a four probe search array. The self balancing potentio¬ 
meter is designed so that the process of evaluating the transit time 
of a particle along a flow line is reduced to a simple summation of 
successive potentiometer readings. The arrangements for duplicating 
the flow pattern, existing in the reservoir, are outlined; and the 
associated measuring and automatic control circuits are described 
in detail. 

The model ! s performance and precision are evaluated by 
analyzing an idealized "five-spot* flood pattern. The results so obtained 
are compared with published results of previous investigations of the 
same problem. This comparison indicates the model is performing satis¬ 
factorily with an average error of one percent. Experience gained 
in this preliminary operation indicates certain improvements in the 
model are desirable. These proposed improvements are outlined. 

A detailed operations manual for the machine describing 
the setting-up procedure, operation, and maintenance of the model is 
included as an appendix to the main report.

A POTENTIOKSTRIC PETROLEUM RESERVOIR ANALYZER 

"The Design and Construction of an Electric Analog Simulator 
Applicable to the Analysis of Natural Petroleum Reservoirs" 

Introduction 

Oil and gas reservoirs found in nature, present problems 
in fluid mechanics -which are difficult to solve by analytical methods. 
The complex and irregular structures, encountered in most reservoirs, 
produce boundary conditions which would result in cumbersome equations 
if expressed mathematically. No two reservoirs present the same 
set of boundary conditions. Past experience therefore, can only 
serve as a guide, when determining the most efficient method of 
producing a specified field. Direct experimentation on the oil 
reservoir is possible to only a limited extent, since early errors 
cannot be rectified, nor their effects eliminated. 

If a small scale model could be constructed duplicating 
all conditions encountered in the reservoir, it would be possible to 
conduct repeated trials using the model, and so arrive at the most 
efficient production procedure. 

A scale model of the field could be constructed using a 
porous medium filled with the appropriate fluids under a suitable 
pressure. Trial runs, employing various producing methods, could then 
be made and the most satisfactory production method selected. The method 
chosen by means of the model study might then be applied to the field 
with some confidence. Such models ° have been constructed to 
duplicate conditions in isolated section of reservoirs. However, 
to duplicate an entire field by this method, would be a large under- 






- 2 - 


taking, since it is possible to obtain only limited scale reduction 
by the use of this type of model. The limited scale reduction is 
due to the fact that the physical characteristics of the fluids employed 
must be reduced in scale, and yet retain the same relative effect on 
flow characteristics. 

A different approach to the problem has so far, produced 
better results. Darcy*s law, governing the flow of fluids through 
porous media, is basically a rate equation of the form: 

Rate of flow = Driving Force 

Resistance 

The similarity between Darcy* s law, and Ohm*s law governing 
electrical flow, has been recognized. Attempts have been made to 
construct an electrical analogy to the oil reservoir, and to apply 
the results obtained from electrical measurements to the solution of 


the fluid flow equations 





-3- 


THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE ANALOGY 


The existance of an analogy between fluid flow through a 
porous medium, and electron flow through a conducting medium, depends 
upon the fundamental similarity between the equations governing such flow. 
These equations are, Laplace 1 s equation of continuity and the rate 
equations represented by Darcy’s Law and Ohm’s Law. The following 
discussion will compare these equations and deal with the conditions, 
which must be satisfied, before the analogy between the two phenomena 
is complete. 

The Equation of Continuity in Fluid Flow 

The development of Laplace’s equation of continuity for the 
case of a compressible fluid flowing through a porous medium, results 
in the expression, 

+f 2 (e^) ]AX.Ay.AZ. - ('■) 

(See appendix A, Page (i ) for the development of this expression.) 

The Rate Equation in Fluid Flow (Darcy’s Law ) 

Darcy’s law describing the rate of flow of a fluid through 
a porous medium may be expressed mathematically as follows: 

~ ~ ” AX 

Equation (2) assumes the absence of gravitational 
attraction acting on the fluid. 

Darcy’s law may now be combined with the equation of 
continuity to give equation (3).

For the purpose of the subsequent discussion, equation (3) will be 
referred to as the general equation describing fluid flow through 
porous media. 

The Equation of Continuity in Electron Flow, 

Laplace*s equation of continuity may be developed for the 
case of electrical energy flowing through a conducting medium. If 
the conducting medium be considered to possess the property of 
capacitance the following expression results:

The Hate Equation in Electron Flow 

Ohm*s law for electrical energy flow through a conducting 


medium may be expressed as follows:

Since the electrical resistance Ex" is directly proportional to the 


distance traversed, Adc, and inversely proportional to the specific 
conductivity,^, and cross sectional area, Ohm*s law may be 

rewritten as:

The Analogy 

The study of a physical system involves the consideration 
of three items, the system variables, the system constants and 
parameters, and finally the equations describing the system. In 
the case of an oil reservoir the system variables are the formation 
pressure (temperature is also a variable but one ordinarily not 
considered) and the flow rate, which in general will vary with position 
and time. The system parameters may be classified in two groups; those, 
such as permeability, porosity and geometrical shapes, which are 
characteristic of the medium, and viscosity, compressibility and density, 
which are characteristic of the fluid. The equation describing the 
flow of fluid in a reservoir has been presented as equation (3) in the 
above section. 

With this information available, it is possible to visualize 
a variety of physical systems analogous to an oil reservoir. An 
analogous system will possess a set of variables, corresponding to 
those of the prototype, a corresponding set of parameters, and a set 
of equations of identical form to those encountered in the prototype. 

A prototype system and an analogical system may be related 
by equating each variable and parameter of one system to a proportionality 
constant times the corresponding variable or parameter of the other 
system. The end result is then a set of transformation equations, by 
which the parameters and variables of one system can be computed provided 
those of the other system are known.

These analogous systems may be employed to advantage in 


two situations often encountered in practice. For example, suppose 
all the parameters of a given system are known, and the equations 
are available^ it is then possible to evaluate the variables by analytical 
methods* This may introduce mathematical complexities that cannot be 
handled* By the use of the transformation equations, it is possible to 
construct an analogous system* This system may be set in operation, its 
variables measured and, by again using the appropriate transformation 
equations, the corresponding prototype variables may be evaluated to 
obtain the desired result. A model analogy, constructed and used on this 
basis, is termed a computer* Suppose now, that the values of some of the 
parameters in the prototype are unknown, due to the fact that they are 
inaccessible, or that the phenomena produced by the system proceed with 
such slowness that it is impossible to carry out the necessary obser¬ 
vations to determine them. Suppose also that the equations governing 
the system are known. It is now possible to construct an analogical 
model embodying precise values of the known parameters, and a series 
of adjustable values for the unknown parameters. Such a model is 
called a simulator. It is now possible by repeated trials to adjust 
the values of unknown parameters until the variables of the simulator 
match the observed values of accessible variables of the prototype. The 
actual, or at least mathematically equivalent, structure of the prototype 
has now been determined, and the simulator becomes a computer, capable of 
predicting the future behavior of the prototype.

The formation of the Analogy 

When an attempt is made to form an analogy between fluid 
flow through a porous medium, and electron flow through a conducting medium, 
the first requirement to be satisfied is the identity of form of the 
respective equations. 

It is convenient at this point to examine more closely the 
equations involved:

the equation for electrical energy flow, 

While these equations are in many respects similar in their present 
form, certain differences are evident. For example, the pressure, p, 
in the fluid system is analogous to the potential, E, in the electrical 
system^ yet E appears on the right hand side of equation ( 5 ) while 
p does not appear in the corresponding place in equation (3). Also 
the specific conductivity, < 5 - .which is a parameter of equation ( 5 ) 

k 

is a constant and at the same time analogous to the expression f <° - ^ 

an obvious variable. 

Gertain assumptions must be introduced at this point to 
overcome these discrepancies. Various assumptions are possible, 
and lead to different analogies. The analogies may be arbitrarily 
grouped into two general classes (with three sub-classifications in

each general class) according to the assumptions made in reducing 
equations (3) and ( 5 ) to similar form. The general division is 
introduced due to the existence of two possible methods of producing 
a variation in the effective specific conductivity,^, of the 
medium. One possible solution is to vary the thickness of the con¬ 
ducting sheet proportionally with permeability, k $ or the perme¬ 
ability-viscosity ratio, A . This of course destroys the geometrical 

similarity between model and prototype in the. ,Z. direction. There- 

•• 

fore whenever such assumptions are made the analogy becomes restricted 

(z±) 

to two dimensional flow. The second possible solution is to destroy 

the continuity of the model *s conducting medium, replacing it with 

W) 

a resistance network connecting arbitrarily selected points. The 
resistance between points may now be selected at will. This rather 
drastic treatment also destroys the continuity of all variables with 
respect to position, continuity with time, alone remaining. 

The sub-classifications occur due to the existance of various 
methods of reducing the right hand side of equation ( 5 ) to similarity 
with the corresponding expression in equation (3). 

The simplest assumption that can be made is to restrict the 
problem to steady state flow conditions. This immediately reduces the 
right hand side of the equation to zero. When this restriction is combined 
with the concept of a continuous conducting sheet contoured, to represent 
variations in the permeability-depth product of the reservoir, as previously 
outlined, it is possible to form an exact analogy between the two systems.

Since in general, the density, f, and the viscosity, a ,,

are functions of the pressure, it is possible to define a new quantity, }■ , 
such that

If now, this function is introduced into the differential form 
of equation (3) and also if in equation (3), x is put equal to, ax*, 
y is put equal to^y and z is put equal to ( bx where,b ? is not necessarily 
constant, and if in addition all flow in the z direction is ignored, 
equations (3) and (5) may be rewritten as 



It is apparent that the two equations are now similar in form. It is 
possible to equate the two parameters,^, and &r>d kyb ) 

provided the permeability in the x direction equals the permeability in

factor, i>, was previously defined as the ratio of prototype thickness to 
model thickness. If this ratio is substituted for it can be seen that

This is the desired transition equation, and the analogy is 
now complete, since the function, may be equated to, 3JE, where F 
is another arbitrary scale factor, without further alteration to the 
equations* 

We have now developed two transition equations which may be 
summarized as follows. 

Fluid flow resistance 

Electron flow resistance 

Fluid driving force 

Electron driving force 

Two other transition equations or ratios exist, which may be 
derived from those already presented* These are, first, the ratio between 
Volumetric rate of flow, Q, in barrels per day, and the quantity of 
electrons flowing, i, in coulombs per second or amperes; and second, the 
ratio between the prototype time t, in days and the model time, t ! , in 
seconds* 

Consider the rate equations

and

The discharge time of a system, is normally obtained from the 
product of the resistance and capacitance of the system, and the ratio 

between two systems would be given by, 

t __ c r ^ 

However, in the case of steady state flow, to which the present 
discussion is limited, there is no capacity effect considered, hence the 
ratio £5 is indeterminate and another development is required to determine 
the model time t. 

The local rate of advance of a fluid particle along any stream 
line in the reservoir, may be considered one dimensional flow and may be 

evaluated by applying Darcy’s Law:

(Reference 24 
and 12) 

This is not a true transformation equation since the model time 
does not appear. However, the model transit time is not a variable 
that can be conveniently measured, and, therefore, the above equation 
is used whenever an estimate of the transit time is required. 

The more complex problem of the analogy between unsteady state 
flow in a reservoir, and unsteady state flow in an electrical system is 
analyzed in detail in Appendix B. The general method involves the intro¬ 
duction of the analogy existing between the ability of a condenser to accumulate 
electrical energy, and the ability of a compressible fluid to accumulate both 
energy and fluid in a fixed volume. 

An equation of state must also be introduced to relate pressure 
and fluid density. 

This analogy'leads to a very versatile model, generally referred to 
as an ’’Electric Analyzer”, which is capable of reproducing the pressure 
decline curves for individual wells of a reservoir operating under expansion 
drive or gas cap drive. 

This model may be constructed using a continuous conducting sheet, 
or a resistance network to simulate the porous medium. The electrical 
capacity is added to simulate the storage capacity of small blocks of the 
reservoir. Provision is also made to simulate the effects of a partial 

(H) 

water drive, gas cap drive and artificial flooding.

A Description of Models in Use 
(a) Historical Development of Electrical Analogs 

The earliest recorded use of the analogy existing between fluid 

flow and electron flow, was a study, conducted by G.X. Taylor and C.F.

Shannan. These men investigated the analogy existing between the irrotational 
flow of a compressible fluid in two dimensions and the flow of electricity 
in a conducting sheet of variable thickness* This analogy was used to 
investigate the flow patterns existing about airfoil cross-sections. It 
is interesting to note that the present potentiometric model with minor 
modifications could be adapted to this study. The method employed, involved 
the contouring, by successive approximations, of the conducting sheet to 
correspond to the variations in fluid density. 

The first application of the analogy to oil reservoir problems 

Gt'> 

was made by B. D. Wyckoff, H. G. Botset and M. Muskat in 1933* The model 
devised by these investigators was of the migrating ion type in which a 
potential field was applied to a conducting sheet containing an ion indicator. 
This basis model has been improved by later work, and remains a useful model 
to the present time. 

H 

Hurst and McCarty in 1941 made the first published attempt to apply 
the preciseness of potentiometry to the study of oil reservoir migration 
problems. Their method involved a single probe mapping of the potential field 
to obtain a system of equipotentials. The current lines were then constructed 
graphically by drawing a system of curves interesecting the equipotential 
lines at right angles. From this resulting map a chart was drawn for each 
flow line showing potential as a function of distance along the line.

Each chart was then differentiated graphically to obtain a curve of voltage 
gradient as a function of distance. The area under each curve was then 
integrated with a planimeter and a new chart drawn for each current line 
showing this integral as a function of distance. The ordinates of this 
last curve were proportional to the transit time between any two points. 

This was the desired result. This laborious procedure prevented wide 
application of the method, and as far as is known this was the only attempt 
made to apply it. In 1947, D. B, Lee introduced several simplifications to 
the procedure which permitted studies to be conducted using the potentiometric 
principle. The first simplification was the use of a pantograph to transfer the 
isopotential lines directly from the pool to the map, thus avoiding the necessity 
of replotting. The graphical integrations were avoided by making use of the 
relation: 


At <X 


AS 


A E 


If AS is sufficiently small and AE were maintained constant then 

At ce a$ z 


and At could be scaled off the map directly by means of a square scale ruler. 
The greatest advance was the introduction of the four probe array, which is 
described more fully in a later section 5 together with the orientation of the 
probes and the balancing of the potentiometer by phase sensitive motors. A 
totalizing device to sum the reciprocals of the voltage was also suggested by 
Lee. It is not clear from the published literature how manjr of these devices 
Lee actually experimented with and how many were merely suggestions. Certain 
difficulties in the design of the totalizer, would indicate that the author was 
making a general suggestion rather than describing a piece of equipment.

Redmond, Wolf, Muskat, and Marshall and Oliver all describe studies using 

a model similar in nature to the single probe method described by Lee* 

(ty) 

The next advance in technique was described by W* A. Bruce in 
1943. This advance was the inclusion of the additional analogy between 
fluid volumetric expansion and electrical capacitance as sources of driving 
energy, and resulted in the development of a new model known as the electrical 

I) I! 

analyzer# The chief use of this model is the investigation of time changes 
within the reservoir. 

This model has been improved by employing a resistance network 
rather than a contoured electrolytic sheet, to simulate the porous medium. 

Thus giving a model whose resistance parameters majr be varied at will* 

A further improvement of the model has been the inclusion of a unit to simulate 
the effect of a gas cap drive. 

The Migrating Ion Model 

This model was the first electrical analogy to be applied to 
reservoir problems. Thepprous medium of the reservoir is represented by a 
gelatine mat, moulded to the required shape, and rendered conducting by 
the inclusion of zinc ammonium chloride salt solution. The injection wells 
are represented by hollow plastic tubes with capillary tips piercing the 
gelatine mat. These plastic tubes are filled with gelatine, containing 
copper ammonium chloride and ammonium hydroxide solution. Electrical contact 
is provided by the insertion of a platinum electrode into the plastic tube. The 
producing wells are represented by tubes similar to those used as input points, 
except for the use of zinc ammonium chloride to render the gelatine conducting. 

In operation, the input and output wells are arranged to suit the 
conditions it is desired to duplicate. A direct current is passed between 
the input and output wells. The current through each individual well is

ad justed by means of a variable resistor, until it is proportional to the 
production or injection rate of the well concerned, 

"When the current has been switched on, the colored copper 
ammonium ions migrate from the input electrodes and their progress may be 
followed visually or recorded by means of a camera. The portion of the 
field invaded by the colored ions indicates the portion of the reservoir that 
would be invaded by fluid originating at the input wells. This invasion 
pattern represents the solution to the problem that the model was designed 
to solve. 

The potential gradient existing in the sensitized mat of the 
model must be maintained at a sufficiently high value to result in ion 
migration velocities greatly in excess of the ion velocities produced by 
diffusion. Therefore, the physical size of the conducting sheet must be 
made small in order to maintain a fairly high potential gradient, without 
using excessive voltages. This generally limits the model to the study 
of small portions of the reservoir. The dependence on ion migration velocities, 
to depict the model behavior, gives results that are considered to be of a 
qualitative nature only, especially in regions of low potential gradient. 

The Potentionmetric Model 

The potentiometric model has appeared in several forms. 

The basic units are similar in all forms of the model, the differences 
result from the incorporation of various auxilliarj 7- units, to reduce 
the labor involved in evaluating the model*s performance. 

The main portion of the model is the pool unit, containing a 
slightly conducting liquid, held in a basin contoured to represent 
the reservoir under consideration. Electrodes, representing input and 
output wells, are inserted through the bottom into the electrolyte.

The remainder of the pool unit consists of electrical circuits 
designed to control the currents to and from each electrode. This 
essential auxilliary equipment, consists of a potentiometer circuit, 
a voltage control circuit, and a null indicator, which is really an 
essential part of the potentiometer. 

The operating procedure for this form of the potentiometric 
model is rather laborous. After the pool model has been constructed and 
put in operation, the electrode currents are adjusted to the required 
values. An isopotential map is drawn from the model, maintaining a constant 
potential difference between successive isopotential lines. On this map a 
series of flow lines are drawn, crossing the isopotential lines at right 
angles. The distance between successive isopotential lines is measured 
along each How line. The transit time between each isopotential is then 
computed using the relation, 

0.2- pf (as') 

* f~ ’ V ' IT 

These time increments are then added together along each stream line to 
give the total transit time. Maps may now be prepared showing the invasion 
pattern after any desired time interval. This is the final result obtained 
from the model study. 

An improvement in the potentiometric model is the incorporation of 
a four probe search array. This refinement allows the direct plotting of the 
stream lines without the necessity of constructing them from an isopotential 
map. The four probe array consists of four electrodes positioned in the form of 
a cross. This array is pivoted about one of the electrodes. One pair of 
electrodes, which will be referred to as the equipotential probes, are 
connected to the null indicator. The array is rotated until a minimum signal

is received. These two electrodes are then on an equipotential line. The 
second pair of probes will then be oriented so that the line joining them 
coincides with a flow line. The positions of the probes are now recorded on 
the map. The potentiometer is connected to these probes and measures the 
potential drop, ae, between them. As before, the transit time between two 
points is given by the relation: 

? , / *- 

__a*; P-P Cas) 

F k AE 

Since as^ is now the spacing between the two probes, it is a constant, 
and the transit time is proportional to the reciprocal of the voltage. A 
flow line may be mapped by placing one of the current probes at a desired 
starting point, orienting the array, marking the location of the second probe, 
moving the array until the first probe occupies this position, and then 
reorienting the array. By proceeding in this manner, the entire flow line 
map may be constructed. 

Two other improvements may be added to speed up the operation of 
the potentiometrie model. These consist of a phase sensitive reversible 
induction motor, controlled by the null indicator, which automatically orients 
the four probe array. A similar motor is used to drive the potentiometer 
shaft, and keep the potentiometer balanced. A totalizing device may also 
be connected to the potentiometer to record and total the reciprocals of the 
voltage readings. 

The Electrical .Analyzer 

This model analogy was first devloped by W. A. Bruce of 
the Carter Oil Company, To date, this is the only model developed 
to handle compressible flow, in the cases of a single or two phase reservoir•

The central section of this model consists of a pool unit, 
representing the oil reservoir. This unit may be a contoured model 
containing a liquid electrolyte. In which case, additional electrodes 
located at the centres of arbitrarily assigned blocks must be included. 

Condensers, of a value determined by the relation 

C £ = 8 Vi f c 

for each block, are connected to these electrodes. Or, the pool may 
be represented by a resistance network connecting the centres of the 
chosen blocks. Condensers are again connected to these centre points. 

A power supply is required, which will deliver a D.C. voltage of variable 
value, which, when once set, will retain a constant value regardless of 
random mains fluctuations. 

The Injector Unit must supply current to simulate the action of 
an input well. In general an input well provides a given input rate, 
independent of the bottom hole pressure. Due to this fact, a constant 
current charging device must be used in the input unit of the analyzer. 

This requires that the current be supplied through a pentode tube to each 
input well, or to each group of input wells that may be considered to be 
operating against the same bottom hole pressure. 

The Discharge or Production unit is similar to the input 
unit except that it allows a constant discharge rate, equivalent to the 
producing rate of the well it represents. Here again one pentode may 
control a group of wells provided the bottom hole pressures are the same. 

The design of the Water Drive unit depends upon the fact that 
regardless of the shape of the producing area of a reservoir and the location

of the wells in it, the isopotentials in the surrounding aquifer ultimately- 
become circles at some point away from the field. A small scale potentiometric 
model of the field, including a portion of the surrounding aquifer is used to 
determine the shape of the adjacent isopotentials and the point at -which they 
maybe considered as circles* The resistance between adjacent noncircular 
isopotentials can be determined directly from the model, while the resistance 
between more remote circular isopotentials, is determined from the relation^ 



(These equations 
developed by 




W. A. Bruce. 


Reference 4 in 
Bibliography.) 



With values of R and obtained in this manner a resistance - condenser 
chain may be constructed to represent the surrounding aquifer and is called 
the water drive unit. 

A Gas Drive Unit has been described in detail by Schaeffer and a 
circuit diagram is available. This unit required two pentodes for each point 
in the reservoir to be supplied with a gas cap drive. These will normally 
be only a few blocks near the centre of the field in contact with a gas cap. 

The timer consists of a master oscillator, producing a D.C. pulse 
at some fixed time interval. This can be accomplished by means of a thyratron 
discharge circuit or by a rotating contact device. Selector or counting circuits 
are required to obtain multiples of this fundamental time unit. The timer unit 
acts as the master automatic control, switching in all of the auxilliary circuits 
as required, to duplicate the production history of the oil reservoir.

Details on the design of this analogical model are not given in the 
literature, and a complete description is beyond the scope of this work. 

A brief summary of the electrical equipment required for 
the construction of each of the models is given in Table I. 

Characteristics and Limitations of the Models 

A comparison of these models from the standpoint of their 
characteristics and limitations is largely a review of the mathematical 
assumptions employed in attaining the analogy. The characteristics of a 
particular model are determined by the method, employed of reproducing the 
variation of any parameter of the prototype reservoir. Similarily the 
limitations of any model are a direct result of the mathematical assumptions 
made in its construction. 

In general, the analogical model must deal with variations in 
the properties of both fluid and porous medium as these alter with changes 
in position and time. Hone of the models, developed at present, are capable 
of reproducing all of these variations. Table II presents a list of these 
variations and the methods of dealing with the variation, employed by each model.

Field of Application of the Model 

The selection of a model type, to aid in the solution of 
a problem, depends upon the nature of the problem under consideration. 
If the problem is mainly concerned -with the movement of fluid in the 
reservoir, while changes with time are of secondary interest, the 
potentiometric model, will be applicable. If the problem is mainly 
concerned with changes in the variables, dependent upon time, the 
electrical analyzer is the logical choice. A list of the more common 
types of problems, together with the applicability of each model is 
given in Table III.

A comparison of the three types of electrical models in 

their present state of development, leads to the following general 

conclusions. 

1. The Electrolytic and Potentiometric models are directly competing 
types, due to the fact that they both start from the same set of 
assumptions and are applied to the solutions of the same problems. 

2. The chief advantage of the Electrolytic model is the ease with 
which its results are interpreted, compared to the Potentiometric 
Model, 

3# The chief disadvantage of the Electrolytic model is its relatively 
limited field of application due to its limited dimensions, and the 
fact that in areas of low potential gradient, the results are 
obscured by molecular diffusion, 

4. It may be concluded that the potentiometric model employing the 
four-probe array, is the better choice between these two. This 
model can be adjusted to solve any problem in two dimensional steady 
state flow. 

5. The Electrical Analyzer is primarily designed for the solution of 
unsteady state flow. Hence, in general problems that can be solved 
by means of the potentiometric method, are problems that would be 
difficult to solve by means of the Electric Analyzer. 

6. The two models are complementary in nature, and the specific problem 
to be solved will normally dictate which analogy is to be used.

IV. DESIGN AND CONSTRICTION OF THE POTENTIOMETRIC MODEL 

Selection of the Model Type 

The potentiometric model was selected because it is versatile 
in its application, and at the same time is of relatively simple 
construction. The potentiometric model employing the four probe array, 
will handle a greater variety of problems than the migrating ion type, 
which is limited by the excessive voltages required for large sized models. 

The real choice in models lay between the potentiometric type 
and the electric analyzer. The electric analyzer is undoubtedly the more 
versatile model, but its greater complexity indicated that the potentiometrij 
model would be the better starting point. The experience gained in the 
present study, indicates that any attempt to build an electric analyzer 
as a graduate research project would be best accomplished as a joint 
undertaking of several graduates.

developed during this study is shown in figure (2.). The model is seen 
to consist of a conventional power supply unit, supplying D. C. power of 
various voltages to the remaining circuits of the model, an oscillator, 
supplying audio frequency signals to the pool, and other circuits, two null 
indicators, which receive error signals from the k probe array and control 
the motor units. Motor control circuits which supply power to the balance 
motors; and a potentiometer, for measuring voltage drops in the pool. 

(ii) The Oscillator 

(iaX*5r) 

It was reported by previous investigators that a dead zone existed 
at the null point of the response curves of the null detectors used in their 
models, this was mainly due to the fact they were using 60 cycle

excitation in the pool unit* and hum in the amplifier tended to mask the null 
point* It was decided to use a frequency for the pool excitation that differed 
sufficiently from 60 cycle, that it could be separated from the hum by a 
frequency sensitive network. The phase sensitive detectors of the null 
indicator circuits are extremely sensitive to signal frequency, and in 
effect eleminate all frequencies except that of the received signal. 

A second reason for choosing a high frequency signal for the 
pool voltage, was the effect of polorization at the electrodes. Where 
polorization effects are lafge, they produce a poor minimum point, and the 
minimum so obtained does not correspond to the true null point. 

This polarization can be controlled either by increasing the 
surface area of the electrodes, or increasing the frequency of the alternating 
current.

It is also realized that with increased frequency, the losses due 
to stray inductance and capacitance increase, and these losses cannot be 
accurately predicted. With the relatively large spacing and small area of 
the electrodes to be used, inthe model, it was decided that a frequency of 
about 400 cycles would be a suitable compromise. This frequency is easy to 
separate from the 60 cycle hum, and the null points are sharp, indicating that 
polarization is not excessive. 

For the above reasons, a conventional resistance, capacitance, 
coupled audio oscillator was designed, with a variable frequency between 
200 and 400 cycles/second. 

This oscillator is connected to two power amplifier stages as 
shown in Fig, ( 3 ). 

The oscillator and pre amplifier are of conventional design. 

The driver stages each consist of a 6 V 6 tube, triode connected, and 
transformer coupled to the output stage, which consists of two 6 B 4 tubes 
operating as a Class A - push-pull amplifier. The null detector output is 
obtained from two transformers, their primaries in parallel, and their 
secondaries in series. The potentiometer voltage Is obtained from a separate 
transformer whose primary is in parallel with the two supplying the null 
indicators. 

A suggested modification to this circuit is the removal of the 
potentiometer gain control from its present location, since it has been 
found that the null indicators require this control to be set near maximum. 

It is possible to obtain independent control of potentiometer voltage by 
adding another triode, obtaining its signal from the pre-amp stage, and 
supplying the potentiometer.

(iii) The Potentiometer 


The potentiometer employed in this model is of a more unorthodox 
design, the components being variable condensers rather than variable 
resistance elements* 

The basis circuit is shown in Fig* #(4). 

It is seen, that with the multiplying switch in position 1«, 
then the voltage,^ across*is given by the expression:

When and Go are constant this expression indicates that, ~~ , 
varies linearly with In the model, (J, is a variable condenser, whose 

capacity is linear with angular position of the rotor, and the potentiometer 
circuit thus produces a linear scale with respect to »

The remaining variable and fixed condensers of the network have 
been added to reduce the variation in the total impedence of the circuit 
to negligible proportions so that the range-change switch may function. 

The computed values presented in Table IV, show that the percent deviation 
from the average value of the capacity for the network never exceeds a 
maximum of about one tenth of 1%, This will produce a deviation of one 
hundredth of 1% in the voltage applied across and C 2 , when the multiplying 
shunt is in use. 

This inherent inaccuracy was considered negligible for the 
uses to which this model will be put. 



TABLE IV 

Relationship between Capacity and Angular Position of Variable Condensers in Potentiometer 


^ 38 ' 






















































































- 39 - 


The variable condensers are so geared together that the 
numerical values of C-^, Go >9 C^, and C6 are related to angular position, 
in the manner shown in Table IV, The condensers are in turn geared to 
rotating dials which indicate reciprocal volts on a linear scale over the 
range 1 to 10. The multiplying switch gives three ranges XL, X10, and XLOO. 

The potentiometer as designed is therefore capable of measuring voltages 
with one thousand fold variation. 

The variable condensers and rotating scale are driven by a phase 
sensitive induction motor, which balances the potentiometer, and is itself 
controlled by the null indicator - controller. 

An overrange protection is supplied by a stop switch, mounted on 
the dial shaft which actuates a reversing relay when the end of scale travel 
is reached. The balance motor will therefore cycle at the end of the 
potentiometer travel until the range change switch is operated. 

When an alternating current potentiometer is used, it is necessary 
to provide for adjustment of the potentiometer voltage phase, to coincide 
with the phase of the voltage to be measured. For this purpose a phase shift 
network is provided to alter the potentiometer phase as required. 

To calibrate the potentiometer, a thermocouple voltmeter with an 
accuracy of 0.is provided and connected to measure the applied voltage 
across the potentiometer circuit. It has been noted that this voltmeter, to 
some extent, alters the applied voltage when switched into the circuit. It is 
suggested that a shunt resistance equal to the voltmeter resistance be 
installed, to be used when the voltmeter is not connected in the circuit. 

It has also been noted, that the present input circuit of the null 
detector does not produce a true potentiometric action, and actually loads the 
potentiometer to some extent at balance. The net effect of this loading action.

is to reduce the span of the potentiometer from the theoretical one to ten 
reciprocal volts to an actual span of approximately one to eight reciprocal 
volts. 

For the purpose of the preliminary tests, this error was absorbed in the 
arbitrary scale factor, and the gap in the potentiometer scale between 8 and 
10 was covered by halving the voltage applied to the potentiometer and in 
effect introducing a subsidiary range change equal to X5. This expedient is 
recognized as temporary, and the trouble should be corrected, either by 
increasing the size of the potentiometer variable condenser or by redesigning 
the null indicator input circuit to obtain a closer approach to an infinite 
impedence at this point. 

IV The Null Indicator 

The null indicator circuit was designed to have a high impedence 
input circuit; the ability to separate a small error signal from a large 
common mode signal; the ability to detect the phase of the error signal; 
the ability to separate the required signal from extraneous hum; and 
sufficient output voltage to control the phase sensitive motors, and 
operate a control relay. 

A simplified block diagram of the null indicator is presented in 
Figure ( 5 ) 

The input stage, or differential detector was developed by Mathew 
Conrad. The details of this circuit are shown in Figure r(£). 

It is desired that the input stage be responsive to an error signal 
but should give zero output, whenever,, Afi, is zero, even though a large common¬ 
mode signal ? e ( , exists between each of the grid inputs and ground.

The operation of the circuit is as follows. Assume that equal 
signals are applied to both input grids ( is zero) and assume for the 
moment that there is no signal in the plate or cathode circuit of Yy Then 
equal voltages^ and, appear at the grids of and ^ ow cons ^ er

where a is the fractional portion of the cathode load resistor of V^, above 
the tap and whose value is to be determined. 

For the plate current of V^ to be constant the relation

must be satisfied, where^is the amplification factor of Yy Substituting 
for * ^ and^ep, » the following expression is obtained.

Thus, if the tap in the load resistor is adjusted to satisfy this relationship, 
the original assumption of no signal in Y^ justified, assuming linear tube 
characteristics. 

The response of the amplifier to differential signals ( ie not zero) 
is more difficult to analyze. It is seen that and drive the grid and

and cathode of in opposite directions, thus applying a portion of,Ae, 
between grid and cathode of Yy There is some feedback between and Y^ 
and the net result is an output for,Ae, signals roughly of the order that 
would be obtained using V as a simple amplifier. 

With this circuit it is possible to amplify a,Ae^ signal between 
zero and five millivolts, with no interference from a common mode signal as 
high as four volts. 

The phase shifter is a conventional phase splitter followed by a 
resistance capacitance variable phase shift network. This circuit was added 
to the null, detector in order to correct the phase relation between the 
received signal and the phase reference voltage, and at present 1s only 
installed in the potentiometer null detector. The phase shifter is fol¬ 
lowed by two stages of amplification which are quite conventional and require 
no explanation. 

The phase sensitive detector is intended to detect the phase of 
the incoming signal and convert it to a D.C, voltage which increases 
with an increase in amplitude of an "in phase” signal and decreases with 
an increase in amplitude of an -'out of phase" signal. 

The basic circuit of the phase detector is shown in Fig. £7)* 

In this circuit, the plates of and Y^ are supplied with an A.C. voltage 

of the same frequency as the incoming signal, through a centre tapped 

transformer. Assume that the input signal is in phase with the plate voltage 

of V^. Then, when the grid signal swings positive will conduct while V 2 

having a negative plate voltage will not. On the negative half cycle of 

the input signal neither tube will conduct. The net effect of this action 

is that point A of the bleeder A B is held at a negative potential by the 

charge on condenser C^, since the full negative voltage is applied across 

the load resistor R L. VJhile the positive half cycle is dropped by the plate current

flowing through R^« The remaining condensers filter out the A.C. signal 
and Point C is maintained at a steady voltage below that of point D* 

When the phase of the input signal is reversed, the action 
described above is reversed and point C attains a voltage higher than point 
D. 

The balance control M RB M is adjusted so that, at zero signal, the 
potentials of the points C and D are identical. The phase sensitive detector 
is then ready for use. 

The D. C. amplifier is of conventional "push-pull* design, and 
produces a variation in output potential of approximately twenty volts, 
between null and full scale deflection. This variation in potential 
is used to operate a balance meter, a pencil-lift relay, and the motor 
control unit. 

The balance meter is a milliameter with a range of zero to 5 
milliamperes. The torsion springs have been reset to place the zero point 
at mid scale. Deviations from null are thus registered by deflections on 
either side of this zero point. A resistor in series with the meter limits 
current flow to 2 milliamperes at maximum deflection. 

Two such output meters are provided, one mounted on the front 
panel of the null indicator unit, the other mounted on the head of the 
pantograph. Switches at each metering station permit either meter to be 
connected to either null indicator, thus allowing the operator to monitor 
the action of both circuits at will. 

The pencil lift relay, is operated in parallel with the null 
meters, and it in turn controls the current to a solenoid which lifts the 
plotting pencil when the indicator is off null. 

The remaining output also in parallel, is used to drive the 
motor control unit. It is to be noted that all output voltages of the D.C. 

amplifier are at a reference potential of plus 150 volts with.

V* The Motor Control Unit 

This circuit was designed to supply sixty cycle power to 
the phase sensitive balancing motors, and to rotate the motors in such 
a fashion that the error signal received by the null indicators would 
decrease to zero* At which point the motors would stop rotating* It was 
originally intended to use a power control circuit similar to that 
in use on the Brown Instrument Company*s “Electronic Potentiometer” but 
the nature of the input signal necessitated major modifications. The 
basic circuit as finally evolved is shown in Figure (BJt 

It will be noted that the Cathodes of and are returned to 
a bleeder network which maintains the cathodes at approximately 160 volts 
positive. When A and B are at the same potential, approximately 150 volts, 
that is, the circuit is at null, both and V 2 are biased almost to “cut¬ 
off”, and only a small ripple of 120 cycles is passed through the motors. 
This has no driving action, and the motor remains stationary. 

When Point A becomes more positive due to an imbalance in the 
circuit, point B becomes less positive. Under these conditions will 
conduct on the positive half cycle of the plate voltage from transformer T , 
and will develop an A.C, voltage across the high impendence choke L]_. In 
Parallel with is the motor circuit consisting of the condenser C^, the 

motor control winding and condenser C 2 . It was decided to connect the 
motor in this fashion to avoid the presence of high voltage D.C. in the 
motor winding. 

The second winding of the motor is connected to the A.C. mains 


and is fully excited at all times. The condensers and in series.

with the motor control winding produce sufficient phase shift to operate the 

motor as a split phase induction motor. When the voltages on points A and 

B are reversed V will conduct instead of V , this reverses the phase of 
2 1 

the current through and the motor control circn it, reversing the 
direction of the motor. 

This circuit therefore fulfills the functions specified in the 
design. It is suggested that a small direct current passing through the motor 
winding would assist in damping the control system. This could be accomplished 
by placing a resistance in parallel with C^. It is recommended that this 
modification be carried out on the pool motor control circuit as the 
tendency of this system to cycle or "hunt” is at times excessive. 

VI Pool Control Unit 

This unit is designed to act as the centralized control system 
of the model. It consists of controls, regulating the currents to the pool 
electrodes ; switches regulating the use of the search probes; and other 
auxilliary controls whose action will be discussed separately. 

The power to the pool unit is supplied from one output circuit of 
the oscillator. This output is connected to two buss-bars in the control 
unit. One buss distributes current through twenty 100 ohm current measuring 
resistors, through twenty variable control resistors, to the pool unit 
terminal strip, where the current is available for the output wells of the 
model. The second buss distributes current through ten current resistors and 
control resistors to the pool unit to provide current for the input electrodes. 
A bank of three selector switches permits the potentiometer to measure the 
voltage drop across the current resistors and hence measure the current.

The remaining section of the table is used as the recording or 
plotting area. The pantograph permits direct recording of flow lines or 
isopotentials as determined in the pool. 

The pantograph consists of a carriage running on tracks the 
length of the table and a tee-square on tracks running across the carriage. 

One end of the tee square carries the 4 probe search array in the pool* 
while the other end carries the reference point and plotting pencil. These 
two rotating elements are joined by a cable drive wrapped around the pulleys 
and travelling in a helical groove. This wrap construction of the pulleys 
prevents slippage and assures that the angular relation between elements 
remains constant. The balance motor, mounted in the centre of the tee 
square is connected to the rotating elements by a conventional cable drive. 

The cables supplying electrical connections to the probes, motor, 
balance, meter, and solenoid are threaded through weighted pulleys to prevent 
the slack from interferring with the model’s operation. 

The cables are then brought up through the table over rollers 
and connected to the moving carriage. The cable between the carriage and 
tee square are carried over a spring-loaded roller which removes the slack 
from this section of the cables and still permits full motion of the tee square. 

The weighted cables cause the carriage to roll slightly toward the 
centre of travel. This action is objectionable and may be cured by the 
installation of a cable drive to the carriage and tee square, so that these 
elements will remain in a fixed location during the operation of the model.

(C) Theory of Operation of the Model 

(i) General Functions of the Model 

The chief function of the potentiometric model, is the 
duplication and analysis of a desired flow pattern from such information as 
may be available concerning the physical nature of an oil reservoir, its 
production rate, and its sources of energy. The accuracy of the results 
of any model study are naturally limited by the extent and accuracy of the 
available infomation. 

The physical shape of the reservoir, and the variations in 
permeability encountered within it, are built into the reservoir model, 
by means of contours made proportional to the permeability depth product of 
the oil bearing formation. This contouring should be as detailed as the 
available geological information permits. 

The well locations are marked by the insertion of electrodes 
representing these wells, and any natural drive in the reservoir must be 
represented by shaped electrodes, such that the input energy originating from 
this source generates the correct flow conditions. 

When the model has been thus constructed, the available information 
concerning the physical characteristics of the reservoir have been 
incorporated, and the model in future operation will automatically use 
this infomation in establishing the flow pattern. 

The reservoir engineer is able to modify this flow pattern 
by the choice of well locations and the control of flow rates of both injection 
and output wells. This flow pattern must then be mapped and the resulting 
invasion pattern obtained before the merits of a particular production method 
can be evaluated. 


The model, previously described, is designed to assist in the

evaluation of this flow pattern. The model is capable of plotting direct^, 
the isopotential, and stream lines, evaluating the potential gradients for 
each streamline, and determining the flow rate for each well. 

(2) Operation of the Model 

The action of the model in accomplishing the various functions 
listed above is best explained by reference to the “function” switch 
previously described in Section (B) Part (V^). The first position of this 
switch marked "Input isopotential, n enables the operator to trace 
isopotential lines, with the “pool reference earth” control as a reference 
point. In this position, the potentiometer ground, is connected to the 
centre tap of a variable resistor, connected across the input and output 
bus-bars of the pool supply. The other side of the potentiometer is 
connected to what is normally the foreward current probe of the four 
probe array. The potentiometer thus measures the voltage difference 
between the pool probe and the center tap of the "reference earth" control. 

In operation, the position of the first isopotential to be 
plotted, is selected arbitrarily, by the operator placing the probe on the 
desired location. The “reference earth" control is then adjusted until 
the potentiometer balances near the lower voltage end of its travel. The 
balance motor, change over switch is then thrown, disconnecting the potentiometer 
balance motor from the potentiometer motor control, and connecting the pool 
balance motor in its place. The rear, or locating probe of the 4 probe array 
is now brought up to occupy the spot previously occupied by the foreward 
probe. The array will now rotate until the foreward probe is again on the 
required isopotential line. By repeating the entire line may be plotted. 

Caution on the part of the operator is required when using this position, as 

the isopotential line must exist within the arc of the probe, otherwise the 
motor will continue rotation and damage will result.

Succeeding isopotential lines may be selected in two ways, with 
constant spacing along some streamline or with constant voltage difference* 

In the first instance the forward probe is moved to the required location, 
the balance motor changeover switch is thrown and the potentiometer allowed 
to come to balance* The potentiometer may be read at this point and the 
voltage difference between the two isopotential lines determined* The 
changeover switch is again placed in the isopotential plotting position, and 
the second line plotted in the same manner as the first. 

If a constant voltage difference is required between successive 
isopotentials, the probe is simply moved until the desired potential is shown 
on the potentiometer before it is locked in position by the changeover switch 
in all these measurements it should be borne in mind that the potentiometer 
readings are given in reciprocal volts, and must be converted to volts. 

With succeeding isopotential lines the potentiometer will progress 
toward the upper end of its voltage range^^hen this occurs, the probe is placed 
on the previously located isopotential, and the "reference earth"control is 
readjusted, until the potentiometer gives a reading at the lower voltage end of 
the scale* The next isopotential may now be determined as before. 

The second position of the "function" switch marked "output isopotential", 
is similar in action to that previously described, with the exception that the 
polarity of the potentiometer is reversed, and succeeding isopotentials are 
obtained, progressing outwards from the output electrodes. 

The third position of the "function" switch marked "gradient" is the 
four probe plotting position. The earthed side of the potentiometer is connected 
to the central or, locating probe of the array, and the other side of the 
potentiometer is connected to the forward current probe. The potentiometer will 
now show directly, the reciprocal voltage existing between the probes. The

rotation of the array is under the control of the isopotential probes and 
■will always rotate so that the array is correctly oriented in the pool. 

This array has an angular freedom of movement of approximately one and one half 
turns. It is necessary for the operator to examine this array from time to 
time, to make sure that the balance points used do not overrange this limit. 

If this does occur, it is only necessary to switch off the pool motor, and 
rotate the array 360 degrees, to overcome the difficulty. 

The fourth position of the "function ,T switch marked "input M.A" 
is for the purpose of measuring the current in each input electrode. The 
earthed side of the potentiometer is connected to the input bus-bar, while 
the other side is connected through a selector switch to each of the 100 ohm. 
current measuring resistors in turn. The potentiometer thus measure the 
potential drop across the resistor and hence the current to the electrode. 

The current control resistors may be adjusted until the correct value is 
obtained. In this connection, it is usually more convenient to place the 
potentiometer at the required value, switch off the motor and adjust the 
current control until null is registered on the null m&ter. 

The fifth position of the "function" switch marked "output M.A." 
is similar in nature and performs a duplicate function for the output electrodes.

Testing the Model 


After construction of the model was completed, its efficiency 
and precision were tested by performing an analysis of an idealized 
"five-spot" flood pattern* The pool model consisted of a lucite 
box twenty inches square containing approximately 3-| inches of 
electrolyte. The input and output electrodes consisted of lengths 
of quarter-round brass bar inserted in opposite corners of the pool, 
with electrical contact being made by means of brass screws passed 
through the bottom of the tank* The electrolyte consisted of a 
dilute solution of copper sulphate, sulphuric acid, and ethyl alcohol 
in water, made up in the following proportions: 

15 grams of Copper Sulphate (anhydrous), 

5 grams of Sulphuric acid, 

5 grams of Ethyl Alcohol, 

100 grams of Distilled Water* 

This stock solution was diluted with distilled water in the ratio of 
one part solution to fifty parts of water. 

With the model in operation the flow pattern was plotted giving 
the results shown in Eigure 11* In the course of this plotting, the 
location of the central stream line was first determined, by connecting 
a thread between the two electrodes, and transfering this line to 
the plotting paper by means of the locating probe. The model was 
!then switched on and the plotting array placed on this central line. 

The orientation of the plotting pencil was then adjusted until the 
balance point of the four probe array coincided with the central 
line. When this bearing was established, the remaining lines were 

(obtained in the manner previously described, and the potentiometer 

I 

readings were recorded for each interval along each streamline*

The potentiometer readings, in reciprocal volts, are shown in 
Table V. These readings are proportional to transit time, and 
their sum will be a measure of the total time required to travel 
the distance "S" along the streamline. The readings for each 
flow line were summed with the results shown in Table VI, 

Using the total transit time for a particle along the central 
!flow line (number One) as a base, the time intervals for each of 
[the remaining streamlines were summed on a progressive total basis 
until this total equalled the base time. In most cases it was 
.necessary to add a fraction of an interval in order to obtain the 
.equality. The necessary computations, determining the fraction of 
an interval required to give a total transit time of 191.74 
reciprocal volts, were included in Table VI. The required number 
of, , intervals was then measured off along each flow line to 

I 

give the Invasion pattern shown in Figure 11. 

I The area not included inside this invasion line was then 
devaluated by the use of Simpsorls Rule and the ratio of flooded 
area to total area was computed. This ratio is termed the 
'"flooding efficiency" of the invasion pattern and was found to 
Ibe 71 ,Z% in this problem. The published value for this efficiency 
Is given as 72.3$i 19 ' which would indicate that the model possess 


ja sufficient degree of accuracy for the problems it is designed 
to handle. 

As a further and more precise check of th© model's performance 
i mathematical analysis of the flow problem was conducted by the 
Mathematics Department of this University. In the course of this 
: Halvsis the general equation:

describing the pressure distribution was developed and confirmed 
the equation as published by M* Maskat. Using this equation, 
the location of the isopotential line bisecting the side of the 
unit square was computed. It is of interest to note that in the 
course of this calculation, the final coordinates of the calculated 
points are obtained by difference between two numbers which are 
almost equal. The result is that although the calculations start 
with "six figure" accuracy, the final coordinates have only "two 
figure" accuracy, with the second figure open to some doubt. 

The result of this is a certain amount of "scattering" of the 
calculated points. The same isopotential line was obtained from 
the model results by interpolation between two plotted lines* 

This interpolated line is presented in Figure 11 together with 
the locations of the calculated points* On examination of this 
plot it can be seen that the line obtained from the model forms 
the "best fit" line for the calculated points. This would 
indicate that the model is capable of plotting isopotential lines 
with greater accuracy than it is possible to obtain using the 
six figure exponential tables available, and computing the curve. 

It was also considered necessary to evaluate the accuracy 
of the model "while plotting a flow line and evaluating the 
poential gradient. To accomplish this, the pressure distribution 
was determined along one flow line, again using the general

ratio, ~ , a dimensionless group, from which all arbitrary 
constants have been removed. This same ratio was computed 
from the model results, by obtaining the reciprocal of the 
potentiometer readings for each, as , interval. These voltages 
were then summed, omitting the voltage drop accross the first,AS , 
interval, to obtain a total voltage corresponding to that used 
in the mathematical development. Each voltage drop was then 
divided by the total voltage to give the ratio,. ~ , for the 
model. These calculations are presented in tabular form, in 
Table VII, together with the results obtained from the mathem¬ 
atical analysis. & comparison of the two sets of data Is 
included In the table, and this comparison indicates that the 
model results check with the calculated results with an average 
error of less than one percent. The comparison also Indicates 
that the error Is random In distribution. This error Is at 
least partly due to the fact that the pantograph was not equipped 
with a suitable locking device at the time the measurements were 
made, and a tendency to shift In position while a potentiometer 
reading was being made, was noted. then the mechanical drive 
is installed on the pantograph, an improvement in accuracy is 
to be expected.

VI Conclusions and Recommendations 

It was demonstrated in the previous section, that the 
model*s accuracy was within one percent at all times, a figure which 
is considered adequate for the studies this model is designed to 
undertake. 

The self balancing features incorporated in the model, 
relieve the operator of much tedious manipulation and speed up the 
operation considerably. The incorporation, of an integrator to perform 
the summation of the potentiometer readings, would approximately double 
the speed of operation. Preliminary examination of the literature 
indicates that a "straight line" integrator, manufactured by Taylor 
Instrument Company could be modified to serve this purpose, and would 
appear to be well worth investigating. 

The operation of this machine during the preliminary tests 
has indicated certain modifications which should be included before 
the model is considered fully operational. These suggested changes 
have been indicated earlier, but are summarized here for convenience. 

(a) Modification to the Oscillator 

The oscillator unit should be modified to provide an independent 
control of the voltage supply to the potentiometer. This can be ac¬ 
complished by the incorporation of another triade to be, obtaining its 
signal from the "pre-amp" stage and driving the potentiometer supply 
transformer. 

(b) Modification of Potentiometer 

(i) Include a shunt resistance to replace the voltmeter 
when not in use, so that the phase shift network has a constant load.

(33) To overcome the loading effect of the null indicator on 
the potentiometer span, a larger variable condenser should be provided. This 
could be accomplished by using the second linear condenser at present used 
as ballast, in parallel with the measuring condenser. Larger non-linear 
condensers should then be added in place of the present ones. 

(c) Modification of Motor Control Unit. 

A resistor in series with the blocking condenser should be 
added to provide direct current to the motor control winding to assist in the 
damping of the control circuit. 

(d) Modification to Pantograph 

A mechanical drive should be added to the pantograph to lock 
it in position and prevent shippage while a reading is being taken. 

(e) Addition of Integrator 

The addition of a mechanical integrator would greatly speed up 
the action of the model. When these modifications have been completed, a sat¬ 
isfactory performance may be expected from the model.

The Equation of Continuity in Fluid Flow 



(^-t- ^(Oy) 


Consider an elemental volume, Ax.Ay. az, of a 
porous medium of poristy, f . Assume that a fluid, with a density, 

f, is entering in the y direction with a velocity Vy. The mass 
velocity will be the product of these two quantities, The 

total mass of fluid entering per unit time in the y direction will be 

ftfj, AXAZ 

Consider also the fluid leaving the block in the y direction, with a 
mass velocity 


D 


f Vy + A 


The total mass leaving per unit time in the y direction will be 

C My ^ ^ a 

The mass increase in the block due to flow in the y direction will 
be the difference between these two quantities,

AT - rfiy + A(f^)J AXA2. 


which on simplifying becomes

(ii) 


Similarily, for flow in the x direction, the mass increase is 

- A(e wit) Ay. azj 

while for flow in the z direction the mass increase is 


- a (e y z ) a. y. ax 


The total mass increase per unit time is given by the sum of these 
three quantities and may be written, 

- [a( e V*) A.y AZ + A (e V-y) AX AI f- A(f IT*) AX A;/j 

But, the total mass increase per unit time is also equal to the 
product of the fluid volume and the change in density per unit time, 
These two expressions can be equated to give

APPENDIX B 


Detailed Development of Unsteady State Fl ow Analogy 


The general equations governing fluid flow through 


porous media and electron flow through conducting media were developed 
in Appendix A. The simple case of steady state flow was dealt with in 
the body of this dissertation. The more complex problem of unsteady 
state flow* and the electrical analogy required to deal with it will 
now be discussed. 


If the density of the fluid may not be considered independent 


of time at a point then the right hand side of the general equation no 
longer equals zero. 

The expression 



must be altered to a similar form to the expression 



The relation between density and pressure in a single phase liquid 
system is given by l

where* is the density at a pressure* pj is the density at 


some reference pressure* P 0 $ q, ^ is the compressibility factor*

an average pressure,, to hold throughout the block. The density,^ 
may now be considered constant, throughout the block, and therefore 
independent of position. The density, may now be removed as a 

common factor from all terms of the general equation resulting in the equation

Schaeffer has designed an electrical circuit to increase C E

connecting a condenser already charged to the existing value of E

O perating Manual for the Potentiometric Me del* 

This model has been constructed according to the physical 
principles outlined in the previous sections of this work* The 
general theory of the circuits themselves has been outlined in 
the section dealing with the design of the model, and it will 
be assumed that the reader is familiar with this background* 

This manual proposes to discuss the details of "setting up" 
Operating, and servicing the machine, and will deal with these 
topics from the viewpoint of an investigator attempting to 
apply the model to some problem* 

I The General Description of the Model 

The model is divided physically into two major sections, 
the pool table, and the control cabinet. The pool table 
contains the "well", designed to hold a contoured model 
representing the oil reservoir; the pantograph, and the plotting 
surface, designed to transfer information from the pool to 
a recording sheet* The control cabinet contains the electronic 
circuits which are divided into five units or panels, and 
joined by inter-panel wiring* This interpanel wiring is 
brought out to terminal blocks at the rear of each unit. ihe 
terminals are numbered from left to right along the terminal 
blocks for each unit. The terminals are referred to by the 
unit initial and number. The five unit initials are,P, 0, 

C, N, and M, representing the Fower unit. Oscillator unit, 

Null Indicator unit, Control unit, and Motor Control unit* 

Thus for instance a terminal referred to as, P21, would be

number, and appear at the right of the unit diagrams. The 
terminals pertaining to the unit are in the first column, while 
the teminals on other units to which these are connected by the 
interpanel wiring are shown in the second column, to enable the 
operator to follow this wiring. A summary of these interpanel 
connections is presented in Table(CI). These terminals also 
provide convenient checking points for servicing the model and 
will be reffered to again in this connection. 

II The Circuit Diagrams. 

The detailed circuit diagrams are presented on the 
forrowlng pages, and will be discussed in order, starting with 
the lowest panel In the cabinet. 

(a) The Power Supply 

This unit Is supplied with 110 volt A.G. mains, which 
enter the cabinet through a "plug In" connection located on the 
top of the cabinet. The unswitched mains pass through the 
switch, S-I, and the main 10 ampere fuses, from which they are 
distributed to all other parts of the model. 

The first power supply provides 350 volt D.C, to the 
oscillator and driver stages of the oscillator unit, and 6.3 volt 
power to the filament circuits of these tubes. The switch 
operating this power supply Is number four on the front of the 
power supply panel.

The second power supply provides 350 volts D.C. to the 
two "push-pull" output stages. It will be noted that the 
negative return of this supply is through the centre tap of 
the filament winding of the transformer, through the current 
jack, J-l, mounted on the front of the panel, and through the 
decoupled 160 ohm bias resistor. The jack, J-l, is shunted 
to give a multiplying ratio of one hundred. Thus the current 
of approximately 160 milliamperes is read as 1.6 milliamperes 
on the current meter, 'when this meter Is plugged into the jack. 
The 160 ohm bias resistor has an adjustable tap which may be 
altered to change the bias if necessary. This resistor is 
located underneath the chassis of the power supply unit* 

The third Power Supply provides D.C. voltages of 250, 

150, 90, and 70 volts to the pool balance Null Indicator, 
together with 6*3 volt A.G. to the filaments of these tubes. 

The 150 volts is stabilized by the voltage regulator tube 
and this stabilization also opperates on the 90, and 70 v&lt 
supplies. The switch for this power supply is located on 
the front of the panel together with its fuse, and is switch 
number three on the panel. 

The fourth power supply is similar to the one just 
described, and provides power to the Potentiometer Null 
Indicator. The switch controling this power supply is 
number two on the front panel.

(b) The Oscillator Unit 

It was suggested earlier that this unit required some 
modification, that a separate gain control for the potentiometer 
was required. It is suggested that an extra triode tube be 
added to supply this requirement, in parallel with the present 
6V6 drivers. The variable frequency controls should be ganged 

together, leaving space for the extra gain control in the grid 
circuit of the new tube* The present controls are all labeled 
on the front panel together with the current jacks for the 
two oscillator tubes, the preamplifier tube, and the two driver 
tubes. 

(e) The Control Unit 

The control unit contains the bulk of the controls needed 
during the operation of the model. The front panel is divided 
into three banks or sections. The left hand bank contains 
thirty variable current control resistors, arranged in Six.; 
horizontal rows of five controls each. The top four rows 
contain the output current controls and are numbered from left 
to right along the rows from one to twenty. The lower two 
rows contain the input current controls and are numbered fa?om 
one to ten. 

The second bank of controls contains the potentiometer 
indicating dials, the potentiometer range change switch, and 
the model "function’ 1 switch. This five position gang switch 
controls the action of the model and specifically connects the 
potentiometer in the correct polarity to each of the measurement 
stations as required.

The third hank of controls contains the current selector 
switches, the potentiometer phase control, and the reference 
earth control* The current selector switches are eleveh 
position rotary switches. The top switch is the first output 
selector, and its positions are numbered from one to ten, with 
the eleventh position marked 11-20. Ihen the first switch 
is in this position, the second switch comes into use, and 
the positions of this switch are numbered from eleven to 
tw T enty, and "off". The third switch is also an eleven 
position rotary switch, and is used to select the input currents 
to be measured. 

The next control in the third bank is the potentiometer 
phase control. This control is provided with a large vernier 
dial for ease in making fine adjustments, and although not marked 
is easily identified. Beside the phase control, is mounted 
the potentiometer reference earth control used when plotting 
isopotential lines. Below the reference earth control is 
a toggle switch, mounted on the connector panel. This is the 
balance motor change over switch,, also used during the plotting 
of isopotential lines, and it is this switch which allows the 
search array to seek an isopotential line rather than a 
current line in the pool.

(&) The Null Indicator Unit 

This unit contains two null indicators, the pool balance 
and the potentiometer balance indicators. The two circuits 
are laid out and wired in such a fashion that one circuit forms 
a mirror image of the other with the centre line of the unit 
as the mirror plane. Some of the controls of this unit are 
in the form of screwdriver presets and are located at the rear 
of the chassis. It is most convenient to discuss these controls 
from the centre outwards alond the row. The two nearest the 
centre are the cathode trimmer condencers of the diffirential 
detector circuits. The third control from centre is the 
input balance control of the differential detector* fhe fourth 
control in the case of the potentiometer null indicator, is 
the phase shifter, while the fifth control is the frequency 
control. In the case of the pool null indicator, both of 
these controls are in the frequency sensitive network, and if 
it is desired to add a phase shifter to this circuit, one of 
these controls could be used. 

The controls mounted on the front of the panel are 
also arranged symmetrically, about the centre line, and will 
once more be discussed from the centre out. The first 
control is the grid shorting push button used whenever the 
plate circuit of the D.G. amplifier is being adjusted to 
balance. This push button connects the two grids together, 
ensuring that they are at the same potential. The second 
control is the plate balance control of the D.G. amplifer. 

The third control adjusts the grid bias of the phase detector 
to balance this circuit and is referred to as the grid balance

control* The final control on this panel is the null indicator 
amplifier gain control, and is referred to as the"null gain" 
control. 

The null indicator unit also contains the indicating 
instruments used in conjunction with the model. The meter 
on the left hand side is called the current meter. This 
meter is connected to the Jack mounted directly below it on 
the panel and may be inserted in any of the cathode circuits 
of the set by using the plug cord provided. In use, one 
end of this cord is plugged in to the meter Jack, and the other 
end is then plugged in to any one of the current jacks 
provided, on the front of the cabinet. The central meter 
is the high frequency voltmeter provided for the standardization 
of the voltage applied to the potentiometer circuit. 

The third meter is a monitoring instrument, by which the 
operator may check: the performance of either null indicator. 

A three position switch is provided below the meter by which 
the meter may be connected into either circuit or left 
disconnected when not in use. 

(e) The Motor Control Unit 

This unit is supplied with mains voltage, through the 
main switch of the power supply unit, and also draws D.C. 
power from the null indicator units. The A.C. mains pass 
through switches on the motor control unit, so that the 
motors may be shut off while the remainder of the circuits 
are being adjusted. The motor control unit is so designed 
that no damage will result if either of the two supplies are

connected while the other is not. The motors of course will 
not rotate unless both the iUC. and D.C* sourses are connected. 
The motor control unit has one variable control, which adjusts 
the bias of the control tubes. This control acts as a balance 
control for the motor and is set so that the motor stops 
rotating when the null meter indicates balance.

II Preparing; The Model For Operation 

'The first essential step in the application of this model 
to an oil reservoir problem, is the accumulation of all the 
available pertinent data concerning the field to be studied. 
When this has been done, the data must be converted into a 
form which the model can use. In this connection, a scale map 
of such a size, that all of the area of interest will fit within 
the space of the pool, must be constructed. This map should 
show the locations of all wells, and should show the contours 
of the variations in the permeability-depth product throughout 
the field. A transparent overlay map showing the variations 
in porosity should also be prepared using the same scale. 

A list of the flow rates of each well is also required. 

The next step is the construction of the contoured basin. 
The outer container could be made from "jig woody or some other 
non conductor, in the shape of a shallow box. The contour map 
must be transferred to the bottom of this box. It is 
suggested that the pantograph, with a stylus substituted for 
the four probe array, might be useful in this regard. 

Laminated sheets whose thickness is proportional to the contour 
interval, could then be cut to the shape of the contour lines, 
and these sheets stacked in position. The well locations would 
then be marked out and holes drilled through the stacks for the 
insertion of the electrodes. The inside of the basin should 


then be given a heavy coat of psrafin wax to make it waterproof

(a) Adjusting The Oscillator. 


There are few adjustments required for the operation 
of this unit. ¥ith the model switched on and an oscilloscope 
connected to one of the oscillator output terminals, check the 
waveform for shape. A true sine wave is required for correct 
operation * and the controls may be set too near maximum with the 
result that the output stages are overloaded and distort the 
waveform* 'The phase reference voltage should be increased 
until the current in jack* J-8, reads Between 0.5 and 1.0 
ml111amps. 

(b) Adjusting The Mill Indicator 

With the set switched on and the oscillator adjusted as 
above, depress the grid shorting push button, and check for 
balance with the balance meter. If the meter does not indicate 
balance, adjust the plate balance control until null is obtained. 
Next, with the null gain control set to zero, check for balance 
with the balance meter. If balance Is not obtained, adjust the 
grid balance control until balance Is restored. 

To balance the Input circuit, it is most convenient to 
use an oscilloscope connected between the grid of the phase 
dec tec tor tube and ground. The null gain control should be 
set at maximum for this reading. It is convenient to remove 
the Phase detector tube from its socket and insert the 
oscilloscope probe into the grig. socket. The two grids, of the 
differential detector must be shorted together and connected 
to a common sourse of 400 cycle power in order to check for 

balance.

To supply the test signal for the null input balance just described, 
a special connector lead has been provided* This lead replaces the 
one normally connecting the pool indicator to the isopotential 
probes, and is connected between the connector panel and the table. 
This lead serves the double purpose of shorting the two grids 
together and at the same time applying a common mode signal between 
the grids and ground. To balance the potentiometer null indicator 
input, this same signal can be applied to the input stage by 
plugging the pool input leads into the potentiometer input sockets 
on the top of the null indicator chassis. 

Ihen this common mode signal has been connected, the input 
balance control should be adjusted until minimum signal is shown 
on the oscilloscope. The trimmer condensers are then adjusted if 
any further adjustment is needed. Replace the phase detector 
tube and check that the circuit is still at balance as shown on the 
balance meter. If balance is not established, then the phase 
adjustment requires resetting. 

(c) Phase Adjustments On The Model 

There are two sets of signals whose phase relationship must 
be correct before the null indicators will function properly. 

The input signals to the differential detectors must be in phase, 
if the detector is to function. In the case of the pool 
indicator this phasing is automatic and requires no adjustment. 
However, the potentiometer null indicator receives its signals 
[from two different sourses and it is necessary to correct the 
phase relation between the two.

To accomplish, this phase adjustment, proceed as follows. With 
the set switched on and connected for normal operation, switch 
the function switch to the input isopotential position, and 
rotate the potentiometer range change switch fully counterclockwise. 
This will provide a large input signal to both grids of the input 
differential detector. Now, remove the mixer tube, 12AX7, from 
its socket, and connect the oscilloscope between ground and,the 
grid of this tube socket. Connect the vertical deflection 
amplifier of the oscilloscope between cathode and ground, to 
obtain the lissajous figure showing the phase relationship 
between the two voltages. It may be necessary to adjust the 
reference earth control, to obtain two signals of approximately 
the same amplitude. The potentiometer phase control is now 
adjusted until the two signals are in phase. Replace the mixer 
tube. The differential detector should now pass the true 
error signal,Ae. 

The second phase adjustment required, concerns the relation 
between the error signal, and the phase reference signal. 

To check this relationship, remove the phase detector tube 
and connect the horizontal sweep of the oscilloscope to the 
grid of this tube. Connect the vertical sweep to one of the 
rear terminals carrying the phase reference signal, and obtain the 
lissajous figure depicting the phase relation between the two signals* 
Now adjust the null indicator phase control until the two signals 
are in phase. In the case of the pool null indicator, it was 
found that a 0.5 mfd. condenser in parallel with the pool supply 
electrodes was sufficient to correct this phase relation and no 
control was provided. However this might not be the case when

a large and complex model is being examined, hence the reccomendation 
that this control be added. 

The model should now be ready for automatic operation. 

Before switching on the balance motors however, first rotate the 
four probe array, with the function switch in the gradient position. 
The balance meter should now respond readily and indicate a sharp 
null point. It is now permissable to switch on the pool motor 
and allow the four probe array to balance automatically. In regions 
of high gradient it may be necessary to turn down the null gain 
control to prevent cycling. The potentiometer shaft should also 
be rotated by hand to prove that balance exists before switching 
on the balance motor. 

(d) Adjusting the Ivlbtor Control Unit 

When the above adjustments have been made and it is possible 
to switch on the motors, The waveform of the control voltage to 
the motor should be checked. Connect the oscilloscope to the 
motor control terminal (M3, and Ivl 18) and allow the motor to 
come to balance. The bias control is now adjusted until 
minimum signal is obtained. It has been found that this setting 
is not critical and requires very little attention.

III Servicing The Model 

Any piece of electronic equipment requires attention if it 
is to function properly, Host breakdowns can be prevented if 
tiie machine is regularily ckecked over. The most obvious 
service requirement is that of cleanliness. Dust tends to 
accumulate on high voltage wiring and siiould be regularily 
removed. A small paint brush is recommended for this purpose. 
Switch contacts exposed to the atmosphere should also be cleaned 
from time to time. A camel*s hair brush dipped in carbon tetra¬ 
chloride makes a good cleaning agent. Ihile the operator is 
cleaning the set the components should be examined for external 
signs of deterioration. A resistor showing signs of overheating 
should be replaced before a burnout occurs. 

The pool unit also requires periodic cleaning, as the room 
is quite dusty and this dust collects in the electrolyte. 

Experience has shown that the pool should be drained at least 
once a week, the pool washed out and the electrodes cleaned. 
Although corrosion of these electrodes is not a major problem, 
some does occur especially near the surface of the electrolyte, 
where the dust also seems to collect. The copper search probes 
should also be cleaned, they do not appear to corrode but do 
collect dust as they are in contact with the surface of the 
liquid. It was also found necessary to filter the electrolyte 
to remove foreign bodies. This was done by forcing the electrolyte 
out of the storage vessel, with compressed air, through a filter 
and back into the cleaned tank*

If an attempt is made to calculate actual prototype transit 
times, it is necessary to keep the electrolyte conductivity 
constant and also know the value of this property. Thus it will 
he necessary to construct a conductivity cell which may be placed 
in the pool and connected between two of the pool supply terminals. 
The current through the cell may be measured by the potentiometer 
in the normal manner. It will be necessary to supply a pair of 
temporary leads from the master voltmeter to the cell, to obtain 
the applied voltage. The cell should be initially calibrated 
against a standard solution. 

The probe spacing and orientation should also be checked 
periodically. To check the spacing, press a sheet of paper 
against the tips of the probes, then check that the diagonals 
so formed, are of equal length and form a right angle. 

Also check that this spacing is the same on the plotting array. 

The orientation is most easily checked by first establishing 
the location of one line in the pool as previously described 
and making sure that the plotting array reproduces this line. 

Thermionic tubes deteriorate with time and the tubes in 
service in this model should be regular!ly checked. For this 
purpose, current jacks have been built into the set and if 
regular current readings are taken it is possible to detect and 
replace failing tubes before they cause trouble, and in any event 
rapidly locate any trouble that does occur. A set of current 
readings is presented in Table IXC, and while these are typical 
readings it should be understood that some of them are sensitive 
to changes in control settings, and a master set should be made

whenever the model is first set up and operating. Future 
readings could then be compared with this set and any 
changes should be investigated. When it is necessary 
to trace a fault in the equipment it will be found that 
most faults will produce a radical change in one or 
more of the meter readings, and when this is observed 
the faulty circuit has been located. The time spent 
in locating a fault is thus greatly reduced. 

Periodic voltage readings should also be made 
on the output terminals of the power supply panel. 

These readings should agree with the values given in 
Table Tc. Any large changes in these readings should 
be investigated, especially any large decrease in 
one of the D.C* lines, as such a decrease might be 
caused by a breakdown of one of the electrolytic 
smoothing condensers, which are operating very near 
their rated limits. In this regard it should be noted 
that these power supplies should never be switched on 
unless they are connected to a load, as with no load, 
the smoothing condensers will charge to the full peak 
voltage and will fail.

IV Tracing Faults On The iVodel. 

It has been pointed out earlier in this discussion, that 
the model has certain features built in, which facilitate the 
location of faults when they occur. The balance and current 
meters will very often be useful in locating the trouble. 

Two auxiliary test instruments are required for servicing the 
model, and these are a universal vacuum tube voltmeter and an 
oscilloscope. It is recommended that the operator become 
familiar with the operation of these instruments, as some skill 
in their use is required when operating the model. 

Any failures in the power supply circuits should be immed- 
iatly located from a check of the current and voltage readings, 
a check of the components of the faulty circuit should reveal 
the fault with little trouble. 

A failure in the oscillator unit will in most cases be 
detected by the current readings. If however these appear 
normal, it is necessary to start at the oscillator and follow the 
signal from stage to stage, until the point is reached where the 
trouble is. This tracing of the signal through the set is done 
by means of the oscilloscope. When the fault has been traced to 
a single stage, it is usually most convenient to remove the unit 
from the set and check the component values with the universal 
tester. This method should locate all but the most stubborn 
faults. 

The same general comments apply to the location of faults 
in the null indicator and motor control circuits. This general 
tracing procedure, combined with a knowledge

of what should be occurring in each circuit, will enable the 
operator to locate and repair all faults which may occur. 

If then, the model ceases to function for any reason 
the following is the general procedure to be followed* First, 
make an immediate check of all current and voltage readings. 

If this does not definitely isolate the fault, proceed with the 
general setting up procedure, until some abnormality becomes 
apparent. This abnormality will indicate which unit is at 
fault. Proceed to trace the desired signal through this 
unit from input to output until the faulty stage is located. 

The nature of the fault will usually point to some component 
in the stage as being the point of failure, however in case of 
doubt ckeck the performance of all the components associated 
with the stage until the failure is discovered.
