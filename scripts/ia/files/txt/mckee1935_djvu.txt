IN THE be nzene RING, THE PR EPARATION 
OF 5-CHL0R0 -/$ -RESORCYLIC ACID. 

INTRODUCTION. 

Ia 1922, Fabre 1 published the results of his 
study of the constitution of resorcinol and some of 
its derivatives} in which he outlined the preparation 
of two chloro-^ -resorcylic acids * 3-chloro-2,4-di¬ 
hydroxy benzoic acid, and 3-chloro-2,6-dihydroxy 
benzoic acid. He prepared the first acid by treating 
p -resorcylic acid in ethereal solution with sulfuryl 
chloride, and obtained needle-shaped crystals which 
when dried melted at 203°0. The second acid was pre¬ 
pared by refluxing 4-chlororesorcinol with potassium 
bicarbonate for one and one-half hours in water sol¬ 
ution. This compound when dried melted at 215-216°C., 
and was reported as being less soluble than the first 
acid.

Moreover, in 1926, Hemmelmeyr and Meyer in 
their study of the effect of different substituents 
on the stability of carboxyl groups in substituted 
aromatic acids, reported the preparation of a third 












- ( 2 ) - 


chloro-^ -resorcylic acid, which they called 5-chloro- 
2 ,4-dihydroxy benzoic acid* This was prepared by the 
direct chlorination of p -resorcylic acid in hot 
glacial acetic acid solution, and melted at 175°C. 

Thus the preparation of the following three 
chloro-/3 -resorcylic acids has been reported in the 
literature:

OUTLINE OF PRESENT INVESTIGATION,

It was decided to repeat the preparation of 

these three compounds and to characterize them by the 

preparation of their monoacetates according to the 

3 

method of Lesser and Gad. To characterize these 
compounds by melting points alone is not conclusive 
proof of their nature since the melting points of 
certain compounds of resorcinol are very liable to 
variation. In this regard it may be noted that a - 
resorcylic acid itself has been recorded in the lit¬ 
erature as having at least seven different melting 














.

4 

points. 

Thus a far more conclusive proof of the char¬ 
acter of these three acids would he to prepare thdir 
raonoacetates and then determine the mixed melting 
points of these acetates. This was done, and so far 
as can he determined the three acetates are the same, 
and therefore the three chloro -p -resorcylic acids are 
the same, and correspond to Remmelmeyr and Meyer 1 s 
5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxy benzoic acid, only with a 
higher melting point. 

That it is the 5-chloro-S,4-dihydroxy benzoic 
acid is shown hy the work of Lesser and Gad, who in 
their investigation of the acetylation of aromatic 
hydroxycarhoxylic acids showed that aromatic hydroxy- 
carboxylic acids which do not contain the hydroxyl 
group in ortho position to the carboxyl radical are 
readily and quantitatively acetylated by the addition 
of a slight excess of acetic anhydride to the acid 
dissolved in aqueous alkali. Thus it can he concluded 
from the formation of a monoacetate in the case where 
the acid is prepared from the action of potassium 










- ( 4 ) - 

bicarbonate on 4-chlororesorcinol, that the carboxyl 


group in that acid must be in ortho and para position 
with respect to the two hydroxyl groux^s, and con¬ 
sequently, since all the acids are identical:

Mixed melting point determinations were run 
on equal mixtures of samples from methods (1) and ( 2 ), 
(1) and (3), (2) and (3), and finally (1), (2), and (3), 
and in no case was there any depression of the melting 
point recorded. Therefore it can be concluded from the 
above work that the three acids are identical, and 






































- ( 10 ) - 


that it is the 5-chloro-S,4-dihydroxy benzoic acid 
which has been prepared in each case. 

SUMMARY. 

The preparation of 5-chloro-S,4-dihydroxy 
benzoic acid by three different methods has been 
described and the identical nature of the three acids 
obtained has been discussed. 

rlOTKj- 

In connection with this investigation, the 
monoacetates of monobromo- and dibromc-, monoiodo- 
and diiodo-, and monochioro- and dichloro-^ -resorcylic 
acid were prepared in an attempt to determine whether 
all these monoacetates could be used for character¬ 
ization purposes. Repeated recrystallization of the 
monoacetates was carried out in each case until they 
had constant melting points, but only in the case of 
the monohalogenated compounds did the monoacetates 
give the same melting point over a series of two or 
more preparations, as can be seen from the accompany¬ 
ing table. 












-(H)- 


This fact would seem to show that there is 
some limitation to the use of melting points of the 
monoacetates, as prepared by the method of Lesser and 
Gad, for characterization purposes, in the case of 
dihalogenated derivatives of p -resorcylic acid. An 
analysis was run on all of the monoacetates, and they 
showed in every instance the correct halogen content. 

It is possible that this apparent discrepancy 
in the case of the dihalogenated compounds can be 
explained by the fact that the dihalogenated compounds 
are much more unstable than the monohalogenated com¬ 
pounds, losing carbon dioxide much more readily on 
being boiled with water. Kharasch, Reinmuth, and Mayo 
have pointed out that dibromo-yS -resorcylic acid 
loses 84.7$ carbon dioxide on boiling in water for 
one hour, whereas the rnonobromo-^ -resorcylic acid 
loses only 19.0$ carbon dioxide on boiling in water 
for the same length of time. They also state that p - 
resorcylic acid itself loses 49.1$ carbon dioxide on 
boiling in water for one hour, hence we arrive at the 


conclusion that one halogen substituent in the S —res-

orcylic acid molecule tends to stabilise the carboxyl 
group, while two halogen substituents tend to make the 
carboxyl group more unstable. In a series of prepar¬ 
ations of the dibromo-/ 6 -resorcylic acid therefore, 
it would be barely possible to get a monoacetate with 
a constant melting point when the parent substance can 
be decomposed so readily. Similar circumstances exist 
in the case of the diiodo- and the dichloro- deriv¬ 
atives. There is reason to believe however, that the 
ease of decomposition of these dihalogenated deriv¬ 
atives is not the whole cause of the variation of the 
melting points of the monoacetates, but that the pro¬ 
blem is much more complex.

STUDIES IM THE STRU CTUR E OF SOME FLUO RESCE IN 
COM POUNDS♦ 

INTRODUCTION. 

The compound fluorescein was first prepared by 
9 

Baeyer in 1376 during his investigation of the com¬ 
pounds resulting from the reaction of phthalic acid 
with different phenols. In this work he reported the 
preparation of a dibromofluorescein, which he prepared 
by the direct bromination of fluorescein in glacial 
acetic acid solution, using two moles of bromine to 
one of fluorescein* Baeyer did not give a structural 
formula for his dibromofluorescein, but reported it as 
forming compact reddish-brown needles with a deep green 
reflection, having a melting point of 260-270°C. On 
refluxing with acetic anhydride this compound gave a 
diacetate crystallising in colorless needles, which 
melted at 203-21Q°C. Phillips says that it is doubt¬ 
ful if this dibromofluorescein was a pure compound, or 
indeed any dibromofluorescein prepared in this manner 














- ( 19 ) - 


in the presence of solvents. 

Heller and Meyer, 11 in 1909, stated that 
Eaeyer's asymmetric dibromofluorescein could test be 
prepared by heating a mixture of dibromodihydroxyben- 
zoylbenzoic acid and resorcinol in molecular proport¬ 
ions with zinc chloride at 170®C. This compound cryst¬ 
allized from alcohol in dark red prisms with solvent of 
crystallisation, and was reported as melting at 300°C. 
The diacetate crystallized from toleene with solvent 

of crystallization in plates melting at 173°C. with 

IP 

decomposition. Orndorff and Hemmer, in 1927, were 
the first investigators to report the preparation of 
pure dibromofluorescein, which they prepared by fract¬ 
ional crystallization and hydrolysis of the dibenzoate, 
and which had a melting point of 280-290°C. with de¬ 
composition. They gave as the structure of this 


compound: 



C OQH

believing that fluorescein can exist in two forms, the 
yellow lactoid form and the red quinoid form, and that 
the colored dibromofluorescein is a derivative of the 
quinoid fluorescein. The dibenzoate of this dibromo¬ 
fluorescein was prepared and was found to melt at 239- 
240°C. It was colorless and was a derivative of the 
lactoid fluorescein. No diacetate was reported. 

Phillips, mentioned above, in 1932 outlined 
the preparation of a pure dibromofluorescein which he 
prepared by the action of bromine on fluorescein in 
80^ acetic acid solution, and which gave a melting 
point of 285°C. He found that bromination as carried 
out by Baeyer leads to variable mixtures of dibromo¬ 
fluorescein hydrobromide and fluorescein, and pure 
dibromofluorescein hydrobromide could not be obtained. 
However, with the use of QQ% acetic acid as solvent, 
he obtained an 35 - BBt yield of the dibromofluorescein 
hydrobromide, from which, by the action of hot water 
to quantitatively remove the combined hydrogen bromide, 
pure dibromofluorescein was obtained. This compound 








( 









- ( Si ) - 


gave a diacetate which crystallized from acetic anhyd- 
dride or nitrobenzene in plates and had a melting point 
of 211°C. 

In the older textbooks on organic chemistry, 
the structural formula of dibromofluorescein was written 
with the bromine atoms in the 2,7 positions as follows: 



This would seem to be the most probable structure for 
dibromofluorescein, but in recent years the structure 
has been altered so that the bromine atoms go into the 
4,5 positions in the fluorescein molecule, as follows: 


Sr 



o H 


It has been thoroughly established, according 





































: e 













- ( 22 ) - 


to Hewitt and Woodforde, that the 4,5 positions in 

the fluorescein molecule are invariably the first in 

which substitution occurs. They carried out an alkali 

fusion on dinitrofluorescein and obtained 2-nitro- 

14 

resorcinol, similar to that obtained by Matras, thus 

showing that the substitution of the nitro groups takes 

place at the 4,5 positions in the fluorescein molecule. 

They further prepared 2,7-dibromo~4,5-dinitrofluorescein 

by brominating dinitrofluorescein, and also 4,5-dibromo- 

2,7-dinitrofluorescein by the nitration of dibromo- 

fluorescein, and found these two compounds to be 

15 

isomers* Holmes, Melin, and Peterson have carried 
this work further and have determined the absorption 
spectra of the two isomeric dibrornodinitrofluoresceins 
and have found these to be different* Though these 
compounds are admittedly dissimilar, the positions 
of the substituent groups is determined from the results 
of the alkali fusions, only, and it is not believed 
that this evidence is conclusive as to the positions 
of the substituent groups.

OUTLINE of pr esent investigation . 

It would seem to be desirable from the above 
discussion therefore, to attempt to prove definitely 
whether the substitution of the bromine atoms in di- 
bromofluorescein takes place in the 4,5 positions or 
in the 2,7 positions, and this was one of the main 
objectives of this research. It would also be desirable 
to know, if possible, what was the underlying cause of 
such widely divergent results obtained by different 
workers in the preparation of dibromofluorescein. This 
work on the structure of dibromofluorescein is of 
fundamental importance, because of the marked and pro¬ 
mising bactericidal properties of some of its deriv¬ 
atives, especially mercurcchrome, which is a mercurated 
derivative of dibromofluorescein. It would be advan¬ 
tageous also to know whether there was only one dibromo¬ 
fluorescein, in which the bromine atoms were in the 
4,5 positions, or whether there existed as well, an 
isomer, in which the bromine atoms were in the 2,7 
positions, and hence to be able to determine the relative 
bactericidal action of the two isomers. 













- ( 24 ) - 


The problem was attacked first by an attempt 
to prepare pure dibromofluorescein from 4-bromoresorc- 
inol. If the dibromo compound could be prepared this 
way, we would be sure that the bromine atoms were in 
the 2,7 positions in the fluorescein molecule, and from 
a comparison of the absorption spectra of this compound 
with the absorption spectra of the dibromofluorescein 
prepared by the direct bromination of fluorescein, it 
would be possible to tell whether the two compounds 
were the same or were isomers of one another. If they 
were the same, then the fact stated by Hewitt and 
Woodforde that substitution takes place primarily in 
the 4,5 positions in the fluorescein molecule would 
be disproved. If they were different, then it would be 
necessary to determine the physical and chemical prop¬ 
erties of the new isomer, the 2,7-dibromofluorescein. 

To carry out this work, it was first necessary 

to prepare 4-bromorescrcinol. A method of preparation 

has been developed in this laboratory which is essent- 

16 

ially a modification of that described in Beilstein. 


Other methods 


17 


have been outlined for the preparation 










- C 25 ) - 


of 4-bromoresorcinol, but these lack simplicity and 
seem to have led to varying degrees of success. The 
method to be described give a good yield of practic¬ 
ally pure 4-bromoresorcinol, and eliminates much of 
the detail of other procedures. 

It is known that if resorcinol is brominated 
directly, the bromine atoms will go Into the resorcinol 
molecule in the 2,4,6 positions as follows: 




to give tribromcresorcinol. However, if a carboxyl 
group is first substituted in the ortho para position 
with respect to the two hydroxyl groups, on bromination 
with the calculated quantity of bromine, the 5-bromo- 
2,4-dihdroxy benzoic acid is obtained, and possibly 
some of the 3,5-dibromo-2,4~dihydroxy benzoic acid. 

This latter compound can be readily removed by boiling 
in water for one hour when the dibromo compound is 
practically all decomposed into dibromoresorcinol 













- ( 26 ) - 


which is very soluble in cold water* The monobromo 
dihydroxy benzoic acid is then further refluxed for 
twenty-four hours with water to remove the carboxyl 
group, leaving the 4-bromoresorcinol which is also 
soluble in water. This 4-bromoresorcinol is extracted 
twice with ether and the ether evaporated to give a 
compound melting at 100-2°C. In some cases a compound 
is obtained from the evaporation which has a melting 
point ranging from 72 - 95°C., but this can be changed, 
by dissolving in hot chloroform and evaporating off 
the chloroform, into the compound melting at 100 - 2 ° 0 . 
This latter process is not believed to be a purific¬ 
ation, although if necessary the 4 -bromoresorcinol can 
be recrystallized from chloroform, but with a large 
loss in yield* 

The reactions involved in the above preparation 
are as follows:

To prepare dibromofiuorescein from this 4-bromo- 
resorcinol two moles of the 4-bromoresorcinol were fused 
with one mole of phthalic anhydride at a temperature of 
190°C. in the presence of anhydrous zinc chloride, until 
the mass was hard and glassy. The fusion product was 
ground, dissolved in sodium bicarbonate, filtered, and 
acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid, to give the 
dibromofluorescein. The reaction is as follows: 


8r 




So far the attempts at the preparation of di~ 
bromofluorescein by this method have met with poor 
success. It is obviously necessary to obtain a very 








































- ( 28 ) - 


pure compound before the spectrophotometer can be used, 
and as yet it has not been possible to obtain a pure 
dibromofluorescein by this method, so the deciding evid¬ 
ence of the absorption spectra cannot be obtained. It 
was thought possible that the poor results Yfere due to 
the use of too low a temperature for the fusion with 
phthalic anhydride and the resulting formation of an 
intermediate monobromodihydroxybenzoylbenzoic acid 
as follows: 




However, a fusion was carried out using a higher temp¬ 
erature (about S10°C.) and the results were the same 
as in the previous case. It was also thought possible 
that the time of fusion was too short, but it was found 
that increasing the time likewise had no effect on the 


product. 




















- ( 29 ) - 


The problem has been attacked therefore from a 
different viewpoint, and it has been found necessary 
to rely on the results of alkali fusions far more than 
would have been desired. Pure dibromofluorescein has 
been £) r ep&red by Phillip’s method and also by a method 
making use of an oxonium salt formation. Phillips re¬ 
ported the preparation of dibromofluorescein by the 
addition of the calculated quantity of bromine to 
fluorescein in 30$ acetic acid as solvent, but it was 
found that unless the bromine solution was added pract¬ 
ically instantaneously the resulting product did not 
possess the correct melting point. If the bromine was 
added slowly, the melting point was lowered, and the 
derivatives prepared, such as the diacetate and the 
dibenzoate, did not give constant values for melting 
points or for analysis. However, when the bromine was 
added rapidly, which seemed contrary to the best pro¬ 
cedure, a pure dibromofluorescein was obtained melting 
at 283—235*0. Further difficulty was encountered in the 
preparation of the diacetate of this compound. A di- 
acfetate was obtained from the above dibromofluorescein 




















































* 




■ 






































- ' ( 30 ) - 


that melted at 229°C., which checked with the melting 
point of the diacetate from the oxonium salt prepar¬ 
ation to he described, but which did not check with 
Phillips' reported diacetate, which melted at 211 P C. 

It is believed that Phillips failed to recrystallize 
his diacetate enough, since he reported using acetic 
anhydride as the solvent, and acetic anhydride is much 
too good a solvent, even in the cold, to be used for 
many recrystallizations. 

Dibromofluorescein was also prepared by a 
method making use of the formation of an oxonium salt 

of fluorescein, then brominating with the calculated 

19 

quantity of bromine. Fischer and Eollemann have 
reported the preparation of oxonium salts of fluorescein 
by adding alcohol to a heated mixture of powdered 
fluoresceifi and concentrated hydrochloric acid, or by 
passing hydrogen chloride into an ethereal solution 
of fluorescein. In the present preparation, a modific¬ 
ation of the former method was used, in which the 
fluorescein was completely brought into solution in 
glacial acetic acid and concentrated hydrochloric acid

before bromination. This formed a clear yellow solution 
of the oxonium salt of fluorescein, with a structure 
as follows: H m 




\/ 


Bromination was then carried out slowly with the calc¬ 
ulated amount of bromine, and when the reaction was 
about half complete, the solution became turbid with 
the formation of a red precipitate, which was the 
oxonium salt of dibromofluorescein. Oxonium salts are 
unstable and easily hydrolysed, so the salt was filt¬ 
ered off and boiled with -a large quantity of water to 
hydrolyse it, then filtered off again and washed thor¬ 
oughly with hot water to obtain the dibromofluorescein. 
This compound gave a diacetate which was exactly sim¬ 


ilar. to the diacetate obtained from the direct bromin— 
ation of fluorescein, and which gave on analysis the 


















- ( 32 ) - 


correct bromine content. The diacetate was hydrolysed 
with 85 % sulfuric acid, poured into water, filtered, 
and washed thoroughly with hot water to give a pure 
dibroinofluorescein melting sharply at 285*C. 

Alkali fusions were carried out on these 
dibromofluoresceins using a modification of Hewitt and 
Woodforde's method, to determine whether a monobromo 
resorcinol could be isolated from the fusion products. 
The reaction is: * 



Dibromofluorescein from the preparation using 


the method of Phillips, for example, was dissolved in 
50% sodium hydroxide solution and refluxed for two hours. 
The reaction product was acidified with hydrochloric 
acid, extracted with benzene, and the benzene evaporated. 


It was found that the residue sublimed to some extent 


























- ( 33 ) - 

even at room temperature, so the substance was sublimed 
on a hot-plate and condensed and recovered on the inside 
of a large beaker. This substance was very pure, was 
in the form of long needles, and had a melting point 
of 102♦5°G. Grace Potter Rice ^ in some work which she 
undertook on the orientation of the bromine atom in 
braiso—dime thoxy benzoic acid, reports 2-bromoresorcinol 
as long needles having a melting point of 3.02.5°C., 
and further reports a mixture of 2-bromoresorcinol and 
4-bromoresorcinol melting at 65 - 82®C. A mixed melting 
point was run on a 50^ mixture of 4-bromoresorcinol, 
which had been previously prepared, with the unknown 
bromoresorcinol obtained from the sodium fusion, and 
this gave a melting point of 74-92°C. 

From this it can be concluded that the fusion 
product must be 2-bromoresorcinol, and hence the di- 
brornofluorescein prepared from the above procedures 
must have the bromine atoms in the 4,5 positions in 
the fluorescein,molecule, in accord with the newer 
structure advanced for dibromofluorescein, and confirm¬ 
ing the work of Hewitt and Woodforde. An alkali fusion

- ( 34 ) - 

was run on some 4-bromoresorcinol in the same manner 
to make sure there was no rearrangement to form the 
2-bromoresorcinol during the fusion, but no change 
could be detected. This is as far as the results of 
the alkali fusion will lead us, and we are forced to 
accept, like Hewitt and Woodforde, the evidence of the 
alkali fusion, to tell us in which position the bromine 
atoms are situated in the fluorescein molecule. Further 
work will be carried on in an attempt to prepare a 
dibromofluorescein in which the bromine atoms are in 
the 2,7 positions, if this compound can be prepared. 


EXPERI MENTAL PART. 

(1) PREPARATION OF 4-BR0M0PES 0 RCIN0L; 

The purpose here was to develop a simple reliable 
method for the preparation of 4-bromoresorcinol, elim¬ 
inating the involved technique of previous methods, add 
at the same time to evolve a method which would give 
uniform results and a pufe rjroduct. Several trial rmns

were made which have been tabled below, and the pro¬ 
cedure outlined below was the outcome of the results 
of these trial runs. The preparation of this compound 
can properly be divided into two parts: (a) the form¬ 
ation of 5-bromo-2,4-dihydroxy benzoic acid, and (b) 
the removal of carbon dioxide to give 4-bromoresorcinol. 

(a) The Preparation of 5-bromo-2,4-dilfdroxy 
benzoic acid: 

The procedure of the trial runs in general 

21 

was briefly as follows: Z 9 -resorcylic acid was dis¬ 
solved in a solvent and then brominated by adding 
bromine dissolved in the same solvent. The reaction 
product was poured into water, cooled, filtered, and 
dried. Finally, the crude product was boiled for one 
hour to decompose any dibromo compound that may have 
formed, filtered, and dried.

From the above results it was concluded that 
glacial acetic acid was the best solvent for the brom- 
ination, that the reaction product should be poured 
into a large excess of water, and that charcoal should 
not be used to remove color because it materially 
reduces the yield. 

(b) The Preparation of 4-bromoresorcinol: 

The procedure of the trial runs in general was 
briefly as follows: The 5-bromo— 2, 4-dihydroxy benzoic 

acid was boiled for twenty-four hours with different 
amounts of water, cooled, and filtered. Dilute sulfuric 
acid was added, then the solution was extracted three 
times with ether, the ether portion washed with dilute 
ammonium carbonate, the ether portion separated, and 
the ether finally evaporated to yield the 4-bromo- 
resorcinol. 

( See Table (3) for results of trial runs.)

It was 

found in 

the above runs 

that the time 


of refluxing could not be shortened, as a mixture of 
the monobromo f 3 -resorcylic acid and 4—bromoresorcinol 
resulted which gave an impure product* In another run 
the ether portions from the three extractions were 
evaporated separately, and it was found that the yield 























- ( 39 ) - 

from the third extraction was practically nothing, so 
the third extraction was omitted as being of no value* 
Omitting the addition of sulfuric acid and also the 
washing with ammonium carbonate solution did not have 
any harmful effect on the purity of the product obtain¬ 
ed* Twelve and one-half times the quantity of monobromo 
Z 3 -resorcylic acid used was found to be the optimum 

quantity of water to use for refluxing. Davis and 
ES 

Harrington have reported that they could only obtain 
a 20$ yield of 4-bromoresorciaol on boiling 5-brorao- 
2,4-dihydroxy benzoic acid with water for tventy-four 
hours, but we have had no difficulty in obtaining 90^ 
yields of the pure 4-bromoresorcinol by our method. 

Prom the results of the trial experiments above, 
a detailed procedure for the preparation of 4-bromo- 
resorcinol can now be set up, which is simple, reliable, 
and which yields a pure product. It is as follows: 

In a 1 litre Erlenmeyer flask fitted with a 
dropping funnel and mechanical stirrer 46.2 g. (.3 mole) 
Z 6 -resorcylic acid is dissolved in 300 cc. of glacial 
acetic acid by gently warming and stirring. 43. g. of

bromine is dissolved in 240 cc. of glacial acetic acid 
and placed in the dropping fuBmel. With vigorous stir¬ 
ring the bromine solution is allowed to drop very slow¬ 
ly into the Z 3 -resorcylic acid solution, the reaction 
taking place over one hour. The reaction mixture is 
poured into five litres of water and allowed to stand 
in the ice-chest one hour or longer* The monobromo 
Z 3 -resorcylic acid is filtered off a&d dried. Crude 
yield is 54 - 60 g. (77 - 35 per cent of the theor¬ 
etical amount.) 

The crude product is refluxed for one hour 
with 1500 cc. of water, hot filtered, cooled in an 
ice-chest, and the purified product filtered off and 
dried. The yield is 40 - 44 g. (57 - 63 per cent of 
the theoretical amount.) Melting point is 203-206°C. 
(uncorr.), of the air-dried material. 

Thirty g. of pure monobromo -resorcylic acid 
is refluxed for twenty-four hours with 375 cc. of water, 
and filtered. The solution is then extracted twice with 
ether using 200 and 100 cc. portions respectively. The 
ether portion is evaporated and the monobromo resorcinol

A great many runs have been made using this 
procedure, in order to check its reliability, and at 
the same time to obtain a good supply of 4-bromorescrc- 
inol for future vrork. The results of these runs are

preparation of dichlorofluorescein. 7.3 g. of phthalic

an oil-bath. 5. g. of anhydrous zinc chloride, finely

of about ten minutes. The temperature was then raised 
to 180°C. and maintained for two and one-half hours. 

After cooling, the reaction product was ground and then 
boiled for twenty minutes in dilute hydrochloric acid 
( 10 cc. cone, acid to S00 cc. water) and filtered. The 
precipitate was dissolved at room temperature in 3S00 cc.

of fluorescein. 16.4 g. of phthalic anhydride, 42. g. 
of 4-bromoresorcinol, and 10. g. of anhydrous zinc 
chloride were used in this case and the yield was 23 g. 
The diacetate was prepared as in (a) by refluxing 23 g. 
of the dibroraofluorescein with 125 cc. af acetic an¬ 
hydride and four drops of sulfuric acid for one hour, 
then pouring into water to precipitate the diacetate. 
This had a melting point of 122-212°C. after recryst¬ 
allizing twice for acetic anhydride, and was likewise 
very unsatisfactory. It was found after solubility 
tests that 1-4 dioxane was a good solvent for the di¬ 
acetate, so the diacetate above was recrystallized 
eight times from 1-4 dioxane until it had a constant 
melting point. The diacetate was dissolved in the min¬ 
imum amount of hot 1-4 dioxane and filtered. The filt¬ 
rate was heated again to boiling and water was added 
until the first turbidity developed. It was cooled and

acetate which is calculated to he 16.17, and hence 

suggests the possibility of a monobromo compound being 

VJltVl 

formed in the fusion^phthalic anhydride. 

(c) Dibromofluorescein was next prepared using 

exactly the same procedure as in (b) except that the 
time of fusion was increased from two and one-half 
hours to six and one-half hours. 66.5 g. of phthalic 
anhydride, 170 g. of 4-bromoresorcinol, and 35 g. of 
anhydrous zinc chloride were used in this preparation 
and the yield was 75 g. 

A diacetate of this compound was prepared by 
refluxing 20 g. of the material with 125 cc. of acetic 
anhydride for six and one-half hours. The reaction 
product was poured into an excess of ethyl alcohol and 
the diacetate crystallized out. It was filtered off and

dried, and had a melting point of 194-109°C. The di- 
acetate was recrystallized from 1-4 dioxane as in (b) 
but a constant melting point could not be obtained, 
the final melting point being 202-210°C. 

A dibenzoate of this dibromofluorescein was 
also prepared by refluxing 20 g. of the material with 
125 cc. of benzoyl chloride for five hours. The reaction 
product was poured into an excess of ethyl alcohol and 
a gummy black precipitate settled out. This was filt¬ 
ered off and the filtrate was evaporated to small volume 
when the dibenzoate crystallized out. The melting point 
of this dibenzoate was 224-234°C. On recrystallization 
from benzene, a compound melting at 272-273°C. was 
obtained, which suggested a tetrabromofluorescein 
dibenzoate having been formed. 

(d) Dibromofluorescein was finally prepared from 

4-bromoresorcinol using the same procedure as in (b) 
except that the temperature was held at 210°C. through¬ 
out, and the time of fusion was increased to four hours. 
7.3 g. of phthalic anhydride, 20 g. of 4-bromoresorc- 
inol, and 5 g. of anhydrous zinc chloride were used

in this run and the yield was 10 g. 

A diacetate was prepared as in (c) and had 
a melting point of 193-207°C. after two recrystalliz¬ 
ations from acetic anhydride and excess ethyl alcohol. 

Fr om d irect hromin ation of fluorescein: 

(a) 60.5 g. of fluorescein was placed in 240 cc. 

of 30$ acetic acid and warmed to 80°C. 58.7 g. of 

bromine was dissolved in 195 cc. of 80$ acetic acid 
and was added drop by drop to the fluorescein solution, 
with vigorous stirring. The stirring was continued for 
two hours after the reaction was complete, then the 
dibromofluorescein was filtered off and washed thor¬ 
oughly with hot water. It had a melting point when 
dried of 260-264*0. 

A diacetate of this dibromofluorescein was 
prepared by refluxing 20 g. of the material with 125 cc. 
of acetic anhydride for six and one-half hours. The 
reaction product was poured into an excess of ethyl 
alcohol and the diacetate crystallized out. It was 











































- ( 48 ) - 


filtered off and dried and had a melting point of 
207-209°C. The diacetate was recrystallized hy dissolv¬ 
ing in the least amount of acetic anhydride, filtering, 
and pouring into an excess of ethyl alcohol, but a 
constant melting point could not be obtained. The final 
melting point was about 270°C. which suggests again 
that a tetrabromofluorescein diacetate has probably 
been formed. 

A dibenzoate of this dibromofluorescein was 
also prepared by refluxing 20 g. of the material with 
125 cc. of benzoyl chloride for five hours. The reaction 
product was poured into an excess of ethyl alcohol and 
the dibenzoate crystallized out oh standing. The melt¬ 
ing point of this dibenzoate was 228-233°C. On recryst¬ 
allizing from benzene, a dibenzoate was obtained which 
melted at 238-233,5°C., which checked with &he melting 
point of the dibenzoate of dibromofluorescein obtained 
by Orndorff and Hemmer. 

(b) Dibromofluorescein was prepared in exactly 

the same manner as in (a) except that the bromine sol¬ 
ution was added all at once instead of drop by drop.

This procedure gave a compound which melted at 283—285°C. 

A diacetate of this compound was prepared by 
refluxing 10 g. of the material with 125 cc. of acetic 
anhydride for six hours. The reaction product was poured 
into an excess of ethyl alcohol and the diacetate sep¬ 
arated out. This diacetate when recrystallized three 
times from acetic anhydride and ethyl alcohol gave a 
constant melting point of 223-229°C. 

From bro min_atj.cn of oxo nium_s_alt_of_ Fluoresce in j 
(a) Ten g. of fluorescein was completely brought 

into solution in hat glacial acetic acid and concentrat¬ 
ed hydrochloric acid. 9.6 g. of bromine, in solution 
in 80 cc. of glacial acetic acid, was added drop by 
drop with vigorous stirring to the hot solution. The 
oxonium salt was filtered off and boiled for fifteen 
minutes with three litres of water to hydrolyse it, then 
it was filtered and washed thoroughly with hot water. 

The dibromofluorescein obtained was dried in the oven 
overnight and had a melting point of 283-291 C. The 
yield was 12 g.

A diacetate of this compound was prepared by 
refluxing 12 g. of the material with 125 cc. of acetic 
anhydride for six hours. The reaction product was 
poured into an excess of ethyl alcohol and the diacet¬ 
ate separated out. The diacetate when recrystallized 
four times from acetic anhydride and ethyl alcohol gave 

a constant melting point of 828-229°C.

A mixed melting point was run on a 50$ mixture 
of this diacetate with the diacetate melting at 223-229 
obtained from the direct bromination of fluorescein 
above, and no change could be detected. 

(b) The procedure in (a) was repeated using 20 g. 

of fluorescein and 19.2 g. of bromine to give a yield 
of 30 g. of dibromofluorescein melting at 273-230°C. 

The diacetate was prepared, which after three recryst- 
allizaticns from acetic anhydride and ethyl alcohol 
gave a melting point of 227-223°C. The yield of the 
diacetate was 17 g. The diacdtate was then hydrolysed

by placing it in 400 cc. of 35$ sulfuric acid solution 
and heating on a water-bath for one and three-quarter 
hours. The solution was then poured into two litres of 
water, boiled for fifteen minutes, filtered, and thor¬ 
oughly washed with hot water. The dibromofluorescein 
obtained when dried overnight in the oven gave a melt¬ 
ing point of 285°C. 

( 5) ALKALI FUSIONS; 

Ten g. of dibromofluorescein from the direct 
bromination of fluorescein according to Phillips* 
method was refluxed for two hours with 40 g. of 50$ 
sodium hydroxide solution. The color of the reaction 
mixture changed from a deep red to a dirty green. 300 cc. 
of water was added and the solution was acidified with 
hydrochloric acid. The solution was filtered twice by 
ordinary filtration and the filtrate was extracted three 
times with benzene, using three 100 cc. portions. The 
benzene was allowed to evaporate at room temperature, 
and the residue was sublimed on a hot-plate and recov¬ 
ered on the inside of a large beaker . The compound 

























- ( 52 ) - 


took the fora of long needles with a melting point of 
102-102.5°C. 

A mixed melting point was run on a 50^ mixture 
of this fusion product and 4-bromoresorcinol (melting 
point 1C1°C.) previously prepared, and was found to 
he 72-94°C. This led to the conclusion that 2-bromo- 
resorcinol is the fusion product which was obtained. 

The procedure was repeated three times, and 
the results in every case proved to be the same. 


MOTS 

All melting points in PART (2) of this thesis 
are uncorrected as reported, as this seems to be the 
customary procedure in the literature for this type 


of work.

S UMMARY. 

1. The preparation of dibromofluorescein is best 
carried out by a method making use of the bromination 
of an oxonium salt of fluorescein. 

2. A diacetate of dibromofluorescein, melting at 
223-22S°C., has been prepared. 

3 . Alkali fusions have shown that the bromine 
atoms in dibromofluorescein are undoubtedly in the 
4,5 positions in the fluorescein molecule*
