THE EFFECTS OF AMMONIUM PHOSPHATE AND BORON ON 
ALFALFA ( MEDICAGO SATIVA L.) SEED 
PRODUCTION AND VEGETATIVE GROWTH 


John W. Hall 


INTRODUCTION 


Alfalfa seed production in the prairie provinces has 
always been very uncertain. The resulting scarcity of seed 
has, to a large extent, limited a more extensive use of alfalfa 
as a hay and pasture crop. The rapid expansion of mixed farm¬ 
ing in the parkland area of Alberta has increased the demand 
for good legumes that produce a large amount of forage and, at 
the same time, are hardy enough to withstand the severe winters* 
Alfalfa in the black soil region produces an abundance 
of vegetative growth and very little seed. The gray wooded soil 
zone offers the most satisfactory soil and climatic conditions 
for alfalfa seed production in Alberta. Up to the present, 
however, alfalfa seed yields on the gray wooded soils have been 
too low to make seed production economically possible. 

Experimental results have shown that crops on the 
gray wooded soil make the most satisfactory growth when sulphur 
is applied to the soil (38).

In many districts in Canada and the United States the 
production of alfalfa hay and seed has been greatly increased 
and the possibility of a seed crop failure greatly reduced by 
the application of a small amount of boron to the soil. 

It was thought that boron might possibly be a limit¬ 
ing factor in alfalfa production in Alberta and that, combined 
with an efficient fertilizer, it might increase the hay and 
seed yield of alfalfa on the gray wooded soil. 

Experiments were conducted in the field on gray 
wooded soil and also in the greenhouse on both gray wooded soil 
and sand cultures. For this reason the paper is reported in 
two sections, Part I dealing with the field experiments and 
Part II with the greenhouse experiments.

PART I 


FIELD EXPERIMENTS 


Many aspects of seed setting in alfalfa have been 
studied in an effort to determine the factors responsible for 
the great variation in alfalfa seed production. These experi¬ 
ments were designed to study the application of various amounts 
of boron on alfalfa grown on gray wooded soil at two levels of 
fertility. 

LITERATURE REVIEYY 


A review of literature dealing with factors other 
than nutrition that affect alfalfa seed setting in the prairie 
provinces is included here to give a better idea of the com- 
plexity of the problem. 

R. P. Knowles (17), working at the University of 
Saskatchewan, found that in the White Fox area of Saskatchewan 
the leaf-cutter bee ( Megachile spp.) was the most important 
alfalfa-tripping insect* He found a significant correlation 
between the prevalence of these bees and the amount of seed 
setting. High temperatures increased tripping. Most of the 
automatic tripping occurred from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Gross- 
pollination produced more seeds per flower tripped than self-

pollination. A great variation in seed setting among plants of 
the same strain was also evident. 

Lejeune and Olson (18), Silversides and Olson (34), 
and Jones and Olson (15) studied many factors in an attempt to 
increase seed setting. They found that tripping was necessary 
for satisfactory seed production and that bumble-bees tripped 
practically all flowers visited, while honey bees tripped very 
few. Mechanical devices increased the number of flowers tripped 
but decreased seed setting owing to injury to flowers. Cross¬ 
pollination proved superior to self-pollination. 

Sexsmith and Fryer (32) studied the effect of the 
seasonal age of the plant on the viability of pollen. They 
determined that temperature and humidity as well as the time of 
season had no significant effect on pollen viability. The same 
workers (33) reported a linear relationship between pollen- 
tube growth and temperature, the length increasing as the 
temperature increased from 70°F. to 1Q0°F. Clarke and Fryer 
(4) found that artificial tripping increased seed setting, but 
that less than half of the flowers tripped set seed. Although 
the per cent of sterile pollen was the same for different flowers 
of the same plant, it varied greatly among different plants from 
the same strain, but not for the same plant from year to year. 

Wyatt, Newton, and Ignatieff (38) applied different 
fertilizers to the gray wooded soils in Alberta. On a five- 
year average alfalfa hay increases from fertilizers not containing 
sulphur varied from 529 to 1054 pounds per acre, while increases

from fertilizers containing sulphur were from 3165 to 3681 
pounds per acre. Another experiment with fertilizers applied to 
alfalfa on the gray wooded soils, reported by White (37), showed 
that ammonium phosphate which contained 14$ sulphur was superior 
for alfalfa hay and seed production to other fertilizers not con¬ 
taining sulphur. The yield of alfalfa seed in this experiment 
was, however, too low to make seed production economical. 

The application of sulphur to the soil has also pro¬ 
duced increases in alfalfa in parts of the United States. 

Powers (27), at the Oregon Experiment Station, obtained strik¬ 
ing increases in the yield of alfalfa by the application of 
sulphur. Soils of the northwestern states that responded best 
to sulphur were the residual, calcareous, and basaltic lands. 
Optimum growth of alfalfa was obtained when the concentration 
of sulphur in the soil solution was 15 to 30 p.p.m. during 
the first three weeks of growth and 8 to 15 p.p.m. during the 
next three weeks. Changing the reaction of arid soils from 
faint alkalinity to faint acidity by sulphur additions resulted 
in an increase in concentration of potassium, calcium, and 
magnesium bases in the soil solution. The application of sul¬ 
phur increased the drought resistance of alfalfa. This was 
credited, in part, to a better,floculated condition of the soil 
resulting from an increase in water-soluble calcium. The 
addition of sulphur to the soil also increased the chlorophyll 
content of alfalfa by 18$. Powers and Ruzik (28), in a later 
report from the Oregon station, advocated the application

of sulphur as phosphates containing sulphur. In 36 field trials, 
reported in the same paper, alfalfa hay production was increased 
as much as two tons per acre by the application of 30 pounds of 
borax per acre, and the sulphur and nitrogen content of the hay 
were also increased. Chapman (3), in greenhouse experiments 
with three calcareous soils relatively low in calcium carbonate 
(3.7% or less) and moderately well supplied with phosphates, 
found that physiologically acid nitrogen and sulphur fertilizers 
markedly increased the availability of the phosphates, being 
particularly effective on the soils lowest in carbonate and 
highest in phosphate. 

Many workers in the United States have reported large 
increases in the hay and seed yield of alfalfa by small applica¬ 
tions of boron to the soil. Boron becomes available very 
slowly and because of this the total boron content of the soil 
cannot be used as an indication of a need for boron. 

Soil conditions that affect boron availability and 
the relation between boron and other plant nutrients have been 
studied in several districts in the United States. Cook and 
Millar (7), at the Michigan State College, reported that boron 
^/ C /e>»ey occurred most commonly on alkaline or overlimed soils but also 
found it occurring on acid soils. They found boron deficiency 
more often on hilltops and slopes than on low level land. Per¬ 
vious subsoil layers usually occurred under areas where boron 
deficiency symptoms were most severe. The boron content of 
badly leached areas was not much less than that of surrounding 
areas leached to a lesser extent. They credited the boron

starvation of the leached areas to the removal by leaching of 
the boron as rapidly as it was made available. They determined 
that the availability of boron is not affected when the pH of 
the soil is raised with a salt that does not furnish a cation 
capable of forming an insoluble borate. However, calcium and 
magnesium fixed boron in the form of insoluble borates in soil 
with a basic reaction but not in a soil with an acid reaction. 

Other workers observed the same relation. Midgley 
and Dunklee (21) reported that the ability of soils to fix 
boron depended on the degree of acidity and on the extent to 
which they had been subsequently limed. Peat moss from Maine 
and Vermont podzol soil fixed very little boron in their 
acid state. Their ability to fix boric acid increased up to 
and slightly beyond neutrality when lime was applied in increased 
amounts. Most neutral soils tested were only slightly affected 
when similarly treated but, if acidified by leaching similar to 
podzolization, they fixed large amounts of boron when excessively 
limed. 

Parks and Shaw (23) demonstrated a possible method of 
boron fixation in the soil by the use of mixtures of solutions 
of silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus 
with boric acid titrated to reactions varying from a pH of 5.0 
to a pH of 9.0. They found that boron fixation was favored by 
reactions above neutrality, by dehydration and retitration, and 
by the presence of calcium ions in the mixtures being titrated. 

Colwell and Cummings (5) tested calcium, sodium, and 
potassium metaborates as compared with boric acid as sources of

boron in nutrient solutions. They found that, regardless of 
the sourceofboron, deficiency and toxicity symptoms appeared at 
the same time and at the same levels of concentration. Speci¬ 
fic conductance tests on calcium, sodium, and potassium meta¬ 
borates and sodium tetraborate showed that for solutions of all 
the salts except calcium metaborate the ionic conductance of 
the boron-carrying anion was the same and corresponded with the 
value for the HgBOg anion. For the calcium metaborate this 
value was much lower and that the system was unstable was indi¬ 
cated by a gradual lowering,with aging,of the conductance 
values and of the pH. 

Using Crosby silt loam Jones and Scarseth (16) grew 
alfalfa in the greenhouse with varying amounts of lime, ferti¬ 
lizers, and boron. The growth of alfalfa was not as good on 
the unlimed soil with a pH of 5.6 as on the limed soil with a 
pH of 6.6 and 7.6. Varying the borax application from 0 to 50 
pounds per acre in the two series of limed pots produced no 
definite change in yield. The calcium-boron ratio, however, 
became lower as the applications of borax increased. This ratio 
was also consistently higher with the highest pH values result¬ 
ing from the limed pots. The amount of boron taken up by the 
plants was in proportion to the amount of boron added to the 
soil. Less boron was taken up at the higher than at the lower 
pH values for each rate of borax application. 

Marsh and Shive (19), working with corn in nutrient 
solutions with varying amounts of boron and calcium, found that

within certain limits the boron content of the substrate did 
not significantly affect the calcium absorption rates of the 
plants. The soluble calcium in the corn tissue was determined 
by the boron content of the plant which was in turn determined 
by the boron content of the substrate. 

Investigations in many parts of the United States 
have shown that the available boron in soils, especially those 
heavily limed, is too low for satisfactory alfalfa production. 
Brown and King (2), in Connecticut, reported 75% more boron- 
deficient plants on soil which had received 9 tons of limestone 
per acre between 1914 and 1918 than on soil which had received 
7.5 tons during the same time. On this land, 20 pounds of 
borax per acre increased the height of alfalfa by 15%, the 
yield by 16%, and the boron in the leaves from 21 to 62 p.p.m. 
Cook (6), in greenhouse experiments with Michigan soil, obtained 
increases in vegetative growth of alfalfa of 14.4% by the appli¬ 
cation of two pounds of borax per acre. In Alabama Naftel (22) 
obtained beneficial results from the application of borax to 15 
out of 20 limed soils used. Piland and Ireland (24) obtained 
very good seed set on alfalfa by the application of 20 pounds 
per acre of borax, while the untreated plots yielded none. 

Baur, Huber, and Wheeting (1), on western Washington 
soils, found that boron-deficiency characteristics were asso¬ 
ciated with a restricted supply of moisture. By the application 
of 60 pounds per acre of borax they obtained an increase of from 
1457 to 2200 pounds of hay per acre. In Virginia, Gizzard and

Matthews (12) reported an increase of from 239 to 743 pounds of 
hay per acre by the application of 15 pounds of borax per acre, 
with a yield of from 82 to 184 pounds of seed per acre from the 
borax-treated plots and none for the untreated ones* 

Dregne and Powers (9) reported that both borax and 
boric acid gave profitable increases in alfalfa hay on the 
major soil types of northwestern Oregon* The most profitable 
rate of application was 60 pounds per acre of boric acid* 

Powers (26) obtained an increase of 300$ by the application of 
30 pounds per acre of borax on an old stand of alfalfa on irri¬ 
gated land* In three other fields an average increase of one 
ton per acre was realized by boron application. Growth response 
of alfalfa to one application of borax was maintained over a 
period of 2*5 years. The addition of boron to the soil increased 
the boron content of the plants grown in it and slightly in¬ 
creased the protein content* It also increased chlorophyll 
content 50$ and vitamin A content 30$. Piland, Ireland, and 
Reisenauer (25) applied to 13 alfalfa fields in North Carolina 
sufficient borax to supply boron at the rates of 0*5, 1*0 and 
1*5 p.p.m. They obtained, by the application of boron, hay 
increases as high as 27$ over the check plots and seed increases 
of 460, 433, and 529 per cent respectively for the three boron 
applications. 

Alfalfa has shown a response to fertilizers on many 
soils* Vandecaveye and Bond (36), in field trials in both 
eastern and western Y/ashington, applied nitrogen, phosphorus, 
and potassium alone and in all possible combinations. Nitrogen

and phosphorus, when applied together, gave as large an increase 
as the complete fertilizer and larger than any one applied alone 
or in combination with any other. The increase over the check, 
obtained by the application of nitrogen and phosphorus, was 1.3 
tons per acre in eastern Washington and 1 ton per acre in 
western Washington. 

Sewell and Latshaw (30) experimented in the greenhouse 
with different applications of lime, superphosphate, and potash 
on an acid silt loam soil to determine their effect on the growth 
and composition of alfalfa. They obtained the largest increase 
in yield by the application of 450 pounds of superphosphate per 
acre plus sufficient lime to bring the pH of the soil to the 
neutral point. Chemical analysis showed that the superphosphate 
treatments alone did not increase the phosphorus content of the 
hay but that the combined application of lime and superphosphate 
did. 


MATERIAL AND METHODS 


In the spring of 1943 two fields of one-year-old 
stands of alfalfa on gray wooded soil near Warburg were 
selected for the experiment. 

One field was on the farm of Mr. J. Innes. It had 
been seeded at the rate of four pounds of seed per acre and, 
consequently, was a very thin but nevertheless very even stand.

The other field, on the farm of Mr. 0. Anderson, had been 
seeded at the rate of 10 pounds of seed per acre* It was also 
a very even stand but much thicker than that on the former 
field. 

The practice of light seeding is recommended for 
alfalfa seed production in Alberta (11) 0 The choice of these 
two fields allowed a comparison between the light and heavy 
seeding. 

One experiment was established on each field. Each 
experiment consisted of a 5 x 5 Latin square design with split 
plots. The five treatments varied only in the amount of borax 
applied, the rates being 0, 5, 15, 25, and 35 pounds per acre. 

To half of each of the cheek plots and the borax- 
treated plots 16-20 ammonium phosphate was applied at the rate 
of 100 pounds per acre. The other half of each plot was left 
unfertilized. The fertilized and unfertilized parts were the 
smallest plot units in the experiment, each having an area of 
200 square feet. 

The ammonium phosphate (16-20) fertilizer used con¬ 
tained 15 °/o sulphur which, as reported previously (38), is a 
necessary constituent of a fertilizer for the gray wooded soils. 

The borax and fertilizer were applied on May 27, 1943. 
The amount to be applied to each plot was measured and placed 
in a container with a perforated bottom and shaken evenly over 
the prescribed area. 


Samples from the plots were harvested on September 20th

The sampler used was a half-inch steel rod bent in the form of 
a spiral with a diameter of 33 inches. Four samples were taken 
at random from each plot by placing the sampler on the foliage, 
turning it until it lay on the ground, and then cutting all the 
plants inside the circle. The four samples from each plot were 
bulked and weighed in the field to the nearest five grams. 

This weight was taken as the vegetative growth produced. The 
sample from each plot v/as wrapped in cloth to prevent loss of 
seed, tagged and allowed to dry. 

Threshing was done with a rod-row thresher. The seed 
was cleaned with a Clipper seed cleaner and then hand-screened 
to remove any remaining foreign seeds. The samples of seed 
were then weighed to the nearest tenth of a gram. 

To change the yield from grams per plot to pounds per 
acre the weights were multiplied by the conversion factor of 
4.041. 

The data obtained from these experiments were analysed 
according to the method described by Goulden (13). 


EXESRIMENTAL RESULTS 


The fields were inspected on July 26th. At this time 
it was quite evident, in both fields, that the application of 
fertilizer had increased the vegetative growth. The difference 
between the fertilized and unfertilized plots was, however,

for the thick stand of the Anderson field. Besides being more 
abundant the foliage was a much darker green color on the fer¬

The application of fertilizer had a very pronounced 
effect on the vegetative growth of the alfalfa in this experi¬ 
ment, as is shown by the highly significant F value for fer¬ 
tilizer in the above table. The mean yield for the fertilized 
plots was 1654 grams as compared with a mean yield of 197 grams 
for the unfertilized plots (Table I), with a minimum signifi¬ 
cant difference of 155 grams. The increase due to the applica¬ 
tion of fertilizer on this field, converted to pounds per acre, 
represents a gain of 5891 pounds of vegetative growth per acre. 

The alfalfa on this field showed no response whatso¬ 
ever to the application of boron at any of the rates used. The 
significant F value for rows (Table II) is evidence that soil 
conditions were not uniform over the area occupied by this 
experiment.

The vegetative yields for the different treatments on 
this field followed the same trend as those on the Innes field. 
The mean vegetative yield of the fertilized plots was 973 grams 
compared with 634 grams for the unfertilized plots (Table III) 
with a minimum significant difference between the means of 61 
grams. 

The application of boron again produced no increase 
or decrease in the yield of vegetation. 

Discussion 


On both fields the application of 100 pounds of 
ammonium phosphate (16-20) per acre increased the vegetative 
growth of the alfalfa. The increase was, however, greater on 
the thin stand of the Innes field than on the thick stand of 
the Anderson field. 

A combined analysis of variance of the vegetative 
yield for the two fields was attempted. The extremely low yield 
of the unfertilized plots and the relatively high yield of the 
fertilized plots on the Innes field in comparison with the inter 
mediate yields for the corresponding plots on the Anderson field 
complicated the analysis. This resulted in the difference 
between the yield of the fertilized and the unfertilized plots 
appearing as interaction between fertilizer and field, thus 
masking the true effect of the fertilizer. 

The increase in vegetative growth obtained in this

experiment by the application of fertilizer to alfalfa on the 
gray wooded soil agrees with the results reported by Wyatt, 

Newton, and Ignatieff (38) and by White (37). 

The high vegetative yield of 6686 pounds per acre for 
the fertilized plots of the thin stand as compared with the 
yield of 3932 pounds per acre for the corresponding plots of 
the thick stand may have been caused by other factors net con¬ 
sidered in this experiment. One reason for the difference may 
be that the alfalfa seed sown at the rate of 10 pounds per acre 
produced a stand that, owing to crowding and competition 
between the plants, was too thick to produce maximum returns. 
Another possible reason for the increased growth on the thin 
stand may be the fact that each plant there received a larger 
proportion of the fertilizer than did those on the thick stand 
and that this added stimulus received by each plant produced 
more growth than could be realized by a greater number of plants. 
That the fertilizer produced nutrient conditions more nearly 
optimum for alfalfa growth on the one field than on the other 
offers another possible explanation for the difference between 
the growth response of the alfalfa on the two fields, since the 
fields were some six miles apart with different cropping histories 
and were conceivably quite different from each other nutritionally. 
The application of boron, as shown by Tables I and IIJ, produced 
no significant effect on the vegetative growth on either of the 
fields. By examining the mean yields for the different boron 
treatments it becomes evident that there was no tendency toward

an increase or decrease in the vegetative yield as the rate of 
boron application was increased. This fact suggests that 
further experiments on these fields would fail to show any 
beneficial effect from the application of boron.

The seed yield of the fertilized plots on this field 
showed a remarkable increase over the seed yield of the unfer¬ 
tilized plots. The minimum significant difference between the 
mean seed yields for the fertilized and unfertilized plots is 
2.3 grams, with an actual difference of 20.3 grams in favor of 
the fertilized plots (Table V). This difference represents an 
increase of 82.1 pounds of seed per acre. 

The application of boron as shown by the analysis of 
variance (Table VI) had no effect on the amount of seed produced. 

The seed yield in grams, obtained from the plots 
receiving the different treatments, and the mean yield in 
pounds of seed per acre for the fertilized and unfertilized plots 
on the Anderson field are shown in Table VII, and the analysis 
of variance of these results in Table VIII,

(Table VII), with a minimum significant difference of 3.5 grams. 
The seed yield on the plots in this field was neither increased 
nor decreased by the application of boron. 

Discussion 


Under the conditions of this experiment the applica¬ 
tion of 100 pounds of ammonium phosphate per acre increased the 
amount of seed produced by alfalfa on gray wooded soil. A 
similar increase was obtained by White (37) with the application 
of fertilizer to alfalfa on these same soils. 

A comparison of Tables V and VII shows that the unfer¬ 
tilized plots on the thick stand yielded 31.6 pounds of seed per 
acre, an increase of 37,3 pounds per acre over the unfertilized 
plots on the thin stand. The application of fertilizer to 
these fields, however, reversed this order and the fertilized 
plots on the thin stand yielded 86.4 pounds of seed per acre as 
compared with 45.5 pounds per acre for the corresponding plots 
on the thick stand. 

These results support the recommendation of a very 
light stand of alfalfa for seed production in Alberta (11). 

They also emphasize the importance of suitable fertilizers for 
satisfactory seed production. 

There was no tendency for seed production to increase 
or decrease even below the level of significance as the rate of 
boron application was increased. This strongly indicates that

boron is not a limiting factor in alfalfa seed production on 
these soils. 

A combined analysis of variance for the two fields 
was attempted but, as with the vegetative yield of the two 
fields, the extreme seed yields of the fertilized and unfer¬ 
tilized plots on the one field, when compared with the inter¬ 
mediate yields of the corresponding plots on the other, com¬ 
plicated the analysis. 

In general, the results for the seed yield appeared 
to correspond very closely to the results obtained for the 
vegetative yield. 

CORRELATION AND REGRESSION 


The correlation and regression coefficients were 
calculated to determine the relationship between the seed 
yield and vegetative growth. These are given in Table IX.

The significance of the difference between the cor¬ 


relation coefficients and between the regression coefficients 
for the seed yield on vegetative yield for the two fields was 
calculated. The difference in both cases was found to be insig¬ 
nificant. This permitted the calculation of correlation and 
regression coefficients for the data for the two fields taken 
together. 

The regression lines of the results for each field 
and for the two fields combined are shown in Figure 1. 

To determine whether the seed yield had increased 
more than could be accounted for by the increase in vegetative 
growth the seed yield was adjusted, by means of covariance, for 
differences in yield of vegetative growth. The results of 
analysis of variance, using adjusted seed yields, are given for 
the Innes Field in Table IX A and for the Anderson field in 
Table IX B.

Discussion 


The positive relationship between seed yield and 
vegetative growth in this experiment (Table IX) agrees with 
the relationship found by White (37)* The increase of 1.32 
grams of seed per 100-gram increase in vegetative growth, 
obtained in this experiment, is however greater. 

The correlation and regression coefficients for the 
seed yield on the vegetative growth for the combined fields 
(Table IX) and the regression line (Figure 1) give a more 
representative value of the relation between seed and vegeta¬ 
tion than do the data for either field taken alone. The use 
of the data for the combined fields eliminates the very short 
range of values of the vegetative growth from the Anderson 
field and gives a more even distribution of the yields than was 
obtained in the Innes field where the yields were concentrated

The analysis of variance of the adjusted seed yield 
for each of the fields (Tables IX A and IX B) shows that the 
increase in seed yield was a direct result of the increase in 
vegetative growth.

PART II 


GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENTS 


Since only one year’s results could be obtained from 
the field experiments, it was thought that, though greenhouse 
experimental results are not always reliable when applied to 
field conditions, some additional data on the boron require¬ 
ments of alfalfa on the gray wooded soil might be obtained from 
greenhouse experiments. 

It was also desirable to secure more definite infor¬ 
mation on the boron requirements of alfalfa. For this purpose 
sand culture experiments were set up. Sand cultures were 
chosen for controlled nutrition studies to eliminate the dif¬ 
ficulties encountered in aerating water culture media and to 
provide a better support for the plant than could be obtained 
in the latter type of controlled nutrient culture. 


LITERATURE REVIEW 


Thornton and Nicol (35) studied the reduction of 
nodule numbers and growth of alfalfa in sand cultures caused by 
the addition of sodium nitrate to a complete nutrient solution. 
The sodium nitrate was added at rates of from 0 to 10 grams per

litre of nutrient solution. Increasing amounts of nitrate 
reduced both the number and the size of the nodules. The 
volume of bacterial tissue was, however, reduced to a greater 
extent than was the number of nodules. The mean root weights 
decreased with increasing doses of nitrate, but the ratio of 
roots to tops remained constant at all nitrate levels. The 
alfalfa was grown successfully in the sand culture solutions 
for 100 days. 

Schroeder and Walker (31) grew garden peas in sand 
cultures with varying concentrations of a complete nutrient 
solution. The concentrations were 0.1, 1, 3, and 5 times the 
concentration which had proven to produce satisfactory growth. 

The nutrient solutions were added to the sand on alternate days 
and the excess drained off immediately. Plants grown in the 
nutrient solution of 5 times the strength of the check, solution 
had smaller leaves and were shorter and a darker green in color 
than the plants grown in the check solution. The plants supplied 
with the solution of 0.1 times the concentration of the check 
solution were slightly lighter in color. All other characteris¬ 
tics of the plants grown in the solutions of 0.1, 1, and 3 times 
the concentration of the check solution were the same. 

Eaton (10) grew alfalfa in sand cultures containing 
varying amounts of chloride and sulphate salts. The alfalfa 
grown in the control solution used in this experiment produced 
satisfactory growth during seven months of experimentation. 

Cook (6) prevented alfalfa yellows and obtained an increase in

growth of alfalfa in sand cultures of from 7,61 to 11,90 grams 
per plant by the addition of ,003 grams of Na^B^O^ to 5 kilo¬ 
grams of white quartz sand which had received an otherwise com¬ 
plete nutrient solution. White (37) grew alfalfa to maturity in 
the greenhouse using water cultures as the nutrient media. The 
plants grown in solutions containing half as much phosphorus or 
potassium as the check solution produced less vegetative growth 
and seed than did those grown in the complete nutrient solution. 

In this experiment daily aeration of the nutrient solutions was 
necessary for satisfactory growth. 

Reeve and Shive (29) used sand culture experiments to 
determine the potassium-boron and calcium-boron relationships 
in plant nutrition. When the nutrient solution contained 0.5 
• p.p.m. of boron, tomato plants produced satisfactory growth at all 
concentrations of potassium and calcium used in this experiment. 

No symptoms of boron deficiency or toxicity were evident in the 

■ 

plants grown in the solutions containing 0.1 to 0.5 p.p.m. of 
boron with concentrations of potassium from 10 to 500 p.p.m. 

The plants grown in the solution containing 0.001 and 5.0 p.p.m. 
of boron, however, showed boron deficiency and toxicity symptoms 
respectively and in increasing intensity as the amount of potas¬ 
sium in the .solutions was increased. Plants grown in solutions 
containing varying amounts of boron and calcium showed no boron 
fic)eue H symptoms when the solutions contained 0.5 p.p.m. of boron with 
calcium concentrations of between 5 and 500 p.p.m. Boron defi¬ 
ciency symptoms were increased as the calcium content of the 
solutions containing 0.001 and 0.01 p.p.m. of boron was increased.

The boron toxicity symptoms were, however, decreased as the con¬ 
centration of calcium in the solutions containing 5 and 10 p.p.m. 
of boron was increased* 


EXPERIMENT I 


During the winter of 1942-43 an experiment was set up 
in the greenhouse to test the suitability of local and purified 
silica sand as media for the growing alfalfa under controlled 
nutrient conditions.' 

Material and Methods 


Purified silica sand was obtained from the Dominion 
Glass Company, Medicine Hat, Alberta. 

Two-gallon, glazed crocks, with drainage holes, were 
used for the experiment. Fifteen crocks were filled to within 
an inch of the top with each of the two sands. This made thirty 
crocks in all for the experiment. 

Four alfalfa plants were dug from the field after 
growth had ceased in the fall, and were stored in the root cellar 
until three weeks before cuttings were required. On December 1st 
stem cuttings-were made from the plants. The top portion of each 
stem was discarded to eliminate some of the variability among the 
cuttings. For each cutting the basal cut was made through a

node and the terminal cut about one inch above the next node, 
thus leaving one complete node on each cutting. The cuttings 
from each plant were kept separate. The basal ends of the cut- 
tings were immersed for £4 hours in a solution of Hormodin A, 
a liquid root-stimulating substance manufactured by Merck and Co., 
Rahway, N.J. The strength of the solution used was l.£5 cc. of 
Hormodin A in £50 cc. of distilled water. White (37) found this 
strength to give satisfactory results. 

One cutting from each of the four plants was trans¬ 
ferred from the Hormodin A solution to each crock. Extra cut¬ 
tings, to be used if any failed to form roots, were transferred 
to a flat containing local sand. 

The nutrient solutions applied to the sand in this 
experiment were based on solutions advocated by Hoagland and 
Arnon (14) for water culture experiments. Three different solu¬ 
tions were used: a complete solution containing all the essential 
elements, one containing all the elements except nitrogen, and 
one containing all the elements except calcium. 

The constituents used to make up one litre of each of 
the nutrient solutions are given in Table X. Distilled water 
was used in all cases.

For the pots containing each of the sands, the experi¬ 
ment was of a randomized block design as described by Goulden 
(13). Each solution was applied to ten crocks, five containing 
silica sand, and five containing local sand. Thus the experiment 
with each sand consisted of three treatments with five replicates 
of each. 

Every second day for the first two months of the experi¬ 
ment, and twice every three days for the remainder of the time 
sufficient nutrient solution was added to each crock to permit 
200 cc. to drain out. This helped to prevent the accumulation

of unused salts. As a further precaution against the accumula¬ 
tion of salts each of the pots was flushed with two litres of 
distilled water every two weeks. 

Artificial light to supplement the short winter days 
was found to be necessary to prevent excessive vegetative 
growth and to provide conditions under which the plants would 
produce seed. Artificial light was supplied from 4:30 p.m. 
to 1:30 a.m. 

To prevent algae from growing on the surface of the 
sand it was necessary to cover the tops of the crocks, leaving 
openings for the plants. 

The flowers on each plant were artificially tripped 
every second day and the number for each plant recorded. The 
pods were picked on June 15th, counted, and those from each 
plant put in separate paper sacks to dry. Y/hen they were dry 
enough to thresh readily, the pods from each plant were threshed 
by hand and the seeds counted. 

The vegetative growth was removed at the same time as 
the pods and allowed to dry. The weight of the air-dried 
material from each crock was taken as the vegetative growth 
produced.

The cuttings in the silica sand to which the nitrogen- 
deficient solution was applied produced very little growth and 
died before the completion of the experiment. The yields, for 
all factors studied, produced by the complete and calcium- 
deficient solution on the silica sand (Table XI) were suffi¬ 
ciently different that statistical analysis of the results was 
considered unnecessary. 

Table XII shows that the three solutions when applied 
to the local sand caused a significant difference in the 
numbers of pods and seeds produced by the alfalfa. The alfalfa 
grown in the nitrogen-deficient solution, as shown by Table XI, 
produced more pods and seeds than the alfalfa grown in either of 
the other solutions. 


Discussion 


The fact that the elimination of nitrogen or calcium 
from the nutrient solution applied to the local sand had no 
effect on the amount of vegetation or the number of flowers 
produced was sufficient to show that the local sand contained 
plant nutrients that rendered it useless for controlled nutrient 
studies. 

As shown by Tables XI and XXI the number of pods and 
seeds produced by the alfalfa grown on the different solutions 
on the local sand do not correspond with the number of flowers 
tripped. The greater number of pods and seeds produced by the 
alfalfa on the nitrogen-deficient solution agrees with field.

observations. Soils high in nitrogen, as in the black soil area 
of Alberta, are not as satisfactory for alfalfa seed as are the 
gray wooded soils which are low in nitrogen. The difference in 
seed production is, however, usually associated with excessive 
vegetation on the soils with a high nitrogen content. Since 
vegetative growth was the same regardless of the solution applied, 
this experiment would appear to indicate that excessive amounts 
of nitrogen exert a depressive effect on alfalfa seed setting 
quite independent of the amount of vegetation produced. Although 
these results are in no way conclusive they do suggest another 
approach to this problem. 

On the silica sand the failure of the alfalfa plants 
to grow in the nitrogen-deficient solution and the very limited 
growth produced by the calcium-deficient solution, when com¬ 
pared with the growth produced by the complete solution, were 
considered sufficient evidence of the suitability of this sand 
for controlled nutrient studies. 

In this experiment there was a great deal of variation 
between crocks that could not be accounted for by treatments or 
replicates. This is shown by the large experimental error in 
Table XII. 


EXPERIMENT II 


During the summer of 1943 an experiment was conducted 
in the greenhouse to determine the effect on the growth and seed

production of alfalfa of different concentrations of boron and 
other plant nutrients in the nutrient solution. 

Material and Methods 


Purified silica sand for this experiment was obtained 
from the same source as that used in Experiment I. 

Alfalfa plants to be used in this experiment were dug 
from the field in the spring of 1943 as soon as the ground had 
thawed. They were stored in the root cellar in moist earth 
until June 11th when they were taken to the greenhouse. Each 
plant was divided into four parts by splitting the root and 
crown with a sharp knife. 

Glazed, two-gallon, earthenware crocks, with drainage 
holes, were used in this experiment. Each crock, containing one 
section of an alfalfa plant, was filled with sand to within one 
inch of the top. 

The standard solution in this experiment was the same 
as the complete nutrient solution used in Experiment I. The 
solutions varied in both the concentration of boron and the con¬ 
centration of all other nutrients taken together. The concentra¬ 
tions of boron were 0.2, 0.6, and 1.8 p.p.m. of the nutrient 
solution. Concentrations of all other nutrients were 0.5, 1, and 
3 times the concentration used for the complete nutrient solution 
in Experiment I. The different concentrations of boron and of 
the other nutrients were applied in all possible combinations.

This made nine treatments in all* 

The experiment was of a randomized block design with 
three replicates of each treatment. In the statistical analysis 
the variance due to treatments was divided into the variance due 
to: (1) the concentrations of boron, (2) the concentrations of 
all other nutrients, and (3) the interaction between boron and 
the other nutrients. 

The other details for the experiment were the same as 
those for Experiment I except that no artificial light was 
necessary during the summer. Boron deficiency symptoms are 
described and illustrated by deTurk (8), This report was used as 
a basis for recognizing boron deficiency symptoms in the alfalfa 
in the greenhouse experiments, 

t 

Experimental Results 


It was found that although the flowers were tripped 
every second day some self-tripping took place, possibly owing 
to the high temperatures. As a result of this the data on the 
number of flowers tripped were discarded. 

The vegetative growth and the numbers of pods and seeds 
produced by the alfalfa in the experiment are given in Table XIII 
and the results of the analysis of variance of these data appear 


in Table XIV

The different concentrations of boron or of the other 
nutrients used in this experiment had no effect on any of the 
factors of alfalfa growth or on seed production studied in this 
experiment. 


Discussion 


In this experiment, as in the previous one, relatively 
large variations between crocks caused the error in the analysis 
of variance to be very large. For this reason it was necessary 
that there be great differences between treatments before any 
significance could be realized. 

The results of this experiment demonstrate the very 
small amounts of boron necessary for satisfactory growth of 
alfalfa. They also indicate that the availability of boron was 
not adversely affected when the concentration of all the other

EXPERIMENT III 


As mentioned previously in this paper, only one year’s 
results on the effect of borax and ammonium phosphate on alfalfa 
vegetative growth and seed production were available. In an 
effort to obtain further evidence on the effect of these plant 
nutrients on alfalfa grown on gray wooded soil, this experiment 
was conducted in the greenhouse during the summer of 1943. 

Material and Methods 


The plants for this experiment were treated in the 
same manner as were those used in Experiment II. One section 
of each plant was placed in a two-gallon, glazed crock filled 
to within an inch of the top with gray wooded soil. The drain¬ 
age holes in the crocks were stoppered to prevent the loss of 
nutrients. 

This experiment consisted of twenty-seven crocks. 
Ammonium phosphate was applied at the rates of 0, 50, and 100 
pounds per acre, and borax at the rates of 0, 10, and 30 pounds 
per acre. The experimental design was the same as for Experi¬ 
ment II. The borax and fertilizer were applied in all possible

combinations, making a total of nine treatments with three 
replicates of each. In the analysis of variance of the results, 
the variance due to treatments in general was divided into its 
component parts: the variance due to rate of application of 
fertilizer, that due to the rate of application of boron, and 
that due to the interaction between the two. 

The amount of borax and fertilizer to be applied to 
each crock was determined by the area of the surface of the soil. 
The correct amount was weighed on a precision balance, dissolved 
in distilled water, and the solution applied to the soil. 

Distilled water was supplied to the soil as required. 

The flowers were tripped every second day and the num¬ 
ber recorded. When the pods were ripe the plants were treated 
as in Experiment I. 


Experimental Results 


As in Experiment II, self-tripping took place and the 
data on the number of flowers tripped had to be discarded. 

The vegetative yield and the number of pods and seeds 
produced by the alfalfa on the gray wooded soil in the green¬ 
house are shown in Table XV. The results of the analysis of 
variance of these data are given in Table XVI.

The amount of vegetation produced by the alfalfa on 
the gray wooded soil was the only factor studied that was 
affected significantly by the application of fertilizer. 

(Table XVI). The application of ammonium phosphate at the rate 
of 100 pounds per acre, as shown by Table XV, significantly 
increased the vegetative growth above that produced by the 
alfalfa on the soil which had received no fertilizer or only 50 
pounds per acre. 

The application of borax to the soil had no signifi¬ 
cant effect on either the vegetative growth or the seed yield. 


Discussion 


In this experiment, the increase in vegetative growth 


resulting from the application of ammonium phosphate (16-20)

to gray wooded soil is in direct agreement with the results 
obtained from the field experiment reported in this paper and 
also with the results obtained by other workers (38 and 39). 

Although the fertilizer had no significant effect on 
seed production in this experiment, there was a definite trend 
toward a reduction in the amount of seed produced as the rate 
of fertilizer application was increased (Table XV). If the 
experiment had contained more replicates this difference would 
no doubt have been significant. 

Although the vegetative growth and seed yield of the 
plants receiving the different applications of borax did not 
differ significnatly, there was a definite trend, as shown in 
Table XV, toward a reduction in seed yield as the rate of 
application of borax was increased. 

GENERAL DISCUSSION 


The large increase in both seed and hay production 
resulting from the application of ammonium phosphate (16-20) 
containing 15$ sulphur to two fields of alfalfa on gray wooded 
soil is a good indication of the necessity of fertilizers for 
satisfactory crop production on this type of soil* Only one 
year’s results are reported here, but they are substantiated by 
results reported by other workers. Over a five-year period 
Wyatt et al (38) obtained an increase of 3165 pounds of alfalfa

hay per acre by the application of ammonium phosphate (16-20) 
to gray wooded soil. White (37) reported increases in both hay 
and seed production by the application of fertilizers to alfalfa 
on the same farms on which the field experiments reported in 
this paper were conducted. The seed yields obtained by White 
were, however, much lower than those obtained in this experiment. 
This indicates that other factors besides nutrition play an 
important part in the failure of alfalfa to produce a satisfac¬ 
tory yield of seed and that economic increases in seed production 
can be realized by the application of fertilizers only if the 
other environmental conditions are favorable. This fact is 
demonstrated in the greenhouse experiment, with alfalfa on gray 
wooded soil. The application of ammonium phosphate at the rate 
of 100 pounds per acre increased the vegetative growth but 
showed a tendency to decrease the seed yield. 

In the field experiment, increased vegetative growth 
was accompanied by an increase in seed production. This relation¬ 
ship is the same as that found by White (37) and indicates that, 
within the limits of these experiments, nutritional conditions 
favoring vegetative growth also favor seed production. 

The increase in seed production on the Anderson field 
was directly due to the increase in vegetative growth. This 
relationship^ also held for the Innes field. The 

very low seed yield from the unfertilized plots on this field 
indicates that one or more nutrients were sufficiently low to 
prevent satisfactory seed formation. The lack of sulphur in the 
soil has a detrimental effect on seed formation and, since, as

shown by Wyatt et al (38), the gray wooded soils of Alberta are 
in general very low in sulphur, it is quite probable that sul¬ 
phur was the limiting factor in seed production on the unferti¬ 
lized plots. 

The comparatively high yield of seed from the ferti¬ 
lized plots on the thin stand over that produced by the thick 
stand is in accordance with practices recommended by Fryer (11) 
for alfalfa seed production in Alberta. 

The apparent depressive effect of an excessive amount 
of nitrogen on seed production, obtained in the sand culture 
experiment with local sand, agrees very well with general field 
observations in Alberta. Soils high in nitrogen do not lend 
themselves to satisfactory seed production. Contrary to field 
observations, however, low seed production was not accompanied 
by excessive vegetative growth. 

The boron requirement of alfalfa, as shown by the 
controlled nutrient studies, is very small since 0.3 p.p.m. of 
boron was as effective for vegetative growth and seed produc¬ 
tion as were concentrations of 0.6 and 1.8 p.p.m. Under the 
conditions of this experiment the availability of boron was not 
greatly affected by the concentration of the other salts in the 
nutrient solution, since no symptom of boron deficiency was 
evident on the alfalfa receiving 0.2 p.p.m. boron regardless of 
the concentration of the other salts.

SUMMARY 


1. The application of ammonium phosphate (16-20) to 
alfalfa on gray wooded soil at the rate of 100 pounds per acre 
increased both the vegetative growth and the seed production. 

2. Alfalfa seeded at the rate of 4 pounds per acre, and 
fertilized at the above rate produced more hay and seed than 
alfalfa seeded at the rate of 10 pounds per acre and receiving 
the same treatment. 

3. On the thick stand the increase in seed production was 
due to the increase in vegetative growth, while on the thin 

7 \ 0 ? 

stand the increase in seed production was v greater than could be 
accounted for by the increase in vegetation. 

4. The application of borax, at the rates of 5, 15, 25, 
and 35 pounds per acre, to alfalfa on gray wooded soil had no 
effect on either the vegetative growth or the seed production 
over that produced by the plots receiving no boron. 

5. Local sand contained enough plant nutrients to render 
it useless for controlled nutrient experiments. 

6. Alfalfa growing in local sand in the greenhouse pro¬ 
duced less seed when nitrogen was included in the nutrient solu¬ 
tion added to the sand than did alfalfa grown in sand to which 
solutions containing no nitrogen were added.
