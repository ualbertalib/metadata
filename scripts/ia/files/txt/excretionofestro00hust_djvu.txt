PREFACE 

An essential antecedent for an investigation of 
any branch of sex function is a clear understanding of 
the fundamentals of the sex cycle. For this reason a 
brief resume of the basic phenomena is presented here, 
as a preface to the limited field of this investigation. 

It is now well established that at puberty, certain 
hormones secreted by the pituitary gland (gonadotropins), 
stimulate the gonads, initiating and controlling Graafian 
follicular maturation, ovulation and corpus luteum 
formation. As a consequence of this stimulation, the 
ovary elaborates estrogens from the Graafian follicles 
and progestogens from the corpus luteum. In the male, 
the interstitial tissue of the testes is stimulated to 
produce androgens. 

This phenomenon occurs cyclically during the period 
of sexual maturity in the female and the structural and 
secretory changes in the ovaries are reflected in 
periodic alterations in the endometrium and myometrium, 
in the vaginal mucosa and in the mammary glands. 

The estrogenic hormone secreted by the ovarian 
follicles is essential for initiating and controlling 
the functional activity of the female organism, secreted 
in sufficient amount it produces the so-called pro¬ 
liferative phase of endometrial development, increases 
the secretory activity of the uterine serous glands,

enhances the contractility of the uterine muscle and 
causes proliferation of the mammary duct system. When 
ovulation occurs at approximately the fourteenth day 
of the cycle, the follicle ruptures and is converted 
into a corpus luteum. As this develops it secretes a 
progestogen. The period of activity of the corpus 
luteum is about fifteen days and the progestogen secreted 
during this time converts the vascular proliferated 
endometrium into a functional secretory type, preparing 
it for the nidation of the ovum which is now travelling 
down the Fallopian tube toward the uterus. The 
progestogen nullifies any further action of the estrogen, 
producing thus relaxation of the uterine muscle and 
stimulating acinar development in the mammary gland. 
Changes paralleling these in the endometrium take place 
in the vaginal mucosa, and these offer a basis for some 
diagnostic procedures in evaluating ovarian hormone 
function (e.g. vaginal smear). 

If ovulation is followed by fertilization, the 
duration of corpus luteum activity is prolonged and a 
decidua is formed. If fertilization does not occur 
the corpus luteum degenerates and as a direct consequence, 
degenerative changes take place in the highly special¬ 
ized endometrium, resulting in its shedding or 
menstruation. This is associated with involutional

changes in the mammary gland, and mucosal changes in 
the vagina. The cycle is then repeated. If fertilization 
occurs and pregnancy supervenes, at about the end of the 
third lunar month, the placenta takes on the function 
of an endocrine gland and secretes large amounts of 
progestogen. This tends to stabilize pregnancy.

Section I 

THE EXCRETION OF ESTROGENS AND ANDROGENS IN THE URINE 
Introduction 

This investigation presents an examination of 
some of the methods of extraction, purification and 
assay of urinary estrogens and androgens. Some of the 
variables effecting these determinations are investigated 
with a view to improving and simplifying the processes; 
and ascertaining more of the chemical characteristics 
of the substances excreted. A standard procedure for 
extraction, purification and assay of both groups of 
hormones has been developed in order to establish a basis 
for comparing and correlating the findings of various 
investigators. 

Scone 

In all cases total estrogens and total androgens 
are determined, no effort being made to separate them 
into their constituent parts. Although some information 
of physiological significance is derived from the 
laborious differential assay of the different estrogenic 
and androgenic fractions, (1), the total excretion 
values are as satisfactory an index for clinical use as 
the confused picture of sex endocrine metabolism permits. 

In the cases of assays on urine from patients, 
a thorough clinical examination is not included beyond 














. 














































-7- 


a statement of their gross pathologic condition. The 
course of the disease or of treatment where treatment 
was instituted, is not presented in detail, except 
insofar as that information is relavent to the findings, 
since minute variations in the clinical picture of sex 
endocrine dyscrasiae are of little significance until 
the gross changes are understood. 

Review of Literature 

Ever since Ascheim and Zondek discovered estrogenic 
material in pregnancy urine in 1927 (2), and Loewe and 
Voss found androgenic material in male urine in 1929 (3), 
extraction of urinary sex hormones has been the subject 
of much interest and investigation. Generally speaking, 
investigations were performed with two purposes 

A. It was thought that information obtained from 
urinary hormone assays might be used as an index of 
hormone economy within the body, and, 

B. that an examination of the degraded forms in which 
hormones are excreted might assist in the development 
of ideas regarding their metabolism. In both respects 
the investigations have been successful to a limited 
degree. 

The use of urinary hormone assay as an index of 
hormone economy is possible only in a very general 
manner. Siebke has stated (4) that hormone assays on 

















. 






. 



















.

excreta cannot give an exact idea of general hormone 
economy. Considerable confirmatory evidence for this 
view has been recorded (5)(6)(7), Both sexes excrete 
so-called "male" and "female" hormones in amounts that 
overlap considerably (7), but on the average, normal 
women excrete more estrogenic material and less 
androgenic material than do normal men (8). Different 
workers are in disagreement as to the significance of 
the androgen to estrogen excretion ratio, (7)(8)(9)(10). 
There are wide variations between normal individuals 
and also wide variations in the daily excretion of the 
same individual (7)(11)(12). 

Excretion values from abnormal subjects of both 
sexes overlap considerably with each other and with 
normal, but tend to parallel the degree of hypo-or 
hyper- function (7). In some pathological conditions 
extremes of excretion occur. Thus for example, the 
urine of an individual with adrenal cortical tumour 
contains huge amounts of androgenic material (13)(14), 
while that from a case of granulosa cell tumour of the 
ovary has a very high estrogen content (15)(16). In 
these conditions urinary hormone assays present certain 
diagnostic evidence of specific endocrine dysfunction 
and assist in differentiating between these syndromes 
and others in which the clinical findings may be quite

similar (14)(17). 

The excretion values for estrogens are a little 
more satisfactory than are those for androgens since 
more is known of their production, distribution, 
utilization and destruction. In females the excreted 
amount varies during the menstrual cycle, with two peaks 
of excretion: one approximately at the time of ovulation 
and one just prior to disintegration of the corpus 
luteum. The excretion drops to zero very shortly 
preceding menstruation (18)(19)(See also chart #1). 
Excretion during pregnancy rises steadily as pregnancy 
advances (20)(See chart #2). 

In certain disorders of gynecic function significant 
changes from normal in estrogen excretion occur, so that 
urinary assay in these cases offers a useful diagnostic 
aid. Cases of virilism have normal or lowered excretion 
(14). In granulose tumours of the ovaries the excretion 
is maintained at a high level (16). Male hypogonads 
excrete a larger amount of estrogenic substances than 
do normal males, (7). 

Of significance with regard to the unreliability 
of urinary excretion as an index of hormone economy is 
the observation that a very low percentage of administered 
hormone can be recovered from the urine. Kemp and 
Pedersen - Bjergaard (21) report about 6%. Other

workers approximate this figure (22)(23)(24). 

Several important advances have been made in an 
effort to clarify the metabolism of the sex hormones. 

These have taken the direction of examining the urine 
for metabolites of the various sex hormones. 

It has been established that testosterone, the 
active male hormone is excreted as partly inactivated 
androsterone and dehydroisandrosterone (10). However 
it is not known what part liver and kidney perform in 
the conjugation and inactivation of the circulating 
hormones (25). Testosterone is produced in the testes, 
yet testes are not essential for androgen excretion— 
witness the excretion by women and castrates (7)(5)(26) 

(27) . 

Similarly it has been established that estradiol 
is produced by the ovary and is excreted as the less 
active estrone and estriol (19), However castrate 
females and normal males also excrete estrogenic substance 

(28) (29) so that the ovaries cannot be the only source 
of estrogenic material. As is the case with androgens, 
the association of estrogens with liver and kidney 
function is not fully understood (30)(31). 

The anterior pituitary produces through its tropic 
hormones a profound effect on the adrenal cortex and 
the gonads. All the complexities of this association 














-

have not been satisfactorily explained as yet. It is 
this involved interrelationship that is the complicating 
factor in the study of sex hormones. It has been shown 
that the adrenal cortex produces sex hormones (32 - 35) 
and therefore it has been suggested that the adrenal 
cortex is the source of urinary sex hormones (5). 

Marker (30) postulates a common precursor from 
the pituitary for the sex hormones produced in the 
adrenal and also in the gonads. This compound he 
assumes to be pregnadiene A 4,8, diol 17,21, trione 


3,11,20.

Section II 

ESTROGENS 

Estrogens are excreted in part as free substances 
and in part combined with glycuronic acid in variable 
ratio (19). Assay on untreated urine does not yield 
significant results as the combined fraction is biologically 
inactive. Hydrolysis to liberate the estrogens from com¬ 
bination has therefore become an integral stage in all 
methods of extraction. Procedures described vary greatly 
in the duration of hydrolysis and in the pH of the acid - 
urine mixture. Most investigators agree that a relatively 
drastic hydrolysis is essential for optimum efficiency 
(25)(41). A few (42)(43) suggest that over severe 
hydrolysis has a destructive effect on the estrogens, yet 
the values reported by adherents of both extremes seem 
to agree fairly well in similar instances. 

A great variety of extraction apparatus and solvents 
have been employed. Benzene, ether, CHC1 3 , and CC1 4 have 
been used. The length of time that extraction is 
necessary varies with the efficiency of the apparatus. 

The method of extraction we have adopted is that 
of Leiboff (24) for several reasons: 

1. It embodies an efficient severe hydrolysis. 

2. The length of extraction is relatively short. 

3. A non inflammable solvent, CHC1 3 , is used.

4. A small amount of the extracting solvent is 
used. 

5. The extraction is continuous with a constant 
renewal of extracting solvent and withdrawal 
of extracted estrogens. 

A pparatus 

B is the extraction chamber. 

E is the overflow tube extending 
to the bottom of container B. 
Letter C is a glass plate to 
protect the opening of E. 

Letter F is the tube for trans¬ 
ferring vapor from A to the 
extraction cylinder. A is an 
Erlenmeyer flask for receiving 
the overflow. D is a condenser. 

Method 

A 500 c.c. aliquot of a 24 hr. urine is acidified 
with 50 c.c. of cone. HC1 and evaporated to one third 
its volume by boiling, and then cooled. This is the 
hydrolysis procedure. 

CEC1 3 is placed in B to a level 2 inches higher 
than C. 

The hydrolyzed urine is poured into B through a 
long stemmed funnel. The urine will form a layer above 



the chloroform. 
























































































. 










. 

. 












-16- 


More chloroform is slowly poured into B until 
chloroform is seen to pass through tube E into flask A. 
Enough chloroform is added so that there is about 25 c.c. 
in A. 

Condenser D is set in place and the water turned on. 

Heat of such intensity is applied to extractor and 
flask that the chloroform in bath boils gently and 
steadily. 

When the CHC1 3 in B boils it rises partly up into 
the urine and drops back again. When the temperature 
of the urine is elevated to that of boiling CHC1 3 , the 
CHC1 3 will bubble vigorously through the urine and 
vaporize and be liquified by the condenser. An emulsion 
forms between the layer of CHC1 3 and urine. The flame 
must be regulated to prevent the emulsion from entering 
tube E. 

While this is proceeding the CHC1 3 in the flask A 
is vigorously heated and evaporates through the arm F 
and is liquified by the condenser. The increased volume 
of CHC1 3 in the extractor causes the CHC1 3 to rise in E 
and spill over into the flask. 

Within 2 hours all the CHC1 3 soluble material in 
the urine has been extracted and concentrated in flask A. 

The flask is then disconnected and 5 c.c. of peanut 
or sesame oil added to the CHC1 3 extract and the CHC1 3

removed in v.acuo. 

The chloroform-free extract is now ready for assay. 

We modified the procedure in that we extracted for 
3 hours and added the CHC1 3 fraction from B to that 
from A. This was to insure total extraction and incor¬ 
poration of all extracted material. 

We employed sesame oil throughout. 

Method of fl.ssav 

Although a number of other methods have been tried 
(45)(46), the most satisfactory method of assay for 
estrogenic substance is the rat vaginal smear method 
of Allen and Doisey (47). 

Young adult female rats are spayed and smears taken 
one week later. The rats are not used for assay until 
all are definitely negative. Any that do not give a 
negative slide after several days are discarded. 

We use the following criteria for the classification 
of vaginal smears:- 

I. Preponderance of leucocytes associated with a 
few compact and squamous cells. Fig. I. 

II. Predominance of compact cells with a few 
squamous cells and leucocytes. Fig. II: 

II+. Compact cells only in large numbers of a 
characteristic appearance with the stained part drawn 
in, leaving a white ring around the cell or part of

it. Fig, III. 

III. Predominance of squamous cells with a few 
leucocytes and compact cells. Fig. IV. 

IV. Squamous cells only. Fig. V. 

I and II are interpreted as negative. 

11+, III and IV are interpreted as positive. 

The category of 11+ was included after an examination 
of a large number of smears. It was found that this 
type of smear was often seen preceding or following 
a slide of complete cornification. It was therefore 
considered sound to assume that if a slide of this type 
was seen the rat could be considered positive, as it 
must be either passing into or out of estrus. 

Experiments were done to determine the time of 
maximum response after injection. It was found satis¬ 
factory to take smears on the second, third and fourth 
days after injection. See Table I. 

The material is administered in one injection 
subcutaneously under the loose skin of the flank. Ten 
rats are employed for each assay wherever the size of the 
dose permits. As an initial dose 0.2 c.c. of the 5 c.c. 
of extract is given. If there is no response with this, 
a larger dose is employed. If all the rats are positive, 
a smaller dose is given. The dose is varied until some 
of the rats are positive and some negative.

Where there is no response with a dose up to 0.4 c.c. 
the result is reported as "negative with a dose of 0.4 c.c! f , 
as this would be indicative of an excretion less than ly. 
However in some instances where, by examination of other 
urines from the same patient, a low value is expected, 
a larger initial dose is given and injections up to 1 c.c. 
used. In these larger doses fewer rats than ten must 
necessarily be injected. In cases where the extract is 
very potent, it is necessary to dilute an aliquot of the 
extract with more sesame oil. 

As a standard, crystalline estradiol benzoate in 
sesame oil was used. G-roups of rats were injected with 
various concentrations of estradiol benzoate to determine 
the smallest quantity of material which would produce 
the maximum response. This is considered to be the dose 
which is just sufficient to bring all of a group of 
rats into oestrus. Nine out of ten rats came into full 
oestrus with a dose of 0.0824y of estradiol benzoate. As 
this figure represents a potency higher than is usually 
reported for this substance (48), and nine out of ten 
rats were positive, it was considered expedient to use 
O.lr as a basis for comparison throughout. This figure 
has advantages with regard to ease of calculation and 
convertibility (I.TJ. = O.lr)*

In order to test the method of extraction, varying 
amounts of aqueous estrone solutions were added to samples 
of urine, extracted and assayed. No augmentation was 
found. Some of the crystalline estrone in oil was 
therefore injected but again no response was elicited. 

It was concluded that the material (which had been stored 
for a considerable length of time) had lost potency. 

Experiments of a like nature were then carried out 
using estradiol benzoate, with reasonable recovery after 
extraction. 

500 c.c. H 2 0 + 5 c.c. Est. Benzoate solution - 10/10 rats 
+ with 0.4 c.c. 

500 c.c. male urine + 5 c.c. Est. Benzoate solution ■ 8/l0 
rats + with 0.4 c.c. 

It will be noted a lower potency was recovered when 
the estradiol benzoate was added to male urine and 
extracted than when it was added to water. This suggests 
the possibility of estrus inhibiting substance in male 
urine. 

The CHC1 3 extracts prepared from different urines 
varied considerably in the amount and color of solid 
material. This is material soluble in CHC1 3 but not in 
oil. Pregnancy urines tend to have more extraneous 
material than the others examined. The amount bears no 
relationship to potency.

Variable amounts of toxic substance are extracted 
along with estrogenic substance from urine. Whether or 
not the toxicity is due to the solid material mentioned 
above is not known. It may be in part, but the amount 
of dark brown or reddish material does not always 
parallel toxicity. Some of the extracts examined were 
fatal to rats in doses of 0.1 c.c., while others showed 
no toxic effects up to 1.0 c.c. 

One sample contained a very large amount of a white 
crystalline material in the CHC1 3 extract. This material 
was isolated and identified as hippuric acid. When this 
extract was injected it was found to be quite toxic to 
the rats. Several other extracts had smaller amounts of 
this substance. Hippuric acid, may be one of the toxic 
substances extracted by CHC1 3 ; but there may also be 
others which we have not been able to isolate. 

After injection, particularly of a large dose, the 
rats are often lethargic and eat and drink very little, 
but usually recover after a short time. 

As well as the Leiboff method of extraction for 
estrogenic substance we carried out some experiments 
using the method of Callow (10)( flow sheet #1). This 
method is primarily designed for the extraction of 
androgens, but the first stage of extraction removes 
estrogens as well. These may be separated from the

androgen fraction as indicated in the flow sheet #1. 

It was hoped that by some modification of this 
method a satisfactory assay for both estrogens and 
androgens might be carried out on a single sample. 

Callow does not claim a total yield of estrogens by this 
method. The mild hydrolysis does not liberate all the 
combined estrogenic material; and the introduction of 
a stronger hydrolysis would cause destruction of the 
androgens. 

We carried out several experiments on the aqueous 
residue after the CC1 4 fractions had been removed. An 
aliquot of this residue was subjected to the Leiboff 
extraction and assayed. In all cases the amount extracted 
was too small to elicit response in the highest doses 
administered. 

It was hoped that by adding the value for estrogen 
of this fraction to that obtained by the Callow procedure 
that this total would represent the total estrogen con¬ 
tent as determined by the Leiboff method. Theoretically 
this is correct but in view of the lengthy assay using 
two methods and the fact that the extract from the urine 
residue is very weak and requires very large doses with 
variable and frequently toxic effects, the method was 
found to be impractical. 

A table of the results obtained by assay on various 





-27- 


conditions of endocrine disturbance is appended. Where 
two methods of assay on the same urine were carried out, 
the results are apposed for comparison. 

It will be noted that the results obtained by the 
method after Callow are very much lower than those 
obtained by the Leiboff method (Tablel). Only about 
14% of the potency is thus determined. This method can 
be considered then of no practical value. 

The cases of threatened abortion receiving progesterone 
show a great variety of excretory values - from an amount 
too small to be determined (less than ly) to 160r. 

It has been reported (19) that the excretion of 
estrogens rises steadily as normal pregnancy advances 
(Chart II). The low values obtained in the cases of 
threatened abortion receiving progesterone may be of 
significance. The threatened abortion may be a result 
of an estrogen deficiency as well as of progesterone 
which was augmented by injection. On the other hand 
the low excretion of estrogen may be a result of the 
inj ection of lutocylin, as it may have an inhibiting 
effect on the anterior pituitary and depress the 
gonadotropic hormone, with consequent diminution of 
estrogen secretion. If progesterone administration 
inhibits the production of necessary estrogen, then the 
low values observed in these patients who were unable

to carry to term even with adequate progesterone, are 
of significance. The effect of estrogens in priming 
tissue for progestational action is well known, so it 
is possible that a certain amount of estrogen is neces¬ 
sary for a satisfactory tissue response from administered 
progesterone in threatened abortion. 

Only one (Mrs. I.N.) of the cases of threatened or 
habitual abortion was successful in carrying to term. 

Of the three cases of amenorrhoea, two were 
extremely low while the third, who had been receiving 
injections of estradiol dipropionate was considerably 
higher although still in the low normal range. 

The two cases of menorrhagia had low normal figures. 
This would indicate that the menorrhagia was not due 
to excessive estrogen secretion. 

The case of virilism had an excretion value in the 
low normal extreme. 

The cases of eunuchoidism and the case of Cushing’s 
syndrome had very low excretion values.

Section III 

ANDROGENS 

Androgens like estrogens are excreted partly in the 
combined state in which they are inactive (7). However 
a much milder hydrolysis than is required for estrogens 
must be employed, to avoid destruction of freed androgen. 

The literature describes a great variety of ex¬ 
tractors using various solvents. We adopted the method 
of extraction and purification described by Callow (10), 
as it has several advantages:- 

1. It requires no special apparatus. 

2. A non inflammable solvent, CC1 4 is used. 

3. It embodies a mild hydrolysis. 

4. The extracted androgens are removed from the 
action of the acid. 

5. The procedure is of relatively short duration - 
6 hours. 

One disadvantage of this method is that it is not 
continuous. Three extractions with fresh solvent are 
necessary. 

The steps in this procedure are described in Flow 
Sheet #1. 

A few preliminary experiments were done with the 
charcoal purification in absolute alcohol solution but 
this did not give as clear a solution as that obtained

when purification was done in ether solution (step #19 - 
flow sheet #1). 

Consolazio and Talbott (58) report a 25% higher 
result using CC1 4 as the solvent for purification and 
decolorization. 

This claim was investigated and an increase of 26.2% 
over the previous method found.

This 

procedure, as well 

as yielding higher 

results, 


shortens the purification considerably by eliminating the 
two steps using benzene and ether. This method was 
adopted (flow sheet #2). 

The method of assay we employed is a modified 
Zimmerman (49) reaction with meta-di-nitro-benzene as 
the color reagent. This reaction is not specific for 
urinary androgens. However it has been shown that the 
intensity of color production is parallel to biologic 
activity (50)(51). The advantages of the colorimetric 
assay are great with respect to ease of operation, 
sensitivity, high reproductibility and low error.

W© tried some preliminary experiments on the method 
of Oesting (51) using crystalline androsterone. We did 
not find satisfactory color production by this method 
as color intensity did not consistently represent known 
androgenic content. 

We then tried the method of Friedgood (54) with 
satisfactory results. This method was used throughout. 

1. Reagents 

2% m-dinitrobenzene* in absolute EtOH. 

15% aqueous KOH. 

2. Apparatus 

The Hellige - Oesting Hormone Comparator consists 
of a revolving disc containing different colored glass 
plates, surmounting a colorimeter of two tubes. The 
blank tube is placed at the right and the unknown at 
the left. The disc is revolved until a color is found 
which changes the color of the blank tube to a color 
comparable to the unknown. The strength of the unknown 
is then read directly off the disc in color units (1 
color unit is equivalent to 10r androsterone). 

3. Procedure 

Aliquot portions of the alcoholic hormone solution 
are measured into test tubes and the alcohol evaporated 
off carefully over a water bath at 70 - 75°C. After

cooling to room temperature, 0.15 c.c. of 95% EtOH, 

0.2 c.c. of 2% m-dinitrobenzene in absolute EtOH and 
0.2 c.c. of 15% aqueous KOH are added to each tube. 

The contents are mixed thoroughly. At the same time 
a control tube containing similar amounts of the two 
reagents and alcohol is prepared. The tubes are placed 
in the dark in a water bath at precisely 25°C for 75 
minutes, with occasional shaking. The contents of the 
tube are then diluted to 7 c.c. with 95% EtOH. After 
being thoroughly mixed they are compared immediately 
in the Oesting colorimeter. 

There are a number of variables affecting color 
production that must be standardized for consistent 
results. These variables are : - percentage of 
m-dinitrobenzene, dilution and alkalinity of reaction 
mixture, duration, light and temperature. A number of 
techniques have been reported using different standards 
of control of these variables (51)(52)(53)(54)(55). 

4. Experimental 

A series of tests was run to determine the effect 
on color production of fresh and old solutions of 
m-dinitrobenzene and KOH. The results are recorded in 
Table III. 

As the reagent m-dinitrobenzene solution ages the 
depth of the red color increases in both the unknown

and the blank. At a month comparison is unsatisfactory 
due to the appearance of brown pigments; at five months 
impossible. 

The KOH solution gives satisfactory results up to 
a month. At five months the solution is very cloudy. 

The m-dinitrobenzene solution should be made up 
fresh every two weeks; the KOH solution every month. 

We first standardized the discs with crystalline 
androsterone. It was found that the color production 
is proportional to the amount of hormone present. The 
most effective range of the colorimeter is above 1.4 C.U. 
The lower limits are variable, as the extent of color 
change is not great per unit of hormone. The point at 
which the maximum color change per unit of hormone is 
observed is between 2.8 and 3.4 C.U. Therefore this 
range is the most effective and is used throughout 
wherever possible. Colors that fall between that of 
two color discs are given a value half way between the 
two discs. 

The results obtained in standardizing the color 
discs are shown in Table IY and Chart III.

Some other crystalline hormones were assayed for 
color production. 

a p diethyl stilboestrol produced no color. 

Progesterone produced a brownish color which was 
not comparable in the colorimeter. 

Testosterone was much weaker per unit weight than 
androsterone and the color produced was not a good match 
in the colorimeter. 

Estrone gave a satisfactory color of a potency 
practically identical with androsterone weight for weight. 

Dehydroandrosterone gave a good color comparison 
of slightly higher (10%) intensity than androsterone 
weight for weight. 

For a comparison of the color produced by these 
compounds and androsterone see Table V. 

Urines from normal and abnormal individuals of both 
sexes were extracted and estimated by the method outlined. 
In many of the tests brownish pigment appeared that 
masked the red of the reaction and made a comparison 
difficult. This is particularly noticable in extracts 
of weak potency where large amounts of the alcoholic 
solution were used. 

Table VI presents the results obtained in normal 
urine.

The average for normal males is 11.76 mg./24 hrs. 
This is slightly higher than that reported by Drips and 
Osterberg (8) who report an average of 9.3 mg./24 hrs. 

The average for normal females is 9.45 mg./24 hrs. 
This is also slightly higher than that reported by Drips 
and Osterberg who report an average of 7.4 mg./24 hrs. 

It will be noted that some of the normal male 
excretion figures fall below the average normal female 
excretion. This overlapping between sexes of excreted 
androgen values has been noted by other workers (5)(8) 

(7)(10). 

The color of the CC1 4 extracts varied from a deep 
cherry red to a pale orangey yellow. The depth of 
color bears no relationship to androgenic potency as 
can be seen from Table V. 

In order to show daily fluctuation in the same 
individual more clearly, the results obtained in the 
assay of urine from subject M.H. and J.N. are represented 
in Chart IV. 

The subject M.H. varies during the week from a high 
of 13.20 mg./24 hrs. to a low of 8.17 mg./24 hrs.; with 
an average of 10.25 mg./24 hrs. 

The subject J.N. varies from 14.43 mg./24 hrs. to 
12.00 mg./24 hrs. with an average of 13.26 mg./24 hrs. 

These values are higher than reported by Koch (7)

for variation in normal individuals (20 - 69 I. U./day) 
but approximate limits for males as reported by a number 
of workers (5)(7)(8)(10). 

With these normals as a basis for comparison an 
examination of the results obtained from the urine of 
abnormal subjects can be made. The excretion values 
in the abnormal cases are recorded in Table VII. 

The cases of threatened abortion receiving lutocylin 
by injection have a subnormal excretion of androgens. 
Three cases of hypogonadism, one case of Cushing 1 s 
Syndrome and one castrate examined also have a lower 
than normal rate of excretion. The case of eunuchoidism 
had an excretion figure within normal limits. After 
receiving 10 mg. of testosterone propionate three times 
a week for 9 days, the excretion figure was raised from 
11.69 to 13.16 mg./24 hrs. 

In some cases assays were done on the same urine 
for both estrogenic and androgenic substance. The 
results in these instances are contained in Table VIII. 

The Androgen/Estrogen ratio in the cases of 
threatened abortion varies over a wide range and is 
on the average very low. The cases of eunuchoidism 
show a ratio much higher but again considerable variation 


is found.

Thirteen normal urines were left at room temperature 
for several days and then extracted for androgens. The 
CC1 4 in all cases was withdrawn from the urine. Of 
these CCI 4 extracts, three were assayed immediately; 
the other ten were left at room temperature in the 
light for seven months and then assayed. The results 
are presented in Table IX. Values obtained from normal, 
freshly extracted, freshly assayed urine are included 
for comparison. (Taken from Table VI). 

It will be noted that the average of the values 
obtained from urine that has stood 4-5 days and 
assayed immediately (0.70 mg.) is very much lower 
than that obtained when fresh urine is assayed immedi¬ 
ately (11.76 mg.). This indicates that urines should 
be extracted fresh for optimum efficiency. Many workers 
are in agreement with this observation (43). 

On the other hand the urines which were left 
4-5 days and extracted and left in CC1 4 for seven 
months show an average figure (12.94 mg.) approximating 
that of freshly extracted urine immediately assayed, 
(11.76 mg.). The one female urine so treated is higher 
(19.76 mg.) than the freshly extracted and assayed female 
urine we examined (9.45 mg.); or male urine (11.76 mg.). 

The effect of urine standing before extraction may 
be to combine some of the color producing substance

in a form in which it exhibits less color value. This 
material may be extracted by the CC1 4 and on standing 
before assay, be reconverted to its original color 
producing form; or it may be converted to another 
compound having similar or higher color value. 

Similar unexplained increases in the ketosteroid 
content of urine extracts when assayed by Zimmermann 
reaction after storage of these substances in 95 % 
alcohol, have been noted by Friedgood and Berman, (59). 

It was decided to investigate the possibility of 
time and temperature increasing the color producing 
power of fresh extracts. A large amount of urine was 
extracted fresh and aliquots of the CC1 4 fraction, in 
various stages of purification were left at different 
temperatures for varying lengths of time. 

Up to two months aliquots left, at room temperature, 
at 50 °C and at 65°C showed no change from an aliquot 
assayed immediately after extraction. Table X. 

Two aliquots were refluxed on a water bath for 
48 hours and 206 hours respectively. In neither was 
there any effect on the assay. Table X. 

These results show the stability to heat and time 
of freshly extracted androgens in CC1 4 . 

Three androgen extracts in absolute EtOH were 
retested after standing seven months at room temperature.

Experiments were done on androgenic extracts in 
absolute EtOH left at room temperature in daylight, 
and at 50°C and at 65°C in ovens. Up to three months 
no change in color potency was found. Table X. 

Urinary androgens in absolute EtOH must be stable 
for three months at temperatures up to 65°C.

Section 4 

EFFECT OF ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT AND CHLORINE GAS ON ANDROGENS 
Our experiments with heat and time did not throw 
any light on the mechanism for the apparent increase 
in color value of an extract from 4-5 day old urine, 
after it has stood seven months. Therefore it was 
decided to investigate the effect of ultra violet light 
on androgen solutions. 

Preliminary irradiations were performed with the 
solution 2.5 feet from the light source. At this dis¬ 
tance little effect was noted (Table XI). At 10.5 inches 
a marked and consistent effect was elicited (Table XI). 

This distance (10.5 inches) from source of light to 
solution was therefore used throughout.

The solutions of androgen irradiated were of four 

types 

1. Crystalline androsterone in absolute EtOK. 

2. Crystalline androsterone in CC1 4 . 

3. Urinary androgen in absolute EtOH. 

4. Urinary androgen in CC1 4 . 

The values obtained are included in Table XII and 
are presented graphically in Chart V. 

Discussion 

1. Crystalline androsterone in absolute EtOH on exposure 
to ultra violet light shows an initial rapid destruction 
followed by a more gradual loss. 

2. Crystalline androsterone in CC1 4 is destroyed very 
rapidly by ultra violet light. Thirty seconds exposure 
in CC1 4 causes as much destruction as thirty minutes in 
absolute EtOH. 

3. Urinary androgen in absolute EtOH is not destroyed 

as rapidly as crystalline androsterone in the same solvent. 
This indicates that urinary androgen is more stable to 
ultra violet light than crystalline androsterone. 

4. Urinary androgen in CC1 /, is destroyed much more 
rapidly than in absolute EtOH. It is not destroyed 
nearly as rapidly as crystalline androsterone in CC1 4 . 

This evidence indicates greater stability of urinary 
androgen to ultra violet light than crystalline

androsterone. 

When Group 4 is compared to Group 3, and Group 2 
is compared to Group 1, it is evident that there is a 
very much more rapid destruction of androgen in CC1 4 
than in EtOH. As alcohol offers no resistance to ultra 
violet light, the destruction curve obtained when 
androgens were irradiated in this solvent represents 
the maximum destruction per unit of time brought about 
by ultra violet. It would seem therefore that the 
greater destruction in CC1 4 must be due to a chemical 
reaction initiated by ultra violet light. 

Lyons and Dickinson (56) showed that CC1 4 is 
decomposed by ultra violet into phosgene and chlorine. 

The reaction is represented by the equation:- 
2CC1 4 + 0 2 -> 2C0C1 2 + 2C1 2 

It was thought that one or both of the products 
of this decomposition (phosgene and chlorine) might 
be reacting with the androgen. To test this suggestion, 
dry chlorine gas was bubbled through solutions of 
crystalline androsterone. 

The results are contained in Table XIII. 

It will be seen that contrary to expectation chlorine 
gas has an activating effect on the color production of 
androsterone as measured by the Zimmerman reaction. 


The effect of phosgene has yet to be investigated.

Our experiments with the effect of chlorine gas on 

androgens open certain avenues for further investigation:- 

1. Effect of other halogens on the reaction. 

2. Effect of chlorine and other halogens on some of 
the closely related ketosteroids. 

3. Does enhanced color production as measured by 
Zimmermann reaction indicate also enhanced biologic 
activity? 

4. Does chlorine effect indicate the possibility of 
chloride effect, as suggested by Butenandt?(57).

EFFECT OF ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT ON THE PURPLE COLOR 
OF URINARY ANDROGENS IN CC1 4 . 

The purple color of urinary androgens in CC1 4 
isoonverted to orange on 5 minutes exposure to ultra 
violet light, and to yellow in eleven minutes. The 
yellow color is due to a flocculent precipitate. When 
this is removed by filtration, the filtrate is water 
clear. 

It was also noted that the solutions of urinary 
androgens left at room temperature in daylight for three 
months changed in color. The solutions that had been 
washed with NaHC0 3 and NaOH prior to standing, were 
colorless; those that had been left in the impure state 
had changed from purple to a pale rose. Aliquots left 
in the ice box and ovens, in the dark, had not changed 
in color. It can therefore be considered that the 
bleaching is due to daylight. 

As previously mentioned, during irradiation of 
CC1 4 solutions of urinary androgens a light brown 
flocculent precipitate forms. It is water soluble and 
gives a positive test for chloride. This precipitate 
appears even in solutions which have been purified and 
decolorized before irradiation. Solutions of crystalline 
androsterone which have been irradiated show no such 
precipitate. The source and exact nature of this 
precipitate are as yet undetermined.

Summary 

1. A survey has been made of the literature* 

2. A standard method for extraction, purification and 
assay of urinary estrogens and androgens is suggested. 

(a) Estrogens. The method for extraction and 
purification of estrogens is based on that 
of Leiboff. The rat smear bioassay of Allen 
and Doisey is employed, with an improved 
system of smear classification. 

(b) Androgens. The method for extraction and 
purification of androgens is based on that 
of Callow as modified by Consolazio and 
Talbott. Androgen activity is measured in 
an Oesting colorimeter using the Zimmerman 
reaction as adopted by Freidgood. 

3. Tables of excretory values of estrogens and androgens 
in normal and abnormal individuals are included. 

(a) Estrogens. Cases of threatened abortion 

receiving progesterone varied from <1.0 to 
160.Oy estradiol benzoate/24 hrs. 

Amenorrhoea <1.0 to 3.62y estradiol benz./24 hrs. 
Menorrhagia 1.05 to 4.50y 
Eunuchoidism and Cushing’s disease l.Oy 
estradiol benz./24 hrs.

Normal females 8.70 to 10.21 mg./24 hrs. as 
androsterone. 

Threatened abortion receiving progesterone 
0.39 to 1.50 mg./24 hrs. as androsterone. 
Hypogonad males 0.25 to 13.16 mg./24 hrs. as 
androsterone. 

Cushing’s syndrome 2.98 to 3.20 mg./24 hrs. as 
androsterone. 

These values are in fair agreement with other 
reported values where figures are available. 

4. The effect of time, heat, ultra violet light and 
chlorine gas on solutions of androgens has been 
investigated. 

(a) Time. Androgen solutions are stable up to three 
months. After seven months anomalous results 
were obtained. 

(b) Heat. No change in activity was found after 
refluxing androgen solutions in CC1 4 for 206 
hours; or after leaving them in an oven at 
65°C for three months. 

(c) Ultra violet light. Androgens are destroyed 
by ultra violet light much more rapidly in CC1 4 
than in EtOH. Urinary androgens are more

stable to ultra violet light than is crystalline 
androsterone. 

(d) Chlorine. The potency of androgen solutions as 
measured by Ziramermann reaction is enhanced by 
chlorine gas.
