A GEJSETIC STUDY OF 

THE CONVERSION EXPERIENCE OF THE APOSTLE PAUL. 

To students of sacred biography the story of the con¬ 
version of the Apostle Paul is one of exceptional interest. This 
fact is easily accounted for when we remember that the subject of 
the story holds a place in the history of Christianity second on¬ 
ly to that of the Founder Himself. The profound religious ex¬ 
perience which made such a distinction possible could hardly fail 
to be a topic of absorbing interest. 

In our study of Paul’s conversion we shall consider, 
first, the historical records of the event; secondly, the inter¬ 
pretation which Paul put upon it; and thirdly, the event in the 
light of modern scientific analysis. 

First, then, as to the historical narratives. There are 
three of these accounts in Acts, one by the author (9:1-19) and 
two which purport to be by Paul himself (£2:6-16; £6:12-18). 

There is one account in the epistle to the Galatians (1:11-17), 
and there are two distinct references to the event in the first 
epistle to the Corinthians (9:1; 15:8). Let us first consider 
the testimony of the epistles, the unquestioned references of 
Paul himself. According to Galatians, Paul’s conversion occurred 
in or near Damascus, and had been immediately preceded by zealous 
persecution of the Church. The occasion of the change was the 
revelation of the Son of God In himm Paul departed at once into 
Arabia; his career as a persecutor was instantly abandoned. The 
reference in I Corinthians 9:1 Is plainly to the same event of 
which Galatians 1:16 speaks. For Paul derives his apostleship

from the fact that he has seen the Lord. In I Corinthians 15: 4-8 
the Apostle is speaking of the appearances of the risen Jesus 
which confirmed the Scripture teaching that He should rise. After 
appearing to Cephas, to the twelve, to more than five hundred "breth¬ 
ren, to James, and to all the apostles. He appeared to Paul. The 
following verse suggests that when Jesus appeared to Paul he was a 
persecutor of the Church. This fact is evidence that the vision 
here mentioned is to be identified with that of I Corinthians 11: 1 
and Galatians 1: 16. 

In the three accounts of Paul's conversion which we have 
in Acts the differences are fairly numerous; but it is to be espe¬ 
cially noticed that the differences betweesi the two accounts which 
are attributed are as £ r eat as the differences between 

these two and that of Luke. Thus, for example, the account of the 
twenty-sixth chapter says nothing about Ananias, and represents the 
commission of Jesus as being given to Paul in the hour of his con¬ 
version, while in the twenty-second chapter the commission is given 
by Ananias in Damascus. When we compare these two accounts with 
Luke's, the principal differences noted are that Luke alone speaks 
of a three days’ blindness and a three days' fast of Paul; that he 
alone speaks of a vision to Ananias and another to Paul; and that 
he alone makes it part of the purpose of Ananias' visit that Paul 
might be filled with the Holy Spirit. There are also discrepancies 
between Luke's account of the external phenomena and the account 
which is attributed to Paul. For example, Luke says that the men 
stood while the voice spake, but in Paul's account it is said that 
all fell to the ground. Luke also says that the men with Paul 
heard the voice, while in the later narrative it is said that they 
heard not the voice of him who spake to Paul. These two details

as also the fact that in chapter twenty-two the commission comes 
to Paul from the lips of Ananias in Damascus, while in chapter 
twenty-six it comes from the lips of Jesus outside Damascus, are 
plainly inconsistent with absolute historicity, hut they do not 
militate against the general trustworthiness of the narrative. 

We turn now to the agreements of the narratives in Acts 
First, they agree that there was some sort of external phenomenon 
connected with Paul 1 s conversion. His eyes w r ere blinded and his 
companions saw a light. It is perhaps uncertain whether for the 
companions of Paul the external phenomenon was anything more than 
light. Again, the narratives in Acts agree in the representation 
that Paul saw, with his physical eyes, nothing hut the light. 

They all say that he fell to the ground when the great light shone 
upon him, and that it was while he lay there prostrate that he 
heard the voice. But his physical eyes were blinded by the glory 
of the light, and therefore they beheld nothing while he was lying 
upon the earth. Further, the narratives in Acts agree that Paul 
met Jesus near Damascus, and since they preclude a physical seeing 
of Him, we must hold that they desire to represent Paul as having a 
spiritual vision of Jesus. 

The next question to be considered is Paul’s interpreta¬ 
tion of his conversion experience. At the very outset it may be 
said that modern psychological analysis of religion had no place 
in Paul's world; hence the question so often raised today as to 
the ultimate ground of his experience was never ashed by him. He 
describes the Damascus incident once with the word which occurs 
in the beptuagint as a technical expression for appearances of the 
Divinity, and which he also uses with reference to the appearances 
of Christ to the other apostles. "He appeared to me also." It

was the living Christ who appeared, and Paul hints that the mani¬ 
festation of Christ to him was the last in the series. Another 
time he says, with still more of ancient vividness, "I have seen 
Jesus our Lord"; or he confesses, "I was apprehended hy Christ 
Jesus". A fourth time he says in more general terms that the mys¬ 
tery of Christ was made known to him by revelation. In his memory 
of what happened near Damascus there was always the impression of 
"the sudden and irresistible shining within him of a bright light 
comparable to the first shining of light on the world, and flash¬ 
ing upon him the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of 
Christ." Plainly, then, the Apostle regarded his conversion as a 
striking and sudden transformation, due to a revelation of God’s 
Son in him. To quote Deissmann: "An experience which Paul looks 
upon as caused by God, which betokens with absolute certainty that 
the living Christ has been revealed to him, or that he himself has 
been taken possession of by Christ, and which includes also the in¬ 
ward transformation and at the same time apostolic commission of 
the man who hitherto had been a persecutor--all this the event near 
Damascus was to Paul himself". 

It may be noted in passing that Paul’s view as to the 
suddenness of the transformation wrought in him is not without sup¬ 
port among modern writers. They find in the period antecedent to 
the conversion little or no struggle, and in the conversion itself 
they see nothing more than the case of one who, previously an un¬ 
believer in the Messiahship of Jesus, had at length been brought to 
acknowledge that Jesus was the Christ, through a miraculous demon¬ 
stration that he was still alive. Thus, for example, the author 
of "St. Paul and His Mission to the Roman Empire" writes: "whatever 
inward troubles may have afflicted Saul, whatever compunction the

fcke tortures which he inflicted may have awakened in his own 
breast, the narrative of Luke, and still more Paul’s own emphatic 
testimony, negative the theory that his conversion was merely the 
culmination of a severe mental struggle, the triumph of one or two 
conflicting forces which had long been battling within him. His 
conversion was a moral miracle as sudden and striking as the physi¬ 
cal portents which accompanied it". Squally convinced as to the 
truth of this view is Hr. Whyte who declares that "not only had 
Paul no sense of sin to prepare him for his conversion; he had no 
preparation and no fitness for his conversion of any kind whatever. 
He brought nothing in his hands." 

Such a theory is surely unsatisfactory. God had indeed 
been at work in Paul’s life. He had called him from his birth 
(Galatians 1: 15). As Bruce says:"It would be nearer the truth to 
say that on the day Saul of Tarsus was converted his spiritual de¬ 
velopment, to a large extent, lay behind him. His preparation for 
the change had been so thorough that the convert leaped at a bound 
into a larger cosmopolitan idea of Christianity, its nature and 
destination". 

What that preparation involved: we shall, in the third, 
place, endeavor to investigate. Our study will include the follow¬ 
ing topics: (1) environment; (E) temperament; (3) the Apostle’s 
experience. 

(1) The Apostle’s Environment. 

Paul was a native of Tarsus in Cilicia, a city famous for 
its university life and Grecian culture. According to Strabo, its 
university excelled all the schools of the time, not excepting even 
those of Athens and Alexandria. Tarsus was also the mart of trade

and commerce for the mountain cities. Its situation was favorable; 
a navigable stream gave direct access to the Mediterranean; it had 
communication on the one hand with Syria, and on the other with the 
lands beyond the Taurus, and its trade was therefore considerable. 
How profound an impression the very mercantile life of Tarsus made 
on Paul*s young mind may be gathered from the fact that his mode of 
thought and many of his metaphors and illustrations are drawn from 
it. 

Paul is made to declare himself (Acts 21; 39) to be a Jew 
of Tarsus; that explains in this passage his being able to speak 
Greek. His phrase, f! a Hebrew of the Hebrews", need not imply that 
his parents spoke Aramaic, though that may have been the case; Paul 
himself uses Aramaic words, and is said (Acts 21: 40) to have ad¬ 
dressed his audience at Jerusalem in that tongue. He belonged at 
any rate to the Diaspora, and we may now point out what that im¬ 
plied in his religious experience. 

The Jews living in Greek cities had a different outlook 
on the world from those in Palestine; they were not oppressed, but 
held for the most part a good position; the Gentiles around them 
respected them on account of their pure religion. The Jeirs in such 
towns were in a manner missionaries to the Gentiles, and many of the 
considerations that are still weighed in missionary circles as to 
the attraction of the true religion for those outside, and as to the 
hindrances which kept them from joining it, would no doubt be dis¬ 
cussed among them and made familiar to the sharp wits among their 
children. Paul could not fail to learn at Tarsus what Gentile re¬ 
ligion was, how much of natural goodness lived in heathen minds, 
how they were led (1 Corinthians 12: 2) to follow dumb idols which 
could not satisfy them, what an incubus the law was to missionary

effort, how the demand of circumcision was a special harrier. 

Moreover, Paul was a Homan citizen, freeborn. Of this he 
made proud boast, and called his citizenship to his service more 
than once in the perils of after years. It also had its influence 
on him intellectually and widened the horizon of his thoughts. The 
magnificent organization of the Empire, the majesty of its law, and 
its all-embracing power, made their silent impression upon his mind, 
and guided him to characteristic ideas of a universal spiritual sway 
still mightier and nobler. "Law and justice", says Harnack, "radi¬ 
ated from Home to the provinces, and in their light nationalities 
faded away, because the moral spirit can never find its satisfaction 

in that which is realized. The Church by her preaching would 

never have gained whole circles, but only individuals, had not the 
universal State already produced a neutralizing of nationalities 
and brought men nearer each other in temper and disposition”. 

Our knowledge regarding the family of Paul is very meagre. 

He never mentions father or mother, brother or sister. That his 
father was a Homan citizen, we know from Paul f s word to the chief cap¬ 
tain; but we cannot infer from the fact of citizenship that he had at 
least moderate wealth. Manumitted slaves were frequently presented 
with citizenship. On the other hand, the fact that Paul learned a 
trade is not evidence thau his family was poor, for the Jewish rabbis 
taught that it was a man’s duty to teach his son a trade. Some writers 
hold that Paul did not come from the literary upper class, but from 
the non-literary-artisan classes, and that he remained with them. 

But more important from our present standpoint is the ques¬ 
tion of Paul’s religious training. He was brought up in the Jewish 
faith and belonged to the straitest sect of the Pharisees. To the end

of his days Judaism remained one of the influential factors in his 
life. In the synagogue at Tarsus the Septuagint was used. This is the 
version in Hellenistic Greek of the Old Testament, said to have been 
made by seventy-two translators at Alexandria in the third century, 

B. C. To understand the whole of Paul, from the point of view of 
religious history, we must know the spirit of the Septuagint; for it 
is the faith contained therein that supplies the historic premises of 
Paul T s piety. The exegesis that he bestowed upon the Greek Bible shows 
us very vividly Paul the Jew. It is the exegesis of a completely 
authoritative document. Although Paul regards a part of this document, 
the Law, as repealed in Christ, he does occasionally quote passages of 
the Law with the weighty and significant words, "It is written". What 
is written cannot be called in question; every quotation from Scripture 
is a prodf from Scripture. To the instruction which he received in the 
Greek Bible, Paul would add a knowledge of the oral tradition the author¬ 
ity of Ttfhich was likewise beyond dispute. He would acquaint himself 
also with the various interpretation of this tradition. Paul received 
his rabbinical education at Jerusalem, in the school of Gamaliel, a man 
held in reputation among all the Jews. Tradition represents him as hum¬ 
ble minded, one who served those who were inferior to him in rank. In 
the Book of Acts, Gamaliel appears as a man of courage, and yet concil¬ 
iatory, a man of somewhat liberal mind, and the most influential person 
in the Sanhedrin. We can form only a general idea of the ■substance and 
the method of the education which Paul received in the school of Gama¬ 
liel. The work of such a school was chiefly memorizing. The teacher 
repeated again and again an explanation of a passage of Scripture, and 
the scholars were required to commit it to memory. The ideal of the 
student was to be like a well-plastered cistern, which loses no drop of 

water which is put into it. How long this course of study continued

in the ease of those who aspired to be teachers cannot be definitely 
stated, dome times, at least, according to one authority, it required 
twelve years to complete the course. A student was not qualified to 
teach as the head of a school until he was forty years old and knew tne 
entire traditional law. 

Of the range of Paul’s education and his acquaintance with 

the classics we have no certain knowledge. H© seems to have known 

something of contemporary stoicism; in his speech on Mars Hill he quotes 
the Greek poet Aratus; but there is nothing in his epistles to suggest 

familiarity with classical literature. 'The reasonable conclusion in 

regard to his literary acquirements would appear to be that he had 
probably such a general acquaintance with classical literature as be¬ 
came an Oriental of good education and mental virility, but that on 
the other hand it is unlikely that he fokd a wide and scholarly famil¬ 
iarity with it. 

One other factor peculiar to Paul’s environment may be men¬ 
tioned, namely, the apocalyptic beliefs of Judaism. Jewish apocalyp¬ 
tic had its roots in the hope held up before Israel by her great pro¬ 
phets, particularly in times of national declension and disaster, of 
a glorious day in the future, the "day of the Lord”, when her oppres¬ 
sors should be overthrown, and she, purified by the fires of afflic¬ 
tion, should be exalted to a position of unparalleled splendor and 
power. This national hope proved itself vital enough to survive the 
most disillusioning experiences; but somewhere in the dark days of 
Persian or Greek supremacy it was subjected to radical modification 
and fitted into a world-view widely different from that of the pro¬ 
phets. The new development of Hebrew religion is characterised by a 
thorough-going pessimism. In the eyes of apocalyptic writers the 
world is demon- r i^^® n , given up to wickedness, and the prey of mortal¬ 
ity.

Throngs of evil spirits prosecute their hellish work, thwarting the 
will of the Almighty and hounding on the heathen persecutors of His 
people. The world is regarded as Satan*s rather than God’s. But al¬ 
though the outlook is so gloomy, faith in God and in God's promise to 
Israel is held fast. Only this faith, finding nothing in the present 
to which it can attach itself, takes refuge in a new and glorious 
world which God will feveal when the existing world has been swept a- 
way. That this primitive conception strongly influenced Paul's think¬ 
ing his earlier epistles clearly illustrate. 

(2) The Apostle's Temperament. 

To know the, temperament of a man is to understand one of the 
chief factors of his religious experience. This is especially true 
in the case of Paul. The Damascus event becomes much more intelligible 
to us from a study of the Apostle's particular type of mental consti¬ 
tution. Such a study reveals what someone has called the "great polar 
contradictions" observable in his nature. Pal had room in his person¬ 
ality for opposing principles which, while they would have shattered a 
small man, set up in Paul the high tension which found an outlet in 
the energy he expended on the great work of his life. 

The most obvious of the great contrasts is that which exist¬ 
ed between his ailing body and his physical powers of work. His poor 
body was weak and ill; he speaks of it himself as a Trail earthen ves¬ 
sel, or, being a tentamker, compares it with a light tent-house that 
has no permanency. Better known, however, is his allusion to a severe 
chronic complaint with occasional attacks that were extremely painful. 
He calls this complaint Tf a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan 
to buffet me", and we cannot say for certain what special disease these

symptoms point to. We only know of the thrice-repeated prayer for help, 
to which the answer was vouchsafed, "My grace is sufficient for thee; 
for my power is made perfect in weakness". Power in weakness! Therein, 
lies the contradiction; this frail body is covered with the scars re¬ 
maining from much maltreatment. 

Another of the great contradictions in Paul is that he is of 
great humility, and yet again capable of uttering words of sublime self- 
confidence. Probably the best example of this is found in I Corinthians 
"I am the least of the aposties......But by the grace of God I am what 

I am....I labored more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace 

of God which was with me". These are not empty phrases, but genuine con¬ 
fessions; with an almost Greek ho|?or of arrogance he combines manly con¬ 
sciousness of strength. 

Besides these striking contrasts in his personality, Paul pos¬ 
sessed an undoubted talent for religion. He is one of the few men to 
whom the much abused expression "religious genius" may legitimately be 
applied. His is a mystical nature, and in comparison with this charac¬ 
teristic the theological element vanishes almost entirely. It is true 
he has a horror of the wild excesses of pagan and Christian ecstasy in¬ 
dulged in by unrestrained crowds, and at Corinth, where it once happened 
that a person in a state of ecstasy cursed Christ, he opposed speaking 
with tongues, though he quite approved of it theoretically. But he 
himself is gifted to speak with tongues, and can tell of datable ecstas¬ 
ies and special revelations of his own. Transported into the third 

i 

heaven he has heard "unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man 
to utter”- Or it is vouchsafed him to hear the voices of the upper 
world in words that he can understand, and dreams become to him divine 
inspirations.

(3) The Apostle 1 s Experienee, 

We have attempted thus far to deal with the more^less gener¬ 
al factors in Paul’s religions experience* It remains for us now to 
trace the immediate causes which led up to the crisis, and then to con¬ 
sider the crisis itself. 

As we have already seen, the religion of Paul was Judaism; in 
the practice of that religion he was exceptionally strict. His great 
aim in life was to he legally righteous, and his ambition was to excel 
in that line. Outwardly, as he himself tells us, he obtained the goal 

of legal blameleasnes^as few attained it; and for a time he may have 

felt a measure of self-satisfaction. But if so, a day came when the 
inner meaning of the Law, as extending to the sphere of desire and mo¬ 
tive, came home to him in stern power, and his peace fled (Homans 7;9). 
To the Lav/ he had been taught to look for righteousness. In his exper- 
ience ^ proved but the means to knowledge of sin, without a correspond¬ 
ing impulse towards obedience. Whence, then, is deliverance to come? 

It can only come with the Messianic age and through the Messiah. The 
Law would reign inwardly as outwardly, being v/ritten on the heart as 
promised in prophecy. 

This position having been reached by Paul, how would the mes¬ 
sage, "Jesus is the Messiah", strike such a man? It would seem a blas¬ 
phemous caricature of things most sacred. It is doubtful whether he had 
heard Jesus Himself (II Corinthians 5; 16 has perhaps another meaning). 
He may even have been absent from Jerusalem in the early days of apos¬ 
tolic preaching. But if so, his ardent nature soon brought him. on the 
scene., in time at least to hear Stephen and take part against him.

If the simple message of the first witnesses, that one whose life and 
preaching were largely out of harmony with the Law as daul understood 
it, had in fact been raised from the dead hy Israel 1 s God and so vindi¬ 
cated, if this seemed to Saul mere madness, what was he to say to Steph- 
Qn * s views as to the Lae</and the people of the Law both past and pres¬ 
ent? Stephen could not be right in the views which still divided them. 
Moreover, the death of Jesus could mean but one of two things. Either 
He was accursed of God, or the Law relative to which he was accursed 
was itself.set aside. 

So Saul was driven to persecute, driven by his acute sense of 
the radical issue involved, and perhaps hoping to find relief from his 
own bitter experience in such zeal for the Law. Yet the goading of 
unsatisfied intuitiohs did not cease. It is possible that Stephen* s 
philosophy of Israel’s history had made an impression on him, and was 
undermining his confidence in the infallibility of his nation’s reli¬ 
gious authorities. At any rate, Saul was now finding it "hard to kick 
against the goad" plied in his deeper consciousness, as he followed his 
inherited and less personal beliefs. "Direct personal experience on the 
point on which all hinged, the alleged divine vindication of Jesus as 
Messiah following on the legal condemnation by the national authoritieg, 
was- needful to open up a clear exit from his religious impasse". 

It was at this critical point in his inner history that, as 
he neared Damascus on a mission of persecution, there was granted him-- 
as he believed ever after in the face of all challenge--a vision of Je¬ 
sus in risen and glorified humanity, as objective as those to the orig-* 
inal witnesses with which in I Corinthians 15 he classes it. 

As to the sense in which this vision, so momentous in its is¬ 
sues, may be regarded as "objective", there is still considerable dif¬ 
ference of opinion. Religious faith, dwelling on the unique issues of

the vision in the history of Christianity and arguing from effects to a 

cause as real as themselves, tends to postulate the objectivity which 
Paul himself asserts. On the other hand, analogies furnished by reli¬ 
gious psychology affect our ability to take Paul*s consciousness in the 
matter as a simple transcript of objective #aet. The psychologist—and 
it is with his view we are most eoncerned--insists on the naturalness 
of all such occurrences. Without doubting the facts of the subjective 
experiences, he interprets them according to his wider range of phsy- 
ehological knowledge. Thus the vision of light has its parallel in 
similar photisms that occur in excitement when the sensory nerves are 
in a state of tension. The visions of ang&ls , Cod, Christ, the Virgin, 
etc., and the hearing of voices have their parallel outside the conver¬ 
sion experience in phenomena commonly attributed to emotional and ner¬ 
vous disturbance Joan of Arc or the angels of lions). Further, the 

apparent immediacy and suddenness of the transformation in conversion 
are paralleled in ordinary experience; for example, in sudden bursts of 
recollection, in the sudden solution of a puzzle which one has despaired 
of solving, or in the suddenness with which in the learning of an art 
Jhe conscious laborious effort passes into automatic action. If these 
facts may be explained by the activity of the subconscious mind, so may 
the conversion experience; it is the fructification of v/hat has been 
gradually preparing in the subconscious region. The convert has been 
striving to adjust himself to the new life, and striding in more or 
less wrong directions because still using the self that is to be re¬ 
newed. With the cessation of struggle the deeper and better self which 
has been forming surges up from the subliminal region and takes posses¬ 
sion of the passive mind.

We are thus led to the conclusion that the conversion of the 
Apostle Paul anile a divine work, as measured by results, //as :.o magic¬ 
al or sudden transformation, but that it was "psychologically prepared 
for both negatively and positively* Negatively, by the experiences 
which the soul, of the young Pharisee, in its passionate hunger for 
righteousness, had had under the yoke of the La#. Positively prepared 
for on the one hand by the prophetic inwardness of the old revelation 
acting on Paujlthe Jew, and on the other hand by a relatively close 
familiarity with genuine tradition about Jesus and the effects that 
Jesus was able to produce in the persons of the confessors of Jesus 
whom Paul persecuted.”
