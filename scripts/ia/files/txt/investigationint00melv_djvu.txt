INTRODUCTION 


This investigation was suggested by Dr. H. £• Smith as an 
investigation co-ordinate with that previously proposed for 
Mr. J.H. McLean. The general purpose and scope of the investig-- 
ation as suggested was to estimate, from grades VI to XII, the 
increasing richness of children’s language concepts, choosing 
for this purpose a list of hey words from any school subject in 
which I was interested. Having taught History for several years, 
and because history is a subject of continuous instruction from 
grade six to grade twelve, I chose the key words from that subject. 

The investigation was carried on in the Bellevue Public 
and High Schools, in constant collaboration with that undertaken 
by Mr. McLean. I have been helped very much by his advice and 
assistance. I am permitted to use the data and results which 
he obtained in order to make comparisons with mine. Dr. M*E. 
Lazerte and Dr. H.E. Smith have assisted greatly, especially 
by their advice, and also by giving one of the tests to a 
University class for the purpose of comparing results, and more 
especially to find out what scores educated, mature persons 
would make on these tests. Many of the tabulations were 
checked by Miss E. Ghiaravano. 

In order that this report and that by .Mr. McLean should be 
easily comparable, the two are arranged in parallel form. The 
fact that our aims, methods, and general conclusions are 
similar leads to a general similarity in the two reports.

CHAPTER I 
THE PROBLEM 

The problem was to estimate, as objectively as possible, 
the increasing richness of language concepts in History from 
grades six to twelve. Though indirectly the extent of vocabulary 
and the ability to read and answer questions might also be 
measured, the essential aim was to determine as comprehensively as 
possible denotation, connotations, shades of meaning and range of 
significance with reference to the students' knowledge of the 
selected key words. 

This problem is intimately connected with the ability of 
school children to read and to understand and their ability to 
carry on independent study. The investigation may suggest that 
many students fail to understand what they read and hear because 
they do not know, as fully and as accurately as they should, what 
words mean. 


CHAPTER II 

THE APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM 
Methods 

The means available for collecting the data were three: 
oral tests, written tests, or both. Considerable preliminary 
testing, exploratory in nature, was done in order to determine the 
method to use. At first, a number of students were questioned 
orally. There are a number of arguments in favor of this method. 

The student is not hampered in his responses by any set system of 
questioning, but may talk freely, telling all that he knows about 
the word as his mental associations may prompt him. The responses 
may be tested immediately to determine if they are based on exact 
knowledge, how far that knowledge goes, and his degree of certainty, 
which may range from pure guessing to conviction. 

Yet this preliminary oral testing revealed certain weaknesses 
in this method, from the point of view of the purpose in view/. On 
their own initiative, students were able to express only meagre

knowledge of the test words. In order to secure from the 
students the information wanted, it was necessary to question 
them. If oral questioning were used, in order that there should 
"be any basis of comparison between students, a standard form of 
questioning would need to be followed; in that case, the oral 
method comes to resemble closely the written questionnaire method. 
Unless there were a uniform procedure, the scoring would vary for 
each student. The scoring of oral responses had to be done 
quickly, without much time for reflection by the investigator; 
hence the scoring would tend to lack objectivity. Several students, 
even some grade twelve boys, appeared shy and handicapped by 
self—consciousness during oral questioning. 

On the other hand, there appear to be several advantages 
of the written questionnaire. It brings out the students’ know— 
ledge more fully, provided that the test is comprehensive enough'* 
and that the questioning is apt. Students have the advantage of 
having answered many written tests in their ordinary school work. 

It makes possible the testing of more students in less time. All 
students are tested at the same time, hence there is little chance 
of any student making preliminary preparation for the test. Such 
a test is uniform in content and in manner of administration for 
all students. There is a greater possibility of uniformity and 
objectivity in scoring. The students are more at their ease as 
members of their usual groups, and thus are more likely to do theiLr 
best. The students had time to think more carefully before 
answering, A written test provides a permanent record of questions 
and responses which permit later analyses and interpretation. 

Two disadvantages of the written method appeared. It was 
impossible to determine accurately the degree of conviction 
possessed by the students in respect to many of the responses. Also, 
certain questions suggested the answers to other questions. Often, 
students gave as an original sentence one very similar to a later 
one dealing with the correct recognition, and sometimes they gave 
as definitions words selected from the list of synonyms. This

difficulty could have "been avoided, to a great extent, by dividing 
the test on each word into two separate parts, the first part ask¬ 
ing only for the use of the word in an original sentence and for 
the definition of the word. 

I chose the written questionnaire method as being, on the 
whole, the better for the collection of the data. X think that 
better results might have been obtained if at least some of the 
students had been questioned orally in regard to their previously 
written tests. Though this was done in mapy cases, no record 
was kept, apart from suggestions for improving the later tests. 

CONSTRUCTION ON THE TESTS 

As the final form of the tests took shape, certain 
principles were adopted in respect to their construction. Primar¬ 
ily, each test should be adapted to each word rather thhn that the 
words should be tested in any constant standardized form. Different 
words are best tested in different ways; for example, some words 
have many synonyms, others have few. There were only two questions 
uned in every test, those asking the student to use the word 
correctly, and to define the word. In all other cases, the type 
of question employed varied with the word being tested. In the 
second place, each test should deal with as many meanings and be 
as comprehensive as possible. Thirdly, knowledge and error should 
be measured separately. Finally, the tests should be as objective 
as possible. 

Based on these principles, several different types of 
questions were given. In addition to those asking the student to 
use the word in a sentence and to define; the word, other types 
were more or less frequent. They include recognition of correct 
usage, selection of synonyms, knowledge of grammatical forms of the 
words, judgement as to whether a word is appropriate in given 
situations, and other less frequent types. In the earlier tests 
the student was asked to tell about any difficulty he had iri 
answering any question, the purpose being to find out if any

ambiguity or unforeseen response was influencing the answer. 

Also, in the earlier tests, the students were asked to tell any¬ 
thing else that he knew about the word. Both types were later 
omitted as being of very little value. 

All the tests were constructed in collaboration with 
Mr. J.H. McLean. His criticism helped greatly, in contributing 
&Q Tr whatever degree of comprehensiveness and objectivity the tests 
may possess. 

The tests follow in the order in which they were given.

ADMINISTERING THE TESTS. 

Each teacher supervised the administration of the tests 
in her own class room. Two tests, one prepared by Mr. McLean, the 
other by myself, were given consecutively on the dates shown on 
the tests. A uniform procedure was adopted by all teachers. They 
were to allow the students as much time as they wished, they were 
to explain, if ashed, the meaning of the questions and how they 
were to be answered. I supervised the administration of the first 
few tests in order to be as certain as possible that every student 
knew what he was being asked to do. 

The test on the word "State" was submitted to a University 
class. However, lacking the oral instructions given to the 
students here, some of the University students found the test 
slightly vague. A few of the most difficult tests were given to 
students of grades IY and Y to discover what scores would be 
made by persons having little or no knowledge of the words. 

SCORING THE TESTS. 

The scoring of the tests offered great difficulty. I 
found it difficult to decide as to the relative worth of the 
various types of questions, and the various responses to the 
questions. Eor example: What is the relative worth of a 
synonym correctly selected compared with a definition correctly 
given? Again, a student is asked to underline the names of 
civilized.countries in a list, but instead of doing so, he writes, 
"No country is yet civilized." 

At first, considering that the ability to use a word in 
such a way as to indicate knowledge of its meaning was important, 

I allotted that question a maximum of three points, grading the 
answer from there down, according to my estimate of the amount of 
meaning shown in its use. Later, deciding that this question was 
being over valued, especially in relation to the definition, I 
reduced the mark to a maximum of one. In either case, a correspond' 
ing error score was given if the word was used incorrectly. 
















. 


























r 















17 


Definitions were scored by allotting one point for each 
item, without setting any fixed up )er limit. If, ins b of a 
definition, an example of the use of the word was given, a mark 
was allowed if the previotis question had not been answered, but 
such marks were not credited to the definition in the later 
analysis. or all other questions, one point was given for 
each response. Questions not answered were not scored. Scores 
for knowledge and error were totalled separately. No maximum, 
possible score was. set for any test as a whole. 

CLASSIFICATION OF STUDENTS. 

The chronological ages of the students were taken as 
on January 1, 1926. The mental ages were derived from the 
"Otis Self-Administering Tests of Mental Ability”, the 
Intermediate examination for students in grades VI, VII and 
VIII; the Higher examination for the High School students. 

These tests were given about four months after January 1, 

1936.

McLean and myself in respect to the total knowledge and error 
scores.

M. A• -—Mental Age. 

K. -knowledge Scores. 

E. -Error Scores. 

H. -Tests on words chosen from history. 

S. -Tests on words chosen from science. 

Rankings were arranged in each grade as follows: 

M.A. — Highest to lowest. 

K. - Highest to lowest. 

S. - Lowest to highest. 

According to the rankings, a positive correlation for E. 
and M.A. or E. and K. indicates that E. decreases as MIA. or K. 
increases. Where E. is correlated in the table with any variable 
except E., a positive correlation indicates that the two variables 
increase or decrease together. 

THE KNOWLEDGE SCORES 

The knowledge scores have been classified in three ways. 
Firstly, the mean knowledge score for each grade was determined 
by taking the sum of the mean knowledge scores of the individual 
pupils in each grade and dividing this sum by the number of pupils 
in the grade. Secondly, the students were grouped according to 
chronological age, the intervals being six months, and the mean 
score of each age group determined. Finally, the students were 
classified according th mental age, the intervals also being six 
months, and the mean score of each group was determined.

From Table I it appears that the increase in knowledge of 
the words tested was greatest from grades VI to VII, only slightly 
less from grades X to XI, and much less elsewhere. From grade XI 
to XII there is a decline. One explanation of the relatively poor 
score made by grade XII may be that, as a class, it was below 
average in school work.' Similar variations in ability or in 
industriousness may have occurred in other grades. The sampling 
was small and varied in the different grades. 

Knowledge seems to increase fairly steadily up to a 
chronological age of about seventeen, after which the increase is 
both less and very irregular. One explanation may be that students 
in the higher chronological age groups are those of lesser ability, 
many of whom are repeating part of their school work. In any case, 
many of the irregularities are probably due to the small sampling, 
especially in the upper age groups. 

Knowledge seems to increase more rapidly and more uniformly 
with increasing mental age than it does with increasing chronological 
age. The scores on the two sets of tests also show greater 
agreement. There is apparently mo such slowing down in the 
acquisition of knowledge at the higher mental age levels as was 
observable at the higher grade and chronological age levels. It 
should be noted that the mental.ages as given may not be accurate. 

In the first place, they are based on only one test; in the second 
place, it is a condition of the Otis Tests that scores made on 
them can be translated into mental ages only approximately for all 
except normal individuals. 

The question arises whether the knowledge scores as given 
here are truly indicative of knowledge, even assuming that the 
tests are fair. In marking the tests, I discovered that many of 
the younger students were merely guessing the answers.. There is 
no objection to guessing, especially when resulting from at least 
limited knowledge, but certainly :, pure tT guessing should not be 
credited either as knowledge or error. In order to discover

more accurately just what scores would be made by students having 
little or no knowledge of the words, Mr. McLean and I gave five of 
the tests this term to grades IV and V under the same conditions 
and with the same instructions as for the higher grades. They were 
told to do their best, that is, they were not encouraged to guess 
blindly. Table Ilia shows the scores which they made on these 
tests. TABLE IIIA

This table shows that students who are merely guessing are 
able to make a knowledge score not far short of that made by 
grade VI. That the grade IV students were really guessing, with— 
out possessing any knowledge of the words is indicated in several 
ways. Before they wrote the tests, they claimed to have no 
knowledge of the words; in this connection, the words selected 
for their tests were those considered least likely to be known. 

Later, they were orally questioned by their teacher with respect 
to the answers they had given, and she was led to believe that 
they had no actual knowledge of the words. Also, examination of 
the answers of both grades IV end V showed that in no case was 
a student able to use the word correctly in a sentence which 
showed an understanding of its meaning or to define the words. 

Lastly, the mean error score of the Grade IV pupils is almost the 
same as their mean knowledge score. 

Just how much of the knowledge score made by the grades is 
the result of actual knowledge, and how much could result from 
"pure” guessing? In grade IV there is assumed to be no actual 
knowledge, and we note that K-E (knoTffl.edge score minus error 
score) is equal to zero. Grade V children, who did gi a i m 
to have some knowledge of the words, made a, mean knowledge score in 
excess of their mean error score. In the case of grade IV, guessing has

augmented equally the knowledge and the error scores. Then 
allowing an equal number of points for guessing in both knowledge 
and error scores, by subtracting the error score from the knowledge 
score, we would have left the minimum knowledge content of the 
knowledge score, if the scores were not affected by guessing, then 
the knowledge score represents actual knowledge. This means that 
the score representing actual knowledge lies somewhere within the 
limits indicated by X and K —E. For the different grades this 
range is as shown in Table Illb and the accompanying figure. 

Still allowing equal points fwr guessing in the knowledge 
and error scores, it follows that the part of the knowledge score 
which results from guessing could not exceed the error score. 

Tables IV, V, and VI show that the mean error scores decrease 
with advancing grade, chronological age and mental a;ge. This means 
that the possible range of guessing is narrowing at upper grade 
and age levels. It follows that the knowledge scores at these 
higher age and grade levels is more and more indicative of actual 
knowledge, and that at the lower age and grade levels the reverse 
is true. Hence it is very likely that the true rate of increase,, 
in actual knowledge is greater than the rate of increase sho?®., ..

THE ERROR SCORES 

It has been an aim in this investigation to discover as 
comprehensively as possible what students know about certain 
words. ..Iowa.nee has been made for the erroneous ideas connect¬ 
ed with the word s by .scoring error separately. The error 
scores have been classified in the same three ways as- the 
ho ■ e cores; they - re shown in T; : _es [V, V, and VI, 
the accompanying Figures.

The- error scores 


except 







. 













grade YI to grade VII. The slight increase in error in this case 
may perhaps arise from the fact that the grade VII- students 
attempted to answer many more questions than the grade VI students. 

In fact, they tried for more points than the students of grades 
/I, i III, IX, or X. Thus it may "be that "both error and knowledge 
scores of grade VII are unduly augmented by guessing. The increase 
in error in the lower age intervals, both chronological and mental, 
may be sii.iilarily explained. It will be noted that, perhaps contrary 
to expectation, the error scores for the lower mental age groups 
are higher than those for the corresponding chronological age 
groups. Decrease in error with increasing mental age seems more 
rapid and steady than it does with increasing chronological age. 

These error scores include the results of actual error and 
possibly of some guessing. The decrease in error scores observable 
in the higher groups probably show§ h decrease in both actual 
error and guessing. It is not inherent in these tests to measure 
actual knowledge or error apart from the element of guessing.

THE KNOWLEDGE ERROR RATIO 

In discussing the Knowledge scores it was pointed out that, 
owing to the element of guessing, the increase in the knowledge 
score may not give an accurate picture of the actual knowledge in— 
crease* Suppose that a student has a knowledge score of 15 and an 
error score of 11, then, assuming that guessing.'will augment "both 
scores equally, there are only 4 points of the 15 points which are 
certain to reflect actual knowledge. If a student of the next higher 
grade has a score of 20 for knowledge and 8 for error, there are 12 
points certain for actual knowledge. Evidently the increase in 
actual knowledge could "be as high as 300 percent, "but considering 
only the recorded knowledge scores, the advance from 15 to 20 is 
only 33 1/3 per cent. If in each case the knowledge score is divided 
by the corresponding error score, the knowledge error ratio in the 
first case is 1.36 and in the second case is 2.5, an increase of 
over 80 per cent. It seems evident that the increase in this 
knowledge error ratio is a better approximation to the truth concern— 
ing the growth of actual knowledge than is the increase in the 
recorded knowledge scores. The data show that knovi/ledge scores 
increase and that error scores decrease. From this it follows that 
the increase in K/E is a combined effect of these two tendencies. 

Also, decreasing error scores indicate decrease in guessing as well 
as decrease in actual error. Hence the tendency of the K/E ratio to 
increase points to a greater accuracy in wurd concepts. 

The mean knowledge error ratios have been calculated for the 
different grades, and for the chronological and mental age groups* 

The results are shown -in Tables VII, VIII, and IX and the accompanying 
graphs.

From grade VI to grade VIII the increase in the x/E ratio is 
gradual; from grade VIII to grade X the increase advances less rapid¬ 
ly. The greatest increase is from grade X to grade XI; there is only 
a very Slight increase from grade XI to grade XII, it being due to 
a reduction in both knowledge and error scores by a small and equal 
amount. From chronological age 1£ 2 H& to 15 there is a slow, steady 
gain; from 15 to 17 there is a rapid increase; from that point there 
is an irregular decline. The increases from group to group are more 
steady and rapid with increasing mental age than v:ith increasing 
chronological age. Increasing accuracy of knowledge, as measured by 
the k/E ratio, seems most closely related to mental age, secondly 
to grades, and least of all to chronological age. 

A considerable degree of reliability of the preceding results 
is indicated by the general agreement in the results obtained by 
Mr. McLean and by myself, ^-t is observable that, in general, for 
the same groups, the scores rise and fall together, and in very many 
instances at approximately the same rate or by the same amount. 

Since the same students have shown such uniformity in scores on these 
sets of tests, it would seem that these tests are measuring the same 
qualities and are doing so fairly reliably. The fact that the two 
tests dealt with different types of i/ords, were not identical in 
structure, and were scored by different persons increases the signif¬ 
icance lif the correspondence in the results. 

A comparison of the results obtained by us on these tests is 
interesting. The mean knowledge scores for the History and the 
Science words agree closely, both by mental and by chronological age 
up to about 15 years 6 months, after which the scores on the Science 
words advance more rapidly and. are continuously above the scores for 
the History words. By grades, the two scores are nearly the same 
until grade IX, after Y/hich students consistently show greater 
knowledge of the Science words. In all cases, the error scores are 
greater for the History words than for the Science words, and the K/E 
ratios are lower for History words than for Science words.■ This would

suggest that in teaching of History less emphasis has been placed 
on the meaning of the concepts involved than ih the teaching of 
Science. i 


CHAPTER V 

A MORE DETAILED QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS 
CORRECT USAGE OF WORDS 

The second question on every test asked the strident to use 
the test word in an original sentence in such a way as to show an 
understanding of the meaning, or one of the meanings, of the word. 
Table X and the accompanying graph show the mean per cent of 
students in each grade of the students who used the words correctly 
and incorrectly, regardless of whether their answer was scored 
as 1, 2, or 3. 

The Table shows that, as regards the ability to use words 
correctly in sentences, there is a rapid increase from grade VI 
to grade VII, a slow increase from there to grade X, another 
rapid increase to grade XI, and a decrease in grade XII.

DEFINITIONS 

The third question on every test called for as complete a 
definition of the test word as the student could give. All the 
items in all the definitions were rated as being right or wrong, 
and all those classed as right or correct were further rated as 
being, good, fair, or poor. These responses have been analyzed 
in two ways. Firstly, of all the items in the definitions, the 
per cent right and the per cent wrong, and the percent of those 
right which have been rated as good, fair, and poor, have been 
calculated. This analysis does not consider the number or the 
percent of students who defined the vt/ords, nor does it indicate 
the number who did not attempt to define the words. Table XIa 
and Figure 11a show the results of this analysis. 

Secondly, the mean number of items in each class of 
definition was cal ciliated for all the students in each grade. 

This analysis compares all the students of all the grades, not 
only those who attempted to define. Table Xlb and Figure lib 
show the results of this analysis. 

The ability to define words correctly, as indicated in 
these tables, increases steadily to grade XI. The ability to give 
a good definition increases in close agreement with the ability 
to define rightly; it increases up to grade XII. However, even 
in grade XII, under fifty per cent of all the items in the defin— 
itions are rated as good. From grade to grade, there is not much 
variation in the number of definitions rated as fair or poor. Both 
analyses show a very rapid increase in ability to define correctly 
from grade VI to grade mil. Table Xlb shows a more continuous 
increase from grade VI to grade XI than Table XIa shows, and 
because it considers all the students in the grades, it is likely 
to be the more reliable of the two in indicating increasing merit. 
Grade VIII compares very favourably with grade XI as regards the 
percentage of all definitions rated as right, whereas it compares 
far less favorably as regards the mean number of definitions rated 
as right.

It should "be noted that in defining the words the students 
were obliged to create their own answers. To give good definitions 
requires considerable power of abstract thinking. For this reason, 
the scores made on this question are perhaps the best indication 
of increase in merit of abstract thinking. Growth of denotation 
seems to be best indicated by the increase in the percentage of 
correct definitions and in the mean number of definitions scored 
as right. Growth in the power of abstract thinking is perhaps more 
closely linked with the increase in the percentage of right 
definitions and the mean number of right definitions which were 
also rated as good. No doubt all the questions in the tests have 
also measured to some extent the qualities of denotation and 
abstraction, yet in my opinion, this question measures these 
qualities more specifically.

OF KNOWLEDGE. 

In most of the tests a question was included in which 
the test word was used in a number oi sentences, in some cases 
correctly, in sene cases incorrectly. The students were asked 
to indicate each usage as being correct or incorrect. The mean 
per cent scores recorded below were obtained by taking the 
mean of the mean per cent scores made by each grade on all the 
tests which included this question. Another guestion asked 
the students to select from a list of words, some of which 
were synonyms, some of .1 ch were not, the word nearest in 
meaning to the test vwrd. The final mean per cent score was 
obtained in the manner explained above. In order to obtain 
some measure of connotation, one or more questions were 
selected from each test which seemed to me to measure this 
quality better than ins other questions did. These questions 
may also be considered to measure extension of knowledge of 
tne words. A separate score was obtained for the results of 
these questions. Table XII and the accompanying graph show 
the results.

A few points should he noted in interpreting these results. 
The questions testing recognition of correct usage and extension 
of knowledge, or connotation, were such as permitted only two 
answers, hence guessing could more easily affect these results than 
the others. Also, the questions chosen relating to extension of 
knowledge were generally those which even the students of the lower 
grades attempted to answer, that is, I excluded from this 
analysis any questions which students generally failed to attempt 
to answer. 

The Tables and graphs would seem to show that grade VI 
students have greater ability to recognize correct usage than they 
have to write original sentences containing the words correctly 
used. From grades VII to XII, the ability to use words correctly 
is superior to their ability to recognize correct usage. In 
general, it seems that the ability to use words, the ability to 
recognize correct usage, the knowledge of additional meanings and 
application of words, and the ability to select synonj/ms are 
developed in the order listed, nn explanation of this may be that 
students gain much of their extension of knowledge of words and 
learn of the difference between and similarities of words from 
using them and from seeing them and hearing them used. The 
selection of synonyms is most difficult for all grades. It appears 
that, on the whole, increasing mastery in these four abilities 
advance in parallel manner.

CHAPTER VI 

ESTIMATION OP MATURITY 

One of the aims in this investigation was to determine growth 
in maturity. To do this, some standard of maturity was required 
as a basis for comparison. A set of tests on the word "state” was 
sent to Dr. M.E. lazerte, University of Alberta. He gave these tests 
to a -senior University class of forty students. The tests were 
returned and scored by myself on the same basis as frr the younger 
students. The test on the word "state" was one of average difficulty 
for the students. The majority of the grades made almost exactly 
or only slightly less than their mean score on this test. The 
following tables and graphs show the scores made on this test by 
the grades and by the University class. All the items in the 
definitions of this word are also given here as I scored and rated 
them. This will indicate whatever degree of accuracy there may 
be in the ratings of the definitions previously discussed. 

It is not assumed that the results of one test are reliable. 
Yet a comparison of Figures 1, 4, and 14 will show that the mean 
knowledge and error scores for the word "state" are closely 
approximate to those for all the words. Probably, therefore, 
comparisons between the University students and the school students 
are reasonably comparable as regards knowledge and error. In both 
cases, the University scores are considerably better than the best 
scores made by the High School students. Figures 13a and 13b will 
show this. A comparison with figures 11a and lib indicate that 
the definitions for the word "state" are not typical of school 
students' definitions in general. Yet both the Tables, graphs, 
and the analysis of the items in the definitions will show that 
University students possess a much greater wealth of knowledge of 
the word, a greater power of elaboration of ideas, and a greater 
ability t-o think abstractly.

Figure 16 shows that the University students are better able 
to use the word correctly in sentences, to recognize correct usage, 
and to select synonyms than the High school students are. Of these 
abilities, they show a greater superiority in the selection of 
synonyms. 

Ho comparison is made in respect to extension of knowledge 
for the questions selected for this purpose were misunderstood by 
a few of the University students. 

In Table 15, the knowledge score made by the University class, 
though not a perfect score, has been considered to be a maturity 
score and on that basis is considered to be 100 per cent. The 
knowledge scores made by the grades on the same test have been 
calculated as per cents of the University score. In the same 
Table, the X/X ratio achieved by the University students has also 
been considered as a maturity ratio, and the ratios achieved by the 
other grades on the same test have been calculated as per cents ©•& 
it. This second comparison shows a greater difference between 
grade XII and the University class than the former comparison shows. 
However, the fact that grade X has a higher X/X ratio than grades 
XI or XII, in this case at least, suggests that the difference in 
the ratio is probably not a very reliable indication of the 
difference in maturity.

CHAPTER VII 

, 

CRITICISMS 

1. The tests, in being written, wore subject to certain limit¬ 
ations. The students' responses did not sufficiently indic¬ 
ate the breadth and depth of knowledge possessed. It was 
difficult to eliminate the effects of guessing. The tests 
were partly testing the ability to read and to give 
written answers. 

2. although it is difficult to measure separately such qualit¬ 
ies denotation, connotation, and power of abstraction, yet 
it is perhaps possible to extract from the tests certain 
approximate measures of these qualities. 

3. Certain questions, such as asking the student to give other 
forms of the word, were found to be of little value, at 
least in the manner in which they were given. 

4. Some of the questions were not sufficiently apt in that they 
did not bring out the knowledge or information wanted. 

5. In spite of careful forethought some unexpected responses 
were given which were difficult to score. 

6. We sought to avoid bias by collaborating in the construction 
of the tests and in considering possible responses. 

7. The sampling varied as between groups and probably was too 
small. 

6. There is a possibility that the different meanings, uses, 
applications of the words, and similar matters did not 
receive emphasis proportionate to their importance. 

9. The tests were uniform for all students. 

10. The tests were sufficiently easy to bring out any knowledge 
possessed and sufficiently difficult and comprehensive to 
call forth the fullest knowledge of the most mature 


students.

11. Evidence that the tests were sufficiently comprehensive is 
suggested by the fact that students seldom gave any inform— 
ation beyond that specifically called for, either in the 
last question of the earlier tests, or when questioned 
orally after writing the tests. 

12. vie feel that the remarkable correspondence in the results of 
the two investigations, as previously noted, is evidence 
that these tests, though varying in structure, do possess 
considerable reliability. 

INTERPRETATION OP RESULTS 

Certain local conditions, such as the small number of 
students tested, the predominance of foreign language influence, 
especially in the lowef grades, and the possible effects of local 
teaching, may have given a bias to the results of these tests. 
Although each set of tests has tested directly only tw/elve ?;ords, 
yet indirectly they have tested a considerable rang of vocabulary. 
These tests were not completely objective, for the subjective 
element may have influenced both the setting of the questions and 
the scoring of the responses, especially of the definitions. 

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS. 

1. Knowledge of the words tested increases by grades, mental age 
and chronological age. Judging from the results, increasing 
knowledge advances most in accord with mental age, next with 
grades, and least of all with chronological age. 

2. Error decreases in the same order that knowledge increases. 

3. A comparison of the results of the two investigations suggests 
that there is less error associated with the Science words than 
with the History words, even though the lower groups begin with 
approximately the same amount of knowledge. 

4. It is likely that the increase of knowledge and the decrease 
of error are more pronounced at certain levels. 

5. Knowledge of words is more extensive and more accurate in the 
later years of adolescence.

6. In general, the ability to use words is in advance of 

• '.lity to ■ correct usage, to define words, and 

to select synonyms. 

7. The erroneous concepts associated with rords are numerous 
and they have a tendency to persist in even the higher 
levels. 

8. The teaching of History especially and of Science to a 
lesser degree have apparently failed to clarify sufficiently 
for the students the meanings of the words employed in the 
respective subjects. 

9. The results suggest the possibility of constructing a 
normal curve of growth of knowledge of words for school 
students.
