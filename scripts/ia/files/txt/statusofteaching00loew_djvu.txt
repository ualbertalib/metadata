INTRODUCTION 


Every profession at some stage of its development 
must pause to re-examine its status and to consider the 
implications of its policies. It must subject itself to a 
thorough and critical self-appraisal. Are its methods of 
preparation what they should be? Do the members conscien¬ 
tiously strive to uphold the ideals of service and the 
code of ethics? Do they have the respect and support of 
the people who are served and, above all, have they an 
awareness of the grave responsibilities which go hand in 
hand with prerogatives and special privileges? For the 
teaching profession the time for such stock-taking seems 
to have arrived, 

^Teaching as a vocation has for centuries been 
regarded as one of the four traditional professions,” 

(l - p, 555) It shares this position along with Law, 
Theology and Medicine, The question that immediately 
comes to mind isi In view of these centuries of tradition 
why does the teaching profession find it necessary, at the 
present time, to fight so bitterly for professional recog¬ 
nition? 

Many explanations have been advanced for this 
seeming paradox. One is that because of the large number 
















. 






Page 2 


of persons employed, the wide territory over which they 
are scattered, the inadequate preparation of many of them 
and the short period of the professional life of the 
teacher, it has been difficult to develop and maintain a 
thoroughly well organized professional consciousness# 
Others claim—and there is some justification for their 
stand'—that it is not merely a question of a lack of 
development but that there has actually been a regression 
in professional status and prestige# Thejr point out that 
in the not-so-distant past the teacher was a sage and a 
scholar around whom only a select few were privileged to 
gather for instruction. He was quite a different figure 
from that of the present day school teacher* State 
schools and compulsory education would seem to be the 
cause for this change. Our school, system in its develop¬ 
ment has caused, a great many changes and not the least 
of them is the change in the popular conception of the 
teacher. The traditional lecturer and scholar still 
remains in the universities and institutions of higher 
learning but he is far outnumbered by a new type of 
individual who has assumed the name of teacher. These 
new teachers have come to claim membership in the profes¬ 
sion in such numbers as to completely change its character#

Teaching is now suffering the growing pains of a young 
profession because, in reality, it is a young profession. 

So far the term ’profession* has been used 
arbitrarily in connection with teaching. Perhaps this 
practice is ill-advised after a distinction has been drawn 
between the present-day and the traditional teacher. In 
many occupations today, a great source of trouble is the 
conflict between the old school of thought which maintains 
that the occupation in question is simply a trade like any 
other, not requiring special or prolonged training; and 
the new school of thought which claims that the occupation 
is a profession requiring a high standard of training 
and mental abilities. This same conflict exists among 
teachers. What is the answer to the question? Is teaching 
a profession? 

Before attempting an answer it would be well to 
first define our terms and determine what constitutes a 


profession 






Page 4 


Chapter I. 

YJHAT IS A PROFESSION? 

This question constitutes a challenge. Almost 
everyone has a general idea of what a profession is but 
it is only vague at best and the matter of a definition 
calls for serious thought, Generally the first reaction 
is to say that it signifies a group of people, such as 
doctors, lawyers or ministers. If a dictionary is con¬ 
sulted the answer will include some reference to a vocation 
requiring a previous college education and mental rather 
than physical labor. Are these satisfactory definitions'? 
Are they to be the criteria for distinguishing the pro¬ 
fessional man from the wage earner? 

The Interprofessional Conference on Education for 
Professional Responsibility held at Buck Hills Falls, 
Pennsylvania in April 1947 appointed a committee to find 
the answers to these same questions. (2 - p.453) The 
report which was made concluded that there were numerous 
definitions of ’profession* and ’professional employment’ 
but no generally accepted definition. Here lies the crux 
of the whole problem. It is possible to make a definition 
but the difficulty lies in securing its general acceptance.

The purpose of this chapter, therefore, is to make a 
historical survey of the authors and articles on this 
subject in order to select the points on which they are 
in general agreement and from them to try to formulate a 
composite definition of the term *profession'. 

The various attributes of professionalism have been 
classified under three headings. They were the ones most 
frequently mentioned and will be considered in the follow¬ 
ing order: 

1. Education 

2. Technical Knowledge and Skill 

3. Social Responsibility

1. Education 

For a vocation to be a profession in the true sense 
of the term and for it to enjoy real professional status 
it is essential that all members have a superior academic 
education! This is the gist of most articles on the sub¬ 
ject. Fully three quarters of the authorities consulted 
emphasized a ’liberal education*, usually in the form of 
a university degree, as one of the requirements for 
membership in a profession. Almost any dictionary mentions 
it. A typical definition of a profession is the one in 
Funk and Wagnalls Concise English Dictionary: "an occupa¬ 
tion that properly involves a liberal education or its . 
equivalent". 

One reference was found that definitely disagreed 
with this point of view. The National Labor Relations 
Board ruled in the Illinois Bell Telephone Company dispute 
last spring that: (3 - p. 96 ) 

"The qualifications of a professional 
employee do not hinge on a college degree or 
on a state of professional license. Instead 

the nature of the employee’s duties must be

However, this is the only exception to the general 
concensus of opinion, and it must he borne in mind that 
this ruling was made over a wage dispute and refers to 
the internal functionings of a particular trade union. 

The vast majority of professional men, and lay public 
alike, recognize the necessity of a so-called liberal 
education as one of the pre-requisites to entry into a 
profession. Even Hippocrates, the father of medicine, 
must have had this in mind centuries ago when he gave his 
ideal of medicine as "the profession of a cultured gentle¬ 
man". 

Why should this be so? The conclusions of the 
Interprofessional Conference mentioned previously attempt 
to give an explanation: (4 - p* 142) 

”The reasons for not limiting profession¬ 
al education to purely technical and mech¬ 
anical skills are to be found in the very 
changeable nature of professional work and 
the constantly varying situations. The 
problems with which professional men deal 
are not known diming their period of academic 
preparation and, after all, the question that 


has not been asked cannot be answered. While

answers cannot be given, the power to get 
answers and to put them to work in dealing 
with actual situations can be developed* 

This is where the broad background provided 
by a liberal education comes in..." 

The conference generally agreed that the preparation 
for a profession is primarily concerned with developing 
the capacity to acquire knowledge and to use it. It 
should stress potential knowledge rather than immediate 
knowledge, i.e., the preparation tc learn from experience. 
For this reason there must be a special effort made to 
develop in the student as broad a background as possible. 
Much the same idea was put forward by Dr. Malcolm Wal¬ 
lace, Principal of University College, Toronto: (5 - p. 54 ) 

"Gentlemen, I wish to plead for an ideal 
of the professional man as something other 
than a great technician. It is true that 
society legitimately demands efficient ser¬ 
vice from us hut she should also demand 
that we develop our faculties in as rounded 
a fashion as possible, in order that w^e 
thereby become able to take counsel together 







Page 9 


as to how the world is to he made better 
and more satisfying for each individual; as 
to how the inevitable changes are to be 
made* A democracy needs a body of educated 
men in this sense of the word,” 

A second vital reason for demanding a liberal 
education in addition to purely professional training was 
given by Robert E. Doherty, President, Carnegie Institute 
of Technology, in an article entitled "Education for 
Professional Responsibility". (6 - p. He stresses 

the need for knowledge of the humanities and social 
sciences: 

"The professional men of today must furn¬ 
ish the guiding purpose and the intellectual 
power to meet the ever more complicated pro¬ 
blems of society. Unlike the democracies of 
the past, we have no leisure class to do our 
governing for us and if our imperiled freedom 
is to survive, our keenest and best disci¬ 
plined minds—which in general means our 
professional men—must devote more time and 
energy to leadership in the solution of 
national problems. The purpose of the liber-

al educative background should be to develop 
in these professional men: (l) a feeling of 
social responsibility, (2) an appreciation 
of human and social values and relationships, 
and (3) a disciplined analytical power, to 
deal with these values and relationships in 
practical situations.” 

According to this point of view the hope of a 
civilized national life rests not only upon the Jeffer¬ 
sonian principle of universal education but also upon 
properly educated leadership by our professional men. 

The articles quoted above were selected because 
they are typical of the majority of opinions put forward. 
The conclusion to be drawn from them is that the work or 
service performed by a profession is not necessarily 
better than that of a trade but is on a higher intel¬ 
lectual plane. Also, the general public has come to 
accept the superior ability of the professional man and 
calls upon him to perform an increasingly wider field of 
duties. To preserve this trust and respect he must be 
adequately prepared to fulfill his obligations and the 
best preparation he can possible have is years of study 
to develop a keen mind and extensive knowledge. These

qualities in its members serve to set the profession 
apart from the trade, and in the final analysis they are 
accounted for largely by a college education. Therefore 
one of the requirements of a profession is that all its 
members be university graduates! 







Page 12 


2. Professional Knowledge and Skill 

A profession must possess a body of professional 
knowledge not available to the general public and its 
members must show a high technical proficiency in its 
application! It would be difficult to find anyone who 
would object to the inclusion of this phase of prof¬ 
essionalism in formulating a definition. Sven those 
occupations which are classified as trades possess 
this qualification. However, according to many writers 
on this subject, the technical knowledge peculiar to a 
profession differs somewhat from that of a trade. 

One distinction that is made is purely relative. 
Some authors claim that professional knowledge enjoys a 
higher status because it is more scientific and there¬ 
fore requires a greater intellectual capacity for 
complete mastery. Perhaps this is a valid distinction 
to draw but Suzzalo makes another that seems much more 
pertinent in his article "The Profession of Teaching". 

(7 - p. 555) 

"The final condition of professional service 
is that it be performed in a human medium 





Page 13 


where human personalities are reverenced as 
ends as well as utilized as means.” 

This is a vital distinction. Professional service 
is performed in a human medium whereas purely vocational 
service is usually performed in some inanimate medium. 
Webster’s Dictionary expresses the same idea in its first 
definition of "profession”,-“’’The occupation if not purely 
mechanical, agricultural or commercial or the like to 
which one devotes himself.” The Oxford Dictionary also 
emphasizes the human aspect of professionalism. Its 
definition of a ’’profession” is: "A vocation in vdaich a 
professed knowledge of some department of learning is 
used in its application to the affairs of others.” 

One other distinction between vocational and 
professional services which has frequently been noted 
is that the latter is very difficult to standardize or 
subject to any system of measurement. The artisan or 
tradesman measures his services in man-hour or in articles 
completed when he is doing piece work. Professional 
services allow of no such standardization. Perhaps some 
professional men sell their services but the results can 
never be adequately appraised since they deal in human 
rather than in material values.

There is also the question of how technical skill 
is to be acquired. At first glance there would seem to 
be no clear cut difference in this respect between the 
trade and the profession. Usually the tradesman serves 
a certain specified period of time as an apprentice and 
the professional worker does the same thing though under 
a different name* The young lawyer must article for a 
given number of years before being admitted to the Bar 
and the physician must serve as an interne before receive 
ing a license to practice® However, closer examination 
will disclose that there is a difference* For the artisan 
his period of apprenticeship is his period of training 
whereas for the professional worker it is merely the 
culmination of his training* The professional practi¬ 
tioner has spent years of study learning the theory and 
building up a background of knowledge that is climaxed by 
this period of practical application® Then* too* the pro¬ 
fessional trainee in his period of practical study is 
initiated into the ritual and customs of professional 
practice and imbued with the proper respect for the 
accepted cod© of ethics. 

The historical background of this period of 
initiation and its importance in developing the proper 
professional attitude are reviewed by Bush in his article 





- 









. 
















Page 15 . 


entitled "The Qualities of a Profession", (8 - p. 463 ) 

"The period of initiation into a profes¬ 
sion should extend into maturity. Only when 
members reached the full bloom of manhood did 
the ancients entrust the mysteries to their 
care. The young neophyte served his appren¬ 
ticeship under constant tutelage and close 
guidance by mature minds and this we still 
find in every profession. As apprentice, as 
employee, he is called upon to prove himself 
before he enters into that relationship where 
his opinions are controlling in his special 
field; and some there are who never emerge 
from close control and the mere exercise of 
technical proficiency. Inculcation of the 
principle of the profession can come only from 
those who themselves have attained to the full 
grasp of its proper function in society, who 
have arrived at a balanced judgment as to its 
responsibility to the several groupings of 
which society is composed and who have a pro¬ 
fessional interest in the young men who are 
destined to succeed them in the profession.

3very profession should have its secrets and 
its mysteries spread before the world that all 
may read but truly understood only by those who 
have lived the professional life, and these 
should be transmitted to the young neophyte 
with due care, with reverence for their in¬ 
herent worth and in due time. Ritual and sym¬ 
bolism, secrecy and circumspection were the 
ancient paraphernalia which ensured proper 
seriousness in youth in order that the importa¬ 
tion might be impressive." 

Ritual and symbolism have not wholly disappeared 
from modern professions, .admission to the Bar, the use 
of the title of Doctor and other similar customs and 
usages have a profound effect in producing professional 
consciousness. 

The acquisition of professional spirit and techni¬ 
cal skill by means of a system of apprenticeship, then, 
are two features of professional service. third is its 
preoccupation with human values. However, the point to 
be made here is that a profession denotes the existence 
of a body of scientific knowledge and technical skill and 
this can be confidently accepted. The very derivation of

the wcrd •profession 1 indicates the existence of such 
knowledge. Both the Oxford and Webster Dictionaries de¬ 
fine profession as "a calling or vocation in which one 
professes to have acquired some special knowledge”. A 
quotation from Lester Anderson may be used by way of 
summarization: (9 - p. 51) 

"The criteria for judging professional 
service and distinguishing it from a mere 
trade or vocation are: (l) the necessity 
for a body of professional knowledge, 

(2) this knowledge scientifically derived, 

(3) members of the profession showing high 
technical proficienc}?- and, (4) members com¬ 
petent to render professional judgment. 






Page 18 


5. Social Significance 

A profession is an occupation indispensible to 
human welfarel This third and final attribute of profess¬ 
ionalism is, undoubtedly, the most important one of them 
all. Every writer on this subject mentions it and usually 
goes to great lengths to enlarge upon it. Social sig¬ 
nificance and the attitude of service of the individual 
members are given as the final infallible criteria for 
judging a profession. Scholarship and technical skill 
are vital aspects but they are quite unsatisfactory unless 
accompanied by the proper attitude. By professional 
attitude” is meant the unselfish devotion to ideals of 
service which far transcend such considerations as per¬ 
sonal gain and monetary rewards. It is an expression of 
habitual modes of thought concerning values and indi¬ 
cates that worthy professional goals serve as directives 
to the individual and determine his actions. 

The statement that a profession is indispensible 
to human welfare is not designed to confine the title of 
profession to the traditional occupations which were 
indispensible to man in a more or less primitive society. 
It is recognized that as civilization progresses the 
number of professions is bound to increase. The first

professions to arise were those which satisfied a vital 
need and first built up a body of valuable knowledge 
such as medicine, law, and theology. But as civilization 
becomes more complex more of men’s occupations, of 
necessity, become professions. This, however, does not 
lessen the importance of the proper professional attitude 
in respect to the members of these new professions. For 
them it is quite as important as for the members of the 
older, better established professions. 

The report of the committee at the Interprofession¬ 
al Conference mentioned earlier, refers to this idea of 
a ’’dedicated calling” time and time again. When they 
refer to a profession or a professional practitioner it 
is always entirely a question of service, unselfishness, 
and high ideals, as in the following extract: (2 - p. 453) 

"Professional recognition flows only from 
the faithful discharge of obligations and with¬ 
out an understanding of this fundamental re¬ 
quirement, the pursuit of professional recog¬ 
nition is a hopeless quest. There is nothing 
visionary or impractical in this idealistic 
concept. It is the ideal of the medical 
profession and is carried to such an extreme

that the doctor foregoes all personal profit 
from his own medical discoveries or inventions 
because he believes such altruism is in the 
interests of the public health." 

The medical profession has probably developed a 
truer and more unselfish professional attitude in its 
members than any other. Perhaps this is due to the fact 
that the profession is unique in having had for centuries 
the Hippocratic 0ath 3 a cogent and succinct statement of 
those habitual modes of thought and responses in action 
which make up the accepted professional attitude of the 
physician. Medical students are early made aware of the 
Oath and find its use a highly significant part of the 
ritual of admission to the ranks of the physicians. It 
might well be required reading for every professional 
man in that it shows clearly what a profession should 
aspire to be. It points to the responsibility of those 
entering medicine to so employ themselves and direct 
their interests that the renown of their chosen field may 
be enhanced. It pledges them to enter houses only for 
the benefit of the sick; to abstain from every voluntary 
act of mischief and corruption; to keep secret that which 
should be kept secret and in "purity and holiness" to pass 
their lives and practice their art.

It follows naturally that the individual who is 
imbued with such ideals will not lightly give up his 
chosen calling. A tradesman may change from one type of 
work to ouaother as the mood strikes him or as the economic 
conditions of the time force him, but one truly profes¬ 
sional will not. A profession is never a ’’stepping stone" 
or a temporary fill-in. The professional man might see 
where he could benefit financially by turning to some 
other type of work but if he has conscientiously em¬ 
braced the code of ethics of his profession and has any 
regard for the ideals of service he will find himself 
unable to do so. In a true profession members do not 
leave for more immediate personal or economic advantage. 

An important factor in the development of a 
professional attitude is the code of ethics. Some authors 
say the reverse. They claim that the code of ethics is 
an outgrowth of a sincere professional attitude. How¬ 
ever, all professional service is characterized by the 
fact that the human element is present to such a degree 
that special ethical conventions are required for the 
control of each case, and therefore, each professional 
organization must have an effective code of professional 
ethics determining the relationships of the practitioner

to those involved in his practice. Furthermore, to main¬ 
tain the best possible conditions for practice along with 
public recognition and esteem, there must be a set of 
rules for the purpose of keeping order within the profes¬ 
sion. From this need has developed that part of the code 
which deals with the relationship of one practitioner to 
another. Doctors are utterly practical about this. 

After declaring that the public welfare transcends all 
consideration of personal profit their Code of Ethics 
proceeds with two pages describing the doctor 1 s obliga¬ 
tions to his patients and twelve pages describing his 
obligations to other doctors. Of course no one has ever 
claimed that devotion of a profession to the public 
interest requires vows of poverty by its practitioners! 

Suzzald fairly well summarizes the above section 
on professionalism: (l - p. 535) 

"Professional practice has a social sig¬ 
nificance not attained by other types of work. 

To commercialize law, theology, medicine or 
teaching is to serve selfish rather than 
social ends. There may be large personal 
returns but they are subordinate to the satis¬ 


faction of service."

SUMMARY 

The following reflections come from Byrne J. 
Horton, Graduate Faculty, St. John*s University. 

(10 - p. 164) They come as close to being a summary of 
this chapter as it would be possible to devise and for 
this reason are quoted outright. Contemplating the 
characteristics of the professions of law, medicine, 
theology, and advanced teaching Dr. Horton proposes ten 
criteria or earmarks of a genuine professions 

1. A profession must satisfy an indispensible social 
need and be based upon well-established and socially 
accepted scientific principles. 

2. It must demand an adequate pre-professional and cul¬ 
tural training. (Today a two-year college course is 
generally required.) 

3, It must demand the possession of a boc^r of specialized 
and systemized knowledge® 

4, It must give evidence of needed skills which the 
general public does not possess; that is, skills 
which are partly native and partly acquired.

5. It must have developed a scientific technique which 
is the result of tested experience, 

6. It must require the exercise of discretion and judgment 
as to the time and manner of the performance of the 

■ duty. This is in contrast to the kind of work which 
is subject to immediate direction and sux3ervision. 

7. It must be a type of beneficial work, the result of 
which is not subject to standardization on terms of 
unit performance or time element, 

8. It must have a group consciousness designed to extend 
scientific knowledge in technical language, 

9. It must have sufficient self-impelling power to retain 
its members throughout life. It must not be used 

as a mere stepping-stone to other occupations, 

10. It must recognize its obligations to society by 
insisting that its members live up to an established 
and accepted code of ethics, 

American Supreme Court Justice Louis D, Brandeis 

formulated a definition which embodies much of the thought 

of the above in a short succinct statements (11 - p, 3)

"The peculiar characteristics of a pro¬ 
fession as distinguished from other occupa¬ 
tions I take to he these: First, a profes¬ 
sion is an occupation for which the necessary 
preliminary training is intellectual in 
character, involving knowledge and to seme 
extent learning as distinguished from mere 
skill; second, it is an occupation which is 
pursued largely for others and not merely for 
oneself; third, it is an occupation in which 
the amount of financial returns is not the 
accepted measure of success*" 

In conclusion, then, a profession is an occupation 
or calling, vital to human welfare which demands of its 
members: 

1. A liberal background of education; usually a univer¬ 
sity degree or its equivalent. 

2. High technical skill in the application, to the affairs 
of others, of some body of scientific knowledge. 

3 . Unselfish devotion to a code of ethics and an ideal of 


service.

CHAPTER II 


IS TEACHING A PROFESSION? 


Much has been written on this subject and as jet 
it is a highly controversial issue. On the one hand there 
are the people who consider it to be merely a semi¬ 
skilled vocation which attracts those of mediocre ability 
and on the other there are those who rate it ahead of 
theology and medicine in the scale of professional merit. 
TChich of these two schools of thought approaches nearer 
the truth? 

At best, the answer to this question will be a 
matter of opinion. However, in order to have some basis 
for judgment a ten-point rating scale is suggested here. 
It makes use of the ten criteria or earmarks of a true 
profession which were mentioned in the previous chapter. 

A numerical value is assigned to each item on the basis 
of its applicability to teaching. These values range 
from one to five so that the maximum score obtainable on 
the ten points is fifty and the minimum is ten. The 
author*s scoring is purely arbitrary but it is an attempt 
to make a.s objective an approach as possible to a highly 
subjective problem. 

In Section X the marking has been done on the

basis of an historical survey of numerous educational and 
professional authorities. In Section II are shown the 
results of a survey of the students and instructors in a 
teacher-training institution. 








Page 28 


SECTION I 

I. A profession must satisfy an _ 1 

indispensible social need and be 1 2 3 4 5 

based upon well-established and 

socially acceptable scientific principles. 

To what extent does teaching satisfy an indispen¬ 
sible social need? The answer is that teaching is more 
important to the social well being of people today than 
any other profession or vocation. It forms the basis of 
all civilized progress. There can be no argument on this 
point. Medicine deals only with the human body and law 
concerns itself with the relationships existing between 
the various members of society, whereas teaching, in the 
educative sense, actually concerns itself with the mind of 
the individual. It does, therefore, satisfy an indis¬ 
pensible social need. 

Secondly, is the position of the teacher in our 
schools based on well-established and accepted principles? 
Do we need schools or could society itself do a better 
job of educating its members? The answer definitely 
supports the teacher-pupil relationship existent in a 
school system. Buswell of the University of Chicago 
says: (12 - p. 451) ”11 is precisely because of the 

failure of ordinary life to produce a suitable educative

Page 29 


situation that schools are established. 1 ’ 

Teaching, then, is at the top of the scale in this 

regard. 

II. It must demand an adequate X _ 

pre-professional and cultural 12346 

training. 

On this point the teaching profession is weak. 
While there are many teachers who have university degrees 
the proportion with such qualifications is not too 
impressive when compared to the vast number employed in 
tie schools throughout the country. Table VI on page 
86 provides a breakdown of the number of teachers with 
varying amounts of training beyond high school and the 
percentage of teachers with degrees in the different 
provinces of Canada, 

According to this data 17.9# of the teachers in 
Canada were university graduates in the year when the 
survey was made (1946). Sven if the number of in-service 
teachers who were working on degrees at that time were 
taken into consideration the percentage would certainly 
not be above twenty. Technically this would entitle the 
profession to one-fifth of the total on the rating scale 
but since this is the lowest possible score and there are 













Page 30. 


in reality quite a number of university graduates, in the 
ranks of the teachers, such a score would be unjust. For 
this reason the profession has been given a rating of 
two (E) on this item. 

III. It must demand the possession a 

of a body of specialized and systema- 1 E 3 4 5 

tized knowledge. 

Research in Education which has been carried on 
assiduously for the last half century has produced a body 
of knowledge wholly special to this type of work. 0. 
Lester Anderson has this to say: (13 - Vol. 8, p. 51) 

n Too many people, both within teaching 
and without, have a misconception that teach¬ 
ing does not require mastery of a body of 
professional content. These persons are not 
aware of the great body of research in edu¬ 
cational psychology, methodology, curriculum 
and other fields that has been accumulating 
in the last fifty years.” 

On this item teaching can definitely be given 
top score. As regards a body of professional knowledge 
it must be rated as being equal in status to the generally

recognized professions such as medicine, law or dentistry. 

IV. A profession must give evidence X 

of needed skills which the general 12345 

public does not possess; that is, 

skills which are partly native and partly acquired. 

There can be no denying that our foremost teachers 
and educators possess many skills not held by the public. 
Some skills, such as academic knowledge and professional 
techniques, are acquired. Others, such as personality, 
character and general intelligence, are generally admitted 
to be partly native. However, these skills are fully 
developed only in the best instructors. There are many 
in the profession who through lack of training and 
experience cannot be said to possess adequate profession¬ 
al skill. All provinces still certify a great number of 
teachers with little academic or professional training 
and these people can hardly be said to possess skills 
not found in the general public. 

With due regard for both groups, the highly 
skilled, competent teacher and the relatively unskilled 
junior teacher, the profession rates about midway on the 


scale

V. It must have developed a _ X 

scientific technique which is the 12345 

result of tested experience. 

The methodology and techniques imparted to the 
teacher during his period of training and practice teach¬ 
ing is definitely the result of tested experience. 

Teacher training institutions would be in an indefensible 
position if they expounded dogma or methodology which was 
founded on pure conjecture. However, the study of 
certain fields in education is still in its infancy with 
the result that the prospective teacher does not receive 
a great deal of guidance in the problems related to these 
subjects. Furthermore there is a certain amount of 
disagreement among educational authorities themselves on 
many fundamental issues. Disagreement in the philoso¬ 
phies is to be expected, but the fact that there are 
widely divergent views even in psychology which deter¬ 
mines methods and techniques is not too commendable. 
Therefore, a top rating cannot be assigned to this item. 
However, in view of the methodology and technique which 
have been developed, a fairly high score seems indicated 
so a value of four has been chosen.

VI. It must require the exercise X 

of discretion and judgment as to the 1 S 3 4 5 

time and manner of the performance 

of the duty. This is in contrast to the kind of work 
subject to immediate supervision. 

The teacher in the school is largely required to 
exercise his discretion as to the methods he employs in 
the performance of his duty. For this reason teaching 
should perhaps receive a score of five here. However, 
other factors have to be considered. The teacher*s work 
is expected to reach a certain minimum standard. Also, 
he is subject to supervision by an inspector and despite 
the fact that this inspection takes place only once or 
twice per year, it still imposes some restrictions upon 
him. Should there be a principal over him, the amount of 
supervision is increased. 

Therefore the score on this item must be reduced 
to a certain extent also. 

VII. It must be a type of beneficial 
work the result of which is not sub¬ 
ject to standardization in terms of 
unit performance or time element. 

There is no need to justify the assertion that 
teaching is a type of beneficial work. That point was 
quite thoroughly settled in item one. The question of 
the time element, also, needs no great stress. No one 













































0 





Page 34 


would claim that a teacher 1 s efficiency is measured by 
the amount of time he spends in the classroom. There is, 
however, the question of unit performance. Pupils in 
our schools are expected to cover certain units of work 
during the school year. Is this an attempt to evaluate 
teaching or rate one teacher against another? This could 
hardly be the case. It would appear to be more an 
attempt at standardization on a province-wide scale for 
administrative purposes rather than an evaluation of 
teaching merit. 

Neither good nor poor teaching can be evaluated by 
any objective test and therefore a score of four on this 
item is not out of order, 

VIII. A profession must have a group 
consciousness designed to extend 
scientific knowledge in technical 
language. 

In the last twenty years there has been a con¬ 
siderable growth in the group consciousness of teachers, 
but whether this has been for the primary purpose of 
extending scientific knowledge is open to question. 
Teachers are becoming more aggressive in promoting 
measures conducive to their own welfare, in setting up 
salary schedules, in demanding collective bargaining 


























































- 

, 








Page 35 


and in demanding leadership in professional organizations. 
One school of thought holds that these measures are 
purely selfish, the other contends that until the pro¬ 
fession is made sufficiently attractive it will not pos¬ 
sess the individuals capable of working aggressively for 
the welfare of the children and the public at large. 

With conditions as they are at present, therefore, 
the only possible rating on this item is about midway 
on the scale. The profession has developed a group 
consciousness, but the motives of this group spirit are 
still open to question. 

IX. A profession must have suf- X 

ficient self-impelling powers to 12345 

retain its members throughout life. 

It must not be used as a stepping-stoneto other occupations. 

This characteristic is definitely not applicable 
to teaching and its absence forms the root of most of our 
professional troubles. Anna Bernard says: (14 - p. 18) 

!, The little red schoolhouse, that noble 
institution, has become a second-rate transients 
hostel. The average teacher does not regard 
himself as being permanently settled but hopes 
to step up into marriage or university or busi¬ 
ness within a year or two. f1

The average tenure of teachers is hard to determine 
but estimates are, on the average, that teachers teach 
for from six to eight years and this ignores the large 
number who left the profession permanently during the war 
years. On this score teaching definitely rates at the 
bottom of the scale. 

X. It must recognize its obliga- X 

tions to society by insisting that 1 Z 5 4 5 

its members live up to an established 
and accepted code of ethics. 

All the teacher organizations in Canada have 
adopted codes of professional etiquette. Usually, also, 
they possess a Grievance Committee or a Disciplinary 
Committee to see that the code is enforced. This state 
of affairs is very encouraging when compared to the 
situation a decade ago. During depression days many 
teachers completely disregarded all ethical conventions 
in obtaining positions and they did so with impunity. 

This situation has changed but even today instances are 
hard to find where teachers are disbarred because of 
unbecoming conduct. Furthermore, teacher training insti¬ 
tutions have not yet accepted as their responsibility 
the teaching of professional standards. Much remains 
to be done in this regard. 












Page 37 


The conclusion is that teacher organizations have 
codes of ethics and the machinery for their enforcement. 
This machinery is employed from time to time but on the 
whole there is a certain justification for the charge that 
this enforcement is somewhat lax.

SECTION II 

The ten-point scale used in the previous section 
was embodied in a questionnaire and distributed to the 
students and instructors of the Faculty of Education, 
University of Alberta. The purpose was to determine the 
opinions held by teachers and student teachers concerning 
their own profession. Four different groups were selected: 
first-year students, fourth-year students, graduates, and 
instructors. 

The results of the survey appear in Tables II, 

III, IV and V. These tables show the frequency with 
which the various classes selected certain values on 
the five-point scale together with the Arithmetic Means 
of the total scores. The Mean scores v/ere calculated in 
order to provide a method of comparison with the rating 
done in Section I. The number of questionnaires dis¬ 
tributed to each class was not the same, but this is due 
to the limited number of students available in the senior 


groups.

Page 45, 

Only the average rating of the first year stu¬ 
dents equals that arrived at in Section I. The other 
groups ranked the Teaching Profession considerably lower. 

The most significant feature brought out by the Tables and 
the graph in Figure I is the progressive downward trend of 
the scoring as done by the students. The first-year stu¬ 
dents* rating was the highest, the fourth-year students 
came second, and the graduate students were the lowest of 
all. The instructors 5 rating , in total score, equalled 
that of the senior students. 

A possible reason for the progressive downward 
trend mentioned is the increasing maturity of the students. 
The freshman class has been out of high school for only 
one year and may be more idealistic than the senior students 
who through their studies have obtained a clearer picture 
of teaching as a profession. The graduate students are 
all experienced teachers who have faced the harsh reali¬ 
ties of conditions in the field and possibly tend to be 
cynical. The instructors, of course, are experienced 
teachers also, but they are obviously successful in their 
chosen profession and therefore tend to rate it fairly 
high. The judgment of the instructors should be the most 
competent and dependable unless, of course, they have been 
out of touch too long with the problems of the ordinary 


teacher 










Page 46 


All groups rated the individual items fairly 
consistently, about half way up the scale. The exceptions 
to this general distribution were Items 1, Z and 9. Item 1 
invariably ranked high, showing general agreement on the 
principle that teaching satisfies an indispensible social 
need. Item Z was low except in the opinions of the first- 
year students. They may have misunderstood the meaning of 
the term "pre-professional" as distinguished from profes¬ 
sional training. If not, they have a much higher opinion 
of the educational standards of teachers generally than 
evidence would permit. Item 9, dealing with the profession¬ 
al life of the teacher, was low in every group. Recent 
propaganda sponsored by teacher organizations concerning 
the high professional-mortality rate among members seems 
to have been effective. There is a more general realiza¬ 
tion that, until now, teaching has been used as a stepping 
stone to other vocations. 

The total scores obtained from this survey are 
generally lower than those obtained in Section I. Members 
of the profession themselves admit that, as a group, they 
fall far short of the standards which should exist. The 
answer to the question, "Is teaching a profession?" must 
be qualified. It is given the title of "profession", but 
there remains much to be done before true professional 
status can be claimed.

CHAPTER III 


THE ROLE OF THE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION 

One of the basic problems facing the teachers of 
Canada as a professional group is disunity. The cause of 
this is to be found in the Articles of Confederation which 
gave complete autonomy to the provinces in all matters per¬ 
taining to education. Provincial autonomy was a necessity 
at the time of Confederation and is necessary even yet, but 
it has proven inimical to the development of a professional 
group consciousness. Such provincial autonomy has fostered 
the development of serious sectional differences, especially 
between central and western Canada. Professional teacher 
organizations have taken the first step toward unification 
by constituting a common central body, the Canadian 
Teachers 1 Federation. However, this organization lacks 
the effectiveness it should have because it is still 
subject to sectional influences. The various provincial 
organizations affiliated with it have been unwilling to 
surrender any powers to the central executive and it 
therefore remains a mere figurehead. 

The following section contains an outline of the 
organization and policy of the Canadian Teachers’ Federation. 






Page 48 


The Canadian Teachers* Federation 

The Canadian Teachers* Federation, representing pro¬ 
fessional organizations in each of the provinces of the 
Dominion, was first organized in 1919 and was incorporated as 
a public corporation in 1946 with head offices in Ottawa* 
Since that time it has attempted to obtain the co-operation 
and the co-ordination of all provincial teacher organiza¬ 
tions upon policies and activities of common interests* Its 
more important aims are: (l) to provide means for the ready 
exchange of information of mutual interest to those engaged 
in the teaching profession; (2) to improve the social and 
economic well-being of those engaged in the teaching profes¬ 
sion; and (3) to foster good will and mutual understanding 
between the provinces and to give leadership in matters which 
tend to foster a national outlook* 

ORGANIZATION 

The salient features of the constitution adopted in 
1946 are: 

1* Each of the ten affiliated organizations appoint 
three members to the central body except in those 
eases where there is more than one affiliated 
organization in a province. In such cases these 








Page 49 


bodies are limited to a total of three members. 
2. The corporation holds annual general meetings. 
3* Each member present at a general meeting is 
entitled to discuss and vote upon the business 
placed before the meeting. 

4* The officers of the corporation are elected at 
the annual general meeting except for the 
Secretary-Treasurer 'who is appointed on a full¬ 
time basis. 

5. A measure dealing with matters of policy must 
be passed by a two-thirds majority vote. The 
same is true of amendments to by-laws. 

6. The affiliated organizations are the following: 

(a) British Columbia Teachers* Federation. 

(b) Alberta Teachers* Association. 

(c) Saskatchewan Teachers* Federation. 

(d^ Manitoba Teachers* Society. 

(e) Ontario Teachers* Federation. 

(f) Provincial Association of Protestant 
Teachers of Quebec. 

(g) Federation of English Speaking Catholic 
Teachers, Inc., of Quebec. 

(h) New Brunswick Teachers’ Association. 






(i) Nova Scotia Teachers 1 Onion. 

(j) Prince Edward Island Teachers 1 Federation. 

7. Any teacher organization desirous of affiliation 
must submit copies of its Constitution and xt,s 
By-laws before being admitted to membership. 

Such would be the case, for example, should the 
teachers of Newfoundland wish to affiliate. 

8. The affiliated organization, in respect of 
each of its members, must pay an annual fee 
to the corporation. The amount of the fee is 
determined at the annual general meeting but 
shall not in any case exceed one dollar. 

POLICY 


The constitution of a professional organization is 
significant in that it limits the powers of the corporate 
body and determines the course of action to be followed in 
the conduct of business. lore important than the consti¬ 
tution, however, is the policy of the organization. The 
policy determines the fundamental objectives and purposes. 
The policy determines what the organization actually is. 
Because of the vital nature of expressions of policy, the 
National Policy of the Canadian Teachers 1 Federation, as -

adopted at its convention in August, 1946, is included here 
almost in its entirety. This policy, as outlined, constitutes 
the Magna Carta of education in Canada. 

The Canadian Teachers 1 Federation, representing pro¬ 
fessional organizations in each of the provinces of the Do¬ 
minion, was organized in 1919* Since that time, through its 
annual conventions and other activities, it has given con¬ 
tinuous leadership both to the public in matters pertaining 
to education and to the teaching profession in the establish¬ 
ment and maintenance of standards of professional service* 

In adopting a national policy, the Canadian Teachers® 
Federation accepts and respects the established principle 
of provincial autonomy in education. At the same time it 
stands committed to the policies of equal educational oppor¬ 
tunity for all citizens and the encouragement of national 
unity through the schools. This statement of policy is 
intended to serve both the teaching profession and the 
public, giving them a clear view of the standards and 
objectives necessary in Canadian education* 

Educational Rights and Services 

1. It is the inalienable right, of every Canadian to have 
that form and extent of free education for which his 









(

Page 52. 

capacity is suited, and to have the services of carefully 
selected and adequately trained teachers. 

2. There must be no discrimination because of sex, race, 
colour, creed, social, economic or political considera¬ 
tions. 

3. The educational systems of the nation should inculcate 
an appreciation and understanding of the obligations and 
privileges of citizenship and should promote national 
unity. 

4» Provincial programs should be co-ordinated sufficiently 
so as not to impede the progress of pupils transferring 
from one province to another. 

3. Within the present structure of provincial autonomy, 

Federal grants in aid of education should b© made to the 
provinces, designed to ensure a minimum standard of 
educational opportunity and to promote the improvement 
and expansion of educational services throughout the 
Dominion. 

Educational Administration and Finance 

L. The administration and control of education should remain 
with the provinces, which should be responsible for the 
maintenance and co-ordination of all forms of public 
education within the province, except where it is deemed 

















. 








Page 53. 


advisable to delegate power to local authorities. 

2 . In each province, attendance should be compulsory up 
to the age of sixteen. 

3 . Students should b© provided with aid to a degree that 
the privilege of higher education would depend upon 
capacity and interest rather than upon the financial 
resources of the parent. 

4. A basis of taxation should be provided which would 
ensure equality of opportunity and the maintenance and 
development of educational services. 

5. Financial support should be provided to the extent 
that no class would exceed twenty-five students in 
the primary and not more than thirty in other grades. 

6 . Schools should be under democratic control. 

7 . Wherever feasible, school district organization should 
be on the principle of the ’’larger unit of administra¬ 
tion". 

Professional Training and Status 

1. Teachers should be accorded the privileges of citizen¬ 
ship with the right to become candidates for election 
to offices, whether municipal, provincial or federal, 
without prejudice to their engagement or continued 
engagement.

Page 54 


2♦ Teacher training and certification boards should be 
established in all provinces, the membership of which 
will include representation from the provincial teach¬ 
ers* organizations. 

3* All teachers must have professional training. 

(a) Elementary school certificate should require not 
less than Junior Matriculation or High School 
Graduation and two years of professional and 
further academic training. 

(b) The High School certificate should require a 
university degree or its equivalent and one year 
of professional training. 

(c) The ultimate aim is that all teachers shall hold 
a university degree. 

4. Professional standards should be sufficiently uniform 
between the provinces to facilitate the acceptance of 
certificates by all provincial authorities with a 
minimum of additional training. 

5 . Every teacher in a publicly supported school should be 
a member of the respective provincial organization and 
the collection of fees of the provincial associations 
should be made by deductions at the source. 

6 . The opportunities for teacher exchange should be pro¬ 


moted and extended

7. A teacher should have security of tenure and should not 
be dismissed except for cause, subject to appeal before 
a Board of Reference. 

8. Provincial organizations affiliated with the Canadian 
Teachers' Federation should have official representa¬ 
tion on policy forming bodies, especially those con¬ 
cerned with curriculum, teacher certification and 
teacher pensions. 

9. The prescribed statutory minimum salary in all pro¬ 
vinces should be on the schedule principle. 

(a) Such schedules should establish a compulsory floor 
below which the salary of any teacher may not 
fall. 

(b) Such schedules should constitute a basis upon which 
government grants toward teachers’ salaries are 
paid. 

(c) School Boards should have the right to establish 
schedules higher than those provided by the statu¬ 
tory minimum schedule. 

10. The Canadian Teachers' Federation affirms the principle 
that: 

(a) All negotiations between school boards and local 
teachers* associations should be on the basis of 


collective bargaining 






- 


















Page 56 


(b) Salary disputes, when negotiations have failed be¬ 
tween school boards and local teachers* associa¬ 
tions, should be referred to a legally constituted 
board of arbitration, whose findings shall be 
binding on both parties. 

11. Each provincial teachers* organization should adopt a 
minimum salary schedule based upon the following factors: 
(a) A minimum salary of fifteen hundred dollars for 

a fully certified teacher. 

(b^ Annual increments of one hundred dollars for a mini 
mum of fifteen years® 

(c) Additional increments for subsequent improvement in 
academic or professional standing. 

(d) Further additional increments to principals and other 
supervisory officers. 

12. Important administrative offices in education should be 
held by professionally qualified teachers and these posi¬ 
tions should command salaries equal to those paid in 
other professions, industry and business, requiring 
comparable qualifications and involving similar respon¬ 
sibilities. Salaries of ten thousand dollars should 

not be uncommon for such positions.

3 3. The pension plan in each province should include: 

(a) A retirement service pension after twenty years of 
service to which the employer would contribute at 
least fifty dollars a month. 

(bJ An annuity pension paid for by teachers* contribu¬ 
tions in accordance with actuarial tables. 

(c) Disability and last survivor clauses. 

(d) Voluntary retirement after thirty years of service 
or at the age of sixty. 

14. Wherever adequate retirement allowances are provided, 
teachers should retire at sixty-five. 

15 . Provincial regulations should include a provision for 
cumulative sick leave. 

Professional Ethics 

Each provincial organization should adopt and enforce a 
code of ethics to ensure high standards of professional ser¬ 
vice among its members. 

This formal expression of the policy of the Federation is 
an excellent procedure for informing both the profession and 
the public at large of the aims and objectives of the organisa¬ 
tion. However, the implementing of this policy is another

matter entirely, and it is here that the Canadian Teachers 1 
Federation fails rather badly. The nature of its organization 
gives it no authority over its affiliated organizations or 
over the individual members of these affiliates. Even as 
a central co-ordinating body it lacks the influence to 
vitally affect the activities of the provincial teacher 
organizations. Its finances, as a result of the ridicu¬ 
lously low membership dues, are inadequate to support any 
worthwhile projects in educational research or to sponsor 
effective publicity campaigns. The maximum fee set down 
in the Constitution is one dollar in respect of each member 
of an affiliated organization, payable by the executive of 
that organization. Even this modest levy would provide 
for an annual budget of approximately 60,000 dollars but 
the Federation's Annual General Meeting has never approved 
such a demand. 

The most urgent need of the Canadian Teachers' 

Federation is for dynamic and capable leadership which 
will make the organization the dominant power in Canadian 
education, something more than a mere figurehead. Outright 
Federal control of education is inimical to the maintenance 
of our democratic way of life and there is always the dan¬ 
ger that if the Federal Government, as some people advocate, 
assumes the responsibility for establishing national 
































Page 59 


standards in education, that this responsibility will 
gradually change into a proprietary interest. Therefore, 
some other means must be found for developing a spirit of 
national unity and providing equality of education through¬ 
out the Dominion. The logical solution would be for the 
teachers to assume the responsibility for this task through 
their national organization. Such a course of action would 
not be unprecedented for a professional body. The in¬ 
fluence of the Canadian Bar and the Canadian Medical 
Associations is supreme in their field despite the fact 
that they must also surmount provincial statutory differ¬ 
ences. Teachers can emulate their example only with 
dynamic and progressive leadership. 

One of the basic reasons why lawyers and doctors have 
been able to develop a powerful spirit of professional 
consciousness is that their allegiance is to the profess¬ 
ion as a whole as represented by the Dominion Association. 
For them the Provincial Association is a branch. For 
teachers the provincial association is the final power 
and authority and there is a feeling of jealousy and dis¬ 
trust toward the teacher organizations in other provinces. 
In fact there are some teachers in Canada today who do 
not even know that they are members of the Canadian 
Teachers 1 Federation and have annual fees paid in their 












‘

behalf. Before they can hope to achieve full professional 
recognition they must develop a feeling of professional 
unity and loyalty to their national association. 

The Affiliated Teacher Organizations 

The Provincial Organizations are autonomous in pro¬ 
fessional affairs to the same extent that the Provincial 
Governments are in matters pertaining to education. Thus, 
they set the pattern of what the profession is to be. 
Through their codes of ethics and enforcement committees 
they are in a position to ultimately affect each and every 
teacher. Further, they are the ones that collect the fees. 

In the four western provinces the powers of the pro¬ 
vincial teachers’ organizations are very similar. In each 
of these provinces there is a single professional body. 

The organization of these bodies may differ in details, 
for example, some elect officers by direct ballot while 
others do so by electoral college, but in general, the un¬ 
derlying principles are the same. Throughout all of 
Western Canada legal recognition is given to the teachers 1 
organizations. They have representation on Curriculum 
Committees, Examination Boards, Boards of Teacher Educa¬ 
tion, Certification, Faculty of Education Councils and 





























.

. 










Page 61 


University Senates. In each of the four provinces member¬ 
ship in the professional bodies is required by statute. In 
Manitoba membership is automatic upon certification although 
the teacher has the privilege, if he so wishes, of withdrawing 
upon formal application to do so. However, membership is 
practically one hundred percent. 

In the Maritime provinces the teacher organizations 
have not advanced nearly so far as have those in the west. 
Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick only recently made 
membership in the provincial organization automatic upon 
certification and Nova Scotia still does not require it. 

This makes her the only province without automatic membership 
although the voluntary membership is quite high, about 
85$. In comparison with Western Canada membership fees are 
low. For instance, in Nova Scotia the maximum fee is 
seven dollars per year while in Alberta the minimum is 
twelve dollars. Perhaps this difference is partly due to the 
lower salaries received by teachers in the Maritimes but, 
to a certain extent, it is also a reflection of the timidity 
of professional leaders in the older provinces. Such a lack 
of aggressiveness is self-aggravating. Lack of finances 
prevents the professional organization from assuming its 
rightful place in educational affairs.

Page 62 


The teachers of the two largest provinces of the Dominion 
show the least advance and the least development in profess¬ 
ional matters. Quebec has two separate and distinct teacher 
organizations while in Ontario there are no less than four. 

A multiplicity of professional bodies tends to weaken the 
over-all influence of the teachers as a group. In Quebec 
there is an obvious reason for disunity; both race and 
religion serve as barriers to professional unity. A large 
proportion of the teachers in this province are members of 
religious orders and as such have no professional organiza¬ 
tion. In Ontario, on the other hand, there is no justification 
for the lack of professional unity as depicted by the 
variety of organizations. Ontario has always prided her¬ 
self upon being in the vanguard in educational affairs. 

However, her teachers have allowed the development of a 
deplorable situation in matters vitally affecting their 
professional status. They have fostered professional dis¬ 
unity by forming separate organizations for men and women 
teachers. Such pettiness bespeaks professional immaturity 
and has so weakened their central body, the OnTario Teachers’ 
Federation, that is has never yet been able to meet the 
modest annual fee of forty cents which the Canadian 
Teachers® Federation levies on it affiliates. 

In conclusion, then, the teachers’organizations through-

out Canada still have much to do in developing and further¬ 
ing professional ideals. In the Maritimes and in Quebec 
there is some justification for the slow development of 
efficient and well-disciplined teacher organizations. 
Economic, religious, and racial problems are difficult to 
overcome. Ontario seems to suffer from a lack of foresight 
more than anything else. The western provinces, although 
they still have a long way to go, have at least made a 
start in the ri^bt direction* In the west there is a greater 
spirit of initiative and a corresponding desire for progress. 
An excellent example of this is the Western Canada Con¬ 
ference of Student Teachers held in Edmonton in January 1%9« 
This was the first significant step on the road to inter- 
provincial co-operation which is absolutely necessary for 
the achievement of the ultimate goal—professional unity. 

Codes of Ethics have not been mentioned in this 
chapter because it is felt that they are of sufficient 
importance to warrant a detailed and comprehensive treat¬ 
ment such as can best be given in a separate chapter*

CHAPTER IY 


PROFESSIONAL CODES OF ETHICS 

The members of a profession by virtue of such mem¬ 
bership and by virtue of the peculiar relations which they 
sustain to the community and to one another, assume ethical 
obligations of a supremely important character, and it is 
essential to the adequate performance of professional ser¬ 
vice that these obligations should be so ingrained in the 
professional consciousness as to determine the spirit of 
every professional act. 

The common knowledge and skill possessed by the 
qualified persons and the common functions they perform 
bind them together into a distinctive group, and create 
unique relations to one another and to the community, 
for they are the sol© possessors of a knowledge and skill 
upon which the welfare, perhaps the very existence of the 
community, depends. They actually monopolize this know¬ 
ledge and the layman is helplessly dependent upon them 
for the service necessary to a vital need. The weight, 
the magnitude, the vast significance of the community 
interests which depend upon the possessors of special know¬ 
ledge give a peculiar intensity, a peculiar strength to the 
obligations which rest upon them, and lift them to the 




















































Page 65 


unique plane of professional obligation, while the fact that 
they possess this exclusive knowledge and skill in common, weld 
the members of a profession together into a community; makes 
their obligations obligations of the group as a whole, and 
leads to a common ideal of service, binding upon all alike. 

A professional code of ethics, then, is the norm or stand¬ 
ard of professional conduct, for which the body as a whole 
stands. Such a code is not enforceable by law, but it has, 
nevertheless, the powerful and effective sanction of the 
collective professional judgment upon the conduct of its 
members. The individual is rare who can continue unprofes¬ 
sional conduct under the adverse judgment of the profession, 
which judgment brings with it the loss of professional 
standing. Unprofessional conduct, then, is simply unethical 
conduct, as defined by the ethical ideals of a profession. 

Such a code naturally falls into two subdivisions: 
one defines the obligations resting upon the professional 
body as a whole, the other those which rest upon each 
individual member, but which are enforced by the body as a 
whole. The distinction between the two arises from the fact 
that there are professional services and conditions of 
professional efficiency which individuals cannot supply, 
which demand for their performance the larger resources of 
the body as a whole. Such services must be undertaken by 





.

Page 66. 


those officially authorized to act for the profession, and 
there is no surer index of the degree to which the ethical 
spirit dominates a profession than the attitude toward 
these services. 

The most important of these for the teaching profession 
are: first, the obligation to fix and sustain by the whole 
weight of its influence the highest practicable standard of 
preparation for the profession; second, the obligation to make 
available to its members the collective knowledge and 
experience of the profession, by suitable means; third, the 
obligations to secure for its members by organized, persis¬ 
tent effort, and the use of every legitimate means, all the 
material conditions necessary to the highest efficiency in 
the service. The extent to which these services are per¬ 
formed measures the unity, solidarity, and efficiency of 
the organized body which constitutes the teaching profes¬ 
sion. 

The second part of the professional code includes 
those obligations which determine the conduct of individual 
members, and which must be sanctioned and enforced by the 
whole weight of professional influence. In this field the 
cardinal sins and corresponding obligations are three, and 
these three are the sources of all other professional sins 
and obligations. The first is the sin of professional

stagnation. It consists in the relaxation of professional 
interest and ambition, and the sinking into the intellec¬ 
tual crystallization and spiritual death which makes all 
service mechanical. Education is absolutely nothing but 
the systematic stimulation and guidance of life and growth, 
and the possession of life and the experience of growth are 
the sole means of such stimulation. No other stimulation 
is worthy of the name education. No other service is 
worthy to be called professional. All else is only the 
deadly routine which paralyzes and mechanizes the springs 
of action in the soul of the child. The moral energy of 
the profession is tested by its ability to eliminate this 
sin and enforce the obligation of perpetual growth upon 
its members. 

The second sin is the sin of professional dishonor. 
It consists in the selfish betrayal of the ideal of ser¬ 
vice, for the sake of personal ambition. It sinks the whole 
professional activity to the sordid level of a struggle 
for personal ends. The professional ideal requires that 
absolutely no consideration but efficient service should 
determine the position and mutual relation of the members. 
The betrayal of this principle takes a variety of forms, 
equally contemptible and unworthy of members of the pro¬ 
fession. It sometimes takes the form of giving and some-

times securing preferment by reason of political or per¬ 
sonal influences, irrespective of merit. It sometimes under¬ 
mines others to profit by their downfall. It breaks 
promises, misrepresents facts, ignores contracts, withholds 
honestly earned recognition. All this is in violation of 
professional honor, which requires bigness and magnanimity, 
and yet modesty of soul and justness, and fairness of 
judgment, which requires in the opportunity to serve, 
admires and generously recognizes the good service of others, 
and is so absorbed in the joy of service that the summons 
to a greater work finds one surprised and hesitating. The 
very atmosphere of the teaching profession should lead to 
abhorrence and scorn of these forms of professional dis¬ 
honor. 

The third is the sin of professional disloyalty. The 
teaching profession differs from the other learned pro¬ 
fessions in the fact that the service to the community is 
not individualistic, like that of the lawyer, the physician, 
and the minister. The professional service of the teacher 
cannot be efficient, without co-operation, without solidarity, 
without perfect unity of effort. The whole body must be 
single-minded. Hence the sin of disloyalty consists in the 
secrifice of the common good to exclusive individualism; it 
permits envy, jealousy, rivalry, suspicion, and mutual dis-

Page 69 


trust of one another to disintegrate the very structure of the 
profession. The normal professional solidarity breaks down 
and crumbles under this influence. 

The normal structure of the profession requires the 
function of responsibility, leadership, direction on the part 
of some, and loyal response, whole-hearted co-operation, and 
the reasonable subordination of individual points of view, on 
the part of others. The temptation to a disloyal individual¬ 
ism is greater, and the sin is more deadly on the part of the 
leader. He is unfit to be leader if he is not big enough to 
forget himself, lose himself, in the common interests of the 
profession and the common aims of the service. If he is ab¬ 
solutely disinterested, democratic, possessed with the spirit 
of fairness and justice; if he can resolutely put beneath his 
feet every individual aim, every personal influence, every 
personal consideration not intrinsic to the greatest service, 
then he can make the most effective appeal to the loyalty of 
his supporters. 

The very ABC of professional loyalty is mutual 
confidence and faith in one another. The determination to 
assume the best and believe the best, the resolute suppres¬ 
sion of distrust, is the essence of the professional atti¬ 
tude, To take this attitude summons into life the ethical 
spirit, breaks down the barriers of

individualism, and merges and blends all our interest and 
enthusiasm in the common service. 

To sum up, then, the obligations belonging to the 
organized body, which constitutes the profession as a 
whole, are three, namely: first, to maintain the highest 
standard of preparation for the service; second, to bring 
to its members, by all suitable means, the advancing 
knowledge and experience of the profession; third to se¬ 
cure for its members, by its collective influence, all the 
material conditions necessary to the highest efficiency* 

On the other hand, the cardinal sins and the cor¬ 
responding cardinal obligations of every member of the 
profession are likewise three, namely: the sin of 
professional stagnation, and the obligation of eternal 
growth; the sin of professional dishonor and the obli¬ 
gation of complete consecration to unselfish service; the 
sin of professional disloyalty and the obligation to 
mutual faith and v&ole-hearted co-operation. These are 
the great commands, and there are none greater. 

The above principles form the basis, the founda¬ 
tion, the underlying precepts upon which all ethical 
codes for teachers are built. They provide the compre¬ 
hensive ideals and it remains for the individual code to

enunciate the details. Each teachers* organization across 
Canada has its own code of ethics designed with particular 
problems in mind and adapted to particular local conditions. 
They vary somewhat as to details of standards and methods 
of enforcement but, of necessity, they have many features 
in common. The common features of the various codes have 
been selected and embodied, in the following section, in a 
typical code of ethics for teachers. In order that the 
aims of education may be realized more fully, that the 
welfare of the teaching profession may be promoted, that 
teachers may know what is considered proper procedure, and 
bring to their professional relations high standards of 
conduct, the following composite code is suggested: 

A. Standards of Conduct in Relations 
with Pupils, Parents and Community 

Teachers have professional responsibilities and 
relationships not only with their immediate clients, their 
pupils, but to the parents of the pupils and to the 
community in which they work. Some of the standards of 
conduct in these relationships, which have received 
general approval are suggested here. 

1. The teacher should recognize that the welfare of the 
child is the principal obligation of his profession® 










t'.''; ( - •

. 






■ 






* 







Page 72. 


Personal gain, pleasure, community responsibility, 
even the mastery of subject matter are subordinate 
interests of the true teacher, while service to the 
child is his first responsibility. 

2. The teacher should respect the individuality of each 
pupil and should train it according to its require¬ 
ments. This injunction is a warning against the 
dangers of impersonalism inherent in mass production. 

3. The teacher should deal justly and impartially with 
every child. Prejudice or preference because of 
differences in intellectual ability or social stand¬ 
ing have no place in the relations between a teacher 
and his pupils. 

4. The teacher should be sympathetic and courteous toward 
his pupils. No man or woman should enter the teaching 
profession without a deep interest in and a genuine 
sympathy with children. 

5. The teacher should hold inviolate all confidential 
information concerning his pupils. 

6. The teacher should refrain from imposing his religious 
or political views upon his pupils. While this advice 
is sound in general, it may, if carried to extremes, 
devitalize the character as well as the work of the 















■ 














Page 73. 


teacher. Teachers and pupils alike must be free, 
and must be encouraged, to discuss controversial 
issues in an unprejudiced and impartial manner. 

Othervdse, the art of thinking will languish, and 
the many evils which beset society will continue 
undisturbed by the light of honest criticism. 

7 . The teacher should maintain co-operative relations 
with parents. 

8 . The teacher should participate actively in the life 
of the community. As a citizen the teacher has both 
the right and the responsibility of participating act¬ 
ively in political, religious and social activities. 

As an educated person he has an added responsibility in 
such matters, and in his capacity as a public servant 
the community has a right to expect certain service 
from him along these lines* On the other hand, the 
teacher*s primary responsibility is the instruction of 
children, and it is unfair to expect him to spend all 
of the time outside of school hours in performing miscell¬ 
aneous tasks which frequently can be done as well by 
others whose vocations are not so exacting as teaching. 

9 . The teacher should avoid aligning himself with fac¬ 


tions in a community 






























■ 























' 








Page 74 


10* The teacher should refrain from belittling, in any 
way, the community in which he is employed. 

11. The teacher should not tutor pupils of his classes 
for pay. 

B. Standards of Conduct in Relations 
with Associates 

All codes of ethics for teachers place special em¬ 
phasis upon the need for harmonious and co-operative re¬ 
lations among teachers in every school system. 

1. The teacher should assist in developing and carrying 
out the policies of the school system. 

2. The teacher should support his associates in conver¬ 
sation with others both inside and outside the system, 
particularly in matters of school discipline. 

3 . The teacher should accept full responsibility for 
things which he says and does. 

4. The teacher should aid his associates by giving con¬ 
structive advice and helpful ideas. 

5 . The teacher should give due credit to his associates 
for their achievements and for assistance received 
from them. 

6 . Whenever possible the teacher should assist his fellw 
workers to obtain merited promotion. 












Page 75 


7. The teacher should refrain from interfering in any¬ 
way, unless his official position warrants it, in 
the schoolroom affairs of his associates, 

8 . The teacher should hold inviolate confidential in¬ 
formation concerning his associates. 

9. The teacher should carefully avoid gossiping about 
or criticizing adversely his fellow-teachers. 

10. The teacher should transact all official business 
through the proper channels. 

11. The teacher leaving a position should organize and 
leave for his successor such records and other in¬ 
formation as will be needed in beginning the next 
year*s work, 

0, Standards of Conduct in Relation to the 
Profession 

Members of every profession have ■ certain responsibi¬ 
lities which they carry by virtue of their membership in 
that particular social group. Some of the standards are 
given here. 

1. The teacher should manifest genuine pride in the 
teaching profession. Apologizing for it, speaking

other vocations are definitely proscribed. 

2. The teacher should support, and assist in raising, 
the standards of entrance to the profession. 

3. The teacher should be a progressive student of 
education. He should increase his educational 
equipment after entering the service and main¬ 
tain an open mind toward all forms of professional 
progress. 

4. The teacher should co-operate actively with local, 
provincial, and national professional organizations. 

3. The teacher should work actively for such economic 
and social conditions as will permit the profes¬ 
sion to render the best possible service. Adequate 
salaries, security of position, and reasonable 
retirement allowances for teachers are essential 
if the children of this nation are to be taught by 
efficient teachers.

corrupt or dishonorable practices known to exist in 
the profession.

often raise specific questions of professional ethics. 

Here, perhaps, more frequently than in any other field 
of professional relationships, proprieties are ignored 
or violated. Economic pressure or personal ambition 
sometimes tempts one to resort to unprofessional conduct. 

1. The teacher should apply only for a position known 
to be vacant. 

2. Upon accepting a position the teacher should withdraw 
all outstanding applications. 

3. The teacher should seek appointment and promotion only 
on the basis of professional merit and not on length 
of service. The use of family, political, religious 
or fraternal influences are to be definitely con¬ 
demned* 

4. The teacher should not lend himself to any form of 
self-advertising. 

5. The teacher should not underbid a rival candidate for 
a position. 

6 . The teacher should not seek an offer elsewhere for the 
sole purpose of forcing an increase of salary in his 
present position. 

7. The teacher should fulfill any and all agreements which 


he makes

The above code embodies most of the accepted 
standards of professional behavior. If all teachers were 
familiar with it and strove to conscientiously fulfill 
its requirements there would be no great need to agitate 
for professional prestige and recognition. Strict obser¬ 
vance of the code by the individual teacher and rigorous 
disciplinary action by the group in cases of violations 
would assure the maintenance of professional standards 
and, as a direct consequence, win public respect and 
recognition. Teachers, generally, fail to attain true 
professional status in their relationships with asso¬ 
ciates and with the profession as a whole; those activi¬ 
ties which are covered in Sections B and C of the above 
code. It is under these sections that ethical conventions 
are most frequently violated and teachers might do well 
to observe and to emulate the medical profession in 
these respects. 

The material in this chapter has, in part, been 
derived from the following sources: 

1. Code of Ethics of the New York State Teachers’ 


Association 









Page 79 


£. Code of Ethics of the Alberta Teachers 1 
Association. 

3. Composite Code of Ethics, as compiled by 
the research division of the National Educ¬ 
ation Association, Washington, D.C. 

It is felt that organizations such as these are pointing 
the way to greater professionalism amongst the teaching body 
as a whole and thus are making a contribution of consid¬ 
erable importance to society. The N.E.A. especially, has 
sponsored much research and provided a large amount of 
literature in this field.

CHAPTER V 


HOW PROFESSIONAL ARE THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES? 

In this study thus far it has become apparent that 
in so far as teachers 1 professional organ!zations are con¬ 
cerned much has been accomplished but much still remains to 
be done. At the provincial level teachers* organizations 
have almost achieved professional status but on the national 
level there is little of the unity befitting a profession. 
The question now is, at what stage of development is the 
professionalism of the individual teacher? 

In an attempt to determine the answer to this ques¬ 
tion two questionnaires were made up for distribution to 
the School Superintendents of the Province of Alberta, 

Series A dealt with the attitude of the teacher toward his 
work, and Series B with the attitude of the teacher toward 
his professional organization. It was not expected that a 
survey of Alberta, would give results which would convey 
the true picture.for all parts of Canada, but it was thought 
that Alberta would be a fairly representative province, 
neither preponderantly rural or urban. Series A contained 
seven classifications and Series B contained six.

A. The teacher truly professional both in his 
attitude to his work and to his organization. 

Takes an active part in professional affairs and 
keeps abreast of educational trends. Time and money 
is spent to improve his cultural and educational 
qualifications. 

B. Well qualified and efficient instructor. Very 
interested in children but does not concern himself 
with or take an active part in the affairs of his 
organization. 

C. The teacher is very ambitious for advancement 
and prestige. In all likelihood a good teacher but 
is primarily interested in what appears on his 
inspector’s report and what effect it will have on 
his promotion. 

D. The teacher is doing a "job". The work is 
congenial to him but would readily change to a 
more remunerative occupation if the opportunity 
presented itself. 

E. The teacher is conscientious and does his 
best but he teaches because he feels inadequate 
for many other types of work. Willing to 
sacrifice rewards of a more competitive profession 
for the relative security of mediocrity in teaching. 

E. The teacher is "filling in time". To him it 

is a stop-gap before proceeding to something else. 
Does not consider it a life-long career, (women 
waiting to get married). 

G. The teacher lacks basic teaching interests. 

Shirks his work and is interested in "getting by" 
the inspector and collecting his monthly cheque 
with the least effort possible.

The superintendents who consisted and returned this 
questionnaire noted the number of teachers in their juris¬ 
diction. The superintendents may have been unduly harsh in 
their rating but these results reflect their opinions, and, 
after all, there is no other group of people who are so 
well qualified as they to form opinions of the teachers of 
the province. The total number of teachers thus covered 
was 2799 which is well over a third of the teachers of the 
province and the results are not too flattering for the pro¬ 
fession as a whole. 

The first three classifications should have included 
all the teachers. A true profession would not include as members 
any who rated below this, but what are the findings? Only 
about one half of the total number are placed in these cate¬ 
gories. That leaves half the teachers to be classified as 
"unprofessional”. It would appear that as a result of the 
teacher shortage, and a consequent lack of selection and 
screening, the profession has been forced to admit to member¬ 
ship large numbers of teachers who take little interest in 
their work and are unqualified to assume the responsibilities 
of training and instructing the future members of society. 

The most discouraging result of this survey is that 
the inspectors placed twenty percent of the teachers in the 
last two groups. This means that one teacher in five actual-

B. The teachers who are good professional men but 

whose support of their organization is passive

E. This group considers the organization to be a

other similar tactics which will promote the inter

This questionnaire was not answered by so many super¬ 
intendents as the first. Many felt they were not qualified 
to assess the attitude of their teachers toward professional 
organizations or activities, and consequently the total num¬ 
ber of teachers represented is somewhat smaller. The total, 
in this case, is 2394 , about five hundred less than in Series 
A. 

The teacher’s attitude toward his associates is not 
such a serious problem as his attitude toward his work since 
it does not vitally affect the pupils under his immediate 
instruction, but the long-term results of this attitude are 
vitally important, both to the profession and to society at 
large. The superintendents’ opinions placed well over half 
of the total number of teachers in Categories A and B. The 
fact that there are only six categories on this question¬ 
naire, as compared to seven on the first one, has effected 
the score somewhat. Nevertheless the results are a great 
deal more encouraging. Except for the twenty percent in the 
last category, teachers seem to be aware that their asso¬ 
ciation is of vital concern to them and the only difference 
in their attitudes toward it is in the amount of active 
support which they give to the local branch.

Teacher Training and the Professional Attitude 

One of the requirements of a profession as given in 
Chapter I was that all its members have an adequate academic 
education. Generally this meant a university degree. How 
many of our teachers possess such qualifications? The an¬ 
swer is rather discouraging. The following table provides 
a comprehensive breakdown of the teachers in eight provinces, 
and their various qualifications.

Quebec was omitted from the above table because of 
the obvious difficulties encountered when the many Church 
schools are taken into consideration. 

It is very apparent that teaching falls short of 
professional status insofar as qualifications are concerned. 
Out of a total of 50,344 teachers employed in 194&, only 
9,015 or 17*9% were university graduates. This is a very 
poor showing for a supposedly learned profession. Far from 
measuring up to professional standards, the figures in the 
above table do not even attain the standard which would be 
set by the public in general. According to the C. a. 
report published in 1948 the majority of the lay public 
are in favor of high school graduation as a minimum of 
general education for elementary school teachers and in 
favor of university graduation for high school teachers. 
Amazing as it may seem, only sixty percent of Canada’s 
teachers are high school graduates. 

The fact that teachers do not even measure up to 
the standard that would be set by the general public is 
very alarming. The lay public, with the taxation problem 
always in mind, is inclined to require only the minimum of 
training and education from its teachers. The standards 
which the profession itself should demand should be much 






Page 88 


higher. The training of teachers should aim at adequacy 
for the maximum difficulty rather than the average diff¬ 
iculty and should never be reduced to that which would 
patently be useful in the average teaching situation. The 
profession* if it wishes to be worthy of the title, must 
devote all its energies for a good many years to come to 
the raising of standards of education within its* membership. 
Until teaching requires a minimum of two years* academic 
training beyond high school the public will never accord 
it the recognition that is its due as a dignified and 
learned profession. 

In the matter of professional training the picture 
is no more encouraging than in academic education. The 
majority of them have only eight or nine months of prof¬ 
essional training. In that time they can no more than 
acquire a few tricks of methodology and techniques. 

The underlying principles of psychology and educational 
philosophy if mentioned at all receive only a cursory treat¬ 
ment for lack of time. Surely there has been a large enough 
body of scientifically derived information developed in the 
last fifty years of educational research to warrant at least 
two years of study on the part of the teacher in training. 

The question of unqualified substitute teachers comes

Page 89 


under the heading of professional training also. Due to the 
wartime shortage of so-called fully trained teachers every 
province has issued a certain number of temporary certifi¬ 
cates or letters of authority to people who would otherwise 
be considered unfit to teach. Table VI, page 86, sho?,rs the 
number of these permits issued. These substitutes and 
correspondence supervisors do inestimable damage to the 
profession as a whole. If they are incapable of doing the 
job the children under their care suffer; if they are 
conscientious and capable and do their work fairly well, the 
experienced teachers suffer by comparison. The public is 
quick to point out every instance of good service by these 
substitutes and say that teaching does not require ary spec¬ 
ial education or training since these untrained teachers 
are performing satisfactorily. The morale and attitude of 
the fully qualified teacher suffers accordingly when he sees 
a comparison drawn between himself and someone with no pre¬ 
vious training or experience. Another big problem for the 
teaching profession to solve is the clause in almost every 
provincial school act which gives the Minister of Education 
the authority to issue special letters of authority to teach. 

The teaching profession, just as law and medicine, should 
have the power to control certification. Until the teachers 
acquire this power the educational standards of this country will

never be materially improved. 

A study of the regulations governing the certification 
of teachers in the various provinces of Canada leaves the 
reader in a state bordering on bewilderment. In no two pro¬ 
vinces are these regulations alike. Table VI gives a broad 
classification of five different types of teaching certifi¬ 
cates and even this was not sufficient to cover them all. A 
special column for miscellaneous certificates had to be in¬ 
cluded. Is there any need for this variety of certificates? 
The answer would at first glance appear to be, no! There 
is quite conceivably a need for specialized training for 
teachers in Manual Arts, Languages 9 ©t cetera, but these are 
usually taken care of under the provisions of some certain 
class of certificate. The different types of certificates 
usually refer to different standards and levels of training 
and preparation and it is for this reason that the profession 
should take violent objection to this system of certifica¬ 
tion. No person can be said to be half-qualified to instruct 
children. Either he is qualified or he isn't. There is no 
such menace as a semi-qualified doctor, so why should there 
be a semi-qualified teacher? 

Teachers have representation on the Certification 
Boards of almost every province. What they must now aim for 
is complete control of these boards in order to abolish the

anomalies of teacher certification and thereby open the way 
toward improvement of professional standards and qualifica¬ 
tions . 

Practice teaching is for the teacher what interning is 
for the doctor and the articling period is for the lawyer. 

This might be termed the period of apprenticeship were it 
not for the fact that, for teachers, it is so short it is 
hardly worth the name. A survey of the teacher-training 
institutions in Canada reveals that the average period of 
practice teaching amounts to only ninety hours. "When this 
relatively short period is compared with the years of apprent¬ 
iceship demanded by other professions, there can be no 
doubt as to why the idea is current that teaching does not 
possess or require any special skills or abilities. A 
longer period of apprenticeship is a vital need for teachers 
and for the teaching profession as a group. 

The present method of giving the student teacher his 
period of practical training in methods and techniques while 
he is attending school is wrong in principle. The purpose 
of the teacher-training institution should be to give the 
student a thorough background and training in the theory of 
educational psychology and philosophy and to leave the pro¬ 
blems of practical experience to someone else. With the

short professional life of the teacher the problems of insti¬ 
tuting a lengthier period of ajjpr entice ship are almost in¬ 
surmountable, of course, but if the profession could be made 
attractive enough to maintain its members throughout life, 
there would be a much smaller turn-over in personnel with 
subsequently smaller enrollments in teacher-training colleges 
and normal schools and a system of practical apprenticeship 
might be feasible. If the profession itself had the power to 
limit the number of trainees in the professional schools it 
would be possible to institute a system, of practical training 
similar to that employed by the medical profession. For 
instance, the larger schools might carry a student teacher on 
its staff as a supernumerary who would be assigned special 
instructional duties by the principal. A minimum of two 
years of such work would turn out fairly reliable and com¬ 
petent teachers. They would have the self-confidence to 
assume heavy responsibility and they would have the confidence 
of the parents whose children are entrusted to their care. 

The problem of improving the professional attitude 
of the individual teacher is impossible of solution under 
present circumstances. Until the teacher himself comes to 
feel that he has a personal stake in the profession no 
amount of propaganda will develop a satisfactory group con-

sciousness. The best way of giving him a stake or interest is 
to lengthen the period of training before certification to 
such an extent that the teacher will be loath to throw away 
years of study by switching to some other type of work. Two 
years of academic training beyond high school, two years of 
professional training, and two years of apprenticeship to¬ 
gether with adequate returns to make this length of training 
worthwhile, would soon place the teaching profession on a 
par with medicine and law in the eyes of the public.

CHAPTER VI 


CONCLUSIONS AMD SUGGESTIONS 

1. Conclusion s 

Teaching does not measure up to the standards of 
true professionalism. In the matter of public welfare it 
has a greater responsibility to society than any other 
occupation or calling but the teachers themselves have not, 
as yet, developed a sufficiently strong group consciousness 
to enable them to enforce professional standards and ideals 
within the group. This lack of fraternal spirit lies at 
the root of all professional difficulties and is largely 
responsible for the mediocre education which so many of 
the children of this country receive. Conditions vary from 
province to province but even in those where educational 
standards are high they could be improved a great deal more 
by a progressive and aggressive group of teachers who are 
united in their efforts to further the interests of the 
profession and of those they serve. 

Requirements as to professional qualifications are 
laid dO¥m by civil servants and not by the teachers them¬ 
selves with the result that interests other than those of 
the ultimate public welfare frequently dictate the policy 














'

Page 95. 


of teacher certification. Teachers have a certain amount of 
representation on training and certification boards in most 

of the provinces but they do not have a controlling voice 
and are frequently overruled on grounds of immediate 
economics or expediency* 

The teachers themselves might be placed in a system 
of hierarchies. Some are truly professional in their work, 
in their attitudes, and in their qualifications. High school 
teachers and administrators are, on the whole, better 
trained and better educated than the public school teachers 
and consequently have a bigger stake in the profession. 

The vast majority, however, have only high school gradua¬ 
tion or less and this fact is well reflected in their lack 
of support of teacher organizations and codes of ethics. 

The profession does not represent the expenditure of either 
a great deal of time or money on their part and they con¬ 
sider it to be nothing more or less than a "job”. They 
take no active part in professional activities and they 
merely pay lip service to their codes of ethics as was 
evidenced in the competition for positions during the pre¬ 
war depression. It is this vast majority of relatively 
untrained teachers who lower the status and prestige of 
the profession as a whole and who will be a source of danger 
to the professional integrity of the group vfoen economic

conditions change and the scarcity of teachers has given 
way to a surplus. 

The future of the teaching profession lies in one 
of two directions. On the one hand there is direct State 
service under bureaucrats appointed "from above” and on 
the other there is increasing professional autonomy granted 
by the State under certain safeguards. Which it is to be 
depends partly on the energy and foresight of our profes¬ 
sional leaders and, to a very large extent, on the support 
which the rank and file of the teachers accord these leaders. 
True professional status implies professional autonomy.

2. Suggestions 

To strengthen teaching as a profession, it must first 
of all attract more young men and women of ability who will 
accept it as a life-long career. Higher salaries are vital 
in this regard but higher salaries do not provide the com¬ 
plete answer, and they should not be the first objective in 
the campaign for greater recognition. Adequate remuneration 
is the result, not the cause, of high professional standards. 
Therefore the teachers of Canada must give their attention 
to other problems of professionalism to the same extent or 
perhaps even to a greater extent than they now do to the 
problem of higher salaries. 

The first objective in all the provinces should be 
statutory membership in the provincial teachers’ organiza¬ 
tions. Once this has been achieved the way will be open 
for concerted group action on the provincial level and for 
greater support of the Canadian Teachers* Federation so as 
to allow it to become a powerful influence in national 
affairs. A national body with jurisdiction over all the 
teachers of the country would have a far greater voice in 
the enforcement of professional policy than nine individual 
organizations and would be a potent force in the abolition 
of sectional strife and jealousy in the Dominion.

With the teachers united in a strong, central, 
corporate federation, they would be in a position to achieve 
those more specific objectives necessary for improved pro¬ 
fessional status* From this study it has become apparent 
that some of the specific objectives should be: 
a* Control of the Teacher-Training and Certification Boards 
in the various provinces. At present teachers only have 
representation on these Boards and they can be too 
easily overruled* Certification is the key to the en¬ 
forcement of higher standards and should b© in the hands 
of the profession. 

b. Rigid selection, on a quota system, of the entrants to 
teacher training institutions. At present with a 
shortage of teachers, such a move would be impracticable 
and would not be tolerated by public opinion, but it 

is an essential one so that the profession will not 
become flooded with semi-trained teachers. 

c. A minimum of two years pre-professional or cultural 
training beyond the high school level. Medicine and 
law require this much and it is even more important for 
teachers, who are entrusted with the responsibility of 
passing on culture and learning to future citizens, to 
possess an adequate background of general knowledge. He 
who would educate others must first educate himself.

d. A minimum of two years professional training. The body 
of knowledge available in educational psychology and 
philosophy certainly warrants a longer period of train¬ 
ing than is being provided in the majority of teacher¬ 
training institutions in Canada. Other professions 
demand considerably more than two years and the public 
will hardly be willing to admit that any one with only 
a few months specialized training has acquired any very 
specialized skills or techniques. 

e. The institution of a period of apprenticeship—-at least 
one year—for graduate teachers before certification. 

The "laboratory school" which would carry these apprent¬ 
ices as supernumerary to the normal complement of teach¬ 
ers would provide them with methodology and practical 
skills and turn them out as qualified and finished 
teachers. With the large turnover in personnel that the 
profession is* and has been, experiencing up to the 
present time such a system of apprenticeship would be 
extremely expensive but once the people who are in the 
profession embrace it as a life-long career there would 
be a smaller number of new teachers required each year 
and the scheme would be quite feasible. 

f. The inclusion of a course in professional ethics in the 




'

.. 











curriculum of every teacher training institution. Such 
a course would be the only method of insuring that all 
teachers are properly informed about desirable profes¬ 
sional relationships. The Education Undergraduate 
Society of the University of Alberta is accomplishing 
a great deal through its Professional Emphasis Committee 
and the activities it sponsors, but even more needs to 
be done in this field. A phase of professionalism as 
vital as ethics should certainly deserve a place on the 
curriculum of the professional school. 

The encouragement of educational research. Teachers* 
organizations should take definite measures to recognize 
and encourage worthwhile research projects. There is a 
great need for further knov*r ledge in almost every branch 
of education and nothing would so enhance the prestige 
of the profession in the eyes of the lay public as the 
realization that teachers devoted themselves to con-» 
tinuous study and research for the good of society as 
a whole. The Canadian Teachers* Federation, through lack 
of finances and initiative, has done practically nothing 
to further educational research. IMhat has been done on 
the national scale has been accomplished through the 
efforts of The Canadian Educational Association, a body

which, unfortunately, is not a teacher organization. 

Many of these suggestions will, of course, be impos¬ 
sible to implement for a number of years to come, but it is 
vital to the interests of all teachers, as well as society 
as a whole, that vigorous efforts be made in that direction; 
otherwise the profession will not even be able to hold the 
ground it has gained, much less advance!
