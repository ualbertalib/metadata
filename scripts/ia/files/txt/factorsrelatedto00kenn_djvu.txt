FACTORS RELATED TO THE KEEPING QUALITIES 
OF CUT FLOWERS 


Lorene Louise Kennedy 


INTRODUCTION 


The problem of extending the life of flowers after 
they have been cut from the plant is one which has interested 
people for many years. The work done in this field has been 
undertaken with the object of increasing the life of the flowers 
because of economic advantages. That is, practical treatments 
have been sought whereby the grower, florist and buyer can im¬ 
prove the keeping qualities of the flowers. 

In the experiments undertaken by the various workers 
no attempt has been made (as indicated by the available litera¬ 
ture) to carry out a program in which physiological processes 
of the flower such as transpiration and respiration have been 
measured and correlated with keeping qualities. Laurie (6) 
does suggest that a beneficial treatment, that is, one which 
would improve the keeping qualities of the flower, would in¬ 
crease transpiration rate and reduce respiration rate, but he 
does not give any experimental evidence to support this state¬ 
ment. These men recorded the number of days the flowers lasted 
in the various experiments and the t reatments were recommended 
or rejected on this evidence. From a study of the literature

it is readily seen that there is great variation and inconsis¬ 
tency in the results obtained: a chemical is rejected in one 
report and highly recommended in another. A part of this con¬ 
fusion undoubtedly arises from the different conditions under 
which the experiments were run but the experimental work on 
this subject will never rest on a firm basis until some attempt 
is made to understand the normal physiology of the flower con¬ 
cerned and the effect of the various treatments on the metabolism 
of the flower. Furthermore, each species must be thoroughly 
understood physiologically before one can begin to improve its 
keeping qualities. The method of simply trying out different 
treatments on the flowers in the hope of finding a favorable 
one is at best a haphazard one and is an elementary stage in 
coping with this problem. 

Beside the fact that better progress would be made in 
finding good practical methods of improving the keeping qualities 
of flowers by the physiological method this problem offers an 
interesting approach to the general question of longevity. Why 
is it that some plants lose their flowers in a few hours, others 
not for months? Of course it is known, with regard to flowers, 
that longevity is intimately related to fertilization and seed 
setting. Flowers that must be cross-fertilized last longer than 
those normally self-fertilized: where plants produce only a few 
or only one flower in a season, such as some of the orchids, the 
flowers last longer than those produced by plants which give 
rise to a profusion of flowers in a season. But what are the 
different mechanisms involved here? The writer is well aware

that it is easy to raise such questions and very difficult to 
answer them, nevertheless even the raising of such questions is 
of some use in the progress of understanding this problem. 

In this regard Molisch (11) in his discussion of 
longevity of plants states, "In addition to the art of maintain¬ 
ing plants in a healthy condition during their normal span of 
life and up to their natural death we are interested also in 
extending their lives beyond the normal period, for this gives 
us a deeper insight into various phenomena of plant life, espec¬ 
ially into the nature of old age and its associated decadence." 
He 1s concerned here with the longevity of the whole plant but 
the same holds true for a study of the longevity of the various 
organs. 

After a survey of the various methods used in attempt¬ 
ing to improve the keeping qualities of cut flowers it was con¬ 
sidered that the chemical method was best suited to the pursuance 
of this work. The object of these experiments is to discover if 
certain physiological factors or processes are related to the 
keeping qualities of cut flowers and to determine what this 
relationship might be. 

The work reported in this thesis may be divided into 
two parts. In Part I a search was made for a chemical or 
chemicals which induced a marked response from a given flower, so 
that, starting with this response,the physiological factors so 
affected might be studied and attempt made to understand what 
effect the chemical had on the flower. At the same time many 
recommended chemical treatments were given at least one trial.

Having chosen the chemicals and the species of flower to be used , 
the writer proceeded in Part II to study under controlled con¬ 
ditions the physiological reactions of the flowers as interpreted 
through transpiration and respiration responses and to correlate 
them with keeping qualities. 


LITERATURE REVIEW 


Although all the methods put forward by the various 
workers were not studied in this thesis it was thought that a 
general review of the literature would be of value in the under¬ 
standing of this many-sided problem. The approaches which have 
been taken may be discussed under the following headings: 

1. Mechanical Methods: these methods include various 
stem treatments, types of containers, hardening etc. 

2. Physical Methods: such methods involve variations 
in the temperature, humidity and gaseous atmosphere around the 
flowers. 

3. Chemical Methods: these methods are concerned with 
the addition of chemicals to the water in which the flowers are 
kept. 

Mechanical Methods 

It is in this category that many '’popular” practices 
fall. These practices are not based on experimental data and do 
not merit serious consideration, however they illustrate one

approach to this problem. 

(1) Cutting stems under water . The practice of cutting 
the flower stems under water before they are placed in water 
instead of ordinary cutting in air has been advocated. The 
reason given is that this prevents air bubbles in the conduct¬ 
ing vessels of the xylem and facilitates the rise of water in 

the stem. Laurie (6) claims that the effect of cutting stems 
under water varies with the species of flower. Those flowers 
such as sweet peas and asters which have small conducting vessels 
were aided by this practice while flowers such as stocks with 
large conducting elements were not benefited. 

(2) Type of container . Many recommend a deep container 
in which most of the flower stem is in contact with water which 
will prevent evaporation from the sides of the stem. Fourten and 
Ducomet (1) state that flowers keep better in shallow containers. 
Laurie (6) showed by experiments in depths of water ranging 

from one-half inch to ten inches that flowers keep as well and 
often better in shallow containers. The reason given is that 
less stem surface is exposed to bacterial action in shallow con¬ 
tainers. He also demonstrated by sealing various parts of the 
stem that the greatest amount of water is absorbed through the 
cut end of the stem and thus deep water does not aid in absorption. 

(3) Hardening flowers . The question of whether 
flowers should be "hardened” is more important than the foregoing 
ones as it is a commercial practice. "Hardening” is the practice 
of placing the flov/ers in a deep receptacle of cold water in a 
cool dark place for several hours before they are subjected to

either shipping or ordinary room conditions. Tincker (22) 
states that this practice is of agreed practical importance 
among flower growers in England and on the continent. It has 
been found through experience that preliminary saturation before 
shipment (anywhere from twelve to twenty-four hours) which in¬ 
duces the plant tissues to take up a maximum amount of water 
greatly prolongs the life of many species of flowers. This 
hardening is also practiced by florists for twenty-four to 
forty-eight hours before the flowers are offered for sale. 
However, there has been no experimental work carried out using 
this treatment. This is a good illustration of the many prac¬ 
tices for prolonging the life of flowers which appear to have 
no experimental basis but are firmly established as cultural 
practices. It would be reasonable to suppose that the conditions 
of low temperature and high humidity would be beneficial to the 
flowers. 

Phy sica1 Methods 

These are methods involving variation in the tempera¬ 
ture, humidity and gaseous atmosphere around the flowers. These 
methods have to do with storage procedure as it is only in 
storage that these factors can be controlled. 

Hitchcock and Zimmerman (3) carried out experiments 
in which cut flowers of cosmos, coreopsis, dahlia, carnation, 
rose and gladiolus were subjected to varying humidities and 
temperature. With constant temperatures they found that coreop¬ 
sis lasted four times as long at 5°C. as at room temperature 
(21°C. approximately). Neither cosmos nor dahlia wero - benefited

by low temperatures. When coreopsis flowers were kept at room 
temperature during the day and at 10°C. during the night a 
gain of two days in keeping time resulted. A further gain of 
two days showed that high and low temperature alternation is 
more effective on a twenty-four hour basis than on a day and 
night basis. Coreopsis stored for three days at 5°C. lasted 
an additional three days when removed to room temperature while 
fresh flowers kept under room conditions lasted three days. 

This is evidence in favor of the positive side of the contro¬ 
versy about whether storage at low temperature adds to the life 
of the flower or merely holds the flower in good condition. 

On the other hand Ries (18) says that for each additional day 
carnations are stored at low temperature they will last one day 
less after removal to room temperature. That is, the life of a 
carnation is the same whether it is held in cold storage or 
kept at room temperature. Roses and carnations in the Hitchcock 
and Zimmerman experiments were also benefited by low tempera¬ 
tures to about the same extent. 

In further work these men modified both humidity and 
temperature to determine the effect of humidity on the keeping 
qualities of the flowers and also to determine if this effect 
is modified by temperature. They showed that carnations kept 
two to three times as long in an atmosphere of 9Q$ saturation^ 
as they did in an atmosphere below 80^ saturation. Carnations 
lasted longer at high humidities if the temperature was low 
but humidity was a limiting factor even at 10°C. 

Thornton (21) studied the influence .of temperature.

moisture and carbon dioxide treatment on the duration of flowers. 
His principal material was roses which he sealed in cans contain¬ 
ing a weighed amount of dry ice and held at temperatures of 3 to 
14°C. After they were removed from storage the roses were held 
at room temperature with stems in water to compare the opening 
of the flowers and the time of petal fall with freshly picked 
roses. He found that after seven days treatment with a range of 
5$ to 15$ carbon dioxide the rose buds lasted as long as the 
untreated ones held under the same conditions of temperature for 
three days. Treatment longer than seven days resulted in rapid 
loss of petals when the flowers were removed to room conditions. 
Thus roses may be kept an additional four days in carbon dioxide 
storage. The effectiveness of the carbon dioxide was modified 
by moisture conditions as roses did not open as much if held 
with their stems wrapped in moist paper as when the stems were 
in water. Definite varietal differences were found among the 
roses in regard to the concentration of carbon dioxide which 
would injure the petals and these differences would need further 
study if the method was to receive commercial application. 

These results illustrate the fact so often shown by experiments 
with flowers, that different species (for example see Hitchcock 
and Zimmerman) and even different varieties react differently 
to identical treatments due probably to inherent differences 
whose nature has not yet been resolved. Thornton states that 
while the carbon dioxide treatment held flowers in the bud stage 
in no case did it benefit opened flowers. 

Longley (8) studied the effects of various gases under

storage conditions. The flowers, Briarcliff and Talisman roses 
and Matchless carnations, were kept with stems in water and 
stored in sealed cans at a temperature of 1°C. approximately. 

The roses treated with carbon dioxide (Q% to 10%) lasted slight¬ 
ly better than the untreated stored lots under room conditions 
but not as well as freshly cut flowers. Ke also tried carbon 
dioxide treatment of roses stored with stems in 10% sucrose 
solution and found that although the roses were retarded in 
opening they suffered petal injury. With the carnations the 
flowers treated with carbon dioxide lasted best of the storage 
lots and the life under room conditions was prolonged one to two 
days. It was found best to store the carnations with their 
stems in water also, rather than in sucrose. 

Whiteman and Wright (24) worked with Wedgewood iris 
blooms in the bud condition. They demonstrated that the flowers 
held in storage, with stems in water remained tight at 0°C. but 
not at 4°C. or 10°C. However, none of the stored flowers lasted 
as long as fresh picked flowers under room conditions. 

M. S. Neff has done a great deal of work on the storage 
of cut flowers. Preliminary experiments (12) indicated that 
French marigolds stored best at a temperature of 4°C. After 
several weeks storage the flowers lasted better if they had been 
stored with stems wrapped in wax paper rather than stood in 
water. 

These observations were followed by experiments with 
carnations (13). The work deals with the results of storing 
carnations with stems in water as compared to storing them ,f dry

pack". The term "dry pack" refers to storage with the sterns out 
of water. For dry pack storage Neff found that the best method 
was to place the flowers In sealed containers. When removed to 
ordinary conditions of temperature and humidity the keeping 
qualities of the stored flowers were observed and compared with 
those of freshly picked flowers. He showed that carnations 
stored dry pack for thirty-two days lasted longer at room 
temperature than those stored with stems in water and on the 
average lasted as long as freshly cut flowers. Thornton (21) 
also found storage v/ith stems out of water beneficial. Neff 
found that fresh carnations placed in water under room conditions 
gain in weight immediately and reach a maximum in thirty-six 
hours. Carnations stored dry pack behave in a similar manner 
but those stored with stems in water lost weight steadily under 
room conditions. The decrease in weight is strongly correlated 
with poor keeping quality. He showed that carnations cut at 
midday were many times better than those picked in the evening. 
On this point he is supported by work done on gladioli by Pridham 
and Thompson (16) which demonstrated that flower spikes cut 
during the heat of the day keep better than those cut in the, 
morning or evening. To account for this fact these men advance 
the theory that the cells are in a state of reduced turgidity 
and for this reason are better able to stand the shock of cutting 
and removal to abnormal conditions. 

In a carbohydrate analysis of the flower heads of dry 
pack carnations as compared with those stored with stems in 
water and those freshly picked,Neff found that the flowers stored

dry pack ware only slightly lower in total sugars, dextrin and 
starch than freshly cut flowers; on the other hand flowers stored 
in water were reduced in these substances by approximately one- 
half. This analysis suggests considerable utilization of avail¬ 
able foods by flowers stored in water. The conclusion is that 
dry pack storage in conjunction with low temperature and high 
percentage humidity (the atmosphere inside the containers is 
saturated) gives excellent storage results with carnations. He 
propounds the theory that flowers stored with stems in water 
immediately take up water and thus moisture is available for 
physiological processes. Thus even at low temperatures the 
flowers will tend to complete their developmental cycle. Cell 
development can progress only when there is sufficient moisture 
to maintain high turgor pressure; reducing water content there¬ 
fore reduces the rate at which the flowers mature. Dry pack 
flowers have just enough moisture around them from their trans¬ 
piration to keep them from becoming desiccated but not enough to 
initiate any chemical reactions. He believes this factor more 
important than reduced respiration, due to the presence of carbon 
dioxide in the sealed containers and low temperatures. 

Neff next turned his attention to storage of roses. In 
extensive experiments (14, 15) he was able to show that roses 
too kept better when stored dry pack. Furthermore the rose buds 
opened least that had been exposed to preliminary wilting of 
twelve to eighteen hours which reduced water content, — a method 
of maintaining the buds in a tight condition. However, the petals 
tended to take on a bluish cast both in storage and with carbon

dioxide gas treatment. This loss of fresh color was accompanied 
by loss of odor. In later work he found that light was an import¬ 
ant factor in storage as there was less tendency for the petals 
to become blue when the flowers were illuminated in storage. 
Chemical Methods 

These methods are concerned with the placing of one or 
more chemicals in the water in which the flowers are kept. They 
generally refer to keeping the flowers in chemical solution 
under room conditions but the definition has been extended here 
to include treatment of flowers by chemicals under storage 
conditions. 

Fourten and Ducomet (1) ran experiments in which they 
tried a great number of chemicals in different concentrations 
classifying them as acids, e.g., hydrochloric, nitric; bases, 
e.g., sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide; salts, e.g., sodium 
chloride, potassium sulphate; organic substances, e.g., tartaric 
acid; aseptic substances, e.g., boric acid and potassium perman¬ 
ganate. Compounds were described as favorable, indifferent, 
aseptic and definitely Injurious. Five to ten flowers were 
placed in each container and each treatment was replicated seven 
times. Some of the favorable compounds were: chloral (trichlor- 
oacetaldehyde), potassium nitrate, potassium hydroxide, potassium 
sulphate, potassium phosphate, sugars, ether, glycerine, calcium 
hydroxide, calcium chloride, ethyl alcohol and ammonium phosphate. 
Favorable treatments extended the life of primula, myosotis, 
asperula and silene from four to nine days. As these workers 
had no trouble with bacterial action the compounds designed to

render the water aseptic had no marked effect. The authors say 
that the chief problem is to get sufficient water to the flower 
head but no statement of underlying principles was made. Their 
work would have been more useful to other workers in this field 
had it included more extensive descriptions of the experimental 
setup, materials used and data obtained; however it represents 
the first attempt to use chemicals to improve the keeping qual¬ 
ities of cut flowers. 

In further work reported by Tincker (22) these men 
recommend sugar as one of the most useful substances and super¬ 
ior to most of the other compounds listed above. They state 
that 7 % to 10 % sugar solution is the best treatment for roses. 

Grinstead (2) claims that camphor added to the water 
will stimulate the absorption of water by the blooms and the 
presence of charcoal will keep down bacterial action. Flowers 
that have wilted will revive if placed in a solution of salt and 
warm water. 

Knudson (5) following the chemical lead of Fourten and 
Ducomet was unable to substantiate their favorable results. In 
extensive experiments employing some ten thousand cut flowers 
and many different chemical solutions he found that in no case 
were striking results obtained in regard to improved keeping 
qualities. The only recommendation he is prepared to make is 
that a mixture of strontium and calcium chloride or zinc sulphate 
will prevent bacterial action in the water, if this takes place. 
He claims that bacterial action is an Important factor because of 
two things: (1) bacteria clog the conducting vessels of the stem

and prevent the ascension of water; (2) the bacteria give off 
toxic substances as by-products of their metabolism which are 
harmful to the flower. However^Knudson thinks that it Is better 
to cut the stem end daily to remedy this condition rather than 
to use chemical substances In the solution. He states that 
common salt which he finds frequently recommended gives negative 
results. 

Hitchcock and Zimmerman (3) tested some fifty-one 
chemicals in an effort to find one, or a mixture of several which 
would give consistently beneficial results. Preliminary experi¬ 
ments were first run to determine decidedly injurious concentra¬ 
tions and then each chemical was used in concentrations ranging 
from 0.01$ to 0.000001$. Their results are definitely stated: 
"None of the compounds was noticeably effective in prolonging 
the life of cut flowers used in these experiments." The flowers 
treated were aster, coreopsis, gladiolus, phlox, delphinium and 
dahlia. Cosmos, snapdragon and chrysanthemum were subjected to 
aspirin treatments of various concentrations and were in no way 
benefited. The authors found that the flowers which had the 
best keeping qualities were those which lost the greatest amounts 
of water by transpiration, although many of the chemicals reduced 
transpiration rate. These men came to the conclusion that methods 
involving variation in humidity and temperature offered more hope 
of success than chemical methods and their work on these factors 
is discussed under storage. 

Ratsek (17) takes the view that bacterial action is an 
important factor and he studied methods of preventing it. His

work was don© with copper containers in which the active principle 
was copper oxide or copper metal. He uses ten to twenty flowers 
in each container to reduce the effect of individual flower varia¬ 
tion. In regard to keeping time the number of days is given up 
to the time when one-half the flowers in a container were ready 
to be discarded. He demonstrated that the flowers tested could 
be divided into three groups: (1) those flowers benefited by the 
presence of copper such as pansies, carnations, asters, chrysan¬ 
themums, peonies, snapdragons and delphiniums; (2) those flowers 
not affected by the presence of copper such as roses, sweet peas, 
tulips, narcissi and gladioli; (3) those flowers definitely 
injured by the presence of copper--the cyclamens. He recorded 
the amount of water taken up by the flowers in the copper and 
check (glass) containers and showed that those flowers which 
lasted best took Up the greatest amounts of water. He only gives 
the total amount taken up by each type of flower and while this 
is interesting it would have been much more useful to have record¬ 
ed the day to day absorption for both the checks and the treated 
flowers. Ratsek suggests that the copper inhibits the growth of 
bacteria in the water which clog the conducting elements and 
prevent water reaching the flower head. The reason why some 
flowers are not benefited by presence of copper is that these 
have large conducting vessels which do not easily become clogged 
with bacteria. Other workers do not consider bacterial action a 
serious trouble. 

Laurie (6) confirmed Ratsek f s results with copper except 
that he found carnations injured by the presence of copper. He

recommends three chemicals as effective in improving the keeping 
qualities of cut flowers: hydrazine sulphate, phloroglucinol 
and resorcinol. He gives four formulae: 

1. Hydrazine sulphate and manganese sulphate for roses. 

2. Boric acid for carnations. 

3. 10$ to 15$ sucrose for asters. 

4. Commercial alum, sodium hypochlorite and iron oxide for 
roses. 

These recommendations are not supported by any published exper¬ 
imental data. It might be noted that commercial Floralife con¬ 
tains three of his chemicals: hydrazine sulphate, sucrose and 
alum. 

Neff, although primarily interested in storage problems, 
has several papers dealing with chemical treatments (14, 15). 

He worked with roses and in preliminary tests found that roses 
stored with their stems in Floralife, to which had been added 
two and one-half times the sugar recommended, gave the best 
results as to color and keeping qualities. Roses stored in 
the solution for one hundred and eighty-five hours not only had 
fresh colored turgid petals but lasted longer under room condi¬ 
tions than freshly cut flowers. It might be noted that the 
flowers, although treated with the chemical solution in storage, 
were placed in water under room conditions, a variation of the 
usual chemical procedure. The effect of the chemicals was* 
modified by the presence of light as those flowers stored in the 
dark showed some tendency to a bluing of the petals. In further 
work with a number of different solutions Neff found that solu¬ 
tions containing water, sucrose and a salt of one of the heavy

metals such as aluminium sulphate or iron sulphate aided in 
improving the keeping qualities of the roses. 

It appears from a review of the literature that early 
workers thought the chemical approach most promising, while later 
workers have tended to emphasize physical methods. However, in 
the most recent work done by Heff a combination of the two 
approaches is utilized. 

Attention might be drawn to the fact that methods of 
cultivation are known to Influence the duration of cut flowers. 
Tincker (22) states, in his review of the subject of improving 
the keeping qualities of cut flowers, that under greenhouse con¬ 
ditions over or under watering, extremes in temperature, exces¬ 
sive forcing and inadequate shading of certain flowers all tend 
to curtail the life of the flowers. The level of soil fertility 
and the relative amounts of the various nutrients available to 
the plant also play an important part. The technique of cutting 
packing and transporting for market is important and varies for 
different kinds of flowers. 

Since this thesis is not concerned primarily with the 
processes of respiration or transpiration the extensive litera¬ 
ture on these subjects is not reviewed. However Miller (10) 
has given comprehensive discussions of these subjects and record 
ed an extensive bibliography, and Stiles and Leach (20) have 
given an excellent account of respiration.

EXPERIMENTS - PART I 

These experiments were undertaken to discover a chem¬ 
ical or chemicals which induced a marked response from a given 
flower. Since several workers have suggested that an effective 
chemical should affect transpiration in some way it was decided 
that transpiration rate should be recorded. The recording of 
water loss would also serve to show if physiological processes 
are affected by the different chemicals. 

Methods 

Setup for Transpiration Measurements 

Erlenmeyer flasks (200 cc.) were used as flower contain¬ 
ers. Each flask was fitted with a cork stopper through which 
the flower was inserted until the end of the stem just touched 
the bottom and thus was deep in the solution. The flowers were 
set up one to a container and each one tagged, e.g., no* 1. A 
mixture of paraffin - 20 gm., beeswax - 10 gm., and coca butter 
- 20 gm., which was easily worked yet did not melt under any of 
the temperatures experienced, was used to seal the openings and 

make the setup airtight. With checks, that is flasks with a 

piece of glass tubing substituting for the flower, it was found 

that the setup was airtight, therefore loss in weight from day 

to day was equal to water transpired by the flowers. At the 
beginning of an experiment each flower T s stem was recut; it was 
then weighed and placed in the container, after which the weight

of the whole setup was recorded. The setup was weighed each day 
and the water transpired was obtained by subtracting the weight 
of the setup from the weight recorded for it the previous day. 

The water loss per twenty-four hours was divided by the original 
wet weight of the flower to give transpiration rate. This rate 
was then expressed as water loss in grams per gram initial wet 
weight of tissue in twenty-four hours. 

Longevity of the Flower 

The length of life of each flower was noted and day to 
day notes were taken on flower appearance as an aid in the final 
decision on the chemical used. It is very difficult to determine 
just when a flower is ready to be discarded and this was one of 
the first and continuous difficulties experienced in this work. 
Many workers fail to give precise details on this point, yet it is 
very important as all recommendations as to whether a chemical 
improves the keeping qualities of a flower depend on it. For 
example, Hitchcock and Zimmerman (3) say that they took the final 
data for each treatment when the majority of flowers remained in 
good condition, however they do not state how many flowers they 
used, how they were set up or on what criteria they considered 
them ready to discard. When is a flower ready to be discarded? 
Obviously this will depend on the judgment of the person concerned 
and for this reason details should be clearly described. In 
this work the flowers were discarded on the following criteria: 
petals falling, petals discolored or bleached, petals and 
leaves (when present) wilted, odor lost or a stale smell about 
the flower. Except for the first point which was sufficient in 
itself, one or more of these criteria were considered in the

decision. 

The treated flowers were placed immediately in chemical 
solution while the checks were held in double distilled water 
under the same conditions. The water for the checks and for 
the chemical solutions was distilled first in a copper still and 
then in a glass still to make certain it contained no traces of 
other chemicals as it has been shown that extremely small amounts 
of some substances affect living tissues. In each experiment 
flowers were used which appeared similar in all respects. 

Results 


Experiment I 

Material: One dozen roses in the loose bud stage. 

Chemicals: Floralife (alum, hydrazine sulphate, sucrose, 

plus an undetermined alcohol soluble substance). 

1 gram in 30.5 cc. 

Average temperature: 24.4°C. 

Conditions: Flowers placed in solution immediately when 

received. Each flask contained 130 cc. of solution and 
held one flower. Stems not recut. 

Results: The results are shown in Table 1 and graphically 

in Figures 1, 2 and 3. From Figure 1 it can be seen that 
in general the average transpiration rates of the flowers 
in Floralife tended to be lower than those of the check 
flowers. In the case of the flowers which lasted well 
it appeared that the transpiration rate increased sharp¬ 
ly at first and then tended to level off (Figure 2);

with those flowers that did not last (Figure 3) there 
was not this final levelling off; instead the transpira¬ 
tion rate dropped rapidly after the third day. The 
length of life of each flower is shown in the table; they 
lasted one day longer than the transpiration figures 
recorded as with this method it is not possible to measure 
transpiration until twenty-four hours have passed. 

Experiment 

Material: Cultivated geranium blooms cut from potted plants. 

Chemicals: Floralife, 1 gram in 30,5 cc. distilled water. 

Average temperature: 25.6°C. 

Conditions: Geraniums cut from the plants and immediately 

placed in water or solution. 

Results: The actual results are shown in Table 2 and graph¬ 

ically in Figure 2, upper graph. The experiment ran 
nine days and at that time the majority of blooms were 
dead. The fact that each bloom consists of many small 
individual flowers which matured at different times 
introduces an error as it is difficult to determine 
when the flower is ready to be discarded. There were 
no differences between the length of life of the flowers 
in chemical and the checks. However, as can be seen 
from Figure 2, the transpiration rate was markedly re¬ 
duced by the chemical solution.

Experiment 

Material: Lupins. 

Chemicals: Calcium nitrate solutions of three concentrations 

1 gram per 78.8 cc., one gram per 157.7 cc. and 1 gram 
per 315.4 cc. distilled water. 

Average temperature: 24°C. 

Conditions: The flowers were plunged in the solutions immed¬ 

iately after cutting from the plants and held there 
for four hours. They were then transferred to tap water 
and their behavior noted. Checks were held in tap water 
for the same period of time. This treatment is the one 
prescribed to prevent w topple” of lupins or collapse of 
the stem under room conditions. It might be noted that 
holding the flowers in chemicals and then transferring 
to water is not the usual method of chemical treatment. 

Results: The actual results are shown in Table 3. The 

keeping qualities were not affected by the chemical and 
it did not prevent the collapse of the stems althougjh 
this condition was not found to be serious in this exper 
iment or in others where no figures were recorded. It 
can be seen from the table that transpiration rate is 
not affected by the calcium nitrate. The results were 
not presented graphically but they would give a graph 
like the one shown in Figure 5 on the right. 

Experiment 4 

Material: Carnations, three-quarters opened. 

Chemicals: Floralife, same concentration as previous exper¬ 
iments .

Average temperature: 26°C. 

Conditions: Flowers cut and placed immediately in solution. 

Results: The results are presented in Table 4 and graphic¬ 

ally in the left-hand graph. Figure 5. The carnations 
lasted one day longer in Floralife than in water, although 
there was considerable individual variation. From the 
graph it can be seen that transpiration was reduced to 
some extent by the chemical solution though not markedly 
so,as in experiment 2 for example. 

Experiment 5 

Material: Carnations fully opened. 

Chemicals: Sucrose, 1 gram in 181.9 cc. of water. 

Average temperature: 26°C. 

Conditions: Carnations cut and placed immediately in 

sucrose solution. 

Results: The actual results are shown in Table 5 and 

graphically in Figure 5, right-hand graph. The sucrose 
made no definite improvement in keeping qualities al¬ 
though two of the flowers in sucrose lasted several 
days longer than the others in the experiment. The 
transpiration rate was not affected by the presence of 
sucrose in the water, as can be seen in the graph. 

Experiment 6 

Material: Small white daisies (genus Anthemis), full open- 

Chemicals: Sucrose (1 gram per 181.9 cc.) hydrazine sulphate 

and alum (1 gram per 94.6 cc.) and Floralife (1 gram

per 30.5 cc. distilled water). 

Average temperature: 26°C. 

Conditions: Flowers cut and placed at once in solution. 

Results: The actual results ere shown in Table 6. None of 

the chemical treatments was effective in prolonging the 
lives of the treated flowers beyond that of the checks; 

ff Uulpkate 

the hydrazine A and alum showed some tendency : 
the life of the flowers. The transpiration rates of 
the flowers in Floralife were higher than those in the 
other solutions and in distilled water. 

Discussion of Results 

In these experiments a number of chemicals which had 
been reported to improve the keeping qualities of cut flowers 
were given at least one trial and at the same time transpiration 
measurements were taken. As well as the chemicals mentioned 
the following were tested: thymol, copper metal, copper sul¬ 
phate, lactic acid, resorcinol, phloroglucinol, aluminium 
sulphate, calcium chloride and camphor. A range of concentra¬ 
tions was used for each one but only detrimental effects were 
obtained, with the exception of the aluminium sulphate which 
effected a slight improvement. 

It is recognized that one or two experiments do not 
present sufficient evidence on which to draw conclusions about a 
given chemical’s effect on a species of flower, but these exper¬ 
iments were carried out for two reasons: first, to find a chem¬ 
ical which definitely affected the keeping qualities of a given

flower and, second, to determine if transpiration was affected 
by the various chemicals. 

From these experiments the following conclusions wer^ 


reached: 


(1) The rose is the most suitable flower to work with 
as it was definitely affected by the chemicals in most cases. 

In addition to the results reported several tests were run with 
roses in Floralife solution which were held under room conditions.' 
It was found the chemical solution was beneficial in all cases. 

It Is less difficult to determine when a rose is ready to be 
discarded than, for instance, a daisy, or one of the species 
whose bloom consists of many small Individual flowers, like the 
lupin or geranium. As roses are relatively short-lived flowers 
the beneficial effects of a chemical in prolonging their lives 
are more marked than on flowers which normally live for a con¬ 
siderable period of time. The fact that roses are the most 
important commercial flower and therefore available at all times 
was also considered in this decision. 

(2) The chemical mixture Floralife was chosen for 
further study because it gave fairly definite results with roses 
and several other flowers. It also appeared to modify transpir¬ 
ation rate and it was thought likely that it would also affect 
other physiological processes. 

(3) It appeared that low transpiration rate was corre¬ 
lated with improved keeping qualities. The increasingly concen¬ 
trated solution may have somewhat checked absorption of water by 
the flower and thus tended to produce low transpiration rates. 
However, the evidence was not conclusive and the study of this

factor was carried on in Part II. 

It was thought at the end of this part of the work 
that more definite conclusions could be drawn if future experi¬ 
ments were limited to one species of flower and studies carried 
out under controlled conditions. Controlled conditions are 
necessary as the great amount of individual variation among the 
flowers in the uncontrolled experiments made it very difficult 
to draw any conclusions regarding a particular chemical treatment.

EXPERIMENTS - PART II 


In these experiments both transpiration and respira¬ 
tion were measured and correlated with keeping quality. The 
rose variety Pink Briarcliff was used and treated with the 
chemical Floralife. 


Methods 


Measurement of Transpiration 

The setup was essentially the same as that described 
in connection with the experiments in Part I and is shown in 
Figure 6. Attention is drawn to the fact that each figure 
represents the transpiration of four flowers, not one as in the 
first experiments. A glass tube was inserted in the cork and 
each day after the setup had been weighed water was added to 
bring the weight of the setup to the initial weight; this proce¬ 
dure was designed to offset any deleterious effect on the flowers 
that an increasingly concentrated solution might have. The set¬ 
up was weighed once in twenty-four hours and transpiration rate 
recorded as water loss in grams per gram initial wet weight of 
tissue per twenty-four hours. In these experiments a more accur¬ 
ate balance was used than in the first part of the work and the 
figures are accurate to the first decimal place. 

Measurement of Respiration 

The respiration intensity of living tissue can be 
expressed by carbon dioxide evolution, oxygen uptake or amount of 
substrate decomposed. It is the carbon dioxide evolution method

which was used in this work. An apparatus is necessary for 
this purpose and it was decided to use the gas train system in 
which carbon dioxide free air is passed over the respiring 
material and then bubbled through barium hydroxide solution; the 
carbon dioxide given off by the material is precipitated as 
barium carbonate and the residual barium hydroxide titrated with 
standard acid to determine the amount of carbon dioxide given 
off in a period of time. One of the three trains of the appar¬ 
atus is shown in Figure 7. 

General Description 

The air enters at the extreme left of the figure, 
passes over the soda lime in the soda lime tower A, where the 
carbon dioxide is removed. The bottle of barium hydroxide 3 
serves as a check on the complete absorption of the carbon diox¬ 
ide by the soda lime. The carbon dioxide free air then passes 
into the flower chamber C where it becomes charged with carbon 
dioxide from the respiring plant material. This chamber con¬ 
sists of a metal cylinder which sits in a pan divided into two 
sections; the outer section is filled with a pure paraffin oil 
to make an airtight seal and in the inner section are placed 
the flowers. The carbon dioxide charged air leaves the plant 
chamber and enters the absorption tower D. This absorption 
tower is described by Truog (23). It consists of a heavy walled 
suction flask in which is set a piece of glass tubing contain¬ 
ing a mixture of glass beads and pieces of capillary tubing. 

The beads and tubing help to increase the surface of barium 
hydroxide exposed to the incoming air. In the top of the tower

is placed a dropping funnel fitted with a soda lime tube which 
holds the barium hydroxide at the beginning of the experiment. 

The glass tubing connecting the tower with the flowmeter is 
fitted with a small piece of solid glass flattened at one end to 
break the air bubbles rising up in the tower. In the absorption 
tower the carbon dioxide in the air from the flower chamber is 
precipitated as barium carbonate, the residual barium hydroxide 
being titrated with acid. The flowmeter E is essentially a 
resistor (a small piece of fine capillary tubing) and gauge on 
which to read the difference in air pressure across the resistor. 
The meter consists of two arms connected to the air line, one 
ahead of and the other following the resistor. The reading 
gives the difference in air pressure before and after the air 
has passed through the resistor. The liquid used in the gauge 
was a mixture of oil and a red dye Sudan III. Following the 
flowmeter is the safety flask F, the Important part of which is 
the Bunsen valve at the end of the delivery tube. The valve 
consists of a short piece of rubber tubing slit on the side and 
plugged with a piece of solid glass rod. The valve opens easily 
with pressure from the inside but closes on back pressure. 

G represents the pressure regulator which adjusts the unequal 
resistances of the three gas trains attached to the same suction 
pump. When the by-pass tube is up the air goes into the regula¬ 
tor and out through the tube as the path of least resistance; 
when the tube is pushed into the mercury the resistance to air 
flow is stepped up. H shows the outlets to each of the trains, 
each one controlled by a stopcock and I is the safety bottle

where pressure can build up without doing any harm. All three 
trains were attached to a suction pump which is not shown. 

Each flowmeter was calibrated and the method is shown 
in Figure 8. The method used is in principle that described by 
Smith (19). The water running into the large Erlenmeyer flask 
-) 'orn the reservoir A, displaces air which is forced through 
the flowmeter C, the air pressure thus generated being recorded 
in the changing levels of the liquid on the gauge. This pres¬ 
sure forces water out of the bottle D and into the graduated 
cylinder E at a rate depending on how rapidly the water enters 
the flask B. By a small stopcock on B one can adjust the 
pressure to a given reading on the scale. The rate at which the 
water is delivered to the graduate cylinder is taken as the rate 
of flow through that meter at the reading shown on the gauge. 

The amount of water delivered to the cylinder in two minutes 
was recorded and the amount that would be delivered in one hour 
calculated. A number of measurements were taken at different 
readings and the readings were plotted against the rate of flow 
on a graph to give a curve from which could be read the reading 
on the flowmeter for any desired rate of flow. 

Procedure in Measurement of Respiratio 

The flowers were placed in the plant chambers, the 
dropping funnels filled with barium hydroxide (.049 N) and the 
system started running. The rate of flow used was 17 litres 
per hour. Aspiration was carried on for two hours before the 
barium hydroxide was run into the towers to allow the plant 
material to come to equilibrium and to free the train of any air

which night have entered before the system was connected up. 

Then the barium hydroxide was run into the towers followed by 
carbon dioxide free water and the apparatus started running. 

At the end of two hours the air flow was stopped, the towers 
disconnected from the plant chambers and the parts washed down 
with carbon dioxide free water. The solution in the flask which 
consisted of barium carbonate, barium hydroxide and water was 
titrated immediately with .05 N hydrochloric acid in the 
presence of the indicator phenolphthalein. The titration thus 
obtained was used to calculate the amount of carbon dioxide 
liberated by the flowers. The following equation taken from 
Loomis and Shull (7) was used: 

mgms. carbon dioxide = Vx Nx 22.0 
where V is the difference between the blank and the experimental 
titration, N is the normality of the acid and 22 is the normal 
weight of carbon dioxide. The procedure is essentially that 
described by Martin and Green (9) although they did not use the 
same apparatus. 

Before the apparatus was used in experiments with 
flowers many trial runs were made to check for leaks and a 
great deal of time was expended before the system was considered 
as accurate as possible. Two types of checks were made: (1) The 
soda lime towers were disconnected and air was aspirated through 
the system for one hour. The results varied from time to time 
as the carbon dioxide content of the air is not constant but 
as all three trains always registered the same amount in a 
given run it was concluded that the apparatus was sufficiently

standardized. (2) The second method was to aspirate with carbon 
dioxide free air for the same period the experiments were run, 
that is two hours, and titrate the barium hydroxide to determine 
if any carbon dioxide had been passing through the system. Al¬ 
though absolute air-tightness could not be achieved in the time 
at the writer's disposal the errors were small and practically 
the same for all three trains. These errors were not considered 
serious as it was relative not absolute differences that were 
sought in these experiments. The respiration results were ex¬ 
pressed as milligrams carbon dioxide per gram initial wet weight 
of flower tissue per two hours. 

With regard to the general procedure of the experiments 
with roses, the flowers were set up in the containers immediately 
they were received; the flowers were shipped from an eastern 
greenhouse to a local florist from whom they were obtained the 
day they arrived. The flowers were remarkably uniform week 
after week and all in the loose bud stage.

Conditions: The roses were set up in containers, four roses 

to a container. One of the containers held double 
distilled water, A in the results, the other two held 
chemical solution, B and C in the results. Eight 
flowers were placed in solution to offset the effects 
of individual variation on the results. (The above 
conditions apply to all rose experiments.) In this ex¬ 
periment the flowers were set up without any preliminary 
treatment and the concentration of chemical used was 1 
gram in 113.1 cc. of double distilled water (10 grams 
per quart approximately).

Remarks: The flowers lasted four days, but after the first 

two days there was considerable discoloration and wilting 
of the petals in both checks and treated flowers. As 
the petals of this variety of rose do not fall until 
long after they would have been discarded the characters 
of petal color, petal turgidity and flower odor will 
have to be used in deciding when to discard the flowers. 


Experiment 5 

Conditions: One dozen roses measured for respiration and 

transpiration twice per day. One dozen held in the 
room, six in water, six in Floralife, and no measure¬ 
ments taken on them. The concentration of Floralife 
solution was raised to 1 gram in 30.3 cc. of water

Remarks: It was found that flowers held in the room did not 

last longer than those being measured for respiration 
and transpiration, therefore it was concluded that the 
flowers were not being injured by the measurements, 
in particular, the low humidity of the air in the 
respiration apparatus. Two readings a day are not 
necessary either in respiration or transpiration records.

The flowers lasted longer than in the first two exper¬ 
iments, checks five days and treated flowers six days, 
and petal color and turgidity were improved. It is 
thought that increased concentration of the solution is 
justified. Trouble was experienced with unopened buds 
which merely wilted and died; of course this would affect 
the results as each figure represents four flowers. The 
respiration results are shown graphically in Figure 9, 
page 52. 

Experiment 4 

Conditions: Flowers "hardened" 48 hours at 6°C. before they 

were set up in the containers, instead of setting up 
immediately they were received as had been the practice. 
Hardening is holding the flowers in a cool dark place 
in a deep container of cool water. One dozen roses 
were measured for respiration and transpiration and 
one-half dozen were again held in the room. Increased 
concentration of solution retained. 

Results: See Table 10. 

Remarks: It was found that hardening is beneficial as it 

does away with the trouble of unopened buds and in 
general the flowers stood up much better than when they 
had not been hardened. The roses did not last any 
longer when they were not tested for respiration and 
transpiration. The checks lasted five days, the 
treated flowers seven days.

Main Large Experiment 

Following the preliminary experiments a large experiment 
was 3 et up consisting of ten experiments, each employing one 
dozen roses and all carried out under the same conditions. It 
is from this experiment that most of the final conclusions are 
drawn. 

Conditions: Floralife used in the concentration of 1 gram 

in 30.5 cc. distilled water. Flowers hardened twenty- 
four hours at 3°C. Four flowers in each experiment were 
in distilled water, eight in chemical solution. Respira¬ 
tion and transpiration were measured once a day. Ex¬ 
treme care was taken in all procedures to have exactly

The results of this large experiment are shown in 
Figure 4, page 27, and Figure 9, page 58. From the results of 
this experiment it appears that transpiration rate is not affect¬ 
ed by the Floralife solution. Attention is drawn to the fact 
that the averages may not give a true picture as there was so 
much variation in the transpiration figures. The flowers in 
Floralife solution showed respiration rates which were higher 
than those of the flowers in water. Again, the averages may 
not be justified although there was not so much variation in 
the respiration figures as in the transpiration figures.

DISCUSSION 

Generally speaking, the keeping qualities of a cut 
flower depend on a number of Interdependent factors such as: 
specific nature, methods of cultivation, maturity, time of cut¬ 
ting and subsequent treatment. The failure to take all these 
factors into consideration leads to inconclusive experimental 
results. These experiments have been concerned with the factor 
of subsequent treatment and the other factors have been controlled 
as carefully as possible. 

From the experiments in Part I it appears that in 
general the chemical mixture Floralife (alum, hydrazine sulphate, 
sucrose plus an alcohol soluble substance, undetermined) has a 
beneficial effect on the flowers tested and also that it tends 
to decrease transpiration rate at the same time. These data 
would lead one to believe that reduced transpiration rate is 
correlated with improved keeping quality of the flower. (The 
term "correlated 11 is meant only in the general sense and does 
not imply statistical analysis of results.) 

In the work in Part II a more Intensive and better con¬ 
trolled set of experiments was undertaken to discover If the 
physiological processes of transpiration and respiration were 
related to the keeping qualities of cut flowers. In this case 
roses, variety Pink Briarcliff. In the following discussion the 
two processes will be dealt with separately. 

1. Transpiration 


Transpiration is the loss of water from the plant, or

in this case the flower, in the form of vapour. Wilting occurs 
when transpiration rate exceeds the absorption of water through 
the cut end of the flower stem. It is well to keep in mind the 
fact that the transpiration of a cut shoot does not necessarily 
bear any relation to the transpiration of the shoot when attached 
to the plant. There has not been any work, comparable to that 
of Kidd, West and Briggs (4), done on the effect of maturity on 
the transpiration of the whole plant or of its organs (in the 
available literature). However, most workers assume that fre3h 
flowers have a high transpiration rate and that this is an indica¬ 
tion that the flower is rapidly absorbing water. Ries (18) 
states, "Most flowers absorb a maximum amount of water in the 
fresh condition; this quality gradually falls off and drops 
fairly rapidly as the flowers die.” It would appear then*that 
a treatment which would keep the flowers fresh longer would 
cause them to transpire more water. Thus a search should be 
made for a chemical or chemicals which increase transpiration 
rate and these would be expected to Improve keeping quality. 

This is the theory of Laurie (6) who states that a beneficial 
chemical must Increase transpiration rate. Hitchcock and 
Zimmerman (3) found that although many of the chemicals they 
tested decreased transpiration rate the flowers which lasted 
best lost the greatest amounts of water daily. 

It is recognized that both low temperature and high 
percentage humidity improve the keeping qualities of flowers and 
since transpiration rate Is reduced under both these conditions 
it would be reasonable to suppose that a favorable chemical would 
not increase but decrease transpiration rate. The results in

Part I would point to decreased transpiration rete as being 
related to improved keeping quality in most cases. On the other 
hand, Neff (13) found that water loss was the same for fresh 
carnations, dry pack carnations and those stored with stems in 
water. Since these treatments gave very different results in 
regard to keeping time Neff suggests that this might preclude 
the idea that increased life of flowers at room temperature 
depended on higher transpiration rate or indeed was even related 
to transpiration rate. 

The data in Part I might indicate that the trend of 
transpiration rate in a flower is to show a low rate at the 
beginning of the experiment rising to a peak and falling off 
toward the end of the life of the flower as Ries (18) suggests. 
However, under controlled conditions in Part II this trend was 
not noticeable with roses, either in water which may be consider¬ 
ed under normal conditions as compared with those in solution, or 
in chemical solution. 

Is transpiration related to keeping quality? If trans¬ 
piration rate were related to keeping quality one would expect 
that the rates would vary as length of life varied. That Is, 
roses in water would show different rates from roses in chemical 
solution as the latter lasted longer. However, on the basis of 
the data obtained in these experiments it is concluded that 
transpiration rate is not related to keeping quality In Pink 
Briarcliff roses.

with keeping quality it was thought that respiration should be 
affected if keeping quality was improved. Respiration is a 
process which involves all the chemical reactions by which com¬ 
plex organic substances are broken down in the plant with the 
release of energy and its outward manifestations are the absorp¬ 
tion of oxygen and the release of carbon dioxide. As respiration 
is a characteristic of every living tissue it is reasonable to 
suppose that any treatment which affects the developmental cycle 
of an organ would also have an effect on respiration. Kidd, 

West and Briggs (4) have shown that the respiration rate, not 
only of the entire plant (in this case He1lanthus annus) but 
also of the individual organs decreases with increasing age. 

Except for a suggestion by Laurie (6) that a desirable 
chemical should be expected to reduce respiration rate this 
factor has not been considered in connection with this problem. 

In these experiments the roses in water showed a low respiration 
rate in the bud stage, an increasing rate up to the open flower 
which was held for a period, and then, a decreasing rate as the 
flowers gr w old. This behavior is what one would expect. 
However, the roses In Floralife solution, while starting off with 
a low respiration rate at the beginning of the experiment and 
showing a rising rate as the flower opens, do nothin most cases, 
show the decrease in rate at the end of the experiment found with 
the flowers in water. As the flowers in solution lasted longer 
than those in water the final measurements were taken while 
the flowers were still in good condition, while the final rates 
for the check flowers were recorded when the flowers were ready

to be discarded. The fact that the respiration rates stayed 
high longer for those flowers In chemical solution may indicate 
that the developmental cycle of the treated flowers was somewhat 
slowed down. However, dally respiration rates of the treated 
flowers were not consistently lower than those of the checks. 

With regard to the high respiration rates It might be that the 
treated flowers lasted longer because nutrients were available 
in the form of hydrolyzed sugars as the Floralife contains 
sucrose. Thus the higher respiration rates may indicate that 
these flowers have more respiration substrate available than 
the flowers in water. This might explain why the treated flow¬ 
ers lasted better. It must be remembered that the flower attached 
to the plant has at all times a steady supply of nutrients while 
a cut flower must depend on what it has stored in its stem, leaf 
and petal cells which may not be sufficient as this emergency 
would naturally not be provided for in nature. 

However, on the basis of these experiments it is con¬ 
cluded that it is not advisable at this point to make a definite 
statement as to whether respiration is related to keeping quality 
in roses. It would be necessary to obtain more extensive data 
before a conclusion could be safely drawn. 

During the course of these experiments it was observed 
that several characters of the roses were visibly affected by 
Floralife. These were petal color, petal turgidity and flower 
odor. It was noticeable that flowers in solution consistently 
retained their fresh petal color much longer than those in 
water. In this regard Neff (15) suggests that the alum 
(KgSO^.A1(S0 4 ) 3 .24 HgO) in the Floralife acts as a mordant and

fixes the anthocyanin pigments in the petals which give the 
flowers color. It has been shown that anthocyanin pigments 
mordanted with salts of heavy metals tend to give dyes fast to 
light. It may be that it also brings about this charge in the 
cells of the flower petals. Concerning petal turgidity Neff 
also suggests that alum is the active agent affecting the petal 
cells in sane physiological way. The facts are not known but 
it is known that aluminium ions in combination with anions of 
higher valence than one tend to increase the permeability of 
the cytoplasm in certain cases. It was seen that the first indi¬ 
cation of loss of freshness in these roses was loss of flower 
odor which was generally replaced by a stale smell. What mech¬ 
anism controls this character is not known. 

With regard to future work on this problem the writer 
believes two things arc essential: first, a constant temperature 
room in which to keep the flowers, and second, the facilities 
to grow the flowers in sufficient quantities. Before the keep¬ 
ing qualities of cut flowers can be Improved each species of 
flower must be studied physiologically under both normal and 
abnormal conditions.

SUMMARY 

1. The object of these exper! discover if 

certain physiological factors or processes are related to the 
keeping qualities of cut flowers and to determine what this 
relationship might be. 

2. On the basis of preliminary experiments with a 
number of chemicals and species of flowers it was decided to 
study the effect of the commercial chemical mixture Floralife 
on roses. The variety used was Pink Briarcliff. 

3. The experiments reported in this thesis show that 
Floralife is beneficial to this variety of rose and prolongs the 
life of the flower two days on the average. However, the concen¬ 
tration used was 37 grams per quart of water--about three times 
the concentration generally recommended. 

4. On the basis of these experiments it is concluded 
that transpiration rate is not related to keeping quality in 
Pink Briarcliff roses. 

5. No definite conclusion is drawn as to whether 
respiration rate is related to keeping quality. It appears from 
this work that the respiration rates of the flowers in Floralife 
were higher than those in water. 

6. Observations made during the course of the experi¬ 
ments would lead one to think that the characters of petal color 
and petal turgidity are important and chemicals should be sought 
that would aid in maintaining these characters in a desirable
