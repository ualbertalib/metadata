ABSTRACT OF THESIS 

The purpose of the thesis was to describe and analyse 
all the forms of adult education that were carried on in a 
Central Alberta community from October to March, inclusive, 
1957-1958* Both the structure and functioning of community 
organizations and the mass media of communication disclosed 
a portrait of the amount and type of adult education being 
pursued. 

Interviews were used to gather information on communi¬ 
ty organizations, but in cases where interviews were not ob¬ 
tained, the interview guide sheet served as a questionnaire. 
Observation was carried out to a limited extent. Sampling 
was employed in the case of audiences of mass media of com¬ 
munication. Information on magazine sales came from local 
newsstands and a local subscription agency. Newspaper sales 
were obtained through correspondence with nearby major news¬ 
paper companies and the local newspaper office. 

A considerable amount of adult education (though it 
may not have been called by that name) was carried on in the 
community during the period of the survey. Organizations 
involved in it used the devices of educational discussions 
and study periods, books and newspaper articles, films and 
slides, speakers and informal talks, tours, demonstrations 
and workshops, lectures and instruction, and formal courses.

Further opportunity for adult education was also evident in 
the field of radio and television and, since television was 
used to a much greater extent than radio, it appeared to have 
more value as a social, entertainment, and adult education 
medium. The newspaper seemed to provide more adult education 
than the magazine. Thus a constant 11 bombardment ** of adult 
education gave town adult residents the opportunity to in¬ 
crease their education and to improve themselves on a civic, 
job, and personal level.

CHAPTER I 


THE PROBLEM AND PROCEDURE OF THE SURVEY 

Man never ceases in his quest for knowledge. Though 
the years of formal schooling have passed for most adults, a 
variety of means are being used to continue, in a less formal 
way, the never-ending search for knowledge. Each year, at 
the community level, much adult education is going on though 
it may not be called by that name. Isolated attempts are 
made at presenting formal adult education programmes but, 
less formally, community members are constantly engaged in 
this pursuit of knowledge. In no previous study has a survey 
been made of all forms of adult education in an Alberta rural 
community. 

I. THE PROBLEM 

Statement of the problem . It is the purpose of this 
survey to describe and analyse all the forms of adult educa¬ 
tion that were carried on in a Central Alberta community from 
October to March, inclusive, 1957-195B. The analysis of the 
community’s culture is made in such a way that the structure 
and functioning of community organizations and the mass media 
of communication disclose a picture of the amount and type of 
adult education being pursued.

Delimitation of the problem . The survey is limited 
to the boundaries of the town of Olds except for the inclu¬ 


2 


sion of the Provincial School of Agriculture which is an 
integral part of the town and is located just east of highway 
2A, the eastern boundary of the town. Olds is a thriving 
agricultural community located fifty-five miles north of 
Calgary, Alberta, and contains a population of 2,168 people. 
The six-month period of the survey lasted from October to 
March, inclusive, 1957-1956. Though there is a close unity 
between the town and rural area, as in all agricultural com¬ 
munities, the scope of the survey is limited to the boundary 
of the town since the magnitude of the survey and the time 
involved necessarily imposed restrictions. The effect of 
rural life on the town is not entirely omitted (nor can it 
ever be discounted) and the result is that certain phases of 
rural life creep into the survey. No town that depends for 
its existence on the surrounding area can omit that area 
without losing a vital part of its own nature. All town 
organizations are included in the survey but rural partici¬ 
pation in town organizations is mentioned briefly. However, 
the section on mass media of communication (Chapter IV), in 
terms of estimation, excludes rural participation. This 
exclusion points out a serious but necessary limitation in 
the survey. A further limitation is imposed through the 
deficiency in sociological training of the writer, a defi-

ciency which may have been made up in part by training in the 
field of education* 

Significance of the survey . It is hoped that this 
study will contribute to the knowledge of Alberta community 
life as well as provide a background for intelligently intro¬ 
ducing adult education programmes in Alberta rural communi¬ 
ties, The main importance of the study lies in the presenta¬ 
tion of a picture of adult education at the community level; 
should it stimulate thinking or self-evaluation along lines 
of furthering that adult education, then it has been correct¬ 
ly undertaken with a view toward action. 

Definition of terms , 

1, Adult education—Adult education is considered as any 
activity, apart from the ordinary job, which is engaged in 
by adult members of a community in order that they may 
progress in personal, civic or job improvement. It is 
considered synonymous with "continuing education", and may 
be taken as all forms of behaviour by people no longer in 
school to find adjustments to their life problems. Adult 
education, as stated here, has a broad rather than restricted 
meaning, John A, Neitz lists a number of distinguishing 
characteristics which are shown in the definitions of other 

^ohn A, Neitz, "Expand Adult Education," American 
School Board Journal , Vol. 114 (March, 1947), 23,

writers. For example, he limits adult education to those 

whose full-time schooling has ended at least for the time 

being and to those who approach it from a voluntary point 

of view on a part-time basis in leisure activity* One writer 

restricts the membership to those who are above compulsory 

school age and not full-time students in a school or college; 

furthermore, he narrows the meaning of the term by limiting 

its definition to deliberate programmes carried on by groups 

or agencies, without including individual self-improvement 

2 

in such a picture. Adult education activities described in 
the present survey have a broad rather than restricted mean¬ 
ing and are included in the study on the basis of their 
contribution to personal, civic, or job improvement* 

2* Organization—An organization is considered as a frame¬ 
work within which community members attempt to further 
specific interests or aims* Organizations are divided into 
two general types? formal and informal. Formal organizations 
have such common features as a constitution, regular business 
meetings and, in the main, are part of a larger outside 
organization. Conversely, informal organizations have no 
constitution, meet without the formality of parliamentary 
procedure, and are formed for a specific purpose (for special

interests)* Furthermore, they have no connection or 
affiliation whatsoever with outside organizations. 

II. THE PROCEDURE 

Sources of data . Information for Chapter II and 
Chapter III was obtained from executive members of local 
organizations as well as from the writer*s own knowledge 
through familiarity with a few organizations. Data for 
Chapter IV were obtained from local newsstand operators, a 
local magazine subscription agency and newspaper office, 
nearby major newspaper companies, and local film sources. 

Materials and methods . A field guide sheet was used 
to record information gathered mainly through interviews with 
executive members of community organizations (see Appendix A). 
In cases where interviews were impossible, this field guide 
sheet served as a questionnaire. Furthermore, observation 
(while participating) was used to a limited extent to gather 
the information for Chapter II and Chapter III. Sampling 
was carried out in the case of audiences of mass media of 
communication (see Appendix B for sample form used) and 
simple questionnaire forms were distributed to local news¬ 
stand operators, local film agencies and a local subscription 
agency. Correspondence was conducted with out-of-town news¬ 
paper companies.

CHAPTER II 


STRUCTURE OF ORGANIZATIONS CARRYING ON ADULT EDUCATION 

A variety of community organizations, both formal 
and informal, are carrying out forms of adult education in 
their regular activities and programmes. An examination of 
organization structures revealing general features, member¬ 
ship and affiliation will be given here. This information 
was gathered mainly by interviews which were recorded 
(during the interview) on a field guide sheet which also 
served as a questionnaire in cases where interviews were not 
obtained. A study of the structure (and functioning) of 
organizations is a major part of the thesis since organiza¬ 
tional work is a large part of the community's life and since 
adult education is carried on within these organizations. 

I. GENERAL FEATURES OF ORGANIZATIONS 
INVOLVED IN THE SURVEY 

Rural organizations showing one hundred per cent 
rural membership were excluded from the list of organizations. 
All organizations included had to have a majority of adult 
membership. A scanning of many winter issues of the local 
newspaper along with the advice of long-time residents of 
the community aided in drawing up the final organization list 
which was intended to be a full coverage of the community.

Fifty-six organizations were surveyed by interviews 
to obtain a picture of their structures* Of the fifty-six, 
five exhibited features common to informal groups; of these, 
four were local church choirs and the fifth a local painting 
group* Three Women*s Institute organizations, predominantly 
rural in membership but carrying on very similar programmes, 
were written up as one composite group and became part of 
the survey because they had town members at whose homes 
meetings were held. Six organizations were classified as 
executive groups since they were not responsible to a larger 
membership group. There were four organizations which 
started operation during the period covered by the survey 
(October, 1957 to March, 1958 inclusive) while two other 
organizations ceased to exist and are not reported here. 

According to their chief purpose and function, town 
organizations are divided into six major institutional fields. 
Another ,, institutional ,, field composed of autonomous (or 
special interest) organizations is added and, for the con¬ 
venience of grouping, is referred to in this thesis as a 
seventh institutional field. A key to the classification of 
organizations into the seven institutional fields is given 
in Appendix C. 

On the basis of their main purpose and function, 
therefore, the fifty-six organizations finally included are 
classified under the seven major institutional fields. Ten

three in the political, twenty-four under religious insti¬ 
tutions, three in the educational classification, seven in 
the recreational group, three in the health and welfare class 
and, finally, six in the autonomous group. The following is

II, MEMBERSHIP IN ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED IN THE SURVEY 

Number and sex of members Involved in community 
organizations , An institutional classification of town 
organizations showing membership by number and sex in each 
group is given in Table I, Part I reveals that there are 
far more religious organizations in town than any other type 
of organizations (24 out of 56 organizations) but Part II 
shows that the economic group has more members. Furthermore, 
the average size of membership in economic organizations 
appears large while that in religious organizations is 
comparatively small. Twenty-one organizations have strictly 
female membership while 11 have only male membership and, 
since the total number of organizations is 56, the remaining 
2b have mixed membership (male and female). 

Part II of Table I shows that out of a total of 2,388 
members (some of whom are rural residents but who belong to 
town organizations) involved in organizational activity, the 
males outnumber the females by 432 with the count being 1,410 
males to 978 females. Of course, there is considerable over¬ 
lapping of membership since most people belong to more than 
one organization. The figure of 2,388 members does not, 
therefore, represent an actual count of individuals involved 
in organizational life in the community. The actual count 
would be much smaller than the 2,388 indicated. For matters 
of comparison, the town census taken by the local I.O.D.E.

organization indicated an adult population of 1,348 as of 
March 31, 1958 (excludes the one hundred in attendance at 
the Provincial School of Agriculture). 

Part II also reveals that the economic group has the 
largest membership of the seven groups (876 out of 2,388), 
while male participation in this group (724) exceeds all 
male memberships in the other six groups. The recreational 
group is the only other one of the seven in which male mem¬ 
bership is larger than that of female (277 male to 52 female). 
While more males are involved in economic organizations 
(such as service clubs, chambers of commerce, and vocational 
groups) as well as recreational organizations, female 
participation is larger in all other institutional groups 
(political, educational, health and welfare, and autonomous). 
Female membership is largest in religious organizations and 
is almost double that of male membership in that group (401 
females as compared with 227 males). The huge male enroll¬ 
ment (724) in the economic group, over half of the total 
male membership in all groups combined, accounts for the 
main difference between the large male and smaller female 
membership in all organizations. Total membership in the 
political group is the least of all the institutional groups. 

Average attendance at meetings . The effectiveness and 
interest in an organization is reflected in the attendance 
shown at regular meetings. Table II gives a picture of

average attendance at meetings as reported by interviewees. 
Those organizations whose chief purpose is educational (Home 
and School, Women’s Institute and Alberta Association of 
Registered Nurses) rank highest in average attendance at 
regular meetings (76.9 per cent). It is significant to note 
that educational organizations, whose main purpose is to 
educate its members, have the best attendance. On the other 
hand, economic organizations have barely a quarter (26.7 P©r 
cent) of their regular members out to their meetings. 

Perusal of Table I on page 12 shows that economic organiza¬ 
tions have the largest membership of all groups yet they fall 
down considerably in attendance at meetings. It appears that 
a major portion of the work in the economic group is done by 
a few of its members who are either the type which is intense¬ 
ly interested or which can be found in executive or committee 
positions in many organizations. It was observed that active 
members in many organizations were found in similar roles in 
more than one organization* 

Age of members and extent of rural participation . 

Exact ages of participating members in each institutional 
group were not obtained but interviewees gave what they 
thought to be the average age of the members in each of the 
organizations. The estimates, compiled as an average in 
each group, are given in the following lists

Community organizations that have an older average age in 
their memberships are involved in political and patriotic, 
and health and welfare endeavours. The political group 
shows the oldest average age (45.7 years) but closely behind 
it is the health and welfare group (4? years). On the other 
hand, it is not surprising to note that recreational organi¬ 
zations on the average contain the youngest age group (37*9 
years). Furthermore, the age of members participating in 
educational organizations is comparatively young (38.3 years). 

No town community is a unit unto itself, for rural 
areas surrounding the centre play a vital part in the life 
of the town. Therefore, rural participation in town organi¬ 
zations bears examination. Table III gives attention to an 
estimated rural participation in town organizations according 
to the seven institutional fields. Estimates for each 
organization were obtained from interviewees. Five main 
divisions are considered in Part I of the table, each 
showing the number of participating members: first, strictly 
town participation; secondly, 0 to 25 per cent rural partici¬ 
pation; thirdly, 26 to 50 per cent rural; next, 51 to 75 per

cent rural 5 lastly, over 75 per cent rural participation. 
The writer has prepared Part II of the table to give an 
estimate of rural participation by taking a mid-point 
average to be the rural membership in divisions showing 
rural participation (for example, in the division showing 
0 to 25 per cent rural participation, 12£ per cent of the 
membership is counted as rural; in the division showing 
26 to 50 per cent rural participation, 37£- per cent of its 
membership is counted as rural, and so on)* Adding these 
averages together gives an estimated rural participation 
and percentage of rural membership in each institutional 
field* 

With the exception of ten organizations which had 
strictly town membership, all other organizations had some 
degree of rural membership* Certainly the town is not an 
independent unit in itself since close to one-half of all 
the organizations (twenty-seven out of fifty-six) had up to 
25 per cent rural participation* Part I of Table III 
indicates that membership in strictly town organizations is 
a meagre 177 out of a total of 2,388 organization members* 
Although the exact number of rural members is not known, by 
taking the average in each division showing rural partici¬ 
pation the resulting percentage is significantly high (36*7 
per cent)* Rural membership in the economic group averages 
over one-half of its total membership (51*2 per cent), and

this to some extent may account for the extremely low average 
attendance at meetings of this group (refer back to Table II), 
On the other hand, three groups (political, health and welfare 
and autonomous) register low rural participation. Organiza¬ 
tions which have education as their main purpose contain a 
high percentage of rural membership (an average of 4l,3 per 
cent). However, a survey of distances travelled by furthest 
rural members to attend town meetings showed that the educa¬ 
tional group came from an average furthest distance of 7<*3 

* 

miles, the shortest average distance of all groups. The 
economic group travelled the furthest average distance (12,7 
miles), a fact again which may help to account for their low 
average attendance at regular meetings. 

Methods of leader and member recruitment . Little vari¬ 
ety was shown in methods of leader recruitment. Forty-seven 
of the fifty-six organizations employed election to obtain 
their leaders. Three organizations used appointment, one 
favored general consent of the members (i.e,, gravitation of 
members to leadership positions) to obtain leaders, while 
five depended entirely on interest to secure theirs. Sixteen 
organizations employed more than one method to obtain their 
leaders, the most popular secondary method being appointment 
(especially in connection with committees). Methods of mem¬ 
bership recruitment were reported as followss 

♦Averages are composed of distances reported of the 
furthest rural members and not the average distances travelled 
by all rural members*

General description of groups and membership 
restrictions . Members of an organization exhibit collective¬ 
ly certain common features which set them distinctly apart 
from members of other organizations. However, one cannot 
assume that each member of an organization has all the common 
features shown by the group. An arrangement of common 
features, as reported by interviewees, is given in Table IV 
in order from most to least prevalent. Of course, many 
organizations reported more than one common feature for their 
memberships, but the common feature shown by most is that of 
sex (i.e., 32 reported similar sex as a common feature of 
their group)* Ranking second and third as common features 
are religion (24) and age (18). The combined total of the 
above three common features accounts for approximately one- 
half of all the common features reported (7*+ out of 150)* 

Only 12 of the organizations reported memberships as being 
a good cross-section of the public. This suggests that some 
social groups are absent in community organizations. 

Business, profession and vocation as common features combined 
together show that occupations account to some extent for 
participation in 20 of the 56 community organizations.,

22 


As organizations set up their narrow boundaries for 
membership, a number of highly restrictive common features 
(such as specific interest, relationship, income, nationality, 
armed services connection, political affiliation, social 
grouping, and ability) tend to limit participation to a 
great extent. A total of thirty-3even out of the fifty-six 
organizations reported membership restrictions of one type or 
another. 

Furthermore, certain groups in the town are practical¬ 
ly omitted from organizational life. Observation and 
community comment uncovered a so-called "transient group" 

(a group which moves regularly through change in job location) 
which is practically omitted from organizational life. Some 
members of another group called "newcomers to town” find 
difficulty in breaking into organizational life as they are 
not often approached by community members. However, the more 
forward newcomers have little difficulty in becoming a part 
of community life. Young people just out of school were an¬ 
other neglected group since most organizations had little 
appeal for them. A "Custom Car Club", designed for young 
men who were interested in auto motor and body work, soon 
disbanded after a two-month venture (October to December, 

1957 ) thus putting an end to one type of organization which 
fitted a just-out-of-school group. Those in the lower income 
and social group lacked their share of representation, too, 
in the organizational life of the community*

III* affiliation of organizations involved in the survey 

An examination of organization affiliation was carried 
out to show the type and amount of connection that the com¬ 
munity had with the outside world. Many organizations were 
part of a provincial, national or international scheme while 
there were, of course, some organizations which were peculiar 
only to the town of Olds and which had no outside ties what¬ 
soever (these are called "single organizations 11 ). These 
local organizations are completely independent from outside 
influence and have originated to fill some particular needs 
of the local residents* On the other hand, organizations 
which show affiliation depend on the outside world not only 
for their origin but for their continuance as well. Since 
these organizations are affiliated, their programmes are 
imposed or directed in varying degrees according to the 
constitutions of the outside parent organizations. 

Table V indicates that of the 56 organizations covered 
in the survey, over two-thirds (4l) had outside affiliation 
while the remaining 15 were peculiar only to the town of 
Olds. There were 18 organizations with local affiliation 
(i.e., affiliation with other town organizations), 3b with 
provincial, 30 with national, and 13 with international 
affiliation. Of the seven institutional groups, three 
(economic, political, and educational) had no organizations 
peculiar only to the town of Olds. The autonomous group

had the greatest proportion of strictly local organizations 
(two-thirds), while the religious and health and welfare 
groups each indicated that one-third of their organizations 
were local in nature. The remaining institutional group 
(recreational) showed that less than one-third of its 
organizations were strictly local. 

Summary and conclusions . There were far more religious 
organizations in the town than any other type of organization 
(24 out of 56 organizations) hut the economic group had more 
members than any other group. Total male membership in 
organizations was larger than total female membership (1,410 
compared with 978)* Religious organizations registered the 
largest female membership (401) and economic organizations 
the largest male membership (724)* Average attendance for 
all organizations was quite small (45*5 per cent). The 
economic group revealed an average attendance of only 26.7 
per cent while the educational group registered the highest 
with an average attendance of 76.9 per cent. The oldest 
average age of organization members was shown in the political 
and health and welfare groups (45.7 years and 45 years res¬ 
pectively) while the youngest average age was found in the 
recreational and educational groups (37.9 years and 38.3 
years respectively). 

The town was not an independent unit unto itself since 
46 of the 56 organizations had some degree of rural partici-

pation. Both economic and educational groups registered a 
high percentage of rural participation in their organizations* 
While rural participants travelled an average of 12*7 miles 
to attend economic organization meetings in town, they cam® 
only an average of 7*3 miles to attend educational organiza¬ 
tion meetings in town. Further dependence of the town on 
the outside world was shown in the high degree of affiliation 
with outside groups 5 4l out of 56 organizations had outside 
affiliation* 

Little variety was shown in methods of leader recruit¬ 
ment (47 of the 56 organizations employed election). Member 
recruitment was obtained mainly through advertising. Sex, 
religion and age accounted for approximately one-half of all 
the common features reported of memberships. These as well 
as other highly restrictive common features tended to limit 
participation in organizations. Certain groups in the town 
appeared to be practically omitted from organizational life. 

The findings in Chapter II suggest the following 
conclusions 1 

1. A few active members are carrying a massive share of 
organizational work in the community. With the average 
attendance for all organizations at a figure below one-half 
the possible attendance (45*5 per cent), general effective¬ 
ness and interest in organizations is questionable. Take 
away the few active members who participate in more than one 
organization and the average picture of organizational atten-

dance would indeed be small• 

2. The comparatively young age (38*3 years) of members in 
the educational group suggests that it is the younger middle- 
aged group members who make a conscious effort to improve 
their education by taking part in organizations that have 
education as their chief purpose. Formal adult education 
programmes would likely have their greatest success for this 
age group. Education is essentially a by-product in the 
other institutional fields while it is a conscious objective 
in the field presently being discussed. 

3. The high percentage of rural membership in town 
educational organizations suggests that town adult education 
programmes apparently could count on rural support and 
interest in their functioning. However, it is further 
suggested that the rural group involved would not be too 
distant from town. 

4. With respect to adult education, four groups appear to 
be neglected in the community ("transient group", "newcomers 
to town", "just-out-of-school youth", and "lower income and 
social group")and, remaining on the outer fringe of community 
activities, they are more apt to present a real problem for 
the town. 

5. With such a large number of town organizations exhibit¬ 
ing outside affiliation, the connection of the town with the 
outside world appears very close.

CHAPTER III 


FUNCTIONING OF ORGANIZATIONS CARRYING ON ADULT EDUCATION 

In addition to a picture of the structure of community 
organizations, a study of their functioning provides a more 
comprehensive view of the organizational life in the com¬ 
munity. The actual aims, functions, activities, programmes 
and interaction of town organizations (from October 1 to 
March 31, 1957-1958) are given here (Consult Appendix D 
for illustrative case studies showing the actual aims, 
functions and activities of a typical organization in each 
institutional field)* Special emphasis is placed on adult 
education activities • A complete description of them was 
compiled to illustrate the type and amount of adult education 
carried on during a given period of time in organizations of 
one of Central Alberta*s communities. The information for 
the above was gathered at the same time and in the same 
manner as that reported for Chapter II (see page 7)* 

However, only fifty-two organizations are reported in 
Chapter III since the four church choirs (mentioned earlier) 
did not fit into the general pattern of organizational life 
being examined here. 

Besides the functioning of organizations, a review is 
made of community adult education needs and future plans 
(according to interviewees)* All are examined in the

I. MAJOR AIMS OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS 

An organization comes into existence to fill some 
particular need of community residents. By grouping together, 
people wish to attain some goal which could otherwise not 
be reached. As stated in the constitutions of most organi¬ 
zations, aims or goals are mostly of an idealistic nature 
but, of course, some have a practical outlook. Since many 
of the aims are idealistic, they may not be fulfilled to the 
extent outlined. In practice, it is the immediate practical 
aims which take precedence over all others and which are 
fulfilled within as short a time as possible. 

The aims, functions and activities surveyed in the 
fifty-two organizations were numerous and varied but were 
classified in the next three tables ( VI, VII, and VIII) 
under seven general categories; 

1. To improve the individual (aims, functions, and 
activities of an educational or cultural nature)

2* To protect the individual or group (aims, functions, 
and activities of a protective or welfare nature) 

3. To provide a social medium (aims, functions, and 

activities of a social, entertainment or recreational 
nature) 

4-. To better facilities (aims, functions, and activities 
of a money-raising or facilities-improvement nature) 

5. To improve the town (aims, functions, and activities 
of a material or concrete nature which contribute 
directly to the betterment of the town rather than 
the group) 

6 . To improve society (aims, functions, and activities 

of an idealistic nature designed to improve the lot of 
mankind) 

7. To protect society (aims, functions, and activities 
of a concrete nature designed for the protection of 
the country in event of attack or disaster). 

The last two mentioned appear to be of an idealistic nature 

since they are not of immediate practical value to the town. 

In many cases interviewees stated more than one aim for 

their organizations and all of these are included in Table VI 

to produce a complete picture of the major aims of the seven 

institutional fields in the community. The figures given in 

the table do not represent the total number of organizations 

(fifty-two) but merely the number of times that the aim was 

stated by all organizations involved and thus the number of 

comments is greater than fifty-two (there were seventy-six 

comments in all). 

A good dispersal of institutional groups is shown 
among the major aims. Eight of the nine organizations in 
the educational and autonomous groups indicated 11 improvement

of the individual" as their major aim (educational, 3 organi¬ 
zations! autonomous, 5). The economic group showed "protec¬ 
tion of the individual or group" (Category 2) as its main 
aim (7 out of ten organizations); the religious group, 
"betterment of facilities" (13 of the twenty organizations); 
educational organizations split evenly between the main aims 
of "improvement of the individual" (Category 1) and "improve¬ 
ment of society" (Category 6; 3 organizations); the recrea¬ 
tional group favored the major aims of "providing a social 
medium" (3 organizations) and "improving the town" (4 organi¬ 
zations); health and welfare organizations showed "improve¬ 
ment of the town" (2) and "protection of society" (1 instance) 
as their major aims; and, finally, the autonomous group was 
almost unanimous (5 out of six organizations) in its choice 
of "improvement of the individual" as its major aim. 

The most-favored aim is shown by 17 organizations 
listed under Category 1, "to improve the individual"; this 
would indicate that a substantial amount of adult education 
could be a part of the programmes of these groups (economic, 

3 organizations; religious, 5; educational, 3; recreational, 

1 ; and autonomous, 5 making a total of 17 organizations). 

The second most-favored aim is that of "betterment of facili¬ 
ties" (14 instances) followed closely behind, in order of 
favor, by "protection of the individual or group" (10 organi¬ 
zations), "improvement of the town" (10), "improvement of 
society" (10), "provision of a social medium" (9), and

lastly, "protection of society" (6). Whatever the stated 
aims of the organizations might show, they are not so re¬ 
liable as the picture of organizational activities which 
will be revealed later. Since stated aims may not be pur¬ 
sued to the extent desired, it is the actual activities 
which will reveal the true picture of organizational out¬ 
come. 


II. CHIEF FUNCTIONS OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS 

If the aims of an organization point out what the 
members wish to accomplish, then its functions are the broad 
means by which those aims are accomplished. A further step 
in reasoning shows that activities are the specific means 
of accomplishing aims. We have already seen that the 
classification of organizations into institutional groups 
was made on the basis of their chief purpose or function. 
However, organizations usually have more than one function. 
Thus all functions stated by the interviewees will be taken 
into account in the discussion, even if there were a dupli¬ 
cation within the same organization (for example, an inter¬ 
viewee may have stated two or more functions which were in 
the same category). Furthermore, no degree of importance is 
attached to any function; both major and minor functions are 
included on an equal basis. The total number of functions 
in Table VII, therefore, exceeds the total number of aims 
shown by the organizations in Table VI, and for matters of

comparison of the two tables, some thought will have to be 
given to ratio of figures. 

The seven categories employed in Table VI to show 
aims are used to classify the functions shown in Table VII. 
Each institutional group has a predominance of functions in 
one of the seven categories. The economic group shows a 
predominance of functions (16 instances) under the second 
category "to protect the individual or group"; the political 
group is divided evenly between Category 1 and Category 7 
(4 instances for each); 22 instances are reported for the 
religious group under Category 35 Categories 1 and 2 make 
up the main functions of the educational group (b instances 
as compared with 3); a predominance of functions for the 
recreational group fall under Category 3 (9 instances); 
in the health and welfare group, a majority of functions 
appear under the second category (4 instances) and, finally, 
the autonomous group is quite evenly split between the two 
main functions shown in Categories 1 and 3 (7 instances as 
compared with 6). 

Reading down each category in the table, we note a 
predominance of functions for all institutional groups in 
Category 3, "to provide a social medium" (48 instances). 
However, ranking close behind are the functions classified 
under the second category (47 instances). Both categories 
show major shifts in emphasis (from aims in Table VI to 
functions in Table VII). The shift in emphasis toward

"provision of a social medium" points out the highly social 
quality of organizational life* Members of one organization 
often find that their membership is quite similar to that 
of other organizations because people tend to stay within 
their "circle of acquaintance" for social reasons; therefore, 
from aims to functions, the emphasis has been shifted away 
from "improvement of the individual" toward that of "provid¬ 
ing a social medium". The shift in emphasis in Category 2 
of the tables points out emphatically an important reason 
why people form organizations: for the welfare or protection 
of the individual or group. Both goals may not be stated 
in the list of aims of an organization, but they become very 
apparent in the functions which are carried out. 

While Table VI showed "improvement of the individual" 
to be the major aim of most organizations, Table VII 
indicates that this category ranks only third in importance 
as far as functions are concerned. A later examination of 
organizational activities in Table VIII will clarify this 
apparent discrepancy between the actual aims and stated 
functions of the organizations. 

While the fourth category, "to better facilities", 
does not show a marked change in emphasis from Table VI to 
Table VII, in both cases it appears lower than in actual 
practice of local organizations. Many interviewees simply 
did not state the aim or function of raising money for the 
betterment of facilities or for charity purposes. Judging 
from the amount of time and effort spent by local organize-

tions in raising money, one would assume that Category 5 
would contain more instances of this nature. 

The chief functions in five of the seven institutional 
groups do not bear out their major aims. In six groups, either 
changes or additions in aims are noted in comparing Table VI 
with Table VII, These discrepancies indicate a vast differ¬ 
ence between the aims and actual functions of many organiza¬ 
tions. Realistically, many of the functions are not directed 
toward chief aims or goals. Taking the six institutional 
groups in order of appearance in the tables, we note the 
following changes or additions in emphasis: 

1. Political group: ADDED the aim of "improvement of the 
individual* 1 to **the protection of society 11 

2. Religious group: CHANGED from **bettering of facilities** 
to "providing a social medium" 

3. Educational group: CHANGED from "improving society" to 
"protecting the individual or group" (note that the welfare 
nature of educational functions has accounted for much of 
this shift in emphasis. This is different from the type of 
protection found in the economic group) 

4. Recreational group: CHANGED from "improving the town** 
to "bettering of facilities" 

5* Health and Welfare group: CHANGED from "improving the 
town" to "protection of the individual or group" (again, 
as with the educational group, welfare endeavours make its 
type of protection of the individual or group different from

that visualized in the economic group where members are 
banded together for protection) 

6. Autonomous group 5 ADDED "provision of a social medium" 
to "improvement of the individual". 

Neither organizational aims nor general functions give 
a complete view of the outcome of organizational life. To 
complete the picture, it is imperative to examine the 
programmes and activities carried out by the fifty-two 
organizations. 

III.. PROGRAMMES AND ACTIVITIES OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS 
WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ADULT EDUCATION ASPECTS 

The activities of an organization are the specific 
means by which it accomplishes its aims. Whatever aims or 
functions may have been stated by organizational representa¬ 
tives, the actual picture of organizational achievement comes 
only from a study of activities. Table VIII gives a compila¬ 
tion of these activities carried on by the fifty-two organi¬ 
zations from October 1 to March 31, 1957-1958. These 
activities illustrate more exactly what was done despite the 
stated aims or functions. The instances shown in Table VIII 
each represent one organizational activity as stated by the 
interviewees. Each institutional group shows a predominance 
of activities within one or another of the seven categories. 

Category 3, "to provide a social medium", includes 
two of the institutional groups (economic, 25 out of 70

activities listed; recreational, 12 out of 31 activities 
listed). Most significantly, however, the remaining five 
groups fall into Category 1, 11 improvement of the individual' 1 
(political, 13 out of 29 instances; religious, 47 out of 
134; educational, 15 out of 25 ; health and welfare, 8 out 
of 12; and, finally, autonomous, 16 out of a total of 21 
activities listed). 

With five of the seven institutional groups confining 
a predominance of their activities within the first category, 
the major outcome of organizational life is apparently 
revealed. That result is personal improvement which comes 
through activities designed to be of an educational value 
to the individual. Of all activities carried on by the 
fifty-two organizations, those favoring personal improvement 
(115 out of 322 activities) outrank any of the other types 
of activities. Cultural activities, however, were also 
included in Category 1 but, since only five instances of 
them were reported of all the groups, these activities are 
practically eliminated from showing any influence in the 
category. 

An apparent discrepancy in Category 1 appeared between 
the actual aims and stated functions in Table VI and Table 
VII. In Table VI the major aim of organizations was "to 
improve the individual" while in Table VII, the major function 
of organizations proved to be "to provide a social medium". 
Once again, in Table VIII we see a predominance of activities

in the category "to improve the individual*'. Why is there 
a discrepancy in the stated functions? The most plausible 
answer appears to be that interviewees simply neglected to 
state that education was one of their chief functions. This 
is understandable in terms of the definition of adult 
education in Chapter I. Adult education is a constant 
process and an unnoticed one. Furthermore, people generally 
have an aversion to calling anything "education" since, in 
most minds, it means the type of formal education they had 
when they were youngsters. Whatever other reasons may exist 
for excluding education in the stated functions, the fact 
remains that it is going on continuously and unnoticed under 
the assumed name of personal improvement. 

Two other important outcomes from organizational 
activity are also shown in the activities listed in Table VIII. 
The second largest number of activities fall into Category 3 , 
"to provide a social medium" (92 out of 322 instances). This 
second most important outcome points out that people wish to 
have recreation, entertainment or some social life within 
the organization they join. The outcome of personal or 
group welfare and protection ranks third in importance in 
the table of activities and is shown in Category 2 (57 in¬ 
stances)^ 

Personal interest or benefit is practically absent in 
categories 5* 6 and 7. Not a single activity could be 
classified under the sixth and seventh categories but this

did not mean that they were completely neglected in the 
activities of the fifty-two organizations. They are more 
of a by-product of organizational activity and, since they 
are highly idealistic in nature, no specific activity could 
be classified as belonging to these three categories. While 
organizations did not carry out many activities of a town- 
improvement nature (only 20 instances), the town benefited 
and improved indirectly from the fact that organizations 
were active within its boundaries. A number of activities 
listed under other categories undoubtedly benefited and 
improved the town indirectly even though they may not have 
been of a concrete or material nature. 

The exact extent of adult education activities is 
surprisingly large. These activities are taken from Category 
1 in Table VIII and reproduced for further study in Table IX. 
Out of 322 activities listed for the organizations, 114 or 
35*7 per cent of them were of an adult education nature. 
Certainly a major part of organizational work is composed 
of adult education activities. The autonomous group devoted 
the largest percentage of its activities (76.2 per cent) to 
those of an educational nature. The next two in order of size 
are the health and welfare group (66.7 per cent) and the 
educational group (60 per cent). Hanking lowest in percen¬ 
tage of educational activities are the economic group (17*1 
per cent) and the recreational group (12.9 per cent).

activities that were carried on during the survey period. 

They have been classified under the following headings; 

(1) educational discussions and study periods, (2) use of 
books and newspaper articles, (3) films and slides, 

(*f) speakers and informal talks, (5) tours, (6) demonstrations 
and workshops for the development of skills, (7) lectures and 
instruction, (8) courses, and (9) other adult education. 

Educational discussions and study periods . Discussions 
of an educational nature were carried on in thirteen of the 
fifty-two organizations and a variety of techniques were 
used. In addition to general discussion by all members, 
panels, debates, role-playing, skits and committee reports 
were used. Church organizations had discussions on missionary 
work around the world and at least two organizations dealt 
with the Alberta liquor plebiscite held in 1957. One of 
these discussions took the form of a debate. So-called 
’’training sessions’ 1 employing role-playing and skits were 
used by one of the religious organizations. In the economic 
group, one organization brought in a panel group which 
discussed the subject ’’Oil in Alberta” at an open public 
meeting, and another one conducted a panel within its own 
group on the subject of ’’Reading Ability”, as well as 
discussions on professional problems relating to teaching. 

A forum group conducted regular meetings connected with the

weekly presentation of "Citizens' Forum" in C.B.C. Broad¬ 
casts. One educational organization conducted a series of 
of committee meetings to discuss a family study project. 

Regular study periods were held in some of the organi¬ 
zations. Topics covered in these periods included a study 
of United Church missions in Japan, Presbyterian missions 
around the world and Bihle studies* One economic group 
had study periods on Civil Service Commission regulations. 

All in all, educational discussions and study periods were 
conscious efforts to improve the education of participating 
members. 

Use of books and newspaper articles . Ten organizations 
used books (usually the Bible) in their regular meetings. 

For example, five organizations had spiritual readings from 
the Bible and others had similar devotional readings from 
other religious books. One organization followed a programme 
outline from a book of devotions. A Presbyterian group 
carried out regular exchanges of religious books and pamph¬ 
lets among its members. Books on missions and missionaries 
were studied by another religious group. Members of another 
organization had to use books frequently for memorization 
of ritualistic material* 

Three organizations made use of newspapers either 
in their meetings or in presenting educational material to 
the public. One economic group had material on the obser-

vation of city-farm week printed in the local newspaper, 
while the local Civil Defence organization ran a series of 
articles dealing with safety during time of national disaster• 
Of course, an assortment of informal talks at regular meetings 
included material from books and newspapers. 

Films and slides. Twenty-three of the fifty-two 
organizations used films and slides to some extent, but 
religious organizations used them more than any other 
institutional group, A variety of subjects were presented, 
covering such fields as geography, missionary work, nursing, 
cancer, sports and conservation, and flying, to mention only 
a few. Groups made use of the local National Film Board 
Council and other sources. A survey of films shown in the 
town during the month of January, 1958, will be discussed 
later in Chapter IV. Furthermore, the extent of usage will 
be reported in a following section dealing with "Programme 
Types". It was difficult, however, to determine the extent 
to which films went beyond the purpose of entertainment. 

Speakers and informal talks . This form of programme 
was highly used by most organizations. Speakers were brought 
in from outside the organizations or members presented talks 
on subjects that were of interest to the group. No less 
than thirty-seven organizations used speakers of one type 
or the other. A variety of topics were covered by outside 
speakers; those listed were as follows; missionary work

(for example, among the Indians and Eskimos), Christian 
stewardship, drugs, medicine, recreation, religion, church 
financing, adult education, fluoridation, gardening, farm 
beautification, the salt industry in Saskatchewan, Alberta 
school curriculum, civil defence, and flying. Many topics 
were not given by the interviewees, but the above show some 
indication not only of the variety but of the magnitude of 
this form of programme. A considerable amount of adult 
education was accomplished through this medium. 

Members themselves presented a number of "papers" or 
informal talks covering such fields as India and Nehru, 
immigration and citizenship, Commonwealth relations, Ghana, 
the Bermuda Conference, the Queen 1 s visit to Canada, Sweden, 
liquor legislation in Alberta, missionary work, a family 
study report, and a paper on U.N.I.C.E.F. Presentation of 
educational information by speakers of one type or another 
was a much-used method. The adult search for knowledge was 
no doubt carried forward considerably by this medium. 

Tours . Only one instance of the use of educational 
tours was reported. The local Alberta Association of 
Registered Nurses arranged for a tour of the local hospital 
and X ray department. 

Demonstrations and workshops for the development of 
skills . Demonstrations refer here to activities in which 


a person or persons demonstrate or show how something is

done* On the other hand, workshops refer to the members 
doing activities themselves during the meeting. Sixteen 
organizations employed demonstrations of one type or another 
while fifteen used the workshop method. Members of one 
economic organization, the local Credit Union, concentrated 
on developing skills in financing so that they could learn 
how to handle group and individual finances as well as how 
to save money and spend it more wisely. The workshop method 
could best describe these activities. The local Home and 
School organization had a demonstration on a school technique. 
Another educational group had two demonstrations at its 
meetings, one dealing with weaving and the other with the 
making of salads. A local handicraft group used demonstra¬ 
tion and workshop techniques to a great extent in learning 
such things as weaving, rug-making, leather work and copper 
tooling. In the line of cultural endeavours, a local 
painting group carried on a number of informal workshops 
once a week and then demonstrated their painting techniques 
at an art exhibit held in a nearby town. Furthermore, a 
local drama club conducted a series of ten workshops on 
various techniques in drama. 

Lectures and instruction . A more formal approach 
to adult education was obtained through the lecture and 
instruction method. Besides the instruction in drama and 
painting mentioned above, the local Civil Defence organiza-

tion sent lecturers around to various groups within the 
town* A two-day coaching school for basketball was 
sponsored by the Recreation Board and over one hundred people 
attended from various towns and cities in Southern Alberta. 
Five town residents took part in it. The Baptist Youth 
organization held a one-day leadership conference in Olds 
during the winter. Local residents had the opportunity to 
take flying instruction but few availed themselves of this 
opportunity* Over twenty men from Olds and surrounding 
district took part in a two-day retreat held at Cochrane, 
Alberta. Omitted from this section, as well as others, 
are all of the rural activities carried on by the District 
Agriculturalist and other rural agencies. 

Courses . The offering of local courses provided a 
very formal approach to adult education. Squadron A of the 
King’s Own Calgary Regiment carried out a wireless course 
as well as a Junior non-commissioned officer’s course for 
those wishing to qualify for corporal status. Furthermore, 
the squadron conducted a four-month course on civil defence. 
Local civil defence leaders planned to sponsor home nursing, 
welfare and first aid courses as they had done in previous 
years, but these were not carried out during the period of 
the survey. Some leaders, however, did attend special civil 
defence courses held in Edmonton and near Ottawa. Members 
of the local Boy Scout Group Committee took part in a one- 
day leadership course. The Olds’ School of Agriculture held

a one-week sewing course for women of Olds and district. 

In conclusion, mention must again be made of the ten-week 
drama course conducted on ten consecutive Wednesday nights 
during the period of the survey. The courses mentioned 
above suggest that some community members had an excellent 
means for increasing their education. 

Other adult education . Most effective use of facilities for 

adult education was provided by the Provincial School of 

3 

Agriculture and Home Economics, located just outside the 
boundaries of the town but an integral part of it. It 
consisted of a farm (operated in conjunction with the school) 
plus modern dormitories, classrooms, laboratories, and shops 
and barns. The school gave practical training for scientific 
farming to one hundred young people (ninety boys and ten 
girls). They came mainly from Alberta farms but there was 
also representation from other parts of the world. The 
courses lasted from late October, 1957 to early April, 1958, 
a period of over five months* 

For the boys, a variety of courses were offered in 
plant and animal husbandry, farm mechanics, farm management, 
poultry raising, dairying, and horticulture. In the plant

science field the subjects covered field husbandry, botany, 
horticulture, entomology, and bee-keeping. Animal sciences 
dealth with livestock breeding, dairying, and poultry. The 
farm mechanics course was equally varied in nature and inclu¬ 
ded metalwork, welding, farm motors, farm machinery, and 
farm buildings. In addition to the practical farm courses, 
the students had training in English and public speaking. 

All girls spent their time in the study of foods, 
clothing and home management. Their timetable also included 
typing, bookkeeping, English, horticulture, public speaking, 
poultry, and home nursing. 

The students had considerable social life. In the 
realm of sports, basketball, volley ball, curling, hockey, 
boxing, wrestling, tumbling, and judo all helped to round 
out the students* school life. Besides regular social 
functions, a large staff of students worked on the O.S.A. 
Yearbook and the Chinook, a school paper published three or 
four times during the school session. 

The school served in other capacities to provide a 
measure of adult education for town and especially rural 
residents. In addition to the regular courses mentioned 
above, the following services were provided by the schools 
1. Field days for farmers (for example, tours of gardens,

of the Provincial School of Agriculture, Olds, Alberta, 
dated March 31, 1958.

IV. PROGRAMME TYPES AND EXTENT OF PROGRAMME PLANNING 

Another phase of organizational life in the community 
is revealed in the programme types employed. Table X 
exhibits, in order of favor, these programme types as well 
as their degree of usage. All organizations with the 
exception of one (Squadron A, King f s Own Calgary Regiment) 
employed general discussions as their most-favored programme 
type. The second most-favored programme type was that of 
speakers (34 organizations) although only 16 organizations 
used it to any great extent (shown by adding the two figures 
7 and 9 in the "Much” and "Average 11 columns). Films and

slides were used to some extent by 23 organizations (12 
"Average" and 11 "Little"). Demonstrations occupied fourth 
place in favor but a majority of organizations (36) did not 
employ it. Following closely behind demonstrations in order 
of favor were workshops as a programme technique, with 6 
using it much and the remaining 9 employing it to a lesser 
degree (4 "Average" and 5 "Little")* Panel discussions were 
used by only 10 organizations and in these, they were used 
very little (2 "Average" and 8 "Little"). "Buzz" sessions, 
as a programme technique, were practically neglected since 
only 1 organization used it much and another used it only 
moderately or average. Included in the programme type 
listed as "Others" were such examples as role-playing, skits, 
and debates (only 6 instances of these types). 

Part of this section of the survey dealt with how 
programmes were planned and the amount of time spent on 
them. The extent of executive control of programmes was 
found to be considerable. As a result, these programmes may 
have been colored by the aptitudes, skills, needs and desires 
of the executives. Only to a lesser degree did members 
control programmes. Just how they were planned is shown in 
these results:

Methods 1, 2 and 3 indicate the extent of executive control 
of programmes (in 35 out of 52 organizations), while, on the 
other hand, method 6 shows the limited extent of control by 
members (12 organizations). As shown in methods 3 and 
only 10 organizations made use of a programme committee, a 
method by which a heavy load is taken from the hands of the 
executive. 

The amount of time spent in planning programmes varied 
from one organization to another, but almost one-half of 
them (twenty-two) had planning done by the chairman, execu¬ 
tive or committees just a few days ahead of general meetings. 
Five organizations had general planning done one year in 
advance, twelve had a month or more preparation and thirteen 
showed that plans were left until the actual meeting was 
underway. In the last case, the general effectiveness of 
programmes seems questionable. When planning is left until 
the last minute, there is little possible chance of programme 
progression from year to year. In terms of education theory, 
in order to be effective, a general programme should go from 
one stage of difficulty to another and should cover a wide 
field of endeavour as time goes on. Furthermore, logical 
sequence should be employed and goals or aims fulfilled 
before proceeding on. In such planning, a "blank" does not 
appear in the total programme picture and repetition is

avoided so that new situations can be examined* Left to 
chance, the programme drifts in the direction indicated by 
strong individual wishes and the effectiveness of the 
organization as a whole may be lessened. Lack of planning 
may lead to strange deviations and unusual emphasis on minor 
objectives. From an education point of view, lack of pro¬ 
gramme planning leaves much to be desired. However, organi¬ 
zation members may like to do things this way, especially 
where socializing is about as important as individual devel¬ 
opment. The persistence of this way of doing things suggests 
it fulfills some function regarded as useful and tolerable, 
if not desirable. 

V. INTERACTION AMONG COMMUNITY GROUPS 

In a small community, organizations often work to¬ 
gether regularly to attain large goals which otherwise 
could not be reached by any one organization. More often 
there is considerable co-operation among organizations of a 
similar nature. In many instances, isolated or infrequent 
cases of co-operation help to promote cordial relations among 
organizations. However, interviewees in twenty-four of the 
organizations covered in the survey found no direct need 
for co-operation with other organizations. Instead, indi¬ 
rect co-operation came from supporting the functions of other 
groups or by avoiding a conflict in function dates. More 
often, indirect co-operation resulted from members belonging

to other organizations. It resulted then from individual 
co-operation rather than from that of the group as a whole. 

There were many instances of co-operation to achieve 
large goals. The Agricultural Society worked with many town 
and rural organizations to present a summer fair. The 
Legion members co-operated with the Ladies Auxiliary to the 
Legion, the Elks, the I.O.D.E., the Masonic Lodge, and the 
Boy Scout Group Committee to sponsor such youth organizations 
as the Air Cadets, Teen Town, Boy Scouts, and Girl Guides 
besides giving their facilities free of charge to these 
youth organizations. Legion members also worked with the 
Elks 1 organization to provide fluids for the local Elks 1 hockey 
club, and, together with numerous other town organizations, 
they presented a Remembrance Day programme. Seven organiza¬ 
tions assisted the Community Chest group in providing 
Christmas hampers to the needy. The Community Chest organi¬ 
zation, itself, was made up of representatives from many town 
organizations. Members of the Royal Purple, the I.O.D.E. 
and the Hospital Auxiliary pooled their efforts to help the 
Red Cross sponsor a local blood donor clinic* Numerous 
instances were reported of the lending of facilities to other 
groups. 

Most of the co-operation among organizations of a simi¬ 
lar nature came from religious institutions. Women of six 
different religious denominations held a "Women’s Day of 
Prayer 11 . Besides exchanges of missionary speakers, both

clergy and church exchanges were conducted during the Lenten 
season. The "Youth For Christ'* movement included members 
from various Protestant churches. Other forms of co-opera¬ 
tion existed between service, lodge, religious, and recrea¬ 
tional clubs such as the Legion and Ladies Auxiliary, the 
Elks and the Royal Purple, the Masonic Lodge and the Order 
of the Eastern Star, the Holy Name Society and the Catholic 
Women’s League, junior and senior Women’s Auxiliaries, 
inter-church organizations and the two curling clubs. 

Co-operation of an isolated or infrequent nature 
was abundant. A number of organizations bought furniture 
for a man who had his house destroyed by fire. The Recrea¬ 
tion Board provided supervisors for the Kiwanis playground 
and in addition to working with the Kiwanis, Elks, and Legion 
organizations, they promoted a swimming pool for the town. 

In turn, the Recreation Board was assisted in an advisory 
capacity by the Chamber of Commerce. There were numerous 
instances of co-operative welfare work in assisting the local 
hospital, school students, the Old Folks’ Home, and the 
Salvation Army. Members of the local Civil Defence organiza¬ 
tion, with the help of the local chapter of the Alberta 
Association of Registered Nurses, planned to present first 
aid classes, home nursing courses, lectures, and panel 
discussions to both individuals and organizations. In addi¬ 
tion to the regular means of co-operation previously mention¬ 
ed, these spontaneous acts tended to promote cordial relations

among community organizations. No instances of conflict, 
competition or rivalry were found among the organizations. 
Interaction appeared to be only of a positive nature. 

VI. NEEDS FOR ADULT EDUCATION AND PROPOSED 
FUTURE PLANS IN THE COMMUNITY 

During the course of the survey, interviewees were 
asked what they thought were the adult education needs in 
the community. In addition to these comments, more were 
solicited from over eighty members of the Home and School 
Association who used their November meeting to discuss the 
same topic in nine groups of eight to ten members each. 

A classification of comments brought to light the following 
needs:

Courses suggested by respondents were those which are usually 
offered at night school. Shopwork and household education 
were the two most-favored subjects (six comments and four, 
respectively), while a multitude of other suggestions covered 
the following topics i gardening, parent education, and public 
speaking (two comments each); one comment each for salesman¬ 
ship, comptometry, typing, parliamentary procedure, mental

health, alcoholic rehabilitation, immigrant education, 
control of money for economic security, civil defence, 
traffic and safety education, and lectures on other countries. 

Respondents gave very little elaboration in their 
comments on the need for a library in the town of Olds. 
However, four of the twenty-three respondents were concerned 
with how a library might be started, where it could be loca¬ 
ted, and how it might be handled. Members of the local 
Women*s Institutes are attempting to promote the idea of a 
library, but nothing concrete has developed as yet. Only 
two instances were found of local use of the library of the 
Department of Extension in Edmonton. 

We have noted already that very little in the way of 
cultural endeavours was present in the organizational life 
of the community during the survey period. In the survey 
of needs mentioned above, sixteen comments on fine arts 
further indicated the lack of cultural life in the community. 
Since the time of those comments, a drama club has been 
organized, a successful cultural programme called "Maytime 
in Alberta" was held, and a three-day Community Forum, 
sponsored by the Department of Extension, was planned for 
mid-August of 1958. Furthermore, preliminary steps have been 
taken to provide a Community Art School for the winter of 
1958-1959. 

A total of 8 comments were given for the formation of 
clubs for specific interests. The clubs indicated were as

follows: a hobby club (2 responses), a glee club (2), 
a photography, study group, square dancing, and a Canadian 
Club (1). 

Community needs other than those of adult education 
were also expressed, A community centre with recreational 
facilities (especially for swimming) and meeting facilities 
was the hope stated by eleven members of the group mentioned 
previously. 

A glimpse of community future plans in adult education 
concludes the discussion of community needs. The Recreation 
Board plans to form hobby and woodwork classes as well as a 
glee club. Plans for the fall of 1958 include the production 
of a three-act play by the local drama club. The Civil 
Defence organization will be extending its services in first 
aid classes, home nursing courses, newspaper articles, lec¬ 
turing and panel groups. Members of the Olds* Ministerial 
Association wish to form both a Christian Business Men’s 
Association and a Toastmaster’s Club. Ladies of the Presby¬ 
terian Evening Auxiliary will be studying women in the Bible, 
and members of the United Church Women’s Auxiliary are 
arranging a series of speakers on various topics covering 
such things as religion, law, and medicine. Members of a 
local teachers’ association have discussed the possibility 
of having formal classes in English grammar, but most hopeful 
of all is an attempt by the local Home and School Association 
to arouse interest in adult education.

The other organizations previously mentioned but not 
described in this section indicated an intention to continue 
providing, mainly by informal means, adult education activi¬ 
ties designed for improvement of the individual. 

Summary and conclusions . A substantial amount of 
adult education was carried on by the community organizations 
during the period of the survey (35*7 per cent of listed ac¬ 
tivities were of an adult education nature). The major aim 
and outcome of organizational life appeared to be "individual 
improvement", a term synonymous with adult education, which 
came through the activities designed to be of an educational 
value to the individual. All institutional groups were in¬ 
volved in adult education (though it was not necessarily 
called by that name) in varying ways and degrees, with the 
main ways or types as follows: educational discussions and 
study periods, books and newspaper articles, films and slides, 
speakers and informal talks (both were highly used), tours, 
demonstrations and workshops for the development of skills, 
lectures and instruction, formal courses, and other types. 
There appeared to be, however, a lack of variety in programme 
types and many organizations seemed to spend too little time 
in programme planning (according to education theory). Execu¬ 
tive control of programmes was considerable in comparison 
with the amount of control exerted by general memberships. 

A fairly high degree of inter-organizational co-opera-

tion was evident from the activities carried on during the 
survey. No instances of organizational rivalry were found. 

Local residents expressed the need for courses such 
as are offered in night school, for a library, for cultural 
activities and for clubs for specific interests. Some future 
organizational plans were expressed for the continuance of 
adult education in the community. 

The following are some conclusions which the findings 
in Chapter III suggest: 

1. The functions of a majority of the organizations are 
not being directed toward their stated aims. It appears to 
be a question of the idealistic being replaced by the practi¬ 
cal, the lofty aims giving way to the precedence of practical 
functions. 

2. There appears to be a definite need in the community for 

a measure of cultural activities apparently lacking at present. 

3. The three major outcomes of organizational life call 
attention to the highly personal interests involved in 
joining an organization. Personal benefit must result from 
belonging to an organization. 

b* Much adult education is being carried out in the communi¬ 
ty though it may not be called by that name. All institution¬ 
al groups are involved in it in varying ways and degrees. 

5. There is undoubtedly room for more courses of a formal 
nature in the community*s adult education activities since those 
found appeared excellent for adult education yet too few in 
number.

6- The Provincial School of Agriculture enriches the 
picture of adult education in Olds through its wide usage. 

7. Evidently there is not much variety in programme types 
in the town organizations. Lack of knowledge of newer 
techniques such as "buzz" sessions and role-playing may 
account for the relatively unprogressive approach to pro¬ 
gramme planning. Newer group techniques may improve pro¬ 
gramme variety and insure better attendance at meetings 
which, as referred to in Table II, showed an average atten¬ 
dance of only 45.2 per cent for all organizations. 

8. From an interest point of view, the method of programme 
planning where the entire membership enters into the picture 
may be more effective in encouraging members to turn out to 
meetings. From an education point of view, lack of programme 
planning leaves much to be desired. However, organization 
members may like to do things this way. 

9. A fairly high degree of inter-organization co-operation 
aided in the achievement of worthy goals which no doubt 
benefited the town. 

10. Though the above co-operation no doubt benefited the 
town, it was not directed toward some of the outstanding 
needs of town residents. Those needs, as expressed by many 
organization executives or general memberships, consisted of 
courses such as are given in night school, of a library, 
and of a measure of cultural activities.

11* Provision of a night school would appear to answer 
some of the needs expressed by community members. A community 
civic centre could be used for night school adult education 
programmes as well as for recreation or organizational groups. 

12. There appears to be a distinct need for a library in 
the town. For a town with well over two thousand inhabitants, 
Olds appears to lack proper library facilities when such could 
probably be provided at a low cost to everyone. Furthermore, 
more use could be made of existing facilities such as the 
library of the Department of Extension in Edmonton*

CHAPTER IV 

ADULT EDUCATION CARRIED ON THROUGH MASS MEDIA 
OF COMMUNICATION 

Adult education is a continuous process. The indi¬ 
vidual is aware of it not only in the organizational life 
of the community but in the mass media of communication 
which are available to him. These mass media, in one form 
or another, reach into everone*s life, and the home itself 
becomes a veritable college where radio, television, news¬ 
papers, periodicals and books contribute to the daily job 
of increasing one*s education. The theatre, as well as 
other film sources, add to the knowledge which the individual 
gathers at home. A constant n bombardment u of adult education 
from many different sources makes the amount of formal edu¬ 
cation received at school seem insignificant in amount. 

More education results today through community organizational 
life and mass media of communication than could ever be pre¬ 
sented during the few years that an individual attends school 
in his youth. Education is a life-long process despite what 
thoughts the individual may have about his education being 
finished when he has left school. The only difference is the 
means by which he receives that education. 

To catch a glimpse of the amount of adult education 
carried on through mass media of communication, the month

of January, 1958, was chosen as a sample period of time in 
which to conduct a survey. Twenty-one town members of the 
Language 20 class in the Olds* High School conducted a survey 
of radio and television participation (January 6 to January 
31, inclusive) using a booklet in which they recorded adult 
participation from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. for the twenty-six-day 
period. A sample page from this booklet is given in Appendix 
B. The booklet included spaces for information on the number 
of hours the radio or television set was on (6—10 p.m.), the 
average number of adult participants (specifying "mother”, 
"father", and visiting male or female), and programme comments 
on the names of programmes, stations, times, and programme 
suitability (excellent, good, fair, poor; educational). 

A total of 59 town students from grades ten to twelve 
attended Olds 1 High School during January, 1958, and of this 
total, the 21 town students in the Language 20 class were taken 
as an extremely small sample. No thought was given to obtain¬ 
ing a random sample of the entire High School. Furthermore, 
the sample could not be considered inclusive of every type of 
home since students in grade eleven and twelve represent a 
fairly select group. Caution is advised, then, in. interpreting 
the results of the survey. However, since the sample was 
a natural study group in the school and since a daily 
check on entries into the booklet could be made easily, 
this sample group was selected and it made the survey a class 
project for the month of January. The hours from 6 p.m. to

10 p.m. were chosen as the period to survey because parents 
were home together most frequently during that period of 
time. Furthermore, the students could have better super¬ 
vision of entries into the booklets since they were home 
most often, too, during that time. 

As an index of magazine reading, information on maga¬ 
zines sold in town during the month of January was obtained 
on forms passed out to operators of the four newsstands in 
town and to a subscription agency located within the town. 
They recorded, in order from largest to smallest, the number 
of sales for the top twenty magazines. A compilation was 
then made of the magazines most frequently read by local 
residents. 

Figures for January newspaper sales were received by 
way of letters from nearby major newspaper companies. Town 
newspaper sales for January were reported by the editor of 
the local newspaper, Mr. Neil Leatherdale. Sales of other 
newspapers, like the Saturday edition of the Toronto Star 
Weekly, were obtained from the four town newsstands and the 
subscription agency. 

The local theatre manager supplied a list of films 
shown in January and the approximate town attendance at each 
one. Names of other films and attendance for January were 
supplied by the secretary of the local Film Council. 

The surveys mentioned in previous paragraphs were

formulated to provide a sample picture of adult education 
obtained through mass media of communication available in a 
Central Alberta town. Each medium will be examined in the 
following order: 

1. Adult education through the media of radio and television 

2. Adult education through the media of periodicals and 
newspapers 

3. Adult education through the medium of films. 

I. ADULT EDUCATION THROUGH THE MEDIA OF 
RADIO AND TELEVISION 

The Language 20 class survey of radio and television 
participation involved twenty-one homes, fourteen having 
television sets (one in each home) and seven having only 
radio sets. All homes had radio sets varying in number from 
one to six sets. In the twenty-six-day period covered, there 
were four Mondays to Fridays, inclusive, but only three 
Saturdays and Sundays. All hours of participation for each 
day were added to obtain a daily average participation. 

Both media will be examined together and compared in the 
following order: 

1. Degree of participation from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. 

2. Type and amount of adult participation 

3. Type of programmes and station participation.

Degree of participation from 6 p.m. to 10 p,m. Radio 
and television have long been accepted as media for adult 
education. Radio usage, however, has been challenged 
recently by television and, in homes where there is both 
radio and television, the radio appears to occupy a minor 
position. Table XI shows radio and television adult parti¬ 
cipation from January 6 to January 31> 1953, in the twenty- 
one homes covered in the survey. The table is divided into 
four columns, the first dealing with average radio partici¬ 
pation in all homes, the second, with average radio partici¬ 
pation in seven homes without television, the third with 
radio participation in homes with both radio and television, 
and the fourth with television participation in the fourteen 
homes which had television sets. From Column 1 we see that 
average radio participation for all homes was 43.8 minutes 
per day during the four hours from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. of the 
twenty-six-day period. However, for homes without television, 
the daily participation was 2.1 hours or 126 minutes (slight¬ 
ly over 2 hours from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. as shown in Column 2). 
During the four-hour periods, the average television partici¬ 
pation, as shown in Column 4, was 2.8 hours (168 minutes) or 
slightly over 2i hours. Television audiences, therefore, 
used their sets more than radio audiences used their radios 
(an average of 0.7 hours or 42 minutes more per day during 
the four-hour periods). Looking in Column 3 at homes with

both radio and television, we see that the average radio 
participation was only 3.6 minutes for the four-hour periods, 
this participation consisting mainly of news broadcasts. 
Television almost completely replaced radio (it did on 
Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays) during the four-hour periods 
in homes where both television and radio were found. 

A negligible amount of difference existed in the 
average radio participation from day to day. In all homes 
(Column 1) radio usage was most on Tuesdays (50.4 minutes) 
and least on Sundays (30 minutes). However, in homes with¬ 
out television (Column 2) the radio was used most frequently 
on Saturdays (138 minutes). Because of local hockey broad¬ 
casts, families with both radio and television (Column 3) 
favored Tuesday evenings for radio listening (an average of 
10.8 minutes). Column 4 indicates that average television 
usage was most on Mondays (3.3 hours, or 198 minutes) and 
least on Fridays (2.4 hours or 144 minutes). Average tele¬ 
vision usage on Sundays was slightly less than on Mondays 
(0.2 hours, or an average of 12 minutes less). 

Discrimination in radio listening appeared to be 
greater than that for television. The degree of radio and 
television usage during the twenty-six days is given below:

In no cases for radio listening did families have their sets 
on for all twenty-six four-hour periods during the survey. 

Only 6 families had radios on for some full four-hour periods 
during the twenty-six days. A total of 9 families completely 
disregarded the radio for all twenty-six days. A certain 
degree of discrimination in radio listening is apparent from 
the above information. Conversely, little discrimination 
existed in television viewing. Of the fourteen families, 

4 had their sets on the full four hours for the twenty-six 
days, and all families had their sets on four hours for at 
least some of the days in the survey period. Furthermore, 
no families left their television sets off for all of the 
four-hour periods during the survey. 

Type and amount of adult participation . If each four- 
hour period were taken as one instance of participation, then 
during the twenty-six days, mothers could have participated 
546 times in radio listening and 364 times in television view¬ 
ing. Fathers could have participated 520 times in radio 
listening (the number for fathers was reduced by 26 since 
one home had no father) and 364 times in television viewing. 
Table XII compares mother and father participation for the 
6 p.m. to 10 p.m. periods from January 6 to January 31* 1956. 
In all cases, mother participation for radio and television 
during the possible periods was greater than that of father 
participation (average for all homes with radio was 17 per

cent for mothers, 12.7 per cent for fathers; the average for 
all homes with television was 67 per cent for mothers, 57*1 
per cent for fathers). Mothers, therefore, participated 
in a greater percentage of the total possible periods than 
did fathers or, in other words, radio and television partici¬ 
pation for mothers was probably greater than that for fathers. 
A comparison between radio and television usage for both par¬ 
ents points out that television was used far more frequently 
than radio (television was used 62.1 per cent of the possible 
periods; radio, 14.9 per cent of the possible periods)* 

Very few adult male or female visitors came to the homes 
to participate in radio listening during the survey period. 
Only five families reported instances of visitors (fourteen 
female; eleven male). On the other hand, eleven of the 

; 

fourteen families with television reported a number of 
visitors (seventy-one female and sixty-five male). 

Tvne of programmes and station participation. Part 
of the survey consisted of programme comments on the type of 
programme listened to, adult reaction ("excellent", "good", 
"fair", "poor"; "educational") and stations tuned in. Radio 
programme types were divided into four categoriess music, 
sports, news and drama (radio plays). News programmes were 
the most-favored type (ninety-six comments) while the others 
were, in order of favor, music (eighty-nine comments), drama 
(forty-two) and sports (twenty-nine)* The last three types, 
mainly of an entertaining nature, were significantly subor-

of the town during the month of January, 1958. Four news¬ 
stands and one subscription agency handled most of the read¬ 
ing material that came into the town, but there were some 
sources (such as individual subscriptions direct to the 
magazine company) which could not be approached to obtain 
their sales. Since it would have been impractical for the 
five sources mentioned above to list sales for the hundreds 
of different magazines they sold, they listed instead the 
number of sales for their top twenty magazines. The maga¬ 
zines varied in frequency of publicatioh, but the figures 
taken for sales represented the total number of magazines sold 
regardless of this frequency of publication. In turn, the 
five lists of top twenty sales were compiled to give a master 
list of magazines most frequently read in the town. Approxi¬ 
mately one-half of purchases in town were made by rural 
residents; therefore, the figures for sales were reduced by 
one-half to obtain sales to town residents. The master list 
shown below is divided intto three groups depending on the 
main type of readers “men", "women 11 and "family". The name 
and frequency of publication, and estimated town purchases 
are given for each in order of favor. The number of sales 
given for each does not represent the actual number sold 
during January since some sources may not have listed these 
magazines in the top twenty sales. However, the master list 
does point out the magazines most frequently read by male,

Sub-total

Sale of publications mainly for male readers out¬ 
numbered those for female readers in the five lists of top 
twenty sales* There were 22 male, 14 female, and 8 family 
publications in the top magazine sales for January, 1958. 

Sale of family publications outnumbered sales both for males 
or females, the total being 424 family sales, 28? male sales, 
and 273 female sales* The total of sales for the top twenty 
magazines sold from the five sources was, therefore, an 
estimated 984 magazines. A few other magazines were sold, 
but their number was very small since they were not listed 
in the top twenty sales from each source. 

It was mentioned previously that the town population 
was 2,168 as of March 31, 1958, but the student body of the 
Provincial School of Agriculture raises this total to 2,268* 
This figure is composed of 758 adult males, 690 adult females, 
and 820 children. If one-half of the family sales were made 
to adult males, then the estimated total number of magazine 
sales to males would be 287 plus one-half of 424, or 499 sales*

Likewise, if the other half of family sales were made to 
adult females, the total estimated female sales would be 
273 plus one-half of 424, or 465 sales. A comparison be¬ 
tween male and female estimated sales shows that adult male 
sales were 0.66 magazines per male (499 * 758) and 0.67 
magazines per female (465 ♦ 690). Estimated female sales 
per person were, therefore, slightly greater than estimated 
male sales per person, but in both cases the figures show 
that magazine sales for adults were extremely low for the 
month. Combining both adult male and female sales, we see 
that the average magazine sales during the month for adults 
were 0.68 magazines (984 4 1,448). In as much as the six- 
month survey was conducted during the winter, it is likely 
that an approximate average of four magazines per adult 
person were sold during the survey period. 

The top four male publication sales were as follows: 
"True 11 (42 sales), "Argosy 11 (27 sales), "Outdoor Life (24 
sales), and "Cavalier" (20 sales). In each case they con¬ 
tained adventure or outdoor stories which appealed to male 
tastes. For females, it was "True Story" (99 sales), 
"Ladies* Home Journal" (54 sales), "Redbook" (27 sales), 
and "Good Housekeeping" (23 sales). These are magazines 
primarily containing stories of love and romance but also 
suggestions which are helpful around the home. The four top 
family sales were made up of "The Saturday Evening Post"

(182 sales, largest of all magazine sales), "Readers 1 
Digest" (78 sales), "Life" (66 sales), and "Maclean's 
(66 sales). Since "Readers' Digest" is a monthly publication 
(the other three are published more than once a month), it 
probably went into more homes than each of the other three 
magazines. 

Thousands of newspapers were purchased locally during 
the month of January, 1958. They were distributed through 
the local post office, newsstands, street sales and home 
deliveries. Newspaper sources specified the sales made 
during the month and since home deliveries and sales at local 
newsstands indicated that approximately seventy-five per cent 
of those sales were made to town residents, the totals given 
by the outside newspaper sources were reduced by twenty-five 
per cent. The figures given below for monthly sales repre¬ 
sent, therefore, a close estimate of newspaper sales in 
January, 1958, to town residents:

Daily newspapers, then, were found in many local homes 
during January, 1958. They were, in order of favor, "The 
Calgary Herald" (9*243 copies), "The Albertan" (2,964 sales), 
and "The Edmonton Journal" (801 sales). Since there were 
twenty-six publishing days during the month of January, the 
daily average circulation in town was approximately 356, 

114, and 31 copies respectively. The local "Gazette", a 
weekly publication, had 3*300 copies sold during the month, 
with these copies going to 660 local residents (five publish¬ 
ing days during the month). Since there were 1,448 possible 
adult readers for newspapers, the average monthly number of 
newspapers purchased by each adult was 12.3 (17*843 ♦ 1,448). 
On the average, therefore, it is likely that each adult 
bought approximately seventy-four newspapers during the six- 
month survey period compared with approximately four magazines. 

III. ADULT EDUCATION THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF FILMS 

The local theatre presented three different main 
feature films a week during January, 1958, and for the month 
the total was fourteen. In addition to the main features, 
a number of shorts were shown. The list which follows gives

a classification and the adult attendance figures (for town 
residents) for each film. The main features are listed in

The approximate gross adult attendance for town residents 
during the month was 948 people* Since the town adult 
population was 1,448, the average number of shows likely at¬ 
tended by town residents during the six-month period from 
October 1, to March 31 > 1957-1958 would be approximately 
four shows. 

Of the fourteen main films shown during the month, 
four were classified as "Western 11 , two as "Comedy" and eight 
as "Drama". Western films were best attended by town adults 
(an average of 73 persons) while comedies were poorest 
attended (an average of only 47 persons). A biographical 
drama, "The Wings of Eagles" had the highest town attendance 
(124 persons), but close behind it was a Mexican drama 
(especially appealing to children) called "Bandido" (one 
hundred persons). For short films, there were nine news, 
six comedy, and four documentary films. 

During January, 1958, a total of 118 people viewed 
films made available by the local Film Council. However, 
the majority of viewers were from rural areas. Sixty members

of the Baptist church viewed four sport films ("Heritage", 
"Hunting with a Camera", "Fishing in Newfoundland", and 
"Red Runs the Fraser"). Twenty-eight students of the Provin¬ 
cial Agricultural School used three films on various topics 
("Hockey Series", "Australia, Land of Change", and "Vegetable 
Insects")* The third group, a district 4-H club, saw five 
comedy films ("City Slicker", "Champs of the Chase", "Carni¬ 
val at the Zoo", and "Frustrating Fours and Fascinating 
Fives"). Town residents made little use of this source. 

Two phases of adult education were not covered in the 
January survey of mass media of communication. The first, 
correspondence courses, was omitted entirely since no 
instances of them could be found. The second, books, was 
left out because there is no library in town and little or 
no use was made of lending library facilities. The only 
book sales made were "pocketbooks" purchased from local 
newsstands or individual book purchases made out of to™. 

Summary and conclusions . Television audiences used 
their sets more than radio audiences used their radios. 

It would appear that discrimination in radio listening was 
greater than that for television. Mothers appeared to make 
more use of both media than did fathers. Visitors came to 
homes to view television more often than to listen to radio 


broadcasts

Sale of magazines mainly for male readers appeared to 
outnumber those for female readers. Average monthly sales 
during the month of January, 1958, were approximately 0,68 
magazines per person. On the other hand, each adult bought 
an estimated 12,3 newspapers. The average number of shows 
per month attended by the town adult residents was 0,66 shows. 

If the month of January were taken as an average winter 
month, then individual use of mass media of communication 
during the six-month survey period could be estimated as 
follows (estimates given in round figures): radio, 131 hours 
during the periods 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. for approximately 180 
days in the six-month period (0,73 x 180); television, 504 
hours during the periods 6 p.m. to 10 p.m, for approximately 
180 days in the six month period (2.8 hours x 180); magazines, 
4 per person; newspapers, 74 per person; and, finally, 4 
shows per person. No degree of importance should be attached 
to these estimates which made no comparison between male and 
female participation and which, in the radio and television 
survey, did not involve a representative group or sample. 

The estimates do, however, give some indication of the extent 
of usage of mass media of communication in the town of Olds 
during the survey period from October to March, inclusive, 
1957-1958. 

The findings of Chapter IV suggest the following 
conclusions:

1. Television appeared to be used more frequently than 
radio. Its value as a social medium, as well as a means 
for adult education and entertainment, was apparently far 
greater than that of radio* 

2. The radio, as a medium for adult education, did not 
provide an extensive service since it apparently was not 
used to any great extent in the homes (especially in those 
which had television). However, though it was used less 
frequently than television in the survey homes, a greater 
percentage of its programmes timed in appeared to be of an 
adult education nature. 

3. As more homes obtain television sets, the influence of 
radio will probably decline still more. 

4. Unlike most television audiences, radio listeners have 
become discretional in usage of their sets. This may be a 
habit which has built up over the years. 

5. Average individual use of magazines as an adult education 
medium seemed to be extremely low. 

6. The influence of the newspaper as a medium for adult 
education appeared far more extensive than that of the 
magazine since over eighteen times more newspapers were sold 
than magazines (12.3 newspapers per person per month compared 
with 0.68 magazines per person per month). 

7* Films did not appear to provide an extensive service 
for adult education in the community.

CHAPTER V 


A SUMMARY OF ADULT EDUCATION IN THE COMMUNITY 
AND PROPOSALS 

I» SUMMARY OF ADULT EDUCATION IN THE COMMUNITY 

A considerable amount of adult education (though it 
may not have been called by that name) was carried on in 
the community during the period of the survey. All organi¬ 
zations within the community were involved in it in varying 
ways and degrees while individual use of mass media of com¬ 
munication added considerably to the total picture. Thus 
a constant "bombardment” of adult education gave opportunity 
for adult residents of the town to increase their education 
and to improve themselves on a civic, job, and personal level. 

Educational organizations exhibited the best average 
attendance at their regular meetings and the younger middle- 
aged group (which made up the memberships of these organiza¬ 
tions) counted on a good measure of rural support in making 
the programmes interesting and successful. Furthermore, the 
town as a whole appeared to depend considerably on the type 
and amount of rural participation given to its endeavours. 

The town, then, certainly was not an independent unit unto 
itself. This fact was verified again by the high degree of 
outside affiliation shown by local organizations. Disconcert¬ 
ing factors were evident, however, in a low average attendance

at meetings for most organizations and in the absence of 
certain town groups in the organizational life of the 
community. 

A predominance of organizations had "individual 
improvement” as their main aim, this aim being borne out in 
a multitude of activities of an educational nature carried 
on during the period of the survey. Such activities includ¬ 
ed educational discussions and study periods, books and 
newspaper articles, films and slides, speakers and informal 
talks, tours, demonstrations and workshops, lectures and 
instruction, and formal courses. Shortcomings were evident, 
however, from the lack of variety in programme plannihg 
among the organizations and in the high degree of executive 
control of programmes. 

While there was a fairly high degree of co-operation 
among some of the organizations, this co-operation did not 
appear to be directed toward some of the outstanding needs 
as expressed by town residents. Those needs consisted of 
night school subjects, a library, and a measure of cultural 
activities. It would appear that a community civic centre 
might help in the fulfillment of these outstanding needs 
but, during the survey period, nothing concrete was being 
done to provide such a centre. 

In the field of mass media of communication, the radio, 
television, magazines, newspapers, and films all combined to

give further opportunity for adult education to the residents 
of the town. The value of television as a social medium (as 
well as a means for adult education and entertainment) 
appeared far greater than that of radio during the period 
of the survey, since television evidently was used to a much 
greater extent than was the radio. Television audiences, 
however, appeared to be less discriminating than radio 
audiences, as was evidenced in their choice of programmes. 

The novelty of television apparently has not worn off to the 
same extent as radio novelty but years of usage and varied 
channel reception may well make television audiences more 
discriminating. In other mass media of communication, the 
newspaper outstripped both magazines and films as an important 
medium for adult education. 

II. PROPOSALS 

Very little appears to have been done for adult educa¬ 
tion in the small town communities of Alberta. Isolated 
attempts have been made in presenting formal programmes in 
some small town communities but, on the whole, these endea¬ 
vours have been few in number and certainly have not appeared 
progressive to any extent from year to year. Since man*s 
leisure time is continuing to increase, it would be wise to 
commence plans to help the individual in any way possible 
so that he may use that time to best advantage. Adult educa-

tion movements in major countries of the world, such as the 
United States, Great Britain and Russia, point out not only 
the desire of adults to increase their education but also 
the fulfillment of the need for an enlightened citizenry, 
especially in the democratic nations. A democratic country 
such as Canada cannot afford to forget about the education 
of its adults during a time of ideological clash such as 
exists today. 

The question now remains as to how adult education 
might best be handled on the dominion, provincial and com¬ 
munity levels. The writer proposes the following suggestions 
which have come as an outgrowth of the study: 

1. Both the provincial and dominion governments might well 
consider the possibility of financing adult education move¬ 
ments at the community level first, since formal adult edu¬ 
cation courses outlined in the present study appeared success¬ 
ful because of government support. 

2. Leadership training in the field of adult education 
should be provided at the university level to focus attention 
on adult education and to assure it of sound leadership and 
success at the community level. Trained leadership appeared 
to be lacking in local programmes. 

3. The Alberta Committee on Adult Education, now sponsored 
by a number of organizations in the province, should act as 

a parent body for community adult education groups, encourage 
their formation, and provide sources of information for the

setting up and continuance of adult education programmes. 

4. The services (especially in the field of library work) 
of the Extension Department of the University of Alberta 
should be extended to more Alberta communities and these 
communities should be made aware of the amount of help 
which can be obtained from this Department. 

5. Community adult education councils should be formed to 
co-ordinate all adult education activities and to supervise 
formal adult education programmes which are progressive from 
year to year. Yearly community surveys would be needed to 
discover the interests and needs of community members. Such 
councils could provide a survey of community resources and 
be instrumental in setting up a calendar of local events. 

They could act closely with the Alberta Committee on Adult 
Education and receive help from it when needed. The council 
would occupy a pivotal position in developing and co-ordinat¬ 
ing adult education. 

6. The school, or possibly civic centre buildings, could 
well become the centre for adult education programmes in the 
community. Provision of night school classes would help to 
give the taxpayer fuller value for his investment in school 
buildings for, as it is now, they are used a little over 
one-half of the possible time that is available. School 
facilities would be ideal for adult education programmes and 
the small extra cost of maintenance for adult use would be 






97 


offset by the invaluable service rendered to the individual 
and the entire community. 

7* Adult education programmes should be geared to meet 
the needs of "outer-fringe 11 groups in the community, thus 
helping to eliminate some of the problems created by them. 

Much remains to be done in the way of research in the 
field of adult education in Alberta. Based on the outcome 
of this study, the following problems for further research 
would include:; 

1. A study of adult education in a rural area surrounding 
a town centre. 

2. A study of community needs followed by the institution 
of a formal adult education programme and a continuing evalu¬ 
ation of that programme. 

3. A study of adult education leadership training provid¬ 
ed at the university level in other provinces or in the 
United States. 

4. A study of the ways and means of financing adult educa¬ 
tion programmes at the community level. 

5e A study of the success of the community adult education 
council movement in the United States. 

6. A study of the role of the public school in community 
adult education programmes in the provinces of Canada. 

Adult education will continue on in our communities 
as adults carry on their various activities, but it lacks

direction and encouragement in the necessary task of educa¬ 
ting the individual so that he may become a more useful 
citizen. When that direction and encouragement are provided, 
adult education will cease to be a by-product of community 
life and will become a conscious part of the life of each 
individual as he continues his never-ending search for 
knowledge.
