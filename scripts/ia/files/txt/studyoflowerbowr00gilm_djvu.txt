A STUDY OF THE LOWER BOW RIVER TROUT 


WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO TAXONOMY 


INTRODUCTION 

For the past number of years the Bow River has 
been building up a reputation as an anglers® paradise. 

The fighting quality of the trout, caught by either fly 
or casting rod, has made this part of the Bow River around 
Carseland an irresistable attraction to the keen angler. 

The accessibility of this area and consistent good catches 
have not only attracted sportsmen from Calgary and the 
surrounding districts, but its fame has spread and American 
tourists visit this area in increasing numbers each year. 

It is impossible to estimate the total catch in 
one year from the area in and around the Carseland Dam. 

Some idea of the number of fish taken may be obtained from 
the fact that the writer caught, and took taxonomic mea¬ 
surements of, 139 trout as well as tagging and releasing 
100 more. The average weight of the 139 fish examined was 
29.9 ounces. These fish were all taken by angling from

May 10 to September 1?. The writer personally knows one or 
two ardent anglers who caught an equal number, if not more, 
within the angling season. On one Sunday, the author saw 
from the middle of the river (marked 0 on sketch, figure I) 
thirty-seven anglers at one time. All these were in the 
area below the dam. 

Despite the many trout taken from this area, and 
the rest of the Bow River from Calgary to Carseland, their 
identity has remained a mystery. There are many problems 
relating to this trout which must be solved in the future 
but it seems imperative that the taxonomic aspects be tackled 
first. It is for this reason that the present study has 
been mainly an attempt to establish the identity of these 
fish. Other biological factors, observed while gathering 
data for the taxonomic study, will also be discussed. 

The Bow River trout, as they will be called in the 
following pages, have been variously called rainbow, steel- 
head and cutthroat trout* As we shall see, none of these 
names is entirely correct. 

According to Neave (19*+3) there is a significant 
difference between the average scale counts of anadromous 
and non-sea-going rainbow trout ( Salmo gairdneri )• The 
sea-going type is known as the steelhead. Since there is 
no direct drainage of the Bow River to the sea, the name 
steelhead is entirely incorrect and can be eliminated from 
further discussion.

It has long been known that the cutthroat ( Salmo 
clarkil ) is the native trout in our East slope streams 
(Jordan and Evermann, 1896), We know that the rainbow 
( Salmo gairdneri ) has been introduced into the Bow River and 
its tributaries for a number of years. It would be reason¬ 
able to assume that these species would both be present In 
the Bow River. However, neither of them seems to be present 
as a true species and this leads to the supposition that 
the Bow River trout is a hybrid between the rainbow and the 
cutthroat. 

The history of the plantings of trout in the Bow 
River and its tributaries gives considerable support to 
the "hybrid 11 theory. The planting history as far back as 
records could be found is given in table lo

It may be seen from this table that both rainbow 
and cutthroat have been planted in colossal numbers in the 
past* Since the cutthroat is the native trout, it would 
seem reasonable they would be mofe likely to survive* It

may also be observed from table I that the total rainbow 
plantings far outnumber the cutthroat. This has probably 
led to a great deal of competition for food and spawning 
beds. Especially in regard to spawning beds it seems likely 
that natural hybridization might have taken place since both 
trout spawn at the same time of year and on the same type 
of bed. 

To go a little further in support of the "hybrid” 
theory, it seems quite possible that the rainbow being 
planted from the Calgary hatchery are themselves not a true 
species. 

During the past summer, it was drawn to the writer* 
attention that the "spawn-takers" for the hatchery were 
unknowingly creating a hybrid. 

Kananaskis Lake, where the cutthroat is the native 
trout, was planted with rainbow in 1936. These rainbow, 
although planted in the Upper lake, soon worked down into 
Lower Kananaskis Lake (Rawson, 1936). These fish have sur¬ 
vived and flourished, and have been used as a "brood stock" 
for the Calgary hatchery. With the cutthroats already 
established, it would seem to be a very simple error to 
fertilize a "batch" of rainbow eggs with the milt from a 
cutthroat, or vice versa. These eggs have been hatched and 
the fingerlings planted in numerous lakes and streams 
throughout the province. Many of these "hybrid" fingerlings 
have been replanted in Kananaskis Lake (table I).

The extent of this suspected hybridization is be¬ 
yond the scope of this thesis but the present indications 
are that it is widespread throughout the province* It is 
highly probable that the Calgary hatchery has no true species 
of rainbow and those so-called are probably hybrids* 

, The Bow River trout seem to combine the sporting 
qualities of both the cutthroat and the rainbow* At certain 
times they will take the lure and break water in a typical 
rainbow fashion; alternately ”running up the line* 1 * breaking 
water and shaking their heads in an attempt to get rid of 
the hook. At other times this trout will not break water 
but heads directly for the bottom. In fast water, a run 
downstream to the end of the line proves a very effective 
means of gaining their freedom with or without ’’hook, line 
and sinker”. 

The most outstanding characteristics of the Bow 
River trout are its variations in colour, markings and 
shape. The general colour may vary from a light shiny silver 
on sides and belly to a greenish-black colouration* The 
back is generally dark, varying from green to almost black. 

A large number of the trout examined were silvery in colour 
with an indistinct ”rainbow stripe” even in spawning season. 
The ’’cutthroat mark” may be present or absent. If present, 
it may extend the whole length of the lower jaw or may be 
confined to a small area. The colour of this ”cut-mark” 
varies from a blood red to an almost yellow colour. The 




- 7 - 


fins may be light or dark, spotted or unspotted. The spots 
on the fins and body may be round or cross-shaped. The 
body may be flat on the dorsal surface, sloping gently up¬ 
wards to the dorsal fin, or -it may project upwards abruptly 
immediately behind the head and extend backwards flatly to 
the dorsal fin. The presence or absence of this abrupt up¬ 
ward projection behind the head seemed to be a conspicuous 
difference in these trout. However, no correlation between 
this character and the assumed rainbow or cutthroat paren¬ 
tage could be found. 


THE POSITION OF THE BOV/ RIVER TROUT WITH RESPECT TO 
OTHER TROUT SPECIES 

The introductory remarks on colour characteristics 
of these Bow River trout serve to indicate the futility of 
identification based on colour characters. Accordingly, it 
was necessary to attempt to define the fish largely from 
morphological characters. This is done by catching and mea¬ 
suring while fresh, as large a number of specimens as pos¬ 
sible. The measurements are taken in the manner described 
by Hubbs and Lagler (19*+7). On each fish 25 measurements 
were made; the parts measured are shorn in the column 
headings in table VIII (appendix). Then by determining 
the proportion that each part bears to the whole length of

the fish, it is possible to compare fish of different sizes 
and to pick out those which differ significantly. For 
example, length of head, length of upper jaw, diameter of 
eye, etc., tend to bear a constant proportion to body length 
in fish of the same species; in fish of different species 
the proportions are apt to be different. 

The most convenient method of making these compari¬ 
sons is to plot the logarithm of the size of each body part 
against the logarithm of the standard length of the fish. 
Rather than calculate the logarithm, it is simpler to plot 
the arithmetic measurements on log-log paper. The curves 
obtained in this way are called relative-growth curves and 
were first used and explained by Huxley (1932). This proce¬ 
dure was used in a preliminary treatment of the data. It 
was found that some of the measurements showed no variability 
and these were left out of further considerations. The 
measurements which showed some promise of taxonomic signifi¬ 
cance were given more intensive study; log-log plots of 
these are shown as black dots on figure 2. 

A careful study of the distribution of the black 
dots on figure 2 shows that they tend to fall into straight 
lines. Now, if the Bow River trout represent a mixed popu¬ 
lation of two species of fish, one would expect the dots to 
be distributed so as to fall into at least two straight 
lines for each character. The inescapable conclusion is 
that these Bow River fish form a reasonably homogeneous

population. The question again arises, what are they, then? 
Are they cutthroat or rainboi* or a hybrid between these 
species? To solve this question it is necessary to compare 
their measurements with similar measurements of bona fide 
rainbow and cutthroat. A search of the literature on the 
taxonomy of trout was made; the pertinent data have been 
extracted and assembled in table II. 

This table also contains measurements of Spray 
Lakes cutthroat (column II) taken by the author. For various 
reasons, to be discussed later, the Spray Lakes cutthroats 
were used as cutthroat standards. Bajkov*s (1925-26) mea¬ 
surements of the Kamloops trout of Jasper Park (column IV) 
were used as rainbow standards. The heavy lines on figure 
2 represent the log-log plots of the cutthroats and the 
lighter lines the log-log plots of the rainbows. The de¬ 
tailed taxonomic discussion which follows is based primarily 
on these curves. To expand and corroborate the evidence 
given by these curves, there is also a discussion of the 
comparative measurements of various trouts in table II. 
Finally the frequency distribution of these measurements 
of body parts of the Bow River trout and other trouts is 


described

A Study of Relative-growth Curves 

In order to understand the purpose of the graphs 
in figure 2, the methods used, and the difficulties encoun¬ 
tered, will be discussed, Bajkov*s rainbow data will then 
be examined and interpreted. The cutthroats will be treated 
in the same manner as the rainbow. Next, the Bow River 
fish will be compared to the other trouts. Finally, the 
characteristics used will be treated individually in their 
relationship to all three types of trout. 

The logarithms of the measurements plotted against 
the logarithm s of the standard length 5 of the fish gives a 
straight line graph. Dymond (1932) has pointed out that 
there is an increase in the relative magnitude of the four 
measurements (head length, maxillary length, inter-orbital 
width and snout length) with an increase in the standard 
length. The advantage of using the logarithm of these mea¬ 
surements is that the error, introduced by using fish of 
different lengths, is eliminated. It is to be noted that 
snout length is not used in the graphs in figure «L. Dymond 
(1932) also states that there is a sexual difference for 
the above mentioned four characteristics. This is borne 
out by graphs in figure 2. The se^^of the Bow River fish 
are indicated by the usual symbols. This appears to apply 
particularly for the trout in which maturity has been 


attained 




12 - 


As discussed in the following pages, not all of 
the characteristics listed at the top of the columns in 
table VIII (appendix) were used. For some of them, no simi¬ 
lar data were available from Bajkov*s rainbow investigations. 
Only those characteristics were used which, from a prelim¬ 
inary examination, showed a significant variability. 

In compiling the rainbow data, it was necessary 
to make some adjustments in order to use some of the mea¬ 
surements taken by Bajkov in his investigations. He gives 
no standard length in his tables and this was calculated 
by plotting the total length against standard length for 
the Bow River fish. The rainbow standard length was inter¬ 
polated from this graph. 

It was planned to use all of the significant 
characteristics shown at the top of the columns of table 
VIII (appendix). This was impossible for some of these mea¬ 
surements as there was no comparable information available 
from Bajkov*s data. This was the case for the following 
characteristics: head depth, body width, adipose length, 

pelvic to anal length and length of the anal base. In 

* 

regard to snout length, Bajkov 1 s fish were measured to the 
anterior surface of the eye ball. The writer's measurements 
were taken to the anterior bony margin of the orbital rim 
(Hubbs and Lagler, 19^7). This difference is small but 
nevertheless this characteristic was omitted from these 
log-log graphs. This measurement was used previously in

table II and is used again in the frequency curves, figures 
3 to 6. 

In order to use the snout to dorsal length measure¬ 
ment, it was necessary to add together the two characteris¬ 
tics, snout to occiput and occiput to dorsal. This was 
done for the Bow River trout and the cutthroats as Bajkov 
did not give these measurements independently. Undoubtedly 
this has introduced a small error in the curves for this 
characteristic. 

The rainbow curves are shown as a fine line in 
figure 2. Each line represents the average change of the 
character for a change in the standard length of the rainbow 
trout. Log-log plots were used to give a straight line. 

The fish were selected without consideration of the sex. 

They represent a selection of trout picked from Bajkov*s 
data with size being the only factor involved. These fish 
were plotted for the various characteristics and the best 
fitting straight line was obtained. It is this line which 
is represented in figure 2 by the fine line. 

The cutthroat trout were treated in a similar 
manner. The heavy lines in figure 2 represent these trout. 
These fish represent all of the cutthroats taken by the 
writer from the Spray Lakes near Banff, Alberta. 

Andrekson f s (19*+9) cutthroat from Gorge Creek 
could have been used. There is no appreciable difference 
between the average proportionate measurements (table II, 







- 14 - 


columns II and III) of the two populations* The Spray Lakes 
fish were chosen for two reasons. Firstly, both these fish 
and the Bow River trout were measured by the writer and any 
errors in taking these measurements would be the same for 
both. Secondly, the Spray Lakes trout were, on the average, 
larger than those from Gorge Creek. Consequently, they 
were considered to be more suitable for making a comparison 
with the larger Bow River trout. 

The Bow River fish are shown on the graphs in 
figure 2 as squares and circles with the usual symbol for 
the sex 0 Only the mature fish in which there was no doubt 
of the sex are shown with the sexes distinguished. 

Included with the Bow River fish are a number of 
trout from the Willow Creek drainage. There were no fish 
taken in the smaller size range from the Bow River. The 
trout in Willow Creek and its tributaries are very similar 
in colour characteristics to those from the Bow River. 

Since they fall along the same straight line as the Bow 
River trout for all of the taxonomic measurements, they are 
considered to be identical with them. 

The Bow River fish (the Willow Creek trout will 
be included in this heading in the following pages) were 
picked at random with the size being the only consideration. 
After these fish were chosen, the sex and 4 cut mark* were 
noted (table VIII appendix). Those shown as circles in figure 
2 are the fish in which the 4 cut mark 4 was absent. The

squares represent all the fish shoving the ‘cut mark* in 
any degree. 

In none of the characteristics shown in figure 2 
is there any appreciable difference between the trout in 
which the ‘cut mark 1 is present and those in which it is 
absent. 

There is a different series of fish used for the 
Bow River trout in the body depth measurement. This was 
necessary as fish taken after spawning had a noticeably 
lesser depth than those which were immature or unripe. In 
order to eliminate this obvious error, only trout which 
were in normal condition were used. 

Each of the twelve taxonomic measurements shown 
in figure 2 will now be discussed individually. Each char¬ 
acteristic will be dealt with in regard to the rainbow, 
cutthroat and Bow River fish. 

Length of Head . For this characteristic, the 
graphs for the rainbow and cutthroat are nearly parallel, 
the rainbow having a slightly longer head than the cutthroat. 
The Bow River trout tends to be scattered over the range of 
both. There is a definite sexual difference; the males 
having a longer head than the females especially in the 
larger mature fish. 

Inter-orbital Width . The rainbow and cutthroat 
graphs are parallel in this character indicating a similar 
change in inter-orbital width with a change in standard 










- 16 


length. The rainbow has a greater inter-orbital width than 
the cutthroat. The Bow River trout are intermediate in 
size but tend to fall along the cutthroat curve. A sexual 
difference is apparent, with the males again being the 
larger. 

Maxillary Length . The rainbow and cutthroat show 
a distinct difference in maxillary length. The increase in 
maxillary length with an increase in standard length is the 
same, i.e., the lines are parallel. The Bow River fish 
follow the cutthroat line and would appear to be very similar 
to them in this characteristic. A very definite sexual 
difference is present with the larger males having a much 
longer maxillary than the cutthroat. This variation can 
probably be explained by the fact that the cutthroats were 
relatively small fish and that both sexes were included in 
the graph. 

Eye Diameter . The cutthroat and rainbow lines 
cross for this characteristic indicating a different rate 
of growth in the two species. The Bow River fish are some¬ 
what intermediate between the two. They tend to follow 
the cutthroat line for the smaller fish but follow the rain¬ 
bow for the greater part of the series. There is no apparent 
sexual difference. 

Snout to Dorsal Length . Since the cutthroat and 
rainbow curves intersect at a small acute angle, there must 
be a slight difference in the relative magnitude of this 













- 17 - 


measurement in the two species. For the smaller fish the 
rainbow tends to be slightly larger; for the longer fish 
the cutthroat has a slightly greater length. The Bow River 
fish are intermediate but tend to follow the cutthroat a 
little more closely. 

Body Depth . The rainbow and cutthroat show the 
same change in body depth with an increase in standard 
length. The rainbow are very slightly (probably not signi¬ 
ficantly) deeper in the body. The Bow River fish tend to 
be a little larger than either of the two species but are 
closer in size to the rainbow. 

Anal Length . For this characteristic there is no 
marked difference in length in the two species. They show 
the same change in anal length with an increase in size of 
the fish. The cutthroat has a greater anal length than 
the rainbow. The Bow River fish are again intermediate and 
tend to be scattered over the range of both species. They 
are like the cutthroat especially in the larger specimens. 

Caudal Peduncle Length . There is a very notice¬ 
able difference in the caudal peduncle length with a propor¬ 
tionate increase in standard length of the two trout. The 
rainbow increases at a considerably greater rate than the 
cutthroat and their caudal peduncles are longer over almost 
the entire range of sizes. The Bow River fish are very 
similar to the cutthroat, following this line quite precisely.

rainbow and cutthroat curves for this characteristic indicates 
a widely different increase in depth with length for the two 
species. For the smaller fish the rainbow has a greater 
caudal peduncle depth; for the intermediate and larger fish 
the cutthroat has the greater depth. The Bow River fish 
tend, as for the other characteristics, to be intermediate 
between the suggested parental stock. For the larger fish 
there is a slightly greater tendency to be like the cutthroat. 

Pectoral and Pelvic Length . These two characteris¬ 
tics are dealt with together as they have very similar 
curves. The best fitting straight lines for both the cut¬ 
throat and rainbow were identical and are shown on the graph 
as one line. There is no significant difference between 
the two species for these two characteristics. The Bow 
River fish follow the general trend of the common curve for 
both characteristics. They have a slightly greater relative 
length in the smaller fish and a slightly shorter relative 
length in the larger specimens. 

Pectoral to Pelvic Length . There is a very slight 
difference in the distance between the pectoral and pelvic 
fins for the two species. The cutthroat is the longer for 
the greater part of the range. The Bow River trout are 
intermediate in size but tend to be more like the cutthroat. 

The conclusions from figure 1 will now be summed 
up briefly. In some characters the Bow River trout are 
intermediate in proportions between the rainbow and the

cutthroat. In all but two of the characteristics (eye dia¬ 
meter and body depth) the Bow River fish show a greater 
tendency to resemble cutthroats than rainbow. 

Comparison of Proportionate Measurements of Bow River Trout 

with Other Trouts 

As mentioned in the introduction, the literature 
on the proportionate measurements of various body parts of 
the trout has been searched and the data found are com¬ 
piled in table II. Included in the table are comparable 
measurements of Bow River trout and the writer* s measure¬ 
ments of cutthroat trout from the Spray Lakes. These data 
(table II) are presented In order to corroborate and expand 
the findings of the log-log graphs, just described. This 
table will be repeated here for convenience and a full 
explanation will follow In the text. 

In this table the characteristics used are the four 
on which Dymond (1931-32) bases his taxonomic findings. The 
measurements are the proportionate measurements; the numbers 
given being the percentages of the standard length which 
the different body parts comprise. The lateral line scales 
are the number of scales counted along the lateral line from 
the posterior margin of the head to the caudal fin. In some 
of the columns the range of these counts, rather than the 
average, is given.

The various abbreviations at the top of the columns, 
numbered I to VIII, represent the following fish. 

Column I Bow : The numbers in this column are the 
average proportionate measurements of 66 male Bow River 
fish. These figures represent all the male trout taken 
below the Carseland dam. 

Column II Spray : These numbers are the average 
proportionate measurements of four male native cutthroats

from Spray Lakes; in parenthesis are the average proportion¬ 
ate measurements of 11 trout, male and female. These 
represent all the trout taken by the writer from this area. 
Both sexes were used (in parenthesis) in order to have com¬ 
parable figures with Andrekson*s (19^9) unsexed cutthroats 
(column III). 

Column III Gorge : The numbers in this column are 
the average proportionate measurements of 101 native cut¬ 
throats taken from Gorge Creek in the Sheep drainage 
(Andrekson, 19^9)• As no sexual differentiation was given 
in Andrekson*s data, both sexes are included in these 
figures. 

Column IV Irideus s These figures are the average 
proportionate measurements of 17 male rainbow trout, (Salmo 
irideus Gibbons, Bajkov, 1927). (The standard lengths of 
Bajkov* s trout were derived in the same manner as described 
previously). 

Column V Clarkii s The numbers in this column 
are the proportionate measurements of one 12 inch male 
cutthroat, ( Salmo clarkii, Dymond, 1932). 

Column YI Alpestris s These figures are the pro¬ 
portionate measurements of Salmo clarkii alpestris (Dymond, 
1931). The average of the paratypes, five males, is given 
first; the type species (one female) being in parenthesis. 
This trout inhabits a somewhat similar environment to the 
cutthroats in Columns II and III but are from the western 
slopes of the Rocky Mountains.

Column VII Whitehousei ? The numbers given in 
this column are the average proportionate measurements for 
10 male paratypes, and, in parenthesis, 9 female paratypes 
of Salmo kamloops whitehousei (Dymond, 1931). 

Column VIII Kamloops s This column gives the pro¬ 
portionate measurements of one 29 inch male trout, Salmo 
kamloops Jordan (Dymond, 1932). 

Table II is used here in deciding the possible 
parental stock of the Bow River trout. 

In comparing the various cutthroats, columns II, 

III, V and VI the following observations are noted. Columns 
II, III and VI are very similar in these four characteristics. 
There is, however, a very wide variation in the lateral 
line scales. As mentioned previously, these three cutthroats 
inhabit a somewhat similar environment. The one fish used 
in Column V is definitely larger, in the four characteristics, 
than the other three types of trout. 

In comparing the rainbow data, columns IV, VII 
and VIII, both the kamloops (VIII) and kamloops whitehousei 
(VII) have decidedly greater proportionate measurements than 
irideus (IV). The former two trouts are from the western 
slopes; the latter one is from the eastern slopes of the 
Rocky Mountains. 

Comparing the Bow River trout, in light of the 
above, they appear to fall in the general range of columns 
II, III and VI for the cutthroats and column IV for the

rainbow. On the basis of scale count, column VI, alpestris , 
is eliminated from this comparison. Accordingly, columns 
II and III are used as the basis for the cutthroat and 
column IV as the basis for the rainbow. It will be noted 
that the Bow River trout are intermediate in the four char¬ 
acteristics shown. The scale count for these trout is with¬ 
in the range of the others but does not indicate any definite 
relationship to either of them. 

It was observed from the log-log plots that the 
Bow River trout tend to be more like the cutthroats for 
most of the characteristics studied. Using only males to 
eliminate the error introduced by the sexes, a comparison 
of column I with column II (males only) and column IV shows 
the above statement to apply in two of the four character¬ 
istics. In inter-orbital width and snout length, the Bow 
River trout are more similar to the rainbow than the cut¬ 
throat. It must be borne in mind, how r ever, that any definite 
conclusions are obscured by using fish of different lengths. 
No means of compensation are used in this direct compari¬ 
son. Despite this obvious error, the fact that the Bow 
River trout do take up an intermediate position does sub¬ 
stantiate the findings of the log-log plots.

The Frequency Distribution of Proportionate Measurements of 

Body Parts 

A third way of comparing the Bow River fish with 
trout of other areas is to plot frequency curves of the 
measurements of various parts of the different trouts. 
Accordingly, frequency tables of the proportionate measure¬ 
ments of head length, inter-orbital width, maxillary length 
and snout length were constructed using the following 
trout: 17 male rainbow (Bajkov, 1927), 19 Gorge Creek cut¬ 
throat, mixed males and females with a strong cut mark, 
(Andrekson, 19^9) and 66 male Bow River trout taken from 
below the Carseland dam. The other cutthroat in table II 
(column II, Spray) could not be used in the frequency dis¬ 
tribution because their numbers were too few. The four 
characters chosen for comparison are those favoured by 
Dymond (1931-32). The frequencies in the tables were con¬ 
verted to percentages to make the comparisons easier. These 
percentages have been plotted and are shown as figures 3 to 
6 . 

Snout Length . The graphs for all three types of 
trout show almost the same distribution for this character¬ 
istic. All three curves approximate normal frequency 
curves. The Bow River trout show a larger number of fish 
in the two extremes than do the cutthroat and rainbow, 
deleft (This is probably attributable to the larger number of fish 
used.^

Maxillary Length . The distribution curve for 
the rainbow shows a definitely shorter maxillary than the 
others. The largest number of fish fall in the 9.1 to 
10.0 interval in contrast with the cutthroat and Bow River 
maxima which fall into the 13*1 to 14.0 and 14.1 to 15.0 
intervals respectively. It is noted that the Bow River 
fish have a much flatter and wider distribution curve. 

This curve overlaps the larger rainbow and coincides fairly 
closely with the range of the cutthroats. A wide flattened 
curve with a tendency towards a bimodal shape is what 
might be expected from a hybrid. 

Head Length . The curves for this characteristic 
show a fairly typical unimodal shape for the cutthroat and 
the rainbow. The largest number of fish fall into the 
23.1 to 24.0 interval for both species. The Bow River fish 
show a bimodal distribution which could be reasonably 
interpreted as a hybrid tendency. The range overlaps that 
of both the cutthroats and rainboifs. The largest number 
of both these species falls between the two maxima of the 
Bow River fish. 

Inter-orbital Width . The largest number of cut¬ 
throats show a narrower inter-orbital width. The Bow River 
fish tend to be intermediate between the two suggested 
parental stocks but are more like the rainbow than the cut¬ 


throat

In conclusion, it is observed that these fre¬ 
quency distribution curves corroborate the findings oCcU/wei frowv 
table II and the log-log graphs* 

Discussion of Taxonomic Status 

Taking into consideration all the errors which 
could not be avoided, the following conclusions may be 
drawn* 

The Bow Biver trout tend to be intermediate in 
proportions for all of the taxonomic characteristics, but, 
in the majority of these characteristics, they resemble 
the cutthroat more closely than the rainbow* 

A brief resume of the conclusions from the log- 
log graphs, table II and the frequency distribution curves 
is now useful* From the head length and inter-orbital 
measurements, the only conclusion substantiated by all 
three approaches to the problem is the intermediate posi¬ 
tion, assumed by the Bow River trout* In regard to maxil¬ 
lary length, the intermediate position and the tendency to 
be more similar to the cutthroat is borne out by all three 
methods used. From the table and frequency curves, there 
is no significant difference for the snout length for the 
three trouts. 

From all these considerations it is concluded that 
the Bow River trout originated as a hybrid between the 
native cutthroat and the introduced rainbow.

In choosing Bow River fish for these computations 
the only consideration was to select a representative size 
range. The fish were then checked for the presence or 

irnt 

absence of the ®cut mark* (table BE, appendix). Of the 
2? fish used, only nine had a 1 cut mark* and yet the com¬ 
parisons show a general tendency to resemble the cutthroat 
more closely than the rainbow. The logical conclusion 
that may be drawn is that these cutthroat characteristics 
have a survival value. The cutthroat is the native trout 
in these waters and no doubt has developed certain charac¬ 
teristics which have led to their survival. Over the 
short period of time in which this suggested hybrid has 
arisen, those fish tending to be similar to the native 
cutthroats may have survived and reproduced their kind. 
Those which are more like the rainbow may have proven less 
able to survive and thus have disappeared. The cutthroat 
mark either has no survival value or, being a recessive 
character, has begun to disappear from the hybrid. It is 
admitted that the survival value of some, or all, of these 
taxonomic characteristics is unknown, but the tendency of 
the Bow River trout to retain their cutthroat characteris¬ 
tics does suggest that cutthroat properties may have a 
survival value.

GENERAL BIOLOGY OF BOW RIVER TROUT 

Some of the biological factors which are related 
to these trout will now be discussed. This is not to be 
considered a complete investigation of all the factors 
involved; only the main features which were observed while 
collecting data for the taxonomic treatment will be men¬ 
tioned. These include growth rate, spawning behaviour and 
seasonal movements, each of which will be discussed. 

Finally, a few of the management problems will be examined. 

Environmental conditions such as temperature and 
pH were observed periodically throughout the investiga¬ 
tion. The temperature of the Bow River in the area of the 
Carseland dam varied from a minimum of 46° F. on May 23 
to a maximum of 68° F. on August 1. The pH remained fairly 
constant throughout the summer, the variations being from 
7.7 to 8.2 

A series of samples of small fishes taken through¬ 
out this period are given in table III (opposite page 28). 
The minnow population appeared to be confined mainly to a 
few species. The total population during the late spring 
and summer was extremely large. The area immediately below 
the control gates of the dam was black with minnows and 
young suckers for the greater part of the season.

Growth Rate 

As this area of the Bow River was fairly heavily 
populated with good sized trout, it was decided that a 
growth rate calculation would be of considerable value 
from the point of view of management. Consequently, this 
was done and two populations seemed to be indicated: one 
above the dam and another below. The procedure and ob¬ 
servations were as follows. 

Scale samples were taken from each fish that 
was measured taxonomically. These scales were cleaned 
and mounted in glycerine jelly. For study they were pro¬ 
jected to a magnification of 55 diameters. On these mag¬ 
nified images the diameter of each scale and the diameter 
at the end of each preceding year of life was measured 
with a ruler. These measurements were possible because 
of the presence of annuli on the scales, each annulus 
being a mark on the scale caused by the cessation of growth 
in the fall followed by its resumption in the spring. 

The scales from these fish, as from all other 
trout, were very difficult to interpret accurately. A 
length-frequency and an age-frequency curve both had the 
typical unimodal distribution indicating that ail the trout 
scales were read consistently. 

The data obtained from this scale study were used 
to determine not only the age of each fish, but also to 
calculate, by proportions, the length of the fish at the

these calculations is shown in tables IV and V. The fish 
were divided into two groups, those taken below Carse- 
land dam and those above, and the two tables show these 
treated as separate populations. 

The data of tables IV and V have been used to 
plot the two growth curves shown in figure 7*

As only 31 trout were available for the above-dam 
population, compared to 101 from below the dam, a less 
regular curve was obtained for the former. 

In considering both the curves of figure 7> it 
may be observed that the growth at the end of the first and 
second years is almost the same. In the third and fourth 
years, the above-dam population growth slows down while the 
below-dam population increases gradually. Between the 
fourth and fifth year of growth, the above-dam population

overtakes the below-dam population and continues at a greater 
rate for the remaining age groups. 

The upper limits of the curves should not be inter¬ 
preted as being entirely correct. The difficulty in read¬ 
ing scales of such age groups, together with the small 
number of fish in these groups does not give a sufficiently 
accurate result. This applies particularly to the above¬ 
dam population where the number of fish is fairly small for 
all age groups. For the below-dam population, a typical 
growth curve is obtained. 

In a consideration of these growth rates, it must 
be borne in mind that tackle selectivity has influenced 
the size of the fish obtained. The majority of these trout 
was taken with casting tackle using a Len Thompson spoon 
or a flatfish. Such tackle tends to take the largest fish 
of the year classes and only fish which have actually entered 
the fishery will be taken at all. A large number of the 
smallest fish, taken below Carseland dam, were caught on 
flies. These would be the smallest fish that have entered 
the fishery. Taking into consideration these factors, it 
is apparent that the growth curves of figure 7 represent 
maximum rates. 


Spawning Behaviour 

The next factor to be discussed in the general 
biology of these trout is the interesting spawning behaviour.

The trout were observed by the writer on their spawning 
beds from the middle of May to the middle of June. None 
of these fish could be enticed to strike at any kind of 
lure or bait; consequently none of the actual spawners was 
collected and examined. The locations of the spawning 
beds are marked4- on the sketch map, figure 1. They were 
found in fast moving water on fine gravel and sand. The 
area in which the beds were located had apparently been 
cleaned of algae and slime as they showed up as bright pat¬ 
ches of gravel about six feet square. Each bed was hollowed 
out somewhat with a deep pool immediately below. Presum¬ 
ably the area was picked out and cleaned by the spawning 
pair of fish. When the female is ripe, both fish stay side 
by side, facing upstream, with just sufficient movement to 
maintain a stationary position against the action of the 
current. The female, when laying her eggs, moves her body 
violently. By flipping over on her side and thrashing about 
with her tail, she raises a cloud of sand. This action 
lasts about five to ten seconds. The male then proceeds 
in a similar manner but somewhat less violently and for a 
shorter period of time. The female repeats her activity 
every two or three minutes. 

If another trout, probably another male, attempts 
to enter this area, it is violently attacked and chased 
away by the male. The female remains on the spawning bed 
while the male is thus engaged. 







- 34 - 


It appears highly probable that each bed is used 
by more than one pair of trout. Over a period of several 
days fish were observed on the same spawning bed. Only 
one pair used these beds at the same time but, from the 
difference in sizes, it was apparent that it was not the 
same pair over the entire period. 

Eggs were recovered beneath the fine gravel on 
these beds. This was accomplished by kicking up the bottom 
and catching the material swept down below the bed in a 
net. Sucker eggs were also recovered from the material 
caught below the bed. These fish were not observed on the 
bed but had evidently spawned there sometime before the 
trout were observed. 

All the above information was obtained from areas 
below Carseland dam. At the time these trout were spawning, 
the area above the dam was unsuitable for boating due to 
the large amount of submerged debris and hidden sand bars. 
The water was high and dirty so it was impossible to locate 
any likely spawning areas at this time. Later in the 
summer, this area was investigated and a number of potential 
spawning beds were located. The area had been cleaned and 
conditions similar to the established beds prevailed. 

These potential beds are indicated by © on sketch map, 
figure 1.

Tagging Operations 

In order to gain more information of possible 
movements of these Bow River trout, a hundred of them 
were tagged during the latter part of August and the first 
part of September. Forty-four trout were tagged above 
the dam and 56 below. Table VI gives the complete record 
of the trout tagged in this area. The type of tag used 
was a body tag. A nickel pin was inserted through the 
muscle of the back below the dorsal fin. A red disk was 
attached on one side and a white one on the other. Such 
tags should be very successful as they are very conspicu¬ 
ous and readily observed by any angler. 

The purpose of this tagging operation was two¬ 
fold. Firstly, to observe any migrations and to see what 
effect the dam had on these migrations. Secondly, to esti¬ 
mate the percentage of the population taken by angling

every year. The results of this operation will not become 
apparent until, and unless, tags are returned during the 
angling season next year. 

In considering the first purpose of this tagging 
operation, it is apparent that there is no obstacle to 
prevent the free movement of the above-dam population. 

It is the opinion of the writer that the dam affords a 
complete block to any of the below-dam population attemp¬ 
ting to move upstream. The dam has a fish ladder installed 
(see figure 1), but it appears to be ineffective in 
allowing fish to move upstream over the dam. The writer 
watched trout jumping up into the waterfall over this dam 
for many hours. At no time were any fish observed getting 
into the ladder. Certainly very few, if any, could make 
the ascent if they were fortunate enough to get into the 
lower step. 

According to Miller and Macdonald (19?0) it would 
appear that the native cutthroat is non-migratory. It 
would seem reasonable from the foregoing taxonomic findings 
that these trout would tend to be non-migratory. If this 
is so, the blocking of movement by the dam is of no impor¬ 
tance from a management point of view. In support of the 
non-migratory theory, it was observed that these trout 
jumped continually, long after the usual spawning period 
was over. Also, fish were observed spawning below the 
dam and it would appear that the migratory urge was

their migration was blocked. 

The jumping of these trout was confined almost 
entirely to a period of an hour or so in the evening. 

This would indicate that the waterfall is more of a 
challenge to the trout than a biological drive induced 
by some reproductive hormone. The confirmation of these 
observations will have to await further investigation. 

The second purpose of this tagging is to obtain 
an estimate of the population taken by angling during the 
season. The percentage of the tagged fish taken will 
indicate the percentage of the total population being 
caught by anglers. The results of this part of the inves¬ 
tigation should appear after the close of the angling 
season next year. 


Management 

In the preceding sections some biological factors 
were discussed briefly in their relationship to management. 
The management problems with which this section is con¬ 
cerned are angling regulations, natural reproduction and 
pollution. 

The per diem limit for trout in this area is 15 
and the size limit is eight inches, measured from the 
snout to the centre of the tail. The effect of these 
regulations from a management point of view is beyond the

scope of this thesis. However, something may be said 
regarding regulations governing the opening and closing 
dates of the angling season. 

All fish taken in this study were sexed and the 
condition of the sex organs recorded (table VIII in 
appendix). These observations are presented in table 
VII, where they are arranged into three groups according 
to date. The first group consists of fish taken prior to 
the opening day of angling, i.e., May 10 to June 16 0 The 
second group consists of the fish taken from opening day 
in Alberta (June 16) to opening day in the National parks 
(July 1). The third group contains the fish taken after 
July 1. 

In the first group, 68.7$ of the fish were ripe 
and only 3.1$ had already spawned (spent). 9<S% were not 
yet in spawning condition. 

In Group II, 34 o 0$ were ripe in comparison with 
68.7$ in the first group. There were no unripe fish and 
bh% had spawned in comparison with 3*1% i n the first 
group. 

In the third group, only 7*7% of the fish taken 
were ripe and *+8.7$ had finished spawning.

From the above data, it would appear that to 
allow complete spawning of the trout in this area, July 1 
should be the opening day for angling. It should be noted 
that probably the water temperature in this area reaches 
a suitable spawning level before areas further north in 
the province. The later spring in the northern waters 
probably retards spawning even more than in this area.

It must be pointed out that the above findings 
are only applicable if closed season regulations are an 
important factor in the management of fisheries. The 
necessity of a closed season has never been substantiated. 

It has been only a general assumption since fisheries 
conservation regulations began. Eschmeyer (19*+7) in his 
investigations in the Tennessee Valley drainage has shown 
that a closed season during spawning is unnecessary in 
the maintenance of a good fishing population* No such 
investigations have been carried out in this province. 

A closed season may have no value for the management of 
sport fishing in Alberta. 

The next management problem to be discussed is 
that of natural reproduction. Of the 138 trout caught and 
measured, above and below the Carseland dam, 65 were males, 
62 were females and 11 were doubtful or immature. This 
being a random sampling of the population over a four months* 
period indicates a very even distribution of the sexes. An 
examination of table VIII in appendix shows that maturity 
generally occurs in the fourth year. A few of the trout 
did not mature until the fifth year and a few reached 
maturity in their third year. Providing water, food and 
spawning conditions are favourable, and this would appear 
to be so, natural reproduction should be good. 

During the late summer and early fall very 
great variations in the volume of water were observed.

These extreme variations are due to the control of the 
water at the Ghost River dam. Such a variation during 
spawning season would drastically reduce natural reproduc¬ 
tion* All the spawning beds observed were uncovered at 
times with the change in water level. Fortunately, these 
water level variations were very small during the entire 
spawning season and had no noticeable effect on natural 
reproduction. 

The very contentious question of pollution in 
the lower Bow River has been a problem of great concern 
to sportsmen for a number of years. The investigation of 
such a problem is beyond the scope of this thesis but 
cannot be altogether ignored in any studies related to 
the Bow River. It is the opinion of the author that to 
whatever the pollution may be attributed, it is not toxic 
to the trout. It is the edibility that is affected and 
to which the anglers object so strongly. During the sea¬ 
son a goodly number of these fish were eaten by the writer 
and very few had the reported ,, oily M taste. It was noted, 
however, that during the hottest part of the summer when 
the temperature of the water reached 60° F. to 68° F. (the 
maximum), the flesh became soft and unappetizing. Whether 
this was due to the warm water, or to a combination of warm 
water and pollution, the writer is unqualified to say. 

The above statements apply only to the $rea in and around 
the Carseland dam. Fifteen to twenty miles upstream towards

Calgary, fish were reported "oily" for a good part of the 
season. In this area, in some of the backwaters, an oily 
scum was observed on the surface of the water. When the 
soft bottom was walked on, the oil oozed up to the surface 
and spread out. A particularly disagreeable odour was 
present at this time. There seems to be no doubt that 
there is some pollution present but the extent and the 
cause of this pollution is unknown. That it is non-toxic

to trout seems Reasonably certain due tg) the excellent 
angling prevailing in the Bow River. 


CONCLUSION 


The main purpose of this investigation has been 
to establish the identity of the Bow River trout, wrongly 
called 1 steelhead* by the anglers who catch them. The 
principal conclusion is that they are actually hybrids 
between the introduced rainbow and the native cutthroat 
( Salmo gairdnerii x Salmo clarkii ). 

It has been difficult to reach this conclusion. 
The literature contains only a very few statements of the 
specific characteristics of the two parent stocks, and 
these few statements are not wholly satisfactory for com¬ 
parison with the Bow River data. However, every effort 
has been made to render the data comparable, and, although

some errors have doubtless persisted to obscure the pic¬ 
ture, it is felt that the evidence is strongly in support 
of the hybrid theory. 

The hybrid tends to be more similar to the cut¬ 
throat parent than to the rainbow. It is not a sterile 
hybrid as these fish are able to reproduce. Apparently 
they are non-migratory and their growth rate in the present 
environment is good. The distribution of a similar trout 
throughout the Old Man and Sheep drainages indicates that 
they will survive under the colder, less productive condi¬ 
tions that prevail in these waters. 

The hybrids combine the sporting qualities of 
the rainbow and the cutthroat and are proving to be a real 
attraction to even the most ardent anglers.
