General Statement and Object of Inyestigation . 

The Coal Industry of Alberta is having an up¬ 
hill fight in widening the markets in the provinces 
of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Western Ontario, 
The chief opposition Is due to the prejudice of the 
public of the western provinces as regards the suit¬ 
ability of the coals for various industrial and do¬ 
mestic uses, and more especially in regard to the 
weathering in storage. 

It is estimated that the province of Alberta 
contains fifteen per cent. ('**■) of the coal reserves 
of the world, and eighty per cent, of the coal re¬ 
serves in Canada, The quality of the coal varies 
from lignite to anthracite* the latter occurring 
in the mountains. It is thus clear that an unlimited 
coal supply for all varieties of purposes can be 
mined within the province, once the public realizes 
that the local coal is as good as any of the imported 
varieties and can be bought at a cheaper rate. 

The Provincial Government has authorized a

Committee of Industrial Research to further the 
mineral development of Alberta by tests and educa¬ 
tional propaganda based on the results of the tests. 

It is the purpose, then, of these investigations to 
determine the properties of Alberta coals and espe¬ 
cially to discover suitable means of storage which 
will enable the coal operators of the province to 
ship coal to outside points during the summer when 
both the coal mines and railways have their slack 
season. This will have the desired effect of equaliz¬ 
ing the mining industry throughout the year, to the 
undoubted benefit of both operator and mine-worker, 
besides providing increased traffic for the railways 
during the present slack season. 

Some mines use grizzly, or bar screens, and 
others perforated plate screens, and no data are 
available as to the equivalency of the two. As a 
consequence confusion exists between producer and con¬ 
sumer in regard to what is meant by the present list 
of sizes supplied. Work is being done to get a 
standard equivalency for these different styles of 
screens, and some suggestions in this regard are 
embodied in this report.

Technical Staff . 

The coal screening,storage and equivalency 
tests have been carried out by Mr. R. T. Hollies, 
B.Sc., assisted by Mr. T. Holmes, in the Mining 
Engineering Building. 

The chemical analyses, including the heat 
value of the coals, were done by Mr. R. T. Hollies, 

B. Sc., under the supervision of Mr. J. A. Melso, 

M. Sc., Director of the Provincial Industrial Labora¬ 
tories. 

The boiler trials were conducted by Professor 

C. A. Robb, M.Sc., Associate Professor of Mechanical 
Engineering, assisted by Mr. H. A. McMillan, Chief 
Engineer, University Power Plant and by Mr. R. T. 
Hollies, B.Sc., 

Professor N. C. Pitcher, M.Sc., Professor of 
Mining Engineering, University of Alberta, has super¬ 
vision of all investigations. 

Acknowledgements . 

The coal research was not commenced until 
after the beginning of the present (1920-21) ses¬ 
sion of the University. Many unforseen difficul¬ 
ties were encountered in organizing and carrying 
out the investigations ; these were overcome by 
the writer chiefly through the co-operation and

kindly advice freely given by the staff of the 
Department of Mining Engineering and by members of 
other departments* 

The writer wishes to acknowledge the capable 
assistance rendered by Mr. T. Holmes in carrying 
out the screening, sampling and sorting tests. 
Professor N. C. Pitcher, M.Sc., Professor of 
Mining Engineering, has kindly offered many help¬ 
ful suggestions and by his keen interest in the work 
has very materially assisted the writer in getting 
results. Professor A. E. Cameron, M.Sc., Associate 
Professor of Mining Engineering, has always been 
ready to render valuable assistance and advice 
during the entire investigation. Acknowledge¬ 
ment is also due Mr. J. A. Eelso, M. Sc., Provincial 
Analyst,for his valuable advice and kindly criti¬ 
cism in the chemical work. 

Laboratories . 

(a) The screening is done on a shaker screen 
(see figure 1, next page) purchased from Messrs. 
Donkin and Stevens, of Edmonton, and placed in the 
University Mining laboratory. Difficulty in getting 
the machinery ready in the fall of 1920 prevented 






6 


as early a start as was planned. It was not until 
November 8th that the first part of car load of coal 
was received. When this lot of coal was disposed 
of, difficulty was again encountered in getting the 
next lot of coal, due to a local coal miners’ strike 
tying up the mines from which the coal had been 
promised. This second lot ms not received until 
December 15th.

Description of Storage Facilities . 

Each size of each sample of coal is stored 
in half ton and one ton lots in the open, in pits 
and in shed respectively® The following is a rough 
description of the storage facilities: 

1® Open Storage .(See figure 2, previous page*) 


Dig, 3®-=- East Side of Storage Shed with Lids of 
Two Storage Pits in Foreground, 

Adjacent to and west of the storage shed described 
below an area 40 feet square has been cleared of 
opplar and underbrush on the ground for half ton and 
one ton lots of the different sizes of the different 
samples, no precautions being taken to insure drain¬ 
age, to protect the stored coal from the weather or 
to prevent the coal being mixed with dirt when 




























9 



removed for sampling and testing after storage. 

2. Pit Storage .-- (See figure 4.) Adjacent to 
and east of the storage shed are the storage pits. 
3ach is 20’ long, wide at the top and 4' wide 

at the bottom and 3 1 


deep. They are lined 
with poplar poles 
and divided into com- 
pa rtme nt s 5 T 6 M x 6 T 
at the top and 4 T 
x 6 T at the bottom 
and 3 T deep. These 
pits are of ample 
size to store 1 ton 
samples. The bot¬ 
tom is of clay, 
levelled and tamped 
hard, and affords 
a clean surface on 
which to dump the 
coal. The pits 
are well covered 
by tightly fitting

to keep out the rain and snow, and, if necessary, 
these can be covered by sods to maintain an even 
temperature in the pits. 

3. died storage .-- (3ee figure 3, page 8) 

The shed is built of 2" x 4 TfI s and 1” shiplap with a 
tight tar-paper roof. It is 25 ? long, 9 ? wide and 
8 7 high with a shanty roof, but has no floor. The 
shed is divided into six bins 4 ! x 9 7 , and each of 
these can be further divided into three compartments 
4 7 x 3 1 capable of storing one ton samples. Each 
bin has a 2* x 8’ opening, which can be boarded up 
as filled. Figure 4 shows five bins boarded up, 
the fourth from the right being open. The shed is 
not completely weather-tight, but is capable of 
keeping out rain and snow and direct sunlight.

and purifying apparatus to allow these tests to 
be made.

the various districts, and at the same time a record 
kept which showed what the percentage of each of 
the above was in the different Runs of Mine. 

4. Goals as received. Ash analyses were made 
of each size. 

5. While doing the above screening, a test 
was re-run on the different sizes to determine the 
amount of breakage made in the handling of the coal; 
that is, after having determined the proportions of 
lump, egg, etc., in a certain kind of run of mine, 
these different grades were then re-screened separ¬ 
ately, the results obtained sho?/ing how much break¬ 
age the coal undergoes in being handled over the 
screens. 


6, Having separated the coal into different 
sizes, samples of Run of Mine, Lump, Egg, Nut and 
Pea were next set aside for testing each in open 
storage, shed storage and pit storage, using the 
fo1lowing quantities:

The above samples are to be screened and re-ana¬ 
lyzed at the end of one month, six months, one year 
and two years to determine slacking, losses in size 
and change in chemical composition, as well as heat 
value. Bituminous coals, Bun of Mine, are only 
stored in open storage and chamical analysis taken 
at the end of first month, sixth month, one year 
and two years. 

7. Evaporation tests under Babcock & Wilcox 
Boilers, both hand and stoker fired, on different 
sizes of coal.

SUMMARY aid conclusions . 

Object of Investigations. 

The purpose of Screening and Storage tests as 
carried out by the writer is to further the development 
of the coal industry of the Province of Alberta, and 
to enable the replacement of imported coals in Western 
Canada by the Alberta product. 

The work is being carried out at the University 
of Alberta under the authority of the Provincial Govern¬ 
ment and the tests to date are designed to determine the 
following points; 

1. Equivalency tests to standardize the relation¬ 
ship between bar and perforated screens as applied on 
Alberta coal. No data has been available on this 
point prior to these investigations. 

2. Storage tests to evolve a practical method of 
storage for the easily disintegrated Alberta coals to 
enable shipping and storing during slack seasons^of the 
year in the mine, and to permit a wider distribution of 
the coal. 

3. Boiler Trials to assist in determining the best 
method of utilizing these fuels.

Screening Tests , 

The screening tests are included under these 
separate headings: 

(a) Equivalency tests, the results of which are 
graphically pictured in chart no, 4, The Pembina coal 
(curve C.) gave remarkable results in that the spacing 
of the bar screens is two-thirds the diameter of the 
perforations of the plates to produce the same weight 
of screened coal. This curve G is very close to an 
average of those of the other three coals e These 
figures apply to Edmonton Domestic coals, 

(b) Percentages of Sizes in Run of Mine, the 
results of which are given in chart no, 5, The high 
percentage of screened coal (lump plus egg) is desir¬ 
able in Domestic coals, but not necessarily so in 
Steam coals(Cadomin,) 

(c) Breakage losses due to Screening and Rehandling, 
are summed up in chart no. 6. Little can be attached 

to these results as yet, due to the appreciable 
disintegration of the coals in the dry, steam-heated 
Mining Laboratory while waiting between screening and 
later tests. It shows, though, the higher loss on the 
weaker or higher moisture coals. 




17 1 

Storage » 

Proper means of storage can only be attained 
after a properly directed study and series of experi¬ 
ments have been conducted on the coals which are to 
be stored. The present tests are conducted on very 
small lots and the writer would recommend the coal 
operators to carry on open storage tests of their 
own on larger piles of coal than are possible in the 
tests conducted at the University. Charts 7, 8 and 9 
show results of storage on local Domestic coals over 
a short period of time. The following conclusions 
are temporarily presented in the light of these 
results, 

1. Greater disintegration occurs as a result of 
the Wetting, drying and freezing of spring v/eather as 
compared to the cold, even temperature of winter. (See 
chart 9, and compare the greater deterioration in Twin 
City coal over Humberstone.) 

2. Shed storage shows less disiintegration than 
open or pit storage in nearly every case. The chemical 
analysis and calorific value show little change in 

the first two months of shed storage, but show a 
slight depreciation in open and pit storage. 

3. The smaller sizes of screened coal show much less 

























18 


deterioration and weakening than the larger. 

4. Ash shows higher percentage in sr® ller sizes 
of ooal. 


Boiler Trials, 


Charts 21 and 21a are plotted from the table 
below of important results of Boiler Trials* On 
page 49 is given a list of coals tested, and date 
of trials. Most of the coal was tested within a short 
time after mining.

Lefinition . 

Sampling is the process of reducing the size 
of an original lot of ore to a conveniently small 
representative portion suitable for chemical 
analysis and other tests. 

Need of Care in Sampling . 

On page 30 is given a table showing the num¬ 
bering of samples required from one coal. This 
table shows the large number of samples that are 
required in these tests, and as a large portion of 
the time required in the laboratory work was spent 
in sampling its importance then in these investi¬ 
gations should be clear. 

The technically-trained man is apt to overlook 
the fact that the average person not so trained is 
usually entirely ignorant of the need of care in 
sampling. This fact, however, has been forcibly 
brought to the writer’s notice in recent months in 
the associations in the Provincial Industrial Labor¬ 
atories, where, daily, samples of ore and coal 
are received which are not representative, but are 
picked samples, and consequently when analyzed not 
only give an incorrect estimation of the ore body 










20 . 

or seam from which they have "been taken, but are 
also extremely misleading because they indicate a 
very much richer prospect than is actually the case. 
The analysis made on these samples may be as accur¬ 
ate as possible, but yet have no real value for the 
purpose of determining the average quality of the 
ore body or seam from which they have been taken. 

The accuracy of the sampling should be within the 
accuracy possible in the chemical analysis, (-*-) 

The Process of Sampling . 

The following summary of sampling is for the most 
part taken from the publications of the U, 3. Bureau 

O 

of Mines (^),to which the writer has been chiefly 
indebted for guidance in this respect. 

The gross sample has usually been obtained by 
taking portions of the mass as the coal is being 
transferred from one carrier to another, the Run 
of Mine sample being collected by shovelfuls as the 
coal was being unloaded at the Mining Laboratory 
and University Power Plant,Ho. 2, from waggons.

The screened coal samples were set aside as the coal 
was being handled over the screens. The reduction 
of the gross sample consisted of crushing, mixing, 
coning and quartering as outlined very clearly in 
figure 5 (see next page } taken from a report 

of the U. S. Bureau of Mines f' 5 -), Figure 6 shows

of size only is retained. This sample is then 
weighed and air-dried for twenty-four hours at 
room temperature. The loss on air-drying being ob¬ 
tained, the sample is further crushed and reduced, 
and then finally ground to about 80 mesh in a pul¬ 
verizer, about 50 grams of the pulverized coal being 
quickly put in an air-tight glass bottle and labelled* 
(See Table, page 3Q,for numbering.) The air-drying 
has the twofold purpose of, firstly, allowing the 
coal to be in a dry enough state for grinding, and, 
secondly, reducing the danger of losses In moisture 
due to pulverizing and subsequent re-handling. 





SCREENING TESTS. 


INTRODUCTIO N. 

Confusion exists between the producer and con¬ 
sumer regarding the sizing and qualities of Alberta 
coals. It is the purpose then of these screening 
tests to first screen the coal into standard sizes 
according to the table as given on page 13, item 2, 
and, secondly, to determine the equivalency of the 
bar screens in terms of the standard perforated 
screens. It may be pointed out that different coals 

will not have the same equivalency, due to coals 

Vo 

in different localities naturally disintegrating 
into differently shaped blocks. For example, the 
local (Edmonton) Domestic coal forms almost perfect 
cubes, while the coals from the Kootenay formation 
in southern Alberta break into rectangular flat 
pieces which would give a larger percentage through 
the bar screens of the same spacing as used on the 
local Domestic coal. Results are thus reported 
for each district. 

Carload lots of each sample of coal have been 
received which give approximately for each test

the amounts indicated on the flow sheet, page 29, 
The present capacities of the laboratories, power 
plant and storage facilities are taxed to the ut¬ 
most to handle efficiently these amounts, but it 
is felt by the Mining Engineering staff that coal 
in smaller lots would not permit results of a

practical nature to be ascertained. 

Description of Screening Operations . 

The screening is being done over a small 

Marcus shaker screen (see figures 1 and 7.), and 

the process is as follows: 

Approximately thirteen tons of run of mine 

























25 t 


are unloaded in the Mining Engineering building. 

A sample for chemical analysis is taken of this 
by saving a shovelful at intervals as the coal 
is unloaded. The gross sample of some 500 lbs. 
thus obtained is crushed, coned and quartered as 
explained under sampling above (see page 21 ). 

Ten tons is then weighed and screened by barrow 
loads in the following manner: 

Each barrow loaded is weighed and screened

The lump is over size and is collected in a wheel¬ 
barrow and weighed. The Egg coal, (over 1-g-” and 
through 3") is collected in a box and weighed, 
as is the Nut Slack (through 1-|- TT perforations). 

The latter is set aside for re-screening as out¬ 
lined below.

Luring screening care is taken to get an aver¬ 
age sample of each size so obtained for chemical 
analysis. This is done by saving a. small portion 
of each product after the screening of each wheel¬ 
barrow load. The gross sample is then crushed, 
coned and quartered in the usual manner. (See 
figure 8 for piles of screened coal and collected 
sample in boxes adjacent to respective sizef follow¬ 
ing page.) 

The screened coal is then weighed out in half 
ton lots and placed in storage. (See figures 1, 2 
and 3 above.) The flow sheet and explanatory 
table (See pages 29 and 30 .) show the quantities 
of different sizes and sample number for each such 
storage lot. 

The breakage losses due to screening and hand¬ 
ling are then determined by screening a half ton

a 200 lbs. loss of lump on 1000 lbs. , or a 20 per

Conclusions on Screen!ng Tests , 


As is pointed out in the case of Pembina coal 
the required spacing for bar screens to approximately 
produce the same percentage by weight of sized coal as 
from the perforated plates is two-thirds the diameter 
of the perforations* Por example, a 2 T? spaced bar 
screen is equivalent to a 5’ T perforated plate* This 
in general applies to all four coals tested above, 

(3ee chart no, 4.) 

There is little to be inferred from the results 
on item fb) -- percentages of standard sizes in 
Run of Mine -- (See also chart no, 5) except that a 
higher percentage of screened coal indicates an 
increased desirability of that coal for domestic 
purposes, due to the fact that the highest price 
is paid for the larger sizes. 

The first coal tested above has only 30,4 fo 
screened coal, which would make it difficult for 
that coal to compete with the fourth coal tested 
for domestic purposes, This does not mean, however, 
that the former coal is inferior for other purposes, 
it being a high grade bituminous coking coal and an 
excellent steam coal. (See chart no. 20 of Boiler 
Trial B-12.) 

Prom a comparison of the breakage losses due

to screening (See chart No. 6) the relative strength 
of the various coals could he roughly estimated, 
for example the first and fourth samples tested 
show less percentage breakage loss, so it is fairly 
safe to assume that these two coals would stand 
shipment by rail to better advantage than the other 
two coals. Drying out of the high moisture Domestic 
coals has a very great tendency to render the lumps 
tender, as is evidenced by the screening tests on 
Humberstone Hgg before and after storing.(See chart 
no. 9) The breakage losses due to rehandling and 
rescreening were taken on coal stored in the Mining 
Laboratory for a few days, and show that the coal 
is broken up much more by drying out for a few days 
than by open or other storage for a few weeks. After 
this experience with screening losses the effort has 
been made to store the coal and get the breakage 
loss as soon as the coal is screened, with much better 
effect, as can be seen by comparing Humberstone and 
Twin-City coals. (See chart no, 9)

Review of Previous InvestigatIons .( x )( ) 

The writer wishes to call attention to a recent 
work (-*-) published by the University of Illinois on 
"Bituminous Goal Storage Practice. " This work was 
published as a result of the coal shortage in the 
United States during the winter of 1917-18, when in 
time of stress lack of stored coal was a serious 
matter, and when improperly stored coal gave con¬ 
siderable trouble due to spontaneous combustion; most 
of which could have been avoided were proper precau¬ 
tions taken in storing. This is a valuable report 
in that it includes a review of the practice as 
carried out by over five hundred indi vi duals, manu¬ 
facturing concerns, railroads, coke plants and power 
plants, who stored coal under widely different con- 
diti ons. 

To apply the conclusions reached by Stoek, Hippard, 

and Langtry to our particular problem in Alberta it is 

f 1 } Stoek,H.H., Hippard, 0. W. and Langtry W. I). : "Bitu¬ 
minous Coal Storage Practice,” Bulletin Ho. 116, Eng..

Canada, Extra Vol. Heport 35, 1915.

necessary to state that there are three essentials 
lacking in the present coal industry of this Province: 

1. The usual heavy shipments of coal in the fall 
of the year occur when every available freight car 

is needed to move grain. This congestion of traffic 
prevents an adequate steady supply of coal to con¬ 
sumers in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Western 
Ontario, the natural market for Alberta coal, 

2. Production as it is now is spasmodic and 
uncertain, many mines only running part of the year, 

3. The market for Alberta coal is now just 
beginning to be extended to eastern points, and is 
waiting on education and knowledge of methods of 
storing Alberta coal. Proper storing then would 
enable the coals to be shipped during the slack 
season of the railways and enable the mines to remain 
open the year around, to the undoubted benefit of 
operator, miner and railways, as well as ensuring 

the consumer of a normal supply of fuel. 

The following points should be noted before 
anyone attempts to store coal in large quantities, 
though for household use, etc. , they are not important. 
1. Have suitable place prepared for storage by 




































39 


attending to drainage, leveling of ground to avoid 
dirt in reclaiming. Avoid storing next to fences, 
chimney stacks, refuse, hot walls or above flues.(^} 

A slight rise in temperature is followed by a much 
greater increase in the danger of spontaneous com¬ 
bustion. 

2, Store the coal between the 1st of May and 
the 1st of September to avoid difficulties of trans¬ 
portation, and to equalize the mining industry, care 
being taken to combat the heating of the coal if 
stored at a high temperature. 

3. Fine coal. Mine Run, etc., should be stored 
in low piles. 

4. Sulphur in Alberta coals ranges from 0.2 p to 
ifo ( 2 ) and very seldom above 0.6 °Jo. This small amount 
would not be likely to affect storing, 

5, Glean screened coal should be stored in 

accessible piles, any part of which can be removed in 
case of overheating,! i Conical piles are dangerous 
since the fine coal tends to segregate in the centre_

40 


causing excessive ventilation through the outside of 
the pile and insufficient ventilation through the fine 
coal at the centre, a condition very likely to produce 
spontaneous combustion. 

6. Repeated wetting and drying considerably increases 
the disintegration of the coal, as has been noted in the 
case of the high moisture coals.(See page 36J This pro¬ 
duces more fines and so increases liability to spontane¬ 
ous combustion. 

7. Great care should be taken to keep the stored 
coal free from such inflammable material as waste, paper, 
rags, wood, tar and oil. These form the nucleus, usually, 
from which fires start. 

8. The more coal stored in one place, the greater 
the need of attention to the above points in storing, 
care being especially taken for the first few weeks 

of storage. Porter {^) says that, in addition to the 
above precautions, individual coals must be individually 
studied in order to reach a practical method of safe 
storing. He also advises the use of hollow/ iron pipes 
driven into the pile at intervals in which to insert 
thermometers to watch the rise intemperature due to the 
heating of the coal,

Conclusions . 

The tests outlined have not been carried out for 
a sufficient length of time to allow any definite 
conclusions to be drawn. The Humberstone storage 
period was during the winter season and shows much 
less disintegration than in the case of Twin City 
coal whose period of storage included a great range 
of temperature and exposure to much rain.and snow 
followed by a harmful drying out, freezing and thawing. 

The following tentative conclusions are drawn 
from the inspection of the above-mentioned charts, 

1. Winter storage has less effect on Domestic 
coal than the more marked effect due to the wetting 
and drying and freezing of variable spring weather. 

2. Shed storage shows less disintegration than 
open or pit storage, and practically no change in 
chemical analysis. 

3. Ash is usually higher in the smaller sized 

coal. 

4. The smaller sizes of screened coal show much 
less deterioration than the larger sizes.

b Q ± ±j E H 4 R I A L G . 

Hitherto most of the Boiler Trials conducted 
on Alberta coals have been done at Ottawa {^) at 
the Dominion Government Fuel Testing Station,or at 
McGill University.( 1 2 ) The coals so tested had to 
be shipped several thousand miles by rail and undergo 
frequent handling and delays. The coal so tested was 
thus greatly handicapped in obtaining a fair trial in 
comparison with imported and Eastern coals. The 
Boiler Trials conducted here as a part of the "Prelim¬ 
inary Investigations of Alberta Goals" have been made 
.on coal shipped directly from the tipple to the Uni¬ 
versity Bunker, where it has seldom been stored more 
than a week or two before being given trial under 
hand-fired and stoker-fired boilers. The results 
are therefore based on conditions similar to those 
within reasonable rail distance of the pit-heads, 

. rz 

and should show a comparison of these coals. { )

Charts 21 and 21a are a comparison of seven important 
results of boiler trials. Charts 14 to 20 inclusive s 
show the details of readings during the trials. 

The trials lasted for 8 hours and were made at the 
University of Alberta Power Plant No. 2, Edmonton. 

The type of boilers used was Babcock and Wilcox Water
