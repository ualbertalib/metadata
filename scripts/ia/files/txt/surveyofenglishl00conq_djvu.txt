SYNOPylb 


This thesis consists of a study of the achieveraent 
in language of a group of 94? grade IV pupils and 927 grade 
VII pupils, selected by a method of stratified random sam¬ 
pling from the school children of the Province of Alberta* 
The testing instrument used was the California 
ifilementary Language Test, Porm AA, and the California Inter¬ 
mediate Language Test, Porm AA.^ 

A digest of related language surveys which have been 
conducted in Alberta schools during the years 1934 to 1930 
has been included in chapter II. 

Special reference is made in Chapter III to the 1934 
Achievement Survey conducted by the Faculty of Education 
Committee on educational Kesearch. This comprehensive study 
includes the Language Survey in grades IV and VII described 
in this thesis, as well as surveys of mental ability, read¬ 
ing achievement, and a qualitative analysis of original com¬ 
positions written by the same group of pupils. 

The main body of this thesis consists of a record 
and analysis of the data obtained by the sample on the sub¬ 
tests of the California ii.lementary Language Test, and the 
California Intermediate Language Test. These tests include: 
Mechanics of English and Grranmar, Spelling, and Total

Language. Each of these measurements is expressed both as 
a raw score and as a grade placement. The Mechanics of 
iSngiish and Uramroar test consists of the sub-tests: Uapi- 
talization, Punctuation, lords and Sentences, and Parts of 
Speech. 

Means, medians and percentiles are given for the 
achievement of the Alberta sample in grades IV and vTI 
and comparisons are made with the norms provided in the 
Manual. 

Corrected estimates of the means of the Alberta 
Grade IV and Grade VII population have been determined from 
the sample means and from Provincial school enrolment totals 
of the Department of Education. 

Chapter VII gives a brief summary of the conclusions 
of the investigation.

mE PROBLEM 

!• The Need for Research in Language 

Por a number of years the elementary and junior high 
schools of Alberta have benefitted from the research done in 
the fields of mental ability, reading and arithmetic* These 
investigations have modified teaching methods and provided 
many standardized tests to determine pupil ability and 
achievement* Yet, in the important field of language, 
research has lagged* 

On the cumulative records of the pupils of this 
province, entries will be found of the results of standar¬ 
dized testing in mental ability, reading, spelling, and 
arithmetic, but few entries resulting from the use of stan¬ 
dardized tests of achievement in language* 

It was to assist in determining the general level 
of language ability of grade four and grade seven pupils 
that the present investigation was undertaken* 

2* The Revised Alberta Language Programme Remands Research 

One of the achievements emerging from the sustained 
revision of the Alberta School Gurriculum is a new emphasis

on language teaching* iiinglish Language, which for years had 
been the Ginderella subject of the curriculum, has now been 
given about twenty percent more teaching time than formerly. 
New language text books have been provided which give a fresh 
approach to language teaching based upon the results of 
modern research. 

Growing out of such studies as that conducted by the 
Commission on the English Curriculum for the National Council 
of Teachers of English, there has come a shift in emphasis in 
the teaching of language* The traditional language courses 
had a sequence of topics keyed to the formal analysis of sen¬ 
tences and paragraphs* The revised language curriculum now 
stresses the functional use of language for boys and girls 
who mature in social situations* iwhile all subjects, to some 
extent, offer opportunity for this language development, the 
specific responsibility for growth in language power has been 
given to the teachers of the Enterprise in the elementary 
school and to those of Social studies in the junior high 
school. In their group activities and reports there is wide 
scope for the functional development of the language skills. 

Teachers in the upper grades need specific informa¬ 
tion about the preparation their pupils have received in the 
lower grades* Junior high school language teachers will be 
more effective, if, early in the term, they can determine 
each pupil’s language ability by using a good diagnostic

testing instrument. The 1934 Survey of Achievement in 
Language was designed to gather data and to assess the 
language ability of grade I? and grade Vil pupils in Alberta. 
It is hoped that this research will be of assistance to 
language teachers. 

3* The New Amphasis Upon Evaluation Demands Research 

when language teaching was predicated upon the be¬ 
lief in formal discipline, memorization of rules, and the 
efficacy of mechanical drill, evaluation was all too often 
associated with the amount of red ink used on essays. But 
associated with the trend in education to place a greater 
emphasis upon listening, speaking, reading, and writing, 
there came also a greater interest in the measurement of 
these associated skills. Measurement of language ability 
on this broader base is one aspect of language evaluation. 

Evaluation could be considered as an assessment, 
shared by the pupil and teacher, of the pupil’s present 
position in relation to the ground already gained and the 
goals ahead. It involves a recognition of values which may 
be used to modify the process and even to alter the goals 
themselves. Here is a statement by W. Cook in the 43rd 
Year Book of the N.S.S.S., Part II, caching Language in 
the Elementary bchool .” 


The term evaluation used here implies that

certain values have been accepted (in the language- 
arts these values are clearly defined types of 
language behaviour), and that the language behaviour 
of the individual or group is judged or appraised in 
terms of these values.^ 

And again in the Alberta Junior High School Curriculum 
Guide for Social Studies-Language, 19^3 edition, pages 31, 32, 

Evaluation should be continuous , informal . (with 
perhaps formal check periods at intervals deten^ned 
by the teacher) and cooperative (with both teacher and 
student discussing needs, achievement and progress). 

What students need to know is where their strengths 
and weaknesses lie.-^ 

The present investigation has determined achievement 
levels of samples of grade IT and VII pupils in the language 
skills measured by the California Language Tests* Such infor¬ 
mation should be helpful to teachers who find the need of a 
diagnostic instrument in language evaluation. 








CHAPTER II 


RELATED STUDIES IN ALBERTA EDUCATION 
1# Provincial Norms in Alberta 

School authorities in Alberta have seldom adminis¬ 
tered achievement tests on a provincial basis below grade 
IX* This has meant that in grades I to VIII achiev^ent 
testing has become the responsibility of local educational 
authorities* Out of this situation the cities and many school 
divisions have developed some worthwhile testing programmes* 
However, the establishing of provincial norms of attainment 
in subject areas has not been possible to any extent below 
grade IX. 

The final examinations in grade IX have provided 
data from which the Department of Education annually estab¬ 
lished grade IX provincial levels of attainment in reading 
and in mental ability* The provincial norms in these two 
areas have been of great assistance to teachers and coun¬ 
selors in the senior high schools* 

The following three major studies related to achieve¬ 
ment in language of Alberta school children have each made a 
contribution to the research in the area investigated in 
this thesis*

2. Language Surveys in Alberta Schools, 1934-19^4. 

i* "The Study of Written Language Errors of 1238 Pupils 
of Ukrainian Origin.” Claude Hill Robinson, B.Ed. 
Thesis, 1934.^ 

The purpose of this investigation ns as to laeasure the 
effect of a non-English home life upon the written language 
of a large sample of Alberta pupils. Twelve hundred and 
thirty-eight children of Ukrainian parents were asked to 
write a letter upon a given topic. A control group of chil¬ 
dren of Anglo-Saxon parents was given the same task. The 
errors in formal grammar and expression were then counted 
and the number and percentage of each type of error computed. 
The errors recorded involved verbs, adjectives, prepositions, 
adverbs, conjunctions, pronouns, objects, agreement, number, 
negations, arrangements and clumsy expressions. 

In comparing the language ability of the Ukrainian 
children in the sample with that of the control group it was 
found that the children of Ukrainian parents were definitely 
handicapped in their ability to use the English language. 

It is noted that the 1^34 Survey of Achievement in 
language conducted by the Education Research Committee has 
produced data from a sample of I 87 O pupils in grades IV and 
VII which is amenable to treatment similar to that described 


above

inclusive were examined by means of a test designed by the 
author. The following statistics were determined for each 
grade; means, standard deviations, medians, the q^uartiles, 
and the range. Graphs were drawn to describe the distribu¬ 
tions and to represent how effective the test was as an 
instrument of measurement. 

The conclusion reached by the author was that 

From the nature of the statistical data presented in 
this chapter, it would appear that a definite rela¬ 
tionship between ability to perceive grammatical re¬ 
lationships, on the one hand, and ability in written 
prose composition or prose appreciation on the other 
hand, h^ been shown to exist in certain high school 
grades.o 

The studies by G. H. Robinson and J. W. Chalmers are 
of direct importance to this investigation and to the 1934 
Survey of Achievement in Language. Both, by means of an 
analysis of samples of original composition, attempted to 
measure the pupil’s ability in written language. In both 
cases the analysis compared the pupil’s freedom from gram¬ 
matical and usage errors with his power of expressing ideas 
in pleasing and forthright language.

surveys in ^berta educational history was conducted on be¬ 
half of the Alberta Teachers* Association by Dr. G. Sansom. 
This investigation was started in 1^45 and continued each 
year until 19^0* Over two thousand pupils in grade X were 
tested each September with the same survey tests in Vocabu¬ 
lary, English Usage, Science, Mathematics, and Social 
Studies* 

while the major purpose of the survey was to deter¬ 
mine the quality of preparation pupils were receiving for 
entrance into high school, from the wealth of data available, 
Dr. Sansom was able to study many phases of elementary edu¬ 
cation such as sex differences in subject achievement, and 
to compare results for city, town and country children. In 
addition he was able to report trends in achievement through¬ 
out the six years from 1943 to 1948 inclusive. 

The reports of the Grade X Survey are to be found in 
the following A.T.A. Magazines: July 1944; November 1943; 
September, October 1947; June 1948; June 1949; and June 19^0. 
Some of the findings of Dr. Sansom’s six-year study summa¬ 
rized in the June 1990 edition of the magazine which are 
pertinent to this thesis are as follows: 

Sex Differences . ”Girls were definitely superior to boys in 
English Usage ... In Vocabulary and in Mathematics there was 
no difference.” 

Subject Areas . ”The results in Vocabulary, comparing one

year’s results with another were always not significant* 
Improvement in English was general, with a small setback in 
1943 due possibility to chance. In 194? the critical ratios 
of the difference from 1943 rose well above the required 
three to establish certainty.” 

Country. 'Iown> and Gity Pupils’ Achievement . ’’In each case 
in 1944 the city results were higher than the results of 
both the towns and the country, with the towns’ results 
being nearer to the country than to the cities. The cities 
were well out in the lead of the 17 towns included in the 
test.” Elis last statement appeared in the November 1943 
issue of the A.T.A. Magazine. It is of interest to this 
study to observe, that after this initial comparison of 
achievement by local areas had been made, that this aspect 
of the survey was discontinued. All other phases of the 
original investigation were studied for the full six-year 
period. Possibly, Dr. ©ansom found that these comparisons 
were not in the best interest of education in the Province. 
Trends in the Grade X Purvey. 1943 to 1930 . ”The most im¬ 
pressive fact that emerges from all these statistics is the 
steadiness of elementary education in Alberta..The general 
tendency was upward, if anything, though most of the changes 
(in subject areas of achievement) were small. Whether the 
absolute standing in these five fields of the students enter¬ 
ing senior high school is as good as it ought to be is

another question. But in the matter of trends, the study, 
in spite of all its limitations, should put us on our guard 
against proclaiming with too much confidence that the groun¬ 
ding of students entering high school today is very much 
poorer, if at all, than it was in years gone by. There 
seems to be a sort of halo around the past that beatifies 
conditions which were in point of fact often no better than 
they are today. 


3* Summary of Related Studies 

The investigations by C. H. Robinson and J. 

Chalmers consisted of an analysis of errors in the mechanics 
of English and grammar found in samples of original composi¬ 
tions written by pupils. Dr. G. Sansom^s survey compared 
the achievement of pupils in English Usage and Vocabulary. 

The areas of study of these three investigations and their 
method of procedure paralleled that of the 1^34 Survey of 
Achievement in Language. 

The conclusions reached in the three studies that 
are applicable to the present study are as follows: 

1. Pupils from non-English homes (Ukrainian) are handicapped 
in their ability to use the English language. (Robinson) 
2m The ability of pupils to write effectively and their 
ability to write correctly are related. (Chalmers) 

3. (a) The ability of girls in English Usage is superior to

CHAPTER III 


THE EXPERIi^iEm^AL DESIGN 
1 . The Administration of the Tests 

Over two thousand pupils in selected grade four and 
grade seven classrooms were given the California Elauentary 
Language Test, Form A4, or the California Intermediate 
Language Test, Form AA. 

The tests were scored according to the key and manual 
of instructions. Results were checked as carefully as possi¬ 
ble. 

A data assembly card was completed for each pupil 
which listed the following inf'ormation: 

(a) The name, sex, age, grade, school, city, town 
or village,^ and the languages spoken at home. 

(b) The raw scores of each sub-test. 

A set of data assembly sheets recording this infor¬ 
mation w'as completed for each participating classroom. 

The language survey described in this thesis is part 
of the larger 1^^4 Achievement Survey of the Faculty of Edu¬ 
cation Research Committee. Not only were the pupils tested 
in language, but they were also tested in mental ability, 
reading, spelling, handwriting, and original composition. 

A Note^Although over two thousand pupils were tested, after 
withdrawing papers which were incomplete or not 
required for the random sample, the final number 
of students was I 876 as shown in Table I.

The grade four and grade seven sample was drawn as 
follows. The province was divided into eight areas on the 
basis of location, economic conditions, and racial origin 
of the population. 

Eight towns, one from each area, were randomly selec¬ 
ted from towns having a resident school population between 
230 and 1000. 

The graded rural and ungraded rural samples drawn 
from each of the eight areas were roughly proportional to 
the total school population in these areas: e.g, if 12> of 
the graded and ungraded rural school population lived in a 
selected area, then 12> of the sample was drawn from that 
particular area# 

In order to make a valid comparison between the 
achievement in graded and ungraded rural schools, only chil¬ 
dren actually resident in rural areas and in attendance in 
graded rural schools were used in the sample. 

All the pupils in each classroom were tested, so 
that there would be no opportunity for choosing only superior 
pupils. Surplus papers were withdrawn randomly before the 
tests were scored. With these precautions it was hoped to 
satisfy the criterion of randomness, namely, that every indi¬ 
vidual in the population under study should have the same 
probability of being chosen in the sample.

3* Procedure Used in the Treatment of JJata 

Means, standard deviations, standard errors, and per¬ 
centiles were detemined for the grade four and grade seven 
sample for each sub-test of the California iiilementary Lang¬ 
uage Test, Porm AA, and the California Intermediate Language 
Test, Poim AA. Ko pupils from Separate or private schools 
were included in the sample. A best estimate of means was 
obtained for the Alberta population of grade IT and grade vTl 
pupils through a correction of sample means in terms of the 
true grade IT and grade vll population reported by the depart¬ 


ment of Education

GHAPTiiiR IV 


THE iSESTING INSTRUMENTS 

1. The Tests 

The California Elementary Language Test, and the 
California Intermediate Language Test were employed in the 
Albert a survey of achievement in language in grades IV and 
VII. Both were developed by Ernest W. Tiegs, Ph.D. and 
Willis W. Clark, Ed.D. and were published by the California 
Test Bureau, ^916 Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles 28, 
California. 

The California Achievement Test battery consists of 
tests of attainment in Reading, Arithmetic, and Language. 
These tests are revisions of the Progressive Achievement 
Tests by the same authors.. The levels of the Elementary 
and Intermediate Language Tests are grades 4 to 6, and 
grades T to 9 respectively. Each test is available in 
four forms, AA, BB, CC, and CD. In this study forms AA 
were used. 

Twenty-eight minutes are required for completion 
of the Intermediate Language Test and twenty-five minutes 
for the Elementary Language Test. The authors state that 
these time limits are sufficient for 90 > of the students,

while the remaining IO 70 complete all the questions they are 
capable of comprehending and answering within the time limits. 
The tests are therefore to be considered as power tests rather 
than speed tests. 


2. The Manual 


A comprehensive manual is provided for each of the 
four levels of the California Tests: Primary, grades 1 to 4; 
Elementary, grades 4 to 6; Intermediate, grades 7 to ^; and 
Advanced, grades 9 to 14. 

Each manual contains the following sections: 

Part 1. Description of the Test 
Reliability and Validity 

Part 2. Diagnostic Profile 
Diagnostic Analysis 
Other Uses of Test Results 

Part 5 . Directions for Administration 

Part 4. Directions for scorixig Norms 

The authors consider that one of the unique features 
of the test is its value in diagnosis. They devote three and 
a half pages of the twenty page manual to a discussion of 
this topic. 

The test is standardized, and each item has been 
selected for its diagnostic value in measuring achieve¬ 
ment in twenty-seven essential elements of language 
skill sampled in the sub-test sections, bcores made 
on this test will reveal the language grade placement 
and percentile rank of students in relation to the 
general school population.

In addition, this test is designed not only 
to measure achievement, but to pi^ovide a basis for 
planning remedial instruction in the areas where 
individual students may be deficient* A Diagnostic 
Profile and a Diagnostic Analysis of Learning Diffi- 
ciolties is provided with each test booklet or Scoreze 
Answer Sheet.^ 

3. Scoring 

One of the attractive features of the California 
Ifests is the simplified scoring procedure. For busy teachers 
this aspect of the tests will have much appeal. 

Ihere are three methods of scoring the test. Under 
a hand method used in this survey, the answers are scored by 
a key which ignores wrong answers, gives no partial answers, 
and scores each correct response as worth one mark. The 
second method utilizes the Scoreze Answer Sheet. It is fas¬ 
ter than the hand method, since by its construction, it 
records a carbon copy of the pencil mark made by the pupil 
which enables the correct answers to be quickly totalled. 

The third method uses I.B.M. Answer Sheets which are machine 
scored. 

By whatever method the test is scored considerable 
time is required for the tabulation of scores of the sub- 
tests used for diagnostic purposes* To make the tabulation 
for the Diagnostic Analysis of Learning Difficulties it is 
necessary to record the scores on test items number 1 to ^0 


inclusive

4. Description of the Test Items 


The eighty items in the Elementary Language Test 
are intended to sample the fundamental language skills at 
the grade IV to VI level. The language skills examined by 
this test, and the items of the test which sample the pupil’s 
achievement in each of these fundamental skills, are stated 
on the Diagnostic Profile sheet to be as follows:

It may be observed that if knowing when to use a 
capital letter is a measurable language skill, then knowing 
when not to use a capital letter is part of that skill. I'hat 
being so, it would seem that over-capiteLlization should be 
considered in scoring. 

Although the period is an important punctuation mark 
in grades 4, 3 and 6 , only one item is used to measure this 
ability. 

The sub-test Words and Sentences, with a possible 
score of 20 , uses the alternate answer method (e.g. them, 
those;. This gives a grade lY pupil a fifty-fifty chance of 
scoring 10 marks and a grade placement of 2.8 solely by

guessing. 

The California Test of Spelling measures the ability 
to select a misspelled word from a group of four words* Such 
ability is a useful skill for proof-reading, and ts easily 
measured. It may be questioned, however, if it is identical 

to the skill used in writing words correctly. 

If the California Elementary Language Test is a good 

testing instrument at this level, then it is evident from the 
test content that language ability for grade 4, ^ and 6 pupils 
consists of a knowledge of the use of capital letters, the use 
of the period, comma, quotation mark, and question mark, the 
correct use of ten words, recognizing a group of words as a 

sentence, and being able to proof read 30 words for spelling 
errors. The manual refers to these as "fundamental skills" 
and their combination as "total language ability". 

Eew of the fundamental skills in language which are 
now accepted as important in elementary education are tested 
by the California Elementary Language Test. There is no 
recognition of the concept that language is a means of com¬ 
munication, and as such, it involves reading, speaking, lis¬ 
tening, and writing. The language teacher in the modern 
classroom has a broader concept of language and its develop¬ 
ment than those which may be measured by tests of mechanics 
of English, formal grammar, spelling and handwriting. It is 
quite possible that a teacher who has emphasized the Enter- 

^ Note: A study of the relationship between these skills is 

currently being made in the Faculty of Education.

prise in her curriculum may find to her dismay, that although 
she has trained her children to be skillful in thinking and 
in exchanging thoughts in clear and interesting ways, yet, 
for various reasons, her class gets a low "Total Language” 
rating on such a test. 

In the 19^4 Achievement iDurvey, of which this study 
is a part, each pupil was asked to write a page of original 
composition upon a given topic, buch a test should make a 
useful supplement to the Ualifornia Language Tests. Lven so, 
if language development involves reading, speaking, listening, 
and writing, then other supplementary tests need to be used 
before a satisfactory evaluation of language ability can be 
made. 

The format and composition of the California inter¬ 
mediate Language Test is essentially the same as that of the 
Elementary Test described above. 

The California Intermediate Language Test is designed 
to measure what are purported to be fundamental language 
skills at the grade 7> 3 and 9 level. The test is divided 
into two sections. Test 9 consists of 7^ items in the area 
of Mechanics of English and (irammar. Test 6 is an alterna¬ 
tive answer spelling test consisting of ^0 items. The only 
advance this test makes in broadening its measurement of 
language skills is in adding to the design of the Elementary 
Language Test, a sub-test, yv, Parts of bpeech. The specific

The comments made about the items used to test 
language ability in the California Elementary Language Test 
all apply to the items in the California Intermediate Lang¬ 
uage Test. The only difference in the nature of the items 
is the inclusion of a sub-test on the parts of speech in the 
Intermediate Language Test. It seems unfortunate that the 
only growth in language ability measured by the intermediate 
and Advanced Level of the California Language Tests is in the 
questionable area of parsing.

The authors state in the manual that because of the 
limited number of scores (10 to 30) on various sections of 
the test, the sub-test scores should be used only as guides 
to indicate the probable areas of pupil difficulty in the 
five major phases of the test, capitalization, punctuation.

words and sentences, parts of speech and spelling. As a 
result no coefficients of reliability have been produced for 
the sub-test scores. 

The test authors claim for the California Language 
Tests a high degree of validity* The scores which the pupil 
obtains in the fundamental skills measured by the test will 
indicate his competence in terms of grade placement and per¬ 
centile ranking achieved by the 100,000 pupils used in the 
standardization of the test. 

The test has been constructed to include only those 
items which can be answered with equal chance of success in 
any area of the country. None of them depends upon the 
vagaries of curriculum content and local interpretation. 
Teachers in all areas teach the use of the question mark, 
and all teach the same usage. In the same v/ay, the v^idity 
of the California Language Tests depends upon universal ac¬ 
ceptance of the correct forms in capitalization, punctuation, 
sentence structure and spelling. 

The test items in the l^^l edition of the California 
Language Tests are those that have finally been accepted 
after an item analysis of the 19^1f 1^4^, 1^4^ and 19^0 edi¬ 
tions given to 100,000 students in schools throughout the 
United States. 


The authors base their claim for the high validity 
of the California Language Tests upon this item analysis.

They state in the manual that 

The selection of items, on which the validity 
depends, is simplified in this test because it 
measures some of the most tangible and easily iden¬ 
tifiable objectives of the curriculum. 

And again, under the heading Validity, they say, 

Many studies have been made of the individual 
test items in the various tests under a wide variety 
of conditions* With few exceptions, the value of the 
individual items has been repeatedly vindicated, and 
they have been retained in the tests. In the few 
instances where the value of an individual item has 
been questioned, it has been dropped and replaced by 
another, (manual, p*4.; 

it is difficult to see how the mere popularity of 
items, and their ease of objective measurement can be accep¬ 
table criteria of items of high validity* One would like to 
know, who were the authorities who judged the items as being 
suitable for inclusion in a larguage test? And still more 
important, what aspects of language development do they ex¬ 
pect an achievement test to measure with fidelity? 

If the items in the California Language Tests have 
a high validity then it may be that the tests are incorrectly 
named, auch a title as "Achievement Tests in the Mechanics 
of English" would probably better describe what the tests 
actually measure. There would likely be little opposition 
to the claim that the items have a high validity in this 
restricted area of language measurement.

6* The Test Norms 

The California Language Test norms supplied in the 
manual were based upon the achievement of over a half a 
million pupils in school districts of all sizes and types 
throughout the United States. The norms have been based 
upon a stratified sampling of 100,000 cases for each level 
of the test. The controlled characteristics of the sample 
were as follows: 

Mental Ability, the median I.Q. of grades 4, 6, 

7 and 8 of the sample was 100. The grade 9 sample had a 
median I.^. of 101.^. The standard deviation of the I.^. 
distributions was 16 in all cases. 

School Progress, 70> of the pupils were making nor¬ 
mal progress through the grades; about 20?. were retarded 
half a year or more, and 10> were accelerated one half a 
year or more. 

Racial Origin, about 8^> of the population was 
Caucasian and the remainder were Mexican, Negro, or in other 
minority groups. 

The norms obtained from this large sample are given 
in the manual as follows: 

Grade Placement, the grade placement norms are given 
as the median scores of the standard population on the three 
sub-tests, Mechanics of English and Grammar, Spelling, and

Percentile Norms, the percentile norms are given for 
the same sub-tests that are measured in grade placement. 

Two sets of percentile norms are given for each grade, and 
each grade is subdivided into a low grade level, and a high 
grade level. The reason for this arrangement is to provide 
a measuring instrument which may serve the needs of schools 
in California which use a mid-term promotion practice. Grade 
four pupils in February move automatically from Low Grade IV 
to High Grade IV. 

7. Mjustment of Norms for Intelligence Variations 

An interesting feature of the data supplied in the 
manual is the table of positive and negative correction 
values to the median norms of grade placement which are ap¬ 
plied when the intelligence of a sample departs materially 
from normal. For example, if a class of grade four pupils 
is found to have a median I.q. of 109, the teacher should not 
expect their median achievement in the month of May to be 
within a grade placement range of from 4.6 to 4.9, as given 
in the table for the standardizing population, which had a 
median I.Q,. of 100. The Adjustment Table in the manual gives 
a correction of 0.48 which raises the median Spelling grade 
placement norm for this class to a range of from 9*o8 to 9*38. 
The teacher may now compare the median spelling achievement

8. Keview of the California Language Tests from 
the Fourth Mental Measurements iear Book 


The following review is by Gerald ¥. Launholm, 

Project Director, Educational Testing Service, Princeton, 

New Jersey. 

Despite the claims of the authors that the tests 
aid in the identification of strengths and weaknesses 
of individual pupils, it is the reviewer's opinion 
that the tests will serve better as measures of 
achievement than they will serve as diagnostic ana¬ 
lytic instruments. 

The reviewer bases this criticism upon the inade¬ 
quacy of the sanpling of the test items used for diagnostic 
purposes, and upon the lack of evidence of their reliability. 

To say that the California Language Tests are more 
suitable for determining achievement than for diagnosis is 
to deny the chief merit claimed for the tests by the authors. 
This vigorous criticism deserves serious consideration. 

In a review by Robert 0. Pooley, Professor of English, 

and Chairman of the Department of Integrated Liberal tJtudies, 

12 

University of Wisconsin, the following observations are made 

Except for one or two dubious itenis the tests appear 
to be a convenient, easily scored and reasonably valid 
test of mechanical skills in written English. 

The parsing exercise is a teaching technique which 
properly fell into disrepute many decades ago. It i s 
distressing to find it revived in this test. Since 
there is absolutely no objective evidence to support 
the assumption that knowledge of parts of speech con-

tributes to a child’s command of language, this 
section is invalid in a language test and therefore 
invalidates the score of the entire test as a measure 
of language skill. 

The review goes on to give a statement of some of 
the more important elements marking growth in iSnglish skill. 
It concludes with this sentence; 

Since the California Language Tests ignore these 
more basic factors in Language development the use of 
the tests above the fourth grade can yield returns 
increasingly unrelated to the measurement of skill in 
language. 

This is again harsh criticism at the testing instru¬ 
ment used in this investigation. Yet, to some extent, the 
results of this study indicate some agreement with the 
evaluations of the reviewers published in the l^ourth Mental 
Measurements Year Book. 

After a teacher has diagnosed a pupil's difficulties 
by means of the California Language Test and has revealed 
the strengths and weaknesses in capitalization, punctuation, 
words and sentences, parts of speech, and spelling, neither 
she nor her pupil has any knowledge of the pupil's skill in 
the basic factors of language development emphasized by Prof, 
Pooley. 

The comprehensive nature of the 19^4 Achievement 
Survey in Language is well designed to assess a pupil’s 
ability in the skills of communication which are basic to 
language development, A constellation of scores from this

survey are available in mental ability, mechanics of English 
and Grammar, spelling, total language, reading and ability 
to write original prose. This broad examination of a pupil’s 
language ability is comparable to the suggestions for adequate 
language measurement made by Professor Pooley; 

What factors mark growth in language skill? 

Purely among them are an advance in unity and the 
power to sustain an idea; an advance in sentence 
structure featuring increasing subordination; an 
increase in the power to organize and present 
materials logically; a growth in diction leading 
to the use of colorful words in effective places. 

These factors are what good English teachers 
teach; it is upon these and similar factors that 
pupils should be tested.

!• Oomparison of Grade IV and VII Language Achievement 

The basis of comparison in this chapter is the grade 
level obtained by the Alberta samples on the Oalifornia 
Language Tests in the three sub-tests: Mechanics of English, 
and Grammar; spelling, and Total Language. The data from 
these tests enable a comparison to be made between the 
achievement of the Alberta group of pupils and that of the 
American group used in the standardization of the California 
Language Tests.

I'he grade IV sample consisted of pupils randomly 
selected from the following representative areas: large ur¬ 
ban, small urban, towns, graded rural, and ungraded rural. 
The grade VTI sample consisted of ^27 pupils randomly selec¬ 
ted from the same areas. 

The means of the achievement of the grade IV and 
grade VII samples are to be seen in Table III. 

In examining the means in this table, it is evident 
that on each of the sub-tests both iU.berta samples of grade 
IV and grade VII pupils achieved a higher language level 
than their actual grade placement* Two questions are of 
interest at this stage* How much is this measured achieve¬ 
ment above their actual grade level, and how much growth in 
language ability do the means indicate has taken place be¬ 
tween grade IV and grade VTI? These questions are examined 
in Tables IV and V. 

Table IV shows, that in the skills measured by the 
California Language sub-tests, the pupils of the grade IV 
and grade VII sample had an achievement level which was from 
seven months to a year and two months beyond their actual 
grade placement, v^ihile this is an encouraging finding it 
must be noted that its validity depends upon the assumption 
that the Alberta sample and the American sample are com¬ 
parable.

Table Y indicates the actual grade placement of the 
grade VI I group in the language skills measured by the Cali¬ 
fornia Language Tests. It shows that growth in bpellirig is 
satisfactory, but that in Mechanics of English, and Total 
Language the growth is somewhat below what might be expected. 

The range of grade placement scores in the tables of 
norms for the California Language Tests is from 2.0 to 11.0 
for the Eleaentary level, grades IV, V and VI, and from 3*0 
to 14.0 for the Intermediate level, grades VII, VIII and IX. 
While the wide range is expected as a result of the few devi¬ 
ant scores at either extremity of the scale, the obtained 
range does seem greater than was anticipated.

Table VT gives the range of grade placement scores 
of the Alberta sample of grade IV and grade YII pupils. 

These are rather startling grade placement ranges. 
They indicate the need for language testing and a teaching 
programme suited to the range of ability of the pupils in 
the class. They also emphasize the necessity for grouping 
within a grade in terms of ability in language, just as is 
ordinarily done in reading. 

The distribution of scores around the mean may be 
measured by the standard deviation of the distribution. 
This central tendency for the distributions of the grade 
placement scores of the grade IV and grade VTI Alberta 
samples is given in the following table:

From the preceding table, three observations may be 
made. i?irst, of the grade iV sub-test scores, the most 
variable £u:e the ones in Mechanics of Jilnglish and Grammar. 
Second, all the grade VII sub-test scores have a greater 
variability than have the corresponding grade IV scores. 
Third, by observing the difference in grade placement range 
between the 93.447® and the 10Oy® of the grade iV distribu¬ 
tions it is seen that the greater range of ability of the 
few, exceptional, pupils in the 4.367® of the distribution, 
exceeds the total range of language ability of all the other 
pupils. This spread of ability is not as marked in the grade 
VII. 


2. The Best Estimate of JUberta Means 

If the assumption can be made that the sample is 
representative of the total Alberta population of grade IV 
and grade VII pupils, then population means may be estimated 
from the obtained sample means and the known distribution of 
pupil population in Alberta. 

To determine the best estimate of Alberta nBans, the 
provincial enrolment totals in grades IV and vll were ob¬ 
tained from the 1932-33 Annual Reports of the Department of 
Education. These totals are given in Table VIII below.

It should be noted that the 1876 grade IV and VII 
pupils tested in this study comprised ^.27® of the provincial 
enrolment in these grades, and the 19 , 9 ^ 2 , grade IV and YII 
pupils used as a basis in calculating the Alberta means, 
comprised ^^. 7 > of the 3^,774 pupils in these grades. 

The best estimate of the means of the Alberta popula¬

Tests are given in Table X. 

In an achievement survey one of the most important 
values to be determined is the achievement level of the 
sample on the test administered. This is measured by find¬ 
ing the mean score of the distribution of pupils* scores. 
Having found the mean, the next consideration concerns its 
reliability. What confidence can be placed in it as a 
measure which acceptably approximates the "true mean” of 
the population from which the sample was drawn? we would 
like to know, within certain accepted limits of probability, 
the range around the sample mean in which the population 
mean may be expected to fall. These ranges for each of the 
sub-test means are given in Table XI.

From Table XI we may state that the true mean of the 
grade lY sample is within 0*0^88 grade placements of the sam¬ 
ple mean for each of the sub-tests. If other sample means 
were obtained by repeating this survey, we could expect, with 
a chance of being right 9-5 times out of 100, that they would 
fall within the narrow range of 0.12 grade placements, that 
is, within one school month of grade placement. 

The grade ¥II true mean is within 0.098 grade place¬ 
ments of each sample mean for the Mechanics of English and 
Grammar, and Spelling sub-tests, and within 0.078 grade 
placements of the sample mean in Total Language. 

It is noted that the range of error for the grade 
¥11 sample means in this study is about twice as large as 
that of the grade I¥ means. This is due to the greater 
variability of the grade vll sample scores. 

we may conclude that the means obtained in this sur¬ 
vey have sufficient reliability for the purposes of the edu¬ 
cational problem being investigated, for there is not much 
practical advantage in measuring the level of language 
achievement closer than one or two school months of grade 
placement.

distribution is symmetrical about the mean and is said to 
have a skewness of zero. If a distribution has a greater 
number of cases to the right or left of the mean it is asym¬ 
metrical or skewed. More cases to the right give a negative 
skewness with the tail of the curve of distribution to the 
left of the mean. Distributions with the frequency bunched 
to the left of the mean are positively skewed. The skewness 
of an achievement test distribution indicates the ease or 
difficulty of the test items* A difficult test would group 
the pupils at the low end of the scale and give a positive 
skewness to the distribution. 

In examining the data in Table X it is noted that 
the skewness of the distributions of grade placement scores 
on the grade lY and VII sub-tests ranged from - 0.3 to + 0 . 13 . 
It will be necessaxy to find out if these variations from 
normal distributions are small enough to be due to chance, 
or whether they are significant. 

The skewness was deteimined as follows: 

P 90 + PIO 

Sk -g—— - P 30 (Where P is a percentile) 

The skewness of the grade IV Mechanics of English and Gram¬ 
mar distribution of grade placement scores is as follows:

at the level of coiifidence. We may feel sure then, that 
the distribution of the Grade Placement scores of grade IV 
pupils on the sub-test Mechanics of English and Grammar is 
significantly skewed in a positive direction with the tail 
of the curve to the left. The pupils’ scores are bunched 
to the high end of the grade placement table of norms. The 
”t” values of the other standard errors of the measures of 
skewness are given in the following table:

It may be concluded that more students made scores 
on the high end than on the low end of the grade placement 
scale. Considering that the grade placement means of these 
two groups in spelling is ^.90 and 9 * 13 , and that both dis¬ 
tributions of scores are significantly skewed in a negative 
direction, it would seem that the grade IV and grade VII 
pupils' achievement in Spelling is commendable. 

The grade IV distributions of Mechanics of English 
and Grammar, and spelling are positively skewed, with that 
of Mechanics of jmglish and Grammar being highly signifi¬ 
cant. Total Language skewness is not significant. 

6 . The Kurtosis of the Distributions 

Kurtosis is the measure of the dispersion of eases 
around the mean. In a narrow dispersion where the cases 
are concentrated about the mean, the distribution is des¬ 
cribed as "peaked” and the coefficient of kurtosis is less 
than the value 0 . 263 , the kurtosis value of the normal dis¬ 
tribution. This would be the situation if the nature of the 
test items favored the pupils of average ability, but were 
more discriminatory in testing the pupils of below and above 
average ability. 

The kurtosis of the distributions of scores of the 
grade IV and grade VII samples in this survey, which are 
given in Table XIII, range from 0.23 to 0 . 23 . It is neces-

It is seen from Table XIII that the only distributions 
of scores having a kurtosis significantly greater than that in 




























f" 


^2 


a normal distribution was in the grade IV and grade VII 
Mechanics of English and Grammar scores. 

The significant kurtosis of the Mechanics of English 
and Grammar scores is platykurtic in tendency. This may be 
the result of too many easy items, too few difficult items, 
and too few items of medium difficulty, all operating simul¬ 
taneously. It might also result from the departure from 
normality of the sample. 

It has been noted that both grade IV and grade VII 
spelling scores had a negative skewness with approximately 
the same high **t*' value of significance. In comparing the 
same distributions, it is seen from Table XIII that the 
kurtosis in both cases is negligible, with each having a 
correspondingly low ”t’* value. 

It may be concluded that on the -Alberta samples 
the California Language Tests exhibit consistency in 
measurement in the area of spelling at both the Elementary 
and Intermediate levels of grades IV and VII. 

8. A Summary of the Chapter 

This summary of the chapter gives a number of the

When these levels of achievement are compared with 
the actual grade placement of the groups at the time of 
testing, namely, 4,^ and it seoas that the language 

ability of the Alberta pupils in the sample is at an accep¬ 
table level of attainment. 

£• Ihe data on range of grade placement of individual 
pupils seems important. I'he smallest range of scores was 
6.3 grades for grade IV spelling, ihe largest range of 
scores was 9*9 grades in grade YII Mechanics of Jiinglish and 
Grammar. In Total Language the range of grade placement 
was 6*6 for grade IV and 8.3 for grade VII.

Since over nine hundred pupils formed each of the 
grade IV and grade VII groups exhibiting this wide range of 
language ability, it is likely that this is a significant 
and not too widely accepted characteristic of language 
ability in the ordinary classroom. If such extreme range 
is common, teachers must be made aware of its presence and 
take measures to meet the situation. 

The grade IV and grade VII pupils were most con¬ 
sistent in Spelling achievement than in the other sub-tests. 
The Spelling means of 5*90 and ^.13 were well above the 
actual grade placement of 4.^ and for the two groups. 
Both distributions of Spelling scores were negatively skewed 
and significant at the .0^ level of confidence. This devi¬ 
ation from the normal distribution indicates a greater clus¬ 
tering of scores at the high end of the scale than at the 
low end. Neither distribution exhibited a significant kur- 
tosis. 


4. The grade IV and grade V'll distributions of scores 
on the Mechanics of English and urammar sub-tests were both 
found to have a kurtosis significantly greater than that in 
a normal distribution, further study would be needed to 
determine if this was due to the distribution of item dif¬ 
ficulty in the sub-test or to an atypical distribution of 
language ability in the sample.

PRESENTATION OE DATA OON^ilNUED 


1. The Adjustment of Norms in Relation to 
Intelligence Quotient Medians 

The California Language Tests were standardized on a 
selected sample of 100,000 cases for each level of the test. 
The median I.Q. for grades IV to vTII inclusive was 100 with 
a standard deviation of 16. The median l.Q. for grade IX 
was 101.^ with a standard deviation of 16 points. 

Glasses in grades IV to vTII, inclusive, which have 
a median i.Q. of 10 0 may have their California Language Test 
achievement compared with the Grade Placement Norms, the Age 
Norms, or the Percentile Norms on pages 1? and 20 of the 
Manual. But if the median I.Q. of a class departs appreci» 
ably from 100, correction values must be applied to the 
California Language Test norms before a valid rating of 
achievement may be made. 

TO determine the corrections for the sample used in 
this investigation reference is made to table XIV. 

The Alberta sample of l88^ pupils was found to have 
a mean I.Q. of 10^.^6, almost six points higher than the 
median I.Q. of the sample on which were based the norms of 
the California Language Tests.

3# Comparison of the Achievement of the Alberta Sample 
with the Norms of the California Language Tests 

The relationship between the percentile grade place¬ 
ment scores of the Alberta sample and the California norms 
is given in Tables XVII and XVIII, but it is more easily seen 
in the percentile graphs shown in figures 1 to 6. 

The graphs show that the curves of the grade placement 
scores of the Alberta sample are well to the right of the 
area bounded by the percentile curves of the lower and upper 
limits of the California Grade Placement norms. This satis¬ 
factory relationship is seen in all the graphs for both the 
grade IV and grade VII samples of Alberta children. 

4* A Summarj? of the Chapter 

This chapter discusses the adjustment of the Califor¬ 
nia Language Test grade placement medians to the mean intel¬ 
ligence of the sample, and also presents the levels of 
achievement of the sample as a percentile table of grade 
placement. The following are the main findings of the chap¬ 
ter. 

1. The mean I.Q. of the sample as measured by t he 
California Short Form Test of Mental Maturity was 10^.96. 

The adjustment values given in the manual for the California 
Language sub-test medians for the sa]35)le, ranged from +.48 
for grade XV Spelling to +.64 for grade vll Mechanics of

English and Grammar. Adding the adjustments to the Califor¬ 
nia medians provided comparable levels of achievement between 
the Alberta sample and the American standardizing sample. 

This comparison given in Table AVI shows that on all sub¬ 
tests the Alberta sample had a higher level of language 
achievement, and that the superiority in grade placement 
ranged from .13 for grade VTI in Mechanics of English and 
Grammar to .8o for grade VII in Spelling. 

If the adjustment values were given in terms of the 
median Language I.Q,. instead of the median Total I.Q,. their 
use in a language survey would probably be still more effec¬ 
tive. 

2. A percentile table is given of the grade placement 
scores on the sub-tests of each of the grade IV and grade 
VTI groups. Tor purposes of comparison, graphs are shown 
of the percentile distribution of grade placement scores of 
the Alberta sample and of those given in the manual as • 
California Language Test norms. 

The California Language Test percentile norms are 
given as grade placement scores for the lower and upper 
limits of each interval in the distribution. The data shows 
that at each percentile step the Alberta sample had a higher 
achievement level than the California standardization sample. 
This applied to both the grade iV and grade VII group of the

Alberta pupils on all sub-tests. 

The findings of Chapter VI confirm, the opinion 
expressed in the last chapter, that the language ability of 
the 1876 pupils in the Alberta sample compares favorably 
with the ability of the 100,000 pupils which comprised the 
standardizing sample of the California lianguage Tests. 


GHAPi-ER VII 


OONGLUSIONa 

The purpose of this investigation was to determine 
the level of language achievement of Alberta pupils in grades 
four and seven. 

In assessing the results of the study two factors 
need to be considered. lirst, the Alberta sample and the 
American sample on which the ualifornia i*anguage Tests were 
standardized are far from comparable due to the influence of 
differing curricula, standards, and promotion policies, com¬ 
parisons between the two groups must therefor be made with 
reservation. Second, the California Language Tests give a 
grade placement rating based on the measurement of a limited 
range of language skills mainly in the area of mechanics of 
written English, including capitalization, punctuation, 
spelling, and grammatical usage. 

The findings of the study follow in tabulated form, 
it must be kept in mind that these results are based upon 
the scores of a randomly selected group of ^49 grade IV 
pupils and 927 grade VTI pupils, who, at the time of testing, 
had an actual grade placement or 4.9 and 1*9 grades respec¬ 
tively. The testing instrument was the Galifornia Elementary

Language Test and the California Intermediate Language Test, 
Form AA. 

1. In Total Language the Alberta sample achieved a 
mean grade placement of 3.^4 in grade IV and 8.82 in grade 
VII. Thus it is apparent that the Alberta pupils were at a 
level of language achievement 1.04 grades above their actual 
grade level in grade IV, and 0.92 grades above actual grade 
level in grade VII. 

2. In Mechanics of English and Grammar the Alberta 
sample achieved a mean grads placement of ^.97 and 8.^7 Tor 
grades IV and VII, representing a placement above actual 
grade position of 1.07 in grade IV, and 0.67 in grade VII. 

3. In Spelling the Alberta sample achieved a mean 
grade placement of ^.86 and 9*10 for grades IV and VII. 

This is a grade placement above actual grade level of 0.96 
and 1.20 for the grade IV and VII pupils, respectively. 

The results of grade IV and VII pupils were most 
consistent in the Spelling sub-test. Both distributions 
of scores had a mean grade placement approximately one grade 
above the chronological grade placement; both distributions 
were significantly (.0^ level) skewed in a negative direc¬ 
tion with the pupils’ scores clustering at the high end of 
the scoring scale rather than at the low end; both had a 
kurtosis which was approximately normal with a normal 
grouping of scores around the mean.

4. The Total Language grade placement of ^.^4 achieved 
by the grade IV pupils in Alberta after 4.9 years of school 
attendance represents an average increment in language of 
1.21 grades per year while attending grades I to IV in 
Alberta schools. 

The Total Language grade placement of 8.82 achieved 
by the grade VII Alberta pupils is an increase of 2.88 grades 
over the grade level of ^.94 achieved by the grade IV Alberta 
pupils. This represents an average increment of 0.96 grades 
per year in grades V, VI and VII in the Alberta school sys¬ 
tem. 

6. The Alberta sample has an overall superiority in 
intelligence over the normalizing sample of California chil¬ 
dren with a mean I.Q. of 10^.96 compared with the California 
mean I.i^. of 100. 

7. Even when the California median achievement is cor¬ 
rected for the difference in intelligence as suggested by the 
manual of the California Language Test, there is still a net 
superiority in Total Language grade placement for the Alberta 
children of .69 grades in grade IV, and .^7 grades in grade 
VII. 

8. The range of grade placement varied from 6.3 in 
grade IV Spelling to 9*9 in grade VII Mechanics of English 
and Grammar. The composite score of Total Language had a 
range of grade placement scores of 6.6 in grade IV to 8.3

in grade YII. 

This finding focusses attention upon the teaching 
problem caused by the extreme range of language ability in 
the ordinary classroom. The Curriculum cuides which direct 
teaching in the province and the teachers who implement the 
curricula in the (iuides might well direct more attention to 
providing for the needs indicated by the extreme range of 
language achievement in Alberta schools. 

Another significant conclusion is that Alberta 
pupils in grades Y, ¥I and YII appear to have a slower rate 
of language growth than in grades I to IV. This finding 
opens interesting avenues for further study into the causes 
of the apparent slowing down of language achievement in 
grades V, vl and YII. 

10. Percentile tables of grade placement in language 
achievement of 18 ?6 Alberta pupils in grades IV and YII are 
included in Chapter YI. This information should make the 
California Language Tests more useful iib asuring instruments 
in Alberta schools. 

11. The findings of this survey give only the relative 
language ability of pupils in grades IV and YII in Alberta 
classrooms and in selected classrooms in American schools. 

Since language is the communication of ideas and 
involves abilities in listening, speaking, reading and 
writing, all those who meet our school children are immedi-
