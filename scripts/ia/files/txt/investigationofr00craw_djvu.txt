Part I - The Purpose of the Study 


The purpose of this study is to discover the rela¬ 
tive merits of the objective and literary form of exam¬ 
ination as a final test at the close of a school year’s 
work in History. That test which is the more economic¬ 
al will be conceded to be the better provided it also 
tests more accurately or with equal accuracy that which 
it is presumed to test. 

In 1931 the Department of Education of Alberta put 
its facilities at the disposal of the Education Society 
of Edmonton that it might investigate this subject in 
the field of History II of the High School course. The 
candidates in that subject wrote two papers, a literary 
test of two hours duration and an objective test of one 
hour. A report has been made to the Minister of Educat¬ 
ion based on the scores obtained from 1000 pairs of 
papers, about one-fifth of the total. The following 
items from that report are significant for the purpose 
of this study. 

"The small probable error discovered, viz: 0.0134 
indicates that 1000 cases constitute a very good sampl¬ 
ing of all the papers, and that the final correlation 
based upon 5000 papers is not likely to vary much from 
that obtained from the sample . n 

"The correlation between the final marks on the 
A (essay) and B (objective) papers for lOQOcases was

done according to the Pearson method. The obtained co¬ 
efficient was 0.615.” — "This obtained coefficient is 
remarkably high, approximating closely to that ordinar¬ 
ily found between two similar essay-type examinations 
covering the same subject-matter." 

"The average time for scoring the objective tests 
was minutes with an additional one-half minute for 
entering details on the data sheets." 

From the point of view of costs the objective test 
is preferable. Under normal scoring conditions only 
the final mark would be recorded. This would mean a 
saving of the one-half minute spent in entering, on a 
data sheet, the marks obtained on each section of the 
test. The time spent on reading an essay type of paper 
is about ten minutes when readers are working at a max¬ 
imum rate of speed. Thus there is effected a two-thirds 
saving. This is slightly offset by the fact that a 
higher fee should be paid for the setting of an object¬ 
ive type of test, and also by a possible increase in the 
cost of printing. But these items when spread over five 
thousand candidates would be almost negligible. From 
the standpoint of costs, then, the objective test has 
the advantage. 

The point that remains to be investigated is the 
relative validity of the tw^o types of test; admittedly, 
by far the more important consideration from a purely

educational point of view. The validity of a test, to 
borrow from Ruch, M is the degree to which it measures 
what it is claimed to measure”. This includes reliabil¬ 
ity; i.e. "the accuracy with which a test measures 
whatever it does measure"; for without reliability a 
test cannot be highly valid. It therefore becomes the 
specific purpose of this investigation to measure and 
compare the validity of the two tests. 

The question that arises at the outset is: What 
is the test presumed to measure? The answer is found 
in the Handbook for Secondary Schools of Alberta, which 
is the official guide to teachers. This document lays 
down specific goals for the course in History. "Two 
aims", it says, "should be held in view. These can per¬ 
haps best be termed the informational and the develop- 
mental. These subjects properly taught should place the 
student in possession of a body of knowledge of both 
practical and cultural value. They should also help, 
along with other subjects, to develop his intellect, ex¬ 
pand his imagination, and engender worthy personal and 
social ideals". The outline proceeds to explain that 
our present institutions, and conditions which are the 
product of the past, "are not intelligible without a 
knowledge of the past. This the study of History should 
give. . . .It is this record of the racial past which 
alone can afford to each successive generation a full

understanding of the political, social, and economic en¬ 
vironment in which it finds itself. And it is such a 
knowledge of the past leading to an understanding of the 
present which is one of the surest safeguards for a sane 
and enduring progress in the future.’ 1 

"History, Civics and Economics afford excellent 
opportunities for intellectual training. They should be 
so taught as to develop the innate memory capacities of 
the pupil, and to lead him to organize and group his 
memory facts in such a way that recall is ready, accurate 
and complete. 

But these subjects are sciences and the tasks re¬ 
quired of the pupil in History should be those required 
in any other science. He should search for data, group 
them, and build generalizations thereon. He should be 
required to discriminate between more and less important 
facts, should be guided to detect and trace the operat¬ 
ion of cause and effect in social development, and should 
be led to make judgments on historical events and person¬ 
ages, and acquire training in the evaluations of human 
actions. Care should be taken from the first that the 
pupil should form a scientific method of study. He should 
be practised in the logical arrangement and effective 
oral and written presentation of materials. Above all, 
he should be taught that as far as it is possible, he 
should discard preconceptions and prejudices, when he 
approaches any social problem and should go whither the

facts, in the light of reason lead him. 

But History, Civics, and Economics have a human 
interest; and possess moral and emotional factors which 
make them possible agencies for much more than merely 

intellectual training.-In a word, these subjects are 

capable of placing worthy ideals both for the individu¬ 
al and for society, before the young, and of affording 
a stimulus towards their attainment. 

In our day, manhood and womanhood suffrage have 
placed ultimate political authority irrevocably in the 
hands of the masses of the people. It follows that the 
problems, political, social and economic which society 
faces can be solved only by citizens who possess a 
knowledge of present day institutions and conditions, 
and an understanding of how they came into being; whose 
minds are trained to clear and honest thinking, and 
whose thoughts and activities are directed by worthy 

characters to unselfish social ends”.-”In teaching 

this period (History II, British History, from 1485 to 
the present day), main movements should be kept stead¬ 
ily before the pupils* attention, and particular facts 
given significance by being related to outstanding tend¬ 
encies of development.” 

An analysis of the foregoing exposition on the 
teaching of History leads to the following conclusions: 
1. On the informational sid e, the student should 
be directed to train his memory so that recall

may be ready, accurate, and complete. 

2• On the developmental side: (a) He should be 
led to understand the political, social and 
economic environment of the past, and be able 
to relate it to the present; (b) There should 
be developed in him unselfish social and per¬ 
sonal ideals. (c) He should be given the in¬ 
tellectual training involved in (1) organiz¬ 
ing material; and (2) making a scientific 
approach to the subject—that is to say, in 
detecting cause and effect, in building gen¬ 
eralizations thereon, and in making judgments 
of events and persons. 

3. Information on any topic falls into two cat¬ 
egories: the esential facts; and the addition¬ 

al material, paddingthat is, the product of 
a recall that is complete. 

The first task of the investigator is to query 
the validity of each test with these criteria as a 


basis.

The material which the text-hook provides for each 
question is the maximum that could be expected from the 
pupil. This subject matter was divided into informat¬ 
ional and developmental points. The former was sub¬ 
divided into major, the leading ideas on the topic; and 
minor, additional detail relative to the subject. The 
material below illustrates the procedure for three dif¬ 
ferent types of questions. 

Question I: 

Why did Henry VII establish the Court of the Star Chamber? 
What services did it render in his reign? 

The text provides the following: 

"He had to deal with troublesome relics and reminiscences 

of the unfortunate Roses struggle"-"Although there 

were no surviving sons of Henry VI nor of Edward IV, 

Henry VII had to deal with Pretenders to his throne." — 
then follows a page of detail regarding the Pretenders— 

"They (the Tudors') were often autocratic"-"from first 

to last, great vigilance was required, and but for the 
cool judgment and vigorous character of the Tudor princes, 
England might, at any moment, have found herself plunged 
into internecine struggles like those of the Roses- 

The Court of Star Chamber: 

"Henry VII died in 1509 at the age of fifty-three. 

He had governed England for twenty-four years in compara¬ 
tive peace after the troubles of the Roses. Many nobles

had been killed in that disturbed period; others had 
lost much of their property. The rest were held in 
cheek by the King, by means of the Court of Star 
Chamber, the Privy Council sitting as a court at West¬ 
minster, in camera stellata, to deal with the evils of 
livery and maintenance (see pp. 176-7). This court 
(which itself became an abuse in later days and was 
abolished in 1641) did very good service in the reign 
of Henry VII by enforcing the law when the ordinary 
justices and juries were afraid to do so. ! This court' 5 
said Lord Bacon, f is one of the sagest and noblest in¬ 
stitutions of this kingdom,* and by it the country was 
kept in order; for it aimed successfully at suppress¬ 
ing f force, and the two chief supporters of force, com¬ 
bination of multitudes, and maintenance or headship of 
great persons 1 . 

There follows the incident of the King imposing a heavy 
fine on the Earl of Oxford after accepting the hospital¬ 
ity of the great baron. This shows how Henry VII "with¬ 
out increasing the taxes, made the English government 
solvent, and left a large sum in the treasury when he 
died". 

Informational items: 

Major. 1. The King wished to keep peace in the country. 

2. He had to find money to pay the expenses of 
government.

The services it rendered were: 

(a) It kept order by enforcing the law. 

(b) It filled the treasury. 

Minor. 1. 

Many powerful nobles had perished. 

2. 

Pretenders to the throne had to be dealt 

with summarily. 

3. 

There existed the evil of livery and main¬ 
tenance . 

4. 

The incident of the Earl of Oxford. 

5. 

The Court of Star Chamber was the Privy 

Council. 


Possession of these facts would indicate a recall, 
"accurate and complete".

1. 

Selection and organization is required since 

the material is scattered over seven pages. 

2. 

It requires the relating of method to pur¬ 
pose . 

3. 

The ordinary justices and juries were afraid 

to enforce the law, hence judicial functions 


were conferred on the Privy Council. This 
is a concept difficult to grasp.

The analysi s of the paper reveals two facts : 

1. Some questions cover many more pages and involve 
many more points than do others which are given 
the same value in marks. 

2. Pupils who chose one group of options could make 

a pass or even a very high mark with very much less 
information than those who chose a different set of 
options. 

By selecting questions 1, 2 (Frobisher) 5, 6, 20 (Social 
Legislation), the pupil could make a perfect score 
on a maximum of 65 points: 

Informational, Major 31, Minor 26; Developmental 8.

The information on these five questions covers sixteen 
pages in a text of four hundred pages. (The course 
covers five hundred pages, but one hundred pages which 
deal with the events of wars are not required for exam¬ 
inations ) . 

If, however, the pupil should select Questions 3, 4, 8, 
10, (Foreign Policy) 11, (Gladstone, Asquith) the max¬ 
imum would be 140 points: 

Informational, Major 58, Minor 48; Developmental 34. 
This covers 48 pages-- 
The following selection of options: 

2 (Drake), 4, 6, 10 (Foreign Affairs), 11 (Palmerston, 
Gladstone) covers 54 pages. 

Any other selection of options would cover material 
ranging from 16 to 54 pages. 

3. No method of scoring one could adopt would compen¬ 
sate for the unreliability of a test set up on this 
basis. 

The 1931 test, however, might be claimed to 
be a freak, in as much as it was arranged for a two 
hour period. To check on this point, two other 
essay tests on the same course were examined, those 


of 1925 and 1932.

For the 1925 examination the maxiumum number of 
pages required was 62^, of these, 28j- pages dealt dir¬ 
ectly with the events of wars, material not now pre¬ 
scribed, The minimum was 37^-. The 1932 paper showed 
a maximum of 57; a minimum of 35. 

We conclude, therefore, that the 1931 paper ran 
pretty well to type so far as the maximum is concerned, 
but that the minimum is not typical. It should be point¬ 
ed out that the sections dealt with are among the most 
important as the nature of the topics indicates, and 
that the papers are a fairer sampling of 400 pages than 
at first glance would appear to be the case. But the 
fact remains that they are only a sample. 

The distribution of subject matter on the essay 
type paper is another point worthy of consideration. 

The text deals with 30 major topics covering the perfod 
1485 to 1920. The maximum touched on in any selection 
of options is in the 1931 paper, 5; in the 1925 paper, 

10; in the 1932 paper, 11. It would be possible to 
give a perfect answer to the 1931 paper by knowing only 
the period 1685—1846. 

Summary of Conclusions regarding Pape r A 

1. There is a wide variation in what is required to 
answer correctly different groupings of options. 

2. The paper is typical so far as the maximum number 
of pages required to provide a perfect answer is

3<> The Text-book deals with thirty major topics. A 
perfect answer may be given by a candidate who has 
a knowledge of five of those topics.

subject matter is completely organized in the text¬

It is frequently object^that because of the brief 
nature of the response required to an item on Paper B, 
it is possible for a pupil to make a high score even 
though he may not be able to develop the subject raised 
by the question. The best way to study that would be to 
have the two types of test set on precisely the same 
subject matter. Since this condition did not prevail in 
the 1931 tests, a brief investigation was made to dis¬ 
cover the degree to which this contention is supported 
by the facts. 

Test . 

The test was given to one hundred History II 
students. It was In two sections: 

Section A. 

Directions: Indicate whether the following statement 

are true or false. If false, state what 
you believe to be correct. 

1. In the reign of George I, the Whigs stressed the 
importance in the state of church and King. 

2. Walpole enforced the Navigation Acts against the 
American Golonies. 

3. The opposition under Pitt used the war-cry to drive 
Walpole from office. 

The ansv^rer papers for Section A were collected, then 
Section B was given. 

Section B. 


1. Write a note on the political parties in the reign

of George I stating the attitude of each to the 
monarchy. 

2. Explain the colonial policy of Walpole. 

3. Write a note on the fall of Walpole from political 
power. 

The papers were valued as follows: 

Section A. 

Method 1. False, false, true--was accepted as a com¬ 
plete response. 

Method 2. False, false, true--were accepted only if 
the explanation accompanying the decision 
in the first two items was satisfactory. 

Section B . 

Item 1.—The Whigs believed in limited monarchy and 
supported the Revolution. The Tories be¬ 
lieved in hereditory monarchy and supported 
the Stuarts. 

Item 2---His policy was non-interference. He permit¬ 
ted them self-government. 

He withdrew the navigation acts so far as 
rice and sugar were concerned. 

Item 3.—The student was required to indicate that it 
was Walpole f s peace policy that led to his 
defeat. 

The results were as fo Hows: 

In 72 cases out of 100 there was complete correspond¬ 
ence between Section A and Section B, when Section A 
was valued by Method 1.

In 86 cases there was complete correspondence when 
Section A was valued by Method 2. 

The following examples of lack of correspondence between 
the two will indicate the nature of the difficulty. 

Pupil 1 . 

SECTION A 

1. false - It was the Tories who stressed the im¬ 

portance of church and King. 

2. false - no explanation, 

3. true 

SECTION B 

1. The Political parties in power during the reign of 
George I were the Whigs and Tories. The Whigs were 
in power under Walpole’s term of office. The Whigs 
were in favor of having the Hanover line of Kings, 
but the Tories wished to have the Stuart line re¬ 
stored and thus get them into power in the Cabinet 
once more. 

2. Walpole’s colonial policy was in favor of having the 
colonies bring their goods to England without customs 
duty. He believed in peace between the colonies. 

3. Walpole built bonded warehouses over a wide area of 
England and proposed to place an excise tax on wine 
and tobacco as they left the country instead of a 
customs duty when they entered. This plan was reject¬ 
ed by the Cabinet and Walpole lost his influence and 
power through its failing to pass the Cabinet.

Pupil 2 . 

SECTION A 

1. True - They wanted the Hanoverians next on the 

throne. 

2. False - Walpole relieved the American colonies 

of the Navigation Acts, gave them the 
right to trade freely and non-interfer¬ 
ence. They had a legislative assembly 
and a governor elected by the Crown. 

3. False - He did not force Walpole from office 

but asked him to declare war, and he did. 

SECTION B 

1. The Tories believed in hereditary monarchy. But the 
Whigs wanted George I of Hanover on the throne. The 
Tories wanted the Old Pretender back on the throne, 
having the Stuart line back. Whigs were in majority 
in the House of Commons. The Scotch under the Earl 
of Mar were defeated at Sheriffmuir and Preston. 

But George I did not care for the Tories and so looked 
to the Whigs for help and help in Parliament. Later 
on some of the Whigs joined the Tories in opposition 
against Walpole led by Carteret. 

2. Colonial Policy of Walpole . 

Walpole's colonial policy was non-interference. He 
relieved the American Colonies from the Navigation 
Acts and gave the right to trade anywhere. The Am¬ 
erican Colonies governed themselves by a Legislative 
Assembly and a Governor elected by the Crown.

3. Fall of Walpole . 

Walpole T s home policy was peace but he did not keep 
this. Through the influence of William Pitt he 
went to war with Spain and he said to fight on the 
sea. But Spain had more strength on the land. The 
people were opposed to going to war. England T s 
naval force did not like to have to go to war with 
Spain. The House of Commons losts its majority and 
so he was forced to resign (Cabinet government). 

The following facts emerge: 

1. Item 1, Section A is a difficult concept for a 

History II class. Only 22 of 100 gave an adequate 
response: only one pupil attempted to include 

*Church and King M in Section B. 

2. Item 2 is a good question for the average pupil. 

79 of 100 knew that the Navigation Acts were with¬ 
drawn with respect to a few commodities. 

3. 82 of 100 were correct on Item 3. Of the 18 incor¬ 
rect on Section A all but 5 indicated in Section B 
that they understood what happened. The error was 
due to a misinterpretation of the word "drive". 

They did not consider Walpole was "driven" from 
office since he "resigned”. 

Note: These conclusions are confirmed by the read¬ 

ing of 95 of B papers 1931. On Item 1, there 
were 39 correct; Item 2, 80; Item 3, 54. 

4. Items of an objective test, if carefully construct¬ 
ed do constitute a reasonably accurate test of a

pupils 1 knowledge and ability. 


A comparison was made of the scores on this test with 
the marks obtained by these 100 pupils on their 
Christmas Examinations (essay type). The median score 
on the Christmas test was 49.8. There were 50 above 
the median and 50 below. Of the 50 above, 42 were 
those who in the test described above, gave a perfect 
correspondence between the objective and essay sect¬ 
ions. Of the 50 below the median, 22 gave a similar 
correspondence. 

5. This indicates that for the average and the super¬ 
ior students, the objective and essay type tests, 
give about the same result; for the poor student, 
the objective type gives an advantage. 

The next step was to discover what information can¬ 
didates writing an objective test brought into play and 
what reasoning they used to arrive at their conclusions. 
For this purpose, 10 of the 100 students who co-operat¬ 
ed on the first test were selected. They ranged from 
very good to very poor, their scores being: 

A, 82; B, 80; C, 76; D, 66; E, 56; F, 48; G, 33; H, 31; 
I, 29; J, 20. 

They were given three exercises, each of which took one- 


half hour.

The responses indicate that the pupils do considerably 
more than merely guess. 

PART I. 

Item 1 . The professionalizing of the army struck a 
blow at the Feudal system. 

Pupil E (56). "This means that the army was made up 
of mercenaries or paid men. In feudal times 
men fought for their own prtoection and not 
for money. One man could levy an army and 
conquer a feudal castle. Therefore, I come 
to the conclusion this is true"—-a good re¬ 
sponse. 

Pupil F (48). "What was the feudal System? Were the 
landlords afraid of the army? Did the army 
rise up against the landlords or was it some¬ 
thing else? What do we mean by profession¬ 
alizing? Gunpowder and different armour. 
True." (a typical response).

Item 5 , The religious changes under Henry Till made 
England Protestant. 

Pupil A (82). M Religious changes under Henry Till 

merely procured so that Henry might have his 
divorce and power. He was not in favour of 
Protestant doctrines. Retaining the old 
services—R.C. Only the form was changed. 
Therefore, England became in form a Protest¬ 
ant country but his people were still fully 
faithful to R. C. doctrines. Hence I would 
not consider it essentially a Protestant 
country. False.” 

Pupil I (29). "Henry Till wanted divorces but the 

Pope wouldn’t grant him any according to the 
R. C. Church. He then wanted to have author¬ 
ity over this himself and put himself head of 
the church. Then England became Protestant. 
True". 

Item 10 . 

The Navigation Act of Cromwells’ Parliament 
brought about friendly relations between Eng¬ 
land and Holland. 

Pupil D (66). "No, Cromwell said that British goods 
could only be carried in British ships and 
that the colonies had to trade directly with 
England or other English colonies. The Dutch 
trading boats had often been able to ship

English goods and in that way earn money. 

Now this shipping came to an end. False”. 
Pupil H (31). "He made it so that England and Hol¬ 
land could trade products together. True". 

PART II 
Item 2 . 

Among the great seamen of Elizabeths reign 
were the following: 

---Who opened up the slave trade between 

Africa and the American plantations;---- who 
was the first English mariner to sail around 

the world; ana---who explored the straits 

leading into Hudson’s Bay. 

Pupil E (56). "Slave trade? Well, the seamen of 

Elizabeth’s time were Drake, Qxenham, Frobish¬ 
er, Gilbert. But none of these started slave- 
trading if I remember correctly. Let’s see-- 
He made, three voyages 1661, 1662, 1664. What 
was his name?--Yes. It was Hawkins. 

Around the world: well, I think Drake sailed 
around the world first, started out with Ox- 
enham, saw Pacific, sailed around the West 
Coast. 

Who explored Hudson’s Strait? Gilbert went 
to Newfoundland. Oh, yes. Frobisher went in¬ 
to the Straits looking for the North-West 
passage".

PART III 

Item 5 . Martin Luther began his revolt against the 
Roman Catholic Church 

(1) towards the end of the reign of Elizabeth. 

(2) about the time of the Petition of Right, 

(3) about thirty years after Columbus discov¬ 
ered America. 

Pupil F (48). W I think it was about thirty years after 
Columbus discovered America, for it happened 
in the reign of Henry VIII, and Columbus dis¬ 
covered America in Henry VII’s reign. There¬ 
fore it must be about this time”. 

Item 9 . 

The acquittal of the seven bishops showed that 

(1) the people objected to the Exclusion Bill 

(2) the judges did not support James’ setting 
aside the Test Act. 

(3) the University of Oxford was opposed to 
the King. 

Pupil g (76). "James brought the seven bishops to trial 
because they asked to be excused from reading 
the Act of Indulgence. James had placed a 
Roman Catholic in power and the judges decided 
that the King could make exceptions to the 
Test Act which said that anyone holding office 
must take an oath according to the Church of

England. The seven bishops were acquitted 
and so I conclude that James was not support¬ 
ed in the second case". 


PART IV 

A. "1649 - Cromwell - Commonwealth from 

1. 1649 - 1660. Charles II always dated his reign 
from 1649 not 1660, when he really ascended the 
throne. Therefore Charles I was executed in 1649”. 

2. Accession of Henry VII, 1485. The Wars of the 
Roses ended at this date and Henry VII won the War 
so he must have come to the throne in 1485. 

3. Treaty of Utrecht 1713, During the reign of Anne 
who reigned 1702-1714. 

4. Defeat of Spanish Armada 1588. Elizabeth's reign 
extended during this time and over to 1603 and it 
was during her reign that the Armada was defeated 
so it must have been 1588. 

5. Bill of Rights 1688. A few months after William 
and Mary came to the throne which was in 1688. 

B. 

1. Act of Supremacy. Henry VIII passed an Act of 
Supremacy making him supreme head of the church. 
That meant the Pope could have no authority in 
England. 

2. The Non-Conformists would not conform to the Church 
of England. The Act of Uniformity was passed forc¬ 
ing everybody to attend church. Elizabeth passed

this Act, 

3. England got trading rights in America by the Treaty 
of Utrecht. She could send one ship a year to Pan¬ 
ama. She got the right to deal in slaves. 

4. No correct response. 

5. It was Drake, because he plundered the Spanish in 
his trip around South America. 

6. Shaftesbury, when he learned the King was a Catho¬ 
lic he resigned from the Cabal ministry and formed 
a Whig party opposing the Tory party. 

The above information supplied by pupils was of 
assistance in forming a basis for the analysis of the 
objective test (Paper B). Each item was examined to dis¬ 
cover what knowledge and what skill was required. A few

PART IV. 

An Examination of 95 pairs of Stud ents * Papers 
The information secured from the study of examination 
papers A and B provided a basis for examining the an¬ 
swer papers of 95 candidates. The method adopted was 
as follows: 

The papers were divided into 4 groups. 

Group I - - Paper A marks 0 - 24. 

Group II - Paper A marks 25 - 49. 

Group III - Paper A marks 50 - 74. 

Group IV - Paper A marks 75 - 100. 

Each group was subdivided into three categories : 

1. Paper A scoring above paper B. 

2. Paper A scoring equal to paper B. 

3. Paper A scoring below paper B. 

Note: 

(1. Papers A and B were considered as equal if the 
difference either way was five or less. 

2. The maximum for paper A was 100; for paper B, 
129, The scores on paper B were reduced to 100 
for purposes of comparison). 

In addition to the 95 answer papers there were avail¬ 
able the scores of 1261 candidates.

HISTORY 2. 

Section B. 

Causes of friction between England and the Colonies 
in the reign of George III were: George III tried 
to obtain the personal rule of the crown. To do this 
he had to cut down the authority of all men in power 
and who opposed the King. The next step he did was 
to get the Houses of Parliament favorable to his 
views. In order to do this he put favorites in power 
who promised to do exactly as the king wished. George 
III then tried to establish this rule in the Colon¬ 
ies. He established a Stamp Act in America, but the 
stamps and printers were soon destroyed. He set a 
tax on various articles at which the people of the 
Colonies looked with great disfavor. As a result, 
the American Colonies revolted and won their independ¬ 
ence in 1775. Never again did Britain try to tax any 
overseas empires. 

Reform Act of 1832. 

The Reform Act of 1832 was first introduced by Lord 
John Russel. It had two purposes. The first was to 
do away with rotten burroughs that had a population 
of probably several persons but which still contin¬ 
ued to send two members to Parliament. Such small 
villages were to cease sending members to Parliament. 
Populous cities also sent two members to Parliament. 
The Reform Bill arranged it so that populous cities

sent more representatives to Parliament while the 
burroughs were to cease sending. The second object 
of the Act was to allow qualified persons to vote. 

The male, twenty-one years of age, owning property 
worth sixty pounds, and paying ten pounds for rent, 
were qualified to vote. 

To execute the first object, the Act was divided 
into Schedules, with different towns in each 
Schedule. 

Section C. 

3 9. Sir Robert Peel . 

Sir Robert Peel was one of the great men in English 
History. He was a very able man, and could, even 
if his own party opposed to certain of his propos¬ 
als, see that some things would be alright for the 
country, he would try to pass it, without regard to 
the opposition. This is shown in the repealing of 
the Corn Laws. The Corn Laws were passed to stop 
importing grain unless the home grain was sold at a 
certain price. The object was to increase the rev¬ 
enue of the country but the result was nearly starv¬ 
ing the people. Peel saw that these laws would not 
do so in 1846 he repealed them. 

3 11. Career of Gladstone . 

Gladstone became a member of Parliament while yet 
very young, and there he showed his great ability. 

He rose in power very rapidly. His chief object was 
to grant Ireland Home rule. So in his first ministry

he introduced the first Great Home Rule Bill. The 
Conservatives went solidly against it and with them 
went most of the Liberals. The Bill was greatly re¬ 
jected and Gladstone resigned. However, he got in¬ 
to power again but only to introduce the Second Home 
Rule Bill and fail again. Gladstone improved the 
syststem of education and land holding in England. 

He settled various troubles of the church. 

2 Earl of Balfour . 

Earl of Balfour lived about the same time as Glad¬ 
stone. While Gladstone fought for the Home Rule of 
Ireland, the conditions in Ireland became very bad. 
Terrible assassination and murders took place. Bal¬ 
four was sent over to Ireland and there he was given 
full right to try any cases without the jury. Earl 
of Balfour was prime minister of England for a short 
time. 

Section A. 

2 4. James the Second was a Stuart King who believed that 

he ruled by divine hereditary right, but he found it 
impossible to rule without money. The only source 
of money was from Parliament. Every time he voted 
parliament for money, the parliament would ask for 
certain rights. James II would refuse and dismiss 
Parliament. James tried many other ways of obtain¬ 
ing money until both parties felt that James must go. 
Therefore in 1688 the Parliament invited William of 
Orange and Queen Mary to the throne of England.

The paper A inserted below is an example of a wide 
variation between papers A and B. The score on A is

Lies. HISTORY II 

| 2 2. Frobisher equipped a small fleet and was going to 

find a North-West passage to India. The first 
time he came back because of the lack of large 
ships. He thought he could get passed these ice¬ 
bergs with large ships. The next time he sailed 
he had larger ships. After he came to the icebergs 
he had very much trouble and the icebergs were 
damaging his ships so he sailed for home. As he 
was going home he stayed in- the smallest boat and 
it sunk in a storm. All the men were lost. 

5 4. When James II thought it was time he put Roman 

Catholics at the head of the church and army. 

The people disliked this. Then he began doing 
away with the laws of Church that Henry VIII made. 
He was slowly bring back the Roman Catholic relig¬ 
ion. The people were going to let him rule till 
his death and then his eldest daughter ( a protest- 
ant) would rule. When they heard he had a son born 
they all knew now that he must go. Seven men sent 
an invitation telling William of Orange to come and 
be there king.

countries but England seemed to stop her. England 
always wanted to unite. The Scots decided to unite 
and after much debate with the English they united. 
Scotland now became very prosperous and free and 
England began to give her colonies better Govern¬ 
ment. They sent over men to live in these countries. 
England and Scotland both became rich and strong. 

They now were both under one Parliament but had dif¬ 
ferent church laws. 

6 7. Causes of Friction were: 

1. The Navigation Act. By this act all goods going 
or coming from her colonies were to pass through Eng¬ 
land and be taxed. The colonies thought this was un¬ 
fair. They thought that a Parlt. that they had no 
representation in should not tax them. 

2. The Stamp Act. This levyed duties on all goods. 

3. The duties were being taken off and when a cargo 
of tea entered Boston harbor it was thrown into the 
sea. England closed this harbour for punishment. 

The colonies did not like this so they declared war 
on England for their independence. 

2 9. Gladstone was well educated and he became a member 

of Parliament. Soon he work up until he was Prime 
Minister. Gladstone was Prime Minister four times. 

Ke made the country prosper. Ireland was in a very 
poor condition. Gladstone tried to pass a "Home 
Rule Bill" to help the people. His "Home Rule Bills"

never passed the house of commons. 

Earl of Balfour was a very sensible man. He would 
not get mad nor he was not ambitious. He was in 
Parlt. for forty years and done many good services 
to his country. He was offered the position of 
Prime Minister but refused. The Earl of Balfour 
did not believe in letting the people govern them¬ 
selves . 

This pupil lacks ability to recall material on his own 
initiative but can do so accurately when a definite 
question is put to him. 

According to the basis laid down, the score should 
be raised from 15 to 29. 

Question 2 - raise from 2 to 7. 

There are four major items on this.question, 
the candidate states 2: 

The motive is to find a North-West passage. 
The failure. 

He also has one minor item, the difficulty 
with icebergs. 

Question 4 - raise from 5 to 7. 

The student has 3 major items: 

1. the attempt to restore Catholicism. 

2. the birth of a prince. 

3. the invitation to William of Orange. 

He adds a minor item - putting Roman Catho¬ 
lics at the head of the army and of the church.

Question 5 - raise from o to 4. 

There are 2 major items: 

1. England restrained Scotland in matters 
of trade. 

2. As a result of union both became rich 
and powerful. 

3. They were united under one parliament 
but had different church laws. 

Question 7 - raise from 6 to 7. 

The first part regarding the Navigation 
Acts and the statement of the principle 
of taxation and representation is understood. 
Question 11 - Gladstone - no change 

Balfour - raise 0 to 2. 

The pupil has a slight idea of Balfour’s 
place in history and he knows Balfour’s 
attitude to self-government 

The lack of ability of this student to organize for him¬ 
self is shown also on paper B. He misses entirely four 
of the ten items of Part II.

Results for Group II. 

Twenty-three papers were read; in category 1, 5 

category 2, 5 
category 3, 13 

The range of variation between papers A and B was 
1-39; the mean variation, 15.7. A reading of 
the A papers resulted in raising 16, leaving 4, 
lowering 3. 

The increase in marks was: range 2-20 

mean 5.4. 

There is evidence of lack of uniformity in the 
working of this group. The two papers given be¬ 
low illustrate the point. 

HISTORY II 
Section A. 

2. Drake was a notable explorer and fighter in the reign 
of Elizabeth. He led an expedition into Cadiz Bay 
and burnt two ships. He escaped unharmed and this 
was called Singeing the King of Spains Beard. 

When Spain sent her Armada against England, Drake 
was in command of a fleet of British ships. Acting 
on his suggestion they dispersed the enemy with fire¬ 
ships and by the smaller British ships getting under 
the large Spanish as the Spanish could not fire on 
them. The Spanish tried to break away southward but 
were cut off. They then sailed north thinking to

the ranks of the Spanish.

ish Colonies near Panama he looted two towns. Fear¬ 
ing capture he sailed south and rounded the southern 
end of South America and into the Pacific. He was

there he sailed west and rounding the Cape of Good 
Hope sailed back to England. He returned with but 
one ship and had been away three years and sailed 
around the world.

2 7. England and her Colonies 

The American colonies considered they were not 
getting fair treatment and set about to get their 
Independence, This they got by defeating the Brit¬ 
ish Armies. The British did not understand the 
colonial warfare. They were a long ways from sup¬ 
plies and they had no competant backing at home. 

The Colonies objected to the Navigation Laws which 
held them very rigidly. No goods could go out of 
the country except in British ships. Thus the 
colonies had no trade with other countries unless 
they transhipped to British ships. 

The English forced direct taxation on top of in¬ 
direct on the colonies despite the fact that they 
had no representation in the English parliaments. 

This was the final thing that caused the outbreak. 

4 10. Foreign Relations of Disraeli , 

Disraeli was-the son of a converted Jew of tourney. 
Despite the fact that the Jews were a hated nation 
in England, Disraeli led on till he reached the top. 

He bought shares in the Panama Canal and finaly 
had it so fixed that England contained the control¬ 
ling interest. 

Probably his greatest achievement was the Russia 
question. 

By the Treaty of San Stefano Bulgaria gave Russia 
concession in Bulgaria. Russia would have a sea

power to Russia threatened the Supremacy of Britain. 

Disraeli demanded a meeting so he arranged the 
Congress of Berlin. Despite the fact that the great¬ 
est statesmen from every country were there he had 
it all fixed very nicely for Britain before the Con¬ 
gress began. So England supremacy was assured by 
Russias losing her hold on Bulgaria.

Values Section A. 

6 1. The Court of Star Chamber was made up of members of 

the Privy Counsel. He established the Court of Star 
Chamber to deal with evils of livery and maintain- 
ance of the nobles. The nobles had been getting too 
much pay so the Court’s job was to control the pay 
so that they got only what they deserved. There had 
been cheating and too much gambling going on in the 
Government, this was also checked by the Court of 
Star Chamber. 

7 3 0 The circumstances that brought about the passing of 

the Petition of Rights were: 

1. Scotch national Covenant. 

2. King refusing to report about failure of Ille de 
Rhe expedition. 

3. Short Parliament. When King refused to give up 
no more concessions than the Ships Money tax.

Gladstone worked for Home Rule and during his admin¬

people were not having nearly enough freedom as they 
should have had. The First Home Rule Bill passed the 
House of Parliament three times but was rejected by 
the House of Lords, so the Bill was not passed. Glad¬ 
stone never gave up hope so again he started to work 
for Home Rule. .The Second Home Rule Bill was brought 
forward but was again rejected by the House of Lords 
but the bill was passed by the Parliament Act which 
stated that any act which passed the H. of C., in 
three successive times became law. Gladstone did not 
live to see the Bill passed but it was passed a few 
years after he had passed away. 

The Provisions of the Home Rule Bill: 

1. Ireland was given Home Rule.

Drakes 1 Voyages - Value 8. 

It was neither colonization nor exploration that 
brought Sir Francis Drake out on the seas. It was the 
Spanish gold ships. He would go out and rob every 
ship that he saw. On a voyage to Panama he saw the 
Pacific Ocean and decided to be the first Englishman 
to sail that ocean. He went back to England and got 
together a fleet of four ships. 

He set sail and luck was with him until he reach-* 
ed the Magellan Straits where one of his ships sank 
with all hands. Drake burned another and a third went 
back. Drake however, kept on in the w Golden Hind”. 

He sailed up the Spanish main plundering every port 
he came to. He kept this up till he got to the north¬ 
ern extremity of the Spanish main. He there saw that 
to return was certain death as the Spanish would be 
ready. 

At the point where San Francisco now stands he 
struck out westwards and returned home past Cape of 
Good Hope. In this trip he had sailed around the world 
although he had had no intention to do so at the start.

Answer 1 . -- Valued 8. 

"Henry the seventh established the Court of Star 
Chamber so that he could raise money and by so doing 
would weaken the power of the lords and nobles. After 
the Wars of the Roses he held the nobles who were not 
killed off, in the Court of Star Chamber and fined them 
and took away from them large sums of money. The Court 
of Star Chamber was the Privy Council which sat in West¬ 
minister and checked the nobles. In 1641 it was abol¬ 
ished. It did very good in the reign of Henry VII.

Answer 2 . -- Value 8. 

"Henry VII established the Court of Star Chamber be¬ 
cause the judges of the other courts were afraid of the 
nobles and if the case was a very bad one the judges 
would accept bribes from the nobles and let them off. 
Henry established this Court and he, himself, was judge 
so that any noble that did wrong could be justly pun¬ 
ished because Henry was not afraid of them. The serv¬ 
ices it rendered in his reign were:(l) It gave the King 
more power over the nobles. (2) Any noble who broke 
the law especially maintenance and livery could have his 
retainers taken away and be punished." 

Answer 5 . -- Value 20. 

"When Henry VII came to the. throne the nobles were 
divided into two parties, the Yorkists and the Lancast- 
nares. To make sure that no noble could start a war 
against him, Henry VII had a law passed that only allow¬ 
ed so many (about 50) men to be in livery on each noble’s 
place. If a noble kept more he was to be fined heavily. 
To enforce this, Henry had the Court of Star Chamber 
started made up of the Kings’ Privy Council. 

Henry VII needed money to carry on the affairs of the 
government, and not wishing to make the people dissatis¬ 
fied by placing taxes on them, he used the Star Chamber 
as a method. Anyone disobeying the laws was fined heav¬ 
ily and Henry used the fines to meet the expenses. 

The Star Chamber (1) raised money without taxation,

(2) enforced the laws, (3) lessened the power of the 
nobles and strengthened that of the King.” 

The difference between answers 1 and 2, on the one hand, 
and 3, on the other, seems to be due, not so much to a 
superior grasp by the third pupil of major items, as to 
a recall of more detail. Major items are not suffic¬ 
iently weighted in answers 1 and 2. 

The practice of putting a high value on detail is 
not, however, adhered to consistently as will be easily 
seen from two answers to Question 3.

Answer 2 — Value 10. 

"When Charles I came to the throne he was determin¬ 
ed to rule as an absolute monarch. He would call a 
parliament and ask for money. If the parliament start¬ 
ed to ask concessions of him, he refused and dissolved 
it. Seeing he could not get money that way he started 
to revive old forms of taxation. The people had no 
check on him as Charles would not call parliament. 

Due to this policy the case of John Hampden came up. 

This served to show the people how unjust the courts 
were. Finally Charles decided he wanted to send an ex¬ 
pedition to La Rochelle to aid the Huguenots. So he 
asked for a loan which he knew no one would pay. Then 
he’ proceeded to collect it by force and also to force 
men to fight. As a result of this expedition which 
was a failure, the Petition of Right was drawn up. 

This bill said that no man could be thrown in prison 
without a fair trial or cause shown; that there was to 
be no billeting of men in private houses; there was to 
be no forced loans and no more getting men for the 
army by force; no martial law in terms of peace. 

This bill was an effort on the part of the people 
to regain control over the King. When Charles proceed¬ 
ed to impeach the five members of parliament, the people 
saw that the only way to get control was to fight for 
it. This was the reason that the Great Rebellion broke 


out in 1649."

Below is an example of very severe marking. The

HISTORY II 


18 1. Henry VII established the Court of Star Chamber to 

deal with matters that could not be dealt with in 
the smaller courts. It was a high court and acted 
as a privy council. It dealt with such matters as 
Livery and Maintenaince. 

Livery and Maintenaince was: 

The large nobles obtained many men to work for them 
as servants. They bought elaborate suits for them 
and when the noble was in trouble he called on these 
servants to aid his cause. Often nobles waged wars 
upon one another just to obtain more land and power 
and these servants maintained or aided their lord and 
master. 

This is what the Court of Star Chamber dealt with 


mainly

Also the Court of Star Chamber had a great deal to 
do with the depleting of the nobles. 

Many of the nobles had been killed in the Wars of 
the Roses but those that hadn't returned to England. 
Many of these had lost much of their money also. But 
when they returned to England and started hiring serv¬ 
ants the king had them brought before the Court of 
Star Chamber, which consisted of judges chosen by the 
king. This court always did as the king wished it 
and the verdict was usually a heavy fine. 

In this way the nobles lost their money and without 
money they could do nothing and thus they lost much of 
their power. 

Often besides the nobles being heavily fined by the 
Court of Star Chamber the king took away their titles. 
Thus the Court of Star Chamber depleted many of the 
nobles and helped feudalism to die out. As well as 
aiding feudalism to die out the Court of Star Chamber 
placed money in the treasury for the country by the 
heavy finds that were exacted upon the nobles. 

The Court of Star Chamber also dealt with other cases 
among the poorer classes which the king thought was 
too important for the other courts to tend. These 
cases were nearly always a heavy find and if the per¬ 
son could not pay the find their property was seized 
and they were cast in prison. 

9 5. Before 1707 many steps had been taking to make peace

between Scotland and England. The first step was in 
the reign of Henry VII. Henry VII married his 
daughter Margaret to King James IV of Scotland. This 
brought friendly relationships between England and 
Scotland but was broken by a war. A peace treaty was 
tried to make friendship between them but was not 
strong enough. Another marriage between Edward VI of 
England and Mary Queen of Scots was arranged but 
Edward died before it was completed. War was then 
tried to bring Scotland to peace terms but this was the 
worst way in which to bring about a union and hostil¬ 
ities arose. However in 1707 it was seen that a union 
between the two countries would be a great advantage 
to both countries and the Act of Union of 1707 was 
passed. Before this both countries had had the same 
sovereign but different governments. The English had 
a parliament and the Scotch had a council. The Act of 
Union did away with these and brought England and 
Scotland under one government. England, Scotland and 
Wales were brought into one commonwealth known as 
Great Britain. The government was made up of 375 Eng¬ 
lish men, 30 from Wales and 30 from Scotland. 

Scotland however was to have freedom of religion 
and her own law in church. There were no restrictions 
against Presbyterianism. 

There were advantages secured by each country. Scot¬ 
land grew in commerce and trade. Her universities and

educational system was developed. There was to be 
free trade between England and Scotland. This start¬ 
ed much travelling and commerce and roads and ways of 
travelling were bettered. This was an advantage for 
both countries. England could now find other means 
of trading and the English people found a change by 
being able to transact business with another country 
without having to pay heavy duties. 

Thus the Union of Scotland England was a peace 
treaty and there were no disadvantages on either side. 
No land or power was gained by one country but both 
countries gained prominence. 

15 10. Disraeli was Prime Minister of England from 1874 to 

1880 and he did much for England in his Foreign 
policy. 

The most far sighted thing that Disraeli did for 
England during his ministry was the procuring of 
shares in the Suez Canal. Disraeli heard that the 
Khedive was bankrupt and selling shares of the canal. 
Disraeli immediately went to the Khedive and bought 
the majority of the shares in the canal. This gave 
England almost complete command of the canal. It 
was also on the way to Australia, New Zealand and 
India and England’s position in trade relations with 
these countries was now secure. 

Also in Disraelis ministry Turkey still held prov¬ 
inces in Austria known as Bosnia, Herzegovinia and

Romania, The Herzegovinians revolted against their 
tax gatherers. This revolt was put down hut then 
the Russians took up the side of the oppressed people 
and war ensued. Finally in 1875 the Turks were fore- 
ed to surrender and the Treaty of San Stefano was 
signed. This was a very important treaty although 
it was not allowed to be adopted. This treaty made 
Bosnia Herzegovinia and Romania independent states. 

It also made a new state of very large territory 
known as Bulgaria. Had this treaty of San Stefano 
been adopted the new was the largest and would have 
been the most powerful but at this Disraeli stepped 
in on the side of Turkey in order to preserve the 
Balance of Power. Finally however Russia was defeat¬ 
ed and a Congress was called to meet at Berlin. This 
was a meeting of the powers to settle the dispute 
but before Disraeli entered the Congress he had two 
separate conventions with Turkey and Russia. This 
was kept a secret but just before they were completed 
a newspaper published it. 

The first treaty was with Russia. 

1. In this treaty Russia agreed that the new state 
should be reduced to more moderate dimensions. 

£. England said Russia was to have Bessarabia and 
part of South Romania. 

The second treaty was with Turkey. 

In this treaty England was to protect Turkey*s

Asiatic parts and to protect the neutrality of Turkey 
England was to obtain the Island of Cyprus. 

Thus Disraeli had settled everything before the 
Congress and he knew just what would take place. The 
Congress was ended by the Treaty of Berlin in which 
none of the countries gained very much. 

1. The new state of reduced to smaller and more moder¬ 
ate dimensions. 

2. The island of Cyprus was given back. 

3. Bessarabia was also returned but Russia still had 
a part of Romania. 

The result was that the Balance of power was pre¬ 
served. 

Disraeli, throughout all his ministry tried to pro¬ 
cure friendly relationships among the European powers 
and tried to spread commerce and trade. 

10 7. The causes of friction between England and the Colon¬ 

ies in the reign of George III were: 

1. The colonies had had self government but the gov¬ 
ernor-general was sent out by the home government. 
The colonies had a local assembly that could vote 
the governor's salary and on local affairs. The 
king began to interfere with this. He said they 
had no right to do this. 

2. George III said that the other kings had not been 
interested and had let the people rule too much 
and he started to interfere with the colonies by

making them send certain raw materials only to 
England. This caused friction because the colon¬ 
ies could trade this material in great quantities 
with other countries. 

3. The king also would not let them manufacture their 
own goods. They were to ship their raw materials 
to Britain to be manufactured. 

4. He also made it so that the colonies had to ship 
their goods first to England before trading it with 
another country. This the people objected to be¬ 
cause it cost a great deal to do so. 

5. The thing which caused most friction was the Isvey- 
ing of direct taxes on the colonies. The king said 
it was to get a navy and standing army and these 
taxes were to be paid. Before this the people had 
not paid any such tax and said it was not fair be¬ 
cause they were not represented in the British Parl¬ 
iament. The king however forced them. 

6. Also a duty was put on incoming goods such as tea. 
This the colonies objected to very much and the 
Boston Tea Party was the result. A shipment of tea 
at a very low rate of duty was sent to one of the 
colonies but the colonizers would not let them un¬ 
load it and a number of men disguised as indians 
boarded it and threw all overboard.

Petition of Right of 1789 were: 

The king was Catholic and had been encouraging 
Catholicism. He had been interfering with parliament 
and going against their will. He was doing the very 
things that his father had been executed for. He 
levied taxes without consent of parliament. He had 
a declaration of indulgence passed which relieved all 
catholics from conforming. He began to place Catho¬ 
lics in the highest positions obtainable. The slight¬ 
est thing he could find wrong with anything or any¬ 
body he got rid of them and placed a Catholic in that 
position. He began to procure high judges which were 
nearly all Catholics. At this time the Fellows of 
Magdalin were to elect a new head, the king wrote to 
them to place Mr. Farmer in it. He was a strong 
catholic. The Fellows were against this but the king 
commanded and forced them to do so. The people en¬ 
dured all this for the king had no heir and when he 
died his sister Queen Mary would reign but their minds 
were changed when suddenly it was announced that a 
son had been born to the King and Queen. The people 
immediately invited William of Orange and Mary over 
from Holland to take the throne in England. 

When they came over the Petition of Right was drawn 
up. It said: 

1. The king could not levy taxes with consent of 

parliament.

2. The king could not levy loans without consent 
of parliament* 

3. The king could not have a standing army. 

4. There was to be freedom of election in Parlia¬ 
ment. 

5. There was to be freedom of speech in Parliament, 

6. The sovereign of England must be protestant. 

7. William of Orange and Queen Mary were recognized 
as joint sovereigns. 

8. The king was to have no power over the courts. 
The importance of the Petition of Right was the 

power of the king was lessened while the power of the 
people was increased. This showed that the people were 
gradually gaining power while the king was losing most 
of his power.

Values. HISTORY II 

12 5. Union of England and Scotland. 

The advantages secured by each country were: 

1. Scottish parliament and council should cease to 
exist. 

2. Trade between the two countries was to be free. 

3. No striking difference was to be noticed between 
an Englishman or a Scotsman throughout the Br. Em¬ 
pire. 

4. The union of the two countries was to be known 
as the British Empire. 

5. Scotland was to have her own Presbyterian church 
and her legal system. 

6. The two countries were to have the same govern¬ 
ment. 

There had been wars between England and Scotland 
in Charles II reign. Therefore if they were united they 
would be on friendly terms and united in order that there 
would be one empire, the Br. Empire. 

20 7. Causes of Friction between England and the Colonies. 

1. The Navigation Acts. 

Goods which were imported to or from the colon¬ 
ies was to be shipped in British or Colonial 
ships.

12 3. Petition of Right. 

1. Illegality of forced loans or taxes. 

2. Illegality of imprisonment without trial. 

3. Illegality of billeting soldiers in private 
houses. 

4. 


During Charles II f s reign Charles needed money. In 
order to get this two outstanding movements occurred. 
1. The Five Knights* Case. 

Charles needed money for the lie de'Rhe expedition 
and therefore he got it by (a) the "press” system, 
that is forcing them to give him money or else they 
were sent to prison. Five especially independent 
knights objected to this "press" system. Therefore 
they were thrown in prison. When the day came for 
their trial they were not given it and they were 
left in prison. However they were soon let go but 
not until they had agreed to his plan or idea. 
Therefore the petition of right was drawn up. 

Also during Charles II T s reign there occurred 
what was known as the "Impeachment of the Five 
Members". This was similar to the Five Knights 1 Case. 
The five members were not ready to agree to this way 
of securing money and therefore they also were im¬ 
peached. 

Importance of the Petition of Right. 

1. Prisoners could now be tried before they were put

The difference of 53 between the two papers was except¬ 
ional, the next highest difference being 27. This wide 
variation is accounted for by the fact that the candi¬ 
date did not attempt Part IY of the objective test. 

This meant a loss of 44 of the 129 marks. This is the 
only instance found in the 95 papers examined of candi¬ 
dates finding the objective test too long for the time 
allotted. 

The score on the A paper of this student was 100. This 
paper and another scored 100 are inserted to show the 
nature of an ansv^er paper accepted as completely satis¬ 
factory.

20 2. Voyage of Drake. 

His first voyages were with John Hawkins to and 
fro between Africa and Spanish colonies for the pur¬ 
pose of shipping slaves. Drake made a voyage to the 
height of land' at what is to-day the Panama penin¬ 
sula. Here he saw the Pacific Ocean and he decided 
to make a voyage into its waters. He returned to 
England to prepare for his voyage. One of his men 
left England previous to his leaving and with a ship 
and men reached the Panama. They abandoned their 
ship, crossed the height of land and reached the 
Pacific Coast. Here they constructed a ship and 
robbed pirate ships until captured and hung in a Per¬ 


uvian town

Drake left England with three or four ships, 
crossed the Atlantic ocean and sailed down the east¬ 
ern coast of South America. During this trip the men 
mutinied. They were punished severely and their lead¬ 
er hung. Drake sailed through the St. of Magellan 
and came into the Pacific waters. He sailed along the 
coast attacking Spanish treasure ships as he went. 
Drake sailed as far north as what is to day San Fran¬ 
cisco then with his ship (for two had gone hack to 
England before they entered the Sts. of Magellan) 
laiden with silver and gold he did not return the way 
he came as he feared capture by Spanish but returned 
across the Pacific through the East Indies sailing 
in the Indian ocean south to the southern extremity 
of Africa and then again in the Atlantic ocean back 
to England. Most of the treasure went to the Eng¬ 
lish coffers and for his brave journey Drake was made 
Sir Francis Drake. 

In 1588 he fought against the Spanish Armada and 
the successful defeat was due a great deal to his 
efforts. He led a land expedition against Spain at 
a later date. He made two more sea voyages against 
Spanish treasure ships. On his last voyage he be¬ 
came stricken with fever and died. He was buried in 
the ocean just off the Spanish colony of Porto Bello.

He was a stricter Catholic even than Charles II 
and considered it his duty, just like Mary, to re¬ 
establish the Catholic church in England. He treat¬ 
ed the protestant dissenters cruelly all through his 
reign. 

When Monmouth came from Holland to raise a rebel¬ 
lion against the rule of dames II he was defeated by 
Churchill, James II chief army general. Monmouth 
was executed at James orders and James sent Judge 
Jeffreys throughout England giving those suspected 
of helping Monmouth a mock trial. Over 300 persons 
were executed and over 80 were sold as slaves in the 
West Indies. James’ queen dealt in the lifes of 
these people she herself receiving some of the money 
when they had been sold as slaves. This event was 
called the n Bloody Assizes”. 

James now started placing Catholics at the head 
of his army and in civil offices contrary to the 
Test Act which stated that no catholic should hold 
any military or public office. To show off his 
power he gathered his well trained army in London. 

By this arbitrary act he lost a great deal of sup¬ 
port, 

He now tried to force a college to give up its 
right of electing its own president so that he might 
place a Catholic in the position. 

James now issued his declaration of Indulgence

which freed all protestants and Church of England 
followers from their vows. He ordered it to he read 
in all churches throughout England, Even Church of 
England bishops protested. He had them put on trial 
for sedition but they were acquitted of the charge. 
Stuart kings before had full control of the courts 
and their subjects but this incident prove that the 
Stuarts no longer exercised complete control over 
their subjects. 

James had two daughters, Mary and Anne. Mary had 
married William of Holland. The people of England 
decided to wait until James died when one of the other 
of his daughters might succeed him. James the second 
now announced the birth of a son. That was too much 
for the English people for they knew that his son 
would be as strict a Catholic as he was. The English 
parliament now sent the "Invitation” to England of 
Orange and Mary to come to England. William landed 
at England and immediately James soldiers deserted 
him for James, even his trusted general, Churchill. 
James was allowed to escape from France the bloodless 
revolution lasting only a short time. William and 
Mary were made King and Queen of England at coronation 
in 1688.

1. Emmancipation of Slaves Ac t. 

This act provided £100,000,000 to be distributed 
among slave owners as compensation for forcing 
slaves. This act completed Pitts plans of abol¬ 
ishing slaves. 

2. Factory Act 1832 . 

(1) There was to be no night duty for people under 
18 years of age. 

(2) Children from the age 9-15 years were to 
work 8 hrs. a day for six days a week. 

(5) Children from 15 years to 18 years were to 
work not more than 11 hrs. per day for six days 
a week, 

(4) Officials virere appointed to enforce this law. 
5. The Poor Law Ammendment Act 1854. 

Conditions of the labor class had been steadily 
getting worse due to the poor laws which stated 
that money would be furnished by the government 
to support him if his wages were insufficient. 

Now relief out of doors was to be given to the 
old and feeble, while able bodied men could enter 
a work-house for food and sleep but no pay. This 
act greatly reduced the number of applicants for 
relief. Officials were appointed to manage work- 
houses and enforce the law. 

4. The Dutch in Cape Colony, disliking the emmanci¬ 
pation of slaves act and other reforms moved to 
Transvaal.

He was a tory and we first hear of him with Prime 
Minister Wellington. Peel as Home Secretary when they 
repealed Test and Corporation Acts. Catholics were 
now allowed to hold any civil or military offices. 

Wellington appointed a certain Mr. Fitzgerald to 
stand for an Irish Constituency. In the bye-elect- 
ion, Fitzgerald was defeated and Daniel O’Connor a 
Catholic landowner was elected. Being a Catholic 
he was excluded’from Parliament. Wellington decided 
that the Catholic Relief Bill must be passed since a 
rebellion was rising in Ireland. It passed both 
House of parliament and although the King was opposed 
to the measure it became law. It was partly due to 
the efforts of Peel that the Bill passed. Catholics 
were now allowed to take and could hold any parlia¬ 
mentary position except; Chancellor of the Exchequer 
for England or Lord Lt. of Ireland. 

Peel became Prime Minister about the year 1840. 
Trade did not flourish at this time due to hundreds

of little duties on imported goods and exported 
goods, and also due to the Corn Laws, e.g. while 
wheat remained lower than $2,30 per bushel import¬ 
ed wheat could not enter England. The "Whigs" 
formed a committee to look into the matter. They 
handed Peel their view$ and Peel who was very broad 
minded and ambitious gave it his immediate attent¬ 
ion. 

This led to his budget of 1842. The terms of the 
Budget. 

1. The duty on corn was to be of what it formerly 
had been. 

2. Most of the duties on raw materials were abolish¬ 
ed. 

3. An income tax was to be placed on the wealth to 
make up the loss of revenue from duties on raw mater¬ 
ials. 

Due to the failure of the wheat and potato crops 
and the high price of wheat famine in Britain was un¬ 
avoidable. Peel considered the matter carefully and 
gave his views to the Cabinet. He met with so much 
opposition from it that he resigned. Lord Russell was 
asked to form a cabinet but he failed to do so. Peel 
was recalled. He immediately introduced the Corn Law 
question and with the aid of many Whigs and some 
Tories had the "Laws" repealed. At the same time he 
introduced the Corn Bill and the Customs Bill. The

Corn Bill was to gradually do away with the duty on 
corn three years to be taken in the process. The 
Customs bill was to do away with duties on manufact¬ 
ured goods. 

Since Peel had repealed the Corn Law and intro¬ 
duced the Custom Bill and Corn Bill he was carrying 
out a "Whig" policy namely "Free trade". The Whigs, 
therefore considered they had voted with a Tory long 
enough. At the same time a Tory opposition was work¬ 
ing against him. He therefore was forced to resign 
defeated in parliament at the astonishment of the 
members by 74 votes. He continued as a private member 
in the House of Commons until his death in 1850. 

20 10. Disraeli and Social legislation of the period 1874 - 

1880. 

Gladstone had lowered the National Debt and sub¬ 
sequently lowered taxes. Now Disraeli established a 
sinking fund to gradually cut down the National debt. 

A charge of £ 28,000,000 was to be payed annually. 

Domestic Legislation , 
a. Artisans Dwelling Act. 

Corporations in towns with a population of over 
25,000 people were given the right to correct out of 
date homes and charge it to the owner or to offer 
the owner a price for his home, improve it and rent 
it out. The idea was to give a good home for the 
middle class at a minimum cost.

b. Workmans Act, 

This act followed immediately after a strike. It 
stated that; 

1. Peaceful picketting was to be allowed, i.e., a 
striker could persuade a fellow worker in a peaceful 
way to leave his employment. 

2. Legal action done by one workman was not consider¬ 
ed illegal when done by a number of persons. This 
act established the Labor Unions giving them a great 
deal more scope. 

c. Merchant Shipping Act. 

Some ship owners were overloading poor ships. The 
result was that many lives were lost unnecessarily. 
Plimsol, a member of the House of Commons, had been 
working against this overloading of ships for 25 years. 
Now the Board of trade was given the right to stop 
unseaworthy craft. The Plimsol line was established 
above which ships must not load. 

Factory Act . 

This was not another act but just a consolidation 
of previous acts into one clever code. Disraeli 
published his novel, Sybil, which depicted the life 
and existing conditions in factories.

HISTORY II. 

• Developments Which Led to Revolution of 1688 . 

The aims of James II, when he became the King of 
England, were to rule as an absolute monarch and to 
reestablish the Roman Catholic religion in England. 

It was this policy and the gradual unfolding of it 
that led directly to the Revolution. 

I. Ruling as an Absolute Monarch . 

(A) Monmouth's Rebellion: 

(1) Four months after James II came to the throne 
of England, a rebellion broke out under the Duke of 
Monmouth, illigitimate son of Charles II. 

(2) Monmouth came to England from Holland, bring¬ 
ing a small army of Dutch with him. He proceeded 
through the country, his cause attracting some Eng¬ 
lish adherents. At Taunton he was crowned king of 
England. 

(3) Monmouth was finally defeated severely at 
Sedgemoor by James T forces and his army was scattered. 
Monmouth was executed and as many of his followers 
who could be found were severely punished and put to 
death under the juridiction of the "Bloody Assizes". 

(B) Bloody Assizes : 

(1) In order to quel any further uprisings of the 
people against his rule, and to punish those who had 
risen to aid of Monmouth in his rebellion, James es¬ 
tablished a series of court trials, under Chief Justice 
Jeffries, called the "Bloody Assizes", because of the

harsh, inhuman treatment many people received at the 
hands of this court. 

(2) Trials were held in many towns, and altogether 
324 people were executed, for nearly everyone who was 
brought up for trial was found guilty. 841 people 
were sent as slaves to the West Indian Plantations 
and to various other countries as slaves. 

(3) Perhaps, what roused the people most of all 
was the fact that the courtiers and even the queen re¬ 
ceived a good deal of money from the sale of these 
slaves. The people bitterly resented the fact that 
the king controlled the courts. 

(C) Camp at Hounslow Heath . 

(1) In order to awe the people and to show the 
power of the king so that there would be no further 
uprising, James placed an army of 13,000 men, at 
Hounslow heath, outside of London. 

(2) This camp had very little effect, as the 
people were entirely unafraid of the soldiers and did 
not show any inclination to be awed by them. The 
soldiers were friendly, and really no good came of 
this camp. However, it showed the power of the king 
could be shown. 

11. James f Attempt to Restore Catholicism . 

(A) Violation of Test Act : 

(1) James gave Colonel Hales a position in the 
Army, and as Hales was a Catholic had him persecuted

under the Test Act, As the Courts were under the con 
trol of the King, they decided that the King could 
appoint him to any position in the Army he liked. 

(2) Thus a precedent was established, and it show 
ed the people they could hope for no redress in the 
Courts, or hope to stay the kings’ autocracy. 

(3) Next James placed Obadiah Walker, a Catholic 
as head of the University of Oxford. The students 
and the whole country were horrified. 

(4) Next James placed John Massey as head of the 
Cathedral which is a part of Oxford College. This, 
too, roused the Countries’ anger. 

(5) James tried to make Jesuit Father Peter his 
confessor and a Catholic the next Archbishop of Cant¬ 
erbury. The Pope refused to allow Peter to take 
office. 

(6) The Fellows of Magdalen College were going to 
elect a man as head of their institution, when James 
sent a letter ordering them to allow Anthony Farmer, 
a Popist to have the position. As the King had no 
right to interfere, the Fellows refused, and James 
became so angry he turned all but two outside their 
own building. 

(7) James had issued a declaration of Indulgence 
in 1687, but no attention was paid to it. 

(8) Therefore in 1688 he issued a Second Declar¬ 
ation of Indulgence relieving all Non-Conformists

from the penalty of the law. He ordered this to he 
read in all the Churches and Seven Bishops refused to 
do so. 

(9) The Trial of the Seven Bishops was held, and 
greatly to the peoples 1 joy they were found not guil¬ 
ty by 7 out of 12 judges. 

(10) James dismissed Dr. Crompton from office when 
he refused to take action against a minister who had 
preached against the spread of Catholicism. 

III. The Birth of A Prince . 

(1) By his former wife, Anne Hyde, James had two 
daughters Mary and Anne. They had married Protestants, 
and were themselves of the same faith. Mary had 
married William III of Orange, and it was hoped by the 
people, that, as they were Protestants, they would be 
the next rulers. 

(2) However, in 1688, by a second wife a son was 
born to James ? and as all chance of a Protestant suc¬ 
cession was destroyed the foremost men of England sent 
over to William and Mary a message that they were to 
be the next rulers. 

20 5. The Union of England and Scotland - 1707 . 

(A) Causes . 

(l) Although the two countries had been joined 
under one king, James I, they had each a separate 
parliament, and James could, therefore, accept advice 
from either parliament. A great deal of strife broke 
out among the two countries.

(2) In 1698, the Scotch had tried to found a 
Colony on the Ishmus of Dorien, and as it was a dis¬ 
astrous failure, the failure was blamed upon the non¬ 
support of England. 

(3) Under the Navigation Laws of 1651 and 1660, 
the Scots were treated as a foreign country, and the 
development of their trade was greatly hindered. 

(4) In 1702, an Act was passed in the Scottish 
Parliament declaring the Scots would, on the death of 
Anne, choose a sovereign other than the one in Eng¬ 
land. Although this act foreshadowed the breakup of 
her inheritance Anne, as a Constitutional Monarch, 
had to allow it to pass. 

(5) This Act would have entirely severed any re¬ 
lations between England and Scotland, and as either 
a complete union or separation was necessary, the 
British drew up on Act of Union, which, after a great 
deal of difficulty passed both houses in Scotland and 
England. 

(B) The Terms of the Act . 

(1) England and Scotland were to be united under 
one government called the Commonwealth of Great Britain. 

(2) The Scottish Parliament was abolished. 

(3) The Scots were to send one hundred members 
to the House of Commons in London, and twenty-five 
members to the House of Lords. The Members for the 
House of Commons were to be elected by means of Con¬ 
stituencies.

(4) The Scots could maintain their own legal 
system. 

(5) They could have religious freedom. 

(6) There was to be entirely free trade in 
Scotland. 

(7) There was to be no legal difference between 
Scots and English throughout the Empire. 

(c) Advantages for Britain . 

(1) The Act insured that there would no longer 
be a hostile band in the North of the Country, and 
no longer any rebellions. No more parliamentary 
struggles. 

(2) This was fortunate for Britain could now de¬ 
vote all her time in fighting foreign countries not 
her own neighbors. 

(3) The great Hudson Bay Territory in Canada 
was really administered by canny Scotsmen. 

(D) Advantages for Scotland . 

(1) Owing to the taking away of trade restriction, 
Scottish trade prospered. 

(2) The Lowlands of Glasgow were greatly increas¬ 
ed in wealth by the free export of wool. 

(3) Scots now had the opportunity of making the 
Nation great, and many rose to hold high positions 
in England and the Colonies. 

(4) The Scots now had freedom of Religion. 

On the whole this treaty was entirely satisfactory for 
both nations, and brought all the above beneficial re¬ 


sults .

20 8. Legislation of Reform Parliament of 1852 . 

(A) The first Act passed was one whereby all Slaves 
in the British Empire were set free. As compensat¬ 
ion, the above owners were given a grant of £20,000- 
000 from the British government, to be divided among 
them. This was passed in 1833. 

(B} Poor Law Amendment Act - 1854 . 

(1) Up to the year 1833, a great deal of money 
had been paid out by the government in order to aid 
the many paupers who had come to being in the many 
changes from the Napoleonic Wars onward. In order 
to remedy this a Poor Law Amendment Act was passed. 

(2) Terms : 

1. Poor Law Commissioners were appointed to 
look after the administration of relief in all the 
affected districts. 

2. Poor Law Guardians were appointed to look 
after the raising and administering of all money 
used in poor relief. 

3. The policy of these Poor law guardians 
and Commissioners was to give outdoor relief only to 
the aged and infirm. Other people could only obtain 
relief by entering a workhouse and performing a cer¬ 
tain amount of labor there. 

(C) Factory Act - 1855 . 

(1) All night work for people under 18 years of 
age in textile factories was forbidden.

(2) People between the years of nine and thirteen 
could only work forty-eight and a half hours per week. 

(3) People between the years of 13 and 18, could 
only work 68-J- hours per week. 

(4) Government officials were appointed to see 
that these provisions were carried out. 

(D) By an Act in 1833--the Charter of the East India 
Company was renewed but it could no longer engage in 
trade. Henceforth, it was only to be a great govern¬ 
ing body, administering the justice and government of 
that vast British possession--India. 

(E) In 1833, an Education Act was passed whereby the 
British government was to advance the sum of £20,000 
for the education of poor children. 

Note : 

This administration was indeed very helpful and 
did a great deal of good for the Empire as a whole, 
for it insured the British people a great many new 
Reforms which were entirely beneficial. These Reforms 
were carried out under the Whig party of Earl Grey. 

20 10. Social Legislation of Disraeli - 1874-80 . 

(A) An Act was passed empowering Municipal author¬

with over 25,000 population could purchase by force 
the sites of all unsanitary buildings. These sites 
were used for the building of small, fully up-to-date 
houses for the use of artisans. 

(2) This Act met with much opposition, but none 
the less it remained law. 

(C) The Employers and Worksmen’s Act - 1878 . 

(1) By this it was provided that an Act done by 
an individual was legal when done by a group of men. 
Thus the trade unions which were just coming into 
force at that time were exempted from punishment. 

(2) This Act also provided for the legality of 
"peaceful picketing" whereby a group of men could per¬ 
suade another man not to work for a certain person. 

(D) Navigation and Shipping Act - 1875 . 

(1) Most people did not send ships to sea in an 
unseaworthy condition, but in order to collect the 
insurance oh wrecked ships many did. 

(2) Some people did also send ships to sea over¬ 
loaded. Finally after a good deal of work on the 
part of Plimsoll, it was brought to the governments 
attention and an act was passed to remedy it. 

(3) Terms of Act : 

a. The board of trade could stop all unseaworthy 
and overloaded ships from leaving harbor. 

b. The "Plimsoll line", the mark above which a 
ship must not load was established.

(E) Factories and Workship's Act - 1876 . 

(1) An Act was finally passed, after Lord Shotes- 
bury had labored a lifetime to bring it about, where¬ 
by all the former laws and legislations, concerning 
factories were consolidated in one clear, concise 
code of law. Much credit for the Act should however 
go to Mr. Cross, the Home Secretary, and Disraeli, 
the Prime Minister. 

20 1. Why Henry VII established the Court of Star Chamber : 

(1) There was entirely no order in England; the 
judges were not paid and would not administer justice 
fairly as they would accept bribes from any one. 

(2) Henry VII therefore instituted a wage to be 
paid by the government to the judges, and also es¬ 
tablished the Courts known as Circuit Courts which 
travelled about the Country administering justice. 

(3) Also, in order to maintain and keep justice in 
the Country.Henry VII instituted the Court of the 
Star Chamber. 

(4) Many of the Nobles were rising up in rebellion, 
and as a result, a court whereby they could be fined, 
the Star Court Chamber, was established. 

(5) The Middle Class, then growing very powerful, 
was looked upon with distrust by the King, and he al¬ 
so used this Court to fine them. 

(6) In order to recuperate the treasury of the King, 
Henry VII established this Court whereby many of the

nobles were fined by many of the old laws and customs 
which the king revived. This Court was absolutely 
under the control of the King, and, as Henry knew 
this he took every advantage offered by it. 

(7) Henry wished to make his throne secure, and by 
trying all who rose against him in this king's Court 
he kept his position supreme in England. 

(8) Because Henry desired to keep down the middle 
class which had risen up after the Wars of the Roses, 
he established this Court whereby they could be kept 
in check. 

The Services It Rendered in His Reign . 

(A) Kept Nobles In Check . 

(1) Because whenever Henry VII desired to check 
some ambitious baron, by making him pay a goodly sum 
of money under the old feudal customs and tenures 
the Court would always support the King and force the 
Baron to pay should he refuse. 

(2) Prosecuted severely all who rose against the 
King, and it thus discouraged rebellions. 

(b) Helped Recuperate Treasury . 

(1) Because of the fact that Henry VII T s court 
of the Star Chamber was under his control, it did not 
hesitate to force loans and fines upon both the Upper 
and Middle classes. Thus, by these fines the treas¬ 
ury was greatly increased. 

(C} Kept Order in England . 

(1) By putting down the Nobles as afore mentioned

(5) To put down ambition nobles. 

In the reign of Henry VII there were many nobles 
who had great power and many retainers these 
nobles the ordinary courts were afraid to punish 
so Henry set up the Court of Star Chamber to deal 
with the evils of livery and maintenance, this 
court was not afraid to punish the nobles and 
they were fined severly. 

(6) Henry had to get money and he used this Court of 
Star Chamber to produce terrific fines from the 
nobles. He also made forced loans benevolenses 
and purvayences. When he died he left a well 
filled treasury. 

16 3, Causes of Petition of Right. 

(1) Charle f s Character: he could not be trusted and 
he believed in the divine right of kings and that he 
was always in the right. 

(2) His marriage with Henrietta Marie of France a 
Roman Catholic people thought the Reformation settle¬ 
ment in danger. 

(3) Money troubles. The value of money had fallen 
and Charles got little more than Elizabeth and parlia¬ 
ment would not give him more until Buckinghams affairs 
were investigated and this Charles would not stand 
for. 

(4) Buckingham took an expedition to help the Hugen- 
aughts at La Rouchell and this was a failure and

Buckingham assassinated on the way home. 

(5) The Five Knights Case 

When Charles was getting money for Buckinghams 
expedition he asked for forced loans and five knights 
refused they were thrown into prison and not given a 
fair trial and although they soon got out the king 
had established the precident of doing as he wished 
with the property and bodies of his subjects. 

Charles I believed in the divine right of kings 
and said that he was free from all responsibility 
and he said as well that his ministers also were free 
from blame or responsibility. Thus the hands of the 
nation were tied. The law courts were all bribed as 
shown when John Hampden was tried for not paying 
ship money and the judges said. The levy of ship 
money on his estate was legal in an emergency and the 
king was judge of an emergency. This is also shown 
in the five knights case where the king established 
the precident of doing as he wished with the bodies 
and property of his subjects. Thus the courts were 
controlled by the king and, if the king and his min¬ 
isters were free from responsibility the people could 
not get at the king in that manner so they drew up a 
petition of right and made Charles sign it. 

The terms were. 

(1) There was to be no taxes levied without the con¬ 
sent of parliament.

(2) That no man could be put in prison without a 
fair trial. 

(3) There was to be no martial laws in time of peace. 

(4) There was to be no billeting of soldiers in 
private houses. 

All these laws Charles had been breaking and by 
signing the Petition he swore to keep them but he did 
not as showen when he levied Ship Money a tax to be 
levied on coastal towns only in time of an emergancy 
and when parliament could not be called and to be 
used on the navy only. Charles levied it in time of 
peace when there was time to call parliament and when 
there was no emergancy but he did use it for the navy. 
Thus we see that Charles could not be trusted as 
shown when he was found to be in secret communication 
with the Irish Rebles. 

Section B. 

18 5. The first step in the Union of Scotland and England 

was when Henry VII married his daughter Margret to 
Jas IV of Scotland and then when Henry VIII and later 
Somerset proposed that Edward VI should marry Mary 
and entered Scotland because the Scots were not quick 
enough. The next step was when James of Scotland 
became James I of England and after the civil war and 
revolution of 1688 both countries were under the same 
gov f t and the Scots advised the king to do one thing 
while the English advised another so that it was

clearly seen that the two countries would have to 
completely unite a separate as shown when the Scots 
pass a bill which said they would choose a king dif¬ 
ferent than the English when Anne died, the Scots 
were angry with the English for: 

(1) Failure of their Colony on Ismus of Durien. 

(2) Navigation Acts hindered their trade. 

So Union was arranged in a free parliament and the 
following treaty was drawn up. 

(1) The two countries united under the name of Great 
Britain. 

(2) The Scots were to keep their own law systems. 

(3) The Scots to keep their own religion. 

(4) No legal differences were to be made between 
Scots and English. 

(5) Trade was to be free. 

Both countries were thus satisfied and the Scots 
trade increased by freedom from Navigation Acts and 
the English had the help of the Scots in their colon¬ 
ies etc., as it was arranged a free treaty no hard 
feeling resulted between the Scots and English. 

18 7. Sir Robert Walpole had been a very good colonial 

minister and had left the colonies to rule them¬ 
selves with a Legisative Assembly and a governor 
elected at home, he had also passed Rice and Sugar 
Acts giving them freedom from the Navigation Acts. 
When George III came to the throne he had the idea

keep up the army that protected them if they had 
been allowed to tax themselves but when they were 
taxed by a parliment in which they that no represent¬ 
ation whatsoever they did not like it. 

(5) The Boston Tea Party. 

An English ship laden with tea on which George III 
had put a tax cams into Boston harbor and some men 
dressed as Indians came on board the ship and threw 
all the tea into the harbour. For this the English 
took away the charter of Mass, and closed the Boston 
Harbor. 

(6) The Boston Massacre. 

In Boston there was a riot over the Stamp and Tea 
Acts and the British troops killed two or three people

the story grew until it was the Boston Massacre. 

(7) At last the colonists were so angered they de¬ 
clared their Independence and the war ensued.

Social Legisation of Disraeli. 

I. Finance. 

(1) Disraeli established a new sinking fund to re¬ 
duce the national debt. 

(2) He reduced the income tax from 3d on the £ to 
2d on the £. 

II Domestic Legislation. 

(1) The Artisan T s Dwelling Act which said that any 
large town had the right to buy and tear down any un¬ 
sanitary houses and build new small ones for the work¬ 
ing classes. There was much opposition to this as it 
was thought that it would separate and divide the 
classes of people. 

(2) The merchants shipping act which said. 

1. That no unseaworthy ship would be allowed 
to leave port. 

2. That no ship was to be allowed to be load¬ 
ed above the Plimsoll water mark. This act was to 
prevent the great number of disaters from unseaworthy 
ships at sea. 

(3) The Factory Workmans Acts. 

This combined all the factory acts that had

one coherent code. This was chiefly the great aim 
of Shatesbury. 

(4) The Employer T s Workman’s Act. 

1. This said that if it was legal for one man 
to strike it was legal for all men to strike. This 
encouraged strikes trade unions etc. 

2. "Peacefull Picketting" or the advising of 
one man by another to stop working for a certain

The Results, 


1* The Results indicate a tendency on the part of 
readers to mark down the candidates whose papers 
give the general impression of being poor as is the 
case with those of Group I, and to favour candi¬ 
dates in Group IV. 

This, admittedly, assuipes that the investigat¬ 
or re-assessed the papers accurately. That is dif¬ 
ficult to substantiate inasmuch as the marking 
could not be proven to be purely objective. How¬ 
ever, it is reasonable to claim that there would be 
greater uniformity in the marking of 95 papers, 
when the work was done by one person, and under con¬ 
ditions where there was no sense of time pressure; 
than there would be when done by possibly eight or 
ten different persons working under less favorable 
conditions. 

2. There is evidence of considerable variation among 
examiners as to what constitutes a perfect answer 
to a question. 

5 0 It is apparent that not sufficient distinction is 
made between major and minor items of information.

Conclusions. 

1. An objective type test measures both informational 
and developmental skills as well as does our essay 
type test. 

2. An objective test covers as much subject matter as 
does an essay test. 

3. An objective test lends itself to a better distri¬ 
bution over the subject matter prescribed than 
does an essay test. 

4. An objective test measures with greater accuracy 
than does an essay test. 

5* An objective test does not assess a candidate’s 
ability to express ideas in acceptable language. 

It is doubtful, however, if there is any advantage 
from this point of view in an essay test which is 
written under strain and in which the ansv;ers are 
valued without reference to English or spelling. 

6. An objective test does not measure as well as an 
essay type test could, a pupil’s ability to organ¬ 
ize material about a given topic. 

Recommendations. 

A composite test might be the most satisfactory way 
of testing candidates in history. A one-hour test con¬ 
sisting of about one hundred items of an objective 
nature distributed over the entire field could be com¬ 
bined with a one-hour test of an essay type. The latter

might consist of a choice of two of^ur questions sub¬ 
mitted* These questions should be so constructed that 
all would require of the candidate equal knowledge and 
equal skill, and that they would make it necessary for 
him to organize the material he had learned around a 
topic other than those dealt with specifically in the 
text book* That is, the questions should be drafted 
with a view to making it impossible for the candidate 
to offer as an answer, material organized and arranged 
by the teacher. Qf the eleven questions offered on 
Paper A (1931) six required no independent organization 
whatever on the part of the candidate* In so far as 
that is the case, the essay type test fails to fulfil 
the purpose to the achievement of which it is, in the 
opinion of its apologists, an indispensable condition*
