INTRODUCTION 


In recent years considerable attention has been given 
the origins and evolution of the Alberta Social Credit 
movement. As yet, however, there has been little emphasis 
on the legislative accomplishments of the Alberta Social 
Credit government. It is the object of this thesis, there¬ 
fore, to examine that portion of Alberta legislation 
which may be classified generally as the peculiar con¬ 
tribution of the Social Credit government. 

In view of the prevailing limitations, it has been 
found necessary to limit the scope of this analysis to 
the purely social credit legislation, the Alberta debt 
legislation (both private and public), the taxation 
legislation and those miscellaneous acts of the Alberta 
legislature which have no parallels in the statutes of 
other Canadian provinces. This legislative survey will 
be conducted with reference to Alberta f s background of 
economic, political and social development and in the 
light of the social credit philosophy and its interpret¬ 
ation by the leaders of the Alberta Social Credit 
movement. 

Social movements spring up in times of social unrest; 
in times when a profotmd and widespread dissatisfaction 
with the existing social order is prevalent. The engine 
of every social movement is its philosophy. This

philosophy usually provides the members of the movement 
with a two-fold psychological satisfaction: (l) some sort 
of explanation of the social collapse and, (2) a set of 
reform proposals which, soon or late, they will come to 
recognize as absolutely essential if social reconstruction 
is to be achieved• The philosophy of social credit offered 
these two psychological handouts to many of Alberta*s 
indebted and unemployed citizens during the 1930*s. As it 
was presented by William Aberhart, social credit became 
a device which would restore prosperity to a harassed 
community ?#hich had suffered the social consequences of 
a six-year depression* It is precisely because the Alberta 
social credit movement illustrates so completely the 
various conditions under which a social philosophy may 
become an instrument for achieving political power that 
it has been accorded so much attention by the social 
psychologist and sociologist* 

But after a mass social movement achieves political 
power it tends to become institutionalized. The leaders of 
the movement who were once reformers now become admin¬ 
istrators. At this point conflict arises between those 
members of the movement who are charged with the day-to- 
day administration of affairs and those who expect to see 
the application of the principles on which the movement 
is based. If the leaders of the movement possess sufficient 
authority and are able to maintain control^party unity and 
solidarity may be purchased simply by the expulsion of

the recalcitrant "radicals” or "insurgents". But, on the 
other hand, if the leaders of the movement do not possess 
sufficient control over their followers there is likely to be 
party disruption and revolt which in some cases might con¬ 
ceivably lead to a change in party leadership. 

Curiously the dynamics of Alberta Social Credit between 
1935 and 1938 fitted into neither of the categories 
mentioned above. Rather, there was the hybrid situation 
where Mr. Aberhart and some of his followers possessed a 
virtual unlimited control over the vast majority of the 
movement and almost no control over the members represent¬ 
ing th^bmajority in the legislature. The practical results 
of this situation, as they vitally affected government 
policy, produced excitement, confusion, inconsistency and 
incoherence. It is only when these considerations are 
brought to mind that a reasonable interpretation can be 
put upon much of early Social Credit legislation. 

In a highly emotional atmosphere during the year 1937 
the Alberta government attempted to implement a provincial 
social credit system. This attempt was a failure because 
of constitutional reasons, because the Social Credit party 
was violently disunited and because large numbers of Albertans 
were fanatically opposed to such a scheme. For a short 
period during 1937 the policy of the Alberta government was 
forged by Major C.H. Douglas, Fig Tree Court, London, 

England and effectuated by his two"technical envoys" in 
Alberta.

But from this early period of crises, bitterness and 
disunity there emerged a party which gradually obtained 
unity within its ranks and some measure of respect from 
its opponents. While the Alberta Social Credit government 
was unable to fulfil its election promises with regard to 
social credit, it did enjoy considerable success in other 
legislative spheres. Though complete substantiation of 
this statement is not attempted in the following pages, 
it is hoped that the evidence presented in the case of 
school and municipal reorganization and public debt 
reorganization will leave no doubts on this point. 

Thus far, most discussion of Social Credit legislation 
has been confined to the legal consequences of the acts of 
the Alberta legislature. Undoubtedly this emphasis has 
been due to the spectacular nature of the constitutional 
clash between the Dominion of Canada and the province of 
Alberta during the ten year period from 1937 to 1947. 

While little discussion of this facet of the problem will 
be found in the ensuing pages, it is worth while remember¬ 
ing that the political consequences of the abortive Alberta 
social credit experiment were not confined to the province 
alone. One thing, surely, is clear: the consequences of 
the Alberta-Dominion clash have effected a good deal of 
clarification as to the essence of modern Canadian federalism.

CHAPTER I 


THE PHILOSOPHY OF SOCIAL CREDIT 








-I- 


The founder of the social credit movement. Major C.H. 
Douglas, was a Scottish engineer who became acutely aware 
that certain projects physically possible in the engineer¬ 
ing sense were often financially impossible , especially 
during certain phases of the business cycle, and who set 

forth to establish an economic theory of permanent under- 
1 

consumption. 

From the economic point of view, the philosophy of 
social credit interprets the instability of capitalism 
and suggests a purely monetary remedy; from the ethical- 
political point of view, social credit attempts to inter¬ 
pret the role of the individual in the modern democratic 
industrial state. The success and continued appeal of 
social credit must be understood not merely by the 
materialism of its proposals for the reformation of 
capitalism, but also by the idealism of its interpret¬ 
ation of the rights of man. 

Social credit theory maintains that existing systems, 

either capitalist or socialist, fail to provide the 

individuals in the community with that share of purchasing 

2 

power to which they are entitled. The mechanism which 

(1) Douglas had for some years represented the Westing- 
house corporation in the East where he had been on 
friendly terms with financial officials of the govern¬ 
ment of India. During World War I he was assistant 
director in England of the Royal Aircraft Works where 
he conducted extensive cost studies. 

(2) This proposition was put forward during the 1920*s 
when many economists believed that the economic 
system could not suffer from a general deficiency 
of purchasing power.

operates constantly to deprive the individual of his 

proper share of purchasing power originates in the 

financial system, through its control by the hanks, of 

the credits issued against the wealth of the community. 

The producer is dependent on the banks for his money to 

cover the costs of production; he pays that money out in 

wages, salaries and dividends. But he must get back 

through the price mechanism sufficient money to repay the 

bank together with the interest and his own profit. Hence, 

it is argued, the prices of all commodities exceed the 

purchasing power distributed through wages, salaries and 

dividends. Finally, when the producer repays the bank, 

that money is used to cancel the debt and the system 

3 

loses more purchasing power. 

Douglas is able to draw these conclusions with ease 
because first, he assumes that bank loans are indefinitely 
expandable, and second, he states that producers are 
always dependent on the banks for funds to finance capital 
expansion. It is clear that both of these assumptions are 
unrealistic. 

In the first place Douglas ignored the dependence of 
bank loans on their ratio to bank cash; he failed to 
appreciate that the bank f s indebtedness was immediate, 
while the debtors indebtedness was in the future, and

that some individuals would always be required to save 
to repay loans in order that the banks could always meet 
their current liabilities. By assuming that bank loans 
could be expanded infinLtely, Douglas was arguing, in effect, 
that capital expansion could take place without saving. 

In that way the banks could control the general level of 
business activity with an eye to their own profits. 

But it is clear that this is an improper interpretation 
of the function of banks in the economic system. Banks do 
not control the level of business activity although they 
base their business decisions partly on what they consider 
to be the future trends in business activity. The activit¬ 
ies of banks can be regarded, therefore, as one of the 
factors which either accentuate or mitigate a given 
cyclical trend. 

In the second place, Douglas appears to have missed 
the true significance of the changing relations between 
industry and finance. By assuming that the banks will 
always finance capital expansion, he has fashioned a 
causal relationship between the financial and industrial 
structures. Douglas neglects the fact that large corp¬ 
orations conduct saving programmes by building sinking 
funds. Instead of a tendency towards industrial dependence 
on the banking or financial structure, we note a trend 
towards increasing independence, especially as the result

of the financial policies of large corporate units. And 
the sinking funds held by many corporations do not usually 
represent immobilized purchasing power— 

they 

may be loaned to other institutions, or they may be 
invested in securities, both the latter increasing the 
rate of investment. And finally, Douglas neglects to 
recognize that as the average size of the business unit 
increases, a greater proportion of financing will be 
possible through the sale of stocks and bonds to the 
public. 

Two conclusions may be drawn from this discussion: 

(1) if the banks were continually destroying the credits 
through the repayment of loans, as Douglas suggests, the 
net result would be either a stationary volume of credit 
or a diminishing volume of credit; and (2) if a permanent 
gap between prices and purchasing power did exist there 
would be a constant contraction of production as entre¬ 
preneurs attempted to reduce their prices to the volume 
of purchasing power available to buy all their goods. 

Under conditions of perfect competition prices would tend 
to be constantly reduced in order to clear the market; 
under conditions of imperfect or monopolistic competition 
production would tend to be cut until the market could 
remove the output.

But Douglas maintains that this constant deficiency 
of purchasing power results not only from the control of 
finance by the banks, but also from the operations of 
industry itself. This is the principle of the f, A plus B ft 
theorem, described by Douglas as follows: 

11 A factory or other productive organization has, 
besides its economic function as a producer of goods, 
a financial object—it may be regarded on the one hand 
as a device for the distribution of purchasing power 
to individuals through the media of wages, salaries 
and dividends; and on the other hand as a manufactory 
of prices—financial values. From this standpoint its 
payments may be regarded as two groups: 

Group A: All payments made to individuals (i.e. wages, 
salaries, etc.). 

Group B: All payments made to other organizations 
(i.e. raw materials, bank charges and other external 
costs). 

Now the rate of flow of purchasing power to individuals 
is represented by A, but since all payments go into 
prices, the rate of flow of prices cannot be less than 
A and B. Since A will not purchase A and B a proportion 
of the product at least equivalent to B must be 
distributed by a form of purchasing power which is not 
comprised in the description grouped under A." 4 

What this theorem purports to show is that the A payments, 

which are said to make up the total purchasing power of 

the community are not collectively sufficient to cover 

the prices of all the current output. If under normal 

conditions the existence of this gap between prices and 

purchasing power is disproved, the theorem is disproved. 

Now Douglas conceived the B payments as mere !1 book- 
keeping arrangements n among producers entirely apart from 
the consumer sphere. Further, he did not distinguish

between consumer goods and capital goods. Thus he could 
argue, consumers* incomes will not buy all the products. 
While it is clear that consumers* incomes will not be 
sufficient to purchase all the capital goods, this does 
not mean that they will not be purchased. Clearly they 
will be bought by the consumer goods industries with B 
payments. These payments will go to pay wages, salaries 
and dividends in the capital goods industries and so 
they become A payments and are paid out into the consumer 
stream. Douglas attempted to evade this argument by claim¬ 
ing that the B payments were distributed to the public in 

advance of production and that consequently they could 

6 

not be used to refute the **A plus B** proposition. 

Now in any one complete isolated process this might 
be the case but over the system as a whole, with its over¬ 
lapping advance payments, it cannot obtain. By and large, 
today*s advance payments available for spending should 
be able to buy today*s production, while tomorrow*s pro¬ 
duct will be purchased by other advance payments. In a 
word, Douglas failed to prove through his"A plus B** 
theorem that a constant or increasing deficiency of 
purchasing power relative to prices exists.

Money (London, 1933) Chapter Till TI Four Monetary 
Heretics**, by H.T.N. Gaitskell, p.356. 

(6) Douglas indicated, for example, that in the capital 
goods industries wages and salaries formed a relative¬ 
ly small part of costs; that most of the costs of 
capital production are paid back to the banks to pay 
off the large debts incurred in such production.

Another important aspect of Douglas 1 analysis was that 

as industry became more mechanized the importance of 

7 

depreciation charges in the B payments increased. That 
is, increased mechanization implies an increased rate of 
investment and saving. He admitted that investment expend¬ 
itures would be distributed in part as wages, salaries and 
dividends in the capital goods industries during the pro¬ 
duction stage, but he maintained that the end result of 
an increased rate of investment was tp place capital 
goods in the system against which there was no distribution 
of purchasing power. 

Douglas did not mean that saving by consumers would 
result in a lack of purchasing power for consumers' goods 
and cause decreased output in those industries. He assumes 
that consumers' savings go directly into capital goods, 
that the new capital goods cause greater depreciation 
charges through the B payments, and that costs increase. 

It is evident, however, that a certain amount of B pay¬ 
ments through depreciation would become A payments when 
the machines were replaced. It is also possible that 
increased mechanization would reduce costs and induce a 
fall in prices. While it is true that large depreciation 
sums held by one firm appear to represent immobilized 
purchasing power, yet this is actually true only when 
such unused funds are neither placed in a bank nor 

(7) u The source of the discrepancy to begin with is in the 
process of investment...The deficiency in this sense 
is therefore traced to the act of saving and invest¬ 
ment, which creates fresh values which must enter into 
costs” G.D.H. Cole, Qp. Cit ., p. 357.

Douglas disagrees with Keynes that ”The outstanding 
faults of (our) economic society...are its failure to pro¬ 
vide for full employment and its arbitrary and inequitable 

9 

distribution of wealth and incomes”. In presenting 
evidence before the Agricultural Committee of the Alberta 
Legislature, April 6th, 1934* he declared: 

”Now the first point to recognize is that the economic 
system exists primarily for the production and dis¬ 
tribution of goods and services. That is, it is the 
primary objective, and any other objective which may 
be introduced into it is extraneous...you will often 
hear it said that the primary feature of the situation 
is to deal with the unemployment problem. How the un¬ 
employment problem is not in itself inherent as an 
objective of the economic system. It is not the sort 
of thing you can take as an axiom that the economic 
system is failing if it fails to produce employment. 
The perfect economic system...is one that provides 
no employment at all...I am not sayinjg that the pro¬ 
vision of employment is not a desirable thing. That 
is quite outside what I am saying.” 10 


(8) Keynes, J.M., General Theory of Employment. Interest 
and Money , p. 371. ”Tf^ajor Douglas had limited his 
B items to the financial provisions made by entre¬ 
preneurs to which no current expenditure on replace¬ 
ments and renewals corresponds, he would be nearer 
the truth. But even in that case it is necessary to 
allow for the possibility of these provisions being 
offset by new investment in other directions as well 
as by increased expenditure on consumption.”

and he dismisses full employment as a solution to the 
problem because he has divorced purchasing power from its 
dependence on employment. To Douglas the emphasis on full 
employment becomes a conspiracy on the part of the mentors 
of orthodox finance to keep the people "so hard at work 
that they have not the leisure nor even the desire to 
think for themselves ? 11 

Douglas 1 objection to the proposal of a more equalized 
income distribution is expressed in the following manner: 

"The poor are poor not because the rich are rich, but 
because there is not enough...purchasing power, to 
make the poor rich or even comfortably well off, even 
if the whole of the money possessed by the rich were 
taken from them and equally divided amongst the poor. 
The result of attempting to enforce the latter policy 
...is to accentuate the difficulty and still further 
to increase the grip of the financiers, since the dis¬ 
tributing of purchasing power, largely through the 
agency of wages, depends to a considerable extent on 
the buying of articles which would not be produced 
at all if the existing amount of money were equally 
divided, since no one would have enough to buy 
articles which may be said to be above the most 
mediocre standard of living." 12 

The abolition of private ownership and the profit system 

is not the solution to the world economic problems, says 

Douglas. The social value of private ownership is based 

on the individuals ability to make a profit and his 

power to "make prices for his product in excess of costs". 

The individual's stake in the firm is not in administering 

the business but in the two factors just mentioned.

Douglas maintained that the socialists always view the 

problem as an administrative one. If the administration 

of the system is taken away from the owners and "socially 

controlled", the socialists, he declared, erroneously 

believe they have solved the problems of prices and dis- 
13 

tribution. All that is required, says Douglas, is to 
remove the monopoly of the banks over credit, to control 
price-making policies, and the system is reformed without 
removing profit, private ownership, or the incentives 
making for efficient administration. 


As a logical sequence to Douglas T analysis of the in¬ 
herent flaws in the capitalist economy, the social credit 
reform proposals sought to achieve the following ends: 
they must provide the consumer with sufficient purchasing 
power for all his needs, and they must stimulate production 
by injecting purchasing po^wer into the system in such a 
way that it would not enter into costs and raise prices. 

This was to be accomplished, said Douglas, by the establish¬ 
ment of a "Just Price", which meant an arbitrary reduction 
of the price level, to be achieved by forcing producers to 
market their putput at a price that might often be less 


(13) Ibid ., p. S3. Douglas believed that socialism would 
"deprive the individual of economic independence 
either by vesting physical control in the state or 
by nationalizing, through grinding taxation or other¬ 
wise, the means of production and abolishing all 
purchasing power not issued, on terms, by the state."

than the costs of production. 1 ^ The monetary authority 
would then issue special credits to producers in non-legal 
tender which would compensate for the difference between 
the old and the new price. In short, the just price was an 
arithmetic ratio (total national consumption over total 
national production) which was to be the means of deciding, 
from time to time, in what proportion the prices of goods 
would be reduced. The compensating credits to producers 
were to be issued by the monetary authority against the 
n real credit” of the nation. In order that these credits 
should not enter the costs of production and so exert an 
inflationary pressure, Douglas proposed that the banks act 
as intermediaries. If, for instance, 50 units of credit 
issued to consumers by the banks threatened to increase 
the price level, the banks on behalf of the monetary 
authority would restore the balance by issuing 50 units 
of credit tb producers. At this point further credit 
would be cut off. 

Clearly this proposal depends on Douglas 1 premise that 
(l) a gap between purchasing power and prices actually 
does exist, and (2) the B payments remain in the producers 1 
and do not filter through into the consumers 1 sphere; that 
is, special credits issued to producers do not go back 
into the consumers* system where they would have to be 

(14) Ibid ., p. 93. n Habits of thought are so powerful in 
their influence that at first sight a statement that 
the correct price of an article may be a low percentage 
of its cost is apt to induce both disbelief and ridicule.”

converted into legal tender before strengthening effective 
consumer demand* We have previously noted that these 
conditions can hardly be supported. But even if they are 
conceded, the technical problems of applying the just 
price and the credit compensation to producers would hardly 
be as simple as Douglas suggests. 

The second social credit reform proposal was that of 
the National Dividend”. This proposal envisaged the dis¬ 
tribution of purchasing power directly to consumers, to¬ 
gether with an arbitrary price control system and compensated 

production. Douglas referred to the dividend as ”an unearned 

1*5 

increment of cooperation”, J and it appears to have been 
a long-run concept resulting from his theory of the leisure 
state. Like the proposed credits issued to producers under 
the just price arrangement ,the national dividend was to be 
based on the ”real assets” of the community. This is one 
of Douglas 1 most evasive concepts and although never clear 
as to just how the dividend was to be administered, he 
outlined this procedure in his Draft Social Credit Scheme 
for Scotland , as follows: 

”Obtain from existing sources, such as company balance- 
sheets, land registration offices and insurance companies 
such information necessary to place a money valuation 
upon the whole of the capital assets of Scotland...Add 
to this the sum representing the present commercial 
capitalized value of the population...(to be obtained 
from) the expectation of life and the plant capacity 
of the country...something like £10,000 for a citizen 
of the United States at the age of twenty-five...From 

(15) The issuance of national dividends to individuals was 
to insure an ”automatic and universal distribution” of 
goods and services while fewer and fewer work long hours

the grand total thus obtained, a figure representing 
the price value of the Scottish capital account could 
be obtained...(The initial payment would be) an arbitrary 
figure, such as one per cent of the capital sum ascertained 
by the method outlined(above) and it might be expected to 
exceed £300 per annum per family. TT 16 

Again, as was the case with the just price proposal, 

inflationary tendencies were to be avoided by either 

reducing the flow of credits or the level or wage rates, 

or both. 

Now it is admitted that if consumer credits were issued 
and wages reduced at once, the price level might tend to 
fall. But a continued issuance of such credits would soon 
force prices upwards once more. Supposing credits were to 
be stopped in the event of inflation (as Douglas suggests), 
then there would be the problem of timing. If consumers 
accumulated a backlog of credits and black market 
operations became profitable to producers, then the 
government might be forced to suspend the payment of the 
dividend. As more people became dependent on the dividend 
as an income source, any restriction of credits in the 
face of inflation would produce disastrous effects. 


As we observed earlier, the economic considerations of 
social credit are but one aspect of an overall philosophy 
or n way of life". In his early writings Major Douglas

appears to have been greatly concerned with the position 
of the individual in an increasingly centralized society. 1 ^ 
As a technician he had experienced frustration because of 
the business control of industry and he felt that the 
tremendous technological potential would be denied the 
people because of the outmoded nature of the economic 
organization. To Douglas, freedom of choice, either to the 
consumer or to the producer, simply did not exist in a 
world of gigantic governments, large trade unions and 
powerful corporations. The impact of modern industrial 
organization on the individual resulted in this: his 
personality was submerged by the tyranny of concentrated 
power. Socialism, either of the Marxian or Fabian variety, 
only served to speed this process of subjugation. But 
Douglas 1 monetary reforms, on the other hand, would destroy 
the mechanism which tended to increase and concentrate 
economic power; these reforms would restore de facto free¬ 
dom to the individual. Douglas proclaimed that the end of 

18 

man ?fas not work but the enjoyment of self-development. 


(17) Macpherson, C.B., Canadian Journal of Economics and 
Political Science , August, 1949, ff The Political Theory 
of Social Credit 11 , p. 378. 0 .. .he(Douglas) saw that 
whatever held back the progress of science in industry 
made it impossible for the technologist to serve the 
people and give them the benefit of their heritage... 
In his earliest writings his main concern was to ex¬ 
pose this trend...,to establish its perverse nature, 
and to warn that it must be defeated if the human 
quality of civilization was not to be destroyed. 0 

(18) Douglas does not mention the value to the individual 
accruing from certain kinds of work. The pride and 
enjoyment which is the craftmants, for example, is 
never considered. Work, to Douglas, is usually that 
of the sweat-shop.

The financial interests, he claimed, did not want this to 
become generally known. All economic difficulties stemmed 
from an accounting error in productive industry which had 
become an inherent feature of the monetary system. From 
the iniquitous financial system stemmed the policies of 
restricted production, unemployment, the perversion of 
labour values, the suppression of freedom and individuality 
and finally war. The financial interests had perverted the 
capitalist system and replaced capitalism with creditism— 
a term used by Douglas to describe what he called the inter 
national control of finance by an irresponsible oligarchy. 
The first policy whic^had to be followed, he maintained, 
was that the control of the credit system be restored to 
the people made sovereign. Under the present circumstances 
Douglas felt that this was impossible, because parliament¬ 
ary democracy had become illusory and the individual was 
caught in a maze of press, politicians and industry. All 
this was obvious, he said, since it was clear that the 
governments in all western countries were not following 
policies which the people wanted. 

During the early 1930 f s the economic theories of social 
credit were severely rebutted. Logically, the system stood 
or fell on the acuteness of the Douglas analysis and the 
practicability of its reform proposals. Curiously, however, 
the system did not fall by the mere exposition of its 
economic flaws and weaknesses. Instead, the system as a 
whole appeared to change under the stimulus of economic

criticism. The new Douglas strategy was revealed in the 
Buxton address of 1934* Thereafter the economic analysis 
was to be set in the background and replaced by a programme 
of political reform which began with a sweeping denun¬ 
ciation of parliamentary democracy. 

Douglas conceived the state as a coercive power making 
and enforcing laws whose function was to subordinate the 
masses to a few power-seekers. This process was accomplished 
by a mechanism of legal sanctions which perpetuated a 
system of economic relations and property rights creating 
scarcity despite great ability to produce. To Douglas, 
then, the state was a product of the will-to-power of an 
active few, namely the financiers, industrialists, politic¬ 
ians and labour leaders. He assumed that political 
institutions were merely a screen to obscure the increasing 
domination of the system by the financial interests— a 
process which had been going on since the worker lost the 
OY/nership of his tools and his control of production policy.^ 

The social credit remedy suggests that in the economic 
sphere production for consumption, as Ruskin hinted, be 
substituted for the present practice of production for 
"enslavement**. In the political sphere a new and "proper** 
system of representation would have to replace the old and 
faulty system. 

For Douglas the test of an operative democracy depended

on whether the people, through their representatives, had 
achieved that which they desired. Further, there existed a 
"general will" for clear objectives. These general object¬ 
ives were more important that "secondary" objectives, or 
details. The latter were not ends but merely means. Douglas 
drew a sharp line between objectives and methods leaving 
the former only the very broadest and general of matters. 
Hence, fiscal policy, foreign policy and education policy 

all became questions of method about Yfhich the majority 

20 

is incompetent to judge. Douglas thought that by 

quarreling over methods the masses were being constantly 

diverted from action on the objectives in which they were 

all agreed. Thus, the party system became "a mere travesty 

of democracy for confusing and frustrating the people". 

The people are incompetent to rule on questions of 

method, said Douglas, because "the majority in matters 

of detail, in matters of intelligence is, broadly speaking, 

21 

always wrong.. .Majorities feel, they do not think". It 
follows from this that a system of representation which 
forces the masses to rule on questions of method does not 
operate in their own interests. The people should restrict 
themselves to demanding results; the administration should 
assume complete responsibility for results. 

In Douglas’ opinion the elected representatives should 
embody the "mass desire". They should transmit to the

administrators of the system the peoples 1 desire for results. 

Under the present system cabinet responsibility was only a 

screen for administrative control. Douglas envisaged a 

parliament whose chief duties consisted of the removal 

from office of those administrators who constantly thwarted 

the attainment of objectives. Douglas proposed, in fact, a 

removable civil service and the abolition of the party 

op 

system as we understand it. 

Although Douglas maintained his political proposals 
were always democratic, nevertheless their authoritarian 
implications are glaringly obvious. Ho?^ever, it does seem 
that the motives which actuated the social credit political 
theory were of a genuinely human character.23 That Douglas 
was near the truth in his interpretation of the role of the 
individual in modern industrial society, no one will deny; 
but where he suggests the appropriate economic and political 
remedies he fails miserably and dangerously. Prior to 1935 
Douglas 1 political ideas were only moderately authorit¬ 
arian; after that year they became virtually Fascistic in 
character. From a mere "distrust" of majority rule, he moves 
on to declare that majority rule is ' "unsafe 11 ,24 


(22) Macpherson, C.B., Op. Cit . p.385. Under such an arrange¬ 
ment party strife in the usual sense would cease, except 
if the parties under a social credit system competed with 
each other in making life miserable for the administration. 

(23) Supra , p. 14, note 17. 

(24) Since majority rule is unsafe, Douglas falls back upon 
the principle of natural law. This is an objective law 
inherent in the universe, transcending human thought 
and will, to which individuals must accomodate them¬ 
selves. This natural law cannot be consistently dis-

It is probably true that Douglas T main weakness both in 
the economic and political spheres, consisted in his engineer¬ 
ing approach to social problems. He never recognized, for 
instance, that the problems under consideration might 
involve choices between competing ends; that, notwithstand¬ 
ing the fact that any respectable analysis of any world 
problem involves a fair amount of complexity, still there 
might be some place in the process of policy determination 
for the dull and the uninitiated. Douglas was an excellent 
mathematician but a very poor psychologist. Also, through¬ 
out the social credit theory runs the general weakness of 
the finance versus society proposition.^ Finally, Douglas 
neglected to give sufficient emphasis to the important 
social facts of class and group interests. 


regarded without endangering the foundations of society. The 
principles of Christianity are one manifestation of the law 
and so is the common law as contrasted with statute law. The 
principle of the division of political power between King, 
Lords and Commons is accepted and forms the basis for the 
recent social credit demand that the supremacy of the Common 
law over parliament be established and that the House of Lords 
be restored to a position of real power. Similarly it is 
argued that secular and ecclesiastical authority be united. 

In sum, recent Douglasite dogma asserts that the idea that 
the will of the majority should prevail is a principle of 
lawlessness.(see Douglas, C.H., The Brief for the Prosecution , 
(Liverpool, 1945): Copy in the Public library, Edmonton.) 

(25) This theoreticitdefect has become progressively more 

obvious as the social credit political theory has been 
made more explicit: national and international events 
can only be understood in terms of the machinations of 
a select group of bankers—invariably bearing Jewish 
names—who are involved in a long-standing Judaic con¬ 
spiracy to dominate the world. These "world plotters" 
are working through the Masonic Order and both inter¬ 
national capitalism and international communism. The 
conspirators are especially concerned in effecting the 
economic ruination of the British Empire.

On balance, however, Douglas did make two timely con¬ 
tributions: he emphasized the necessity of providing 
adequate purchasing power to consumers and the necessity 
of curbing the encroachments of industrial society on the 
personality of the individual. He indicated that the 
industrial accounting system was not perfect and that 
unrestricted banking activity might prove dangerous. 

Finally, it should be observed that the social credit 
reform proposals may be considered apart from the 
establishment of an overall social credit system. That is, 
the two reform proposals ,price control and consumer bonuses, 
might well be dissociated from social credit economic theory 
and regarded as policy expedients to be used under certain 
economic conditions.

CHAPTER II 


ALBERTA: ECONOMIC. POLITICAL AND SOCIAL 






- 21 - 


II 

In the summer of 1935 the Alberta Social Credit Party 
under the leadership of William Aberhart won a sweeping 
electoral victory. Out of a total of sixty-three seats in 
the Legislature the Social Credit Party-—formally organ¬ 
ized for direct political action only a few months before 
the election—obtained fifty-six, the Liberals five. 
Conservatives two, and the United Farmers of Alberta none. 
The violence of this political shock is evidenced to some 
extent by the fact that the previous government, the U.F.A., 
was sponsored by a highly organized and long established 
agrarian labour movement. Moreover, the U.F.A. had mono¬ 
polized provincial authority since 1921. In order to 
interpret the significance of this remarkable political 
phenomenon it will be necessary at first to review some of 
the features of Alberta*s economic and political develop¬ 
ment. 

The province of Alberta was created by Dominion statute 
in 1905,^and until 1921 was governed by the provincial 
Liberal party. Alberta was the last Canadian province to 
experience large-scale settlement. From 1901 to 1914 the 
population increased at a phenomenal rate. After 1914 the 
rate of settlement slowed to some extent but remained sub¬ 
stantial until the depression of 1921. 

(l) 4"*5 Edward VII, Chap. 3, assented to July 20th, 1905.

The production of wheat has always been a significant 
item in Alberta*s economy. This meant that a large segment 
of provincial income tended to fluctuate according to the 
vagaries of the export market. Livestock production was 
another industry ideally suited to Alberta*s resources. 
However, the difficulties of marketing in the United States 
—the result of an adverse tariff policy—always thwarted 
the development of this natural industry. Coal and other 
natural resources existed in great quantity throughout the 
province, but again, the problems of marketing these items 
in Canada and the United States curtailed their natural 
development. Very early in Alberta*s history it was generally 
believed that the great obstacle to the balanced develop¬ 
ment of agricultural production, as Yrell as the development

of mineral resources such as coal and petroleum, was the 
lack of effective demand, due not so much to the geograph¬ 
ical position of Alberta, but chiefly to the operation of 
certain national policies. 3 The development of Alberta 1 s 
politics along "eccentric” lines has its primary justification 
in the economic sphere* 

But there were other factors which channeled provincial 
political development along peculiar lines. Most of the 
settlers who swarmed into the province came from established 
areas with a relatively high standard of living* Naturally 
they wished to obtain for themselves and their community 
service standards to some extent comparable to those in 
the areas from whence they had come. As a result the govern¬ 
ments of Alberta, both provincial and municipal, were 
faced with inordinate demands by the electorate for the 
provision of the customary services and amenities. 

From the very outset the provincial government had to 
assume the responsibility for the results of a rather 
irresponsible Dominion land settlement policy. It is now 
generally agreed that the aim of the Federal land programme 
was settlement rather than secure settlement.^ 

(3) The Conservative government of Macdonald was usually 
blamed for all these policie. See the speech of Hon. 

W.H. Cushing, Edmonton Bulletin * February 15th, 1907. 

(4) See the speech of Hon. Frank Oliver, Minister of the 
Interior, Hansard , 1905, Vol. II, p. 3157. On the 
matter of "widely scattered settlement”, he stated:

Immigrant homesteaders were allowed to settle anywhere in 
the province, regardless of the known climatic or soil 
conditions and irrespective of the availability of roads, 
rail lines, and telegraph or telephone communications. 

In consequence, the province at an early stage was forced 
into programmes which involved large outlays for roads, 
railways, bridges, telephones, irrigation and re-settlement. 
The results of these early undertakings were to exert a 
great influence on the subsequent financial history of the 
province.5 

From 1905 to 1909 the Liberals under Rutherford offered 
what has been described as "sound, rather conservative 
administration”In 1910 the Alberta and Great Waterways 
"scandal” split the party into two factions and shortly 
thereafter A.L. Sifton assumed the premiership. From 1910 
onwards he was able to hold the discordant elements 
together, but in 1917 he resigned in order to become a 
member in Borden 1 s Union administration. 


(4) Territories is a bill of expense to the provincial 
government...so that as a matter of fact the tendency 
of the provincial government is to get such money as 
it can out of the land and to prevent settlement from 
spreading any further than can be helped. On the 
other hand, the interest of the Dominion is to get 
the settlers on the land, to scatter them far and 
wide so long as they are good settlers and they get 
good land.” 

(5) For a discussion on this point see Chapter V (i) The 
Case for Alberta , 1938, "Special Problems Arising from 
Land Settlement Policies," pp. 57-91.

The Liberals, not unlike the Conservatives after they 
lost R.B. Bennett, were like t! sheep without a shepherd". 

The Hon. Charles Stewart became premier but, unlike Sifton, 
he was unable to restrain the warring factions within the 
party. Between 1917 and 1921 the Liberals gradually lost 
the confidence of the electorate. Compelled to embark on 
a post-war reconstruction programme, they were unable to 
make an agreement with the Dominion regarding natural 
resources. The provincially guaranteed railway companies 
were in financial difficulties and the Dominion refused 
to incorporate them in a national system. The municipal¬ 
ities were also in grave financial trouble and their re¬ 
organization, with all its usual difficulties had to be 
undertaken. Finally in 1920 and 1921, a severe post-war 
recession set in. The D.F.A. party assumed office follow¬ 
ing the election of 1921.^ 

It has been claimed that the longer the Liberals 
remained in office the more radical they became.^ But 
the Conservatives could always fefford to be even more 
radical—they were constantly in the opposition. When 
the Liberal government was sponsoring a private-owner- 


(7) The first U.F.A. candidate had won the Cochrane by- 
election of November 3rd, 1919. Premier Stewart 
expressed great surprise when it was announced on Oct¬ 
ober 17th that a farmers 1 candid.ate would run. He 
felt that any organization could run a candidate but 
that "no class can make a success, as a class, in 
trying to win the government". The U.F.A. officials 
retorted: "The present system of government was 
government from the Throne 1 while the system the 
U.F.A. proposed was 1 direct government from the people Tt

ship programme, the Conservatives were arguing for a 
public-ownership railway programme.*? Indeed both the "old- 
line” parties appeared teady to make any commitment in 
order to court the rural voter. Ey 1921 the electorate had 
grown accustomed to this. The U.F.A. had not been specific¬ 
ally critical of the Liberal administration; it was merely 
felt that a"change of outlook" in the government would be 
desirable.-*- 0 

The U.F.A. Political Association was formed in 1919. 
Immediately U.F.A. candidates contested provincial and 
federal by-elections. Throughout the 1920 ! s the United 
Farmers held a majority in the Alberta Legislature and 
elected several members to the Dominion parliament. Certain 
members of this group became interested in Douglas social 
credit and introduced the doctrine to Alberta about 1920.H 
In 1923 a group of federal U.F.A. members were instrumental 
in having Professor Fisher and Major Douglas present 
evidence before the Commons Committee on Banking and Commerced

is reported as having said: "The Hon. Charles Stewart 
is an honourable, upright citizen, doing the best he 
can under difficult circumstances." The Canadian Annual 
Review , (1919) p. 756. 

(11) Professor J.A. Irving believes that "as far as can be 
discovered, social credit literature was introduced into 
Western Canada by a magazine editor who, through his 
writings and personal friendships, brought the doctrines 
of social credit to the attention of certain leaders of 
the U. F. A.(movement) in the House of Commons."

But although many U.F.A. officials and rank and file local 
members became thoroughly familiar with Douglas 1 proposals 
there was, in the 1920*s, as yet no popular demand that 
social credit be implemented in Alberta. 

The U.F.A. was a highly "group conscious" organization. 
It placed on both Liberals and Conservatives the stigma of 
"eastern domination" by the financial interests of Quebec 
and Ontario who allegedly were interested only in exploit¬ 
ing the western farmer through the media of Taxes, prices, 
tariffs and exorbitant transportation charges.^ So 
successful was this U.F.A. propaganda that organized- 
political activity in the rural areas of the province 
almost ceased. The rural vote was so strongly U.F.A. that 
none of the conventional parties could get a foothold. 

A rift in town and country relations was a dominant social 
characteristic in Alberta during the 1920*s and the great 
depression which followed.^ 


The economy of Alberta has already been described as 
unbalanced and agricultural with a decided emphasis on the 
production of wheat for export. At the end of 1929 world

wheat prices dropped and a severe depression began. 
Alberta’s economy was particularly vulnerable to the 
price decline because of its dependence for a large pro¬ 
portion of its income on the world wheat market.

and 1932, and by the lengthening of the period during which 
the low prices prevailed. From the outset there was a sharp 
division of opinion concerning the cause of the decline in 
the wheat price.^ On the one hand the low wheat price was 
viewed as merely one manifestation of the general world 
depression and, on the other hand, as an abnormal statistical 
relationship between the world supply of and demand for 
wheat. Whatever the merits for each of these viewpoints, it 
was evident that the price of wheat had declined to a much 
greater extent than the prices of commodities in general. 

To the Alberta wheat producer, however, income 
variability resulted not only from fluctuations in the 
price of wheat but from climatic and soil conditions as 
well. This was particularly so in the "problem areas 11 of 
the province. The dry south and southeast—those areas 
where, it is often charged, settlement for wheat growing 
should never have been allowed by the Dominion authorities— 
experienced consistent crop loss during the early 1930 7 s 
because of drought and soil shifting. 1 ^ In "those areas of 
the province where the danger of drought was least, the 
danger of frost damage to crops was greatest.19

Certain other sections of Alberta have always been exposed 
to an unusually high crop loss from hail. Statistics 
published by the Alberta Hail Insurance Board indicate 
that over a sixteen year period ending in 1934* the 
average annual loss due to hail was S.6 per cent of the 
total insurance carried.20 These climatic factors and 
others—for example, temperature and wind variations, weed, 
fungus, grasshopper and other insect infestations—com¬ 
bined to produce a high variability in both crop production 
and quality. 

Besides the large annual variation in the gross value 
of wheat production (TABLE II) we should also observe that 
the farmer ! s net income per acre varied to an even greater 
extent than did the gross value of output. The reason for 
this is that in wheat production there are many costs 
which have little or no relation to the final yield. The 
farmer must maintain his subsistence expenditures regard¬ 
less of the yield, quality or price of the grain. He must 
also provide outlays for taxes, interest, seed, ploughing 
and harvesting in years of good or bad crops and good or 
bad prices. Sometimes the prices entering into these 
necessary farm expenditures will vary with the general 
level of business activity, but never to the same extent 
as the variations in the gross value of wheat production. 
Together with a general price rigidity in the commodities 
essential to wheat production must be considered the

absolutely rigid transportation charges. Harvesting, thresh¬ 
ing and other costs, which constitute a relatively small 
percentage of total production costs, tend to vary with 
the size of the crop but not so much with the price received 
for the crop. The computations of W.A. Mackintosh 21 indicate 
that for average post-war one yields, the total average out- 
of-pocket expenditures per acre amounted to roughly $10.00 
Of this estimate, approximately |7.00 consisted of constant 
costs and $3.00 of variable costs. On this basis and with¬ 
out allowing either for land charges or subsistence expenses, 
the following table estimates the net income per acre from 
wheat growing in Alberta, 1926-1935:

This evidence of the extreme variability of the Alberta 
wheat farmer f s net income would not be of great 
significance in indicating the variability of the net 
income of the whole population of Alberta, if a large 
proportion of the rigid costs noted above accrued to other 
citizens of the province. However, this has never been the 
case. A large proportion of rigidly priced goods consumed 
in Alberta came from outside the province; by and large, 
the profits from the rigid transportation charges went to 
bondholders or shareholders outside the province, while the 
large sums annually paid to service the private debts of 
the province usually accrued to eastern loan and mortgage 
companies. The picture would have been brightened if some 
Alberta producers had been marketing staples outside the 
province at prices more stable than the price of wheat, or 
if a larger proportion of Alberta producers had been pro¬ 
viding commodities for the non-wheat growing population. 
Under these circumstances a certain segment of the pro¬ 
vincial economy might have been able to maintain a reason¬ 
ably stable income, regardless of the fluctuations in the 
net incomes of the wheat farmers. 

Another important aspect of Alberta 1 s economic picture 
was the problem of private debt. The greatest part of this 
debt had been incurred by farmers for the purchase or 
improvement of land. Most of this had been secured by 
mortgage. It is impossible to estimate accurately the 
extent of mortgage indebtedness but the provincial govern-

men t estimated it at $165,000,000 in 1931 and W.A. Mackin¬ 
tosh placed it at $ 400 , 000,000 for the three prairie pro¬ 
vinces* The interest rate on mortgages was estimated to 
have averaged about eight per cent. Where the interest was 
lower than this figure adjustments had been effected under 
the provisions of the Farmers f Creditors Arrangement Act, 
1934. 

Besides the mortgage debt there was also a large debt 
under agreements for the purchase of land. Professor Allen 
has estimated this debt in Saskatchewan to have been in 
excess of $100,000,000 or roughly fifty per cent of the 
mortgage debt of that province. There is some evidence to 
suggest the same proportion would be valid for Alberta. 

The next largest item of farm indebtedness consisted 
of credit extended for the purchase of farm machinery. In 
1931 this was estimated at about $21,000,000. In 1932 it 
was reported that ^practically all machine companies are 
now charging 7 per cent before due and 10 per cent after 
date due”. It was further suggested that the great bulk 
of this debt was carrying a n past due n or ten per cent 
interest rate. 

Store credit in Alberta for 1931 was set at $40,000,000 
by the secretary of the Alberta Retail Merchants 1 Assoc¬ 
iation. This figure was based on a questionnaire and has 
probably been over-estimated. Farmers also owed debts to 
banks as well as tax and wage arrears. All told, it has

been estimated that total farm indebtedness for 1931 
amounted to $317,800,000* The total debt of urban citizens 
cannot be estimated accurately but it was assumed,in at 
least one instance, to have been proportionally as high as 
the farm debt. 2 ^ In 1936 the Alberta Debt Adjustment Board 
placed total farm indebtedness at $395,000,000. 

Agriculture in Western Canada requires large capital 
outlays relative to the current value of output. The ordin¬ 
ary farmer usually did not possess the required capital and 
so he went into debt. The interest on such debt was a fixed 
charge and had to be paid regardless of the current level 
of wheat prices. Since Alberta was only newly settled, it 
had a higher farm indebtedness relative to its current 
agricultural income than did the older communities. The 
drastic and continued decline in the price of wheat forced 
Alberta to become the first province in which farmers as a 
group could not meet their fixed interest obligations. 

Another vitally important matter concerning Alberta 1 s 
economy was the vexatious problem of the tariff. Broadly, 
the economic effect of the Dominion tariff policy has 
been twofold: it placed a burden on agriculture generally, 
while those commodities which might have benefited by 
reasonable tariff protection have not received uniformly 
the protection which might have been expected .24

A tariff may be designed either for revenue or protect¬ 
ive purposes. In general, it is clear that Canadian policy 
has often been for the latter purposes—especially after 
the introduction of National Policy.^ That is, certain 
infant" or "non-economic" industries were to be fostered 
in the national economy. 

Generally a tariff structure tends to raise, either 
directly or indirectly, the level of prices of all goods 
and services within the nation. This price rise causes 
increased cost expenditures which are compensated for in 
the "sheltered" industries by further increased prices. 

The "uneconomic" and n infant n industries, in turn, are 
forced to seek higher tariffs in order to maintain output 
with a profit. As this price spiralling increases, more 
and more of the original burden of fostering the protected 
industries is passed or shifted to those producers who can¬ 
not pass the burden on. These are the "unsheltered" 
industries; these, by and large, are the producers who do 
not set their own prices but who have the prices of their 
output established in an export market. Most Alberta pro¬ 
ducers found themselves in this position. 

Another characteristic of a national tariff is that it 
may tend to depress the prices of exports. Theoretically, 
if a tariff reduces imports it must also reduce exports by 

(25) In view of the large percentage of total federal 

revenue accruing from this source in the early years 
of Confederation, it is true that the tariff, during 
this early period, was for both revenue and protective 
purposes.

approximately an equal amount—all other factors remaining 
constant. A decrease in imports due to a tariff may mean a 
reduction in foreign purchasing power available to purchase 
exports, due either to our refusal to buy foreign goods, 
or to the retaliatory action taken by the foreign govern¬ 
ment to counter our tariff policy. If it can be proved 
that the national tariff policy did, in fact, reduce the 
fpreign demand for Canadian wheat—a rather difficult task— 
then the farmer had one more legitimate complaint against 
the discriminatory national policy. In the case of a high¬ 
ly specialized commodity like wheat the reduced foreign 
demand (or the drop in the export price) could not be com¬ 
pensated for by increased domestic consumption. 

Alberta had always laboured grudgingly under the onerous 
burden of Canadian tariff policy. But during the depression 
the tariff was increased by expanding the items listed; by 
raising import duties, both ad valorem and specific; by 
the application of anti-dumping legislation; by fixing 
values for duty purposes and by a combination of the last 
two methods covering imports competing with Canadian-made 
goods. On the other hand, the evidence suggests that 
Alberta producers who were TT sheltered” or who couldAbenefitcd 
from the tariff, were not able to do so to any marked degree.

As we noted earlier the province of Alberta is notable 
for its consistent tradition of radicalism. Save for the 
early period of Liberal administration between 1905 and 
1909, during which party lines and political institutions 
were in the process of establishment, it may be doubted 
whether the radical spirit was ever absent from provincial 
politics. Moreover, it appears that the Alberta electorate 
demanded and expected more from the provincial government 
than was usual at any given time in the other Canadian 
provinces. Even the speeches of conservative businessmen 
in both the Liberal and Conservative parties are notable 
for their vehemence concerning tariffs, freight rates and 
monopolies.27 The election of the U.F.A. government in 1921 
was another manifestation of this rebellious and independ¬ 
ent spirit—as was the election of the Social Credit 
government in 1935. 

Albertans have always had a flare for monetary panaceas. 
First there were the Populists and then the Non-Partisan 
Leaguers with their peculiar ideas about local autonomous 
banks. Finally, in the early 1920*s, there was Douglas 
social credit. This tendency can probably be explained in 
terms of the frontier economy, one of the characteristics 
of which is always a general lack of purchasing power. 

(27) For examplw, see Cushing f s speech as reported in the 
Edmonton Bulletin , February 15th, 1907. "Monopolies 
continue to flourish and tighten their grip upon the 
vitals of the nation. They continue to filch from the 
long suffering people of our country large profits on 
watered stocks to swell the bank accounts of the 
foreign millionaire." Cushing was himself a large 
lumber operator in Calgary and reputedly wealthy•

Between 1930 and 1935 the U.F.A. government gradually 
lost the confidence of the electorate. Faced with the 
desperate domestic economic situation the government was 
forced into a policy of extensive borrowing in order to 
finance the vital relief and public works projects. This 
policy merely expanded an already heavy provincial debt 
which by March 31st, 1934 amounted to approximately ninety 
million dollars, requiring an annual outlay from current 
revenues of over seven million for interest payments. 
Despite the fact that its revenue sources were becoming 
increasingly unproductive as the depression deepened, the 
government refused to impose further taxes. Paradoxically, 
in spite of its strategic position as the agent of a 
militant agrarian labour movement, the U.F.A. government 
throughout these trying years remained strangely impotent 
and stoutly orthodox. 

By 1932 the United Farmers of Alberta were no longer 
united. The socialist wing of the movement had broken 
away in that year and established the Cooperative Common¬ 
wealth Federation. Henry Wise Wood, the founder and for 
many years president of the organization, was no longer 
able to exert his influence on the "less responsible" 
elements. To make matters worse, t?#o prominent members 
of the government became involved in a series of "scandals" 
touching their personal activities. Finally, the U.F.A. 
repudiated social credit—this, at a time when hundreds

of thousands of Albertans had come to believe strongly 
and passionately that social credit alone could cure the 
ills of all sections of society and restore prosperity 
and happiness to a debt-stricken community. 

The United Farmers refused to incorporate social credit 
into their political platform at the dramatic U.F.A. 
convention in January, 1935. Mr. William Aberhart, the 
leader of the Alberta Social Credit Movement, for nine 
hours during the convention attempted to convince the 
U.F.A. delegates that they should espouse social credit. 

This the majority refused to do. 

In April, 1935 > one political commentator observed: 

"for the first time in a decade, the outcome of an election 
in the foothills province is in dnubt. One thing is certain: 
worry stalks through the camp of the farmers 1 political 
machine like Hamlet* s ghost**. Not the least cause of this 
worry, he declared, was **an ominous hum suggesting a hornets* 
nest—the new Social Credit Party. The public temper of the 
province was described as 

**...more merciless than ever...Despite editorial 
efforts of the official United Farmer , a respected 
weekly religiously read by 20,000 Alberta rural 
homes, there is still an odorous haze hovering over 
the horizon as a result of the decidedly unpleasant 
atmosphere created by the Brownlee and MacPherson 
trials...Within the confines of the U.F.A. temple, 
too, there is discontent and rumblings of division, 
created three years ago by the left wing leaders 
pushing the heretofore solid farmer organization 
into the pinkish (C.C.F.)••.so serious has this 
division become.. .that the **father fI of the U.F.A.

movement, Dr. Henry Wise Wood, now an outsider 
looking in, personally holds little hope for the 
organization, even as an educational body.” 28 

Thus the United Farmers were faced with internal and ex¬ 
ternal crises; with division, uncertainty and shattered 
hopes within, a loss of leadership and combination of 
circumstances without. Barnacles of office had accumulated 
to the point of becoming a burden to themselves and potent 
ammunition for the opposition. The once powerful political 
instruments of ”direct government” and ”salvation through 
cooperation” could not be effectively used either to combat 
the depression or to convince the electorate of the govern¬ 
ment's helplessness. People who allegedly were ”forced to 
eat gophers” could not be made to interest themselves in 
such abstractions. But the U.F.A. maintained its hatred of 
the ”money barons” to the last.^ During the session of 
1935 many U.F.A. members took their last verbal vengeance 
on the Rothchilds, the Morgans and the Flavelles.

Also, a speech by Donald Cameron, (U.F.A.) Innisfail, 
reported in the Edmonton Bulletin , February 16th, 1935 , 
wherein he declared ”poverty is rampant in this pro¬ 
vince”. He contended that there were vast supplies of 
labour and materials available and yet, before people 
could avail themselves of the abundance around them, 
they had to go on bended knee to the ”Rothchilds, 
Morgans, Holts, Flavelles and the Wood Gundys for 
cashU Mr. Cameron delivered a devastating attack on 
the moneychangers who, he said, notwithstanding the 
abject poverty of the people, had gathered in dividends 

almost as great as in 1929, the ”greatest year in 
Canadian history”.

in the election of 1935 the U.F.A. party was completely 
destroyed as an operative political organization.3° 


The political upheaval in Alberta in 1935 was not the 
result of a TT new ff set of social forces but rather, merely 
another manifestation of a fundamental popular radicalism 
inherent in the provincial social context. The impact of 
economic and geographic forces together with the operation 
of certain national policies undoubtedly goes a long way 
in explaining this radicalism as a natural tendency in a 
developing frontier community. Moreover, the general 
scarcity of currency peculiar to all frontier areas was 
aggravated by the financial requirements of western agri¬ 
culture namely, the availability of adequate long-term 
credit. In 1936 Professor McGoun observed that— 

t! J.S. Mill may have thought that capital is the result 
of saving. An Albertan, however, knows better. For him 
capital is the result of borrowing. In Alberta, 
broadly speaking, happiness means credit. 

and this explains, in part, why monetary reform had become 

a "preferred group tendency" in Alberta long before the 

introduction of Douglas social credit. 

(30) Previous to the 1930 election, representation in the 
Legislature was as follows: U.F.A., 43; Liberal, 7; 
Labour, 6 and Conservative, 4* After the 1930 election, 
(the Assembly having been increased from 60 to 63 seats) 
representation was as follows: D.F.A., 39; Liberal, 11; 
Conservative, 6; Labour, 4 and Independent, 3. After 
the 1935 election the standing was Social Credit, 56; 
Liberal,5; Conservative, 2.

It is in just such an environment that political 
radicalism flourishes: a borrowing community will hardly 
be well disposed towards the financial interests which 
allegedly are exploiting its members; a frontier community 
will naturally demand tangible results from governmental 
activities and an unbalanced economy will render a large 
portion of the community unprotected from drastic income 
reductions when the general price level falls. It is not 
without significance that the two political upheavals of 
1921 and 1935 were coterminous with severe economic 
depressions* On the other hand, however, we must not fashion 
a closed causal relationship betYreen the basic economic 
situation and the success or failure of a given political 
party* As it happened, the Great Depression of the 1930 ! s 
certainly was contributory to the rise of social credit 
and even though a necessary condition it was but one of 
several important considerations. Obviously an important 
element in the political success of the Social Credit 
party was the nature of the Alberta Social Credit Movement.

CHAPTER III 


THE ALBERTA SOCIAL CREDIT MOVEMENT 






-43- 


III 


Mr. William Aberhart was born in Huron County, Ontario, 
in 1878. At an early age he migrated to Alberta and in 
due course became principal of the Calgary Crescent Heights 
High School. Aberhart became interested in the philosophy 
of social credit during the 1930*s and from 1932 onwards 
he was the dynamic force in the Alberta Social Credit 
Movement. As a capable teacher he was a respected member 
of the community and for many years he was a spiritual 
leader who possessed a large following because of his 
peculiar ability as a broadcaster and interpreter of 
Christian fundamentalism. Aberhart had a resolute will; 
he was infinitely resourceful and fully aware of the 
emotional attitudes in Alberta concerning the depression. 

As a public orator he had definite hypnotic ability and 
throughout his career he maintained the educational view¬ 
point. 

Aberhart always spoke ”as one having authority”, and, 
in the words of Professor John Irving— 

”He had an uncanny knov/ledge of the art of making up 
peoples 1 minds for them; he led people to believe 
that he alone could think constructively; that he 
had the finer feelings; that his was the responsibil¬ 
ity of decision and others had only the right and 
obligation of acceptance. But through it all (he) 
gave the impression of utter sincerity and that 
sincerity seemed to enter the very souls of his 
followers”. 1

As a religious leader of much repute, Aberhart was able 
to equate the social credit philosophy with his particular 
brand of fundamentalism* Whenever possible, he used Biblical 
texts to support his social credit ideas* To many of his 
followers, therefore, social credit and Christianity 
became identical* 

”1 realized that if the Bible is true, social credit 
would be a sure cure for all the sufferings in Alberta* 

I believe that if we are to fulfill God’s purpose for 
man, we must all take up social credit*” 2 

Aberhart was aware that ”an emotional attitude when once 

aroused tends to radiate over all concurrent processes”; 

he capitalized on the desperate depression situation when 

large numbers of Albertans were experiencing a profound 

”ego-misplacement”. People were not merely concerned with 

their precarious financial positions; they also felt a 

”deep-seated” guilt for their personal inadequacy. 

Aberhart’s psychological astuteness consisted in his 

ability to help these people regain their self-respect; 

he offered a plausible explanation of the breakdown of 

the economic structure and placed the responsibility for 

the depression squarely on those remote individuals who 

manipulated the financial structure for their own 

advantage. Finally, he offered the people a programme of 

social action.

”He (Aberhart) made me realize that if we all stood 
together for social credit we would build a new world 
under his leadership. 11 3 

And, as the movement developed, he became more and more 
indespensable to its continued growth and existence. By the 
spring of 1934 he had consolidated his position as leader 
and as he demanded more from his followers they responded 
more readily to his increased demands. 

William Aberhart was a master of the technique of 
thorough organization and he inspired his lieutenants with 
the zeal to proselytize. Beginning from a small study- 
group in the basement of the Calgary Prophetic Bible 
Institute in the winter of 1932-1933 9 the organization 
was quickly built up in Calgary and its environs. In 1934 
Aberhart and Manning toured the province organizing study- 
groups. Since Aberhart had introduced social credit in 
his religious broadcasts, he received numerous invitations 
to appear before U.F.A. locals and to explain his social 
programme. In this way he was able to carry out a 
thorough ”functional penetration” of the U.F.A. organ¬ 
ization which by 1935 was 11 split down the middle” on the 
issue of social credit. 

”The people (of our U.F.A. Local) who supported social 
credit sat on one side of out church and those who 
remained loyal to the U.F.A. sat on the other side..” 4

But in these public activities Aberhart appeared always 
as a f, man of God 11 , in obvious contrast to the members of 
the D.F.A. government. He always made it clear that he 
had no political ambitions, that he was interested in 
social credit only because of his interest in human 
welfare. And the social credit philosophy, it will be 
remembered, had for many years been more-or-less familiar 
to the rank and file D.F.A. members. 

Aberhart never tired of reminding his followers that 
they were an integral part of the movement. ”1 can T t 
change this economic system”, he used to say, "but you 
can”. By his tremendous personal following, his obvious 
sincerity and his charismatic appeal, William Aberhart 
built an organization which was seldom out of touch with 
the people. By 1935 there were thirty-five clubs in 
Calgary alone, while some sixteen hundred social credit 
organizations had developed throughout Alberta. These 
local groups "sustained the microcosm”; they provided 
that”primitive comradeship” essential to a vigorous 
social movement and finally, they assured the political 
success of the Social Credit party ?<rhich did not formally 
enter the political arena until a few months before the 
summer election of 1935. 

Before proceeding farther, let us consider the economic 
philosophy which, translated into a political platform, 
helped put Aberhart in power. This is contained in the

Social Credit Manual , published just before the election 
of 1935 and containing information on "some puzzling 
questions and their answers".^ 

The Manual announces at the outset that it is not a 
detailed plan for the province, but merely an outline. 

Its basic premise holds that "it is the duty of the state 
through its government to organize its economic structure 
in such a way that no "bona fide" citizen, man woman or 
child, shall be allowed to suffer from lack of the bare 
necessities of food, clothing and shelter in the midst 
of plenty and abundance". The Manual goes on to state 
that social credit is not based on any confiscation scheme 
"by which we take the wealth of the rich and give it to 
the poor". Social credit, it continues, "recognizes 
individual enterprise and individual ownership, but it 
prevents wildcat exploitation of the consumer through the 
medium of enormously exorbitant spreads in price for the 
purpose of obtaining exorbitant profits". Social credit, 
says the Manual, "holds that every consumer has a right 
to share in the production from the natural resources 


(5) The Douglasite theories were not accepted wholesale 
by Alberta social crediters. The extent to which the 
various aspects of Douglas’ system were accepted 
varied with the time, the occasion and the person. 

It is clear that Premier Aberhart, for instance, 
regarded social credit essentially as a monetary 
reform which was morally justified through the 
Cultural Heritage and had its religious foundation 
in his o?m interpretation of Christian fundamentalism 
and Bible Prophecy.

of the province. At the present time this wealth is being 
manipulated and controlled by the Fifty Big-Shots of 
Canada”. The right of the people to a share in this wealth 
sprang from their "cultural heritage” which was to be made 
operative by "basic dividends” to be issued to each citizen 
to enable him to procure the basic necessities of food, 
clothing and shelter. The Manual sets the amount of the 
basic dividend at $25.00 per month for "bona fide” citizens, 
male or female, twenty-one years or over. Children who 
attained sixteen years were to receive $5.00 per month; 
those seventeen and eighteen $10.00 per month and those 
nineteen and twenty $15.00 and $20.00 per month respect¬ 
ively. Undoubtedly Aberhart intended these figures only 
for illustrative purposes. It is clear, how r ever, that in 
the election many voters took Aberhart 1 s proposition 
literally—as did many of the Social Credit private members 
of the Legislature.^ 

The recipient of the basic dividend was not to be 
required to pay it back or work it out. The only stip¬ 
ulation attached was that he must "cooperate in every 
possible way” with the government. The dividend, moreover, 


(6) In the first session of 1936, thirty Social Credit 
members spoke in the debate on the Speech from the 
Throne. Ten members advocated that the government 
pay the dividends as soon as possible, while the 
remainder warned the government that a high price 
would be paid for failure to implement social 
credit. H.C. Wright,(S.C.) Lethbridge, stated:"If 
we fail, what we have passed through will be a 
pleasure compared to what we will suffer”. 
(Edmonton Bulletin , Tuesday February lSth, 1936.)

was to be issued by means of a non-negotiable instrument 
or ”certificate” which would be distributed in blank to 
every bona fide citizen.^ Because it was non-negotiable, 
it was intended that the recipient would deposit the 
certificate in the Provincial Credit House or bank. The 
issuer was to be debited and the payee credited, allowing 
the latter to issue another certificate of his own to pay 
his debt. 

The Manual goes on to outline the other two social 
credit proposals, namely the establishment of an Auto¬ 
matic” price control mechanism which would establish a 
”just or compensated” price at which goods and services 
would be available for consumption and ”the provision for 
the continuous flow of credit”. In no case, stipulated 
the Manual, was new money to be issued. 

The questions raised by these proposals were (l) where 
would the credit come from to pay the basic dividends; 

(2) how would they be collected during each cycle so as 
to be reissued by the provincial credit authority; (3) how 
would the whole process be continued without causing 
inflation, on the one hand, and a drastic increase in both 
taxation and provincial debt on the other and finally.

(4) how would such a system be implemented if the con¬ 
stitutional right of the province in such matters was 
questioned? 

The first of these questions was answered by the Manual 
in the following way: 

”0n account of the increased turnover that will be 
produced by the augmented purchasing power through 
dividends, salaries, commissions and so forth, it is 
felt that the producer and distributor will be able 
to carry on their business with a closer margin of 
profit or commission on turnover. Thus the province 
will be able to collect a levy that will provide the 
basic dividends to distribute to the various citizens.” 

In the previous year Mr. Aberhart had answered the same 

question of where the money or credit to pay the dividends 

would come from by saying: ”Does not the increment on the 

natural resources supply the necessary credit to keep up 

the flow of credit?”^ At the same time he offered a detailed 

explanation of a social credit administrative structure. 

”Here is the State Credit House (he pointed to his chart) 
...To start the business going they give a credit loan 
to producers without interest. In producing the goods 
the producer pays out this credit in wages, salaries, 
commissions, etc., which ultimately comes to the con¬ 
sumer. This amount is not enough to purchase all the 
goods. The State Credit House therefore issues the 
basic dividends to make consumers T credit equal to 
the consumable goods. Thus the flow begins. The con¬ 
sumers buy the goods from retailers and pay in credit 
certificates which are deposited. The retailer in 
turn pays the Y/holesaler similarly, and he settles 
with the producer. Finally, the producer repays the 
loan to the credit house and the circuit is complete.” y

Aberhart further believed that T, as the flow of credit 
passes around, there are two ways in which it might be 
interfered with". First, he thought that the dividends 
might be hoarded—in which case he advocated a compulsory 
spending act; secondly, he believed that consumers might 
be exploited through the manipulation of the prices of 
goods. It is at this point that Aberhart implies what 
kind of action the monetary authority would take in the 
event of inflation. A "Guild Commission" would sit from 
time to time "to ascertain the actual total cost of pro¬ 
duction and to examine the ratio of consumption to pro¬ 
duction." "If consumption is lagging behind production, 
the commission could allow a discount off the total cost 
to increase the consumption. This discount w T ould be paid 
to the retailer by the state credit house or allowed to 
the consumer on presentation of his invoice at the state 
credit house." The whole process was not to cause 
inflation, moreover, because no "money" was to be created. 
Neither would taxes or provincial debt be increased 
since the credits were to be made possible by a levy 
on the natural resources increment. The "flow of credit" 
was to be guaranteed through compulsory spending and an 
arbitrary price control mechanism. The monetary authority 
would recoup the original oulay on dividends by means of 
the levy.

It is clear from this analysis that Aberhart social 
credit and Douglas social credit were similar in name 
only. To Major Douglas social credit was basically a 
method of financing consumption through the issue by the 
state of debt-free” credit; that is, created credit 
carrying no interest and not repayable, Douglas contended 
that the most important characteristic of contemporary 
western civilization was the displacement of manpower by 
machine power, Man, he said, now lived in the poorer age, 
an age in which both industry and agriculture were able 
to turn out more and more goods, using less and less human 
energy per unit of production. Despite the constant increase 
in the flow of goods, hoirever, many men were still in want. 
This paradox, he argued, resulted because the financial 
system failed to distribute sufficient purchasing power 
to consumers to enable them to consume what the productive 
machine was able to produce. Hitherto, said Douglas, 
purchasing power had been distributed mainly through the 
payment for the expenditure of human energy, but, since 
the human energy content in the stream of goods was pro¬ 
gressively diminishing and the machine energy content was 
increasing, some supplementary method of distributing 
purchasing power had to be devised. Through the ”A plus B” 
theorem Douglas proved to his own satisfaction that there 
was a chronic lag in the orthodox distribution of purchas¬ 
ing power. This deficiency was concealed, he said, only

so long as the world continued piling up debt for the 
accumulation of capital goods; that is, machines, factories 
railroads and the like. Once this rate of capital accumulat 
ion declines, the supply of purchasing power becomes in¬ 
adequate, prices fall and the burden of debt becomes in¬ 
tolerable. 

To Douglas, moreover, the vehicle for the distribution 
of purchasing power was money, which in the modern world 
meant bank-cheque, debt-creating credit. The essential 
backing for this credit, he said, was not gold but the 
natural resources, the productive capacity, the skill and 
character of the people. Douglas emphasized the social 
basis of the credit structure. At the present, he said, 
the volume of credit is determined by the financial system 
on the basis of its own self-interest. This, he felt, was 
wrong. Instead, the volume of credit should be controlled 
by the state on the basis of social interest. 

In order to accomplish these ends Douglas advocated 
that the state, on behalf of the people, assume control of 
the issuance of credit. A state banking system would be 
established to issue the new debt-free credit. Consumer 
dividends would make up for the deficiency of purchasing 
power due to the displacement of manpower by machine 
power. Alternatively, a just price mechanism, which 
forced retailers to sell their products —or producers 
to market their commodities—at some percentage below 
cost, could be used to equate total national production

and total national consumption. 

In a previous chapter we observed that the basic 
assumptions on which this reasoning is based are highly 
unrealistic. The "A plus B 11 theorem does not prove the 
existence of a permanent gap between collective prices 
and total purchasing power; neither does the alleged gap 
result from the operations of the financial system. In 
practice it is difficult to see how the Douglas social 
credit reform proposals would do more than cause severe, 
uncontrolled inflation. Furthermore, it is questionable 
whether economic stability could ever be achieved by 
monetary adjustments alone. 

Now it is clear that nothing accurately approximating 
this concept ever developed in the Alberta Social- Credit 
Movement. Perhaps the chief reason for this was that 
Aberhart, though "converted* 1 to social credit, never 
quite grasped the full practical import of Douglas* 
theories. Thus, according to the Manual, basic dividends 
were to be issued primarily for the purpose of providing 
citizens with the basic necessities of life. These diviends 
of $25*00 a month would have involved the issue of 
$120,000,000 in new credit annually in a province whose 
income in 1934 was $187,000,000. Twenty-five dollars was 
a purely arbitrary figure which slipped glibly off the 
tongue. The just price proposal, which to Douglas was a

device for equalizing consumption and production, to 
Aberhart was a device for reducing price spreads and "wild¬ 
cat exploitation"—a concept which had nothing to do with 
the original Douglasite idea, Douglas said nothing about 
reducing profits—indeed, he was overly concerned to show 
that a healthy profit system should be retained—while 
Aberhart, on the other hand, makes "exorbitant profits" 
the main theme of his social credit. Again, the anti- 
inflationary mechanism put forward by Douglas is not even 
remotely comparable to those suggested by Aberhart. 

Only in the most general sense, therefore, do the 
Douglasite and Aberhartian theories mesh. If the theories 
ofl Major Douglas were criticized because of their vagueness, 
those of Mr. Aberhart must be criticized on other grounds— 
they were so clearly set forth that their impracticability 
was immediately demonstrated. 

But it was not merely because of Premier Aberhart 1 s 
interpretation of social credit that the Douglasite economic 
doctrines remained hazy to most Albertans. Clearly another 
factor was the revolutionary character and the complexity 
of the concept itself, together with the obscurity which 
often characterized Douglas 1 presentation. When asked by 
ex-premier J.E. Brovmlee to define in one or two sentences 
what he meant by "social credit", Douglas replied in the 
following manner:

”Social credit, in its essence, is a correct estimate 
of the productive capacity of a given unit, based upon 
that which is the real social credit of the unit. You 
have something which we call financial credit, which 
can also be made to be the reflection of this real 
social credit; and that I should say, can be defined 
as the power of monetizing, to any extent desirable, 
the real wealth of the unit, so it can be freely 
exchanged.” 11 

Again, Mr. Aberhart, when asked to discuss the details of 
applying social credit, replied: ”1 say to you again. Major 
Douglas has peculiar knowledge and goes into it in higher 
mathematics, but the ordinary man cannot understand that.” 
When asked what he would do if he were given the respon¬ 
sibility of launching a social credit scheme in Alberta, 
he stated: ”The first step would be to ask permission to 
engage Major Douglas to come here and organize it and he 
would do the work”. 

Another important reason why Albertans could not grasp 
the economic theories of Douglas was because the provincial 
economy did not fit the premise of a highly industrialized, 
machine-powered economy on which the Douglas analysis was 
based. Alberta was primarily an agricultural community with 
supplementary sources of income from coal and oil. Largely 
an exporter of raw materials, the province was greatly 
dependent on the import of finished goods. Many of the 
factors governing the terms on which it acquired these 
finished goods—the world wheat price, for example—-were

no t amenable to internal control by the province itself. 
Douglas admitted this dilemma in 1934 when he said, T, A plan 
might be suitable for highly industrialized countries like 
Great Britain, and might not be so suitable for a province 
like Alberta.” 

Another important question which had to be answered by 
Albertans when they considered social credit was "would the 
establishment of such a system be within the competence 
of the provincial Legislature under the terms of the 
constitution?” Until he became Premier,Aberhart never 
appears to have grasped the constitutional difficulties 
involved in the establishment of a provincial social 
credit system. Nevertheless, prior to 1935 > there had been 
much discussion on this point. With regard to the "non- 
negotiable” certificate it was felt that it would”circulate” 
at least once and that if it could not legally be defined 
as "money” it could at least be classified as a "substitute 
for moneyy in which case it automatically fell within the 
prohibition of the Dominion Bank Act, 1934Further, the 
proposed fixing of a "just price", especially in connexion 
with commodities pmoduced in Alberta and exported for sale 
(or vice-versa ) raised another thorny constitutional 
problem. Previous provincial legislation of this nature 

(13) This was the opinion of Dean Weir (Faculty of Law, the 
University of Alberta) in his evidence before the 
Agricultural Committee of the Alberta Legislature(l935). 
Specifically note section 138, Dominion Bank Act, 

(Chap. 24* 1934) Also, see section 91 (15) and (4 ), 
B.N.A. Act, 1867.

had been declared ultra vires of the provinces because, 

first, it restricted inter-provincial or foreign trade, 

and second, it amounted, in law, to a provincial export 

(or import) tax, which tax was necessarily indirect.^ 

On the matter of constitutionality Douglas remained as 

non-committal as possible.15 Aside from the numerous 

statements imputed to him on this matter, he seems always 

to have considered the problem essentially one for 

Albertans themselves to solve. On one occasion he said— 

"In regard to Alberta, I should say, and I am open... 
to correction by the legal talent here, that the 
first thing to do is to concentrate on the provincial 
(financial) institutions and employ whatever powers 
you have got left ...to penalize these institutions." 1° 

and in this way he was able to avoid a discussion of the 

constitutional barriers to the successful introduction of 

a social credit system at the provincial level. 


(14) The province of British Columbia had attempted to 
fix fruit prices. The legislation was declared ultra 
vires of the province by the Supreme Court of Canada 
in Lawson v The Interior Fruit and Vegeta b le Comm¬ 

ittee , 1931, S.C.R. 375; also in A.G. for B.C. v 
McDonald Murphy Lumber Co mpany , 1930, A.C. at page 
363 it was stated: "An export tax falling within 
the category of duties or customs and excise (is) 
as such, as well as by reason of its inherent nature 
as an indirect tax (not) competently imposed by a 
provincial legislature." 

(15) Douglas was in Alberta on two occasions: in 1934 he 
gave evidence before the Agricultural Committee of the 
Legislature and later, in 1934> he was retained by 
the U.F.A. government as "Reconstruction Economic 
Adviser. In his latter capacity he presented an 
Interim Report on the practicability of an Alberta 
social credit system. For the details of this report 
see infra, pp.

Despite the fact that the "intellectual" wing of the 
Alberta Social Credit Movement considered such a provincial 
programme impossible because of the constitutional barriers, 
Aberhart seems never to have questioned the possibility of 
its success. In fact, he outlined seven reasons why it 
should first be implemented on a provincial rather than 
a national basis. His second reason purported to deal 
with the constitutional questions: 

"Ten legislatures, nine provinces and the Dominion 
would have to agree...the functioning of ten legislatures 
in harmony (on the issue of social credit) taxes the 
most hopeful imagination...if one (province) could stop 
the whole movement, I ^ust wonder how long it would 
take to do it." 17 

Obviously this statement avoids discussion of the constit¬ 
utional difficulties outlined above. 


For all practical purposes the Alberta Social Credit 
movement and the personality of William Aberhart are in¬ 
separable. Aberhart was the dynamic ingredient essential 
at all times to the organization, development, direction 
and control of the movement. The unqualified response of 
large numbers of Albertans to his personality stands as 
a classical example of the principle of "charismatic" 
leadership and, as Professor John Irving suggests, it is 
to be doubted whether any leader in modern times exercised

more complete power over his followers. Possessed of a 
large religious following, he successfuly fused the 
monetary proposals of social credit with his own brand 
of religion and Bible Prophecy. At the same time, he 
systematically organized social credit study groups 
throughout the province and tried in vain to have the 
U.F.A. party adopt a social credit policy. Finally, he 
determined—after much outward hesitancy—to organize a 
Social Credit party and contest the provincial election. 
Successful beyond all reasonable expectations, he commenced 
his first term as premier of Alberta. 

The Aberhart&h faith which manifested itself in such 
strength during the summer of 1935 was simplicity itself. 

It was described by one commentator in the following way: 

“Social credit, once captured, would be actualized in 
the form of a $25.00 a month dividend...In the process 
the ’octopus of finance* was to be roped, thrown, and 
dragged helpless at the wheels of Alberta’s new-found 
chuck-wagon. In the end a new heaven and a new earth 
were to emerge in the shadow of the foothills, and 
Alberta would lead a bewildered world to sanity, 
sanctity, and prosperity.** 19 

For three years after election the new government strove 
to realize its “New Economic Order* 1 but, in the end, the 
pursuit of the elusive financial abstraction had to be 
abandoned. 


(18) Of the many organizational devices used by Aberhart, 
none were more striking than his method of selecting 
candidates. On the premise that the people of a con¬ 
stituency were not voting for a man but for a set of 
principles, each constituency convention selected a 
slate of possible candidates, each of whom was sub¬ 
sequently interviewed by an advisory committee

We have already noted the wide doctrinal disparities 
which characterized the Alberta Social Credit Movement and, 
as might be expected, confused, inconsistent and incoherent 
doctrine was translated into confused, inconsistent and 
incoherent policy and programme after the election of the 
Social Credit government* Before proceeding with a general 
survey of peculiarly social credit legislation, therefore, 
it will be necessary to interpret the basis of subsequent 
policy decisions. 

Clearly much of the incoherence of early Social Credit 
policy stemmed from the very nature of the premieres per¬ 
sonality. Obviously, the qualifications required for 

successful mass leadership need not be those necessary 

20 

for successful administration. Immediately after his 
election the premier had to consider the reorganization 

(18) Cont l d—composed of representatives from the constit¬ 
uency and the province. Anti-social crediters charged 
that Aberhart personally made the final choice in a 
dictatorial manner. This, however, cannot be sub¬ 
stantiated in fact. One of the practical results of 
this technique was that every eligible candidate 
worked enthusiastically at least until nomination day. 

(19) Irwin, W.A. Maclean T s Magazine . December 1st, 1937. 

(20) A sample of Aberhart&an platform technique at its best 
and Aberhartian economics at its worst: 

T, Pat and Mike had a keg of beer and one five-cent piece. 
They decided to go into business selling beer by the 
roadside. No customers appeared, the day was hot, so 
they decided to develop a self-contained economy by 
buying and selling to one another. Pat handed over the 
nickel and got in exchange a glass of beer. Mike passed 
back the nickel and got a glass of beer. This double 
exchange was repeated until the keg was empty. A fine 
example of what high money velocity would do for 
business turnover. All that turnover and only one 
nickel!” TT That f s all very well protested a voice from

of provincial finances. To this end he obtained the 
services of J.R. Magor, Montreal industrialist and a 
director of the Bank of Canada. Mr. Major prescribed 
orthodox remedies—for example,less spending and more taxes. 
He also advised that Alberta enter the Dominions new Loan 
Council scheme. Meanvfhile the premier attempted to have 
Major Douglas return to Alberta. Shortly after the election 
of 1935 he wired Douglas: n Victorious, when can you come?” 
Later, however, seeing orthodoxy—in the person of Magor— 
in control, Douglas refused to return. The premier there¬ 
upon refused to enter the Loan Council and the province 
defaulted on a maturity obligation valued at $-5,200,000. 
Aberhart appears to have drawn a distinction between 
financial reorganization and the establishment of a social 
credit system. He wanted Douglas 1 assistance on the latter 
project but, faced with an empty treasury, he was not 
opposed to the employment of orthodox advisers for the 
former project. 

This early rift between Aberhart and Douglas was never 
quite surmounted. In 1937, for example, Douglas wrote— 

”In order to appreciate the somewhat unfortunate policy 
adopted by Mr. Aberhart after election, it is necessary 
to recall the peculiar combination of schoolmaster- 
preacher grafted upon an unusually ambitious temper-

ment, lacking either political experience or social 
sophistication, together with a popularity as the 
prophet of a new world, both temporal and spiritual, 
almost impossible of belief to those who had not 
Y/itnessed it..* 

It would not be possible to claim that at any time 
the technical basis of social credit was understood 
by him, and, in fact, his own writings on the subject 
are defective both in theory and practicability.” 21 

Another factor contributing to the tortuous course of 
early Social Credit policy was the "expert” advice which 
the government invariably received. In 1936, John Hargrave, 
the leader of the Social Credit Party of Great Britain and 
the rival of Major Douglas, appeared on the Alberta scene. 
After a short stay and in the midst of a violent party 
dispute, he left the province and was described by the 
premier as a "sinecure hunter”. Hargrave, in his published 
diary, said of Aberhart: 

"...not only was it necessary to deal with a preacher- 
schoolmaster personality, abnormally resentful of 
criticism, but one that could not accept and act upon 
any proposition without taking it to pieces and 
putting it together wrongly. Having done my utmost 
to help, I am leaving Alberta because I find it imposs¬ 
ible to cooperate with a Government which I consider 
a mere vacillating machine which operates in starts, 
stops and reversals.”22 

Later, following the first crisis of 1937, Douglas dispatched 
to Alberta his two "technical envoys”, G.F. Powell and 
L.D. Byrne. At the end og the turmoil later in the year, 
Powell emerged with a six month jail sentence and a 
recommendation by an Alberta court that he be deported.

Tog ether with J.H. Unwin, (S.C.) Edson, Government Whip, 
he was found guilty of defamatory libel charges arising 
out of the "Bankers Toadies" incident.^3 

But perhaps the main reason for the incoherence of 
early Social Credit policy, however, was the fact that the 
government forces, outwardly united, were really divided 
into two factions—the Aberhart men and the Douglasite 
"insurgents". Aberhart weathered the storms of 1937 only 
because he controlled the province-wide Social Credit 
league—the popular arm of the movement after 1936—and 
because of his tremendous following. "They almost tore 
the hide off me when I took the stump against him", admit¬ 
ted one insurgent leader. "So far as the House was con¬ 
cerned ", he declared, "we could have shoved him out, but 
his personal following was still too strong to be ignored." 

Now it is understood that in 1937, government policy 
was dictated by the "technical envoys". The actual course 
of events, however, was determined neither by Douglas 
through his representatives in Alberta, nor by Premier 
Aberhart and the Cabinet, but by the Social Credit Caucus. 
The practical result of this government by caucus was 
that decisions reached behind closed doors—the result of 
prevailing opinions and the relative strengths of the 


(23) One day during the second session of 1937 large numbers 
of leaflets appeared in the Legislature bearing the 
following statement "...My child, God made bankers 
toadies, just as He made snakes, slugs, snails and 
other creepy-crawly things. Never,therefore, abuse 
them; just exterminate them? On the same leaflet were 
the names of certain prominent Alberta citizens, one 
of whom was the Conservative leader in the Legislature.

two opposing factions—dictated the course which the 
cabinet was forced to follow. For example, Hon. Mr. May¬ 
nard, in the debate on the resolution denying the Dominion 1 s 
right of disallowance, declared on one day that Alberta 
would give effect to the disputed statutes despite Ottawa 1 s 
disallowance, and on the next day that ”the Government 
would abide by the ruling of the courts on the matter”. 

This reversal of opinion was accompanied by a declaration 
denying the governments intention of fomenting armed 
revolt. Later, in the same speech, however, the Minister 
stated that: 

n The directors of these financial institutions, the 
banks, the mortgage and insurance companies, are afraid 
to take up arms and combat the people of Alberta; 
they are nothing but cowards.” 24 

Later in the debate on the disallowance resolution, the 

premier denied the denial in the original resolution by 

introducing the following amendment: 

”There is no intention whatever of defying any Govern¬ 
ment—there is no thought whatever of rebelling against 
any constituted authority. The members of this Govern¬ 
ment have not the intention and will not tolerate the 
idea of sedition or secession.” 25 

An interpretation of these startling inconsistencies can 

be given only if it is assumed that the caucus, having 

backed away from the secession issue, left the government 

with no alternative but to adjust its policy accordingly. 

It is only through these inconsistencies that the internal

party struggle became evident in the Legislature. Outwardly 
the party retained a semblance of unity. All caucus 
deliberations were secret and each party member signed a 
pledge which read, in part, as follows: 

,T ...I also realize that the Government of which I am 
a member is virtually at war, and that in war information 
which may appear unimportant is often vital. So I 
promise that I will not reveal to any unauthorized 
person any information whatsoever which is imparted 
to me concerning legislation until it is discussed 
in the Assembly. 26 


After his election in 1935 Aberhart continued to 
inspire and lead his followers. He assured them that after 
eighteen months had elapsed they ¥<rould be presented with 
a full-blown social credit programme, which would effect¬ 
ively curb the financial interests and assure each citizen 
the basic dividend of $25-00 per month. As often happens, 
hoy/ever, the reformer turned administrator was faced with 
many obstacles. As we observed earlier the financial 
position of the province was very precarious when Aberhart 
assumed office, and during 1936 and 1937 the general 
economic picture did not brighten to any marked degree* 

The depression continued, requiring the government to 
find large ouiays for agricultural and unemployment 
relief; the "calamities” of drought, hail, frost and pests 
necessitated large expenditures. Taxes had to be

drastically increased in order to finance these require¬ 
ments and public opinion cried loudly for both public 
and private debt adjustment. By 1937, however, many rank- 
and-file social crediters were not contented with the 
premier ! s "good administration” policy. The insurgents 
in the Legislature demanded the immediate establishment of 
a social credit system and to this end they refused to 
consent to the 1937 budget until Aberhart compromised and 
agreed to the establishment of a Social Credit Board. 

The chairman of the board, Glen MacLachlan (S.C.) Coron¬ 
ation, journeyed to England to engage Major Douglas as 
technical assistant to the government. Douglas, however, 
was experiencing strained relations with Premier Aberhart 
and for this and other reasons he declined to return to 
Alberta. Instead, he delegated two ”technical envoys” to 
serve as technicians to the Social Credit Board. The 
Legislature, which had been adjourned to await the arrival 
of the ”experts” was reassembled and the Social Credit 
Act was passed. Under pressure from the insurgent wing of 
the party several ”drastic” measures were introduced in 
the two special sessions of 1937. All this social credit 
legislation was declared 6 ltra vires , disallowed, or 
reserved by the provincial Lieutenant-Governor. 

Blocked in every way the government finally swung into 
an”interim programme” whose object was a gradual implement¬ 
ation of those social credit principles capable of being

applied provincially. Treasury Branches were established 
and empowered to conduct certain financial activities. 

By 1939 the "Great Insurgency" within the Social Credit 
party had been temporarily healed but the opposition 
parties within the province had formed an uneasy coalition 
in anticipation of the impending election. Lacking any 
constructive policy and shouting "Throw out Aberhart" they 
were, however, unable to unseat the government in the 1940 
election. Since the provincial economy was still relatively 
depressed, the premier was able to use his slogans and 
tactics of 1935 again with considerable success. But the 
government very nearly lost the election, holding only 
thirty-six out of fifty-seven seats—despite the weakness 
of the Independent party. It has been estimated that a 
shift of only a thousand votes properly distributed in 
ten constituencies would have produced Aberhart 1 s fall. 

Meanwhile the C.C.F. party was slowly gaining popular 
support. Most of the genuine left wing members of the 
social credit organization were drifting into the social¬ 
ist ranks. It was alleged in the 1940 campaign that 
Social Credit was "just another" political party. Indeed, 
political power was rapidly institutionalizing the move¬ 
ment. This process reached its culmination in 1943 with 
the death of premier Aberhart and the election of Hon. 

Erne st C. Manning, by the members of the Legislature, 
as the new leader of the party and the movement.

The election of 1944 was not fought along strict 
social credit lines—that is, the government had determined 
not to introduce ^controversial*’ legislation during the 
war years—hut on the straight free-enterprise versus 
socialism issue* During the campaign Premier Manning 
reinterpreted the social credit theory and stressed 
particularly Douglas* antipathy towards socialism. As a 
consequence the last left wing elements were driven from 
the party and replaced by what have been termed !, the 
representatives of the propertied classes*’. 

After the end of the war the Social Credit League 
raised the question of basic dividends and the compensated 
price. The government was reminded that the #25.00 promise 
was some ten years overdue. In response to this popular 
demand the government presented its Bill of Rights in 
1946. This ^Charter of Freedom**, as it was termed, incorp¬ 
orated some of the features of the old social credit 
legislation of 1936 and 1937 but failed to provide for 
basic dividends as such. Instead a Social Security Pension 
was to be distributed together with broad medical beliefits. 
Significantly, however, the Bill was not to be operative 
until its validity had been tested by the courts. In 1947 
this legislation was ruled ultra vires by both the Supreme 
Court of Canada and the Judicial Committee. 


Throughout these years the Douglasite wing of the Alberta 
Social Credit Movement remained active. Certain individuals

in key positions—for example,in the weekly newspaper. 

The Canadian Social Crediter and on the Social Credit 
Board—were actively engaged in spreading Douglas 1 
latest theories. The extent of Douglasite participation 
in the Alberta Social Credit Party organization was 
revealed in 194*7 when the Annual Report of the Social 
Credit Board stated that the "world plotters" had ex¬ 
tended their monopolistic control in both the financial 
and political sphere with world dictatorship as their 
ultimate goal. "Any program for action”, the report 
concluded, "must begin with a criticism of democracy as 
it functions at present: majority rule, the secret ballot 
and the party system must all be abolished”, since they 
were the instruments, not of functioning democracy, but 
of the world plotters. 

The publication of this report generated a purge 
within the party ranks and at the same time, a critical 
revaluation of the social credit philosophy. After the 
close of the 194*7 session the party caucus publicly 
announced that the social credit principles enunciated 
by Mr. Aberhart were valid and to be "unswervingly 
followed by the government". Finally, the Alberta party 
dissociated itself from "any statements or publications 
which were incompatible with the established British ideals 
of democratic freedom or which endorsed, excused or incited 
anti-semitic or racial or religious intoleration in any form.

CHAPTER IV 


ALBERTA SOCIAL CREDIT LEGISLATION 









- 71 - 


IV 

The legislative record of the Alberta Social Credit 
government from 1935 to 1938 was highlighted by three 
features: the attempt to inagurate by statute a "New 
Economic Order" which would allow the national financial 
structure to be supplemented by a provincial system of 
social credit; the general attempt to reduce indebtedness, 
both public and private, and finally, the attempt to 
mitigate the economic and social consequences of depression 
through the provision of direct and indirect relief to the 
urban and rural inhabitants of the province. Throughout 
these tumultuous years other currents of legislative 
activity were evident, as, for example, the Stamp Scrip 
or "Prosperity Certificates" experiment and the Legislative 
Assembly (Recall) Act. In general, however, these latter 
ventures were subsidiary to the main features outlined 
above. 

The disastrous effects of prolonged depression were 
glaringly evident when the first session of the Eighth 
Legislature opened in Edmonton on February 6th, 1936. 

In his Speech from the Throne the Lieutenant-Governor 
stated: 

"In entering upon your duties this session, therefore, 
your attention will be directed to a full realization 
of the extent to which the general economic conditions 
of the world continue to affect all our people, both

urban and rural, and to the fact that the depression 
shows but little sign of abatement even after six 
years of devastating material and moral influence. 1 

It was declared to be necessary, therefore, that the new 
government increase expenditures on direct agricultural 
relief because of the hail and frost "calamities" affect¬ 
ing the crop of the last season. In view of these urgent 
requirements, it would be necessary to enforce the "strict¬ 
est economy" and review the provinces general scheme of 
taxation. The possibility of some social credit legislation 
during the session was intimated in the following words: 

"The economic reconstruction, which my government has 
promised to undertake, presents many problems, the 
solution of which involves new conceptions of human 
rights and social justice...the two year engagement 
of Major Douglas of London, England, as Reconstruction 
Economic Adviser by my former government will no 
doubt be used by my present government to advance the 
introduction and establishment of Social Credit 
principles within the province." 2 

The Social Credit Measures Act ^-the first Alberta social 
credit Act—had a dual purpose: to make a statutory 
declaration of the principles and objectives of social 
credit and to vest in the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council 
both the competence and the power to enact and enforce 
the social credit measures to be set forth in future 
legislation. 

The preamble to the Act establishes that "under modern

scientific conditions, productive capacity is unlimited* 1 ; 
that the present economic chaos demonstrates tT the present 
monetary system is obsolete and a hindrance to the efficient 
production and distribution of goods* 1 ; that the processes 
of invention, discovery and organization have so changed 
social and economic conditions that 11 (the) abundance of 
production has itself created new problems* 1 . The preamble 
continues with the declaration that the T1 electors of the 
province are favourable to the adoption of...a measure 
based on what are generally known as social credit 
principles, their general objects being to bring about 
the equation of consumption to production* 1 . It is suggested, 
however, that **any measure of the nature aforesaid should 
be formulated in such a way that it will be feasible and... 
effective* 1 .4 

This Act, which was to come into force on the day upon 
which it was assented to (s. 9), authorized the Lieutenant- 
Governor-in-Council to **put into operation any measures 
designed to facilitate the exchange of goods and services 
or any other proposal...calculated to bring about the 
equation of consumption and production 11 . In this way 


(4) This note of caution was amplified by the premier in 
the debate on second reading when he declared: n we will 
advance social credit stage by stage. The community is 
sick. When you call in a doctor, you don*t expect him 
to prescribe the whole course of medicine, fie prescribes 
for the first stage only and then watches the condition. 
Then he prescribes for the next stage and the next. 

That is the way it will be with social credit.* 1 (as 
reported in the Edmonton Bulletin . Tuesday, March 17th, 
1936)

the people of the province were to receive 11 the full 
benefit of the increment arising from their association 11 . 

The Lieutenant-Governor-in Council was further authorized 
to appoint a board which would have the power to compel 
the attendance of witnesses or the production of documents 5 
and which would investigate the possibilities of increasing 
consumer purchasing power by means of 11 social dividends 11 , 

11 compensating discounts 11 , the payment to producers of a 
11 just price 11 and the allowance to such producers of a 
1! fair commission on turnover 11 , (s. 3-a) The board was also 
to concern itself with the economic position of all 
businesses and industries in the province and with pro¬ 
vincial economic conditions generally. 

The passage of this Act alarmed many people who 
considered the Legislature had delegated too much !1 blanket 
authority 11 to the Cabinet. For example, one editorial in 
the Edmonton Journal asserted, 

11 •••what it (the Act) empowers the government to do is 
defined in very general language. But this makes it all 
the more objectionable...Those who were entrusted by 
the people of Alberta to pass legislation that they 
deem in the interest of the province have no right to 
part with their authority and confer it on the executive 
in the manner contemplated...The whole economic life of 
the province would be altered by the introduction of 
the principles which the Social Credit party has ad¬ 
vocated. For any action that is taken to implement 
these ideas the Legislature is duty bound to take the 
responsibility and not leave it to the Ministers. 11 6 

(5) The board, in fact, was to be vested with all the auth¬ 
ority given commissioners under the Public Enquiries Act .

The opposition members pointed out that the introduction 
of any social credit plan would very likely involve tax¬ 
ation and expenditures; that for this reason alone "blanket 
authority” should not be delegated to the Gieutenant- 
Governor-in-Council. Premier Aberhart, who made his maiden 
speech in the Legislature when moving second reading of the 
bill, declared: "This is an enabling bill, not a complete 

social credit plan”. "It is not a money bill—social credit 

7 

involves the use of the nation 1 s credit—that ! s all," 

The Conservative, Mr, D.M. Duggan, replied: "This is not 
a bill but a resolution...the preable conflicts with the 
body of the bill...(it) must have been prepared very 
hurriedly...Is there anything requested in the bill that 
is not found in the Public Enquiries Act? I say there is 
not." 7 8 9 

Under the authority of the Social Credit Measures Act 
the Alberta government during the summer of 1936, conducted 
a "registration" of citizens with the view to securing their 
cooperation in establishing a social credit system in the 
province.9 This registration consisted of the signing of 
"covenants" in which the signing individual agreed to 
"cooperate most heartily" with the government. It has

been estimated that 370,000 out of a total population^)! 
772,782 had signed these covenants during 1936. 10 Serious 
objection to the principle of these agreements was raised 
in the Legislature during the Special Session, 1936 by 
G.H. Van Allen, K.C., (Lib.) Edmonton, who wondered whether 
”if one were to complain or to criticize, or to attack 
the government later, he would be regarded as having failed 
to Cooperate most heartily* and therefore denied the 
dividend”. TT The feature of this covenant”, he declared, ”is 
the attempt to compel everyone to cooperate—a fascistic 
method in public affairs.” ^ The order-in-council pre¬ 
scribed four different types of agreements (i.e. a farmer’s 
covenant, a Citizen’s covenant, a Manufacturer’s covenant 
and a retailer’s covenant) and each type contained special 
clauses. For example, the Farmer’s covenant stipulated 
that the farmer agreed— 

”(l) to produce as much as possible of products to be 
consumed in Alberta, or elsewhere, if there is a 
surplus; 

(2) To cooperate with the Alberta government in plan¬ 
ning the supply of products required for the pro¬ 
vince, and the prices at which they will be sold; 

(3) to sell at cost 50 per cent of his products, over 
and above that required by himself and his 
immediate dependents, within Alberta for social 
credit, when called upon to do so, provided the 
price allowed was at least equal to the general 
market price.” 12

Moreover, all covenants contained clauses which hound the 
signatory to accept Alberta Credit and not to 

demand its conversion into Canadian currency. 

As regards clause one, above, it was obvious that the 
majority of Alberta farmers were producing as much as 
possible even before they signed the covenants. Clause 
number two was construed by opposition members as an 
underhanded method of obtaining the farmers' agreement to 
"Fascistic government planning". Finally, with regard to 
clause three it was asked, "why should any farmer wish to 
sell one-half of the surplus wheat for credit, when he can 
get cash for it at the elevators?" ^ Furthermore, it was 
pointed out that the value of Alberta Credit in relation 
to the Canadian dollar was as yet unknown; that the farmer 
should be cautious about the scheme since the government 
had indicated its unwillingness to accept Alberta credit 
as payments for debts due the Crown in the right ofnthe 
province^ On the whole, the covenants had many defects. 
Obviously they had been drafted by amateurs and would have 
raised many legal points had they continued in force for 
any considerable time. It is possible that many who signed 
these agreements had little understanding either of their 
own committments or of the liabilities of the province 
under the terms of the covenants.

The second session of the Eighth Legislature opened on 
August 25th, 1936. The reason for this special session 
was outlined by the Lieutenant-Governor, as follows: 

n 0n account of the calamitous drought which has occurred 
this summer• •.and because of the grave economic con¬ 
ditions resulting therefrom, my government decided to 
call this special session,..further action in regard 
to the introduction of social credit principles...will 
be submitted for your careful consideration. w 14 

The social credit measure of this session was the Alberta 

Credit House Act, 1 ^ which validated O.C. 1092/36 and 

placed the registration an a statutory basis. However, individuals 

were allowed to withdraw from the agreements (until a 

statutorily defined date) and the Superintendent of the 

Credit House was empowered rt to cancel registration when 

satisfied of the existence of certain circumstances 11 . 

Part two of the Credit House Act outlined the constitution 

of the Credit House which was to have a head office in 

Edmonton and branches throughout the province.(s. 12-1,2) 

The Act created a board of management of not more than 

five members to be appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor 

in-Council, (s. 13-1,2) In addition, there was to be a 

Superintendent—the chief executive officer of the Credit 

House—who would 77 transact all business not specified by 

the Act to be Yrithin the sole competence of the Board 17 .

Part three of the Credit House Act dealt with the pro¬ 
vision of credit* TT The principal function of the Credit 
House is to furnish to persons entitled to Alberta credit 
facilities for the exchange of goods and services*., in 
order to effect the equation of purchasing power...and 
production within the province.” (s. 18) Specifically, 
the Credit House would ”receive deposits of Alberta credit 
vouchers...and keep an account of any transfers of Alberta 
credit made by the depositor” (s. 18-b) and ”receive 
currency and all kinds of negotiable instruments.♦.to convert 
the same into Alberta credit...and to make available... 

Alberta credit for the amount thereof”.(s. 18-e) 

Section 21 of the Act, however, declared that ”No 
person whatsoever shall be entitled to demand from the 
Credit House any payment in currency or otherwise in 
respect of any Alberta credit provided pursuant to this 
Act to which he may be entitled, regardless of the nature 
of his title”. Loans to producers were to be made interest- 
free, but a two percent administrative charge was to be 
levied on all such loans.(s. 23-4*6) Sections 27,28 and 29 
empowered the provincial treasurer and the municipalities 
to receive Alberta credit in payment for debts due the 
government and for the provincial and municipal governments 
to pay out Alberta credit to all those willing to accept it. 

Section 30 of the Credit House Act authorized the 
Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council to regulate the ”terms, amount, 
and entitlement of...Alberta credit from time to time” and

to establish the classifications of those persons entitled 
to the credit. However, the Credit House was not to begin 
operations until approved by the cabinet (s. 17) and the 
Act was not to be operative until proclaimed.(s. 36) 

Premier Aberhart began his political career with the 
promise that basic dividends would be forthcoming after 
he had been in office for eighteen months. His first year 
in office was devoted, therefore, to the establishment of 
provincial administration on a financially sound basis. 

On one of his Sunday broadcasts from Calgary he is reported 
to have said, in November, 1935: 

^Remember we have been in power only two months. When 
we took over the treasury we found it empty. The 
credit of the province was exhausted. Now we are 
engaged in surveying the government machinery; 
eliminating overlapping and duplication. We are 
determined to put the province on a solid financial 
basis.” 16 

The political strategy followed by the Liberal and 
Conservative opposition in the Legislature during the 
first year of Social Credit administration, was to press 
for legislation which would implement a social credit 
programme—that is, pay the dividends of $25.00 a month— 
without increasing either taxation or provincial debt. 

When the first budget was brought down by Hon. Mr. Cock- 
roft in 1936 the government was severely criticized by 
the opposition because, instead of establishing social 
credit, a whole raft of new legislation imposing very

heavy taxation was proposed in order to allow the govern¬ 
ment to balance the budget. Chapter 13 of 1936 increased 
the Bates of the Provincial Income Tax; chapters 7 and 8 
levied respectively a retail sales and ultimate purchasers 
tax; chapters 9, 10, 11 and 12,,amended the existing tax 
laws, increasing the yield in some cases. Finally, seven 
separate statutes effected changes in the tax administration, 
especially in connection with collection of arrears. 

Major Douglas who was still officially an adviser to the 
government, took exception to this policy and advocated 
a reduction in taxation.^ However, the majority of Alberta 
social crediters accepted Aberhart’s policy--on this occasion- 
and strongly supported his measures in the Legislature. 

During the two sessions of 1936 there Yte re isolated 
examples of back-bench rebelliousness, but no major policy 
disagreement appeared to split the party’s ranks. ^ Both 
the social credit measures enacted in 1936 fell far short 
of establishing a functioning system of provincial social 
credit exchange. The Alberta Credit House Act, however, 
offered some indication of how the government intended 
to administer such a system. 

(17) In his book The Alberta Experiment , Douglas described 
Aberhart’s approach to the economic problems as 
essentially Rooseveltian in nature. 

(18) Aside from the controversial School Act Amendment Act , 
the government’s measures during both sessions of 1936 
received wholehearted support from the social credit 
private members in the Assembly.

It must not be thought that the rank and file of the 
Social Credit party had abandoned hope in the future 
implementation of social credit; neither could it be expected 
that the majority of members would willingly support a 
ministry which refused to take action on the matter. By 
the end of 1936 the premier was placed in a rather awkward 
position because his eighteen month period of grace was 
rapidly running out. On December 29th the government 
announced that it was preparing "drastic" legislation for 
presentation to the party caucus scheduled to meet on 
January 12th, 1937. At this meeting one of the members 
was reported to have suggested Alberta establish legal 
tender money and !I make every other money in the province 
illegal tender". 1 ^ proposals of this nature raised the 
question of constitutionality once more. Despite the known 
barriers, hoY/ever, it was felt by some that social credit 
might be established by reference to section 92 (13) of 
the B.N.A. Act, 1867. This appeal might possibly be up¬ 
held by the courts and the Dominion*s disallowance power 
was thought to be in abeyance for all practical purposes.2° 
When the Legislature opened in 1937 the extent of party 
deterioration over the issue of social credit was revealed. 

(19) Reported in the Edmontoh Journal , December 31st, 1936. 

(20) These were the opinions held by Mr. W.S. Gray of 
the Attorney-General*s Department, who subsequently 
drafted much of the social credit legislation.

The premier was faced with open insurrection within the 
party. Even before the Throne Speech debate had ended, a 
private member, S.A.G. Barnes, (S.C.) Edmonton, asserted 
that "as a government we have failed to remove poverty 
and unemployment as promised."21 He continued: "The fault 
is in ourselves...We have all blundered through from the 
beginning. We intended to be something different, but 
while we were making promises of a new movement , we pro¬ 
ceeded along old lines. First, we left everything to the 
executive council. We have failed to catch the spirit of 
the new age in the science of government. We have failed 
to realize that the science of elections is one thing and 
the science of administration of government is quite 

another.22 

After the second "orthodox" budget was brought down 
by the new treasurer, Hon. Mr. Solon E. Low, the Social 
Credit "ginger" group made itself felt. First, Mr. A.L. 
Blue, (S.C.) Ribstone, hinted that since the budget was 
not based on social credit principles, it should not be 
accepted by the Legislature.23 Later, a motion by Dr. H. 
k. Brown, (S.C.) Pembina, abruptly adjourned the debate

despite the protests of the premierf^Shortly afterwards 
Dr. Brown charged that Aberhart, in caucus, had been urged 
to bring Major Douglas to Alberta in order to speed the 
establishment of social credit. Aberhart»s reply to this 
proposal, said Dr. Brown, was that f, he would play second 
fiddle to no man".25 Dr. Brown also remarked whether the 
premier "thought he had the divine right to over-ride the 
members?" ^6 Qn the question of whether or not Mr. Aberhart 
should attend the Coronation, A.L. Hooke, (S.C.) Red Deer, 
stated that he was against such a course: "I cannot stand 
seeing some in luxury while others are eating gophers and 
wearing rags". Finally, however, an interim budget was 
passed, with unanimous consent, allowing supply to con¬ 
tinue for a three month period, presumably on the under¬ 
standing that the Cabinet would take positive action on 
social credit establishment. This did not mean that the 
crisis had passed. On April 8th, Mr Barnes tabled a 
resolution which read as follows: 

"Whereas this government has admittedly been unable to 
take the first steps to introduce the principles of 
of social credit in this province: Therefore be it 
resolved that this assembly declare all cabinet offices, 
including the office of premier vacant, and that we 
forthwith proceed to elect a premier and also members 
of his cabinet by majority vote of this legislature. 

(24) The Legislature voted 27 to 25 in favour of Brown 1 s 
motion. There were ten abstentions.

The premier thus named, if he should so desire, should 
be privileged to nominate proposed ministers before 
the final election is made by the whole assembly. The 
present holders of these offices shall be eligible for 
election to any such offices immediately upon their 
appointment.” 28 

Quoting Sir A.B. Keith 1 s Dominion Autonomy in Practice , 

Mr. Barnes indicated that this procedure was followed by 
the Labour government of Australia and in the Irish Free 
State. Mr. Speaker Dawson, however, declined to accept 
the resolution on the grounds that (l) it was an inter¬ 
ference with the duties of the Lieutenant-Governor and 
(2) it was unconstitutional—in the sense that "under our 
authority the premier has po?/er to select his own cabinet”. 
Mr. Speaker continued: ”It may be brought up that a few 
days ago I ruled that the Legislature is master of its 
own procedure. My ruling then was on a question of pro¬ 
cedure, not of constitution”.-^ 

Eventually the crisis passed and Glen MacLachlan,(S.C.) 
Coronation, was dispatched to England to engage Major 
Douglas. On April 14th, 1937, the Legislature was adjourned 
for a ninety day period. As we noted in a previous section, 
Douglas declined to return to Alberta but sent two 
"technical envoys” to advise the Alberta government. On 
Monday, June 7th the Legislature met again to consider 
the proposed social credit legislation.

The Alberta Social Credit Act, being I Geo VI, Chapter 10, 
(first session), 1937, described as T, An Act Respecting the 
Issuance and Use of Alberta Social Credit”, represents the 
culmination of the attempt by the government to establish 
and administer a provincial system of social credit. This 
enactment repealed the Social Credit Measures Act and the 
Alberta Credit House Act. The preamble read, in part, 
as follows: 

"Whereas the people of Alberta, rich in natural wealth 
and resources both actual and potential, are yet 
heavily in debt and have been unable to acquire and 
maintain a standard of living such as is considered 
by them to be both desirable amd possible; and whereas 
the existing means or system of distribution and 
exchange of wealth is considered to be inadequate, 
unjust and not suited to the welfare, prosperity and 
happiness of the people of Alberta...” 

Section 3 of the Act established a Social Credit Board 

consisting of five members whose duties roughly included 

appointing the members of the Commission,(see below); 

appointing the social credit technical experts; examining 

social credit legislation and "making recommendations for 

legislative action in respect thereof”; rendering annual 

reports to the Legislature; recording and^ studying economic 

conditions in the province, and finally, requesting the 

executive council for the advice and cooperation of any 

department of the government. 

Section 4 of the Social Credit Act established a 
Provincial Credit Commission, a body corporate, to be 
composed of not less than three nor more than five members 
to be appointed by the Social Credit Board.(see above)

This commission was to be responsible for the administration 
of the social credit system. It was given the power to 
collect tax levies; to receive and administer any securities 
which were assigned to it; to adjust claims, handle 
settlements and liquidate or adjust debts as between 
individuals and corporations—when application for such 
adjustment was made to the commission; to negotiate any 
transfer of Alberta credit with any firm, person or 
corporate body who would be entitled to such credit and 
whose interests might be affected by the Act; to have all 
the powers granted commissioners under the Public Enquiries 
Act and, lastly, to take the necessary steps to establish 
and maintain a reserve of financial credit T1 sufficient to 
assure that "Treasury Credit Certificates" would always be 
honoured in terms of currency in the extra-provincial 
market. 

The Provincial Credit Commission, in its turn, was to 
appoint a superintent of the Albetta Credit House. This 
organization was to have a departmental status and a 
recognized corporate existence. Section 21 declared the 
Credit House to be "the agency of the Provincial Treasurer 
in circulating credits to effectuate the purposes of this 
Act". Section 25 authorized the Credit House to accept 
surrency and securities on agreement with the depositor. 

The proposed provincial credit system was to operate 
in the following manner: Alberta credit would issue from a

Provincial Credit Account which was to he set up in the 
treasury. Each year the commission would determine the 
value of "unused capacity" of the industries and people 
of Alberta for the production of wanted goods and services. 
The amount of this unused capacity would be the amount 
annually credited to the Provincial Credit Account. 

The "retail discount rate" was to be "a fractional 
figure...to be applied as a discount on the price of 
goods and services offered by retailers".(s. 5-1) The 
commission was to determine the retail discount rate in 
the following manner: "The Retail Discount Rate shall be 
that percentage which unused productive capacity bears 
to total productive capacity."(s. 14-2) "Productive 
capacity" was defined as (l) the total capacity of 
industry and the people for the production of wanted 
goods and services for the immediate preceeding three 
month period and (2) the estimated imports for the same 
three month period."Total consumption", on the other hand, 
was to be computed by obtaining the figure for: (l) total 
actual domestic consumption for the immediate preceeding 
three month period;(2) total exports for the same three 
month period, and,(3) a fixed percentage for capital de¬ 
preciation. Unused capacity was the difference between 
productive capacity and total consumption. The level of 
values to be used in computing both productive capacity 
and total consumption were to be the same—in general.

the Department of Trade and Industry* No retail discount 
rate would be published unless productive capacity exceeded 
total consumption by at least 10 per cent. The commission 
was to have final say on the establishment of the discount 
rate, unless a new rate exceeded the old by more than 5 
per cent, in which case the Social Credit Board would set 
the rate. 

Sections 15, 16 and 17 of the Social Credit Act set 
forth the manner in which the retail discount rate was to 
be applied. After a given date the discount rate would be 
applicable to purchases from retailers made by persons who 
were consumers, provided such purchases were made for the 
personal use of the consumer and not for resale, trade 
or manufacture. Discount vouchers were to be used in re¬ 
imbursing the retailer for his disbursal of the discount 
by selling goods and services at the compensated price. 

In this manner a continuous settlement would be provided 
through the branches of the credit house. 

Retailers, wholesalers, primary producers and manu¬ 
facturers were authorized to make voluntary contracts with 
the commission. Retailers would have to be registered in 

■ttes. 

order for them to qualify to dispense A discount rate 

and, in the case of wholesalers, primary producers and 
manufacturers, in order to qualify them to dispense their 
goods and services to the retailers and to n share with them 
the benefits of increased trade 11 to result from the pro¬ 
gramme. The compensation process for the disbursements of

the discount rate was to begin when the retailer handed 
the credit hrirnse branch discount vouchers evidencing 
such disbursements. The retailer would be credited by 
the amount of vouchers handed in. 11 The amount of all 
vouchers so credited shall be charged to the Treasury 
Credit Certificate Account and the branches, on application 
to the Credit House shall be reimbursed for the demand of 
deposits by the issuance to them of a like amount of 
Treasury Credit Certificates. 11 (s. 17-1) 

The Social Credit Act likewise provided for a ^Provincial 
Consumers* Dividend* 1 , to be paid on the first day of every 
month, to persons entitled to recieve Alberta credit under 
the terms of the Act. 11 All payments of the Provincial 
Consumers* Dividend, and all expenditures in connexion 
therewith, shall be met by the issuance of Treasury Credit 
Certificates...such certificates shall be issued to 
branches or other agencies designated by the Commission, 
and shall be accepted and dealt with by them as a 
Treasury deposit against which credit vouchers in payment 
of the Provincial Consumers* Dividend may be drawn 1 . 1 (s. 18-1) 
The amount of the dividend was to be determined by making 
it approximate that percentage of the provincial credit 
account which was available and not otherwise appropriated— 
as deemed advisable by the commission. In any event, the 
dividends -were not to be an amount less than 5 per cent 
of the provincial credit account.

Section 10 of the Act empowered the Lieutenant-Governor- 
in-Council to declare that "all claims against the province 
shall be satisfied by the transfer to such person of an 
amount of Alberta Credit of the same amount of such...claim, 
and upon...such transfer,...notwithstanding the provisions 
of any Act or any rule of law or equity to the contrary; 
all the rights of such person in respect of such claim 
shall cease and determine..." Section 11, on the other 
hand, empowered the Minister (with the approval of the 
Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, on the Board*s advice) 
to "...accept transfers of Alberta Credit in full or 
partial satisfaction of any claim which the province has 
against any person for taxes or any other account". In 
addition, treasury credit certificates were to be used for 
government services, interest free loans, debt payments, 
export subsidies, or for any other purposed declared by 
the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council. 

Part three of the Social Credit Act dealt with the 
credit house constitution and authorized the establishment 
of a head office at Edmonton with branches throughout the 
province. Broadly the functions of the credit house were 
to establish credit to the account of customers against 
which credit instruments in payment of the consumers* 
dividend could be drawn; to receive deposits of credit 
vouchers and to transfer credits; to receive currency and 
all kinds of negotiable instruments from persons and to

convert them into Alberta credit, (s. 3-27,28) Clearing 
house operations were authorized and section 32 (2) 
stated: "It shall be the responsibility of the provincial 
government to see that the deposits brought into existence 
pursuant to this Act can be validated”. 

Part five of the Act outlined that control would be 
exercised over the Alberta credit structure by regulating 
its supply through open market operations and the manip¬ 
ulation of the discount rate. To this end, therefore, 
a "Treasury Credit Certificate Retirement Fund” would be 
established in the treasury. For the purpose of this 
fund one-quarter of the annual provincial revenues would 
be set aside "over and above the amount required to 
balance the normal budget estimates for that year".(s.34) 

1 In the event that the treasury board considered the 
credit system excessively expanded, they would use the 
currency in the retirement fund to redeem Alberta credit. 
If this process did not check the expansion, the comm¬ 
ission was authorized to establish a "Negative Retail Dis¬ 
count Rate. This, in its effect, would have amounted to 
a retail sales tax (consumption tax) and was to have been 
administered through the credit house. In no case was 
such a tax to be in excess of ten per cent on all goods 
and services. "Payments of the said negative retail dis¬ 
count rate shall be credited by the branches, as received 
by them, to the Treasury Credit Certificate Account, and

the proceeds thereof shall be applied to the cancellation 
or withdrawal of Treasury Credit Certificates in like 
amount.”(s. 35-2) The violation of any part of the Social 
Credit Act involved, on conviction, a fine of $1,000 or 
six months imprisonment, or both. 

The Act, however, was subsequently declared ultra vires 
of the province by the Supreme Court of Canada because 
”in substance.. .this form of administration, management 
and circulation of credit constitutes in our view a system 
of f banking 1 within the intendment of section 91 (of the 
B.N.A. Act, 1867)". 30 


The enactment of the Alberta Social Credit Act was 
the result of a shift in power from the Aberhartian wing 
of the Socail Credit party to the Douglasite wing of the 
party, and, having gained the upper hand in caucus 
deliberations, the Douglasites were not prepared to stop 
after the Act was passed. Much more was yet to come. 

The newly constituted Social Credit Board, during 
the summer of 1937, sent letters to all the banking 
institutions in the province pointing out that !t for 
every dollar owed by the people (to the banks), only 
twenty cents was available for payment.” This anomaly had 
to be corrected, stated the circular, and the banks 'were

expected to cooperate. However, no hint was given as to 
what the banks were expected to do about the situation. 

In August the Legislature met for a brief but momentous 
four day session. The first Act passed was the Credit of 
Alberta Regulation Act.^ 1 The preamble sets forth the 
following points: 

"Whereas bank deposits and bank loans in Alberta are 
made possible wholly as the result of the monetization 
of the credit of the people of Alberta...and. 

Whereas the exteht to which property and civil rights 
in the province may be enjoyed depends upon the 
principles governing the monetization of credit...and. 
Whereas it is expedient that the business of banking 
in Alberta shall be controlled with the object of 
attaining for the people of Alberta the full enjoy¬ 
ment of property and civil rights in the province..." 

Further to this, the Act prescribed that within twenty-one 

days after it had come into force all thode engaged in 

the "business of banking" in Alberta would be forced to 

obtain a license (and pay for it) from the provincial 

credit commission. These licenses would be valid for one 

year only and had to be renewed if the Act was not to be 

violated. Every application for a license had to be 

accompanied by a signed statement that the banker would 

not "engage in activities which would interfere with or 

restrict the civil rights or property of persons within 

the province."(s.3-4) Also the banker was to nominate 

two persons who were to serve on the"Local Directorate". 

All licenses were subject to cancellation at any time

The fee for the "banker’s 0 license was $100 for every 
bank unit doing business in the province; the fee for a 
"bank employee" was $5.00 per head. If a license was 
revoked or suspended the commission was authorized to 
issue a new license, provided the new fee was not in 
excess of the old one by one thousand times. Each of the 
local directorates established by the Act was to consist 
of five members, three of whom would be appointed by the 
Social Credit Board (and two by the banker), to hold 
office during pleasure.(s. 4-2) Section 7 (l) stipulated 
that "any banker required to be licensed by this Act shall 
not, while unlicensed, be capable of commencing or main¬ 
taining any action or other proceeding in any court in the 
province in respect of any claim, in law or in equity". 
However, the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council was authorized 
to repeal this section at any time, by order. 

The next Act of this second session was entitled the 

32 

Bank Employees Civil Rights Act which contained a pre¬ 
amble exactly similar to the Act previously discussed. 

The general intention of this Act was to deprive civil 
rights to bankers who had refused to become licensed 
under the previous Act.(s.3) This statute was not to be 
operative until proclaimed by the Lieutenant-Governor- 
in-Council. 

The next Act worthy of consideration at this point

was the Judicature Act Amendment Act .-^ Section 27(e) 
was added to the Judicature Act; it read as follows: 

"No action or proceeding of any nature whatsoever 
concerning the constitutional validity of any enact¬ 
ment of the Legislative Assembly of the Province 
shall be commenced, maintained, continued or defended, 
unless and until permission to bring or maintain or 
continue or defend such action has first been given 
by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council." 

On August 10th, 1937 the three bills discussed above 
were assented to; on August 11th, Mr. Mackenzie King 
wired Premier Aberhart and asked whether the provincial 
government would take no measures while the Acts were 
referred to the Supreme Court of Canada. Mr. Aberhart 
replied, as follows: 

"We are compelled by the mandate of our people to 
proceed with the enforcement of our legislation and 
with due deference we suggest that the responsibility 
of questioning its validity should be assumed by those 
desiring to render it abortive." 34 

By P.C. 1935/37, dated August 17th, 1937, the three 

Alberta Acts in question were disallowed by the Governor- 

in-Council.^5

(35) Premier Aberhart refused to recognize the Dominions 
disallowance right by refusing to publish the 
appropriate announcement in the Alberta Gazette. 

As a consequence, the Dominion authorities, follow¬

proclaimed the disallowance, over the name of the 
Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta, in a special issue 
of the Canada Gazette , published on September 3rd, 
1937. For other details see the Canadian Annual

Faced with the Dominions power of absolute disallowance 
—a power which many considered could not be competently 
used by the federal authorities—the Premier, the Cabinet 
(excluding the Attorney-General, Hon. Mr. Hugill), and 
the Social Credit Caucus raised one united voice of protest. 
A third session of the Legislature was called ”to deal 
with certain conditions affecting the credit situation in 
our province 11 . ^Legislation will be presented to you for 
the purpose of liberating credit facilities which ?/ill 
enable OUR PEOPLE to enjoy the full benefit of their own 
production.” ^6 In reality, of course, the third session 
was called to reenact the disallowed legislation. The 
first bill of the third session was the Bank Taxation Act , 
which imposed two additional taxes on Banking institutions: 

(1) a tax of one-half of one percent on the paid-up 
capital of all banks doing business in the province and 

(2) a tax of one per cent on each bank T s reserve fund 
and all undivided profits.(s. 3-a,b) Bank managers were to 
submit financial statements to the provincial secretary 

on pain of a fine amounting to $20.00 per day. In the 
case of default in payment of the tax, a penalty of 5 
per cent of the amount of the tax would be added to the 
tax bill; thereafter a further penalty of one per cent 
per month would be added for each additional month the

tax and the penalty remained unpaid.(s. 6) 

Bill number eight of the third session merely re¬ 
enacted the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, but 
omitted all references to banks, bankers and banking. 

Instead, the terms ”credit institutions” and ”the business 
of dealing in credit” were used. Moreover, the new bill 
provided for the local directorates and continued the 
licensing regulations encountered in the previous Act. 

It was freely admitted that the new bill for all practical 
purposes was identical to its predecessor. As one member 
of the Cabinet put it: ”Any institution that restricts 
its activities to section 91 (of the B.N.A. Act, 1867) 
will not be affected. We are interested only in the credit 
of the people, not in the business of banking” 

The ninth bill of this third session was the Accurate 
News and Information Act which declared that— 

”7ftiereas(the public interest requires)that the newspapers 
published in the province should furnish to the people 
of the province statements made by the authority of the 
government of the province as to the true and exact 
objects of the policy of the government and as to the 
hindrances to or difficulties in achieving such object, 
to the end that the people may be informed with respect 
thereto.” 38 

Section 3 of this bill provided that all editors and 
publishers in the province could be compelled to publish 
in their newspapers (when so requested by the chairman of 
the Social Credit Board) any statement furnished by the

chairman which "has for its object the correction or 
amplification of any statement relating to any policy or 
activity of the government of the province"• Each such 
insertion was to be followed by "the foregoing statement 
is published by the direction of the Social Credit Board". 
The bill prescribed that ordinary print was to be used by 
the newspapers in printing such insertions; that the 
correction was to receive the same prominence as that 
accorded the corrected article and that the correction 
was to be printed in the same language as the corrected 
article. 

Section 4 prescribed that every editor or publisher 
"shall, upon being required to do so by the chairman of 
the board, within twenty-four hours after the delivery of 
such requirement at the office (of the editor or publisher) 
...make a return in writing setting out every source from 
which any information emanated...and the name and address 
of the ?n?iter of any editorial, article or news item". 

The bill went on to establish that no libel suit could 
be commenced or maintained on account of the publication 
of any statement pursuant to the Act. Finally, in the 
ease of a violation of the law, the Lieutenant-Governor- 
in-Council was empowered to suspend publication.(s. 6) 

Bills 1, S and 9 irere reserved by the Lieutenant- 
Governor of the province for the signification of the 
pleasure of His Excellency, the Governor-General.

All the avenues which could have been utilized to 
implement a a provincial social credit system had been 
blocked. The Social Credit Act was declared ultra vires ; 
the Governor-in-Council had disallowed three acts—and 
when the provincial government questioned the constitutional 
right of the Dominion Cabinet in this regard, the courts 
declared the Dominion* s disallowance power absolute at 
law and, finally, the Provincial Lieutenant-Govermor 
reserved the last three social credit bills. It was now 
clear that the courts would not accept a social credit 
programme based on the authority of the province under 
section 92 (13) of the B.N.A. Act, 1867.^ 


The first session of the 1938 legislature was opened 
with these words from the Lieutenant-Governor: 

f, The year we are now entering may prove a notable one, 
both as indicating the probable success of the **New 
Economic Order” now being made in this province, and 
throughout the world to accelerate economic readjust¬ 
ment and the establishment of a new social order. 

The period of readjustment upon which we have entered 
presents serious problems, the solution of which 
involves new conceptions of human rights and social 
justice. The solving of these problems, fearlessly 


(39) The questions of the Dominion*s disallowance power, 

the right of the Lieutenant-Governor to reserve bills 
and the right of the province to enact the three 
reserved bills, were argued before the Supreme Court 
of Canada. On March 4th, 1938, the Court ruled that 
the three reserved bills were invalid (i.e. not with¬ 
in the competence of the provincial legislature)• 
Later, in 1938, the Court ruled that the Dominion 
could disallow provincial legislation and that the 
Lieutenant-Governor could reserve his assent to pro¬ 
vincial legislation by virtue of his function as a 
Dominion officer.

Despite the inability of the Alberta government to 
have its social credit legislation validated in law, the 
declared policy of both the government and the Social Credit 
Board during 193S was to intensify efforts to establish 
the New Economic Order. Mr. L.D. Byrne was appointed 
commissioner to the Board and Mr. H.D. Carrigan was to 
act as the Board 1 s Director of Information.^ 1 The first 
Annual Report of the Board was submitted to the Legislature 
on April 6th, 193S. It computed the capitalized value of 
provincial resources at 230 billion and declared that the 
average standard of living could be raised eight times 
by developing these resources at the rate of one-half of 
one per cent per year. The report suggested the possibility 
of an average income of $1,500 for Alberta citizens. The 
Board took credit for inspiring the n drastic T? legislation 
of the previous year and urged that a provincial police 
force be created to replace the R.C.M.P. The report held 
that evidence was 11 overwhelming and conclusive 11 as to the 
practicability of dividends of $25.00 per month together 
with price reductions and a 50 per cent reduction in tax¬ 
ation.

In order to counter the action taken by the courts 
and the Dominion with regard to Alberta social credit 
legislation, another social credit Act was passed by 
the government in the first session of 1938. Not only 
was the Social Credit Realiza t ion Act ^ designed to 
overcome constitutional objections, it was also intended 
to round out the gaps in the social credit system created 
by the Lieutenant-Governor 1 s refusal of assent to the 
three bills passed in the third session of 1937. 

By this Act the Social Credit Board was established— 
the Social Credit Act, 1937, which originally established 
the Board, being repealed by another statute^ and empowered 
to T, devise ways and means for the evaluation, conservation, 
enhancement, advancement and realization of the social 
credit of the People of the Province... n (s. 5); to con¬ 
duct investigations; to suggest policies to the 
Legislature and the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council; to 
11 formulate measures...for the purpose of counteracting 
any action or influence likely to impair or jeopardize 
the social credit of the province; to make such journeys 
as may be necessary and, lastly, to t! appoint such 
technicians, special examiners, statisticians...as may be 
required...and to fix the remuneration and prescribe the

duties of any person so appointed. 11 Sections 16 and 18 
proclaimed that "in the event of conflict, (with any other 
act) the provisions of this Act shall prevail 11 and that 
an annual report be presented by the Board to the Legis¬ 
lature. This Act does little more than vest in the 
Social Credit Board extensive authority. It certainly 
does not contain the controversial aspects of the earlier 
social credit legislation. 

After the passage of the Social Credit Realization 
Act, the annual legislative appropriation for the Board 
was increased from $50,000 to $100,000 and Mr. Byrnes 1 
status was changed from that of Social Credit Commis¬ 
sioner to that of Technical Adviser. In September it 
was announced that an n interim plan 11 would be undertaken 
with the view to giving effect to social credit aims. 

The plan provided for the opening of credit houses in 
the Province and by Order-in-Council, $200,000 was 
appropriated for the purpose. Persons operating accounts 
in these credit houses would be entitled to a consumers 1 
bonus on goods purchased which, the government claimed, 
would increase purchasing power and add to the return 
of producers. By the end of September five credit houses 
were opened. Under the plan merchants would receive 
"transfer vouchers 11 drawn by the purchaser on his account

in the credit house and the bonuses and discounts 
would be applied to products of the province. It was 
stated that the operation of the plan would make possible 
a $3,000,000 rural road improvement project. At the end 
of October the Premier issued a list of 108 merchants in 
Edmonton and Calgary who had signed agreements to parti¬ 
cipate in the credit house programme. It was revealed 
in December that the government was asking civil servants 

to accept 50 per cent of their salaries in Treasury Vou-

The Treasury Branches Act merely validated Order- 
in-Council 1869-38, dated August 28th, 1936 and Order-in- 
Council 1296-38, dated October 18th, 1938, and authorized 
the Treasurer !! to establish and operate at such points 
in the province as he may select branches of the Treasury 
Department* 1 . (S. 3) Section 5 stated: n The Minister may 
receive from depositors deposits of money, bank cheques, 
legal tender, currency, coinage or orders upon treasury 
branches, subject to such terms and conditions as may be 
prescribed in the contract entered into between the Pro¬

the Treasurer and the depositor were to provide for 
interest payments, or in lieu thereof, "there shall be

credited to the account of the depositor such amount 
as may he fixed from time to time by the Lieutenant- 
Governor-in-Council on such portion or portions of his 
deposit used in the purchase of specified goods from 
merchants who have entered into contract with the Mini¬ 
ster pursuant to section 7 of this Act and which goods 
have been purchased by means of orders drawn by the 
depositor upon his deposit in favour of the merchant”. 

(S. 6-3>b) The Treasurer was also authorized to invest 
the deposits in securities or to use them to "make pur¬ 
chases of goods, wares or merchandise for resale”. (S. 4) 
Section 7 empo?/ered the Treasurer to authorize any per¬ 
son or persons on his behalf to ”enter into a contract 
or other arrangement with a merchant with the object 
and for the purpose of implementing the contract entered 
into with depositors”. Section 8 permitted debts due the 
Crown to be paid by ”orders drawn by depositors in the 
Treasury Branches upon their accounts”. Similarly, the 
Treasury was authorized to issue orders drawn on its 
account in payment of ”any expenditures of the Province”. 
Finally, section 10 prescribed that ”all earnings and 
profits of the treasury branches arising in connection 
with the operation thereof” were to be deposited in and 
form a part of the general revenue of the Province. 
Treasury Branch expenditures and liabilities were to be 

met out of funds which w T ould be appropriated from time 

46 

time by vote of the Legislature.

The first amendment to the Treasury Branches Act was 
47 

passed in 1940 when it was enacted: "The Minister, 
either himself or his duly authorized agents, may loan 
any deposits received in the branches of the Treasury 
under the provisions of this Act to persons, firms or 
corporations upon such terms as may be agreed upon and 
in connection with any such loan may take such negotiable 
instruments and securities as he may from time to time 
direct”. (S. 2) 

48 

The second Amendment of the Act declared: "Any 
provision in any contract whereby the Minister has agreed 
to pay to a depositor a bonus on the purchase of speci¬ 
fied goodsjfrom merchants ?fho have entered into contracts 
with the Minister shall no longer be in force or effect 
after the 30th day of April, 1945, and each such contract 
shall be deemed to be amended accordingly". 

49 

The third amendment of the Treasury Branches Act 
provided that the Minister or his agent could receive 
transferable savings certificates (issued under the 
Savings Certificates Act) from depositors, provided that 
the deposits so received were kept in a separate account 
from those received under the ordinary terms of the Act.

The final amendment of the Treasury Branches Act 
deal with the creation of a reserve for "bad or doubt¬ 
ful debts. This reserve was to be created out of the 
earnings and profits of the Treasury Branches. 


The attempt to establish a provincial social credit 
system was terminated by the introduction of the "interim 
plan 1 ’ in 1938. During the wartime period it was gener¬ 
ally understood that no controversial social credit legis¬ 
lation would be introduced. Mr. Aberhart died in 1943 
and was succeeded to the Premiership by Mr. Ernest C. 

Manning. In 1945 there was popular demand for another 

51 

social credit experiment. This resulted in the Alberta 
Bill of Rights. 

The preamble to the Bill sets forth the intent and 
purpose of the legislation. It points out, in effect, 
that the last two wars will have been fought in vain 
unless freedom and security for all within a properly 


(50) 12 Geo VI Chap 30 (1943) 

(51) In the election of 1944 little was said about social 
credit principles. Confronted with the challenge of 
another people*s movement (C.C.F.), the social credit 
campaign propaganda took on the character of a cru¬ 
sade against socialism. However, many social crediters 
undoubtedly believed that another attempt should be 
made to implement social credit programme. In a rather 
hectic annual meeting of the Social Credit League, 
December, 1945, it was urged that the Government 

go forward with a programme to curb the "financial 
interests" and distribute the basic dividends, now 
ten years overdue.

functioning democracy is made a reality. The pre¬ 
amble goes on to state that Alberta possesses abund¬ 
ant resources, both physical and human, and that, 
under the British North America Act, it is the con¬ 
stitutional responsibility of the Province to legis¬ 
late with respect to the property and civil rights of 
its people. 

The operative portion of the Act is divided into 
two parts: the first outlines the rights and responsi¬ 
bilities of Alberta citizens; the second purports to 
establish the "methods 11 by which those rights can be 
realized in actual experience. In the forev/ord of a 
copy of the Bill printed by the King ! s Printer for mass 
distribution, the following statement appears: 

fl It is most important that this very definite dis¬ 
tinction (that is, as between Parts I and II) be 
kept in mind, otherwise there is a real danger of 
people being led astray into purposeless arguments 
on the technical aspects of the methods proposed 
in Part II, thereby losing sight of the objectives 
set out in Part I. These objectives are all import¬ 
ant in that they embody the results which the people 
generally wish to see achieved. 11 *2 

In addition to the general rights of citizenship, the 

Bill specifies, 

(a) that every citizen of Alberta of not less than 
nineteen years of age and under sixty years of 
age, is entitled to the opportunity to engage

in gainful employment or if that is not avail¬ 
able, to a social security pension; 

(b) that every citizen under nineteen is entitled 
to the necessities of life, educational and 
medical benefits; 

(c) that every citizen who has reached age sixty 
is entitled to retire and receive a pension 
(not less than the social security pension) 
authorized from time to time by the Legislature, 
together with medical benefits; and, 

(d) that every disabled citizen is entitled to a 
social security pension together with medical 
benefits. 

The Bill defines !f medical benefits 1 ’ as all necessary 
medical, hospital, surgical and dental care given by 
a recognized practitioner without cost to the person 
receiving such benefits—or in the case of a minor, 
without cost to the guardian. A ”social security 
pension” is the payment to individuals of claims on 
goods and services within the limitations of the natural 
resources of the Province and the productive capacity 
of the people, to insure an annual income of not less 
than $600.00 a year at the 1945 price level, for every 
single citizen of the Province, age nineteen or over. 

In the case of married couples, however, such a n pension” 
would amount to $1200. 

Section 14 authorizes the Lieutenant-Governor-in- 
Council to classify occupations as coming within the 
meaning of ^gainful employment” and to enter into agree¬ 
ments with the government of Canada or of any Province

which may be deemed necessary to cariy out the pur¬ 
poses of the Act. The Cabinet is further empowered 
to issue orders governing the determination of any 
questions which are apt to arise under the Act and the 
procedure to be adopted, and in particular with respect 
to the qualifications of any person for high school 
and University education, the availability of gainful 
employment, the eligibility of any person for a social 
security pension and medical benefits, the eligibility 
of any person to receive a pension upon reaching the 
age of sixty years, and the amount of such pension to 
be paid. 

Part II of the Alberta Bill of Bights is concerned 
with the "regulation" of credit and provides for the 
issuing to credit institutions of Alberta Credit Cer¬ 
tificates authorizing the creation of a corresponding 

53 

amount of "credit deposits". Section 16 authorized 

the appointment of a Board of Credit Commissioners which 
by section 17 were to have authority to license all 
credit institutions in the province and make regulations 
as to license fees and so forth. Any such credit insti¬ 
tution conducting operations without a license was to

which have been made available to persons as claims 
against goods and services. Against these deposits, 
credit institutions were to have no corresponding 
reserve of currency.

be penalized; in such cases the Board, with the Cabinet 1 s 
approval, could enter the premises of a credit insti¬ 
tution and take over the business—provided this did not 
interfere with operations performed under the authority 
of the Bank Act, 1934* with deposits of customers or the 
right of the depositor to deal with his own deposits. 

The Bill defined a "credit institution" as "any person, 
corporation or oganization whose main business is dealing 
in credit by keeping accounts of consumers’ credit deposits, 
transferring credit deposits from the account of any 
customer to any other person, exchanging credit deposits 
for currency or making credit deposits available to cus¬ 
tomers". However, any person, corporation or organ¬ 
ization whose main business is the production or distri¬ 
bution of goods or the rendering of any service, which 
is not concerned mainly or exclusively with dealing in 
credit deposits, is not included in the definition of a 
"credit institution". Because of this distinction, trust, 
incurance, mortgage and trading concerns would not be 
classified as "credit institutions" under the Act. 

Section 18 prescribed that a Capital Assets Account 
be established which would include (l) an estimated 
evaluation of the natural resrouces of the Province, 
both developed and undeveloped; (2) an estimated 
evaluation of buildings, plant, public utilities and

so on and, (3) an estimated evaluation of the capitalized 
productive capacity of the people. Section 19 authorized 
the Board to establish a ^Consolidated Credit Adjustment 
Fund” to which would he issued, by the Board, against the 
capital assets account, credit deposits tT in such amounts 
as may from time to time be required as a reserve, for 
providing an adequate volume of credit deposits to 
finance the production and distribution of goods and 
services in the province, and maintaining a balance 
between the aggregate purchasing power of the people of 
the province, and the estimated collective prices of 
goods for sale in the province”. 

Section 20 authorized the Board, with Cabinet approval, 
to transfer from the credit adjustment fund to the general 
revenue account, such amounts of credit deposits necessary 
for the payment of social security pensions and other 
transfers. Further, the Board could issue Alberta Credit 
Certificates to credit institutions ”in order to enable 
them to issue credit deposits to customers over and above 
the deposits against which a reserve of currency is held”. 

Section 22 provided that if the aggregate purchasing 
power of the people at any time exceeded the estimated 
collective prices of the goods for sale, the Board would 
report this condition to the Cabinet which could take a

number of steps outlined in the section—one of which 
could be the withdrawal of credit certificates from the 
credit institutions. Section 23 provided that at least 
every three months the Board would report to the Minister 
on the extent to and the manner in which the credit of 
the province was being utilized. Again, the object appears 
to have been to equate purchasing power and the collect¬ 
ive prices of goods and services for sale. 

While it is clear that the Bill of Rights represented 
one more attempt to establish social credit on a provincial 
basis, it must also be observed that it contained one 
section which was never found in the earlier legislation: 
it was not to have been enacted until its validity was 
tested by the courts. Because of the nature of the Bill 
of Rights, it was a good indicator of the extent to which 
the Alberta Social Credit movement as a whole, had 
abandoned its earlier radical tendencies. When the Bill 
was presented to the annual meeting of the Social Credit 
League in 1946, it aroused neither great enthusiasm with¬ 
in the movement nor violent antagonism from without. It 
was generally felt that the Bill would be declared ultra 
vires , and when the expected adverse judgment of the 
Alberta Supreme Court was upheld by the Judicial Committee 
in 1947, the decision was received apathetically by most 
Social Crediters.

The attempt of the Alberta Government to implement a 
provincial social credit system failed because the admin¬ 
istrative machinery implicit in such a programme could 
not be fitted into the "Victorian angularity" of the 
B.N.A. Act, 1867. The courts refused to sanction a social 
credit system framed within the "property and civil 
rights clause of section 92; they upheld the right of the 
Governor-in-Council to disallow provincial legislation 
and the right of the Lieutenant-Governor to refuse assent 
to provincial bills. Consequently, and in order to 
realize at least some of its aims, the Social Credit 
government instituted an "interim plan", centred around 
the Treasury Branch system but with the object of effect¬ 
ing a general quickening of the economic life of the 
province—increased production within the province, bonuses 
to citizens for the consumption of Alberta-made products, 
adequate marketing facilities for primary producers and 
the provision of low-cost credit facilities for all the 
people of the province. 

The flurry of "drastic" legislation enacted during 
the two special sessions of 1937, can be interpreted in 
two ways: on the one hand, it was the positive expression 
of ill-will on the part of a debtor community towards the 
financial interests which allegedly were exploiting its 
members; on the other hand, it was an expression of 
administrative frustration—cooperation at all levels

being absolutely essential if a provincial social credit 
system was to be practicable. It has been established that 
the bulk of this legislation of 1937 was inspired by the 
Social Credit Board, in reality a committee of the 
Legislature, and not by the Social Credit Ministry. It 
is possible that much of the controversial legislation 
was initiated over the protests of Rremier Aberhart and 
the cabinet. Labouring under a tremendous administrative 
burden and faced with open rebellion in his party ! s ranks, 
the premier may easily have consented to the use of 
Dou&lasite methods for reasons of practical expediency. 
Possibly he may have realized that in view of the con¬ 
stitutional and administrative difficulties involved in 
the establishment of a system, it would perhaps be best 
to postpone its immediate implementation. In this regard 
the role of the parliamentary opposition is significant. 
Not only did the Social Credit "ginger" group clamour for 
an immediate social credit system—so did the small but 
very effective Liberal and Conservative opposition. This 
political fact doubtless contributed, in part, to the 
premier f s "go slow" policy. 

The administrative framework which was to give effect 
to the proposed social credit programme falls into a 
fairly uniform pattern in all the statutes under review. 
From a practical viewpoint, cooperation was the first 
necessary ingredient if the programme was to be a success.

The administrative instalment for providing this cooperation 
appears in the voluntary contract and even, to some extent, 
in the repressive legislation of 1937. It is worth observing 
that the voluntary contract was incorporated in the interim 
plan and that even today it remains a factor in the admin¬ 
istration of the Treasury Branch system. 

Another feature of the proposed social credit administrat¬ 
ive structure was an omnipresent board, independent in many 
respects, of the cabinet, but answerable ultimately to the 
Legislature. The powers given the board vary from statute 
to statute, reaching their culmination in the board created 
by the Social Credit Realization Act, 1936. In general, 
however, the board usually had wide appointive and regulatory 
powers. 

Between the board and the credit institution there was 
usually a commission which was to direct the technical 
aspects of credit circulation. In the Social Credit Act, 

1937, it was the task of this administrative body to com¬ 
pute provincial "unused capacity”, thereby establishing 
the amount of the "retail discount rate”. Similarly, the 
commission was responsible for determining the amount of 
the "consumers* dividens” to be distributed. 

The provincial credit institution was to have a central 
head office with branches throughout the province. In 
general, this body was to conduct normal banking operations— 
to receive currency in exchange for Alberta credit; to com¬ 
pensate retailers for selling commodities at the adjusted

price and for advancing interest-free loans in Alberta 
credit to producers. 

The whole administrative structure was to be integrated 
with the Treasury Department and provisions were made for 
maintaining a balanced credit structure. If the amount of 
outstanding Alberta credit was causing severe inflation, 
the currency held in the treasury certificates retirement 
fund would be used to redeem Alberta credit. If this was 
unsuccessful, the ”negative retail discount rate” would be 
applied and administered through the several branches of 
the credit house. 

But there was one exception to these general provisions: 
the Alberta Bill of Bights appears to have envisaged not 
the creation of a state-owned credit house, but the 
utilization of existing ”credit institutions”. It is to be 
assumed, however, that the Treasury Branches would have 
fallen within this category. In this case the existing 
state-owned credit house would not have had a monopoly 
of the circulation and administration of Alberta credit, 
a condition peculiar to the earlier social credit legislation. 

Douglas 1 reform proposals were three in number: the 
socialization of the credit structure, the issuance of 
dividends and the establishment of a just price mechanism. 

The Social Credit Act of 1937 incorporated these three 
proposals insofar as they could be applied as a supplement 
to the national financial system. The Bill of Bights, on 
the other hand, abandoned the just price proposal completely

and rejected dividends in favour of social security pensions 
and other benefits. In the former Act, the emphasis upon 
price reductions at the retail level, the use of the non- 
negotiable credit instruments, are characteristically 
Aberhartian. Nowhere in the Social Credit Act, however, 
is mention made of the unearned increment levy. 

From the economic viewpoint it is difficult to draw 
conclusions as to whether or not the proposed Alberta 
social credit programme would have been successful in 
terms of increased production and employment. Such an 
analysis, to be at all accurate, must presuppose a 
knowledge of conditions under a functioning social credit 
system. Assuming that Alberta credit had become widely 
acceptable—not too realistic an assumption in view of 
the experience with dated stamp scrip, see below, pp. 

—inflationary tendencies could probably have been kept to 
manageable proportions if the credit policy of the govern¬ 
ment followed cautious lines. In general, the matter of an 
adequate currency reserve to allow retailers and whole¬ 
salers to convert Alberta credit in order to meet extra- 
provincial obligations, appears to have been given in¬ 
sufficient consideration. The increased expenditures 
resulting from the distribution of Alberta credit might 
have strengthened the rate of investment, but, on the 
other hand, the psychological results of the political 
activities of the Alberta government could hardly be 
described as conducive to increased investment.

CHAPTER V 


ALBERTA DEBT LEGISLATION 















- 119 - 


V 

"Aberhart let me keep my farm, what do I care about 
the constitution?.*•” 

The social credit conception of debt, both public and 
private, is premised on the fact that the orthodox financial 
structure is inherently defective, failing to distribute to 
consumers sufficient purchasing power to enable them to 
buy the goods and services which the community is capable 
of producing. This monetary deficiency is partially offset 
by a large and permanent increase in consumer debts. In 
this way much of the output which otherwise could not be 
distributed has been purchased by consumers through their 
extensive mortgaging of future income. Social credit theory, 
however, recognizes that this device cannot be extended 
indefinitely and that it does, by itself, constitute a 
considerable evil. In this manner, it is argued, a faulty 
financial system produces a "debt-creating system”, which 
instead of giving consumers the means of paying for goods, 
assures them the means of acquiring goods for which they 
cannot pay. The debt process, according to Douglas, was 
seriously begun in the seventeenth century but— 

”...By the end of the 18th century the world debt—and 
we have pretty accurate figures with regard to these 
matters—had increased by 466 per cent, and by the end 
of the 19th century the world debt, public and private, 
had increased by 12,000 per cent, and according to some 
very exact calculations which have been carried out by 
a quite irreproachable professor of industrial engineer¬ 
ing of Columbia University, Professor Rautenstrauch,

taking the year 1800 as the origin and taking one 
hundred years as the unit, the world debt is now 
increasing as the fourth power of time...the present 
financial price system is merely self-liquidating, 
but is decreasingly self-liquidating...In those 
. times of boom...the rate of increase of debt is 

greater than in times of depression...in real fact., 
there is no justification for saying that, at any 
time of the trade cycle, the price system is self- 
liquidating.” 1 

In Alberta the problem of the debt burden seldom 

required such technical exposition. As we noted earlier 

private debt and western agricultural practice were 

physically inseparable. Because of the great demand 

for credit and because of the risks involved, interest 

rates were generally higher in the prairie provinces 

2 

than in the central and maritime provinces. 

Prior to 1935 a considerable body of private debt 
legislation appeared on the Statute Books of Alberta. 
Most of this early legislation was premised on the 
idea that a contract between two parties could not be 
maintained if it imposed a continuous and impossible 
burden on one of the parties. Albertans have fre¬ 
quently contended that ”a discussion of sanctity of 
contract is incomplete without consideration of the 
impossibility of its performance”. These words of 
J. M. Keynes were therefore quite acceptable to

debt-ridden farmers and their representatives in the 
Alberta Legislature: 

"Nothing can preserve the integrity of contract 
between individuals, except a discretionary author¬ 
ity in the state to revise what has become intoler¬ 
able. The powers of uninterrupted usury are too 
great. If the accretions of vested interest were 
to grow without mitigation for many generations, 
half the population would be not better than slaves 
to the other half." 3 

The Exemptions Act , an Ordinance passed 1898, pro¬ 
vided that certain property of an execution debtor— 
generally a homesteading debtor—was exempt from seizure 
under all writs of execution. The Extra Judicial Sei - 
ures Act of 1914* provided that all extra judicial sei¬ 
zures had to be made by a sheriff or his deputy and 
that all such seizures were void unless specifically 
sanctioned by a judge. This Act was amended in 1923, 
1929, 1930, and 1931, resulting in its clarification 
and allowing the debtor ample time to present his case 
in a court. The Soldiers* Relief Act , 1916 and 1918, 
and the War Belief Act , 1918, were designed to provide 
soldiers with a time extension to meet their debt obli¬ 
gations. 

Climatic conditions in the dry south of the province 
necessitated the Drought Area Relief Act . 1922, which

allowed debtor farmers in the area to retain a sufficient 
portion of their annual crop proceeds to enable them to 
maintain themselves and continue farm operations until 
the harvest of 1923. A Commissioner, whose writ stayed 
all legal process, was appointed to administer the Act 
until it was set aside by the court. This Act was 
replaced in 1923 by the Debt Adjustment Act , which con¬ 
tinued the provisions of the former Act for another year. 
Moreover, a Debt Adjustment Board was established whose 
certificate would stay proceedings against the debtor ! s 
property. However, a creditor could apply to a district 
court judge for leave to proceed and the judge had full 
discretionary power to dispose of the application. In 
1930, 1931, 1932, and 1933 the Debt Adjustment Act was 
amended and its provisions were extended to Resident 
farmers” and ^resident home-owners”. For all debts 
which arose before July 1st, 1932, against resident far¬ 
mers and home-owners, no creditor was permitted to bring 
action unless he first obtained permission from the Board. 

Chapter 3 of the second session 1936, described as an 
”Act to Amend and Consolidate the Debt Adjustment Act, 

1933”> was the first formidable piece of private debt 
legislation enacted by the Social Credit Government. This 
Act constituted a Debt Adjustment Board as a body corporate

with power to conduct investigations and appoint agents 
to act on its behalf. The Board was further empowered 
to appoint local committees, whose membership was not 
to exceed three, for the purpose of administering the 
Act. The right of a creditor to appeal to a court 
after the Board had issued a certificate prohibiting 
proceedings was expressly denied. Further to this: 

Board approval was thereafter required before the commence¬ 
ment of proceedings against debtors who were resident 
farmers, home-owners or those v/ho occupied homes as 
tenants. Section 34 (l) stipulated that the Lieuten- 
ant-Governor-in-Council could at any time and from time 
to time by proclamation— 

"(a) authorize, insofar as the same may be within the 
legislative authority of the Province of Alberta, 
the postponement of the payment of all or any 
debts, liabilities or obligations, existing or 
future, however arising, or of the enforcement 
of all or any liens or incumbrances, or other 
securities, whether created before or after the 
coming into force of this Act; 

(b) prohibit in any judicial district the issue of 
any process out of one or more of the courts of 
the Province in all or any classes of civil actions, 
or the execution of process already issued in such 
actions, or stay proceedings in civil actions and 
matters of any description pending in such courts, 
or extend or otherwise vary the exemption privi¬ 
leges which execution debtors now enjoy. 0 

During the same session the Reduction and Settlement of 

Debts Act (Chapter 2) divided debts into two classes— 


old and new. On all debts which arose before July 1st, 1932,

no subsequent interest payments were to be necessary; 
all such payments were to be deducted from the principal. 
Section 1 of the Act authorized the liquidation of these 
"old" debts by annual installment payments. Section 8 
prevented the creditor from taking action against the 
debtor for the non-payment of installments except with 
the permission of the Board. On all "new" debts—those 
arising after July 1st, 1932—simple interest not in 
excess of five per cent was payable. 

This Act was found to be unconstitutional by Mr. 

Justice Ewing in the Supreme Court of Alberta on February 
19th, 1937. Later the Appellate Division upheld the deci¬ 
sion of the lower court. Prior to the rendering of the 
judgment, however. Premier Aberhart stated that in the 
event of such a finding, the Government would proceed 
in the Legislature with a Bill to cut the principal of 

A 

all debts by one-half. 

On June 17th, 1937, the Alberta Debt Adjustment Act 
(1937) repealed the Act of 1936 but again provided for 
the appointment of a Debt Adjustment Board which was to 
be a body corporate with the power to appoint agents 
and delegate authority. By this Act debts were again 
divided into two clasps: those existing prior to 
July 1st, 1936, and those arising after that date. The 
Act provided that no legal action could be undertaken

with respect to the collection of any debt arising 
before the said date. This measure was also consider¬ 
ably broadened in its application—instead of applying 
to all resident farmers, home-owners, etc., it was to 
apply to all resident debtors. No chattel mortgage to 
secure any past indebtedness given by a farmer on or 
after May 1st, 1934> was to be considered valid unless 
approved by the Board within sixty days after its 
execution. 

During the first session of 1933, four important 
Acts respecting private debt were passed. The Home - 
Owners y Security Act (Chapter 29) prohibited foreclosure 
actions on rural homes under mortgages executed before 
March 1st, 1933, and similarly on urban homes unless $2,000 
was deposited for the benefit of the home-owner in the 
event of foreclosure being permitted. The Limitation 
of Actions Act (Chapter 23) prohibited any action to 
enforce debts created on or before July 1st, 1936, 
between the time the Act was proclaimed and March 31, 1939. 
Further the Act provided that certain actions in respect 
of debts incurred prior to July 1st, 1936, must be com¬ 
menced befoifeJuly 1st, 1940, and that action to recover 
such debt could be commenced after the latter date only 
if the debtor had entered into a new payment agreement

between the two dates. The Debt Proceedings Suspension 
Act (Chapter 25) specified in section 3, 

"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, and not¬ 
withstanding any rule of law or equity to the con¬ 
trary, in the interval between the coming into force 
of this Act and the first day of March, A.D. 1939, 
no process shall be issued out of any court of the 
Province for the purpose of enforcing the payment 
of any debt." 

Section 4 then prescribed that all civil proceedings in 
respect of any debt pending in any provincial court at 
the time of enactment, were stayed until after March 1st, 
1939. The effect of this Act was to stop all debt pro¬ 
ceedings until after the above date. However, it was 
not to be operative until proclaimed. Finally, the 
Debt Adjustment Act Amendment Act (Chapter 27) provided 
that any debtor could apply to the Board for a certifi¬ 
cate exempting him from all actions, if he first arranged 
to deposit with the Board an annual amount for creditor 
distribution. 

In the second session, 1933, the Debt Adjustment Act 
was amended once more and debt agreements between debtors 
and creditors were to have no effect until they were sub¬ 
mitted for review by the Board. 

By Chapter 30, 1939, the Limitation of Actions Act was 
amended and provision was made to cancel all debts founded 
on contract which originally arose before July 1st, 1936,

unless an action on the debt was brought before July 
1st, 1942. The Soldiers* Relief Act , 1940 provided that 
servicemen be accorded tax exemptions and debt relief. 

In 1941 the Orderly Payment of Land Debts Act attempted 
to establish the principle of "ability to pay" as the 
central feature of provincial debt legislation. Section 
3 stated that "until the first of May, 1943, no farmer 
debtor shall be deemed to be in default under a mortgage 
or agreement for sale, if in any year during that period 
the crop shall yield less than 10 bushels per seeded acre". 
Section 4 declared: "No urban debtor shall be deemed to 
be in default unless he is in receipt of a minimum 

/ 

income of $1,000 for the 12 months immediately preceding.". 
Again, during 1941> Chapters 3, 4, 42 and 43 were concerned 
with private debt. 

On December 2nd, 1941, the Supreme Court of Canada held 
the Alberta Debt Adjustment Act (1937) ultra vires . Chap¬ 
ter 5 of 1942, the Legal Proceedings Suspension Act , 
referred to the fact that the Debt Adjustment Act had 
questionable validity, but that an appeal was being carried 
to the Judicial Committee on the matter. The Act stipu¬ 
lated that all actions raising the validity of the Debt 
Adjustment Act were stayed until sixty days after the 
appeal had been given. Early in 1943 the decision of the 
Supreme Court of Canada was upheld in London.

When the validity of Alberta 1 s Debt Adjustment Act 
was questioned in the courts, the Independent party in 
the Legislature charged that this had happened "because, 
through the actions of the Social Credit Government, the 
impartial administration of the Debt Adjustment Board 
was lost and public confidence in the Board had vanished". 
Despite the attempts of the Minister of Municipal Affairs 
to "plug the holes" in 1941* the Act was again declared 
unconstitutional. Mr. J. C. Mahaffy, K.C., opposition 
leader in the Legislature, commenting on the debt legis¬ 
lation of 1942, said: 

"Debt adjustment Acts were always of doubtful legal¬ 
ity, but they were never attacked. I believe that 
was because they were fair in their terms, were 
fairly administered and because everyone realized 
they were necessary with 30-cent wheat, 2i-cent 
cattle and low priced hogs." * 

In Alberta, he continued, the administration of the Debt 

Adjustment Act was subject to frequent "intermeddling" at 

the hands of the Minister of Municipal Affairs. 

"Last year I asked him (Mr. Maynard) how many cases 
the Minister interferred in the disposition of cases 
before the Board. The Governments failure to answer 
that question corroborates the idea that the Minister 
intermeddled in the affairs of the Board. It was 
said at that time that if a strong supporter of the 
Government appealed to the proper powers in Edmonton, 
the Board would never grant a permit to sue for a 
debt against him."

Mr. Mahaffy concluded that private debt had been made a 
"political football" by the Government, and "in a foot¬ 
ball game of that type" he said, "There is only one loser- 
the private debtor". One of the Social Credit slogans 
in 1940 had been "If Aberhart goes out, the Sheriff comes 
in". This admitted Mahaffy, was clever by political 
standard^ "but by any other measure, it was misrepresen¬ 
tation". He went on to declare that his party*s views 
of the private debt problem were not what the Social 
Crediters made them out to be. Alberta*s debt legislation, 
like its relief legislation, he said, was faulty because 
it stressed the temporary nature of the problem. "We 
have long since realized, or should have realized, how 
wrong it was to work on that foundation. I suggested last 
year that, in his debt legislation, the Minister of Munici¬ 
pal Affairs was merely applying perfume instead of taking 
a bath." 

The Minister in question denied these charges of inter¬ 
meddling" by reference to the personal qualities of the 
Board members who, he declared, "would not put up with" 
political interference of any sort. Mr. Maynard did admit, 
however, that on many occasions representations were made 
to himself and the Board by the members of all parties in 
in the Legislature. But these cases were always considered 


on their merits

”There was not one case where I can say that there 
was any unfairness in the debt adjustment admini¬ 
stration.” ° 

The Minister revealed that between 1937 and January, 1942* 
the Board dealt with 36,555 cases and had settled 16,390. 

Of this number, 10,613 permits had been granted to take 
legal action to collect debts; in 3,417 cases permits to 
take action had been refused—with direction to the debtor— 
and in 2,786 cases permits were refused with no direction 
to the debtor. In dealing with the applications before 
it, the Board (said the Minister) had no record of the 
politics, race or religion of the debtor or creditor— 
it never considered such questions. 

The result of the Governments private debt legislation 
was evident in 1942 when the Provincial Treasurer, Mr. Low, 
stated that for a four year period lending corporations 
had refused to make loans in Alberta under the terms of 
the National Housing Act. In order to substantiate this 
fact the Treasurer tabled certain correspondence between 
Provincial Secretary, Mr. E. C. Manning and Mr. Jules 
Fortin, Secretary of the Dominion Mortgage Loan Associ¬ 
ation. Mr. Manning in a letter dated July 9th, 1941, 
had requested a reason for the lack of investment in 
Alberta. On September 28th, Mr. Fortin replied as

follows: 

**The experience in Alberta in resent years has been 
that legislative measures enacted by the Alberta Leg¬ 
islature and administered under the direction of the 
Alberta Government have greatly increased the ordinary 
risks of business in Alberta.•.The companies consider 
that they would be disregarding their trust if they 
were to place at risk in Alberta additional moneys in 
the face of past experience and in the absence of 
evidence that the legislation and policies represented 
thereby are to be modified to the position where the 
creditor may recover moneys advanced by him with 
interest within the measure of the debtor*s assets 
and ability to pay.” 7 

This letter, stated the Treasurer, supported the govern¬ 
ment* s view that the companies were deliberately refusing 
to make loans and that they held out for repeal of the 
Alberta debt adjustment legislation. 

After the decision of the Judicial Committee that the 
debt adjustment legislation was ultra vires , the provincial 
government made a last attempt to protect debtors by 
enacting the Debtors * Assistance Act . This enactment 
repealed the Debt Adjustment Act, 1937, but prescribed 
that a Debt Assistance &oard be created **to assist and 
advise debtors in adjusting their debts and in working 
out satisfactory arrangements for the settlement of their 
debts with their creditors* 1 . The Board was further em¬ 
powered **to arrange meetings between debtors and creditors** 
and to assist debtors in the preparation of plans for the 
n settlement of their debts before any Board or Court which 
...may be set up (by the Dominion) for the settlement of

debts". Although the Board was again vested with extensive 
investigatory powers, it was not accorded the sweeping 
powers it had had under previous Acts, 

The private debt legislation of the Alberta government 
was undoubtedly designed to supplement that of the Dominion 
government. In 1934 the Dominion attempted to deal with 
the debt problem by enacting the Farmers T Creditors Arrange 
ment Act and by amending the Canadian Farm Loan Board Act . 
The former Act provided that the dominion establish Boards 
of Review in the several provinces with the power to 
adjust debts both as to principal and interest. A board was 
duly established in Alberta and many cases were heard. In 
some instances the burden of debt was substantially reduced 
Certain deficiencies in the administration of the Act, how¬ 
ever, forced the provincial government to believe that the 
Dominion legislation by itself could not adequately deal 
with the debt problem. In the first place, one board could 
not cope with the number of applications presented it 
during the year. Secondly, the Act did not apply to the 
personal representatives of a deceased farmer. Naturally, 
this placed a hardship on the surviving members of the 
family. Moreover, the board was not permitted to reopen 
and amend a proposal formerly dealt with by it. This 
administrative inflexibility proved highly unsatisfactory 
in view of the continued crop failures experienced by 
debtors. Further, the board could not dispose of claims 
in cases where no privity of contract existed between the 
two parties. During the first few years of the Act ! s

operation there was a tendency for the board to favour 
all first mortgages, on the assumption that the principal 
of such mortgage should not be reduced and that the rate 
of interest on such an instrument should not be reduced 
below 7 per cent per annum. On the other hand, unsecured 
claims were often dealt with drastically, deductions as 
to principal running anywhere between 25 and 75 per cent 
with no interest allowed. Finally, the Farmers 1 Creditors 
Arrangement Act gave no relief to urban debtors. 

In practice,the amendment of the Canadian Farm Loan Act 
which was intended to extend agricultural credit (up to 
$7,500 per loan), did not fill the credit requirements of 
the farmer. The general administration of the Act appears 
to have been designed to prevent any possible financial 
loss to the Dominion Treasury.^ Accordingly,loans were not 
made in certain areas of the province at all or, when 
advances were made, they were usually a small percentage 
of the limit prescribed by the Act. Furthermore, the 
interest rate charged by the board was often declared to 
be excessive in view of the long-term nature of the credit 
extended. Clearly the two Dominion Acts did not mesh very 
well in practice and those farmers who did obtain relief 
under the Farmers 1 Creditors Arrangement Act were often 
unable to secure adequate credit under the amended Canadian 
Farm Loan Board Act.

Because of the deficiencies in Dominion debt legislation 

and in view of the importance of debt relief to the citizens 

of the province, the Social Credit government felt justified 

in following a ”comprehensive” debt adjustment policy, 

always keeping just one step ahead of the courts. From the 

legal viewpoint much of Alberta*s private debt legislation 

was undoubtedly bad. Creditors as legal persons were denied 

the right of appeal from the decisions of an administrative 

tribunal. In some cases the provisions of different statutes 

were in conflict, while in other cases, different Acts 

prescribed a similar course of procedure. At the same time, 

however, the relief accorded debtors by the governments 

policy was extensive and, under the circumstances, socially 

9 

desirable. 


A complementary feature of the attempted establishment 
of a provincial social credit system was the public debt 
policy of the Alberta Social Credit government during its 
first few years in office. In previous pages some attention 
has been given to the burden of private indebtedness in 
Alberta. As yet, however, the problem of the burden of 
public debt has not been considered. 

The Hon. J.R. Love, provincial treasurer, brought down 
the last D.F.A. budget on March 8th, 1935. In the fiscal

year ending March 31st, 1936, he predicted a deficit on 
income account of $700,000, after allowing for sinking fund 
payments of approximately $730,000. For the same period he 
estimated a deficit on capital account of $4,095,000. The 
estimated total overall deficit for 1935-1936, therefore, 
amounted to approximately $4,795,000. 10 As at December 31st, 
1934, the total net funded and unfunded debt of Alberta was 
$135,800,000 and $13,650,000. 11 


(10) Admittedly, this is a rather crude way of estimating 
the total annual deficit. It has been used to give the 
overall financial picture of estimated provincial 
operations during 1935-1936. The deficit figure was 
obtained in the following manner: (l) revenues on 
income account, $15,331,774; expenditures on income 
account, $15,302,000, leaving a deficit on income account 
of $699,4^9, after providing $729,253 for sinking funds; 
(2) revenues on capital account, $971,255; expenditures 
on capital account, $5,065,626, leaving a a deficit on 
capital account of $4,094,371; (3) deficit on income 
account plus deficit on capital account equals 
$4,793,850.

From October 4th, 1930, to December 31st, 1934* total relief 
outlays in Alberta were $20,837,173, of which the province 
paid $8,654*671. Throughout these years the U.F.A. govern¬ 
ment financed relief expenditures out of capital account; 
that is, by increasing the debt. Relief expenditures were 
not met out of current revenues. While the Minister admitted 
the financial picture was not bright, he felt that an 
increase in taxation was not feasible. He further stated 
that the provincial income tax was not as productive as 
had been anticipated and that the Dominion should vacate 
this field of taxation in favour of the provinces. This 
would yield the province an annual estimated additional 
revenue of $1,300,000. Finally, Mr, Love stated that while 
the government did not intend to follow policies prejudicial 
to the credit standing of the province, it did, nevertheless, 
favour a refunding scheme under which debt service charges 
could be reduced from $8,200,000 to $6,100,000. 

The U.F.A. government had been in power since 1921 and, 
in general, it had adhered to established economic principles 
and policies. In the 1935 budget debate Mr. Hov/son, the 
Liberal leader, charged that the government was under the 
influence of the ”money barons” and that it was wedded to 
the present edonomic and monetary system. 12 Major Douglas, 
the government’s ^Economic Reconstruction Adviser”, had 
urged the government to take drastic action and establish 

(12) In their elation concerning the possibility of an 

electoral victory, the Liberals had become advocates 
of radical measures. They even pledged themselves to 
consider social credit measures, if elected.

a social credit system* Douglas 1 "Interim Report", which 
was confined to "possible methods and strategy with regard 
to the preliminary object, that of obtaining access to the 
public credit",anticipated opposition from the Bank of 
Canada acting on behalf of the "international bankers"* 
Douglas further admitted that the legal position was by no 
means clear* But while the Dominion possessed clear 
authority in regard to printing legal tender, the province 
had jurisdiction over "property and civil rights" and hence, 
the right to engage in "certain" credit activity. He 
concluded that there was a considerable area suitable for 
provincial action. Because of the volume of imports 
required by the province, he suggested that a reserve of 
foreign currency or credit be established for this purpose* 
The retaliatory activities of the financial authorities 
could be "pilloried" through the agencies of the press and 
broadcasting. And there was always the possibility of 
further sanctions "which do not contemplate essential re¬ 
pudiation", because of the existence of a large external 
public debt and the pressure on external producers for 
continued sales receipts in Alberta. 

As a preliminary step Douglas advocated (l) the system¬ 
atic provision of official news services, especially in 
regard to radio broadcasting; (2) the organization of

a provincial credit institution under the Dominion Bank 

Act or otherwise "which will give access to the creation 

of effective demand through the credit system", and 

(3) the immediate provision of stocks of currency and 

foreign credits. In his covering letter to Premier Reid 

he made two further suggestions: a coalition government 

to be formed as early as possible and a new Department 

of Public Relations to be organized specifically for 

dealing with the irresponsible popular criticism of 

administrative activities. The Douglas report elicited 

5 

little official recognition and its author returned to 
England with a folio of statistics on provincial economic 
affairs. The "Economic Reconstruction Adviser" never 
returned to conclude his employment with His Majesty 1 s 
Government of the Province of Alberta. 

The emotional intensity generated throughout the 
Province by the Social Credit victory of August 22nd, 

1935 9 prompted many public creditors to cash in their 
Alberta Savings Certificates. These instruments had 
been issued during the * twenties as a method of internal 
financing. After recognizing about $214,000 of these 
obligations the new Government abruptly suspended pay- 


(5) The Attorney-General, Hon. J.F. Lymburn, declared on 

reading the Douglas report that it was predicated on the 
power of the state to issue purchasing power or money 
and that the Provinces had such power. Moreover, the 
idea that each province should have such authority, 
in the Attorney-General*s opinion, "was foreign to 
the whole conception of Confederation".

ment, leaving roughly $9,000,000 worth outstanding* 

During the autumn and winter of 1935 and 1936 other 
bond maturities fell due but these obligations were met 
with Dominion assistance. Early in 1936, however, the 
Dominion authorities hinted that further assistance of 
this nature would be conditional upon Alberta 1 s accept¬ 
ance of Loan Council Supervision—at least with regard 
to loans obtained outside the province. Premier Aberhart 
rejected this proposal on the ground that the fiscal 
autonomy of the Province would be impaired. Accordingly, 

on April 1st, 1936, the Province defaulted on a principal 

16 

obligation valued at $3,200,000. 

The Estimates presented by the new government for the 
fiscal year ending March 31st, 1937, included in Income 
Account those expenditures anticipated on direct relief 
and certain public works formerly included in expenditures 
on Capital Account. Anticipated revenue on Income Account 
amounted to $18,350,000 and estimated total expenditures

balance, $2,846,000 was not redeemed.” Public Accounts 
of the Province of Alberta (1936) p. 76. 

Previously, in January, 1936, an Alberta maturity 
of 2 millions was financed by the Federal Govern¬

were set at $18,316,000, leaving an estimated surplus 
of $34*000, after providing $1,497,000 for direct 
relief and $713,000 for sinking funds. On the other hand, 
revenues on Capital Account were an estimated $664,000 
while expenditures were to be $ 3 , 247 , 000 , 

In his Budget Address, the Hon. Charles Cockroft 
explained how the increase in revenue ($3,268,619 over 
the estimated revenues for the 1935-1936) was to be 
raised. First, by reason of the increase in population 
it was estimated that the Dominical subsidy would be in¬ 
creased by $234*900—assuming provincial population had 

17 

climbed to the 800,000 figure. Second, administrative 
changes with regard to liquor distribution were expected 
to yield approximately $300,000 in additional revenue. 
Third, the government intended to repeal the Supplemen¬ 
tary Revenue tax (2 mills on rateable lands) which 
yielded $900,000 and substitute therefor a Social Ser¬ 
vices Tax (3 mills on rateable lands) to produce an 

18 

estimated $1,233*000. 

Finally, a new 2 per cent Retail Sales and Ultimate 
Purchasers tax was to net an estimated $2,000,000 after 

(17) As it happened, provincial population for 1936 did 
not reach 800,000. This estimated increase in the 
Dominion subsidy did not materialize.

certain commodities had been exempted. The rates of 

Provincial Income tax (both for persons and corporations) 

were to be increased and additional revenue from $650,000 

20 

to $1,200,000 was anticipated from these sources. The 

Fuel Oil Tax was to be extended to provide approximately 

21 . 

$200,000 in extra revenue. Mr. Cockroft stated in 
his Address that this increased taxation was necessary 
in view of the transfer of unemployment relief expendi¬ 
tures from Capital to Revenue Account, but that the 
Government would still be required to meet expenditures 
resulting from a $ 2 , 549,144 increase in the debt, after 
setting aside roughly $1,000,000 for sinking funds. 

In his analysis of the Province^ debt position the 
Treasurer stated: 

22 

”0f the net general debt of $123,643,694*77 we 

find that $64,611,234*11 is represented by expendi¬ 
tures on roads and ferries, bridges and public 
buildings; loans partially secured of $8,232,935, 
both of these figures being book values. Of the 
remainder $30,735,695.46 is made up of capital losses, 
discounts, unemployment relief, losses on railways, 
telephones, etc., and $20,043,809 consists of advances

deducting $30,279,332.72 from the total net funded 
and unfunded debt of $153,923,027.49. This figure 
consisted of loans and advances fully secured, working 
advances and the readjusted debt of the Alberta 
Government Telephones.

to income (General Revenue) account since the 
formation of the province. ” 23 

Further, the Treasurer asserted that interest payments, 
sinking fund and expenses arising from the general 
revenue portion of the debt had increased from $46,531.10 
in 1909 to $7,137,338*25 in 1935. Regarding the govern¬ 
ments policy with respect to the burden of debt service 
charges, he declared: 

”In increasing taxation to the extent we propose, we 
are more firmly convinced that the refunding of our 
debenture debt at a lower rate of interest must be 
accomplished. When it is realized that nearly 50 
per cent of our total revenue is expended in debt 
charges, the greater portion of which is withdrawn 
from the province and from which our people receive 
no benefit, it becomes painfully clear that this 
crushing burden is rapidly draining the resources 
of our people.” 24 

Given the Alberta Budget of 1936, it is evident that 

if the new Government did not intend to increase provincial 

debt, estimated revenues would stand some $2,549,000 short 

25 

of actual cash requirements. In order to cope with this

of Hon. Charles Cockroft to the Legislative Assembly. 

(24) Ibid . March 3rd, 1936. 

(25) This computation is made with reference to both General 
Revenue (income) and Capital Account. Mr. Cockroft’s 
estimates indicated a surplus in General Revenue of 
$34,222, and a deficit in Capital Account of $2,583,267 
(revenues, $664,509, expenditures, $3,247,776). By 
subtracting the surplus in General Revenue Account 
from the deficit in Capital Account ($2,583,267 minus 
$34,222) we obtain $ 2 , 549 , 045 , the actual estimated 
provincial operating deficit for the year 1936-1937.

situation, the government could have had recourse to 
two alternatives: first, it could have embarked upon

arbitrarily reduced the interest rate on outstanding 
debentures* With a view to following the first course, 

26 

the Provincial Loans Refunding Act was passed in 1936, 
which provided for the compulsory refunding of provincial 
debt at lower interest rates. This Act, however, was 
not to be operative until proclaimed by the Lieutenant- 
Go ver nor- in-Council. This approach to the problem, it 
should be noted, would have provided relief, but only 
after considerable time had elapsed. The second alterna¬ 
tive, on the other hand, offered the prospect of immediate 
relief and the government finally determined on this 
policy. Accordingly, on May 30th, 1936, Order-in-Council 
734/36 reduced the rates of interest payable on the 
Funded Debt of the Province by one-half (with a minimum 


(26) I Edw. VTII, Chap. 6. Section 6 of this Act author¬ 
ized the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council to enter 
into agreement with the Dominion, permitting the 
latter to guarantee provincial securities. Section 
4 authorized the issuance of n Alberta Perpetual 
stock**. Compulsory retirement of provincial secur¬ 
ities was authorized by section 5, payment to be 
made in money, perpetual stock, or other securities 
issued pursuant to the Provincial Loans Act .

27 

June 1st, 1936* In this manner the financial dilemma 

was avoided (much to the consternation of the bondholders) 

and a saving of $3,600,000 was effected. 

Following this, the bondholders formed a Protective 

Committee” and on June 11th, 1936, met with the Alberta 
28 

cabinet. Though unable to persuade the government to 
postpone its interest reduction policy, they did succeed 
in obtaining permission for Mssrs. Elliott and Walker 
to conduct a study of the financial position of the 
province. 

The Elliott-Walker report, written in thirty days, 
concluded that there is capacity on the part of Alberta 
to meet full provincial interest payments from the 


(27) The Alberta Gazette . June 15th, 1936, pp. 391-392. 
According to Professor G.E. Britnell, Alberta carried 
an average coupon rate of 4.9 per cent; the cut 
reduced the average rate payable to roughly 2.5 per 
cent. See Britnell, G.E., Canadian Journal of 
Economics and Political Science , "Alberta, Economic 
and Political; II. The Elliott-Walker Report: 

A Review”, November, 1936, p. 525. 

(28) The Bondholders 1 Committee was headed by Mr. J. M. 
Macdonnel, general manager of the National Trust 
Company and it included representatives of Canadian 
and American life insurance companies and mortgage 
companies, certain cities in western Canada and 
the United Church of Canada.

aggregate net income of the people of the province". 
Having established "undoubted economic capacity to pay" 
the report states, "that Alberta has reached a point 
where a completely balanced budget is within her grasp,♦ . 
that the present sources of revenue are sufficient, 
without increase in the funded debt, to meet the usual 
costs of services of government and justify full interest 
payments". In 1929 Albertans debt was considered as 
being "not materially out of line" with that of the 
other Canadian provinces. Since 1929, however, despite 
tax increases, a net increase in "unproductive" debt 
was evident; budget deficits of $13,000,000 (excluding 
deficits on telephone system) and relief expenditures 
of $17,000,000 being capitalized. The last two items 
accounted for a net increase in debt charges of 
$2,300,000 until, in 1935, total annual interest charges

amounted to $ 8 , 400,000 or roughly 50 per cent of total 

30 

provincial revenue. 

Despite its conclusions, however, the Report was not 
over-critical of the governments expenditure programme, 
chiefly in view of the new tax and administrative policies. 
There was no suggestion, for example, that social ser¬ 
vices be reduced—except possibly the proposal to close 
one of the two Provincial Normal Schools. But the 
Report questioned the validity of the 1936 budget with 
regard to expenditures. It was argued that the budget 
over-stated expenditures by $1,358,000 through charging 
to current (General Revenue or Income) account items 
which might have been charged to capital account. Fur¬ 
ther administrative economies involving a saving of 
$256,700 were also feasible. Finally, it was proposed 
that a suspension of payments to the sinking fund and 
of interest payments on provincial securities held by 
the sinking fund would reduce expenditures by $197,000 
and $400,000 respectively. If these suggestions were 
followed, the Report concluded, the estimated deficit 
for the year could be reduced to $838,750—which sum 

(30) The report estimated that the Province had lost $11.5 
million on railway enterprises; $11 million on rural 
telephones and somewhere between $6 and $10 million 
on irrigation projects.

could be financed” by slight adjustments in the admini¬ 
stration of motor license and income tax revenues. It 
should be noted in passing that the Report 1 s major 
readjustmait item, the $1,358,000 mentioned above, would 
have resulted from charging certain items to capital 
account, which, in fact, would have increased debt out¬ 
standing—a policy which the government was not at all 
prepared to follow. Further, while the Report may have 
strengthened the bondholders 1 view that the government's 
policy was essentially one of Repudiation” rather than 
one of sheer inability to shoulder the burden of debt 
charges, it by no means follows that the saving effected 
by reduction of interest payments ($3,600,000) n would 

31 

not provide an important or effective measure of relief”• 

In a word, the Elliott-Walker report suffers from three 
fundamental deficiencies: (l) the income analysis em¬ 
ployed to prove the primary proposition, namely that 

Alberta possessed Undoubtedly ability to pay”, is open 
32 

to question; (2) the budgetary analysis used to show 


(31) Cited in Britnell, G. E. Op. Cit ,, p. 532.

this phase of the Report. The authors used 
Dominion Bureau of Statistics income statistics and 
from the estimated total net value of production 
plus the estimated value of certain services 

they deducted retail sales plus an allowance for 
the services of certain gainfully employed groups.

how the government could balance the budget and at the 
same time meet full interest payments largely begs the 
question, eince such a proposal clearly envisaged a sub¬ 
stantial increase in debt and (3) the general conclusions 
of the Report, while logically impeccable were psychologically 
impossible, particularly in view of the "financial philosophy" 
of the Social Credit government.33 

In the second session, 1936, the Provincial Securities 
Interest Act confirmed, ratified and validated Order-in- 

o I 

Council 734/36 dated May 30th, 1936, The statutory reduction 


(32) Cont’d—The"margin of income" obtained by this method 
varied from year to year and w r as very substantial— 
for example, 1927, #261.7 million; 1934* $90.8 million, 
etc. Allowance for double counting and ommissions, how¬ 
ever, provided for a wide margin of error. For example, 
D.C. MacGregor has shown that the 1930 "balance" should 
have properly been minus #14 million rather than the 
Report 1 s plus $34 million. 

(33) In compliance with a motion tabled in the Legislature 
by G.H. Van Allen, (Lib.) Edmonton, correspondence 
between the premier and Major Douglas (February 10th 
to March 21st) was made public. This information 
revealed that while Douglas did not recommend the 
government adopt a repudiation policy, he did suggest 
that the impending maturity requirements be used as 
"an opportunity to?*ards a practical step to social 
credit". Specifically, Douglas suggested a "paying off" 
plan whereby Alberta bondholders were to be made aware 
that "credit in Alberta of the amount of the face 
value of the bonds, plus 15 per cent had been opened 
with the state treasury, in their favour". This 
credit was to be available for the purchase of any 
product, whether wheat or otherwise, for sale in 
Alberta at a price ruling at the same time the credit 
was drawn upon. (Edmonton Bulletin , April 3rd, 1936)

in interest rates payable applied to t! all debentures here¬ 
tofore issued by the Province, all treasury bills issued 
by the Province, all savings certificates...and all debentures 
guaranteed by the Province save and except only the $7,400,000 
five percentum debentures of the Alberta and Great Waterways 
Railway Company”. Under section 3 (2) the rights of security 
holders were defined: ”No person shall be entitled to recover 
..•any interest at a higher rate than...(is) hereby pre¬ 
scribed in respect of that security...and action shall be 
brought or maintained...in respect of any such security or 
for the purpose of enforcing any foreign judgment founded 
on any such security”. Chapter 12 of the second session, 

1936, entitled the Municipal Securities Act provided for 
a maximum interest rate of three per cent per annum in 
respect of any municipal security. 

The Provincial Securities Interest Act was challenged 
in the courts when an action was brought by the Independent 
Order of Foresters against the Lethbridge Norther Irrigation 
District, to recover fmll interest on $181,000 of the bonds 
of the district, came before Justice Ives in the Alberta 
Supreme Court, February 15th, 1937. On February 23rd, the 
Act was declared unconstitutional, notwithstanding that 
section denying the right of action against its provisions. 

The judgment also allowed the claim for full interest 
payments. 

During the first session of 1937, the government enacted 
three new measures designed to place its reduction policy

on a sounder statutory basis. The Provincial Securities 
Interest Act (Chapter 13, 1937) defined the interest rate 
payable on "all debentures heretofore issued by the province, 
all stock...issued by the province, all treasury bills and 
all savings certificates issued by the province". Section 
5 of this Act repealed the Provincial Securities Interest 
Act (Chapter 11, second session, 1936) mentioned above. 

The Provincial Guaranteed Securities Proceedings Act 
(chapter 11, 1937) placed a prohibition on all actions 
and proceedings concerning any aspect of interest reduction, 
without the consent of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council. 

The Provincial Guaranteed Securities Interest Act (Chapter 12) 
specifically defined the interest payable by the province 
on the various securities guaranteed by the province. 

Action was again brought by the Independent Order of 
Foresters against the Lethbridge Northern Irrigation 
District designed to test the validity of Chapters 11 and 12, 
1937. The case was heard by Justice Ewing of the Alberta 
Supreme Court on October 9th, 1937, and in his judgment of 
November 1st, he held Chapter 12 ultra vires , and Chapt er 
11 invalid as it affected the case on which judgment was 
given. The court eventually awarded a writ of execution for 
collection of the interest from the Irrigation District. 

On December 10th, 1937, the government filed notice of 
appeal against these judgments. On January 21st, 1938, the 
appeals were heard and Justice Ewing 1 s judgment was upheld. 

On September 19th, 1938, the Appellate Division granted

leave to the province to appeal to the Judicial Committee. 
Again, however. Justice Ewing T s judgment was upheld. 

In his budget address of 1937, the Hon. Solon E. Low 
reviewed the financial position of the province. An interim 
financial report for the ten months of the fiscal year 
1936-1937, to January 31st, 1937, showed an excess of 
receipts over expenditures on income account of $2,252,847 
excluding relief payments of which the provinces share 
was $1,930,926. As at January 1st, 1937, the net funded and 
unfunded debt of the province amounted to $159,807,075, 
an increase of $1,725,725 over March 31st, 1936. For the 
fiscal year ending March 31st, 1938 an estimated surplus 
of $1,965,570 was anticipated, to be obtained by continuing 
the reduced interest payments and deleting the usual pro¬ 
vision for sinking funds. In these estimates some 
$2,161,435 for relief expenditures was anticipated. Mr. Low 
stated that revenues from the sales tax had been approx¬ 
imately $1,000,000 less than had been estimated; that the 
annual Dominion subsidy payments were $239,000 less than 
had been expected. 

Because of these features, and because a balanced budget 
without excessive capital deficits was still the policy of 
the government, Mr,Low outlined a new tax policy designed to 
meet the provinces requirements. Taxes on Banks would be

companies, $80,000,-^ on gas and power companies, $47,000 
and on miscellaneous companies, $130,000In addition, 
an extra $450,000 was expected from the sales tax, $300,000 
from liquor profits and, because of the change in the 
license year, $607,000 from motor licenses. The provision 
for reduced interest charges would save an estimated 
$2,487,087. 

During 1937 the Bank of Canada had been commissioned to 
examine the financial affairs of the three prairie 
provinces. The report on the province of Alberta was 
submitted to the Minister on April 7th. While questioning 
the repudiation tactics of the Alberta government from the 
viewpoint of the long-run economic effects of such policies, 
the report did state that because interest charges had been 
reduced by $ 3 , 400 , 000 , the province was in a better 
financial position compared with Saskatchewan and that it 
could balance revenues and expenditures without borrowing 
from the Dominion.

which included $1,000,000 in redeemed savings certificates, 
leaving roughly $500,000 to he added to the debt. On August 10th, 
1937, the sales tax had been suspended and the loss of 
revenue caused by this was to be offset by increased revenue 
from other sources. The budget estimates were based on a 
continuance of interest payments at half the coupon rate. 

New taxes imposed were a tax on mineral lands ^^and a two 
per cent tax on securities.4° The wild lands tax was 
restored and increases were made in the income tax, 
succession duties and the unearned increment tax. 

By 1939, the combined transactions on income and 
capital accounts resulted in an overall surplus of 
$1,083,494,43.^ The total net funded and unfunded debt 
aggregated $157,015,416.93—a net decrease from the 
previous year of $1,715,524.32 being chiefly accounted 
for by the redemption of Alberta savings certificates. 

Successive overall surpluses were reported in 1940, 

1941 and in subsequent years, while at the same time 
the total net funded and unfunded debt was progressively 
reduced.

Faced with a decreasing public debt and an annual over¬ 
all surplus on income and capital accounts, the government, 
in 1941, decided to undertake a large-scale debt refunding 
programme. An Alberta Refunding Committee was established, 
consisting of the representatives of the bondholders and 
the government, but progress was virtually impossible at 
this stage of negotiations.^ In the spring of 1942 the 
government decided that if the bondholders objected to a 
refunding of the complete $144*000,000 in one operation, 
it would be best to proceed in "progressive steps".44 
The results of the first phase of negotiations were made 
public in the summer of 1942 when the bondholders proposed 
(l) a basic four per cent rate of interest, (2) the recog¬ 
nition of arrears of interest, and (3) the provision for 
differentials in the coupon rate on outstanding bonds to 
maturity. These proposals were rejected by the government. 

In a review of the debt situation in 1943* Mr. Low 
declared: 

"The past due debentures, as at next Wednesday, March 31st, 
1943* will stand at the sum of $25,310,338, and maturing 
through the year will be bonds amounting to $8,536,115* 
Arrears of interest as at March 31st, 1943, will amount 
to approximately $22,000,000. The average coupon rate of 


(43) In 1941, Mr. Low stated: "It is the governments 
policy to proceed with ways and means of refunding 
the public debt (but) negotiations for refunding at 
lo?/er interest rates has had the effect of crystal- 
izing the opinion of certain interests and holders 
of our bonds". (Edmonton Bulletin , March 5th, 1941)

interest is 2.44 per cent, as compared with 4*95 per 
cent average paid at June 1st, 1936." 45 

By accepting the terms of the bondholders, he said, interest 

costs would increase by $1,792,000 annually, and a cash 

outlay of $28,537,000 would also be required to provide 

for the arrears of interest plus the differential* The 

treasurer stated further that a basic four per cent 

interest rate was not comparable to the prevailing rate 

on provincial securities and that it would preclude the 

setting aside of an amount adequate for debt retirement* 

According to the government, the bondholders should have 

been willing to cancel all arrears of interest, since the 

restoration of the market value of the bonds was more 

important than either the rate of cupon interest or the 

provision of arrears. 

At this stage of negotiations deadlock resulted with 
neither side prepared to compromise. In 1944 Premier Manning 
placed the responsibility for Alberta T s debt problem on 
the Bank of Canada. He stated that if the central bank 
had performed the function for which it had been created, 
and had tackled the problem of public financing by taking 
over the public debts of all the provinces and the leading 
cities, Alberta T s debt principal could have been reduced 
by $25,000,000 in the eight preceeding years.

"Even at the if per cent discount rate now quoted by the 
Bank", he said, "the provincial debt could have been 
decreased by $15,000,000." ^ 

By 1945 the government decided that positive action 
on the debt matter would have to be taken, notwithstanding 
the uncompromising position adopted by the bondholders 1 
committee. Accordingly, Premier Manning, in his capacity 
as treasurer, announced the government’s retirement pro¬ 
gramme in his budget address of March 9th. 

"We already have over $34,000,000 of bonds in default 
and substantial additional amounts are falling due 
each year. The disputed unpaid interest is now in 
excess of $25,000,000, as a result of which the Province 
is faced with increasingly difficult legal complications 
While members of the (bondholders’) committee have 
intimated some willingness to accept the overall rate 
of interest (3i %) proposed by the Government, their 
acceptance is predicated upon the province recognizing 
in full the unpaid portion of the interest since 1936, 
together with differentials in coupon rates on their 
outstanding bonds to maturity. These two factors 
involve an amount of approximately $32,000,000...The 
Alberta Government is not prepared under any circum¬ 
stances to agree to such an arrangement." 47 

But in fairness to all concerned, continued the premier, 

"we can no longer defer making a definite offer to the 

holders of our bonds, notwithstanding the fact that our 

offer will not be acceptable to the bondholders’ committee". 

Accordingly, each bondholder was invited to exchange his 

bond on the following basis: 

"The holder of a six per cent debenture, now receiving 
three percent, may exchange his bond for a new bond

bearing interest at three and one-half per cent, and 
will receive an adjustment of $9.00 per hundred (of 
principal)• The holder of a five per cent bond will 
receive a new three and one-half per cent bond, 
together with an adjustment of$7.50 per hundred. 
Similarly, the holder of a four per cent bond will 
receive a new three and one-half per cent bond and 
an adjustment of $6.00 per hundred.” 43 

All told, the amount of this compensation, based on 100 

per cent exchange of bonds, was estimated at $ 8 , 400,000 

which was approximately one-third the amount saved to the 

province by the deduction in interest payments from 

June 1st, 1936 to June 1st, 1945. The adjustment sum was 

to be financed ”from previous years’ cash surpluses”, and 

the overall debt reconstruction was to be based on the 

cancellation of all Alberta bonds held in the sinking 

funds and other ”portfolios” of the government. The whole 

refunding scheme was expected to reduce gross debenture 

debt by $15,800,000, leaving a net outstanding debt of 

$113,200,000, for which value the new debentures would be 

issued. Treasury bills to the value of $1,659,000 held 

in sinking funds would also be cancelled. Finally, a sum 

of $2,000,000 was to be set aside annually to cancel debt, 

either by purchase or by call—a call feature was inserted 

in the new bonds to facilitate this process or to allow 

for refunding at a lower rate. This minimum debt retirement 

of $2,000,000 per year was calculated to reduce interest 

charges by $70,000 annually. And if this saving was applied 

to further debt retirement, the entire sum of $113,200,000

could be extinguished in thirty-three years. A completely 
debt-free structure would effect an estimated annual saving 
to the province of approximately $4,000,000. 

In order to give statutory effect to the debt refunding 
programme, the Provincial Debt Reorganization Act was 
passed during a special session of the 1945 Legislature. 

The plan was to become operative when 75 per cent of the 
outstanding debentures and registered stock was deposited 
with letters of acceptance signed by the individual holders, 
and when the sale of new debentures totalling $29,565,000 
had been negotiated. By October 6th, 1945, the required 
amount of debentures had been deposited; on October 24th, 
the programme was declared operative. The adjustments for 
unpaid interest, together with the premium adjustments in 
the case of unmatured bonds, required a cash settlement 
of $17,565,000, of which $9387,733 was obtained from the 
Dominion government under an amendment to the Tax Transfer 
Agreement, leaving a balance of $8,117,267 to be paid by 
the province. 49 £he remaining interest and premium adjust¬ 
ments amounting to $10,827,000 were to be paid over a five 
year period, without interest, and represented by special 
talons attached to the new three and one-half debentures. 

(49) The portion of the cash settlement provided by the 

Dominion was made up of a grant of $2,400,000 respect¬ 
ing a fiscal subsidy of $600,000 per year for the 
years 1937-1941 and under the debt service option, 
with respect to the Tax Transfer Agreement, an increased 
annual grant of $1,746,933 for the years 1941-1945, 
making the total of $9,387,733.

With the appearance of annual overall surpluses the 
vigorous taxation policy of the government was progressively 
relaxed* In August, 1937, the retail sales tax was suspend¬ 
ed; no new taxes of a general nature were imposed after 1938. 
The Corporations Temporary Additional Taxation Act and the 
Banking Corporations Temporary Additional Taxation Act were 
continued until 1942 and then allowed to lapse. From 1939 
to 1941 existing tax legislation was amended seventeen 
times, in most cases providing for an increase in revenue.5° 
In 1942 the province withdrew from the personal income and 
corporation tax fields in accordance with the Dominion- 
Provincial Tax Transfer Agreement. For the fiscal year 
ending March 31st, 1941* these two taxes yielded jointly 
$3,237,710.63; for the fiscal year ending March 31st, 1942, 
they produced $3,167,132.28.^ The following Dominion pay-

Tax Transfer Agreement:

The Tax Transfer Agreement was merely a wartime 
expedient to enable the Dominion to vigorously pursue the 
war effort, and since it was to expire on March 31st, 1947, 
it had either to be re-negotiated or allowed to lapse. 
Accordingly, following the Dominions failure to produce 
a scheme acceptable to all the provinces during 1945 and 
1946, negotiations were re-opened in 1947 with each 
province individually. Alberta agreed to enter the new 
plan by refusing to collect personal and corporate income 
taxes 52 an 3 succession duties, in return for a ^guaranteed 
minimum” annual Dominion payment to be determined by the 


(51) The Public Accounts of Alberta ,(1943) p. 52. 

(52) See Chapter 2, 1947, The Tax Collection Suspension Act , 
(s. 2-a,b). Provision ’was also made to allow the province 
to levy a corporation income tax of 5 per cent ”on the 
income of corporations attributable to their operations 
in the Province”, which amount would be collected by the 
Dominion on behalf of Alberta.(s. 3-b,c)

amount which the sum of the following: 

(a) $12.75 multiplied by provincial population, 1942, 
to be computed by the Dominion statistician in the 
following manner: Population 194& (census) minus 
Population (1941 (census) divided by five to obtain 
the annual increase. 

(b) $2,040,430.32 (roughly fifty per cent of the Dominion 
payment under the Tax Transfer Agreement, 1942) as 
equivalent to the total revenue received by the 
province in respect of income, corporation income 
and corporation taxes during the fiscal year of the 
province ending nearest to December 31st, 1940, and, 

(c) the amount of $1,794*561.00 being the estimated 
Dominion statutory subsidies payable to the province 
during 1947, 

exceeded the Dominion subsidies payable during that year 
in which the guaranteed minimum annual amount was payable. 
This minimum amount, however, was merely a safeguard. With 
an expanding population and high levels of Gross National 
Product, Alberta is annual income from this source was 
expected to be greatly in excess of the statutorily defined 
guaranteed minimum 11 . Since 1947, therefore, with a 
guaranteed annual amount of roughly $12,000,000, the province 
has collected the following amounts from the Dominion in 
excess of the normal statutory subsidies: 


1947 ... $9,903,880.44 

1948 . .... 14,024,149.78 

1949 . 15,276,192.32 

1950 . 12,936,073.47 w 


(53) The figure for 1950 is an estimate given by the C.K. 
Huckvale, Provincial Auditor, in his interim Financial 
Statement for the nine months ended December 31st, 1950. 
The 1947-1949 figures are taken from the Public Accounts.

The debt policies of the early Social Credit adminis¬ 
tration represent the crystallization of attitudes which 
had become widespread in Alberta and the other prairie 
provinces concerning the protection of the property 
rights of debtors as against those of creditors* Clearly 
the burden of public and private indebtedness had been a 
major factor in placing the Social Credit party in office 
and between 1935 and 1942 the government did its utmost 
to provide relief to the hard-pressed citizens of the 
province. In the private sphere this policy was actualized 
by a series of debt adjustment acts which were designed 
to stay the proceedings taken by creditors against debtors 
and which in the main attempted to apply the principle of 
ability to pay” as the essential element of the debtor- 
creditor relationship. In the public sphere this policy 
took the form of a refusal to meet contractual interest 
obligations in full and a refusal to meet maturity 
obligations at all. This public debt policy was justified 
on the grounds that the government, in view of its primary 
obligations to the citizens of the province, found it 
financially impossible to honour its obligations. 

Undoubtedly a very close relationship between the 
governments debt policy and its social credit policy existed 
throughout the period under review. Members of the comm¬ 
unity, the legislature and the government would be less 
concerned with the probable consequences of repudiation 
if they were convinced that a workable and thorough system

of social credit could be established in the province. 

If, for instance, social credit was so far superior to 
orthodox credit, why should people bother to make sacrifices 
to maintain external and individual credit at all? Obviously, 
under a functioning social credit structure the members of 
the community would not be dependent on orthodox sources 
for credit. On the other hand, however, after it was 
recognized that social credit could not be established , 
the general attitude towards creditor restriction was 
quickened, since this was virtually the only remaining 
area where the community could attack the financial interests. 
But while these particular views were often publicly 
expressed during the early years of the Social Credit 
government, it must not be forgotten that throughout the 
period there was clear and unmistakable evidence of the 
need for debt adjustment and reduction both on economic 
and humanitarian grounds. Undoubtedly the social credit 
attitude towards debt provided a highly emotional setting 
for the governments debt adjustment policy. But this does 
not gainsay the fact that the community wanted and accepted 
such a policy because, under the circumstances, it was 
vitally essential to the well-being of the majority of 
Alberta citizens.

CHAPTER VI 


MISCELLANEOUS SOCIAL CREDIT LEGISLATION 












-165- 


VI 

The most significant elements of Alberta’s legislation 
between 1936 and 1938 consisted in the main of the several 
attempts to establish the n New Economic Order’ 1 and reduce 
the burden of private and public debt. There were other 
enactments, however, subsidiary to the main legislative 
currents, yet significant in indicating other peculiar 
contributions of the Alberta Social Credit government. 

One such act was the Legislative Assembly (Recall) Act. 

As we noted earlier, one of the characteristics of 
Alberta’s political development was an ever-present 
tendency towards popular radicalism. First there were 
the populists from the American Middle West who swarmed 
over the border; later there were the Non-Partisan 
Leaguers. Even before 1921 when the political fortunes 
of the old-line parties were shattered by the strength 
of the U.F.A. movement, there was an intense, almost 
vindictive, democratic spirit which characterized pro¬ 
vincial political activity. In 1913, for example, ”an 
Act to provide for the Initiation or Approval of 
Legislation by the Electors’ 1 was passed. 1 This Act 
provided that any piece of legislation supported by 20 
per cent of the number of votes polled in the last 
election—provided that such a proposed bill was not a

money bill and not, in the opinion of the Attorney-General, 
without the competence of the provincial legislature— 
could be presented by the people to the legislature for 
enactment. The initiating petition, however, had to obtain 
signatures from 85 per cent of the electoral divisions of 
the province and in each such division at least 8 per cent 
of the votes polled in the last election were required 
before the petition was valid.(s. 6) If the proposed Act 
together with the petition was submitted to the legislature, 
two alternatives were available to the government: first, 
the Act could be passed without substantial amendment and, 
second, the Act could be submitted to a vote of the electors. 
(s.7) The second aspect of the Direct Legislation Act 
concerns the provision for a referendum petition. If this 
form of petition was used, the government was forced to 
submit its proposed legislation to a vote of the electors. 

The referendum petition, however, required only 10 per 
cent of the total number of votes cast in the previous 
election. But again, signatures had to be obtained from 
85 per cent of the provincial electoral divisions and in 
each such division at least 8 per cent of the votes polled 
in the previous election were required before the petition 
was valid. 

Now if workable machinery is established to allow the 
electorate to initiate legislation and pass on the pro¬ 
posed acts of the government, a certain amount of popular

control can always be exercised over the legislature. 

But if machinery is established permitting the voters in 
each constituency to recall the members elected in the 
previous election, an even greater check is placed upon 
the lawmakers. The instruments of initiative, referendum 
and recall were used extensively in the United States 
during the 1920*s to "cure the ills of democracy with more 
democracy”. 

The Liberals in 1913 provided the initiative and refer¬ 
endum; the Social Crediters in 1936 provided the recall. 
Sections 4 and 5 of the Legislative Assembly (Recall) Act 2 
outlined the recall machinery to be established. A person 
desiring to initiate the recall of a member had to present 
to the clerk of the executive council a petition signed 
by ten persons who were eligible voters in the previous 
election in the constituency where the recall proceedings 
were to take place. These persons were to be known as 
"promoters” and their original petition had to outline 
the reasons for the proposed recall together with the 
name of a person to act as their "agent”. The promoters 
then paid a sum of $200.00 to the clerk who issued them 
"petition papers”, specially marked by himself, and 
capable of holding 75 per cent of the names on the voters 
list of the constituency for the previous election.

Section 6 provided that sixty-six and two-thirds per cent 
of the names on the voters list for the previous election 
had to be obtained before the petition was effective. 
Moreover, the petition had to be fully completed within 
forty days after the $200.00 was deposited with the clerk 
and certified true copies of the petition posted "at or 
near" every post office in the constituency within ten 
days after the completed petition was lodged with the clerk. 
After receipt of the petition the clerk would notify the 
affected member. Not sooner that forty days after the 
completed petition was turned in, the Chief Justice 
would hold a public inquiry on the conduct of the petition. 
Section 9 (5) stated:"the onus of proving any fact which 
is material to the regularity of the petition shall be upon 
the promoters of the petition 11 . Finally, the Act listed 
certain practices which were a violation of the law. It 
was unlawful, for example, during the time of the petition 
to make "untrue 11 statements concerning the personal 
character of the member affected. However, certain expenses 
were permitted, as was the distribution of certain 
literature. 

During the debate on the Recall Bill opposition members 
took exception to both the principle and the details of 
the legislation. C.G. O’Connor, (Lib.) Edmonton, pointed 
out that this was the first time an act of this nature 
had been presented in the British Empire. He objected to

the principle of recall, stating that the members of the 
legislature were not only representing the constituency 
for which they were elected, but other constituencies as 
well. Any variation from this view, he stated, must 
destroy the principle of parliamentary responsibility. 

G.H. Van Allen, (Lib.) Edmonton, thought that a payment 
of $200.00 was excessive and that the required sixty-six 
and two-thirds per cent would make all recalls impossible. 
Quoting from Professor Overholtz*s book on "Recall”, he 
shoYved that the first measure of this nature in Los Angeles 
called for 25 per cent of those who had voted. Several 
O.S. states had the following percentages: Nevada, 25 per 
cent; South Carolina, 20 per cent; Maine, 25 per cent; 
Dakota, 15 per cent.3 

The governments intention in passing the Recall Act 
is not clear. One of the government supporters, Mrs. Edith 
GosticJ^ (S.C.) Calgary, made the folloYJlng statement in 
reply to the charges of the opposition: 

"The opposition members instead of criticizing this bill 
should thank us for making it impossible to recall any 
of the members." 4 

The bill was not debated until the third reading, when an 
effort was made by the deputy-speaker, Mr. Maynard, to 
rush the measure through. He did not read the clauses 
but declared several of them passed before the opposition

members realized that the bill being railroaded was the 
Recall Act, on which no debate was held on its previous 
appearance before the house• 

In the autumn of 1937, in the premier’s constituency 
of Okotoks-High River, a recall petition was initiated and 
with such success that many considered the required sixty- 
six and two-thirds percentage would be obtained within the 
prescribed forty day limit. At the same time, the third 
session of the 1937 Legislature was in progress. Certain 
government supporters introduced first a resolution and 
then a bill providing for the repeal of the Recall Act, 
retroactive until April 3rd, 1936, the day on which the 
Act was assented to. The sponsors of this legislation 
refused to specify exactly why they favoured repeal. In 
general, they said, the Act had ”failed in its object”. 

’’What was the object?” interjected the Liberal leader. 

”To recall those who have broken their promises”, replied 
Mr. MacLachlan. ’’that’s what the people of Okotoks-High 
River think”, said Mr. Bowlen.* 

The seeming inconsistency peculiar to the Recall Act 
appears in much of the early Social Credit legislation. 

As we noted earlier the real significance of this incon¬ 
sistency lies in the fact that the government forces, out- 

(5) The $200.00 deposited by the Okotoks-High River petit¬ 
ioners was forgotten about after the Act was repealed. 
In 1941, however, a resolution was passed in the House 
allowing the petitioners, represented by the law firm 
of O’Connor and Q ’Connor, to recover the $200.00 when 
all the petition papers were returned to the clerk of 
the executive council.

wardly united were actually divided into two camps—the 
loyalists who were Aberhart men and the ”insurgents” who 
were the T, we-want-results” men led by a group of died-in- 
the-wool Douglasites. Quite probably the insurgent wing 
had advocated a recall measure in caucus at a time when 
they were comparatively weak—for example, early in 1936— 
and the resulting legislation, backed by the majority of 
the caucus because it was considered a recall bill in name 
only, represented a sort of compromise between the two 
factions* Only in this way can a reasonable interpretation 
be put upon the government’s introduction of a measure 
which admittedly was not what it purported to be, and which, 
before it was used even once, was repealed. 


Another significant undertaking during the early years 
of the Alberta Social Credit government was the dated stamp 
scrip or "prosperity certificates” scheme. The idea of 
dated stamp money originated with Silvio Gesell ^ but was 
taken up by other economists 7 and was fairly well known

by 1935.^ The idea of circulating dated scrip, however, 
had nothing to do with Douglas social credit,9 but it may 
have been—particularly when the government was considering 
how the scheme should operate—a part of Aberhart, or 
Maynard,or Fallow social credit. 

The Social Credit party in 1936 was made up of inexper¬ 
ienced but highly conscientious politicians who, for the 
most part, were school teachers, preachers, country store¬ 
keepers and farmers. 10 They had been elected on the pledge 
to take immediate action in implementing social credit in 
Alberta. The great practical feature of their pledge was 
the payment of $25.00 per month to every bona fide citizen 
of the province. From the very beginning,therefore, many 
Social Credit members felt morally bo\md to fulfil their 
election pledge. It was in this setting that the stamp 


(8) The Canadian representative of the Gesell organization, 

Mr. I.S. Woodward, is reported to have communicated 
with Mr. Aberhart in 1934- Later in the same year 

Mr. Aberhart gave an explanation od stamp scrip in 
his Sunday radio broadcast from the Calgary Prophetic 
Bible Institute. Mr. Fallow, the Minister of Public 
Works in the Social Credit cabinet, had had some 
experience with a money experiment because of his 
prominent position in the Vermilion scheme of 1933, 
when $1,300 worth of materials and services had been 
paid for in cheques post dated a year.

(10) There were but two lawyers in the first Social Credit 
cabinet: Hon. Mr. Hugill, Attorney-General, whose legal 
advice went unheeded when the H drastic ff legislation was 
introduced in the third session, 1937, and who sub¬ 
sequently sat on the opposition side of the House as an 
Independent (see supra , p.97), and Hon. Lucien Maynard 
who was brought into the cabinet as Minister without 
portfolio to supervise the prosperity certificates scheme.

scrip scheme was first presented to the caucus, probably 
by Mr. Maynard, during the winter of 1935. 11 The outline 
of the early plan was as follows: the government would 
pay the monthly basic dividends in five provincial bonds 
of five dollars each, bearing no interest and payable one 
year after date. On the back of these bonds there would 
be 52 squares representing the 52 weeks in the year. Each 
week the holder of these bonds would affix a ten cent stamp 
on the appropriate square. In the early stages of the scheme 
it was simply assumed that the bonds would be universally 
acceptable to all people as payment for goods and services. 
Wholesalers and manufacturers in the province requiring 
currency for extra-provincial payments could, it was 
assumed, take their bonds to a state credit house and 
exchange them for drafts. No thought was given to where 
the currency reserve of the state credit house would come 
from. Neither was it known what the quantity of such a 
reserve would have to be if all extra-provincial debts 
were to be honoured. After circulating for a year the 
bonds would be redeemed, the proceeds from stamp sales 
being put into a fund for this purpose. Since the redemption 
value of the bond was #5.00 and the total stamp receipts 
from the bond were #5.20, the government would make a tidy 
gross annual profit of 2 per cent. 

"It will readily be seen that the government is taking 
absolutely no risk itself in issuing basic dividends in

this way. The basic dividend in the nature of stamp 
bonds circulates. The fund for redemption is created 
by itself”• 12 

But this original plan never materialized. During the 
first session pf 1936 there was no mention of stamp money, 
although there was reference to a TT plan ,f which was being 
privately formulated. A Social Credit Measures Act ^ was 
passed giving the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council extensive 
authority and a House committee was struck, with Mr. 

Maynard as chairman, to devise ways and means of establish¬ 
ing social credit. 

On April 10th, 1936, Mr. Fallow announced that scrip 
would be issued in conjunction with a public works project. 
In May Mr. Maynard was made Minister without Portfolio. 

On May ISth he said that plans had been completed and that 
printing presses were at work turning out scrip in one, 
two and five dollar denominations. Very soon the question 
was asked ”what will happen if businessmen refuse to 
accept the scrip?” In reply, Mr. Maynard referred to the 
possibility of bankrupting those who would not accept 
the new money. 

By order in council 815/36, dated June 11th, 1936, 
issued under the authority of the Social Credit Measures 
Act, the government was authorized to issue up to $2,000,000

in "prosperity certificates" in one and five dollar 
denominations to all those who would accept them as payment 
for supplies of goods and services for unemployment relief 
projects, for any government services, or for future 
public expenditures. The order provided that all certificates 
would be redeemed in two years and that they would not be 
valid unless stamps valued at one per cent per week were 
attached to them. During late June and early July the 
road-building was begun and on August 6th, 1936, the 
scrip was mailed to the constituencies for distribution. 

Of the many factors which contributed to the failure of 
the stamp scrip experiment, the chief one was undoubtedly 
the political setting in whinh the programme was launched. 

If the insurgent members wanted to pay the dividends and 
the stamp scrip idea could be used to effect this, then an 
attempt had to be made at all costs. It is true, of course, 
that this consideration did not guarantee that the programme, 
when implemented, would stand a remote possibility of 
success. The government, as a group, remained inconsistent 
in explaining the relationship of the stamp money to 
social credit. Mr. Maynard thought the stamp scrip plan 
was a step towards social credit; other ministers refused 
to comment on the matter. The premier thought the programme 
would "show the value of circulating credit"; that the 
prosperity certificates were "one way of using the province*s 


credit"

The main justification for the stamp scrip experiment 
was given by the government as an attempt to increase 
purchasing power and employment* The question of how 
increased purchasing power would result if a 100 per cent 
redemption fund was kept seems never to have been answered. 
In the matter of how long the plan would operate, the 
government remained as inconsistent as ever. Shortly 
after the first issue of scrip, Mr. Aberhart stated that 
no more scrip would be issued until the government was able 
to observe the effects of the first issue. Mr. Maynard 
said that the government would continue to issue the 
certificates until they stopped circulating. Mr. Fallow 
stated that n the plan will soon be merged into social 
credit”. The legality of the experiment was always open to 
question; the actual amount to be circulated was never 
known until on April 30th, 1936, Mr. Fallow announced 
that no more scrip-financed work would be undertaken 
during the year. Previously, on September 2nd and 12th, 
he had said that reissues would be made and that the 
amounts possibly would be augmented. Then, from November, 
1936, to March, 1937, large issues were made to provincial 
civil servants. There was much uncertainty as to whether 
the government would accept the scrip in payment of taxes. 
The premier stated once that they would be accepted for 
all taxes but not for stamp payments or liquor purchases. 
But on July 27th, an amending order (O.C. 1085/36) provided 
that scrip would be accepted only for the sales tax.

The stamp money was issued to labourers who presented 
it to retailers in exchange for goods. This, for all 
practical purposes, represented the extent of "circulation" 
of the scrip. The original order provided for conversion 
or redemption only at the end of two years. No credit 
house was established to enable wholesalers and manufacturers 
to dispose of their extra-provincial liabilities. Hence, 
they refused to accept the dated scrip from the retailers. 

In order to relieve the pressure on retailers, the govern¬ 
ment, by O.C. 1085/36, announced that "anyone" could redeem 
prosperity certificates at par value on Thursday, Friday 
and Saturday following the second Wednesday of each month, 
commencing in September, 1936. Later this was verbally 
qualified by the treasurer, Mr. Cockroft, to mean that 
"any bona-fide business man" could redeem on the specified 
dates, since the government wished to redeem only through 
the wholesaler and manufacturer levels. However, anyone 
who rushed to exchange certificates for currency was not 
turned away. 1 ^ There is no evidence that the government 
foresaw that redemption at par was automatically placing 
a premium on redemption. An individual who held a certificate 
had to place stamps on it. Immediate redemption, therefore, 
was the best policy. This consideration must have been 
important to the government since it had announced that 
its redemption policy would depend on the quantity of 
certificates presented for redemption.

revenue over expenses was $12,679.68. In addition the 
government received cash or services for $19,633 certificates 
which were not redeemed. The total profit, therefore, amounted 
to approximately $32,300. 


Premier Aberhart, a high school teacher by profession, 
was naturally interested in education. Until his death in 
1943* he held the portfolio of education. When he first 
assumed office in 1935, he fran&ly declared that he intended 
reorganizing the administration of the school system in 
Alberta. First, he warned the Association of Municipal 
Districts to find ways of cutting costs. At the same time 
he is reported to have stated that ”Alberta has absolutely 
no need for 10,000 school trustees, 3,000 school 
secretaries and 3,000 audits”. 1 ^ This statement reflects 
accurately the almost universal attitude among Alberta 
teachers during the 1930 f s that the n small unit” school 
district was the wrong type of administrative base on 
which to build a sound provincial school system. School 
finances were severely mutilated during the deperssion, 
while the provincial treasury, also empty, had very little 
financial aid to offer.

There were many reasons why Aberhart and the Social 
Credit government could grapple with the always controver¬ 
sial problems of municipal reorganization* In the first 
place the new government had received a substantial popular 
majority over its political opponents in the 1935 election. 
Secondly, about one-fifth of the members of the legislature 
were teachers who had little to lose from a school reorgan¬ 
ization programme. Finally, the premier, an ex-high school 
principal, could be trusted with carrying out the reorgan¬ 
ization with "energy and conviction" 

Statutory effect was given to the proposed reorganization 
when on March 18th, 1936, the School Act Amendment Act 
(Chapter 85, first session, 1936) was introduced in the 
House. This twenty page document contained many sections, 
of which 13 were devoted to minor amendments. Section 15 
of the Act provided for the establishment of school 
"divisions", consisting of a number of school districts 
and there was set out in detail the method of establishment 
and the powers, duties and functions of the board and the 
board of an included district respectively, the constitution 
of the board of a division and the provisions governing 
the operation and administration of a school division. 

The right of any minority of electors in any district to 
establish a separate school, as provided in the original 
Act, was fully protected in the amending legislation. 

Under those sections governing consolidation of rural 
school districts, the Minister of Bducation was authorized

to constitute, by order, a school division consisting of 
any number of school districts(rural)—not being districts 
wholly or partially included in a consolidated district— 
where conditions prevailing were such that it appeared 
desirable !, in the interests of education 11 to do so, or 
if it was so requested by the boards of trustees in the 
majority of districts of a proposed division. The Minister 
was authorized to divide each new division into not less 
thah five subdivisions. Provision was made for the nom¬ 
ination and election of officials for the various 
districts and divisions and for the formation of divisional 
boards. 

The board of trustees of each school district included 
in a division would cease to have any of the powers, duties 
and functions conferred upon such a board under sections 
119 and 120 of the School Act, 1931® But, on the other 
hand,it was the duty of every divisional board to exercise 
a general supervision and control over the schools of the 
division. Members of divisional boards were to be paid 
$5,00 for every meeting attended with a maximum of $50.00 
being allowed any one individual per year. Separate 
school districts irere given the opportunity of asking for 
inclusion in or exclusion from divisions upon making a 
resolution to the Minister, provided the demand was sub¬ 
sequently ratified by a vote of the electors of the district.

In introducing the amendment, the premier gave 
assurances that the new school provisions would be applied 
on a limited scale and in an experimental way. The opposition, 
however, regarded the bill as placing too much authority 
in the hands of the Minister. For example, G.H. Van Allen, 
(Lib.) Edmonton, took objection to that section which 
read Tt upon the constitution of the division, the Minister 
shall appoint a Superintendent for the division”. "I contend”, 
he said, ”that this principle is wrong and I move that 
the word »Minister ? be changed to ? board*”. Mr. 0 f Connor, 
on the other hand, felt that the superintendent should 
not be appointed by the Minister, but by the divisional 
or district boards. The premier replied that in introducing 
the new school system the superintendents would have to be 
paid by the Department, at least until the system became 
operative. This being so, he continued, it was best to 
have the superintendents under departmental control in 
the same way that control was exercised over school 
inspectors. 1 ^ 

By the end of 1936 eleven large administrative units 
had been organized. These included some 800 rural districts. 

In 1938 twenty-two school divisions had been established 
and were in operation, incorporating approximately 1,495 
districts. The Speech from the Throne in 1939 stated: 

”In the field of education, it is worthy to note the 
advances made in the reorganization of the admin-

istration for rural education. The Larger School Units 
covering 90 % of the Province now number forty-four. 

Where they have been in operation for some time they 
are proving very satisfactory.”18 

By 1941* fifty divisions had been established under the 
school reorganization plan. In general the new divisions 
contained between thirty and sixty districts with their 
boundaries left intact. Legislative and executive powers 
were transferred from district to divisional boards; 
district boards retained only advisory powers. The school 
division became the new administartive unit and the 
districts continued to function as attendance units with¬ 
in the division.^ 

The school administrative reorganization begun in 
1936 was completed in six years. However, even in 1941 
over 500 school districts were not incorporated in the 
larger divisional units. The number of these districts 
outside the divisional organization remained substantial 
until 1948, when only 196 districts remained outside the 
larger units. The following table indicates the progress 
of school reorganization in Alberta:

In 1940 it was announced that municipal reorganization 
would be undertaken by the government. In 1942 the Speech 


from the Throne declared2 


"Considerable progress is being made in the reorgan¬ 
ization of Municipal administration in the Province. 
After very careful study and lengthy preparation, a 
number of large municipal units are being set up this 
year, thus implementing the programme of reorganization 
...outlined in the Session of 1940." 21 

In 1942 a total of five enlarged municipal units were 

created; the organization of two more was considered

during the same period. From the outset the programme had 
to proceed with great caution. 22 During the session of 1942, 
Mr. Maynard, the Minister of Municipal Affairs, assured 
members that tT there will be no more units organized 
between now and midnight of December 31st, 1942. We shall, 
however, continue to stud# the plan with a view to organ¬ 
izing more units next year if the plan works well in its 
present trial." 2 ^ During the same debate, the Minister, 
replying to a question by E.H. Brown,(ind.) Didsbury, 
said that "15 or 20 municipalities had requested to be 
put into large units". 

In 1943 it was stated that "the operation of the five 
trial municipal units established in 1942, have proved so 
successful that (the government) proposes to continue the 
programme during the coming year". 2 ^ By this time, how¬ 
ever, opposition to the government’s reorganization policy 
was developing. C.A. Reynolds,(S.C.) Stettler, "crossed 
the floor" of the Rouse and became an independent social 
credit member because, as he said. 


(22) In 1942, the Municipal Districts Act , empowered the 
Minister to "direct, by order, that any or any part 
or parts of any municipal districts or improvement 
districts shall be merged into one municipal district, 
and (the Minister shall) assign thereto a name and 
number, and thereupon the then existing councils of 
each municipal district.••shall be dissolved...and the 
affairs of each municipal district...included...shall 
be administered by one council consisting of sjich 
number of persons elected or appointed in such a 
manner as the Minister may prescribe, and the Council 
so elected or appointed shall be the council for the 
new district".

T, No other policy of this government has created more 
ill-felling and justifiable indignation, among the 
rural areas of the province, than that of reorganizing 
of large municipal units, in total disregard of 
opinions and expressed wishes of those most directly 
concerned." 25 

During the session of 1943 repeated attempts were made 
to have the government halt its plan for four years in 
order to observe the operations of the five trial units. 
These requests were rejected by the Minister who informed 
one member "that he would not recognize any request for 
a delay or a plebiscite". In a four period, said Mr. 
Maynard, the entire province would be reorganized. More¬ 
over, he stated that "the critics of the large municipal 
unit scheme are politicians seeking their own political 

advantage".^ 

On November 2nd, 1943 , order-in-council 1697/43 was 
issued by the executive council on the advice of the 
Minister of Municipal Affairs, providing for a tax 
consolidation scheme to be applicable in all municipal 
districts created or subsequently created under the 
authority of the Municipal Districts Act . 1942* The 
council of each such municipality was directed by this 
order to consolidate and amalgamate its separate tax 
levies into a single tax levy. Councils were directed

to prepare estimates of probable expenditure for the forth¬ 
coming year and on the basis of these estimates a single 
uniform tax would be levied on the assessed value of lands 
in each district* The sums required annually by the 
several school districts or divisions and the hospital 
districts were to be included in the estimates. Thus the 
necessity of separate school and hospital taxes was to 
be avoided in future. The provincial social services tax 
was to be collected by each municipal district and to 
be paid the provincial treasury in nine equal monthly 
installments beginning on April 1st of each year. This 
order-in-council was ratified and validated by Chapter 41> 
1944, the Municipal Districts Act Amendment Act . 

In 1944 Hon. C.E. Gerhart, the new Minister of Municipal 
Affairs, stated that local opposition to the governments 
proposed programme was dying and that it was now recognized 
the government intended pushing through a thorough reorgan¬ 
ization programmeEnlargement, he contended, was not 
intended to result in centralization; on the contrary, as 
the larger units were organized, the Department intended 
handing over many of its functions to the new units. 

At the end of 1944 there were forty enlarged municipal 
districts with twenty which, at that time, had not been 
enlarged. There were 68 municipal districts dissolved 

(27) Although Mr. Gerhart made this statement in the House, 
there is good reason to believe that the reorganization 
programme was still objectionable to most local officials

which, together with 13 improvement districts, were formed 
into 19 enlarged municipal districts. During 1944 it was 
also announced that the government intended to reorganize 
all the improvement districts—some 400 of which would 
be reduced to 61. Since these latter districts were 
administered directly by the department, it was felt that 
a great administrative saving would result. During 1948 
the total of enlarged districts was increased to 42 , 
leaving 17 which had not been enlarged.^ 


For various reasons the school district and municipal 
and improvement district reorganizations were not governed 
by an overall plan which would have made school and 
municipal boundaries coterminous. The two reorganizations 
were effected at different times by different departments 
and,indeed, the boundary determination peculiar to each 
separate reorganization appears to have been guided by 
no inflexible rule. In the case of school reorganization 
the new divisions were formed by the incorporation of 
many school districts. The number of such districts in 
each division depended, among other things, on the 
ease with which the divisional superintendent could cover 
his territory, and the availability of transportation 
facilities. In the case of municipal district reorganization, 

(29) These are the most recent official figures on reorgan¬ 
ization. See the Annual Report of the Department of 
Municipal Affairs,(194 ^)y P- 3*

boundaries were determined by township lines, natural 
features, transportation facilities and political and 
ethnic factors.-^ Consequently the reorganization pro¬ 
grammes, while they were separately beneficial in both 
the educational and municipal spheres, failed to effect 
the broader administrative integration which would result 
if the boundaries of school, hospital and municipal 
districts or divisions were coterminous. While this 
deficiency in the programme stands out, it ought not 
to obscure the administrative advantages accruing from 
separate functional reorganization: the administrative 
economies possible with the enlarged units, the uniformity 
of service standards and the equalization of the local tax 
burden. 

But, at the same time, other factors must be considered. 
Citizen participation in local government must be fostered 
if a healthy democratic spirit is to obtain at the 
municipal level. Clearly, local government is the show¬ 
piece of functioning democracy; it is the governmental 
mechanism with which the people are most familiar. If a 
reorganization programme in the name of administrative 
efficiency, creates local units of such a size or of 
such a nature that the citizen loses interest in local 
affairs, then such a programme can hardly be supported. 

If, as Mr. Gerhart suggested in 194®* the present plan 
envisages a gradual decentralization of authority and

responsibility to the enlarged units, the long-run effects 
of reorganization may be more positive than is presently 
anticipated, since it does not appear that the Alberta 
municipal reorganization programme has unduly stifled 
interest and participation in local affairs. 


In 1944* the Land Sales Prohibition Act (Chapter 15) 
described as an "Act to prohibit the sale of lands to any 
Hutterites for the duration of the war", was enacted 
denying to Hutterites the right to expand their holdings. 
The legislation was continued through 1945 and 1946 and 
was due to expire on May 1st, 1947. An order-in-council 
in 1946 constituted a committee of the legislature to 
hear representations from the Hutterites and from organ¬ 
izations who were opposed to the growth of the colonies. 

The committee, consisting of Ivan Casey,(S.C.) Okotoks- 
High River, DvBl MacDonald,(ind.) Calgary, F.C. Colborne, 
(Air Force) and H.G. Hammell,(S.C.) Didsbury, found 
public opinion in the south of the province strongly 
opposed to any further expansion of Hutterite colonies. 

The committee reported that it heard many suggestions 
in favour of a continuation of the Land Sales Prohibition 
Act. Further, it was suggested that each such colony be 
required to furnish the government a complete list of the 
property held by the community at the date the original

Act came into force in 1944* The committee recommended 
that new organizations of colonies should not be allowed 
to establish themselves any closer that fifty miles to 
existing groups and that no group be permitted to expand 
beyond ten sections. Finally, it was suggested that no 
provincial lands be leased to these groups, 

Mr, Colborne, who opposed the committee’s report and 
suggested several amendments, thought the recommendations 
were "innocent on the surface, but constitute more or less 
an ultimatum to the Hutterite to get out of the province",31 
Colborne’s resolution requesting the report be referred 
back to the committee was defeated. Other members, however, 
said the report did not go far enough, H.E. Debolt,(S.C.) 
Spirit River, advocated that' the Hutterites be separated 
so that there would only be one or two families in a 
township—*"preferably one", he declared. Gordon Taylor, 
(S.C.) Drumheller, suggested there was ample room for the 
Hutterites in Greenland, since they showed little dispos¬ 
ition to become Canadians. Premier Manning closed the 
discussion on the committee’s report and pointed out that 
the House would have the opportunity to make amendments 
to the terms of regulations when the ensuing legislation 
was considered. "If this government errs at all", he said, 
"let us err on the side of freedom for the individual". 

The legislation was called the Communal Property Act 32

and it adopted almost completely the recommendations of 
the committee. It did, however, reduce the distance which 
the committee concluded should govern the establishment 
of new communities in relation to existing groups, from 
fifty to forty miles. When the Act was first presented no 
mention was made of any minority group. Later it was 
found necessary to use the names !, Hutterites tT and "Douk- 
hobors" so that "groups such as hospitals, convents and 
other types of hostels operated by religious organizations" 
would not be affected. Two amendments to the legislation 
were proposed but both were defeated. The first amendment, 
proposed by Gordon Taylor, would have extended the distance 
between colonies from 40 to 750 miles. Mr. Taylor observed 
that such a provision would "make any number in the 
increase of settlements take place outside the province".33 
The second amendment, which would have reduced the forty 
mile limit by ten miles was also defeated. 

YYhen the Act was passed there was some speculation as to 
whether the Dominion would invoke its disallowance. The 
Attorney-General gave his opinion that the Dominion could 
disallow the legislation within one year after its enact¬ 
ment by the Alberta legislature. This, however, was not 
done and the Act remains on the statutes of the province.

The first two Acts discussed in this chapter may be 
considered an integral part of the Alberta Social Credit 
experiment. The principle of recall of members of the 
legislature has a very close affinity with the Douglasite 
conception of "proper representation"—with the idea that 
the peoples 1 representatives should embody a "mass desire" 
and that the mechanism of government should be made more 
responsive to the "general will" of the community. While 
Douglas* political proposals envisaged a great deal more 
than the establishment of the recall principle, it is clear 
that many Alberta Social Crediters would have accepted 
such a principle with no misgivings. To those members of 
the Alberta party who favoured Douglas* political methods, 
recall was "a step in the right direction"—albeit a 
diminutive step;to some of those who refused to accept 
Douglas* political methods, recall was entirely acceptable 
as a thoroughly democratic instrument. Moreover, the 
Recall Act of 1936 was acceptable even to those members of 
the Alberta Social Credit party who opposed the principle 
of recall since, in their view, the legislation was 
impossible of practical application. 

The enactment of the Recall Act provides an excellent 
example of the achievement of what is sometimes called 
"the best of all possible worlds". Clearly, no compromise 
was involved in the process, since no principle was con¬ 
ceded by any of the opposing groups within the party. At 

the same time, the opposition members, all of whom opposed

the principle of recall, were placed in the awkward 
position of criticizing the Act because it was unworkable. 
That the belief of many Social Crediters in the unwork¬ 
ability of the Act was the basis for its enactment is 
substantiated by the speed with which it was repealed 
when its workability was about to be demonstrated. 

The prosperity eertificates experiment, as we observed 
earlier, began as a possible way of distributing dividends 
but ended as a method of financing public road building 
projects together with partial payment for civil servants. 
The stamp scrip experiment failed because the general 
public failed to acquire sufficient confidence in the 
new currency. The scheme was always of doubtful legality; 
the government was unable to maintain consistent policy 
with regard to the important questions of the amounts of 
scrip to be issued, the government’s acceptance of scrip 
in payment of debts due the crown, and redemption. 

Aside from the fact that many Albertans considered 
the Social Credit party committed to a ’’fanciful system 
of economics” and hence, were disposed to view all Social 
Credit legislation with extreme skepticism, it is difficult 
to see how public confidence could have been obtained by 
the top administrative direction and control essential to 
the success of a programme of this nature. The early 
Social Credit cabinet was never really united for a lengthy 
period of time. Neither was it ever able to provide effective 
party leadership and impose strict party discipline.

The last two sections of this chapter deal with 
legislation which cannot properly he considered an 
essential portion of the Alberta social credit experiment. 
These two sections have been included merely because they 
represent peculiar contributions of the Alberta Social 
Credit Government. The Alberta school and municipal 
reorganization was as much an administartive success as 
the stamp scrip experiment was an administrative failure. 
Other provinces and states have grappled with the problems 
of school and municipal reorganization—for example, the 
province of Saskatchewan—but none have achieved such 
conspicuous success in this direction as has Alberta. 
Moreover, while other provinces have enacted discrimin¬ 
atory racial or political legislation, few have singled 
out any group in the community for harsher treatment 
than that accorded the Hutterites by the government of 
Alberta.

VII 


SOCIAL CREDIT DOCTRINE 

The social credit economic analysis concludes that the 
capitalist system suffers at all times from chronic under¬ 
consumption due to a constant deficiency of purchasing power. 
Social credit theorists take this as a normal condition in 
unreformed capitalist society. It results, they say, either 
through the banking system which has monopolistic control 
over the issuance of credit, or from an accounting error in 
the production system. In any case, they argue, the total 
flow of physical production is always in excess of the total 
flow of payments to consumers. Without dwelling on the 
economic implications of this proposition, we may proceed 
to note that the social credit remedy is purely monetary 
in nature. Douglas was always a high private enterpriser: 
he scoffed at Keynes for advocating full employment as a 
valid economic objective; he was opposed to the collect¬ 
ivist proposal that the state assume ownership of the 
facilities of production and distribution and, finally, 
he argued strongly for the maintenance of private property 
and profits. On the other hand, however, Douglas believed 
that we had reached a stage of potential infinite want- 
satisfying capacity because of our technological ability. 

In short, Douglas felt that scarcity need not exist but 
that it did exist because the industrial system was re¬ 
stricted in its operation by an inherently predatory 
financial structure. This is the rationale of the social

credit slogan "Poverty in the Midst of Plenty". 

Douglas f reform proposals were designed to make con¬ 
sumption coincide with production. This was to be effected 
in one of three ways: the monetary authority could 
compensate consumers directly with national dividends; it 
could compensate consumers indirectly by the establishment 
of a just price mechanism or, it could devise a system 
using the two previous methods in complementary fashion. 

The ethical-political aspect of social credit doctrine 
considers human nature as essentially good and the 
individual as the most important fact in society—an end 
in himself and not a means to an end. Social credit is 
compatible both with Christianity and democracy. Personal 
freedom is absolutely essential and political freedom 
together with economic security should be accorded all 
men. But ^according to social credit theorists, none of 
these conditions obtain in modern industrial democracies. 
Constitutional democracy exists but functioning democracy 
is absent. Parliament, which should be controlled by the 
electorate, is in practice, subjugated to the party 
machinery. 

The social credit remedy to these conditions advocates 
that in place of the present system of limited state 
dictatorship, there be established a system which restores 
sovereignty to the people. This was to be achieved by a 
"union of electors" together with a new system of rep-

resentation. Under this proposal parliament would become 
the embodiment of a "mass desire". The administration was 
to be completely responsible for all matters of "detail". 

The masses and their representatives were to have nothing 
to say on these matters of method—for example, foreign, 
fiscal and educational policies—and they were to concern 
themselves only with broad "objectives" such as economic 
security with or without regimentation and so on. 

Finally, the social credit theory of history asserts 
that all events must be interpreted in terms of the 
activities of the "world plotters", a group of inter¬ 
national financiers who were actively engaged in an attempt 
to achieve complete world domination. 

It is not suggested that these views were held by the 
large numbers of Albertans who supported the Social Credit 
party in 1935 and in subsequent elections. Premier Aberhart, 
whose interpretation of social credit was accepted by many 
electors, regarded Douglas* theory essentially as a monetary 
reform which was morally justified because of the "Cultural 
Heritage" and had its religious foundation in his own 
interpretation of Christianity. Hence the Aberhart 
conception of the national dividend is based primarily on 
the moral obligation of the state to provide sufficient 
purchasing power to enable all citizens to acquire the 
basic necessities of food, clothing and shelter. Similarly, 
the just price mechanism was considered by Aberhart as a 
retail discount rate to free consumers from "wildcat ex-

ploitation n and an excessive "price spread". These are hut 
two examples of the differences between Douglas social 
credit and Aberhart social credit. 

THE POPULARITY OF SOCIAL CREDIT IN ALBERTA 

In view of the nature of social credit doctrine, it may 
be asked why social credit attained such popularity in 
Alberta. One of the answers to this question has been 
hinted at above. Whereas the basis for Douglas 1 conception 
of social credit was highly technical and complex, the basis 
for Aberhart 1 s social credit was relatively simple. Douglas 1 
preoccupation with the long-run displacement of manpower 
by machine power could have had little appeal in a province 
with a preponderantly agricultural economy. Moreover, the 
general nature of Douglas’ presentation of his doctrine 
was such as to preclude a widespread understanding of its 
aims and objectives. 

But not only did Aberhart simplify social credit—he 
applied it rigorously and effectively to the economic and 
social conditions in Alberta. In his hands social credit 
became a "cure-all" device which could be used to restore 
prosperity and happiness to a distracted community which 
had suffered extreme social deterioration because of severe 
and protracted economic dislocation. 

It is clear, however, that the phenomenal success of 
social credit in Alberta must be interpreted with reference 
to other factors more important than those already mentioned.

It is, for instance, extremely doubtful whether a Social 
Credit victory in 1935 would have been possible without 
the leadership provided by Mr. Aberhart. It was one thing 
to simplify and interpret a complex and incoherent economic 
doctrine and quite another to fill large numbers of people 
with the fanatical belief that such a doctrine offered 
certain economic salvation. Aberhart fused social credit 
with Christian fundamentalism so successfully that many 
of his followers were unable to distinguish between the 
two. That Aberhart possessed all the requirements of a 
successful popular leader, no one will deny; he had ambition, 
a resolute will, hypnotic power as a public orator, a 
certain psychological astuteness and a passion for thorough 
organization and administration. With all these qualities 
as a leader, however, his success might have been less 
spectatcular had not the social climate of Alberta in 1935 
been ripe for the very type of fanatical crusade which he 
was prepared (and so admirably qualified) to lead. 

The factors contributing to the unqualified response of 
so many Albertans to the charismatic leadership of the 
f! Prophetic Premier” have been discussed in previous pages. 

In passing we need only observe that in 1935 the depression 
had begun its sixth consecutive year; that the rural 
communities of the province suffered repeated economic 
setbacks through low commodity prices and poor crop yields 
due to frost, hail, drought and grasshoppers and that the 
urban communities were faced with large and increasing

numbers of unemployed workmen. Moreover, in the eyes of 
many people the U.F.A. government was not properly meeting 
its increased responsibilities in a manner acceptable to 
the community. 

As the level of personal income declined, the relative 
burden of private and public indebtedness increased. Faced 
with drastic income reductions the farmers generally were 
unable to meet their contractual interest obligations and 
many defaulted. By doing this, however, they ran the risk 
of dispossession of those goods essential to the production 
of income or, at the very least, the inability to obtain 
further credit to enable them to continue farm operations. 

In any case, they pressed the government for increased 
expenditures on agricultural relief, which expenditures 
were normally financed by increasing provincial debt thus 
increasing the annual debt charges which, by 1935, were 
perilously near fifty per cent of total provincial revenue. 

From one point of view, therefore, the rise of Social 
Credit in Alberta may be interpreted as a popular revolt 
against debt. The economic position of the Alberta farmer 
rendered him extremely susceptible to propaganda directed 
towards blaming all his hardships on the external ”eastern 
financial interests”. By the repeated use of this device 
the D.F.A. movement had moulded a stereotype which was to 
be used by the Social Credit movement in 1935 as a stepping 
stone to political power.

But there were other important reasons why Alberta 
accepted Aberhart social credit in 1935. To begin with, 
from 1921 onwards Alberta, politically speaking, had 
turned "maverick". For fourteen years prior to 1935 the 
provincial electorate had given consistent overwhelming 
support to a purely provincial party. This conditioning 
period must have rendered the 1935 shift of allegiance 
from one provincial party to another a rather painless 
process for the majority of the electors. Further, it was 
through the U.F.A. movement that Douglas social credit was 
first introduced to Alberta. Long before Mr. Aberhart 
read Maurice Colbourn^s Economic Nationalism ,"and liked it", 
in 1932, the members of various U.F.A. locals had discussed 
Douglas 1 monetary proposals. Naturally, it was through the 
U.F.A. movement that Aberhart built up his own organ¬ 
ization. Broadly speaking, the vast majority of Social 
Credit supporters were drawn from the ranks of the dis¬ 
integrating U.F.A. movement. 

In conclusion. Social Credit cannot be interpreted as 
an isolated phenomenon in the historical development of 
the province of Alberta. On more than one occasion prior 
to 1935 political commentators have alleged that "Albert a 
is always five years closer to a revolution than any other 
Canadian province". Social Credit did not "just happen" in 
Alberta and neither was it the result completely of the 
Great Depression. It is clear that economic and physical 
conditions between 1930 and 1935 contrived to set the stage

psychologically for a violent political upheaval. But 
whether or not the Social Credit party would "reap the 
whirlwind” depended on such essential contributory factocs 
as the leadership ability of William Aberhart, the nature 
of his interpretation of social credit, the reaction of the 
existing political organizations to the social crisis and 
the previous conditioning of provincial attitudes concern¬ 
ing the acceptability of political unorthodoxy during 
periods of social unrest. 

SOCIAL CREDIT POLICY IN ALBERTA 

The first year of Social Credit policy in Alberta 
proceeded along cautious and orthodox lines. Finding its 
financial position very precarious the government under¬ 
took an administrative reorganization programme and 
attempted to supplement its depleted revenues by increased 
taxation. This latter policy provided the basis for the 
first disagreement between the premier and Major Douglas. 
Douglas was opposed to increased taxation on principle; 
his reason being that suitable social credit measures would 
have obviated the necessity of such taxation. The premier, 
on the other hand, was practical enough to see the immediate 
necessity of an adequate cash reserve which would enable 
the government to pay civil service salaries anil finance 
the dajfc-to-day activities of government. Further, during 
1936, the premier introduced his School Act Amendment Act 
which was the first step in a school administrative reorgan-

ization programme not to be completed until the early 1940*s. 
Since the premier was not committed to the introduction of 
a provincial social credit system until eighteen months had 
elapsed, there was little controversial legislation during 
1936* The Social Credit Measures Act—a declaratory Act— 
merely outlined the general aims and objectives of social 
credit and authorized the cabinet to take suitable measures 
with regard to the future implementation of a social credit 
system. 

But some indication of the explosive possibilities of 
future Social Credit policy was evident in certain measures 
enacted in 1936. In April the province defaulted on a 
maturity obligation valued at $3,200,000. Later, legislation 
was introduced providing that the province would pay only 
fifty per cent of its annual debt charges. This policy was 
continued by the Alberta government until 1941 when formal 
negotiations were opened with the bondholders with the view 
towards ultimate adjustment. Ultimately, however, agreement 
as to the most acceptable adjustment was impossible and 
the government continued paying fifty per cent of its con¬ 
tractual obligations until 1943 when the debt reorganization 
programme was finally implemented. Three other measures, 
the Prosperity Certificates Act, the Recall Act and the 
Debt Adjustment Act Amendment Act, provided some indication 
of the future trends in Social Credit Policy.

Having regard to the incoherence of social credit 
doctrine and the fact that Premier Aberharts conception of 
social credit varied considerably from that of Major 
Douglas ! , it is not surprising that the general course of 
Social Credit policy in Alberta followed confused and 
inconsistent lines. There were, however, other forces which 
guaranteed and strengthened this tendency towards confusion 
and inconsistency. 

Aberhart ! s striking success as a popular leader stands 
in sharp contrast to his failure as a parliamentary and 
party leader. His ambitions and iron will, his utter lack 
of social sophistication together with his awareness of 
his immense popular following, made it virtually impossible 
for him to lead without at the same time antagonizing. He 
appears at times to have successfully controlled the cabinet 
he ruthlessly disposed of certain early cabinet ministers 
who would not blindly follow his dictation. But at other 
times the actions and policy statements of ministers 
indicate the absence of steady cabinet leadership. 

Aberhart appears to have been unable to impose his will 
on the majority of Social Credit private members in the 
legislature. Indeed this group of school teachers, preachers 
country storekeepers and farmers were never disposed to 
be "led by the nose". They had promised their constituents 
the $25.00 a month and when the premier proved reluctant 

to establish social credit they rebelled with great moral 
indignation.

The rift in personal relations between Premier Aberhart 
and Major Douglas which began in 1936 over the governments 
taxation policy and its employment of "orthodox” financial 
advisers, grew steadily wider until in 1937 the premier 
was reported to have refused to bring Douglas to Alberta 
because "he would not play second fiddle to any man"* This 
attitude of the premier’s was not acceptable to the 
insurgents in the legislature who by 1937 had become con¬ 
vinced that he did not intend to implement his election 
promises. Accordingly, during the first session of 1937, 
they staged a parliamentary revolt and were successful in 
preventing the passage of the budget until the premier 
compromised and allowed the insurgents to seek the assistance 
of Major Douglas. 

Douglas refused to come to Alberta but sent two 
"technical envoys", Mssrs. G.F. Powell and L.D. Byrne to 
give technical assistance to the Alberta government. 

A Social Credit Board was established, a Social Credit Act 
was passed and the control of government policy shifted 
from the cabinet to the party caucus and the Board. There¬ 
after a series of "drastic" acts were introduced which 
attempted to give effect to Douglas’ ideas concerning 
press regulation and the taxation and licensing of credit 
institutions. 

But all these legislative attempts to establish a pro¬ 
vincial social credit system failed because the courts 
and the Dominion government refused to recognize the right

of the province to establish such a system of provincial 
exchange. The Social Credit Act was declared ultra vires . 
the bank licensing Acts were disallowed by the Governor- 
in-Council and the Lieutenant-Governor reserved the last 
three social credit bills of 1937. 

Faced with these rebuffs from an external authority, 

the warring factions were driven together in protest against 
/the 

Dominions actions. Gradually the Alberta government came 
to realize that a full-scale social credit programme 
could not be implemented by the province. In 1938 the 
11 interim plan” was announced and Treasury Branches were 
established. It was felt that such a programme would strengthen 
the provincial economy and give partial effect to the aims 
and objectives of social credit. 

Wj>th the outbreak of war the Alberta government promised 
not to introduce any controversial legislation. This policy 
was followed throughout the war years but, in 1945, the 
Social Credit League resumed its demand for the $25.00 
dividend and a social credit system. Accordingly, in 1946, 
the government introduced its Alberta Bill of Rights. In 
general, this legislation was similar to that enacted in 
1937 with the exception that it was not to be operative 
until its validity had been judged by the courts. In 1947 
the Alberta Bill of Rights was declared ultra vires . This 
represents the final attempt of the Alberta government to 
implement a provincial social credit system. 






- 208 - 


The brief flirtation of the Alberta Social Credit party 
with Douglas f political ideas ended when the Douglasite 
legislation was disallowed and rejected by the courts in 
1937. Thereafter all government policies were conducted by 
normal democratic methods. Mr. Aberhart died in 1943 and 
was succeeded by Hon. Ernest C. Manning. In his election 
campaign of 1944 the new premier reinterpreted social 
credit doctrines and stressed the antipathy of social 
credit towards socialism and communism. This new approach 
brought out the conservative elements of the Douglasite 
theory. Moreover, by 1944 most of the genuinely radical 
members of the Social Credit party had drifted away to 
the C.C-.F. Until 1947, however, the Douglasite wing of 
the Alberta Social Credit party remained active. Certain 
men in responsible positions in the party continued to 
spread the most recent developments in Douglasite thinking. 
These elements were purged in 1947. In the same year the 
Social Credit Board was abolished and the caucus dissociated 
itself from all policies of anti-semitism and anti-democratic 
action. 


ALBERTA SOCIAL CREDIT LEGISLATION 
IN RELATION TO SOCIAL CREDIT DOCTRINE 

The Social Credit Act, 1937, contained elements of both 
Douglas social credit and Aberhart social credit. In keeping 
with Douglas 1 proposal that the state assume control of

the issuance of credit, the Act prescribed that a State 
Credit House be established to administer the Alberta 
credit system* This credit house idea developed, under 
the interim plan, into the Treasury Branches System. 

The Social Credit Act also provided for consumers’ 
dividends, but there does not appear to have been any 
attempt to make the amount of such dividends dependent on 
the ratio between total consumption and total production. 
Further, there is no evidence that the proposed dividends 
were to be issued monthly in a fixed amount —>for example, 
$25.00 per month. The Act merely provided that the amount 
of the dividend was to be determined by making it 
approximate that percentage of the provincial credit 
account which was available and not other wise appropriated 
—as deemed advisable by the commission. 

The just price mechanism incorporated in the Alberta 
Social Credit Act is very similar to Aberhart’s idea of 
a price discount to consumers at the retail level. Douglas* 
just price proposal envisaged compensation in non-legal 
tender to producers for marketing their commodities at 
prices below cost. In any case, however, the basis for 
the just price was the ratio of total consumption to 
total production. In the Social Credit Act the so-called 
n unused capacity ,! factor, to be obtained by the commission 
from the difference betm r een total productive capacity and 
total provincial consumption, was to determine the retail

discount rate applicable in all final retail commodity 
transactions. No mention is made in the Act of Aberhart*s 
!, unearned increment levy", nor is there any mechanism to 
reduce "wildcat exploitation 11 and "exorbitant profits" and 
at the same time assure a "fair profit on turnover". 

The second comprehensive Alberta social credit Act, 
the 1946 Bill of Rights differed considerably in detail— 
though not in object—from the original Act of 1937. In 
this legislation the idea of the just price as the means 
of equating consumption and production was completely 
abandoned. Instead, Alberta credit was to be issued by all 
the credit institutions in the province to citizens in the 
form of "social security pensions" and other benefits. There 
was to be no state credit house with a monopoly of issuing 
Alberta credit; neither was there provision for social, 
basic or consumers 1 dividends. 

While the two Acts discussed above contained the tech¬ 
nical and administrative details of the proposed social 
credit system, the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, the 
Bank Employees Civil Rights Act, the Bank Taxation Act and 
the Accurate News and Information Act, set forth the 
political measures which Douglas and some of his followers 
considered necessary before a social credit system would 
function properly. Some of the measures enacted during 
the second and third sessions, 1937, bore considerable 
resemblance to some of Major Douglas* suggestions in his

"Interim Report" presented to the U.F.A. government in 
1935* It is an open question whether the majority of Social 
Credit members of the legislature really favoured the 
principles underlying this "drastic" legislation. Clearly, 
however, they wanted to establish a social credit system 
and for a time the only way this seemed possible was by 
supporting the insurgent leaders who were not opposed to 
the use of repressive measures. It is the writer’s opinion 
that the majority of the Social Credit members did not 
favour the principles of press control and the restrictions 
on the civil rights of individuals, as such. During the 
crisis of 1937, however, it must have been virtually 
impossible for the average Social Credit member to see 
and comprehend the practical results of any principle 
remotely connected with the establishment of an Alberta 
social credit system. 

ALBERTA SOCIAL CREDIT DEBT LEGISLATION 

As we observed earlier the Social Credit victory of 
1935 represented, in part, a mass revolt by the citizens 
of Alberta against the burden of private and public indebt¬ 
edness, And if, after 1935, the government failed to offer 
relief to the farmer and urban debtor through the intro¬ 
duction of social credit, it certainly provided a large 
volume of legislation designed to protect and assist the 
debtors of the province. Undoubtedly much of the present 
attachment to Social Credit in the rural areas of the

province is the result of the private debt policy of the 
Alberta government between 1936 and 1942. 

The Alberta debt legislation struck the f, financial 
interests" at their most vulnerable point. When it became 
recognized that social credit could not be established, 
the governments debt legislation was considered by many 
a continuation of the war against "high finance". On the 
other hand, it must be remembered that the provincial 
government was quite justified in following a "comprehen¬ 
sive" debt adjustment policy in view of the obvious 
inability of Dominion legislation to cope with the problem. 
Moreover, from the economic and social viewpoints there 
was ample justification for the type of policy followed by 
the government. 

alleged 

All told, the/drastic consequences of the governments 
debt policy—consequences foretold by the critics of 
government policy—were never quite realized or experienced 
in fact. It is true that certain loan and mortgage 
corporations refused for a time to extend credit in Alberta 
because, as they said, the governments debt policy had 
increased substantially the risk of operations in the pro¬ 
vince. On the other hand, since the early 1940S the 

, of 

recurrence of high levels/personal and farm income has 
reduced the pressing necessity for credit. Moreover, the 
strong financial position of the provincial government 
in recent years together with the operations of the Treasury 
Branches may have served to cushion the shocks usually 
associated with the type of policy followed in Alberta

between 1936 and 1942. 

The refusal of the government to meet its interest and 
maturity obligations during 1936 and subsequent years has 
been the subject of much discussion in Alberta. In this 
paper we are not concerned with the moral aspects of breach 
of contract; we do, however, attest to the operation of the 
will to self-preservation for, in 1935, very nearly bne- 
half total provincial revenue was required to service the 
provincial debt. Moreover, as at March 31st, 1936, the 
gross bonded debt of Alberta was approximately $202,100,000- 
a higher per capita debt than that of any other Canadian 
province except British Columbia. The $3,600,000 saved by 
the reduction in interest payments allowed the government 
to meet its large relief expenditures without borrowing 
either from the Dominion or from private individuals or 
corporations* 

As was observed earlier, negotiations were begun in 
1941 between the government and the bondholders with the 
object of effecting an adjustment of the provincial debt 
situation. By 1945 agreement had not been reached and 
the government, anxious to readjust its debt position, 
embarked upon a debt reorganization programme which pro¬ 
vided for refunding at a lower interest rate and an 
adjustment to the holders of Alberta bonds. The amount of 
this adjustment, however, was estimated to be roughly one- 

third the money saved by the government since 1936 through 
its interest reduction policy.

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 

As it was presented by William Aberhart, social credit 
appeared to many people as a sure cure for all the ills 
of society. To some it offered the immediate prospect of 
$25*00 a month and to others it guaranteed the inaguration 
of some future era of "Christian economics". To the indebted 
Alberta farmer, social credit meant the availability of 
cheap credit in the future and an end to the tyranny of 
the hated "financial interests". Social credit was peculiarly 
suited to the provincial "norms" where monetary reform as 
a solution to economic problems had long been advocated. 

Many Albertans accepted social credit blindly—on faith, 
as one writer expressed it—and came to believe that it 
alone could restore happiness and prosperity to the 
harassed community. 

The first phase of Social Credit administration, from 
1935 to 1938,was characterized by the attempted establish¬ 
ment of a provincial social credit system. This attempt 
failed because, in the first place, the administrative 
machinery implicit in such a programme could not be 
competently established by a provincial government. All 
told, thirteen Alberta Acts were disallowed, reserved or 
declared ultra vires . The courts refused to sanction a 
social credit system based on the "property and civil rights" 
clause of the B.F.A. Act, 1867. The Dominion*s policy with 
regard to the Alberta social credit legislation produced

dismay in a province where many believed that by cooperation 
and in association, the people could obtain the objectives 
which they desired* But on the other hand, the Dominion 
authorities had only one course to follow if the principle 
of federalism was to be upheld. 

Secondly, the attempted establishment of an Alberta 
social credit system failed because the early Social Credit 
party was not a united party. Although a capable popular 
leader, Mr. Aberhart was quite unable to impose his will 
on the Social Credit private members of the legislature. 

He would not agree with Douglas nor with his more radical 
supporters; he antagonized the members of his own party by 
his unabashed mixture of politics and religion and by his 
sensational antics which kept the province in an uproar 
during the early years of his premiership. He was indes- 
pensable to the party because he controlled the Alberta 
Social Credit League and, as a result, all attempts to 
oust him came to naught. Moreover, he antagonized the 
opposition parties in the legislature at a time when he 
should have been advocating coalition. A policy of this 
nature surely would have strengthened the possibility of 
a successful social credit programme. Of course, it will 
always remain a question whether Aberhart really wanted 
to attempt a social credit programme. 

But for all his shortcomings as a parliamentary and 

party leader/ yias 6 always neeessary if the Social credit 
government was to continue in existence. He possessed a

small but sincere group of ministers and private members 
in whom he could trust and this group supplied the future 
leadership for the party* In any event, the erratic leader¬ 
ship of Aberhart was preferable to any of the available 
alternatives* Certainly government by remote control from 
from Fig Tree Court, London, through the technical envoys, 
produced "nothing but excitement" while it lasted* 

The second phase of Social Credit administration in 
Alberta, from 1938 to 1945 > was characterized by the gradual 
institutionalization of the social credit movement. In the 
1940 election it was alleged that the Social Credit party 
was "just another 11 political party. The death of Mr. 

Aberhart in 1943, the election of Mr. Manning as his 
successor, the election campaign of 1944 as a "crusade 
against socialism 11 and the growing belief that social 
credit could not be applied on a provincial basis, all 
these factors contributed to purge the Social Credit 
party of radical or extremist elements. Further, towards 
the end of this second phase, the Social Credit party 
was not compelled to concern itself about radical measures. 
"Whereas the election of 1940 was Rarely won by the 
party, the 1944 election gave Social Credit a comfortable 
majority. Wartime prosperity made a conservative govern¬ 
ment acceptable to most Albertans. 

The final stage of Social Credit administration, from 
1945 to 1950 was marked by one final, half-hearted attempt

to implement social credit. But the Bill of Rights was 
ruled ultra vires by the courts in 1947 and no further 
attempt has been made. During this final stage of Social 
Credit administration, moreover, the remaining Douglasite 
elements in the party were purged. 

In conclusion, we may say that while the Social Credit 
government failed to establish a provincial social credit 
system, it has enjoyed remarkable success in other spheres. 
The Alberta debt legislation, the school and municipal 
reorganization programmes, the labour, resource conservation 
and health and welfare legislation of the Social Credit 
government are models of legislative achievement and it is 
the success of these and other projects which constitute 
the real legislative achievements of Alberta Social Credit. 
It is regrettable, however, that a province with such a 
fine record should have on its statute books one of the 
most obnoxious pieces of discriminatory group legislation 
to be found anywhere in Canada. 

The present task facing the Social Credit government is 
that of overseeing the exploitation of the great natural 
wealth of Alberta. It is suggested that the future of the 
present government largely rests on its ability to perform 
this tremendous task to the satisfaction of the citizens 
of the province. No amount of harping on "basic dividends", 
the "monetization of natural resources", or the"Cultural 
Heritage" will avert electoral defeat of the present 
government if it fails in this respect.
