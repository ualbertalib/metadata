ELECTROPHORETIC AND DIFFUSION 


STUDIES ON GLUTEN 


J. R. Colvin 


INTRODUCTION 


The properties of wheat proteins, and particularly 
of gluten, have occupied the attention of cereal chemists for 
over two hundred years# Becarri (6) was the first to recognize 
the resemblance between the characteristics of a fraction of 
wheat flour and those of animal flesh. Following this funda¬ 
mental observation, Taddei, Einhof, De Saussure, Leibig and 
Ritthausen attempted, by extensive fractionation and analytic 
techniques, to characterize the product obtained by washing 
starch from wheat flour# Bailey (5, Chap.l) has given a good 
review of the work done during this period# Ritthausen (5), 
on the basis of observations of differences In solubility and 
chemical composition, regarded the proteins of wheat as belong¬ 
ing to five groups:- 1 # Gluten casein. 2 # Gluten fibrin. 

3# Plant gelatin, ij.. Mucedin. 5. Albumin. Owing to the 
crudeness of the chemical techniques available at the time his 
classification must, however, be regarded as of historical 
interest only#

Ritthausen’s work was amplified by later investigators 
but the next great monograph issued on the subject was that 
written by Osborne in 1907 (I4.OX Since Osborne’s report was the 
foundation for the greater part of the work done on wheat 
proteins in the first quarter of the twentieth century, his 
division of these substances will be listed in some detail* 

He based his classification on solubility and composition 
differences but used greatly improved techniques* Osborne be¬ 
lieved that the nitrogenous substance of the wheat berry was a 
mixture of the following distinct component proteins* 

(a) Albumin (leucosin) - Present in relatively small amounts 
(.3$ to *lj.$ of the kernel) this protein was soluble in 
water and 10 $ NaCl but insoluble in saturated 

It was coaguable by heat* 

(b) Globulin - This was soluble in 10 $ NaCl but insoluble in 
water* It was insoluble in saturated (NHj^^SO^* 

(c) Gliadin - This component, which, with the glutenin, made 
up much the greater part of wheat protein, was slightly 
soluble in water, soluble in dilute ethyl alcohol as well 
as other alcohols but insoluble in absolute ethyl alcohol* 

It was dispersed in dilute acids or alkalis but precipitated 
in neutral solutions of salts* 

(d) Glutenin - This corresponded to the plant casein of Ritt- 
hausen* It was Insoluble in water and cold alcohol but 
slightly soluble in hot alcohol* It dispersed easily in 
dilute acids and alkalis*

(e) Proteose - The properties of this fraction,which was present 
in very small amounts, were acknowledged to be uncertain. 

Osborne’s concept of wheat protein as a mixture of 
chemically distinct molecules dominated the thinking of cereal 
chemists for a quarter of a century. Since the gliadin and 
glutenin were found to make up by far the greater fraction of 
wheat gluten, it was naturally assumed that they were jointly 
responsible for most of its properties and an enormous amount 
of effort was spent on the isolation and characterization of 
each of these "proteins.” In particular, the ratio in which 
they were supposed to occur in wheat was thought to be 
correlated with the physical properties of the gluten and with 
the baking quality of flour. Much time was spent on the 
estimation of the optimum proportions. This work has also been 
amply reviewed by Bailey (5, Chap. 2 ). 

Beginning about 1930 and continuing to the present, 
results have been published which are at variance with Osborne’s 
concept. Cook (9) showed that there was no clear-cut distinction 
between the solubilities of gliadin and glutenin in 30$ urea 
solution. This destroyed Osborne’s original basis for separat¬ 
ing the two "proteins,” at least in-so-far as this solvent was 
concerned. A little later, Sinclair and Gortner (52) showed 
that in the more traditional solvents, alcohol and dilute salt 
solutions, the solubility of the "gliadin” and "glutenin” 
fractions was very largely a function of previous treatment and

suggested that the various peptization behaviours were a 
reflection of the physical characteristics of gluten rather 
than of chemical characteristics* This too was supported by 
work of Cook (9) who was unable to find differences in the 
composition and chemical properties of various preparations of 
gliadin commensurate with differences in physical properties. 

Blish and Sandstedt (7), Herd ( 18 ) and Haugaard and Johnson (17) 
using extraction techniques threw serious doubt on the chemical 
distinguishability of "glutenin" while early diffusion and 
ultracentrifuge work (23, 2I4., 26) on gliadin showed that this 
gluten fraction was definitely inhomogeneous as far as mass 
characteristics are concerned. All this work suggested that 
the whole concept of a simple mixture of two distinct proteins 
required revision. 

The hypotheses as to the nature of gluten, stemming 
from the above results, were two. One group, led by Sandstedt 
and Blish (I4.6) believed gluten to be made up of three, main, 
dissociable, component systems, each of which was capable of 
splitting into lesser complexes, following Sorensen*s theory 
of soluble proteins ( 5 ^)* On the other hand, McCalla and 
associates on the strength of reversible fractionation results 
(36, 55) were led to the view that gluten was a single protein 
complex consisting of an association of molecules which varied 
progressively and continuously in physical and chemical properties. 
It is obvious that the two views are the same if the number of 
main dissociable component systems of Sandstedt and Blish becomes 
quite large.

In 19 l| 2 , McCalla and Gral'en published the results of 
an extensive study on gluten in sodium salicylate solutions 
using ultracentrifugal and diffusion methods (37)0 These 
results proved that in sodium salicylate gluten existed in two 
forms, molecularly dispersed and aggregated. There was, however, 
progressive continuous variation in the physical properties and 
dimensions of both the molecules and the aggregates. This 
proved conclusively that ^gliadin" and "glutenin” did not exist 
as distinct entities and also gave strong support to the view 
that gluten is a reversible protein complex, as suggested* 

The study mentioned above proved the heterogeneity of 
gluten in sodium salicylate solutions as far as mass character¬ 
istics are concerned, but no corresponding study of the electrical 
characteristics of gluten in sodium salicylate has been made* 
Moreover, only a very limited amount of work has been done on 
gliadin, gluten or related proteins in other solvents* Wood 
and Hardy (59) had shown that the physical properties of a 
gluten ball were a function of the electrical charge on the 
gluten micelles which in turn depended on the hydrogen ion 
concentration of the surrounding medium* They proved that the 
gluten micelles had a positive charge in acid medium and a 
negative charge in alkali, as was to be expected. Moreover, 
they could find no differences in the behaviour of gluten and 
of a sample of gliadin. On the basis of these results they 
concluded that the physical state of gluten was largely deter¬ 
mined by the potential difference between the protein and the

dispersing fluid* Kemp and Rideal ( 22 ) and Kemp ( 21 ) have 
used the microelectrophoretic technique with gliadin adsorbed 
on quartz to estimate the isoelectric point of gliadin and to 
compare the surface charge densities of various flours* They 
found an isoelectric point of approximately 5*00 for gliadin 
but this value was inversely dependent on ionic strength* 

Despite extensive data on the adsorption of gliadin on quartz, 
few data were given on the surface electrical properties of 
gliadin itself* 

The only study of gliadin using the Tiselius electro¬ 
phoretic technique was that of Schwert, Putnam and Briggs (lj. 9 )« 
Dispersing gliadin in acetate buffers they found that it was 
markedly heterogeneous* Two main fractions of widely different 
mobilities and isoelectric points were identified but these two 
fractions themselves could be subdivided into components* Be¬ 
cause of this heterogeneity and also because of a strong 
asymmetry between patterns obtained in the two legs of the cell 
these workers concluded that gliadin was a mixture of components 
with widely different surface charges interacting in a non-ionic 
manner* 

While the present study was in progress Scallet ( 1 ^ 7 ) 
published a report of a study on zein in aqueous alcohol using 
the Tiselius electrophoretic apparatus. As the result of 
multiple fractionations followed by electrophoretic analysis, 
he concluded that zein was a typical association-dissociation 
system as described by Sorensen ( 5I4.) o

Since electrophoretic data naturally supplement 
ultracentrifugal and diffusion data (1, p.131) this study was 
undertaken. It seemed logical to suppose that the known variation 
in the chemical composition of gluten fractions (36) would be 
reflected In their electrical behaviour and information on such 
variability would lead to a better understanding of the mechanics 
of the gluten complex. Specifically, It was hoped to determine 
the number of components in gluten and their electrophoretic 
mobilities. Later, this objective was broadened to include the 
charge density of the molecularly dispersed gluten particle. 

These data, with existing ultracentrifugal and diffusion values, 
might then allow an estimate of the size and degree of hydration 
of the molecule ( 1 , Chap.5). 


MATERIALS AND METHODS 


The gluten used throughout this study was obtained 
from an unbleached high quality flour milled from hard red 
spring wheat by one of the local mills. The ash and protein 
content of this flour were and respectively. Y&ien 

baked by a standard malt-phosphate-brornate formula, this flour 
gave high quality loaves of good volume and texture. The gluten 
itself was in every way typical of that from the best Canadian 
spring wheat, being firm, elastic and extensible.

The solutions of sodium salicylate used for dispersion 
were made up carefully by weight on a laboratory torsion balance 
from C.P. reagent grade chemicals. Unless otherwise stated, 
all solutions used were of 0.5 ionic strength (0.5ju) which 
corresponds to slightly less than 8 % sodium salicylate by 
weight. All preparations were checked before use against a 
standard solution by a conductivity apparatus. 

Because McCalla and Grak&n had found that gluten 
existed in two different forms in sodium salicylate, the 
electrophoretic properties of two series of gluten were inves¬ 
tigated; i.e. molecularly dispersed gluten and whole gluten. 

Each series was represented by four samples prepared from the 
flour in as uniform a manner as possible and stored under the 
same conditions. The molecularly dispersed series was prepared 
as described by McCalla and Gral&n for their C IV fraction 
except that the final dispersion was made in 0.5 ji solution 
rather than in 12 % sodium salicylate. Each of the samples in 
the "whole gluten” series was prepared by washing the starch 
from 100 g. of ether-extracted flour with Dill and Alsberg’s 
buffer (12) for ten minutes. The resulting gluten ball was 
immediately torn into small pieces and allowed to disperse in 
a liter of sodium salicylate solution for three days with 
occasional gentle shaking. The undispersed gluten was then 
removed by centrifuging and the opaque solution clarified by 
adding magnesium sulphate until the solution was .015$ saturated 
with respect to this salt. After removal of the precipitate by

a second centrifugation, the solution was diluted to a protein 
content of from 0.6$ to 0.8$ and stored at 5°G. until used. 

Electrophoretic mobilities ancLpatterns were obtained 
at 2 . 0 °t O.O5 using a Tiselius apparatus manufactured by Klett 
Manufacturing Co. and described by Longsworth (JO). Details of 
dialysis of sample, cell manipulation and instrument handling 
were essentially as given in papers by Longsworth, Maclnnes and 
Svensson ( 28 , 30, 33, 3I4., 57) except for the following modifies- 
tions. It was found that the power supply using a #80 rectifier 
tube could not maintain a constant voltage at the relatively 
high currents needed (20 to 2 J m.a.). Accordingly, B batteries 
in series were substituted as a source of potential. This 
arrangement held the voltage satisfactorily constant. Longsworth 
(29) has described the use of a cell which eliminates errors in 
mobility due to movement of the rubber sleeves on the original 
Tiselius apparatus* Sine© no Longsworth cell was available, we 
were forced to use a Tiselius cell. This necessity has been 
reflected in the lack of precision in the pH-mobility curves 
(see Fig. 5) and is the greatest single source of error in this 
study. It was accentuated by the low mobility of the gluten 
in the buffer. 

Mobilities were calculated using the method of Longs¬ 
worth and Maclnnes ( 5 ^ 4 -) for locating the boundary and the formula

were enlarged approximately four times and measurements were

made directly on these enlargements• By this method boundaries 
could be located within ©01 cm© which, with a boundary travel 
of 1*5 cm©, represents an error of 0 . 6 $. This is well within 
the limits of error set by the source mentioned above. 

Conductivities were measured using an Industrial 
instrument which on testing with a calibrated cell showed an 
accuracy of tl. 0 $. This comparatively low' order of accuracy 
had to be used since no better instrument was immediately avail¬ 
able. The relative error due to this factor was probably 
reduced by the fact that the conductivity of the 0©5 ji solution 
was quite constant at the given temperature for different samples© 

Hydrogen ion concentrations were measured with a 
Beckmann Model G pH meter to -O0O5 units© It will be noticed 
that no buffer salts were used in addition to the main electro¬ 
lyte. This was because repeated preliminary tests showed 
that no changes in hydrogen ion concentration took place in the 
boundary area even after 10 hours of passing a 25 ma* current. 

During the course of the study it was found necessary 
to determine the diffusion constant of molecularly dispersed 
gluten at 2 * 0 ° ± .05 in sodium salicylate. This was done by 
supporting a Neurath cell (38} in the thermostat of the electro¬ 
phoresis apparatus at a position where the magnification was 

unity and using the formula n for calculation 

k- 7Tt(%)2 

from the patterns obtained as by Rothen {I4.5) • With a polydisperse 
substance such as gluten, this formula yields only a mean value

for the diffusion constant but this was satisfactory for a 
first approximation* A test of the method on *1 M sucrose at 
20° gave a mean diffusion constant from twelve determinations 
of ( 1^*3 t 0 * 9 ) X 10 "7 moles/cm"/sec• as compared with the value 
from International Critical Tables of (Ij 4 . t 2 *) X 1CT? moles/cri^sec• 
Viscosities were determined using an Ostwald viscosi¬ 
meter calibrated against water at 2 * 0 ° t 0 * 05 * Techniques were 
as described by Findlay (13)* 

After several unsuccessful attempts to determine the 
charge on the gluten molecule by means of membrane potentials 
(2, 3) the moving boundary method as suggested by Longsworth 
(31) and Svensson (57) was modified for use with gluten in 
sodium salicylate* Since Longsworth had developed the theory 
in greater detail and checked it against other methods for egg 
albumin, his procedure was followed* Essentially, for auni¬ 
univalent electrolyte, the application of this method depends 
on the determination of the relative mobilities of the protein, 
the buffer cation and the buffer anion, together with the change 
in refractive index per equivalent of buffer and the change in 
refractive index at the buffer-concentration boundary (Longs- 
worth’s nomenclature) per unit concentration of protein in the 
moving boundary. Then, by application of the formula taken 
from Longsworth (31),

estimated by an Abb& refractometer used on ten samples of solu¬ 
tion of progressively varying concentration* This value is 
accurate to at least 0*3$. 

The absolute mobility of the protein ion can be found 
from the electrophoretic measurements but in order to find its 
relative mobility it was necessary to know the mobilities of 
the sodium and salicylate ions at 2*0° in 0*5 sodium salicylate. 
Such values are not given in the literature and the apparatus 
necessary for ascertaining them directly was not available.

Accordingly, it was necessary to calculate values from data 
for these ions at infinite dilution and 25°C* (1I4., 15, 27) on 
the following assumptions* 

1 . That sodium salicylate is a strong electrolyte and 
completely dissociated* 

2 * That the transference numbers of the Na + and salicylate 

ion are practically constant with variation in temperature* 

3* That the transference numbers of Na + and salicylate 

ion are affected only slightly by change in concentration* 
Assumption 1 is probably true since sodium salicylate has most 
of the properties of a strong electrolyte* However, it is irell 
known that assumptions 2 and 3 are not valid in general (35)* 
Independent evidence for the validity of 3 in the case of sodium 
salicylate was obtained from the stationary character of the 
buffer-concentration boundaries in routine electrophoresis 
experiments* These boundaries remain practically motionless 
over a period of four hours and this can only occur when the 
transference numbers of the ions are the same in both solutions 
(57)* ^h© correctness of assumption 2 is more questionable but 

Getman and Daniels (lljj and Glasstone (15) show that the variation 
is small, except for the most highly hydrated ions, over a wide 
temperature range* Therefore, for a first approximation and as 
a working hypothesis, it is believed that these two simplifica¬ 
tions are justified® Using these assumptions and the published 
values for the absolute mobility of the sodium ion at 25 0 and

infinite dilution (llj.) the relative mobilities of the three 
ions involved were calculated* 

The determination of the change in refractive index 
at the buffer-concentration boundary per unit concentration 
of protein proved more difficult* The lack of a hollow prism 
made it impossible to apply Longsworth’s procedure (3Q, 51)* 
Moreover, because of the extremely small quantities involved, 
efforts to measure them directly failed* It was necessary to 
resort to an indirect method as follows: Under the same con¬ 
ditions of temperature, magnification, type of cell as in 
electrophoresis, large schlieren patterns due to a boundary 
between water and a *1 molar solution of sucrose in water were 
obtained* The method was essentially that used by Rothen (4,5) 
in his adaptation of the electrophoretic apparatus for studying 
diffusion of ribonuclease* Since the areas of these patterns 
as measured by a planimeter are proportional to the difference^ 
in the refractive index of the two solutions at the boundary, 
which can be measured with a refractometer, it is possible to 
associate a unit area under a curve with a fixed difference in 
refractive index at the boundary (all other conditions remain¬ 
ing constant)* Therefore, the area under a buffer concentration 
boundary peak, as obtained in Routine measurements, multiplied 
by the constant obtained as above gives the value of the 
refractive index change at the boundary* This change in 
refractive index can then be correlated with the protein con¬ 
centration of the solution in the cell as determined by a

Kjeldahl procedure* Since the relationship is linear for 
dilute solutions of proteins (51), the slope of this line gives 
the refractive index change per unit concentration of protein 
at the buffer-concentration boundary, which is the parameter 
required* 


After this investigation was nearly complete, it 
became apparent that it would b© useful to know the density of 
dry gluten* No estimate of this constant could b© found so 
an attempt was made to determine it by the methods of Neurath 
and Bull ( 39 ) for egg albumin* Their materials and technique 
were followed closely throughout except in the preparation of 
the sample* 


As a means of estimating the relative importance of 
starch and electrolyte contamination in the final product, the 
gluten for the density determination was prepared by two methods, 
each representated by five independent samples* 

In method 1, the gluten ball as obtained from 20 g* 
of ether-extracted flour was merely washed extremely thoroughly 
with distilled water until only the faintest traces of starch 
were apparent in a sedimentation test. In general, this re¬ 
quired more than an hour per sample. The thoroughly washed 
gluten was then frozen and ground, while frozen, to a coarse 
powder. The water was removed from this frozen gluten by 
lyophilization In a high vacuum over P^G^* Throughout this 
process, the sample was kept frozen by solid CO^* The resulting

coarse granules which retained the natural color of gluten 
were powdered in a mortar and stored over P 2°5 used * 

All the original properties of the gluten could be recovered 
by the addition of water to this powder. 

In method 2 , the gluten was washed from 20 g. of 
ether-extracted flour in the ordinary manner and dispersed 
for three days in sodium salicylate. The undispersed material 
was then centrifuged off and the opaque solution, now con¬ 
sidered to be free from starch, made up to 20$ saturation with 
magnesium sulphate. The gluten precipitated by the magnesium 
sulphate was collected on a stirring rod and washed as thor¬ 
oughly as possible with distilled water to remove the 
electrolytes. It was then frozen and lyophilized in the seme 
manner as for the undispersed series. 

Throughout this study, all protein concentrations 
were estimated by a miero-Kjeldahl apparatus accurate to il$ 
of the total nitrogen present.

RESULTS 


Preliminary Experiments 

Orientation Experiment on Egg Albumin 

Before undertaking work on gluten, it was thought 
advisable to check the apparatus and technique by duplicating 
previous work on a well known protein# For this experiment, 
the work of Tiselius on egg-albumin (58) was taken as reference 
except that the egg albumin was prepared according to the 
method of Kekwick and Cami an ( 20 )# The results are plotted 
in Fig. 1 # 

It is evident from the graph that the agreement 
between the observed pH-mobility curve and that of Tiselius is 
not as good as might be hoped for. The isoelectric point is 
shifted O0I5 pH units to the left as compared with the Tiselius 
value, which is three times greater than the error involved in 
reading the pH meter. Moreover, tests showed this discrepancy 
to be reproducible. In spite of this, these results were taken 
as indicating the general reliability of the technique, apparatus 
and methods of calculation used because the slopes of the two 
curves are identical. This could be so only if there were no 
serious mistakes in methods of observation and calculation. 

It was assumed that the difference in isoelectric points was

due to small differences in the original material or to 
differences in preparation* It is unlikely that the differ¬ 
ence is due to errors in the standard buffer solution because 
this was made up carefully according to Clark (8) and checked 
against commercial buffer tablets. 

Effect of Sodium Salicylate on Egg White Proteins 

Since sodium salicylate is a denaturing agent for some 
proteins (Ij.) and must be used in rather high concentrations for 
gluten, the possibility of its altering or covering up some of 
the properties of the protein must be borne in mind. Hose and 
Cook (lilj.) have shown that this reagent has only a slight 
effect on the properties of gluten as compared with the more 
usual dispersing agents, and Spencer and McCalla have demon¬ 
strated that there is no permanent alteration in the character 
of gluten after dispersion in salicylate (55). However this 
does not prove that there is not a temporary modification of 
the surface properties, particularly surface charge densities, 
while the gluten is dispersed. To demonstrate the effect of 
sodium salicylate solutions on a well characterized protein (32) 
the patterns of egg white in this reagent and in Sorensen’s 
phosphate buffer, which is widely used as a buffering agent, 
were obtained. The patterns for this mixture of proteins 
are given at .1 M and at *5 M for both solutions in Fig. 2 
and Fig. 3 respectively. An inspection of these patterns

shows that the number of components of egg-white in sodium 
salicylate is the same as that in phosphate buffer* Moreover, 
the separation of components in sodium salicylate is equally 
as sharp as that in phosphate. A comparison of patterns at the 
two concentrations of both reagents indicates that the only 
effect of the increased ionic strength is a reduction in mobility 
as might be expected. Prom this, it was concluded that,for the 
proteins of egg-white sodium salicylate is at least as satisfactory 
a buffer as Sorensen's phosphate* Unfortunately a similar direct 
comparison of the two solutions for gluten is not possible owing 
to the insolubility of gluten in most neutral solutions. The 
assumption has to be made that sodium salicylate has no more 
specific effects on gluten than on egg-white proteins. 

The Effect of Acetic Acid. Sodium Hydroxide and Urea Solutions 

as Dispersing Agents. 

The previous experiment suggested that it would be 
useful to know the behaviour of gluten in the other common dis¬ 
persing agents, acetic acid, dilute sodium hydroxide and J0% 
urea. Representative patterns for gluten in .1 N acetic acid, 

.1 N NaOH and urea are given in Pig. ij.. .For obvious 
reasons, no common conditions of pH, field strength or ionic 
strength are possible.

Electrophoresis patterns for gluten in 

(a) *1 N acetic acid f

-2!+- 


As indicated by these patterns,gluten in acetic acid 
is markedly heterogeneous; at least two components are distin** 
guishable and there are some indications of others. This is in 
agreement with the findings of Schwert, Putnam and Briggs U}-9) 
for gliadin. The heterogeneity is apparent in the HaOH solution 
but to a much smaller degree. In urea, however, gluten shows 
only one component which moves very slowly, probably as a 
result of the very high viscosity of the medium. The poor 
pattern obtained for urea was caused by the great opalescence 
and consequent low light transmission of the solutions. 

The very different electrophoretic behaviour of gluten 
in these reagents can be correlated with the known specific 
effects of the reagents on other properties of gluten. Cook 
and Rose (11) found that acetic acid and sodium hydroxide caused 
marked hydrolysis of the gluten which was reflected in the vis¬ 
cosity of its solutions, while urea had practically no hydrolytic 
effect and may have had a coagulating tendency. Thus the hetero¬ 
geneity of gluten in acetic acid and in sodium hydroxide is 
probably due to the presence of artifacts. However, it must be 
noted that Cook found the effect of sodium hydroxide on gluten 
to be much greater than that of acetic acid which is the reverse 
of the situation indicated by our patterns.

Main Electrophoresis Experiments 

Following the completion of the preliminary experiments 
and a number of trial runs, pH-mobility curves for both the 
whole gluten and the molecularly dispersed gluten were determined. 
It was, of course, possible to obtain electrophoretic patterns 
for each series at the same time. The results of this study 
are given in Tables I and II and are plotted in Fig. 5 and Fig.

A study of Figures 7 and 8 shows that both the whole 
gluten and the molecularly dispersed portion are electrically 
homogeneous in sodium salicylate. The patterns are asymmetrical 
to a small degree in some cases but no patterns were obtained 
in which a separation of the peak could not be correlated with 
an error in technique. The only conclusion possible is that 
in sodium salicylate all fractions of gluten are essentially 
the same electrostatically. This does not apply to all por¬ 
tions of the nitrogenous constituents of wheat, however. It 
will be noticed that the patterns exhibit a very small peak 
migrating ahead of the main boundary. This was a constant 
feature of all patterns and its presence is proof that if major 
components are present in gluten, this technique should dis¬ 
cover them. That the small peak or boundary is not a major 
fraction of gluten is proved by its size alone; it represents 
only a very small fraction of the total protein present and 
therefore cannot be important in the complete complex. It has 
been identified tentatively as an impurity in the sample due 
to the presence of non-gluten protein ( 57 ) [see Appendix II] • 
Figures 5 and 6 show that within the pH range studied, 
I^.OO to 8.25, gluten carries a negative charge. Moreover, the 
size of this charge is remarkably insensitive to changes in pH. 
This is shown by the very low slope of the regression line. 
However, this low slope is probably due to the fact that it 
was not possible to work in the isoelectric range because

salicylic acid precipitates from the solution at pH values 
less than All pH-mobility curves approach zero slope at 

hydrogen-ion concentrations remote from the isoelectric point* 
Independent evidence for the existence of an isoelectric point 
for gluten in sodium salicylate at a pH less than l^.O was given 
by the strong tendency for the gluten to precipitate at pH 
values less than 5 * 0 * Below pH 5.0 it was difficult to keep 
the gluten in solution although this tendency to settle out 
was not accompanied by the precipitation of salicylic acid 
until pH ij _.0 was reached. This very low isoelectric point of 
gluten in sodium salicylate will be referred to again in connec¬ 
tion with the high value of the surface charge density. 

A comparison of Pig. 5 with Pig. 6 will show that the 
slopes of the regression lines are approximately the same for 
whole gluten and for the moleculariy dispersed fraction. This 
is confirmed by statistical analysis# and this fact corroborates 
the suggestion from the electrophoresis patterns that the sur¬ 
face charge characteristics are the same in both cases, since 
they react similarly to changes in the medium. Statistical 
analysis also proves*'* that the mean mobility at any given pH 
is lower for the moleculariy dispersed fraction than for whole 
gluten. Since the mean particle size is lower for the moleculariy 
dispersed fraction (37) anc * the evidence given above indicates 
that the surface charge densities are approximately equal, this 
lower mobility must be a reflection of a larger frictional

ratio o This is in agreement with the observation of 
1 o 

McCalla and Gralfen that the most soluble fraction of gluten 
has the largest frictional coefficient* Assuming constant 
hydration, this in turn must mean that the particles making 
up the most soluble portion of gluten have the greatest length 
to breadth ratio* 

These two experiments compel two conclusions; 

1* That in sodium salicylate, gluten is an electrostatically 
homogeneous substance, 2* That the isoelectric point of gluten 
in sodium salicylate is somewhere below pH l+.Q* These con¬ 
clusions concerning the nature of gluten are so much at variance 
with the results of Schwert, Putnam and Briggs (Ip9) on gli&din 
that it was worthwhile to repeat their study using gluten from 
our flour* It proved possible to duplicate their work in all 
respects but one* Even at field strengths in excess of those 
mentioned in their report no multiple separation of the two 
main components into lesser complexes could be obtained* All 
other observations made by these authors were confirmed, however, 
proving that the source of the discrepancy does not lie in the 
raw material used* We are forced to the conclusion that the 
fundamental mechanisms of dispersion in acetic acid and in 
sodium salicylate must be different* 

While this study was in progress, Scallet (1+7) pub¬ 
lished a report on the electrophoretic analysis of zein, in 
which he observed that as the ionic strength increased, separa¬ 
tion of components in the mixture decreased* It has been

suggested that this suppression is the cause of the apparent 
electrophoretic homogeneity of gluten. To test this point 
as far as physical conditions would permit, a dispersion of 
gluten in 0*5 jol salicylate was diluted until the protein was 
on the verge of precipitation. The final concentration of 
sodium salicylate was 0.3 M, An electrophoretic analysis was 
then made on the sample at this concentration. The results 
are shown in Pig. 

It will be observed that these two plates give no 
more evidence for the heterogeneity of gluten than do those 
conducted at 0*5 jjl » One main peak only is present in each 
pattern. Since 0,3 M is still a fairly concentrated solution, 
this experiment is not conclusive, but taken in conjunction 
with the presence of the non-gluten protein boundaries, it is 
a strong indication that the homogeneity of gluten is not due 
to suppression by high salt concentration.

It was also thought that the failure to resolve 
components in gluten might be simply due to the low mobility 
in the high salt concentrations. If this were so. Increasing 
the current-time product should tend to separate components. 
Accordingly, an experiment was conducted on whole gluten in 
0*5 yu sodium salicylate using as high a current as the thermo¬ 
stat would allow for as long a period as the electrode capacity 
would permit. The results are shown in Fig. 10. 

These patterns are in every way comparable to those 
obtained under the less rigourous conditions and give no 
support to the above suggestion. 

Summing up all the evidence, the most reasonable inter¬ 
pretation is that sodium salicylate does not seriously affect 
the separation of components. The work with egg-white proteins, 
non-gluten protein constituents and with low concentrations of 
electrolytes supports this view. It must be pointed out, none- 
the-less, that this evidence is suggestive only, not conclusive. 
Sookne and Harris ( 55 ) working with the proteins of silk have 
shown that the more complex ions such as phthalate and picrate 
are preferentially adsorbed, sometimes to the point where the 
isoelectric point disappears from the range studied. If gluten 
constituents should selectively adsorb salicylate ions, it might 
raise their electronegativity to a point where smaller initial 
differences are not distinguishable. This question deserves 
further study.

In Table III are given the values obtained from thirteen 
determinations of the diffusion constant of molecularly dis¬ 
persed gluten at 2*0° i .05 with the corresponding period of 
diffusion* It will be observed that, in general, the longer 
periods are associated ?«rith the lower diffusion constants. This 
is because some slight mixing of solutions is unavoidable when 
forming the boundaries. The effect of mixing is to raise the 
apparent diffusion constant but it is obvious that the effect 
will approach zero as the time of diffusion approaches infinity.

a plot of i against the diffusion constant was calculated and 

the "true” diffusion constant taken as the value at which 

1=0. Corrected in this manner, the mean diffusion constant 
t 

of molecularly dispersed gluten in 0.5 p sodium salicylate at 
2 .0° was estimated as ( 1*91 1 * 09 ) X 10“? moles/cm 2 /sec• 

It cannot be reiterated too frequently that the value 
of the diffusion constant obtained here Is a mean value for 
the molecularly dispersed portion of gluten and therefore any 
particular part of this fraction may be expected to yield 
values T/ihich differ from the figure given. Since gluten is a 
polydisperse system (37) th© same limitation applies to 
practically all numbers which are used to describe any apprec¬ 
iable part of the complex. These numbers are intended to give 
a reliable general description of the protein; not to furnish 
exact magnitudes for a particular case.

In Table IV are given the results of a determination of 
the density of dry gluten, prepared by the two methods described 
previously. It is evident from inspection that the two series 
must differ and this opinion is sustained by statistical 
analysis#. Since the washed samples were known to contain 
very small amounts of starch which has a density of I.5O (l6), 
the mean of the values for the reprecipitated series was taken 
as the better estimate of the density of dry gluten.

diffusion equations "is clearly that of the medium and is 
equivalent to the coefficient of viscosity as determined in 
the laboratory#" When the solutions become more concentrated 
and particularly when the particles are both highly charged 
and highly anisometric, this is no longer true# As a result 
of the higher concentration, the Helmholtz double layers of the 
particles overlap and there is a mechanical interference of 
the particles with each other# This effect of the motion of 
all neighbouring particles upon the migrating particle is called 
the hydrodynamic effect by Abramson, Moyer and Gorin# 

In addition, they distinguish two non-hydrodynamic inter¬ 
actions between protein molecules# One type occurs in highly 
concentrated protein solutions where the molecules lie so close 
together that their double layers become superimposed# This 
particular effect is not important for the interpretation of 
the equations to be given# Their second non-hydrodynamic effect, 
however, is quite important for the particular case of gluten 
and is a result of the definite orientation of highly anisometric, 
charged particles in a medium as a result of the electrostatic 
forces between them. These forces tend to arrange the molecules 
with their axes in a preferred direction# This means that 
additional work must be done to destroy this orientation on 
movement of the medium# As the above authors point out, the 
theory of these effects is largely undeveloped and those parts 
of it which have been considered are untested experimentally# 

For this reason, the adoption of any value for the viscosity

terra in these equations has an element of arbitrariness* 
None-the-less, since these flow-resisting forces undoubtedly 
exist in the solutions and must be taken into account at least 
partially, the viscosity of the whole solution rather than that 
of the medium has been adopted as the closer approximation to 
the truth*

of the mean charge of the molecularly dispersed gluten particles 
as outlined previously. The constants used and the results 
of the application of Longsworth’s formula are summarized in

This calculation gives the mean "valence" of molecularly dis¬ 
persed gluten at pH 6.00 in 0.5 ji sodium salicylate as 3I4.* 

Prom the low slope of the curve shown in Pig. 6 it is evident 
that this is an estimate of molecular charge over a considerable 
range of pH. For a protein of molecular weight ijlf^QOO, this 
"valence" is high. Egg albumin with a comparable molecular 
weight varies from 0 to —li*. over a similar interval. This is 
a further indication of possible specific ion effects of 
salicylate on gluten (53)* reversible adsorption of negative 

salicylate ions on the gluten micelle may raise the electro¬ 
negativity of the molecule to the observed high value. This 
would also explain the displacement of the isoelectric point 
so far towards the acid range and the observed flattening of 
the pH-mobility curve. 

Estimation of Molecular Weight Prom Diffusion and Viscosity Data 

It is possible to check the internal consistency of the 
data listed by a calculation of the molecular weight of the 
protein. Poison (Ij. 2 ) and Svedberg and Pedersen (56) have shown 
that if the diffusion constant, the partial specific volume and 
the frictional coefficient of a particle are known, a reasonably 
accurate estimate of the molecular weight is possible from 
the formula.

according to Svedberg and Pedersen (56, Appendix II) with the

14.8,000 was found for molecularly dispersed gluten. This is in 

satisfactory agreement with the ultracentrifugal value of l^lp,000

These data also furnish reliable evidence against the 

hypothesis that gluten is a highly hydrated sphere. It is possible

r is found to b© lj.5.6 A. Prom the density data given, an 
unhydrated gluten molecule of molecular weight [jij.,000 corresponds 

0 

to a sphere of radius 23*8 A. Therefore in order to explain the 
observed diffusion constant by hydration of a sphere it is 
necessary to postulate the adsorption of a shell of water 

o 

approximately 20 A in thickness* Such a shell is extremely 
improbable on the basis of electrostatic forces alone (1, p.151) 
and therefore the data must be interpreted on the assumption of 
rather large asymmetry of the molecule. Such asymmetry may be 
represented by two models; (a) The oblate ellipsoid, (b) The 
prolate ellipsoid* Simha has shown that for proteins in general 
and for gliadin in particular, the prolate ellipsoid is the 
much more probable model (51). On the basis of this evidence, 
therefore, it is concluded that an elongated ellipsoid of 
revolution is a reasonable approximation to the shape of the 
gluten molecule. 

Molecular Length-Breadth Ratio 

The frictional coefficient £— has sometimes been used 

^ o 

as a parameter for the estimation of the axial ratios of mole¬ 
cules. This procedure is not valid in general since the coefficient 
is a function of the degree of hydration of the molecule as well 
as its asymmetry. The two effects cannot be separated by a 
single measurement except for the special cases of zero hydra¬ 
tion or completely spherical molecules (56). Poison (I4.2) and 
more recently Simha (50) have given equations from which an

estimate of the axial ratios of anisometric molecules can be 
obtained from viscosity data. Poison’s equation is an empirical 
generalization of Kuhn’s equation (25) for rod shaped particles 
and he has shown (I4.2) that it gives results in good agreement 
with experimental values* Simha’s equation is an extension of 
Einstein’s relation 



where u = viscosity of solution 

u = ” ” solvent 

o 

c = volume fraction of solute 
and Vis a shape factor, 

to the case where the particles are prolate or oblate ellip¬ 
soids suspended in a medium* He too has demonstrated that 
results calculated on the basis of his equation are in good 
agreement with experiment (50)*

L. = 1 + I4..O0V + 0 . 098 cVk 2 

u o 

where c = cone* of protein in grams/c*c* 

V = partial specific volume 

k = axial ratio = Length of ellipsoid

gives a k value of l6*J for molecularly dispersed gluten* Sub¬

leads to a k value of 17 * 1 • Thus the results using the two 
methods are in essentially good agreement. Taking the mean of 
the two estimates gives a mean axial ratio of l6 0 ? for the 
molecularly dispersed gluten particle. 

The good agreement of these two equations, while reassur¬ 
ing, must not be overstressed. It is to be expected that they 
would tend to the same value since both are based on similar 
assumptions; that is, on complete Brownian movement among 
rotational ellipsoids. As has been pointed out by Robinson (ij.3), 
it is of paramount importance that the basis of these equations 
be realized. If complete Brownian movement does not exist and 
the particles are to some extent oriented, viscosity is reduced 
and therefore the apparent value of k is lowered. The tendency 
towards orientation is particularly strong in capillary viscosi¬ 
meters wi th their high rates of shear. Moreover, orientation 
is much more probable with greatly anisometric particles. 
Therefore, the value 16*7 is to be regarded as a lower limit 
until it can be confirmed by improved methods* 

In spite of these limitations, if Perrin 1 s formula (tpl) 
for prolate ellipsoids is used to calculate the IL corresponding 
to a k value of 16.7, we obtain a frictional coefficient of 1.86 
which is in satisfactory agreement with McCalla and Gralen’s 
figure of I.92 after the effects of possible hydration are 


considered

Molecular Volumes and Radius 

Abramson has shown (1, p.130) that the combination 
of diffusion data and frictional coefficient also permits an 
independent calculation of the molecular volume. Using the 
equation 



where k = Boltzmann*s constant 
1j = viscosity of solution 
V = molecular volume 
D = diffusion constant 

and the constants listed, we obtain a mean molecular volume for 
the gluten particle of 56 X IQ^A^, Calculation of the molecular 
volume of dry gluten from the density data listed also gives a 
value of X 10 A * This agreement must be regarded as partly 
fortuitous, however, since the gluten molecule is almost cer¬ 
tainly hydrated to some extent. The close approximation indicates 
strongly, however, that the hydration of gluten cannot be great 
or it would be reflected in a much larger molecular volume as 
calculated from diffusion data® 

Combining the data for molecular volume from diffusion 

and the estimate of the axial ratio of the gluten particle from 

© 

viscosity yields a radius of 9.3A for the gluten molecule. For 
the reasons pointed out above, this figure is certainly a little 
low since the effects of hydration would tend to increase the 
radius. However, it is possible to get a second, independent 
estimate of the molecular radius from elect]© phoretic results*

Abramson ( 1 , p. 128 ) gives the equation for electrophoretic 
mobility of a randomly oriented long rod as 

f (j +n )* 

where v = electrophoretic mobility

K = Debye-Kuckel parameter 

r*C = s.verage radius of ions in the ion atmosphere 
around the particle.

where a = radius of rod

If the assumption is made that a prolate ellipsoid of 
great.asymmetry approximates a long rod, this equation yields 
a molecular radius of ll|A. In contrast to the diffusion data, 
this value must certainly be too high since it corresponds to 
a molecular volume of several times that calculated from density 
data* Such a degree of hydration is extremely improbable for 
reasons outlined before* Moreover, the relatively good agreement 
between the observed value of

from the axial ratio is direct evidence against such a large 
hydration. The discrepancy is certainly due to the rather wide 
limits of error in the original data and to deviations from the 
original assumptions of the Debye-Huckel theory of solutions 
upon which the equation is based. Solutions of 0.5 ionic 
strength, even of uni-univalent electrolytes, are entering the 
region where no known laws are obeyed and therefore it is to be 
expected that the results will be approximate only. 

Summarizing then, the mean radius of molecularly dis¬ 
persed gluten must be somewhere between 10 A and I3A . With 
the present data, of a low order of accuracy, it is not poss¬ 
ible to set closer limits. 


DISCUSSION 


These results serve to confirm and extend the concept 
of gluten as described by McCalla and Gral'en ( 37 )* On the 
basis of ultracentrifuge and diffusion results they suggested 
that gluten was a reversible complex made up of molecules which 
varied progressively and continuously in both chemical and 
physical properties. On the observations of a high frictional 
ratio, the suggestion was made that these molecules were greatly 
elongated in shape but no data were presented to enable distinc¬ 
tion between the possible alternatives of extremely high hydra¬ 
tion of spheres or of a flattened shape. The enormous degree

of hydration necessary to explain the diffusion values given 

in this study on the assumption of a spherical model, clearly 

exclude this possibility* Moreover, Simha, by his equation 

applied to viscosity data, has shown that the oblate ellipsoid 

model is extremely unlikely for gliadin (51)* Since gliadin 

is a derivative of gluten, it is justifiable to extend his 

findings to the whole complex and so we are reduced to the 

prolate ellipsoid as the most likely model for the gluten 

molecule* In sodium salicylate, these ellipsoids of revolution 

are capable of existing singly or in aggregation, depending 

on the concentration of the salt in the solution* If they are 

aggregated, the available evidence indicates that it is side 

by side association ( 37 ) rather than end to end attachment as 

in some viruses (ij. 8 }* The data given here indicate that the 

mean diameter of the particles making up the most soluble 

© 

fraction of gluten is of the order of 25 A and their length 
of the order of 1|.00 A to lf -50 1 . This applies only to the 
molecularly dispersed fraction, of course* Very much larger 
aggregates undoubtedly exist in the ordinary dispersion* 

The mean surface charge density of gluten in sodium 
salicylate has a large uniform negative value which may be 
due to the reversible selective adsorption of the salicylate 
ions by the gluten. If this suggestion is valid it may offer 
a clue to the mechanism of dispersal of gluten in sodium 
salicylate. The bonds between salicylate ions and gluten 
particles may replace those between adjacent micelles, leading 


no.

to the disintegration of the gluten mass. The sol so produced 
would then be stabilized by the high negative charge of the 
particles. Unfortunately, these data give no new information 
on the nature of the forces between gluten molecules or gluten 
aggregates. It was hoped that this method might suggest an 
explanation of the unique properties of gluten but this hope 
was unfulfilled. 

In addition, these data give little new light on the 
extent of hydration of the gluten molecule. The observations 
recorded here are not of sufficient precision to permit a 
reliable calculation of the percentage hydration. Also, it 
seems doubtful if the theory is sufficiently developed or the 
assumptions on which it is based sufficiently well fulfilled 
to justify the attempt at greater accuracy. In the writer f s 
opinion, since the development of the lyophilization technique, 
as applied to gluten, removes many methodological barriers, 
a much more fruitful approach to the problem could be made by 
studying volume contraction. This has been used quite success¬ 
fully by Neurath and Bull (J 9 ) on e gg albumin. 

It must be emphasized that the results given here are 
essentially preliminary in character. The technique and the 
apparatus used were not sufficiently precise to warrant more 
than provisional conclusions. It is hoped to confirm them by 
more precise observations in the future.

summary 


1# Gluten dispersed in 0«5 ji sodium salicylate at 2.0°C. 
has been studied by means of the Tiselius electrophoretic 
apparatus and the Neurath diffusion cell. 

2 . The results of the observations indicate that gluten 

in this dispersing agent is electrostatically homogeneous with 
a high mean negative "valence” of 3 I 4 . and therefore a high 
charge density. This charge density may be due to the selective 
adsorption of salicylate ions on gluten. 

3 . The isoelectric point of gluten in this dispersing 
agent is below pH lj..O. 

1+# The gluten particles molecularly dispersed in 0.5 Ji 
sodium salicylate are prolate ellipsoids of revolution of the 
order of 25 A in diameter and 1+00 to I 4 . 5 O A long. When they 
are aggregated, it is side by side association rather than 
end to end. 

5 . The density of dehydrated gluten is 1.291 g./c.c. 

6 . The degree of hydration of the gluten particles is 


probably not great

APPENDIX I 


During the foregoing investigation, it became of 
interest to see if the dispersing power of sodium salicylate 
for gluten could be correlated with any of the structural 
features of the molecule or with any of the known properties 
of the groups attached to the benzene ring* Therefore a small 
experiment was set up to test the dispersing power of analogs 
of sodium salicylate, particularly sodium salts of organic 
acids. The method was as follows* 

The gluten from 10 g* of ether-extracted flour was 
torn into small pieces and placed in 100 cc. of a .7 M solution 
of the reagent under test. In cases where the solubility of 
the substance was low, a saturated solution was used. After 
allowing dispersion to proceed for 3 days with occasional gentle 
shaking of the flask, the undispersed gluten was centrifuged 
off and aliquots of the supernatant dispersion were taken for 
nitrogen analysis. The nitrogen content of the solution was 
then taken as a measure of the dispersing power of the reagent 
at the concentration named. In cases where the reagent itself 
contained nitrogen, the calculated amount of nitrogen in the 
original solution was subtracted from the final concentration. 
Determinations of pH were made on all dispersions in order to 
estimate the effect of the H + concentrations. The results are 


listed in Table I

It is evident that the majority of reagents suppressed 
dispersion but a few definitely encouraged it. These were, in 
addition to sodium salicylate itself, sodium benzoate, 
sodium o-methoxy benzoate, sodium picrate, sodium oleate, 
sucrose, dextrose, maltose, sodium p—nitro—benzoate, gallic 
acid and sodium sulfanilate. It seems to be significant that

most of the reagents promoting dispersion have a highly polar 
group in close proximity to a carboxyl radical. It may be 
that the carboxyl and polar groups are capable of forming a 
ring structure involving hydrogen bonds with groups on the 
protein molecule such as the carboxyl and amino radicals of the 
constituent amino acids. Such a combination may be formed in 
place of similar linkages between constituent amino acids and 
thus may break the bonds holding molecules together. This cannot 
be the whole story, however, as shown by the effectiveness of 
sodium oleate and the sugars. It is felt that these observations 
justify an attempt at confirmation or extension of the data in 


the future

APPENDIX II 


After the removal of the molecularly dispersed 
fraction of gluten according to the method of McCalla and 
Gral'en, the remaining non-gluten nitrogenous material was 
precipitated by dialysis of the solutions against watero This 
flocculent precipitate was then washed with water and redis¬ 
persed in 0*5 p sodium salicylate* Electrophoretic patterns 
were obtained on it as a matter of general interest* Typical 
patterns are shown in Pig* 1* The very small peaks are due 
to the low concentrations made necessary by the small amounts 
of material available* 

These patterns show that this non-gluten material 
is heterogeneous in nature and probably represents a mixture 
of fragments* That the fragments are still relatively large 
is shown by their insolubility in water and their retention 
by the collodion membrane* Not the least important fact 
brought out by these patterns is that even in 0*5 sodium 
salicylate, definite components are not suppressed completely*
