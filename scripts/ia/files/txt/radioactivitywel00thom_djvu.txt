A coincidence scintillation counter* using & terphenyl 
crystal phosphor and 9JIA photomultiplier t vhm- % to® constructed 
to be used as the detecting instrument in radioactivity mil 
logging* It was hoped that it would. prove at least m mu iiiive 
».s the Ionisation chanter detector now common ly used. If this 
hop# could b@ realised, its shorter sensitive length votild provide 
a acre precia© location of 'strata.* 

fh® investigation showed, however, that this iactrunent 
has not a high enough sensitivity for $amesa~r&y well luffing* 
fh® efficiency could possibly he Improved by the t&« ©f another 
crystal and tube coaht nation* Bn® to the ©ggretal phosphor need, 
the efficiency of the counter drop® off at high t capers tores* 
m that at 60°S the taapanae to cobalt 60 radiation is only l/6 
of that at 5°C* Since the tmp&Tutvuec encountered in a borehole 
»y he m high amlfBrG it would he neceeeary to nm a crystal 
which is not tcnperatiMP* derread«it* or to ;.-rovide .. me&n® of

In the production of oil fro® a well it is desirable to have 
as much Info met ion about the gub- surface strata a.® Is economically 
possible* If It were possible to obtain ait accurate driller** log 
or economically sound to take cores at all depths* the need for 
further data would be much decreased* But such is sot the case* 
Driller*® logs are inaccurate in that there is a time lag between the 
moment the bit cuts into a stratum and the time the cuttings are 
received at the surface. Beside® this# It is not always easy to 
interpret the cuttings with certainty. Goring 1« mn oxponsivo and time 
consuming procedure* Ivon if cores could be obtained cheaply, it 
is often not possible to obtain all the cores in their proper 
relative position# In certain types of rock the cores may be 
disintegrated by the drilling fluid* and cannot he recovered intact. 

The information provided by the driller*® log* or by occasional 
ceres* must be sup- lamented by other methods, especially for 
accurate location of the different strata* Ilectriced logging and 
radioactivity logging are the two methods in mmt general use. The 
electrical method depends on a measurement of tha resistivity of 
the surround lag rock* and the spontaneous, potential developed in the 
borehole* It cannot h& done after the casing has been mi in the hole, 
or If highly conductive liQt3i.de are present. It is is these cases in 
particular that radioactivity logging has proved its v-loe.

A difficulty encountered with the scintillation counter is 
the dark current noise in the photomultiplier tube. The electrode 
surfaces, having a low work function, as is necessary for good 
sensitivity to light and electron bombardment, release a few 
thermo elec irons even when no light 1 incident up on them. Only- 
dark current pulses due to emission from the cathode are fully 
amplified, and affect the counting circuit. The number of dark 
current pulses varies from tube to tube, but is somewhere in 
the region of 10,000 to 100,000 counts per second (6).

There are a number of photomultiplier tubes on the market. 

Table I (?) is a table of the more frequently used tubes with their 
main characteristics. The main points to be considered in the 
choice of a photomultiplier tube are its spectral response, dark 
current noise, and aopll floation factor. A point to be considered 
is that all tubes of one type have not necessarily identical 
characteristics. Due to the sensitive nature of the tubes, it 
would be very difficult and cos-tly to insure that all were 
identical.

Table II (8,9*ID) is a table of the more common crystal 
phosphors available with their main characteristics. Table III (li) 
is a table of the more recent liquid phosphors with the one

not hinder the i n terprotot i on of the log# $he word tag used is 
somewhat sttbl geests, since the meaning, of the word ^sensitivity* 
is not defined. ^Sensitivity 1 *, as Russell nets it, sust mean the 
amplifloation applied to the ionisation current fluctuations, 
since it would not be possible to change the pressure or volume 
of an ionisation chamber &t the bottom, of a well by merely torn-

the statistical fluctuation® are also amplified by a corresponding

When the response curve for cosmic rays in corrected for the 
accidental coincidence background (which beeofr.es '•■orecl&bi© at 
the higher temperatures) the response decreases by t- factor of 
about l/6 over the to* aerator© range concerned, in agree.: ant with 
the result for the cobalt 60 source* 

It should be noted that the tenperattire* shown In Figure 10

The stability of the Instrument is of importance, so a study
