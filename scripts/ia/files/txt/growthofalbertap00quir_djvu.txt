ABSTRACT 


Growth of the Alberta Petroleum Producing Industry, 1947 - 1952, An 

Income-Expenditure Analysis 

This thesis is an analysis of the sources of funds and cash expenditures 
of the Alberta petroleum producing industry for the years 1947 to 1952. Ex¬ 
penditures and sources of funds have been allocated to geographical areas 
including Alberta, the rest of Canada, and foreign countries. Expenditures 
have also been analysed by technological function and sources of funds by 
type of investment. 

The method employed in estimating expenditures involves application of 
unit cost estimates to available statistics of activity in physical terms. The 
geographic analysis of expenditures is based upon content of the unit cost 
estimates. An estimate of working capital requirements, based on expend¬ 
itures, has been used to derive total funds required. Estimates were then 
made of the way in which these were supplied, on the basis of published fin¬ 
ancial statistics for publicly-owned companies and a variety of other sources. 

The principal conclusions relate to geographic expenditure patterns and 
sources of funds. It is estimated that the proportion of expenditures remain¬ 
ing in Alberta rose from 48.5 percent in 1947 to 61.8 percent in 1952. Ex¬ 
penditures in other parts of Canada dropped from 19.5 percent in 1947 to 
13.0 percent in 1952, and expenditures in foreign countries also dropped from 
32.0 percent in 1947 to 25.2 percent in 1952. 

With regard to sources of funds, these estimates indicate that Canadian 
sources supplied, in the first instan.ce, over 50% of the required capital funds 
for the industry in every year studied except 1948. It is suggested, however, 
that majority ownership has passed outside Canada through secondary trans¬ 


actions .

ABSTRACT (continued) 


Additional conclusions relate to the level of producing costs in Alberta 
and elsewhere, and to the primary income effect generated within Alberta 
and within Canada by the growth of this industry. It is estimated that within 
Alberta, primary income generated by the petroleum producing industry rose 
from 1.7 percent of personal income in 1947 to 17.8 percent in 1952.

CHAPTER 1 

INTRODUCTION 

An outstanding feature of the postwar Alberta economy has been the 
growth of the crude petroleum and natural gas producing industry. The full 
impact of this growth on the economy has yet to be analyzed. However, it 
raised the value of Alberta l s mineral production threefold from 1946 to 1952, 
from $60 million to $197 million. While this growth has been spectacular, 
the basically agricultural character of the Alberta economy is indicated by a 
comparison of production statistics. Relative growth of the two industries 
is shown in Table 1.

1952 506,660 145,774 

Percentage Increase 1946-52 80% 578% 


Value of production statistics do not give the entire picture, however, 
since the oil and gas producing industry is in a substantial cash deficit pos¬ 
ition at the present time, and, during the period under review, expenditures 
have exceeded the value of production in any given year. 

(1) Dominion Bureau of Statistics, Canada Year Book, various issues. A 

change in the method of valuing natural gas production in 1949 and subsequent 
years probably results in overstating the 1946 and 1948 figures by some 
$ 6, 000 ,000 per year.

vestment in housing end in other industries which has been brought about by 
the expansion of the producing industry. Such an estimate would require an 
exhaustive examination of the province^ "National Income 11 and its compos¬ 
ition, much of the background for which is lacking. 

One of the items needed as background data for such a study is a reliable 
series of estimates of the direct expenditures of the petroleum producing in* 
dustry and the pattern of these expenditures. The estimates listed in Table 2 
fall short of requirements in several respects, although they are more or 
less adequate as a measure of tho collective effort of the industry* 

The first defect of the estimates is that they are incomplete. From the 
author T s personal acquaintance with the data that went into some of the est¬ 
imates, breakdowns of some of the ethers as published, and comparisons with 
the remaining estimates, it appears that none of the estimates includes any 
provision for cash disbursements of the type referred to as "financial" in 
this study, including such items as Federal Income Taxes, interest and div- 

4 

idend payments, debt retirements, etc. The magnitude of this omission will 
be noted later. 

Another major drawback in the use of the published estimates as a yard¬ 
stick for determining the effect of the expansion of this particular industry 
on the provincial economy, is their failure to differentiate between payments 
made to owners of the factors of production residing in Alberta and those re¬ 
siding elsewhere. Obviously, only the dollars paid to residents of the prov¬ 
ince have added to its wealth. 

Sven as an index of the industry’s efforts in finding and developing oil 
and gas. the estimates are not ns tiseful ar one might wish, Fxcept for the 
Provincial Bureau of Statistics* estimates, component items lose their

significance by being buried in aggregates so all-inclusive as to be virtually 
meaningless. The provincial Bureau 1 ® figures cover too short a period, and 
for the early years at least, their precision is more apparent than real, for 
close examination of the figures reveals a number of inconsistencies which 
are probably due to the use of loose definitions in the questionnaire. 

This study is an attempt to supply the required data in a form which 
makes it more useable for any of the above purposes. It covers all types of 
expenditures, including "financial" payments as mentioned above, and breaks 
these down functionally and geographically. The functional analysis provides 
a yardstick of the industry's efforts and affords some interesting comparisons 
with expenditure patterns in the United States. The geographical analysis is 
cf more interest to the economist interested in Alberta's economic develop¬ 
ment. This breakdown divides expenditures into those paid to residents of 
Alberta, the rest of Canada, and foreign countries. Additional data presented 
cover the geographical sources of the funds spent by the industry. 

It should be noted that the estimates presented in this study include only 
the petroleum and natural gas producing industry. For the sake of simplicity, 
"petroleum" will be used, in the rest of this study, to denote both crude oil 
and natural gas, while the terms "crude oil", "oil", "natural gas", and "gas" 
refer only to the specified substance. None of the above estimates includes 
expenditures made on pipelines or refineries. Industry practise, which is 
followed by most writers discussing the industry and in this study, is to con¬ 
sider the petroleum industry as being composed of four branches, as follows: 

1. Producin g includes that part of the flow of petroleum from its natural 
underground reservoirs into the consumer's gas tank or furnace 
which takes place prior to the sale of petroleum in the field to a

gathering system or pipeline. In other words, it deals with the find¬ 
ing of new supplies of petroleum and their removal from the ground. 

2. Manufacturing involves the refining of crude petroleum into finished 
products. 

3. Marketing includes those steps in the chain by which finished prod¬ 
ucts are distributed to consumers. 

4. transportation involves the transmission of crude from the field to 
the refinery and products from the refinery to market outlets. The 
oil industry differs from most others in that it uses highly special¬ 
ized transportation facilities which have no alternative uses, and it 
has become customary to treat these as part of the petroleum 
industry. 

In this study, gas conservation plants and their related gathering systems 
are considered as part of the producing portion of the industry rather than as 
manufacturing operations. Under existing conservation regulations, oil 
cannot be produced without conservation of gas, if the Oil and Gas Conserva¬ 
tion Board (7) deems it desirable and so orders. This being the case, such 
plants must be regarded as producing facilities. This treatment differs from 
that of the Provincial Bureau of Statistics, but is in accord with the reason¬ 
ing of the Department of National Revenue. 

The estimates presented here are based on available statistics on costs 
and physical activity. In some cases the data are rather sketchy and the 
estimates are quite conjectural. While it is believed that they are as ac¬ 
curate as most of the others which have been published, their justification

lies in their completeness and in the analyses presented rather than in super¬ 
ior accuracy* Details of the calculation of estimates from statistics of in¬ 
dustry activity are shown in the appendices. Some of the figures have been 
taken directly from published sources, 

For purposes of this analysis, we have tried to estimate flows of cash 
between five sectors, as follows: 

I, Oil producing companies operating within Alberta 

II, "Service companies" operating within Alberta 

III, The rest of Alberta 

IV, The rest of Canada 

V, Foreign countries. 

Oil producing companies operating within Alberta include many companies 
which also operate in other provinces and the producing departments of soma 
vertically integrated companies which carry on refining and marketing oper¬ 
ations in Alberta and the rest of Canada. None of these companies publishes 
accounts in sufficiently detailed form to segregate expenditures by area or 
function. One virtue of the estimating procedure v.sed is that we are able 
to get behind the published figures and see approximately what expenditures 
were in Alberta alone. In cases of this kind, we have assumed, in effect, 
that Alberta producing operations were carried on by separate companies* 

"Service companies" are those companies which supply contract services 
such as contract drilling, coring, drillstem testing, directional drilling as¬ 
sistance, geophysical surveying, electric logging, cementing, technical 
consulting and a host of others to the oil producing companies. Some pro¬ 
ducing companies supply those services to themselves through company- 
owned drilling rigs or seismic equipment. For convenience in exposition. 














7* 

we have assumed that all drilling and geophysical work was done by separate 
companies. Such expenditures are included in the second Sector. Similarly, 
some service companies, particularly drilling contractors, have more or 
less extensive producing operations. These operations are included in the 
first Sector. Thus, some of the cash flows between oil companies and service 
companies really represent intra-company flows. 

Cash inflows from the sale of crude also in many cases represent intra- 
company transactions. It is felt that this approach is essential to isolate 
the impact of the expansion of the producing portion of the industry. 

Of the five Sectors listed, only the first two have any responsibility for 
expenditures within the province. The other sectors have acted as sources 
of funds, both as purchasers of crude and as investors. All expenditures 
made by the first two sectors eventually find their way into one of the last 
three. Only that portion finally coming to rest in the third Sector represents 
incremental income to Albertans. 

Estimates of expenditures were first of all constructed for the first 
Sector (oil producing companies) on a functional basis. The six functional 
classifications used were as follows: 

1. Exploration expenditures - those costs incurred in the acquisition 
of mineral rights and looking for petroleum. 

2. Development expenditures - the cost of drilling development wells 
and equipping them and supplying the additional field facilities nec¬ 
essary to produce petroleum. 

3. Operating costs - the cost of taking petroleum from wells and 
operating field facilities, 

4. Administrative and overhead costs which cannot be allocated to

either exploration or development, 

5. Financial payments - includes income taxes, interest and dividend 
payments, debt retirement, and other non-operating items. 

6, Royalties - these are not usually considered as an expenditure under 
conventional accounting definitions, since title to the oil or gas is 
not taken by the producer. In reality, however, they represent a 
deferred acquisition cost and constitute one of the chief sources 

of income from the industry accruing to Albertans. 

Expenditures under these functional headings are traced as purchases of 
goods or services from the other Sectors. Purchases from the service 
companies*Sector are further traced to one of the three final Sectors giving 
a breakdown of expenditures by geographical area. 

Cash receipts have been analyzed in similar fashion. Sale of crude and 
natural gas to other Sectors accounts for a large part of the cash receipts. 
The balance is made up of capital invested by individuals or corporations 
which are included in one of the other three Sectors*

CH A PTER 2. 

EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES - SECTOR X 

As mentioned in Chapter One, expenditure estimates for this sector 
were prepared on a functional basis. At this point we will outline the com¬ 
position of the functional estimates and the classifications used, while the 
details of calculation are described more fully in the appendix to this 
Chapter, 

The functional classifications chosen agree partly with customary ac¬ 
counting practises in the industry, but have ignored the conventional dis¬ 
tinctions in the accounting classification of some items between capital 
expenditures and current expense. While such classifications are useful 
in many cases, there is such a wide range of practise between different 
companies that it is impossible to define certain items as capital or ex¬ 
pense. In addition, the peculiar problems of the industry, complicated by 
income tax regulations, have led to accounting treatment of certain classes 
of expenditures in a manner that makes comparison of the financial state¬ 
ments of oil producers (and of mining companies) to those of ordinary in¬ 
dustrial concerns misleading. Accordingly, it was felt desirable to classify 
expenditures on the basis of their technical purpose or use only. 

All expenditures include cash expenditures only and do not provide for 
depreciation, depletion, or amortization charges. This was done primarily 
to avoid any double counting, but there is such a wide variety of practises 
between companies that estimating book charges would be difficult if not 
impossible. Charges made for income tax purposes do not reflect the useful 
life of many assets, and are, to that extent, economically unrealistic.

As far as can be ascertained, improvements In efficiency have kept real 
costs down throughout the period, very close to 1947 levels in terms of 
results. This applies particularly to drilling costs, and while geophysical 
unit costs have increased, the increase is insignificant if we allow for al¬ 
tered geographical factors as more and more work is done in wilderness 
areas, and for changed techniques which provide for more detailed inter¬ 
pretation . 

Table 3 lists the estimates of functional expenditures for firms in 
Sector I. The following discussion should help to clarify the content of the 
individual items. 

The first two classes. Exploration Expenditures and Development Ex¬ 
penditures, include the bulk of the cash outlay made during the period. 

Since most companies make a practise of expensing exploration costs, pub¬ 
lished figures on capital invested per employee (1), although they indicate 
the industry to be very capital-intensive, seriously underestimate the cap¬ 
ital requirements of the industry. 

Exploratory expenditures have been the largest single functional class 
in Western Canada in the period under review. They are defined here to 
include those expenditures incurred in looking for oil or gas and in acquir¬ 
ing the right to produce them.

Land acquisition and retention costs, the first item listed under explor¬ 
ation cost 3 , include the cost of acquiring and retaining the right to drill for 
and produce petroleum from underground reservoirs. This is usually 
granted by a form of Petroleum and Natural Gas lease. Provincial Petrol¬ 
eum and Natural Gas Reservations are a form of incomplete lease giving the 
holder the right to drill but not to produce, together with an option to lease a 
portion of the block. Large sums paid for leases on proven acreage are 
included here, and while these may not be exploration costs in the strictest 
sense, they do not fit as readily into any other category. Furthermore, from 
the point of view of an individual company, this method of acquiring reserves 
is an alternative to finding one's own, through exploration, offering fewer 
risks if a somewhat lower return. Payments for leases and reservations 
may include: 

1) A bonus paid to the mineral owner for granting the lease, which may 
range from a few cents per acre in areas of unknown prospectiveness 
to several thousand dollars an acre for acreage likely to be highly 
productive. 

2) Annual rentals, sometimes called "delay rentals", paid by the oil 
company or "operator" to the mineral owner until production com¬ 
mences. 

3) A royalty payment contingent on production. Royalties may be con¬ 
sidered as a deferred acquisition cost, (Income tax authorities in 
the United States have taken the opposite view, namely, that a bonus 
payment is a prepayment of royalty). Due to their contingent nature 
and the fact that payment doesn 3 t begin until development has been 
completed, they have been treated as a separate item belcw.

Land costs have been considered to include bonus payments and rentals, 
as well as certain minor additional fees charged by the Provincial govern¬ 
ment on Crown acreage. Most mineral rights in Alberta are owned by the 
Crown, the bulk of the remainder being owned by the railways and the Hud¬ 
son's Bay Company. Details of ownership are shown in Table 4.

The Provincial government has received a larger share of the monies 
spent for this purpose than its share of the acreage would indicate, since it 
has been more successful than the other mineral owners in obtaining the 
maximum prices for its properties. In the early years of our stucty, a 
larger portion went to private mineral owners who happened to have concen¬ 
trated holdings where the first fields were found. A detailed breakdown of 
the land acquisition and retention costs shown in Table 3 will be found in 
Table A2-6 of the Appendix to this Chapter.

The second item listed under "Exploratory Expenditures® is the cost of 
geological and geophysical surveys. Besides the cost of operating the farn- 
iliar reflection seismographs seen throughout the province, it includes the 
cost of using other geophysical tools such as the refraction seismograph used 
in the foothills area for mapping deep and complex structures, gravity meters 
and magnetometers used chiefly for reconnaissance, together with a wide 
variety of geological surveys and research studies. 

Most geophysical operations are conducted by contractors who supply 
field equipment and personnel and who do the work and turn over the records 
and usually an interpretation of the results to the operator. The latter may, 
particularly if it is a large company, have its own staff of geophysicists 
examine and rework the results, Co3t of the reinterpretation and supervision 
by operating companies of contract crews working for them has been included 
in this category. While some companies operate their own crews, it has 
been assumed here that a?! geophysical work is done by contractors. In 
other words, the direct cost of having field work done, whether by a con¬ 
tractor or by the company's own geophysical department, is shown here as 
a payment for services made to the service companies in Sector II, though 
some "service companies® may be, in reality, the geophysical departments 
of operating companies. The cost of reworking and reinterpretation done by 
the companies' own staffs is, of course, shown as a direct factor payment 
from Sector I to Sectors III, IV and V. 

Some surface geological surveys are also carried out by consulting 
firms, but the proportion is much smaller and such firms have been ignored 
in an attempt to allocate the payments directly to the factors involved. 

The other principal form of geological survey which is considered as a

separate item here is structure test drilling, often referred to as core 
drilling, although no cores are taken in most cases. Exploration of this 
type, which is valuable in establishing subsurface correlations in many 
areas , is usually carried on by contractors, and payments for structure 
test drilling have been treated in the same manner as direct geophysical ex¬ 
penditures, i.e., as payments from Sector I to Sector II. 

A breakdown of the estimated cost of surveys as shown in Table 3, is 
to be found in Table A&-10cf the Appendix to this chapter. 

While geology and geophysics are quite effective in locating structures 
which might be oil reservoirs, no method has yet been devised which en¬ 
ables the location of oil or gas in the ground until a well has been drilled. 
Consequently, a large part of the cost of exploration for oil and gas still 
consists of the cost of drilling exploratory or "wildcat" wells, most of 
which prove on completion to be non-productive or "dry". Table 5 gives 
some idea of the relative proportion of successes or failures. While the 
success ratio in Canada seems to be slightly better than in the U.S. in 
the years for which data have been published, the difference is not great. 
Another factor of importance is the size of pool found by the successful 
wildcat. From what data are available on this question, it is probably 
safe to say that Canada has so far been better off in this regard(3). 


(3) Canadian data appear in The Financial Post, December 4, 1954. 

Comparable U«.S. data appear in Lahee, F.H., Exploratory Drilling 
in 1952, A.A.P.G. Bulletin, vol.37, no.6, June 1953 and annual 
June issues.

Drilling a Wildcat 11 is more costly than drilling a development well in an 
area of proven production, in that drilling must proceed more cautiously where 
not too much is known about subsurface conditions, both for safety and to en¬ 
sure the adequate testing of all prospective geological horizons. The addit¬ 
ional coring, testing, logging and supervision necessary raises costs for 
these items and transportation costs into remote areas are always greater 
for the first well than for its successors. Wildcat drilling is so expensive 
that any geological or geophysical technique that tips the odds sufficiently in 
favour of the operator is a worthwhile investment. 

As with geophysical operations, most drilling of wells, whether wildcats 
or development, is done by contractors and a small portion by rigs owned by 
the operating companies. The treatment used here for company-owned 
drilling rigs parallels that used for company-operated geophysical crews, in 
that departments performing both services are treated as separate service 
companies. That portion of the cost of drilling which would accrue to a con-

tractor is shown as a payment to Sector II, while factor payments for the 
operation of rigs are shown as expenditures by Sector II. 

It is common accounting practise in the industry to include a portion of 
overhead costs in exploration costs* As any method of allocation must be to 
some extent arbitrary, it was felt that no useful purpose would be served by 
attempting such an allocation here and administrative cost has been consider-* 
ed separately. 

Once an oilfield has been discovered, substantial further expenditures 
are necessary before production begins on a commercial scale. Develop¬ 
ment wells must be drilled, flowlines, treaters, separators and storage tanks 
installed, and office space provided for operating personnel. After a field 
has been nearly developed, and if substantial volumes of gas are produced 
along with the oil, and if the field is large enough to justify the investment, 
a gas conservation plant may be needed to treat wet gas, removing liquid 
products such as propane, butane and natural gasoline from the gas before it 
is delivered to a pipeline. In the case of a field producing wet gas only, 
such a plant must be erected before any production occurs. 

The largest single item of development cost is incurred in the drilling 
of development wells. One of the chief economic problems of the industry in 
the United States has been overdevelopment resulting from the drilling of 
more wells in a pool than required to insure drainage, and in some cases 
more wells than will ever return the operator^ investment. This problem 
has a number of causes which need not be discussed here, but it is desirable 
to mention at this point that while the problem is not wholly absent in Alberta, 
well spacing regulations of the Oil and Gas Conservation Board have reduced 
its seriousness. Besides drilling a well, certain equipment must be provided 






18 


before it can be produced. A string of tubing is necessary in each well to 
bring the oil to the surface, where a wellhead controls its flow. In many 
cases a pump is needed as the well will not flow of its own accord. Once the 
oil is above ground, it flows to a battery through a flowline. Here it may be 
processed in a separator to remove dissolved gas, a treater to break up salt 
water emulsions, and is stored awaiting delivery to the purchaser. The cost 
of these producing facilities is shown as Pumping and Lease equipment in 
Table 3. Details of the cost of such equipment will be found in Table A2-19 
of the Appendix to Chapter 2. 

As a result of the increasing emphasis placed on the conservation of oil 
and gas resources, both by the government and by responsible industry 
leaders, gasoline plants are being built in every field where they are econ¬ 
omically justified. There will be no repetition of the old Turner Valley 
practise of stripping the liquid fractions from wet gas, then burning the gas 
in flares. This practise was not only wasteful of gas but will result in mil¬ 
lions of barrels of oil being left in the ground in that field, due to the pre¬ 
mature dissipation of reservoir energy. Present regulations will not allow 
gas to be produced except for sale or if it is in solution with oil, and if the 
latter is the case, all possible care must be taken to save the gas either to 
sell or to re-inject to maintain reservoir pressures. As a result, several 
plants have been installed to conserve this gas. Only two such plants were 
completed in Alberta in the period under review. The Imperial Oil Limited 
plant at Devon handles gas from the Leduc-Woodbend field. It went into 
operation in July, 1950, and had an original capacity of 18,000 Mcf per day(5)

The second plant was built at Jumping Pound by the Shell Oil Company in 
1951, Its original capacity was 25,000 Mcf per day and it originally cost $1.5 
million (8), Expansion and addition of a sulphur recovery unit cost another 
$400,000 in 1952 (9)* In addition to the above new plants, an addition was 
made by Royalite Oil Company Limited to its Turner Valley plant in the form 
of a sulphur recovery unit installed in 1952 at a cost of $350,000 (10), Table

facilities gave the petroleum industry many of the attributes of a "sick indus¬ 
try" in the United States until stabilized by government controls in the mid- 
1930*8♦ The pattern of the industry prior to that time was one of recurrent 
feast and famine as high prices encouraged drilling which was aggravated by 
competitive ownership of pools until an over supply of crude cut prices to, or 
even (for short periods) below out-of-pocket costs. This, in turn, encouraged 
excessive producing rates in an effort to meet operating expenses, causing 
rapid depletion of existing pools, and prices rose until a new bout of drilling 
started. This has never been much of a problem in western Canada as 
demand consistently exceeded supply prior to 1950, by which time the legal 
apparatus for the prorationing of production to market demand was set up. 

Operating expenses shown here include lease and well operating expense 
and gas plant operating expense. The first of these classes includes the 
cost of pumping and measuring crude, metering gas, salt water removal and 
disposal, repairs to wells and equipment, the maintenance of lease roads. 
Municipal Property taxes, etc. 

There is one remaining category of expenditures which relates to opera¬ 
tions, but cannot be tied directly to exploration, development or operating 
expense. This includes the cost of administering the huge expansion program 
and is made up of a wide variety of overhead costs. Some capital items such 
as office buildings have been treated in the same manner as drilling rigs, and 
it has been assumed that they are all rented from "service companies" in 
Sector EL. Rental charges have been shown as a payment from Sector I to 
Sector II, while building costs are shown as a payment by Sector n to Sec¬ 
tors III, IV and V. 

Royalties paid to mineral owners are shown as a separate class of ex-

penditures, as mentioned above. This treatment is in accord with customary 
accounting practise which treats royalties paid not as an operating expense, 
but as oil belonging to the mineral owner and sold for him by the operator. 
Some leases provide the mineral owner with the option of taking royalty oil 
in kind. Royalty payments are one of the principal forms of direct benefit 
to Albertans resulting from the growth of the oil producing industry in the 
province, and will become more important as the amount of settled production 
in relation to new development increases. 

The final classification of expenditures is ‘•financial payments 11 , so called 
because they do not relate in amount directly to operations. The first class 
of these includes payments made by oil producers for the use of capital, 
namely, dividend and interest payments. Income taxes form the second 
class. These two types of payments have not been considered in other anal- 

desiraMe 

yses of spending, but are of significance, and their inclusion is in the 
overall picture. During the period under review they are not large in amount, 
but they should increase materially in the next decade as more companies 
reach a profitable stage in their operations. Their inclusion will be impera¬ 
tive in future studies. 

The estimates presented in this Chapter give a picture of the scale and 
purpose of the expenditures made by the industry during the period in which 
it grew from insignificant beginnings to become a major factor in Alberta*s 
growing industrial complex. Subsequent chapters will trace the geographic 
pattern of flow of funds into and out of the province, for the industry itself 
and for the several satellite industries which have grown up around it.

CHAPTER 3 

ALLOCATION OF SECTOR l EXPENDITURES 

In this Chapter, the functional expenditure estimates of Chapter 2 are 

traced to Sectors II, III, IV and V. Payments to Sector II are those made to 
intermediate or “service companies 9 such as drilling contractors, cementing 
companies, geophysical contractors, general contractors building plant fac¬ 
ilities, owners of office buildings leased to oil companies, etc., or to the 
equivalent departments of integrated companies. In a sense these firms are 
part of the oil industry. Payments to Sectors HI, IV and V represent pay¬ 
ments directly to residents of Alberta, other parts of Canada, or foreign 
countries, respectively. In Chapter 5, payments to Sector H are also alloc¬ 
ated to Sectors HI, IV and V. 

This distinction is made because Sector I expenditures represent cash 
expenditures from the point of view of the operating companies, while from 
the point of view of the rest of the economy, these expenditures must be con¬ 
solidated with those of the Sector H companies to give a complete picture of 
the industry*s expenditures. This aggregation is necessary if we are to 
judge the economic impact of the growth of the industry. They are kept sep¬ 
arate at this stage in order to enable certain cost comparisons, etc., which 
are more accurately made on the basis of operators 1 expenditures. 

Table 7 summarizes the resulting aUocation of expenditures by operating 
companies, while Tables 8 to 13 give a more detailed breakdown, item by 
item, and year by year. In general, the method used was to determine the 
percentage breakdown of each class of functional payments. These percent¬ 
ages were then applied to the estimates of the latter to determine their al-

CHAPTER 4 


30 


SOURCES OF FUNDS - SECTOR I 

The enormous expenditures outlined in Chapter 2 necessitated 
large capital imports into the Province* It is the purpose of this 
Chapter to examin ? the sources of the funds expended by the industry, 
in order to determine what portion was financed from earnings, how 
the balance was financed, and from where the funds came. 

In addition to the actual expenditures made by the industry, 
funds were needed to provide the working capital standing behind the 
expenditures. The relationship between expenditures and cash 
requirements can be stated briefly as follows: 

Cash Expenditures PLUS Additions to Working Capital 

= Cash Requirements 

Unfortunately, little information on working capital needs is 
available, except for the balance sheets of a few companies, which 
show so much variability from year to year that they do not yield 
any worthwhile generalizations. Any estimate should also take 
cognizance of the wording balances held by parent companies outside 
the province to support Alberta operations. These do not, however, 
represent a cash inflow in the Province until actually spent here. 
Because of the lack of information in this matter, it was necessary 
to estimate, arbitrarily, that at each year end the industry as a 
whole held sufficient balances to finance one-half of the next year's 
expenditures. While this estimate seems large at first glance in 
relation to the "six weeks' expenditures" rule-of-thumb applying to 
public utilities and the slightly larger requirement of manufacturing

companies, it must be remembered that during this period a great 
many of the oil companies in Alberta were active only as explorers 
and had no source of funds other than the capital markets* Such 
firms would generally not, because of the expense and inconvenience 
attached to small, frequent security issues have recourse to the 
market more than once or twice a year at most. 

Viewed in this light the assumption appears more reason¬ 
able, and, while it must be emphasized that the estimate is purely 
arbitrary, it is felt that the inclusion of such an estimate, which 
appears to fit in quite well with the apparent pattern of financing, 
gives a more realistic picture than could be obtained by ignoring 
the working capital factor entirely. There is only one year, 1950* 
for which the results suggest that the assumption may be out of line, 
and in this case it appears that the six months 1 allowance is 
inadequate. 

The principal sources of funds available to the Alberta 
petroleum industry during this period were : 

1. Income from the sale of crude oil, natural gas, 
and other products. 

2. Bank Loans. 

3. Money borrowed through the issue of bonds, debentures 
and other debt instruments. 

4. Sale of foreign assets held by the companies. 

5. Equity funds advanced by shareholders either by 
subscription to new share issues or through direct 
investment by parent companies. Several minor mis-

cellaneous sources of £unds are also included in this group. 

In estimating the amount obtained from each source, equity 
investment has been treated as a residual, that is* amounts 
obtained from the first four sources above have been estimated 
separately and deducted from total capital requirements to 
determine the amount of equity investment. 

Table 14 illustrates the calculation of total funds required.

Bank loans to oil producers were not a very large source of funds, 

particularly in these early years of development. Part of the reason for 
this is the early unfamiliarity of bankers with oil financing problems, and 
their hesitancy to assume the risks of an inherently speculative business.

However, the banks eagerly sought production loan business in the later 
years covered by this study, and the relatively small amount of net 
borrowing seems to indicate that bank financing was regarded by most 
managements as a temporary source of f : unds to be used until 
requirements could be determined more accurately and a bond issue floated 
Many of the oil company bond issues, incidentally, were bought by the bank 
who preferred to get into the field of medium term loans in this way. 

Total net bank borrowings as estimated from published financial data, are 
shown in Table 16,

The use of bonds, notes and debentures to raise funds 
was more substantial, particularly in 1950-51 when development of 
proven reserves in the Bedwater field was proceeding rapidly. Many 
of these issues carried stock bonuses or conversion privileges to 

11 sweeten 1 11 them for investors. In a number of companies floated during 
this period, the par value of bonds represented the total capitaliza¬ 
tion. Our statistics on borrowing apply to the smaller, non-integrate d 
"independent" companies. Borrowings by foreign major companies we re

It is best to regard all investments by these companies as being in the 
category of "direct" investment in Canadian subsidiaries or divisions* 
The only Canadian major investing heavily in Alberta during this 
period did raise funds in the bond market but also raised equity capital 
via a common stock issue and sold some producing subsidiaries during 
the period. It has been assumed that this source provided the funds 
for much of the company 1 s development program, while the balance is 
treated as direct investment by an Eastern Canadian company in Alberta 
development* 

Table 17 shows the estimated indebtedness incurred by 
the industry during the period 1947-52, Included as funded debt are 

small amounts for mortgages on office buildings and privately-raised 
loans* To present a more accurate picture of the amounts raised in 
this manner, the amount of debt reduced by conversion into equity 

investment through the exercise of conversion privileges is also noted*

As mentioned above, one Canadian major. Imperial Oil 
Limited, did a considerable portion of its financing by selling assets, 
particularly two subsidiaries, one foreign and one domestic. These 
two sales brought new capital into the industry and will be treated 
as such. Imperial sold other subsidiaries and certain fixed assets to 
two other operating companies. These sales did not affect industry 
totals, hence can be ignored in our analysis. Table 18 shows funds 
received through the sale of assets.

Other forms of equity investment supplied the balance 

of the required funds. Table 19 shows the apparent extent of equity 

investment behind the expansion. The figures in this table were obtained 

by deducting estimates of funds from other sources (Tables 15-18) 

from estimated requirements (Table 14)

The apparent equity investment may be broken down still 


further, into that portion raised by sales of shares or conversion of 
bonds and a portion composed mainly of direct investment by parent 
firms. That portion of indebtedness converted to stock has been treated 
as a separate transaction, in which the bond is redeemed and the 
investor re-commits the funds in shares of the company. In many cases 
this is very close to what did happen, as companies gave notice of

redemption of convertible issues, hastening their conversion. For 
this reason, conversions were deducted from borrowings in Table 17 
to give a net picture. They are included in Table 21 f s tabulation 
of equity investments. 

Table 21 lists equity investments by types for the 
years under review. In this tabulation, the total for share issues was 
obtained by a study of available financial statistics for over 400 
publicly held companies which were active in Alberta during this period. 
Adjustments were made for investment elsewhere by these companies 
and it is believed that the resulting figures present as accurate 
a picture as is possible of the equity funds committed to oil 
production in Alberta by this group of companies during the years under 
discussion. The amount of conversions mentioned in the last paragraph

residual for total equity investment (see Table M9) and is the least 
reliable estimate for any source of cash. This residual has at least 
five components, including the following, in estimated order of importance.

Direct investment by Canadian integrated companies, not 
accounted for above. 

(3) Investment by privately~held companies and by individuals, 
believed to be slight. 

(4) Deep test well credits allowed by the Federal Government as 
a credit against taxes payable. These may be regarded as a 
form of exploratory expenditure by the Federal Government, 
and were not provided for in the income tax estimates of 
Chapter 2. 

(5) Involuntary equity contributions made by the creditors of a 
handful of bankrupt companies. 

It will be noted that the residual item drops very low in 1950. 
This may be due to most foreign investment that year being channelled 
into pipeline construction, as well as to an underestimate of the 
increase in working capital. The tremendous upsurge in share issues 
and bond issues during the year suggests that working capital did, in 
fact, increase substantially more than the $19 million estimated. 

For the sake of comparison. Table 22 presents D.B.S. statistics 

on the extent of U.S. direct investment in all phases of the industry.

As all of the prairie provinces generate a surplus of 
loanable funds within the chartered banks, it is safe to assume that bank 
loans to the industry were financed entirely from savings arising within the 
province* 

In raising funds for exploration and development through the 
sale of bonds, Canadian independent companies have been forced to rely 
to a considerable extent on the Canadian bond market. The expense of 
S a B*C* registration and the unfamiliarity of the American bond-buying 

public with Canadian oil producers of merit were no doubt strong 
contributing factors. A careful search indicates only four bond 
issues sold in the U.S* by Alberta independents during this period, 
all of which were placed with institutional buyers* There have been a 

great many more since 1952, and no doubt a good many i: second-hand"

bonds have crossed the border. Sales of new bond issues in the 

U.S, by Alberta producers totalled $8,699,000 in 1950 and $1,723,000i<n 

1952. 

Splitting the balance of the bond issues between Alberta and 
the rest of Canada is a more difficult task. Nearly all the under¬ 
writing was done by Toronto bond houses and a large portion was 
taken by institutional buyers including banks and insurance companies. 
An arbitrary allowance of ten percent was made to allow for those 
bonds held directly or indirectly by Albertans. Table 24 indicates 

the estimated sources of borrowed funds.

Sources of the funds raised by the sale of assets can be more 
accurately determined. Two such sales took place. The first involved 
the sale by Imperial Oil Limited of its former South American subsidiary* 
International Petroleum Co. Ltd. to its shareholders following an 
issue of rights in 1948, As almost 70% of Imperials stock is owned by 
the Standard Oil Company (N.J.) and private American holdings probably 
account for another 10%, it appears likely that at least 80% of the

funds raised by tnis transaction came from the United States. Of 
the remaining 20% of funds, it was assumed that 10% (or 2% of the 
total) came from Alberta. 

The second sale was that of the former Alberta producing 
subsidiary, Koyalite Oil Co. Ltd. Through a Toronto underwriting group 
in 1949. It was also assumed that 10% of this stock was bought in 
Alberta. Table 25 summarizes the geographical pattern of this source 
of financing.

An attempt has been made to trace the source of equity funds in 
a similar manner. Table 26 analyses the source of funds from new 
stock issues. These were estimated from actual data appearing in the 
Financial Posts "Survey of Oils". In this instance, the extent of U.S. 
ownership is understated since many securities issued originally in 
Canada were acquired later by American and other foreign investors. 
Data in the table relate to new issues only as determined from details 
of underwriting houses, etc. No attempt is made to account for actual 
ownership, as determined by subsequent purchases and sales.

Analysis of the debenture issues converted revealed that only one of 
the converted issues was held in the U.S., conversions in this case totalling 

i 

$234,000 in 1952. The balance were Canadian-held and were assumed to be 
split 10% in Alberta and 90% in other provinces. 

tt Residual a investment, including direct investment by foreign and 
eastern firms, private companies, tax credits and liabilities of bankrupt 
firms (5) has been divided between Sectors as shown in Table 27. The basis 
for this allocation is an estimate of U.S, direct investment from the balance 
of payments statistics (6).

CHAPTER 5 


The Service Company Account (Sector II) 

This Chapter presents expenditure estimates for the large group of com¬ 
panies engaged in miscellaneous activities which have been previously clas¬ 
sified as n service companies n . Payments to these companies, aggregated 
in Sector II in the analysis of Chapter 3, are now allocated to the other Sec¬ 
tors, along with estimated capital expenditures by the companies. Data on 
sources of funds are also presented. 

Firms in this category include the following: 

Geophysical Contractors 
Drilling Contractors 

Well cementing, testing and servicing companies 
Geological, geophysical, engineering and management consultants 
General contractors engaged in oilfield construction 
Investors owning office buildings occupied by oil companies 
This group includes not only separate firms as listed above, but geo¬ 
physical, drilling and real estate departments of integrated companies which 
operate their own seismic crews or drilling rigs or own their own office 
buildings. 

Table 29 presents income data for Sector II companies, outlining the 
services for which payment was received.

Operating expenses of this group have been estimated as shown in 
Table 30. Very briefly, the method employed was to estimate operating ex¬ 
penses for each class of firms on the basis of available data. These were 
in turn analyzed to determine their geographical allocation. Some remarks 
should be made at this point concerning the treatment of depreciation. All 
non-cash charges were expressly excluded from consideration in our anal¬ 
ysis of Sector I expenditures. However, the cash expenditures by Sector I, 
which become revenue to Sector II, also cover non-cash expense items of 
the Sector II companies. Thus, while depreciation is a non-cash item for 
service companies, it is a cash outflow for operators, and cash must be 
found from some source to meet this requirement. It should also be noted 
that while depreciation is a source of funds for Sector II companies, the 
geographic 11 source is Sector I, and it may be more easily regarded as a

non-expenditure of cash received. To include it as a separata source of funds 
would involve a double-counting of this amount, as it is not raised from out¬ 
side the industry and the required amount has already been accounted for in 
analyzing the sources of funds for Sector I. 

A detailed discussion of the methods used in estimating and allocating 
both sources and expenditures of funds by Sector II companies may be found 
in the Appendix to Chapter 5.

Capital Expenditures by this group of companies are estimated in

the largest cash flows to Sector V, as during this period virtually all special 
oilfield equipment was imported.

CHAPTER 6 

This study, up to this point, has been concerned with the details of sector- 
by-sector estimates of receipts and expenditures. Interpretation of such es¬ 
timates has been avoided. It is now time to bring the estimates together so as 
to construct a unified picture to see what tentative conclusions, if any, are 
discernible from them. 

Tables 33 to 38 are consolidating tables. They bring together the estim¬ 
ates that have been made, and present at a glance the pattern of cash flows 
from sector to sector, year by year. 

A number of inferences can be drawn from these tables, some directly, 
some after further analysis. An obvious inference is, of course, the extent 
to which the industry grew during this period. As indicated in Chapter 1 (1) 
for a pioneer period such as that under review, expenditures give a more ac¬ 
curate picture of growth than production statistics, owing to the extent capital 
expenditures do not reflect themselves immediately in production increases. 
During the 1947-1952 period, annual expenditures by the industry grew from 
$33,296,000 to $272,809,000, an increase of approximately 700 percent in 
in six years. The organizational and administrative problems involved in 
growth at this rate are of a nature seldom found outside of a total war economy. 
Such growth would have been impossible without imports of capital, special¬ 
ized equipment and skilled technical personnel. The level of apparent efficiency- 
maintained during the expansion, as illustrated by the industry^ cost experience, 
is a tribute not only to the flexibility of private enterprise but to the foresight 
of government officials responsible for regulation of the industry. Mistakes 
were made but they were of a minor nature in comparison with the enormity

There are matters of equal or greater interest which are 
within its scope, however* The primary purpose of this study has been 
to establish the basic data on which further studies may be based. As 
an indication of the lines further studies might take:, some analysis 
of the data has been undertaken. This analysis has been along three 
basic lines. 

(a) What data of interest appear from the figures themselves ? 
for example, how did the proportions of expenditure 
devoted to exploration, development, etc® vary and why ? 
Where did the money come from ? How much passed 
through the hands of Albertans ? 

(b) What were average operating costs in this period ? How 
do they compare with those in the U,S,, or in Canada 
since 1952 ? What are the differences between costs 

of acquiring new reserves in Canada and in the U.S. ? 

How can these be explained ? 

(c) What were the effects on Alberta’s economy ? On the 
Economy of Canada ? A complete analysis of these 
questions is again beyond the scope of this thesis 

but some partial answers can be provided. 

Returning to the*first line of inquiry outlined above, 
table 39 shows the proportions of expenditures devoted to various 


functions for 1947 - 52 d

Examination of this table indicates that it is merely a reflection 
of history, and is explainable easily on the basis of events. It is of 
no value in explaining the relationships. The increase intending on 
exploration 1947-49 is a result of a large number of new entries 
into the industry. These had no crude and had to go looking for it, 
reducing the proportion of funds available for other purposes. Boom¬ 
like development of the Redwater field, starting in earnest in 1949 
and virtually complete by December 1951 reversed this trend. 1952 
saw some shift back into exploration as discovery of the Wizard 
Lake-Bonnie Glen reef trend sparked an exploratory "play" in the 
deeper basin area south and west of Leduc. The ups and downs in 
the share of operating cost and royalties merely indicates the extent 
to which production kept pace with or lagged behind expenditures. 

taxes 

Changes in "financial" expenditures reflect mostly the lag in income / 
as write-offs of exploratory costs reduced tax liabilities. Financial 

payments in the earlier years are related to the pre-1947 level of 
activity. The decrease in percentage after 1947 is due to the rise 
in other expenditures.

These figures illustrate the extent to which the local industry 
was dependent on the U,S« for equipment and services during these 
early years* Much of the apparent fluctuation in the shares spent 
in other parts of Canada and abroad is due to variations in the share 
of expenditure accruing to landholders in Alberta, principally the 
Crown, in bonuses, rentals and royalties. This item varied as follows:

If we cV.-.-reciotfecm the influence of this variable by taking 
amounts spent in the three geographical areas exclusive of the above land 


costs as percentages of total spending less payments to Alberta land¬ 


owners, a different picture emerges. This is shown in Table 41*

The figures in table 41 indicate very little change in the 
perce age of expenditures going abroad, with a modest increase in 
the s ipxeoi expenditures going to Alberta at the expense of other parts 
of Canada, 

It is difficult to pinpoint the exact reasons for this shift. Part 
of it is due to a relative decline in the importance of royalties received 
by railway companies for land in Alberta.., the rest apparently to seme 
shifts in the location of industries supplying the petroleum industry 
from Eastern Canada to Alberta or to the establishment of new 
industries in Alberta, In any case the changes were relatively minor. 
It is surprising that Canadian firms did not develop an increased share 
of this growing market over this six year period* Looking at 
developments since 1952, it seems probable that a greater percentage 
of the oil expenditure dollar remains in Canada, Casing, tubing 
line pipe, sucker rods, pumps, tanks and drilling bits 
are now made either in Alberta or the East* It is perhaps significant

that most of these new fivms are owned largely in the U.S. or Europe, 
and that established Canadian industry has been indifferent to the needs of 
this market. 

For example, out of five new firms manufacturing casing or 
line pipe, three are German-backed, one was established by Eastern 

fi rm 

Canadim steel interests and one by local capital. One additional was 
estab' "' hed in Ontario some years ago. With respect to tanks, all new 
firms .re U,S, controlled. An Edmonton firm, promoted locally, makes 
sucker rods. 

This has undoubtedly been a factor in the postwar growth of 
foreign investment in Canada, 

Let us look for a moment at sources of funds. The first 
comparison we shall males is between "current" sources, including 
sales receipts and "capital" sources including stocks, bonds, and all the 
rest. Table 42 shows this breakdown.

These figures suggest that from the outset, a substantial 
portion of required funds came from sales receipts. In view of the 
rapid growth in the industry, a larger relative contribution from capital 
sources might have been expected;

The declining importance of capital funds from 1948 to 1952 tends 
to indicate that budgets of all operators are dependent in part on 
income being earned* This is at variance with the generally accepted 
view that the major international companies regard their Canadian 
operation s as a means of assuring future supplies, that they are 
merely buying oil in the ground and are not concerned with current 
income levels. The major premise may be true but the conclusion 

seems at variance with observed facts* 

It would appear from the percentages above that capital 
expenditure budgets are related to current receipts, and that 
expenditures are only made with a view to obtaining payout in a 
reasonably short period* 

Another facet of the financing picture is illustrated in table 43* 
This table shows the types of capital investments made in the industry*

Several generalizations regarding methods of financing may be 
drawn from the above table. 

Firstly, the contribution of the chartered banks was insignificant 
in the total picture during this period. This might be expected in 
view of the underlying philosophy of the Canadian banking system which 
regard* banks as essentially a source of short term credit. Oil 
financing is generally of a medium term variety. At this time 
there was no provision in the Bank Act allowing banks to take security 
on oil in the ground. The above underestimates the role of the banks 
somewhat, as a number of banks got around the problem raised by 
the Bank Act by purchasing bonds issued by oil companies. Many 
loans were made on a short term basis, and replaced with bond issues 
at a later date. This relatively elaborate and expensive procedure 
was made unnecessary by the new Bank Act of 1954 (3), section 82 
of which enabled the direct taking of security on producing properties. 

Capital raised by the sale of bonds, which includes a portion 
raised from the banks, did not become a significant factor until 1949, 
when the industry had progressed sufficiently beyond the first waves 
of speculation to see which way it was going. In 1950 bonds 
which had either convertible features or bonus stock attached 
enjoyed a brief flurry of popularity. Most of these promotions were based 
on the development of proven properties in the Redwater field, and the 
companies 9 operations were of a less speculative nature than most 
oil companies 9 ventures. Essentially most of the 1950 bond issues

had so much speculative “sweetening” in the form of convertibility 
privileges, bonus stock, or purchase warrants, that they should be 
regarded as equity investments in nature if not in form. This is borne 
out by the rapidity with which such issues were converted (when possible) 
in subsequent years. By 1951 bonds had subsided to a position of relative 
unimportance similar to that held in 1949, Bonds have never been a 
major source of oil producing industry financing either in Canada or the 
U,S. (4) 

An unusual source of funds which appears in our table is the sale of 

assets. These transactions were discussed at some length in Chapter 

Four, above, where it was noted that these funds were raised by one 

company in two transactions whereby it disposed of one domestic and ontf 

foreign 

subsidiary to raise funds for Canadian development. It is interesting 
to compare this approach with that of other Canadian affiliates of 
international majors, which retained foreign holdings while producing 
operations in Western Canada were entrusted to newly-formed subsidiaries, 
usually 100% owned by the group parent or at least a high-level holding 
company. Participation of these other Canadian majors in domestic 
production operations was relatively slight and usually in partnership with 
the producing affiliate,, 

The two chief sources of funds were public stock issues and what 
we have classed as “residual 1 * investment, of which the major component 
is direct investment by foreign firms in branch operations or wholly 
owned subsidiaries. This latter was an indispensable source of funds in 
the early years, and of consequence throughout the period. Public 

stock offerings, a major source of funds prior to 1947, were completely

unable, at first, to provide funds on the scale required by the rate of 
expansion. Their growth in importance to a position where they supplied 
the majority of funds required in 1952, attests to the potentialities of 
this source and the sometimes excessive marketability of Canadian oil 
stocks. 

Another classification of particular interest in view of the continued 
discussion of the extent of foreign ownership in Canadian industry, is that 
given in Table 44. This table shows the geographic sources of capital 
funds, including all sources of funds except sales receipts. It is concerned 
with original sources only. For example, when stock is sold originally 
to a Canadian investor, the source of funds is classified as Canadian, 
whether or not he turns around a week or five years later and sells his 
stock to a foreigner.

This table indicates that the share of capital coming from Alberta 
sources dropped slowly over the period. This does not indicate a drying 
up of local sources, but shows their inability to keep pace with the growth 
that occurred. The share supplied by other parts of Canada fell 
drastically in a relative sense in 1948, though it increased in absolute 
amount. The position was regained in 1949 and Canadian sources

supplied a good proportion of requirements until 1952, There is no 

evidence in these estimates to support the thesis that Canadian Investors 
have been unwilling to invest in development of their own country. It is, 
however, interesting to note that peak Canadian participation took place 
in 1950, the year in which "bonds'* were so popular. This does tend to 
suggest a weakness for this form of investment. One reservation might 
be added to the above comments. The above figures are based on initial 
sources of funds, and do not indicate the final resting place of securities 
in portfolios. It would be quite possible that 100% of the funds could 
come originally from Canadian sources but that control would pass 
outside Canada* This would occur if Canadian investors took their 
profits (or losses) and sold out to foreign investors. Other evidence seems 
to indicate that something like this did occur. 

Table 45 shows estimates by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics 

which show changes in the book value of foreign investment in Canada*s 
oil industry, from 1945 to 1951, These are compared with our estimate of 
the source of capital funds for the period 1947-52, Comparison of 
these two sets of figures suggests that Canadian investors did sell some 
of their holdings, enough in fact to give foreigners a majority interest.

The second line of analysis mentioned earlier in this chapter 
concerned estimated producing costs. Conventional industry practise 
includes only the first four classes of expenditures: 

(a) exploration or acquisition costs 

(b) development costs 

(c) operating costs 

(d) administration .and overhead 

To be realistic, the first two classes should be charged against 
the reserves found during the period under* consideration. Operating 
and overhead costs can be charged against barrels produced. As the 
purpose of the analysis which follows is to present data for the period 
1947-52 which are comparable to other estimates by industry sources, 
we have followed conventional practise by treating royalty production as 
never owned, hence not an expense, and will ignore financial charges. 

Table 46 indicates the physical quantities used in our estimate of 
producing costs. Gas has been ignored as it was a minor factor 
during this period. The column showing f net f production and reserves 
is calculated by subtracting royalties ataan estimated 12j% percent 
from the gross figures. Total additions to net reserves are used in 
calculating development cost. While some reserves may not be developed, 
by A.P.I. definitions, proved reserves include only a slight margin 
of undrilled acreage beyond known production. The error introduced 
into a six year estimate by the inclusion of a small quantity of 
undrilled reserves is slight,

Several factors contribute to the difference between Canadian and 
U.S, costs. Operating expenses are higher largely because of the number 
of stripper wells in older producing areas in the U.S. These costs tend 
to be more closely related to the number of wells operated rather than 
to production. When per-well production is lower, per-*barrel cost is 
higher. 


Factors contributing to differences in development cost include: 

(a) There are relatively more deep development wells 
(10,000 feet and over) drilled in the U.S. 

(b) Offshore development costs are much higher. This was not 
a large factor in the 1947-52 period but contributed. 

(c) Well spacing in the U.S. tends to be narrower. Typical 
spacing in the 1947-52 period was 10-40 acres per well . In 
Alberta it was almost universally 40 acres.

There is also a wide gap in exploratory costs* One ex¬ 
planation is that in the U.S„ the remaining oil fields are becoming 
harder to find, while in Canada technical opinion suggests that the 
bulk of the discoveries has yet to be made There is undoubtedly 

some truth to the© statements, but it seems to be also true that oil 
was easier to find in the U.S, than in Canada prior to 1947. It is thus 
doubtful whether this is an adequate explanation of the cost differential. 

A more subtle explanation lies in the relative intensity of spending 
for drilling and fcr geological and geophysical surveys. 

In 1952, Alberta operators spent $34,400,000 on exploratory 
drilling and $46,440,000 on surveys. (13) This is a ratio of $1.35 
in surveys for every dollar in drilling. In the U.S. in 1952, operators 
spent $1,217 million for exploratory drilling and $193 million on surveys, 
(14) or only $0,16 on surveys for every dollar in drilling. 

It is well known that geological and geophysical studies are an 
aid in exploration. Probably this is a more significant reason for the 
differences in exploratory costs between Alberta and the U.S. It should 
be possible to determine, from a study the statistics available for 
geophysical operations, exploratory drilling and reserves, what is an 
optimum economic program for exploring given acreage. This is again 
beyon d the scope of this study.

Perhaps the most significartt questions regarding this industry, 
to outsiders at least, are the following : 

(1) What effect has the growth of the industry had on the economy 
of Alberta ? 

C2)What effect has its growth had on the economy of Canada ? 

Some of the answers to these questions are familiar, almost to 
the point of being cliches. The industry has contributed to the 
diversification of the Alberta economy, giving the province a second "casty 
crop* 1 . It has provided employment for large numbers of people. 
Availability of Canadian crude has ” saved" Canada a lot of foreign 
exchange and helped to make the Canadian dollar go to a premium over 
its U,S. counterpart. The influx of population has contributed to the 
financial problems of the urban municipalities. Alberta has become 
a "Debt-free" province. The above statements are all true, and 
important as far as they go. Few of them have been assessed 
quantitatively, and they are all " side-effects" or, at best, only part 
of the story. 

The most all-inclusive measure of the effect would be the estimate< 
effect of the industry 1 s growth on the Gross National Product of Alberta 
and of Canada. Preparation of such an estimate would involve 
construction of econometric models of the economies in question. 
Construction of such models is beyond the scope of this thesis. It does 
provide however, the essential raw materials which, together with such 

a model, will enable calculation of income effects. 

Income effects due to any new industry or change in scale oi an 
existing one may be divided into "primary" and "secondary" effects. The 
former result directly from increased investment or changes in imports ai 
exports in the initial round of spending. Secondary effects are those

induced changes in other parts of the economy resulting from the working 
of various multipliers^ From our date, it is possible to calculate 

primary income effects. The components of primary income are as follow 

(a) Investment made by the industry. 

(b) Export sales made by the industry, 

(c) Less import content cf Industry Expenditures* 

(d) Plus imports avoided due to existence of the industry. 

These are categories correspond to these used in the national 
accounting concept “Gross National Expenditures at Market Prices’ 1 (15) 

The last cat^ory (d) needs further explanation. In 1946 Alberta 
was a net importer of petroleum and petroleum products, as was Canada. 
If the producing industry had not developed, both would have been larger 
importers in the years 1947-52. Without resort to dynamic input-output 
analysis, it is most difficult to say how much of the consumption in 
these years would have been avoided if the industry had not contributed 
to economic development and hence to consumption A further problem 
arises when we consider that Alberta had oil and gas production valued 
at $21,532,000 in 1946(15)a.In volume this was declining annually, but the 
course of prices would have been far difference if local production had 
not developed. To provide for some continuation of previous production 
and for the amount of consumption that wouldn f t have taken place if the 
industry hadn s t developed, the following arbitrary amounts have been 
chosen : (in thousands of dollars).

These amounts have been deducted from sales of products in 
Alberta and Canada in Tables 50 and 51 to provide an estimate of the 
net reduction in imports made possible by the existence of this industry 
in Alberta* 

In tables 50 and 51, both exploration and development 
expenditures have been treated as investment, together with capital 
expenditures by service companies* 

This is not in keeping with industry accounting practise, which is 
to write off exploration as an expense, but follows the national 
accounting framework of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics (16)

Tables 50 and 51 indicate primary income generated in Alberta and 
all of Canada, respectively, by the development of the Alberta petroleum pro¬ 
ducing industry. These tables take no account of induced investment in pipe¬ 
lines, refineries, etc. To this extent they fail to account for the total effect. 
It is, however, possible, even plausible, to argue that if local production did 
not become available, other means would have had to be found to supply the 
growing petroleum products market of Ontario and Western Canada. This 
would undoubtedly have meant refinery and pipeline construction, but the lo¬ 
cations would have been different. 

Table 52 compares primary income generated in Canada by all industries 
to that generated by the Alberta petroleum producing industry. This indicates 
the rate at which the local income series grew, relative to the rest of the 
economy. It shows that the growth of this industry was one of the dynamic 
factors in Canada ! s economic growth from 1947-52, and one which was be¬ 
coming of major significance for the economy as a whole.

The importance of this industry is well illustrated by the above Table. 

If account is taken of the action of the multiplier, which in Alberta is not 
large due to dependence on imports from other parts of Canada, it is clear 
that Alberta would not have shared appreciably in Canada f s postwar growth 
without it. In fact, if account is taken of price changes, real income of Al¬ 
bertans would probably have cropped over the 1947-52 period. The exact 
contribution is difficult to determine, as other industries, notably coal 
mining, suffered as a result of growth in the oil and gas industry. 

The gross income effect for Canada as a whole is probably much greater 
than for Alberta alone. Not only is primary income greater, but the multi¬ 
plier is also greater, since Canada as a whole is less dependent on imports 
and exports than is Alberta. These leakages in Alberta tend to keep invest¬ 
ment from having too great an effect on local G.N.P.

APPENDICES 


INTRODUCTORY NOTE 

The appendices which follow provide the underlying detail behind the 
aggregated estimes of Chapters 2, 3 and 5. The appendix to Chapter 2 
deals with expenditure estimates, while the appendices to Chapters 3 and 
5 deal with the allocation, between Sectors, of expenditures made by 
Sector I and Sector II, respectively. The appendices outline sources of 
basic data and discuss estimating techniques and problems which may

Expenditure Estimates - Sector I 

1. LAND ACQUISITION AND RETENTION COSTS 

This is one of the best documented items of expenditure, in that a large 
part of the monies were paid to the Crown and are recorded in the Public 
Accounts. No attempt has been made to separate acquisition from retention 
costs, as any definition must be to some extent, arbitrary. 

(a) Cost of Crown Acreag e 

Details of Provincial Government receipts are recorded in the 
Public Accounts, on the basis of the Province^ fiscal year which ends 
March 31. As there is no means of determining the flow of receipts over 
the fiscal year, figures were not adjusted but were used for the calendar 
year most closely approximating the relevant fiscal year, i.e., 1948 calen¬ 
dar year statistics shown in this study really represent receipts for the 
fiscal year ending March 31, 1949. 

National Parks are not open for oil or gas exploration and receipts 
for Indian reserve leases are believed to have been insignificant for the 
period under review, so no payments for Federally-owned acreage are con¬ 
sidered. 

Table A2-.1 shows the categories of receipts shown in the Public Ac¬ 
counts of Alberta which have been included in “Land Acquisition and Reten¬ 


tion Costs “

(b) C, P. R. Acreage 

The Canadian Pacific Railway ? s income from oil and gas properties 
was, for this period, substantially all derived from properties in Alberta. 
Receipts on Land Surplus Account are shown separately in most of the Com¬ 
pany^ Annual Reports for the years from 1949 onward. Receipts for the 
other years have been estimated on the basis of those years for which re¬ 
ceipts are known. The company : s credits to land surplus include not only 
rentals but royalties which are considered separately in this study. Suffic¬ 
ient other information is given in the reports to permit a split to be made 
by valuing royalty oil. Table A2-2 shows details of the calculation.

The Crown company's financial statements are not nearly as informative 
in this respect as the C.P.R.'s. However, the C.N.R, has much smaller 
holdings in the productive areas of Alberta, and most of its mineral holdings 
are in other provinces. On the basis of this rather sketchy information and 
examination of the items in the Company's income statement which should 
include these revenues, they are estimated in Table A2-3. While these 
statements are doubtless inaccurate, the overall total of lands' costs 
would not seriously be affected if the total were several times as great.

The Calgary and Edmonton Corporation Limited owns, in fee simple, 
the mineral rights on 1, 142, 143 acres of land formerly owned by its predec¬ 
essor companies. The Company started at an early date to lease these 
rights to other companies and to participate in the development thereof, For 
the purposes of this study, it has been assumed that these rights were free to 
the operating companies, as intercompany payments within Sector I do not 
affect our estimates of expenditures. Similar treatment has been given min¬ 
eral rights owned by smaller, similar companies such as Security Freehold 
Petroleums Ltd. 

(e) Hudson^ Bay Company Acreage 

The Hudson^ Bay Company shows its annual earnings from royalties 
and rentals in its annual report. As stated in Table 4, it owns the mineral 
rights on some 2.4 million acres in Alberta. The Hudson*s Bay Company 
also has an affiliate - Hudson f s Bay Oil and Gas Co. Ltd. - which is a pro-

The other 600, 000 acres of potentially petroliferous mineral rights 
within the province belong largely to individuals. A large portion of these 
lands lies in the general Edmonton area or along a line joining Calgary and 
Edmonton. Substantially higher returns were received by those mineral 
owners with freehold rights in "hot" areas than by corporate owners as, in 
most cases, bonuses were paid for signing leases, while corporate owners

for a nominal rentals While no details of amounts paid to individuals 
are available, total acreage holdings are know and by comparison 
with holdings of the Crown and corporate mineial owners, it is possible

Summary re Land Acquisition and Retention Costs 
Table A2~6 summarizes the estimates of land acquisition and 
retention costs appearing in Tables A2-1 to A2-5 inclusive. While many 
of the estimates for smaller mineral owners are to some extent 
questionable, the Crown figures are firmly documented and form such a 
large part of the total that any error in the others is not particularly 
significant. It should be noted at this time that these costs are for 
mineral rights only and do not include surface rentals paid on producing 
leases, which are included in operating costs.

2, COST OF GEOLOGICAL AND GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS , 

While the date published on this type of expenditure are 
incomplete a quite realistic picture can be pieced together from the 
available information* 

(a) Estimates of Physical Activity - Geophysical 

Several series of figures have been published which indicate 
the level of geophysical operations in Western Canada or in Alberta 
during the period under review* Four of these series are listed in 
Table A2-7, as published, with no adjustment for the crews which may 
have operated in provinces other than Alberta* In addition, various 
publications, such as the 11 Daily Oil Bulletin 1 ’ and "Oil in Canada^ have 
from time to time published surveys showing the number and location 
of crews operating in the Basin. These are not shown in this study, but 
confirm the series used. The Provincial Bureau of Statistics series 
purports to show "crews operating" but does not state whether this is in 
the peak number during the year, the average number, a mid-year or

year «• end figure, or merely the number of crews which held 

permits and worked in the province at some time during the year. 

Examination of the figures suggests the last interpretation. 

Most of these estimates were made by actual count, i.e., by 

surveys of operators and contracting companies, and are all probably 

more or less incomplete due to omissions. The largest figure is 

therefore likely to be the most reliable. The Canadian Petroleum 

Association statistics do not contain any estimate of the amount of aerial 

magnetometer work done. The estimates of Table A2**8 were used for 

preparing the cost figures used in this study. They were prepared on 

the basis of the series appearing in Table A2-7. Magnetometer operations 

were estimated from certain published data (5)

(b) Estimated 

Expenditures - Geophysical 



Cost experience for geophysical operations is not as well- 

documented as land or even drilling costs * However, sufficient data has 

been published to allow estimating total costs and their composition with a 

reasonable degree of accuracy* The only complete series of costs 

published is the Canadian Petroleum Associations estimate, but other 

figures, published from time to time, offer corroboration. The Provincial 

Bureau of Statistics* figures purport to represent the total expenditures 

made by the industry. On a crew-month basis, they appear to conflict 

with one another for the available years. It would appear that imprecise 

definitions on the questionnaire resulted in different interpretations being 

used by the different operators and improper inclusion of other expenditure* 

under the heading "exploration,” This unfortunately casts doubt on the 

reliability of the Provincial Bureau* s expenditure figures, and they have 

been used only where corroborated by other evidence. Since the 1951-52 

questionnaire this condition has been largely remedied and future figures • 

will doubtless be more reliable. Table A2-9 lists the estimated unit costs 

which were used in the preparation of cost estimates for this study. The 

Canadian Petroleum Association series is the only one which gives a 
breakdown for all types of operations.

(c) Geological operations and expenditures 




KSach less detailed publicity has been given geological surveying 
operations than geophysical* However, an estimate of the total geological 
activity has been published and this has been separated between surface 
parties and structure test drilling on the basis of other published figures*. 
Estimates of geological activity by types are listed in Table A2-12* These have 
been used in preparing the cost estimates shown in Table A2-13*

H Developments in Western Canada in 1951” A. A, P. G, Bulletin 
June 1952, p,1260 

It is estimated that structure testing drilling crews cost about 

$12,000,00 per month to keep in the field (I), This figure is the basis of 

the cost estimate used in this study. 

Surface geological parties range in size from small affairs 

consisting of two men and a mule to more elaborately staffed safaris 

supplied by airplane and helicopter. Both these types are in a minority, 

however, and the typical party is composed of four or five men and costs 
some $5,000,00 per month to operate. 


(1) While no data on structure test drilling costs in Canada appears 
to have been published, this average figure is an estimate based 
on the relative complexity of their operation compared with 
that of seismic crews which employ similar drilling equipment, 
but pay higher costs for complex electronic equipment and larger 
crews.

(d) Supervisory Costs 

Most companies have geological and geophysical staffs which 


coordinate the operations of field staffs and analyze and correlate 
their findings. No figure for the cost of such supervision has been 
published. It has been calculated at a flat rate of 10% of 
direct survey costs. 

A summary of survey costs is contained in Table A2-14 

3. exploratory drilling 

Several series of statistics of exploratory drilling have 
been published. They are inconsistent with one another, usually as 
a result of differences of opinion as to what constitutes an exploratory 
well. For the years 1948 - 1952, we have used the annual statistics on 
exploratory drilling published by the American Association of Petroleum 
Geologists. Conservation Board figures were used for 1947. Changed

Unit drilling costs are based on an average cost 
derived from the P 0 B 0 S. reports (I) while the D.B.S. series (2) 

was used for the breakdown of these cost estimates between sectors 

as shown in the appendix to a later chapter. Table A2-16 summarizes 

the cost data used in preparing the averages used for this study. While 

exploratory wells are usually more costly on a per foot basis than

development wells, owing to the more extensive coring and testing 

programs needed to evaluate prospective geological horizons penetrated by 

the drill, the difference is not great enough to affect our estimates 

materially. Table A2-17 summarizes the cost estimates used for this 

study, both exploratory and development.

We have made no allowance for any change in per foot drill¬ 
ing costs over the period* Available evidence is fragmentary and 
contradictory* While the cost of labour and materials has risen, 
increases in efficiency due to higher penetration rates, more 
economical casing programs, etc, appear to have held costs nearly 
constant over the period, 

(5) DEVELOPMENT DRILLING COSTS 

Development wells may be defined as those wells necessary 
to develop a pool after it has been found. 

Development drilling costs have been calculated on the same 
basis as exploratory drilling costs, namely, by applying an average 
cost per foGi to the statistics of footage drilled. There calcul¬ 
ations are also shown in Table A2-17, 

(6) PUMPING AND LEASE EQUIPMENT COSTS, 

The basic equipment installed on all producing leases in 
Alberta is quite similar except that not all wells are equipped with 
pumps. Average cost of wellhead and lease installations was estimat¬ 
ed as shown in Table A2-18 after consulting available references 
and industry sources.

COST OF PUMPING AND LEASE EQUIPMENT 



















97 . 


Since some exploratory wells become producers, and, con¬ 
versely, a percentage of development wells are dry holes, we have 
not relied on our statistics of exploratory and development drill¬ 
ing but have used the Conservation Board’s statistics of successful 
completions in preparing the equipment cost estimates shown in 
Table A2-19, 

(9) OTHER DEVELOPMENT COSTS 

Data on the diverse construction included under this 
title is virtually non-existent* The cost is, however, roughly 
proportional to the rate of development and a flat charge per 
successful well completed has been included* This figure is an 
estimate dropping from year to year which appears reasonable in 
the light of what references to it are available. 

The resulting estimates are shown in Table A2-20

(10) LEASE AND WELL OPERATING EXPENSE 

Lease and well operating expense or per barrel lifting costs w^re 
calculated on the basis of data contained in the 1953 and 1954 













•?/:: 


. ■ t 









P,B.S, Reports* We are concerned here only with direct lifting 
costs, and indications are that a portion of indirect costs were 
included in earlier years 1 expenditure estimates. We have added 
property taxes and surface lease rentals to the item "Operation 
of Wells" in the preparation of our estimates. These two items 
are direct costs which can be allocated as lifting costs. 

Our estimated lifting cost is based on the average per 
barrel as shown in table A2-21, While certain inaccuracies, no 
doubt, result from using this average for the six year period 
which was one of rising wages, it is probably that increases in 
productivity due to larger batteries with more efficient utiliz¬ 
ation of labour and partial automation of field operations during 
the period kept labour costs relatively constant.

(ID GAS PLANT OPERATING EXPENSE 

Cash operating expense is a relatively insignificant item. 

In general, it varies with the throughput of plants. While no 
accurate cost figures for Alberta plants have been published, a 
cash operating cost of 3£ per mcf processed seems reasonable in the 
light of the charge of 5£ per mcf for stripped gas made by some of the 
plants. On this basis, operating costs for gas conservation plants 
can be estimated as follows;

Leases, Rentals, Royalties and Fees, Surface Leases. 

The increase in reported totals from about $45 Million 
in 1952 (1) to over $134 Million in 1953 strongly suggests that figures 
for earlier years were not reported on a comparable basis. 

It appears that all items listed except ” General Costs 14 and Taxes 
would be more properly fitted in elsewhere. We have assumed that 
these two items make up the administrative and overhead costs 
referred to here. Table A2-24 shows these expenditures for 1953- 
and 1954 as related to total expenditures by ’’Oil Firms Proper” 
according to the Provincial Bureaus Report (I), Assuming as we 
have generally, that direct costs vary directly with activity, and 
assuming that supervision also varies with activity, it was felt that 
overhead could be best calculated as a percentage of direct expenditures 
for exploration, development and producing, 1953 and 1954 costs 
run about 8 percent of total expenditures according to the P, B,S, 
figures. These figures include Royalties, which ours do not, so a 
figure of 10 per cent of direct costs (equivalent to approximately 9 
per cent of total, excluding Royalties and Financial payments) was used.

14 FINANCIAL PAYMENTS , 

( a ) Payments for the Use of Capital 

This category includes, as the name implies, dividend 
payments, interest payments, and distributions made to the owners 
of a type peculiar to the Western Canadian Petroleum Industry and 
known as royalty trusts. This form of organization apparently 
developed in Alberta during the earlier Turner Valley boom between 
1937 and 1940 , and warrants a certain amount of description because 
of its uniqueness. Wells were drilled by trustees who sold certifi- 
cates representing proportionate equitable ownership in the parti¬ 
cular well. The trustee expended these funds and paid the net 
income to the certificate holders as "net royalties". This form of 
enterprise appears to be extinct for new organizations, but distrib¬ 
utions are still being made to holders of such interests in Turner 
Valley wells, and were substantial in amount during the earlier part 
of the period under review. 

Amounts shown in Table A2-27 were estimated on the basis 
of data appearing in the Financial Post’s "Survey of Oils" 
for the various years. Coverage of companies by this publication 
is incomplete, as it omits private companies and the Canadian 
!divisions or subsidiaries of American companies, for the most part. 
This omission is not too serious for our purpose as it is extremely 
doubtful if any of the companies or the producing departments 
of major integrated Canadian oil companies were in a profit position 
or sufficient of a cash surplus position to allow the payment of 
dividends during the period we are concerned with. An allowance 
has been made for a portion of the debs charges of one Canadian

105. 

Taxes paid by Oil, Gas or Naptha producers were taken directly 
from this report, while taxes applicable to producing operations or 
integrated companies were calculated by taking the depletion allowance 
claimed by Petroleum Refiners, multiplying by three to give depletable 
income, deducting depletion to give taxable income, then calculating 
income tax at the prevailing rates (2). A deduction was made for 
that portion of taxes assumed to be payable by concerns on profits 
earned outside Alberta, The amount, however, is small* No 
allowance was made for any excess profits tax payable on the 
producing income of integrated companies for 1947-1948, It is 
unlikely that the amount was significant* 

Details of the calculation are shown in Table A2-27 


(2) Lower tax rates applicable to that portion of income under 

$20,000 were ignored as most companies were in a substantially 
better position if they earned a profit at all.

This item is easily divided between Sectors by inspection of its compon¬

C.P.R. and C.N.R, acreage in Sector IV and H.B.C. receipts in Sector V, 
While not too much is known about the location of freehold mineral rights 
owners, it has been assumed that one-half reside in Alberta, one quarter 
elsewhere in Canada and one-quarter abroad. Table A3-1 shows the alloca¬

2. GEOLOGICAL and GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY COSTS 


Since we have assumed that all geophysical surveys were conducted by 
contractors, this portion of expenditures has been allocated entirely to 
Sector II. The same applies to expenditures for structure test drilling. 

Much of the cost of operating geological surface parties, and of ad¬ 
ministration and supervision consists of salaries, wages, and materials 
and supplies purchased locally. Ninety percent of the cost of these items, 
therefore, has been allocated to Sector HI, while the balance has been split 
evenly between Sectors IV and V. Table A3-2 shows the breakdown of survey 
costs.

3. EXPLORATORY DRILLING COSTS 

Our breakdown of drilling costs is based on the same Provincial Bureau 
statistics used for estimating these costs (1) and on DJB ,S. reports covering 
contractors 1 2 revenues and expenditures for the years 1945-52 (2). 

Gn the basis of these studies, drilling costs were broken down as follows:

Allocation of these cost components between Sectors is a relatively 
simple matter. Contract payments (to drillers) and Services are both pro¬ 
vided by Sector II firms and will be more thoroughly broken down at a later 
point. It is safe to assume that labour and fuel payments were made to res¬ 
idents of Alberta or Alberta firms, so these two classes of payments fall 
into Sector III. Virtually all materials and supplies used in drilling wells 
are supplied by various service companies, leaving only casing, tubing and 
some bits to be supplied by the operator. If we assume, as seems reasonable, 
that the ^materials and supplies 11 item includes casing, tubing and bits, which 
were not manufactured in Canada during this period, we may allocate this 
item to Sector V. Table A3-4 summarizes the results of the allocation just 

described. _______ 

(3) Including wellsite grading, mud, cementing, acidizing, testing, perforating, 

fishing, logging, core barrel rental and consultants* fees.

5 • PUMPING and LEASE EQUIPMENT COSTS 

Of these co3ts, by far the greater part represent equipment costs, the 
rest being installation costs and freight. During this period, virtually all 
the equipment for oil-lease installations was imported. Equipment costs, 
therefore, have been treated as payments to Sector V. Installation costs 
comprise, mainly, wages paid to Albertans and profits accruing to small bus¬ 
inesses situated here. Freight charges have been split between Canadian and 
foreign carriers on a 50-50 basis. The percentages used for allocation are 
as follows: 


Equipment (Sector V) 82.5% 

Installation (Sector m) 8.7% 

Freight 8.8% (Sector IV - 4.4%) 

(Sector V - 4.4%) 

These percentages are based on an analysis of the cost estimates used. 
Allocation of these expenditures is shown in Table A3-7.

7. OTHER DEVELOPMENT COSTS 

These include the cost of such "offsite facilities" as field offices, ware¬ 
houses, firefighting installations, hospitals, etc. For the present, these are 
also shown as a payment to Sector II to be broken down at a later point, 

8. LEASE and WELL OPERATING EXFE ITSES

based on available published figures from different sources:

These two sets of figures, prepared some twelve years apart, reveal, 
through the increasing expenditureson "materials, supplies, repairs, etc." 
and decreasing expenditures on labour, the increased mechanization that has 
taken place in the oil field over the past decade and is still going on. The 
items for taxes and surface rentals are, of course, due to legal differences 
between Canadian and American operations. In the U.S., taxes in support 
of local or state governments often take the form of severance or sales taxes, 
while in Alberta, most municipalities levy a personal property tax. Again, 
in the U.S., mineral rights are held by the landowner so that a mineral lease 
usually contains right-of-entry provisions, while in Alberta the Crown usually 
owns the minerals and a separate lease from the surface owner is necessary

As the period covered by our study is somewhat earlier than than covered 
by the P .B .S. figures, we may assume a lower degree of mechanization and 
higher relative labour costs. The following breakdown was used:

Fuel and Power 

4%

9. GAS PLANT OPERATING EXPENSE 

Principal items of cash expense in gas plant operation include labour, 
materials and supplies, fuel and power. Allocation of these costs between 
Sectors indicates that 90% of the operating expense goes to Sector III, the 
balance to Sector IV (6), 

The resulting allocation of expense is shown in Table A3-10.

10. ADMINISTRATION and OVERHEAD COSTS 

Allocation of administrative and overhead costs is shown in Table A3-11. 
Receipts by Sector II include rentals on office buildings, here assumed to be 
owned by ^service companies*. Receipts by Sector III include salaries, 
wages, fuel and power costs, materials and supplies and taxes, while Sectors 
IV and V receive a portion of head office administrative costs and research 
expenditures. Sector IV receiving in addition some tax payments.

ROYALTIES 





Royalty payments were allocated in a manner similar to lease rental 

payments. Published Crown royalty figures, plus one-half estimated “other 

freehold 11 royalty were credited to Sector III, C.P. 

R., C.N.R. 

and one- 

quarter “other freehold 11 to Sector IV, 

H.B .C. and one-quarter of “other 

freehold 11 to Sector V. 

The resulting allocation is shown in Table A3-12.

12. INTEREST and DIVIDENDS 

As mentioned in the Appendix to Chapter 2, interest and dividend pay¬ 
ments were calculated from Financial Post data (7). From data in these 

reports plus certain D.B ,S, material (8), it was possible to arrive at fairly

realistic estimates of where securities were held. For the distribution be- 
tween Alberta and other parts of Canada, location of underwriters, stock 
exchange listings and population distribution were taken into account. Al¬ 
location of interest and dividend payments was made on the following basis. 

(a) Interest: Interest on foreign held debt was calculated at known 

rates. The balance was allocated between Alberta and the rest of Canada 
in a 1:9 ratio. 

(b) Royalty Trust Distributions were allocated between Alberta, the 
rest of Canada and foreign countries on an 8:1:1 ratio. 

(c) Dividend Payments of foreign countries were estimated on the basis 
of estimated foreign ownership, while domestic payments were split 
between Alberta and the rest of Canada in the ratio of 1:9. 

The resulting allocation of payments between Sectors is shown in

13. INCOME TAXES 

Two alternative approaches are possible to the problem of allocating 


income taxes between Sectors III and IV. 

The first of these bases the allocation on the ratio between Federal 
government receipts and expenditures in Alberta, which, for the years

1947-52, is practically unity. With this assumption, the entire tax revenue 
could be regarded as revenue for Sector III, as payments to Albertans equal 
revenue received. This tends to overlook two things: 

(1) Oil companies operating in Alberta may have offices in Ontario and 
pay taxes through Ontario offices of the Department of National Revenue. 
This tends to question the validity of statistics on the ratio of Federal 
government spending and revenue in Alberta. 

(2) More serious is the objection that had Alberta not developed an oil- 
producing industry after World W r ar II, she would have been a ^have-not 11 
province, or one in which Federal spending exceeds receipts. It is, 
thus, possible to argue that much of the Federal spending in Alberta in 
this period would have taken place regardless of whether there was an 
oil industry or not. Existence of the industry enabled Alberta to pay its 
own way, but did not determine the level of spending in any great degree. 

It is obvious that inclusion of Federal payments to Albertans on the above 

basis would tend to overestimate the effect of development in this industry 
on the Alberta economy to the extent that Federal expenditures would have 
been made anyway. Because of these objections, this approach has been 
rejected. 

The alternative chosen rests on the following reasoning: 

(1) Tax receipts by the Federal government were increased by the de¬ 
velopment of this industry. 

(2) As a result, tax rental payments to the provinces were also increased, 
and Alberta shared in this increase. 

Accordingly, income taxes have been allocated between the Federal 
government (Sector IV) and the provincial government (Sector JII), based

on the ratio that tax rental payments to Alberta bear to tax rental payments 
as a whole, applied to the proportion of Federal tax revenue paid out under 
tax rental agreements. These figures are shown in Table A3-14.

It is believed that this method of allocation is as realistic as possible, 
bearing in mind the impossibility of determining from taxation statistics 
the source of the profits which are taxed. This basis of estimating may 
actually overstate the importance of this source of revenue to the provincial 
government, for, without oil, Alberta would be another have-not province 
and might have received Federal subsidies to ease the burdens of government* 
However, it may also tend to underestimate the effect on Alberta as a 
whole, as more buoyant revenues may have had some tendency to increase 
spending in Alberta as well as in other parts of Canada. 

Table A3-15 shows the results of an allocation made on the above 


basis.

(1) These percentages are estimates based on data given by Kastrop, J. E. , 
World Oil (Vol. 132, No. 6) (May 1951) p. 55. The figures shown relate 
to seismic operations but have been used for all types as no information 
is available showing differences between types. 































121 


In allocating these expenditures to sector accounts, the following 
procedures were followed. 

Labour costs were allocated to Sector III in their entirety. The 
major items of materials and supplies purchased in Alberta are gas, oil and 
repairs. Including other incidental local purchases, it is estimated that about 
40% of materials and supplies expenditures was spent in Alberta. Other ma¬ 
terials and supplies used include explosives, recording film, chemicals, rock 
bits, drill pipe and many minor items. Of the imports it is estimated that 40% 
were purchased in Canada, the balance imported from abroad. Materials and 
supplies then are split between Sector III - 40%, Sector IV - 24% and Sector V 
- 36%. 

Allocation of profits was based on the number of crews operated 
by Canadian firms and foreign firms each year as shown in Table A5-2.

(b) Capital Expenditures 

In 1946 there were 15 geophysical parties in operation in Alberta. 
The estimated age structure of this population was as follows at January 1, 1947. 

Under one year 2 

One to two years 4 

Two years and over 9 

T5 

In estimating the capital expenditures made on geophysical equip¬ 
ment, it has been assumed that the average life of such equipment is three 
years. This is, of course, a simplification, as some items of equipment, 
particularly vehicles, are replaced almost annually, while certain scientific 
apparatus has a much longer life than three years. However, the life span of 
much apparatus, e. g. : recording equipment, is kept quite short by obsoles¬ 
cence, and three years seems to be an average life figure widely accepted in 
the industry. 

Physical demand for new "Units" (a unit is defined here as includ¬ 
ing the entire equipment required by a crew) has been estimated from figures 
on peak crews operating each year and is shown in Table A5-4. Replacement 
demand is shown in Table A5-5.

Estimated capital expenditure^on geophysical units were estimated 
on the basis of the following cost estimates. These relate to seismograph units 
in particular. However, although gravity units are cheaper, airborne magne¬ 
tometer units are much more expensive, and it is felt that the use of the seis¬ 
mic cost estimates does not lead to much distortion, especially in view of the 
preponderance of this type of operation. Total estimated capital expenditures 
appear in Table A5-7.

(c) Allocation of Capital Expenditures to Sector Accounts 

Principal items of equipment for a seismic unit and the sector 
from which each is purchased are listed below: 

Sector III (Alberta ) 

Dealers' profit on Automotive Units, special truck bodies, 
trailers, camps, etc. 

Sector IV (Rest of Canada) 

Automotive Units, Cable, 

Sector V (Rest of World) 

Geophones, Recording Units, Amplifiers, Surveying Instru¬ 
ments, Shothole Drills, 


This breakdown forms the basis of our cost distribution. 


Allocation between sectors is based on the following percentages 
and is shown in Table A5-9«

(d) Sources of Funds 

Net funds required, since expenses were covered by earnings, in¬ 
clude only those portions of capital expenditures not covered by depreciation 
charges, plus changes in working capital. 

Working capital estimates were prepared by estimating total re¬ 
quirements on a six weeks' expenditures basis. A first estimate of the increase 
was prepared on the basis of these estimated requirements. These were then 
adjusted to eliminate extreme year to year fluctuations. This method was used 
for calculating working capital requirements for all service company groups. 

Capital requirements not met by depreciation are assumed to be 
equity investment and come apparently from two sources: 

(1) Direct investment by U. S. firms. 

(2) Investment by individuals resident in Canada, chiefly 
Albertans. 

There are no Canadian public companies engaged in geophysical 
prospecting, and of the Canadian firms in this field nearly all are owned by 
Alberta residents. 

Equity investment has been divided between these two groups on 
a basis to reconcile with the ownership data in Table A5-2. Depreciation ac¬ 
cruals were divided on the basis of ownership at January 1, and additional re¬ 
quirements estimated to make investment reconcile with unit ownership. Table 
A5-10 shows the resulting estimates of cash sources for geophysical contract¬ 
ing firms.

Bn Drilling Contractors 
(a) Income Account 

Contract income has been broken down on the basis of the percen¬ 
tages shown in Table A5-11, resulting in the breakdown shown in Table A5-12. 
In Table A5-13, these cost breakdowns are allocated-to sector accounts,. La¬ 
bour is allocated to Sector III as are Fuel, Repairs, Administration, etc= An 
arbitrary 10% - 20% - 70% split of Materials and Supplies between Sectors III, 
IV and V has been made. Income Tax has been split between Sector III and IV 
on the same basis as used in Table A3-15, above,, Profits were allocated be¬ 
tween Sector III and Sector V on the basis of ownership of rigs in use as indi¬ 
cated in Table A5-14.

(b) Capital Expenditures 

In 1946, the Provincial Bureau of Statistics reported that there 
were 20 drilling rigs operating in Alberta, Nearly all of these were locally 
ownedc The following year, the Leduc discovery caused an influx of rigs be¬ 
longing to American contractors. While records available are sketchy, Ameri¬ 
can rigs appear to have been about one-third of the total in the province for the 
period under review. 1952 costs of rigs then in use range from $75,000 to 
$400,000 and over. No accurate figures are available, but 1952 costs for the 
average drilling rig in Western Canada could not have been far from $150,000, 
The following is an estimate of cost of an average rig in the other years, 

1947 - $104,000 

1948 - $117,000 

1949 - $125,000 

1950 - $128,000 

1951 - $141,000 


Estimates of capital expenditures are highly conjectural, not only 
because of the inadequate estimates of unit costs but because of the constant 
flow of rigs across provincial and international borders, (This problem also 
exists in the case of seismic units, but they appear to have been more station¬ 
ary, ) Not all the increase in numbers of rigs in Alberta represent new rigs, 
and the decrease taking place in 1952 represents a movement of rigs out of the 
province. However, if we impute an investment for new rigs moved in and a 
disinvestment for rigs moved out, a fairly reasonable estimate of the actual

132 


impact of drilling contractors' expenditures on the provincial economy is ob- 
tainedo 

Replacement expenditures on rigs are another question mark. Dur¬ 
ing this period, demand grew so rapidly that it is fairly certain that no rigs 
were scrapped. Instead, they were repaired and kept running. There were no 
changes in technology as far reaching as those causing obsolescence of seis¬ 
mic equipment. Some capital outlays were necessitated to replace trucks, mo¬ 
tors, mud tanks, and other equipment on rigs. These have been estimated at 
the equivalent of 10% of the stock of rigs in existence at the start of the year. 
Table A5-15 indicates estimated capital expenditures by drilling firms and their 
allocation. For purposes of allocation between sectors, it has been assumed 
that of the total spent, 10% accrued to Alberta supply companies etc. , while the 
rest represented imports from the U.S. The 1952 disinvestment represents a 
movement of rigs into other provinces, and is indicated as a capital export.

(c) Sources of Funds 

Table A5-16 indicates the sources of funds raised by drilling con¬ 
tracting firms to meet their capital expenditures,, 

Funds provided by Sector III and V took, almost exclusively, the 
form of equity interests in private companies. Very few (less than 5) of the 
drilling contractors are publicly held companies, and the nature of the busi¬ 
ness does not lend itself to the extending of long term credit. Some consider¬ 
able amount of short term installment credit was provided by supply companies 
to new entrants. The allocation between Sectors III and V is based on the esti¬ 
mated owner sip of rigs by American and Canadian companies.

* This represents a movement of rigs from Alberta into other provinces and may be regarded as a disinvest¬ 
ment in Alberta. Instead of a source of funds Sector IV becomes a recipient. These negative figures are

C. Structure Test Drilling 
(a) Income Acc ount 

Income of core drilling contractors has been broken down on the 
same basis used for operators of full scale rigs and shown in Table A5-12. 
The resulting estimates of expense are shown in Table A5-17. Allocation to 
sectors is given in Table A5-18. Practically all structure test drilling was 
done by local firms.

(b) Capital Account 

No information is available about the number of core drilling rigs 
actually utilized for this activity. The rigs themselves are generally inter¬ 
changeable with the rigs used for drilling shot holes for seismograph opera¬ 
tions. Rigs used for that purpose have already been included in the estimates 
for geophysical companies. Table A5-19 shows the estimated number of rigs 
used for core drilling, based on 8 working months per year for each rig.

Table A5-20 shows estimated levels of unit costs, estimated capi¬ 
tal expenditures and their allocation. The allocation assumes that the trucks 
on which the drills were mounted were made in Canada and the drills imported. 
Expenditures in Sector III represent margins of local distributors.

(c) Sources of Funds 


Table A5-21 indicates sources of funds required by structure test 
drilling contractors. It is believed that all funds were equity investment by 
Alberta residents.

It is worthy of note that subsequent to 1952, structure test drilling 
activity fell off rapidly as it proved relatively unsuccessful. Consequently the 
1952 surplus of depreciation over requirements provided a means for the with¬ 
drawal of capital from this portion of the industry.

D„ Well Servicing Companies, etc. 

This group includes companies providing cementing, drillstem 
testing, diamond coring, directional drilling, well stimulation, fishing and 
similar services as well as the services of engineering and geological con¬ 
sultants. 

(a) Income Account 

Income has been broken down on the basis shown in Table A5-22. 
The resulting estimates are shown in Table A5-23, and allocated to sector 
accounts in Table A5-24. 

The primary basis for the breakdown of expenditure (Table A5-22) 
is the data contained in the Provincial Bureau of Statistics' tabulation^), Vir¬ 
tually none of the companies in this field in Canada are publicly held and any 
estimate of their earnings is subject to a fairly wide margin of error. It 
should be noted here that the concept of service expenditures as used in this 
study appears to be broader than that used in the Provincial Bureau's report. 
It is suspected that many of the respondents included service expenditures un¬ 
der drilling costs. As a result, totals as shown here are considerably higher.

Sources of funds utilized by this group were as follows. For this 
exposition 100% dividend payout and subsequent re-investment is assumed. 

Allocation of profits and source of funds were made on the basis 
of what data was available in trade publications concerning ownership of va¬ 
rious companies. It appears that during the period in question all cementing 
and logging services, and all directional drilling was done by American firms 
while most other services were provided by local companies. A 60-40 split 
between the former and the latter has been assumed. There appears to have 
been no firms in this category owned in other parts of Canada. An allowance 
for working capital has been made, based on the level of expenditures. 


E. Oilfield Construction Contractors 

In addition to the specialized services we have been discussing, 
oilfield development requires the construction of field offices, garages, roads, 
tank footings, bridges, culverts and other items of a general construction na¬ 
ture. Usually this work is done by general contractors, though, of course,

Table A5-30 indicates the breakdown, by sectors of construction 
expenditures. The only major item requiring allocation is materials, supplies, 
fuel etc. Availability of local materials depends of course on the nature of ma¬ 
terials used for the activity in question. Fuel, sand, gravel, cement, brick and some 
lumber was available locally. All structural steel, on the other hand, was im¬ 
ported while plumbing and electrical fixtures, furnaces, culverts, etc. were 
brought in from other parts of Canada. No accurate information is available

about the product-mix used by this sector of the construction industry. How¬ 
ever, estimates of 40, 50 and 10 percent respectively for Sectors III, IV and 
V do not appear to be far out of line.

Since these firms constitute a small fraction of the Province's 
general contracting industry, it is impossible to estimate their capital expen¬ 
ditures with any degree of reliability,, It has been assumed instead that capi¬ 
tal expenditures equal depreciation accruals for this group, and that capital 
expenditures were equally divided between other parts of Canada and the U. S. 
The resulting allocation of capital expenditures is shown in Table A5-31, The 
assumption that capital expenditures equal depreciation eliminates the neces¬ 
sity of considering outside sources of funds.

F. Office Rentals 

No information directly bearing on the amount of office rentals 
paid by the oil industry is available. These estimates must therefore be re¬ 
garded with a great deal of caution. They are based on the D, B, S, report 
"Construction in Canada", and on business tax assessment for the City of 
Calgary (^), which gives a fairly good index of total rentals paid for commer¬ 
cial property in Calgary (including imputed rentals for owner occupied pro¬ 
perty), The resulting estimates were checked with estimates of rental derived 


(5) City Clerk, Municipal Manual , Calgary, 1957, p. 74, 
















147 - 


from the estimated number of administrative employees, making an allowance 
for space occupied per employee. The comparison indicates that the rental 
estimates lie in a reasonable range. 

(a) Income Account 

Table A5-32 indicates the estimated allocation of rental income 
received by office building owners.

Allocation of these expenditures between sectors, as shown in 
Table A5-33, has been made on the following assumptions: 

(a) Maintenance, property taxes, etc. are paid to recipients within the 
province (Sector III). 

(b) Interest is paid to Canadian firms not resident in Alberta such as 
life insurance companies, pension funds, trust companies, etc. 
(Sector IV). 

(c) Income tax is paid to Alberta and the federal government (Sectors 
III and IV) on the basis indicated earlier in Table A3-14. 






























148 - 


(d) Profits accrue 60% to residents and 40% to non-residents and are 
paid out as they accrue. The 60% seems high but the total includes 
owner-occupied buildings.

(c) Sources of Funds 

Net capital requirements, equal to capital expenditures less de¬ 
preciation accurals which are assumed to be applied to amortization of exist¬ 
ing debt, came from mortgages on the properties in question and from the 
owners' equity investment. No details are available on the extent of mortgage 
financing. However, nearly all appears to have come from financial institu¬ 
tions outside the province, an unknown portion of whose funds derived from 
Albertans' savings, while much of the equity financing came from residents. 

It is estimated that in total 70% of the required funds came from Sector IV, 
the balance from Sector III,
