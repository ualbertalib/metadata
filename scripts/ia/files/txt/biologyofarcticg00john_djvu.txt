ABSTRACT 


In the spring of 19*+9 and the spring and summer 
of 1950, a study was made of the biology of the Arctic 
grayling ( Thymallus signifer ) in the southern parts of the 
Athabaska drainage. 

Measurements which were taken on fish from Alberta 
and Saskatchewan indicate that no racial differences exist 
between fish from two widely separated areas. The study of 
growth rates demonstrated that stream grayling grow at a 
slightly slower rate in the Athabaska drainage than the lake 
fish studied by other authors, and that the rate varies from 
stream to stream. There is an indication of a correlation 
between growth rate and bottom food 0 However, grayling are 
versatile feeders and terrestrial insects are important in 
the summer diet. Sexual maturity is reached at the end of 
the third year of life. Spawning takes place in May after 
the fish have migrated into the smaller streams. Various 
aspects of the spawning habits are described. After spawn¬ 
ing, the fish remain in the stream for the summer, then leave 
in the autumn before ice formation is extensive.

INTRODUCTION 


There are few fresh water sport fish which are as 
little known as the Arctic grayling. Because this fish makes 
its home in the Arctic and Subarctic, man has had little 
opportunity to observe its habits thoroughly, and only in 
recent years has it been studied at all. Its distribution 
is widespread throughout the Arctic and extends into the 
Churchill drainage system, the numerous rivers and lakes of 
norther* Saskatchewan that drain into Lake Athabaska, and the 
Athabaska River system in Alberta. It is in this latter 
drainage system that the author has made observations on the 
biology of this fish. 

The grayling has been well known to the people of 
northern Alberta for many years. Sportsmen are familiar 
with its fine sporting and eating qualities; and it has been 
pursued vigorously. In recent years fewer have been caught 
and catches are made up of smaller fish. This condition has 
become so alarming that conservation measures must be taken 
in the near future or this fine fish may disappear from our 
local streams altogether. Before conservation can be prac¬ 
tised, how r ever, it is necessary to learn more about the 
grayling. With this purpose in mind, the author began pre¬ 
liminary investigations in the spring of 19*+9 when the Alberta 



















Government set up its first spawn camp for these fish at 
Cold Creek. Further studies were carried out at the same 
place during the spawn-taking in 1950, and these investiga¬ 
tions were then carried on throughout the summer in various 
other streams of the Athabaska drainage. The purpose of 
this paper is to record the findings and to present as clear 
a picture as possible of the life history and habits of the 
Arctic grayling living in the more southern parts of the 
Athabaska drainage system. 

Review of the Literature on Grayling 

Little has been published on the habits and 
activities of the Arctic grayling. R. B. Miller (1946) 
calculated the growth rates of 104 fish caught in Great 
Bear Lake. He includes calculated growth rates for 23 fish 
from Great Slave Lake, and 15 fish from Lake Athabaska, 
plus a comparison of these rates with the rates of growth 
of Montana grayling ( Thymallus montanus ) from Ford Lake, 
Michigan. Scale formation is reported to take place when 
fry are about 50 mm. in length. A brief analysis of the 
contents of 102 stomachs showed a very mixed diet, and 
demonstrated that, during the summer, terrestrial insects 
are a very important food source. Maturity is attained 
during the fourth and fifth summers. 

D. S. Rawson (1949) gives the distribution of 
grayling in northern Saskatchewan as M wide in the Athabaska

drainage, general in the Reindeer Lake area, and doubtful 
in the remainder of the Churchill drainageSpawning is 
said to occur about the last week in May, temperatures at 
this time being 42° F. to 48° F. Dr* Rawson also mentions 
a very interesting difference in the dorsal fins of the male 
and female after reaching sexual maturity. From analyses 
of the stomach contents of 26 specimens from Athabaska, 
Reindeer and Wollaston Lakes, Dr. Rawson outlines the great, 
variety of insect food utilized by grayling and indicates 
that terrestrial insects make up over fifty percent of the 
food volume during the summer. Of equal interest is infor¬ 
mation on the spawn-taking and on the development of the 
eggs. In water ranging from 44° F. to 48° F., the eggs 
•eyed* in 12 days, and hatched in 4-6 more days in water 
ranging from 48° F. to 52° F. The yolk sac was absorbed 
in about 8 days. The fry were then reared on commercial 
goldfish food for 3 days. Later, this was supplemented by 
"alfalfa meal, milk powder and soy bean meal". 

In the report of fishery survey work to the 
Alberta Provincial Government (1948), R. B. Miller notes 
that growth of fish in seven tributaries of the McLeod 
drainage is rather poor for the climate, and that poorest 
growth seems to be associated with the poorest supply of 
bottom food. Sexual maturity of fish examined in these 
streams is usually reached at the end of the third year, 
which is at least one year earlier than that of the fish 
of Great Bear Lake*

»• ■ •• 


















Some present-day authors believe there is very 
little difference the Arctic and Montana species of gray¬ 
ling, and that the latter is better treated as a subspecies 
of the former* Considerably more investigations have been 
undertaken on the Montana species * 

J. W. Leonard (1938) reports on the feeding habits 
of the Montana grayling in Ford Lake, Michigan, and shows 
that these fish have different kinds of food in their sto¬ 
machs in May than they have in October. Even the time of day 
has its influence on the food items taken. Not only does 
this illustrate the varied diet of the species, but also the 
fact that they select items as they are available. 

G. J. D. Brown (1938) investigated the food items 
utilized by Montana grayling in various lakes and streams 
in Montana. He also used stomach contents in his study. 

In the smaller fish from Meadow Creek he found that 70.1$ 
of the total stomach contents was made up of debris, and 
in the larger fish this weight was 58.8$. Aquatic insects 
made up 66.5$ of the food items in the smaller fish and 
55$ in the larger. Predominant foods were mayflies, damsel- 
fly nymphs and Coleoptera. Terrestrial insects were taken 
more by the larger fish while Crustacea and Cladocera were 
taken fairly frequently by the smaller fish. In Roger*s 
Lake, debris was rarely found in the stomachs of fingerlings 
but amounted to 25 $ in the 150-250 mm. fish and 72 . 6 $ in 
the largest specimens. The 150-250 mm. fish ate 7^.7$ 
aquatic food. The main items taken were midges, Amphipoda 




ft 


f 


' 



and Cladocera. From Grebe Lake the stomach contents consis¬ 
ted of midge larvae and small mayfly nymphs for the fry* 

Midges and damselflies made up the bulk of the 76*9$ of the 
aquatic organisms, and the 2 % terrestrial insects were 
Coleoptera. Debris was 38*3$ of the weight. Agnes Lake 
fish had 56*5$ debris. Midges (39A$) and mayflies (10.5$) 
made up the bulk of the aquatic food. Terrestrial insects 
(13.1$) were all Coleoptera. Brown states that ”Th@ season 
of the year and the habitat of the fish almost certainly 
have greater influence on what is eaten than any selection 
these fish have demonstrated by their stomach content.” 

Brown (1938) made observations on the breeding 
habits and life history of the Montana grayling. He des¬ 
cribes the spawning act in detail, but there seems some doubt 
as to whether or not there is any lengthy spawning migra¬ 
tions. The numbers of eggs taken from some fish are reported. 
However, few actual egg counts were made. Males produce 
very small quantities of milt. Many of the Montana grayling 
are reported to spawn at the end of their second year. 

The age and growth of Montana grayling from Ford 
Lake, Michigan, Roger 5 s, Meadow, Agnes, Georgetown and Grebe 
Lakes in Montana and Yellowstone National Park were also 
studied by Brown (19^3)• He calculated the standard lengths 
at the end of each year of life separately for the fish 
from each lake. The average calculated standard lengths were 
then compared. There was a considerable variation between 
the rates of growth in the lakes. Grayling in Agnes Lake 







- 6 - 

had the slowest growth and those in Georgetown the fastest. 
However, the first year fish from Agnes Lake were longer 
than those from Grebe Lake or Ford Lake, Thus, the superi¬ 
ority gained in the first year need not necessarily con¬ 
tinue in the years that follow. No significant length- 
weight differences between the sexes could be found. The 
oldest fish, which was from Grebe Lake, was interpreted as 
being six years old, 

Clarence A, Tryon (19*+7) writes a very graphic 
account of the spawning habits of the Montana grayling in 
the inlet to Roger®s Lake, Water temperature during his 
observations remained at h0° F, He noted that no attempts 
were made to build nests - nor was there any definite pair¬ 
ing off among the fish. Males would take up a favored loca¬ 
tion, defend it against other males, and mate with any female 
that came near and was willing. The spawning act lasted for 
ten seconds, during the latter part of which the violent 
vibrating movements stirred up a cloud of sand and obscurred 
the eggs. The spawning occurred on sandy bottom. 

James A. Henshall (190?) outlines the methods 
used to propagate grayling eggs. Fertilization is carried 
out by the dry process and results in 95 percent fertility. 
The stripping is a bit difficult to start but the eggs flow 
freely thereafter. The eggs must be eyed in jars because 
they tend to stick together, but once eyed, can be safeljr 
placed in trays. The eye spot appears in about a week or 
ten days at a temperature of 50° F., and incubation is

completed within two weeks. The yolk sac is absorbed in a 
week or ten days, at which time the fish are about half an 
inch long and very delicate 0 

Alberta Grayling Streams 

In Alberta, the Arctic grayling is found in streams 
waters a eventually end up in the Arctic Ocean. The 
two main drainages are the Peace River and Athabaska River 
systems. Though there is little doubt that grayling occur 
in the larger rivers at various seasons of the year, it is 
in the smaller feeder streams that they seem to spend most 
of the summer months* Any stream that varies in width from 
two or three feet to thirty or forty feet, does not reach 
a summer maximum in excess of 65° F* (except perhaps for 
short periods), and which carries little silt during most 
of the summer months, is a potential grayling stream* 
Strangely, the grayling is rarely found in the clear moun¬ 
tain streams. The reason for this is not known, but it may 
be the more violent fluctuations in water level. Most often 
the streams are those that run through muskeg areas through¬ 
out part of their course so that the water is stained brown, 
but this is not always the case. The author has found 
grayling in streams which were perfectly clear, though they 
were tributaries of ‘’brown-water 81 streams* 

The most well known grayling streams are those 
tributaries of the McLeod and Pembina Rivers which do not

fit the category of "mountain” streams* Many grayling 
streams are found along the Athabaska River from approxi¬ 
mately 80 water miles upstream from Whitecourt down to the 
entrance of the Lesser Slave River. Most rivers and streams 
flowing into both Lesser Slave Lake and Lesser Slave River 
have grayling populations, though in many cases the fish 
are now found many miles upstream where conditions have been 
less altered by activities of man. Map I shows the grayling 
streams known to the author in the McLeod drainage; Map II 
shows those of the Pembina system; Map III the Lesser Slave 
Lake streams and Map IV the Athabaska River streams * 

Grayling have also been caught by the author in 
many streams in the Peace River country, though in recent 
years changing conditions have altered many that once were 
beautiful grayling waters. No map has been included for 
these streams because they have not been investigated pro¬ 
perly and do not come within the scope of this thesis. No 
doubt there are many unknown grayling waters in the more 
northerly sections of the province, but these areas are too 
inaccessible for the average sportsman to fish. We will 
deal mainly with two streams in the Lesser Slave Lake area, 
one from the McLeod drainage, and one from the Pembina 
drainage. General data will include streams in the White- 
court area, and a few others in the aforementioned areas, 
from which only a few specimens were obtained,.

the Arctic grayling*

MORPHOLOGY 

Taxonomic measurements were made on 27 preserved 
grayling taken during the spawning migration at Cold Creek 
in 1949 0 All these fish were preserved in 10$ formalin. 

In addition, measurements were made on 13 grayling from 
Saskatchewan, kindly lent by Dr. Rawson. Some of these fish 
had been preserved in formalin and others in alcohol. 

During the summer of 1950, 25 fresh specimens from four 
different Alberta streams were measured. The measurements 
taken are shown in the column headings in Table XV (appendix) 
and most of them are illustrated in Figure 1. Measurements 
were made according to Hubbs and Lagler (194?)• The mem¬ 
brane on the opercular plate was not included in the measure- 
ment of the head length. 

The measurements taken were used to plot the log¬ 
arithms of the sizes of each body part against the logarithms 
of the standard lengths of the fish. This was done on log- 
log graph paper, rather than by calculating the logarithms. 

The resultant curves are known as relative growth curves. 

These were first used and explained by Huxley (1932). The 
procedure was to plot the Alberta fish first, males and 
females separately, and then to plot the Saskatchewan fish 
on the same graphs to find how closely these points would 
fit the line. This was done for ten of the measurements 
chosen at random; except for the dorsal fin length measurement

which was included for a special reason to be discussed 
later. These graphs are shown in Figure 2. Open circles 
were used for males, closed circles for females, and crosses 
for Saskatchewan fish. The graphs in this figure do not 
show all the points plotted on the log-log paper, as the 
points in the centre fall so closely together that they could 
not be separated for illustration purposes. Measurements 
of both preserved and fresh fish were used on the same graphs 
with no significant deviations from the lines being noted. 

Homogeneity of Species 

The study of the distribution of the points on 
Figure 2 shows that they tend to fall into one or more 
straight lines. In no case do the Saskatchewan species make 
any conspicuous deviations from the lines, as they should 
if there is any significant difference between the fish. 
Therefore, the fish appear to be all of the same species. 

The graphs indicate some other points of interest. 
Those for the measurements of caudal peduncle length, pec¬ 
toral length, pectoral to pelvic length, length of dorsal 
base and head length are all straight lines. Points for 
males and females freely intermix and no sexual differences 
are shown. The only feature worthy of comment here is the 
slight differences in the slopes of the lines. This indi¬ 
cates that there are small differences in the rate at which 
the various parts of the fish are growing in relation to the

growth in length. Were the parts growing at the same rate 
as the body, we should expect a slope of 1 for each line. 
The slopes of these lines are shown in Table I*

Of the measurements under discussion, only those 
for length of dorsal base and head length deviate to any 
extent from the theoretical 1 0 This deviation indicates 
that length of the base of the dorsal fin and the length 
of the head are proportionally greater in older fish than 
in young fishu 

The graphs for maxilla length, snout to occiput 
length and caudal peduncle depth are different from those 
already mentioned. There are really two lines which meet 
at a point, the top one having a greater slope than the

bottom one* The top line represents an increase in the rate 
of growth over that expressed by the lower line. The differ¬ 
ences in the slopes are recorded in Table II, together with 
the approximate standard lengths of the fish at which the 
rate of growth increases.

The reason for the increase in growth rate at 
these lengths cannot be xx lx arrival at sexual maturity. 
According to calculated si^e and age of maturity studies 
reported later in this paper, the rate changes when the fish 
are between four and five years old. Sexual maturity is 
reached in the third and fourth years. 


Sexual Differences 

The graphs for dorsal fin length and pelvic fin 
length show sexual differences in the growth rate. Dr. Rawson

( 1949 ) reported that the dorsal fin was larger and of differ¬ 
ent shape tern that of the female. He states* “That of the 
male is longer, extending back to the adipose. It is also 
low in front and high behind. The female dorsal is shorter, 
about 1*5 inches short of the adipose, and unlike that of the 
male, it is high in front and low behind.” The author ob¬ 
served this difference in the larger fish examined, and also 
noted that the blue spots on the dorsal fin of the male were 
much brighter than those on the dorsal of the female* The 
graph for dorsal length illustrates the difference between 
the male and female dorsals. The male*s grows at a more 
rapid rate as illustrated by the slopes of the lines recorded 
in Table III, but the differences are not very great.

passing unnoticed by investigators handling smaller fish* 

The differences in the shape of the dorsal fin could not be 
measured, but the photograph (Figure 3) shows a male and 
female with dorsals extended, and the differences noted by 
Dr* Rawson show up clearly* The graph for pelvic length 
shows that the males have a slightly longer pelvic fin than 
have the females. The difference is too slight to be obser¬ 
ved on the fish. It is a constant difference that arises 
early in the development and does not change throughout life* 


AGE AND GROWTH STUDIES 

Spt-in# 

In the spring of 1949 and throughout the 1summer of 
1950 a total of 207 grayling was taken for age and growth 
studies. The fork lengths of these fish were measured in 
millimeters immediately after capture and a sample of their 
scales taken from the left side between the dorsal fin and 
the lateral line. The fish captured in the springs of 19*+9 
and 1950 were taken from the spawning run by means of traps* 
Those taken during the summer of 1950 were captured by 
angling. A number of the scale samples were from fish cap¬ 
tured by Dr. Miller in the summer of 194-6* 

The scale samples were cleaned, mounted in glycer¬ 
ic 

ine, and the age determined with'?a binocular microscope. A 
few of the scales were used to make impressions in plastic 
squares. This was done by dipping the scale in acetone and

applying pressure with a stamp made from a notary's seal. 

This method worked satisfactorily for the larger scales after 
a little practice. After the age was determined, the scales 
were measured and the age determinations checked by projec¬ 
ting the images of the scales on a piece of paper, using a 
magnification of 19.5* Annuli were determined by the pre¬ 
sence of incomplete circuli, erosion and crossover. Annuli 
were more readily seen along the antero-lateral radius, but 
the measurements were taken along the antero-posterior dia¬ 
meter. To do this, it was first necessary to locate the 
annuli on the antero-lateral radius and then follow the 
circuli carefully around the scale. This method may have 
resulted in some small error, but it is believed the read¬ 
ings are accurate enough for practical purposes. It was 
felt a better relationship between the annulus diameter and 
fork length might be obtained in this manner. 

The relationship between the fork length of the 
fish and the antero-posterior diameter of the scale was 
treated as linear when calculating the lengths of the fish 
at the end of the previous year's growth. A plot of scale 
diameter against fork length (Figure 4) did not produce a 
straight line; the growth calculations will therefore be 
liable to error, but, since the line is only slightly 
curved, the error will be small. 

No young fingerlings were captured. Thus, the 
length at which scale formation takes place could not be 
determined through the study of specimens. Miller (1946)

found that scale formation in Arctic grayling from Great 
Bear Lake took place at a length of about 50 mm. and, since 
the downward extrapolation of the curve in Figure 4 cuts the 
axis at the same fork length, this figure has been used* 

The formula used for calculations was described by Lee (1920) 
and is the one used by Miller (1946): 

Fork length at year x = 

( antero-posterior diameter at year x X fork length - 50) + 50 
whole antero-posterior diameter 

Rate of Growth in the Athabaska Drainage 

The average lengths and weights at capture together 
with the calculated lengths for each year of life for 207 
grayling are shown in Table IV. These fish represent those 
caught in fifteen different streams of the Athabaska drainage. 
Because there were only two specimens seven years of age, 
the average calculated lengths for these fish are not ver^ 
reliable.

Four of the streams from which the greatest number 
of fish was taken have been selected for comparative purposes. 
The average lengths and weights at capture and the calculated 
lengths at the end of each year of life for Prairie Creek, 
for Marten Creek, for Trout Creek, and for Cold Creek are

are graphically represented in Figure 5> page 26. 

The numbers of samples used to compute the growth 
rates for these streams are not as large as they should be 
for accurate calculations. However, it is felt they are 
large enough to make comparisons with the average calculated 
growth rates from all the fish of the Athabaska drainage.

The growth of fish from Prairie Creek follows, 
almost identically, the general average growth of all fish. 
The two seven-year-old fish used in the calculations are the 
same in each table. The fish from Marten Creek show a 
slight increase in growth at all ages over that of the 
Prairie Creek fish. Trout Creek fish show a considerable 
increase in growth over the fish from either of these two 
streams. The five-year-old fish in Trout Creek are almost 
as large as six-year-old fish from Prairie or Marten Creeks. 
The fish from Cold Creek show the poorest growth. The three 
first-mentioned creeks are roughly the same size, but Cold 
Creek is approximately one-fifth as large. All the fish 
measured in this stream were four-year-olds, which may make 
the calculations of growth less accurate than for fish of 
the other streams. Because Cold Creek is the smallest from 
which grayling were taken, it is remarkable that the growth 
of fish there does not deviate to a greater extent from the 
general average. 

Growth Hate and Food Supply in Four Creeks 

Miller ( 19 *+ 8 ) noted that the poorest growth 
occurred in grayling from streams having the poorest food 
supply. His work was done on streams of the McLeod River 
drainage, and included Cold Creek, He found that the fish 
from this stream showed a greater growth than those from 
the other six small streams examined, and he also found the 







- 29 - 


bottom food in largest supply - 1*3 cc. per square foot. 

The author also took bottom samples in Cold Creek but ob¬ 
tained less than one-quarter this volume of bottom organisms 
per square foot. This stream is very prone to anchor ice 
formation so that the bottom food could show considerable 
variation from year to year. Three bottom samples were 
taken from the riffles of each of the streams under consider¬ 
ation; one each from the upper, middle and lower reaches, 
except for Trout Creek. The upper reaches of this stream 
were devoid of riffles, the flow being slow and the bottom 
of silt and debris. The amount of food in the four streams 
is shown in Table VI, with a list of the genera of the 
organisms included. 

It will be noted that Trout Creek had the greatest 
volume of food and Cold Creek the least. Prairie and 
Marten Creeks fall between in the order of the growth rates 
of their fish populations. Thus, it would seem that there 
is some indication that greatest growth occurs in streams 
with the greatest food supply. The differences in the 
volumes of bottom food are not very great, and, since various 
authors have shown that grayling feed extensively on terres¬ 
trial insects during the summer months, it is not surprising 
that the correlation is not exact. Especially in the 
first two years, Prairie Creek fish show a higher rate of 
growth than Cold Creek fish; yet the volume of bottom food 
is not much larger than it is in Cold Creek. Trout Creek 
fish have a much faster growth rate than Marten Creek fish,

yet the quantity of bottom food is almost the same in both 
streams. Therefore, the terrestrial food available to the 
grayling in the streams must also have a bearing on the 
rates of growth. 

The rates of growth for Great Slave Lake, Lake 
Athabaska, and Great Bear Lake were determined by Miller 
(1946). Of these lakes, the fish from Great Bear Lake 
showed the slowest rate. Rawson (1949) gives the rate of 
growth in Reindeer Lake as about the same as that of Lake 
Athabaska for the first two years and more rapid thereafter. 
Montana Lake grayling (Brown, 1943) grow at about the same 
rate as those from Reindeer Lake. Grayling from the Atha¬ 
baska streams grow slightly faster than those from Great 
Bear Lake until three years of age and more slowly there¬ 
after. The slowing of the rate of growth as the fish become 
larger may be due to the more rigorous life led by the 
stream fish or perhaps the food supply is smaller at some, 
or all, seasons of the year. 

The rates of growth for males and females were 
calculated separately to determine if there was any differ¬ 
ence between the sexes. The calculated fo3&lengths at the 
end of each year of life are given in Table VII*

Males show a slight tendency to grow at a more 
rapid rate than females. This tendency also shows up in 
calculations made by Miller (19^6) although only in the 
older fish. 

Few grayling were examined for degree of sexual 
maturity. Miller (19^8) found that maturity is reached 
in the third year for both sexes, and the data shown in 
Table VIII indicates this is generally the case.

Seventy-five percent males and females together 
are mature by the time they are three years old; 8 0 5 percent 
are maturing; and 16.5 percent are immature 0 All four-year- 
old fish examined were found to be mature. 

The oldest Arctic grayling caught were two in 

e i o h i h 

their oovonth year of life. These were specimens from 
Prairie Creek. Brown (19^3) captured one Montana grayling 
that was six years old. Miller (19*+6) found Arctic gray¬ 
ling in Great Bear Lake up to twelve years old. Apparently 
the farther north the fish are, the slower they develop and 
the longer they live. 


FEEDING HABITS 

Forty-seven stomachs were removed from grayling 
caught mainly in June and September, and preserved in 5% 
formalin. The majority of these were from stream fish but 
twelve came from the beaver dams shown in Map V, page 3*+* 
The contents of the stomachs were examined in the labora¬ 
tory and the undigested organisms from each were recorded. 
No quantitative measurements of individual organisms were 
made, but the volumes of the debris and of the total food 
items in each stomach were measured by water displacement 
in a graduated tube. The digested material which could not 
be recognized was measured with the food items. Organisms 
were keyed to the orders only; the member of the order most

^Main items eaten in beaver dams 


Terrestrial organisms were found In 76 . 6% of the 


stomachs, while bottom items occurred in every stomach (100$). 















Several of the beaver dam samples were nearly empty while 
some of the others were gorged almost completely with a 
single kind of organism. Two of these stomachs (16.6$) 
contained terrestrial insects and the remainder contained 
aquatic forms. The specimens from the dams were taken 
late in the season (September 20th-30th), at the time when 
terrestrial insects were becoming scarce, so that selection 
probably depended on the forms available. Of the samples 
from the streams, all contained bottom items and 
contained terrestrial forms* 

Debris amounted to 21 0 7% of the total volume of 
material found in the stomachs. This was chiefly composed 
of caddis cases, but small sticks, spruce needles, small 
stones, seeds and one feather were also found. 

In most cases, terrestrial and bottom items were 
found in the same stomach. It would appear that food items 
are eaten at random as the opportunity arises. No evidence 
of selection is apparent. During the summer months the 
stream fish eat large quantities of terrestrial food as well 
as bottom food. Beaver dam fish probably consume consider¬ 
able quantities of terrestrial food during the summer, but 
this was not apparent in the samples taken late in the 
season. Evidently the diet of the grayling is a varied one, 
and depends mainly on what is available at the time. 

Detailed studies of the food of grayling have been 
made in Ford Lake, Michigan by Leonard (1938) and in Montana 
lakes by Brown (1938)* Both investigators found that the 






















c

Montana grayling lived on a diet of both terrestrial and 
aquatic organisms of all kinds* The great variety of food 
taken is emphasized by Rawson*s studies (1949), who lists 
36 families of insects taken by Arctic grayling* Miller 
(1946) lists a varied diet for Great Bear Lake grayling 
and points out that terrestrial insects are eaten to a 
greater extent during the summer (93%) than are bottom 
organisms (21.6$)* All investigators list some plankton 
as part of the stomach contents of lake grayling, but none 
was observed in the stomachs studied by the author* Stream 
fish rarely have the opportunity to obtain this type of 
food. Small fish are more apt to feed on such minute 
organisms and none of the fish studied was under eight 
inches. It is not surprising, therefore, that no plankton 
was found. All studies that have been made on the food 
eaten by grayling show that this fish is very versatile in 
its feeding habits, choosing whatever food items are avail¬ 
able when it is hungry. 


SPAWNING HABITS 

The spawning run was first observed at Gold Creek 
in the spring of 1949* The camp was set up the first week 
of April and several streams in the district were examined 
to determine if they would be suitable for trapping. The 
streams were running but there was both floating and anchor

ice in all of them. Due to the unusually warm days, the 
snow was practically gone. The nights were cold enough to 
cause the streams to freeze over, thus eliminating any 
flooding that might have hampered operations. It took 
several days to make traps (Figure 6) because the banks of 
the streams and, in many places, the bottoms were frozen 
solid. By April 18th, the traps were installed and await¬ 
ing the arrival of the fish. 

During the lengthy waiting period the author had 
the opportunity to explore Cold Creek more fully. On April 
20 th, five grayling were observed a few hundred yards above 
the point where Cold Creek enters the Lobstick River. These 
fish were making their way upstream in a leisurely fashion. 
Temperature of the water at this time was 34° F. On April 
23rd it was found that the beaver dams (see Map V, page 34) 
contained numerous grayling which, at this time, were grouped 
in the upper dam (Dam #4, Map VI, page 42). Although a few 
were feeding, most of them were just moving about in a 
restless manner. Accordingly, we placed another trap in the 
stream just above Dam #4. On the same day, more fish were 
seen downstream from our trap near the highway, the nearest 
being about two miles below the trap. The first grayling 
was caught in the trap on April 24th; it was a male, not yet 
ripe. Thereafter, no more fish arrived in the Gold Creek 
trap until the real run began. 

On May 3rd the grayling began to arrive at the 
Cold Creek trap. There were only a few at the beginning,

but by May 5th they were being caught at the rate of about 
one hundred per day. Most of these fish were not yet ripe| 
the few that were ripe were mainly males. At this time, the 
water temperature ranged from 37° F* at night to 45° F. 
during the day. No fish were caught in our traps in the 
Lobstick River or in Brule Creek. Subsequent investigation 
showed that the migration in these creeks was obstructed by 
beaver dams below the traps. Which one of the numerous dams 
on the Lobstick River was causing the hold-up was not deter¬ 
mined. The dam on Brule Creek was found, and by dropping a 
hoop trap (Figure 7) into the stream below this dam, 97 fish 
were caught in the first hour. This was on May bth 9 The 
following day another 110 fish were caught here. Thereafter 
no more entered this trap. Most of these fish were in 
spawning condition, and were all stripped by May 8th* Water 
temperatures in Brule Creek were consistently 2-3° F. higher 
than in Cold Creek at this time. The run in Cold Creek 
began to slacken by May 10th, and by May 13th no more fish 
were being caught. 

The natural spawning of the grayling was studied 
in Cold Creek over the course of several days, beginning 
May 6th and ending May 12th, 19^9• Maximum daytime tempera¬ 
tures during this period increased from ^*9° F. to 56° F., 
while minimum temperatures rose from 39° F. to 48° F. In 
1950 , the spring run-off was considerably later, spawning 
at the same spot taking place between May 18th and May 25th. 












'

- 42 - 














- 43 - 


Maximum temperatures ranged from 43° F. to 52° F. and 
minimum temperatures from 40° F. to 47° F. 

The spawning ground where the observations were 
made was immediately beneath the highway bridge over the 
creek (see Map V). At this spot there were two riffles 
about twenty feet apart. The bottom was composed of small 
stones from three to ten inches in diameter, interspaced 
with rather fine gravel ranging in size from one-half to one 
inch in diameter. At the head of the upper riffle there was 
a solid bed of this small gravel which had accumulated from 
gravel thrown into the stream as cars crossed the bridge 
above. The fish were readily observed here. However, more 
spawning acts took place in the faster and rougher water 
above the second riffle where more natural pockets were 
formed by the scattered rocks. The grayling did not attempt 
to build nests, but took advantage of small hollows between 
stones or in the solid gravel. The picture (Figure 8, page 
44) shows the gravel bed where observations were made. 

The fish observed performing the spawning act were 
those which had been caught by our Cold Creek trap. Most 
had been stripped, but a few females were released to spawn 
naturally, and others were probably incompletely stripped. 
The ratio of males to females on this spawning ground was 
about 3*1* At the time of trapping, the ratio was very 
nearly 1.5*1, but some females were killed by being stripped 
too severely, and others were used for egg-counts. Other 
spawning grounds may have had slightly different ratios.

Fish were also seen spawning in riffles below our trap, but 
the nature of the water was such that detailed observations 
were impossible. However, it was possible to see that there 
was no difference in the performance between the latter fish 
and those clearly seen on the spawning grounds beneath the 
bridge. 

The spawning procedure was first observed care¬ 
fully on May 9th at 4:00 p.m. Mien the stream was approached 
the group of six fish then present on the spawning beds 
dashed down through the riffle to the pool below, but were 

did hot appeal- 

back again almost immediately. They frightened 

thereafter by any movement made during the observations. 

Each of three of the larger males in the immediate 
vicinity apparently had appropriated a territory. Here he 
was stationed most of the time, moving out only when driving 
off other males that came too close or when following a 
female that came near. The smaller males followed the 
females constantly, upstream and down, but were never seen 
to perform the spawning act. Instead, while one of the 
larger males was performing, a smaller male would dash in on 
the opposite side of the female and join the performance. 

When a female entered the territory of one of the males, she 
would select the most suitable spot and the male would drift 
quietly alongside and attempt to press his body tightly 
against her. Often the female would ease away, but when she 
was properly stimulated, she would return the pressure so 
that they were in contact from the pectoral fin to the area

of the vent. The male’s huge dorsal fin was arched over the 
back of the female and vigorous vibrating movements began. 
Within two to three seconds, their mouths would open and 
their bodies appeared to be in strong tension. As the climax 
was reached, their tails dropped lower in the water and a 
cloud of fine sand was churned up by the intense quivering. 

This took four to five seconds 5 then both ceased abruptly. 

The male recovered immediately, but the female usually rested 
quietly for a few moments before swimming away. The whole 
spawning act, from start to finish, fluctuated between eight 
and twelve seconds duration. The procedure here is very 
similar to that described by Tryon (19^7). 

At the time the eggs and sperm were released, the 

cloud of sand obscured the view and it was impossible to see 

the sexual products ejected. By using a bottom sampler and 
stirring up the gravel in the area, it was possible to 
recover a number of the eggs. This was done a few days after 
spawning had taken place. Forty-seven eggs were collected 
in one area, and twelve from another. Out of all these, 
only two were not fertilized. This represents a natural 
fertility of approximately ninety-six percent. Since the 
number of eggs collected was rather small, this figure may 
not represent the true natural fertility, but there is little 
doubt that it is high. 

Several females were selected for egg-counts. 

These were stripped rather severely into separate containers. 
The eggs were left to harden, then counted. The following

Measurements of length and weight were made before the fish

The difference in these figures cannot be consi¬

the weights given were taken before or after the eggs were 
removed for counting* 

AIL investigators who have reported on the strip¬ 
ping of grayling have commented on the small amount of milt 
produced by the males* This was also found to be true of 
the males used in our operations. The amount varied from a 
drop or two to a teaspoonful. It was found that males which

were retained after being used once were capable of producing 
an equal amount of milt in a day or two, and could occasion¬ 
ally be used a third time. The males producing the greatest 
quantity of milt the first time continued to give larger 
amounts than fish which gave but a drop or two. Egg fertil¬ 
ity from artificial fecundation was considerably below that 
reported for natural spawning. The f, wet M method was used, 
i*e., a small quantity of water was placed in the pan receiv¬ 
ing the eggs and sperm. The fertility of these eggs was not 
investigated but it was judged to be between seventy and 
eighty percent. This is lower than the ninety-five percent 
fertility reported by Henshall (1907) when using the "dry” 
method (no water used at all) on Montana grayling. 

Egg diameter was determined by the measurement or 
two batches of eggs. The first samples, taken three days 
after incubation was started, averaged 0.139 inches in dia¬ 
meter. The second, after five days of incubation, averaged 
0 o l49 inches. The former figure represents about 25,000 eggs 
per quart, the latter 20,450 eggs per quart (from tables in 
Lagler, 1949)o Henshall (1907) reported Montana grayling 
eggs to vary between 750 and 850 per fluid ounce. 

The development of the eggs and fry could not be 
investigated very thoroughly. The first batch of eggs, taken 
in 1949, was eyed in jars using a beaver dam at Cold Creek 
for the water supply (Figure 9> page 44). The eggs were then 
transported to the Calgary hatchery where hatching was com¬ 
pleted. Unfortunately, the water supply became contaminated

and the fry died. The fact that they died before trout fry 
in the same hatchery were affected indicates that they are 
very delicate when first hatched, and require pure water for 
survival. The operations for 1950 were even less successful. 
The eyed eggs were allowed to become too warm during trans¬ 
portation to the hatchery and none survived. The development 
of the grayling eggs is shown in the following table.

Rawson (1949) reported that Arctic grayling eggs

stage in water of 43° F. to 48° F», and four to six days in 
temperatures ranging from 48° F. to 52° F. to hatch. This 
represents approximately 250 temperature -units.

SEASONAL MOVEMENTS 

Accounts in the literature give conflicting reports 
on the distances grayling travel on their spawning migrations. 
Henshall (1907) reports that "Unlike the Rocky Mountain trout 
( Salmo clarkii ), but like the salmon, the grayling will go 
long distances, if necessary, to find suitable spawning 
grounds." He mentions one migration fourteen miles in length. 
Brown (1938) does not agree and states that the grayling is 
much more limited in its runs. Tryon (I 9 V 7 ) indicates that 
old-timers in the region of the Madison River speak of great 
runs up this river, but states that such runs are a thing of 
the past. Distribution of Montana grayling is now restricted 
mostly to lakes and the migrations confined to short runs 
into the inlets. Rawson (19*+9) states that in certain areas 
grayling are reported to run into the mouths of small streams 
to spawn. 

The author was familiar with the spawning migra¬ 
tions of Arctic grayling many years before undertaking inves¬ 
tigations into their habits. In the years 1936 to 1939 
there was a very spirited spawning run into the Beaverlodge 
River, which is in the Peace River country. The Northern 
Alberta Railway Company had installed a dam in the river near 
the village of Hythe, which interfered with the migration of 
the fish. Up to this time, the presence of such a run of 
fish had not come to the attention of the local people, though 





c

grayling under twelve inches in length were commonly caught 
throughout the summers. It was not long before everyone in 
the country was there to help themselves to the spoils and 
to watch the beautiful leaps performed by the fish as they 
attempted to surmount the six-foot falls. Few of the fish 
succeeded in overcoming the barrier unless they used the 
fish ladded provided. On many occasions, there must have 
been twenty or thirty fish in the air at one time, and the 
water below the spillway was alive with fish. Four-foot 
leaps were common in the persistent attempts made by the fish 
to reach the top. The number of fish is emphasized by the 
fact that one farmer took home a wagon*-box full of grayling 
after one afternoon of vrielding a dip net below the falls. 
Fish caught at that time ranged between fourteen and twenty- 
two inches in length. Needless to say, the practice of. 
catching the fish with dip nets together with changing stream 
conditions due to removal of forests at the headwaters, soon, 
reduced the number of grayling. Nov;, this same stream floods 
violently in the spring and is dry by midsummer. The fish 
that were observed on these early migrations must have come 
from the Wapiti River, some sixty miles by stream, for the 
Beaverlodge River was too shallow in the autumn to maintain 
fish for the winter. Fish as large as those caught on the 
spawning run were never seen in the stream at other times of 
the year. 

In all likelihood, the fish caught in our traps 
on Cold Creek in both 19^9 and 19?0 did not travel nearly

this distance. It was possible for these fish to come from, 
the Lobstick River, about eight water-miles distant; from 
Chip Lake, about fourteen miles; or from the Pembina River, 
about forty miles. There is no doubt, however, that the 
fish ran the last eight miles to the location of the traps. 
Careful observations of Cold Creek revealed no fish in the 
stream before the spawning run began. A trap was placed 
in Cold Creek in the fall of 1950 to catch all fish coming 
downstream (Trap C, Map V). This was set in place on Sep¬ 
tember 15th and maintained until October l4th. In this 
period, a total of 25 grayling, 64 northern pike ( Esox 
lucius), 11 suckers (Catostomidae) and 2 burbot ( Lota lota 
maculosa ) were captured. This would indicate that the fish 
which spend the summer in Cold Creek move out in the autumn 
to spend the winter in deeper water* In the spring of 194? 
a. trap was constructed above the one used to capture fish 
from the spawning migration (Figure 6, page 39)* It faced 
upstream in order to catch any fish that might have wintered 
above and which might possibly come downstream in the spring. 
Hot a single fish was caught in this trap. Therefore, there 
seems little doubt that the fish in Cold Creek do not spend 
the winter there, but migrate into the stream to spawn, 
spend the summer, and leave again in the fall. 

Marking Experiments in 1949

pelvic fin clipped, in the vicinity of trap B, (Map V). 

Those from Brule Creek had the right pectoral fin clipped 
and were released about three miles upstream from the Lob- 
stick River, below the beaver dams obstructing their 
migration* 

Fifteen grayling, with their left pelvic fins 
clipped, were recovered from the spawning run in 1950, at 
trap A. A larger number of similarly marked fish were cap¬ 
tured; the author was re-tagging these with numbered plastic 
tags, and had several fish in a retainer which was raided 
by local citizens before records were made of the fish con¬ 
tained therein. Two marked fish were recovered from Brule 
Creek during the run in 1950, both with the right pectoral 
fin clipped. In the autumn of 1950, four fish with the 
left pelvic fin mark were captured at trap C. The recovery 
of marked fish was small compared to the number clipped. 
Those caught came from the stream from which they were ori¬ 
ginally captured and in which they had been released* This 
possibly indicates that the fish return to the same stream 
in successive years - perhaps to the stream in which they 
hatched. The evidence is not conclusive; more marking and 
recovery over a period of several years will be required to 
provide reliable data on the movements of grayling. 

Tagging Experiments in 1950

tags of the type that are held in place by a pin inserted 
through the body below the dorsal fin c These were released 
in Cold Creek in May, 1950, in the vicinity of trap A. 
Nineteen were similarly tagged and released in the Lobstick 
River one hundred yards south of Ithe main highway. All were 
taken during the spawning runs* Those in Cold Creek included 
all recaptures from the 19^9 fin-marked fish. The reported 
recovery of these fish during the summer of 1950 was disap¬ 
pointing. Only three tagged fish were reported caught by 
anglers. It is known that many more were captured by local 
citizens, who, having no angling permits, did not report 
their catches. The tagging and recovery records are shown 
in Table XXV*

Of the three fish reported, one was caught in the 
Lobstick River and two in Cold Creek. The Lobstick recovery 
was one that had been released about half a mile downstream 
from where it was caught. The two Cold Creek fish had been 
released in this stream. One was caught just below the first 
beaver dam and as far upstream as it could travel; the other

was about half this distance upstream from where it was 
released* Apparently, the fish continued to move upstream 
after being stripped and tagged. This tendency was also 
noted when several tagged fish were recaptured by our traps 
the day following their tagging and release in the area 
below the trap. This movement upstream, after being stripped, 
was probably due to a continuation of the spawning urge. 

The fish would very likely distribute themselves along the 
stream in the favored locations for the summer months, 
drifting slowly back downstream with the onset of freeze-up. 

Winter Habitat 

An attempt was made to discover where the fish go 
after leaving the smaller streams, but the effort met with 
little success. Small mesh gill nets were set in one of the 
deep holes in the McLeod River, starting the last week in 
August, and once a week thereafter until the last week in 
September. This spot, locally known as the "Big Eddy", was 
one recommended by the people of the district. No grayling 
were caught. Reliable reports received since indicate that 
grayling were in the McLeod River during this time, but 
were located in rapids where nets could not be set. 

It seems a logical assumption that the fish would 
spend the winter in any place where sufficient depth of 
water prevents the danger of freezing to the bottom. It is 
known that many grayling spend the winter in beaver dams

such as those on. Cold Creek* One local fisherman in the 
Whitecourt area claims to have caught grayling through the 
ice in mid-winter. This was on Windfall Creek in a deep 
hole created by log-jams in the stream. A few grayling are 
captured by commercial fishermen in Lesser Slave Lake, 
mainly during the winter and spring. Many of the streams 
inhabited by grayling during the summer are too shallow 
throughout the greater part of their lengths for wintering; 
to be safe in the average pool. Thus, the grayling must 
spend the winter in the larger rivers, in the lakes, and 
in very deep pools* 


SUMMARY 

The purpose of this study has been to gather 
information regarding the biology of the Arctic grayling, 
Thymallus signifer , in Alberta in order that proper manage¬ 
ment techniques may be carried out. It is hoped the infor¬ 
mation will be useful to officials who carry out conserva¬ 
tion measures, and that it will provide a nucleus of infor¬ 
mation for those who undertake additional investigations. 
Briefly, this is what has been accomplished. 

2U A brief survey is given of Alberta streams 
known to contain grayling population, together with maps 
of these streams. 

2. A short morphological study has brought out

at least one characteristic by which the sexes may be recog¬ 
nized after they reach sizeable proportions. This may be 
useful to the angler as well as the scientific observer and 
to those engaged in field work with grayling. This study 
also indicates that no differences exist between fish from 
Alberta and Saskatchewan. They are the same species, but 

Qtre^teir 

the average size of the Saskatchewan fish is r, giving 

them a somewhat different appearance. The taxonomic measure¬ 
ments recorded in the appendix may be useful to future 
investigators. 

3* Growth rate studies indicate that the larger 
stream grayling average smaller than lake specimens. This 
is probably due to a more rigorous life and poorer food 
supply. Growth varies from stream to stream. Sexual matur¬ 
ity is reached at the end of three years of life. 

4. Grayling are very versatile in their feeding 
habits, making them an ideal fish for streams and lakes 
where the food supply acts as a limiting factor to fish 
which are more specific in the food they select. 

5* Various aspects of the spawning habits have 

been presented. The Alberta grayling spawn in May when the 

stream temperatures reach ^0° to 50° Fahrenheit. They were 

observed to spawn in the fast water of riffles in small 

gravelo The number of eggs of spawning females is in the 

■tetri 

neighborhood of 375 per ounce of fish. The number of heat 
units required to hatch the eggs is approximately 250* 

6* Evidence has been presented which indicates

that grayling do not spend the winter months in the streams 
where they pass the summers. They migrate sometimes consi¬ 
derable distances, into suitable small streams in the spring, 
and drift back out in the autumn* This makes them suitable 
for streams in which fish cannot winter successfully. They 
are valuable for providing angling in many streams that 
cannot support trout populations. Shallow streams in which 
anchor ice formation causes a poor supply of bottom food 
can be utilized by grayling because they feed extensively 
on surface food items during the summer, and do not depend 
on the stream*s bottom food in winter. 

The Arctic grayling; is therefore a very valuable 
sporting fish. They create fine fishing in streams where 
other fish could not survive for long. Their chief drawback 
is that they are relatively easy to catch, and they will, 
not live in clear mountain streams. Management practices 
should be designed which ensure that each stream continues 
to have a sufficient breeding population. Watershed protec¬ 
tion is necessary to prevent violent flooding in the spring 
and abnormally low water levels in summer with temperatures 
reaching higher than 65° Grayling also favor streams 
which are well shaded and have good bank cover.
