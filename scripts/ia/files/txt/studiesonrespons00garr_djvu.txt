STUDIES ON THE RESPONSES OF PEA VARIETIES 


TO CHEMICAL TREATMENT OF THE SEED 


Patriok Garrow 


INTRODUCTION 


The production of peas on a commercial scale is 
relatively new to Alberta, but the areas devoted to this 
crop are rapidly increasing in the irrigated areas of the 
province and in a few of the dry land farming sections* 
Peas are grown for two main purposes in 
southern Alberta, namely for canning and for a seed 
supply for the canners in eastern Canada and British 
Columbia* A small acreage is grown of the marrow fat 
varieties and a small acreage for forage purposes* 

The canning industry has increased rapidly in 
eastern Canada and in British Columbia during the past few 
years, and is starting in Alberta* The rapid increase in 
the canning industry has been accompanied by an increase 
in the number of varieties of peas being developed for the 
canning trade* It has been shown that planting peas at 
different dates does not extend the canning season to any 
extent as all plantings will be ready for the viner about 
the same time, but with a corresponding decrease in yield 
for the later plantings* This has led to the development

of varieties, suoh that all oan be sown at the same time, 
each having a natural maturity period longer than the 
preceding to enable harvesting at the most advantageous 
stage for oanning of quality peas. 

Many varieties are required to meet the testes 
of the consumers of peas. Different flavors, sizes, 
colors and many other factors influence the sole of the 
canned product. Yield is a major factor to be considered 
in the breeding of new varieties, and. as a result a large 
number of varieties have been developed. The canners, 
however, do not concern themselves with the development of 
these new varieties, but relegate this to the seedsmen. 

The ideal climate and favorable location have 
made the irrigated areas of southern Alberta exceptionally 
well adapted to the production of seed peas, and the 
acreage devoted to this phase of the industry is rapidly 
increasing. 

Although losses from disease have been light as 
yet, due probably to the industry being young, appreciable 
losses have been encountered in the pea fields from root-rot 
and other diseases in Alberta. In addition, various forms 
of foot- and seed-rot have been responsible for thinning 
out stands. The rank growth of the pea plant soon appears 
to fill in gaps caused by the thinning of the stand, however, 
and the loss due to this cause is not generally appreciated. 

A large number of varieties are grown by the seed 
companies in this area, a number of which have been observed

to Buffer to a nuch greater extent from seed- and foot-rot 
than do others, some of the chemicals used for seed 
treatment at the present time, however, have very effectively 
controlled this form of disease, and as a result of the 
advances in this respect losses to seed growers and 
oanners from the various seed- and foot-rotting organisms 
may be greatly reduced. 

LITERATURE review 


1. Varietal Differences 


Under Alberta conditions a number of varieties 
appeared to suffer to a greater extent than others from 
seed- and foot-rot. 

Some workers have indicated that certain 
varieties of peas are more resistant to seed- and foot-rot 
than others. Gilchrist (7) noted a variation in the amount 
of cuticle in the epicotyl and higher nodes and from the 
top of the epicotyl to its base at the point of attachment 
to the seed, an increase in amount of cuticle passing up 
from the base. He found varieties which were more 
susceptible to infection from Asooohyta sp. had no cuticle 
at the base of the epicotyl, whereas resistant varieties 
like ^laska and Horsford had a small amount of cuticle 
present. Jones (15) states that Surprise showed a much

greater susceptibility to basal stem injury by Mycoanhaerolla 
Dinodes than liorsfard Market Garden, llorsford Market Garden 
proved resistant to the tliree organisms Ascochyta nisi . 
Ascochyta olnodella and Lycosphaerella pinodes . while 
Perfection and Advancer were only slightly susceptible. 
Environment appeared to influence the severity of injury. 

Jones (14) also found that the applications of 
water to the soil soon after planting reduced the percentage 
of germination of untreated pea seed, and that this 
reduction was greater with the sweet v/rinkled varieties 
than with the Alaska varieties. He found that an increase 
in gemination resulted from treating seed with Semesan 
dust under various soil moisture conditions and soil 
ten^eratures. But in general the sweet wrinkled varieties 
were more bene fitted than was the Alaska variety. With the 
Alaska variety a good stand of plants was insured as a 
result of treatment regardless of moisture or temperature 
conditions. Seed treatment with a mercury dust Semesan 
(15) increased the height and vigor of stands and gave a 
marked reduction in the number of plants having foot-rot 
caused by Ascochyta pinode11a or uycosphaerella pinodes . 

Other workers (2) have observed similar results. 

Corn varieties show differences in response to 
the same seed treatment (11, 25). Starr, from his work at 
Minnesota, reports that sometimes no benefits were obtained 
from treatment of corn seed, and even decreases in yield 
were obtained. He suggests that the weather conditions

following planting were the most important factor in this 
respect, although condition of the seed, and location of 
the trials may be of some linportance. He found differences 
in varietal response varied with locality and season, but 
in general that Semesan Jr. shortened the germinating 
period of sweet com varieties. 

Barley also has been shown to exhibit varietal 
differences in response to seed treatment (21, 27). 

Dillon Weston, Hanley and Booer (6) observed an increase in 
the speed of "brairding" in barley, but not in the final 
population. The hastened seedling growth did not increase 
yields. Their results indicate that the different organic 
dusts did not speed up "brairding" of all cereals to the 
same extent. 

Skaptason (24) noted a difference in response of 
varieties of wheat to seed treatment with formaldehyde. 
Varieties of oats and barley exhibited a similar varietal 
response to treatment with formaldehyde. 

Peas (12) have been observed to give laarked 
response to seed treatment with Red Copper Oxide in green¬ 
house experiments, and accelerated emergence was observed 
in the Perfection variety. 

2. Organic Jfercury Compounds for Seed Treatment 


The organic mercury compounds were used first as 


disinfectants in medicine. In 1912 organic mercury

compounds were introduce? 1 as seed disinfectants in Germany. 
Riehm (22, 23) along with others found then effective in 
cereal disease control. 

The first of the mercury compounds for seed 
treatment to be placed on the market was a chlorophenol 
mercury oorapound known as "Uspulu S' 9 Introduced in 1915. 
Similar confounds appeared in the United States in 1921 
under trade names "Chlorophol" and "Seraesan". In the early 
stages these organic materials were all used as "wet 
treatments". 

In 1922 (4) organic mercury dusts were used 
experimentally in the United States and various compounds 
appeared on the market. In 1927 ethyl mercury chloride was 
put on the market as Ceressn and in 1931 ethyl mercury 
phosphate was brought out as Mew Improved Geresan. Dillon 
veston and Booer at Cambridge in England (5) investigated 
a range of meroury compounds to produce an effective seed 
disinfectant of known composition, following which two 
mercury compounds "Standard Leytosan" and "Leytosan P" 
were put on the market in England in 1934 which, with Hew 
Improved Ceresan, have gradually been replacing most other 
forms of seed disinfectants in Canada. 

For such seeds as flax and peas, etc., the dust 
fungicides are of exceptional value, and although liquid 
fungicides are by no means discarded for other grains they 
are gradually being replaced by the mercury dust seed 
treatments.

Many claims of stimulation have been made for 
mercurial dusts, but Dillon Weston and Booer (5) found no 
evidence of stimulation in the sense of a tonic effect* 

They suggest that the noticeably better germination, crop 
growth and yield ore due not only to the control of seed- 
borne diseases but to the preservation of the food reserves 
in the seed from the attack of soil organisms, Brett, Dillon 
Weston, Booer (3) state this work indicates that the effect 
of the fungicidal dusts used in their experiments is due to 
the protection of the cotyledons from the depredations of 
soil organisms, thus maintaining a relatively high proportion 
of the food materials for the developing plantlets. 

Although it might be inferred from their results that the 
effect of such dusts was one of stimulation, in controlled 
experiments in sterile media with a number of different seed 
species they have never obtained any significant stimulation, 
and are of the opinion that any effect which might be inter¬ 
preted as stimulation is due entirely to the protection 
afforded to the seed and its food reserves, 

OBJECTS OF THE IKTOSTIGaTIOH 


The purpose of this investigation ?/as primarily 
to determine whether varieties of garden and canning peas 
respond differently to seed treatment with Leytosan P, and 
to determine if possible the reasons for any difference 
found. Also to determine the relative fungicidal or

protective value of Leytosan P and New Improved Ceresan for 
different varieties of peas against soil and seed-borne 
parasites of which a number are known to cause seed and 
foot-rot of the pea (3, 7, 13, 14, 15)* 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 


The Ley too an P used in this work was very kindly 
donated by Hockin & Dougherty Limited, Vancouver agents 
for F. W. Berk & Colony, Limited, London, Kngland. It 
contains 3# mercury present as methyl mercury dihydrogen 
phosphate (CH^HgHgPO^) with the inert filler of china clay 
(kaolin)* Professor Burn of the Pharmaceutical Society of 
Great Britain describes relative toxicity tests on mice by 
oral administration and fixes the relative toxicity of 
this methyl mercury phosphate as 1.6 times that of 
corrosive sublimate (mercuric chloride, HgClg). Leytosan P 
contains 4.7$ methyl mercury phosphate which makes it 
roughly l/10th as toxic as mercuric chloride. 

The manufacturers regard the fungicidal power of 
this lercurial dust as something that depends upon local 
conditions. But they state that the methyl mercury 
compounds, as a whole, are by far the most fungicidal 
compounds they have met. 

The New Improved Ceresan used in this work is an 
ethyl mercury phosphate, the ethyl mercury phosphate 
totalling 5$ with the mercury equivalent of 3.8$. The 
inert ingredients total 95$.

The seed was obtained from a single source, 
where conditions of production were as nearly the same as 
Is possible under large scale production. Thanks are due 
here to the Grimm Alfalfa Seed Grov/ers of Alberta, Limited, 
at Brooks, who so kindly donated the seed for tills 
Investigation. This Company operates at Brooks in the 
Eastern Irrigation Project in southern Alberta where all 
seed is grown with irrigation, the rainfall being extremely 
light during the months of June, July, August and 
September. Official germination tests by the Dominion 
Seed Branch show all varieties used in this work to have a 
germination rating over 90$. 

For all field tests at Brooks, the seed was 
treated one week prior to seeding, at the rate of S ounces 
per bushel with Leytosan P and i ounce per bushel with Hew 
Improved Ceresan. The amall seed lots for the trial plot 
tests were shaken up in a glass stoppered flask with the 
required amount of dust for a few minutes, then any excess 
dust removed and the seed stored in envelopes until seeding 
time. For the large scale field trials, the seed was 
treated in the large seed treater which the Grimm Alfalfa 
Seed Company uses for treating cereal grains cosmercially 
with standard Leytosan. This machine consists of a large 
steel barrel of ten bushel capacity, fitted with baffles to 
insure a thorough nix of the grain and mercury dust. The 
barrel revolves on a shaft from power supplied by a § horse 
power dynamo. The seed was treated and stored in strong 
3emis white cotton bags until seeding time.

For the greenhouse trials at the University of 
Alberta the seed was shaken up in a glass stoppered flask 
with the required quantity of dust and placed in envelopes 
for 48 hours prior to seeding. 

The tests in the greenhouse were made in three 
parts Edmonton soil, a heavy black loam, and one part sand. 
All tests were conducted in non-steril© soil, with the 
exception of those in which it is specifically mentioned 
that sterilized soil was used. The temperatures ivere 
thermostatically controlled. Artificial light was 
supplied in the experiment to observe the effect of seed 
treatment on plant growth. The artificial light was 
supplied from dusk at 5 o’clock to 12 o’clock at night. 


THE RELATIVE RESPONSES OF PEA VARIETIES TO SEED 
TREATMENT IK THE FIELD 


Field trials were conducted at Brooks and at 
Edmonton. The Brooks area is located in the dry belt of 
southern Alberta where the moisture is supplied by 
irrigation. The soil here is a light brown loam. The 
soil at Edmonton is a heavy black loam located in an area 
of considerable rainfall. The season is approximately two 
weeks earlier at Brooks than at Edmonton.

Trial Plot Tests with Two Mercury Dusts at Brooks 


The following twelve varieties were selected 

for the trials at Brooks: 

Tall Telephone 
Daisy 
Btratagem 
Thomas Laxton 
Laxton Progress 
Surprise 

Hors ford 

Perfection 

Hundredfold 

Little Marvel 

Alaska 

Linooln 

The first six varieties showed varying degrees 
of injury from seed- and foot-rot at Brooks, while the 
second six showed relatively little damage from this cause 
at Brooks. 

^xper iraental I le thod . 

Line hundred seeds of each variety were 3own, 300 
treated with Leytosan P, 300 seeds with Hew Improved Ceresan, 
and 300 seeds used for a control. The seeds were sown 2 
inches deep, 100 seeds per IS-foot row, three rows of each 
constituting a plot (Figure 1). The seed was treated ?/ith 
leytosan P at the rate of 2 ounces per bushel, and with 
Hew Improved Ceresan at the rate of £ ounce per bushel, 
one week prior to planting. The dust was added to the 
seed in a glass stoppered flask and thoroughly shaken up. 

The seed was then transferred to envelopes where it was 
left until reedy for planting.

The thin ragged stand of a control plot of Stratagem 
is shown in the foreground with a thick luxuriant 
growth of Stratagem treated with Leytosan P in the 
background. 



Figure 2 

Omitting the first row, 3 three-rowed plots of 
Stratagem are shown above. The first treated with 
Leytosan P, the second with Geresan and the third 
can be readily recognized as the control plot with 
its patchy stand.

The seed was sown in the following order: three 
rows of 100 seeds eaoh treated with Leytosan P, three rows 
of seed treated with New Improved Ceresan, and three rows 
of seed not treated, as a control (Figure 2). Figures 3 and 
4 picture the effect of seed treatment on Horsford and Tall 
Telephone varieties. The soil was quite moist at the time 
of planting on May 8th, and was well supplied with moisture 
throughout the growing season in the form of irrigation 
water. Three irrigations were ample to bring the plants 
through to maturity. A record of the rainfall with the 
maximum and minimum temperatures for the raonth of May are 
recorded in Table I. 

Emergence counts were made for each plot, and 
the total emergence for each recorded and expressed as a 
percentage of the number of seeds sown per plot. 

These data were not statistically analyzed, 
because the tests were not replicated. They have been 
presented here because they were considered of value in 
that they do indicate a varietal difference in response to 
seed treatment with mercury dusts under field conditions. 
Also the influence of locality and environment on seed 
treatment is indicated in later comparisons.

The emergence data shew very little difference 
between seed treated with Leytosan P and New Improved Ceresan. 
All varieties used in this experiment responded to seed 
treatment with these two dusts in the same order, although 
individual varieties do exhibit differences in response, for 
exanple, Tall Telephone, Stratagem and Little Marvel respond 
to Leytosan P to a greater degree than to New Improved 
Ceresan. Daisy responded similarly to both, while all other 
varieties responded more to seed treatment vrith New 
Improved Ceresan, especially liorsfard, Perfection and 
Alaska.

The yields do not seem to hold as close a relationship to 
emergence numbers in the New Improved Cere3an tests as 
in the tests with Leytosan P, with three exceptions, 
Horsford, Little Marvel and Lincoln. All varieties give a 
greeter yield as a result of seed treatment with leytosan 
P than with New Improved Ceresan, although the differences 
are not great.

Trial Plot Tests with Leytosan P at Brooks 


The tests with Leytosan P at Brooks are con¬ 
sidered separately here to facilitate comparison with 
similar tests conducted at the University of Alberta trial 
grounds under the direction of Dr. A, W. Henry at that 
institution. A statistical comparison was not possible, 
however, since the plots were not replicated nor laid out 
at Brooks in such a manner as to make this possible. 

Experimental Results . 

Table IV presents the emergence counts from 
plots where the seed was treated with Leytosan P, and the 
control plots, expressed in percent of the total number 
of seeds planted per plot. 

It will be noted from Table IV that those six 
varieties previously observed to incur considerable damage 
from seed- and foot-rot in the field at Brooks, show a 
marked increase in emergence as a result of seed treatment 
with Leytosan P, whereas those varieties noticed to be 
more resistant to the attack of the seed- and foot-rotting 
organisms do not show a very great iner-ease in emergence 
as a result of seed treatment; Alaska, in fact, shows a 
reduced emergence.

per acre. 

The varieties show e different individual order 
in emergence number to that of yield, although the general 
order is similar. Daisy, Tall Telephone and Stratagem 
give a marked response in yield over other varieties. 
Laxton Progress, Hundredfold, Thomas Laxton, Perfection, 
Surprise, Horsford and Alaska appear to be intermediate, 
while Little Marvel shows only a slight response, 

Lincoln shows a negative response.

Trial Plot Tests with Leytosan P at Edmonton 


Table VI presents the emergence counts in the 
University trial grounds at Edmonton* These trials were 
conducted by Ur* Henry at the University of Alberta and 
consisted of 3-row plots replicated five times and 
randomized. Seed treatment was made in a similar manner 
to that at Brooks. The data were taken from the center 
rows of the plots. In the Edmonton trials five varieties 
were included, not included at Brooks, namely Alderman, 
Advancer, Laxton Superb, American Wonder and a field pea, 
Golden Vine.

The first 11 varieties indicated above gave significant 
increases in emergence when treated with Leytosan P. 

To be significant the difference must exceed 8.8. 


Comparing those varieties grown at Brooks with 
the same varieties grown at Edmonton, Little Marvel gave 
little response to the seed treatment at Brooks due 
primarily to the fact that it did not suffer from seed- 
rot to the extent that it does when grown at Edmonton. 

Tall Telephone gave a greater response to treatment when 
grown at Brooks than when grown at Edmonton for the sane 
reason that the Little Marvel gave the greater response at

Edmonton. Alaska responds favorably at Edmonton, while at 
Brooks it shows a decreased emergence as a result of seed 
treatment. 

Table VII presents the average yield in bushels 
per acre for the Edmonton trials. The Brooks yields 
exhibit marked differences between treated and non-treated 
plots for all varieties with the exception of Lincoln and 
Little Marvel, whereas differences in yields at Edmonton 
were significant for only Stratagem and Alderman, although 
there was considerable difference between treated and non- 
treated plots of Horsford, Tall Telephone and Daisy. 
Horsford at Edmonton gives a marked increase in yield, 
while the increased percent emergence was not great. 
Hundredfold exhibits a reduced yield, while the percent 
emergence was markedly increased. Alaska exhibits a reduced 
yield as a result of seed treatment at Edmonton, while at 
Brooks it responds favorably; the reverse is true fbr 
Lincoln, although the response at Edmonton is not very 
great. With one or two exceptions there appears, however, 
to be a general relationship in yield increase as a result 
of seed treatment between Edmonton and Brooks trials.

These experiments have demonstrated varietal 
resnonse to seed treatment. This relative response, 
however, may be influenced by moisture, temperature, soil 
flora and other factors. These factors may be responsible 
for the lack of relationship between some of the varieties 
in the Brooks and Edmonton trials. Wallace and Henry (10) 
have demonstrated a marked difference in germinations and 
rate of germination of different varieties at different 
temperatures. As the varieties in each of these experiments 
were grown under the sarae conditions of temperature and

24 


moisture, these naturally were not optimum for all varieties, 
as the longer the seed takes to germinate the greater the 
damage from soil-borne organisms and the less possibility 
for emergence. Hence these relationships might not hold 
for another set of conditions. 

Large Scale Field Trials with Leytosan P at Brooks 


Field tests were conducted on a large scale at 
Brooks in three of the contract fields of peas for the 
Grimm -alfalfa Seed Growers Limited. The varieties used were 
Stratagem, Thomas Lax ton and Lax ton Progress. The seed was 
treated with Leytosan P at the rate of 2 ounces per bushel 
one week prior to seeding, and sown with the grain drill 
in the same manner as the other fields were sown. The 
peas here were sown at the rate of 120 pounds per acre in 
double rows 28 inches apart, the double rows being 6 
inches apart. 

Emergence counts were made 30 days after planting. 
Counts were made on nine feet of double row, selected at 
random. The figures in Table VIII shew/ the average of 50 
such counts. The difference is expressed as percent of 
the control. 

These figures indicate a marked benefit from the 
seed treatment in the increased population. Under field 
conditions Stratagem shows a greater benefit from seed 
treatment than either Thomas Laxton or Laxton Progress.

RELATIVE RESPONSES OP PEA VARIETIES TO SEED 
TREATMENT IN THE GREENHOUSE 


Effect of Leytosan P on Emergence of Pour 
Varieties of Peas 


The first greenhouse experiment was conducted to 

determine the effect of Leytosan P, a proprietary dust, 
on the emergence of different varieties of peas. Four 
varieties were selected, two early varieties, Alaska and 
Thomas laxton, and two late varieties, Horsford and Tall 
Telephone. 

Experimental Method . 

Three hundred and sixty seeds of each variety were 
sown, one-half being treated with Leytosan P at the 
reeomended rate of 2 ounces per bushel. The seed was 
placed in a glass stoppered flask and the mercury dust

added and thoroughly shaken up. The seed was treated 48 
hours prior to seeding. The other 180 seeds were sown as 
a oontrol. The seeds were planted in two parts Edmonton 
soil, a heavy black loam, with one part send, in crocks 
12 inohes deep by 8 inches in diameter, 10 seeds per crock 
making 36 crooks of each variety, 144 in all. The seed 
was covered to a depth of inohes, and the soil watered 
by means of placing the crocks in water pans until the 
surface of the soil appeared moist. All crocks received 
the same amount of moisture as closely as could be 
determined, and were kept in the greenhouse where the 
temperature was maintained at 65°F. with the soil 
approximately 12°C. All varieties were randomized and the 
crocks moved three times on the greenhouse bench to reduce 
the error as much as possible. 

Experimental Results . 

Emergence counts were made, and are presented 
in Table IX with a complete analysis of variance to 
determine their significance in Table X.

Jones (14, 15) found that the sweet wrinkled 
varieties responded to treatment with a mercury dust more 
so than did Alaska, a smooth-seeded variety. He found 
Horsford Market Garden to be resistant to Aseoohyta foot- 
rot, which variety the author has also observed to show 
relatively light injury from any form of seed or foot-rot 
in the pea fields at 3rooks. Tall Telephone, however, was 
observed to suffer considerable reduction in emergence 
number and many seedlings after emergence in the field 
failed to reach maturity. 

It will he observed from Table IX that there is 
a significant difference in emergence in all cases, but in 
an ascending order from Alaska which is baraly significant 
to Tall Telephone which shows a marked increase in emergence 
of seedlings from treated seed over that of the non-treated. 

A noticeable feature in the experiment was the 
fact that in Alaska and Thomas Laxton the treated seed

germinated much more rapidly than the non-treeted; this 
was the case In the Tall Telephone, but not to the same 
extent as In the Alaska and Thomas Lax ton. The Horsford 
Market Garden showed little difference. 

The Inference which might be drawn from this 
experiment Is that the mercurial dust had a tonic effect 
on the seed resulting in increased emergence and rate of 
emergence from the treating of the seed (12). 

In this experiment if the rate of emergence can 
be accepted as an indication of stimulation then the 
Alaska variety responds to the tonic effect of the methyl 
mercury phosphate. Figure 5 shows graphically the 
increased rate of emergence of the treated seed over the 
non-treated seed. Here the total emergence of both treated 
and controls show little difference at the end of 5 days, 
but at the end of the third day the treated shows a much 
increased emergence over the control. As both lots were 
relatively free from disease, the increased rate of 
germination or emergence can be attributed to the treatment. 

Similar results were obtained by Horsfall et al 
(12) in treating Perfection peas with red copper oxide. 

The accelerated emergence of the Alaska peas may 
be the result of a bichemical effect. The chemical may be 
broken down liberating the phosphate which, as is generally 
known, accelerates germination growth and yield. The 
amount of phosphate present, however, would not seem to be 
of sufficient quantity to have any great stimulating effect.

Lundegardh (17) has shown where neroury In certain 
quantities has a stimulating effect on comminution on 
certain varieties. Probably it might be the action of the 
raoroury rather than the phosphate. This possible stimula¬ 
ting effect was not apparent in the other varieties due to 
the greater amount of disease present in the oontrol to 
which the reduced rate of germination could be attributed. 

Effect of Eevtosan P on Emergence of Eight 
Varieties of Peas 


A second experiment was conducted with a larger 
number of varieties to determine if the variations manifest 
in the varieties used in the first experiment would be 
evident in those selected for this trial. 

Experimental Method . 

Four additional varieties were selected and 140 
seeds of each sown, 10 seeds per pot, in pots 7 inches in 
diameter; 70 seeds treated vrith Leytosan P in a similar 
manner to that used in the first experiment and 70 seeds 
used as a control. The seeds were sown and covered to a 
depth of lj inches. Moisture was added as in the first 
experiment, and the greenhouse maintained at a constant 
temperature of 65°F. All treatments and varieties were

The results here again indicate a beneficial 
effect and a difference in response of varieties to the 
use of Leytosan P as a fungicide* In all oases there is 
a significant difference between the oontrols and the 
treated seed. Horsford Market Garden shows the least 
response to treatment, giving the greatest germination 
from the non-treated seed and the least germination from 
the treated seed* The e^erinent demonstrates a gradual 
increase in response from Horsford in an ascending order 
to Little Marvel. 

Effect of Seed Treatment on Plant Growth 


To demonstrate a possible effect on growth as 
well as emergence as a result of seed treatment it was 
thought advisable to follow the plant growth through to 
maturity, to note the effect, if any, of seed treatment on 
growth, and blossoming to determine if the varietal 
difference noted in emergence continued throughout the 
life of the plant. 

Four varieties were selected, Thomas Laxton, 
Horsford Market Garden, Alaska and Tall Telephone, the 
varieties used in the first experiment for emergence 
determination.

Experimental rethod . 

Three hundred and sixty seeds were planted, 10 
seeds per crook. One hundred and eighty seeds were treated 
with Leytosan P at the rate of 2 ounces per bushel, the 
seeds were placed In a glass stoppered flask and shaken up 
thoroughly with the Leytosan 48 hours prior to planting. 
Crooks, 12 inches deep with 8-inch diameter, with glazed 
outer surface to prevent evaporation, were filled with a 
mixture of 2 parts Edmonton black loam and 1 part sand. 

The seed was covered to a depth of Is inches and water 
absorbed from the watering pans through the opening in the 
base of the crock until the surface appeared moist. The 
greenhouse temperature was maintained at approximately 
65°F. throughout the growing period, and artificial light 
was supplied for a 7-hour period from 5.00 p.n. to 12.00 
p.m. each evening. 

When emergence was couplet© the plants were 
thinned out, leaving two plants per crock. The growth was 
measured and recorded; these measurements \rere made until 
growth appeared to be complete. It was originally 
intended to carry this experiment through to maturity of 
the plants to determine yield, but the greenhouse conditions 
were not conducive to blossoming. 

Experimental Results . 

Table XIII presents a record of measurements 
made, expressed as the average growth in inches of the 
treated and non-treated plants for each variety.

Figure 6 

Plant growth from treated and non-treated seed. The 
top line represents growth from the treated seed. 



















Tram the results of this experiment (Figure 6 
and Table XIII) and observations not reoorded, facts 
observed by the author, the plants from the treated seed 
as a whole made a better growth than the oontrol plants• 
The Tall Telephone variety showed a greater response to 
treatment as shown in the graph than any of the others: 
Thomas Lexton, Alaska, then Horsford* The Tall Telephone 
control plants showed a greater number of plants stunted, 
dwarfed and killed as a result of parasitism by the seed- 
end foot-rotting organisms present, than did any of the 
others* A number of the control plants wore equally as 
good and some better than the plants from the treated seed, 
however* Tall Telephone shows the greatest increase and 
Horsford the least* In the case of the liorsford variety 
there appeared to be relatively little difference. The 
control plants did not suffer from the ravages of the foot- 
rotting organism to the extent of the Telephone variety 
and appeared in most cases to make equally as good growth 
as the treated lot* Alaska showed a greater response than 
did : th^ Horsford, but not to the extent of the other 
varieties. 

A marked difference was noted in the increased 
number of plants with three blossoms in the Thomas Laxton 
treated over the oontrol although both lots started to 
blossom at the same time* In the case of the Alaska, 
although both lots started blossoming at the same time 
there were no cases of plants with three blossoms in the 
control.

Although conditions v;ere apparently not conducive 
to blossoming in the greenhouse, the mercury dust 
comparatively did favour the increased number of blossoms. 
The experiment shows a more marked benefit of treated seed 
over non-treated in the following order: Tall Telephone, 
Thomas Laxton, Alaska and Iloraford. This benefit, 
however, cannot be accepted as evidence of plant stimu¬ 
lation because some of the plants from non-treatcd seed 
were equally as strong and vigorous as the treated plants, 
in many instances the check plants were better than many 
of the treated, but in the control lots there were a number 
of weak, sickly plants that were not present in the treated 
lots. The greater number of weak plants in the Tall 
Telephone over the other varieties is evidence of the 
greater susceptibility of Tall Telephone to the seed- and 
foot-rotting organisms, and for this reason the increased 
average grcrth of the plants from treated seed over the 
control should not be interpreted as stimulation of growth 
due to seed treatment.

Five replica ten of each treatment, control, New 
Improved Cerenan and leytosan P, including eight 
varieties, namely, Perfection, llorsford, Alaska, Little 
Marvel, Thomas Laxton, Tall Telophone, Surprise and 
Ltratagem, were planted in a similar manner to the last 
two experiments. Leytosan was added at the rate of 2 
ounoes per bushel and New Improved Ceresan at the rate of 
& ounce per bushel, the seed being shaken up with the 
dust in a glass stoppered flask 48 hours prior to seeding. 
The seed was covered to a depth of l*r inches and water 
added in a light spray. The second day the pots were 
given a heavy application of water. The soil used in 
this experiment had been used for emergence tests of a 
previous experl enfc but was thoroughly screened over a 
fine iassh screen before being used. Emergence counts 
were made every day after the first plants appeared.

to be the greatest for stratagem and deoreasing in value 
for the other varieties in the following order: surprise, 
Tall Telephone, Horsfbrd, Little Marvel, Alaska, Thomas 
Laxton and Perfection, The varieties responded in a 
different order to New Improved Ceresan as follows: 
Stratagem, Tall Telephone, Little Marvel, Surprise, 
llorsford, Alaska, Thomas Laxton and Perfection. 

With the exception of Perfection which shows a 
significant decrease in emergence from the treated seed, 
all other varieties exhibit a significant increase in 
emergence number. 

Many of the seedlings died shortly after 
emergence and a number appeared sickly, a fact which may 
be attributed to the use of the soil from previous pea 
emergence tests in which soil the number of seed- and foot- 
rotting organisms had undoubtedly increased greatly in 
number as a result of contamination from previously rotted 
seeds. The heavy application of water the second day after 
planting probably had some effect on delaying emergence 
(15) resulting in a greater number of seeds being rotted. 
For Alaska, Little Marvel, Tall Telephone and Horsford, 

New Improved Ceresan gives a significant increase in 
emergence number over Leytosan P, and also gives a slirht 
increase in the Thomas Laxton. The Leytosan P proved 
superior for Perfection, Surprise and Stratagem, although 
not significantly so in this test.

This experiment has not shown the varieties 
included to respond in the same order as that found in 
field and previous greenhouse tests, which fact further 
emphasizes the possibility of a variety responding to 
different treatments in different ways under the various 
combinations of moisture, temperature, soil and other 
possible factors, 

Effect of Eeed Treatment with Leytosan P 
on Emergence in Sterilized noil 


The two previous experiments demonstrate a 
varietal response to treatment with Leytosan P and indicate 
a stimulating effect from this proprietary dust. To 
determine whether or not it was actual stimulation or 
merely an increased emergence and rate of emergence due to 
control of the parasitic fungi, an experiment was conducted 
using sterilized soil. This experiment was identical in 
all respects to the last with the exception that 
sterilized soil was used. Unfortunately the sterilized 
soil would not absorb the water from the pans and the soil 
had to be watered from the surface. 

Experimental Results . 

Emergence counts were made and are presented in 
Table XVI and a couplete analysis of variance in Table XVII.

interpreted as a direot chemioal stimulus to the seed, 
but the differences here are not significant. 

This experiment demonstrates that if there is 
any stimulating effeot in the two varieties, stratagem 
and Little Marvel, from Leytosan P, this tonic effect is 
not significant. Rather does it show a detrimental effeot 
on seed when there is no disease factor present. Ilorsford 

i*4 

Market Garden evidences a significant detrimental effect 
as a result of treatment with the dust under controlled 
conditions of sterilized media, which is not surprising 
because of the relative small response under normal 
conditions. 

This lack of evidence of stimulation here nay 
be attributable to the fact that the sterilized soil lacks 
the microflora necessary to liberate the phosphate from 
the compound. Here there was no bichemical action, and 
the mercurial dust probably remained constant for a longer 
period of time. It is possible that in the dust form it 
may exert an injurious effect on the seed, as indicated 
in this experiment. The variation in varieties may be an 
indication of their resistance to injury from the Hg ion 
(17).

THE EFFECT OF LEYT03AN P 01, THE DEGREE OF SEED 
ROTTING OF TEN V^I^TIEo OF PEAS 


Infeotion Rating at 15 Days 


Emergence counts did not give a 00115 )lete picture 
of the situation, although they do give in a general way 
the order of response of varieties to such treatment. 

They do not, however, give the degree of damage to the 
seed, or in other words, the susceptibility of the varieties 
to attack from soil-borne organisms. In some varieties, 
although emergence counts might be high, the seedlings 
emerging night not survive due to the rotting of the seed 
induced by soil-borne organisms. The seed may be rotted 
although emergence was accom)lished. 

An experiment was conducted to determine an 
infection rating for a number of varieties of pees. Ten 
varieties were selected, Daisy and a marrowfat variety, 

Jap Sweet Wrinkled, being included. 

Experimental Method . 

There were nine replicates of each (control and 
treated^ variety and five replicates of each variety in 
sterilized soil as a further check. The seed was dusted 
at the rate of 2 ounces per bushel in a similar manner to 
that used in previous experiments. Fifty seeds per pot

were planted, 1 inch deep. All pots were iven a naxlmn 
amount of moisture and the temperature of the greenhouse 
maintained at 60°?., (a high temperature and high moisture 
content are conducive to increased disease of the seed 
(2, 14)) and soil from 10° to 18 °C. 

After 15 days the seeds were removed from the 
soil and examined, and the seeds scored from 1 to 5, 1 
being entirely free from rot and 5 being con?)letely rotted. 

Experimental Results . 

The results of this experiment are presented in

In this experiment an accompanying check was 
inoluded in which treated and non-treated seed was sown in 
sterilized soil. At the end of the 15-day period all 
varieties with the exception of Daisy showed complete 
freedom from any form of rot in the treated and non-treated 
seed. (The! Daisy showed a high percent of seed-rot in both 
treated and non-treated seed. This would indicate that Vfche 
Daisy harbored an internally-borne parasite or parasites 
that are not controlled by the Leytosan P. 

These data show the difference in infection 
rating between treated and non-treated seed in an ascending 
order from Korsford to Little Marvel, with the difference 
significant in all cases but to the greatest extent in 
Little Marvel and the least in Horsford. Daisy will not be 
taken into consideration because of the apparently seed- 
borne organisms which were not controlled by Leytosan P.

Infection Hating at 10 Days 


In the previous experiment the rotting in some 
of the varieties had readied a well advanced stage. It was 
thought that examination of the seed at an earlier stage 
might give a greater difference between varieties, that is f 
would make varietal differences probably more striking. 
Consequently this experiment was repeated with all varieties 
and the infection rating determined at 10 days after 
planting. The temperature and moisture were kept as close 
to that of the previous experiment as was possible. 

Experimental Results . 

The results of this experiment are presented in

With the exception of Horsford Market Garden 
there is a significant difference betvreen the treated and 
non-treated seed of all varieties, and between a number of 
varieties themselves. The order of varieties here shows a 
somewhat different sequence to that of the last experiment. 

This would appear to be due to the rate of action 
of the organisms present on the seed. Thomas Laxton and 
Little Marvel show comparatively less decomposition in the 
early stages than they show at the 15-day period. 

These experiments indicate a variation in rate of 
rotting among the varieties, which may be interpreted as 
further indication of susceptibility of the varieties to 
the seed-rot organisms present. 

The rate of germination and emergence in these 
two trials was reduced considerably, probably due to the 
increased amount of water added to the soil. The compara¬ 
tive rate of the germination of the treated and non-treated

seed was noted, however, and found to be greater for the 
treated seed, evidence in support of the theory of 
stimulation duo to treatment. For this information the 
germination rato of the treated seed was compared with 
the germination rate of only viable seeds of the control 
that appeared to be free from disease. 

In General it may be stated that the results of 
these two experiments are similar to those from the 
emergence experiments. That is, that Horsford and Alaska 
show relatively little response to the seed treatment, 
while little Marvel, Tall Telephone and Stratagem exhibit 
considerable benefit, with other varieties intermediate 
in response, no one variety holding any constant position, 
probably due to the effect of moisture, temperature and 
other factors. 

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF INTERNAL SEED-BORNE ORGANISMS 


Experimental Method . 

In order to determine the possible significance 
of internal seed-borne organisms, a number of varieties 
of peas was selected and 100 seeds of each v/ere surface 
sterilised with Leytosan P for 40 hours, and 10 seeds were 
plated out in each of 10 potato dextrose agar plates, a 
second series of 100 seeds was surface sterilized with 
HgClg, mercury chloride, 1-1000, for 3 minutes and plated

out in a similar manner. A third series was surface 
sterilized with the mercuric ohloride solution for 5 
minutes and plated out. 

Ten days after plating the seeds were all 
examined for the presence of disease, and a reoord made. 

Experimental Results . 

The following Table XXII shows the Daisy to be 
the only variety with internal seed-borne organisms 
present, or if present not controlled by Leytosan P or 
mercuric chloride.

a number of organisms seensd to be present in 
the seeds of the variety Daisy. Two species of bacteria 
appeared consistently, w a w producing a whitish, smooth 
slimy colony, the other, "B", a roughened ridged, rubbery 
colony, turning dark brown in the later stages, a number 
of fungi were present including species of Penici Ilium , 
and the others producing a downy growth on the pea, 
varying in color from white to red, black, green and 
yellow. The bacterium species "B w appeared to produce 
the most rapid decomposition of the pea seed, reducing it 
to a cheesy texture readily cut with a knife blade. 

This organism, bacterium species "B", was plated 
out on agar prepared from the seed extract of different 
varieties of peas and the rate of growth observed. There 
appeared to be no consistent differences in rate of growth 
on any of the extract media that was exhibited by Pusariuia 
I artii and a Bacterium species reported elsewhere. Growth 
was very mch more rapid on potato dextrose agar than was 
the case with the other Bacterium species isolated by 
Wallace• 

This particular variety of peas, Daisy, has for 
the past three years given a consistently poor stand at 
Brooks. This has been attributed to drill damage, hard 
seeds, and soil infested with organisms causing various 
forms of seed- and foot-rots. Daisy is a dwarf variety 
and the large pods often touch the ground, becoming wet and 
sometimes their own weight forces the pod tips into the

organisms, Leytosan P is ineffective as a form of seed 
treatment. No known form of surface sterilization would 
be effective in the oontrol of the internal-borne 
organisms. A form of treatment similar to the hot water 
treatment far smut would probably be the only form of 
successful oontrol, which treatment would not be desirable 
for peas. 

A laboratory test of suspicious samples would be 
of considerable value in determining the presence of 
internal-borne organisms to ascertain the probable perform¬ 
ance of the seed and the economic value of treatment with 
any surface disinfectant or seed protectant. 

THE EFFECT OF SEED EXTRACTS OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES 

ON THE GROWTH OF TWO SEED-ROTTING ORGANISE 

. .... - ■■■— 

Experimental Eetiiod . 

Two organisms isolated by H. v/allace from rotted 
pea seed grown in Edmonton soil, one identified as Fusarlum 
Marti! and one a Bacterium species, V7ere found to be 
capable of rotting seeds of all varieties of peas grown 
here.

as a result of the apparent greater susceptibility 
of some varieties to disease produced by these organisms 
an experiment was made to observe their growth on agar 
prepared from seed extraot of various pea varieties. 

Seeds of different varieties of peas were ground 
in a Wiley mill and equal quantities added to agar. The 
agar was strained a number of tine 3 through oheesecloth 
to clear it, and equal quantities wore added to petri 
dishes. The organism was added to the centre of each 
plate, and ths rate of growth was determined by recording 
the increase of the diameter of the colonies in mm. 

iSxperinental He suits . 

The rate of growth of the Fusarlum Marti! is 
shown in Table XXIII. As the growth was so close for a 
number of varieties it was difficult to show graphically, 
so the growth of only four varieties is shown in figure 8. 
Here it will be seen the rate of growth is much more rapid 
for Tall Telephone, intermediate for Thomas Laxton and 
considerably slower far Alaska and Horsford, which is in 
accordance with the effect of Leytosan P on emergence of 
these varieties, Horsford and Alaska showing the least 
difference in treatment and control and Tall Telephone and 
Thomas Laxton showing the greater difference. An interesting 
feature noticed was that Pusarium Marti! growing on Tall 
Telephone extract showed a decided red pigmentation at 
an early date, on other pea extract media, Pas arjum Marti!

developed varying degrees of redness. Colonies on the 
Surprise extract agar showed no indication of pi^nentation 
at any stage, while colonies on Stratagem extraot agar 
developed a dull red over the entire plate at a later date.

The rate of growth of the Bacterium sp. was 
measured in a similar manner to the Fusarlun Martil and 
is recorded in Table XXIV and the growth of four 
varieties represented graphically in Figure 9. 

Here the rate of growth was reversed, the more 
rapid growth taking place on the Alaska and Horsford agar 
while the more slow growth took place on the Tall 
Telephone and Little Marvel agar with intermediate rates 
on the other varieties.

The rate of growth on all the agars of this 
Bacterium sp• was relatively slow compared to the rapidity 
of the rotting of the seed caused by this organism. However, 
there may be a correlation between the relative rate on 
varietal agar and rotting of the seed due to this organism, 
or susceptibility of the variety. Unfortunately, experiments 
on this will not be con^lBte to include in this publication. 


DISCUSSION 


Evidence accumulated in these experiments 
demonstrates a varietal difference in response of peas to 
seed treatment with Leytosan ?. 















. ‘ .• . • .... .. 




















































59 - 


Variatul difference in response to treatment 
varied in extent within experiments and to a greater 
ortent in field experiments in different localities. This 
would indicate that soil and o lima tic conditions and soil 
flora wero of importance in this respect (14, 25). The 
optimum conditions for gemination and growth vary for 
different varieties (10) to a considerable extent. When 
these conditions are not optimum germination is delayed, 
and as a result the seed i3 nor© susceptible to the attack 
of seed- and foot-rotting organisms. 

Table XXV lists the varieties in order of their 
response to seed treatment with Leytosen P in the experi¬ 
ments completed. Response to treatment has been determined 
by the difference in the figure for the treated seed and 
that for the non-treated. 

In the field trials at both Edmonton and Brooks, 
Daisy and Stratagem ranked high in response to treatment 
with Leytosan P. In general, Tall Telephone, Daisy and 
Stratagem consistently give a high response to seed treat¬ 
ment, while Alaska and Ilorsford exhibit relatively little 
response. Little Marvel gave little response in field trials 
at Brooks, intermediate response in field trials at Edmonton, 
while in greenhouse tests this variety in the majority of 
instances exhibited the greatest response. Lincoln, in 
field trials at both Brooks and Edmonton, did not respond 
to treatment, but rather exhibited a slight depression in 
emergence and yield at Brooks. In the greenhouse tests,

Iexton Progreso exhibited relatively little response to 
seed treatment, being in a olass with Alaska and Hereford, 
while in field trials thin variety showed considerable 
response. Surprise, Thomas Laxton, Harrowfat, Perfection 
and Hundredfold appeared to be intermediate in all testa 
showing considerable benefit from treatment in the 
majority of tests. Prom field trials at Edmonton, 

Alderman appears to give a high response to seed treatment, 
American Wonder intermediate, with Lax ton Superb and 
Advancer in a class with Alaska, Hereford and Lincoln. 
However, the Advancer, Laxton Superb, American Wonder 
might respond differently under different conditions, a 
possibility which has not been determined. 

The fact that different organisms vary in rate 
of growth on agar prepared with seed extracts from 
different varieties of peas, indicates that it may be 
possible that these organisms show a similar reaction to 
the pea seed. The composition of the seed may have 
considerable influence on the susceptibility to attack 
from soil-borne organisms. The experiment on the effect 
of seed extracts on growth of the two organisms Bacterium 
species and Fuserium h.artil , indicated that some varieties 
favoured the growth of these organisms to a greater 
extent than others. The reason may be that the 
different varieties vary in seed composition. Henry 
and Wallace (10) have shown that varieties vary in 
protein as well as carbohydrate content, but these

determinations at the time of writing have not been com¬ 
pleted for all varieties used in this work. The faot that 
suoh differences occur is of importance, however, in 
arriving at a conclusion as to which varieties are likely 
to suffer to the greater extent and which will give the 
greater response to seed treatment. 

If the bacteria (9) attack the seed first, then 
if the injury to the seed is comparable to its rote of 
growth on agar the Alaska end Ilorsford varieties would be 
injured to the greater extent, however, if Fusarlun sp. 
were also present and parasitised the seed following the 
bacteria (9) then,its degree of injury being comparable to 
its rate of growth on agar, the Tall Telephone and Little 
ilarvel varieties would suffer to a greater extent than 
other varieties. Another factor to be considered in 
arriving at a conclusion is the temperature relations of 
the different organisms. The possibility that varieties 
may vary in their resistance to attack from the various 
organisms comparable to growth on agar nay affect results. 
Temperature relations may be favourable for an organism to 
whioh (me variety may be very susceptible but to which 
another variety may be quite resistant. A different 
temperature may be favourable to an organism, to which 
the first variety nay be the more resistant. 

This brings out the point that there is an inter¬ 
relation of factors having a bearing on differences in 
varietal response to seed treatment. However, under the 











. 

. 

- 

. 




.

conditions for the above experiments with the organisms 
that are present, peas show a difference in varietal 
response to Leytosan P as noted above• 

Although there was evidence of stimulation 
influencing the rate of germination in the first green¬ 
house experiment, in which the rate of emergence in Alaska 
treated with Leytosan P exceeds the rate of emergence of 
apparently healthy seeds in the control, stimulation in 
light of a tonic effect was not established. 

In general it may be stated that when conditions 
are favourable for a rapid germination, most varieties 
will germinate well and produce a satisfactory stand. 
However, if conditions are not entirely favourable for a 
rapid germination of the seed, there will be a marked 
reduction in the stand due to a rotting of the seed in 
the soil by various seed- and foot-rotting organisms. 

Thi3 injury is more severe in such varieties as Tall 
Telephone, Daisy, Stratagem, Alderman and less in varieties 
like Alaska and Ilorsford. 

When germination was not normal and emergence 
delayed due to injury from seed-rot, although the injury 
might be very slight, the consequent reduced vigor seemed 
to predispose the plant to attack from foot- and root-rot 
organisms, wounds in the tissue making entrance easily 
accomplished by other parasites. Pythium sp. were usually 
found associated in the tissues of seedlinrs and plants 
dying following seed- and foot-rot injury.

If the seed is protected by treatment from the 
attaok of seed-rotting organisms and the plant obtains a 
vigorous start, it is better able to resist attack from 
the many other parasitic fungi and bacteria in the soil. 

In this work, Leytosan P has amply demonstrated 
its value as a seed proteotant in the soil for most 
varieties used in these trials. Its economic use night 
be questioned for suoh varieties as Alaska, Horsford and 
Lincoln, but Tall Telephone, stratagem and Daisy should 
not be sown without first treating with sor© form of 
mercury dust# The other varieties used in these trials 
exhibited varying degrees of response to seed treatment. 

New Improved Gere son was also found to be very effective 
as a seed treatment. A noticeable feature was that some 
varieties suoh as Horsford, Alaska and Perfection exhibited 
a greater response to New Improved Ceresan than to 
Leytosan P, while varieties such as Tall Telephone and 
Daisy showed a greater response to Leytosan P. 

The seed of Daisy variety was found to harbor 
internal-borne seed-rotting organisms which were not 
controlled by seed treatment with Leytosan P. This fact 
is of importance in determining a difference in varietal 
response to seed treatment, because when internal-borne 
organisms are present the variety in question naturally 
would not respond to treatment. The Daisy seed used in 
field trials at drooks, free from internal parasites, 
showed a marked varietal response, while the seed used

in the greenhouse trials, which harbored internal-borne 
organisms, showed little response. The latter seed lot was 
produced in a different year, and therefore under 
different oonditianB than the fomar. 

C0NCHJ3I0NS 


1. Peas exhibit a varietal response to seed treat¬ 
ment with Leytosan P, with variations due to temperature, 
moisture and locality. 

2. Seed treatment with Leytosan P and Hew Improved 
Ceresah gave marked increases in plant population, plant 
growth and yield. Some varieties responded to a greater 
extent to Hew Improved Ceresan and others to Leytosan P. 

3. Internally borne soed-rotting organisms found to 
be present in the Daisy variety were not controlled by 
Leytosan P* Kenoe this failed to respond to treatment in 
certain cases, where tlie seed was internally infested. 

4. Two organisms, Fusarium ilartii and bacterium sp. 
exhibited a variation in rate of growth when grown on 
media prepared with pea seed extract of different varieties. 
The rate of growth of the Bacterium sp. on pea 3eed extract 
agar holds an almost reverse order to that of the Pusarlum 
Marti! . 

5 . There was some evidence of stimulation in the 
germination of Alaska pea seed, as a result of the use of 
Leytosan P as a seed treatment. 



























' 


. 






■ 














- 67 - 


6, No evidence of stimulation was observed In 
plant growth which could be attributed to a direct tonic 
effect on the plant from seed treatment with Leytoean P. 
The difference In the growth between the treated plants 
and the oontrols of different varieties was considered 
due more to the protection offered the food reserves In 
the cotyledons rather than to stimulation ao a result of 
seed treatment. 

7. Differences In response of different varieties 
to seed treatment were measured chiefly by the emergence 
differences though In one experiment growth measurements 
were also made. The relationships were similar for the 
two methods. It is considered that in both oases the 
differences are attributable to seed protection rather 
than to stimulation. The food reserves in the cotyledons 
of some varieties evidently are more readily attacked by 
micro-organisms than those of other varieties. Hence the 
farmer respond more to seed treatment than the latter.
