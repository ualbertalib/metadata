SYImOPSIS 


The principal object-ive of this study was to analyse the 
self-concept of grade nine students, Plelated to this objective 
was the problem of selecting a list of statements about self made 
by adolescents^ determining the areas in which this grctip had 
concepts of self^ and constructing a grour) research instrument 
for gathering data for this study. Secondary aims included the 
investigation of relationships betiveen the areas of the perceived 
self^ the relationships between self-concept and intelligence^ and 
analysis of the data for significant sex differences. 

Jlran self-descriptive essays on the topics, "Vslhat I Like 
About Myself”, and '^iiihat I Dislike About Myself”, S46 self-referent 
statements were selected and classified into four broad areas of 
self-perception: mental, personal, social, and physical. To obtain 
the most suitable statements for the research tocl, the 246 state¬ 
ments were rated by five judges. Thus a list of seventy-seven 
statements was selected for the instrument. Using a criterion group 
of fifty-three students, the desirability or undesirability of the 
feelings or values exi^ressed in each statement was determined. The 
average ratings of the statements by this group were used to develoxD 
a scoring system for the instrujnent. 

The self-concept rating schedule was administered to over four 
hundred grade nine students in four Edmonton junior high schools. 
Test-retest data was obtained for fifty-seven students.

Analysis of the data showed significant relationships 
between mean self-acceptance scores for the areas of the perceived 
self. Significant sex differences in mean self-acceptance total 
scores and for mean self-acceptance scores in the social and physical 
areas were found to be in favor of female subjects* No significant 
sex differences were found for mean self-acceptance scores in the 
other tiivo areas. For some specific aspects of self-perception in 
the personal, social, and physical areas, highly significant sex 
differences were found. 

No significant relationships irere found between mean self¬ 
acceptance scores and raw scores on the Otis Intelligence Test. 

Analysis of positive and negative self-concept of the group 
revealed that this group’s positive concept of self consisted .mostly 
of aspects of self-rjerception of character and personality, and 
interpersonal relations. The negative concept of self was found 
to consist of a high percentage of aspects of self-perception of 
physical selfhood, with a Icnwer percentage of self-percepts in the 
personal and social areas. 

Analysis of statements T/hich elicited high percentages of 
favourably-directed and unfavourably-directed ratings showed that 
"t^^ical" .gi.rls and "t^Tpical” boys possessed similar self-concepts, 
though there were some sex differences. 

' Negative statements 'were found to have been rated differently 
from positive statements, drawing more unfavourably-directed responses 
and more non-commital responses. Some statements, both positive and

CHAPTER 1 


PURPOSES OF THE STUDY AND DEFTNIllON OF TEm^S 

1. INTRODUCTION 

In recent years a number of psychologists have approached 
the problem of personality from a different point of view, based 
on the re-emergence of the concept of self as a theoretical construct 
in psychology. Ihis renewed interest in the self has led to a number 
of studies to attempt to give operational clarity to the measurement 
of the self-concept. Probably the self-concept has suffered an 
unavoidable neglect while psychology was laying its ground-work in 
concepts that could be manipulated more easily. The accumulation 
of a body of theoretical formulations about the self and its relation 
to personality has led to research to narrow the gap between theorizing 
about the self and understanding of the nature of the self and its 
functions. 

Following Allport’s article on the Ego in Contemporary 

1 Z 

Psychology in 1943, and Lecky’s book, Self-Consistency , in 1945, 

many students of psychology have approached the problem of developing 

new techniques for measuring the phenomena seemingly related to the 

self.

Though there have been a number of studies reported in 
current psychological literature, most of the research has dealt 
with the self-concept of college students with very little reported 
on adolescents in Junior high school. In discussing the self-concept 
in adolescence Wattenberg emphasizes that study of the self-concept 
in adolescence is in its infancy, the amount of work that deals 
specifically with the teen years is slight. Most of the available 
material on the subject has grown out of clinical observations.”^ 

11. THE PROBLEM 

Statement of the Problem . The principal objective of this 
study is to measure the self-concept of grade nine students. Basic 
to this problem is the selection of self-referent statements which 
will serve as an operational measure of the self-concept and self¬ 
acceptance of adolescents. The use of this instrument is an attempt 
to accumulate data to discover the areas in which adolescents have 
concepts of self, and to describe the self-concept of this group. 

A secondary objective of this study is to test the following 
hypotheses: (l) A list of self-referent statements can be obtained 
which will differentiate between the self-concept of individual

intelligence test scores are low. (4) There are no significant sex 
differences in the self-concept of adolescents.

The fundamental assumptions that underly this study are: 

(l) The adolescent has information relative to his self-organization, 
that is, he has a concept of self. (Z) The self-concept can be analysed 
into components that are descriptive of the adolescent. (3) The list 
of self-referent statements used in the research technique describes 
the self-concept of the subjects. (4) The adolescent is capable of 
rating himself on these selected statements. 

For practical administrative purposes the number of statements 
which can be used to sample the self-concept is limited. Therefore, 
it is to be expected that the scope of this investigation is limited 
to the statements which constitute the research tool used. It cannot 
be assumed that the analysis covers the entire field of the self-concept 
of adolescence. The research tool which is employed here merely samples 
the self-ccncept. In addition the results of this investigation apply 
only to the group studied, and not necessarily to other adolescents 
in the same age group. 

Importance of the problem . Since the school is one of the 
determiners of a young person's personality in the development of 
desirable traits, values, and attitudes, it must concern itself with 
the person's concept of himself. It is felt that education should 
seek reality in. that it should reduce as far as possible the vast 
carry-over of unhealthy attitudes toward self and others that young

people now bring with them into adult life. A full-scale approach 
to the problem appears vital if teaching is to make a significant 
contribution to the lives of the young people. 

Prom the point of view of phenomenological psychology 
maladjustment is often defined as any discrepancy betvTeen the concept 
of self and the concept of the ideal self. Existence of a discrepancy 
betiffeen the self-concept and the ideal-concept implies that the 
individual has information relative to his present self-organization^ 
and that he has a view of himself as he wishes to be, even in childhood. 

Jersild states that ”- there is a need of staggering magnitude 
for doing something in our educational program to help children and 
youth to acquire realistic attitudes of self-acceptance."^ Since the 
self-concept vitaller influences the young person’s behaviour, 
educationists must examine the implications of accepting the self- 
concept as a basic concept in education. By helping the young person 
to gain insight, we can help him to gain a better understanding of 
himself and assist in improving his adjustment. It is in school that 
the youth can be helped to develop the feelings of personal acceptance 
which lay the foundations for a well-adjusted system of attitudes towards 
other individuals. This contributes to satisfactory adjustment to his 
environment outside the school and in later life. If we can, through 
research and study, learn how to help this individual make these

adjustments, we are contributing towards his social growth and 

maintenance of mental health* 

The self-concept is believed many to be one of the most 

important variables in learning. It is well known that attitudes 

affect learning. Speaking of attitudes Hobbs states: 

But if one samples broadly enough of such attitudes, one 
is dealing with the self, it would seem, as a potent factor 
in learning. l/Vhy do girls consistently do better in some 
subjects than boys? l/iThy can a delinquent lad learn so much 
about guns and so little about geometry? Why do some people 
learn to be good citizens so much more readily than others? 
There are doubtless many factors involved, but perhaps the 
indivLdualjIs concept of himself is one of the most important 
variables.^ 

Hobbs feels that some phenomena involved in memory also seem to be 
best explained by positing the operation of the self, e.g., the 
phenomena of repression.^ 

In the field of guidance, the self-concept is assuming its 
rightful place. Hobbs defines guidance ”as the function of providing 
and individual with the optimum opportunity to examine his self and 
his potentialities in relation to his world.” In vocational guidance 
the counsellor can assist the subject to accept himself. Super says, 
”In choosing an occupation one is, in effect, choosing a means of 

o 

implementing a self-concept.”

Our schools, much concerned with the problem of guidance, can help 
individuals gain feelings of self-acceptance to arrive at a realistic 
pictiu'e of self, thus assisting them to greater self-realization. 

Case studies and client-centered therapy have demonstrated 
the importance of the self-concept in personality adjuslanent. 

JSrovmfain concluded in his study that ”all findings support the 
theoretical prediction that subjects vfith stable self-concepts are 
better adjusted than those with unstable self-concepts.'*^ Sills, 
using the Index of Adjustme nt and Values to measure the self-concept, 
concluded that high and low scorers constitute distinctly different 
personality groups, as measured by the Rorschach}^ Rogers found changes 
in adjustment with corresponding changes in the concept of self in 
client-centered therapy casesSills, summarizing after a study of 
personality changes, concludes that to a statistically significant ’ 
degree student-centered teaching accomplishes the same effects as 

TO 

client-centered therapy." and that "...statistically significant 

1 -z 

changes occurred in concept of self and acceptance of self."

111, DEFiNIHON OF TERMS 


This rather teasing problem, the nature of the self, poses 

the difficult task of definition of the self . One of the widely 

accepted definitions of the self is that of Symonds, the subjective 

self as it is perceived, conceived, valued, and responded to the 

individual himself* Commenting on the self, Macleod writes. 

There is the transcendental self, the pure ego, the knower 
7/ho can never be known because no one, excluding himself, 
can ever observe him. The philosophers worry about him, 
in volume after volume, and Thrill continue to worry. 

He quotes William James that there is also 

- an empirical self, the self that can be observed. The 
word ‘I’ represents a palpable reality, a set of phenomena 
which can be described and experimented Tfldth not as easily 
but just as validly as can the phenomena of -/ision or hearing. 
Your self is a natural fact. It is tied do/m to the perception 
of your own body.”^® 

It is the self defined by Symonds and described by Macleod, 
not the philosophical self or ego that is the subject of investigation 
in this study. It is that self of which the individual has an awareness, 
the self to which he reacts* It includes,says Jersild among other 
things, a system of ideas, attitudes, values, and commitments.**^'^ 

It is empirically derived, a result of experience; it may be a changing 
self* It is both physiological and psychological, embodying all the 
individual calls *’ 1 ***

The self that is perceived by the individual inay be 
described as the individual’s self-concept . Bills defines this 
concept as the traits and values which the individual has 
accepted as definitions of himself.”-^ He goes on to explain that 
’’Values are derived from traits, a trait being an adjective which 
may be used.to describe a person. A value is a trait which the 
individual considers desirable#”-^ Then he defines an attitude 
as an evaluation. An individual may have attitudes toward 

on 

traits, interests and self,”^ It is these attitudes tovrards 
traits, interests, and the self that this study is concerned with, 
to arrive at values which the individual has accepted of himself. 

The self-concept in this study is the sum of the self¬ 
referent statements that were selected from self-descriptive essays 
written by adolescents. It is, therefore, a composite self-concept 
of the students who irrote the essays. It follows, then, that the 
self-concept that is obtained by using the selected list of seventy- 
seven statements, which constitute the research tool, is restricted 
to these statements to which the subjects can react with varying 
degrees of acceptance. 

For a better understanding of the self-concept we must have 
an understanding of the self-ideal , the ideal self, or the ideal 
concept, terms which are used synonymously. The self-ideal may be

defined as the self to be realized, or the self that the individual 
is striving to become. The self-ideal is believed by psychologists 
to be the goal toward which an individual directs his energies. It 
is, therefore, the directing force of the self-concept. 

The gap between the self-concept and the self-ideal is 
usually called self-acceptance . Empirically it is the discrepancy 
betv/een the individual’s concept of self and his ideal self. In 
measurable terms it represents the difference between one’s perceived 
self and his self-ideal. 

Another term that is akin to the study of the self-concept 
is the group - ideal . This is defined as the system of values which 
is accepted as desirable by an individual’s peer group. That the 
influence of the peer group of one’s set of values is great few will 
dispute. It is believed that in adolescence this influence is very 
strong. Hence, the group-ideal will guide tbie formation of an 
individual’s self-ideal. Yi/hen an individual’s self-ideal is not known 
the investigator can resort to the use of the group-ideal. In this 
stud^/^ the term self-acceptance is used to describe the discrepancy between 
an individual’s self-concept and the group-ideal. Self-acceptance is, 
in other words, an individual’s valuation of himself in terms of 
group-ideal.

CHAPTER 11 


RSUTED LITERATURE 

For an adequate understanding of the studies that are being conducted 
on the self-concept, it is necessary to exainine the literature pertaining to 
theories of personality that are built around the self, and the research that 
has been done in this field* In varying degrees a number of personality 
theorists have introduced the self or the self-concept into their formulations 
of personality, and have placed greater emphasis on the subjects* perception 
of hjjBself# 

1* SCME SELF IHECEIES 

In his book, “Psychology”, William James appears to have set the stage 
for future theorizing about the self* He defines the self or ihe “Snpirical 
Me” as the sura total of aH that a person can call his — his body traits, 
and abilities; his material possessions; his family, friends, and envies; 
his vocation and avocations and much else* This writer discusses the self 
under three headings (l) its constituents, (Z) self-feelings, and (3) the 
actions of self-seeking and self-preservation* The constituents of self, he 
states, are the material self, the social self, the spiritual self, and pure 

Ego* He defines pure Ego as the stream of thought which constitutes one's 

21 

sense of personal identity* 

Hall and Idndzey feel that the influence of James stimulated AHport's 
interest in the self:

pp* 176-177.

James is reflected not only in Allport‘s brilliant writing style,••• 
and an interest in the self but also in certain doubts concerning 
the ultimate power of psychological methods to represent adequately 
and to understand completely the engima of human behaviour 

Allport emphasizes the importance of self — 

Each person may, to some extent, be regarded as having different 
‘selves* rather than a completely integrated ‘self** He manifests 
one ‘self* at home say, and another ‘self* in his place of business, 
in his church, in his club, and so on* Normally there is much 
overlapping of the different ‘selves*, as they are integrated with 
one another 

In 1945 Allport reviewed the many meanings of ego and self in 
psychological literature* He proposed that all of the self-f unctions, 
including bodily sense, self-identity, self-esteem, self-extension, rational 
thinking, self-image, and the function of knowing are all true portions of 
personality* However, he believed that neither the ego or self acts as an 
entity distinct from the remainder of personality* He does not distinguish 
between «ego” and “self**, but describes the “ego” as both the knower t or 
the self-as-ob,iect* and the doer* or the self-as-process *^^ 

Allport*s address on the ego in contemporary psychology stimulated 
Chein (1944) to formulate a theory of the self and ego* His view is that 
“•••the self is not identical with the ego* If it were, then the knowledge 
of the ego would be as immediate as the knowledge of the self*”^^ 

Chein presents the argument:

and Sons, New York, 1957, pp* 257-258.

For the self is a content of awareness; it has no reality apart 
from awareness and it does not correspond closely to the real object 
of awareness. Such a content cannot be selfish, or strive for 
dominance, or look to the future. If there is something which does 
these things, it must have reality apart from awareness. What we 
have done here, is to suggest what that something can be and, until 
someone suggests something else that it can be that fits the facts 
better, we must assume that our description of the ego is correct; 
the ego is a motivational-cognitive structure built around the self. 

Bertocci took Allport to task in 1945 for using the term ”ego” 

sjTionymously with self# Bertocci labels ego-as-process as the self , and the 

seli-as-object as the ego . This seons to be a switch of the customary meanings 

of the terms. Bertocci describes the ego as a cluster of values, embodied 

in a form of traits, with which the self identifies success. For him it is the 

ego that is the doer, and the self is the knower .^*^ 

Although Lecky (1945) does not develop a theory of personality in 

his book, his ideas of the self influenced thou^t on concept-fomation 

in the past decade. He developed the idea that — 

The nucleus of the system, around which the rest of the systen 
evolves, is the individual *3 idea or conception of himself. Any 
idea entering the system which is inconsistent with the individual's 
conception of himself cannot be assimilated, but gives rise to an 
inconsistency which must be removed as promptly as possible. 

Lecky adds that the individual must "...define for himself the nature of 

29 

that totality which he is." He states that — 

...it is sometimes necessary to alter the opinion one holds of 
himself. This is difficult, for the individual's conception of 
himself is the central axiom of his whole life theory. Never'theless, 
a gradual change in the coi^ept of self is imperative to normal 
development and happiness.

Lecky sees personality as the central, unifying concept of psychology 
with all psychological phenomena expressions of a unified personality* All 
of man*s activities, he believes, serve the sum of personality, to achieve 
self-consis tency 

Sheriff and Cantril (1947) define the ego as a constellation of 
attitudes the individual has about himself* They assert that ”•••apart from 
the constellation of these ego attitudes there is no such entity as the ego. ”32 
To these writers the ego is a self-as-object, but also appears as an ego- 
as-^otive throughout the book* Ihey feel that the ego (self)-attitudes 
energize, direct, and control the behaviour of individuals *33 

Hilgard (1949) was concerned with the question of how one can determine 
the nature of the self-image or self-concept. He does not agree that one 
can obtain a true self-picture by asking the person what he thinks of himself, 
because the person*s self-picture may be distorted by the unconscious* He 
recommends the projective technique from which can be derived what he calls

a product of complex psychological processes aroused by stimuli of which 
the person is unaware*^ Hilgard (1953) recognizes the perceived self as

While some personality theorists were struggling with the problem 
of the self, the theory of phenomenological psychology was being dsTeloped* 

Snygg and Combs (1949), adherents to this new theory, consider that "..•all 
behaviour, without exception, is completely determined by and pertinent to the 
phenomenal field of the behaving organism.They take the phenomenal fields 
as the totality of e:q)erienc 0 s of which the person is aware at the instant 
of action. The phencaienal selfj they say, .includes all those parts of 
the phenomenal fields which the individual experiences as part of character¬ 
istics of himself. Their self is both an object and a doer at the same 
time* As a doer it is an aspect of the phenomenal field, and as an object 
it consists of self-experiences. To these writers the self is composed of 
perceptions concerning the individual, and this organization of perceptions 
in turn has vital and important effects upon the behaviour of the individuals.^® 
In another publication, Snygg esqplains — 

The basic need, in a phenomenological system, is the maintenance and 
enhanc^ient of the phenomenal self* Human beings are aware of them¬ 
selves, and the self th^ are tiying to maintain is not the physical 
self but the self of which they are aware, the phenomenal self.^® 

He adds that the human being ”...is a living organism persistently striving 

for self maintenance and growth, and actively exploring his field for means 

of satisfying this need.”^

MacLeod (1949), another phenomenologist, in discussing perceptual 

constancy and motivation, feels that — 

It would be reasonable to assume that the self, if we accept it as 
a fact co-ordinate with the perceptual object, should also behave 
as a natural system. If so, it should be cohesive, it should 
interact with other parts of the field in such a way as to maintain 
its integrity, and, if it is like Ihe self-regulative systems which 
secure physiological homeostasis, it should, when disrupted, .. 

generate needs idiich are appropriate to its own optimum condition. 

In subsequent discussion MacLeod suggests that “the concept of 

system may be carried over to the complex interactions between self and 

42 

object which we call motive”, and that the principle of homeostasis can 
be applied to these interactions.^^ In discussing this principle of homeo¬ 
stasis, Stagner feels that it recurs in many aspects of personality.^ 
McQuitty (1950) takes the position that the self-concept is an 
integi-ating phencmenon in the personality structure. He suggests that 
“...the adequate personality is one in vhcm the self is well integrated. 

As a result of this integration, he says, the individual “...can accept into 
his organized concept of self all his interpretations of reality, including, 
of coxirse, perceptions of himself.”^® A similar point of view is brought 
forward ty Anderson. She writes that “it is as important to every individual

to maintain his psychological self-image intact as it is that he maintain 
his physical self-image intact* 

Symonds (1951) discusses the ego and the self from Ihe psychoanalytic 

point of view* The self, he writes, consists of hew a person perceives 

himself, what he thinks of himself, how he values himself, and how he attempts 

to enhance and defend himself* He believes that there is considerable 

interaction between the self and the ego* If the self is enhanced, he feels, 

the ego processes are more likely to function more effectively* He also 

introduces the self-ideal* and describes how it is developed through childhood 
48 

and adolescence* 

At about this time Rogers (1951) came out with what is often labeled 
as the self-tbeoiy of personality, which is a synthesis of phenomenology* 

In Rogers* theory of personality, the self is the nuclear concept* It 
develops out of the organism's interaction with the phencmienal field* The 
values of other people may be interjected by the self, and the self may 
perceive these values as distorted* The self strives for consistency, and the 
organism behaves in manners that are consistent with self* Experiences that 
are not consistent with self are perceived as threats* In addition, the 
self may change as a result of learning and maturation

Rogers describes the perceived and integrated self as the self- 
concept or the self-structure of the individual* Rogers and I)ymond 
have introduced the self-ideal into their explanation of maladjustment* 
iheir basic hypothesis applied to consistency-seeking is: ”*.*that a 
reduction of self-ideal discrepancies is a consequence of the ideal- 
concept coming to rest on a broader base of experience than before*”^ 
Biis view is being challanged by some psychologists who feel that it 
is the self-concept of the individual that changes during adjustment, 
and not the self-ideal* 

Rogers* theory of personality is being periodically changed and 
restated, but even now it appears to be the most complete theory of 
personality based on the self-structure, and is being supported by 
considerable basic research* 

Sarhln (1952) undertook to review some of the main conceptions of 

the ego, finding at least a dozen variants: Seme of these are: the 

physical self, the material self, the projective self, the pure ego, 

the transcendental ego, the social self, the ethical self, the inferred 

self*^ He calls these substructures of the total cognitive structures 

which are acquired through experience. He describes the development of 

the self from diildhood as it grows ”***usually in the direction from 

low-order inferences about simple perceptions to higher-order inferences 
52 

about cognitions.”

His use of the term "self" is synonymous with the term "ego". 

Jersild (1952), in his book In Search of Self , gave a 

number of definitions of self, self-ideal, and self-concept, but 

he did not synthesize them nor differentiate distinctly between 

the finer shades of interpretations.^^ However, in his most recent 

publication (1957) he has restated his definition of self: 

The self is a composite of many psychological states, 
impressions, and feelings. It includes the perceptions 
the adolescent has of himself: the impressions he has of 
his body, the image he has of his physical appearance and 
of tangible properties of his person. It includes the 
conception he has of himself, his traits and abilities, 
his role, his background, his possibilities. It includes 
also the attitudes he has concerning himself and the 
beliefs, convictions, and values he holds among the attitudes 
are those he has concerning himself as a person, his worth, 
his attitudes regarding his right to have his own feelings 
and thoughts and to make his own choices. The self includes 
all that a person embraces in the words I, me, mine, myself. 

It is within each person, the core and substance of his 
experience as a human being 

In another publication, Jersild and associates take the 
position that the self-concept should become the basis of educational 
psychology, in that "the educational program from nursery school 
through college might help the growing person to understand and 
accept himself.The authors feel that teachers can help the students 
achieve a realistic concept of self to eliminate the anxiety that is 
prevalent within young peoxDle.

Elizabeth Hurlock (1953) believes that the individual's 

concept of self is the fundamental core of the personality structure -- 

"■i/ftiat he thinks of himself, his abilities, and his dis¬ 
abilities will determine the characteristic form of his 
behaviour. IfiThile it (the self-concept) unquestionably 
does change to a certain extent, the changes are for the 
most part, slight 

She feels that the self-concept becomes quite stable in adolescence* 

In discussing adolescence, Ausubel (1954) echoes the views 

of others interested in developmental psychology: 

There are a number of reasons for believing that the self- 
concept occupies a prominent place in the individual’s 
psychological field during adolescence, and that considerable 
upward revision of self-estimate and level of ego aspiration 
takes place, in contrast to the carefree and extroverted 
self of later childhood, the adolescent self oeoomes a 
more crucial and clearly delimited object of awareness 

This implies the narrowing of the gap between the self-concept and 

self-ideal, and is in agreement with Havighurst and Taba (1949) who 

write — 


The '’ideal self” is especially important in directing 
behaviour and shaping character during the years of 
adolescence when major life decisions must be made and 
when parental example and precept are no longer accepted 
with blind faith. 

Lindgren (1954) discusses Rogers’ theory of the self and 
enlarges on it —

A portion of the world is perceived by the individual 
gradually becomes differentiated from the rest of the 
world, and this becomes the self. The self is that 
portion perceived to be within the control of the 
individual. Thus objects or events outside the body 
may under some circumstances be felt to be a portion of 
the self, especially if the individual sees them as being 
important to his welfare, or, as we say, if he is 'ego- 
involved' in them.^^ 

In relating the self to mental health, Lindgren presents 
this view: 

The self normally operates to organize and direct the 
activities of the individual in ways that will enhance 
his ability to meet all his needs and to maintain a 
high level of mental health... it aids the individual in 
understanding, tolerating, accepting, and respecting 
himself and others, and in becoming self-reliant and 
productive.^^ 

The writer talks of the discrepancy beti'veen the self-concept and 
ideal self stating — 

The greater the gap or disparity betv'feen the idealized 
self and the real self, the greater is the possibility 
of developing anxiety and guilt. The gap is likely to 
be wider during adolescence than at any other time....^^ 

Y^attenberg (1955) sees the growth of the concept of self 

as a very vital aspect of personality development in adolescence. 

He discusses its importance in connection with level of aspiration, 

feelings about the soul, and attitudes relating to omnipotence and 

inferiority, as well as other aspects relating to the self. He feels

that the self-concept vitally influences a youngster's behaviour, 

as well as confronting him with a series of problems. Ihe writer 

emphasizes the value of self-insight, and the importance of arriving 

at a concept of self which is realistic« 

Smith, bruner, and l//hite point to the importance of the 

self-concept in current personality theory ~ 

Finally, a special place in the hierarchical organization 
of personality must be given to those inferred processes 
which underlie the e:}q)erience of self. IVhether we use the 
term Phenomenal Self, Ego, Self Image, or some other, it 
is quite apparent that a major contribution to consistency 
of behaviour can be referred to the person’s reactions to 
his experience of self.^^ 

A discussion of the self would not be complete without 
some mention of Mead (1954), a social philosopher, whose conceptions 
of self had much influence on psychological thinking. Mead describes 
the development of the self as an object of awareness, through 
experience. Mead’s self is a socially-formed self which can only 

exist in social situations. He feels that there may be many selves 

64 

which may exist in different situations.

fi cr 

of the role played 1:^ the self in current personality theory.

They use Carl Rogers* formulation of personality structure as a 
sample theory to discuss the current status of the self-theory, 
and evaluate its importance. The chief criticism of the self¬ 
theory, the authors propose, is that it is based upon a naive 
type of phenomenology: 

There is abundant evidence to shovf that factors unavailable 
to consciousness motivate behaviour, and that what a 
person says to himself is highly colored and distorted 
by defenses of various kinds. Self-reports are notoriously 
lacking in reliability not only because the person may 
intend to deceive the listener but also because he does 
not know the whole truth about himself*^^ 

The foregoing summary brings out the fact that there is 

striking evidence of disagreement between the major proponents of 

the self-theory of personality. In the first place, there is lack 

of agreement in the use of the terra self . One accepted meaning 

of the self-as-object denotes the person's perceptions, feeling, 

attitudes, and valuations of himself as an object. Another meaning 

of the self - as-process denotes the self as an active group of 

processes such as perceiving, thinking, and remembering. Some writers 

accept the first^ientioned as their definition of self , and the second 

as their definition of the ego . A few employ the two terns in the 

opposite sense. All this merely shows that the boundaries of 

selfhood have not yet been clearly determined, and that more research 

is necessary to bring about consistency in the use of teiras. It does 

appear, however, that more and more writers are accepting the self-as- 

object definition.

Some investigators and theorists postulate a composite 
or integrated self 5 others say that there are many selves. Most 
agree, however, that the self is a very vital construct in 
personality structure. Current research is attempting to resolve 
the many problems relating to self. 

11. HESEARCH KELAUNG TO SELF 

Though the value of a theory is not solely dependent upon 
empirical findings, such findings can be summoned to substantiate 
theoretical formulations. In the past decade considerable research 
has been conducted in an attempt to give clarity and sjti thesis to 
the unresolved aspects of the self-theory of personality. 

Qualitative Studies 

The technique of analysing client’s self-descriptive state¬ 
ments which were made in nondirective therapy was used by Rogers to 
explore the client’s self-picture. He uses extracts from records 

of clients’ statements to explain the phenomena relating to the self, 

67 

and to illustrate his self-theory of personality.^’ 

Content Analysis 

Rogers and Dymond, who worked togetiier on a large number 
of case studies, using Q-technique self-sorts of one hundred 
statements, as well as self-statements made in nondirective therapy 
conclude that

...A high discrepancy between self and ideal ...has, we 
have found, only one meaning. It indicates stress, tension, 
maladjustment, etc., within the individual, and this 
meaning tends to be definitely corroborated W evidence 
external to the person’s frame of reference.^® 

After conducting two studies of 151 delinquent adolescents, Rogers, 

Kell and kcKeil reach tne conclusion that the ratings of the 

individual’s understanding of himself and the reality situation was, 

in both studies, the best prediction of what his future adjustment 

would be."^^ 


In a study of self and others, using the nondirective 

approach. Stock found that 

...a definite relationship exists between the way an 
individual feels about himself and the way he feels 
about other persons. An individual who holds negative 
feelings toward himself tends to hold negative feelings 
toward other people in general.'^ 

Jersild summarized and categorized self-referent statements 
obtained from essays on the topics, '’I'i-liat I Like About Myself” and 
’’liiliat I Dislike About Myself”. He concluded that the more genuinely 
a person at an^^ level of age or social prestige realizes his ovim 
selfhood, the greater capacity he has to relate himself to others, 
and the greater opportunity he has of realizing his potentialities

with the types of adults mentioned by sixteen-year-olds in essays

and persons, and questions for transcribing records of fourteen cases 
to study characteristic changes in self-references in from tyfo to 
twenty-one interviews. The writer found that at the beginning of 
therapy clients gave a preponderance of disapproving or ambivalent 
self-references. At the end the clients who had improved were 
making a preponderant number of self-approving statements. Those 
who had not improved still gave ambivalent and self-disapproving 

statements. Raimy concludes that .successful counselling involves 

76 

essentially a change in the client’s self-concept.” 

Q-Technique Studies 

Stephenson, who is not considered to be a self-theorist, 

developed methods of research known as Q-technique which have been 

77 

adapted for investigating the self-concept.

Ha tier and Haigh employed a Q-sort to test the hypothesis that 
people who come for counselling are dissatisfied with themselves 
and that following counselling their dissatisfaction with themselves 
will be reduced. They concluded that self-esteem, which they define 
as the congruence between self-and ideal-sorts increases as a 
direct result of client-centered counselling.*^^ 

Chodorkoff, using the Q-sort, and adjustment rating scale 
rated 1:^ judges, and the Monroe Inspection Rorschach Check List 
concluded that an individual’s perception of himself and self¬ 
description are good criteria of bis personal adjustment. He warns, 
however, that defensiveness is an important variable in self- 

judgnents of people, and that self-reports cannot be relied upon to 

79 

give the same picture as is obtained by outside judges. 

McGregor adapted the Q-sort to group administration, using 
fifty-one statements to study self-group, self-ideal, self-group ideal, 
and ideal-group ideal relationships in adolescence. He found significant 
individual differences in these relationships with a slight tendency 
for self-concepts to conform to group ideals, and a strong tendency

for the ideal-concepts to correspond to group ideal-concepts.®^ 
Pi’om a study in which self-sorts and ideal-sorts were 
used, Block and Thomas concluded that "..«the degree of self- 
satisfaction is curvilinearly related to the social dimension of 
adjustment."®^ They feel that "the skewness of the distribution 
is perhaps intrinsically meaningful, if it implies that an optimal 
point of self-satisfaction is above the midpoint of the range."®^ 
A startling conclusion was reached by Levy who used 
actual-ideal sorts on one hundred self-referent items and one 
hundred home-tovm-referent items with twenty-one college student 
volunteers; 

Furthermore, in the light of the present data, previous 
hj^otheses concerning actual-ideal discrepancies which 
treated them as phenomena contingent upon such conditions 
as self-acceptance, self-esteem, etc., appear to be too 


narrowly conceived 


82 


This conclusion should lead to re-examination of the hypotheses 
relating to self-ideal discrepancies, and should stimulate further 
research to resolve the problem.

All External Frame of Reference; Personality Tests 

Calvin used the MPI to study the relationships between 
adjustment and self-ideal discrepancies. He concluded that 
individuals who show poor insight into their level of adjustment 
are more likely to be maladjusted than those who shov^ good insight. 

He also found that the more poorly-adjusted an individual is, the 
more self-depreciative he appears to be. 

Lundy, Katkovsky, Cromwell and Shoemaker selected from 
the MPiPI eighty statements which they considered appropriate to 
personality to studj- self-acceptibilily. found "...a significant 

positive relationship between adjustment and similarity of self¬ 
description with descriptions of positive and negative sociometric 
choices. 

The Rorschach, a:*awnfain S-R Inventory, and Frenkel- 

Brunswick F-Scale were used by La Fon in a study of self-acceptance 

with 146 female undergraduates. He found that "the results tend to 

show that a number of Rorschach factors are sufficiently sensitive 

to differentiate the high and low self-acceptance levels from a 
Rfi 

normal population."

The Frenkel-Brunswick F-Scale, Edwards Preference Schedule, 

and ratings of perceived and ideal selves were used in a study of 

self-acceptance ty Fey. He reported that — 

Individuals shov/ing low self-acceptance and high self¬ 
acceptance of others appeared to be punitive self¬ 
disparagers; those with high self-acceptance and low 
self-acceptance of others were especially resistant to 
the idea of personal psychotherapy and appeared to be 
extrapunitive projectors 

Ihis again points to the way some persons defend themselves extra- 
personally, and indicates that self-reports may not always be reliable. 
In another study, using similar techniques. Fey concludes that 
"expressed attitudes, because of their patent superficiality and 
susceptibility to distortion, would appear to lack descriminative 
power for the description of personality."^^ He feels that for that 
study "...self-acceptance was not closely linked with the discrepancy 
between perceived and idealized self."^^ 

The TAT was used by Dymond to study self-others patterns with 
twenty students. She concluded that — "the TAT seems to provide a 
valid method of revealing the basic internalized self-other patterns- 
which represent the subject's view of his interpersonal relations.

Child, however, does not agree with the foregoing about the value 
of the TAT. He used the TAT and a self-rating questionnaire of two 
hundred items. He found "...general lack of relations betiveen TAT 
scores and self-ratings."^^ 

Tests and Scales 

In 1951 Phillips used a sociometric device in the form of 
questionnaire to study self-others relationships. He found 
significant positive relationships (/.51 to /.74) between attitudes 
toward self and tov^ard othersThe instrument developed by Phillips 
was used by kcintyre who found positive correlations of .46 bet/feen 
attitudes toward self and toward othersBerger, who developed 
another instrument, confirms the findings of Phillips 

Another instrument that was developed at about the same 
time by Brownfain, a Self-Rating Inventory of twenty-five personality 
traits. Brownfain, studying positive and negative self-concepts 
of sixty- male college students concluded that "all findings support 
the theoretical prediction that subjects with stable self-concepts 
are better adjusted than those Yfith unstable self-concepts."

The same instrument was used by Cowen who investigated the negative 
self-concept of a group of college undergraduates divided into two 
groups based on high and low scores of negative self-concepts. He 
found that "some of the measures indicated that the high negative 
self-concept group responded in a manner more indicative of good 
adjustment than did low scorers.”^® However, Zimmer, who used the 
S-Pw Inventory in studying fifty-two subjects, concluded that his 
results ’’...fail to support the contention that discrepancies between 
the concept of self and the concept of the ideal self are directly 
indicative of conflict. 

An instrument that has been widely used to study the self- 

concept is the Index of Adjustment and Values developed by Bills, 

Vance and McLean* It consists of forty-nine adjectives which subjects 

rate on a five-point scale. The Index provides measures of self- 

concept, self-ideal and self-acceptance. Bills reports test-^etest 

reliability coeficients of .83 to .91 for Ihe different measures. 

In a study of high school seniors Bills found that — 

Acceptance of self scoies below the population mean wei*e 
significantly related to threat from self and acceptance 
of self scores above the population mean were significantly 
related to threat from others.^®

Bills has reported considerable research using this 

instrument in connection with signs of depression, level of aspiration, 

99 

emotionality, and validation studies* 

The study of Qnwake ccmpares the instruments of Berger, Phillips, 
and Bills to investigate self-others relationships* She found that all 
three instruments are useful research tools to study the self-concept, 
and that ’’•••there is a marked relation between the way an individual 
sees himself and the way he sees others”, supporting previous research*^^^ 
Cowen used Brownfain's modified S-R Inventory and Bills Index on two 
samples of subjects to study self-concept discrepancy scores* He 
concluded that *'to date the most sensitive single sub-measure has been 
the negative self-concept on Brownfain*s scale He also found that 

the discrepancy (or maladjustment) score on Bills Index relates 

102 

significantly to independent measures of self-regarding attitudes 

Miller and Worchel report on a study in which they used the 
Self-Activity Inventory (SAI), a self-rating scale of fifty-four

exists between one’s evaluation of adequacy in coping with frustration 
and efficiency in maintaining adequacy of performance

Cattell's^^"^ bi-polar opposite adjectives have been used 
in one instrument of forty-hvo pairs of adjectives by Helper^^^ 
and another twenty-four pairs of adjectives developed by Manis.^^^ 
Using a scale developed by Zuckerman and others 

report on a study of ninety patients and normals of ages seventeen 
to fort37--five; 

Self-Acceptance does not seem to be an accurate index of 
adjustment vdthin the patient group although the patients 
are more dissatisfied than normals. Self-acceptance probably 
is influenced by mechanisms like denial, which are used by 
patients of all degrees of pathology, by hysterics as well 
as paranoids, for instance.” 

The writers feel that acceptance of others seems to be a better 
index of adjustment than acceptance of self. These conclusions are 
in direct contrast to many other findings concerning self-acceptance 
and adjustment. 

The research that has been conducted to resolve the problems 
relating to the self, clearly indicates that it is most difficult to 
arrive at any definite conclusions about the use of the various 
techniques employed (or about) the self-theory of personality. There 
are indications that some of the different techniques employed yield

similar results. At the same time there have appeared contradictory 
conclusions. Therefore, much research and refinement of research 
technique is necessaiy before any synthesis of the reported research, 
can justifiably be made. 

However, in the light of research fi.ndings reported to date 
some observations can be made; 

1. Measures of the self-concept and ideal-concept can be 
obtained by various teclmiques: verbal and written self-references, 
Q-technique methods, scales and tests speciall^^ designed, and existing 
personality tests and projective techniques. 

2. Self-references may not always be reliable because of 
defensiveness of the subjects or other personal variables. 

5. Discrepancy between self-concept and self-ideal or 
group-ideal has been found in the majority of cases to be indicative 
of conflict, though there is some contradictory evidence. 

4. The negative self-concept may prove more indicative of 
poor adjustment ihan the positive self-concept. 

5. Attitudes towards others appears to be a very useful 
method of obtaining attitudes towards self. 

6. There is a need for validation of methods used to study 
the self-concept. 

7. There is an urgent need for clarification of terms used, 
in order to create more efficient communication.

CHAPTER 111 


RESKARCH DESIOM 

In order to analyse the phenomena related to the self in 
adolescence there appears to be an urgent need to develop a research 
tool specifically for adolescents. This implies that it is desirable 
to obtain items for the instrument from the adolescents themselves. 

In this way it should be possible to construct a research tool that 
is understood by the adolescent, and to Yirhich the adolescent i/ill 
respond freely. An empirical approach to this problem is, therefore, 
suggested. 

1. PROCEDURE 

The first step in this study was the construction of a 
self-concept rating schedule (Appendix B3) preparation of which is 
described in Chapter IV. This schedule was administered to grade 
nine students in four Edmonton junior high schools. Before the 
administration of the schedule a teacher from each school was contacted, 
and the procedure of the administration was discussed with him. In 
addition, each teacher acting as administrator was given a imlmeographed 
inst 2 ?u,ction sheet (Appendix El) which outlined the purpose of the 
study as well as the detailed instructions for administering the 
schedule. 

About one week before the administration of the schedule

the subjects were given the Otis Self-Administering Test of Mental 
Ability, Intermediate Form A* 

To obtain a measure of self-acceptance it was necessary to 
develop a scoring system for the schedule. The procedure for this 
is described in Chapter V, and the data relative to this procedure 
is summarized in Table 111* 

The schedules were scored twice, once to obtain a composite 
score, and the second time to obtain scores for the four areas of 
self-acceptance. Tnis also served as a check on the accuracy of 
scoring. The raw data were consolidated on large sheets, using 
separate sheets for male and female subjects. Distribution tables 
which were derived from the raw data appear in Appendix E. 

Product-moment correlation coefficients were calculated 
between the area scores to discover the interrelationships between 
the areas of the perceived self. 

Total scores and area scores, and raw scores on the Otis 
Test were used to calculate product-moment coefficients to estimate 
relationships bebf^een these variables. 

, To estimate test-retest reliability the schedule was 

administered to two classes of sixty-fcur subjects eight days after 
the initial administration. 

Since a five-point rating scheme was used, the responses 
to items in each category were added. Then numbers and percentages 
of subjects giving different responses to each item were calculated.

as is shofvm in Appendix ^ • These data were used to analyse the 
self-concept of the group, and to obtain evidence of sex differences* 

11* THE SUBJECTS 

The self-concept rating schedule and the Otis S-A Test of 
Mental Ability were administered to thirteen classes of 403 grade 
nine students in four junior high schools in the city of Edmonton 
in November 1956* In two schools there were two classes in each, 
in one school there were three classes, and in one school there were 
six classes* Because of absences for either the schedule or the 
Otis Test, or because of non-completion of the schedule, complete 
data was available for only 384 subjects, 194 female and 190 male* 

Ihe eleven subjects who did not complete the schedule gave no response 
to a number of items* Ihile this may have a bearing on the results 
of the study, it is not expected that the effect will be highly 
significsuat, because they represent less than three per cent of the 
total group* 

Table 1 summarizes the data obtained from the Otis Test* 

Ihe range of the intelligence quotients is 64 to 131, with a mean 
of 110*7 and a standard deviation of 10*5* The mean for female 
subjects is 112*5 and male subjects 108*6 distribution table for

The mean ages for female and male subjects were 14 years 7 months 
and 14 years 11 months respectively* Ihe mean age for the total 
group was 14 years and 9 months* It can be seen that the group is 
not homogeneous from the standpoint of age* This may have some bearing 
on the results of the study, but no attempt is being made to segregate 
the age groups* A table showing the age distribution is found in 
Appendix D2. 

No attempt was made to randomize the sample used in this 
study. The school wiHi the largest sample, consisting of 177 or almost 
half of the group of subjects, draws its students from an area which 
includes the whole range of the socio-economic strata. One school of 
sixty-four subjects is in an area which may be sli^tly biased tovrards 
the lower level of the socio-economic strata* The remaining two 
schools appear to be quite representative of the middle class* It 
would appear, therefore, that the sample is quite representative 
of the socio-economic strata of the Edmonton population, although 
no dffort was made to achieve this representativeness*

CHAPTER IV 


PREPARATION OF IHE RESEARCH INSTRIB/IENT 

The basic task in the construction of an instrument to 
sample the self-concept is to plan the metliod of selection of the 
items. Tile steps in the development of the self-concept rating 
schedule were as follavs; 

1. A list of statements was collected. 

2. These statements were edited. 

3. The statements were classified into four broad areas. 

4. A number of items was selected for a pilot study. 

5. Ihe edited statements were rated by five judges. 

6. A final list of statements was selected. 

7. The final list was edited. 

8. A sj^tem of scoring was developed. 

The first seven steps given above are discussed in this 
chapter. The chapter following is devoted to 'the last step, the 
development of the scoring system. 

1. THE COLLECTION OF STATEMENTS 

Statements used in existing instruments to study the self- 
concept were obtained from various sources. Seme came from statements 
made by client-centered therapy cases. Some were made up using 
adjectives from published lists. Still others were culled from 
existing personality scales. To obtain a list of statements for

this study, it was decided to obtain them from self-descriptive 
essays written by students. Jersild used similar essays to study 
tlie self-concept of a large number of young people. 

Grade nine and ten students in three Edmonton schools 
wrote essays on the topics, •''lAihat I Like About Myself” and ”Vihat 
I Dislike About Myself". To ensure the most favorable response 
set, students were asked not to write any identifying data on the 
essays. Essays were obtained on each topic from 186 students, 
ninety-nine female and eight-seven male. Samples of essays appear 
in Appendix Al. Prom these essays were selected self-referent 
statements which fit the accepted definition of the self-concept. 

A self-referent statement may be defined as a group of words which 
directly or indirectly describes an individual as he appears in his 
own eyes. In selecting the statements from essays an attempt was made 
to retain as much as possible the language used hj the adolescents. 

Some of the essays contained more than ten self-referent 
statements. Some contained only a few or none. Female students 
wrote longer essays, and these essays contained more self-referent 
statements. The total number of statements obtained was 318.

11. EDITING THE STATEviENTS 

In the work entailed in gleaning the statements from the 
essays it was inevitable that identical statements would be copied. 

Some of the statements, therefore, were discarded because of 
duplication. Other statements discarded or rewritten were those 
which appeared ambiguous, or were inconsistent with the definition 
of the concept of self. 

111. CLASSIFICATION OF THE STATEMENTS INTO AREAS 

IVhile the statements were being edited, as described above, 
they were examined carefully to detect whether any basis for 
classification could be discovered. It was decided to classify 
the statements into four broad areas in which this group of students 
appeared to have concepts of self. 

The statements selected fell into the following areas of 

i 

self-perception: 

1. The attributes of the self that have to do with the 
mind and mental processes. Tnis area will be referred 
to as the area of the mental self . 

2. The attributes of the self that have to do with 

character, temperament, inner resources, and emotional 
tendencies. This area will be called the area of the 
personal self. / 

3. The attributes of the self that have to do with inter¬ 
personal relationships. The statements include references 
to home and family, the school and school staff, and

members of the age group and other age groups. This 
ai'ea will be knovm as the area of the social self . 

4. Ihe attributes of the physica l self which embody the 
the individual’s personal characteristics, physical 
features, clothing, and grooming. 

Of the 246 statements. Appendix A2, tv^renty-seven were in the area 
of the mental self, ninety-two in the area of the personal self, 
seventy-four in the area of the social self, and fifty-three in the 
area of the physical self. 


1¥. THE PILOT STUDY 

A list of eight-two statements was selected a priori for 
a pilot study with seventy grade nine students in an Edmonton junior 
high school. In addition to rating these statements, students were 
asked to add statements to the list if they thought other statements 
would describe them better. No usable statements were obtained. 

This study provided much information for the construction and 
administration of the final form of the schedule. 

V. RATING TIE STATMiENTS 

Following the pilot study it was decided to em.ploy sane 
external criterion for the selection of the items for the research 
instrument. Five judges who had graduate training in psychology, 
and who were educators or former educators, were selected to rate 
the statements on a thj:’ee-point scale. All but one of the judges

was interviewed to explain the purpose of the study, the method 
of rating, and the criteria to follow in rating. The fifth judge, 
who had previous knowledge of the study, was contacted by letter 
in which detailed instructions for rating were given. The judges 
rated the statements as follows: 

VS very satis factor^" 

S satisfactory 
U unsatisfactory 

The criteria for judging may be summarized as follcvj-s: 

1* The suatement should denote a self-concept 

S. The statement should be in the language of the age-group. 

3. Ihe statement should be clear. 

4. The statement should be subject to just one interpretation. 

VI. SELECTIOh OF THE flNAL LIST OF STATH4ENTS 
Yyhen the judges' ratings were obtained, the follovfing values 
were assigned arbitrarily to the ratings: 

Z for VS, or ’’very satisfactory" rating, 

1 for S, or "satisfactory" rating, 

-1 for U, or "unsatisfactory" rating. 

It will be noticed that though there is a numerical spread of one 
between the first two ratings, there is a spread of two bety/een the 
last two. Tlriis was intentional, because it was felt that it would be 
safer to discard any statement about which there was any great doubt, 
and, hence, the negative score would reduce the total rating scores

when ratings were summed* 

After the ratings of the judges were scored, they were 
sunimed* The maximiim score obtained was nine and the minimum minus 
two. The judges* total scores are found in Appendix A2, in brackets 
follov/ing each statement. The pilot study showed that the number of 
items that can be rated in one class period should not be over one 
hundred. It was decided, therefore to copy all the statements first 
that had a total score of 9, then 8, and so on till just over a 
hundred statements were obtained, provided that all of the statements 
that had the same score were copied. The cutting score became six. 
Those statements whose score was belov/ six T/ere not copied. This 
procedure yielded a total of 119 statement, which are marked by 
asterisks in the list in Appendix A2. 

The next step was the checking of the statements for 
duplication on concept. To illustrate we can take the two statements: 

I airi bright, (rating score 7) 

I am intelligent, (rating score 9) 

In this instance the second statement was selected because of the 
higher judges* rating, because it is believed to better express the 
concept of mental ability, and because the term "bright" may be 
subject to more than one interpretation, i/^hen the ratings scores 
on two or more similar statements were the same, the one generally 
selected was the one which had no "unsatisfactory" rating. 

After this procedure was ccmpleted, a list of seventy-seven 
statem.ents was obtained. These had rating scores as follovirs:

Nmber of statements . 18 ZS 23 8 

Eleven of the statements which vfere selected for use had one 
"unsatisfactory*' rating each, while the remainder had no "unsatis¬ 
factory" ratings. 

Vll. FlhAL EDITING OF THE STATMENTS 

Ihe seventy-seven statements were again edited, using the 
following criteria: 

1. Each statement should denote a concept of self. 

2. Each statement should be in the language of the age-group. 

3. Each statement should be clear* 

4. Each statement should be subject to just one interpretation. 

5. Each statement should be short and simple. 

6. Each statement should apply equally well to both sexes. 

Some of the statements were revnritten to make the meaning more clear. 

To order tlie statements on the instrument the statements were 
numbered and pieces of paper with corresponding numbers were placed in 
a hat from where they were drawn and the statements written down. 

After several copies of the statements were typeT^vritten in 
the form they now appear on what is the schedule (Appendix B3), they 
were given to ten students in grades eight and nine for a further check 
for understanding and freedom from ambiguity. Since no difficulties in 
interpretation were reported, no further changes were made. 

The number of statements in each area are: mental self, 4j 
personal self, 32^ social self, 26; and physical self, 15.

A set of instructions was then prepared for the completion 

of the schedule (Appendix B2)• Ihe subjects were asked to rate 

themselves on each item as follows; 

T True of me — a good description of me 
MT Mostly true of me, but not completely orue 
NA Neither true nor false of me — not applicable to me 
MF Mostly false of me — like me only to a small amount 
F False of me — not like me at all. 

Ihe schedule is so constructed that the letters T, MT, NA, 
MF, and F appear after each statement. Subjects circled the letter 
or letters to indicate how true each statement was of them according 
to the directions given.

CHAPTER V 


DEVELOPING A SYSTEM OF SCORING 

It was necessary to develop a system of scoring the 
schedule for obtaining quantitative data to test some of the 
hj'potheses in this study* Elrst of all the desirability or 
undesirability of the values or qualities expressed by each 
statement had to be determined* 

To do this two classes of grade nine students from two 
of the schools that were used in the study were given copies of 
the schedule and instruction sheets (Appendix B4) for judging 
the statements* No criteria were used in the selection of these 
classes except that these classes were quite responsive during 
the previous administration of the schedule. Each student was 
instructed to put no identifying data on the schedule, and was 
asked to decide whether each statement, if true, expresses a 
desirable quality or feeling. To judge each statement, the student 
was asked to mark each statement using letters with these 
interpretations: 

D desirable; expresses a worthwhile quality or feeling 
MD mostly desirable, but not always so 
N neither desirable nor undesirable 
iviU mostly undesirable, but not always so 
U undesirable; expresses a quality or feeling that is 


not worthwhile

Scoring vveights were assigned to the letters as follows: 

D MD N MU U 
4 2 0-2-4 

The first step was to score the responses of tv/enty subjects from 
one school, and to tabulate the responses. These were added and a 
mean of the scores on each item was calculated. Then the responses 
of an additional tt/uelve subjects from the same school were tabulated, 
and the sums of tlie scores were added to those of the first group. 

The means of the scores on each item were compared by inspection for 
the twenty subjects and the thirty-t^TO subjects. Differences, to the 
nearest whole number, were found in only four items. 

Then means of the scores on the items were calculated for 
fifty-three subjects, after tabulating the resiponses of twenty-one 
subjects from another school. Since there was no change in the 
means, to the nearest whole number, from the previous calculations, 
no further computations were made. The means taken to the nearest 
unit 7;ere used as a weighting scale for the schedale. Table 111 
gives the means of the responses for each item for twenty, thirty- 
two, and fifty-three subjects, and the weights adopted for each 
item. The range of these weights is from -4 to / 4. One item, 
number 68, ”I worry about my health", has a weight of zero. 

The next step was to combine the weights obtained with 
the ratings on the schedule. Numerical values assigned to the responses 
on the schedule were:

M20 — means of scores for 20 subjects

¥if. — weighting scale adopted for each item. 

















53 


The values assigned to the ratings were multiplied the weights 
in the scoring of the items* It can be seen that an item which 
expresses a desirable quality or feeling will thus receive a positive 
value when rated T or MT, a zero value when rated NA, and a negative 
value when rated F or MF* An item which expresses an undesirable 
quality or feeling will receive a negative value when rated T or MT, 
a zero value when rated NA, and a positive value when rated F or MF* 
Hence, a positive score indicates the presence of desirable cr worth¬ 
while qualities or feelings regardless of the desirabilaty or un¬ 
desirability of the qualities cr feelings expressed in the item that 
is rated* 

To illustrate this, let us consider item number 1*, ”I am 
honest*” A weight of /4 has been assigned to this it©m* If the item 
is marked T, the products of /S and ^ give /8, a positive score* If 
this item is rated MF, then the product of -1 and ’/A is -4, a negative 
score* 

For item number 7*, ”I am stubborn*”, the weight assigned is 
-3* If the itan is marked MT, the product of /l and -3 gives a negative 
score of -3* However, if the item is marked F, the product of -2 and -3 
is a positive score of /6* 

The total possible score on the schedule is 594, with maximum 
area scores as follows: 

Mental Self 24 

Personal Self 278 

Social Self 192 

Physical ^elf 100 

To facilitate the scoring of the instrument, a window scoring 


key was developed

CHAPTER VI 


AREAS OF THE PERCEIVED SELF 


Each of the statements in the schedule was classified into 
one of the areas of self-perception: mental (four items), personal 
(thirty-two items), social (twenty-six items), and physical (fifteen 
items)The scores on each area, as well as the total score on the 
instrument, represent measures of self-acceptance in terms of the 
group ideal. Therefore, the data was examined for interrelatedness 
of self-acceptance in the four areas. It was found convenient to 
analyse this data for intra-sex differences at the same time. 

1. TEST-RETEST REIIABILIIY 

The schedule was given to sixty-four students in one of the 
schools eight days after the first administration. Usable returns 
were obtained from fifty-seven subjects, twenty-seven male and thirty- 
female. Table IV shows the means and standard deviations of the 
self-accep-bance scores for Hi is group for -the two tests.

The correlation coefficient of .907 is significantly different 
from zero at less than the .001 level of confidence. These data show 
that the acceptance of self scores are reliable measures. 

11.. RELAllONSHIPS BET/lfEM THE AREAS OF SELF-ACCEPTANCE 

Scores in each area were obtained for each subject. Correlation 
tables were constructed and product-moment correlation coefficients 
were calculated. Table V is a summary of the correlation coefficients 
obtained*

.40 ^ .11 

.77 .06 


Mental 

.52 ^ .10 




All the correlation coefficients are positive, and show a significant 
departure from zero at less than the .001 level of confidence. 


The largest coefficient of .77 indicates that the greatest 
relationship in self-acceptance is betvireen the areas of the personal 
and social self. A coefficient of .60 shows a fairly high relation¬ 
ship between the areas of the social and physical selves. Almost 
as large is the coefficient of correlation between the areas of the 
physical self and the social self, a value of .55. These marked 















56 


relationships might be explained on the basis of the rather close 
interaction of the physical, social and personal aspects in 
adolescence. 

Relationships between the mental self and the other ''selves” 
cannot be interpreted meaningfully, because there were only four* 
statements on the schedule in the area of the mental self. Hov/ever, 
even the slight positive correlation can be interpreted as being 
indicative os some relationships between this area of self-acceptance 
and the other three areas. 

It should be pointed out that area groupings of items cannot 
be taken too literally. This classification is an arbitrary one. 
There are a number of items virhich could equally well have been 
placed in som-e other area. Sane of the statements, doubtless, are 
less valid than others in the same area. In addition, there may be a 
degree of conmiunality among the items in ihe areas. The coefficients 
of correlation may be interpreted as determining the factors in one 
area that overlap with factors in another area. 

Positive correlations betvfeen the areas are interpreted as 
supporting the hjrpothesis that the relationships between the areas 
are significant. These relationships, hoivever, cannot be interpreted 
as indicative of the presence of various "selves” which would 
correspond to the areas. On the contrary, the conclusion might be 
that the self operates in a global fashion, with the self-functions 
so intimately intertwined that it is difficult to speak of one aspect

without considering the others. This conclusion is in accord 
that reached by Diller.^^^ Havighurst and MacDonald also report that 
as adolescents develop there is a progression of the ideal self wiih 
increasing age tovrard a composite self-ideal. 

111. INm-SEX HEEFEREDCES IN THE AREAS 

It was hypothesized that there were no sex differences in the 
self-concept of adolescents. The first step in analysing the differ¬ 
ences bet-ween the sexes was the computation of the means for the sexes 
in the areas of self-acceptance and means for the total self-acceptance 
scores. These were tested for significant differences. Table VI 
summarizes the self-acceptance scores. The distributions of scores 
is found in tables in Appendix G. 

The mean scores in the areas were higher for female subjects 
in the personal, social and physical areas, and only slightly Icwer 
in the area of the mental self. The m.ean of the total scores was 
higher for females than for males. 

The difference between the means in the areas of the mental 
self was found to be non-significant. The difference between the 
means for the social area was found to be significant at the .01 
level of confidence. Girls were found to be more self-acceptant 
in this area than boys. In the area of the physical self the

difference, in favor of girls, was significant at the #001 level of

the null hypothesis must be rejected for the areas of the social

The difference between the means of the total scores was 

found to be significant at the *03 level of confidence, again in 

favour of the girls. It would appear that this difference was 

caused mainly by the significant differences between the means 

in the areas of the social and physical "selves”. 

Little evidence in reports of previous studies has been 

obtained regarding the presence of significant differences betw'een 

the sexes in their self-concepts, McGregor reported, however, that — 

There did appear to be a slight tendency for the girls, more 
than for boys, to be concerned with the general mental area 
of self-percept! on, and for the boys, more than to be 

concerned with the physical aspects of the self 

No sex differences in the area of the mental self were found in the 

present study, though this investigation was limited by the small 

number of items in this area. 

Jourard and iiemy report some sex-differences in body-image, 

or the physical self. They say — 

It may be concluded that women have more highly differentiated 
body-images than men; that among women, the self-concept and 
the body-image are differentiated to an equivalent degree; 
that women and men do not differ in degree of differentiation 
of the self-concept; and, finally, that men differentiate 
their self-concepts to a greater degree than their body-image, 

The differences in self-acceptance in the physical area may 

be due to the differential rate of development between boys and girls. 

It may be a result of the different values placed by the sexes on the 

various aspects of the physical self obtained in this study.

The difference between acceptance of self scores in the 
social area may be accounted for by the higher degree of social 
integration that is usually found among girls of this age-group 
as compared with boys. 

To obtain additional evidence of sex differences, responses 
to individual items were analysed. To obtain measures that would 
be independent of group valuations which were used to obtain scale 
values, self-acceptance scores were not used. First of all 
frequencies of T and MT responses for each item were combined to 
give a '’True” category, and F and MF responses were combined to 
give a "False” category (Appendix F) for each sex. Then percentages 
for these combined ratings were calculated, gi-'/ing one percentage 
for "True” responses, to be referred to as %T, and one percentage 
for "False” responses, or The differences, %T - ^F, were 

calculated for each item for the two sexes (Appendix E) in each 
area of the perceived self. This procedure gave a measure of the 
excess of ^T-ratings over ^F-ratings. These percen'bages for each 
item for male subjects were subtracted from those obtained for 
fern-ale subjects, and examined for significant differences. 

No significant sex differences were found in the area of the 
mental self, the greatest difference occuring for item 10, "I think 
slowly.” 

In the area of the personal self, the differences between 
%T - %F values were found to be significant at less than the 0.005

boys in four items, 16, 35, 38, and 47* It will be noticed that 
all these items bear negative scale values. In the remaining 
items the differences were in favor of the girls, t^o of the items 
(18 and 76) having positive scale values, and two (20 and 39) 
having negative scale values. 

The greatest difference in this area was for item 18, ’’Religion 
plays an important part in my life”. Over sixty-six per cent of the 
girls rated this statement T or MT, and almost t^Tenty-one per cent 
rated it F or MF. Only thirty-seven per cent of the boys rated this 
item T or MT, while almost forty-four per cent of them rated it 
F or MF. Other items where differences are large are 35, 38, and 39. 
More girls (forty-one per cent) than boys (twenty-three per cent) 
feel that their feelings are easily hurt. More girls (fifty per cent) 
v;-orry about little things than boys (thirty-six per cent). Hov/ever, 
though the boys split evenly between ’’True” and ’’False” ratings, 
tffenty-nine per cent of them rated statement 38, ”I worry about little 
things”, as not-applicable to them, while only fourteen per cent of 
the girls rated this statement NA. 

In the area of the social self significant differences at less 
than the .003 level of confidence v/ere found in nine statem.ents 
(Table Vlll), all in favor of the girls. Two of the items, 21 and 45, 
have negative scale values. The greatest difference in this area was 
found in item 12, ”lily teachers like me”. Seventy-eight per cent of the 
girls rated this item T or MT, while only fifty-three per cent of the 
boys rated the item T or MT. Thirty-one per cent of the boys

It is suggested by the date for this area that there are 
marked sex differences in at least nine of the b/'^enty-six items of 
the schedule. More girls than boys felt that they are liked by 
teachers, and are respected 1:^ others. More girls felt that they are

courteous, patient, helpful, and dependable. More girls than boys 
felt that they get along with the opposite sex. More boys, however, 
felt that they make a bad impression on people, and that they are 
avoided by others. 

In the area of the physical self the differences in the nine 
items shown in Table IX were significant at less than the .001 level 
of confidence. The largest difference is for item 51, ”I am a good 
dancer". Almost seventy-three per cent of the girls felt that they 
are good dancers with only fourteen per cent rating this item F or MF» 
In contrast, only thirty-seven per cent of the boys rated this item 
T or M T, and forty-four per cent rated it F or MF. It is quite 
common for the earlier-maturing girls to learn dancing earlier than 
boys, therefore this difference is understandable. Another large 
difference was found for item 54, "I have good taste in clothes"* 

This item appears to apply more to girls than to boys, as does 
item 13, "I wear my clothes well". TWenty-two per cent of the boys 
gave NA-rating to item 13, and t^venty-eight per cent did the same 
for item 54. About ten per cent more boys than girls felt that they 
are not the right height, and about fifteen per cent more girls than 
boys felt that they are neat and tidy. 

Significant sex differences have been found in the degree 
of self-acceptance in the areas of the social and physical self. 

This difference, however, may be due mainly to a difference in the 
degree to which the sexes differentiate their "selves". Self-concept 
differences were found for a number of items. For seme items the

CHAPTER Vll 


SELF-ACCEPTANCE AND INTELLIGENCE 

To test the hypothesis that there is a relationship between 
an individual's self-concept and intelligence test scores, product- 
moment coefficients were calculated between raw scores on the "Ctis 
S-A Test of Mental Ability, Intermediate Form A”, and self-acceptance 
scores and area scores obtained by using the rating schedule. Raw 
scores rather than Intelligence Quotients were used because raw 
scores are unaffected b^r chronological age. In effect, the relatedness 
between mental age and self-acceptance was investigated. 

The correlation coefficients that were calculated are given in 

Table X, Positive but small coefficients were obtained for the

mental, personal, and social areas, and for the total self-acceptance 
scores, while a small negative coefficient was obtained for the 
physical area. Non of the coefficients were found to differ significantly 
from zero except the coefficient for the mental self, a value of .S6. 

This can be interpreted as indicative of some slight relationship 
bet^feen an individual's self-acceptance in the mental area as measured 

by the four* items on the schedule, and performance on tlrie Otis test*

No relationship was found between total self-acceptance scores on 
tlie instrument used in this study and the raw scores on the Otis 
test. 

It is conceivable that self-concept discrepancies may be 
related to learning. Axelrod^ Cowen, and Keilizer found positive 
relationships betiveen these variables using Bills Index of Adjustment 
and Values. Bills believes that client-centered teaching has the 
same effect that client-centered therapy has, that is, that client- 
centered teaching narrows the gap between an individual's self-concept 
and his self-ideal.

CliAPTER Vlll 


posmw MD NEGATIVE SELF-COimCEPT 

The statemen;ts in the self-concept rating schedule can be 
classified as positively or negatively directed perceptions of self. 
The criterion used for determining the direction of the statements 
in the schedule was the average rating of the desirability or 
worthwhileness of feelings or equalities expressed in the statements 
as indicated by a group of fifty-thiree subjects. The rating procedure 
was discussed in Chapter and the scale values for the items are 
given in Table 111, Of the seventy-seven statements in the schedule 
fifty-two were rated as reflecting worthvdiile feelings or qualities. 
This is the group of statements that erqjresses positive concepts of 
self^ andj therefore were assigned positive scale values, TvYeniy-feur 
statements that were rated by the criterion group as reflecting 
undesirable feelings or qualities express negative concepts of self^ 
and bear negative scale values. Classification of the statements 
into positive and negative self-concept statements for the total group 
and by sexes is found in Appendix F, For one statement, number 68, 

”I worry about my health”, the average group rating was so closely 
divided between desirable and undesirable that it was assigned a scale 
value of zero. Theoretically this statement would represent a neutral 
or ambivalent concept of self. This statement was arbitrarily listed 
Y.n th the positive self-concept statements, but Tfas not included in the 
discussion here, since it appears to have more than one meaning.

Valuations of all the statements in the schedule, however, 
may be made in a positive or negative direction according to the 
scoring system that was em.ployed. In this way a positive self- 
concept statement rated false(F) or mostly false (MF) would 
reflect a negative self-concept* Similarly, a negative self-concept 
statement rated false (F) or mostly false (MF) would reflect a positive 
self-concept. It is this broader interpretation of positive and 
negative self-concept that was adopted for this study. In tliis way 
^ self-concept is defined as reflecting a positively- 

directed awareness of a feeling, value, or trait of some aspect of 
the self. In the same manner, a negative self - concept is defined as 
a negatively-directed av/areness of a feeling, value, or trait of some 
aspect of the self. Using these definitions, the self-concept is 
negative or positive according to the direction of reaction, true or 
false, tovrards the statement that is being rated* 

1* POSITIVE SELF-CONCEPT 

To select positive self-concept statements that reflect a high 
positive concept of self, statements that were rated true (T) or mostly 
true (MT) by over ninety per cent of the subjects were arbitrarily 
selected. These statements for the total group of subjects are 
listed in Table XI, with percentage (T74'dT) -values given for each 
item.. The- fifteen statements selected all reflect feelings or 
qualities of character, personality or interpersonal relations*

in the table have maxjjnum scale values of four* Not only did these 
adolescents feel that the qualities and feelings e^^ressed in these 
statements are worthwhile, but also they rated themselves high on 
these items* 

Negative self-concept statements that were rated false (F) 
or mostly false (MF) by more than seventy per cent of the group vrere 
selected as reflecting a high positive self-concept* Seven statements 
were selected and li.sted in Table Xll. Here again all the statements

of the subjects' awareness of the physical aspects of self, nine 
of the fourteen# Here, also, are found two statements about the 
mental self. This is in contrast to the positive self-concept 
where a predominant number of statements reflect aspects of 
character, personality, and interpersonal relations. This might 
indicate that these adolescents are more concerned with, or are 
more critical of the physical aspects of self than with personal or 
social aspects. A number of statements in this group reflect 
aspects of personal appearance. It can, be noted, also, that there 
is considerable variation of scale values for this group of items, 
indicating that all these statements were not considered equally 
desirable by individuals of the criterion group# 

It is probably significant that, although more than seventy- 
five percent of the subjects rated the items in Table ]Q.l false of 
them, between five and thirteen per cent rated the items true of 
them. For the fifteen positive items in Table XI, not more than 
4#1 per cent of the subjects rated the statements false. In 
addition, for most of the negative items the percentages of not- 
applicable (NA) ratings were generally much higher than for positive 
items# This might indicate that many adolescents v/ere not willing 
to divulge their feelings on the negative traits and values on the 
negative self-concept statements, or that they might be concealing 
areas of concern# It is probable, hovTever, tliat a rating of NA was 
made for som.e statements that were not understood by the subjects#

There was evidence that the rating of the negative statements 
was different from the rating of positive statements. Mors subjects 
gave positively-directed or desirable ratings for positi.ve items than 
for negative items. Over sixty percent of the positive items were 
rated T or MT by over seventy-five per cent of the subjects. Not 
quite thirty per cent of the negative items were given F or MF 
ratings by seventy-five per cent of the subjects. Might this suggest 
that negati'^re statements are more discriminating of the self-concept 
of adolescents than positive statements?

CHAPTER IX 


’’TYPICAL" SELF-CONCEPT OF ADOLESCENTS 

One of the purposes of this study was to describe the self- 
concept of the group of adolescents that was used in the invest¬ 
igation* Although the description must be limited to the seventy- 
seven statements which constitute the self-concept rating schedule, 
it was possible to discover some meaningful patterns which could be 
isolated and consolidated into a descriptive analysis of this group 
of subjects* A summary of typical responses by sex was m*ade, in 
order to arrive at a composite self-picture of this group of adolescents* 

To select the statements that are most representative of self¬ 
descriptions of adolescents, true (T) and mostly true (MT) ratings 
for each item were combined, as were false (F) and mostly false (MF) 
ratings* Then the percentage of the combined ’’True” ratings was 
divided by the percentage of ’’False’’ ratings for each positive 
statement. Similarly, the percentage of the combined ’’False’’ ratings 
was divided by the percentage of combined ’’True’’ ratings for each 
negative statement* In this way a ratio was obtained of the percentage 
of subjects who responded to each item favourably to the percentage who 
responded to the item unfavourable. An obtained value of 180 for a 
statement, for instance, indicates that for 190 subjects who rated an 
item favourable there was only one subject who rated it unfavourable. 

Ihe ratios obtained were used to rank order the statements ty sex.

a composite self-picture of the adolescent girl in this study. Of 
the tyrelve "most popular” statements thus obtained and listed in 
Table XV, all except number 8, ’’People who kncn^Y me like me", were 
rated T or MT by over ninety per cent of the girls. Not more than 
1.5 per cent of the girls rated these statements F or MF. All the 
statements except number 44, "I have good taste in clothes”, reflect 
aspects of character and personality, or interpersonal relations. 

Tiiese statements also have high scale values indicating the desirability 
of the feelings and values represented by these statements. 

Six top-ranking negative statements were selected as represent¬ 
ative of this group of girls and listed in Table XVI. These are the 
statements that proved "least popular”, and were rated F or MF by over 
seventy-six per cent of the girls. Besides drawing a lower percentage 
of favourable ratings than the positive statements in table XV, each 
of these negative statements also drew a higher percentage of unfavour¬ 
able ratings. This of course, can be seen in the lower ratios of

One of the six statements, number 48, "I am clumsy", deals with a 
physical aspect of self, while the remaining statements in Table XVI 
reflect an individual's interpersonal relations* 

Twelve lowest-ranking positive statements were selected as 
representative of how the group of girls rated themselves unfavourably 
on the positive statements. Item 68, "I worry about my health", was 
not listed with the other statements in Table XVll because of its

ambiguous meaning. Between fourteen and twenty-eight per cent of the 
fem.ale subjects rated these statements F or MF, and between fifty and 
seventy-five per cent rated them T or MT. 

Of the twelve statements in Table XVll, seven deal with aspects 
of an individual’s physical self-description, and tv¥o with mental 
aspects of self. Three statements of self-description, number 37, 

"I am attractive to members of the opposite sex”, number 53, ”I am 
good-looking", and number 34, "I am attractive”, were rated M by 
approximately thirty per cent of the female subjects. These three 
statements deal -with physical attractiveness or appearance. A high 
percentage of the girls were either not able to express their opinions 
on these statements, or were unyd-lling to divulge their feelings about 
their looks. Only about fifty per cent of the girls felt that they are 
good-looking, attractive, or attractive to the opposite sex. 

For the six low-ranking negative statements large percentages 
of unfavourable ratings were given. These statements are listed in 
Table X7111. All but number 10, "I think slov/ly”, reflect aspects 
of personality. Over thirty-five per cent of the girls felt that they 
are stubborn, and that they daydream, a lot. Over forty per cent said 
tiiat their feelings are easily hurt, and that they can’t stand criticism. 
Almost fifty per cent of the girls felt that they think slovfly, while 
under forty per cent rated this item F or MF. The items in Table X\/lll 
have lov'^er absolute values than other item.s discussed in this section*

A theoretical "typical" boy would possess the self-concept 
representative of the average ratings of the group of male subjects 
used in this study* 

Twelve top-ranking positive statements were selected as giving 
a composite self-picture to the "typical" adolescent boy* These 
statements are listed in order of rank in Table XIX* As for girls, 
all these statements reflect aspects of character and personality, or 
interpersonal relations* Friendship, honesty, truthfulness, and 
ability to get along with others are not only valued highly by

111. ANALYSIS OF "TYPICAL” SLLF-CONCEPT iiATINGS 

Though it is difficult to describe a "t;i/pical" boy or girl, 
an attempt has been made to analyse the data for characteristic 
self-concept responses, and to weave them into a meaningful pattern. 
Despite the counterbalancing effects of individual differences, of 
which there was much evidence, trends of self-perception were revealed 
by both the boys' and girls• groups and by the total group. 

It is important to point out that there are certain consider¬ 
ations that must be taken into account when dealing with data on 
attitudes toward self. It has often been questioned whether an 
individual will discuss his private beliefs with any degree of frank¬ 
ness and sincerity, or whether he could give much information even if 
he were willing to divulge aspects of his selfhood. It was found that 
in self-descriptive essays written by adolescents for this study, that 
many subjects discussed even the most intimate aspects of self. Tnis 
was in part due, it was felt, to the fact that these essays bore no 
identifying data. It was found, ha*Tever, that a number of subjects, 
about twenty per cent, gave fev; usable self-referent statements in the 
essays. It is conceivable, therefore, that some individuals who rated 
the fixed number of statements, might have given incorrect responses 
to many of the items in the schedule. 

Another consideration that might affect the results that were 
obtained is whether an individual, when asked to reveal feelings and 
values about self, will feel under pressure to conform to social

expectations and to group ideals. If this is so, then the data 
might indicate a combination of group ideals and self-concept values* 
This would tend to obscure the interpretation of the results. 

The defensiveness of some of the subjects should also be taken 
into account. A large percentage of NA ratings for some items is 
somewhat puzzling. These might be interpreted in several ways. A 
high number of NA ratings for a particular item may mean that some 
subjects did not understand the statement. It may mean that some 
subjects were not -willing to divulge the desired information, or that 
they were unable to give it. Is it, then, the real self that is 
revealed by responses to the statements? 

A criticism often made of ratings is that, though the data are 
often treated objectively, the ratings are often extremely subjective. 
Kowe-ver, most data are treated objectively -without regard to underlying 
reasons or motives which may have promp-bed the rating reaction. In this 
way, therefore the investigator is dealing with a purely objective t^^pe 
of response. It is the interpretation of the response that must be 
quite subjective, since much of the data cannot be treated mechanically. 

It was found that for a number of statements a large percentage 
of ratings were in the desirable direction. For fevver statements a 
marked percentage of ratings were in the undesirable direction. A 
high percentage of not-applicable (NA) ratings for some items by both 
sexes is difficult to interpret. Responses to negative statements 
appear to follow a different pattern from responses to positive state¬ 
ment, the ratings tending to be less extreme.

However, a distinct pattern of reaction has been observed for 
most statements. On the basis of the results obtained, there is 
certain justification for saying that, though individual differences 
are present, the group of adolescents under investigation have a 
rather "■t^'pical" self-concept by sex, and for the total group*

CHAPTER X 


SUIVIMARI AND CONCLUSIONS 

It is the purpose of tliis chapter to present a condensed and 
simplified account of the conclusions reached in this study, to 
examine the limitations of the study, and to suggest avenues of 
future research. 


1. LSvIITATIONS OF THE STUDY 


The Sample 

Individuals constituting the sample of grade nine students 
from Y/hich data v>rere obtained were not selected randomly. Four 
intact group from four Edmonton junior high school were used. 

Though this sample is believed to be representative of the Edmonton 
grade nine population, it is quite probable that this group may have 
been affected ty selective factors which are unkncn^. In addition, 
neither the total group, nor the separate boys’ or girls’ groups 
were homogeneous with regard to age. Considering the differential 
that normally exists in physical and social development between the 
two sexes, as well as within each sex group, it can be seen that 
age-spread can have a possible obscuring influence on the results, 
when one deals with individuals v^ho are in the developmental stage. 
In ■'/iew of these limitations the results of this investigation are 
not meant to apply outside the group studied.

The Research Instrument 

There is no certainty that adequate coverage of all important 
aspects of selfhood can be obtained from student essays. Some of 
the most ^rLtal aspects of self might not have been revealed because 
of lack of verbal facility on the part of the subjects, inability 
or refusal to divulge all aspects of the "real me", or because of 
defensiveness of some subjects. In addition, some significant self- 
referent statements might have inadvertantly been omitted during the 
selection of the statements from the essays. 

Sane of the statements in the self-concept rating schedule 
appear to be unsuitable for the age-group. Item 23, "I have an 
inferiority complex", was not understood by some of the subjects. 
Statements 13, "I wear m^^ clothes well", 54, "I have good taste in 
clothes", and 67, "I have nice hands", appeared to apply more to 
girls than to boys. Number 68, "I worry about my health", seems to 
have more than one m.eaning. Item 55, "I am good at arguing", reflects 
a desirable quality to some but an undesirable quality to others. 

The self-acceptance scores are dependent on the weighting of 
the desirability of the values expressed by only fifty-three subjects, 
about fourteen per cent of the total group. Therefore, the values 
obtained do not completely reflect the self-ideal of the group as a 
whole• 

The scoring system that was developed is crude and tinie- 
consuming. Positive and negative values whj.ch are indicative of 






.f. 





91 


desirab?Mity or undevsirability of values expresses for each item, 
together with unequal scale values for each item, made scoring 
laborious and subject to error. 

Other Limi t ations 

In eT?a.luating the results it is important to bear in mind 
that studies in perception of self and the many related facets of 
selfhood are exploring a field that, is in its infancy. Hence, there 
are limitations that are inherent in such studies such as, in¬ 
consistencies and incompleteness of theory, lack of objective external 
validating criteria, and the difficulty of treating subjectively- 
obtained data, 

11, CONCLUSIONS 

The results of the study vrere highly gratifying and suggest 
that it is possible to construct help.ful objective instruments that 
can be employed to obtain evidence to test h^^potheses related to 
self-functions# The construction of a research instrument from self¬ 
referent statements obtained from self-descriptive essays appeared to 
be a feasible method, though no assumption can be m-ade that such an 
instrument encompasses all the important aspects of selfhood# Evaluation 
of the direction of desirability of statements by a criterion group 
was economical of time, and produced adequate data for this study# 

The test-retest reliability coefficient of 0.91 for fifi^^- 
one subjects shovrs that self-acceptance scores on the schedule are

reliable measures* The range of the self-acceptance scores, and the 
standard deviation obtained, indicate that the schedule discriminates 
between individuals* concept of self# It is important to point out 
that this study dealt with groups as a whole with no attempt at 
differentiating among individuals# 

The statements on the schedule were classified into four broad 
areas of mental, personal, social and physical aspects of self¬ 
perception# Product-moment correlation coefficients between the means 
of the areas were in the range of 0#31 to 0#77# The lowest relation¬ 
ship was found between the mental and physical areas. The highest 
relationship appeared between the social and personal "selves**# All 
relations were found to be significant# These relationships may be 
interpreted as indicating that the aspects of the self are so 
intimately intertwined that it would appear that the self operates in 
a global fashion. When consideration is given to the overlapping, 
over two or more areas, of the values expressed by the individual 
statements, there is additional justification in saying that classi¬ 
fication into areas was at least partially imposed, being a convenient 
way of examining self-relationships in this study# 

Analysis of self-acceptance scores for the areas produced 
evidence of significant sex differences between the means of self¬ 
acceptance scores for the social and physical areas, and for means 
of total self-acceptance scores. Strong evidence was obtained that 
girls are more self-accepting than boys, particularly in the areas of

the perceived social self and the perceived physical self. 

A further analysis of individual items where percentage 
differences bet^veen "True” and "False" ratings were great, confirmed 
the presence of sex differences. No significant sex differences 
were found in the area, of the mental self, in which there were only 
four statements. However, significant sex differences appeared for 
nine of the thirty-two items in the personal area. In the area of 
the social self, significant sex differences were found for ten of the 
twenty-six items, and in the area of the physical self significant 
sex differences were found for nine of the fifteen statements. Most 
of the differences were in favor of the girls. 

The presence of significant relationships between intelligence 
and self-acceptance scores was not supported by the data. Though a 
lovf positive relationship between raw scores on the Otis Test and 
self-acceptance scores was found for the area of the mental self, 
the relationship was not significant. 

The data was examined for meaningful patterns of positive and 
negative concepts of self. Some of the statements were more popular 
than ethers, eliciting a greater percentage of desirab3.e ratings than 
others. A3most all of the most popular positive self-rconcept state¬ 
ments that received favourably-directed responses reflect aspects of 
character and personality, and interpersonal relations. More than 
fifty per cent of the negative self-concept statement that received 
unfavourably-directed ratings reflect aspects of physical selfhood.

This may be interpreted as suggesting that the adolescents * positive 
self-concept is basically composed of a large proportion of social 
and personal values, while the negative self-concept is composed of 
more physical values than social and personal values# 

Examination of the “most popular” and "least popular" state¬ 
ments produced some interesting information about the "typical" self- 
concept of the group studied# The most valued aspects of self were 
those relating to interpersonal relations, and it was those values 
that both the boys* and girls* groups said they possess# It was found 
that both groups were not as positive about the physical aspects of 
self as ikbout the personal and social aspects# Both groups showed a 
greater reluctance towards making positive statooaents about their 
physical appearance# In this area there were more differences of 
opinion, and more unfavourably-directed responses, especially towards 
negative statements# This concern with physical aspects of self maybe 
evidence of the adolescents* adjustment toward physical growth# 

A large nmber of statements elicited large percentages of 
"not-applicable" ratings# There appeared to be more division of 
opinion on sane statemoats, and many subjects did not take a position# 
Is it possible that these responses point to areas of greater concern 
or poor adjustment? Do "not-applicable" ratings indicate defensiveness 
of the subjects on certain aspects of self, and might defensiveness of 
the subject point towards a denial to awareness of certain aspects of 


self?

Analysis of typical responses again revealed some sex 
differences, especially for sonie of the negative items, and more 
particularly for the low-ranking negative ones. More girls than 
boys felt that they were stubborn, that they daydreamed a lot, and 
that their feelings were easily hurt. Mere boys than girls felt 
that they were restless and envious. 

Negative statements appeared to have been rated differently 
from positive statements. Besides drawing more unfavourably-directed 
responses than positive statements, they also elicited more not- 
applicable res^jonses. It is possible that negative statements might 
be more differentiating bet'A’-een indiAd.duals than were positive 
statements* 

This investigation confirms the -/iew that data drawn from the 
internal frame-of-reference can be treated not only qualitatively, 
but also quantitatively, to obtain e^/idence for testing hypotheses 
related to the self-theory^ of personality, and to discover the order 
which exists in the phenomenal world of the individual. 

13.1. RECaaiENDATIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY 

Although a nuxiber of studies in the area of self-perception 
can be suggested, the recommendations here 'vill deal only with those 
questions which have grown out of this particular investigation. 

The scoring system used in this study can be improved to make 
the scoring of the schedule more economical of time and less subject

to error. Some of the items should probably be discarded and some 
reworded. Some items could be added to the area of mental self to 
make study in this area more meaningful. 

Very revrarding research in this field might test the h^npothesis 
that there is a relationsliip between learning or achievement and the 
individual’s concexot of self. 

A stud^’' of the self-concerjt of different age-groups in 
adolescence might reveal some ■'/aluable information relating to the 
development of the concept of self, and provide useful insights into 
the stability of the self-concex^t of this group. 

A study of the differences in res^jonses to positive and 
negative statements of self-perception might result in illuminating 
findings• 

An analysis of non-ccamnital responses might reveal some 
valuable information regarding certain aspects of selfhood. Such 
responses appear to be closely related to defensiveness of subjects. ^ 

A study of defensiveness might prove useful in explaining the relation¬ 
ships between this t^^e of response and personality adjustment. Such 
a studj'" might reveal some common elements among indi-'vdduals who rated 
some of the statements "not-applicable” to them. 

f^jrther study of sex differences is warranted, particularly 
in the areas of the social and jphysical self. Measures of discrepancies 
betvreen self-conceiDt and ideal-concept might be employed to investigate 


sex difference

better than most other boys. 

I get along fairly well ivith people. Scmetjjnes some boys and

to talk to people . I am usually polite . 

My school work is average Y?lth the exception of mathematics. 

I like my art talent especially dra,rfing cartoons. 

I am not good-locking but my appearance is passable. I have 
nice hair but my complexion is not very good. I like my postiure and 
my build .

things that are not important* Sometimes this keeps me awake.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADMINISTERING 
Otis Self-Administering Test of Mental Ability 
and the Self-Concept Schedule 

1. Purpose of the Study * The Self-Concept Schedule was prepared for the 
purpose of getting information from grade nine students on how they 
view themselves* All the statements in the schedule were obtained 
from self-descriptive essays written hy about 190 grade nine students 
in Edmonton schools* The results of this study will be used as a 
basis for an M*Ed* thesis which is planned to describe the self- 
concept of this group and to discover the relationship between the 
self-concept and intelligence test scores* 

2* The Otis Test should be administered prior to the administration of 
the schedule* Please follow the directions given in the manual* In 
completing the identifying data on page one the students should be 
instructed to write the class number in the space marked "City”. 

3. The Self-Concept Schedule should be administered within one week of 
the administration of the Otis Test* 

4* After passing out the copies of the instruction sheet and the 

schedule instruct the students to complete the identi^ring data on 
the first page of the schedule* 

5* Read aloud the instructions on the sheet while the class reads 

silently* Make certain that each student understands the directions* 
Bring attention to the fact that the letters stand for 

T for truej MT for mostly touej NA for not ^plicable 
"mF for mostly falser F for false. 

Pencils should be used and the marks made clearly legible* 

After the students have begun working, check to see that they are 
following the directions* 

6* The schedule can be easily completed in one class period and there 
is no time limit* However, to ensure that all students complete 
all items, they should be told when half the time has elapsed and 
when there are 5 minutes of the class period remaining* Encourage 
the students to make certain that all items are marked* 

7* Collect the answer sheets and instruction sheets. Place the answer 
sheets in the envelope provided, and complete the information 
requested on each envelope*

APPENDIX B2 


INSTRUCTIONS 


119 


Everyone needs to know more about himself, but seldom 
do we stop to look at ourselves as we really are. On the 
following pages are statements used by young people to 
describe themselves. You are asked to mark each state¬ 
ment as directed below. Your answers are confidential 
and will not be read by anyone not concerned with the study. 
Be honest with yourself so that your description will be 
a true measure of how you look at yourself. 

The letters following each statement have the following 
meanings: 

T true of me - a good description of me 
MT mostly true of me, but not completely true 
NA neither true nor false - not applicable to me 
MF mostly false of me - like me only to a small extent 

F false of me - not like me at all. 

Read each statement and decide how true it is of you. 

Then circle the letter or letters following each statement 
to indicate how true it is of you. 

EXAMPLESs 

a, I am an agreeable person. T ( Mt')' NA MF F 

b. I am an adult, T MT NA MF 

Following statement (a) the letters MT are circled 
indicating that the statement is mostly true of you , but 
not completely true, 

Fellowing statement (b) the letter F is circled 
indicating that the statement is false of you - not like 
you at all. 

Please make only one circle after each statement. 

Complete all the items. There is no time limit, but do 
not spend too much time on any statement so that you can 
complete all statements during this class period.
