CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 

The purpose of the study 

The ensuing study is rooted in the broad problem of French- 
language instruction in Alberta high schools as it affects two 
groups of students* The first group consists of those who have 
some knowledge of the French tongue beyond that acquired in oral 
French and the regular high school courses; this will be called 
the French-background group* The second group is made up of those 
students who have no such background and will be called the non- 
French-background group# The former group comes largely from 
French-speaking homes and has frequently had the additional ad¬ 
vantage of having taken all or part of the elementary French course 

authorized by the School Act, Section 154# The problem is further 

1 

complicated by the fact that some pupils of non-French parentage 
have also taken French in the elementary grades. For convenience 
these groups will be herein; referred to as group FB and group NFB 
respectively and these designations will by extension include both 
the papers and the marks of the students concerned. 

The core of this investigation is an analysis of the Depart¬ 
mental examination papers in French 5 written in July, 1944. An 
attempt is made to separate and compare the two groups of papers in 
order to discover what advantage, if any, is enjoyed by group FB 
and how the marks received by group NFB are affected. Since all the 
marks on each grade XII examination paper are transmuted to fit a 
partially preordained frequency distribution, presumably warranted 
by the large number of cases, it is clear that the inclusion in 

such a distribution of a la rge atypical group(FB) might seriously

alter and invalidate some or all of the other (NEB) marks, This 
problem will require a determination of the numerical strength 
of both EB and NEB groups and of the extent, if an 3 r, to which the 
former 1 s performance is atypical —presumably superior. More spec¬ 
ifically, it is planned to separate the two groups of marks and 
compare their distributions, then to change the NEB marks back to 
the original raw scores and, following the Department of Educations 
transmutation scheme, to convert these into the marks which would 
have been assigned had the BB scores never entered into the orig¬ 
inal population. This done, one has only to subtract from these 
c orrected NEB marks the marks actually recorded in order to determ¬ 
ine the deprivation of the NEB marks. It should then be possible to 
determine the number of students who would have received a higher 
letter rating, for example, A instead of B, but for the deprivation. 

An effort will also be made to analyse the scores,treating 
each test item separately, and to classify errors for each group 
in the hope that' such an anal 3 rfeical comparison will shed further 
light on the attainments, problems and needs of each group. 

These factual comparisons will be supplemented by a compar¬ 
ison of the opinions of teachers of the two groups as reported in 
a questionnaire containing lists of 1.objectives believed to be 
attained or attainable, 2. obstacles to success, and 3. realia or 
vitalizing instructional aids. Without any intention of suggesting 
that such opinions must be accepted as facts,a mathematical compar¬ 
ison of expressed opinbns is presented for whatever value it may 
have in appraising the total effective situation. 

The second chapter refers to a few salient factors in the 
general setting from which the narrower problem is probably

inseparable. Although perhaps not strictly an integral part of the 
investigation, such a general survey seems advisable for several 
reasons including: the practical nature of the study, the scantiness 
of previous research in the field,and the variety, complexity and 
urgency of associated practical problems. An effort will be made to 
limit this section to factors bearing directly upon conclusions and 
suggestions. 

Finally, it may be noted here that conclusions, being rather 
detailed and varied, will be found throughout chapters IV to VII 
under the appropriate sub-headings and are largely summarized by 
the tables. The concluding chapter is then devoted chiefly to a 
criticism of conclusions and a rather general summary o± the sit¬ 
uation with a few tentative suggestions.

CHAPTER II 


TWO BACKGROUNDS COMPARED 

Any approach to completeness in surveying the chief background 
differences affecting the French-language status and needs of the 
two groups of students under comparison ?rould far exceed the scope 
of this study* It nonetheless seems desirable in the interests of 
coordinated interpretation of results to seek some light on such 
questions as the following. What,in view of modern knowledge of 
philosophy,psychology,sociology and linguistics, is a tenable set 
of objectives for each group? What is the true value of French as 
a regular subject on the high school curriculum for each group? How 
does Canada’s bilingual culture affect the problems and needs of 
each group? What factors in the Alberta picture bear most directly 
upon the comparison? In particular ,a research findings based on 
Alberta data are available? While these questions cannot be answered 
here, a few observations follow. 

Objectives and their "Validity 

The validity of a wide range of objectives, both practical 
and cultural, for FB students appears too obvious to be seriously 
challenged. The extent to which M3 objectives differ from NFB object¬ 
ives in Alberta will be the subject of some quantitative comparisons 
In chapter Y. 

.One frequently encounters the view, among both laymen and 

educationists, that for a large percentage of the NFB students in 

our high schools foreign languages, including French, lack practical, 

real-life value sufficient to justify the heavy requirements of time, 

effort and expense. This seems due, in part at least, to apparent 

Incongruity between newer statements of educational ideals on the 

one hand and more traditional objectives,curricula,texts and methods 
on the other. It is here suggested that the rich and varied subject 

matter resources of French culture and language, adapted to modern

viewpoints, could scarcely fail to provide an excellent medium for 

capitalizing the HFB studentb abilities, interests and energy and 

integrating them into a distinctive life-pattern maximally expressive 

of the values of our civilization^ Furthermore,perusal of classic 
Z 

studies most often cited in attesting the futility of foreign lang¬ 
uage courses for high school students suggests that these surveys 
were based substantially on practices and objectives now outdated. 

In any case, it is indefensible to conclude that because,under ad¬ 
mittedly unsatisfactory conditions and with admittedly inadequate 
evaluative techniques, certain outcomes have not been proven to 
obtain they should be regarded as illusory and discarded as educat¬ 
ional aims. 

C anada 1 s Bilingualism 

The national situation, as it bears upon our problem, is 
extremely complex, and opinions may be expected to vary widely as to 
the relative significance of different factors and desirable courses 
of action. Perhaps- mainly becaude of such difficulties, the implic¬ 
ations of Canada* s dual culture for language teaching in Alberta 
has received scant attention* It therefore seems in order not only 
to study the effects of the Canadian situation upon the French-Lang¬ 
uage problems of both FB and iTFB groups in Alberta, but also to viev^ 
the problem as a reversible reaction and estimate the probable value 
bf improved programs of French instruction in promoting Canadian 
unity, cultural evolution and general progress. 

The rift, extending far back into history, between French- 
speaking and English-speaking Canadians is assuredly one of Canada*s 
most perplexing problems. The intensity and all-pervasive nature 

of the survival motive or nationalisme in French Canada makes it an

the subject. Bibliography 9.See also quotation,page 5,from A.B.Currie

inescapable and potent factor in all problems of language,culture 
and education of the FB group, Among positive accomplishments of 
of the struggle are: retention of the French tongie in Canada and 
of a rich literature and culture;purification of the language; 
preservation of distinctive cultural values and a way of life; a 
strong awareness among French-speaking Canadians of their cultural 
identity and tradition.While Canada’s English-speaking Canadians 
are more heterogeneous culturally, they have perhaps shown less 
understanding of their great co-culture than have the French- 
speaking compatriots. In view of these divergent backgrounds} HFB 
and FB students in Alberta may be expected to reflect them in some 
measure and differ correspondingly in attainments, outlook and needa 
Further, a legitimate goal of language training in both groups 
would seem to be the promotion of mutual understanding, appreciation 
and good will both in Alberta and in Canada as a whole. While doubt¬ 
less such fragmentary acquisitions as reading literacy in French 
would have much value to NFB students, an all-round facility in the 
language should not only yield personal satisfaction and enrichment 
but should also provide a priceless aid in the social engineering 
suggested above. 

In support of this view may be cited the unequivocal words 
B 

of Dr. A.B.Currie who writes: 

"In a bilingual community such as the Canadian nation the 
responsibility of English-speaking citizens to learn Frenah is so 
obvious as scarcely to need argument to support it. The very fact 
that roughly one third of our fellow citizens use the French lang¬ 
uage as their medium of communication and their repository of culture 
places on a substantial number of the other two-thirds the duty of 
gaining a practical familiarity with, if not a scholarly knowledge 
of, that language. In fact there is no better way to learn the char¬ 
acteristic way of life and habits of thought of French-speaking 
Canadians than learning their language. - - -a?.study of it is bound 
to yield - - - a deeper understanding of our whole civilization."

The Alberta Picture 


Research studies in the field appear to be almost non¬ 
existent. The M.A.thesis of Mr. B. E. Walker throws considerable 
light on the attainment of certain objectives in certain scnools 
in the province of Alberta but makes no separation of the two 
groups herein compared. There is, however, a comparison 01 high 
school students who have taken grade IX oral French with those 
who have not. The results may be regarded as applying preponderantly 
to the HFB group# It is concluded that "evidently the training in 
oral French in grade IX had no significant advantage in reading and 
writing accomplishment” 1 Yet the oral French group was found defin¬ 
itely superior in oral and aural skills, at was suggested that 
"some form of standardized audition test might profitably be used 


along with the traditional type of reading and writing test to get 


a more complete picture of the studentfe progress in the acquisition 
of a foreign languageHis results also led to the interesting 
suggestion that students of lower intelligence may get a highly 
usable surrender value, and confirmed the value of the understanding- 
and€speaking to reading-and-writing sequence. Mr. Walker held that 
"reading should be the primary objective in French classes towards 
which all exercises,grammatical,oral,etc. should converge 1 and 
that ”we must drive toward a definite objective if we hope to get 


definite results.”

tlie short period of the learner’s life usually devoted to learn¬ 
ing French, teachers’ lack of proficiency in speaking the language 
and the general linguistic isolation, and concluded "it might not 

be so cheering to find out the achievement of all French students, 

1 1 

rural and urban, in our Province,and "if the Canadian and 

American Committees were dissatisfied with the results they found, 

surely we in Alberta should also be dissatisfied with the results 

of French instruction in our Province generally."' 

Mr. JT. L. Gibault’s Thesis’^ refers to the "many problems 

7 

in the field of French-English education" and states that 
"although the teaching of French has been carried on for years in 
many schools of Western Canada, and particularly in Alberta, there 
has never been, to my knowledge, any publisned study in this field 
of education," ' Mis study does separate English- and French- 
speaking pupils, but needs with French only in the elementary 
grades in a few schools in the St. Paul Inspectorate* He found 
that English-speaking children score about Tk higher in English 
tes s than French children in the same schools, but that this 
difference is lass in Grade Till than in Grade IY. It also 
appeared that learning a second language in the primary grades 
did not appreciably affect achievement in the primary languages 
this held true for both groups.

The following bit of evidence suggests a decline of interest 
or a sense of failure, or both,with each successive year of high 
school French# As NFR students make up almost 95% of the _ population 
used, the ensuing figures will apply mainly to the NFS group. The 
Annual Reports of the Department of Education show,that in 1941 the 
enrolment in French 1 was approximately 45% of the total grade X 
population; in 1942 the French 2 enrolment was roughly 25% of the 
total grade XI strength; in 1943 the French 3 registration was only 
slightly over 15% of the total enrolment in grade XII. Since French 
1 and 2 are not always taken in grades X and XI respectively, several 
similar calculations were made, all of which confirmed these pro¬ 
portions fairly closely. These figures provide, of course, no hint 
as to the corresponding FB situation. 

Regarding obstacles to success, the 1945 Report of the Alberta 
Teachers’ Association Curriculum Revision Committee reports agreement 
among representatives of the Department of Education, the University 
Faculty of Education, the Alberta Association of Teachers of French 
and school inspectors,both Frenoh- and English-speaking, that 1. a 
clarification of aims is needed, 2. an advanced course with more 
cultural material would better fit the needs of FB students, and 3. 
teacher training was "the bottleneck which blocks progress in the 
teaching of French in Alberta.” Again, there is no evidence that the 
first and third of these conclusions apply to group FB. 

The 1940 Alberta Programme of Studies for the High School,in 
effect,throughout the period covered by this study, avoided any 
final statement of aims but suggested speaking and reading as features 
worthy of emphasis depending upon pupil’s abilities,attitudes, person¬ 
al qualities and plans. "Pending the final solution of this problem," 
the intention to weight reading rather heavily in final examinations 
was announced. It is apparent that such an elastic program would

by the necessity of preparing for a common grade

CHAPTER III 


FROCSI'Upr IN FATHERING- DATA 

Collection of data from examinations. 

The first step in this study was a special compilation, 
made by the Supervisor of Examinations and Ms staff, of the 
following data * or each of the twelve hundred students writing 
final examinations in french 3 1 b July, 1944: full name, age, sex, 
school attended, Grade IX category (A, B. € or D), mark in Grade 
IX general test, and marks in all Grade XII final examinations 
written in July, 1944# 


The first ^uestioimaire 

Fran the lists obtained, all names were selected, by 
scrutiny of -family and given names and the school attended, which 
bore any suggestion of French descent or residence in a French 
district. These names were then listed, by schools, on forms 
(Appendix 1} designed to ascertain the general extent of any 
French language background which night be enjoyed' and were then 
mailed to the principals concerned. While it was not expected 
that all freath-spcaking students would be identified in this 
manner, it was hoped that the number missed would be small and 
that the gem Iity of performance would b*cu .e evident. 

These questionnaires were, with the excaption of on© school 
and involving only one pupil, carefully filled out and returned; 
in many oases supplementary Information was volunteered. Analysis 
of these returns revealed seventy students with some French back¬ 
ground, defined as including at least the ability to converse

-12- 


freely in French and either a French-speaking or bilingual home 
including French. On the twenty-five questionnaire returned, 
thirty-six non-French students were also found. As a rough check 
of the validity of the classification of these students, their 
average marks were found to b© as follows: 

F rench 3 English 3 

French-speaking group 76*2% 51.0% 

Non-French-speaking group 49.5 56.5 

The distribution by categories of the former group was 35 H f s, 

21 A’s, 12 B*s, 0 C s s and 2 D’s. However, it happens that the 
author is able to state from personal acquaintance with the two 
pupils obtaining D that very little French is spoken in their 
homes. These results strongly confirmed suspicions that the 
French-speaking students were obtaining an undue percentage of 
the high marks and that the inclusion in the total distribution 
of an atypical group showing such marked positive skewness might 
seriously distort the distribution of marks of non-French students 
to th© latter f s disadvantage. 

In an effort to preclude possible charges that the findings 
were based on only a fragmentary sampling of basic data, it was 
decided to circularise every school in the Province at which French 
3 had been offered in 1943-4. The excellent response to the 
previous questionnaire held forth the hope that virtually complete 
Information might be forthcoming. 

Second ^uestioruaaire 

Since the second circular had to be sent to a much larger 
number of schools than the first, there were included in it not 
only the names of all students who wrote French 3 in July, 1944>

but also several other items. There were blanks to be filled in 
showing the number and percentage of high school students currently 
attending who possess a French background. Finally, there was a 
list of items to be checked which it was thought might provide 
supplementary data of value in completing the provincial picture 
and interpreting results of the analysis of examination answer 
papers. (Appendix II). An effort was made to reduce to a minimum 
the demands upon the time and energy of the respondents. Tvra 
possible difficulties may be noted: first, because of the lapse of 
more than a year, few or none of the students concerned would 
still be in attendance and, especially if French teachers had 
changed schools in the interval, it ight be difficult or imposs¬ 
ible to be certain which students ? names should be checked; second, 
the wording of the questionnaire was somewhat subjective inasmuch 
as it placed upon the teacher answering the task of deciding what 
constituted an appreciable background in French. There should, 
however, be no constant error. 

Responses to this second questionnaire were less nearly 
complete than those to the first one, 83 out of 125 schools being 
heard from. In all, eleven additional French-background students 
were identified, five of these being qualified by such marginal 
comments as "speaks only a little French** or "has not spoken French 
for some years." The marks of these students ware distributed 
thus, 1 H, 5 A* 5 , 1 B and 4 0*3. Since the proportion of large 
schools responding was fully as high as that of smaller schools, 
and sines these marks were not conspicuously superior to those of 
non-French groups, the probability of serious error due to in¬ 
completeness of results appears to be small, unless, of course, 
one or more schools with rather large enrolments of French-speaking

students failed to respond. A safe assumption is probably that 
the percentage of French-Speaking pupils in the 4£ schools not 
heard from would prove about the same as in the other 83 schools. 
Later estimates of total FB numerical strength will be based on 
this assumption. Recommended students from Western Canada and 
University high schools were not included in this or any other 
part of the study. 

T he ffiiird Questionnair e 

The second and third questionnaires (Appendix III) were 
identical except that in the latter pupils 1 names were not included 
because the information sought regarding their language status was 
already at hand,and the covering letter was correspondingly abbrev¬ 
iated. The third questionnaire was sent to a small number of school^ 
including a few in which French 3 had not been written in 1944, 
where FB students were expected to be in the majority. This was done 
to obtain as many as possible of the FB- schools in order to attain 
maximum reliabilty. The total of ten schools reporting more than 
50^ of their students as of the FB group(or definitely stating that 
the items Checked referred to FB students) is still rather low for 
reliable comparison.

CHAPTER IV 


COMPARISON BASED ON EXAMINATIONS 
The present chapter will be devoted entirely to an analysis 
and comparison of the marks supplied by the Examinations Branch. Firsb 
the distributions of FB and NFB marks in French 3 will be compared. 

In order to take out the FB marks from the original mixed distribution 
and make corresponding adjustments in the remaining NFB marks it was 
found necessary to make a number of rather Involved computations set 
forth someYiiat compactly in Tables I and II. Secondly, the marks 
supplied also permit seme supplementary comparisons based on grade IX 
category (Table III),grade IX general test,Grade IX oral French,grade 
XII English, and other grade XII subjects averaged(Table IV) 

Comparison of FB and NFB marks in 
French 3 with transmutation of NFB marks 

In Table I the term total population will mean 1163,the total 
number of papers, both FB and NFB, used in the study.(Rows 7 and 8) 
Wherever the word strength appears it will mean numerical strength or 
the number of cases. The term deficiency will denote the number by 
which the actual number of NFB papers in a given category( e.g. A 
which covers all marks from 65 to 79 inclusive) falls short of the 
theoretically corrected number,that is, the ngtmber which would have 
obtained had the NFB group constituted the total population. In row 
8 the estimated number of NFB students shown in each column is obtain¬ 
ed by subtracting the estimated number of FB students (row 4$ from 
the total population (row 6) in the same column; this procedure also 
serves as a check on the total strength of the NFB group, viz.,1075. 
The next step after thus separating the two distributions is to redis¬ 
tribute NFB marks maintaining the same proportions, by categories

or letter ratings, as was assigned to the total population; this 
distribution pattern is shown by the percentages in Row 7. By mult¬ 
iplying each percentage in Row 7 by 1075 the corrected distribution 
of NFB marks, shown in Row 9, is obtained. Row 10 shows the number of 
papers which would have to added to each number in Row 8,the estim¬ 
ated actual incidence of NFB papers,of a given category, to bring it 
to full strength according to the corrected distribution. Finally, 
these deficiencie s (Row 10) are cumulatively totalled to show now 
many marks would have to be raised into each category.

It is therefore estimated that to maintain for group NFB 
the same relative distribution of marks as was assigned to the 
total population it would he necessary to transfer 52 students 
from A to H ratings, 48 from B to A, 28 from 0 to B,and 12 from D 
to C. On this particular paper neither the highest mark,100, nor 
the lowest mark, 0,would he affected, for the latter was made hy 
an NFB student and the former hy both a French-speaking adult and 
a non-French-background (Chinese) student. However it is probable 
that on other papers the highest 3TB mark might exceed the highest 
NFB mark by a considerable margin,especially in view of the small 
number of cases at the extreme tips of the distribution, and cause 
a consequent displacement of the 100 fo mark. 

Examination of Table I reveals a very striking disconformity 
between the two populations under study. While the NFB distribution 
is approximately normal ’with its mode in the lower part of B categ¬ 
ory, the FB distribution is markedly atypical, showing very pron¬ 
ounced positive skewness.and having its mode in the H category. It 
is apparent,too, that half of all H®s earned went to FB students 
who constitute only 7 or 8 per cent of the total population. It may 
also be remarked that nearly half of the FB students received H 
ratings and 75 per cent got either A or H ratings. The FB handicap 
or deprivation will tend to be highest in the higher categories. 

To determine this deprivation at a few critical points and 
thus indicate its general pattern Table II is given. Interpolatidnri 
on the NFB frequency distribution table(not reproduced here because 
only the ranges immediately 80, 65, 50, and 40 were used) shows that 
marks corrected according to the preceding plan would read as in 
Table II.It should be noted that the fractional marks listed in the 
second column as Mark Assigned were determined by counting marks

down from each critical point shown in the first column. To obtain 
frequencies equal to the exact deficiencies shown in Table I, Row 10, 
it was necessary to interpolate between successive integers. Actually, 
of course, no fractional marks were assigned. Therefore the nearest 
whole number is placed in brackets to the right of eacn fracoional 
number in column two. A similar explanation applies to the displace- 
ments or deprivations shown in the third column.

1 and 2. These marks would, for practical reasons, be recorded as 

47 and 57 respectively. 


Table II then reveals that an NEB student who actually received 

a French 3 mark of 74 on the examination in question would, according 

to the foregoing correction scheme, have received a mark of 80. Thus 
his mark suffered a downward displacement or deprivation of 6 points 
as a result of the inclusion in the total population of the superior 
EB group. It is also evident that for students with lower marks the 


deprivation was smaller. Except at higher ranges, where this depriv¬ 
ation is greatest and might result in the loss of scholarships, and 
at critical points such as 40 and 50 where it may mean failure to 
pass or matriculate, the displacement does not seem serious.

and NFB populations a few further comparisons based on the data 
supplied by the Examinations Branch were made. Table III shows the 
percentage distributions of grade IX categories for the two groups 
of students. It should, of course, be remembered that this comparison 
does not refer to all the French-speaking and English speaking pupils 
who wrote grade IX in any particular year, but merely to those who 
wrote French 3 in July 1944.

Table III clearly indicates that group FB: were rather alarm¬ 
ingly inferior to group NFB in general quality of performance on the 
grade IX examinations. For example, although slightly over three 
quarters of the NFB students had been able to attain the highest 
category (A),less than half of the FB group were equally successful. 

Table IT shows comparisons of the two groups on the bases of 
grade IX General Test, grade IX oral French,English 3 and the average 
of all other grade XII Departmental examinations written in July,1944. 
In estimating the reliability of these figures the number of cases 
sampled, should be noted;where this number, n, is not given, all cases 
were taken,viz.,81 FB * s and 1082 NFB f s.

It should he observed that ratings in oral French were assigned, 
by teachers in charge. It might accordingly be expected that in 
classes composed mainly of FB students marks would be lower than for 
the same level of work in non-French classes, improvement during the 
year being quite properly an important determinant of marks. It is 
therefore possible that the actual FB superiority may be considerably 
greater than the table indicates.The HFB superiority on the other 
four criteria(Tables III and IY) is rather striking, particularly 
in the General Test which is presumably to be ragarded as an index 
of scholastic aptitude. While no approach to final diagnosis of the 
reasons for these disparities can be made here, possible causative 
factors which suggest themselves are: atypical backgrounds of 
experience in the FB group, an English handicap shorn in Table IY, 
column three,different teaching methods with perhaps less stimulation 
to independent reasoning, the small number of cases studied, defects 
in the tests which might stress the abilities typical of the NFB 
students. Whatever -the causes, these consistent and large disparities 
merit concern and further investigation. In view of the direct func¬ 
tional emphasis of the French 3 paper in question it is not thought 
that the FB students would be appreciably hindered in French by the 
English handicap.

CHAPTER IV 


TEACHERS 1 OPINIONS COMPARED 


The present chapter will be devoted to a comparison of 
teachers T opinions as recorded on the second and third question- 
aires (Appendices II and III) While the statistical validity of 
this chapter is thought inferior to that of the other chapters, 
the following comparison of teachers* opinions is inserted mainly 
for whatever (qualitative value it may have in furnishing clues for 
interpretive conclusions. The three bases of comparison are: ob¬ 
stacles to success in the teaching of French, objectives thought 
to be attainable as well as those thought actually attained, and 
realia, or instructional aids used to make learning more concrete 
and vital. 


Certain precautions should be taken in forming conclusions 
on the basis of these comparisons. The lists of phrases(4a, 4b, 4c, 
Appendix II) from which teachers were asked to select items should 
be examined for possible suggestive power due to either the wording 
or the sequence. Although only a few teachers made deletions, 
additions or qualifying marginal comments, many others may have 
found their views only imperfectly expressed by the items which 
they checked or underlined. Since schools were counted as FB if 
more than 50 per cent of their students were reported to be FB, 
and as NFS if a majority were NFS, it is clear that the division 
oi schools into two groups is not clear-cut and free from overlapping

Further, list 4b caused some difficulty inasmuch as a fairly large 
number of respondents neglected either to check or to underline, 
and in some cases there was room for doubt as to which had been 
intended; apparently it was unwise to ask for two concurrent res¬ 
ponses to the same list. Whenever there was no evidence of the 
marker’s intention, reoults were excluded from, the study, This 
happened often enough in the ease of objectives thought attained 
to make the probable error fairly high. Moreover, it is obvious 
that the mere totalling of items marked could not show correlations 
between items or reveal any typical patterns. An effort was made 
to include the major items found in the relevant literature and 
to jumble these so ns to avoid suggestive sequences. In each list, 
one or more items seldom or never given prominence in the literature 
were also inserted as jokers to check validity. Opinions were asked 
cn three aspects of the situation in Alberta, objectives (4b), 
obstacles (4a) and realia used (4c). Obstacles were listed first 
to obtain an offhand opinion and lesson the probability that the 
teacher would try, in the interests of consistency, to harmonize 
the obstacles with the objectives. 


Objectives 

In Table ¥, checking indicate® objectives thought attaina¬ 
ble without the sacrifice of more worthwhile educational experiences, 
under such favorable conditions as could reasonably be expected to 
follow a systematic and thorough attempt by those in authority to 
remove the obstacles checked. Underlining denotes belief that the 
objectives are actually being attained in the respondent’s classes.

This Table shows that the average number of objectives 
thought attainable is roughly the same for both groups, although 
the NFB group exhibits greater dispersion. This suggest! that the 
FB group is more uniform and definite in its objectives. 

Objectives most frequently thought attainable by the FB group 
were: speaking French (90$), understanding spoken French (70$), more 
tolerant, broad-minded attitudes (70%), reading for enjoyment (60%), 
thinking in French (60%), greater interest in French-Canadians (60%), 
reading for information (50$), better social personality ( 40 %), and 
greater versatility of interests ( 40 $). 

Objectives most frequently thought attainable by the NFB 
group were: understanding spoken French (69$), improved understanding 
of English (65%), speaking French (53$), reading for enjoyment (49$), 
reading for information (43%), greater interest in life, thought and 
outlook of French-Canadians (43$), increased ability to learn other 
languages (3$%)» improved use of English (36$), and more tolerant, 
broad-minded attitudes (36$). 

Objectives most frequently thought attained by the FB group 
were: reading for enjoyment (30$), understanding spoken French (30$), 
reading for information (20%j., speaking French (20$), greater inter¬ 
est in French-Canadians (20$), and more tolerant, broadminded atti¬ 
tudes (20%). 

Objectives most frequently thought attained by the NFB group 
were: understending spoken French (24$), improved understanding of 
English (20$), speaking French (19$), and reading for enjoyment (16%). 

Although it must be remembered that these figures represent 
opinions arid not necessarily facts, that there was much overlapping 
of the groups (for example, a school in one group might contain as

high as 49% of the other group), and that some oversights in 
marking due, perhaps, in part to modesty, were obvious, yet the 
disparity between the attainability and attainment is great for 
both groups. The best estimate of efficiency that can be computed 
from these data is, then. Index of Efficiency =

Average percentage thought attainable. For the FB group this is 
found to be appr >ximateiy 31% and for the NFB group 25%. 

Obstacles 

In Table VI, checking betokens that the item is felt to be 
an obstacle to the achievement of desirable objectives, whereas 
underlining means that it is considered the most serious obstacle. 
Reference to the instructions for marking will show that the divi¬ 
sion of the answers into two groups implies the assumption that 
teachers will be most familiar with schools of the type in which 
they teach. Generally, limitations mentioned in connection with 
objectives may be held to obtain here.

The list of obstacles elicited more comments than any other 


part of the questionnaire. Some teachers, particularly in the NFB 
group, showed considerable heat, as quotations will show* 

Comments of the FB group bore principally upon the first, 
eighth and thirteenth obstacles. It is believed that all relevant 
quotations are included except where more than, one quotation embodied 
essentially the same idea. 0 os bade 1: W I think that different 


courses should be set up for students in the two groups - especially

when the French paper is considered. I should like to see on a 
new French 3 course french Literature. Students may make 100$ in 
French 3 and still have no knowledge of French writers. Obstacle 
"So far, we need qualified sisters from Quebec to teach our 
French classes. Too little French is being offered to our primary 
pupils." Obstacle 13 (presumably): "We have teachers whose 
native language is French teaching French 1,2 and 3. In spite of 
this ourp upils who are English-speaking have great difficulty with 
the present set-up and do not learn French to any appreciable degree. 
General: "The teaching of French is not a great difficulty in our 
school except for the pupils coming in from outside the district." 

More comments from the NFB teachers were to be expected in 
view of much larger population. Again, when several statements 
embody much the same thought, only one or two of the most typical 
are quoted here; the number of similar comments will be Indicated 
in brackets if there are more than one. Obstacle 1: "The combina¬ 
tion of English grammar and of the French language is somewhat too 

(3) 

difficult for most B students. - - If only we could teach French 
without mention of grammar, how much easier for all concerned." 

(This, of course, also bears upon obstacles 18 and 19 )* Obstacle 
2: "The grade nine course was originally intended only for schools 
with French-speaking teachers and was not meant as a preparation 
for high school courses." (2). Obstacle 3: "The grade X and XI 
text is unsuitable (4). Ob stacle 4: "The chief troubles stem from 
the huge classes, In many schools (3).” Obstacle 5: "The diver¬ 
gence between the high school course as -set out In the Course of 
Studies and the aims to be inferred from the present Grade XII 
examinations Is very great." "Frankly, the teaching of French in

Alberta is a joke* Most students take it only because they vague¬ 
ly hope to enter university where it is supposed to help one to 
learn surveying or operate on dead corpses Obstacle 7: "More 
simple and interesting reading material is needed if there is to 
be enjoyment by more than a few of the best students." Obstacle 8; 

"I had taught French 1, 2 and 3 - for ten years. I blush to 

admit it. - - Despite my own study of French in high school and 
University I feel that I do not speak French in the true sense of 
the word. I feel very strongly that French cannot be taught by 
people who do not speak French fluently. The best texts and 
curriculum in the world will not make up for this la£k. (3) w "I 
question whether French should be on the program when there is no 
teacher who has conversational ability that would permit him to 
converse with a native. Why not regard French as a technical 
subject which could be taken by those interested in centres poss¬ 
essing teachers of adequate training?” Obstacle 10; "The teach¬ 
ing of French will always follow the pattern set by the Departmental 
examinations.” (2) "The range of vocabulary and the wide general 
knowledge of French on the 1945 paper was impossible for the aver¬ 
age student with his limited background.” See, also, the first 
comment regarding Obstacle 5. n I feel that our Englishrspeaking 
students of French 3 (this is the group I teach) are handicapped 
on the final examination because they write the same examination 
as the French-speaking students. This means that their results 
appear inferior, though for English-speaking ones they may be very 
fine results. I feel that it would be an excellent thing if wa 
could persuade the Department of Education to accept, for French- 
speaking students, the examination prepared by the French-Canadian

Association, Grade XII, which is much more up to their grade of 
knowledge* The Grade XII examination of French 3 is too easy 
for them, hence our English-speaking ones seem to know so little 
when the final results are graphed*" Obstacle 11; "My opinion 
is that French should be taught from Grade 7 on in order that 
high school graduates may have a reasonable command of French* 

In a bilingual country,education should aim at this objective."(2). 
Obstacle 15: "Classes must be given vitality." (2) Obstacle 17: 
"Those who are attempting to improve the French in the West should 
make certain that no suspicions of illegitimate reasons be fom¬ 
ented." One teacher struck out the "or antagonistic" and checked. 
Obstacle IS; "Only a highly selected group of pupils can cover 
in three years a Matriculation course worthy of the name. (4). 

One more year of daily instruction is needed." (This also bears 
on obstacle 11). 4 Bee, also, comment regarding Obstacle 1). 

Obstacle 26: "Oral-aural work is the basis for progress in the 
spoken language, but it must be combined (with pupils of senior 
high school age) with reading and writing to obtain quick and 
lasting results." Two obstacles not focalized in the thirty 
items listed were also mentioned. The first was linguistic 
isolation in Alberta: "It seems to me that in a province like 
Alberta where the population is only 3.4 % French by racial 
origin, the opportunities for speaking French are limited in the 
extreme, and for this reason the effort involved in teaching 
children to speak it is not justified. If, however, the pressure 
for this continues, why not have the language taught by teachers 
who come from Quebec on exchange? The advantages of such a plan 
are obvious, and, as well, such an arrangement would help to 
foster better relations between the Anglo-French parts of this

country.” "There is a lack of post-school application of a 
knowledge of French.” (3)* The second obstacle suggested was 
teaching the "wrong" kind of French. "How about including a few 
mild oaths? - - - The language fails the student just when he 
needs it most. Too much emphasis in our courses is given to 
France. Let’s concentrate on French Canada and the speech of 
educated French-Canadians. There is no more reason to speak 
French as it is spoken in France than there is to speak English 
as it is spoken in England or in the /mierican South." General: 

"I an delighted to learn that someone has undertaken to study 
this urgent French problem in our schools." (5). "You are assuming 
that French is necessary and worthwhile in our curriculum. I 
believe this to be positively wrong. What we need - - - is that 
our mother tongue be well taught; besides, all schools everywhere 
should teach one universal language." 

Examination of the above Table reveals that FB teachers 
were somewhat less conscious of difficulties than those of the 
NFB group. Obstacles most frequently checked by the FB group 
were: Beginning French too late in the learner’s life ( 60 %), 
pupils not convinced of the value of French (50^), paucity of 
suitable reading material (40%), inadequate teacher training 
(40$), indifferent or antagonistic attitudes in home or community 
( 40 %), and insufficient time allotment to French ( 40 %). Obstacles 
most frequently checked by the NFB teachers were: Students’ poor 
foundation in English grammar (81%), inadequate teacher training 
(65%), beginning French too lat© in the learner’s life (61%), 
neglect or aural-oral work (56%), pupils not convinced of the 
value of learning French (54%)> paucity of suitable reading 
material (43%t, uncertainty or confusion as to objectives (43%).

The facts that no obstacle was underlined by more than 
one (out of ten) FB teacher and that six different obstacles 
were underlined, whereas 24 % of the teachers underlined inade¬ 
quate teacher training, 15% beginning French too late in the 
learner’s life, 11% uncertainty or confusion as to objectives 
(eleven items being underlined altogether) again suggests that 
the latter group is more keenly aware of obstacles* This is 
also confirmed by the comments volunteered.

Realia 

Although not thought so fundamental as either objectives 
or obstacles, realia were also listed on the third and fourth 
questionnaires, as they seem to provide a more concrete and 
objective basis of comparing the two groups. Items used wore to 
be checked. There is, however, no differentiation between 
occasional and incidental use, on the one hand, and regular use 
well integrated with classroom ’work, on the other. Table VII 
shows the results of this comparison.

NFS Comments on Realia : Mechanical aids are costly and 
difficult to get.(2). There is not time for realia.(4). The French 
broadcasts are good. We are unable to get these broadcasts in this 
part of the province.(The FB group made no comments) 

Table VII reveals that, on every Item, the FB classes made 
more general use of realia than the HFB classes. The ratio in 
column three shows, for example, that twenty times as many FB 
classes used silent films in French as did HFB classes; this ratio 
ranges from 20 down to 1.1 for item 11, French papers and magazines. 
Finally, the average use of realia by FB classes was three times 
as great as for HFB classes.

CHAPTER VI 


COMPARISON OF ACHIEVEMENT AND ERRORS 

Of major concern in this study is a comparison of the 
performances on the Departmental examination,July, 1944, of the 
two groups of students under investigation. The sixth chapter 
will supplement the quantitative comparison of gross and average 
scores undertaken on chapter IV with a more detailed, question by 
question, comparison as well as a classified comparison of errors. 
These two analytical comparisons are attempts to discover more 
precisely the nature and extent of the large FB-NFB disparity 
already found to obtain. 

Such a comparison,clearly both quantitative and qualitative, 
seems desirable for several reasons. First,the total marks are 
obviously to some extent functions of the particular paper;the 
question by question treatment should shed light on the nature of 
any such dependence on the type of paper. Indeed, it Is by no 
means improbable that, by heavy weighting of weaknesses found 
peculiar to the superior group, Its Margin of superiority over . 
the NFB group might be greatly reduced; there is, however, no 
implication that such a paper would be fair or consistent with 
the proper purposes of an examination. Secondly,these analytical 
comparisons should provide data valuable in improving the sensit¬ 
ivity of test items for both groups. Finally,the strength,weak¬ 
nesses, and instructional needs of the two groups of students 
should become more apparent.

French 3 scores compared question by question 
Table VIII will need little explanation. Columns eight and 
nine show the FB-MFB disparity as a percentage difference(obtained 
by subtraction of the fourth and sixth columns) and as a ratio 
respectively. The Index of Difficulty for the FB group is Frequency 
for NFB group divided by Frequency for FB group. It should be observed, 
that this index decreases in validity as the FB score becomes smaller, 
and would become meaningless in case of an FB score of zero, Fortun¬ 
ately, only one item, 11b, is known by less than 10 per cent of the 
FB students. The number of papers analysed was 120, 60 for each grcup.

In certain questions, notably number 6, the FB group 
offered a variety of words,a number of which, although marked 
wrong, seem by comparison with dictionary definitions to be 
acceptable. For example, proche was repeatedly rejected as an 
opposite of loin; la hrievete for la longeur ; insoucieixx and 
insouciant for inquiet ; la frayeur for la crainte (synonym); 
l 1 atelier as a synonym for la boutique ; in question 2, affeo- 
tionne is rejected as an adjective of the same family as 
1*affection. 

It is apparent that on practically every type of question 
the FB students enjoy a very substantial advantage over their HFB 
fellows; this is to be expected and may be taken as evidence of 
the validity and high sensitivity of the examination paper. A 
few points of some FB weakness are: pronoun objects (in question 1), 
questions based upon the required reading (question 13a, 13d and IB), 
French-English translation, a few idioms stressed in the prescribed 
reading (e*g. 11c, llg). The FB superiority was conspicuous in 
most questions dealing with vocabulary; this superiority becomes 
more apparent when one examines answers for expressiveness and 
variety. In questions based on knowledge of France,, the FB super¬ 
iority was quite well maintained, It might be expected that a 
paper couched in grammatical terms and requiring rather precise 
grammatical discrimination would place the FB group at a relative 
disadvantage, but this paper, with its functional emphasis, throws 
little light on the problem. In a number of questions, very low 
indices of difficulty for the FB group may be due to the virtual 
impossibility of the questions for W% students. Conspicuous 
examples of this are 6d, 6j, 10a, IQd, 15c, 15d, 17c and 17f.

Classified Comparison of Errors 
In the preceding comparison of scores there is, except for 
the very short answers, little indication of the exact nature of 
errors made —marks being deducted for a H-reat variety of reasons* 
Table IX presents a classified and more detailed comparison of the 
errors of the two groups of students under study. Sixty-three EB 
papers and one hundred NEB papers were analysed. To obtain the 
figures shown under "No* of errors per 100 papers",EB, the original 
numbers were, accordingly, multiplied by 1.6. Tne average superior¬ 
ity per paper is obtained by dividing by 100 the difierence between 
columns two and three. The Index of Difficulty for tne EB group is 
the number of EB errors per 100 papers divided by the number of NEB 
errors per 100 papers* The reliabilty of this index will, oi course, 
vary widely with the sixe of the denominator* It should be obsex/ed 
too that only-the answers to the first ten and the twelfoh questions 
were checked for errors, others being omitted either because they 
were not answered in French or because there was great variety in 
the form, length or content of the answers. Of the questions not 
studied, numbers 14,16,1? and 18 were based on reading,number 13 
on vocabulary recognition, and number 15 on general knowledge. In 
a few cases the totals shown differ slightly from those obtained by 
addition of the columns in question;this fact arises from the 
number of decimal places to which figures were corrected.In case of 
such discrepancy the totals shown, being computed from the original

Examination of fable IX reveals: 

1. The NEB students made, on the average, more than twice 
as many errors on the questions analyzed as did the EB students. 

£. NEB students averaged about 48 more errors per paper on 
the questions analyzed than did FB students, the former making 86.64 
errors per paper and the latter 38.9? errors per paper. 

3. Verbs account for about 38 per cent, of the NEB errors 
and about 43 per cent, of the FB errors. However, the dependence of 
these figures upon the particular paper should be borne in mind. 

4. For nouns, second in frequency of errors, the corres-

ponding figures are approximately 18 % and 16 %. 

5. Third in frequency for both groups are adjectives, 

NFS 16 % and FB 13%. 

6 . Pronouns are next for Group f 8 , 9%, whereas for 
Group NFS prepositions take fourth place with 14%. The percentages 
for other parts of speech may be readily computed from the totals 
and sub-totals in Table IX. 

7. On every part of speech the FB students enjoyed a 
strong advantage, the order of increasing relative FB difficulty 
being: prepositions, index of difficulty for FB ? s .29; adjectives 
.36; nouns .39; conjunctions .50; verbs .51; pronouns * 56 ; and 
adverbs .68. Elision errors were very rare with FB students, index 
of difficulty *18. Hyphenation, on the other hand, proved muGh 
more difficult for FB students 5 index of difficulty 2.08. For 
both hyphenation and elision, the small number of errors in either 
group reduces the reliability of these indices. 

8 . Of the sub-headings under each part of speech, the 

only one shew ng a general NFB advantage is spelling. atever 

the reason, the indices of difficulty obtained are, verbs 1 . 2 ?, 
nouns 1.19, pronouns 1.13, adverbs 1 * 05 , adjectives .96 and 
prepositions 0 . 00 . 

9. The relative difficulty of accents appears to fluctuate 
widely among different parts of speech. Adverbs 7.14 (only 2 cases

CHAPTER VII 


CONCLUSIONS AND PROBLEMS RAISED 

Evaluation of Conclusions Reached 

Because different sections of this report are believed 
to vary considerably in validity, reliability and general object¬ 
ivity, it has seemed best to state findings under the appropriate 
headings and to point out there the main limitations arising from 
the nature of procedure or incompleteness of data. In general, the 
tables, with accompanying textual material, summarize the central 
findings of the study. Accordingly, no useful purpose would seem 
to be served by recapitulating these results here, except where 
interrelationships among the different sets of results may thus be 
made more apparent. It is also thought that, because of the nature 
of the comparisons, close descriptive adherence to the basic data 
is preferable to more elaborate statistical procedures in appraising 
the probable validity and reliability of results. 

A few major assumptions may be summarized at this point. 
First, the French 3 examination paper used was assumed to be a 
valid instrument for assessing achievement in French; no attempt 
was made to analyse this paper for fidelity to any particular set 
of objectives or for general reliability. However, the soundness 
of the paper as a whole is attested by the general consistency with 
which its component Items separate FB and NFS students as well as 
by the dispersion of raw scores before transmutation to the so- 
called percentages received by the students.(This may also be 
Interpreted as indicating a poor quality of scholarship among NFB 
students.) A further limitation of the test paper, in view of 
currently popular objectives,

ives, is the lack of any test of aural-oral attainments. Comments 
of French teachers reg rding obstacle 10 also suggest discontinuity 
between some teaching practices and the examination paper. A second 
assumption was that the distribution of FB students among the 
schools unheard from on the second questionnaire was similar to 
that among the schools reporting. A third assumption was that 
teachers of French who responded were aware of the general extent 
of any French-language backgrounds among their students. A fourth 
assumption was that an appreciable French-background would, witik. 
the aid of exxdLanations in the circular letter accompanying th© 
questionnaires, mean approximately th© same thing to different 
teachers. If these assumptions are justified for the population 
under study, then, because of close adherence to original data, 
all conclusions based on examination papers should be highly valid 
and highly reliable. This is believed to apply to the results 
summarized in Tables I, II, III, I?, ¥111 and IX. Tables Y, VI 
and VII, being based upon expressions of opinion on matters of 
immediate personal and professional concern and not permitting 
a very clear-cut separation of the groups. Involve so many addi¬ 
tional assumptions that the results are offered only as qualitative 
and suggestive evidence which it is hoped may provide clues In 
relating the examination results to their social setting. 

Summary of the General Situation 
There are two markedly different, although not rigidly 
separable, groups of students studying high school French. As 
the grouping is largely a matter of geography, it seems safe to 
assume that the nature and relative numerical strength of each 
group will, barring large-scale emigrations or immigrations, 
remain fairly constant over a number of years. There Is a small

-47- 

group, comprising probably about 7 % percent of the total population 
finishing high school, which has been expected to pursue the same 
courses and write the same examinations as the larger group,despite 
such differences as a French-speaking home and/or community, a markedly 
superior level of achievement on almost all items of an examination 
intended primarily for students whose knowledge of French is limited 
to training in grades IX to XII inclusive, A very high percentage of 
these French-speaking students have in the elementary grades also 
taken extensive work in reading,writing and speaking French as well 
as French grammar, it is not suprising,theitfore, that these students 
differ in many ways fromthe larger non-French group; their parents 
and teachers have probably held somewhat different objectives before 
them and developed in them somewhat different skills,attitudes, 
interests and purposes. General evidence of such differences has 
been found in all the tabular comparisons made in this study;in 
particular, tables III and IV reveal striking general differences. 
There is no implication intended here that any or all of these diver¬ 
gences should be either encouraged or discouraged; yet it would seem 
advantageous to study them more precisely. 

The Inclusion of this French-speaking group in the total pop¬ 
ulation has somewhat depressed the marks, especially the high ones, 
of the non-French students. An estimated total of 120 non-French 
students ?;ere thus thrown Into a lower category on the 1944, French 3 
examination than they would otherwise have received. This figure is 
certainly not seriously above the true number, but may possibly be 
an under-estimation. It is very probable too that setting a paper 
including valid tests of aural-oral attainment would lead to still 
more marked divergence

between the marks of tbs two groups. 

There is a variety of evidence suggesting tbat attain¬ 
ment among non-French students generally is far from satisfactory. 
Close study of their examination responses repeatedly revealed 
complete bewilderment; indeed, the large number of errors made on 
the thirteen questions treated in Table IX could scarcely have 
occurred without the wildest guessing on the part of many students. 
Such erratic answers, not entirely confined to the non-French 
group, tend to obscure typical achievement patterns, for one word 
may contain several different types of error. Despite the presence 
of some borderline cases in each group and the likelihood, too, of 
seme incorrect classification of students and also despite the fact 
that non-French students more frequently skipped difficult test 
items, this group averaged considerably more than twice as many 
errors per paper as did the French-speaking group. 

$hile there is still room for wide differences of opin¬ 
ion as to the nature and relative importance of factors responsible 
for this situation, yet opinions and other evidence seem to point 
to a number of difficulties. These include such features as 
attempting a reading approach heavily weighted with more or less 
formal grammar which the previous training of students has not 
prepared them to grasp without sustained and strenuous effort; 
inadequate teacher qualifications to teach French as a living and 
spoken medium of communication and self-expression; circumstantial 
limitations such as lack of appropriate realia, reading material 
and other instructional aids which require improved administrational 
and financial provision; student apathy or discouragement apparently 
becoming more pronounced in each successive year of French study; 1 

Tl Such discouragement in l^lT studehts may be due to some extent to 

the prospect of receiving depressed marks on the French 3 final 

examinations.

and a tendency towards indefiniteness and uncertainty as to pro¬ 
per goals of French language instruction in the high school. 

There is also apparent n wide range of views as to the legitimate 
role of French on the high school curriculum - the number of 
schools which should offer the subject, the percentage of pupils 
who should take it, the optimum beginning age and the number of 
years required for reasonable attainment and consolidation of 
gains for use in life. A substantial majority of those expressing 
opinions show strong faith in the potential values of the subject 
and favor lowering the beginning age or otherwise increasing the 
time allotment. This attitude may, however, be viewed circum¬ 
spectly inasmuch as it is not surprising that teachers of French 
should tend to believe strongly in the value of their work. In 
any case, it seems in order to suggest that, in the light of the 
cumulative weight of evidence of this study, an improvement in 
the quality of courses now being offered to NFB students is a more 
valid immediate objective than an increase in the quantity or time 
allotment. 

Problems Raised and Suggestions 

Of the many problems arising from the different sec¬ 
tions of this report, only a few will be mentioned here. Any 
practical suggestions, either implicit in the wording of problems 
or explicitly stated, are offered only as examples of tentative, 
working conclusions or proposals which seem reasonably consistent 
with the findings and viewpoint outlined above. 

Perhaps the most widely-sensed, serious problem is that 
of teacher training. In view of the obvious bearing of this 
problem upon most other problems, of the general agreement as to

- 50 - 


the woeful inadequacy of teacher training, and of the high optim¬ 
ism. regarding what might be accomplished under favorable condi¬ 
tions, it seems not unreasonable to hope that many of the obstacle's 
to success now felt to be most serious might be largely obviated 
by adequate rovision for the training of teachers of French. The 
need most often mentioned in this connection was for reasonable 
fluency in oral French of good quality. Many other needs in 
teacher training will become apparent from broader considerations 
such as those sketched in Chapter II and from agreement as to 
working objectives. Regardless of details, a realistic programme 
for improving teacher qualifications, and enabling high school 
students throughout the Province to benefit therefrom, would seem 
to involve administrative steps aimed at improving institutional 
and financial facilities not only for thorough training of teachers 
but also for retention and full use of their services. 

A few further problems which are thought to merit 
serious study may be listed. First, the feasibility of trans¬ 
ferring at least part of our attention from France to French 
Canada, with possible exchange of teachers with Quebec, may be 
considered. A second problem is how to mitigate our linguistic 
isolation and provide more post-school opportunity for fruitful 
and satisfying use of French language attainments. A third pro¬ 
blem, closely related to the preceding two, is how and to what 
extent French-teaching in Alberta high schools raay be integrated 
with a comprehensive programme for promoting Canadian unity and 
national wellbeing. A fourth problem is how to build up attitudes, 
in both school and community, which are more sensitive to language 
needs and more favorable to sustained optimism and effort on the 
part of students. Scores of additional problems will suggest

themselves. 

finally there is the |>roblem, of rather central interest 
in this study, of how and to vdiat extent the differences between 
the two groups of students herein compared should be recognized 
and provided for. Possibilities which might be considered as 
partial solutions include, (a) setting up of separate courses 
better adapted to the needs and attainment levels of each group, 
(b) setting two different examination papers, (e) separation of 
the marks of the two groups of studem.s before statistical trans¬ 
mutation, and (d) transfer, in the FB group, of some of the 
effort currently devoted tc French, from this subject to English 
in an effort to remove the English handicap found to obtain in 
this group.

For the Teacher of French 
Dear Sir or Madam: 

Thank you very much for the 

information provided last June. It was of great value 
with only two schools circularized failing to reply. 

In order to complete the study, it would help greatly 
if your Teacher of French could also find time to do 
the foil Giving: 

2. State the number and percentage 
of your 1945-46 High School students who have some 
French language background beyond that gained in French 
courses of grades IX to XII. (Just fill in blanks in 
the form provided.) 

5. State the number and percentage 
of your 1945-46 High School students who have taken all 
or part of the elementary French courses offered in the 
lower grades in some schools where there are French- 
speaking pupils. (Blanks provided).

les obseques de la vietime, un jeune Canadien de 21 ans auront lieu vers 
17 beures; aussitot des masses de fleurs arrivent a 1 ’hopital et la foule defile 
devant la depouille mortelle du jeune heros. 

Le commandant allemand fait savoir qu’il ne tolerera pas que la foule 
suive au cimetiere, et qu’il ne prendra pas les fleurs envoyees par la population. 

En effet, au cimetiere les grilles sont fermees, pendant que 5,000 
personnes attendent la sortie des Boches en chantant la Marseillaise. Au moment 
ou les Boches ressortent, les cris de “Vive De Gaulle” jaillisent de la foule. 
Des que les grilles sont ouvertes, on entre et chacun depose les fleurs interdites 
devant la tombe.

aux questions suivantes: 

Monsieur de Turenne, passant une nuit pres des ramparts de Paris, 
tomba entre les mains d’une bande de voleurs qui arreterent son carrosse. 
Pour conserver une bague d’or de peu de valeur, mais a laquelle il tenait 
beaucoup, M. de Turenne leur promit cent louis d’or, et les voleurs la lui 
laisserent. Le lendemain l’un d’eux eut l’audace d’alter chez lui, au milieu 
d’une grande compagnie, lui demander a Poreille la somme promise. Turenne 
fit donner les cent louis, et avant de raconter 1’aventure, laissa au voleur le 
temps de s’eloigner. 

— Mais vous ne deviez rien donner, dit-on autour de lui, car une promesse 
faite par la force et sous la menace n’a point de valeur. 

— Je ne devais pas cet argent a ces coquins, repondit Turenne, je le 
devais a ma parole, et un honnete homme ne doit jamais manquer a sa parole, 
meme donnee a des fripons.
