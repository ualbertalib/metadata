CHANGES IN CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OP 
FLOUR FROM WHEAT GROWN ON THE BLACK AND GRAY 
SOIIS OF ALBERTA 


Alexander Thompson Sinclair 


INTRODUCTION 


The quality and keeping properties of flour milled 
from the 1932 and 1933 crops of wheat grown on the hlack 
soil at Edmonton and on the gray soil at Fallis have 
been found to differ markedly (1). Baking tests carried 
out one month after milling showed that the Edmonton 
grown samples produced the larger loaves, the differences 
in the average results being largely accounted for by 
the differences in protein content of the samples from 
the two places. Baking tests carried out ten months 
after milling shoYred that the Edmonton samples had 
maintained their original quality while the Fallis 
samples, stored under the same conditions, had deteriorated 
markedly. The results also shoY/ed that there were 
differences in the keeping properties of flour milled 
from different varieties of wheat. 

Considerable work has been done on the changes 
taking place during the aging of flour, but as far as

the writer knows no results comparable to those obtained 
with the Edmonton and Fallis flours have been reported. 
It is known that definite changes in the chemical and 
physical properties of flour take place during the aging 
process. It seemed probable that the differences in 
behavior of the Edmonton and Fallis flours would be 
manifested by differences in the rates at which these 
changes took place. 

The results of the investigations reported in 
this paper deal with the changes taking place in the 
chemical and physical properties of the Edmonton and 
Fallis flours. The results of these determinations 
suggested a number of miscellaneous experiments, the 
results of which might aid in explaining the general 
processes involved in the aging of flour. Several such 
experiments were carried out using flour which was 
available in large quantities, since the amount of 
Edmonton and Fallis flours remaining after the second 
baking test was small. 


REVIEW 


There is general agreement among bakers, millers 
and chemists that flour improves in baking quality during 
storage. This improvement is rapid at first and continues 
until a maximum is reached after which deterioration

begins. The time required to reach maximum improvement 
or noticeable deterioration depends on several factors 
such as, the soundness of wheat from which the flour is 
milled, the grade of flour, the moisture content of the 
flour, and the temperature and relative humidity at which 
the flour is stored. 

High grade flour milled from sound wheat and 
stored under proper conditions shows no appreciable signs 
of deterioration for several years (8,6,34,35). It is 
believed that the processes causing improvement and 
deterioration of flour during storage are the same, 
deterioration being merely a result of the process going 
beyond the point of maximum improvement. High tempera¬ 
tures result in a rapid improvement in flour quality but 
shorten the time necessary for deterioration to become 
noticeable (3,34). Low grade flour deteriorates more 
rapidly than high grade, the difference being most 
noticeable when such flour is stored at high temperatures 
(23,35). Flour of high moisture content deteriorates more 
rapidly than flour from the same sample at a lower 
moisture content. Flour should therefore be stored in an 
atmosphere of low relative humidity or in a sealed con¬ 
tainer (6,35). 

Considerable research on problems directly or 
indirectly related to the study of flour improvement and 
deterioration has been carried on during recent years, and

has served to indicate some of the factors involved. A 
comprehensive review of all the literature pertaining 
to this subject is beyond the scope of this paper and 
is not attempted. Representative papers dealing with 
phases of the work covered in the present study are 
discussed. 


Acidity 


It is generally agreed that the acidity of 
flour, measured either as titrable acidity or hydrogen ion 
concentration, increases progressively during storage. 
Greaves and Hirst (16) found, however, that the hydrogen 
ion concentration of flour decreased during the first two 
years of storage. They explained the decrease as being 
due to protein cleavage, the split-products not only 
neutralising the acids produced but combining with the 
acid present at the time of storage. Their method for 
determining hydrogen ion concentration was not given, and 
this makes it difficult to evaluate the results. The 
fact that these pH values were so much higher than those 
obtained by most other workers necessitates that they be 
substantiated before they can be unquestionably accepted. 

It is usually agreed that the increase in 
acidity of flour is due mainly to the break down of 
lipoids and that the amino and phosphoric acids contribute

only a small part (16,19). The process by which the 
fatty acids are formed from the lipoids is, however, not 
so well known. Kozmin (22) believes that they are formed 
by hydrolysis, that no oxygen is required and that tempera¬ 
ture is the most important factor. There is, however, no 
reason to believe that oxygen is not an important factor 
in the break down of lipoids, since it has been shown that 
in the break down of free fats, oxygen is important. 

There seems to be no general agreement as to the 
value of acidity as a measure of flour deterioration. The 
Greek government has imposed acidity limits on various 
grades of imported flours, but cereal chemists are not 
agreed that this is justifiable (7,9,24). 

Flour Absorption 


Many workers have found that the water absorption 
of flour increases with time of storage (16,34,35). The 
reason for this increase is not definitely known, but it is 
probably associated with the changes undergone by the 
proteins in the aging process. It has been suggested that 
this increase in absorption is due to the increase in 
acidity of the flour during storage. It is known that 
dilute acids cause an increase in the imbibitional 
properties of gluten. Kling, Froidevaux and Dubois (21)

believe that the protein particles are covered with an 
adsorbed layer of lipoids and the liberation of fatty 
acids causes a lowering of the interfacial tension 
between the water and the protein particles. This would 
increase the imbibitional properties of the proteins. 
Bailey (3), however, does not believe that increased 
acidity will account for all of the increase in absorption 
and suggests that some modification of the colloidal 
properties of the proteins, due to factors other than 
acidity, must take place. Kent-Jones (20) found that 
heat treated flours showed increased absorption due to 
a greater aggregation of the protein particles. 

Lipoids 


The importance of lipoids, as a factor in 
bringing about improvement or deterioration during the 
storage of flour, has received considerable attention in 
recent years. The term lipoid is a general one including 
a wide variety of substances. The nature of many of 
these substances makes it highly probable that they are 
adsorbed to other constituents in flour. It is therefore 
only with great difficulty that all of the lipoids are 
removed. This is no doubt one of the factors ?/hich has 
retarded the understanding of the part played by these 
substances. Such a solvent as hot alcohol which effects

a fairly complete removal of the lipoids denatures the 
proteins, thus making the flour useless for many studies. 
Ether, the common solvent used, extracts only part of the 
lipoids. This is probably the main reason for the dis¬ 
agreement commonly found in the results of various workers. 

Many theories have been advanced as to the role 
played by lipoids in determining quality and keeping 
properties of flour. The summary of the work will of 
necessity be rather disconnected since it is difficult to 
relate all the results obtained. 

Sullivan and Near (32) have suggested that the 
lipoid-protein ratio is an important index of flour 
quality. There is little evidence to substantiate this 
although the addition of germ to flour, which would 
increase the lipoid-protein ratio, is known to lower the 
baking quality (12,28). It is also known that the lower 
grades of flour are higher in lipoids than the better grades. 
The addition of various fats and oils also affect the 
quality of the flour, some beneficially and some 
deleteriously (10,12,28). 

Geddes (12) believes that the effect of heat 
treatment on a flour is associated mainly with the germ 
constituents. ICent-Jones (20), however, disagrees with 
this and maintains that the heat treatment of flour has a 
direct effect on the proteins. Since it is believed that 
lipoids affect the colloidal behavior of the proteins it

is possible that the two theories are not irreconcilable. 
Working (37) believes that phosphatides are the important 
constituents affecting the physical properties of gluten. 
He believes that the gluten forms a mesh work of strands 
with the phosphatides adsorbed on them and acting as a 
lubricant. 

The amount of lipoids in flour is found to 
decrease during storage as a result of oxidation or 
hydrolytic processes (15,33). This decrease in lipoidal 
content may have some effect on the physical properties 
of proteins. 

Physical Properties of Flour Proteins 


It has been observed by many workers that as the 
aging of flour proceeds, changes in the physical properties 
of the proteins take place. The changes manifest them¬ 
selves in the handling qualities of the gluten washed 
from the flour (3,22) and also in the baking properties 
(16,34). Kozmin (10) states the changes in physical 
properties of the gluten during the aging of flour are due 
to an accumulation of unsaturated fatty acids. These 
acids render the gluten less extensible and elastic and 
their removal restores the original quality of the gluten. 
Geoffrey (15) seems, to agree with this explanation for he 
believes that the changes in the physical properties of

gluten are due mainly to the action of lipase on the 
glycerides to form fatty acids. As has already been 
mentioned, Working (36) suggests that the changes which 
cause the dispersion of the phosphatides bring about an 
increased lubrication of the gluten strands. This would 
result in changes in physical properties of the gluten. 

It is known that the removal of the lipoidal substances of 
flour (18,28) or the addition of fats and oils (10,12,37) 
cause changes in the physical properties of the gluten. 

Potel (26) believes that the reducing power of a flour 
gives an indication of the physical properties which can be 
expected of the dough. This was demonstrated by lowering 
the reducing power by heat, aging or addition of hydrogen 
peroxide which resulted in physical changes of the dough. 
Proteolytic enzymes may cause marked changes of the physical 
properties of the proteins of flour (5,27). 

A brief review of the literature on the subject 
of the changes in flour during storage leads to the con¬ 
clusion that there are many factors involved in the 
process. The evidence in favor of the lipoids being one 
of the most important factors bringing about the changes 
is becoming much stronger. It is for this reason that 
so much emphasis is placed on lipoids in the present 
study.

MATERIAL 


1932 series 


The 1932 series of flour was experimentally 
milled from wheat of standard varieties and hybrids grown 
at Edmonton and Fallis. The flour was stored in the 
laboratory in cans with close fitting covers. Baking 
tests were carried out one and ten months after storage. 
After the second baking test such small quantities of 
individual samples remained that bulking was necessary in 
order that further studies might be carried on. Samples 
which had shown similar results during storage were mixed 
and placed in glass sealers with air-tight covers. The 
sealers were placed on shelves and subjected to the 
temperature variations of the laboratory. 

1933 Series 


The 1933 series of flour was experimentally 
milled in the fall of 1933 from wheat of standard varieties 
and hybrids grown at Edmonton and Fallis. Small quantities 
of the wheat were stored until May 1935 and the flour 
milled from this was used to compare with the flour milled 
in 1933. The storage of the flour was carried out in two 
types of containers, cotton sacks and sealers, fitted with

air-tight covers. The flour stored in the cotton sacks was 
exposed to the fluctuations in temperature and humidity of 
the laboratory, while that stored in the sealers was 
subjected to light and temperature changes. The laboratory 
in which the flour was stored was fairly well lighted and 
although it sometimes reached a fairly high temperature 
during the summer, it was seldom very cold during the 
winter. The humidity was in general low and the samples 
stored in sacks probably lost moisture fairly rapidly 
during the first part of the storage period. At the time 
of the second baking the moisture content of this flour 
was approximately 10% while that of the samples stored in 
sealers was approximately 13%. 

Storage Experiment 


The flours used in this esperiment were milled 
from sound wheat of four standard varieties gro?m on the 
black soil. The three varieties, Garnet, Marquis and 
Reward ?^ere obtained from the Dominion Experimental Station 
at lacombe and should, therefore, be fairly comparahle. 

The Red Bobs sample was grown east of Edmonton and had a 
protein content slightly lower than that of Garnet. The 
flour was stored in the laboratory in cans with close 
fitting covers. The moisture content of the flour was 
approximately 12% and varied little during storage. The

conditions of storage in the laboratory were very similar 
to those which obtained during the storage of the 1932 
series. 

A high grade wheat germ obtained from a 
commercial mill was used in the experiments. It was finely 
ground in the experimental mill and most of the bran flakes 
removed by bolting. This germ was stored in a sealed 
container in the refrigerator at a temperature of 1°C. 


METHODS 


Baking 


Unless otherwise stated all bread was baked using 
the bromate formula with one mgm. of potassium bromate per 
loaf (2). The use of the simple formula with the 1932 
series and the malt-phosphate-bromate formula with the 
1933 series gave results from which essentially the same 
conclusions were drawn as to the baking qualities of these 
flours, furthermore, the results obtained by G-eddes and 
McCalla (14) showed that wheat grown in Alberta yielded 
flour sufficiently high in diastatic activity to justify 
the use of the bromate formula, although increased loaf 
volumes were obtained when malt and phosphate were added 
to the formula.

The partial baking score was calculated in the 
manner described by Geddes, Malloch and Larmour (13) for 
the baking score except that the figure for loaf volume 
was excluded. 


Protein Content 


Nitrogen was determined by the Ejeldahl method 
using mercuric oxide as catalyst. Protein is reported as 
nitrogen x 5.7 and the results corrected to a 13.5$ 
moisture basis. 


Acidity 


Acidity was determined by the Greek method (9) 
using tincture of curcuma as indicator. Results are given 
as the number of cc. of 0.02 normal sodium hydroxide to 
neutralize 10 cc. of the alcoholic extract. 

Hydrogen ion Concentration 


The hydrogen ion concentration, expressed in the 
tables as pH was determined using a type K potentiometer 
with the quinhydrone gold electrode.

Ten gm. samples of flour were each shaken with 
50 cc. of distilled water. Most of the determinations Y/ere 
made on the resulting flour suspension which was maintained 
by a constant stirring device. Some determinations, 
however, were made on the decantate of the centrifuged 
flour and water suspensions. 

Lipoids 


The lipoids in the flour were extracted with 
ether, alcohol-ether and either a hot alcohol-ammonia 
solution or hot alcohol. 

Ether Extraction . 

If lour for the ether extraction was first dried in 
vacuum over concentrated sulphuric acid. A 10 gm. sample 
was then placed in a stoppered centrifuge tube with 50 cc. 
of diethyl ether and shaken at frequent intervals for two 
hours. The contents were then centrifuged and the ether 
extract decanted. The extracted flour was subsequently 
washed with two 25 cc. portions of ether and these extracts 
added to the original decantate. The total decantate was 
then evaporated to a small volume, placed in a tared 
vessel and dried to constant weight in an air oven at 60°C. 
Although this technique is somewhat different from that 
usually used, satisfactory results were obtained and the

amount of extract determined for the various flours agreed 
well with the results of other workers. 

Alcohol-ether Extraction . 

The alcohol-ether extraction was similar to that 
described for the ether extraction except that a 1:1 
mixture of diethyl ether and 95$ ethyl alcohol was used 
as the solvent. The extract, after the alcohol and ether 
had been distilled off, was re-extracted with hot 
chloroform. The chloroform solution was placed in a tared 
vessel, evaporated to a small volume and dried to constant 
weight in an air oven at 100°C. 

This method is a modification of the one used by 
Channon and Poster (8) # 

Sullivan and Hear (31) used an alcohol-ether 
extraction method in which they first extracted with hot 
alcohol and then followed with an ether extraction, thus 
it is quite different from the method described above. 

Hot Alcohol-ammonia Extraction . 

The alcohol-ammonia extraction ?ms made with 50 
cc. of a 9:1 mixture of 95$ ethyl alcohol and concentrated 
ammonium hydroxide added to 10 gm. of alcohol-ether 
extracted flour in a 100 cc. centrifuge tube. The ex¬ 
traction was carried out at 70°C. and repeated with a 
second volume of solvent. The extract was obtained by

centrifuging and decanting, and the decantate was treated 
in the same manner as that from the alcohol-ether 
extraction. 

This method is a modification of the one used "by 
Sullivan and Near (31) for determining the lipoids in 
gluten. 

A number of determinations on various samples of 
flour gave irregular results with poor agreement among 
replicate determinations. Tests revealed that the alcohol- 
ammonia solution extracted a considerable quantity of 
protein from the flour and although the extracts were re- 
extracted with chloroform there still appeared to be con¬ 
tamination of the lipoids. Further investigations showed 
that hot 95 % alcohol alone removed less protein and gave 
better agreement among replicate results. It was, 
therefore, used in ail later work.

deterioration as indicated by the partial baking score, 
which summarizes the characteristics of the loaf other 
than volume. There was very little deterioration of the 
corresponding Fallis sample. The average of the results 
for the 15 varieties showed a wide difference between the 
Edmonton and Fallis samples. There was a marked decrease 
in loaf volume and partial baking score of the Fallis

samples after ten months storage while the Edmonton samples 
maintained their original quality. These results indicate 
that there were decided differences in the keeping proper¬ 
ties of the flour from the different varieties of wheat. 

The average baking results for nine varieties of 
the 1932 series are presented in Table II. The results 
obtained one and ten months after milling are the average 
of results for individual varieties. The results for two 
and three years after milling were obtained from baking 
tests carried out on the combined residues of the flour 
remaining after the second baking. The Edmonton sample 
had deteriorated little after two years storage. The partial 
baking score was actually higher than that for the tiro 
earlier tests, due mainly to an improvement in texture and 
crumb color. The Faliis sample had deteriorated more after 
ten months storage than the Edmonton sample had after three 
years. These results are definite proof that the rate of 
deterioration of the Faliis sample was much the greater.

1933 Series , 

The baking results for the 1933 series stored by 
two methods are given in Table III. The results presented 
are for the varieties which were used in the later 
detailed studies, and the following discussion applies 
only to these samples. The results for the series as a 
whole have been discussed (1). 

The Eallis samples, with the exception of 
1-28-60, all deteriorated after 12 months storage. Garnet 
and 1-28-60 grown at Edmonton deteriorated considerably 
during the same storage period. As indicated by loaf 
volume, there was greater deterioration of the flour 
stored in sacks than of that stored in sealers. This 
was true for all varieties grown at both Edmonton and 
Fallis. The deterioration as indicated by partial baking 
score was not so evident, in fact there ¥/as little 
difference between the samples of the two series. Since 
the samples were all stored in the same laboratory, 
temperature effects should have been the same for both 
series, and the differences in loaf volume must have been 
brought about by differences in moisture, aeration and 
light.

stored flours is shown by the results presented in Table 
IV. This series was baked using the malt-phosphate- 
bromate formula (14). The addition of germ resulted in a 
decided decrease in loaf volume. The partial baking 
score, although the results are not given in the table, 
was also lowered about eight units on the average. The 
loaves were flat and had a coarse open texture and yellow 
crumb color. Other workers have reported the lov/ering in 
quality of flour as the result of the addition of germ. 

The absorption increased at approximately the same rate 
for all varieties during storage and seemed to have no 
relation to the stage of deterioration of the flour. The 
increase in absorption with lapse of time in storage has 
also been noted by other workers. 

The varieties showed differences in keeping 
properties as indicated by the baking results. The loaf 
volume of Reward was higher after 13 months storage than 
at the time of the original bake. Red Bobs deteriorated 
little in the same period, while Marquis and G-arnet 
deteriorated decidedly. These results substantiate those 
obtained with the Bdmonton and Fallis flours with respect 
to the differences in the keeping properties of flour from 
different varieties of wheat. Aamodt and McCalla (1) 
found that the keeping properties of the flour from Reward 
were better than those of the flour from most of the other 
standard varieties. The results for Revfard are not

presented in Tables I and III as there was insufficient 
wheat and flour to use in any of the later studies. 

The addition of germ to the flour did not seem 
to affect the rate of deterioration. This was indicated 
by the fact that the spread between the loaf volume of 
the control and that of the sample with added germ did 
not increase during storage. Added germ would of 
necessity increase the lipoid content of the flour, but 
these results indicate that such lipoids are not important 
in bringing about deterioration of the flour. If lipoids 
are important in flour deterioration those from the 

endosperm rather than those from the germ must be 
instrumental in causing changes. The amount of lipoids 
resulting from germ contamination in a patent flour must 
be small compared with the actual lipoid content of the 
flour. It seems unlikely that differences in low and 
high grade flours are due to differences in the amount 
of lipoids resulting from contamination of the flours by 
germ constituents.

presented in Table V. A comparison of the acidity with 
the baking results given in Table I indicates that there 
was a definite relation betv/een the acidity and the stage 
of deterioration of the flour. Samples of Supreme had 
not deteriorated and had low acidities; Bed Bobs and 
Early Triumph grown at Fallis and S-28-2 grown at 
Edmonton had deteriorated markedly and had high acidities. 
Within varieties the relation between acidity and 
deterioration was even more marked, the deteriorated 
sample always having a much higher acidity.

deteriorated sample had the lower pH. The range of pH 
values for the different flours was small so the determina¬ 
tion of pH as a measure of the degree of deterioration of 
a flour is of little value. Buffer curves for a number 
of these flours were plotted but no great differences were 
found. 

Within a variety the sample with the higher 
acidity had the lower pH. Differences in acidity, however, 
were so much greater than those in pH, that acidity must 
be considered the better indicator of deterioration. 

1935 Series . 

The results for acidities and pH values of the 
flours from the 1933 series one and 16 months after 
milling are given in Table VI. The relation between the 
acidity of the flour and the degree of deterioration was 
not so marked in this as in the 1932 series. 

The acidity of the flour stored in sealers was 
decidedly higher than that of the flour stored in sacks. 

It is probable that this was due to differences in hydro¬ 
lytic or oxidative processes caused by differences in 
light, aeration or moisture content of the flour in the 
two series. The lack of agreement between the baking and 
acidity results for flours stored under various conditions 
leads to the conclusion that acidity is a poor measure of

little value as a measure of the deterioration processes, 
since there is little agreement between the pH value and 
the degree of deterioration either among the varieties or 
within a variety. 

There is also poor agreement between the 
acidity and the pH value of a flour as shown from these 
results. This is contradictory to the results presented 
in Table V, but it seems quite possible that the increases 
in acidity in the flours of the 1930 series were not 
necessarily of the same nature as the increases in acidity 
of those of the 1932 series. 

Storage Experiment . 

The results indicating the effect of added germ 
on the acidity of stored flours are presented in Table 
VII. A comparison of these with the baking results given 
in Table IV shows that there was a definite relation 
between the rate of increase in acidity and the keeping 
properties of the flour. Reward with the best keeping 
properties showed the least increase in acidity, while 
Garnet with the poorest keeping properties showed the 
greatest increase. The apparent relation between acidity 
and keeping properties does not necessarily mean that 
acidity was the cause of the deterioration. It is much 
more likely that it was an accompanying rather than a 
causal effect. The addition of 3 °/o germ to the flour did

not appear to accelerate the rate of increase in acidity. 
This agrees with the baking results presented in Table IV. 
The increase in acidity due to added germ could have 
played no part in the resulting reduction of loaf volume. 
This reduction must have been brought about by some other 
constituent of the germ.

little difference in the amount of ether extract from 
the various samples of flour, hut a decided decrease in 
ether extract took place with deterioration. There was 
a decrease in the alcohol-ether extract of all hut one 
of the stored samples, deteriorated or non-deteriorated. 
The results for the hot alcohol-ammonia extracts are not 
presented in the tables since little confidence could he 
placed on their accuracy. The results, however, 
indicated a decrease in the amount of extract after 
storage. The general decrease in lipoidal content of the 
stored flours suggests that a breakdown of the lipoids 
occurred and that some of the products of decomposition 
were rendered insoluble in the solvents used.

The lipoid-protein ratios for the representative 
fresh and stored flours of the 1933 series are presented 
in Table IX. The higher ratios were obtained for the 
Eallis samples. This was to be expected from the results 
presented in Tables III and VIII which showed that the 
Eallis samples were definitely lower in protein but little 
different in lipoid content. Sullivan and Near (31) have 
suggested the lipoid-protein ratio as an index of 
quality; the higher the ratio the poorer the quality.

the non-deteriorated stored samples, and this suggests 
that as flour ages the lower the ratio the poorer the 
quality. This indicates that the lipoid-protein ratio 
can he taken as neither an index of quality nor a measure 
of deterioration. 

Physical Properties of Gluten 

1952 Series . 

The results of the studies on the properties 
of wet gluten in relation to the acidity of flour are 
presented in Table X. There appears to be a direct 
relation between the moisture content of the gluten and 
the quality; the lower the moisture content the poorer 
the quality. This indicates that as deterioration 
proceeds the imbibitions! capacity of the gluten proteins 
decreases. The results also show that in general flour 
with a high acidity yielded gluten of low moisture content 
and poor quality. The results presented in Table VIII 
indicated that the lipoids decreased during the aging 
of the flour. It is possible that the breakdown of 
lipoids during deterioration causes not only an increase 
in the acidity but also a decrease in the imbibitional 
capacity of the proteins.

The results of the effect of pH of the wash 
water on the moisture content of gluten from Early Triumph 
and Red Bobs flours from the 1932 series are given in 
Table XI. These flours were chosen because they yielded 
glutens of decidedly different quality as shown in 
Table X. Sorenson’s phosphate buffers of various pH 
values were used in mixing the dough and as wash water. 

The lowering of the pH of the wash v/ater increased the 
moisture content of the washed gluten. This increase was 
less for the high than for the low quality gluten, 
probably indicating that under the conditions of the 
experiment the good quality was closer than was the poor

quality gluten to its maximum swelling capacity. The poor 
quality gluten obtained when wash water with a pH of 4.0 
was used had a lower moisture content than the good 
gluten obtained with wash water at a pH of 6.8. Increasing 
the acidity of the wash water to a pH of 3.5 made it 
impossible to wash gluten from the poor quality flours.

These results indicated that the imbibitional properties 
of the gluten proteins were increased with the increase 
in acidity of the mixed dough and the wash water. This 
agrees with the results of other workers on the swelling 
of glutens in dilute acids, but is seemingly contra¬ 
dictory to the results given in Table X. From work on 
gluten it would be expected that flours with high acidity

would yield glutens with increased inhibitional capacity. 
This suggests that the effect of fatty acids may be quite 
different from that of other acids. It has already been 
suggested that the fatty acids accumulate as a result of 
the breakdown of lipoids, and that it is the breakdown 
of lipoids rather than the accumulation of the fatty acids 
which is directly responsible for the changes in the 
imbibitional capacity of the gluten. 

1933 Series . 

The quality of gluten from fresh flour and that 
stored in sacks of the 1933 series is qualitatively 
indicated in Table XII* There was little difference 
between the glutens of corresponding Edmonton and Eallis 
samples from freshly milled flour. The gluten from the 
stored flour, however, showed decided differences in 
quality. The properties of gluten from the non-deteriorated 
flour were unchanged, while those of the gluten from the 
deteriorated flour had altered markedly. The latter 
gluten was coarse, open, hard, inelastic and non- 
extensible. It has been found that such gluten is 
characteristic of all deteriorated flour. 

Numerous theories have been advanced to account 
for the changes in the physical properties of gluten 
during storage and these will be discussed later in this 
paper. The results of the foregoing experiments indicate

that the changes are associated with increased acidity 
and decreased iipoidal content, but no definite con¬ 
clusions as to the direct relation of these factors can 
be drawn. 


Miscellaneous Results 


The results presented in the following tables 
are from a number of preliminary experiments carried out 
with the object of obtaining more information on the 
processes involved in the deterioration of flour. It was 
expected that the information obtained from these experi¬ 
ments might aid in explaining the differences in keeping 
properties of the flours from the wheat grown at Edmonton 
and Eallis. 

The results indicating the effect of the 
addition of various substances on the baking quality of 
an unbleached commercial patent flour are presented in 
Table XIII. The addition of 5 % germ to the flower loY/ered 
the loaf volume and partial baking score of the baked 
bread, an effect already discussed. Meither ether nor 
hot alcohol extraction of the germ removed its deleterious 
effect. This indicates that some material not soluble in 
these solvents, possibly the protein, was responsible for 
the lowering of the quality of the flour. The baking 
results were not significantly altered by either the

were the baking results affected by similar extracts of 
a deteriorated or non-deteriorated flour. The bread 
baked from the ether extracted flour was lower than the 
control in loaf volume, but higher in partial baking 
score. Previous experiments with ether extracted flour 
are in agreement with this result.

alcohol extracted flour, however, were markedly different 
in handling properties * They were hard and non- 
extensible, resembling gluten from badly deteriorated 
flour. The addition of germ to the flours improved the 
quality of the gluten but did not restore all of the 
original properties. It is recognised that the addition 
of germ would not replace substances of the same nature as 
those removed by the solvents used, so the original 
properties could not be expected to be entirely restored. 
The results obtained indicate, however, that lipoidal 
substances are important in determining the physical 
properties of the gluten. 

In previous experiments attempts were made to 
disperse the glutens obtained from deteriorated and non- 
deteriorated flour. The method of dispersion employed 
was similar to that described by Hose and Cook (30) who 
used 10% sodium salicylate as the solvent. This reagent 
effects complete dispersion of good quality wet gluten 
in approximately 3 hours. The gluten from the deteriorated 
flour had not completely dispersed after 5 hr. of frequent 
shaking in the solvent. It broke up readily into fine 
particles which settled to the bottom of the comparatively

non-deteriorated flour was completely dispersed in 
approximately 2 hr. and produced a viscous semi-opaque 
solution with no visible particles of gluten present. 

When germ was added to the deteriorated flour the gluten

could be completely dispersed and when added to the non- 
deteriorated flour the gluten could be dispersed in 
approximately 0.5 hr. 

It was assumed from these results that lipoids 
might be the factor affecting the solubility of the 
gluten, so dispersion of the glutens from the extracted 
flours was attempted. Qualitative results only are 
reported because of the difficulty in effecting a complete 
separation of the very fine particles of gluten from 
the rather viscous solution. The glutens from the control 
and the ether extracted flour could be completely 
dispersed. If germ were added to these flours the dis¬ 
persion of the gluten was effected in a much shorter time. 
This indicates that some constituent of the germ, 
presumably the lipoids, affected the solubility of the 
gluten. The alcohol-ether and alcohol extracted flours 
yielded glutens which could not be completely dispersed 
in the solvent. If germ were added to these flours, the 
glutens could then be completely dispersed. It is 
believed by many workers that alcohol denatures the 
gluten proteins, but if this is so, it is difficult to 
explain why the addition of germ to the extracted flour 
restores the solubility of the gluten. The alcohol-ether 
and alcohol extractions probably removed fairly completely 
the lipoidal substances of the flour, and it seems

likely that the lipoids of the germ restored the original 
solubility of the gluten. 

The results indicating the effect on gluten of 
fatty acids added to an unbleached commercial patent 
flour are given in Table XV. The addition of 1 % stearic 
acid as a powder had little effect on the gluten, but 
when the acid was added in ether solution a decided 
effect was noted. The gluten obtained was hard and non- 
extensible and could not be completely dispersed in 
sodium salicylate. In these respects it resembled the 
gluten from a deteriorated flour. Stearic acid is 
insoluble in water and when added as a powder was 
probably carried away mechanically during the washing of 
the gluten. When added in ether solution the acid was 
in a form much more likely to be adsorbed and was 
probably not removed in the washing. The addition of Ifo 
oleic acid to the flour yielded a gluten similar to that 
produced with the addition of stearic acid dissolved in 
ether. Previous experiments demonstrated that if the 
same quantity of oleic acid were added to the two flours 
differing in protein content, the effect would be less 
noticeable on the flour with the higher protein. If the 
quantity of oleic acid added was in proportion to the 
protein content the effect on the two flours was the 
same. The amount of oleic acid required to produce a

gluten of inferior quality raised the acidity of the flour 
to that characteristic of a deteriorated sample. This 
would indicate that the amount of acidity produced by a 
flour could cause changes in the physical properties of 
the gluten. The results of the effect of fatty acids 
on gluten agree v/ith those of other workers, but the 
effect of stearic acid in ether solution has not been 
reported as far as the writer knows.

effect on the loaf volume of the baked bread. The lower 
volume of the loaves from the flour to which oleic acid 
had been added was probably due to insufficient water 
being added in the mixing of the dough. These loaves 
?/ere equal in all other respects to the bread from the 
controls. Increasing the amount of acids to three times 
the concentration which gave decided effects on the 
gluten had little effect on the baking results and 
greater concentrations of these acids could not normally 
occur in flour, so there was no point in raising them 
further.

It would be expected from the results on the

however, entirely different. In baking the gluten is 
dispersed throughout the starch and other constituents of 
the flour in the dough; when washed the gluten is free 
from most of the constituents of the flour, and under 
these conditions the acids might exert a greater effect 
on it. 

These results indicate that the physical 
properties of gluten may not be a good measure of the 
baking quality of flour. If this is true Kozmin’s (22) 
conclusions on the effect of fatty acids in the aging of 
flour need to be substantiated by baking results before 
they could be accepted as proof that the accumulation 
of unsaturated fatty acids causes the change in quality. 

Artificially Deteriorated Flour . 

The amount of deteriorated flour for experimental 
purposes was very limited so attempts were made to bring 
about rapid deterioration of the fresh samples to provide 
sufficient material for study. Results obtained by other 
workers, and in the present study, indicate that 
deterioration was due mainly to enzymic processes. In¬ 
creasing the moisture content of the flour and storing at 
raised temperatures should therefore hasten the processes 
involved. The moisture content of the flour was raised 
to approximately 20% by placing it over a saturated 
solution of ammonium sulphate in a sealed container.

The flour was then stored in the container at a tempera¬ 
ture of approximately 40°0. Toluene was used to prevent 
the growth of bacteria and moulds. The flour treated in 
this way is referred to in this paper as artificially 
deteriorated flour. 

The results comparing artificially deteriorated 
flour with that stored in sacks are presented in Table 
XVII. The artificially deteriorated flour v/as in general 
comparable to the flour deteriorated under laboratory 
conditions. This was indicated by an increase in 
acidity, a decrease in ether and alcohol-ether extract, 
changes in the physical properties of the gluten and 
the manner in which the gluten dispersed in sodium 
salicylate. The results of baking tests, however, 
showed that it was much lower in quality than even the 
most badly deteriorated flour obtained under the 
storage conditions obtaining in the laboratory. 

The Fallis sample of flour showed a greater 
rate of change in chemical and physical properties than 
did the corresponding Edmonton sample. This agrees with 
the results for these flours stored under laboratory 
conditions. The increase in acidity of the Fallis 
sample, however, was less than that of the Edmonton 
sample which does not agree with the results obtained 
under ordinary storage conditions. This is a further

indication that acidity is not a good measure of the 
stage of deterioration, as has already been mentioned. 

Although the work on artificially deteriorated 
flour was of a preliminary nature it indicates that the 
method might be a valuable aid in measuring the keeping 
properties of a flour• It may also be important in 
studying the changes taking place during storage as these 
could be brought about quickly. It would at least 
obviate the necessity of waiting long periods to obtain 
quantities of deteriorated flour as was the case under 
such conditions of storage as were used for the three 
series of flours discussed in the earlier sections of 
this paper. 

DISCUSSION 


Differences in thd keeping properties of the 
flour from wheat grown on the black and gray soils have 
been definitely established. Associated with the 
differences in keeping properties are the differences in 
rate of change in chemical and physical properties of the 
flour. The rate of change was greatest in the flour 

with the poorest keeping properties, that is, the flour 
showing the most rapid deterioration. There is no 
reason to believe that the type of deterioration occurring

in these flours is any different from that usually 
encountered in prolonged storage experiments. Inherent 
differences in the different varieties of wheat grown 
on the two soils must be responsible for the differences 
in keeping properties of the flour. 

The differences in protein content of the 
flour from Edmonton and Fallis grown wheat has been noted. 
These differences, however, will not account for the 
differences in the keeping properties, as it was shown 
that some flours with high protein content deteriorated 
as rapidly as other flours in which the protein content 
was low. The chemical composition of the proteins of 
different wheats is not likely to be associated with 
quality, as it has never been conclusively shown that 
proteins from widely different wheats vary in compo¬ 
sition. 

There was little difference in the lipoid 
content of the flour from the wheat of different varieties 
grown on various soils. The chemical composition of the 
lipoids was not determined, but differences such as 
color, viscosity and amount of solid material were 
observed. It is possible, therefore, that differences 
in the amount of sterols, phosphatides or other con¬ 
stituents of the lipoids do exist. Evidence that the 
lipoids affect the physical properties of protein has been 
presented. Differences in the lipoids might cause the 
differences in the rate of change in the physical

properties of gluten occurring during storage. 

Investigations by other workers on the rancidity 
of fats and oils have shown that their keeping properties 
differ markedly. The differences are attributed to 
variations in the amounts of pro- and antioxygenic 
substances or to the amounts of such catalysts as iron 
and copper present in the fats and oils. It has been 
shown that wheat oils differ in their antioxidant 
properties and this may be an important factor in 
determining the rate of flour deterioration, lecithin 
and sterols have also been suggested as antioxidant 
substances and these may influence the changes in 
lipoids of flour. It seems reasonable to assume that 
the different varieties of wheat grown on various soils 
differ in metabolism to the extent that the lipoids 
formed differ as to the ease or rapidity with which they 
decompose. Lipoids which decompose rapidly cause a 
greater rate of change in the physical properties of 
the protein. It also seems probable that differences in 
the amount of metals which act as catalysts might exist 
as a result of differences in nutritional conditions. 

The results of the experiments discussed in 
this paper largely support the general idea of Working’s 
theory (36), although the nature of the lipoid involved 
has not been determined. He believes that phosphatides 
are the important constituents in flour aging. The

dispersion of such phosphatides is increased by changes 
in their solubility in water due to slight oxidation, and 
their destruction is caused by excessive oxidation. As 
evidence that oxidation is important in flour aging he 
reports that flours bleached with oxidizing agents 
deteriorated more rapidly than unbleached flours. 

It seems probable that changes in the lipoid 
protein complex are important in determining the changes 
which occur in flour during storage. Improvement in 
flour quality may be due to slight changes in the 
lipoids brought about in the early stages of oxidation 

while deterioration may be due to more excessive 
oxidation or hydrolytic processes. Such a theory will 

explain most of the results obtained in the various 
experiments reported in this paper and also aids in the 
reconciliation of seemingly contradictory results. 

Results on the extraction of flour by various 
solvents showed that ether, which removes only the free 
or loosely combined lipoids, had little effect on the 
physical properties of the proteins. Hot alcohol, which 
removes the closely adsorbed lipoids, changes the 
physical properties of the gluten proteins. As further 
evidence that the lipoids in the complex are important, 
the addition of lipoids to flour does not affect the 
rate of deterioration. If free lipoids were important, 
their removal by ether or their addition to flour should

affect deterioration but no evidence for this Y/as obtained. 

Kozmin's claim (22) that the accumulation of 
the unsaturated fatty acids is the cause of the marked 
change in flour quality is contradictory to the above 
theory, but it has already been shown that the fatty 
acids affect the gluten properties, but do not affect 
the baking results. It was also shown that the 
saturated stearic acid if added to flour in solution 
rather than in the solid form caused marked changes in 
the gluten properties, but the effect v/as not noticeable 
in the baking results. Evidence has also been presented 
to show that the acidity of the flour is not an accurate 

measure of the degree of deterioration. It seems far 
more likely that the acidity is merely an accompanying 
effect and that the breakdown of the lipoids is the 
causal agent in deterioration. 

There is no agreement among the various workers 
as to whether fatty acids arise by oxidation or hydro¬ 
lytic processes. Kozmin states rather definitely that 
oxidation is not important in the process. She claims 
that oxidizing agents have no effect on the lipoids as 
ether extracted flours and untreated flours reacted to 
them in the same way. It has already been pointed out 
that the ether soluble constituents have little effect 
on the physical properties of the proteins, thus it 
does not seem that her conclusions are valid. It has

already been pointed out that the assumption that ether 
extracts all the lipoids leads to incorrect conclusions 
regarding the importance of lipoids in flour. 

The evidence presented in the various experi¬ 
ments agrees with the lipoid-protein complex theory. 

It also gives a reasonable explanation for the 
differences in the keeping properties of the flours 
studied. It was unfortunate that the small amount of 
material limited the experiments which could be carried 
out with the flours from Edmonton and Fallis grown 
wheat. These experiments are being continued with a 
view to obtaining evidence of the validity of this 
theory. 

SUMMARY OF RESULTS 


Differences in the keeping properties of flour 
from different varieties of wheat grown on the two soils 
were established. 

Titrable acidity and hydrogen ion concentration 
of the flours increased with the time of storage. 

The lipoid content of the flours decreased 
during storage. 

The solubility in sodium salicylate of the 
gluten from a deteriorated flour is much lower than that 
of the gluten from a non-deteriorated flour, and addition 
of lipoids increased the solubility.

The addition of fatty acids to a flour affects 
the physical properties of the gluten, but has no apparent 
effect on the baking properties of the flour. 

The addition of wheat germ to flour increases 
neither the rate of deterioration nor the rate of increase 
in acidity. 

Lipoids of the germ or the free or loosely 
combined lipoids of the flour have little effect on the 
baking quality.
