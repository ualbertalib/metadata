THE PHILOoOPHY OF SAMUEL BUTLER 


ABSTRACT 

Samuel Butler, in reaction to his conventional up¬ 
bringing in a clerical household in Victorian times, attacked 
the religion, art, education, ethics, family life and biology 
of his day. Rejecting orthodox Christianity and the natural 
selection of Darwinism, Butler sets forth his religion, a 
pragmatic, empirical philosophy of creative evolution, based 
on the Lamarckian view that variation is directed by in¬ 
telligent sense of need with continued personality and memory. 
All organisms have a degree of consciousness, memory and will. 
If they try to develop an eye or an innate ability to skate, 
they can eventually succeed, one generation passing on to 
another a residue of organic modification or unconscious 
memory which gradually accumulates until it produces the 
organ or instinct required. All creatures are part of the 
living God, the inherent will or intelligence of the universe. 
Butler combines will with instinct, habit with organic func¬ 
tion, mind with adaptation to environment so that intelligence 
may take over evolution and dedicate it to rational, moral 
and social ends. This religion of the will or Life Force 
limits reason and emphasizes instinctive living, and freedom 
from social evil for the successful continuance of the 


race

CHAPTER ONE 


INTRODUCTION. 


As I read tributes to the late George Bernard Shaw, 

I could not help recalling the life and work of his precursor, 
Samuel Butler, who influenced Shaw greatly. "It drives one 
almost to despair," Shaw writes, "when one sees so extraordin¬ 
ary a study of English life as Butler’s posthumous Way of all 
Elesh making so little impression that when I produce plays in 
which Butler’s extraordinary fresh, free and future-piercing 

suggestions have an obvious share, I am met with.vague 

cacklings about Ibsen and Neitzche . Really the English 

do not deserve to have great men." 

In his essay, B utler When I Was a Nobody . x Shaw states 
that Butler was a great man, as great men go. Shaw considers 
that Butler put thesecret of his greatness into a single sen¬ 
tence of six words, which he addressed to Shaw as they were 
crossing the courtyard of the British Museum together. He 
said with the most intense emphasis, "Darwin banished mind 
from the universe." He added, "My grandfather quarrelled 
with Darwin’s father; I quarrelled with Darwin; and my regret 
for having no son is that he cannot quarrel with Darwin’s 
son." 

In Shaw’s opinion, Butler should be considered in the 
roll of fame neither as novelist nor biologist but as meta-

biologist. "This," he explains, "is perhaps because I call 
myself a metabiologist and was the first, so far as I know, 
to bring that necessary term into the vocabulary." 

Butler, like Shaw, was a creative evolutionist, a 
man with a purpose to expose the error of Darwinism and to ex¬ 
plain the theory of vitalism, the creative life force existing 
in all things. He is called "an earnest atheist" but in 
reality he was a theist, a believer in a living God, active 
in all beings. 

In considering Butler, one might think that he was 
a "sport", a person apart from his world of evolution, one 
who had made a quick jump instead of a change by gradual 
variation, but on second thought he is seen to be of his age, 
in the middle-class, gentlemanly life. 

Butler wa.s an amateur novelist, evolutionist, phil¬ 
osopher, theologian, painter, musician and worker in Homeric 
and Shakespearean research. To his efforts in these various 
fields he brought freshness, independence and originality of 
thought. He defined his standards and exposed his prejudices. 
At his own expense he published his books on which the loss 
was little short of one thousand pounds. 

Butler wrote as a social satirist, ridiculing the 
follies of contemporary life. He attacked people, their 
laws, conventions and institutions, and as a result told his 
generation many unpalatable truths about itself. He argued 
endlessly, repeated his assertions, and treated his opponents 
as "moral delinquents and damned fools." As a critic of his

period, he showed an abundance of common sense, "with an 
unusually disciplined intelligence." 

His humorous method led to distrust and misunder¬ 
standing of his work. Mr. testing Jones points out in his 
Sketch of the Life of Samuel butler , x that butler, to veil 
his own earnestness, "turned most naturally to humor, employ¬ 
ing it in a spirit of reverence, as all the great humorists 
have done, to express his deepest and most serious convictions." 
His contemporaries did not know whether he was to be taken 
seriously, and therefore found his opinions disconcerting. 

It is then, only, with consideration of humor as an 
integral part of his makeup that we can understand Butler. 

His mind was dual, one with a strain of anti-intelleetualism, 
where he puts limits on reason and logic, and emphasizes com¬ 
promise. 

A feature of Samuel Butler's work is the remarkable 
interdependence of thought shown in everything he wrote. He 
had the gift of seizing the vital connection between seemingly 
unconnected things, showing the material relevance between the 
widely different points of view of thought and life. The 
classics, science, music, painting, philosophy-- all engaged 
his attention; but between these studies he had established 
a real and vital connection. Herein he showed his genius. 

His mind was of such capacity that he could correlate the 
various ideas and aspects of life so that each one of them

illustrated some relevant thought. In his written work, 
we frequently come across the same idea, probably clothed in 
a different form but expressing a certain mental compactness 
seldom found in critical writers. So these thoughts and 
theories constantly recur throughout all his books. In 
Erewhon , for example, we have the germ of all the ideas later 
developed in his other writings. His novel. The Way of All 
Flesh, is a working out in practice of his thories. 

Butler wrote to please himself and a few friends. 

His books pestered and worried him until they got themselves 
written. In all, he wrote twenty-seven books. Of these 
only two are at all known today. One is Erewhon , a brilliant 
satire on Victorian compromise with its timid routine-loving 
passiveness; whether it is shown in its true light, hardly 
disguised by transposition; or whether the picture of a ration¬ 
al civilization is set up over against it. The second survi¬ 
vor, Butler*s only real novel, The Way of All Flesh , is a 
unique period-study of Victorian home life. 

In his own time sutler was an unsuccessful writer, a 
literary pariah. He was not considered worthy of attack. 
Bewildered by the contempt and neglect of people, who, like 
himself were presumably engaged in a search for truth, he 
struck out at Darwin as his chief opponent. Darwin advised 
one of his supporters; "Do not expend much powder and shot 
on Mr. Butler, for he* is really not worth it. His work is 
merely ephemeral." 

Time, however, hias avenged the neglect of Butler by 
his contemporaries. Even before his death the idea of uncon-

scious memory was accepted by orthodox biologists. He is 
now considered one of the most remarkable English writers of 
the latter part of the 19th. century. Illustrating the 
changed attitude of the scientific world to Butler and his 
theories is a reference in Darwin and Modern Science , a 
collection of essays published in 1909 by the University of 
Cambridge, in commemoration of the Darwin centenary. In 
that work Professor Bateson speaks of Butler as "the most 
brilliant and by far the most interesting of Darwin’s oppon¬ 
ents, whose works are at length emerging from oblivion." 

Today he may be considered as "a mid-Victorian modern", in 
that he advocates Lamarckism, pragmatism, Bergsonism. 

In these days of specialization, it is refreshing 
to dwell upon the varied accomplishments of such a truly 
rounded intelligence. The dignity of the human intelli¬ 
gence was one of the lessons he tried to teach. ten’s will 
and his intellect are the strongest things in the universe. 
Butler often repeated his belief that everyone, according to 
the measure of his worth, will achieve a new lifte after death 
in the thoughts and lives of others. We see, then, that 

his life beyond the grave is his truest and happiest, passed 
in the profoundest sleep and yet immortal in the thoughts and 
life of George Bernard Shaw and others yet unborn — in his 
own words "those who have been begotten of our work and who 

have for the time come up in our room." "He lives who does 
and he who does still lives, whether he wots of his own deeds 
or not ..." x

CHAPTER TWO 

THE MAN AND HIS WORK 

Samuel Butler was born in Nottinghamshire on 
December 4th., 1835. His father was a clergyman, Rev. Thomas 
Butler; his grandfather was the famous Dr. Samuel Butler, head¬ 
master of Shrewsbury School and later Bishop of Lichfield. 

When eight years old, the young Butler travelled with his 
family to Italy, which he henceforth referred to as his 
IT second country.” 

Two years later he attended school at Allesiey near 
Coventry; and then in 1848 went to Shrewsbury School, whose 
headmaster Dr. B. H. Kennedy he reproduced as Dr. Skinner in 
his autobiographical novel The Way of All Flesh . At this 
period he first heard the music of Handel, who remained his 
favorite composer. Italy, Handel, and a fondness for draw¬ 
ing became the loves of his life. 

In 1854 Butler went to St. John's College, Cambridge, 
where he took his degree in classics, being twelfth in the 
First Class of the Classical Tripos in 1858. Writing for 
the Eagle, his college magazine, he produced sketches which 
showed the early development of that gift of irony which 
Butler was afterwards to wield with such brilliant mastery. 

Interested in the evangelical teaching of the Cambridge 
Simeonites, he was stimulated to write an amusing parody on 
one of their tracts. Like Ernest Pontifex in The Way of All

Flesh , who came under this religious influence, he dropped 
a copy of his tract into the Simeonites’ letter-boxes as a 
counter-attack to their uncouth utterances* 

Other articles at this time foreshadow the quality 
of his later work and the necessity for his writing. He 

remarks concerning his subjects: "Unless we have something 
which we feel urged to say, it is better to say nothing." 

Destined for the Church, Butler went to London where 
he lived and worked among the poor in a West End parish. His 
father, Dr. Butler, a Church of England canon, was outraged 
when the young man refused ordination on the grounds that 
infant baptism was ineffectual. The canon then ordered 
his son to become either a schoolmaster or a barrister* In¬ 
stead Butler, who wished to be an artist, set sail for New 
Zealand in 1859; and, helped by money from his father, be¬ 
came a prosperous sheep-rancher at Canterbury. 

His letters home were put together by his father 
and brought out in his first book, A First Year at Canterbury 
Settlement . The book gives a good picture of the kind of 
life Butler led for five years, working "like a common ser¬ 
vant" in semi-solitude, devoting all his attention to sheep 
and "country". x To Butler, as to all other serious emi¬ 
grants, sheep were the only things that mattered. "You must 
remember they are your masters, and not you theirs; you exist 
for them, not they for you." They were, as he might have 
put it later, extensions, and most important ones, of his own

personality. 251 

While Butler was in New Zealand, he read Charles 
Darwin’s Origin of Species and became Darwin’s ardent admirer. 
In 1862 he wrote a dialogue upon the Origin of Species , pub¬ 
lished in the New Zealand Press. This he followed by a let¬ 
ter in the same newspaper on Darwin and the Machines , which 
developed into his theory of evolution and became part of 
his book, Frewhon , published in 1872. 

But Butler had no intention of spending his life as 
a sheep-rancher; and after five years he sold out for a sum 
which would likely yield him sufficient income for the rest 
of his life. 

When he returned to London, he took rooms in 
Clifford’s Inn where he remained until his death in 1902, liv¬ 
ing on the income from his money invested in securities. Un¬ 
fortunate speculation in these brought about a visit to Canada 
in retrieve some losses, and caused him to live in somewhat 
straitened circumstances for years, but he managed to visit 
his beloved Italy each summer for a holiday. 

Upon his return to England from New Zealand in 1864, 
Butler’s ambition to become a painter led him to study art 
seriously. From 1868 to 1876 he was an occasional exhibitor 
at the Royal Academy. At Heatherley’s School of Art he met 
Miss Eliza Mary Ann Savage, whom he pictures in his sonnets

in 1901 as "plain and lame and fat and short, Forty and over- 
kind" ...., yet who remained his stimulating and devoted 
friend until her death in 1385. 

Spurred to creativeness by a Russian lady whom he met 
in Venice in 1866, who left him with the words: "Et maintanant, 
monsieur, vous allez creer", Butler turned from painting to 
literature and published Erewhon in 1872. This successful 
satire, first published anonymously, persuaded him towards 
regular book-writing. In 1873 he brought out T he Fair Haven , 
in which he cleared his doubts about the evidence for the 
Resurrection. No sooner was this done than, encouraged by 
his faithful friend. Miss Savage, he set to work on the first 
draft of The Way of All Flesh . 

Painting still occupied his first attention until 
1876 when he exhibited his last Royal Academy picture, and from 
that point he turned decisively toward writing. He published 
his first book on creative evolution, Life and Habit , in 1877, 
and followed this with Evol ution Old and New in 1879, Uncon¬ 
scious Memory in 1880, and Lu ck or Punning ? in 1886. 

In 1881 Butler brought out Alps and Sanctuaries con¬ 
taining material gathered during his Italian holidays and 
illustrated with photographs by the author himself. In this 
book he reveals his love of Italy and of primitive Italian 
art. Thereafter he worked again over the manuscript of his 
novel, rewriting much of it; but presently he laid it aside, 
having made up his mind against publication while many of the 
real people characterized in it were still alive. Hence-

forward the t9xt remained as he had left it and was published 
in 1903, a year after his death. 

In 1885 Butler and his close friend, Henry Festing 
Jones, published an album of music, and in 1888 Narcissus , an 
Oratorio Buffo in the Handelian manner. 

Upon the death of his father in 1886 Butler received 
sufficient inheritance to end his financial difficulties. 

Bince his New Zealand days, he had been supporting not only 
himself but also a beloved friend, Charles Paine Pauli, whom 
Butler considered an "ideal gentleman". Though now considerably 
richer, Butler continued to live simply at Clifford f s Inn. Each 
day he walked to the British Museum Heading .Room where he did 
his writing. In the essay Q, uis Desiderio ...? he gives a hum¬ 
orous account of his dismay at the removal from its accustomed 
place of Frost’s Lives of Eminent Christians , the one book in¬ 
dispensable to him as a sloping desk for writing. 

Though Butler did not assume the responsibilities of 
marriage and family life, he fulfilled his biological needs 
through the attentions of a French mistress, Madame Lucie 
Dumas, whom he visited each fortnight until her death. For 
fifteen of those twenty years he was sufficiently cautious 
not to reveal to her his true identity. 

In 1888 -Butler published Ex Yota , a work which con¬ 
cerns Yarallo statuary and the art of his favorite sculptor, 
Tabachetti. While collaborating with Mr. Jones, on the 
oratoria Ulysses , Butler became so interested in the work of 
Homer that he translated both the Iliad and Odyssey into modern 
English prose, and astounded classical scholars by setting out

to prove that the Odyssey had been composed at Trapani, in 
Sicily, by a lively young woman, Nausicaa. 

Thile writing a book on the elucidation of Shakes¬ 
peare’s sonnets, Butler learned the series by heart and com¬ 
posed several in the Shakespearean form on the subjects of 
Handel and Miss Savage. His unusual poem Psalm of Montreal 
with refrain "0 (Sod 7 0 Montreal I” is the one contribution 

by him best remembered by certain readers,. 

In spite of the dislike he had already displayed 
for the callings of church and school, he produced in 1896 
a laudatory life of his grandfather, Dr. Samuel Butler, who 
had been first a headmaster and then a bishop. As Mr. Jones 
says, T7 he became penetrated with an almost Chineste reverence 
for his ancestor' 7 , and the result was a very full account of 
his activities given for the most part in letters, diaries 
and personal notes, 

Butler died In England on June 13, 1902, having been 
brought back ill from Italy by his clerk, Alfred Emery Cathie, 
TT the best body-guard and the. most engaging of any man in 
London’ 7 , in Butler 7 s description. 

Reprints of certain articles from, the Tiniyersal Review 
together with two lectures were printed as Essays of Life, Art 
and Science in 1904, and reprinted with - The Humor of Homer 
in 1913. These essays show Butler 7 s humor free and unre¬ 
strained. There is a light-hearted irony in them and a 
freshness which he never surpassed. The personal element 
shines through unmistakably in each of them. 

At his death in 1902 Butler left five bound volumes

of notes with the contents dated and indexed and more than 
enough sheets for a sixth volume. These were intended for 
his own private use as a quarry from which to take material 
for his writing, hut he hardly ever used them in this way, 
as he usually restated a note from memory in his hooks. How¬ 
ever the making of the notes must have had an influence on the 
formation of his style. Extracts from the volumes of notes 
have been arranged and edited hy Henry Festing Jones and 
printed and reissued several times since. 

In his lifetime the public knew him as "Erewhon” 
Butler, a curious, cranky critic who had produced a strangely 
mixed collection of books. He had offended theologians by 
his denial of the fact of Christ’s death upon the Cross; he 
had offended the scientists by denial of the doctrine of 
evolution by natural selection, and by support of Lamarckism, 
He had affronted classicists by his translation of the Iliad 
and Odyssey into breezy English, and by his contention that 
the n Homer ,T of the Odyssey was the pseudonym of an unknown 
Sicilian woman. He had ventured to uphold Handel as fore¬ 
most musician, and Tabachetti as the finest artist. In 
short, in the opinion of many Victorians, Butler was a dabbler 
in many arts and sciences and no authority upon any.

CHAPTER THREE 

SOCIAL AND MORAL PHILOSOPHY 

I have considered'at some length the ideas found 
in the book Erewhon since they show the trend of social and 
psychological thought developed by Samuel Butler during a 
ten-year period while he has gathering material for the 
book, and since these ideas give in embryo his biological 
theories. 

Erewhon is the story of an imaginary journey to 
an unknown isolated country "Nowhere", and in it Butler has 
satirized the customs of Victorian England. While pictur¬ 
ing Erewhonian socity Butler is actually measuring the in¬ 
stitutions of the Victorians by his standard of common sense. 
He steadily keeps his eyes on the English community that he 
is satirizing. 

The journey and description of the country in the 
opening chapters came from the author's own experiences in 
Hew Zealand. They form/ a realistic setting for the ideas 
to follow, for Erewhon is not really a story, but a series 
of humorously expressed moral and social judgments with a 
story built round them. 

Butler's imagination worked to construct a frame¬ 
work for his satires on materialist science, musical bank 
religion, and family life. It is a notable fact that these 







14 


three things were the main substance of what Butler already 
wanted to say at this stage, From the Book of the Machines 
stemmed all his later views on evolution; from the Musical 
Banks came his attacks on false religion and from the World 
of the Unborn is derived the handling of the problem of 
parenthood in The Way of All Flesh . 

H. F. Jones calls his memoir, Samuel Butler , Author 
of Erewhon , and the Victorian public knew him as Er ewhon 
Butler. There is much more justice in the description than 
at first appears, for in Erewhon almost all that was charac¬ 
teristic of Butler is found in embryo or fully developed. 

The impulse that drove him to find expression in art is 
suggested in a few pages of admirable description. The main 

body of his social criticism is to be found there. His 

early comment upon the Darwinian theory of evolution has its 
place. His criticism of religion finds a voice. There is 
even a suggestion of his love of music in the Handel motif 
of the guardian statues. And above all there is a work of 
satire and imagination in which Butler definitely emerges as 
the satirist of his time. 

Erewhon is a brilliant fantasy about a world in which 
sickness is treated as a crime and crime as a sickness, as is 
coming to be the case today; and civilization rests upon two 
banks, one financial, which men invest in but deprecate, the 
other religious, which they praise to High Heaven but seldom 
invest in. Machines instead of being worshipped as the source 











15 


from which all blessings flow were execrated and forbidden. 

Srewhon was Victorian England back to front; and the result 
was very amusing. 

Butler allowed the original objects of his satire 
to lead him to his conclusions rather than any haphazard 
method. It was the meaning and application contained in 
the jSrewhonian ethics and institutions that were his first 
concern. His book is paradoxical, for it was Butler’s de¬ 
light to turn things inside out or upside down, and to examine 
them from a new point of view, which although absurd, threw 
new light on problems of real life. 

Butler, brought up in a clerical household, in many 
respects remained of a clerical mind; therefore it was natural 
for him to make his bourgeois hero a clerical man. The hero 
supposes that the srewhonians, partly because of their lack 
of religion, are the lost ten tribes of Israel, and he re¬ 
solves to convert them. In this he had already had some ex¬ 
perience, having reclaimed an old native chief, Chowbok, who 
in spite of a confusion of the individuality of Adelaide 
the Q,ueen Dowager with that of Mary Magdalene was partly on 
the way to being ”a sincere Christian”. 

Mr. Higgs, the hero of Erewhon . represents the middle 
class Englishman with his opinions of piety, respectability, 
and Christianity. His pious inclinations are mocked as he is 
trying to convert Chowbok. ”He was indeed stony ground”, 
Higgs remarks, ”but by digging about him I might have at any

16 


rate deprived him of all faith in the religion of his tribe, 
which would have been halfway towards making him a sincere 
Christian. 

Higgs is impressed by the appearance of the Ere- 
whonians, and admires their genial manners and social grace. 
Butler pictures them somewhat as the Italian peasant people 
whom he had met on his journeys to Italy. 

Throughout his writings, Butler stresses the good 
life as the instinctive life of good breeding, good taste, 
good manners, the importance of social graces, the life of 
his ideal gentleman. In one of his notes he states that 
the Swell, the ideal gentleman, is not sufficiently appre¬ 
ciated. Butler wrote: "People ask complainingly what swells 

have done . The good swell is the creature towards ?/hich 

all nature has been groaning and travailing together until now. 
He is an ideal. He shows what may be done in the way of good 
breeding, health, looks, temper and fortune." 

In Erewhon Butler emphasizes the analogy between 
crime and disease. With his happy faculty of turning ideas 
upside down, Butler inverts body and jpind, crime and disease. 
Illness is treated as a crime, and punished according to the 
severity of the illness. On the other hand, crimes are 
treated as diseases and looked after as are illnesses with 
us. A man who has committed a crime is carefully tended 
as suffering from a fit of immorality. Bad conduct is held 


to be the result of pre-natal or post-natal misfortune. The

strange part of the story, however, is that though the 
Erewhonians ascribe moral defects to the effect of misfortune 
either in character or surroundings, they will not listen to 
the plea of misfortune in cases that in England meet with 
sympathy and commiseration only. Just as our courts will 
punish a culprit, that diseased person, without inquiring 
into the degree of his responsibility in his crime, those of 
the Erewhonians will punish a patient, that guilty person, 
without inquiring into the degree of his responsibility for 
his illness. The latter absurdity is no other than our 
own; and to such as have eyes to see, it is pregnant with a 
profitable lesson* 

Butler gives an account of a man who was accused 
of consumption. In the record of the trial, the judge in 
his summing up states: "You may say that it is not your 
fault. The answer is ready enough at hand, and it amounts 
to this - that if you had been born of healthy and well-to-do 
parents, and been well taken care of when you were a child, 
you would never have offended against the laws of your coun¬ 
try, nor found yourself in your present disgraceful position* 
If you tell me that you had no hand in your parentage and 
education, and that it is therefore unjust to lay these 
things to your charge, I answer that whether your being in 
a consumption is your fault or no, it is a fault in you, and 
that it is my duty to see that against such faults as this 
the commonwealth shall be protected. You may say that it

is :your misfortune to be criminal; I answer that it is 
your crime to be unfortunate." x 

Ill-luck of any kind, or even ill-treatment at the 
hands of others, is considered an offence against society, 
inasmuch as it makes people uncomfortable to hear of it. 

Loss of fortune, therefore, or loss of some dear friend, is 
punished hardly less severely than physical delinquency. 

No one with any sense of self-respect will place himself on 
an equality in the matter of affection with those who are 
less lucky than himself in birth, health, money, good looks, 
capacity or anything else. 

The sojourn of Mr. Higgs at the home of the Nos- 
nibors provides Butler with a setting for his satire on 
morality and family life. Mr. Nosnibor is made a swindler 
who has tricked a confiding widow out of her property. He 
is treated with commiseration for his lapse from virtue, 
and so illustrates the contrast between Erewhonian and Vic¬ 
torian notions of physical and moral health* 

By this clever satire Butler subjects prevailing 
ideas on treatment of criminals to ridicule, and questions 
the right of society to inflict punishment; but while on one 
side this right is curtailed, on the other it is extended. 
For the treatment of cases that are with us criminal, the 
Erewhonians call in "straighteners" who prescribe for all 

these forms of mental indisposition.

The touch in Erewhon is light, hut on the questions 
of moral and physical health much of Butler’s Erewhonian 
philosophy is remarkably prescient* We recognize the value 
to a country of well-to-do healthy citizens, and we are be¬ 
ginning to treat the criminal less barbarously and more humanely 
as mentally diseased. 

Regarding vice and virtue the Erewhonians "hold that 
unalloyed virtue is not a thing to be immoderately indulged in. 
The straighteners say that the most that can be truly said for 
virtue is that there is a considerable balance in its favor, 
and that it is on the whole a good deal better to be on its 
side than against it. Those men, they say, are best who 
are not remarkable either for vice or virtue.. nX 

Butler does not dwell at length on the social problem. 
The relations between class and class, or betv^een master and 
man were not questions with which his mind was in any way con¬ 
cerned. This greatest and most acute critic of mid-Victorian 
morality has not a word to say about such things as these. 

Apart from a few scenes of "low life ?T , seen as a thing vitally 
different from the life he depicted, Butler’s scenes and 
characters were all of the middle class, and took middle class 
ways of living for granted. 

In another passage Butler points out that there is 
nothing unfair in punishing people for misfortune. here it 
is society which must profit at the expense of the individual. 
That is the reason why a man who is son to a millionaire is so

richly rewarded - he is the most complex phenomenon so far 
produced, and society has every reason to be proud of him. 

But it is all luck and nothing else and simply the old story: 
"To him that hath shall be given." And in believing, as 
Butler believed, that God cared not much for the individual 
but a good deal for the race, he put this element of good 
fortune on a new footing; society rewards good fortune - 
good looks, physical well-being, a good bank balance, whether 
the result of our .own efforts or not - because they are of 
value to society. In a man who possesses all these things 
society sees its own ideal. "Property, marriage, the law; 
as the bed to the river, so rule and convention to the in¬ 
stinct; and woe to him who tampers with the banks while the 
flood is flowing." x 

Butler satirizes conventions concerning death with 
his story of the Erewhonian custom, of marking condolence. 

On the death of a friend of the family, the mourners write 
no letters of sympathy nor wear mourning, but they send 
little boxes of artificial tears, the number varying accord¬ 
ing to the degree of intimacy. 

The Erewhonians are not less human than other people, 
and hence condone certain offences in an illogical fashion. 
"Want of logic is a merciful provision of nature, a buffer 
against collisions, a friction which upsets our calculations 
but without which existence would be intolerable, this crown¬ 
ing glory of human invention whereby we can be blind and see

at one and the same moment - this blessed inconsistency 
exists here as elsewhere. T,x ‘The birth of a child is thus 
condoned. The illness of the mother is carefully concealed, 
and the offence after a time forgotten. Some stricter 
moralists maintained that it was wicked for a woman to have 
children at all, since her health was impaired in the process; 
these writers could not see that the good which came out of 
the evil was any moral justification. Yet the necessity of 
the ease caused the passing over of such events in silence. 

Butler uses the Musical Banks as a neat allegory 
to satirize conventional religion and church-going morality, 
and with them a great deal of the Victorian piety and re¬ 
spectability against which he revolted. He attacks the 
family life of the Victorians based on Ydgrun (Mrs. Grundy), 
the religion of respectability. 

The Erewhonians had two currencies, one used in 
the Musical Banks of no direct commercial value, the other 
that with which business was done and in which the managers 
and cashiers of the Musical Banks were paid. Mrs. Nosnibor, 
a prominent Erewhonian citizen, who supported the Musical 
Banks, represents the typical pious woman that would argue on 
the necessity of going to church for the sake of conformity 
and respectability, not because of belief. 

In describing the unhappy, cramped expression of the 
cashiers, Butler draws freely from his knowledge of the life 
of the clergy; their suppressed lives with repression of doubt.

their impossible ideal of morals, their unsuccessful train¬ 
ing of their children, the giving out of their energy and 
service to others with their inevitable, irritable reaction 
at home. 

The description of the changes and additions to the 
Musical Banks, of the stained glass windows, of the enlarged 
organs is indicative of the reforms of the Broad Church groups 
in England. Butler is satirizing the Church’s attempt to draw 
in congregations by dressing up the building. Reference to 
the bendable currency suggests the adjustable religious 
standards of the Victorians. 

The author is maintaining that the Erewhonians by 
supporting their religious views have to pay their respects 
to custom. He objects to our priests saying that they know 
more about the unseen world. Butler believes, like Huxley, 
though in different fashion, that the unknown world is unknown. 

In later passages Butler goes on to consider the quasi- 
iaolatrous views held, a belief in anthropomorphic religion, 
that in which men tend to turn abstractions such as justice, 
fear, love into gods by.giving them personalities in their own 
minds. Mr. Higgs, a pious, earnest man tries to convince 
Arowhena that she is wrong in believing that justice is a 
living person. 

When Arowhena gives her view of Higgs’ God, Butler 
is here turning back on his own idea. "She asked me what I 
should think if she were to tell me that my God, whose nature 
and attributes I had been explaining to her, was but the ex-

pression for man’s highest conception of goodness, wisdom and 
power; that in order to generate a more vivid conception of so 
glorious a thought man had personified it and called it by a 
name; that it was an unworthy conception of the Deity to hold 
him personal, inasmuch as escape from human contingencies be¬ 
came thus impossible; that the real thing men should worship 
was the Divine whereinsoever they could find it; that God was 
but man f s way of expressing his sense of the Divine. T ’ x 

To this conception Higgs answers that there wer9 
authentic accounts of men who had been spoken to by the Deity 
himself, and of one prophet who had been allowed to see the 
back parts of God through the hand that was laid over his face* 
Butler is here using Higgs as a representative of the obtuse 
person of his day. 

The true object of worship of the Erewhonians was 
Ydgrun. Their real religion was their adherence to custom, 
their conformity to their code of respectability. In dis¬ 
cussing high and low Ydgrunites Butler is satirizing the 
double standard of behavior. He approves adherence to the 
proper standard, that of the. high Ydgrunites. "The example 
of a real gentleman is the best of all gospels. " x The only 
religion of the high Ydgrunites was that of self-respect and 
consideration for others. They represent Butler’s ideal of 
behavior to which he lived up in his personal doings except 
as a writer. The high Ydgrunites are the free self-possessed

persons whom Butler admired. They conform to custom and 
only break away when instinct tells them it is best to do so. 

Butler dismisses the idea of immortality or future 
heaven or hell as necessary to morals. He attacks the 
suggestion of the fear of hell as essential to the moral 
cade. Most Erewhonians oppose immortality as immoral in that 
it makes the present life of second importance and is ff an im¬ 
patient cutting of the G-ordian knot of life f s problems." 

The chapter on Birth formulae is a satire on family 
life in general, attacking the orthodox doctrine of original 
sin. It was this latter question that caused Butler T s refusal 
to be ordained and his decision not to become a clergyman. 

He is satirizing the folly of infant baptism and confirmation. 

In the chapter on the World of the Unborn we learn 
that the Erewhonians reverse the process of time saying that we 
are drawn through life backwards with our faces to the past in¬ 
stead of to the future; that the future and the past are as a 
panorama upon two rollers; that the present is one of the 
minor compromises of which human life is full - for it lives 
only on sufferance of the past and future. In picturing the 
world of the unborn Butler is satirizing the Victorian concept 
of heaven. Everybody is happy in that world yet clamoring to 
get out. Though warned by their elders, the spiritual pas¬ 
tors of the unborn world, to consider the risks they will 
assume, the most foolish of them agree to the uncertain condi¬ 
tions which they must accept. When they have decided to leave, 
they must go before the magistrate, sign an affidavit, take a

potion which will destroy their memory and sense of identity, 
and become a bare vital principle to harass two married persons 
until they get themselves born. 

Butler in this inversion is satirizing the attitude 
of parents to children that the latter owe their parents a 
debt for having been born, as he presents the idea that the 
children tormented their parents till they were born. The 
author, too, is insisting upon the continuity of life from 
ancestors beyond that of the particular individual. 

Yet though they rather dislike the children, the 
Srewhonians as potential parents, are willing to give them 
the best chance possible by maintaining their own physical 
fitness - as indeed they are bound to do by the laws of their 
land* 

Butler considers the question of money as one great 
problem between parents and children. He emphasizes, as does 
his disciple Shaw, that money is necessary to stimulate living. 
He considers that there is a good deal to be said for money. 

The poor cannot afford to be moral, for they have t& live. 

In Butler T s opinion a child is not a satellite of his parents 
b.ut a definite personality. He considers it wrong to keep 
children subject by "will-shaking" at them. 

To Butler it is a prime error for parents to insist 
on their children studying "hypothetics", which is gcod for 
nothing. The child should be given an early apprenticeship 
in the art of living, a practical education whereby he is to 
earn money, and some choice in the way of making money.

The ideas of Butler on the Colleges of Unreason 
and hypothetics are drawn from his experiences at Shrewsbury 
and Cambridge. He expresses straight criticism of a classical 
education, but mingles paradox with his own opinions. He is 
not merely condemning Unreason but is also arguing on the 
question of logic versus instinct. It is not wise to push 
logic too far. With everything we must include its opposite, 
logic and illogic, reason and unreason. "Extremes are alone 
logical, but they are always absurd; the mean is illogical, 
but an illogical mean is. better than the sheer absurdity of 
an extreme." 

Life is a compromise in which common sense counts, 
for it knows how'to balance reason with unreason. The in¬ 
stinct within, the power of common sense, pushes one in the 
right direction. As part of the continuing life force, it 
preserves the balance between. This is Butler's philosophy 
of common sense. He juggles with the idea of reason as he 
did with that of God. 

In the words of the Professor of Worldly Wisdom, he 
argues for the avoidance of extremes in originality of thought 
and in progress. What society wants to do is to fit the in¬ 
dividual into society. A great man has to sacrifice himself, 
his genius and his originality, for it is as immoral to be too 
far in front of one’s own age as to lag too far behind it. 

This thought accords with the idea of the continuity of the 
life force, in that, for progress, one individual cannot get 
too far ahead or he will be out of line.

The Book of the nuachines was expanded from an earlier 
essay, Darwin and the Machines , It is an analogy with human 
machines, but seems an onslaught upon the false use of analogy. 
Butler had a deep distrust of analogical argument, though he 
sometimes fell into it. He was fully convinced that the notion 
of human beings or living beings being just like ma.chines was 
all wrong; and he took his usual course with every falsehood he 
came upon. He turned it back to front or upside down, and saw 
what it looked like reversed. How about seeing what would 
follow if one affirmed that machines were just like men? 

Butler tried it and found that it worked perfectly - to a con¬ 
clusion just as absurdly logical as if one began the other 
way round. Whether they were meant humorously or not, these 
chapters on the tyranny of the machine ware strangely prescient 
of the terrible dilemma of the twentieth centry, as mankind ex¬ 
periences it in the horrors of war. 

The second view of the machines, that held by Butler 
himself, was expanded from the article Lucubratio Ebria already 
published. The chief point is that the machines are tools, 
further limbs of the human body. A spade, for instance, 
lengthens the forearm and makes the hand a joint. Mind and 
matter ultimately become one in the unity of existence. "That 
old philosophic enemy, matter, the inherently and essentially 
evil, still hangs about the neck of the poor and strangles him: 
but to the rich, matter is immaterial; the elaborate organization 
of his extra-corporeal system has freed his soul. TfX Thus 
millionaires are the most highly organized creatures in our 
society, since they can at will add to their identity a special

train or ship and go where and when they please. 

The account of the Rights of Animals and of Vegetables 
serves as a lesson that it is unwise to push on to logical con¬ 
clusions except with the purpose of recoiling from them as But¬ 
ler represented the Srewhonians to have done, when, after giv¬ 
ing up meat eating, they came to realize that no sharp line 
could be drawn between the lives of plants and animals. The 
moral is that the illogical is preferable to the absurd. With 
the story of the conscience-stricken young man eating meat, 
Butler satirizes the teachings on sex; the suppression of 
natural instincts is unhealthy for it produces hypocrisy. 

Butler emphasizes his views concerning evolution. 

Life is a product of intelligence, conscious or unconscious. 
There is purpose in all life, even that of a potato. Both 
animals and plants have a common ancestry, and no appreciable 
difference in their germ cells. A germ develops into an or¬ 
ganism similar to that of its ancestors, or dies in the attempt 
to fit itself to widely different circumstances. Butler 
stresses the intelligence of the organism, whereas Charles 
Darwin leaves no room for intelligence, making adaptation of 
the organism a matter of chance. 

Butler sets forth an account of the laws, opinions 
and behavior of the Erenkionians. In so doing he has em¬ 
phasized; their extensive use of logical theory so often a 
failure in practice; the inconsistencies which they condoned; 
their panic fear of giving themselves away; their views on 
money and machines; their foolish study of hypothetics; their 



29 


double currency and the conduct of the Ydgrunites. All of 
these ideas have wide application to phases of Victorian life. 
The main satire in Erewhon, however, has to do with Butler’s 
conception of life - his great theory of creative purposeful 
evolution of the unending life stream, from the primordial cell 
to man, of all life as one, perpetuated by an unconscious 
memory that embraces an urge to change. This hypothesis, 
fully developed in his four boohs on evolution, is discussed 
in the next chapter.

CHAPTER four 

CREATIVE EVOLUTION 

'^hs Origin of Species by Charles Darwin appeared in 
1359, the year after Butler had taken his degree at Cambridge. 
Son of a clergyman, grandson of a bishop, and himself brought 
up to be a clergyman, Butler was to feel as sharply as any man 
the impact of the new wave of religious doubt that Darwin*s 
book set in motion; and to him, as to many others, this one 
issue for a long time seemed to overshadow every other. 

According to Ceorge Bernard Shaw, Darwin had con¬ 
verted Butler for six weeks, because "in those days we clever 
people who called ourselves Secularists, Freethinkers, Agnos¬ 
tics, Atheists, Positivists, Rationalists, or what not, and 
were classed by the Orthodox as Infidels doomed to eternal 
damnation, were Anti-Clericals snatching at any stick big 
enough to whack the parsons; and as the biggest stick then 
was the Natural Selection of Darwin and Wallace, carried to 
absurdity by Weismann, we all, Butler included, grabbed it and 
laid on joyously. Butler alone thought it out deeply and 
quickly enough to grasp the horror of its banishment of mind 
from the universe. The ensuing controversies only obscured 
the fundamental issue. t?x

Samuel .butler always disliked strongly the idea of a 
mechanically determined universe; and the Darwinian doctrine of 
natural selection alienated his sympathy because it seemed to 
make an end of free will as the director of universal affairs. 

He was unhappy until he had rediscovered a form of the doctrine 
of evolution that put will or cunning, rather than luck, in the 
key place. 

In The Way of All Flesh and in Spew lion the influence 
of Darwin’s theory is plain. In Erewhon, Butler is puzzled, 
not having yet hit on the notion of creative evolution which he 
proclaimed in Life and Habit . In The Say of All Flesh , the 
notions of inherited habit and variation by means of willed 
adaptation to environment are invoked again and again - though 
probably many of these passages belong to the revised version. 
Between Erewhon and the revised version of The Tay of All Blesh 
Butler had made his peace with the universe, and had found some¬ 
thing to believe in as well as much to disavow. Life and Habit 
and the theory of evolution therein expressed were the turning 
point in Butler’s mental attitude; he gained a new positive 
view of life from which .he never departed. 

Those who concentrated on Darwin’s theory of Natural 
Selection as the explanation of all the adaptations which were 
the evidence for evolution became neo-Darwinians. Against 
these Butler led a reaction and stated his belief in Creative 
Evolution, that the impulse that produces evolution is creative. 
Creative evolutionists have observed that the will to do any¬ 
thing can and does, at a certain pitch of intensity set up by

conviction of its necessity, create and organize new tissue 
to do it with. Evolution shows them this direction of vitality 
doing all sorts of things: ridding the fish of legs, building 
lungs and arms for the land and gills and fins for the sea: 
offering a choice of any sort of bodily contrivance to maintain 
activity and to increase resources. x 

In substance, Butler, who hated Darwin T s evolutionary 
theory of Natural Selection expressed his own views early in 
his career by denouncing in four volumes, the idea that man 
"survived or perished according to a process of natural selec¬ 
tion into which neither God’s will nor man’s will nor any 
being’s will appeared to enter at all. TT We survive, Butler 
argued, and Shaw after him, because "thensis in each of us a 
limited power of adaptation, which makes it possible for us to 
face without: disaster, or even with positive benefit, unexpected 
situations." Only if the unexpected demands too much of our 
strength and will, do we succumb. 

The theory of evolution as Butler looked at it was not 
primarily a scientific view about animals, but a practical 
working notion about men. If had two main aspects: inherited 
memory which was habit, and cunning or will in the place of the 
blind chance of "natural selection" as the basis of variation 
and therefore of the evolutionary process. 

The book Life and Habit , Butler’s most important con¬ 
tribution to biology, emphasizes several main principles: the 
oneness of personality between parent and offspring; memory

on the part of the offspring of certain actions which it did 
when in the persons of its forefathers; the latency of that 
memory until it is rekindled by a recurrence of the associated 
ideas; the unconsciousness with which habitual actions come to 
be performed; the purposiveness of the actions of living beings, 
as of the machines which they make or select* 

The chief subject matter of Life and Habit is the 
memory theory of heredity, an hypothesis which Butler hence¬ 
forth retained. He wished to show that living beings have 
made themselves what they are, purposively, from sense of need, 
"All growth", he said, "is only somebody making something." 

And he wanted also to explain how the machines or organs which 
the creature made for its own purposes came to be thus made* 

So complete an identification between means and ends could 
only have been realized intelligently; and for the outside in¬ 
telligence, which is supposed to direct the progress of the 
race, he substituted an intelligence residing within the 
creature itself. The problem then confronted him; how could 
the descendants of the primordial cell - how could any of the 
creatures in the whole chain of descent - intelligently do 
their work when they knew nothing about it? Butler answered 
that they did it by unconscious memory - personality existed 
through the ages from generation to generation, each ego in¬ 
heriting the memory of its ancestors and being able to repro¬ 
duce by inherited habit its ancestors f ways of coping with fam¬ 
iliar situations. Thus the return of associated ideas awoke 
the memories proper to the occasion, and the creature is able

to do things about which otherwise it could know nothing* 

Butler illustrates how all the actions we do best 
we do unconsciously* To reach this height of unconscious 
proficiency, we must have done the action very many times 
before; and this, we know, is exactly the case with all the 
things we do most easily; our breathing, the circulating of 
our blood, digesting and similar actions. Just in the 

same way the best thieves are those who are not aware of 
being thieves, the Kleptomaniacs,- the greatest hypocrites of 
the world are the unconscious hypocrites. It is the same, 
too, with all the first-rate bores. And these classes of 
people are the least likely to be cured of their unpleasant 
qualities because they are completely unconscious of any per¬ 
sonal defect. 

Not a scientist himself, sutler takes to task those 
so-called men of science whose ideal is in self-conscious know¬ 
ledge. These people who know what they know are to be looked 
on with suspicion. They are a class of people living under 
the law rather than under grace. Butler criticised these men 
of science because he thought them dangerous; he feared that 
they would impose a worse despotism than even that of religion, 
since, in proportion to its size, they made the most powerful 
and influential group in the country. "It may well be we 
shall find we have escaped from one set of taskmasters to fall 
into the hands of others far more ruthless. The tyranny of 
the Church is light in comparison with that which future gener-

ations may have to undergo at the hands of the doctrinaires* 

The Church did uphold a grace of some sort as the summum honum, 

in comparison with which all so-called earthly knowledge . 

was unimportant. ,!X Against this new menace Butler was de¬ 
termined to take a firm stand. 

The step from self-consciousness to introspection is 
not a very wide one, andButler was of the opinion that people 
who suffered from this malady were generally no good. Intro¬ 
spection is something that doesn T t concern us; it means also 
that we are not doing the business that lies before us. Often 
it lias a religious origin, though it is not a necessary accom¬ 
paniment to religion. To Butler, therefore, the best kind of 
religion is that which teaches us that ultimately we can know 
nothing about the universe, except that we are an integral part 
of it, and that we had better tend to our own affairs. Every¬ 
thing in the world, he saw, that did its work best did it just 
because it knew what that immediate work was, and gave no 
thought to the future, or to those larger processes of which 
it was but a single component part. What, for example, could 
be more unpleasant than an introspective blood corpuscle - 
and doubtless they do exist, just like introspective men and 
women? 

Human beings, then, and Indeed all normal living 
creatures will do their work best when they do it unconsciously, 

because they remember having done it before in their ancestors.

The best proof that a creature knows how to do anything, and 
therefore knows its own business, is that it does it so un¬ 
erringly. Butler could not see how hereditary instinct or 
Herbert Spencer T s "accumulated experience of the race" explaned 
these things, how, indeed, anything but memory would offer a sat¬ 
isfactory explanation. It is true that memories become more 
intense through repeated experience; yet the notion implies a 
sort of vicarious experience. Butler would transfer the ex¬ 
perience of the race to the individual, although he knew that 
it was for the race rather than the individual that Nature 
showed her most affectionate regard. To Butler the unerring 
nature of our unconscious actions is a proof of the force that 
our past experiences assert within us. 

We must suppose the continuity of life between living 
beings to be such that the successor is but a part of the life 
of his progenitor, imbued with all his memories, profiting by 
all his experiences, and only unconscious of the extent of his 
own memories and experiences owing to their vastness and al“ 
ready infinite repetitions. 

In discussing personal identity, Butler considers 
that personality and personal identity carry on not only be¬ 
tween a baby and the old man of eighty into which it developed, 
but also between the embryo before birth and after. So, too, 
the impregnated ovum, must be described as identical with the 
man of eighty into which it ultimately developed. Birth and 
death in fact are nothing but arbitrary divisions set up as 
convenient for social and legal purposes. It is purely ar-

bitrary to suppose that personality begins at birth and ends 
at death. birth has been made too much of as a line of de¬ 
marcation; birth is the beginning of doubt, the end of cer¬ 
tainty and of settled convictions. Birth is the beginning of 
consciousness, as the life before birth is the unconscious per¬ 
forming of the life we know best. 

In spite of the fact that there is no discontinuity 
between the embryo and the human being of eighty, man is a 
creature made up of a vast number of subordinate individual 
cells which have their separate lives within him and have 
their say in his actions and behavior. Our physical organisms 
are made up of myriads of smaller organisms, which may be un¬ 
aware of our existence but which form parts of us. Personal 
identity, therefore, is manifold in its nature and extends 
forward and backward. As the subordinate personalities in 
our bodies are parts and processes of us, so are we but parts 
and processes of life-at-large, the Life Force. Thus person¬ 
ality involves the probable unity of all animal and vegetable 
life as being nothing but one single creature, of which the 
component members are but, as it were, individual cells. 

The self-development of each new life in succeeding 
generations, the various stages through which it passes, the 
manner in which it prepares delicate structures, the many 
elaborate instincts which it exhibits on birth - all point in 
the direction of habit and memory as the only causes which 
could produce them. Each ego inherits the memory of its an¬ 
cestors and is able to reproduce by inherited habit its an-

cestors 1 ways of coping with familiar situations. Life is 
memory; the embryo must remember in order to live. 

But memory does not work continuously, as it may fall 
into abeyance and only reassert itself with the return of the 
associated ideas. A hen does not remember anything about its 
past life as an egg, any more than we remember ourselves as 
embryos; the hen possesses only the memories of its previous 
existences as a hen. Just in the same way a hen’s egg re¬ 
members what it did before when it was an egg, and acts 
accordingly. Every organism when placed in a certain en¬ 
vironment remembers its own behavior when previously in that 
environment; if, however, it is placed in surroundings which 
recall no proper memories, it must attem.pt to adjust itself 
or inevitably die. We must consider each organism from its 
point of view. "A hen", says Butler, "is only an egg’s way 
of making another egg." 

In a note on Reproduction Butler wrote: "Its base 
must be looked for, not in the desire of the parents to repro¬ 
duce but in the discontent of the germs with their surroundings 
inside these parents, and a desire on their part to have a 
separate maintenance." Weismann began with the germ as 
immortal, striving to reproduce itself though it is in no wise 
affected by, nor does it itself modify the bodies in which it 
resides. Butler also began with the germ as a starting pointy 
although, unlike Weismann, he could not believe in the non¬ 
transmission of acquired characters, or in the complete isola¬ 
tion of the germ cells. In the world of the Unborn in

Erewhon, Butler, in expressing the dissatisfaction of the germ 
with its existence there and its struggle to reach the world, 
is emphasizing the desire of the germ to reproduce. 

With his theory that instinct was inherited memory, 
Butler was able to explain many familiar facts. Those 
creatures who are longest in reaching juaturity would be the 
longest lived; lateness of .marriage in those of good health 
should tend to longevity of offspring; failure of memory 
would bring about ill health and decay. We should expect 
that all the qualities of human thought and character are to 
be found in the embryo; that all species are occasionally 
benefited by crossing, if the spread of conflicting memories 
be not too wide; that hybrids may be generally sterile be¬ 
cause of the internal tumult of conflicting memories result¬ 
ing in the death of the embryo. Further the memory theory 
of heredity may be used to explain the tendency of plants and 
animals to revert to the wild state when freed after several 
generations of domestication. 

Butler considers a very important difficulty in the 
way of instinct as hereditary habit is an adequate explanation 
of the instincts of neuter insects. Charles Darwin writes; 
’’But it would be a serious error to suppose that the greater 
number of instincts have been acquired by habit in one gener¬ 
ation, and then transmitted by inheritance to succeeding gen¬ 
erations. It can be clearly sho?m that the most wonderful 
instincts with which we are acquainted - namely, those of the 
hive-bee, and of many ants, could not possibly have been ac-

quired by habit. " x 

Darwin supposes that these modifications of struc¬ 
ture and instinct have been effected by the accumulation of 
numerous slight, profitable, spontaneous variations on the 
part of fertile parents, which has caused them to lay this 
or that particular kind of egg, which should develop into a 
kind of bee or ant, with this or that particular instinct, 
which instinct is merely a co-ordination with structure, and 
in no way attributable to use or habit in preceding gener¬ 
ations* 

Butler a^fe-es that the habit of laying this particu¬ 
lar kind of egg might be due to use and memory in previous 
generations on the part of fertile parents, "for the numerous 
slight spontaneous variations" on which "natural selection" 
is to work must have had some causa than which none more 
reasonable than sense of need and experience presents itself; 
and there seems hardly any limit to what long-continued faith 
and desire, aided by intelligence, may be able to effect. 

Butler drew on the teachings of Lamarck, for both 
believed in a theory of evolution "through need, faith, in¬ 
telligence, memory; both leaned toward a teleological explan¬ 
ation of the evolutionary process. A continual striving, 
a trying, stimulated by the will of the creature was what 
Lamarck taught as the basis of evolution. 

Sense of need is the directing force in the Lamarck¬ 
ian system; and Butler felt convinced that the explanation of

this evolutionist was far more satisfactory than the "small 
fortuitous variations’ 1 of Darwin and the haphazard unintelli¬ 
gent blindness of his theory of evolution. Butler f s crit¬ 
icisms of Darwin, which appear in the last pages of .Life and 
Habit are thus concerned with a vital question in Darwin f s 
teaching. 

rT The weak point in Mr. Darwin’s theory”, he says, 
"would seem to be a deficiency, so to speak, of motive power 
to originate and direct the variations which time is to 
accumulate. It deals admirably with the accumulation of 
variations in creatures already varying, but it does not pro¬ 
vide a sufficient number of sufficiently important' variations 
to be accumulated. Given the motive power which Lamarck 
suggested, and Mr. Darwin’s mechanism would appear (with the 
help of memory, as bearing upon reproduction, of continued 
personality, and of the vanishing tendency of consciousness) 
to work with perfect ease .... However we may differ from 
Mr. Darwin in detail, the present general acceptance of evol¬ 
ution must remain as his work, and a more valuable work can 
hardly be imagined. Nevertheless I cannot think that 
"natural selection” working upon small, fortuitous, indefinite, 
unintelligent variations, would produce the results we see 
around us." x 

"Mr. Darwin says that there is no good evidence in 
support of any great principle, or tendency on the part of the 
creature itself, which would steer variation, as it were, and 
keep its head straight, but that the most marvellous adapta¬ 
tions of structures to needs are simply the result of small

and blind variations, accumulated by the operation of 
rT natural selection", which is thus the main cause of the 
origin of species*" x 

In Life and Habit we see that Butler argues for 
the identity of memory and heredity, the transmission of 
acquired characteristics, the essential unity of life and 
the absence of any complete break between the generations, 
the continuous unity of life through a life force, and the 
conception of evolutionary growth as a gradual conservative 
absorption of improvements that have developed partly by the 
conscious desire of the organism, partly by lucky accident. 

Butler, derived from the Origin of Species the im¬ 
pression that evolution and natural selection were practi¬ 
cally the same thing. Such a reading owed almost everything 
to the jubilant reception of Darwin’s work, since the author 
was at pains to point out that natural selection was "the main 
but not the exclusive means of modification? But this 

misconception had a profound effect on Butler. In his four 
books dealing with one aspect of evolution or another he re¬ 
stored to general circulation such honorable names as Buffon, 
Lamarck and Erasmus Darwin and. showed that the idea of evolu¬ 
tion and much speculation as to its mechanism were antecedent 
to Darwin. Therefore in order to explain reasons for the 
confusion of Creative Evolution with Natural Selection I shall 
give here a little history of the conflict between the view 
of evolution taken by the Darwinians and called Natural Selec-

tion and that of Creative Evolution put forth by Samuel Butler 
and carried further by George Bernard Shaw. 

The idea of evolution was stated in the opinion of 
the Greek philosopher Empedocles that all forms of life are 
transformations of four elements, Eire, Earth, lir and Water, 
effected by the two innate forces of attraction and repulsion 
or love and hate. Later, Aristotle, when he grouped animals 
with backbones as blood relations, began the sort of classifi¬ 
cation, which, when extended by Darwin to monkeys and men, so 
shocked Bishop Wilberforce of Oxford. 

The celebrated French biologist Buffon, in 1749 pub¬ 
lished his theory of descent with modification and became 
the father of modern evolution. His claim to this title 
rests upon the scientific spirit of forty quartos which he 
wrote upon the subject of transformation of the species. 

Linnaeus, the famous botanist (1707-1778), in the last 
edition of his System of Nature began to wonder whether the 
transmutation of species by variation might not be possible. 

The great poet Goethe divined that there must be some common 
stock from v/hich all the -species had sprung; that it was the 
environment of air that had produced the eagle, of water the 
seal, and of earth the mole. 

Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of Charles, carried 
the environment theory much further, pointing out instance 
after instance of modifications made in species apparently 
to adapt it to circumstances and environment: for instance, 
that the brilliant colors of the leopard conceal it in the

the tropical jungle. 

In 1802 a German biologist named Treviranus stated 
his theory of evolution of man from the amoeba. In 1809 a 
French zoologist named Lamarck declared that species were an 
illusion produced by the shortness of our individual lives, 
and that they were constantly changing and melting into one 
another and into new forms as surely as the hand of a clock 
is continually moving, though it moves, so slowly that it 
looks stationary to us. 7/e have since come to believe 
not in the view that evolution proceeds by imperceptible de¬ 
grees, but in the more modern view that it proceeds by abrupt 
mutations. 

Evo l ution Old and New was designed by Butler to 
show how little justice had been done by Darwin to his in¬ 
tellectual predecessors, the eighteenth-century evolutionists. 
Buffon, Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck. Butler was quite unable 
to understand Darwin’s attitude to them. He seems from the 
very first to have objected to the tone of the opening para¬ 
graph in the Origin of Species , which, in 1859, appeared ”as 
a kind of literary Kelchisedec, without father and without 
mother in the works of other people,” 

7/hen the differences between Charles Darwin and 
Butler led to a personal quarrel, it is easy to see how en¬ 
tirely opposed their temperaments were and how little Darwin 
was fitted for controversy with ,T a clever and unscrupulous 
man like Mr. Butler.” With Darwin as a naturalist Butler

had no quarrel. But in the naturalist trying to reach 
wide general conclusions based upon his own observations, 
Butler expected to find something of the philosopher. In 
this he was disappointed. "Mr. Darwin has generally gone 
to good sources", he says. T, The ground of complaint against 
him is that he muddied the water after he had drawn it, and 
tacitly claimed to be the rightful owner of the spring, on 
the score of the damage he had effected." x 

Returning to the history of evolution in Evolution 
Old and New , we see that .butler a ives a full exposition of 
the ideas on evolution of these three great pioneers. Buffon, 
Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck. In comparing the old and new 
theories, Butler chooses Laaje.rck to represent the teleological 
or vitalistic conception which he held. 

Lamarck passed on from the concept of evolution as 
a general law to the method of evolution. This biologist, 
whilst making many ingenious suggestions as to the reaction 
of external causes on life and habit such as changes of 
climate, food supply, and geological upheavals, and so forth 
really held as his fundamental proposition that living organ¬ 
isms changed because they wanted to. As he stated it, the 
great factor in evolution was use and disuse. If you have 
no eyes and want to see, you will finally get eyes. If, 
like a mole, you have eyes and -don’t want to see, you will 
lose your eyes. If you like-eating the tender tops of 
trees enough to maize you concentrate all your energies on

the stretching of your neck, you will finally get a long neck 
like the giraffe* 

It is just by this process that a man sprawling on 
the ice with a bruised chin becomes a skater. The process is 
not continuous as it would be if mere practice had anything 
to do with it; for though you may improve at each trial dur¬ 
ing the lesson, when you begin your next lesson you do not 
begin at the point at which you left off; you relapse appar¬ 
ently to the beginning. Finally you succeed quite suddenly, 
and. do not relapse again. More miraculous still, you at 
once exercise the new power unconsciously. You have a new 
faculty, and must have created some new bodily tissue as its 
organ, and you have done it solely by willing. For here 
there can be no question of natural selection or survival of 
the fittest. The man who is learning to skate has no ad¬ 
vantage over the non-slater in the struggle for existence: 
quite the contrary. He has acquired a new habit, an auto¬ 
matic unconscious habit, solely because he wanted to, and 
kept trying until it was added unto him. 

But when your son tries to skate in his turn* he 
does not pick up the accomplishment where you left it. The 
set-back that occurred between your lessons occurs here. 

The race learns exactly as the individual learns. Your son 
relapses apparently to the beginning. How this is odd; for 
certain other habits of yours, equally acquired, equally un¬ 
conscious, are transmitted without any perceptible relapse.

For instance, your son yells as he enters the world; he breathes 
he circulates his blood; he sucks his food; he cuts teeth; later 
he eliminates himself by death. These habits are so rooted, 

so automatic that he must do them in spite of himself, 

V.'e have here a routine, which given time enough for it 
to operate will finally produce the most elaborate forms of 
organized life on Lamarckian lives without the intervention of 
natural selection at all. An amoeba by this process of ac¬ 
quirements becomes a man. 

The moment we form a habit we want to get rid of the 
consciousness of it so as to e&conomize our consciousness for 
fresh conquests of life, as all consciousness means preoccupa¬ 
tion and obstruction. We can lose a habit and discard an or¬ 
gan just as we acquired them; but this process is slow and 
broken by relapses; and relics of the organ and the habit long 
survive its use. And if other and still indispensable habits 
and modifications have been built on the ones we wish to dis¬ 
card, we must provide a new foundation for them before we de¬ 
molish the old one. This is also a slow process and a very 
curious one. 

The relapses between the efforts to acquire a habit 
are important because, as we have seen they recur not only 
from effort to effort in the case of the individual, but from 
generation to generation in the case of the race. Butler sees 
this relapsing from generation to generation as an invariable 
characteristic of the evolutionary process. Although the 
parents are full grown adults when a child is conceived, he

had to go back and begin as a speck of protoplasm, and to 
struggle through an embryonic lifetime, during part of which 
he had neither skull nor back-bone. With these acquired, he 
was for some time doubtful whether he was a bird or a fish* 

He had to compress untold centuries of development into nine 
months before he was human enough to break loose® as a human 
being. And even then he was incomplete. 

The time may come when the same force that compressed 
the development of millions of years into nine months may pack 
many more millions into even a shorter space; so that persons 
may be born able to walk, talk, and play the piano. But they 
will still begin as specks of protoplasm and acquire these 
faculties in a late stage of embryonic life. They must 
recapitulate the history of mankind in their own persons how¬ 
ever briefly they may condense it. This recapitulation 
widened human possibilities to the extent of enabling Butler 
to hope that tie most prolonged and difficult operations to 
men’s minds may yet become instantaneous or instinctive. 

It also directed Butler’s attention to examples of the pack¬ 
ing up of centuries into seconds in the skill of natural math¬ 
ematicians, natural musicians. These are cases in which a 
long, laborious, conscious process of acquirement has been 
condensed into an instinctive and unconscious inborn one. 

From 1830 until 1859 when Darwin turned the world 
upside down by his Origin of Species , there was a slump in 
Evolutionism. This slump not only heightened the impression

of entire novelty when Darwin brought the subject to the 
front again; it probably prevented him from realizing how 
much had been done before, even by his own grandfather, to 
whom he was accused by Butler of being unjust. Besides 
he was on a new tack in his view. 

Paley had put the argument in an apparently unan¬ 
swerable form. If you found a watch full of mechanism ex¬ 
quisitely adapted for measuring time, could you believe 
that it was not the work of a cunning designer? And 
here was a far more wonderful thing than a watch, a man 
with all his organs ingeniously contrived? Was it con¬ 
ceivable that this was the work of chance? That there 
was no purpose in this, no design, no guiding intelligence? 

If only some genius, while admitting Paley's facts, could 
knock the brains out of Paley by the discovery of a method 
whereby watches could happen without watchmakers, that 
genius was assured of such a welcome from the thought of 
his day as no natural philosopher had ever enjoyed before. 

The time being thus ripe, the genius appeared; and 
his name was Charles Darwin. And now, what did Darwin 
really discover? 

Once again let us call in the giraffe, the example 
of much Evolution controversy. How dii he come by his long 
neck? Lamarck would have said, by wanting to get at the ten¬ 
der leaves high up on the tree, and trying until he succeeded 
in wishing the necessary length of neck into existence. 

Darwin pointed out that an explanation, involving neither

will nor purpose nor designer was possible. If your neck 
is too short to reach your food, you die. That may be the 
simple explanation of the fact that all the surviving animals 
that feed on foliage have necks or trunks long enough to 
reach it. So out goes your belief that the necks must have 
been designed to reach the food. But Lamarck did not be¬ 
lieve that the necks were so designed in the beginning; he 
believed that the long necks were evolved by wanting and try¬ 
ing. Not necessarily, said Darwin. Consider the effect 
on the giraffes of the natural multiplication of their num¬ 
bers, according to the theory of Malthus. All the animals 
who happen to be an inch or so above the average will be 
better fed and stronger than the others. They will secure 
the strongest and tallest mates; and their progeny will surt 
vive whilst the average ones and the sub-average ones will 
die out. This process, by which the species gains in reach, 
will repeat itself until the giraffe f s neck is so long that 
he can always find food enough within his reach, at which 
point, of course, the selective process stops and the length 
of the giraffe T s neck stops with it. And this, without 
will, purpose, design or even consciousness beyond the blind 
will to satisfy hunger. It is true that this blind will, 

being in effect a will to live, gives away the whole case; 
but still as compared to the open-eyed intelligent wanting 
and trying of Lamarck, the Darwinian process may be described 
as a chapter of accidents. When the whole significance of

this dawns upon you, you see a hideous fatalism about it. x 

Thus did the neck of the giraffe reach out across the 
whole heavens and make men believe that what they saw there 
was a gloaming of the gods. i'or if this sort of selection 
could turn an antelope into a giraffe, it could conceivably 
turn amoebae into men. Though Lamarck T s way, the way of 

life, will, desire remained still possible, this newly shown 
way of hunger, death, chance, and bare survival was also 
possible; was indeed most certainly the way in which many 
apparently designed transformations had actually come to 
pass. 

How was it that Darwin was hailed as a deliverer 
and prophet, whilst poor Lamarck was swept aside as a crude 
and exploded guesser hardly worthy to be named as his 
erroneous forerunner? The answer is that Darwin’s theory 
of Natural Selection swept away all ideas of a cruel jealous 
god and showed science as the savior. 

Darwin converted the crowd, too, because his theory 
of evolution by Natural Selection was easier to understand 
than that of Lamarck. Evolution as a philosophy and phy¬ 
siology of the will seems a mystical process. Though the 
phenomena of use and disuse, of wanting and trying are 
familiar enough as facts, they are puzzling as subjects of 
thought and lead into metaphysics as you try to account for 
them. But men using the process of artificial selective 
breeding in plants and animals found it easy to understand

natural selection doing on a huge scale what they were doing 
on a small scale. Then too they were aware of sexual selec¬ 
tion and the survival of the fittest. If you are familiar 
with these three processes; the survival of the fittest, 
sexual selection, and variation leading to new kinds, you 
can easily understand Darwinism. 

Samuel Butler felt that he knew quite well what 
Natural Selection contrasted with Creative Evolution amounted 
to; and when he found that Darwinism was "becoming a substitute 
for conventional religion, he attacked it just as relentlessly 
as he had attacked the conventional religion in The Fair Haven 
and Erewhen . 

After having published his theory of memory in Life 
and Habit , Butler examined that of Professor Hering, an eminent 
physiologist at Vienna. The importance Butler attaciied to 
Hering T s views is shown by the fact that he translated the 
address and Included it In Unconscious Memory . Hering did 
indeed anticipate Butler's hypothesis of continued personality 
from generation to generation, and of the working of uncon¬ 
scious memory throughout; moreover. Haring went on to dis¬ 
cover what memory was, whereas. Butler had been satisfied to 
describe its activity, at the same time connecting it specifi¬ 
cally with the phenomena of heredity. Hering asserted that 
memory was due to vibrations] of the nerve fibres; occurrences, 
therefore, which have made small Impression upon us will awake 
only faint vibrations; whereas those characteristics which are 
common to many things will easily reproduce themselves, and the

vibrations will be correspondingly more intense. Butler 
did not commit himself to this hypothesis, though he leaned 
strongly towards it, and returned to the idea in the Uonclusion 
of Luck or Cunning? in advocating the unity of mind and matter. 

Unconscious Memory includes a chapter in translation 
from Von Hartmann’s Philosophy of the Unconscious with comment 
by Butler to explain the difference between Hartmann’s 
"Unconscious" as an all-creating personality and his own theory 
of the unconscious processes in mind and memory. 

Butler considers objections to his view of unconscious 
memory. throughout the inorganic as well as the organic world 
it may be said that like antecedents are always followed by .like 
consequents; that there is uniformity of action in atoms; that 
with a little ingenuity memory might be introduced into the in¬ 
organic world also; and that memory cannot, for example be 
connected with those diseases of old age which occur long after 
the time for reproduction has gone by. 

These criticisms were not considered valid by Butler. 
As we advance in life he said, we live less by inherited memory 
than by details of memory gathered from personal experiences 
which are pieced together by ourselves, and this is true of all 
those actions which are new in their general scope, but which 
in detail are not new. This second kind of memory is "the 
memory of our own antecedents." 

With regard to the atoms of inorganic nature "the 
sameness of action of like persons placed under like circum¬ 
stances for the first time, resembles the sameness of action

of inorganic matter under the same combinations; so it is 
not remarkable that a son inheriting his father T s constitu¬ 
tion should, as an old man make the same mistakes as his, 
father. Gout, cancer, and the diseases of old age are 
thus explained without the intervention of any sort of in¬ 
herited memory, T,x 

The theory of evolution, as Butler looked at it, 
was not primarily a scientific theory about animals; it was 
a practical working notion about men. It had two main as¬ 
pects, I, inherited or unconscious memory which was habit, 
and 2, cunning or will or striving, in place of the blind 
chance of "natural selection’ 1 as the basis of variation and 
therefore of the evolutionary process. Personality contin¬ 
ued through the ages from generation to generation, each ego 
inheriting the memory of its ancestors and being able to re¬ 
produce by inherited habit its ancestors’ ways of coping with 
familiar situations. That was one side of the doctrine; 
the other side came into play when the ego was faced with a 
new situation to which its inherited memory supplied no valid 
answer. What happened .hen? According to Darwin, there 
were variations of unexplained origin, ana those "variations" 
which the new situation happened to suit survived, whereas 
the "unfitted" died. This was natural selection. According 
to Sutler, what happened was essentially different. The ego 
faced with the unfamiliar situation tried to adapt itself and

sometimes succeeded if the gap between the precepts of in¬ 
herited memory and the needs of the new situation were not too 
wide. The adaptation, once achieved, became in its turn an 
inheritable memory, and in course of time a habit. For Butler, 
the beauty of the theory was that it put back mind and will into 
the centre of the evolutionary picture, whereas the Darwinians, 
in the name of scientific necessity, were in fact reducing 
everything to blind chance. They could not explain variation 
but treated it merely as an accident, and in making everything 
depend on it, make chance the sole master of man's fate. This 
seemed to Butler as unscientific as it was unsatisfying. He 
hanted a world ruled by laws, not by chance, and at the same 
time he wanted man to be the master of his own affairs. Var¬ 
iation by ,T cunning" not by "luck" plus unconscious memory 
transmitted from generation to generation gave him the answer 
he wanted, and he embraced it with enthusiasm, 

Luca or Cunning? sets forth the position Butler held 
against Darwin and shows how the very existence of evolution is 
bound up with it, and how the question at issue affects the 
view we take of life in a variety of ways. The plan of the 
book was changed as Butler was deflected by comments on the 
writings of Herbert Spencer, George Romanes, Grant Allen, Ray 
Lari', ester. 

In discussing the work of Romanes and Darwin, But¬ 
ler states that he found them both obscure because each had a 
tendency to appear to differ from others with whom they are

really in agreement. Such a method gave a semblance of or¬ 
iginality to their work* 

Butler r s mode of procedure would have been to state 
precisely the doctrines of the older evolutionists, then to say 
in what way he differed from them. Darwin never did this, 
partly as Butler believed because he felt so insecure about 
his own conclusions that all the time he had to be wrapping 
them in vague woolly sentences which should serve also as loop¬ 
holes of escape should escape become necessary. His studied 
literary habit was showing itself also in his intellectual 
successors. And it was this painful obscurantism, this 
scientific chiaroscuro that Butler felt bound to attack. 

As the boom in Darwinism continued, Butler led a 
small reaction. Darwin, Butler said, was rT the heir to a dis¬ 
credited truth and left behind him a discredited fallacy fT ; 
furthermore he had other disadvantages to fight against. Grant 
Allen in his biography Charles Darwin had heaped fulsome ad¬ 
ulation upon the evolutionist. Again,according to Ray Lan- 
kaster,it was sheer heresy to oppose Darwin. 

Butler sees Darwin as the apostle of luck. According 
to Darwin, the Lamarckian view is not a sound one. Some or¬ 
ganisms are so admirably adapted to their surroundings, and 
some organs discharge their functions with such provision, that 
we are apt to think they owe their development to sense of 
need; but this opinion is fantastic; the appearance of design 
is delusive; what we are tempted to see as an accumulated out-

come of desire and cunning, we should regard as mainly an accum¬ 
ulated outcome of good luck. 

Take the eye as an example. The main means of 
developing the eye was, according to Darwin, not use as varying 
circumstances might direct, with slow increase of power and an 
occasional happy flight of genius, but natural selection. 

What, then, is natural selection? 

Darwin has told us this on the title-page of the 
Origin of dpecies , defining it there as The Preservation of 
Favored Races; Favored is Fortunate, and Fortunate is Lucky; 
it is plain, therefore that Darwin regarded natural selection 
as The Preservation of Lucky Races and luck as the most im¬ 
portant feature of evolution. The point just touched upon 
involves the only essential difference between the systems of 
Darwin and those of Buffon, Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck. All 
four writers agree that animals and plants descend with modifi¬ 
cation; all agree that the fittest alone survive; all agree 
about the important consequences of the geometrical ratio of 
increase. The fittest alone survive - but the fittest from 
among what? Is the survival of the fittest to be taken as 
meaning the survival of the luckiest or the survival of the 
cunningest? With Darwin T s natural selection the central idea 
is luck, while with the Erasmus Darwinian system the central 
idea is cunning. Which is more important? Cunning which on 
the whole knows what it is aiming at and rakes every use of 
chance opportunities that come its way; or luck, which is con-

tinually turning up in the world, but which from its very 
nature can have no designed relation to the luck that has gone 
before it? Cunning does not include conscious attention and 
forethought; therefore with cunning Butler 'would connect memory 
as making a continuity throughout the life of the organism. 

Luck can ave no such continuity since it is necessarily spas¬ 
modic, one phase being isolated from another. Otherwise it 
ceases to be luck. 

According to Charles Darwin, ,T the preservation of 
favored or lucky races is by far the most important means of 
modification; according to Erasmus Darwin effort is unques¬ 
tionably the most potent means; roughly, therefore, there is 
no better way of putting the matter than to say that Charles 
Darwin is the apostle of luck and Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck 
of cunning, 

^he transition from a world governed chiefly by 
luck to one in which mind plays no part is not far to seek. 

In the eighteen-seventies, as a direct result of the pre¬ 
vailing biological theories, Butler noted the concurrent de¬ 
velopment of a mechanistic conception of the universe and 
what he calls a rT protoplasm boom”. The biologists shouted, 
”Great is protoplasm. There is no life but protoplasm, and 
Huxley is its prophet.” x Lhe conclusion that these eminent 

scientists arrived at was that the protoplasmic parts of the 
body are alone truly living while the non-protoplasmic parts 
are now-living. So Huxley proceeded to show that men and

women are nothing else than "conscious automata”, thought and 
feeling being only ”bye-products or cerebration” which have 
no material causative influences. Butler was in the keenest 
opposition both to the mindless conception of the universe 
and the protoplasm boom. He pointed out that if protoplasm 
was the only centre of life it must unite all life into a 
single body, and hence must be considered as the life of the 
world. So protoplasm would become identified with God, who 
of all fleshly forms chose this to manifest himself, ”Our 
biologists were fast nearing the conception of a God who was 
both personal and material, but who could not be made to 
square with pantheistic notions inasmuch as no provision was 
made for the inorganic world.” x Instead of allowing himself 
to be involved in such difficulties, Butler preferred to assert 
that the protoplasmic parts of the body are only more living 
than the non-protoplasmic. With this position is involved 
the whole of his philosophy of the inseparability of life 
and death, of degrees of death in life, and vice versa. 

To people like Huxley who were struggling to get 
rid of the Early Victorian notion of God and with it would 
banish mind also, there was no doubt smmething incomprehen¬ 
sible in a position like Butler f s. Mind to them, no doubt, 
smacked somehow of spirit, and spirit of mystic, religious 
associations. And probably they could not get rid of the 
idea that to have design there must be an outside designer. 
Butler however, explained what he meant. The God he believed

in was Cod in no mystic sense; and the design that was in the 
universe was part and parcel of it. 3o at a time when mater¬ 
ialism and fatalism were prevalent, when scientists and 
writers were approaching all sorts of delicate questions by 
the light of the crude method of Darwinism, it was perhaps 
not surprising that Butler was treated with little concern. 

<*'e must remember, however, that if Butler saw a crude Darwin¬ 
ism, biologists like Huxley saw a crude Lamarckianism. 

Butler points out that there is hardly an opinion 
on the subject of descent with modification which does not 
find support in some one passage or another of the Origin of 
Species . Indeed it is not easy to imagine any facts that, 
properly manipulated, it would fail to explain. rT If it 
were desired to show that there Is no substantial difference 
between the doctrine of Erasmus Darwin and that of his grand¬ 
son, it would be easy to make out a good case for this . rrX 

In Chapters Xlll and XLV of L uck or Cunning? Butler 
discusses the justification of Charles Darwin in claiming the 
theory of descent as his own. Butler is annoyed by the open¬ 
ing sentences of the Origin of apecies which give us a picture 
of a solitary thinker who had never heard of Buffon, Erasmus 
Darwin or Lamarck. Yet according to Grant Allen, the biographer 
of Charles Darwin, "everywhere around him as he grew up, these 
great but formless evolutionary theories were brewing and 
ferment ing*.' 

Butler quotes from the original edition ninety-seven

passages in which Darwin claimed the theory of descent either 
expressly by speaking of "my theory" or by implication as in 
the opening paragraphs of the O rigin of Species , In later- 
editions these "my T s" were gradually altered to the, our, 
this, Butler wrote an explaration of Darwin T s theory as a 
disinterested person might have written it, in which this 
sentence occurs. "If you ask me in what my discovery con¬ 
sists, I fteply in this; that the variations which we are all 
agreed accumulate are caused - by variation." z 

The value of .Darwin’s work as having led to the 
general acceptance of evolution is admitted by Butler, but 
he will not share in lavishing on him the fulsome adulation 
that is given by Grant Allen and Kay Lankester, 

In considering objections to the Lamarckian system, 
Butler takes up the threadbare one that Professor Semper, 
though he has adduced an immense number and variety of cases 
of structural change in animals and plants brought about in 
the individual by adaptation to new conditions, has never been 
able to show that such change was transmitted from parent to 
offspring. To this Butler replies that no one does actually 
see the hour hand of a clock moving. 

Butler finds that the greater part of the O rigin of 
Species is devoted to proving the theory of descent with mo£- 

it 

ification,... and that the fortupusness of the variations is 

kept as far as possible in the 'background. He admits that it 
is in great measure through Mr. Darwin T s books that descent has

62 


become so widely accepted, but that it has become so in spite 
of, rather than by reason of, his doctrine* 

In Butler's opinion Lamarck was the Lazarus of 
biology; his theory was never fully understood or thoroughly 
discussed, not at least in connection with the name of its 
propounder. Butler sees Charles Darwin as being not displeased 
to be thought the originator of the theory of descent with mod¬ 
ification, arid as not wanting fuller knowledge of Lamarck 
brought forward* 

Butler dwells on the defects of Darwin in both work 
and character remarking that Darwin's accuracy was not to be 
relied on when it ca e into conflict with his interests as a 
leader in the scientific world* 

In Butler's view it is impossible to draw a hard and 
fast line between the living and the non-living. It must be 
remembered that everything he wrote on biological subjects was 
a development of the sections in Brewhon dealing with the 
livingness of machines - of which Huxley's conscious automata 
theory is the complete converse. Machines, as we have seen, 
are the extensions of the personality of those who use them. 

And the same is true of property generally. ,T It is the last 
of ego and the first of non-ego." And so a man's body with 
its concomitant organs is property carried to the bitter end. 
Hence we speak of our "organic wealth". We may see from all 
this the frequent union between ego and non-ego; and in what 
Butler calls "incorporate tools", like the eye or the tooth, 
there is not a little of the non-ego element. As ego and

non-ego are inseparable, so are life and death. The common 
basis underlying both of them, is change* 

.butler sees mind and matter as one living thing. 
"Everything is living which is in close communion with, and 
interpermeated by mind or thought". We shall never get 
straight till we leave off trying to separate mind and matter; 
each is a function of the other; you must have both or neither. 

Plants then must have the same sense of pleasure and 
pain, memory, power of will and intelligent perception of their 
business as do animals. If, according to Butler, organic mod¬ 
ification is mainly due to function, and hence in the closest 
correlation with mental change, then plants, as well as animals 
must have minds and power to reflect and reason upon all that 
most concerns them. 

Unwillingness to concede intelligence and cunning to 
plants is based upon the error of regarding intelligence as 
the power of being understood by ourselves. Once admit that 
the evidence of a plant T s having intelligence depends upon the 
efficiency with which it conducts its business, and there will 
be no difficulty about supposing that in its own sphere a 
plant is just as intelligent as an animal. 

As to the reason for the development of the organic 
life of the world along only two main lines, Butler insists 
upon a difference of opinion which occasioned an early sub¬ 
division of primordial life. This difference of opinion 
occurred regarding the question whether it pays better to sit 
still or to wander abroad. Butler sees the animal development

from the decision to wander; and the plant life from the idea 
that it is better to be on the lookout to make the best of what 
comes one’s way. 

Considering the place in life occupied by plants and 
animals, butler says; "Bodily form may be almost regarded as 
idea and memory in a solidified state." His view of evolu¬ 
tion is that it is the cunningest fittest who survive. With 
the intelligence that is within the organism he coupled an in¬ 
herited memory, both of which aided it in reaching the goal it 
aimed at through will and desire and sense of need. 

In attempting to assess the contribution of Butler to 
the theory of evolution, we must take into consideration the 
place occupied by Darwin, the leader in evolutionary thought 
at the time. 

It must be remembered that when Butler wrote his 
books on evolution, Darwinism was by no means simply a scien¬ 
tific doctrine. It was ethics, politics, theology; it was 
everything rolled into one. George Bernard Shaw dramatically 
traces its effects in materialism, wars, loss of faith. Yet 
because Darwinism proved disastrous in these fi&ds, it need 
not be eradicated from biology. 

What Charles Darwin had done was not merely to make 
out a case for believing in evolution, but to present that 
case in a form which seemed to leave no room for the action 

of mind or will in shaping the order of things. This it was, 
and not evolution as such, that seemed to Butler to empty C-od 
and man together out of the course of nature, as creative

forces, and to leave only a mindless interaction of law 
and chance. Chance variations or "sports", flung into an 
environment ruled by inexorable laws, survived or perished 
according to a process of Natural Selection into which God’s 
will nor man’s will appeared to enter at all,, 

There was a babel of tongues for and against Dar¬ 
win - for and against the entire doctrine of the evolution 
of species. The challenge to God’s power was fundamental; 
for could God possibly be supposed to have created a world 
not subject to the rule of mind, but swept along upon the un¬ 
guided wheels of chance? 

Many men simply rejected the whole notion of evolu¬ 
tion. But Butler could not, for he was convinced that the 
theory of evolution was sound, and that Darwin had done great 
service by demonstrating its truth, at whatever cost to Chris¬ 
tian theology. Darwin had gone wrong in stating the theory 
of evolution in terms of Natural Selection, instead of devel¬ 
oping the thought of his grandfather, which had left place 
for mind and will. Butler wanted to restate Darwin’s doctrine 
in terms which fitted in better with his own experience and ob¬ 
servation. 

Now Darwin was not conscious of having raised this 
stupendous issue of a mindless universe, for he was a scientist, 
not a philosopher. He worked steadily on as a naturalist hav¬ 
ing no preoccupation with theological speculation. In the 
words of Butler: "Darwin was perfectly innocent of any inten-

tion of getting rid of mind, and did not, probably, care the 
toss of a sixpence whether the universe was instinct with 

mind or no . He had no deep-laid plan for pitchforking 

mind out of the universe or for setting up a scheme of mater¬ 
ialist philosophy. ,TX 

Darwin was conscious of having discovered a process 
of transformation and modification which accounted for a good 
deal of natural history. But he did not put it forward as 
accounting for the whole of natural history. He revealed it 
as a method of evolution, not as the method of evolution. It 
was not his intention to exclude other methods. Though he 
demonstrated that many transformations which had been taken 
as functional adaptations to environment (the idea of Lamarck) 
either certainly were or conceivably might be due to Natural 
Selection, he was careful not to claim that he had superseded 
Lamarck or disproved functional adaptation*, 

Darwin wrote a thoroughly documented book; hence he 
differs in this from his predecessors, Buffon and Lamarck. He 
arrived at his conclusions by the patient collection of a vast 
array of significant facts concerning all sorts of organisms 
living andextinct. Furthermore his theory applied to all or¬ 
ganic evolution, 

Butler, on the other hand, was an armchair biologist, 
not undertaking any experiment, but deriving his data from 
books, introspection and literary analysis. He drew upon the 
experiment sof others, subjecting them to an acute practical

criticism which sucked out the results he needed. 

Though Darwin’s theory was a scientific one argued 
in terms of organic evolution as a whole, it was in effect a 
philosophical theory bearing on the central conception of 
human life and purpose", Butler was no scientist, and no 
judge as to whether the theory was bad science, but it ran 
counter to the facts of human behavior as he saw them; there¬ 
fore because the doctrine had been advanced on a scientific 
basis, he attacked it on that plane, though its effects were 
fully as much human as scientific. Butler’s object then was 
to turn Lamarckism into scientific fact, 

Butler was concerned with human evolution, not really 
theorizing except incidentally about the evolution of animal 
species. He was thinking about men and women, as he actually 
met them and mingled with them. Eis two hypotheses of in¬ 
herited memory and creative development seemed to fit the 
human facts as he knew them. He saw people behaving in ways 
which seemed to him intelligible only on the assumption of in¬ 
herited habit; for how could they possibly have learned in 
their own lifetimes to do, without conscious effort, all the 
incredibly difficult things which from babyhood they did some¬ 
how manage to do? That was one thing; and, for another, he 
constantly saw people trying to handle new situations, often 
failing, but sometimes succeeding when the required adaptation 

of familiar behavior was not too great. If this was the case 
among men - and he knew it was - why should not the same explan¬ 
ations hold good over the entire field of organic evolution? 






68 


No sooner had the idea presented itself than he felt 
assured of its truth, and certain that the role assigned by 
Darwin and his interpreters to blind Natural Selection was 
wrong. That was how Butler came to run full tilt into the 
great Darwinian controversy while it was still fresh and lively. 

Now it seemed to Butler that Darwinism, as far as it 
rested on the theory of Natural Selection, emptied mind out 
of the universe as a creative force;, and feeling certain that 
mind was creative and that men f s wills did act with effect, 
he could not accept Darwinism as valid in the field which he 
felt he knew something about » the field of everyday human 
living. If, however, Natural Selection did not hold good 
there, was there any good reason for supposing that it held 
good elsewhere? Butler felt impelled to challenge, not 
simply the applicability of Darwinism to the affairs of civ-* 
ilized man, but the whole theory, for it seemed to be all 
vitiated by its final acceptance of fortuitous variations as 
the source of progress. 

It is quite true that Butler did not do justice to 
Darwin. He even attacked Darwin's personal character, being 
unable to bear the fact that the author of so abhorrent a doc¬ 
trine was an amiable and upright man. In his scorn of the 
doctrine of Natural Selection, Butler overlooked the importance 
of its work. 

On the other hand Butler was right in drawing atten¬ 
tion to the fact that Natural Selection was n&t a cause of 
variation. The effect of Darwin's Origin of Qpecies was to

divert attention from the way in which species originate. At 
the time it was put forward, the explanation of Darwin appeared 
so satisfying that biologists accepted the notions of variation 
and heredity there wet forth and ceased to take any further in¬ 
terest in the work of the hybridizers. Therefore the work of 
Gregor Mendel on heredity, which appeared in 1865 was ne¬ 
glected until its discovery by botanists in 1900. 

Both Darwin and Butler believed that acquired char¬ 
acteristics and variations in the parent were transmitted to 
the children. Darwin had set up a tentative theory - Pangensis 
to account for .this inheritance. He lived too early to know 
that mutations and other chromosomal changes take place and that 
they can produce inheritable changes in organisms. He was 
therefore unable to explain clearly how some variations are 
inherited and others are not. Aware of the weaknesses in his 
theory 7- of Natural Selection, Darwin stated them frankly so 
that other biologists might study them. He knew that his 
understanding of the problem was incomplete. 

A. Weismann in 1885 in his book The Germplasm 
helped to clear up the difficulty by ranking a distinction be¬ 
tween germinal variations and sominal variations. To be of 
any moment in evolutionary change a variation must be in¬ 
herited. And to be inherited it must be represented in 
the germ cells. This is the case for those variations now 
termed mutations. 

Even before Mendel's work became knownjBateson 
in 1895 had begun to call attention to the prevalence of

discontinuity in variation. Hugo de Vries in 1901 pub¬ 
lished Die Mutations-theorie wherein he showed that new var¬ 
ieties arose from older ones by sudden sharp steps or muta¬ 
tions and not by any process involving the gradual accumula¬ 
tion of minute differences. Both Darwin and Butler had 
mentioned these "sports" or big jumps. Butler anticipated 
this distinction: "It may be questioned whether what is 
called a sport is not the organic expression of discontent 
which has been long felt, but which has not been attended to, 
nor been met step by step by as much small remedial modifi¬ 
cation as was found practicable; so that when a change does 
come it comes by way of revolution." x 

Darwin in later years gave up his view of "sports" 
because he thought that the relatively rare sport or mutation 
would rapidly disappear through the swamping of effects of 
crossing with the more abundant normal form, and so, even 
though favored by Natural Section would never succeed in es¬ 
tablishing itself. Mendel’s discovery eliminated this 
difficulty, and De Vries fitted the idea of mutations into 
Darwin’s theory. 

In this form the theory of Natural Selection is 
acceptable to many biologists, though there are differences of 
opinion about many of its details, and even about the impor¬ 
tance of the various factors that Darwin listed. 

Objection raised against Darwinism is that many 
characters are apparently not advantageous. Most of the 
differences which enable the systematist to distinguish one

species from another serve no apparent purpose, and these are 
several well established fossil pedigrees in which useless 
structures have been evolved. Darwinians have a ready re¬ 
ply to this criticism. Often a single inheritable variation 
affects more than one character of the organism. One may 
therefore account for the evolution of useless characters by 
supposing them to be accompanied by unknown advantages* Even 
a disadvantageous character might prevail if it was linked 
to a sufficiently profitable adaptation* 

Another objection pointed out by Butler seems reas¬ 
onable: ,T There is hardly an opinion on the subject of descent 

with modification which does not find support in some one 
passage or another of the Origin of Species. TTX The hy¬ 
pothesis of Natural Selection is a very formidable explainer 
of data. Indeed it is not easy to imagine any facts that 
properly manipulated it would fail to explain. It was this 
very ability to explain every fact that gave Natural Selection 
its initial importance. Weismann’s challenge of the entire 
theory of the transmission of acquired characters marked a 
turning point from the older credulous attitude to the modern 
demand for more critical evidence. Since Mendel f s theory 
that agents of variation are the genes, it has been discovered 
that genes can be affected by X-rays and atomic rays. There¬ 
fore the theory of Natural Selection may be further modified 
in the light of fresh evidence. 

And what of Butler r s hypothesis of evolution? 

It is surely to the credit of Butler that he strove to work

out a scientific theory to account for human evolution on a 
basis of human experience and faith. In fact his real re¬ 
ligion is human experience. 

The main battle over Butler T s opinions has always 
revolved about the question of the inheritance of acquired char¬ 
acters. The battle is apparently won. Scientists now think 
that characteristics must be acquired in the long run, though 
there is not sufficient satisfactory evidence. Some biolo¬ 
gists have adopted the Lamarckian view,, that of variation 
through function to environment* 

Butler' emphasizes instinct or inherited memory as 
the great guide to living. Instinct provides us with success¬ 
ful behavior. A gentleman is born fortunate because he has 
social instinct. Butler believes that logic complicates 
living, the way to live life well is to follow instinct. We 
must remember that-^utler is combining human evolution, social 
evolution and behavior. Scientists do not think that we in¬ 
herit social behavior* 

The social evolution of man has obviously come about 
by the transmission of the experience of one generation to the 
next by oral and written instruction. Our thinking is so sat¬ 
urated with this point of view that it was natural to extend it 
to the bodily structures and behavior of the lower animals* Ex¬ 
perience has shown, however, that it is unwise to apply the ev¬ 
idence from one domain to another where an entirely different set 
of relations is known to exist* 

The Bering - Butler theory of the unconscious memory 






73 


of heredity was supported by biologists Hartgog, Regnano Semon, 
and Francis Darwin* In an address in connection with the 
Darwin Celebrations of 1908-9, Francis bar T win, the son of 
Charles Darwin, placed this theory as a cause of that variation 
which Natural Selection must have before it can act, and recog¬ 
nized inherited memory or habit as the basis of a rational 
theory of the development of the individual and of the race. 

The idea of molecular vibrations as the mechanism of memory has 
now been replaced by the view of rhythmic chemical changes. x 

Lamarckism was defended by able scientists, among 
them Herbert Spencer, Vines, Henslow, Cunningham, Cope, Hertwig, 
Delage. Butler’s most illustrious disciple, G-eorge Bernard 
Shaw, went much farther on the same track. Using Butler’s 
philosophical thought, Shaw, through the medium of comedy, 
applied his criticism in similar manner and extended it to a 
study of social and economic problems. 

In a recent study of Shaw, William Irvine, discusses 
the influence of Butler, reflected in certain similarities: 

"In affirming intelligent design but denying omnis¬ 
cience and omnipotence, in emphasizing the biological advan¬ 
tages of self-consciousness and implying the continuity of mind 
and memory from one generation to another, Shaw’s evolutionary 
theory strongly suggests the influence of Samuel Butler, and 
particularly of L uck or Cunning? 

Again in conceiving mind and truth as the products of 
will and effort, Shaw also suggests the influence of Butler. 

Both men are pragmatists. They look away from principles and

categories toward facta and consequences. They take an in¬ 
strumental r: ther than an absolute view of truth, seeing it not 
so much as conclusions which follow from premises but more as 
theories which yield fruitful results, whether in evolutionary 
biology, musical criticism or social reform. Intelligence 
and its products are functional; or as Shaw says T mind is a 
passion.’ It springs out of need and desire. In its 
simplest terms, truth is successful adaptation to environment 
and thus may be the instinctive possession of an animal as 
well as the self-conscious possession of a philosopher. Yet 
whereas Butler seems with romantic obscurantism to prefer the 
instinctive mind of the animal, Shaw prefers the self- 
conscious one of the philosopher, ?/hich in its ultimate per¬ 
fection he conceives as the final goal of evolution. And 
again, whereas Butler is on the whole a cautious pragmatist, 
accepting ideas because they are fruitful, Shaw sometimes 
verges on more impressionistic sophistry, accepting ideas be¬ 
cause they are imposing, shocking or simply individual. ttX 
Butler v/anted to enlist the moral, religious and 
biological forces of human nature in the cause of social pro¬ 
gress. He demanded of ideas that they satisfy his moral and 
religious sense, and having decided what to believe, attempted 
to infuse that belief in others by skilful argument. He 
merged will with instinct, habit with organic function, mind 
with unconscious adaptation to environment so that mind, will 
and habit might take over evolution and dedicate it to rational, 
moral and social ends.

Butler opposed the abolition of the Church faaring 
that mechanistic science would step into its place. In 

Creative Evolution he found what he was seeking, - a satisfac¬ 
tory faith, a rational religion.

CHAPTER FIVE 

THE LIVING GOD 

Butler f s evolutionary philosophy was also his re¬ 
ligion. 

"The theory that luck is the main maans of organic 
modification is the most absolute denial of God which it is 
possible for the human mind to conceive - while the view that 
God is in all His creature, He in them and they in Him is 
only expressed in other words by declaring that the main 
means of organic modification is, not luck, but cunning." 

So Butler concludes in Luck or Gunning? linking God and will 
as the same thing. 

Religion and its place in everyday life,, and the 
conflict between religion and science played a big part In 
the development of Samuel Sutler’s mind. He perpetually 
worried about religion until he settled firmly where he 
stood about it; then he disposed of the problem to his en¬ 
tire satisfaction. 

Butler, when he had lost his faith in orthodox 
Christianity and had discarded all belief in Its miraculous 
element, remained a theist in the sense that he was sure 

that the whole universe was animated by a presence to which 
he Jgave the name of " God".

77 


In his Dotebooks he has expressed certain views con¬ 
cerning this vital spirit. 

"The existence of free-will, otherwise cunning, is 
one of the proofs of the existence of an unseen world, and a 
means whereby we know the little that we do know of that 
world." 


"God and Life are as one thing." 

"God's merits are so transcendent that it is not sur¬ 
prising his faults should be in reasonable proportion." 

"God is not so white as he is painted, and he gets 
on better with the Devil than people think." 

"I believe there is an unseen world about which we 
know nothing as firmly as any one can believe it." 

"The world admits that there is another world, that 
there is a Kingdom, veritable and worth having, which never¬ 
theless is invisible and has nothing to do with any kingdom 
such as we now see®" 

"The true laws of God are the laws of our own well¬ 


being. " 

"God does not intend people, and does not like 
people to be too good. He likes them neither too good nor too 
bad, but a little too bad is more venial with him than a little 
too good." 

"There is no knowledge of good without a knowledge of 
evil also, and this is why all nations have devils as well as 
gods, and regard them with sneaking kindness. God without the 
devil is dead, being alone."

Such was Butler’s theology and it amounted to a 
sort of paazoism. It was closely connected with his view 
of human personality which in turn was linked to his doctrine, 
about inherited memory. This doctrine, indeed, was his key 
to the whole problem. He considered personality to be con¬ 
tinuous between parents and children and in effect between all 
living things - for he regarded them all as parts of a develop¬ 
ing and leavening universal stuff. This stuff wasG-od, the 
Spirit and Life which creates governs and upholds all living 
things. 

Butler had a profound respect for the religious 
sentiment without supernaturalism, and a profound disrespect 
for every scientific theory that seemed to him to dethrone 
the mind or will that was his idea of God* Out of this 
arose his search for a theory of evolution that should give 
mind or will or striving the. central place in the scheme of 
things. As soon as he had lighted on such a theory, the 
religious question was settled for him. He did not however 
hit on this central idea until the writing of Life and Habit „ 

The Victorian Age was till near its end a religious 
age both in the sense that most people of the middle and 
higher classes were religious, or took religion for granted 
and also in the sense that a large proportion of them thought 
about many things in religious terms. In Butler*s youth there 
was a religious and political calm over that part of English 
society in which he lived* 

This was the calm before the storm; for Darwin’s 

Origin of Jpscies was soon to start up again the battle between 













79 


religion and science* Butler however was not led to 
"doubt" by Darwin, nor by anything connected with the march 
of science. His starting point was his questioning of the 
essential dogmas of Christianity, his criticism of the incon¬ 
sistency of the gospel narratives, his doubt of the scrip¬ 
ture stories told by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John* 

In his anonymous pamphlet on The Bvidence for the 
.Resurrection , Butler questioned the evidence for Christ’s 
ascension from the dead. He developed this subject more 
fully in The Fair Haven , and much later in his account of 
the SunchiId myth in Trewhon Revisit ed* 

The book Tod the Known and God the Unknown sums 
up Butler’s philosophy. The view it put forward was a nat¬ 
ural result of the theories set out in L ife and Habit . To 
Butler, God is the living principle to be found in all organ¬ 
isms, and of which we all are co-members. 

In this book Butler sets out to do two things: 
firstly, to show that there does exist a single Spirit, whom 
"we cannot think of under any meaner name than God"; secondly, 
to show something more of the bodily expression, the outward 
mask of :his vast living being* 

This God is not pantheistic, for Butler does not 
subscribe to the belief of "those who hold that God is every¬ 
thing, and everything is God." According to Butler this 
belief is a contradiction in terms, for it is impossible to 
think of anything as God, or as forming part of God, which 




















80 


we cannot also think of as a Person, and it is impossible 
to conceive of "everything” as a person. Pantheists require 
us to see "everything" as a person which we cannot; or God as 
not a pe rson which we cannot. Butler sees Pantheism as prac¬ 
tically nothing else than Atheism; it has no belief in a per¬ 
sonal Deity overruling the affairs of the world as Divine 
Providence. Pantheism is a mere unconscious principle of 
life, impersonal, irrational as the brute matter that it 
quickens. 

Atheism was right in the sense that there was no 
personal God apart from the mind or will of the universe; 
theism was right in the sense that this mind was divine. 

"If man is to be in harmony with the dominant opinion of 
his own and of many past ages, he will see a single God - 
impregnate substance as having been the parent from which 
all living forms have sprung. One spirit and one form 
capable of such modification as its directing spirit shall 
think fit; one soul and one oody; one God and one Life." 

Using the analogy of the Tree of Life, Butler 
sought to shov *i that consciousness extends infinite in area 
through the universe even in the apparently smallest things. 

As each cell in the human body is an intelligent soul, so 
are we in ourselves combined to form some vaster being. 

"As the myriad organisms are parts and processes of us", But¬ 
ler wrote, "so are we parts and processes of life at large." 

Our forefathers, though they might and did feel

the existence of a personal God in the world, could not 
form a clear or definite conception until they would have 
grasped evolution of the old teleological Darwinism, 
supplemented by a perception of the oneness of personality 
between parents and offspring, the persistence of memory 
through all generations, the latency of this memory until 
rekindled by the recurrence of the associated ideas, and 
the unconsciousness with which repeated acts come to be 
performed. In this way we see the idea of a personal God 
developed by butler as the mind plus upward striving will, 
called by Shaw, the creative Life Force, the &lan vital 
present in all living forms upon this earth, a Force quasi¬ 
omnipot ent and quasi all-wise. Life began when the Life 
Force entered into matter and guided the molecules into or¬ 
ganic form, and continued by instinct and will* 

Butler T s immortality was of a vicarious type, for 
he did not believe in a future existence as we commonly un¬ 
derstand the words. rT We offer immortality", he said, "but 
not resurrection from the dead." By that he meant immor¬ 
tality in two aspects; physical in that no life ever dies, 
but is absorbed in the Life Force. "Life is the gathering 
of waves to a head; at death they break into a million frag¬ 
ments each one of which, however is absorbed at once into 
the sea of life and helps to form a later generation which 
comes rolling on till it too breaks." x

individual immortality, in that everyone according to the 
measure of his worth, will achieve a new life after death 
in the thoughts and li : : ns. Of the life we live 

in others he thus wrote: "A man should spend his life, or 

tier does spend his life in being born. His life is his 
birth throes. But most men miscarry and never come to the 
true birth at all, and some live but a very short time in a 
very little world and rone are eternal. Still, the life we 
live beyond the grave is our truest life, and our happiest 
for we pass it in the profoundest sleep as though we were 
children in our cradles ... And when we die, we die easily, 
know neither fear nor pain and live anew in the lives of 
those who have been begotten of our work and who have for 
the time come up in our room. ,T 

TT ie had better live in others as much as we can 
if only because we thus live more in the race, which God 
really does seem to care about a good deal, and less in 
the individual, to whom as far as I can see, he is indiffer¬ 
ent. After we are dead it matters not to the life we have 
led in ourselves what people may say of us, but it matters 
much to the life we lead in others and this should be our 
true life # nx 

This theory entered into his thoughts very intim¬ 
ately during later years. It was another tribute to in¬ 
telligence and consciousness as the things that really matter. 
So a good deal of his essay How to Make the Best of Life is 


x ~ Ihe Notebooks of Samuel Butler. 12-15 










85 


concerned not with the conscious life of the individual, but 
with the life he may live in others after his death* 

In his motebooks Butler had much to say concerning 
death, and life in the world to come. He notes; "Death is 
the dissolution of a partnership, partners to which sur¬ 

vive and go elsewhere. It is the corruption or breaking up 
of that society which we have called 0urself o The corpor¬ 
ation is at an end, both its soul and its body cease as a 
whole, but the immortal constituents do not cease and never 
will. The souls of some men transmigrate in great part into 
their children, but there is a large alloy in respect both 
of body and mind through sexual generation; the souls of 
other men migrate into books, pictures, music or what not: 
and everyone’s mind migrates somewhere, whether remembered 
and admired or the reverse. The living souls of Handel, 
Shakespeare, Rembrandt, G-iovanni Bellini and the other great 
ones appear and speak to us in their works with less alloy 
than they could ever speak through their children; but men’s 
bodies disappear absolutely on death, except they be in some 
measure preserved in their children and in so far as harmonics 
of all that has been remain. 

On death we do not lose life, we losfc only individ¬ 
uality; we live henceforth in others, not ourselves. Our mis¬ 
take has been in not seeing that death is indeed, like birth, 
a salient feature in the history of the individual, but one 
which wants exploding as the end of the individual, no less 
than birth wanted exploding as his beginning.

Death deprives us of conscious memory concerning 
our current life, but we live on in the race. A healthy 
enjoyment and employment of our life will give us a suffi¬ 
cient reward in that growth of God wherein we may life more 
truly and effectually after death than we have lived when 
we were conscious of existence, x 

Here we then have butler f s view of immortality. 

As we have seen, the word God is in part an expression of 
our ignorance of the ultimate nature of ourselves and the 
universe except that we know ourselves to be a part of a 
continuing Life Force. Butler notes; "To lament that 
we cannot be more conscious of God and understand him bettefi 
is much like lamenting that we are not more conscious of 
our circulation and digestion. Provided we live according 
to familiar laws of health, the less we think about circula¬ 
tion and digestion the better; and so with the ordinary rules 
of good conduct, the less we think about God the better. To 
know God better is only to realize more fully how impossible 
it is that we should ever know him at all. I cannot tell 
which is the more childish - to deny Him or to attempt to 
define Him.” 

Butler understands God as comprising all living 
units in His own single person, but asks what was the origin 
of Life? Who called the God of this world into existence? 

In answer, Butler conceives God :he Unknown - a vaster and 
more remote Being who looms out behind our God and who stands

in the same relation to Him as He to us. Then on Butler’s 
view of evolution by parity of reason, Life or God should 
have already passed through a growth analogous to that 
which we find he has taken upon this earth on an infinite 
number of past occasions; and the development of each class 
of life with its culmination in the vertebrate animals and 
in man, should be due to recollection by God of his having 
passed through the same stages or nearly so, in worlds and 
universes, which we know of from personal recollection, as 
evidenced in the growth and structure of our bodies, but 
concerning which we have no further knov/ledge. Butler’s 
system is therefore one of great concentric phases of life - 
the innermost of which is the cells that comprise us; the 
second is that of our selves which form the body of God; 
the third is that of the God of this world, and beyond this 
the.t of God the Unknown in whom all these units meet* 

Thus Butler in his scientific books has developed 
three main lines of thought; at times they touch and meet; 
at others they emerge as distinct subject for separate con¬ 
sideration, the most important questions that Butler dwelt 
with. These were his theory of inherited memory; his rec¬ 
ognition of ohe value of the doctrines of the older evolu¬ 
tionists as against the mindless purposeless view of the un¬ 
iverse of the Darwinians; and the panzoistic philosophy which 
grew out of his biological ideas* 

Religious theory of course is never consistent with 
worldly practice, and Butler was no lover of theory. 7/hat he

wanted was a greater humanity within the structure of re¬ 
ligion itself; it must have a place for the comic as well 
as the beautiful, for the grotesque no less than the ordin¬ 
ary, for the human equally with the divine, Butler in his 
essays on Italian art praises these happy people for their 
perception of these qualities, and admires the spirited 
character of their work, the manner in which they combine 
devotion with amusement. 

In the essay A Medieval Girl School Butler remarks; 
"If Christianity is to be a living faith, it must penetrate 
a man f s whole life, so that he can no more rid himself of it 
than he can of his flesh and bones or of his breathing. What 
is the essence of Christianity? The essence of Christianity 
lies neither in dogma nor yet in abnormally holy life, but in 
faith in an unseen world, in doing one's duty, in speaking 
the truth, in finding the true life rather in others than in 
oneself, and in the certain hope that he who loses his life 
on these behalfs finds more than he has lost." 

Butler was far from orthodox Christianity, yet he 
was a very religious man. Even if we do not take seriously 
his statement that he thought of himself as a member of the 
Broad Church, it still remains that in his own view he was 
building a better foundation for the religion of the future. 

He believed "that if a man loves God he cannot come to much 
harm." But he felt that to achieve this security a man must 
disregard theological dogmas and social conventions completely 
and listen to the voice of God within himself. He pleaded;

CHAPTER SIX 

CONCLUSION 


The object of this essay has been to show the nature 
of the philosophy of Samuel Butler, and its development through 
his life and work. The concluding chapter reviews his position 

Butler’s conception of life was mainly occasioned by 
his sensitive reaction to his cheerless upbringing in the narrow 
evengelical surroundings of a Victorian household. The Lay 
of All j?lssh , his autobiographical novel, gives a cruel, piti¬ 
less picture of an ecclesiastical education and its consequences 
Though Ernest Pontifex, the "hero" and Butler did not lead en¬ 
tirely similar lives, the likeness is sufficient for Butler to 
portray his unhappy childhood, his youth and his subsequent 
emancipation. 

In this book, as in Erewhon, Butler did upset the 
idols of the Victorian temple in that he mocked ideas of re¬ 
spectability, education, art ethics, religion, family life* 

He dared to attack the home life, a subject then considered 
sacred. He evidently hated Victorianism because his father 
was Victorian. 

Butler accused the canon of encouraging in him the 
despicable traits of unquestioning faith and conventional obed¬ 
ience while damping down every speculative impulse. He seems 
to have felt that his father turned him from a naturally joyous 
soul with an ardent will to be nappy, into a crabbed and unhappy

rebel always expecting to be snubbed down. 

Once independent of his father, butler obeyed his 
speculative impulse. He rejected Christian orthodoxy in the 
search for a rational religion that would satisfy him. In¬ 
stead of his harsh critical attitude toward Christianity, 
there appears a more sympathetic intelligence, a respectful, 
liberal attitude which grows, gathers strength and finally 
conquers. Butler has a faith of his own in which almost 
mystical elements are added to the findings of reason. In 
the memory of ourselves that we leave, in the lasting fruit¬ 
fulness of our actions, we find an immortality on this earth. 
The divine is imminent in the universe; and beyond the known 
God whom our reflection can compass, God the Unknown dwells 
in infinite space. 

Though Butler was one of the first disciples of 
Charles Darwin, his support of the theory of evolution did 
not prevent him from applying it humorously to machines and 
picturing the prospect of a world in which they would reduce 
their masters to slavery. Butler then had the problem of 
formulating an adequate philosophy of nature in which the 
physical and biological sciences could be merged into a new 
synthesis. A philosophy of the new society involved crit¬ 
icism of the ends of human action, a clarification of the con¬ 
tent of the good life, and a criticism and formulation of the 
technique of social control. The religious problem, now 
changed in form, required an adjustment of the values of a

personalistic philosophy to the scientific knowledge of 
naturalism. 

Denying the purely mechanical process of natural 
selection and the resulting materialism, Butler made evolu¬ 
tion take the place of Providence and saw progressive social 
betterment as the end of life. As a convinced Lamarckian 
Butler believed that qualities directly induced by new func¬ 
tions and surroundings may be added to the racial repertory 
by hereditary entailment, and that they may be cumulatively 
increased by contributions made by individual parents. To 
many biological evolutionists this possibility appears im¬ 
proved and even improbable, 

Butler was of an "experiencing nature"; he based 
his writing on his acquaintance with human life as he had ob¬ 
served it. His evolutionary philosophy was pragmatic in its 
methods, empirical in its conclusions. His pragmatism 
showed two main tendencies: emphasizing its scientific use, 
it plunged philosophy deeply into the facts of experience; 
emphasizing its religious use, it freed thought from logical 
consistency and permitted it to identify truth and mind with 
will and power. 

Butler was thinking in terms of life and the living. 
Creative evolution implies Life or Mind as the efficient cause 
of the course of events in living creatures. To Butler every 
cell or atom is a living thing. All organisms have memory, 
consciousness and will through which they adapt themselves

to the environment. In discussing our subordinate person¬ 
alities Butler states; "Every individual person is a compound 
creature being made up of an infinite number of distinct cen¬ 
tres of sensation and will, each one of which is personal, and 
has a soul and individual existence, a reproductive system, in¬ 
telligence and memory of its own, with probably its hopes and 
fears, its times of scarcity and repletion, and a strong con¬ 
viction that it is itself the centre of the universe. TTZ 

As we have within us so many tributary souls, so 
do we in turn form the component atoms of that compound 
creature Life, which continues the race. ^e all are part 
of the unending life stream, each one of us being the primor¬ 
dial cell which never died or dies but has differentiated it¬ 
self into all living beings whatever. 

The very essence of personality involved the prob¬ 
able unity of all animal and vegetable life as being nothing 
but one single creature of which the component members are in¬ 
dividual cells, life being a sort of leaven which, if once in¬ 
troduced into the world, will leaven it altogether. 

Life as a whole does not die; its daily waste is 
carried on by the conscious death of its individual members; 
its daily repair is carried on by conscious reproduction of 
its component items. Concerning death Butler notes: 7 0n 
death we do not lose life, we lose only individuality; we live 
henceforth in others, not in ourselves. If we would re¬ 

tain personal identity at all, we must continue it beyond what 


x - Life and Habit. 105 











92 


we call death, in which case death ceases to be what we 
1 ve hitherto thought it, that is to say, the. .end of our 
being, " 

Butler’s evolutionary theory has two aspects: 
inherited memory or habit, and design or cunning. Butler 
identifies memory with heredity; he inverts the whole con¬ 
cept of the subconscious or the unconscious and makes in¬ 
stinctive living the ideal. His remark then has signifi¬ 
cance: "Is life worth liv«i ng? That is a question for the 
embryo, not for man. TT Memory and heredity are the means of 
preserving experiences, but they do not originate. The in¬ 
crement in each generation at the moment of its being an in¬ 
crement, has nothing to do with memory or heredity, but is 
due to change in conditions. 

"Design comes in at the moment that a living being 
either feels a want and forecasts for its gratification or 
utilizes some waif or stray of accident on the principle which 
underlies all development that enough is a little more than 
one has. It is the business of memory to conserve and to 
transmit from one generation to another that which has been 
furnished by design or by accident designedly turned to 
account. " x 

ffhen a human being meets a new situation he thinks 
consciously until he has mastered the problem; then the ac¬ 
quirement becomes unconscious and is transmitted to succeeding

generations in time becoming perfected as an instinct. 

Life then becomes an endeavor to master problems to do them 
automatically. Since consciousness means preoccupation and 
abstraction, the most successful lives are those of inborn 
memory, of inherited habit and behavior. 

'^he logic of Butler T s position is that human life 
would become unconscious; but he does not look to that, for 
he notes: TT My theory of the unconsciousness does not lead to 
universal unconsciousness, but only to pigeon-holing and 
putting by. We shall always get new things to worry about. 

If I -thought that by learning more and more I should ever 
arrive at the knowledge of absolute truth I would leave off 
studying. But I believe I am pretty saf e. itX 

Butler assigns limits to reason in the life of the 
organism, and states the rights of instinct and intuition. 
Though he makes unconscious living the ideal of life, he does 
not rule out genius and originality. But he cautions that 
the forward man, the innovator must not be too far in front 
of other people, otherwise he will be entirely Isolated frftm 
them; there will be no connecting links by which to attach 
himself to those he ivould lead after him. 

Evolution is both instinctive and conscious. Con¬ 
scious evolution occurs in two stages. Because of change, a 
genius enunciates some new idea. Being a precocious sport 
and therefore maladjusted to his environment, he is persecuted 
by his contemporaries. Then the second stage begins. The

The masses adopt his idea, and worship the genius that has 
passed through the fire. "So men of genius always escape 
their own immediate belongings and indeed generally their 
own age. " 

Butler, conceiving mind and truth as the product of 
will and effort, considers truth relative not absolute. ^PJrror 
springs from supposing there is any absolute right or absolute 
truth, and also from supposing that truth and right are any 
the less real for being not absolute but relative. Whenever 
we push truth hard she runs to earth in contradiction in terms, 
that is to say, in falsehood. .Truth should never be allowed 
to become extreme; otherwise it will be apt to meet and to run 
into the extreme of falsehood. The pursuit of truth is chim¬ 
erical. That is why it is so hard to say what truth is. 

There is no permanent absolute unchangeable truth; what we 
should pursue is the most convenient arrangement of our ideas*" x 

Butler made an intimate and original relationship of ideas 
throughout his work. He showed no conscious striving after con¬ 
sistency but a fitting of all ideas into his general outlook. 

He made intelligence the keystone of his philosophy and used it 
towards rational, moral- and social ends. 

Repeatedly demonstrating that it was unwise to push 
logic to extremes, Butler regarded life as a matter of illog¬ 
ical compromise. He noted: "There are no unshakable princi¬ 
ples. In practice it is seldom very hard to do one's duty

when one knows what it is; but it is sometimes exceedingly 
difficult to find this out. The difficulty, however, is 
often reducible into that of knowing what gives pleasure, 
and this though difficult is a safer guide and more easily 
distinguished. In all cases of doubt the promptings of 
a kindly disposition are more trustworthy than the conclus¬ 
ions of logic and sense is better than science.... Logic 
is like the sword - those that appeal to it shall perish by 
it. Faith is appealing to the living God"... x 

The .-.ay of .-,11 H esh is an excellent portrayal of 
the creed of butler and a dramatization of his evolutionary 
philosophy. In fact the novel might be used to illustrate 
each point, as has been done in the study of it by G« D. H. 
Cole. x Butler goes back to the third generation to explain 
his hero. Ernest’s father and grandfather are both bad. 
About his own great-grandfather Butler knew nothing; hence 
in John Pontifex, the village carpenter, Butler hypothesized 
a source for the elements of decency and strength in Ernest’s 
character. John Pontifex is an "unconscious knower"; he 
lives "under grace". His son George is an "irregular, ab¬ 
normal growth, a sudden divergence". George’s sons, espec¬ 
ially Theobald, Ernest’s father, suffer from this sudden in¬ 
terruption to the normal evolutionary development. 

Aiethea, Ernest’s aunt, is a "sport", an apparently 
causeless variation. Towneley, the "ideal gentleman’’ to

both Butler and .Ernest, is rich, generous, gifted with attri¬ 
butes of serenity and good manners, resulting from uncon¬ 
scious memory. 

The novel .may be regarded as a practical illustra¬ 
tion of the theory of heredity propounded in Life and habit . 

What it really shows is; ,T If a man is to enter the kingdom 
of heaven, he must do so, not only as a little child, but as 
a little embryo, or rather as a little zoosperm - and not 
only this, but as one that has come of zoosperms which have 
entered into the kingdom of heaven before him for many gen¬ 
erations . TlX 

Throughout his writings Butler reiterated his hatred 
of sham and pretense of humbug and deceit. He advocated living 
according to the mean, the balance of common sense as opposed 
to the absurd extreme of logic. In contrast to the unlovely 
manner of Christian living in the Pontifex home, hutler pre¬ 
sented in Tirewhon Pevisited a charming picture of Yram, her 
husband, her son G-eorge as pleasant, happy people who have 
succeeded admirably by putting the philosophy of the mean into 
practical effect. The art of living , Butler held, was to 
keep a balance of common sense between the vital inheritance of 
unconscious memory and the equally vital, capacity for adaptation. 

Butler, like Ernest Pontifex, was not downed by diffi¬ 
culties. In spite of misfortunes and disappointments, he en¬ 
tered into a useful and happy life.

G. D. H. Cole notes that Sutler for all his audacity- 
in writing was by nature a timid soul and "never ceased to be 
afraid of his own deviations from the normal." He finds in¬ 
stances of Butler T s timidity in his avoidance of marriage, 
family and social life, and in his philosophy of limited adap¬ 
tive power. 

In my opinion Butler was a solitary worker and a 
cautious man who took nothing on trust, inverted the current 
beliefs, and worked out a faith founded upon human experience. 

w r ith impish perversity Butler turned the Victorian 
world inside out, yet remained a conservative of the old 
school, of middle class spirit and conscience. Thus to him 
the best morality was that which may best ensure the getting 
of all those things ’hvhich work together for good to them 
that love God"; they are "good health, good looks, good 
sense, experience, a kindly nature and a fair balance of cash 
in hand." A religious or moral system that fosters these 
has no cause to fear attack. 

Neglected in his own lifetime, Butler has since 
been endowed with that immortality so often considered by 
him when he expressed his faith in a posterity.
