THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS OF GRAIN YIELD, STOMATAL LENGTH, 
AND SOIL DROUGHT IN WHEAT VARIETIES 


lames George Darroch 


INTRODUCTION 


The problem of drought and the production of wheat 
varieties resistant to it has been a major project of the 
Department of Field Crops, University of Alberta, for many 
years. Despite the volume of work done both on this continent 
and abroad a mutually satisfactory solution of common diffi¬ 
culties has not yet been propounded. Chief among these diffi¬ 
culties is the inability to select readily plants whose pro¬ 
geny will give the highest return of grain under conditions of 
limited soil moisture. 

The workers in this department who initiated the pro¬ 
ject realized that progress in breeding for drought resistance 
would be extremely slow until such time as the relationships 
of various plant characters to yield under dry conditions were 
understood. Accordingly many studies were undertaken with 
this end in view and substantial progress has been made. The 

most promising relationships, for use of the plant breeder, 

/ 

were those established between stomatal length and yield, and 
between protein content and yield. Another promising relation¬ 
ship was that established between reaction to soil drought and

yield "by workers at the Dominion Experimental Station, Swift 
Current, Saskatchewan. These studies indicate that, in breeding 
wheats with high yielding capacity for drought areas, it would 
he possible to increase the general yield level of the hybrid 
populations by selecting on the basis of stomatal length, 
protein content, or reaction to soil drought. The relative 
value of the three characters for this purpose cannot be 
determined, however, as the studies were made on different lots 
of material. 

The present investigation Y/as designed to provide addi¬ 
tional information on these relationships and to assess the 
relative value of each in breeding wheats with superior 
drought resistance. Accordingly, the three characters, 
stomatal length, protein content, and reaction to soil drought 
were all studied in relation to yield with the same varieties 
and hybrid lines. In addition the relationships of certain 
other characters, such as plant height and time of maturity, 
were investigated. 

A general outline of the experiments conducted and the 
plan followed in presenting the results of these will clarify 
the organization of this thesis. Six experiments were conducted. 
Experiments 1 and 2 were greenhouse trials in which the rela¬ 
tion between seedling leaf stomatal length and soil drought 
reaction was studied. Experiments 3 and 4 Y/ere field tests 
conducted at Edmonton and Swift Current respectively; data 
were obtained on yield, time of maturity, height, protein 
content, and 1000 kernel weight. In addition Experiment 4 was

used for a study of the relation "between seedling and flag 
leaf stomatal lengths* Experiment 5 was a greenhouse test in 
which the plants were grown under limited soil moisture con¬ 
ditions and the effect of this upon the seedling - flag leaf 
stomatal length relationship was determined. Experiment 6 
was planned for the same purpose as Experiments 1 and 2 "but 
data on stomatal length only were obtained*

LITERATURE REVIEW 


This review is divided into three main sections which 
cover in turn the literature on stomatal length, reaction 
to soil drought, and plant character relationships in the 
cereal crops. 

Stomatal length was early demonstrated to he a varietal 
characteristic. Kolkunov (26) found that there was a range 
of from 64 to 96 microns in the eight wheat varieties he 
examined. In a study of sixteen pure lines of oats Yakushkina 
and Vavilov (57) found stomatal length to he a heritable 
character. Later Kolkunov (29) examined four pure lines of 
Beloturka wheat and found it possible to identify them by 
their relative stoma.tal lengths. Heuser (21) studied stomatal 
length on terminal and sub-terminal leaves of three wheat 
varieties and recorded varietal differences. Birdsall (2) 
concluded that significant differences in stomatal length of 
wheat varieties could be expected when either the seedling, 
sub-terminal, or terminal leaves were compared for this 
character. 

The character of stomatal length is variable betv/een 
the leaves of the same plant. Zalenski (61) concluded that 
stomatal length decreased with increasing height of insertion 
of the leaf within a plant. Yapp (58) supported this con¬ 
clusion in independent parallel studies. Salisbury (45) 
found that, although such was generally the case, when plants

developed in a humid atmosphere the gradient tended to dis¬ 
appear. Heuser (20) found that such a gradient occurred and 
Birdsall's data (2) shows that it existed in his material. 

Environment exerts a pronounced influence on the stoma- 
tal size of all leaves developed during the later stages of 
growth. Most studies have "been concerned with the flag or 
terminal leaves. Kolkunov (27), in an investigation with 
beets, found that the most resistant plants in fields affected 
by drought had the smallest cells in roots and leaves. The 
work done by Heuser (21) with three wheat varieties grown at 
five locations also demonstrated an environmental influence 
on cell size. Eberhardt (11) and Lebedintsev (31) examined 
plants grown under various levels of humidity and found that 
lower humidities induced greater xeromorphy of structure. 

The works of Heuser (20), Hippel (44), Frey (13), Kokin (25), 
Tumanov (50), Van de Roovaart and Fuller (51), Birdsall (2), 
and Whiteside (56) all show that stomata were more numerous 
and smaller when plants were grown with limited soil moisture. 
Some workers report results which do not agree with the 
majority; Weiss (54) worked with a number of species and 
Kiesselbach (24) with corn varieties and neither found any 
evidence of environmental influences. Sande-Bakhuyzen (46) 
found that the seedling leaves of wheat showed no significant 
variation due to external conditions when compared on the 
basis of stomatal length. 

Stomatal length has been correlated with other plant 
characters by several workers. In a wet year Kolkunov (28)

found the high yielding corn varieties to be large celled 
while the reverse was found in a dry year. He reported the 
same findings for wheat when grown at various moisture levels 
in pot cultures, (29). In another case Kolkunov (28) reported 
short stomata to be associated with earliness. Scheibe (47) 
concluded that shorter stomata and greater drought resistance 
were related. In a study of spring and winter wheats Pavlov 
(39) found earliness, shorter stomata, and increased suction 
pressure, with few exceptions, to be associated with increased 
drought resistance. Birdsall (2) reported that stomatal 
length was negatively correlated with yield and positively 
correlated with protein content in wheat. Yakushkina and 
Vavilov (57) failed to find any relation between cell size 
and length of the growing period, tillering ability, disease 
resistance, or yield in sixteen oat lines. 

Soil drought and the relative ability of plants to 
survive it has been studied by numerous workers. Plant 
ecologists and physiologists have studied the adaptations of 
species and their relative abilities for survival when grown 
under dry conditions. Of more immediate interest are those 
few papers which have dealt with varietal resistance to soil 
drought, especially those concerned with crop plants. 

Maximov (34) concluded that- “the capacity of enduring 
prolonged wilting is one of the most important of the char¬ 
acters the sum total of which determines drought resistance 
in plants”. Under ^Jaximov’s direction Tumanov (50) subjected 
eight wheat varieties to two weeks’ drought at the shooting

stage. On the basis of plants killed he recorded survivals 
ranging from 23 to 94 per cent. Kondo (30), using a similar 
treatment, recorded differences in survival for varieties 
within the crops mustard, sunflower, soybean, safflower, and 
flax. Sugar beet varieties were tested by Orlovsky and 
Oumanska (38) and they found varietal differences when the 
tests were made at the two leaf stage. Orlovsky (37) 
reported further studies with sugar beets in which he selected 
surviving plants within a variety and found their progeny 
to register survivals 12 per cent higher than those of the 
parent variety. Perepeliuc (40) classified Rumanian wheats 
on the basis of Tumanov r s method, using a ten day treatment, 
and found distinct varietal differences. Aamodt and Johnston (1) 
found Reward and Caesium to differ markedly in regard to 
survival following soil drought, Caesium survived while 
Reward did not. In an attempt to utilize this varietal 
characteristic Platt and Darroch (43) conducted a series of 
experiments with wheat varieties and lines; in ail cases 
highly significant varietal differences were recorded despite 
a significant variety by test interaction. 

The survival of plants following a period of soil drought 
may be related to other plant characters. There have been, 
apparently, only a few attempts to establish definite 
relationships. Tumanov (50) stated that, in general, his 
results agreed with field reaction. Orlovsky (37) found that 
the varieties of sugar beets showing highest survival gave 
the highest yields of roots and had the lowest sugar contents.

Yield and survival were positively correlated in the experi¬ 
ments reported by Platt and Darroch (43). 

There have been a number of studies in which the relation 
ship between yield and such characters as maturity, height» 
protein content, and 1000 kernel weight has been studied. 

The relation between yield and protein content is essentially 
negative, as reported by Clark and Hooker (7), Clark, jet al 
(6), Waldron (53), Malloch and Uewton (33), and Heatby and 
hcCalla (56). Significant positive correlations were reported 
by Clark and Hooker (7), and Clark, et al (6) while in some 
cases no relationship was found by Clark, et al (6) and 
Heatby and McCalla (36). Yield and earliness were found to 
be negatively correlated by Goulden and Elders (16), Hayes, 
et al (IS), Bridgford and Hayes (3), Goulden and Heathy (17), 
Immer and Stevenson (23), Immer and Ausemus (22), Waldron (53) 
Moussouros and Papadopoulos (35), and Torrie (49). A positive 
relationship has been reported by Clark and Hooker (7), 
Bridgford and Hayes (3), and Goulden and Elders (16) while 
no association was found by Clark and Hooker (7), Hayes, 
et al (18), and Torrie (49) between these two characters. 

Plant height and yield was found to be positively correlated 
by Clark and Hooker (7), Hayes, et al (18), Goulden and 
Heatby (17), and Bridgford and Hayes (3), while Immer and 
Stevenson (23), Waldron (53), and Torrie (49) found no 
association. Height and maturity correlations have shown 
variability: Immer and Stevenson (23), Hayes, et al (18), 

and Torrie (49) reported positive correlations while Goulden

tive correlations and Clark and Hooker (7) no association. 
Maturity and protein content were found positively correlated 
by Clark, et al (6), and Waldron (53) but instances of no 
association were also given by Clark, _et al (6). Weight per 
1000 kernels was found positively correlated with yield by 
Goulden and Neatby (17), Bridgford and Hayes (3), Waldron 
(53), and Laude (32). Maturity and kernel weight were found 
negatively correlated by Goulden and Heatby (17) and Waldron 
(53) while Bridgford and Hayes (3) report a positive rela¬ 
tionship. Height and kernel weight were positively corre¬ 
lated, Goulden and Heathy (17), or not associated, Bridgford

MATERIALS AND METHODS 


Material 

Twenty-seven named varieties and four hybrid lines of 
spring wheat - a total of thirty-one - were used in each 
experiment reported on in this thesis. Over half of the 
varieties have been or are being grown commercially in 
Western Canada; the remainder have been or are being grown 
commercially in the spring wheat area of the United States, 
Russia, Australia, and other important wheat producing 
countries. Two of the hybrid lines - S—615 and S-633 - were 
secured from Dr. 0. H. Erankel, Wheat Breeding Institute, 
Christchurch, Eew Zealand, by the Cereal Division, Dominion 
Experimental Station, Swift Current, Saskatchewan, for use 
as parental material in their wheat breeding program (42). 

The other two hybrid lines were developed as a direct result 
of the intensive breeding program conducted by this department 
these hybrids, 1-28-60 x Kilturum (H-29-35) and Caesium x 
Marquis (H-37-30), will be cited in this thesis by their 
respective hybrid numbers only. 

Experimental Methods 

The methods used in these studies have been described 
by previous workers and need only be briefly outlined. 

Birdsall (2) has described a rapid method of measuring

stomatal lengths of wheat leaves. He used an ocular screw- 
micrometer, magnification approximately 15X, with an 8X 
objective and secured a direct reading of stomatal length 
in microns. He found it most satisfactory to place the fresh 
leaves in water and leave them in a cool chamber for a time 
to ensure complete closure of the stomata. All his measure¬ 
ments were made on the lower surfaces of the leaves with 
reflected light, length being determined as length of the 
guard cells. Birdsall concluded that, by measuring ten 
stomata per leaf on each of five leaves within a variety, 
sufficiently accurate estimates of relative stomatal lengths 
could be secured* 

This method was utilized in the present study with this 
.modification. A trans-leaf sample was taken within 1.5 to 
2 inches of the leaf tip whereas Birdsall took a trans-leaf 
sample near the base. The leaf tip is the region where 
differentiation, maturation, and chlorophyll synthesis are 
first completed (10), and would therefore seem to be the 
more suitable region upon which to base varietal comparisons. 

The method of Platt and Darroch (43) was used to deter¬ 
mine varietal reactions to soil drought. By the use of one- 
gallon glazed crocks, equal portions of air dried soil, a 
uniform number of plants, a uniform supply of moisture, and 
a sawdust mulch to control evaporation, they obtained highly 
significant varietal differences in replicated experiments. 

A period of drought, of two weeks duration commencing from 
the time of permanent wilting, was the usual treatment. At

this time the plants were in the three to four leaf stage. 

These techniques, together with the usual methods of 
conducting field trials, were utilized in these studies. 
Further modifications of any one of them will he outlined 
where they were specifically applied. 

Statistical Methods 

The experimental design utilized in all phases of this 

2 

study was the Balanced Lattice, of the type v = p - p 1 r 
31 varieties. This design permits of six variety replicates 
randomized within 31 incomplete blocks. Yates (59) has 
described this type of Randomized Incomplete Block lay-out. 

Goulden (14) and Weiss and CTox (55) have fully outlined 
the analysis of variance as applied to the data from the 
experiments herein reported. It should be pointed out, 
however, that Yates (60) has recently outlined a method for 
the recovery of inter-block information in these designs. 

The original method has been followed because of greater 
simplicity and because it could be subjected to a direct 
test of significance. 

The necessary difference v/as calculated by the method 
of Weiss and Cox (55)o The value of t at the 5 per cent 
point for residual degrees of freedom was determined from 
Appendix Table I in Hayes and Immer (19). The standard 
error of a difference, calculated from the residual variance 
of an experiment, multiplied by the value of t gave the

difference necessary for significance* 

Cornish (8) has given an example of covariance analysis 
as applied to Balanced Lattice designs. The test of 
significance outlined By Goulden (15) was applied to the 
corrected variance of the dependent variable* 

Hayes and Immer (19) suggest that where percentage data 
are used, if the range is between 25 and 75 per cent, no 
transformation need be applied. The necessity of applying 
a transformation to any percentage data encountered in these 
studies was considered with this range in mind. Ho such 
transformation was found to be necessary. 

A summary of literature revealed that no method of 
determining the significance of variety x experiment inter¬ 
action variance in Balanced Lattice designs had appeared in 
print. Since it is rather useful when comparing the results 
from duplicate or more experiments an appropriate method was 
derived. The grand total for all experiments is used to 
derive an aggregate correction factor; the sum of squares 
for experiments is secured by summating the squared totals of 
each, dividing by the number of plots per experiment, a,nd 
subtracting the aggregate correction factor. The total sum 
of. squares is arrived at in the usual manner using the grand 

p 

total of Sx minus the aggregate correction fax tor. Lew

calculation of the variety means are determined hy summating 
these quantities for each variety over all individual 

experiments, mean variety sum of squares is calculated by 

2 

summating (pTuv - Suv) and dividing by the aggregate number 
of plots. The sums of squares for incomplete blocks and 
residual are derived by addition of these quantities as they 
appear in the individual analyses. The sum of squares formed 
by adding the individual experiment variety sums of squares 
contains the mean variety sum of squares plus the interaction 
sum of squares, the latter is then derived by difference* 

The degrees of freedom for incomplete blocks are the sum of 
those appearing in the individual analyses, the rest are 
derived in the usual manner. These sums of squares and the 
appropriate degrees of freedom are set up in an analysis of 
variance table and the usual computations carried out. The 
author is indebted to Dr. C. R. Goulden, Dominion Rust Research 
Laboratory, Winnipeg, Manitoba., for certain suggestions a.nd 
criticisms while developing this method.

Reaction to Soil Drought 

Methods 

Experiment 1 was conducted in the greenhouses of this 
institution during the period from January to March 1942. In 

# 

this experiment seedling leaf stomatal length and drought 
survival of the 31 varieties were studied. The soil used 
was an Edmonton loam with an approximate wilting point of 
12 per cent. Equal amounts of this soil, screened, well 
mixed, and of known moisture content, were weighed into 
one-gallon glazed crocks. Twenty plants were established 
in each crock. A moisture content of 25 per cent was 
maintained until the twelfth day after seeding, when a 
sawdust mulch (125 grams) was applied; no further moisture 
was then added. Permanent wilting occurred 14 days after 
mulching and an interval of 36 days elapsed after wilting 
before the mulch was removed and watering resumed. Survival 
notes were taken ten days after the application of moisture 


had been resumed

Experiment 2 was conducted in the greenhouses of the 
Dominion Experimental Station, Swift Current, during Hay 
and June 1942. This experiment was similar to Experiment 1 
in purpose and in most details. A Haverhill loam with a 9 
per cent wilting point was used. The moisture content was 
kept at 31 per cent for the first 11 days after seeding; then 
the sawdust mulch was applied and watering was discontinued. 
Permanent wilting occurred 12 days later and moisture was 
again applied 15 days after wilting. The notes on survival 
were recorded six days from the recommencement of watering. 

With both experiments survival notes were taken by 
scoring the individual plants. A numerical index, ranging 

from zero for a dead plant to four for one which showed little 

» 

foliar loss, was found to be satisfactory. The replicate 

percentage values, as used in the analyses of variance, were 

obtained by the use of the formula: 

Total crock score x 25 = percentage survival. 

Number of plants

The data on the soil drought reactions of the 31 var¬ 
ieties are presented in Table I. The percentage survivals 
are given for the individual experiments, the varieties being 
arranged in order of decreasing mean survival. The results 
of the analyses of variance for the individual experiments 
are presented in Table II, and the results for the multiple 
variance analysis in Table III®

Figure 1 shows the extremes of damage found in Experiment 
2. Prior to photographing the dead leafage was removed to 
allow for greater clarity of detail. 

Variety variance is highly significant in each of the 
three variance analyses. The mean range of 36 per cent, four 
times the necessary difference, demonstrates the magnitude 
of the varietal differences. 

The significant variety x experiment interaction indi¬ 
cates that not all varieties reacted alike in the two exper¬ 
iments'. In general it can he said that the mean variety 
ranking agreed with that in the individual experiments; 
variety variance significantly exceeded interaction variance, 
giving an F value of 3-75. The fact that opposite conditions 
of humidity, light intensity, and temperature were encount¬ 
ered in these two experiments may account, in part, for the 
interaction. Platt and Darroch (43) reported a similar 
interaction effect in earlier studies.

Available Soil Moisture 


Methods 

In Experiment 1 the moisture content of the soil in each 
crock was noted at the beginning and end of the drought 
period. Thus it was possible to determine, by difference, 
the amount of water removed by the plants during the entire 
drought period. The reductions, in grams of water per crock, 
were treated statistically by an analysis of variance. 

Comparable data were obtained for Experiment 2. 

Results 

The results of the analyses of variance are presented 
in Table IY. In Experiment 1 the soil moisture content was 
reduced from 25 per cent to 14.4 per cent, amounting to a 
decrease of 354 grams of water. There was a greater amount 
of moisture used in Experiment 2 and the moisture content 
dropped from 30.9 per cent to 9.4 per cent; this represents 
a loss of 882 grams of water. The mean values only are 
presented for each experiment because tabulation of variety 
values was not warranted. 

Variety variance did not significantly exceed residual 
variance in either experiment. The incomplete blocks 
accounted for the major portion of the total variation in 
each experiment. 

Briggs and Shantz [4] have reported that they found no 
evidence of a differential varietal capacity for obtaining

soil moisture. Further they concluded that the amount of 
moisture unavailable depended solely upon soil type. Both 
of these statements hold true in the present experiments. 
Therefore these results demonstrate that survival differences 
are not due to any varietal differences in the amount of 
water removed from the soil during a period of drought.

Agronomic Results 


Llethods 

Experiment 3 was conducted at Edmonton in the experi¬ 
mental field maintained by this department* It consisted 
of single row plots 18.5 feet long, the rows being srjaced 
one foot apart. Rotes on days to head, days to mature, 
and plant height were recorded in the field. Yield per 
16.5 foot row was recorded and treated by analysis of 
variance. Protein content and 1000 kernel weight were 
determined from a composite sample of each variety. 

A similar experiment, Experiment 4, ?<ras grown by the 
Cereal Division, Dominion Experimental Station, Swift Current. 
The characters listed above for Experiment 3 were also 
recorded for this experiment. 

Results 

The data secured in each experiment, together with the 
variety mean values, are presented in Table V. Analyses of 
variance of the yield data, in grams per plot, are presented 
in Table VI for the individual experiments; a multiple 
analysis of these data is presented in Table VII. The inter- 
experiment correlations for the other five characters are 
presented in Table VIII. 

Variety variance for the yields at Edmonton and at Swift 
Current is highly significant (Table VI}. The presence of a 
significant interaction (Table VII) between the yields from

the two tests is sufficient to render mean variety variance 
insignificant when tested against interaction variance; an 
]? value of 1.58 was obtained. Yields were very high at both 
points with a mean of 52.4 bushels per acre being recorded 
for all varieties grown in the two experiments. 

The data on days to head and to mature, height, protein 
content, and 1000 kernel weight are presented without statis¬ 
tical treatment. Varietal differences were recorded for all 
of these characters and these differences, undoubtedly, 
would be significant in all cases. The high values of the 
correlations reported in Table VIII show a very close agree¬ 
ment between the values recorded in the individual experiments.

The data on this character were obtained from the five 
Experiments 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 in which measurements were made 
on the seedling leaves. In addition, for two of these five, 
Experiments 4 and 5, measurements were also made on the flag 
leaves. The methods employed and the results obtained will 
be discussed separately for the tY/o leaf stages.

the seedling leaves were collected over a five day period 
immediately after watering was discontinued. The plants were 
then in the two to early three leaf stage. Five leaves were 
taken at random from each crock. These were removed, placed 
in water, and stored in a cold chamber (40° F.) for an hour 
or more before being examined. Measurements were made on the 
fresh leaves, ten stomata being measured per leaf. The 50 
measurements per crock were tabulated and their average va,lues 
used in an analysis of variance. 

The data for Experiment 2 were assembled, in much the 
same manner as for Experiment 1. In this instance a cold, 
chamber was not available but a cool dark cupboard was found 
to be equally satisfactory. The lengths of ten stomata on 
each of five leaves, taken at rand.om, were record.ed per crock. 

The leaf collections for Experiment 4 were taken in 
much the same manner as for the two experiments just outlined« 
One change was made however. Ten plants per row were staked 
out and, retaining individual plant Identity, the seedling 
leaf was removed, from each. The lengths of ten stomata were 
measured per leaf and the resulting 100 measurements were 
averaged, for use in the analysis of variance. It will be 
recalled that this was a field experiment grown at Swift 
Current-. (See the section "Agronomic Results”.). 

Experiment 5 was a greenhouse experiment. Equal amounts 
of soil of known moisture content were planed in the crocks. 
Ten plants were established per §rock. As in Experiment 4 
the ten seedling leaves were collected in such a manner as

to retain plant identity. The measuring of ten stomata per 
leaf gave a crock average based on 100 measurements. 

Experiment 6 was a greenhouse experiment conducted in 
the same manner and, originally, for the same purpose as 
Experiments 1 and 2. Six leaves, per crock of twelve plants, 
were collected and ten stomata measured per leaf* Therefore 
replicate averages were based on 60 measurements. The cold, 
chamber, as reported for Experiment 1, was used in this 
experiment. 

In all of the five experiments outlined above leaf 
collections were made according to a plan based on statis¬ 
tical considerations. All of the leaves from all of the six 
varieties in an incomplete block were collected at one time 
and were measured by one operator. By this means incomplete 
block variance v/ould remove possible systematic errors. 

Hesuits - The seedling leaf stomatal lengths, in microns, 
for all of the 31 varieties in each of the five experiments 
are presented in Table IX, the varieties being listed in order 
of decreasing mean stomatal length. The results for the 
individual analyses of variance are presented in Table X, and 
the results of a multiple analysis for the five experiments 
in Table XI. The ten possible inter-experiment correlation 
coefficients calculated from the data in Table IX are presented 
in Table XII. 

Variety variance was highly significant in every experi¬ 
ment and for the average of the five experiments. All of

these experiments are uniform in that their residual variances 
are very small and both variety and incomplete block variances 
were always highly significant. In all cases the range in 
length is very small, varying from 9 to 11 microns in individ¬ 
ual experiments, with the range of the means being 8 microns. 
At the same time the range was usually four or more times 
greater than the corresponding necessary difference. 

The multiple analysis presented in Table XI reveals 
that there was a significant variety x experiment interaction. 
This did not materially alter the significance of variety 
variance because, when interaction variance replaced residual 
variance for testing significance, a highly significant F 
value of 18.08 was obtained. The necessary difference in 
the ’mean’ column of Table IX was calculated from interaction 
variance. The variance due to experiments was highly signi¬ 
ficant but as the greatest deviation of the mean of any 
experiment from the general mean was only 1.6 microns environ¬ 
mental factors seemingly had little influence on the magnitude 
of stomatal length. 

The uniformity in the size of the inter-experiment 
correlation coefficients presented in Table XII is striking. 
They are all highly significant and of sufficient magnitude 
to indicate good agreement between any two of the individual 
trials.

Flap, Leaves 

Methods - In Experiment 4 the flag leaves were collected 
from the ten plants in each row which were marked as having been 
included in the seedling leaf samples. The collections were 
made after all of the varieties had headed. This was actually 
later than desired because some losses occurred in the earlier 
varieties where hot winds had caused premature leaf maturation. 
This loss rarely exceeded five leaves per row. The average 
stomatal length per row, allowing for reduced numbers when 
necessary, was used in an analysis of variance. Owing to 
exigencies of time and transportation it was necessary to 
collect the leaves, preserve them, and measure the stomatal 
lengths at a later date. To this end the leaves were placed 
in a formalin - acetic acid - ethyl alcohol solution as they 
were collected and stored in this for three months before the 
measurements were taken. This procedure did not appear to 
affect the results obtained. 

The greenhouse material, Experiment 5, was handled in the 
fresh condition. Leaf collections were commenced when the 
first varieties had headed and were made on a variety basis 
throughout this experiment. As in Experiment 4 plant identity 
was retained. Again some plant losses occurred; these were 
caused chiefly by wireworm activity in the crocks after the 
seedling leaf collections had been made. The average stomatal 
length per crock was used in an analysis of variance. 

The flag leaves of these two experiments developed under

markedly different conditions. Experiment 4 was grown in the 
field at Swift Current under excellent growing conditions. 
Uoisture was plentiful throughout the grov/ing season and 
extremes of temperature were not encountered. The environment 
of Experiment 5 differed from that of Experiment 4 not only 
in that plants were grown under greenhouse conditions but 
also by the fact that once the plants were established soil 
moisture was kept at as low a level as possible by very 
sparing application at infrequent intervals. The usual 
evidences of drought were noted for the plants of all varieties, 
e.g., a very heavy coating of wax or T bloom r on the leaves 
and stems, a marked reduction in plant height, small leaves, 
and semi-sterility of the heads when they developed. 

Results - Table XIII presents the findings on the variety 
flag leaf stomatal lengths as affected by the two conditions; 
the differences in length between unfavourable and favourable 
conditions determined the order of listing the varieties. The 
results of the individual and of the multiple analyses of 
variance ar e presented in Table XIV and XV respectively. 

Variety variance was significantly greater than residual 
variance for each of the analyses included in Tables XIV and 
XV. The mean variety variance (Table XV) was insignificant 
when tested against the significant interaction variance, an 
E value of only .67 being obtained. 

The data in Table XIII show some marked differences 
between these experiments. Eor Experiment 4 the magnitude of

the range in length and of the necessary difference, 11 and 
1.8 microns respectively, were in line with those to be 
expected from the results obtained for measurements on the 
seedling leaves. These expectations were not met by the 
results of Experiment 5, here the range and the necessary 
difference were both much larger, being 23 and 5.7 microns 
respectively. The difference in length between experiments 
was highly significant with the general mean length produced 
under arid conditions being 5.6 microns greater than under 
humid conditions. 

This latter result is distinctly at variance with the 
results of others. All other workers have found that lengths 
of stomata v/ere less when the plants were subjected to drought. 
A partial explanation for the present results may be found 
in a consideration of the effect of light since one experiment 
was grown in the greenhouse and the other in the field.

Stomatal Length Reduction i n i-er Gent 

Methods - The data for average stomatal lengths from the 
seedling and flag leaves of Experiments 4 and 5 were used to 
compute the values considered in this section. In the review 
of literature it was revealed that several workers (20, 45, 

58, 61J reported a gradient in stomatal length within the plant, 
the greatest length occurring on the lowest leaf. With this 
in mind the seedling leaf stomatal length was considered as 
the maximum length and the reduction to length of stomata on 
the flag leaves calculated as a percentage of the maximum 
length. The replicate averages were substituted in the 
formula: 

Seedling length - Elag length x 100 = per cent length reduction 
Seedling length 

These percentage values were treated by means of an analysis 
of variance. No transformations of the percentage data were 
made since these cannot be classified as discrete data (5). 

Results - The variety mean values, for the percentage stomatal 
length reductions between the seedling and flag leaves in 
Experiments 4 and 5, are presented in Table XVI. The varieties 
are listed by their difference, in percentage reduction, 
between the two experiments. Analyses of variance of the 
individual experiments and of a multiple for the two experi¬ 
ments are presented in Tables XVII and XVIII, respectively. 

The individual analyses in Table XVII show variety 
variance to be highly significant. Variety variance also

significantly exceeds residual variance in Table XVIII. 

However when variety variance was tested against the signi¬ 
ficant interaction variance, Table XVIII, a non-significant 
E value ox .87 was obtained. The interaction may be 
partially evaluated from the difference 1 column in Table XVI. 

The two experiments show marked differences in the 
amount of length reduction exhibited by individual varieties 
under the two environmental conditions. In Experiment 4 the 
extremes form a range of 16 per cent, from a low of 22 per 
cent to a high of 58 per cent length reduction. In Experiment 
5 the range is 35 per cent, from a low of 10 per cent to a 
maximum of 45 per cent. The mean percentage reduction was 
significantly less when the flag leaves were developed under 
the dry conditions of Experiment 5.

Interrelationships 

The data from the foregoing sections form the basis for 
the results presented in this section. To a part of these 
data covariance analyses were applied, and to the rest the 
methods of simple, partial, and multiple correlation. 

Covariance Analyses 

Certain of the experiments reported in this thesis were 
set up to study specific relationships. This fact suggests 
that more information might be obtained by analyses of 
covariance than is usually secured by the method of simple 
correlation. The data from Experiments 1 and 2 for seedling 
leaf stomatal length and soil drought survival and from 
Experiments 4 and 5 for seedling leaf and flag leaf stomatal 
lengths were therefore subjected to analyses of covariance. 
The results obtained are presented in the two sections 
immediately following. 

Seedling Leaf Stomatal Length and Soil Drought Survival 

Eor each of Experiments 1 and 2 the mean replicate (crock) 
values for seedling leaf stomatal length in microns and soil 
drought survival in per cent, were utilized in a covariance 
analysis. The results of these analyses are presented in 
Tables XIX and XX. Table XXI presents a test of significance 
of the regression coefficient for percentage survival on 
seedling leaf stomatal length calculated from the mean values 
of the two experiments. Scatter diagrams plotted from the

variety means of the two characters in Experiments 1 and 2 
and their two-experiment means are presented in Figures 2, 

3, and 4, respectively* 

The results of the analysis are similar in both cases. 
Regression was significantly different within and between 
varieties, therefore to adjust the survival percentages for 
their regression on stomatal length only the regression 
within varieties should be used. The regression lines shown 
in Figures 2 and 3 were drawn using the variety regression 
coefficients. The variety differences in survival are only 
partially explained by differences in seedling leaf stomatal 
length. 

The significance of the correlation coefficients are 
indicated in the respective tables. In Experiment 2 and for 
the means of the tY7o experiments there was a significant, 
negative correlation between survival and stomatal length.

Seedling and Flag Lear Stomtal Lengths - Covariance 
analyses were applied to the data of Experiments 4 and 5 to 
examine the relation between the seedlin , and flag leaf 
stomatal lengths. The results of these analyses are presented 
in Tables XXII and XXIII. Figures 5 and 6 are scatter 
diagrams prepared from the variety means for the two characters 
in Experiments 4 and 5 respectively. 

The results presented demonstrate that there is no signi¬ 
ficant reduction in the variance due to flag leaf stomatal 
length when the variance due to its regression on seedling 
leaf stomatal length is removed. In Experiment 4 the regress¬ 
ions within and between varieties are significantly different 
while in Experiment 5 these differences are insignificant. 

The scatter diagrams provide little additional informa¬ 
tion although Figure 6 suggests a non-linear relation between 
the two stomatal lengths.

T. 63 * QI Curvilinearity - As noted in the -receding section 
the data plotted in Figure 6 a 

ship is not necessarily linear. 

Snedecor (48) outlines a method for testing curvilincarity 
which is readil: to an;' • i cated ... A 

second independent variable is derived by utilizing some 
arithmetic conversi i ;inal independent variable# 

In these experiments seedling leaf stomata! length is the 
index>endent variable and the second independent was derived by 
taking the square root of the .individual values. The seedling 
leaf stomatal length, its square root, and the flag leaf 
stomatal length were analyzed by the method of partial 
regressions as outlined by Crampton and Hopkins (9). The 
significance of the reduction in the amount of residual 
variance due to the quadratic effect is tested by comparing 
the ratio of the quadratic residual variance to that of the 
difference between the linear and quadratic residual variances 
(48, p• o22 )o 

This test of curvilinearity was applied to the stomatal 
data of Experiments 4 and 5 and the results are presented in 
Table XXIV. 

There was a significant deviation from linearity in the 
data of Experiment 5 as evidenced by the highly significant 
E value. Experiment 4 shows no departure from linearity. The 
proof of non-linearity does not alter any statements made in 
preceding sections but the original covariance analysis as

Flag leaf stomatal length was subject to a distinct inter 
action effect within Experiments 4 and 5. In order to utilize 
these data for correlation studies it was necessary to work 
with the data L experiments. The correlations 

presented in Table XXV summarize the results obtained. Apart 
from those characters covered by the footnote to the table, 
the data used were the sane as in the followin', section. 

The correlation coefficients presented in Table XXVI were 
"within variety" correlations calculated from the data of 
Experiment 5. Individual plant identities were retained 
throughout Experiments 4 and 5 insofar as seedling and flag 
leaf stomatal lengths were concerned. By using the individual 
plant as the basis of pairing and ignoring the factor of 
replicates, a possible of 60 pairs per variety was available 
for calculating a correlation coefficient. The loss of flag 
leaf data in Experiment 4 reduced the number of pairs avail¬ 
able for certain varieties to a lower level than desirable; 
therefore none of the data from this test were used. 

Some of the correlations established were rather surpris¬ 
ing, the absence of others still more so. 

In Table XXV the inverse relation between length and the 
percentage length reduction of the stomata demonstrates that, 
while in themselves the percentage reductions are of interest, 
an evaluation of the differences between the two lengths will 
provide essentially the same information because the length

reduction is largely dependent upon flag leaf stomatal length. 
The correlations between seedling leaf stomatal length and 
the percentage length reduction were positive and significant 
to the 5 per it, being »412 and *424 for Experiments 

4 and 5 respectively. 

When plants developed under the normal conditions of 
Experiment 4 the flag leal* stomatal lengths were negatively 
correlated with time rarity ana with soil drought survival. 

In contrast, when developed under the arid conditions of 
Experiment 5, they were positively correlated with these same 
characters and with 1000 kernel weight. Hone of the other 
correlations were significant although the tendency towards 
opposite sign continues. 

There is a distinct and rather surprising laci: of signi¬ 
ficance when see leaf stomatal lengths are corre¬ 

lated. In Table XXV environment produced a change in sign 
but no significant relation when the variety means were corre¬ 
lated. Three statistically significant correlation coefficients 
were obtained when the "within variety" correlations were 
calculated for Experiment 5 (Table XXVI). Other than that 
there is no evidence of a consistent relationship between the 
stomatal lengths of the two leaf levels, no conclusion can be 


drawn•

General ., : ’lant Character Corral ions 

The correlation coefficients presented in Table XXVII v/ere 
calculated from the variety means of Tables I, V and IX. The 

*s correlated are soil drought survival, seedling leaf 
stomatal length, plant height, days to nead and to mature, 
protein content and 1000 kernel weight. 

Soil drought survival was significantly correlated with 
several characters; positively with days to head, days to 
mature, and 1000 kernel weight, negatively with protein content 
and seedling leaf stomatal length. Seedling leaf stomatal 
length was positively correlated with protein content and 
negatively with days to mature. Days to head and days to 
mature were both positively correlated with plant height and 
highly correlated with each other. Protein content was 
negatively correlated with 1000 kernel weight.

Total correlations betv/een yield and the agronomic 
characters, i.e., , ad, days to nature, 

protein content, and 1000 hernel weight, are presented in the 
first portion of Table XXVIII. In the second part of the 
same table the yields are correlated with (a) the mean drought 
survival percents ;es of le I, (b) the mean sc . leaf 

stomatal lengths of Table IX, and (c) the flag leaf 3tomatal 
lengths of the individual experiments as presented in Table 
XIII. The yiel s individual experiments were 

used for the purpose of correlation because of the high 
interaction and consequent non-significance of the mean yields 
(Table VII). The ssa.e condition occurred in the flag leaf 
stomatal length data (Table XV). 

The yields in Experiment 3 were positively correlated 
with only two other characters - plant height and the flag 
leaf stomatal lengths of Experiment 5. ITo significant negative 
correlations were established. 

The yield data of Experiment 4 gave significant correla¬ 
tions in the majority of cases. Yield was positively correlated 
with height, days to head, days to mature, drought survival, 
and with the flag leaf stomatal length of Experiment 5. 
negative correlations were recorded when either _ rotein content 
or seedling .leaf stomatal lengths were correlated with yield. 

The negative correlation between yield and the flag leaf 
stomatal lengths of Experiment 4 approaches significance.

Yield the Dependent in I-artial Correlations 

The simple, first, and fourth order partial correlation 
coefficients and a multiple correlation coefficient for yield 
correlated with survival, days to head, rotein content, 
seedling leaf stomatal length, and height are presented in 
Table XXIX. The secon third order partials were not 

calculated as it was felt that they would provide little 
additional information. 

These characters were selected because of their signi¬ 
ficant correlations with yield in Table XXVIII. Only the 
yield data of Experiment 4 were used. The simple correla¬ 
tions beween yield and the mean values for height, protein 
content, and days to heac ..ere calculated and .this explains 
the discrepancies between the values reported in Tables 
XXVIII and XXIX. This was done in order to utilize the values 
for the other plant character relationships (presented in 
Table XXVII). 

Yield is positively correlated with survival. The 
association is decreased when considered independent of 
protein content, stomatal len th, or height and beco: as 
negligible when considered independent of days to head. There 
is no association between yield and survival when considered 
independent of the four remaining variables. 

Yield and days to head are positively correlated. The 
relation remains the same v/hen it is considered independent 
of protein content or stomatal length but the association is

.decreased when considered Independent of survival or height* 
Considered independent of all four <js the correlation 

between yield and days to head was non-significant. 

The association between yield and protein content is 
improved when considered independent of height but non¬ 
significant when any one of the three reroainin ; characters or 
all four were considered* 

The negative relation between yield and seedling leaf 
stomatal length is unchanged or only slightly decreased . en 
considered independent of an; one of the other four variables 
but is not significant when all four are treated collectively. 

Height and yield are positively correlated. This rela¬ 
tion is improved when considered independent of protein 
content but is decreased to non-significant levels when con¬ 
sidered independent of any of the other three or of all four 
characters• 

The multiple correlation coefficient was calculated for 
yield dependent on these five cliara,cters, survival, days to 
head, protein content, stomatal length, and height, and was 
found to be highly significant. 

This section reveals that the effects of each of these 
characters, while asso i tec ith yield tc some degree, must 
also be somewhat independent. This is shown by the fact that 
R is considerably higher than any component* Despite this the 
total portion of yield variability which can be explained by 
the variability in these yield factors is only about 52 per 
cent (*72o 2 x 100}. The value of these characters in making

DISCUSSION 


The results obtained from a study of eight ciiaracter 3 
in 31 varieties and lines of spring wheat are i^reoented in 
this thesis* While isolated studies have been reported in 
which the relatiox of certain of these characters were 

investigated, there is no record of any previous study in 
which all of these characters have been investigated v^ith 
one lot ox material* 

The data presented are fairly representative of what 
may be expected, with t:.e exception of yield. The yield 
data are admittedly inadequate and the further complication 
of abnormally high yields with a high degree of interaction 
makes their usefulness in correlations rather questionable. 

The yield data of Experiment 4 are fairly typical of the 
yielding abilities of individual varieties and as a consequ¬ 
ence their correlations with other characters may be of some 
value. 

The strengths of the various relationships were, in all 
cases, evaluated by means of simple correlation coefficients* 
many of the coefficients were significant statistically but 
their practical significances cannot be measured by the same 
criterion* To be of practical value they would need to be 
very high, from .35 up. Such correlations are rare in biolo¬ 
gical material unless the characters are linked genetically 
or physiologically* Only in one case in these studies did

such a correlation occur; that between days to head and uaya 
to mature v/as .yu, here the relation is physiological and 
rather close. The ;ree of dependence to be placed on a 
correlation is r restricted by considering the number 

into its calculation* In thi 
number (31) is at the lower limit of dependability . That 
more varieties or lines were not used is unfortunate, but to 
have done so would have meant unduly prolongin • the entire 
study and at the same time postponing even a preliminary 
evaluation of the several methods. 

As a basis for the selection of high yielding types 
seedling leaf stomatal length shows some promise. Since it 
is negatively correlated with yield the selection of plants 
or lines with shorter stomata 'would remove a proportion of 
the lower yielding lines in early generations. One feature 
of this character which would be of considerable importance 
is that it cannot be measurably influenced by environment. 

All the available evidence supports this conclusion; studies by 
Sande-Bakhuyzen (46), Birdsall (2), and those included in this 
report are all in agreement. The reason for this is fairly 
evident and has already been pointed out (46), - the seedling 
leaf characters are almost exclusively predetermined by 
embryonic development. 

The use of stomatal length as a means of selection has 
certain disadvantages. To begin with, the character is micro¬ 
scopic in size and for speedy determination requires a special¬ 
ized ocular attachment for the ordinary microscope. Of such

atlacj—juts relatively few are available in Canada* The varia¬ 
tion in length n and between plants would require that at 

least 25-5u stomata per plant be measured if individual plants 
were being used, while with lines it would be necessary to 
easure ten stomata on et . ten or more leaves* The amount 
of work involve. ests tint it would be of limited applica¬ 

tion. A further limitation is imposed by the extremely 
ranee in length displayed by these otherwise widely different 
varieties; this would mean that only plants approaching 
either limit could be classified with any degree of certainty. 
These limits would vary with the material bein ; examined. 

In contrast to that of the seedling leaf the character of 
stomatal length on the flag leaves holds little x remise of 
serving any very usefi ose. Dependent on the c nditione 

under which the leaves develop negative or positive correlations 
with yield and with maturity can he readily demonstrated. 

It is obvious that a character so markedly influenced by environ 
mental conditions would have little or no value as a medium 
for selecting high yielding types. 

The simplicity of the soil drought survival method is 
emphasizes. Che equipment necessary is available in any green¬ 
house. A large nu_.ber of plants may be han 
work, and the positive relation 1 stweei i i 

suggests that the yield level of any population might be raised 
using this method of selection. Offsettinj these obvious 
advantages of the method is the rather strong positive relation 
between survival and maturity. If the net result were to

select the later maturing plants, as indicated by the simple 
and partial correlations, then the method iails in its intended 
purpose of.selecting for yieldin : ability under dry conditions 
and becomes merely a device for eliminating the earlier matur¬ 
ing lines. That this is the effect is suggested by the partial 
correlation coefficient r l2o 3 (Table XXIX). 

In wheat breeding it is necessary to determine -rotein 
content in order to produce varieties acceptable to the baking 
trade. In evaluat: ive relationship with 

yield should receive consideration. Since there can be no 
compromise with satisfactory quality low protein lines must 
be discarded regardless of yielding ability. On the other 
hand lines having very high protein might also be discarded as 
such lines are unlikely to have suitable yielding ability. As 
it is impractical to determine the protein content of material 
in early generations this method is most likely to prove use¬ 
ful as a selecting agent when used in conjunction with some 
other method which can be applied to the earlier generations, 
e.g., stomatal length or soil drought survival. 

Maturity and yield appear to be positively associated in 
this and other studies. This factor is not always considered 
when hybrid populations are being worked over. 7/hile late 
maturing lines appear to be the highest yielding the; have 
agronomic disadvantages that usually outv/eigh the e;:tra yield.

leases* It is therefore neoessary to find the high yielding 
early types that do ex • 3uo nes are li):ely to be diffi¬ 
cult to locate and any assistance that can be rendered by the 
use of such .ers as stomatal length should prove valuable. 

The interest in maturity is not limited to its possible 
usefulness for selection purposes* As a result of the positive 
correlation between maturity and survival, interest is aroused 
in certain physiological its of the problem, ,/aldron (52) 

found that the earlier spring wheats were more susceptible to 
frost, and, when judged by yield under semi-arid conditions, 
more susceptible to drought. The influence of earliness was 
observed by Platt (41) in studies on the artificial frost 
reaction of wheat, oat, and barley seedlings - here again the 
early maturing varieties being the more susceptible. On the 
basis of these and other results the prevalent opinion ;Ls that 
the present program of wheat improvement has resulted in an 
increased susceptibility to frost, and, if the analogy is borne 
out, to drought. The relation between these physiological 
characters for resistance has never been investigated although 
the same inference appears repeatedly in the literature, that 
they are positively and closely correlated, './ith the amount 
of theoretical knowledge now available in respect to frost 
resistance and the nature of frost injury the knowledge on 
drought resistance might be greatly augmented if a detailed 
study could be made relatin these . 

Another feature which is of pronounced interest was that,

v/as determined using seedling plants. In neither case were 
there discernible differences in t c eta e of ut when 

the treatment was com need. If mat • . influences the 

results obtained there may be either embryonic or proto lasmic 
differences in development even at this early phase of plant 
growth. That such dif in maturation may occur is not 

unlikely, but it is r. ther difficult to conceive of these 
rather minor differences playing such an im.ortant part in 
determining seedling resistance. This may be another avenue 
for future research. 

The use of a combined selection program may be an advan¬ 
tage in breeding wheat for drought resistance. Prom the result 
obtained for a multiple correlation of the five characters 
soil drought survival, protein content, maturity, height, and 
seedling stomatal len t] , with yield as the dependent character, 
it can be shown that a considerable proportion of low yielding 
material might be removed. To assess the value of the multiple 
correlation Szekiel (12) used its square as an estimate of the 
proportion of the variance for the dependent variable which ~ay 
be accounted for by the removal of the independent variables. 
Using this criterion 52 per cent of the yield variance was 
accounted for; this suggests that by making an effort to utilize 
these variables as implements of selection in early generations, 
the search for high yielding lines might be narrowed down con¬ 
siderably. Since selection for disease resist is not con¬ 

sidered in the above there would obviously be a substantial 
reduction in the amount of material left to be carried in

Twenty-seven varieties and four hybrid lines of spring 
wheat were studied in a series of six greenhouse and field 
experiments. Each experiment was laid out as a Balanced 
Lattice (7 s p 6 - p♦ 1 s 31) which permits of six variety 
replicates randomized within 31 incomplete blochs. 

Three of the greenhouse experiments were set u to 
determine the relation betv/een seedling leaf stonatal length 
and soil drought survival. Of these, two were successfully 
completed, while only stomatal lengt.. was recorded for the 
third one. Highly'significant varietal differences were 
recorded for both characters an is a significant neg-

ative correlation between them. 

Two field trials were conducted, one at Edmonton and one 
at Swift Current. From both of these experiments data on yield, 
maturity, height, protein content, and 1000 kernel weight were 
obtained. The variation in yields of the individual experi¬ 
ments was highly significant but variation in mean yields did 
not significantly exceed the interaction. 

The relation between seedling and flag leaf storaatal 
lengths was studied in two experiments. In a fourth green¬ 
house experiment the flag leaves were developed under conditions 
of extreme soil drought. The yield trial at Swift Current 
provided the second set of data; the flag leaves here developed 
under favourable moisture conditions. Significant differences 
in length were established within each experiment for each of 
the two leaf levels but the mean flag stomatal lengths were 
insignificant when tested against the interaction. The genetical 
relationship between the stomatal lengths of the two leaves 
appears to have been completely obscured by the influence of 
environment. 

Correlations with yield data from individual trials are 
hazardous but in the present study they bear out the results 
of earlier investigations. Yield was positively correlated 
with soil drought survival, height, and maturity; and negatively 
correlated with protein content and seedling leaf sto.oatal 
length. A partial correlation between yield and survival 
independent of maturity suggests that the relation between 
yield and survival, as indicated by the simple correlation, is 
largely dependent upon differences in maturity.

Soil drought survival and time of maturity are positively 
correlated* 

Protein content is positively correlated with seodlin^; 
leal stomatal length and negatively correlated with survival 
ancl with 1000 kernel vie:, .at* 

maturity ma^ be satisfactorily evaluated from either days 
to head or days co mature* there is a high positive correla¬ 
tion Detween tnem when weather conditions favour normal ripen¬ 
ing. 

Flag leaf stomatal lengths are influenced by environment 
to a considerable extent. The flag leaf stomatal lengths of 
plants grown under favourable conditions were negatively 
correlated with maturity and soil drought survival, the 
negative relation with yield approaching significance. The 
flag leaves'of plants grown under arid conditions had stoma tal 
lengths which were positively correlated with maturity, soil 
drought survival, 1000 kernel weight, and yield, further work 
with this character is not warranted. 

ITo advantage was derived from the use of covariance 
analyses. The data for soil drought survival and flag leaf 
stomatal length as dependent upon seedling leaf stomatal 
length were analyzed by this method. In no case did the 
removal of the proportion of variance due to seedling leaf 
stomatal length make any appreciable difference in the signifi¬ 
cance of the dependent variable. Only in one of the four 
analyses was the res .osion coefficient not signifi¬ 

cant! y different from the variety regression coefficient. In

Seedling leaf stomatal length is not significantly
