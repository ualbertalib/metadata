In the course of an investigation using a cold 
quartz mercury lamp and a quartz vacuum type silver photo¬ 
cell, evidence was found by Langstroth et al. (unpublished 
that the photo-effective radiation was aj^preciably absorbe( 
along an atmospheric path and that the degree of absorption 
depended to a marked extent upon the partial pressure of 
water vapour. In atmospheric air the amplified resj)onse of 
the photocell varied more rapidly with distance than expec¬ 
ted on the basis of the inverse square law. furthermore, 
with a path length of 50 cm. saturation of the air with 
water vapour at room temperature reduced the response to 
about 16 % of the value found with the same path length of 
dry air. 

This thesis is primarily concerned with the study of 
the absorption by air and water vapour of the radiation 
effective in this combination of lamp and photocell. In 
addition to determining the extent to which the radiation 
was absorbed by-these gases, it seemed desirable to ascer¬ 
tain the wavelength of each effective line and its contri-! 
bution to the total photoelectric response. 

In the method chosen the lamp and photocell were 
mounted in an evacuable steel chamber such that the amp¬ 
lified photoelectric current could be measured at atmos-

pheric and reduced pressures of absorbing gases over a 
range of path lengths up to nearly one meter. Measurements 
were made of the absorption of the radiation by moist ano. 
dry air, water vapour, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Result i 
of these tests, supplemented by spectrographic data., were 
sufficient to provide a fairly complete description of the 
behaviour of this combination. 

The action of a selectively absorbing gas in reducing 
the photoelectric current is complex if the effective 
radiation is heterochromatic. The governing factors of thi ; 
action are: (a) the relative contribution of each effective 
wavelength and (b) the absorption coefficient of the inter¬ 
vening gas at each of these wavelengths. The former depend 
upon the intensity of radiation and the photoelectric sens: 
tivity for each of the effective wavelengths, the latter 
upon the absorption spectrum of the gas under consideration 
In the following paragraphs a discussion of these factors 
is given on the basis of previous knowledge. 

The cold quartz mercury lamp used was a Mineralight 

model V-44, a type used by prospectors in the location of 

fluorescent ores. A photograph of the spectrum of an 

unspecified low pressure quartz mercury arc has been pub- 
1 

lished by Ewell , and shows a strong -line at 1850A, a 

fainter one at 1942A and no others of shorter wavelength 

than the intense group of lines centred at 2537A. It is 
probable that 1850A is the shortest wavelength radiated

by a quartz mercury lamp . There was reason to believe 

that this line was fairly intense in the Mineralight 

radiation since a strong odour of ozone was produced, in 

3 

air. Rentschier and Uagy have found that the amount of 
ozone produced by a mercury vapour lamp is proportional 
to the intensity concentrated in the radiation at 1942 
and 1850A and suggest that the action of 1S50A is predom¬ 
inant . 

The spectral sensitivity curve of the specially 

designed quartz silver photocell used is unknown. This 

cell gave only' a negligibly small response to radiation 

from a General Electric 4-watt germicidal lamp, less than 

3% of the response to the radiation from the Mineralight. 

The former source is in an envelope of special glass 

which does not transmit much below 2300A. The intensity of! 

the 2537A radiation is comparable for both sources (see 

plate II). It follows that the photocell has an appreciably 

sensitivity for radiation below 2537A only. This conclusio] 

4 

is in accord with the finding of Winch that the spectral 
sensitivity curve for outgassed silver approaches a 
threshold at 2600A tangent to the wavelength axis, but 
-rises steeply from about 2400A to the lowest wavelength 
investigated (2200A). 

There is ample evidence that some of the radiation 
from a cold quartz mercury lamp is absorbed by air. Ewell

has shown*" ^ means of a platinum photocell and variation 


of the path length that the radiation at 1850 and 1942A 

is rapidly absorbed by air and estimates a value for the 

extinction coefficient of 0*023 cm • Atmospheric air is 

generally considered to be transparent for spectrographic 

purposes down to 2000A. litrogen alone has been found by 
5 

Lyman to be transparent down to 1450A so that oxygen is 
regarded as the principal absorber in air below 2000A. The 

Schumann-Runge system of absorption bands in oxygen corn- 

5 6 

mences at 1970A . Prom plates published by Leifson no 

oxygen band lies close to 1942A, but one falls at 1850A. 

The fine structure of this band shows lines at 1848.3, 

1849.4 and 1850.7A so that the mercury line at 1849*6A 

7 

would be expected to be absorbed strongly. Heilpem has 

studied the weaker general absorption of oxygen at 2144A. 

He found that Beer ! s law was not obeyed, but that the 

1.55 

extinction coefficient was given more nearly by up , 
u being the extinction coefficient for unit pressure at 
a fixed path length and p denoting the pressure of oxygen. 

It seemed possible that the ozone produced oy this 
lamp might be partly responsible for the absorption of its 
-radiation by the ozone-air mixture formed in an atmospheric 
path, holler 8 has found that an experimental quartz mercur; 
lamp formed an equilibrium concentration of 640 parts per ^ 
million of ozone in air. At 2537A this concentration is

sufficient to absorb 83^ of the radiation in a path length 
of one meter 9 . It is not known whether ozone has a pro¬ 
nounced absorption for the shorter mercury wavelengths. 

Uo evidence is available from the literature that 
there is any absorption by water vapour of the radiation 
from a quartz mercury lamp. Vacuum spectrograph results of 
Leif sof, HopfeilcUnd Rathenau 11 agree that rjater vapour 
absorbs only radiation below about 1785A. However, specuxo 
graphic measurements are ordinarily made with absorbing 
paths oi about one centimeter and absorption oi the orciei 
indicated by this combination would escape unnoticed. 

These observations indicate that the effective 
radiation was possibly concentrated at 1850 and 1942A. On 
this assumption, absorption of the radiation would be 
expected by atmospheric oxygen, but not by water vapour 
or nitrogen. The work described in this thesis was intends 
to enlarge upon the above deductions.

Apparatus. 

As previously stated the source of radiation 

was a Mineralight model 7-44 cold quartz mercury lamp. In 
« 

this type of lamp the pressure of mercury vapour is only 
about 0.1. mm. and a small pressure of rare gases is added 
to initiate the discharge. Current requirement of this 
lamp was about 20 milliamperes at its normal operating 
potential of approximately 350 volts. 

The photocell was made to order by the research 
laboratory of the General Electric Company. It was a high 
vacuum type having a silver sensitive surface enclosed in 
a quartz envelope. Tests of the amplified response when th< 
potential across the photocell was raised from the normal 
45 volts to 90 volts showed an increase in current of less 
than 3^| indicating that the pressure of residual gases 
was satisfactorily low. 

Current from the photocell was amplified and measure) 
by a microammeter. A circuit diagram of the amplifier is 
shorn in Pig. 1. The current amplification was about 
60,000 and was practically constant up to responses of at 
least 200 microamperes. Output currents were read on a 
-Simpson model 22 micro ammeter w r ith shunted ranges 0-50- 
100-250 microamperes. Batteries were self-contained and 
the entire unit housed in a sturdy metal box. The output 
of the amplifier was calibrated against grid voltage

These calib- 


seven times during the course of this work, 
rations were used to obtain corrected values for the 
amplified photoelectric response. 

The apparatus used for the measurement of absorption 
by dry gases is shown in Pig.2. The main chamber A was a 
steel cylinder, 12 11 inside diameter and 44" long with a 
wall thickness of 3/8 n . This cylinder was fitted with 
steel end plates 14 tf x 14 "x 3/8”, each secured by six screw: 
passing through into the wall of A. At one end the photo¬ 
cell C was mounted. Directly in front of the cell was a 
shutter E, slightly larger in diameter than the cell 
window to cut off all direct radiation when desired. The 
shutter was fastened to a solid brass rod which passed, 
through the end plate and was sealed by a ground joint at 
P. Rotation of this rod operated the shutter, the closed 
position being determined by the shutter stop R. The lamp 
D was enclosed in a metal container 6.5” in diameter and 
4” deep with a square window to expose the radiating sur¬ 
face and was mounted on one end of a 0.5” by-48" hollow 
brass rod. This rod slid through a packing joint at PI so 
that the distance from the lamp to the cell could be varie- 
-The optical path length was determined by measuring the 
distance from the indicator T to the right hand end plate 
and applying a known correction. Through the rod passed

the leads to the lamp transformer which were sealed in 
wax at the outer end. The lamp end of the rod was fitted 
with a rotating brass collar mounting three flexible arms 
with flanged wheels 0 which engaged tracks I to stabilize 
this section. The tracks v^ere bolted with angle brackets 
to four diaphragms G- of 7" internal diameter, the whole 
forming a rigid unit. 

The leads from the xihotocell were brought out 
through polystyrene insulators at 1 and passed through 
polystyrene strips P and Q to the amplifier B. They were 
inoloiid by a 3 W eopper tube with an adjustable shield I 

at the open end to permit access to binding posts on the 

■ 

insulators L. G- a ses were admitted through drying tubes by 
a stop cock K and the chamber was evacuated through outlet; 
at I and J, using one or two Hyvac pumps. 

lor studies of moist air and water vapour, additional: 
apparatus shown in Pig.3 was necessary to control and 
measure the humidity of the chamber contents, for measure¬ 
ments with moist air the contents were circulated through¬ 
out the tank by a small high-speed centrifugal blower V. 

The air was humidified by introducing water through the 
-thistle tube and stop cock at X. This water remained in a 
small depression in the glass tubing where it was evaporate 
by the current of air. Partial pressures of water vapour ij 
this air were determined by means of the dew point apparati

W. This consisted of a thin walled cylindrical vessel of 
nickeled brass. This vessel was about one quarter filled 
with alcohol which was cooled by adding small pieces of dr; 
ice. The dew points were read in the usual way on a ther¬ 
mometer which had been checked against a certified standar 

Absorption by water vapour alone was studied by 
introducing ,the water into vacuum through the stop cock X. 
In this case the water diffused almost instantaneously so 
that no circulation was required . The pressure of w T ater 
vapour was read on the small closed tube mercury manometer 
2 with the aid of a vernier microscope. The dry ice trap Y 
prevented the diffusion of mercury into the chamber on 
evacuation and was also used in pumping out water vapour. 

All connections leading into the chamber were sealed 
with Everett * s vacuum wax. The heads of the screws holding 
the end plates were coated with glyptal and when necessary 
the gaskets between the end plates and the main cylinder 
were coated with glyptal on the outside. It was found that 
when left in an evacuated state the leakage into the tank 
was only 1.2 mm. of mercury over a period of 100 hours. 
Pressures of less than 0.02 mm. of mercury (as evidenced 
by the fluorescence of a discharge tube) were attained 
with a single Hyvac pump. 

In designing the apparatus, three requirements

In measuring dew points the temperature of appear¬ 
ance of dew on cooling and the temperature of disappear¬ 
ance on warming up were recorded. The maximum separation 
of these two temperatures was about 1°G at lower humiditie 
while at higher humidities the separation was about G.4°G. 
The mean value of the temperatures of appearance and dis¬ 
appearance of dew for three or more trials was taken as 

be 

the dew point. The thermometer used was found to^accurate 
over the range of temperatures measured to 0.1°G. The 
estimated maximum error in the partial pressure of water 
vapour measured by this means was about 1 % for the lowest 
pressure and about 3% for the highest pressure used,

were of primary importance: 

(1) elimination of scattered light 

(2) stability of the amplifier 

(3) undetectable absorption by residual gases over 
a one meter path length on evacuation 

1. As fax as possible, interior parts of the tank 
were blackened with candle soot. The diaphragms were 
coated with a carbon black paint having a thin acetone 
base. In the form shown the shutter E cut off only the 
direct radiation, permitting the scattered light to 
reach the photocell and be balanced out in the amplifier. 
The maximum such correction for scattered light was less 
than 7 fo of the direct radiation. Another shutter used 
was somewhat larger and backed by a series of diaphragms 
of the same inside diameter as the photocell window to 
trap all but the direct radiation. Both methods were 
found to be effective in minimizing scattered light. 

?. A bank of four dry cells was connected exter¬ 
nally in parallel with the filament supply of the amp¬ 
lifier to maintain a more constant voltage. The leads 

from the photocell were thoroughly shielded and all in- 
(made) 

sulators were^from polystyrene to minimize leakage 
currents. The insulators I were designed to satisfy the 

0 

requir'ments of good vacuum and low electrical leakage. 
They were constructed of 1 TT polystyrene rod about 3 IT in

length. These were turned down to ■§" diameter for about 
half their length, threaded to engage a brass collar on 
the inside of the end plate and then waxed to the plate. 
The binding posts were tapped into the eii6_s of the insu¬ 
lators off-oentre. The insulated leads from the photocell 
were soldered to solid copper ?/ires about half-way thr¬ 
ough the insulators and the central holes of the insu¬ 
lators were then filled with wax.The photocell was ent¬ 
irely surrounded by a metal shield except for the aper¬ 
ture around the window. The amplifier, tank and vacuum 
pumps were separately grounded. With thejse precautions, 
the amplifier was found to be stable beyond the sensit¬ 
ivity of the microammeter in a location of high elec¬ 
trical disturbance and to exhibit only slight long per¬ 
iod .drift. 

3. Considerable difficulty was experienced in 
evacuating to undetectable absorption. The minimum pres¬ 
sure previously noted was unsatisfactorily high for 
some persistant vapours which were inadvertently intro¬ 
duced into the chamber. Water vapour absorption could 
be eliminsted^by continued evacuation of the chamber 
(only)^and it was necessary to use the dry ice trap. 
Strongly absorbing vapours such as glyptal and vacuum 
pump pil necessitated thorough cleansing of the chamber 
with solvents and repeated flushing with dry air. The

steel wall of the chamber probably contributed to this 
difficulty by adsorbing these vapours and forming on 
evacuation a * virtual leak 1 sufficient to maintain an 
objectionable concentration of absorbing vapour in the 
optical path.

Procedure . 

Absorption of the effective wavelengths was 
studied by measurement of the amplified photoelectric 
response to the radiation transmitted by known 
«£ path lengths and pressures of the gases investigated. 
The response R was then associated with the path length 
d and the pressure p by plotting log fRd') against d at 
fixed pressures or against p at fixed distances. The 
following discussion shows* that the res-ultant curves 
described the 1 absorption of the intervening gas. 

It is shown in Appendices I and II that in the ab¬ 
sence of an absorbing medium, the inverse square law 
may be applied in this particular case to the variation 
with distance of the flux from the lamp incident at the 
photocell window. If the photocell has a sensitivity S n 
for radiation of wavelength X n , the amplified response 
to a monochromatic source is given by 


= AS n I n /d^ 


(1) 


n 


where I denotes the intensity of the line X n and 1 is 
a constant. Tith heterochromatic radiation the total 
response becomes 



( 2 ) 


so that in the absence of an absorbing medium a 
plot of (Rd. ) against d should reduce to a straight line

parallel to the d axis. This relation should hold only 
if reflection from the walls of the chamber were neglig¬ 
ible. It was used as a criterion for the elimination of 
absorption by residual gases, a check run being taken in 
vacuum before each set of measurements• 

On introduction of an absorbing medium into the 
optical path, equation (1) becomes (by Lambert's law) 

R n a ? = AS n I n 10“ Mnd . fg) 

where is the extinction coefficient of the gas for 

wavelength A n and is a function of the pressure. A plot 

9 

of log (H n d ) against d should be linear 'for mono chro¬ 
matic radiation. It should have a slope of -ji n and a 
log(R n &") intercept of log(iS n I n ). lor heterochromatic 

2 z 

radiation (Rd ) is given by the sum of the fR n d^) T s for 

9 

individual wavelengths A^. In general the log (Bd ) 
against d plot will be a curve concave upwards with 
log (Rd 2 ) intercept of log d^S n In* This is true since 
the least absorbed wavelength will become the most eff¬ 
ective at large distances and the curve will approach 
the straight line for this wavelength. At shorter dis¬ 
tances the more rapidly absorbed wavelengths become eff¬ 
ective and raise the curve above this line. In the 
special case of uniform absorption for all the effective 

wavelengths a straight line results as in equation (3). 











- 18 - 


If this curve can be broken down into its comp¬ 
onent straight lines, values for the products AB n I n and 
extinction coefficients p n can be found. As previously- 
stated, there was reason to believe that only two wave¬ 
lengths were predominantly effective in producing the 
photoelectric response. Attempts were therefore made to 
separate the two effects either by mathematical or 
graphical analysis. 

If the path length d be held constant and the 
pressure of the intervening gas varied, an application 
of Beer *s law to equation (3) leads to the result 

sf = Al5 n I n 10“ ^ . (4) 

where p denotes the pressure and d n is the extinction 
coefficient for Y/svelength which is a constant dep¬ 
ending upon the path length. If the fixed distance d is 
made numerically equal to the fixed pressure used in 
obtaining a plot of (3) then erf n £// n and a plot of (4) 
should be identical with that of (3) provided Beer’s 
law is applicable. If Beer’s law is not applicable then 
p appears in (4) to some power other than unity. Some 
knowledge of whether or not Beer *s law holds for par¬ 
ticular gases can be obtained by the comparison of these 
two curves. 

In accordance with the method outlined, measure-

ments were m j nfcs made of amplifier response with dry air 
in the chamber using separate variation of either path 
length or pressure. Air was introduced into the chamber 
at the inlet K after passing slowly through a drying 
tube of phosphorus pentoxide, about 8 hours being req¬ 
uired i to attain atmospheric pressure. 

Data for water vapour alone was obtained by int¬ 
roducing water into vacuum through the stop cock at X. 

e 

Measurements were made at constant pressure, starting 
either with low pressures and adding water for each trial 
or with high pressures and evacuating to lower values. 

As soon as the water had been introduced the dry ice 
trap was warmed up to room temperature to prevent cond¬ 
ensation of water vapour. A single set of data was ob¬ 
tained at constant path length by saturating- the cham¬ 
ber with water vapour and measuring the response on 
evacuation to known pressures. 

With water vapour-air mixtures the responses at 
varied distances were first measured for dry air at 
slightly less than atmospheric pressure. At this stage 
water was introduced.at the stop cock X. The pressure of 
water vapour was determined by measurement of the dew 
point. It was found necessary to keep the blower circ¬ 
ulating continuously to obtain consistent results, both 
for the dew points and amplifier responses. Measurements

were taken after equilibrium had developed, indicating 
reasonably complete mixing of the gases. The same dis¬ 
tances were used for the moist sir as had been used be¬ 
fore adding water. Values of R^R^ where R is the re¬ 
sponse in moist air and R^ the response at the same dis¬ 
tance in dry air were then plotted against d and the 
absorption due to the water'vapour determined from the 
curves obtained. 

Absorption of nitrogen was measured with commer¬ 
cial nitrogen obtained from liquid air. This was .passed 
into the chamber through a drying tube of phosphorus 
pentoxide. A second trial was made in which the nitrogen 
passed through a system of eleven, pyrogallor bubblers 
and a bubbler of limewater, then through a calcium chlor¬ 
ide and phosphorus pentoxide drying train. This was done 
to cut down any oxygen or carbon dioxide that may have 
been present. 

Garbon dioxide was introduced into vacuum from an 
air-tight flask containing dry ice, the connection being 
made through a phosphorus pentoxide drying tube. Measure- 
meants were ma'de of the variation of response with dis¬ 
tance only for both nitrogen and carbon dioxide. 

All readings were taken after the amplifier and 
lamp had warmed up to operating conditions. The lamp re¬ 
quired 15 minutes to reach full output in air but only 







- 21 - 


3 minutes in vacuum. This fact suggested that the temp¬ 
erature of the lamp was higher in vacuum with possible 
effects on the radiation intensity. This was investig¬ 
ated hy enclosing the lamp in a small vacuum tight 
chamber which could be separately evacuated through the 
mounting rod (fig.2"). The lamp was placed quite close to 
a small quartz window and mounted so that air could 
freely circulate over its surface. The effective output 
of the lamp was found to be constant within l-v when the 
pressure inside the small chamber was suddenly changed fro* 
vacuum to atmospheric or vice versa. 

Absorption by ozone of the effective radiation was 
investigated by setting the lamp and photocell up in air 
and shining additional £6371 radiation'from the germic¬ 
idal lamp across the path. Since this has been shown to 
reduce the ozone concentration^ it would be expected that 
if ozone were responsible for any of the absorption the: 
amplifier response would be changed. This was not found 
to be the case so that the ozone produced in a path of 
air may be neglected in this combination. 

Some evidence was found that water vapour was ad¬ 
sorbed by the walls of the chamber. Pressures of water 

vapour were found to vary during the course of a series 

£ 

of measurments , depending, on the prior degree of sat- 
oration, so that the mean of the initial ana final pres- 










- in¬ 


sure s was taken. It was found impossible to pump out 
water vapour to a pressure of undetectable absorption 
without the dry ice trap. Moist air could be evacuated 
to this stage quite readily although the pumping time 
was somewhat longer than for dry air. 

It was also believed that water vapour was adsor¬ 
bed at the quartz window of the photocell. When high 
pressures of water vapour.were left in the chamber the 
log (Rd 2 ) intercept of the curves was progressively low¬ 
ered. lor example, three hours after introducing a pres¬ 
sure of 12.2 mm. of water vapour alone the intercept was 
reduced to 65 % of the original value. The variation of 
the concentration of water vapour in the optical path 
resulting from absorption at both the quartz and metal 
surfaces introduced additional errors in the measure¬ 
ment of responses so that the results for water vapour 
are not as accurate as those for dry gases. 

A large amplifier conduction current noted after 
the first measurements were made with water vapour led 
to the possibility that residual water vapour was ion¬ 
ized by the ' Mineralight radiation. It was found that 
after flushing the chamber out with dry air and evac¬ 
uating without the dry ice trap there was a marked 
response to the radiation when the large shutter in 
use was closed. This response was roughly proportional

to the intensity falling on the cell. At a pressure of 
0.2 min. it constituted about 25 % of the total response, 
but disappeared entirely on adding dry air to a pressure 
of 5 cm. Coating one electrode of the photocell with 
glyptal and evacuating again reduced the current slightly 
but it was not eliminated until the photocell was enclosed 
in a tight metal shield.

Re suits. 

Absorption of the total effective radiation by dry 
air is illustrated in plots of log (Rd 2 ) against path 
length (fig.4) and of log (Rd 2 ) against pressure (fig.5). 
It is to be noted that these result in curves concave 
upwards. 

Similar plots are shown for water vapour in figs, 
band 7. Pig. 6, showing absorption with variation of .the 
path length establishes that the reduction of amplifier 
response noted in the introduction was due to absorption 
of the effective radiation by water vapour. In these 
graphs the plots are straight lines. Table I records 
values calculated from the slopes of these lines for the 
extinction coefficient of water vapour a,t the effective 

wavelengths. The mean of these values was found to be 

-5 

(100 ±4) x 10 /cm/mm pressure of water vapour. 

The absorption by dry and moist air with variation 
of the path length is illustrated in a plot of log (Rd 2 ) 
against path length of air with different pressures of 
water vapour added (fig. 8). Values of R ni /R<i are plotted 
against path length in fig.3. Table II shows values calc¬ 
ulated from the slopes of the latter lines for the extin¬ 
ction coefficient of the w r ater vapour content of the 
mixture. The mean value was found to be (99 ± 18) 2 10 15

per cm./mm. pressure of water vapour. 

Nitrogen exhibited uniform absorption of the 
effective radiation with variation of the path length 
as seen from fig.10. 

Absorption by carbon dioxide with variation of 

the path length is shown in fig.11. Except for the 

p 

marked reduction of the log (Kd ) intercept, the curve 
is similar to that obtained for nitrogen.

Discussion of Results. 

The curvature of the plots obtained in figs.4&5 
shows that more than one wavelength in the Mineralight 
radiation was effective in producing the photoelectric 
current and that these wavelengths had different extinc¬ 
tion coefficients in air. It appears that the predomin¬ 
antly effective radiation is concentrated at 1850' and 
1942A. The low response of the photocell to the germ¬ 
icidal lamp showed that the effective wavelengths were 
not to be found in the spectrum of this source. A com¬ 
parison of the spectra of the two lamps (plate II) 
showed that the radiation was comparable down to 
2378.3A. Another plate (not shown) taken on a Hilger 
quartz spectrograph showed that the radiation from the 
two lamps was comparable down to 2302.1A and that the 
germicidal lamp also radiated weakly the Mineralight 
line at 2262.3A. Vacuum spectrograms of the Mineralight 
(plate I) show that the spectrum below 2262.3A contained 
a strong line at 1850A, a weaker line at 1942A and two 
very faint lines at 2043*8 and 2052.9A. The effective 
radiation was therefore distributed amongst these wave¬ 
lengths with 1850 and 1942 predominant. 

As mentioned in the introduction, plates published 
6 

by Leifson show that the absorption due to oxygen is

much stronger at 1850 than at 1942A, accounting qual¬ 
itatively for the shape of the curves for dry air (p.17). 
Attempts to analyse these curves on the basis of two 
effective wavelengths for the separate absorption 
coefficients were unsuccessful. 

A comparison of the absorption by dry air at 
varied distances to that at varied pressures is shown 
in fig.12. It is seen that the absorption at reduced 
pressures was less than would be predicted by .Beer’s 
law. 

The straight lines in fig.6 indicate that the 
absorption by water vapour was the same for both wave¬ 
lengths and it is probable that the absorption is 
essentially uniform over the effective region. The 
extinction coefficient of water vapour for the radiat¬ 
ion at 1850 and 1942A was found to be (100 ± 4) x 10~ J 
per cm./mm. pressure of water vapour. The mean value 
found for the extinction coefficient due to water 

“5 

vapour in moist air was found to be (99-18) x 10 /cm./ 

mm..pressure of water vapour. The agreement of these 
two values shows that the absorption by water vapour 
was independent of the partial pressure of dry air 
-within experimental error.

the dotted extrapolation of the absorption line found 
for carbon dioxide shows that one of the effective wave¬ 
lengths was not transmitted appreciably by a path length 

p 

of 30 cm. of this gas at the pressure used. Since the Rd 
intercept must be the same as that found in the preliminary 
vacuum run (within experimental error), the actual curve 
must turn upwards for path lengths below 30 cm. as shown 
in the solid extrapolation. There is no evidence from the 
literature to support the view that one of the effective 
wavelengths is strongly absorbed by carbon dioxide.

Acknowle dgme n t s 

I would like to express my'appreciation to Dr. 
0.0. Langstroth for making this problem available to 
me and his many valuable suggestions during the course 
of the work • 

I am also indebted to Dr. R.J. Xang for the 
vacuum spectograms of plate I, to Professor E.S. 
Keeping of the Mathematics Department for evaluat¬ 
ing the integral lo of Appendix II and to Mr. A.J. 
Stevenson who assisted in taking spectograms such 
as that shown in plate II,

Appendix 

I. Validity of the inverse square law. 
Assuming the lamp is a square of sides 2a and 
surface brightness B, the intensity radiated from an 
element dx dy at an angle 9 from the normal is (by 
Lambert 1 s law) B dx dy cos 6. 



Big.13: Simplified model of lamp and photocell. 

(d joins the centres of the lamp and the 
photocell window and is normal to both). The maximum 
value for d is about 90cm. and the minimum about 30cm. 


It follows that the intensity falling on an 
elementary area dS in the plane of the photohell window is 

K dx dy cos 2 © 

But cos 2 © s d 2 /(x^+ y' + d^) and r 2 = (x + y^+ d 2 ) 


so that this may be written 


K dx dy

The total intensity received from the lamp by dS is 
therefore

d 2 ) 2 


Upon integration (Appendix II) this turns out to be 

4Ka/(a 2 4~ d 2 ) 2 tan 1 a/(a 2 ^ d 2 )' .... (1) 

Substituting a = 2.5cm. and making (1) equal to 

E /d^ at d it may be shown that at d • this expres- 
1/ max ° 2 

sion differs from K^/d 2 by less than 0.8$> so that the 
deviation from the mean is less than 0.4/^ . Assuming that 
the additional error introduced by the finite size of the 
photocell is of the same magnitude, it is seen that the 
inverse square law may be applied within experimental 
error.
