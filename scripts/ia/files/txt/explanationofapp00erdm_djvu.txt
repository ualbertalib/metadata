Introduction 


Since the discovery of* the positron numerous 
observers have reported the apparent emission 
of positive particles from Beta-ray sources being 
examined in a cloud chamber. These particles 
have the same ionising power as electrons and are 
distinguishable from them only by means of the 
opposite curvature in a magnetic field. The 
theoretical number of positrons expected, due 
to pair production by gamma rays or electrons, is 
greatly exceeded by the number of these particles 
observed in a cloud chamber, but is in good agree¬ 
ment with counter measurements. In addition to 
this disagreement between cloud chamber and counter 
measurements it is interesting to note that the 
cloud chamber measurements by different observers 
are not in complete agreement among themselves. 

D Skobelzyn (1) in 1934 observed a production 
of "positrons” in the passage of electrons, of less 
than 1 Me¥ through Nitrogen gas. Alichanow and 
Kosoda ev[ (2) used a source pf Pa (B and G) and 
measured the electron and positron emission by 
means of a magnetic analyzer. A determination was 
made op internal pair and external pair conversion. 
Results seemed to agree with theoretical values.

Skobelzyn and Stepanowa (3) were the first to 
determine an actual value for the ratio of the num¬ 
ber of positrons produced to the Eeta particles 
emitted, and the cross section for the production 
of the positrons. They surrounded a Radium source 
in a glass capsule by a layer of lead and estimated 
,02 to ,04 positrons per electron as the rate of 
production. In further experiments (4) they 
concluded that the cross section was of the order 

d d 

of 10 cm. in lead, 

Alichanow, et al. (5) reported experiments done 
with magnetic focussing and coincidence geiger 
counters. They were unable to confirm a large 
cross section. Champion (6) observed the passage 
of electrons through Hitrogen gas but found no 
indication of positrons. 

Staub (7) endeavoured to ascertain the cross 
section for pair production by electrons of prese¬ 
lected energy falling on a window in a cloud 

chamber. He asserted that the cross section was 
-24 2 -25 

no more than 10 cm. for lead and 10 for Al, 

and C. 

Marques da Silva (8) in a cloud chamber exper¬ 
iment obtained a cross section of the order of 
-22 2 

cm. for lead. Skobelzyn and Stepanowa (9) 












found pairs produced both in Al and in lead. They 
concluded Beta rays were more effective in produc¬ 
ing pairs than Gamma rays of the same energy. 

Champion and Barber (10) and (11) studied tracks 
in a chamber containing Mercury dimethyl vapour 
and Nitrogen gas. The appearance of positive 
tracks led to the conclusion that they were produced 
by the presence of the Mercury. An assumption was 
made that the cross section increased rapidly with 
the atomic number. 

H.L. Sen Gupta (12) investigated the passage 
of electrons through Xenon gas. He found no pairs 
in 330 meters of track length in electrons of an 
energy of 2 MeV. 

F. Sizoo and Barendregt (13) and (14) took 
a large series of pictures of Ha (B and C). They 
confirmed the results of (3) although their result 
was .01 positrons per electron which is of that 
observed by (3). It was also noted that the 
spectrum of positive particles concentrated ninety 
five percent of the particles in the range ©f 
energys under 300 KeV. The suggestion was rna.de 
that this would explain the discrepancy in counter 
and cloud chamber measurements. The cross section 
for external pair production was found to be of

Crane and Halpern (-15) conducted an extensive 
set of experiments on external pair production 
by electrons. Foils of air, mica, lead and platinum 
were used and in a total track length of 628 meters 
results agreeing with theoretical cross section 
were obtained. Ho measurements were made under 
1 MeV. The authors concluded that these measure¬ 
ments were unreliable due to scattering. 

32 

In an investigation of Bremstrahlung of P 
Chien-Shiung-hu (16) did not find annihilation 
radiation which would be present if positrons 
were present. 

It was established by Bradt, Heine, and Schemer 

(17) on the basis of their ora work with counter 

and a Beta-ray Spectrograph, and an analysis of the 

work of (15) and (16), that positrons due to pair 

production were not present. A new particle was 

postulated. Triple coincidence measurements were 

32 

made with ThC n , Uxn, BaE, AcC n and P . He suits 
gave an indication of coincidences in the case 
of ThC fl and Uxg. These could be explained by shell 

electron effects. 

Smith and Groetzinger (18) postulated the 
existence of a particle of heavier mass than that

of the electron since: 

(1) Positive particles lost momentum much 
more rapidly than electrons. 

(2) Particles seemed to be secondaries of a 
high energy non-ionizing radiation. (The production 
of 4 or 5 positive particles in the wall of the 

chamber at some distance from the source was noted.) 

32 

In 1000 pictures of P Pi and Chao (19) found 
the production of positive particles to be approx¬ 
imately the same as measured by Beta, ray spectro¬ 
graph. All trades under 4 cm. long were discarded 
to avoid multiple scattering as described by 
Bethe (21). There was no Gamma ray effect due to 
the use of light elements as filters and there 
was no pair production of an order greater than 
that predicted by theory. With a source of BaE 
McCusker (20) found similar results to those 
obtained by (19). .01 percent of the tracks appeared 

to have a positive curvature and these were explain¬ 
ed by reflection and scattering. 

This thesis is primarily concerned with an 
explanation of contradictory results obtained. It 
includes work done by G.T. Kokotailo (22) which 
apparently supported the early work of (1), (3) 5 
(4) 5 (5), (6) ? and (8) and an analysis of work

Apparatus 
1. Dlouti Chamber Propel 1 .

The Cloud Chamber (Plate 1) is of the type 
developed by Gilbert and Dee in the Cavendish 
Laboratory. It was built in the National’ Hesearch 
Council shops at Chalk Biver. It is of the pressure 
actuated diaphragm type in which the working 
chamber is sealed off by a rubber diaphragm.# 
Expansion is obtained by a pressure differential 
between the two sides of the diaphragm. In cur 
case the working chamber is kept at atmospheric 
pressure and the lower side of the diaphragm may 
either be at atmospheric pressure (compressed 
position) or open to an evacuated chamber by means 
of a sylphon bellows valve(expanded position). 

The valve (plate 2) is actuated by a solenoid 
controlled by the main, circuit. 

The expansion ratio is adjusted by raising 
and lowering a plate under the diaphragm by means 
of a large screw. 

The bottom of the chamber consists of a 
perforated brass plate, over which is a layer of 

# 1/32” natural Rubber sheet obtained from the 
Ontario Rubber Co,

hoc*- of brrss. The velveteen eliminates a trey 
light from the chamber floor and premite a non 
turbulent flow of air to take place during an 
expansion. 

The vails of the chamber are made of Incite 


1/4" thick and 2" high, 
walls of this type seems 


The only disadvantage of 
to be that they are slight¬ 


ly soluble in certain organic solvents • Foa tJ i 
reason acetone is not used in the chamber. 1 3" 


bands of Acuadag re painted on both the top end 
bottom edges of the Incite ring. These help to 
prevent the light from shining on the top ano 
bottom surfaces of the chamber and so being reflect¬ 
ed into the camera. 

The top of the chamber is of glass ? 12/32"• 
thick ? shoring no .flaws • or imperfections. A 3/8" 
acuadag ring is painted around its inner surface. 
Alien the chamber is in operation a 400 volt clearing 
field is applied between this ring and Jhe floor 
of the chamber. Tice high voltage is connected to 


the ring by means of two aquadag strips which are 
painted to the edge of the glass top at diametric¬ 


ally opposite points. Connection is 'made to two 

tinfoil strips which are inserted between the top 
and the walls at the aquadag strips. 














) . '■ 








The seal between the walls and top and bottom is 
accomplished by means of 1/16" natural rubber 
gaskets. 

The working mixture is introduced into the 
chamber by means of a pipe which is threaded into 
the base at one edge, and is closed at the upper 
end with a screw* plug. 

The valves, expansion regulation screw, and 
movable external connections are packed with a 
mixture of vacuum grease and cotton batting. The 
base of the chamber, which is made of cast aluminum, 
is painted with glyptal since the aluminum is 
slightly porous. This portion of the chamber is 
isolated from the working portion by the diaphragm 
and it was found that small leaks did not greatly 
interfere with the operation of the chamber as 
they were quite easily handled by the pumps. 

Two Cenc© Byvac pumps in parallel, maintain 
a tank ofabout 1/5 cu. ft. capacity at a low press¬ 
ure. The tank is connected to the base of the 
chamber and is opened to the bottom of the diaphragm 
by the expansion valve. 

A length of lead tubing wrapped around the base 
of the chamber is connected to a cold water line. 
This was done to reduce the temperature inside the 
chamber and to stabilize it during operation. In

addition, reducing the temperature at the base 
below that of the walls and top plate eliminates 
fogging of the latter during operation* 

2. Helmholtz Doils * 

The Helmholtz coils were built at the national 
Research Council shops at Chalk River* The inside 
diameter is 12" and the outside diameter is 20j". 

The coil forms are of 1/8" brass 3-3/8" deep by 
3-1/S" wide* A single layer of copper tubing is 
wound on the inside for cooling purposes, and 
1090 turns of #11 H. F* copper wire per coil are 
spooled on the outside of the tubing* The resistance 
is 5*8 ohms per coil at 20 degrees Centigrade. 

Due to the inductance of the winding the time for 
the current to reach a steady value is found to 
be about 1.8 seconds. For this reason it is 
advisable to have at least a 2 second delay for 
the coils* 

The coil dircuit (Fig. 1) consists of an A.C. 

relay which, when activated by the timing circuit, 

closes a heavy current D.C. relay to the coils* A 

condenser of 60 microfarads capacity was connected 

across the coils to prevent arcing at the currents 

used. For high current work there is a Tungar 

Mercury Rectifier (189048) across the relay. This 
shorts the back emf. of the co -q s directly

preventing arcing across the relay contacts* 

The Ke^-tflholtz coil field uniformity \ms 
investigated (22) and found to be uniform within 
.5% over a region bounded by planes 2*5 cm. below 
and above the plane through the midpoint of the 
coils, and a cylinder of 9 cm. radius. 

3. The Camera. 

The camera (Plate 3) was designed and built 
in the physics department by G.T. Kokotailo. It 
is fitted with a Leica Elmar f3.5 lens using 35 m.m 
perforated film. A pull away shutter keeps light 
out of the camera when a picture is not being taken 
The shutter is actuated by a small electromagnet 
fastened to the helmholtz coils. 

The camera is chain driven by a Flexo-action 
motor, 110 volts, 60 cycle, geared to 10 r.p.m., 
made by Merkle Korff Gear Co.. A toothed wheel 
engaging the film is fastened to a disc with four 
holes which are spaced a frame apart. These holes 
actuate a sliding switch (Fig. 2) which allows 
advance of the film one frame each time the helm¬ 
holtz coils are actuated. 

The camera is mounted on an aluminum stand 
which is bolted to the top helmholtz coil. Two 
front aluminized mirrors in frames at either side 
of the stand allow stereoscopic view’s of the

chamber to be taken. The mirrors are 8-1/4 11 
apart, extending down against the top of the 
chamber. Each mirror gives a view of one half 
of the chamber on the film. 

4* Illumination . 

Illumination is accomplished by high speed Argon 
photoflash lamps of the straight tube type 
G.E. FT-126 mounted in boxes to fit between the 
coils (Plate 4). The back half of the tube is 
silvered to increase illumination. A clear lucite 
lens, made by splitting and polishing a 2” lucite 
rod, is used to collimate the beam. Two diametric¬ 
ally opposed lamps are used, each fired from a 
common trigger circuit, (Fig. 3) but with separate 
ea-.g£izge conaensors. 

5. Control Circuits . 

(a) Description 

The main control circuit was arranged as 
shwwn in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. It consists of a 
series of timing circuits. Each timing circuit 
uses a grid condenser type of control, in which 
the cathode of a thyratron is kept at a 200 volt 
positive value with respect to ground, the plate 
being at 400 volts. A condenser between the 
grid and ground is then charged up through a 
variable resistor network between it and the plate.

When the voltage on the grid has reached a 
sufficiently high value to exceed cutoff the thjrr- 
atron fires, closing a relay in its plate circuit* 
This relay in turn closes the circuit to another 
thyratron or to some external mechanism such as 
the flash tube* Time delays are adjusted by vary¬ 
ing the resistor network to the grid condenser. 

The minor control circuit, or automatic 
operation circuit, consists of a 12 position 
selector switch triggered by a solenoid which is 
energized by one of the timing circuits in the 
main control circuit. There are actually 6 
different positions on the selector switch, the 
other 6 being repetitions. This switch controls 
tne automatic operation of the chamber, closing 
circuits to: 

(a) Helmholtz coils 

(b) Expansion circuit 

(c) Lighting circuit 

Paper condensers are used throughout, except 
in high voltage filters. The relays are made by 
Clare and Co. and are type A21316 with 18000 turns 
and resistance of ^500 ohms. Tne relays are a six 
terminal type plus two energizing terminals. 

1 and 2, and 4 and 5 are normally closed; 2 and 3,

switch S 3 is in the slow position. 

Tlie selector switch connected to plug 2 
produces automatic operation. It is turned in the 
timing interval operated by relays 6 and 7. The 
dlosing of relay 6 energizes a solenoid that moves 
the selector switch one step. A complete cycle 
consists of 3 minor expansions (to be explained) , 
two dead intervals, and the major expansion. If 
switch 2 is turned on the lighting circuit will 
operate during the major expansion. 

Minor expansions are clearing expansions in 
which the chamber is cleared of water droplets 
and dust particles. In the circuit as used they 
are produced by causing an expansion to take 
place before fall compression has occurred. This 
is done by regulating the length of the timing 
interval. The chamber remains compressed for 
9.5 seconds and is expanded for 2.5 seconds and 
a full cycle of operation requires 72 seconds. 

Other satisfactory cycles may be set up by adjusting 
Q and R. 

6 . Tilting Table . 

A table made up of a 12" by 12" piece of 
bakelite painted white is used to view the tracks, 
(Plate 7). The board is fastened to a steel 
hemisphere which fits into a machined bowl, with 













PLATE 7 Tilting table with camera on stand 


for reprojection, 








*7 


an electromagnet in the middle that makes close 
contact with the hemisphere. The electromagnet 
will clamp the hemisphere solidly at any angle. 

The camera stand with the mirrors and camera 
in the same position as on the chamber is clamped 
to the frame supporting the tilting table. V/hen 
the tracks are reprojected through the camera lens, 
using a prism and enlarging bulb, the plane table 
is adjusted until the images fuse, and a stereo¬ 
scopic reprojection of the tracks is thus obtained. 
The table is then clamped by the electromagnet, 
the chord length is measured by the ruler set in 
the top of the plane table and the depth of the 
sector by the micrometer screw. For high angle 
tracks a correction must be applied to the apparent 
radius of curvature. Since a slit source was 
used, and all tracks were in a horizantal plane, 
a discussion of this correction will not be given. 








Experimental Procedure 


/a 


Conditions for best tracks are obtained with 
a minimum expansion ratio, ibis was done by using 
a 5 c.c. mixture of 65% ethyl alcohol and 35% water 
(23). Air was used as the gas. 

Other mixtures e.g. 2:1:1 ethyl alcohol, water 
and acetone give better results, but could not 
be used on account of the lucite walls of the 
chamber. 

All pictures were taken with a lead foil 

o 

34.2 mgm./cm. stretched across the chamber at a 
distance of 10 cm. from the source. 

Pictures we re taken on Ortho He cording Safety 
Film (Eastman Kodak.) and were developed for 7 
minutes in D-19. A few were also taken with Ilford 
HP and developed for 10 minutes in D-19. Ihe 
Ortho Recording film was definitely superior in 
contrast and density. 

Sources were all enclosed in glass tubes with 
a wall thickness from 20 to 50 microns and of an 
internal diameter of 1 m.m. to 1.5 m.m. All 
glass sources were enclosed in some form of a 
collimating systen to give a thin horizontal beam 
of particles. 

The S was percipitated on a glass slide 
and covered with a thin layer of vinyllte. It

was collimated by a double slit arrangement, 
one next to the source, and the other at a 
distance of two cm,. 

The activity of the source was controlled 
by the width of the slit f and was of the order of 
20 tracks per picture. 

The current in the Hehnholtz coil circuit was 
regulated to 5 amperes which gave a field of 250 


gauss 














Results 


Zo 



A good indication of the scattering to be expected from 
low energy electrons (Plate 8) was shown* It was not 
possible to distinguish tracks of electrons and positive 
particles in pictures such as these, so only 30 pictures 
were taken in this series* In a field of 250 gauss scattering may 
cause- the appearance of a curved track looking very much like 
a positive particle* These pictures offer a confirmation 
of the result s of random scattering as predicted by (2L)* 

See Appendix 3* 

Ux 

2 

A total of 308 pictures were taken* Of these only 
201 were sufficiently clear that it was considered 
they would give reliable results if measured* Sufficiently 
clear pictures were considered as those in which there 
was very good definition between the tracks and the back¬ 
ground and In which there were approximately 30 tracks per 
picture* 

There were 6340 electron tracks for an average of 
31*5 tracks per picture* Of these there were 8 ihet could 
have been considered positive particles (plate 9 ) giving 
a ratio of 0*0013 positive particles per electron. As well 
as these there were 6 other tracks which could be called 
questionable, in that they could not be seen to be recoils,

ratio of 0*0032 positive tracks per electron* 

A count was also taken of tile recoil electrons tiiemselves* 
There was an average of 2*5 electron recoils per picture 
for a total of 512 recoil tracks* From the ratio of the sour ce 
to the chamber diameter it was calculated that 64 of these 
tracks would pass back through the region of the source* This 
gives a total recoil particle ratio of 0*01 per electron* 

There appeared to be one pair produced in the series 
of pictures* No incident electron was recorded and tiie pair 
could have been due to Bremsstrahlung conversion* 

Ra (D and E ) 

206 pictures were taken in this series* There was 
an average of 17 tracks per picture making a total of 
3490 tracks* Of these Ihere were 6 possible positive 
particles for a ratio of 0*0017 per electron. 

6 definite recoils were counted which returned throu^i 
the source and were visible throughout their entire path* 

There was one air recoil which went back through the source. 

A count was taken on the recoil particles. It was found 
that there were 543 recoil tracks for a ratio of 2*7 visible 
recoils per picture. The ratio of the chamber diameter to the 
source diameter was of the order of 50 to 1* This gives a 
calculated value of 10 recoil tracks which should proceed back 
through the source*

The total count for the positive particles was 13 
if the visible recoils were considered. This compares very 
favorably with Ifce calculated value for recoil tracks reentering 
the source. 

Tiro cases of tracks which appeared to be pair production 
at Ihe foil, but in which there was no incident electron, 
were recorded. Since there are no high energy gamma rays from 
Ra (D and E) it can only be concluded that these tracks 
(Plate 10) are only recoil electrons on the far side of the 

foil from the source. 
p32 

467 pictures of P38 were taken. There was an average 
of 13.1 tracks per picture for a total of 6100 electron 
tracks (Plate 11). 

Two counts of possible positive particles were takai. 

One was made on the assumption that all tracks, regardless 
of lei^th or stereo-reprojection, with a positive 
appearing curvature, were positrons or positive particles. 

The second excluded all tracks of a shorter length than 
4 cm. and took stereo-reprojection into account. 

In the fittet case there was a positive particle count 
of 50. ihis gives a ratio of 0.0082 positives per electron, 
or results closely approximating those of earlier workers 
(3), (8), (9), (13), (14).

chamber* These were regarded as actual positive tracks 
and gave a ratio of the order of 0*001 or of the order of 
results obtained by McOusker (20) for P 3 ^. 

There were three tracks in which complete circles were 
visible, in which an electron starting fran the source 
travelled in a closed curve back to the source* 

8 apparent pairs were produced in the direct view of 
the chamber, but in the stereo-projection it could be 
seen that all but one of these could be explained away 
as electrons which had penetrated the foil and were curving 
back to the foil surface* 

Considering the probability of recoil in this case 
it was found that there was a total of 970 recoil tracks 
for the series giving 20 possible re-entrant electrons*

No incident electrons were visible in any of the 
apparent pairs except in on© case (Plate 12)* It may be 
seen in this case that Ihe incident electron has gone through 
the foil, while the pair is a recoil of an electron which has 
already penetrated the foil and is curving back to the source*

Conclusions 


(a) Particles counted as possible positives were those 
which appeared not to be particles reflected toward the 
source* The majority of these were of low energy* 

(b) The end of tracks could not be distinguished except in 
the cases of the low energy particles* None of the higher 
energy tracks could be seen to penetrate the foil* 

(o) A count was taken on the number of reflected electrons 
in which the incident and reflected electron was definitely 
visible* This value gave a figure for re-entrant electrons 
which was of the same ozder as or greater than the number of 
positives counted* It is clear that there were reflections 
in which one of the particles could not be seen due to ihe 
bearn of illumination, and also that some of these tracks 
could be counted as positives* 

(d) A graph of the energy distribution obtained for 

positive particles from Ux g by G* T* Kokotailo (22) is 

given here (Plate 13)* The large concentration of particles 

55 

in the low energy region is seen* Prom the pictures of S 
it is seen that the inclusion of tracks of this type is 
impossible* 

(e) In agreement with Crane and Halpem (15) no large 
cross section for pair production was found*

as 


From the preceding some significant observations 
can be made* 

(1) Non collimated sources give far too many reflected 
and scattered electrons to be of any use in cloud chamber 
measurements on positron production* It was found in our 
case that even collimated sources gave a large amount of 
scatter and that 30 tracks per picture are too many to 
allow definite analysis of any one because of overlapping* 

(2) Many cases of apparent pair production were ruled 
out in stereo-reprojection as one of the particles of the 
pair was seen to be in a different horizontal plane from 
the other and was clearly an electron that had penetrated 
the foil and was curving back toward tie source* 

(3) The reflection of Ihe particles to give positives 
now explains two hertofore conflicting arguments* 

Bradt, Hein© and Scherrer (17) noticed that the end point 
of the Beta spectrum did not allow the production of 
positrons* With Hal a positive particle was found with an 
energy of 0*25 mev* The end point of the Beta spectrum is 
only 1.17 mev* This means that the excess energy in pair 
production will be only-15 mev* Ibis does not allow the 
production of a pair with particles of the mass of an electron* 
A lighter particle was postulated* Smith and Greet zinger 
(18) suggested that this observation was inconsistent with part 
of -Sie data. A positive particle of higher mass than that of

the electron was postulated, if the apparent positives are 
reflected electrons then these difficulties are immediately 
resolved. 

(26) 

(4) The theoretical work of Arley and Miller "on the 

positron spectrum from Beta conversion gives a ratio of 

-7 

N'ty'N- of the order of 10 . This ratio does not increase 

rapidly until high energy Betas are used. For low energy 
Beta radioactive elements it may be seen that positrons from 
internal conversion would therefore be present in almost 
unobservable numbers. 

(5) No pairs such as those noticed by Groet^inger, G., 

Ribe, F., and Smith, L. (24) were noticed in the pictures taken, 
it is suggested that these tracks were produced by a junction 
of a re-entrant electron track which left the illuminating 
field at the position in which it was in conjunction with the 
electron track that was thought to have caused the pair# 

(6) The suggestion of Bnmerich, W.S., and Kurbatov, J.B. (25) 
is also questioned following the above results* in a study of 
the disintegration of Ag^^in a cloud chamber several 
positrons were noticed* The ratio of 0.002 positrons $er 
electron disintegration was postulated for the decay scheme* 

This result is of the same order as was obtained in the work 
done above. The unreliability of cloud chamber results due 

to scattering and reflections leads to the conclusion that 
small quantitative determinations such as given for this decay 
scheme may be due to the experimental error produced by the

(7) As mentioned, the results obtained agreed closely 
with those of Pi and Chao (19; and McCusker (20). It is 
suggested that in work of this type only complete tracks be 
counted. The number of tracks in the chamber should also be 
reduced. Collimated sources seam almost a necessity^ Plate i4)* 
The positive particles postulated to date seem to be caused 
by: 

(1) Reflections from the wall, top and bottom of the 
chamber and air recoils. 

1 2) Electrons that have traversed complete circles*

Preparation of S^ 5 Source * 

Since the S 35 is a Beta emitter of very low energy, a 
method of mounting was found necessary in which the source 
was covered by a very thin layer of sane material of sufficiently 
low mass to allow penetration by a large percentage of the 
electrons* 

The S 35 , as a solution of Na g S in *1 N NaUH was evaporated 
on a glass microscopic cover slide* An extremely thin film 
of Vinylite was then prepared* Powdered Vinylite dissolved 
in Chloroform was poured into a large beaker of water* A 
drop of this solution was raised to the surface by a wire, 
where it spread to a very thin layer* This layer was then 
raised off the water by means of a loop at the end of another 
piece of wire and placed on top of the glass slide* it was 
cemented down with Buco Household Cement* 

The thickness of the film was determined by the inter¬ 
ference colors observed in the film, when it was on *&© 
water surface* The film used was of the thietoaess ©f on© 
wavelength of blue li^at, and gave no noticeable reduction in 
the count observed for the source before it was covered®

Source Mounts * 

The collimated sources used were of two types. 

One employed an extended source, and the other 

a point source. The extended source was used with 

Ux« and was discarded in favor of the point source 
4 

due to the smaller probability of entrance of recoil 
electrons. 

The slit source adopted was a lead block 1.5 cm. 
square and Z cm. long. A hole 1.5 m.m. in diameter 
was bored into $ie middle. Midway down the block a slit was 
cut with a thin saw blade. The slit was Ihen closed slightly 
by tapping with a hammer and polished with a piece of emery 
cloth to clear out small lead particles. 

A beam of particles over the chamber was obtained. 

This beam subtended a vertical angle of 10 degrees at the 
source, and a horizontal angle of 180 degrees. This gave 
a spread of particles that extended to the limits of the 
chamber dimensions at a point diametrically opposite from 


the source.

Theoretical Curvature due to Scattering, 

Using the mean average angle of scattering as calculated 
by numerous different workers and from the minimum angle of 
screening and the maximum angle giving an observable single 


# 


scattering bend in the track, H. &• Bethe calculated the 
theoretical function for a radius of curvature produced by 
random collisions. This fornula is based on the sagitta by 
which the radius of curvature of tracks is usually measured. 

if the curvature in the magnetic field yf,is 1700 M/^H where 
M is the mass of the particle, including relativity correction, 
in units of the electron rest mass; and the scattering 


curvature is ^5 404 ^Zix/BP)^ 



if ^^the largest curvature comes from the field. If/% ^6 the 
lafgest curvature come® from scattering, x is the half length of 
the chord forming the sagitta. Z is the atomic number. B is 
a correction tern close to unity. P is a measure of the 
density of the nuclei in the gas and is Z for air. 

Por a reasonable curvature for a 0.1 mev. particle assume 
a field of 100 gauss. ^}is 0.55 and/^is 11 cm.. Using x as 9 
4 can then be calculated to be 0.59. It can therefore be 
seen that scattering may give an apparent positive curvature 
to electron tracks of a low energy.
