METHODS OP MEASURING- GROWTH RATE IN ALFALFA 


W. E. Smith 

INTRODUCTION 


Many workers have reported that alfalfa, like 
several other cross-breeding plants, exhibits reduced vigor 
of growth when Inbred but maintains its vigor regularly under 
conditions of cross-pollination* Usually loss of vigor in 
alfalfa following inbreeding has been studied by comparison 
of inbred and open-pollinated plants with respect to yield 
of fodder at the n haying ,! stage of growth and with respect 
to seed yield. Comparisons of this kind have been made from 
field-plot yields obtained at one stage of growth only, viz. 
the early flowering or n haying” stage* It would seem desir¬ 
able that loss of vigor due to inbreeding in alfalfa should 
be studied by much more refined methods involving careful 
measurements of growth rate at various stages of the plant*s 
development before reliable generalizations can confidently 
be made* One of the difficulties in this procedure is the 
choice of the best criterion of growth rate in alfalfa. It 
was with the object of determining this best criterion that 
this investigation was undertaken* The criteria were con¬ 
ceived to involve methods of measurement and stages of plant 
development at which growth was measured* Several procedures

were adopted for purposes of comparison with each other and 
particularly with that of weighing the growth at different 
developmental stages, which is probably the best criterion, 
but which is not practical because of the necessity of remov 
ing the aerial parts of the plant for each measurement 
reading, which disrupts the continuity of the growth of the 
plant* 

It was decided to study growth measurements in 
terms of radicle elongation, stem number, stem length, node 
number in the stem, and weight of aerial growth after a spe¬ 
cified interval of time* 

LITERATURE REVIEW 


In the study of growth it is desirable to give 
some quantitative expression to the amount of growth which 
is accomplished by a plant or a group of plants during a 
given period of time* The principal measures which have 
been employed for this purpose, as outlined by Meyer and 
Anderson (13) are5 (1) increase in the length of stem, root 

or other organs of the plant; (2) increase in the area of 
leaves; (3) increase in diameter of stem (or other organs); 
(4) increase in volume; (5) dry weight increment; and (6) 
fresh weight increment* 

If increase in length is taken as the measure.

Livingston (11) and Maximov (12) suggest that the simplest 
equipment for this study is a millimeter rule. A horizontal 
microscope or an auxanometer—a self-registering apparatus-- 
may be used for finer and more accurate measurements of 
growth. If the growth of certain organs is used instead of 
that of the whole plant, they (11, 12) describe a method of 
marking the growing organs by means of India ink applied 
with a fine brush. These marks are made at definite distances 
from one another, and the increase in distance is measured at 
certain time intervals. This makes it possible to obtain a 
precise measurement of the changes in length of each portion 
during the experiment, and to ascertain the dimensions of the 
entire growing zone, since only in this region does the dis¬ 
tance between the marks increase. 

A photographic method for measuring and recording 
morphological and physical characters has been described by 
Pack (14 )• With the camera data for innumerable exact measure¬ 
ments and characters which may be used for future reference 
can be easily and quickly recorded. The photographic method 
possesses the advantage of permitting measurements of any 
degree of precision without the growing organ being touched, 
all disturbances of its normal development thus being eli¬ 
minated. 

However, the photographic method requires the use 
of controlled light, which may be impossible or undesirable.

Staniland (17) describes an apparatus which will yield simi¬ 
lar information without the necessity of using controlled 
lighto By the use of this apparatus accurate scale drawings 
can be made of plants for the study of growth changes; the 
investigator can make his drawings at suitable intervals of 
time, thus securing an accurate and permanent record of the 
development of the plant* It consists simply of a peep-hole 
punched through a piece of tin, and a piece of plain glass 
mounted in a frame* The glass is placed between the object 
to be drawn and the peep-hole so that by looking through the 
peep-hole the image of the object can be easily traced on 
the glass* It is a simple apparatus and has many useful 
applications* 

Ipatjev (9), in his study of accurate morphological 
methods for measuring plant growth, suggested two methods. 

To one, the method of comparison of organs corresponding to 
one another, he gave the name "comparative ontogenetic 
method 11 . For example, in a tomato plant the fifth real 
leaves which have attained their maximum development, ceased 
growing, and are liable to decay, are compared. 

His second method, which may conveniently be called 
the "diagram method", consisted of tracing diagrammatically 
the progress of the plant’s development. Here, the order of 
appearance of organs on a plant in the course of its develop¬ 
ment, is recorded* The differences in the expression of a

given organ are shown on the same graph, with the dates of 
their development. 

It is often desirable to study the growth of roots 
and above-ground portions of the plant simultaneously* Goto 
(5), in his study of Halo Blight of oats, was able to do this 
by the use of glass-fronted tin cases, 22 x 12x 1*75 inches 
in size* These were placed at an angle of 45 degrees in 
specially constructed frames. This allowed the roots to 
grow against the glass so that daily observations and measure¬ 
ments could be made of roots and above-ground parts. 

Arndt (2) was able to study all parts of the cotton 
seedlings which were grown in the dark in agar medium in test 
tubes, and was able to make daily observations on all parts 
of the seedling* 

The growing of excised roots in a culture medium 
has proved to be a good method for comparing growth rates of 
different plants. Whaley and Long (23) studied the behavior 
of excised roots of heterotic hybrids and their inbred parents 
in culture media. They found that, in all cultural media the 
excised roots of hybrids of corn grew better than inbreds. 

The measure of total weight is probably the best 
criterion of growth. Tysdal et al (20), in their review of 
alfalfa breeding, concluded that forage yield under field 
conditions is possibly the best criterion of the productivity 
of alfalfa.

Paddick (15) found that he was able to explain the 
dynamics of hybrid vigor in corn through measurement of linear 
growth of seedling radicle and immature leaves at comparable 
positions on plants of the same age* He measured the extent 
as well as speed of development by the number of leaves pro¬ 
duced at a given time* He concluded that whatever hybrid 
vigor was found to be, it was safe to assume that the answer 
would be closely connected with the development of the plant. 

Many workers have studied the relationship of size 
of seed to the subsequent growth of the plant. The work of 
Sprague (16), Kempton and McLane (10), Evans and Johnson (5) 
indicates that large seed size has little if any permanent 
significance. It seems that the msasurement of seed size 
alone would not be a suitable criterion of growth. 

Veatch (2) investigated several characters of soy¬ 
beans with regard to hybrid vigor. He found that hybrids, 
on the average, exceeded the higher parental average in the 
following characters: total yield, number of seeds per plant, 
number of pods per plant, plant weight, height, total stem 
and branch length, number of nodes per plant, and number of 
days between planting and flowering. All these measures 
were good criteria of added vigor exhibited by hybrids as 
compared with parents. 

Internode number and length have been used by many 
workers as measures of growth rate in plants. Anderson and

Schregardus (1), in their study of growth, noted that plants 
may differ from each other, not only in number of internodes 
and their absolute dimensions, but also in the relative size 
of successive intemodes and in the pattern of change of rela¬ 
tive size# 

VS/hen selection is desired for a certain character, 
it is often desirable to determine, if possible, what other 
characters of the plant are associated with it# Sometimes 
certain characters are inherited together# By selecting for 
one, it may then be possible to secure the others. This 
association of characters frequently presents difficulties. 

In alfalfa, Tysdal and Westober (19) noted that selection 
for increased forage production usually gave at the same 
time a coarser and more sparsely leaved plant of poorer 
quality# 

WexeIson (22), in his studies of inbreeding and 
heterosis in red clover, used plant height, weight, stem 
number, and internode length to measure growth. He found 
that no effect of inbreeding on seed weight at the time of 
germination could be demonstrated. However, he noted that 
inbreeding effects were visible at an early stag© of seed¬ 
ling growth, inbred, seedlings being in general weaker than 
crossbreds# This effect might appear immediately after ger¬ 
mination or at a somewhat later stage# He found that dif¬ 
ferences in vigor between inbred and crossbred families

were retained in vegetative propagation* In his correlation 
studies he presented data which showed that depression in 
weight was significantly correlated with depression in height 
and that number of stems and the depression in the latter 
were correlated with depression in internode length* He con¬ 
cluded that depression of plant weight by inbreeding was 
caused by a reduced plant height due to shorter internodes* 

In 1914 Freeman (4) studied correlations between 
various characters in alfalfa and among others found positive 
correlations indicating that nitrogen content was associated 
with percentage of leaves; and green weight with both the 
average number of stems and the average height* He found 
negative correlations indicating that a greater forage yield 
was associated with a smaller percentage of leaves, a greater 
height, a smaller number of stems, and a greater average 
height* He found no significant correlation between thick¬ 
ness of stand and percentage of leaves* 

Hackborth and IJfer (7), in their study of growth 
characters in alfalfa found a high positive correlation 
between forage yield and height and also a positive correla¬ 
tion between height of stem, length of internode and coarse¬ 
ness of stem. Thus, a high-yielding plant was tall and 
upright but of low quality because it had long internodes, 
was sparsely leaved, and had thick woody stems. He also 
found a positive though slight correlation between forage 
production and seed production.

GROWTH CHARACTERISTICS OF ALFALFA 


The alfalfa plant is a long-lived perennial, its 
average length of life being from five to seven years depend¬ 
ing upon environmental conditions. It develops annually 
from a crown, new shoots, or stems, which normally flower 
and set seed. Hayward (8) and Stewart (18) have reported on 
the structure and development of the plant. Their observa¬ 
tions would suggest five specific phases in the life cycle 
of alfalfa: 

(1) syngamy to mature seed 

(2) germination to seedling (first true leaves) 

(3) seedling to flowering 

(4) flower to mature seed 

(5) second and each subsequent year*s growth 

(a) origin of secondary stems to flowering 

(b) flowering to mature seed. 

This study is concerned with the growth rate In 
the second and third phases. 

The second phase represents the first independent 
growth of the young plant. In germination, the primary root 
emerges near the hilum and penetrates the soil rapidly, form¬ 
ing a slender, unbranched tap root. The seedling is epigeal 
and oval cotyledons are raised above the ground as the hypo- 
cotyl elongates and straightens. The first epicotyledonary

slender petiole, while the second, third, and subsequent 
leaves are trifoliate# 

At the beginning of phase three the seedling axis 
is slender with a short first internode, but the second inter¬ 
node may elongate considerably as the plant develops# There 
are buds in the axils of the cotyledons as well as in the 
axil of each trifoliate leaf, and these develop coincidentally 
with the growth of the primary axis to originate the so-called 
crown# Usually, there are three and sometimes four branches 
in addition to the primary axis which form this characteris¬ 
tic crown. When four develop the fourth arises from the 
axillary bud of the first trifoliate leaf, following the 
development of the other three from the cotyledonary buds 
and that of the unifoliate leaf# In the case of vigorous 
growing plants, additional branches may arise from adventi¬ 
tious buds which occur near the bases of the axillary branches# 
The first one usually develops between the branches arising 
from the buds in the axils of the cotyledons# In older 
plants several buds may develop each from any point in the 
periphery of the crown, as designated by Stewart (18) to 
include the perennial portion of the stems of the plant# 

Alfalfa has an indeterminate growth habit# In 
this typical M open rt growth system added vigor is expressed in 
the production of greater linear growth and numbers, rather

FIELD EXPERIMENT 


The first of two studies on growth rate was made 
in the field in the summer of 1946* 

Materials 


The seed used for this experiment was obtained from 
open-pollinated and seventh-generation selfed strains* The 
open-pollinated strains are designated by their common 
varietal names and the selfed strains by the numbers under 
which they were recorded at the University of Alberta* 

It should be pointed out that the selfed strains 
were not derived from the open-pollinated strains used, there¬ 
fore a greater variety of material is represented than would 
have been the case if both selfed and open-pollinated strains 
had come from common origins* 

The two groups, self- and open-pollinated strains, 
were used in order to obtain the widest possible variation 
in growth rates, it being presumed that the self-pollinated 
strains would grow less rapidly.

Experimental Methods 


Five open-pollinated and five selfed strains were 
used. The seeds were first scarified in concehtrated sul¬ 
phuric acid for 18 minutes, then thoroughly washed with tap 
water and dried. They were soaked in petri dishes between 
damp filter paper on June 4, 1946, at 60°F. for 24 hours. 
Then they were planted on summerfallowed land on June 5, 

1946, at the rate of three seeds per hill, each hill being 
regarded as an experimental unit or plot. The hills were 
check-rowed two feet apart each way and arranged in the usual 
random manner into two 10 x 10 adjacent Latin squares. This 
provided ten replicates for each strain in each Latin square. 

Thirty-seven days after planting the hills were 
thinned to one plant each. Several hills, however, had 
failed to produce plants. 

On September 9th and 10th, 1946, all plants were 
cut just above the crown and weighed. 

In order to study radicle elongation and to cor¬ 
relate data thus obtained with weights of field-grown plants, 
seeds of the same experimental strains were planted in up¬ 
right glass-faced cases in the greenhouse. These cases were 
so designed as to allow visual examination of the root at 
intervals throughout its early development. By stacking 
these cases in close contact side by side the glass faces.

and consequently the alfalfa roots, were maintained in a 
state of darkness necessary for normal growth. 

Statistical reduction of data obtained in this 
investigation follows the methods outlined by Goulden (6). 

Methods of Measuring Plant Characters 

The stem heights of plants in the field were 
measured in centimeters from the cotyledonary node to the 
top of the longest stem. These measurements were taken 
twice, at the time of thinning (thirty-seven days after 
planting) and at the time of cutting. The fully opened 
flower clusters on the whole plant also were counted at this 
time. Each plant was weighed immediately after it was cut. 
The stems counted at this time included those arising in the 
axils of the cotyledons at the first node of the primary 
axis, and those from the node of the first trifoliate leaf. 
In the greenhouse the radicle was measured in millimeters 
from the point of emergence from the seed to the extreme 
tip seven days after planting.

The difference between radicle lengths in the two 
groups is highly significant* 

The variability within strains grown in replica¬ 
tion has been computed by the total variance, variance between 
strains, and variance within strains. From the latter are 
calculated standard errors of the means* 

The weighted means of the measured characters for 
open-pollinated and selfed strains are tested for significant 
difference by comparing the difference between their means 
with the standard error of the difference and applying the 
n T n test. There are significant differences between the fol-

There is no significant difference between the open- 
pollinated and selfed groups in height of stem at thirty- 
seven days (P = 0.09), but the heights of stems for the open- 
pollinated groups are consistently higher than those for the 
selfed group and, for this reason, it is considered that the 
difference is very likely real. It is probable that this 
difference could have been calculated as statistically sig¬ 
nificant if the measurement had been made at a later date.

are positively correlated with a high degree of significance* 


Discussion 


As a result of measurements taken in the greenhouse 
it is shown that, in the same length of time, the open- 
pollinated strains produced longer radicles than selfed 
strains* The measurements of characters in the field indi¬ 
cate that the open-pollinated strains exceeded the selfed 
strains in stem length, number of nodes, time of blooming, 
and final green weights* 

The correlations calculated indicate that the 
measurements of radicle length at seven days, stem height at 
37 days, stem height at 109 days, yield approximately the 
same relative information as final weighing on the variabi¬ 
lity in plant vigor of growth for the strains used* 

Prom the data obtained and observations made in 
this experiment it seems that radicle length, stem height, 
number of nodes, number of open flower clusters, and final 
weight, may be good criteria by which to differentiate growth 
rate in open-pollinated and selfed strains of alfalfa*

GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENT 


Since only one year*s results were obtained from 
the field experiment, it was thought that, though greenhouse 
experimental results are not always fairly comparable with 
those obtained under field conditions, some additional valu¬ 
able data on groY<rth measurements might be obtained from a 
greenhouse experiment* It was also desirable to determine 
whether the results obtained in the field could be substan¬ 
tiated by similar measurements taken under greenhouse con¬ 
ditions. 

Materials 


Seeds from three of the five open-pollinated strains 
used in the field were employed here* These were Ranger, 

Ferax, and Kansas. Owing to a shortage of seed, different 
selfed strains from those used in the field had to be utilized. 
They were similar to those used in the field experiment in 
that they were produced under the same conditions, but were 
of different stock material. The seeds were from seventh 
generation selfed plants.

Methods 


The studies on the methods of measuring growth in 
alfalfa were made in the greenhouse with a temperature range 
of 65° to 75°F* during the winter of 1946-47• The soil used 
in the pot cultures was a sterilized mixture consisting of 
one-fourth sand and three-fourths Edmonton black loam* No 
supplementary nutrients were added to the soil* The natural 
daily light period was increased to sixteen hours by means 
of artificial lighting* 

The testa of seeds used wd$ nicked with a razor 

* 

blade and placed between damp filter paper in petri dishes 
at a temperature range of 65° to 75°P. for seventy-two hours* 
The germinated seeds were inoculated with root nodule bac¬ 
teria (Rhizobium meliloti ) isolated from nodules of alfalfa* 
The most vigorous germinated seeds were transplanted, three 
in a pot, on November 5th, to the previously prepared soil 
in ten-inch pots* 

The pots were arranged so that they constituted a 
complete randomized block experimental design with four 
replications of six strains* Each strain "plot" consisted 
of six pots, thus making a total of 36 pots in each repli¬ 
cate* 

Twenty-five days after planting, the seedlings in 
the pots were thinned to two plants per pot* The seedlings

taken from the pots were weighed and measured for stem length. 
The fully opened trifoliate leaves were also counted for each 
plant. The stems were measured from the cotyledonary node 
to the tips of the uppermost leaves when these were extended 
by gentle upward stroking. 

On February 14th—that is, one hundred and one days 
after transplanting—plant heights were measured from the 
soil surface in the pot to the tip of the stem. Stems ten 
centimeters and over in height were the only ones measured. 

The nodes were counted on all measured stems. 

All plants were cut just above the cotyledonary 
node and weighed individually in grams on February 17th, 104 
days after transplanting. 

Experimental Results 


Before proceeding with the above-described experi¬ 
ment, a comparison was made of the weights of open-pollinated 
and the selfed seed in order to determine whether differences 
in subsequent growth rates might be related to differences in 
original seed weights.

There is no significant difference between the 
mean weight per 100 seeds of the open-pollinated and the 
selfed groups, and therefore any difference in later growth 
cannot be attributed to difference in initial seed weight* 
There is a greater variation in seed weight among the open- 
pollinated strains, as might be expected from the varia¬ 
bility among different varieties.

In this experiment the means and their standard 
errors were calculated for the measured characters for open- 
pollinated and selfed groups and the means tested for signi¬ 
ficance, in the same manner as described for Table II. 

There is no significant difference between open- 
pollinated and selfed groups in any of the characters measured 
at this stage. However, the data suggest slightly greater 
stem length for the open-pollinated group.

There is a significant difference in average length of stems, 
the open-pollinated group producing the longest stems* The

Most of the variability in plant weight could 
obviously be accounted for by its association with any one 
of the afore-named characters. These correlations indicate 
that by measuring any of these characters the same relative 
information could be obtained on growth rates as is obtained 
from plant weight. 

Discussion 


Examination of Table V suggests that, except for 
height of stem, there seems to be no difference between the 
open-pollinated and selfed strains at this early stage of 
growth, viz. 25 days. The data indicate that the open- 
pollinated strains may have the longer stems at this stage. 

The final weights of open-pollinated and selfed 
strains (Table VI) are not shown to be statistically dif¬ 
ferent, but the differences are so consistently in favor of 
the open-pollinated strains that it seems fairly safe to 
postulate that the difference is real. 

There is a highly significant difference in stem 
lengths between the two groups (Table VI) but there is no 
difference in the average number of nodes per stem. This 
same relationship was observed on number of nodes per 
longest stem. It would seem that at this stage of growth 
increase in stem length may be due more to an increase in

internode length than to an increase in node number* 

The data from this experiment indicate that growth 
measurements such as weight, total stem length, length of 
longest stem, average length of stem, and average number of 
stems over ten centimeters in length, are all good criteria 
of growth in alfalfa under greenhouse conditions. 

Correlations between weight and the above-mentioned 
measured characters are highly significant. It seems that 
any of these measures will demonstrate the same relative 
information on growth rates. Under greenhouse conditions 
stem length appears to be the best indicator of growth-rate 
differences which exists between open-pollinated and selfed 
strains of alfalfa. 


GENERAL DISCUSSION 


The weight of forage produced has been used as the 
principal criterion of growth and vigor in alfalfa; consequent¬ 
ly, final plant weight was used as on© of the measures of 
growth in these experiments. In experiments reported herein 
other measurements were made and correlated with weight to 
test their comparative value as growth measures. Green weights 
were used as it was desired to get a standard of size increase. 
There was greater variability in green weights in plants

grown under field conditions than in those grown under green¬ 
house conditions* Plant weight was positively correlated 
with length of stem, number of stems, number of nodes, and 
length of radicle. These correlations indicate that criteria 
other than weight measures could be used for studies of growth 
rates in alfalfa. 

In these studies the earliest difference noted 
between the open and selfed strains was that of the linear 
growth of the radicle of seven-day-old seedlings. This 
character was easily measured and seems to be a reliable 
index of existing differences in potential growth rates. 

There was no significant difference in the weights of seeds 
used, but it may be possible that there would have been 
a difference in seed weights if all lots had been produced 
under similar conditions. 

The plant height, as measured by stem length, was 
a good criterion of growth in alfalfa. Measurements of this 
character demonstrated that existing differences in growth 
rates of alfalfa plants could be established at an early 
stage. The differences in growth rate betv/een inbred and 
open-pollinated strains were shown at the time of final 
weighing in both field and greenhouse experiments. The 
total length of stems produced per plant, as measured in the 
greenhouse, indicated that open-pollinated strains produced 
more aerial growth than selfed strains. Plant height is

positively correlated with weight, which indicates that 
heavier plants produced longer stems. 

In alfalfa, leaves, lateral stems, buds, and flowers 
originate at the nodes. Therefore, it would be expected that 
as the number of nodes per plant increased so would the pro¬ 
duction of leaves, lateral stems, pods, and seeds. 

In the field experiment the nodes, as counted on 
the longest stem, were more numerous for the open-pollinated 
strains, but this was not the case in the greenhouse. This 
discrepancy may be due to differences in stage of growth. 

As a result of measurements taken in the field 
experiment and observations made in the greenhouse, it seems 
that the number of basal stems that plants were able to 
produce did not differ appreciably. However, when total 
length of stems produced was measured, it seemed that the 
more vigorous plants produced their basal stems earlier, and 
these grew longer in the same length of time. The total 
length of stems measured under greenhouse conditions indi¬ 
cated that open-pollinated plants had the greater total stem 
length. 

The data on the earliness of flowering are meagre. 
Observations of this characteristic in the field indicated 
that open-pollinated strains were earlier blooming than the 
selfed strains, and it seems likely that they would conse¬ 
quently be earlier maturing. 

The data from these experiments indicate that the

best criteria of growth rates for the alfalfa strains used 
were: green weights, plant height, total stem length, and 
radicle length* 

SUMMARY 


1* Alfalfa growth rate was measured in terms of 
radicle elongation, stem number, stem length, and node num¬ 
ber, at specified time intervals, after placing the seeds 
under germination conditions, and these characters were cor¬ 
related with weight of aerial growth. 

2* The difference in growth rates between open- 
pollinated and selfed strains was measured in the greenhouse 
at the seedling stage by radicle elongation. 

3. Early in the development of the plants there 
was a differential growth rate between open-pollinated and 
selfed strains, as shown by measurements of stem length in 
both the field and greenhouse experiments. 

4. When the plants of the field experiment were 
harvested there were differences observed in length of longest 
stem, number of nodes, number of open flower clusters, and 
weight of plants, in favor of the open-pollinated group in 


all cases

5. At the time plants were harvested in the green¬ 
house there were significant differences in length of longest 
stem, total length of stem, number of stems exceeding ten 
centimeters in length, between open-pollinated and selfed 
strains* This corroborates the evidence of superiority of 
the open-pollinated strains in the field experiment. There 
was no significant difference in weights between the open- 
pollinated and selfed strains, but it is considered that the 
difference is real and in favor of the open-pollinated groups. 
There was no inter-group difference in the number of nodes 
per measured stem. 

6. Under conditions of these experiments, length 
of radicle, length of longest stem, total stem length, num¬ 
ber of stems over ten centimeters, were the best criteria of 
growth rates for the strains of alfalfa used in this study. 

7. Prom the high correlations between these growth 
characters and weight it would appear that any of these may 
be used as a substitute for weight of aerial parts in esti¬ 
mating the relative rates of growth of alfalfa plants.
