ABSTRACT 


The binding of the red thiazine dyes, phenothiazone 
and thionol, by serum albumin, spleen nucleoprotein and 
yeast nucleic acid, was studied by the. equilibrium dialysis method. 
A small degree of binding of phenothiazone was observed for 
these compounds. Only serum albumin bound thionol to any 
appreciable extent. 

The inhibition of sdme respiratory enzymes by phenothiazine 
and its biologically significant derivatives was also studied. 
Suecinoxidase was strongly inhibited by phenothiazine, 
phenothiazone and phenothiazine o-sulfoxide, and slightly 
inhibited by thionol. Cytochrome oxidase was slightly 
activated by the drugs. Hexokinase was strongly inhibited 
by phenothiazone and slightly inhibited by phenothiazine and 
sulfoxide. 

The results are discussed in relation to the mode of 
action of phenothiazine as an anthelmintic.

GENERAL IITTKODUCTIOIT 

Phenothiazine was first described by Bernthsen in 
1885 (1) and remained a laboratory curiosity until 1934 
when it was found to have promising properties as an 
insecticide (2). In 1938 Harwood, Swanson and Jerstad (3) 
discovered it was an anthelmintic for ascarid and nodular 
worms in swine. Since then it has been widely used for the 
treatment of worms in cattle, sheep and swine. 

Phenothiazine has also been used in the treatment of 
pinworms in humans (4), and as a urinary antiseptic (5). 

The tuberculostatic action of phenothiazine has also been 
reported (6). 

The oxidation products of phenothiazine have been shown 
by Collier (7) and Collier and Allen (8), to be powerful, 
enzyme inhibitors. The structural relationship of pheno¬ 
thiazine and its oxidized derivatives are shown in Pig. 1. 

The present investigation is a continuation of the 
work of Collier and his associates, to investigate further 
the site of action of phenothiazine. The work is presented 
in two parts; the first dealing with the binding of 
phenothiazine derivatives by proteins and nucleic acid, 
and the second concerns further studies of enzyme inhibition. 

Phenothiazine is a pale yellow crystalline compound 
and is readily oxidized on exposure to air, light and 
moisture. It is also easily oxidized in the body and the

first observations on the fate of orally administered 
phenothiazine were made by De Eds, Eddy and Thomas in 
1938 (9). They studied the urinary excretion products 
in rats, rabbits and man. After treating the urine with

concluded was present in the urine as a ?/ater soluble 
conjugate which had been broken down by acidification.

leucothionol, and concluded that the red color developed

by urine on exposure to air, was due to the oxidation of 
leucotnionol to thionol. 

In a later paper however, De Eds and Thomas (10) 
showed that the substance which they had previously reg¬ 
arded as leucothionol, was actually leucophenothiazone• 

They concluded that both the thionol-leucothionol and the 
phenothiazone-leucophenothiazone systems were present in 
the urine of rats, rabbits and man. 

The sheep was shown by Lipson (11) in 1940 to excrete 
phenothiazine, leucophenothiazone and leucothionol in the 

urine. Collier (12) identified phenothiazine in the faeces 
of a sheep and an ethereal sulphate of leucophenothiazone 

in the urine, blood serum and milk. Later, using Lipson 1 s 
chromatographic method, Collier, Allen and Swales (13) 
showed that the pigment in urine of sheep consists almost 
entirely of leucophenothiazone with a trace of leucothionol. 

De Eds and Thomas (14) have shown that in man, rabbits 
and dogs, the oral administration of phenothiazine results 
in the biliary excretion of phenothiazine, thionol and 
leucophenothiazone. After dosing a sheep with phenothiazine 
Collier et al. (13) found a conjugate of phenothiazone in 
the bile. The rumen of the same animal contained pheno¬ 
thiazone as well as unchanged phenothiazine. They concluded 
that phenothiazine is rapidly oxidized to phenothiazone 


in the rumen

Clare (15) was unable to find phenothiazone in the 
rumen, but has reported the presence of phenothiazine 
o-sulfoxide in the rumen of a sheep after dosing with 
phenothiazine. Harpur, Swales and Denstedt (16) confirmed 

the findings of Clare that phenothiazine is not normally 

not 

oxidized to phenothiazone in the rumen but could^confirm 
the presence of the sulfoxide. 

It is evident that the fate of phenothiazine in the 
body is subject to species variation. In general the 
metabolic products are phenothiazone, thionol and possibly 
the sulfoxide. It is not known whether the anthelmintic 
action of phenothiazine is due to its oxidation products 
or to unchanged phenothiazine. There is however, some 
speculation that the oxidation products may be the active 
forms of the drug 0 

De Eds and Thomas (14) report an experiment in which 
thionol completely inactivated hog ascaris in vitro while 
phenothiazine was without effect. Collier (7) reported 
that neither phenothiazine or thionol had an effect on 
Ascaris lumbricoides in vitro. 

Harpur et al. (16) observed that 11 'ilhen ruminants are 
dosed with phenothiazine a strong anthelmintic action 
occurs immediately posterior to the rumen. In monogastric 
herbivores, which have a comparitively large caecum to 
replace in part, the digestive function of the rumen,

the most efficient anthelmintic action appears to take 
place in, and posterior to the caecum. In carnivores in 
which there is no organ analogous to the large active 
rumen or caecum of the herbivores, phenothiazine is not 
anthelmintic even to hookworms (Ancylostomedea), which 
are easily destroyed by this chemical in ruminants.” 

Since oxidation products of phenothiazine are not 
normally found in the rumen, (15) (16) it is possible 
that the anthelmintic action is due to some changed 
form of the drug which is present posterior to the rumen 
or caecum. Harpur et al. however do not believe that 
the oxidation products are responsible, but hold that 
the anthelmintic action of phenothiazine is due to the 
unabsorbed but not necessarily unaltered fraction of 
the drug. However Clare, Whitten and Filme.r (17) in a 
preliminary experiment found that the sulfoxide did show 
anthelmintic activity, although not more efficient than 
phenothiazine itself. 

Thus there is little direct evidence that the anthelmintic 
properties of phenothiazine may be due to one of its metabolic 
products. In fact Gordon and Lipson (IS) tried phenothiazone 
and thionol as an anthelmintic without effect. Neverthe¬ 
less the oxidation products of phenothiazine do have 
some remarkable biological properties. The bactericidal 
properties of the urine of animals dosed with pheno-

thiazine was shown by Thomas, De Eds and Eddy (19) to 
be due to the presence of thionol. Collier (7) 
demonstrated that leucophenothiazone, leucothionol and 
thionol strongly inhibited mammalian catalase and the 
cytochrome system, while phenothiazine itself had no 
effect on catalase. The inhibition of serum cholines¬ 
terase activity by phenothiazone has been reported by 
Collier and Allen (20). These workers also reported 
a powerful inhibition of catalase by phenothiazine 
o-sulfoxide and an inhibition of succinoxidase and 
succinic dehydrogenase by phenothiazone and thionol (8).

SECTION I 


The Binding of Phenothiazine Derivatives by Proteins 
and Nucleic Acid 


INTRODUCTION 

Protein Binding 

The Diological properties of the oxidizea derivatives 
of phenothiazine have oeen described in the general 
introduction. It appeared that these properties might 
be due to an affinity for proteins and other biological 
materials. As early as 1909 Ehrlich (21) observed the 
affinity of tissue proteins for dyes, and proposed tnat 
chemical combination of drugs with tissue constituents 
was necessary for pharmacological action (22). These 
ff chemoreceptors ,! as he called them, are known to be 
enzymes. 

The difficulty in obtaining enzyme protein in a 
sufficiently homogeneous state has precluded an extensive 
study of drug-enzyme interactions. The plasma proteins 
on the other hand, have been widely studied Decause of 
their availability and known homogeneity, (ioldstein (23) 
has exhaustively reviewed the subject of drug binding 
by plasma proteins; and Scatchard (24) has also recently 
discussed the interactions between protein and small 






- 8 - 


molecules and ions. Klotz and his collaborators have 
made numerous contributions to the general problem of 
protein binding (25) (26). 

The major portion of this work however, has done 
little to elucidate the nature of drug action. 

Goldstein (23) emphasizes that only in isolated instances 
does the affinity for plasma proteins parallel the primary 
potency of a drug. Davis and Wood (27) found a parallel 
in the sulfonamide series but even here, acetylation 
abolished antibacterial action without affecting protein 
binding. 

Nucleic Acid and Nucleoprotein Binding 

The ability of nucleic acids to bind cationic dyes 
has been known for some time, but not until recently has 
any systematic and quantitative attempt been made to study 
this phenomenon. In 1945 Michaelis and Granick (28) 
observed the spectrophotometric changes of thiazines and 
other dye stuffs in the presence of nucleic acid. 

Recently Irvin, Irvin and Parker (29) described the 
interaction of acridines and quinolines with nucleic acid. 
This was probably the first indication that the binding 
of drugs by nucleic acid may be related to drug potency, 
since it had been shown previously by other workers that 
ribonucleic acid was able to reverse the growth inhibition

by acridines, of certain bacteria (30) (31), yeast (32) 
and bacterial viruses (33) (34). 

The inhibitory action of nucleic acid on the activity 
of streptomycin has been observed (35) and Di Marco and 
Boretti (36) and Cohen (37) have described the binding 
of this antibiotic by ribonucleic acid. Mitchell(38) 
found that penicillin caused a disturbance of the 
nucleotide-nucleic acid balance. However he did not study 
the binding of penicillin by nucleic acid. 

These observations lend support to the hypothesis 
that the antibacterial action of streptorr^cin and possibly 
other drugs, is due to an affinity for nucleic acid; the 
bound nucleic acid being unable to combine with basic 
proteins and thus the synthesis of some important 
nucleoprotein may be disturbed.

Materials 

Commercial phenothiazine (Merck)was recrystallized 
from benzene, washed with hexane and dried in vacuo. The 
product, large pale yellow plates melting at 184,3 - 
185.7*C. (corr) (39) was used in the preparation of 
the derivatives. 

Thionol was prepared by the method of Granick and 
Michaelis (40) with a modification in reaction time as 
described by Houston, Kester and De Eds (41). The molar 
extinction coefficient (maximum optical density divided 
by molar concentration) of the thionol dissolved in 
0.01 M NaOH was 61,000 as compared with the value of 
63,000 found by Granick and Michaelis. 

Phenothiazone was prepared by the method of Pummerer 
and Gassner (42). The crude product was recrystallized 
from water to give microscopic brick-red needles which 
melted at 159 - 163°C . (corr.) 

Phenothiazine o-sulfoxide was prepared by a modification 
(42) of the method of Barnett and Smiles (43). 

The product was recrystallized from alcohol and melted 
at 249.7 - 250.6°C. (corr.) 

Crystalline bovine plasma albumin was the product of 
Armour Laboratories, Chicago. Yeast nucleic acid

(Eimer and Amend) was purified by reprecijjitation 
according to Viseller and Chargaff's (44) modification 
or the method of Fletcher, Gulland, Jordan and Dibben (45). 
Total P content of a dried sample was determined by the 
method of Fiske and Subbarow (46) and found to be 8.75%. 

For a sample prepared by the same method Irvin et al.(29) 
reported 8.8% P. The calculated theoretical value is 
9.5% P. 

Nucleoprotein was prepared from calf spleen by the 
procedure of Mirsky and Pollister (47) as modified by 
Petermann and Lamb (48). The final solution in 0.001 M 
sodium citrate was analysed for P by the method of Fiske 
and Subbarow (46) and for N by the micro-kjeldahl method (49). 
It was found to contain 0.22 mg. of N and 0.032 mg. of 
P per ml. 

The high N:P ratio, (6.9 compared with 3.89 reported 
by Mirsky and Pollister (47) ), indicated that the product 
was not pure nucleoprotein but may have contained excess 
histone. If it is assumed that all the P was nucleoprotein 
P, and that spleen nucleoprotein contains about 4% P (47), 
then the nucleoprotein concentration of the solution v/as 
about 0.08%.

Methods 

All binding experiments were carried out in 0.05 M 
phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 unless otherwise stated. 

Binding was detected qualitatively by the spectrophoto- 
metric method of Klotz (50). The Beckman model DU 
spectrophotometer was used to obtain spectral absorption 
curves of the dyes, in the presence and in the absence 
of the binding substance at room temperature. (All readings 
were corrected for light absorption, if any, by the 
binding substance alone.) 

Dye concentrations were determined spectrophotomet- 
rically at 590 mji for thionol, 385 mp for phenothiazone, 
and 269 mp for the sulfoxide. The dyes were found to obey 
Beer’s law in the range of concentrations employed. The 
calibration curves for the dyes are shown in Fig. 2. 

In practice, dye concentrations were determined from the 
relation

where £ mol. s molar extinction coefficient of the dye, 

A =■ optical density (log I 0 / log I), 

G = molar concentration of the dye.

results are given in Table 1. The mean value of 6mol. 
thus obtained was used in the equation C = A/£mol. to 
calculate the concentrations of the dye solutions.

permitted the use of low concentrations only. Hence 
quantitative measurements were made by the equilibrium 
dialysis method of Klotz, Walker and Pivan (51). 

A series of dye solutions of varying concentrations, in 
buffer was prepared. Unless otherwise stated, 25 ml. 
volumes of dye solution were placed in flasks, and in these 
were immersed cellophane bags containing 10 ml.of the 
binding substance dissolved in buffer. The flasks were 
stoppered and dialysis allowed to proceed at 5°C for 72 
hours with occasional agitation of the system. Preliminary 
experiments indicated that equilibrium between inner and 
outer solutions was reached in less than 72 hours. (Table 2)

At the end of that period, the concentrations of 
free dye in the outer solutions were estimated spectro- 
photometrically and compared with the concentrations of 
control solutions dialysed against buffer alone. The 
difference in concentration represented the amount of 
bound dye ( total volume of system 35 ml. ) 

There was a slight adsorption of the dyes by the 
cellophane tubes, but it was assumed to be the same in 
all tubes and consistent results were obtained in replicate 
dialysis experiments. 

Binding constants were calculated from the mass law 
equation by the method of -Klotz (52). If it be assumed 
that all groups on a protein molecule capable of inter¬ 
action, have identical affinities for dye molecules, and 
that the affinity of any group is unaffected by the 
combination of dye molecules with other groups, several 
related equations can be derived from the mass law. 

Pf + (X) ^ PfX 

(pf) (X) 

——_ - K 

(PfX) 

where (Pf) is the total concentration of free receptors, 

(X) is the concentration of unbound drug, 

(PfX) is the concentration of combined receptors, 

K is the dissociation constant.

Let n 'be the number of receptor groups carried by each 
protein molecule, and P be the molar concentration of 
total protein. Then nP represents the total concentration 
of receptors, (PfX) + (Pf). Substituting (Pf) = n? - (PfX) 
in the mass law equation and rearranging, results in 
the expression 

[k + (X)J (PfX) = nP(X) 

Let r be the moles of dye bound per mole of total protein, 
or (PfX)/P. Then 

(PfX) n(X)

This expression is identical in form with the Langmuir 
isotherm, which is a theoretically valid expression of 
the facts of adsorption. 

The equation can be rearranged in various ways for 
convenient plotting to yield values of n and K by 
extrapolation. It was found convenient to use the 
equation in the form.

where r - moles of bound dye per mole of binding substance, 

n - number of binding sites per mole of binding substance, 
(X) - concentration of free dye, 

K - dissociation constant of the complex.

Values of 1/r were plotted against l/(X) and the 
regression of 1/r on 1/(X) was calculated for each set of 
data. From the regression equations the values of the binding 
constants n and K were obtained using the following 
relations: (1) when 1/(X)= 0, then 1/r= 1/n 5 (2) the 
regression coefficient = K/n. The regression egimtion 
is of the form 

Y = mx + b 

where m = regression coefficient - K/n 
x = 1/(X), 
b = 1 /r. 

In accordance with the procedure of Klotz et al. (51) 
each point was weighted in proportion to the concentration 
of free dye, in order to give the high concentrations 
more nearly equal influence with the lower 'ones in the 
calculation of the regression. 

The quantitative binding data are plotted in Figs. 4, 6 , 
and 8, where the regression equations are represented by 
solid lines for the unweighted values and broken lines 
for the weighted values. In each instance the slope of 
the straight line equals K/n and the ordinal intercept 
equals 1 /n.

HESULTS 

The limited solubility of phenothiazone and thionol 
in aqueous solution precluded the use of a wide range of 
concentrations and therefore the binding constants are 
subject to some uncertainty. However, all the regressions were 
analysed statistically and the standard error of the 
regression coefficient calculated. All the regression 
coefficients were highly significant, with values of t 
(the regression coefficient divided by its standard error) 
ranging from 16 to 56 as shown in Table 8. 

It was found by trial that varying the values of the 
regression coefficients by twice their standard error did 
not greatly alter the estimated values of n and K. Hence 
the calculated binding constants are certainly correct 
as to order of magnitude. 

Plasma Albumin 

The effect of 0.01% plasma albumin upon the absorption 

spectrum of phenot'niazone (1.4 x 10~ fa M) and of thionol 

-5 

(1.5 x 10 Mv) is illustrated in Fig. 3. Binding of the 
dyes by the protein is qualitatively demonstrated by a 
depression of the absorption curve. There was however, 
little or no shift in the peak of the curve. 

The strong absorption of light by albumin in the ultra 
violet region of the spectrum, made it difficult to

demons trate binding of phenothiazine o-sulfoxide by 
plasma albumin. There appeared to be a slight depression 
of the absorption curve but the results were not conclusive 
and are not reported here.

For the determination of the binding constants, 
solutions of the dyes were dialysed against 1.45 * 10"' 1 ’ 

M albumin in buffer-and duplicate runs were made for 
each dye. Preliminary trials indicated that the binding 
of sulfoxide by serum albumin was too small to be measured 
by the equilibrium dialysis technique. 

Experimental data and details of calculation for the 
binding of thionol by albumin are given in Table 3. 

Only experimental data and values of 1/r and 1/(X) are 
given for the remaining interactions. The interaction 
data for phenothazone are given in Table 4. The results 
of the two experiments are illustrated in Fig. 4 and

binding, without a shift in the absorption maximum. 
Depolymerization of the nucleic acid by treatment with 
0.05 M NaOH at 30°C for five hours resulted in reduced 
binding as shown by the broken line in Fig. 5. 

Equilibrium dialysis was carried out with solutions 
of the dyes dialysed against 0.05% solutions of nucleic 
acid. Since the molecular v/eight of the nucleic acid was 
not known, an approximate value of 20,000 (45) was adopted 
for purposes of calculation. Binding constants were also 
calculated on the basis of moles of dye bound per gram 
-atom of P in the nucleic acid. ( A molecular weight of 
20,000 corresponds to about 56 atoms of P per molecule) 
Experimental data are given in Tables 5 and 6 and 
illustrated in Fig. 6. The binding constants calculated 
from the graphs are listed in Table 8.

Nucleoprotein 

The nucleoprotein was preserved in 0.001 M sodium 
citrate, and for the "binding experiments a 0.01 M 
phosphate buffer was used to minimize dissociation of the 
nucleoprotein. The effect of nucleoprotein on the spectral 
curves of phenothiazone and thionol are shown in Fig. 7. 

The curves were obtained by mixing equal volumes of the

dyes in buffer and the nucleoprotein in citrate. Thus 
the final concentration of buffer was 0.005 M, and that 
of the nucleoprotein corresponded to 1.6 mg. P per 100 ml. 
(0.04% nucleoprotein.) The final concentration of 
phenothiazone and thionol was 1.5 x 10 M* The spectral 
absorption curves were depressed, again with no shift in 
the absorption maxima. The depression of the thionol 
curve was small, indicating only a limited binding of the 
dye and for this reason the binding constants of thionol 
were not determined. 

For the determination of the binding constants, 5 ml. 
of the nucleoprotein solution containing 0.16 mg. P, was 
dialysed against 10ml. of phenothiazone in 0.01 M 
phosphate buffer,, The results are given in Table 7 and 
Fig. 8. Since the molecular weight of the nucleoprotein 
was unknown, binding constants were based on the moles of 
dye bound per gram atom of P. The constants are given in 
Table 8.

DISCUSSION 

The results obtained by the equilibrium dialysis 
method are summarized in Table 8. The binding constants 
are: n, the maximum number of binding sites occupied per 
mole of binding substance, and K, the dissociation constant 
of the complex. More intense binding is represented by a 
small value of K or a large value of -log K. 

Phenothiazone and thionol are bound to about the same 
extent by plasma albumin, the maximum number of available 
binding sites being two per mole of protein. This value 
is very low compared with n values of 11 for the dye T-1842 
(53), 14 for alkyl sulphates (54) and 22 for methyl orange (51) 
In the present investigation the range of dye concentrations 
was limited by their low solubility, and all the potential 
binding sites on the protein molecule may not have been 
saturated by the dyes. Karush and S: 0 nenberg (54) have 
pointed out the uncertainty of estimating binding constants 
from the extrapolation of 1/r, especially when the ratio 
of bound to free dye is low. 

Karush (55) investigated the binding of the dye 
p-(2-hydroxy-5 methylphenylazo)-benzoic acid and found a 
two-constant equation to be the best expression of the 
interaction. He found that the 22 binding sites could be 
divided into two groups. The first group consisted of 
















. 







' 






































. 











■ 



-36- 


about five sites per protein molecule with a relatively 
large binding constant, and the second group comprised 
about 17 sites with a much smaller affinity for the dye. 

He suggested that the K values for the two groups are 
average values and that there may be a gradual decrease in 
affinity among the various binding sites. It is probable 
therefore,that under the conditions of the experiment, 
plasma albumin has only two binding sites available with an 
affinity great enough to bind phenothiazone and thionol. 

However, the binding of these two dyes may be due to 
van der Waals 1 forces involving the heterocyclic nucleus 
and H-bond formation through the polar groups, rather 
than to specific sites on the protein molecule. It is 
generally agreed that electrostatic forces are involved in 
binding and that the points of attachment are cationic 
groups on the protein molecule. (56) This concept involves 
ionization of both the interacting molecules, but for the 
binding of phenothiazone and thionol, ionization of the 
dyes does not seem to be an important factor. Thionol 
has a pK value of 5.7 (40) and therefor exists largely 
as the phenolate ion at pH 7.4. Phenothiazone, with a 
pK value of -0.3 (57), can accept protons only at very 
high acidities and must be virtually unionized at pH 7.4. 
Yet the n values of these two compounds with plasma albumin 



-37- 


are almost identical. 

The dissociation constants for binding of the dyes by 
plasma albumin indicate a somewhat tighter binding than 
has been reported for other organic ions. The -log K 
values were found to be 4.6 for phenothiazone and 4.7 

for thionol. For the binding of methyl orange by plasma 

-4 

albumin, Klotz et al. found a K value of 4.48 * 10 
(-log K = 3.35) ? (51) and Smith and Briggs (58) obtained 
3.12 x 10" 4 (-log K = 3.51). 

The effect of nucleic acids on the metachromatic 
staining with, thiazines and other basic dyes was originally 
observed by Michaelis and Graniek (28). Other workers 
have recently reported shifting of the absorption spectra 
of various dyes by nucleic acids. (59) (36) (60) (29) 

The binding of phenothiazone and thionol by yeast 
nucleic acid was demonstrated qualitatively by a depression 
of the spectral absorption curves of these dyes. By the 
dialysis method, the maximum number of binding sites was 
found to be three for phenothiazone and less than one for 
thionol, based on a molecular weight of 20,000 for 
nucleic acid. 

These values are much lower than those reported by 
Cavalieri and Angelos (61) for the binding of rosanaline 
hydrochloride by thymus nucleic acid. Using a two-constant

equation to express their results they found values of 
0.16 for n^ and 23.84 for n 2 (a maximum of 24 binding sites 
based on a molecular weight of 35,000 for thymus nucleic 
acid.) 

The dissociation constants for phenothiazone and 
thionol were similar, with -log K values of 3.5 and 3.6 
respectively. These values are of the same order of 
magnitude as reported for other dyes. Irvin et al. (29) 
found -log K values in the range of 2.5 - 3.8 for the 
binding of acridines and quinolines by yeast nucleic acid. 
Cavalieri and Angelos (61) for the binding of rosanaline 
hydrochloride, reported -log K values of 5.6 for the first 
dissociation constant and 3.8 for the second. 

Studies on the binding of phenothiazone by impure spleen 
nucleoprotein resulted in slightly higher value of n than 
was obtained for yeast nucleic acid, when calculated on 
the basis of P content. Possibly the same types of binding 
sites were occupied on the two compounds. However the values of 
-log K was 4.3 as compared'with 3.6 for nucleic acid. 

Parker, Irvin and Irvin (62) found -log K values in the 
range 3.7 - 4.3 for the interaction of various acridines 
and quinolines with spleen nucleoprotein.

SbMMARY 

Binding of the red thiazine dyes, phenothiazone and 
thionol, by plasma albumin, yeast nucleic acid and spleen 
nucleoprotein has been observed spectrophotometrically. 
Binding constants have been determined by the equilibrium 
dialysis method. Binding of phenothiazine o-sulfoxide 
by albumin could not be demonstrated. 

Results indicate that the binding of phenothiazone 
and thionol is not extensive: relatively few binding sites 
are available. Nevertheless the dissociation constants 
indicate a moderately strong binding and are of the same 
order of magnitude as the constants reported for other dyes. 

Since the ionization of the dyes does not appear to be 
an important factor, the binding by serum albumin may be 
due to van der Waals. 1 forces and H-bond formation. These 
forces may also account for the binding of the dyes by 
nucleic acid. Phenothiazone and thionol are not basic 
dyes and extensive binding by the acid groups of the nucleic 
acid would not be expected. 

This study has contributed little to the problem of the 
mode of action of phenothiazine but a further study of the 
binding of the dyes by nucleic acid may be of some value.

SECTION II 

The Effect of Phenothiazine and Phenothiazine 
Derivatives on Some Respiratory Enzymes 

INTRODUCTION 

The first attempt to explain the mode of action of 
phenothiazine was made by Collier (7) in 1940* He studied 
the effect of phenothiazine derivatives on enzymes and 
found that catalase was strongly inhibited by thionol, 
leucothionol and leucophenothiazone, but not by phenoth- 
iazone or phenothiazine. The inhibition of cytochrome 
oxidase by leucophenothiazone and thionol was also demonstrated 

These observations were confirmed in 1942 by Collier 
and Allen (8), who also reported the inhibition of catalase 
by phenothiazine o-sulfoxide; the inhibition of succinoxidase 
by phenothiazon'e and of succinic dehydrogenase by 
phenothiazone and thionol. Phenothiazone was reported by 
Collier and Allen (20), to be a powerful inhibitor of 
serum cholinesterase, but was without effect on alkaline 
phosphatase or serum lipase. 

Subsequent investigations have led many workers to 
conclude that the metabolic products of phenothiazine 
are not responsible for the anthelmintic action of 
phenothiazine.(15) (16) (18) It is believed that 









* 

. 

, 








- 

. 

■ 




-41- 


phenothiazine itself, or some as yet unidentified 
derivative, is the true anthelmintic agent. Some salient 
facts in support of this belief are: (1) phenothiazone 
and thionol have no anthelmintic action (18); (2) thionol 
has no effect on Ascaris lumbricoides in vitro (7). 

However, Clare, Whitten and Filmer (17) have reported 
that phenothiazine o-sulfoxide has a definite anthelmintic 
action and De Eds and Thomas (14) have advanced the view 
that in vitro, thionol is more toxic to worms than 
phenothiazine. Further, Collier (7) has shown that pheno¬ 
thiazine is without effect on hog ascaris in vitro. 

In view of the preceding observations, it was considered 
advisable to investigate the effect of phenothiazine and 
its sulfoxide on enzyme systems. In the present investig¬ 
ation the effect of phenothiazine and its derivatives on 
suceinoxidase and cytochrome oxidase has been determined. 
Considering the anaerobic environment of worms in the 
gastro-intestinal tract, the effect of these compounds on 
enzymes of the anaerobic phase of glycolysis was studied 
also. Unfortunately, due to technical difficulties, hexo- 
kinase was the only enzyme tested.

EXPERIMSNTAL 

Materials 

Phenothiazine and derivatives prepared for the binding 
studies were used for the enzyme inhibition work. The 
preparation of these compounds has been described previously. 

A suspension of mitochondria, prepared from rat liver 
by the method of Schneider (63) was used as a source of 
succinoxidase and cytochrome oxidase. The animals were 
killed by decapitation and the livers v/ere removed and placed 
in cold isotonic (0.25 M> sucrose. In all subsequent operations 
the temperature was maintained at 0-5 °C. 

The chilled livers were blotted and 0.9 gm. portions 
were homogenized in 20 ml. ice cold isotonic sucrose using 
the Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (64). The homogenate was 
centrifuged for 10 minutes at 600g to remove nuclei and 
cell debris. The supernatant was removed and the sediment 
crashed twice by resuspension in 5 ml. of isotonic sucrose 
and recentrifugation at 600g for 10 minutes. The super¬ 
natant and washings were combined and centrifuged for 10 
minutes at 8500g to sediment the mitochondria. The mito¬ 
chondria were washed twice by resuspension in 5 ml. of 
isotonic sucrose and recentrifugation at 8500g for 10 min¬ 
utes. The washed mitochondria were suspended in 25 ml.

of isotonic sucrose and stored in the cold room at 5 °G 
until use. Fresh preparations were made each day. 

All of the centrifugations were made in the Inter¬ 
national refrigerated centrifuge model PR-1, at 0°G. 

The centrifugations at 600g were made with the No.824 
head and those at 8500g were made with the high speed 
attachment and the No.295 head. The centrifugal forces 
designated refer to the centers of the tubes employed and 
were calculated from the formulae given in the International 
Centrifuge Co. Information Bulletin No. 1, 1947. 

A rat brain homogenate was used as a source of hexo- 
kinase. One rat brain was homogenized in cold 0.028 M 
glucose and the homogenate made up to 10 ml. with the 
glucose solution. The homogenization was done in glucose 
solution to preserve the activity of the hexokinase. 

Berger, Slein, Colowick and Cori (65) reported a substant- 
ial loss in hexokinase activity when stored in the absence 
of glucose. 

Adenosine triphosphate (Sigma), supplied as the barium 
salt, was converted to the sodium salt by the method of 
Kunitz and McDonald (66). Cytochrome C (Sigma) was dissolved 
in distilled water and standardized in the Evelyn color¬ 
imeter (67). 

Sodium succinate was prepared from reagent grade

succinic acid (Certified Chemical Co.) by adjusting a 
solution of the acid to pH 7.4 with M NaOH. Sodium 
ascorbate was prepared in the same manner from ascorbic 
acid (Winthrop Chemical Co.) immediately before use. 

Methods 

Enzyme activity was measured manometrically in Summer- 
son differential manometers at pH 7.4 and 37.°0 C unless 
otherwise stated. The manometers were calibrated with 
mercury by the method given in Manometric Techniques (67) 
page 50 - 51, for the separate calibration of flasks and 
manometers. Flask constants were calculated according to 
the procedure outlined in Manometric Techniques, page 2-4. 
Brodie’s solution 'was used as the manometer fluid. 

The volume of gas taken up or evolved during a reaction 
was calculated from the relation: 

X - hk 

where X = volume of gas in jxL., 

h - manometer reading in mm., 
k - the flask constant. 

Succinoxidase activity was measured by the method of 
Schneider and Potter (68). Due to the low solubilities 
of the drugs, it was necessary to modify the volumes and 
concentrations of the reaction medium in order to obtain 












. 

















































-45- 


the drugs in the desired concentration. However the 
final concentrations were the same as used by Schneider 
and Potter. 

The drugs v;ere dissolved in 0.05 M phosphate buffer 
of pH 7.4 and 2.0 ml. of this solution v/as added to both 
reaction and compensator flasks of the test manometer. 

In each flask of the control manometer was placed 2.0 ml. 
of buffer alone. The substrate, 0.2 ml, of sodium succinate 
was added to the side arm of each reaction flask. 

The remaining components were added to the main body 

-4 

of each flask. These were; 0.1 ml. of 4 * 10 M 

-2 

cytochrome-C, O.f ml. of 1.2 * 10 M AICI3 , 0.1ml. 

-2 

of 1.2 * 10 M CaCl2j 0.5 ml. of mitochondria suspension, 
and buffer to make the volume up to 3 ml. The center wells 
of all flasks contained 0.2 ml. of 30% KOH and a folded 
strip of filter paper. 

Phenothiazine was too insoluble to be added in buffer solu¬ 
tion. It was dissolved in 95% ethyl alcohol and 0.1 ml. 
of this solution was added to the test flasks. An equal 
amount of alcohol was added to the control flasks as 
alcohol was found to have an inhibitory effect on succin- 
oxidase. 

After the flasks were filled and attached to the 
manometers they were placed in the water oath at 37°G and 
gassed for 10 minutes with oxygen. The cocks were then

closed and the substrate was tipped in. Headings were 
made at five minute intervals for 45 minutes and the rate 
of oxygen uptake remained constant for at least 30 minutes. 

The effect of the drugs on cytochrome oxidase was 
studied by the method of Schneider and Potter (68). The 
drugs were dissolved in 0.05 M phosphate buffer and 1.8 
ml. of the solution was added to each flask of the test man¬ 
ometer. The substrate, 0.7 ml. of 4 * 10M cytochrome-C, 
was added to the side arms of the reaction flasks of each 
manometer. This amount was found to be sufficient to 
saturate the system. To the main body of each flask was 
added, 0.1 ml. of 1.2 * 10“ 2 M A1C1 3 , 0.3. ml. of 0.114 M 

sodium ascorbate, 0.1 ml. of mitochondria suspension 
and buffer to make the volume up to 3 ml. The center wells 
contained 0.2 ml. of 30% KOH solution and a strip of filter 
paper, Phenothiazine dissolved in alcohol was added to 
the test flasks as described previously. 

Hexokinase studies were made by Veil-Malherbe and 
Bone’s (69) adaption of Golowick and Kalckar’s original 

method (70). The method is based on the reaction: 

* 

ATP +- Glucose ADP + Glucose 6-phosphate. 

One equivalent of acid is formed during the reaction and 
reacts with the bicarbonate buffer to release one equiv¬ 
alent of CO 2 . The CO 2 evolved is thus a measure of the

hexokinase activity 

The drugs were dissolved in water and 2.0 ml. was 
added to each of the test manometer flasks. The side arms 
of the reaction vessels contained 0.4 ml. of 0.025 M 
ATP solution. The main body of each flask contained 0.1 
ml. of 0.3 M NaHC0 3 , 0.1 ml. of 0.36 M NaF, 0.1 ml. of 
0.029 M glucose, 0.1 ml. of MgClg, 0.2 ml. of rat brain 
homogenate and distilled water to make 3 ml. 

The bicarbonate solution was saturated with C0 2 before 
use, giving a buffer of pH 7.6. The flasks were gassed 
for 15 minutes with a 5% C0 2 - 95% N 2 gas mixture before 
starting the reaction by tipping in the ATP.

RESULTS 

The results are expressed as percent inhibition or 
percent activation. The terms refer to the percent change 
caused by the drug in the uptake or evolution of gas. 
Inhibition of Succinoxidase 

Phenothiazone was found to be quite a powerful 
inhibitor of the succinoxidase system. The results of 
four determinations with various dye concentrations are 
given in Table 1 and plotted in Figure 1. 

Phenothiazine and phenothiazine o-sulfoxide appeared 
to be somewhat more effective as inhibitors of the 
succinoxidase system than phenothiazone. The results of 
three runs with phenothiazine are shown in Table 2 and 
Figure 2 and the results of three runs with the sulfoxide 
are given in Table 3 and Figure 2. 

Thionol proved to be only slightly effective as an 
inhibitor of the succinoxidase system. In preliminary 
experiments the highest inhibition observed was 29% , 
even when the reaction medium was saturated with the dye.

Inhibition of Cytochrome Oxidase 

The phenothiazine derivatives were added in buffer 
solution and phenothiazine was added in alcoholic solution. 
Cytochrome oxidase activity was determined in the presence 
of ascorbic acid instead of p-phenylenediamine as the latter 
was found to cause a rapid drop in the rate of oxygen uptake, 
(Potter and DuBois (71) reported a 54% inhibition of succ- 
inoxidase activity by 3.3 * 10“° M p-phenylenediamine.) 

Ascorbic acid was found to be satisfactory as a red¬ 
ucing agent for the cytochrome-C and the rate of oxygen 
uptake remained constant for at least 30 minutes. Pheno- 
thiazone was completely reduced to the leuco form by the 
ascorbic acid so the effect of phenothiazone on cytochrome 
oxidase could not be determined. Thionol did not appear 
to be reduced but it is possible that some of the leuco 
form v/as present. 

Bone of the compounds tested were found to inhibit 
cytochrome oxidase and the results of typical experiments 
presented in Table 4 indicate that there may have been a 
slight activation. Ho reason was found for the slight 
inhibition produced by the low drug concentrations.

Inhibition of Brain Hexokinase 

Phenothiazone was found to be the most effective 
inhibitor of hexokinase and the results presented in 

Table 5 and Figure 3 show that the enzyme is completely 

-4 

inhibited in the presence of 6 * 10 M phenothiazone. 
Thionol and sulfoxide showed a much smaller inhibition 
of hexokinase, giving only about 50% inhibition with the 
equivilent concentration of drug. The data for thionol 
and sulfoxide are presented in Tables 6 and 7 respectively 
and are plotted in Figure 4. Phenothiazine was found to 
have no effect on hexokinase

An attempt has been made to determine the relative 
inhibitory power of phenothiazine and its biologically 
significant derivatives, towards succinoxidase, cytochrome 
oxidase and hexokinase. The results summarized in Table 8 
represent the concentrations of the drugs necessary to 
produce 50% inhibition. Cytochrome oxidase was activated 
by the drugs and so the results are not included in the table.

Phenothiazine was found to be the most powerful 

inhibitor of the succinoxidase system, giving a 50%

inhibition at a concentration of 1 x 10 M. The sulf¬ 
oxide was somewhat less effective since a 50% inhibition

_c. 

was observed at a concentration of 5 x 10 M. The slopes 
of the inhibition curves also indicated the superiority 
of phenothiazine as an inhibitor of the suecinoxidase system. 
Thus at a concentration of 7,5 * io“° M, sulfoxide inhib¬ 
ited approximately 10% while phenothiazine inhibited the 
enzyme about 35%. 

The 50% inhibition concentration for phenothiazone was 

-5 

about 5 x io m but a consideration of the inhibition curves 
indicated that sulfoxide may be a stronger inhibitor of the 

succinoxidase system than phenothiazone. At a concentration 

—4 

of 1 * 10 M, sulfoxide inhibited the enzyme about 85% 
while phenothiazone at the same concentration inhibited 
only about 65%. 

Thionol was found to have very little effect on the 
succinoxidase system. A saturated solution of the drug 
produced only about 30% inhibition. This is lower than the 
70% inhibition of beef heart enzyme reported by Collier and 

- _3 

Allen (8) for a thionol concentration of 3 x io M. 

The results of the phenothiazone studies confirm the 
findings of Collier and Allen ( 8 ), although the inhibition 
curve presented here is quite different from theirs. They 

reported a 50% inhibition of succinoxidase for a pheno- 

-4 

thiazone concentration of 1.2 x io M. This concentration 
is about three times as great as the 50% inhibition conc¬ 
entration reported here for phenothiazone. Further, Collier

and Allen reported an 11% activation for a concentration 

_5 

of 4 x 10 M. From Figure 1 it is seen that in this study 
phenothiazone inhibited succinoxidase about 45% at that 
concentration. 

No reason can be presented for these differences but 
they may be due to differences in the enzyme preparations. 
(Collier and Allen used a beef heart preparation.) 

Cytochrome oxidase was slightly activated by high 
concentrations of the drugs and slightly inhibited by low 
concentrations. Since phenothiazone and thionol form 
reversible oxidation-reduction systems, it is possible that 
the observed increase* in oxygen consumption was due to the 
oxidation of the dyes. This possibility v*as ruled out 
however, because the oxygen consumed in oxidizing the dyes 
would be compensated by the compensator flasks of the 
manometers, vdiich also contained dye and ascorbic acid. 

It will be noted as well that phenothiazine and sulfoxide 
which do not form oxidation-reduction systems, also acti¬ 
vated cytochrome oxidase. 

The results for leucophenothiazone and thionol differ 
from the findings of Collier and Allen (8). They reported 

a 43% inhibition of beef heart cytochrome oxidase by 

-4 

1.46 <10 M leucophenothiazone and a 22% inhibition by 
3 < 10M thionol.

Preliminary experiments showed that p-phenylenediamihe 
which they used to reduce cytochrome-C, was not suitable as 
a substrate for the oxidase as the rate of oxygen uptake 
fell off rapidly when it was used. Schneider and Potter (68) 
have also reported that this reducing agent causes a decline 
in oxygen uptake. It thus appears that ohe replacement of 
p-phenylenediamine by ascorbic acid may account for the 
differences noted above. 

If the observations that phenothiazine derivatives do 
inhibit cytochrome oxidase are correct, then these drugs 
must inhibit succinic dehydrogenase, or an intermediate • 
between the dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxida.se. The 
effect of these drugs on succinic dehydrogenase was not 
studied because in preliminary experiments, methylene blue"* 
was found to be a strong inhibitor of the succinoxidase 
system. A 78% inhibition in the presence of 4 x 10"^ y[ 
methylene blue was observed. Potter and DuBois (71) have 
reported a 22% inhibition of succinic dehydrogenase by 
3.3 x 10 ^ M methylene blue. 

Hexokinase was found to be strongly inhibited by 

phenothiazone which gave a 50% inhibition at a concentration 

-5 

of 5 X 10 M. Inhibition was observed over a wide range 

of drug concentrations; from 10% at 5 x 10 M,to 100% 

-4 

at 6 x io M. These results are of the same order of 
magnitude as reported by Wills and Wormall (72) for the 

Methylene "blue is used as the H acceptor in studying succinic 
dehydrogenase activity.

inhioition of yeast hexokinase by suramin. They reported 
an 80% inhibition of the enzyme by 1 x 10 ^ M suramin. 

Sulfoxide and thionol were found to be much less 
effective as inhibitors of hexokinase, giving 50% inhib¬ 
ition of the enzyme at concentrations of 3 * 1CT 4 M and 
-3 

1 x 10 M respectively. Phenothiazine had no effect on 
hexokinase. 

It is evident that the enzyme inhibitions reported 
here cannot be correlated to anthelmintic activity partic¬ 
ularly since phenothiazone and thionol have been shown to 
have no anthelmintic action (18). The inhibition of 
succinoxidase by phenothiazine may be significant, since 
unchanged phenothiazine is probably the active anthelmintic. 

In this regard it should be noted that Laser(73) has dem¬ 
onstrated high succinic dehydrogenase activity in muscle 
pulp extracts of Ascaris lumbricoides. 

It is also apparent that a systematic study must be 
made of the enzyme systems and metabolic processes of the 
parasites concerned before the mode of action of phenothiazine 
can be elucidated. It is a well established principle of 
chemotherapy that the chemotherapeutic agent, to be effective 
must attack some enzyme or reaction which is more essential 
to the parasite than to the host. Since phenothiazine is 
relatively non-toxic to mammals, it is evident that a 
difference does exist in the metabolic processes of parasite 


and host.

A step in the right direction has been made by 
Bueding and Charms (74) who reported the absence of the 
cytochrome system in Ascaris lumbricoides and two other 
helminths. They concluded that respiration in these 
parasites is mediated by respiratory catalysts which are 
not identical with the cytochrome system. Considering the 
anaerobic environment in which these worms exist, the need 
for a respiratory system involving atmospheric oxygen may 
be unnecessary. In view of this observation a closer study 
of the anaerobic phase of respiration seems to be warranted.

3UMMAPY 

The effect of phenothiazine and some phenothiazine 
derivatives on succinoxidase, cytochrome oxidase, and 
hexokinase has been studied. 

Succinoxidase was found to be strongly inhibited by 
phenothiazine and to a lesser extent by phenothiazone and 
phenothiazine o-sulfoxide. Cytochrome oxidase was activated 
slightly by all the compounds tested. Hexokinase was found 
to be quite strongly inhibited by phenothiazone but only 
weakly inhibited by thionol and sulfoxide. Phenothiazine 
had no effect on hexokinase. 

The results have been discussed in relation to the 


mode of action of phenothiazine as ah anthelmintic
