SYNOPSIS 


In order to develop the rich iron ore deposits existing 
below Steep Rock Lake In Northwestern Ontario the lake was 
drained and a large volume of the lake bottom sediments were 
removed. The sediments * which existed over the lake bot¬ 
tom to depths of up to 400 feet, were primarily, highly 
sensitive, varved clays and silts of glacio-lacustrine origin. 
The removal of the sediments was accomplished by dredging and 
pumping into adjacent settling basins. During the lowering 
of the lake level and dredging operations between 1955 and 
1957 ^ six major flow slides occurred in these lake bottom 
sediments. 

A study of the factors involved in these slides showed 
that the flows were due to the highly sensitive nature of 
the material which, when disturbed, turned into a thick 
slurrey and flowed for considerable distance on very gentle 
slopes. The immediate cause or triggering 13 of the flows 
could be attributed to the rate of drawdown of the water 
level. For drawdown to be the "triggering mechanism" of the 
slides, the slopes would be in much less stable state than 
indicated by analysis based on conventional soil strength 
tests. This difference can be attributed to a number of 
factors: (l) The difference in a strength and stress- 

strain characteristics between light and dark layers;

(2) a smaller effective shearing resistance as compared to 
strength due to the high sensitivity and low failure strains 
of the material; (3) intrusive pore pressures; (4) reduction 
in strength due to strains; (5) considerably lower shearing 
strength in the original surface and redeposited material 
not considered in the strength values. 

The drawdown of the lake level caused increased shear¬ 
ing stresses in the slopes. Either a high rate of drawdown 
over a short period or a low rate of drawdown for a long 
period of time can result in a low degree of consolidation. 
The slides have occurred at rates and durations of draw¬ 
down which would seem to result in the same average degree 
of consolidation of the sediments.

CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 

Six major flow slides occurred in the varved clays of 
Steep Rock Lake in northwestern Ontario during the dredging 
of the lake-bottom from 1955 to 1958. Analysis of the slopes 
involved on the basis of laboratory soil tests has failed to 
explain or predict these slides. Many similar slides have 
occurred in other parts of Eastern Canada, the State of Maine 
and in the Scandinavian countries (6, 14, 18, 20).* Although 
the general causes and characteristics of these slides have 
been described, the immediate causes and mechanisms involved 
have only been guessed at. Most authorities classify flow 
slides as not susceptible to analysis ( 25 * 29 ). 

A detailed analysis of all available data from the 
slides of Steep Rock Lake is made in an endeavour to determine 
the characteristics and causes of these slides. The six slides 
are studied under various topics rather than as individual 
slides in order to show similarities or differences between 
them. 

Geology of the Area 

Steep Rock Lake is situated in the Precambrian Shield 
of Canada. Over the lower areas of the glaciated Precambrian 
bed-rock are superficial deposits of glacial till, stratified 
fluvio-glacial sands and gravels and glacio-lacustrine silt

and clay deposits laid down in lakes formed during the retreat 
of the ice sheets. The thickest deposits of the area are of 
glacio-lacustrine origin and consist of well-laminated varved 
silts and clays. 

Glacial History 

The glacial history of the area is described in detail 
by Antevs ( 3 ). He suggests that Steep Rock Lake was ex¬ 
cavated by the Pleistocene ice sheets of which there were 
two major advances. The first came from the direction 
N 12° - 15° Ej the latter from the direction N 40° E. The 
advances from the latter direction were repetitious in nat¬ 
ure although only the initial two advances covered the Steep 
Rock Lake and that to the northeast was a large glacial lake 
called Lake Johnston by Antevs. This lake stood at an 
elevation of 1363 feet. 

With subsequent advances and retreats of the ice lobe., 
suspended sediments were transported into the lake and were 
deposited as varved sediments. Antevs classified and 
described eight distinct series of varves in the deposits 
of Steep Rock Lake. 

Recent History 

Steep Rock Lake is located about 140 miles west of Fort 
William, Ontario near the eastern end of the Rainy River 






- 




. 

. v . ) 

















District. (Fig. l) It was part of the natural drainage path 
of the Seine River which flowed through a string of small 
lakes to the northeast, over falls 45 feet high into Falls 
Bay of Steep Rock Lake at an Elevation of 1263 feet, out 
the west Arm of the lake and thence to Rainy Lake to the 
west. 

About 30 years ago dams, built for hydro-power, raised 
the lakes to the northeast forming a large lake called 
Marmion Lake at an elevation of 1363 feet. (Fig. 2) 

Between 1942 and 1944, in order to develop iron-ore 
bodies located beneath the lake, the Seine River was di¬ 
verted through Finlayson Lake to the north. Finlayson Lake 
was lowered from 1398 to 1340 feet through a gravel cut to 
the south. Rock-cut canals were blasted between Marmion 
and Finlayson Lakes to complete the diversion. The narrows 
between the Middle and West Arms of the Lake were dammed to 
permit de-watering of the other arms of the lake. The water 
in the lake was lowered by pumping about 140 feet to eleva¬ 
tion 1120. 

This lowering of the lake level exposed the lake bottom 
deposits in the Middle Arm and completely drained the shal¬ 
low Southeast Arm, however, the lake bottom in Falls Bay 
existed at elevation 1000 feet and therefore retained about 
120 feet of water. A natural barrier existed to elevation 
1130 feet at the south end of the East Arm which retained

this water. The Middle Arm was dredged to an elevation of 
about 1000 feet. The material pumped from the Middle Arm 
was deposited in the West Arm which acted as a settling 
basin for the silt and clay. 

In 195^ a second project was undertaken to develop the 
ore bodies existing under Falls Bay. Dams were built across 
the north end of Marmion Lake which was then used as a 
settling basin for the dredged material from the Falls Bay- 
area. To divert the drainage from the area to the East, 
two large and several smaller earth-fill dams were built, 
the larger ones at each end of the Southeast Arm. 

During the de-watering and dredging of the Middle Arm 
of the Lake numerous slides occurred exposing the varved 
clay deposits of the lake bottom. Studies of these deposits 
were made by Antevs from the geological standpoint and by 
the National Research Council of Canada, (N.R.C.), from the 
engineering standpoint. Stability studies were made by 
Steep Rock Iron Mines Ltd. but were not available to the 
writer. 

The de-watering and dredging of the Falls Bay area was 
done by Caland Ore Co. Ltd. with Dean R. M. Hardy acting as 
Consulting Engineer on this project. During this operation 
six major flow slides occurred in the East Arm, three in 
1955; one in 1956, and two in 1957; involving a total of 
about seven and a half million yards of silt and clay.

Basis of this Study 

This study was based on information and data pertinent 
to the Caland Ore Company project which was available in the 
files of Dean R. M. Hardy. This included test-hole logs* 
laboratory and field soil tests* maps* photographs and other 
pertinent data in the form of reports and letters. In an 
endeavour to determine the general and immediate causes of 
these slides* the information was studied under the follow¬ 
ing topics:

In many cases the available data were incomplete. In 
some cases the missing information was omitted and in other 
cases was estimated to permit continuity of various sections

CHAPTER II 


DESCRIPTION OE MATERIAL 


Genera 1 Description 

As described by Legget and Bartley (17)* the material 
was, "well-laminated varved clay of glacio-lacustrine 
origin”. Antevs (3) distinguished four major types of 
laminations, namely: Simple varves, drainage varves, com¬ 
posite varves and unvarved laminations. The latter two 
types were abnormal and rare. Of the 100 feet of deposit 
studied by Antevs, about 60 feet consisted of simple varves 
and about 40 feet were abnormal and highly variable. 

Lowering of the lake exposed these deposits which were 
generally overlain by a layer of black organic matter and 
in some areas by sand deposits. From fresh exposures, i.e. 
slides and drill holes, this material was described as a 
light grey silty-clay of medium plasticity. However, on 
partial drying the material takes on the laminated appear¬ 
ance of typical varved soils, having alternate light and dark 
layers. Each couplet, consisting of a light and dark layer, 
represents the deposition of one year on the basis of the 
seasonal deposition theory of varve formation. (This 
theory has been questioned by many writers; see for example s 
Legget and Bartley, Reference 17 ).

Grain Size 

It has been found that there is only little difference 
in grain-size distribution between light and dark bands. 
Eden ( 13 ) also showed that there was little gradation of 
particle size within a varve. As the grain-size curves, 
Figure 3 * straddle the silt-clay boundary this material Is 
often referred to as silt-clay. 

Plasticity 

The plasticity characteristics of the light and dark 
bands are widely different as shown by the Casagrande 
plasticity chart * Figure 4, and Skempton 1 s activity chart. 
Figure 5 .* 

As shown in Figure 4, the light layers can be clas¬ 
sified as inorganic silty clay of low plasticity while the 
dark layers are inorganic clay of high plasticity. From 
Figure 5 the light layers have an activity of 0.25 (very 
low) while the dark layers have an activity of about.0.60 
(inactive). (22) 

Tests conducted in 1955 (2, 13 ) showed that the mois¬ 
ture content varied greatly within individual verves as 
shown in Figure 6. It was suggested by Eden that the 
liquid limit varied within the varves in the same manner so 
that the liquidity index was always equal to one. Whether 
this is so or not remains to be proven but tests of average 
moisture content and average limits have shown that the

liquidity index is equal to or greater than one in most 
cases. Average liquid limit tests run on layers of known 
variation in moisture content (2) gave results as shown by 
the dashed lines of Figure 6.* 

Structure 

Since there was no gradation of grain-size in a varve 
it was concluded by Eden (13), that the varves were of 
symminct rather than diatactic structure. (In symminct 
structure the grains are mixed through flocculation by 
electrolytic action; whereas in diatactic structure the 
grains are sorted from top to bottom according to size and 
specific gravity). The formation of symminct structure 
through flocculation is described well by Casagrande (10). 

The resulting structure has a high volume of voids or void 
ratio and depends for its strength on relatively few grain- 
to-grain contact If this structure is disturbed the load 
is carried by the unconsolidated material and water phase 
between grains which has a shearing strength which may be 
less than that at the liquid limit. This loss of strength 
when disturbed results in a clay which has a remoulded 
strength much lower than the undisturbed strength and 
hence a sensitive or quick clay depending on the degree of 
strength lost. From the results of unconfined compressive 
strength tests, Eden classifies these clays as extra-

sensitive, i.e. sensitivity from 8 to l6f It has also been 
shown that the liquidity index is very nearly one in all 
cases. 

Terzaghi (27, 28) notes that glacial lake clays com¬ 
monly contain a high percentage of rock flour with eaui- 
dimensional particles and both the high sensitivity and 
high liquidity index of these clays appears to be due to a 
metastable arrangement of the equi-dimensional particles. 

The strength of the undisturbed clay is chiefly due to the 
strength of the framework formed by these particles at 
their points of contact. 

It is of interest to note that the light and dark 
varves are composed of a high percentage of quartz, carbon¬ 
ates, feldspars and a small amount of clay (probably 
montmoriilonite) (reported by Eden on the basis of dif¬ 
ferential thermal analysis and x-ray diffraction). Although 
montmoriilonite is classed as an active mineral, the portion 
of rock flour minerals is so high that even the dark layers 
which have the higher clay content, plot as inactive. (Fig¬ 
ure 5.) It may be said that the clays of Steep Rock Lake 
have a metastable structure and are able to liquify and 
flow on disturbance much like very fine sand. 

Which of the above views applies more correctly to 
the clay of Steep Rock Lake is of academic interest only 
as the result of disturbance is exactly the same. When 

*SensItivity = undisturbed_strength as determined by 
remoulded strength 
unconfined compression tests.

disturbed, the material liquefies and flows like a thick 
slurrey. In this liquefied condition the material may 
flow for long distances on a. near zero slope. These then 
are the characteristics of very sensitive clays which may 
result in typical flow slides. The term flow slide as 
applied to clay soils may refer to any slide occurring in 
extra-sensitive or quick clay as the disturbed material 
will liquefy and flow away if the topography permits. 
However, the term is normally used to describe slides in 
which the depth of material involved is small compared to 
the area affected and this is the way the term is used here. 

Thixotropy 

Another interesting property of this material is that 
of thixotropy. Ackermann, (l), defines thixotropy as an 
isothermal, reversible viscosity change of concentrated 
suspensions of very fine particles. It is a property of 
some soils by which a regain of structure occurs in a 
period of rest after mechanical agitation. A test and 
limit called the ”stiffening limit 11 were proposed by 
Ackermann to relate the degree of thixotropy present in 
a soil. Tests by Eden (13) showed the stiffening limit of 
the Steep Rock clays to be about 50 % for light layers and 
about 200 fo for the dark layers. This indicates that a 
small amount of soil would begin to stiffen after one 




16 


minute rest at a maximum water content as given by the 
stiffening limit. 

Slide Materia 1 

In the Falls Bay area 400 feet of this highly sensi¬ 
tive silt-clay existed above the ore body presenting a 
major problem in the design of the dredge-slopes. The 
flow slides occurred in the East Arm where the depth of 
sediment was variable but averaged about 200 feet deep. 
There was also about 30 feet of silt deposited over most 
of this area during the dredging of the Middle Arm. (See 
Figure §3). This redeposited material with the upper por¬ 
tion of the natural lake bottom formed a 50 foot layer of 
loose., softer material over most of the East Arm. 

As the water was lowered a stiff crust was formed 
over the surface of the sediments by dessication. Higher 
strength was developed towards the surface through con¬ 
solidation under the greater stress conditions. The depth 
of crust and the gain in strength would depend on the time 
of exposure. The actual values were not determined but 
can be partially deduced from the slide profiles. 

The material involved in the first slide was varved 
except for the top three or four feet which was organic or 
redeposited. As this area had been above water for about 
three years there was a crust of considerable thickness at 







17 


the time of the slide. The top ten feet of material were 
consolidated to a degree so that it did not liquefy and 
flow out hut remained on the slope in a disturbed state. 

The second slide probably occurred in varved material 
except for a small layer of organic at the surface. This 
area, was also above water for about three years but little 
material remained above the sliding surface probably due 
to the steeper slope. 

An examination of the profile * Figure 20, indicated 
that the third slide occurred only in redeposited material. 
The top end of the slide area had been exposed only four 
months previously and a fairly steady rate of exposure 
existed up to the time of the failure. Hence only a small 
amount of dessication had taken place and consolidation 
would not have been complete throughout the length of the 
slope. 

The fourth slide also occurred only in redeposited 
material. The southern end had been exposed for part of 
the summer of 1955 hut generally the area had not been 
dessicated. 

The fifth slide affected up to about 25 feet of the 
varved clay while the surface was redeposited material to 
a depth of about 5 feet. The top 10 feet of the slide 
area had been exposed for about five months. About 12 
feet of the surface material were left above the slip 
surface as in the case of the first slide. 








. 








































18 


The slip surface of the sixth slide occurred in 
varved material over most of its length although the mat¬ 
erial involved in the slide was partially redeposited. 

The southern or upper end of the slide was possibly com¬ 
posed of up to a half of redeposited*material. This area 
had been exposed for about two years while the northern 
portion had been exposed for about one year previous to 
the slide. 

The reason for the varying thickness of redeposited 
material was due to the various locations of the slides 
(See Figure 7) and due to the fact that a large portion of 
this material flowed from the Arm into Falls Bay during 
the dredging operations. The flow of this material was 
probably quite slow and did not constitute a true flow 
slide. In particular the fourth slide was of this nature 
and in itself removed about 20 feet of the redeposited 


material.

CHAPTER III 


GEOMETRY OF THE SLIDES 


First Slide 

The six flow slides of this study occurred in the silt- 
clay of the East Arm which forms part of the natural barrier 
between Falls Bay and the Middle Arm. See Figures 7 and 22. 

As shown in Figure 7* the first slide occurred at the 
south end of the A,rm and flowed out from the North-east and 
South-east leaving two semi-circular escarpments on the 
flats to the south-east of the Arm. The slide involved an 
area of about 200.,000 square yards which subsided an average 
of about 15 feet as over one million cubic yards of material 
flowed out. Probings subsequently showed that the slip sur¬ 
face was about 25 feet below the original ground surface. 

The original surface had a slope of about 28:1 and the dis¬ 
turbed material which was the original top 10 feet before 
the slide remained on the same slope. The longest paths 
from escarpment to water were about 1600 feet each. 

Three small creeks drained into the Arm from the East 
and South-east in the area of the escarpments. Sand layers 
were exposed in the escarpment, along the creeks and by 
borings. The layers may have caused high pore pressures 
over part of the slide area.

Second Slide 

The second slide involved an area, of less than 44,000 
square yards to the east side of the arm and adjacent to the 
most northerly edge of the first slide. The movement was 
to the north and involved an estimated 220,000 cubic yards 
of material. The original ground surface had a maximum 
slope of about 14:1. The longest path to water surface was 
about 90° feet on an average slope of about 19:1. The ground 
surface after the slide was almost parallel to the original 
surface. The depth of the slide and final slopes were 
probably controlled by the underlying rock ledge. Porti'ons 
of the sliding surface which were left exposed are shown in 
Figure 23. 

Third Slide 

The third slide occurred over 2,500 feet along the 
middle portion of the arm and included the total width of 
the arm. The total area involved was over 200,000 square 
yards which existed, before and after the slide, on a slope 
of about 50:1. The depth of subsidence of the area and the 
depth to failure surface were not known by the writer but 
from the existing profiles of the arm it was estimated that 
the slide could not have been much over 10 feet deep and on 
this basis the volume of material would have been about 
600,000 cubic yards.

Fourth Slide 

The fourth slide occurred over an area of about 340,000 
square yards along the middle portion of the arm between 
latitudes 23^600 N and 26,900 N. The slide took place as a 
slow flow of material over a period of about 55 days during 
which about 2,400,000 cubic yards of silt left the arm. The 
area which was originally on a slope of 1.2$, subsided about 
20 feet and was left on a slope of about 1.5$. At the time 

of the flow a dredge cut was being made at the lower end of 

the area which could have given a vertical face from 20 to 
30 feet high. 

Fifth Slide 

The fifth slide occurred over an area of 27.,000 square 

yards located on the easterly one third width of the arm 

between latitudes 26,000 N and 27.,000 N. Gross-sections 
were taken on this slide and indicated an average subsidence 
of 13 feet. The volume of material was calculated on this 
basis to be 117^000 cubic yards. A calculation based on the 
water rise in Falls Bay due to the slide gave exactly the 
same figure for slide yardage. From probings, the sliding 
surface was found to be an average of about 25 feet below 
the original ground surface. The 12 feet of material left 
after this slide, as in the case of the first slide, was 
the original surface material. The surface before the slide 
had a slope of about 70:1 and after of about 33:1-

From the order of dredge cuts it would appear that 
vertical faces existed up to 50 feet high. It is improbable 
that this was so and hence minor local slumps must have 
occurred during the dredging operation. These slumps,would 
probably be in the form of circular arc slides. At the time 
of the fifth slide a vertical face up to 40 feet high was 
being cut. A circular arc slide in this face could have 
been the direct and immediate cause of the flow slide. The 
flow affected the area immediately back of the dredge cut 
and did not fan out into a typical flow slide. 

Sixth Slide 

The largest of the flow slides was the sixth one to 
occur. In it* about three and a quarter million yards of 
material flowed out of the East Arm and into Falls Bay. A 
relatively steep escarpment formed at latitude 22,800 N and 
the material flowed about 4,400 feet to the water at latitude 
27,000 N. The area affected was about 440,000 square yards 
above water. The subsidence was of the order of 22 feet 
based on the area and volume. The volume was based on the 
rise in water due to the slide. The average slope of the 
area before the slide was 2 , Due to dredge cuts, the 
slope at the toe was about 6 % for a rise of 60 feet. 

From photographs the final surface 'was very smooth with 
the appearance of clay with a moisture content at or above 
the liquid limit. Hence, the surface after the slide was 












































































26 

disturbed with none of the original surface material 
remaining. 

As it was impossible for men to walk on the slide area 

for some time after the slide occurred due to its soft 

state, considerable time was spent trying to determine the 

depth of subsidence and final slope from photographs. The 

pictures, which were 35 tn.m. slides, were projected onto a 

$ 

tracing-paper screen so that lines could be drawn on the 
back of the screen. Then elevations could be determined if 
two water-lines of known elevation existed immediately above 
the points of desired elevation. It was shown, however, that 
only one water-line of known elevation existed and even it 
had a possible variation in elevation of about 6 feet which 
would make the determined values of little significance. 

A second method of using the photographs is outlined 
by Breed and Hosmer (8) but this method is dependent on 
using a fixed focus camera of known focal length and having 
the camera at a known location and elevation. The camera 
must also be held horizontally and in a known direction. 

As none of these conditions were fulfilled it was not 
possible to use this method. 

The East Arm was the only area adjacent to Palls Bay 
in which large flow slides could occur up to 1957. Minor 
slides of unknown size and dates did occur as dredging and 
drawdown proceeded during the three years. During the

latter part of 1957 about 40 feet of silt was exposed on 
the south shore of Falls Bay. This area had not developed 
any slides at the time of writing. However, it should be 
noted that the top 40 to 50 feet of original material had 
been removed prior to the exposure of this area. The ex¬ 
posed material would be of more stable nature than that 
involved in the East Arm flow slides.

CHAPTER IV 


TIMING 

Time of Day 

As with many slides which are the result of pore-water 
pressures,* most of these slides occurred at night when loss 
of water by evaporation is lowest. Condensation and a les¬ 
sening of capillary tensions result In a reduction in magnitude 
of negative pore pressures near the surface. This would tend 
to Indicate that these slides were also the result of pore- 
water pressures. 

Vie a ther Conditions 

A study of the weather conditions previous to each 
slide revealed that conditions were generally normal. In 
three cases (slides 1, 3* 5) the precipitation of the week 
preceeding each slide was from one to three inches. Temp¬ 
erature variation from normal was slight in all cases. 

The first slide occurred following the spring break-up 
period at which time the ground would have been saturated 
and the small creeks would probably have had their maximum 
flow. 

The second slide occurred after a fairly warm, fairly 
dry period. The third slide however was preceeded by warm

soil mass, "excess” pore pressures - neutral pressures in 
excess of hydrostatic.

weather following a. fall of over 18 inches of snow. This 
would indicate that the ground could have been saturated at 
this time. 

The fourth slide occurred over a. 55 day period in the 
spring during which break-up could have been occurring. 
Weather conditions for this slide were not known. 

The fifth slide may have occurred during or shortly 
after the spring break-up. It did occur after a week-long 
warming trend during which there was no frost. The sixth 
slide occurred after a period of warm dry weather. 


Drawdown 

The rate of water drawdown was probably the most impor¬ 
tant consideration under this heading as drawdown tends to 
increase the shearing stresses in a. clay slope without 
initially changing the shearing resistance of the material. 

If the rate of drawdown is low relative to the permeability 
of the material consolidation will take place to a sufficient 
degree to increase the shearing resistance of the material 
and to resist the added shearing stress. 

A second consideration was that the total drawdown from 
elevation 1120,, which was the stable water level for two 

years^ governed the possible seepage pressures in the mat¬ 
erial and the height of saturated material exposed. Falls 
Bay water elevations for 1955 to 1957 were plotted as 





31 

Figures 8 and 9 . 

1) At the time of the first slide the water was at 
elevation 1102 and was being drawn down at the rate of 0.7 
feet per day. For the month preceeding the slide the aver¬ 
age rate was 0.6 feet per day. The total drawdown from the 
beginning of pumping the previous year was 18 feet. 

2) Exact water data was not known at the time of the 
second slide but the lake was about elevation 1085 feet and 
the rate of drawdown was about 0.6 feet per day. The total 
drawdown at that time was 30 feet. 

3) As for the second slide* exact water data were not 
available at the time of the third slide. Approximately* 
the water elevation was 1020 feet and the rate of drawdown 
was O .13 feet per day. The total drawdoxvn was 100 feet. 

A) The fourth slide was a. slow flow of material over 
a period of 55 days. It was preceeded by a considerable 
period of no significant amount of drawdown. However* the 
flow started shortly after a drawdown of 3 feet in one day 
and continued while the water was being lowered steadily 
about 10 feet. At the start of the slide the water was at 
elevation 1008.5 feet and when the flow stopped the water 
was at 1000 feet. The total drawdown for the previous year 
was about 95 feet. 

5 ) The fifth slide occurred with the water at eleva¬ 
tion 966.5 feet. The rate of drawdown the day of the slide

EI-fUaT-|4n 






















































































34 

was 0.2 feet per day but for the week and month preceeding 
the slide the rate was essentially zero with only small 
fluctuations around 967 feet. The total drawdown for the 
previous year was 3 ^ feet and the total from the beginning 
was 153 feet. 

6) The sixth slide occurred during a fairly rapid 
drawdown as the lake was being lowered between two dredging 
elevations. The water elevation at the beginning of the 
slide was 958.3 feet and was being lowered at the rate of 
0.5 feet per day. The drop in the previous week, however, 
was 6.7 feet or a rate of .95 feet per day and in the 
previous two weeks was at the rate of 0.65 feet per day. 

In the preceeding year the drop was only 37 feet and the 
total drop was 162 feet. 

Figure 10 shows a plot of duration of significant draw- 
downs against the rate for that period as given in Table IV. 
The rates and durations of drawdown before each slide are 
joined by a line giving a curve of critical drawdown. The 
resulting curve would seem to be a logical criterion for 
critical drawdown. At some low rate of drawdown consolida¬ 
tion would take place at a rate sufficient to increase the 
strength to equal the added stress. On the other hand, a 
high rate of drawdown acting for a very short period would 
not critically increase the stress in the sediment. As the 
relationship of the curve appeared to be an exponential

function^ the curve was plotted on logarithmic paper. The 
critical values plotted as a straight line with a slope of 
-2.2 as shown in Figure 11. The resulting relationship 
is DR 2 * 2 = where D is the duration of drawdown in days 
at the rate R in feet per day. This relationship was then 
plotted as the dashed curve of Figure 10. 

The first slide does not follow this relationship but 
this may be accounted for as the water elevations were not 
known accurately for this period and high pore pressures may 
have existed due to the three creeks which flowed through 
the area at that time. Only twice were there rates of draw¬ 
down which lasted for more than the critical period as given 
by this curve. This was during the summer of 1955 and the 
only large slide was the second one which occurred near the 
beginning of this drawdown period. Also about December 1, 
1956 the water was lowered at about the critical rate as 
given by Figure 10. The top layer of silt-clay may have 
been frozen at this time which fact could explain the absence 
of slides at a time of very rapid drawdown. 

The fact that there was not a slide during these periods 
shows that drawdown alone cannot account for the triggering 
of these flow slides. This suggests that pore pressures 
must have been critical at the time of the slides but of 
lesser magnitude during the summer of 1955 . It may be of 
significance to note that the five slides which can be at

least partially attributed to drawdown, occurred either in 
the spring or the fall during which periods precipitation 
would be greater and reduction of pressures due to evapora¬ 
tion would be less than during the summer months. On the 
other hand, the slide of May 1957 occurred during a warming 
trend and although a flow slide was precipitated it did not 
spread throughout the area, of the arm as it might have if 
the intrusive pore pressures had been of greater magnitude. 

Pertinent to the consideration of drawdown was a small 
slide which occurred in the varved clay of the Southeast 
Arm as the water was lowered rapidly in a reservoir. The 
clay in this area had been exposed for several years prior 
to filling the reservoir but at the location of the slide 
it had been disturbed about one week previously by blasting. 
Drawdown at the time of the slide was at the rate of about 
one foot per day and had been at this rate for about seven 
days. The rate and duration were not known accurately but 
the above figures show that this drawdown would plot very 
close to the critical curve of Figure 10.

CHAPTER V 


SHEARING STRESSES 

Infinite Slope 

As these slides all occurred on fairly flat slopes of 
large extent the stresses existing at any depth may be com¬ 
puted on the basis of the Infinite Slope as given by Taylor 
( 25 ) . For a slope with seepage occurring throughout 
p = z cos 2 i 

't z z cos i sin i 

where p and *1 are the components of effective stress on 
planes parallel to the slope surface. Figure 12 shows values 
of shearing stress plotted against depth for various slope 
angles. From this plot it can be seen that within the 
depth of the slides the shearing stresses are fairly small. 

This plot gives the maximum possible shearing stresses 
within the slope as they are computed for a slope which is 
saturated with seepage occurring throughout. The stresses 
in the soil for a state of complete submergence would be 
about 40 fo of these values. 

For the first slide the slope was about 3.5^ and the 
depth to the failure surface was about 25 feet; from the 
graph the shearing stress was 95 lbs per square foot. The 
second slide occurred on a maximum slope of about 7 % at a 
depth of 15 feet. The shearing stress in this case was

43 


110 lbs per square foot. The third slide occurred on a 
slope of about 2 °/o at a possible depth of less than about 20 
feet; the stress for this case was about 40 lbs per square 
foot. The fourth slide had an initial slope of about 1.2$ 
over most of its area and it involved about 20 feet of silt. 
The stress at this depth was about 25 lbs per square foot. 
However, due to a dredge cut at the toe of the slope, a 
vertiqal face of 20 to 30 feet could have existed. From 
the relation H ^ z ii-2., the stress at the toe could have been 

or 4 

about 200 lbs per square foot. The fifth slide had an 
initial slope of about l\% and occurred at an average depth 
of 25 feet; the stress was 40 lbs per square foot over the 
area of the slide. However, due to the dredge cut which 
was underway at the time of the slide a vertical face of up 
to 40 feet high existed at the toe of the slope. The stress 
at the vertical face was in the order of 350 lbs per square 
foot. 

The slope of the sixth slide was initially an average 
of about 2 \io although the depth to the sliding surface was 
not known. Assuming it was about 10 feet below the final 
surface, on the basis of the other slides of known depth, 
the stress was about 100 lbs per square foot. At the toe, 
however, the slope was about 6$ for a rise of 60 feet. The 
stress at a depth of 30 feet would be in the order of 200 
lbs per square foot.

44 


From the foregoing it can be seen that for three slides 
the stress over the slide area was in the order of 100 lbs 
per square foot. Where a steeper slope existed at the toe, 
the stresses were considerably higher. However, as shown in 
the following section, they are considerably lower than the 
existing shearing strengths. 

■Stability Chart 

The stability of the slopes can also be considered from 
the standpoint of stability numbers and stability charts as 
given by Taylor ( 25 ). As Taylor is not clear in the range 
of small slope angles, a stability chart. Figure 13* was 
drawn using the relationship: (Taylor, Equation 16-13) 


(tan i - fa 
v ft 




where c^ is the required cohesion at depth H below a slope 
of angle i for a developed friction angle 0^. 

As discussed later, pore pressures may cause the effec¬ 
tive pressure to become zero in which case 0$ = 0 and for a 
3$ slope the stability number from Figure 13 is 0.03. There¬ 
fore, c^ = 0.03 x 110 x 30 = 991bs per square foot. This 
is equal to the shearing stress found from Figure 12 for 
30 foot depth below a 3% slope.

CHAPTER VI 


SHEARING STRENGTHS 

Tests 

About fourty test holes were drilled in the Falls Bay 
area in 1953 and 195^. Undisturbed samples using 3 !i dia¬ 
meter Shelby tubes were taken from twenty of these holes 
and some 100 unconfined compressive strength tests were run 
on these samples. It was found from these tests that the 
percent strain at failure increased with increasing depth. 
Norwegian workers found the same thing and their studies 
showed that samples were difficult to obtain without exces¬ 
sive disturbance below depths of 10 meters (5). They also 
found that sampling difficulties occurred only in clays of 
high sensitivity and low activity. Steep Rock clays are of 
this type ana therefore it would be expected that samples 
from any appreciable depth would be unduly disturbed except 
those taken by the most advanced sampling techniques. The 
Norwegian workers also found that the "Vane apparatus"* 
gave reliable shearing strengths as compared to laboratory 
results on undisturbed samples. Vane tests were run in the 
Falls Bay area. The results of these tests compared 


*The development and details of this apparatus can be 
found in Reference 9* 








48 


favourably with the unconfined tests at shallower depths 
and hence were assumed to be reliable at greater depths. 

The results of the unconfined and vane tests., plotted in 
Figure 14, show a definite increase of strength with depth. 

Vane shear test profiles indicate that the original surface 
material and a portion of the redeposited material, where 
it existed, were not accounted for in this plot. 

Theory 

Relative to the infinite-slope analysis which was carried 
out in Chapter V, the approximate shearing strength of the 
soil in situ may be expressed by the modified Coulomb equation: 

s = c +* z tan 0 (6-1) 

wherein s Z shearing strength of the soil 
c “ apparent cohesion 

z bouyant unit weight of soil 
z z depth of soil to considered point 
J2> I angle of internal friction 
To consider the shearing strength of the soil from the 
standpoint of Mohr’s Rupture Theory the shearing strength 
data were plotted as s against ^ rom the best fit 

straight line of Figure 14. The resulting line could then 
be considered as representing the above relationship of 
equation 1. This line should be the Mohr Rupture Line 
resulting from consolidated-undrained triaxial tests. The 
soil is considered to be normally consolidated under its

existing overburden. Unconfined compression tests and vane 
shear tests fail the soil under conditions of no drainage 
and therefore the resulting strength line represents the 
rupture line obtained from consolidated undrained tests. 

From Figure 14 it is obvious that several best-fit 
straight lines could be drawn equally well. Two examples 
are shown and the resulting strength lines are shown in 
Figure 15. From these lines it can be said that the value 
of cohesion, c, can vary from 100 to 200 lbs per square 
foot and 0 can vary from 19° to 22°. The significance of 
these values is doubtful as pointed out by Casagrande (ll). 
In the same reference the writer points out that it is 
better to use the term shearing strength than to divide the 
strength into two separate parts. 

It would seem that the shearing strength of a soil 
expressed in terms of true cohesion, effective stress and 
true angle of internal friction as determined from drained 
triaxial tests or consolidated-undrained tests with pore 
pressure measurements (4, 7) can be used in stability 
analysis, providing the true effective stress can be deter¬ 
mined. However, seldom can the true pore pressures at the 
instant of failure be known in the field and therefore, 
although the criterion may be correct, it has limited use. 
In the case of the silt slopes of Steep Rock Lake it is not 
possible to know the magnitude of pore pressures but a

52 


comparison of Figures 12 and 14 indicates that they may be 
of appreciable magnitude. Therefore* a knowledge of the 
true strength characteristics would serve only to give an 
idea of the magnitude of pore pressures at failure and in 
this way would be of some value. 

Casagrande notes also that more important than knowing 
how much of the strength is due to cohesion* is the question 
of progressive failure and how it determines the maximum 
average shearing resistance which will be effective along 
a possible sliding surface. The smaller the failure strain 
of a clay and the higher its sensitivity to remoulding* the 
smaller is its effective shearing resistance as compared to 
its strength. Progressive failure may also result when the 
sliding surface must cut through strata having widely dif¬ 
ferent stress-deformation characteristics. Progressive 
failure is best evaluated on the basis of empirical 
relationships between the effective shearing resistance 
computed from the actual failures and the strength as 
derived from laboratory tests. 

A comparison of Figures 12 and 14 shows that there is 
a factor of about 3 between shearing strength and shearing 
stress at any depth. This difference may be due to, (l) Pro¬ 
gressive failure of the material; (2) intrusive pore pres¬ 
sures; (3) reduction in strength due to strains. The last 
two points are considered later in this chapter. 






53 


Consolidation 

A number of consolidation tests were performed on the 
varved clay of the southeast Arm prior to the construction 
of a large earth-fill dam in the mouth of the arm. The 
consolidation of the clay during the construction of the 
dam was observed by 17 settlement gauges which were placed 
at the base of the dam on the surface of the clay. It was 
thought that a study of the test and settlement data would 
give an indication of the rate of consolidation which would 
occur in the East Arm as the water was lowered. 

A study of the time curves obtained from the laboratory 
consolidation tests showed that the coefficient of consoli¬ 
dation., c v , varied widely with applied load. For loads less 
than the pre-consolidation load the values of cy were very 

o 

large, being in the order of 0.01 cm /sec. At the pre- 
consolidation load the values were a minimum being in 
the order of 0.0005 cm^/sec. At loads greater than the 
pre-consolidation load the value of c v increased gradually. 

This same variation of c v with load is shown by Taylor 
in Figure 10-13 of Reference 25. The coefficient of con¬ 
solidation is defined as 

c v = Ml f e ) where a v is the coefficient of J 

a v w 

compressibility and is defined as a v = "Q_ e ; • also k is the 

dp 

permeability and e is the void ratio of the soil sample^ 














































'i 







54 


At loads less than the pre-consolidation load a y is small 
and increases gradually with load while the permeability 
and void ratio are near their maximum for the sample and 
decrease gradually with load. Therefore c v will have a 
large value which decreases towards the pre-consolidation 
load. As the pre-consolidation load is passed, however, a v 
increases rapidly while the permeability and void ratio 
decrease more rapidly with net effect being a very rapid 
decrease in c y . At higher loads a y tends to increase in 
magnitude more rapidly than the decrease in k and e and 
hence there is a gradual increase in c v . 

In view of the foregoing then, it may be said that for 
a normally consolidated clay insitu, any addition of load 
will cause consolidation on the virgin compression branch 
and therefore the value of c v will be a minimum. Assuming 
that the soil under the dam was initially normally con¬ 
solidated, a reasonable value of c y for the first portion 
of loading would be 5 x 10“^ cm^/sec. It was found from 
settlement gauge readings that the time of 50 % consolidation 
was in the order of three weeks. Then, using the formula 

T " Cvt 

W 

(where T, the time factor equals 0.197 for 50 % consolidation, 
t is time in seconds, and H is the depth of soil for single

drainage) to find the depth H we get 

H r 1 \ / 5 x IQ -1 ' x 3 x 7 x 24 x 3600 =2 2 feet. 

30.5 V 0.197 

It is known., however, that the depth of clay is in the 
order of 40 feet, or In the case of double drainage about 
20 feet, in this area. This large difference can be ac¬ 
counted for by saying the value of c v is wrong by a factor 
of 100, or by assuming that the answer is correct and there¬ 
fore there are drainage layers effectively every four feet 
throughout the depth of clay. If the factor c v is in error 
by a factor of four the drainage layers would be effectively 
every eight feet.* 

The value of c v can be wrong by a factor of 100 for 
the soil insitu if the permeability in the horizontal 
direction is about 103 times the permeability in the ver¬ 
tical direction. This may be reasoned as follows; if the 
value of c v is larger by a factor of 100 then drainage in 
the horizontal direction must be 100 times as fast as it is 
vertically but for the dam the drainage paths horizontally 
are in the order of 10 times longer than they are vertically 


*The term effectively is used as the layers would not 
be expected to be exactly or even approximately eight foot 
intervals but the root-mean-square of the intervals would 
be eight feet. 












. 































56 


and hence the horizontal permeability must be 1C)3 times 
the vertical. 

In the area of the dam the sediments were exposed for 
considerable depth in a water-cut gulley. In this gulley 
there were no sand lenses exposed and therefore, greater 
horizontal permeability must have accounted for the rapid 
consolidation of the sediments. 

The foregoing shows that the degree of consolidation 
at any time in the clay of the East Arm cannot even be 
guessed at without a complete and exact soil profile showing 
possible drainage layers. Even with this information the 
assumption would have to be made that the layers were 
continuous. 

It was assumed in Chapter IV that at some low rate of 
drawdown, consolidation would take place at a rate suffic¬ 
ient to increase the shearing strength by the amount of the 
added stress at any time. As discussed in Chapter VIII, 
Terzaghi shows that for any given rate of sedimentation the 
average degree of consolidation decreases with time. 

Terzaghi 1 s graph, which is reproduced as Figure 1 6 , shows 
that the average degree of consolidation U varies as a 

function of where t is the time from the beginning of 
c 

sedimentation and c is given by 

c = 3 ,_ C H in which c v is the coefficient of

Then — : Ko t q. 2 where Kp is another constant and the

average degree of consolidation U is some function of tq s 2 
or mathematically 


U = f(tq s 2). 

It should be possible to show by higher mathematics 
that U is some function of t and a steady rate of applica¬ 
tion of load, such that U z f(tq n ). Now it was shown in 
Chapter IV under drawdown, that the curve of time of draw¬ 
down versus rate could be expressed by DR^*^ - ^ where K Is 
a constant. The rate R can be expressed as a rate of 
application of load q^ due to drawdown and the duration D, 
by t. This gives tq^ n = K, the left side of which is 
identical in form to the function suggested above. 

This similarity may be of coincidence but more reason¬ 
ably it would indicate that a relationship does exist. The 
implications of its existence also tend to support the 
probability. This can be seen from the fact that tq^n is 
equal to a constant and since any function of a constant 
is a constant, the curve of Figure 10 is a curve of

59 


constant average degree of consolidation. Now, as any given 
rate of drawdown takes place for a period of time, the degree 
of consolidation at any depth decreases in this time while 
the stress increases. With time, the total increase in stress 
will become greater than the total net increase in strength 
until stress equals strength. 

Change in strength with drawdown is dependent on change 
in effective normal stress P^'which in turn is dependent on 
the degree of consolidation and on the change in magnitude 
of intrusive pore pressures. The factor q^, expressed above 
as a rate of application of load, is probably a combination 
of the effects of load application and of reduction of 
effective stress with increased pore pressure due to draw¬ 
down . 

The curves of increasing degree of consolidation shown 
in Figure 16 are dependent only on the excess hydrostatic 
pressure existing at the time sedimentation ceases and on 
the soil properties. Therefore, they should apply to the 
case of drawdown if the initial excess hydrostatic distribu¬ 
tion is the same. The significant point of these curves is 
that consolidation proceeds more rapidly for higher initial 
degree of consolidation. Therefore, drawdown should be 
undertaken in short periods with intermediate periods of no 
lowering to permit the average degree of consolidation to 
remain high. This amounts to the same thing as a small 


.

average rate of drawdown and hence the general correctness 
of the drawdown curve is again shown. 

Effect of Pore Pressures 

Because of its highly stratified nature the silt-clay 
of Steep Rock hake may be considered to have a permeability 
parallel to the layers considerably higher than the perme¬ 
ability normal to the layers. The sand lenses reported on 
page El , if continuous over large areas, would tend to 
increase this difference considerably. In view of this it 
may be reasoned that any increase in pore pressures within a 
more pervious layer, such as a silt or sand layer, would not 
initially be dissipated and in fact would act on adjacent 
layers as if they were impervious membranes. In this case 
the shearing strength may be roughly expressed by 

8 z C + ( jf' z - u w ) tan 0 (6-2) 

where symbols are as before and u w is pore pressure in excess 
of hydrostatic. 

This equation was proposed by Terzaghi (28)* as applic¬ 
able to any point of a surface located In a submerged sedi¬ 
ment. He used this equation in the above reference to 
express strength in a submerged sediment which is undergoing 

f 

*This paper is discussed in Chapter VIII.

61 


progressive consolidation. It is simple to show by a con¬ 
sideration of total, neutral and effective stresses that 
this concept is valid as used by Terzaghi and where the 
soil above the considered surface can be assumed to act as 
a membrane but cannot be used to express the change of 
conditions resulting from drawdown. 

As the water was lowered in Falls Bay the excess pore 
pressure in any layer could have assumed any value from 
zero to the total head of water drawn down at the point of 
consideration. This statement is valid on the assumption 
that the planes of varving are parallel to the slopes. 

There was no evidence and no reason to believe otherwise. 

It is evident then that if drainage is parallel to the slope, 
the magnitude of excess pore pressure at any point will 
depend on the rate of drainage from higher elevations and 
hence on the permeability parallel to the bedding planes. 

It may also depend to some degree on the rate of consol¬ 
idation at the higher elevations. 

The magnitude of excess pore pressure u w required to 
cause the second term of equation (6-2) to become zero 
at any depth H is fas H feet, where $ s is the submerged 

unit weight of soil and is the unit weight of water. 

For example, if ^ , is 45 pounds per cubic foot, and H is 

s 

assumed 30 feet, then the head required for zero effective 


stress is

V - «. ) ,1 



















62 


' 52". ' 4 ' x 30 = 21.6 feet 

This head is considerably less than the drawdown for the 
year previous to each of the last four slides and even in 
the event that sand seams were not continuous or the 
original assumption was not valid it is easily conceivable 
that this magnitude of excess pore pressure could exist 
through horizontal drainage from adjacent higher areas. 

The black organic material w:hich existed over the lake 
bottom was in a very, loose state and may have had a per¬ 
meability considerably higher than the redeposited silt in 
the East Arm. This would have acted as a continuous per¬ 
meable layer below the depth of the third, fourth, fifth 
and a portion of the sixth slides. 

To the south-east of the Arm, about 1500 feet from the 
escarpment of the first slide there is a small lake called 
Pal Lake. Contours (Fig. 22) show it to be at elevation 
about 1400 feet and its natural drainage was to the north¬ 
west into the Arm. It could then have produced a head of 
about 250 feet over the highest original silt levels and in 
1957 was over 400 feet above the water level in Falls Bay. 
Although drainage from the lake was supposedly cut off from 
the Arm in 1946 by a railroad embankment, it is possible 
that It may still have affected the slopes in the Arm 
through subterranean drainage. 








Where the pore pressures are sufficient to balance the 
effective overburden, the critical height of slope is given 
by Terzaghi and Peck (29) as H 
for the first four slides was in the order of 50 feet. The 
fifth slide occurred where a dredge was cutting a vertical 


cr z -ji. The height of slope 


face 30 to 40 feet high under water. The sixth slide had a 
total height of slope of about 100 feet. 

From Figure 15 the value of c was say 200 pounds per 
square foot which could give H cr = 18 feet. From this it 
can be readily seen that the magnitude of intrusive pore 
pressure needed for instability are relatively small as 
compared to the possible magnitudes of pressure which 
could exist in this area. 


Effect of Strains 

As mentioned previously, a shearing strain causes a 
break-down of the natural structure of the clay resulting 
in a transfer of stress to the unconsolidated or water 
phase of the soil. Skempton ( 21 , 23) has shown that in 
saturated soils the pore pressure resulting in undrained 
triaxial tests may be represented by 

Au=A<rj+A(A(r. - ^cr 3 ) (6-3) 

where = change in pore pressure 

AO} = change in minor principal stress 
= change in deviator stress 
A = Parameter which must be determined by test 




s (, \< :

64 


For conditions of final plastic equilibrium in plane 
strain, Skempton and Bishop (24) express equation (6-3) 
in the following form 

Au = AP + p. +(2 A-i)y/ P 0 * *7* ^ 

Where P 0 and KP Q are the initial vertical and horizon¬ 
tal effective stresses and AP and *£ the average increases in 
total vertical stress and horizontal shear stress respect¬ 
ively . 

In order to consider the effects of strains on the 
shearing resistance of the material, a brief study was made 
of the results of about seventy-five unconfined compressive 
strength tests. To determine whether any relationship 
existed between the modulus of deformation and depth of 
deposit, the initial tangent modulus* for each test was 
plotted against the depth from which the sample was taken. 
Figure 17 shows that no relationship is apparent from these 
tests. The scattering of the values may be due to a number 
of causes: (l) Samples from the same depth but different 
locations may have different strength characteristics 
depending on their relative elevations and past history; 

(2) dessication of the sample during testing would increase 
the modulus to a large degree; (3) previous sample distur¬ 
bance would decrease the modulus. 


*The initial tangent modulus is the slope of the stress- 
strain curve near the origin.

66 


The first of the above causes was checked by consid¬ 
ering only the tests on samples from one hole; these 
results are shown in circles in Figure 17. It can readily 
be seen that this does not significantly reduce the scat¬ 
tering of the points. The effects of the second and third 
causes cannot be determined without knowing the true 
relationship (if one exists) between the modulus of defor¬ 
mation and depth. 

To continue the study it was necessary to assume a 
relationship between modulus of deformation and depth. Two 
possible assumptions were considered: (l) The modulus is 
constant with depth; (2) percent strain at failure is 
constant with depth. The first assumption would result in 
an increase in percent strain at failure with increased 
depth while the second assumption would result in an increase 
in modulus of deformation with an increase in depth. Fig¬ 
ure 18 shows the strengths from the tests plotted against 
percent strains at failure. Although the points also show 
considerable scatter, there is some indication of a reduc¬ 
tion in strength with increased percent strain for any 
depth. There is also an indication that the percent strain 
at failure is fairly constant for undisturbed samples; the 
value being between 3^ and 4^? at any depth. 

On the basis of Line (l) of Figure 14, the modulus 
relationships for constant strain of 3$ and 4$ at any depth

are given as the curves of Figure 17. On the basis of the 
same strength relationship, lines are shown in Figure 18 
for assumed constant values of E of 15 and 30 kips per 
square foot. From the presented data it would appear that 
either assumption could be valid for the relationship 
between modulus of deformation and depth. It would be more 
reasonable to assume that percent strain at failure was 
constant for this material than to assume that the modulus 
of deformation was constant with depth. One fact which would 
tend to support this conclusion is that the material becomes 
more difficult to sample with increasing depth and some of 
the vane shear tests indicate increasing sensitivity with 
depth. 

From the theory of elasticity the relationship between 
Young’s Modulus, E, and the shear modulus, G, is: 

G = —,- El —__ where u is Poisson's Ratio. 

2(1 -f u) 

Assuming u for saturated clay equal to 0.5, then G = E. 

The change in shearing stress, t, with drawdown of the water 
is given by 

r= ^w h sin i cos i 

where h is the height of slope exposed by the drawdown and 
i is the slope angle. The shearing strain, g, may be 
expressed as 

h sin i cos i 


G 







69 


Assuming G is constant at 5 kips per square foot, ie. 

E * 15 kips per square foot, lines 1 and 2 of Figure 19 
give the shearing strain with depth for slopes of 4$ and 
2% respectively. These lines represent drawdown height 
equal to the depth of soil considered, i.e. maximum 
strains. Strains at depths greater than the height of 
drawdown are equal to the strain at the depth corresponding 
to the height of drawdown. This is illustrated by the 
vertical dashed line from point "A" which represents 40 
feet of drawdown. Families of lines exist for various 
slope angles and assumed values of the modulus of defor¬ 
mation . 

Curves 3 and 4 of Figure 12 show the variation of strain 
with depth for an assumed modulus of deformation which 
increases with depth. The increase is such that the strain 
at failure is at any depth. These curves also represent 
maximum strains for slopes of 2 % and 4$. Strains at depths 
greater than the height of drawdown are given by curves 
such as the decreasing curve beginning at point n B" which 
represents 20 feet of drawdown. Families of these curves 
exist for various slope angles and assumed variations in 
modulus of deformation. 

The magnitudes of strain resulting from drawdown as 
shown by Figure 19 are very small compared to the

corresponding strains at failure for the material. It is 
therefore not reasonable to assume that strains caused by 
increased shearing stress during drawdown result in a 
decrease in the shearing strength of the material. Ter- 
zaghi ( 27 ) suggests that if the shearing stress in a clay 
is increased to a value of more than one half the shearing 
resistance* the clay is likely to creep at constant shear¬ 
ing stress. As sensitive clays have a high modulus of 
deformation ( 30 )* constant almost to the point of failure* 
it would be expected that little creep would take place at 
stresses much below the shearing strength of these clays. 

At stresses approaching the shearing strength* however* 
some creep would probably occur. However* the redeposited 
and original surface material of the East Arm could have 
had a modulus of deformation considerably lower than the 
undisturbed varved material. This material could have 
creeped* under the added shearing stress* to the point where 
the structure was destroyed and a failure occurred. The 
resulting strain would tend to cause excess pore pressures 
in accordance with equation (6 - 3a). This process is 
suggested as a possible cause of the final break-down of 
the clay structure resulting in a flow slide. This state¬ 
ment applies only to the redeposited material on the basis 
of the assumption that the modulus of deformation is con¬ 
siderably lower than for the undisturbed varved material.

The effect of strains may enter the problem in another 
way. If the stress-strain characteristics of the light and 
dark materials are significantly different, failure will 
occur in a composite specimen at the strain of the more 
brittle layers. At this strain the less brittle layers 
will not be stressed to full strength values. Thus, strength 
values obtained from unconfined compression tests and vane 
shear tests will represent the full strength of the more 
brittle layers plus a portion of the strength of the less 
brittle layers and the strain at failure will be that of the 
more brittle material. If the less brittle layers have a 
shearing strength much lower than the others the average 
strength of the material will not be much different than 
that measured by these tests. However, the average shear¬ 
ing strength will not be representative of the strength of 
the material parallel to the layers. When subjected to a 
shearing stress parallel to the layers, the material will 
fail at a lower stress and at a higher strain than the values 
obtained from compression or vane tests. 

On the other hand, if the more brittle layers have the 
lower shearing strength, the test values will be lower than 
average strength of the material but will represent the 
failure strength and strain for the material under any stress 


conditions.

From tests on only two samples, Eden (13) found that 
the light layers had a shearing strength of about half that 
of the dark layers and were less brittle than the dark 
layers. Considerably more testing of this nature is re¬ 
quired to obtain significant quantitative data. However, 
it is reasonable to assume that the failures have taken 
place at larger strains and lower strengths than indicated 
by. unconfined compression and vane shear tests. 

Summary 

The shearing strength of the varved silt-clay as deter¬ 
mined from unconfined compression and vane shear tests is 
higher than the failure stresses of the six slides by a 
factor of about three. This difference can be attributed 
to a number of factors: (l) The difference in strength 
and stress-strain characteristics between the light and 
dark layers; (2) a smaller effective shearing resistance 
as compared to strength due to the high sensitivity and 
low failure strains of the material; ( 3 ) intrusive pore 
pressures; (4) reduction in strength due to strains; 

( 5 ) considerably lower shearing strength in the original 
surface and redeposited material not considered in the 
strength plot of Figure 14. This last factor would seem 
to be the answer to the cause of the slides involving the 
major volume of material which has moved.

The major change in stress conditions of the slopes 
resulted from the lowering of the water level and even 
though three of the slides occurred with dredge activity 
at the toe, the large areas involved must have had safety 
factors close to unity to have been affected. For this 
condition to exist, the strength of the material prior to 
drawdown must have been somewhat less than the stress after 
drawdown. Therefore, an instantaneous drawdown would cause 
stresses exceeding the shearing strength. It was shown 
under Consolidation that a low rate of drawdown for a long 
enough period of time could result in a low average degree 
of consolidation and therefore, stresses equal to or 
greater than the shearing strength. 





CHAPTER VII 


MECHANISM OF SLIDES 

Types of Failure 

In the case of small landslides and circular-arc slides 
the moving earth mass can be considered as a single rigid 
body. This implies that failure occurs simultaneously in 
all parts of the slip surface and thus, before slip can 
occur, the full shear strength at every point of the slip 
surface must be exceeded. 

In slides of large horizontal extent as compared to 
vertical depth the above concept Is not reasonable in most 
cases. Generally these slides begin in a relatively small 
area where the soil is over-stressed and grow rapidly, 
involving larger and larger areas. A slide which grows 
in the direction of its movement is termed progressive and 
one which grows in the opposite direction Is termed retro¬ 
gressive. These terms are used extensively in Scandinavian 
literature and to a large extent in Englis.h and American 
literature. 

In some cases a simultaneous flow of the whole area 
can occur. This case is discussed by ‘Terzaghi and Peck (29) 
and is called failure by spreading. This type of failure 
can take place when pore pressures in a permeable layer are 






76 

almost equal to the over-burden pressure of the whole area. 
The stability of slopes in this case can be determined 
only by a knowledge of pore pressures in the underlying 
permeable layers. With regard to the slides of this study 
it is not conceivable that pore pressures could simultan¬ 
eously counter-balance the over-burden of the large areas 
involved. This study did not deal with this type of fail¬ 
ure . 

Kjellman (lp) expresses the Swedish Geotechnical 
Institute’s conception of retrogressive and progressive 
slides and shows that the old concepts do not represent 
the essentials of these slides. The original concept of 
a retrogressive slide was proposed by the Geotechnical 
Commission of the Swedish State Railroads. The commission 
considered a retrogressive slide to be composed of a series 
of simple circular-cylindrical slides following in suc¬ 
cession one after another. Each slide was supposed to 
remove the support of the ground immediately behind it., so 
as to cause a new simple slide in that place. 

The old conception of a progressive slide was that it 
was composed of a series of simple circular-cylindrical 
slides following in succession. Each simple slide produced 
a load on the ground before it, thus causing a new simple 
slide in that place. One objection to this concept is that 
it does not explain the propagation of a slide for a long

distance on near horizontal surfaces. 

The Institute has proposed the following concepts of 
these slides. 

Retrogressive Glides 

The initial main slip surface was probably plane and 
nearly horizontal. It must have formed along a weaker 
layer and the strength of this layer was probably destroyed 
successively. This successive failure in the main slip 
surface spread rapidly from the front of the slide back up 
the slope and was thus a retrogressive failure. The defor¬ 
mation of the soil above the main slip surface spread up 
the slope at the same time and rate. Subsidiary, inclined- 
slip surfaces appeared and formed a zig-zag line in cross- 
section. Those soil wedges thus formed, which had their 
base on the main slip surface, slipped apart without any 
appreciable deformation; their tops constitute the clay 
ridges visible in the slide cavity. The interjacent wedges 
subsided and were deformed in their lowest parts so as to 
fit between the former wedges. 

Progressive Slides 

The slide started xvhere the inclination of the surface 
was the greatest and moved forward as a layer of soil moving 
simultaneously on a plane surface. The slip must have formed 
on a weaker layer and the strength of this layer was destroye 






























.

successively. This successive failure proceeded in the 
direction of flow and was thus a progressive failure. 

Causes of Successive Failure 

Kjellman in the same reference (15) gives one concept 
of successive failure; this concept is shown in Figure 17. 
Successive failure includes the formation of an extensive 
flat slip surface along a layer that is weaker than others. 
The x^eakness of this surface may be due to high pore water 
pressures. In Figure 2.0 ADj_ is the soil surface and AD is 
an extensive flat slip surface. 

Within the length AC the shearing stress is equal to 
the shearing strength but is below the shearing strength 
in CD. If the shearing force AB is decreased by AF, then 
for equilibrium, the shearing force in CD must increase by 

AP. 

These two changes in shearing force in the slip surface 
cause a corresponding increase in the normal forces acting 
on the element BB^ - CCq parallel to the surface. As other 
forces acting on the element remain constant, the element 
is compressed by an amount A J parallel to the slip surface 
and at the same time the ground beloxtf the slip surface 
extends a little due to the change in shearing forces. 

This compression results in the element A - BB]_ sliding 
the distance and if AjL is great enough most of the 

shear strength will be lost in AB. Consequently the

shearing strength may be destroyed in AB and in BC before 
it is fully developed in CD and hence we have successive 
failure. 

A second cause of successive failure is proposed by 
Terzaghi (28) under the name "progressive liquefaction", 
see Figure 2.1 . In the case of a metastable soil structure 
any disturbance of the structure will result in an initial 
transfer of stress to the liquid phase and hence liquefac¬ 
tion. The resulting excess pore pressures will be the 
total effective stress which existed prior to disturbance 
at the depth of liquefaction. In the case of submerged 
sediments this will be the submerged unit-weight of the 
sediment times its depth to the point of liquefaction. 

This excess pore pressure will be transmitted to 
adjacent pore water and hence will cause liquefaction of 
the adjacent soil. By this mechanism a wave of liquefaction 
can pass through an extensive mass of soil without any 
appreciable movement of the soil mass. 

East Arm Slides 

The slides of this study were not witnessed and hence 
no statement can be made as to their behaviour which would 
indicate whether they were progressive or retrogressive. 

From the geometry of these slides some statements can be 
made concerning the possible mechanism which took place.

One report indicated that the first slide could have 
been retrogressive and this is confirmed by the shape of 
the slide (Pig. 7). There were two large areas affected 
and it is unlikely that slides could have started simul¬ 
taneously at the top of both these areas and progressed 
toward the water. Also a slide starting at the top of one 
area could only have affected the adjacent area as a 
retrogressive slide. A slide starting near the shore-line 
would have affected both areas and therefore it may be 
assumed that the first slide was retrogressive. 

The second slide occurred in an area of low slopes with 
steeper slopes around the perimeter. It is possible in this 
case that the initial slip took place in the steeper slopes 
and progressed towards the water and therefore was a pro¬ 
gressive slide. 

The fourth slide occurred as a slow flow of material 
over a period of about 55 days. The mechanism of the flow 
was possibly a series of localized sloughs of the surface 
material. The sloughs would affect deeper material as the 
water was lowered and the surface exposed by the preceeding 
sloughs. Dredging activity continued near the toe through 
a major portion of the duration of the flow. 

The fifth slide occurred while a vertical face was 
being dredged under water. The initial slip probably took 
place as a circular-arc failure. This caused liquefaction

in the adjacent soil and successively up the slope. The 
slope must have been fairly stable at the time as the 
failure did not spread far from the initial slip. 

The initial slip of the sixth slide probably occurred 
over a large area near the water due to drawdown and per¬ 
haps pore pressures. The slide then proceeded up the 
slope by successive failure or progressive liquefaction. 







CHAPTER VIII 


VARIETIES OF SUBMARINE FAILURES 


by Karl Terzaghi* 


In this paper, reprinted in 1957 from the Proceedings 
of the Eighth Texas Conference on Soil Mechanics and 
Foundation Engineering of September 1956, Karl Terzaghi 
describes three categories of submarine slope failures and 
explains the mechanisms by which they occur. As many 
similarities exist between the clay slopes being exposed 
in Steep Rock Lake and submarine slopes described by 
Terzaghi, this paper was studied in detail. A discussion 
of the paper and its applicability to the problem is the 
subject of this chapter. 

The first category of slope failures is the rapid 
downward movement of a patch of cohesive sediments perched 
on the steep slope of cohesionless materials which is 
otherwise stable. The slide occurs as a movement of the 
fine grained deposit on its base as soon as the deposit 
grows beyond a certain size. Although they sometimes 
cause serious destruction, the slides are minor incidents 
in the otherwise continuous growth of the deposits. 


^Reference 28. 


















































84 


The second category of movements is the large scale 
spontaneous movement of short duration on both steep and 
gentle slopes above fine-grained, cohesionless or slightly 
cohesive sediments. They are caused by spontaneous lique¬ 
faction of the metastable structure of the deposit. The 
impulse for the liquefaction can be any agent tending to 
change the position of the solid particles with reference 
to each other, for example seepage pressures or earthquakes. 
The liquefaction may start at one spot and spread over lar¬ 
ger and larger areas with a. velocity of at least 10 miles 
per hour. If the slope is steep the movement of the mass 
assumes the character of a landslide. On gentler slopes 
the movement assumes the character of a violent agitation 
of the material which the actual movement of particles may 
be short and their velocity of movement small compared to 
the propogation of the boundary of liquefaction. 

Thirdly, slopes may fail by more or less continuous 
slumping, of gentle slopes underlain by soft recently 
deposited clay. Failure is caused by the fact that consol¬ 
idation lags behind deposition. . 

It is noted that the effect of shocks on slopes 
underlain by clay or coarse grained sediments is likely 
to be unimportant, whereas slopes on fine-grained co- 
hesioniess or almost cohesionless sediments may start to 








































85 


flow with only mild shock or vibrations. Terzaghi shows 
that the critical grain-size is from 2 to 20 microns. The 
conspicuous difference between the performance of different 
sediments in the event of slope failures is chiefly due to 
their differences in shear characteristics. 

Terzaghi expresses the shearing resistance of a sediment 
by the equation 

s = c 4 . ( f s z - u w ) tan 0 

wherein / s z is the total submerged weight of sediment acting 
per unit area, at depth z and u w is the excess pore pressure 
existing at depth z due to incomplete consolidation; hence 
the term in parenthesis represents the effective stress at 
depth z. 

The value of u w may assume any value between zero'and 
/s z and represents the difference between the pore pressure 
at any given point at depth z and the value z/ w . The degree 
of consolidation.U at any depth z may be represented by the 
ratio: 



In a loose deposit of fine sand (6 to 20 micron size) the 
structure is metastable and hence likely to collapse at 
slight provocation. At the instant of collapse the weight 
of solid particles is temporarily transferred from the 
points of contact onto the water. The hydrostatic pressure 




■: . : ~ . 

■ 







i,; - ) 













86 


then increases from /* w z by an amount u w equal to ft 3 Z • The 


degree of consolidation U drops from unity to zero and effec¬ 
tive pressure at depth z equals zero. The instability 
resulting from this temporary excess hydrostatic pressure 
has been called "spontaneous liquefaction". Spontaneous 
liquefaction may also occur in "quick clays". 

The concept of a metastable structure and spontaneous 
liquefaction was applied to the sediment of Steep Rock Lake 
in Chapters II and VII. 

Terzaghi gives a relation between time and the average 
degree of consolidation of a growing sediment. A graphical 
representation of this relationship shows that as sedimen¬ 
tation progresses the average degree of consolidation 
decreases with time (Fig. 16). It should be noted that the 
term "c" in equation 4 of this paper is incorrect as the 
units of c are sec cm3 gm“^. The correct equation. 



is given by Olsson (19). If sedimen¬ 


tation stops at any time the degree of consolidation U 
increases as indicated by a rising set of curves. The 
relationship for these curves is not given by Terzaghi but 
is given by Olsson. It Is reasonable to assume that some 
similar relationship would exist between the degree of con¬ 
solidation and time, for a sediment subjected to a state of 


steady drawdown. The rate of sedimentation q s is the rate

of application of load. The rate of drawdown may also be 
expressed as a rate of loading. The difference between 
sedimentation and drawdown is that in the case of drawdown 
the length of seepage path does not increase as it does with 
sedimentation. 

It is of particular significance to note that the curves 
of increasing degree of consolidation increase much more rapid¬ 
ly as the time from beginning of sedimentation (or drawdown) 
is decreased. The variation in degree of consolidation with 
time during drawdown is discussed in Chapter VI. 

Terzaghi gives examples of each of the categories of 

submarine slope failures and discusses their mechanisms at 

detail. In his example of slope failures on clay there is 

an arithmetic error in the conversion of years to seconds. 

The value for JiH should be 27 instead of 103 as given in 
c 

the paper, however, this error does not greatly change the 
conclusions reached. 

This paper was of value relative to the problem in 
several ways. It shows that the sediments of Steep Rock 
Lake can have a metastable structure which is subject to 
spontaneous liquefaction under slight disturbance. In 
regard to this it cap be noted that the light or least 
plastic layers are probably inherently more unstable than 
the darker more plastic layers. The mechanism of spon¬ 
taneous liquefaction is clearly explained and is a 




88 


reasonable concept of the mechanics of progressive failure 
in quick clays. The paper also shows that under conditions 
of steady drawdown the degree of consolidation decreases 
resulting in a reduction in safety factor with time. 





CHAPTER IX 


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

Six major flow slides occurred from the beginning of 
1955 to the end of 1957 during the dredging of the highly 
sensitive glacial clays which existed in the bottom of Steep 
Rock Lake. Although these slides were of relatively minor 
consequence, as dredging proceeds and the slopes become 
higher and steeper, slides of this nature will become more 
serious. The dredges could be stranded or even capsized by 
a large flow of material. A study of these slides may serve 
as a basis for the control of conditions so that future 
slides are unlikely or at least predictable. 


Summary 

The original lake bottom deposits were primarily a very 
sensitive, well laminated silt-clay overlain by superficial 
deposits of black mud and sand, and underlain by a dense 
gravel till. The areas of the East Arm, in which the slides 
took place, and most of Falls Bay had a layer of silt up to 
30 feet thick deposited over them from the dredging oper¬ 
ations in the Middle Arm. It was in this redeposited 
material that the largest flow of material took place. 

The geometry of the slides gave the basic data required 
for the various considerations but in itself afforded no 
correlating relationships which would give an indication

90 


of the cause of failures. 

The rate of drawdown of the water in Falls Bay gave 
the only relationship correlating the six slides. The 
relationship has been expressed as DR^-2 z 8 where D is 
the duration of drawdown in days at the rate R in feet per 
day. It was shown that this relationship also may express 
a constant average degree of consolidation of the material. 
This is reasonable since only drawdown, affects changes in 
stress conditions in the slopes. If drawdown were instan¬ 
taneous no consolidation could take place and stress would 
exceed strength at some depth. At a low rate of drawdown 
consolidation would take place and thereby increase the 
strength. Stress may exceed strength, however, due to a 
reduction in average degree of consolidation under a pro¬ 
longed low rate of drawdown. 

In only three cases could the validity of the drawdown 
relationship be questioned. The first and fifth slides did 
not follow the relationship; the former can be explained on 
the basis of pore pressures and the latter on dredge activity. 
Had the slopes been subjected to any appreciable drawdown 
immediately prior to the fifth slide, a much more extensive 
flow would have occurred as happened in August 1957 after 
a drawdown of eight feet. The third case was the drawdown 
from June to August 1955 which should have caused a flow of 








91 


material between coordinates 23*000 N and 24*000 N. The 
reason for this anomaly cannot be readily explained on the 
basis of known facts. 

The maximum shearing stresses in the slopes* determined 
from the infinite slope analysis with steady seepage occur¬ 
ring* are considerably less than the shearing strengths* 
determined from unconfined compression and vane shear tests. 
This may be due to one or a combination of all of the fol¬ 
lowing factors: (l) Intrusive pore pressures may have been 
of sufficient magnitude to reduce the effective stresses to 
a low value; (2) strains may cause a break-down of the soil 
structure resulting in a reduction in shearing strength; 

(3) progressive failure causes a reduction in strength of 
a stratified soil mass because of the difference in stress- 
strain characteristics of the different layers. The change 
in stress conditions causing the slides is an increase in 
shearing stress at any depth due to the drawdown of the 
water level. Within the depth of drawdown* shearing stres¬ 
ses are increased about 2j times their submerged values. 

If intrusive pore pressures are of sufficient magni¬ 
tude to reduce effective normal stresses to zero the shear¬ 
ing strength of the soil is equal to the cohesion. Five 
of the six slides can be accounted for if a value of 100 
pounds per square foot is assumed for the cohesion. 

(Terzaghi (28) suggests this value as the minimum value for

92 


cohesion of clays). Insufficient data were available for 
the third slide and hence reasonable stresses could not 
be determined. Pore pressures could have effectively 
reduced the shearing strength of the material. However, 
if it is assumed that no pore pressures existed, a value 
of 100 pounds per square foot or less for shearing strength 
may be realistic for the loose redeposited silt. 

For a material with a low modulus of deformation, 
shearing strains cause creep which breaks down the structure 
of the soil resulting in a decrease of shearing resistance. 
This concept may apply to the redeposited silt in which the 
largest volume of flbW took place. 

The large areas Involved in these slides are affected 
by the mechanics of either progressive liquefaction or 
successive failure. The slides may be termed progressive 
or retrogressive depending on the direction of movement of 
the failure as compared to the direction of flow of mater¬ 
ial . 

Conclusions 

Most of the material involved in these slides con¬ 
sisted of non-varved redeposited material, therefore, it 
is this material that should be considered in the study 
of the slides rather than the varved material. The 
redeposited materia,1 would probably have a looser struc¬ 
ture and.lower shearing strength than the varved material

93 


and would also be extra-sensitive. The first and second 
slides occurred in the varved material but their low 
stability can be explained otherwise. 

Drawdown of the water resulted in increased shearing . 
stresses in the soil. Previous to five of the slides the 
average degree of consolidation was low with the result 
that the increased shearing stresses exceeded the shearing 
strength and failures took place. 

The first slide occurred in varved material and can 
only be attributed to high pore pressures resulting from 
the creeks which flowed through the area.. The pore pres¬ 
sures acting through sand lenses at about 25 feet depth 
must have been of sufficient magnitude to reduce the 
effective stresses to about zero. 

The second slide occurred in varved material on a 
slope of up to 7 percent. The increased shearing stress 
resulting from the lowering of the water level could have 
resulted in strains which caused a break-down of the soil 
structure. 

The third and fourth slides occurred only in the 
redeposited material. Strains may have caused some break¬ 
down of the soil structure or pore pressures may have 
existed which reduced the shearing resistance, but, the 
most reasonable explanation is that the shearing stresses 
caused by lowering the water exceeded the shearing strength

of the material. In the case of the fourth slide the toe- 
slope was being increased by dredging. The fifth slide 
was triggered by a high vertical face being cut at the toe. 
The slope in general was relatively stable and the dis¬ 
turbance affected only a small area. 

The sixth slide occurred in redeposited and original 
lake bottom material. A steeper slope existed at the toe 
which may have resulted in some creep but the final 
n triggering” was due to a very rapid lowering of the water. 

Although details were not available, it was known that 
other areas in Falls Bay were subjected to the critical 
rate of drawdown which caused the sixth slide but no 
instability resulted in these areas. From contour maps 
of the Bay it would appear that none of the redeposited or 
original surface materials remained in 1957 with the ex¬ 
ception of the East Arm. It may be concluded that the 
material remaining in Falls Bay and the East Arm has a 
higher strength than the material which was involved in the 
slides and therefore instability will not result from future 
lowering of the water and dredge activity. However, local 
failures may occur if slopes are- cut too steep or if run¬ 
off water is allowed to enter the slopes along rock contacts. 

It is suggested that, for a complete answer to the 
problem of these slides and flow slides in general, numerous

field and laboratory soil tests must be performed with a 
view to answering the following questions: (l) What pore 
pressures if any exist in the slopes; (2) what is the dif¬ 
ference in strength characteristics between the light and 
dark material; ( 3 ) what are the strain characteristics in 
the direction of the failure plane; (4) what are the 
horizontal and vertical permeabilities; ( 5 ) does the time 
of consolidation change due to higher horizontal permea¬ 
bility?
