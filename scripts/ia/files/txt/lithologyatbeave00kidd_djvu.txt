CHAPTER OHE, 


IHTRODUCTION 
I* Introductory Statement, 

In the fall of 1947 the Department of Geology was in 
possession of an imxportant v/ell core. The well had been drilled 
for oil and gas and later abandoned, by Anglo-Canadian Oil Com¬ 
pany, Home Oil Company, and Calgary and Edmonton Corporation 
jointl;/. The well was located south and east of Beaverhills Lake, 
near Ryley on the main line of the Canadian national Railway, 

The core was important in that it was an almost complete 
section of the Lower Cretaceous and the Devonian strata. 

Dr, J, A, Allan suggested that the writer carry out a 
research study of the Insoluble Residues in the Palaeozoic strata. 
The study of insoluble residues is a comparatively 
recent contribution to geological investigation and interpretation 
of limestone and dolomite strata, nothing has been done at Alberta 
on the subject apart from, the research of private oil comp8.nies, 
which is unpublished miaterial. The main published v/orks have been 
from, the United States, 

The well core consisted of about 350 boxes, which were 
stored at the tim.e in the Research Council storeroom. 










- 2 - 


After examination the boxes were nailed up, and stored 
outside, off the ground, and covered with canvas. 

The writer logged the core carefully^noting main lithological 
imits, breaks, fossils, and other markers. Samples were taken in 
the Devonian at 5=»foot intervals (where possible), and carefully 
labelled as to depth. 

Later these samples were treated in the manner to be des- 
cribed, and the resulting residues examined and logged. 

The original samples were gone over with the Ultra-Violet 
Light, - "ILLneralight” apparatus, kindly loaned by Mr, J, A, Kelso, 
Director, Provincial Industrial Laboratory, 

Results were tabulated and conclusions drawn as to the 
relative merit of the study. 

The thesis is divided properly into t>.TO m.ain parts: Part A 
- Lithology 5 Part B - Insoluble Residues, 

II, Acknovifledgments 

The writer is deeply indebted for the help and guidance 
given in the preparation of this thesis: 

To Dr, J, A, Allan, Head, Department of Geology, University 
of Alberta, who suggested the problem, and under whose guidance this 
thesis has been prepared, the writer wishes to express his thanks 
for kindly advice, criticisms, and proper direction. 

To Dr, P, S, Warren for his invaluable help in fossil 
identification, and stimulating talks on stratigraphy, the writer

was spudded in May 6, 1947, and abandoned July 15, 1S47. T!b.e 
closest hamlet is hyley but Tofield is the nearest to'.rn of any size. 
Both villages are located on the main line of the Canadis-n National 
Railways, Ihe well site is approximately 50 miles southeast of 
Edmonton,

V, Physiography , 

The well site was located in that part of Alberta generally 
referred to as "The Great Plains" or"Interior Plains" of Canada, 

Surface features are due. to several factors, (^ ) Under« 
lying formations are relatively soft Cretaceous beds almost flat 
lying. 

Prolonged erosion after deposition of Tertiary tim;e left 
an und'i/’latory surface with broad valleys and some erosional remnants. 
Glaciation, Yfhich covered most of the plains filled these 

valleys, 

A subsequent erosion and deposition cycle established the 
present drainage system. 

The earlier drains-ge system had been blocked by this 
glaciation, 

A temporary drainage system existed during the ice retreat. 

The prevailing direction of this drainage was to the southeast 
With final retreat of the ice the general north and east 
system as now in existence was established. 

The area lies in the "Torlea Flat" west of the Viking 
Moraine, considered by Warren (59) to express a much older topography

than any area to the east of the Viking Moraine. 

West of this flat area there are other deposits of boulder 
tills and clays lying on bedrock or "Saskatchewan” gravels and sands (41) 
In the "Flat" bedrock is almost at grass-roots and the Beaver- 
hills Well was spudded almost on bedrock. 

The main physiographic feature of the area is Beaverhills 
Lake, considered to be a glacial remnant with drainage north to the 
North Saskatchewan River, It is approximately 6 mdles north of 
Ryley and has a m,axim.um length of 14,5 miles, and a m.aximum width of 
8,5 miles,^ 

Greatest depths are not over 14 feet. Elevation is 2202 
feet above sea level, 

VI, Summary and Conclusions . 

General 

The Beaverhills Lake Well No, 2 area as shown in the Index 
Map, is underlain by beds of Mesozoic and Palaeozoic age. Unconsol¬ 
idated Keewatin glacial deposits are very thin. The well site lies 
in the Torlea Flat of Warren (5S), between the Viking Moraine to the 
east and boulder tills and clays to the west. The mi.ain physiographic 
feature is Beaverhills Lake, some 15 miles long by 8 miles wide, with 
drainage north to the North Saskatchewan River, 

Drilling commenced almost on bedrock and possibly near the 
base of the Edmonton, or in the Bearpaw formation as shown by the 
geological map, - Map No, 2, 

The only information available to the writer for the drilled 
interval 0-2405 feet, is that given by electrolog picks m.ade by

Canadian Oil Company, Calgary, Alberta. 

From the electrolog the Imperial Oil Company picked the top 
of the Lea Park at 970 feet, the top of the Alberta shale at 1550 
feet and the Second Ifhite Specks at 2055 feet. 

In that part of the country little attention was paid to 

I anything above the Viking productive zone (22), 

( 

! 

I Coring commenced at approximately 2297 feet, but the first 

12 boxes, all dark shale (Alberta), were dumped on the ground due to 
a shortage of core boxes. 

I Consequently the first core examined by the writer was Core

The main missing interval at the top of the Devonian, (3174- 
3541) was drilled, and a description has been kindly supplied by 
I\&*. Hicks. 


j There are also other minor missing intervals due to milling 

I iron, and other difficulties,

Part A - Lithology 

Drilling commenced near the base of the Edmonton or in 
Bearpaw formation and no true thickness can be assigned to it, hence 
no thickness is given for the underlying Belly Hiver Series. Surface 
casing (10 3/4 inch) was landed at 253 feet. 

The Lea Park formation is approximately 580 feet thick at 
Beaverhills No, 2.

Cretaceous age is approximately lOlS feet thick. 

Top of the Lower Cretaceous -r cgting , apparently conformably, 

9 * the Colorado is placed at 2566 feet. 

There is considerable variance of opinion as to the age of 

the black shales lying above the sandstones of the Lower Cretaceous

”Blackleaf member”. 

Top of the Viking sandstone is placed at 2424 feet, and base 
Iat 2503 feet. 

The Detrital Zone is placed in the interval 3094-5142 feet. 
Top of the Devonian is placed at 3172 feet. 

Top of the salt is placed at 5100 and bottom at 5424 feet. 
Bottom of the hole is 5558 (estimated). 

The writer would place everything from 3172 feet down to the 
”red beds” (5081 feet) in Upper Devonian, 

I Those beds below the ”red beds" (including the salt) are 

jplaced in the Mddle Devonian on faimal and lithological evidence. 

I Beds of Pre-Devonian age are apparently not present in 

jBeaverhills Uo. 2 Well, 
j Part B - Insoluble Residues , 

Only the Palaeozoic (Devoniar:) strata was studied. 

Sampling was carried out at 6-foot intervals wherever 
possible over a total thickness of about 2060 feet. 

Approximately 270 samples were treated and examined. 

The method of H. S. MacQueen was the one used, with minor 










8 


modifications* Some photographs and microphotographs were taken of 
the residues. 

Examination of the residues was carried out using a wide 
field low power binocular microscope. In addition the petrographic 
microscope was used for special residues where a more detailed study 
was desired* 

j In many cases negative results were obtained due to the 

) 

Ipresence of shale and argillaceous material* However certain zones 
!could be determined by the residues. 

There was in general a marked absence of good coarse residues. 
Chert and quartz are not predominant. Ydiere they occur they are very 
definite. Anhydrite is self-evident. Gypsum is not abundant. 

Accessory minerals are not of importance, and it was felt 
that elutriation techniques and heavy mineral separations were tin- 
neoessary. 

Suites of residues are necessary for correlation and ident- 
jification of zones, no one residue is diagnostic of any stratigraphic 
horizon. 

Unfortunately no correlations with other areas could be made 
by the use of residues. The writer was confined to one well. Further 
studyJujould include correlating with other areas.

CHAPTER TWO 


EXAJ£IMTION OF SUB SURFACE SMiPLES 


!♦ General 

A brief summary of the methods in common use in the petroleum 
j industry is given* The methods used in the present study are stressed, 
I and reasons are given for the modification of standard practices* 
j Certain techniques were found to be impracticable* 


I 

I Drilling and Coring Methods 

I Three methods with modifications are in general use in the 

I petroleum industry; they are: 

i 

i 1* "Cable Drilling", also known as "cable-tool drilling”, 

I the "percussion method", or the "standard method”* 

I 

I Briefly the outfit consists of a string of tools, at the 


i 


! lower end of which is a heavy steel bit, suspended on a wire cable, 

I 

I which is in turn controlled by machinery near the mouth of the hole* 

1 


; An initial twist is imparted to the cable, and by repeated 

J 

jlifting and lowering, the rock is cut by the blows of the bit* Some 


water is always kept in the hole* Water bearing stratum, and soft 
shales usually have to be "cased-off”, to prevent caving. 

Rock cuttings are removed in a "bailer"* In the absence of 


caving the samples are generally reliable and uncontaminated. The 
cable-tool system employed for limestone rocks today results in frag¬ 
mental samples normally fit for the production of thin sections. 










- 10 - 


Modern methods, using cable-tool core-barrels, lead to the 
successful recovery of good core with almost all types of rock (33), 
2, Rotary Drilling, 

This is accomplished by rotating a perforated fish-tail bit 
which is screwed firmly to the lower end of a string of pipe, known 
as the "drill stem"'* 


i 

I 



A "draw-works” rotates the "kelly", which in turn rotates 
the "table". The table rotates the "string”, and the bit cuts deep 
into the earth* 

As the hole goes down additional "joints" are added to the 
string. During drilling a thin fluid "mud” is pumped down through 
the hollow drill stem. It emerges from the hollow bit sweeps the 
cuttings upward, and after they emerge from the hole, they pass over 
a "shale sliaker”^. Samples are collected, washed, dried and examined. 

The samples as contrasted to cable -tool samples do not emerge 
as soon as they are cut. They arrive at the surface some time after 
having been cut. This is one advantage of cable-tool methods. It 
is apparent that this time lag becomes greater as the hole gets deeper. 

Single or double core barrels with cutting bits are employed 
in rotary coring today. These give good cores but do not entirely 
overcome the problem of contamination. 

Drilling mud may "pack in” with the rock. Itmay pack into 
loose sand giving a false picture of sand and shale. It may be that 
the mud gets "cored" itself. To guard against a false conclusion 
Miner (33) suggests;

(a) With soft rocks always scr8,pe off the outer margin of 
the core. 

(b) Take the interior of the sample for investigation, 

(c) Split the cores longitudinally at regular intervals. 

Note ; The writer was asked by the companies concerned 
not to split any core. 

General practice is to core only at interesting horizons. 
Complete coring is very costly for several reasons. Each time the 
core barrel is full the "string" must be pulled, unscrewed, and then 
replaced. A "core" such as at Beaverhills Lake No, 2 Well being about 
j 9 feet long. It is apparent that much time and money is necessary in 
such an operation. 




The writer was fortunate in having a fairly complete core to 
examine. Recovery was good and on the whole the core was in fine shape, 
3. Diamond Drilling 

This is another process in which the cutting tool is rotated. 
The bit is a hollow cylinder of soft steel in the lov/er edge of which 
black diam.onds are set, or usually the whole is "cast." The bit is 
screwed to a "core shell" which is screwed to the lower end of a "core 


barrel". The core barrel is screwed on to a string of hollow steel 
rods which reach to the top of the hole. The whole set-up is rotated. 
Clear water or mud is used as lubricant and to keep the tools cool. 

As soon as the cores project at the top from the hollow rods, they are 
pulled, and the core removed. 

Diamond drilling is extensively used in mining operations. 

A solid rod of rock is preserved. Bedding, facies changes, and no

12 


In Slamming up the merits of the three methods 5 

( 1 ) Diamond drill cores are excellent, but are very expensive 
especially at great depths, 

( 2 ) Modern "rotary cores" are good, fossils are preserved, 
facies changes and bedding are usually readable. Care in interpretation 
as noted above should be taken because of caving etc. Many authorities 
regard rotary "ditch” samples as the poorest of all three methods. 

Note ; In coring salt horizons by any method, if brine is used as a 
lubricant instead of mud or fresh water, excellent cores are obtainable. 
Brine was not used at Beaverhills Lake No, 2 Well, 


CQ3.1ecting, Labelling etnd Logging Samples , 

I In collecting for insoluble residue ssimples, it is of great 

j importance that samples be clean. Surface samplii^ should be effected 

[ 

I at chosen intervals along and transverse to the strike of the beds. 
Subsurface sampling involves collecting material from horizons deter¬ 
mined primarily by change of lithologic facies and of texture of the 
rock (9 ). 


In the present study the writer took samples at main breaks 
or changes, and at 5-foot intervals. This is considered by most 
(insoluble residue men^to be the best interval, "Quartering", and 
splitting of the core was not done but representative samples were 
taken in all cases. 




















13 - 


Samples were placed in manila envelopes and labelled as to 
depth taken* These samples were later treated and placed in small 
glass bottles, each bearing a label with depths marked on them in ink 
to correspond to the original samples* Later, labels were placed 
inside the bottles in addition to the outside labels to preclude loss 
due to rrdshandling. For example, a label reads: 

B*H*»s No* 2. 

4583-4588 

(insoluble residue) 

Logging the core was actually the first step* The core boxes 
in most cases were marked on top and on one side in this manner: 

B*H*»s No* 2 Core No. 341 5545-5555 

Dimensions of the boxes vary a little but in general are about 

w 

t 41-42 inches long/9-10 inches wide and about 3 inches deep* Ihen the 

i 

I lettered lid is removed the core is in three sections, usuaJly about 

I 3 feet to a section. Top and bottom is indicated, reading from left 

I to right* About 100 feet of core was opened and examined at one time* 

( 

I First an estimate of the percentage of core recovered was 

I 

I made. Then the core was examined on the spot with hand lens, acid, 

t 

s 

I and binocular microscope* Next a description was written up, noting 

t 

I lithology, facies change, bedding, fossils and other things of note* 
Samples were then taken, (fossils separately) and the core was re¬ 
boxed and disposed of in preparation for the next series* Colors are 
better noted in daylight and night logging was avoided* 

Insoluble residue treatment was done later, and a fraction 
of the original sample saved for ”Mineralight” examination and further 
reference.

Examination of residues is fully dealt with in Chapter Four, 
rV, Methods of Examination of Minerals 
A. Physical - (l) General 

Before special treatments the maximtmi information was obtained 
from hand samples by eye-inspection aided with a hand lens and also 

cZ. 

an, the binocular microscope. Things noted were; identif¬ 
ication of the whole sample, color texture, composition, fossils or 
organic structure, bedding lamination, cleavage, and any other special 
structures or characteristics. 

Original color of the rock is very important. Geologists on 
the whole tend to interpret colors differently depending to a great 
extent upon their own degree of perfection of color vision. For this 
reason the writer attempted to obtain the standard work of Dr, Ridgway 
(74), This text was not obtainable at the time of writing so the 
writer relied upon his own color sense supplemented by the unbiased 
opinions of other people. The samples were washed carefully to remove 
drilling mud. 

Other physical characteristics exhibited by minerals are: 

1, Specific gravity or relative density:- Anhydrite samples 
were heavy, (S.G, = 2,899 to 2,985) and readily identifiable, Elut- 
riation methods for the separation of heavy mineral residues were not 
used. The method involves the use of costly heavy liquids such as 
bromoform. The heavj'- mineral assemblage present in Beaverhills Lake 
Ro, 2 Well was small and in the main pyrite. It was felt that this 
method of examination was unnecessary.

2* Characteristics depending upon Electricity and Magnetism: 
An ordinary horseshoe magnet was passed over the residues with 
negative results* 

3* Taste and odor: - Halite gave the common ”salt»taste” 
and the potash salt a very pronounced "bittern taste”* 

Kaolinite was recognizable by breathing on samples and getting 
an earthy or "kalsomine” -smeil. This smel l is properly described as 
argillaceous* Other samples exhibited bituminous, sulphurous and 
fetid odors* 

Porosity determinations were not attempted, 

(2) Optical 

For the main part of the study, a fairly low power wide field 
Bausch and Lomh binocular microscope was used* .Iv^agnifications obtain- 
I able were: 

10 power ocular = 7, 15, and 30 times 
j 15 power ocular =10.5, 22*5, and 45 times 

I 

I The binocular microscope was sufficient to identify textural character- 

I 

istics. With practice, fairly reliable mineralogical determinations 
could be obtained* A. standard petrographic microscope was used in 
studying the residues in immersion mounts of known refractive index. 
Constituents of residues are discussed in Chapter Four* 

In a systematic examination of the residues the following 
plan was adopted: 

(a) With transmitted white light, low and high power objectives 
criteria for determination are: - Color, Habit, Shape, Size, Fracture 
Parting, Cleavage Refractive Index , Thickness of grains* 




























^ ■■::i 

■ w- '. W- 















- 16 - 


(b) With transmitted light, crossed nicols: 

Isotropism or anisotropism 
Birefringence, Extinction 

(c) With convergent light, high power objective, crossed nicols 
and Bertrand lensi 

Delection of interference figure: -uniaxial or biaxial. 
Determination of optic sign 
Optic axial angle. 

Extinction, refractive index, color, habit and comparison 
with mounts of known minerals, were in the main sufficient to deter¬ 
mine the minerals present, 

(B) Chemical 

Complete chemical analyses are utilized by some workers in 
Sedimentary Petrology, Goldich and Parmelee in their report on the 
j Ellenburger Rocks, Llano County, Texas, (21) tabulate results of com- 
j plete chemical analyses for 75 samples. Included also are data on 
\ bulk, density, porosity and permeability, Chemical analyses hov/ever 

I 

] involve precise measurements and much time. It was felt that the end 

S 

result is as well achieved by the use of the microscope. 

The following is a brief summary of the chemical examination 
of minerals apart from complete analyses; 

1, The use of reagents in the wet way. The most commonly 
employed reagents are hydrochloric acid, nitric acid and sulphin-ic 
acid. The writer used only hydrochloric acid and nitric acid. 
Hydrochloric acid was used to test for dolomite and anhydrite; and 
later used exclusively in the Insoluble Residue Procedure, Hitric

acid was used to distinguish pyrite from marcasite. Ether was used 
to presence of oil, 

2. Staining methods used to differentiate dolomite from ; 

limestone^ These methods include the use of various reagents such 

as Lembergs solution, silver nitrate - potassium chromate solution. 

They are not entirely reliable and were not used in this study. j: 

3. Blow-pipe analyses. This procedure was not felt to be J 

necessary. j" 

4. Closed and open tube tests, Jj 

5. Flame tests. The only one used was the test for potas- I- 

sium rich salts, -

• Identification of Mnerals . - A, Physical - Optical 

(1) Gypsum and Anhydrite j| 

Gypstmi (Selenite) was mainly determined on crystal habit, color's 

i 

low index of refraction (lower than 1.54), and extinction angle. An- |p 

i; 

hydrite on the other hand has a variable refractive index 1.57 to 1,61, , 

I straight extinction, positive optical character, and rectangular 
(pseudo-cubic cleaved) type of crystal. 

(2) Calcite and Dolomite 

These are difficult to distinguish. However in this work 
both had been completely removed from the original samples, and were 
not present in the residue. In one or two isolated cases small amounts ! 
of calcite did crop up, but further digestion in HCl removed them 
completely, ll 

I 

(3) Salt and Carnallite (or Sylvite) ! 

Ideally these would not be present in the residue, since both |

would go into solution with repeated washings with water. Original 
samples were examined to determine the potash salt. Halite shows 
good cubic cleavage, refractive index is about 1,54, and is isotropic, 
Sylvite is also Isometric. Refractive index is 1,49, but difficult 
to distinguish optically from halite, 

Carnallite on the other hand is Orthorhombic, but crystals 


The optical method of identification was not sufficient for ' 

determination^ but the flame test definitely proved the existence of ' 
potassiimi, 

(4) lyrite and j^iiarcasite ! 

j 

Both are iHS- Q t- rop L io , and habit was the only criteria used. 

Special attention was not given to these two with immersion mounts, 
the binocular microscope and nitric acid tests were felt to be 
sufficient, 

|i 

(5) Chert |i 

Chert is a main constituent of most insoluble residues from j 

some limestones and dolomites. Small amounts were found in the residues ;j 
herein described. The type of chert found is invariably crypto- '| 

crystalline and exhibits aggregate polarisation. Index is low (1,537), 
Grains frequently fail to extinguish in any position. Color is a 
distinguishing feature - pale shades of blue, bluish white and mottled 
grains are common, 

;■ 

(6) Glauconite 


Glauconite is difficult to distinguish. It is usually green

■A.C-

or blackish yellow in color* Refractive index is 1.61* Birefringence 
is variable but aggregates commonly present low polarisation tints. 

Some varieties are pleochroic. Since glauconite is destroyed to a 
certain extent by HCl, it is difficult to say how much glauconite was 
present originally, and how great an error was made in determination, 

(7) Quartz 

Determination was based on low r e fract i ve inde x, slightly 
turbid shapeless grains, interference colors, low birefringence and 
s traight extinction on prismatic sections. In some samples using the 
binocular, beautiful clear six-sided crystals were observed, 

(8) Kaolin and Clay Minerals 

Kaolinite is difficult to determine and most clay minerals 
are indeterminable. 

Kaolin was determined mainly by the following pointsi 

Amorphous aggregates, translucent, mainly brown and white, 
with a pearly lustre. Refractive index less than 1.54 and birefringence 
low. It may be confused with muscovite but has a lower positive index, 
and no good interference figure. 

B, Chemica.1 

(1) Limestone and Dolomite 

The degree of effervescence produced when cold dilute HCl is 
added to a sample is often enough to distinguish the two. Limestone 
effervesces freely, dependent of course upon the amount of im.purity 
present, while dolomite effervesces but little. By carefully observing 
the beakers on idie hot plate, one can distinguish limestone and dolo¬ 
mite sam.ples quite readily.

(2) Anhydrite 


20 - 


It is insoluble in dilute HCl in the cold, but can be dis¬ 
solved in hot concentrated HCl. Ihe addition of warm water dissolves 
some of the anhydrite and gives a milky solution. 

(3) Pyrite and l!arcasite 

L^arcasite can be distinguished from P 3 rrite by the following 

method: 

Both are finely powdered and treated with hot concentrated 
nitric acid. In the case of pyrite, the sulphur present is oxidized 
and taken into solution as sulphiiric acid, while in the case of 
marcasite the sulphur is deposited in the free state. Most of the 
sulphide was found to be pyrite and could generally be distinguished 
I on habit alone. 

(4) on 

Any sample in which oil was suspected was powdered and panned 
on a watch glass with ether. After the ether evaporates a fine brown 
ring of oil is left, Som.e samples of residues were treated where oil 
was suspected, and positive results were obtained. 

(5) Potassium 

A small amount of the material was either dissolved in water, 
or placed on the loop of a clean platinum wire and held in an ordinary 
bunsen burner flame. A blue filter was used and the characteristic 
violet color was sufficient to distinguish potassium,

CHAPTER THREE I 

PART A - LITHOLOGY 


Stratigraphy 

I, General 
-— 

Beaverhills Lake area in central Alberta is underlain by Mes¬ 
ozoic, and Palaeozoic strata. In the core examined. Upper Cretaceous 
and Lower Cretaceous beds are present, the Lower Cretaceous resting 
unconformably upon beds Upper Devonian in age, Jurassic, Triassic, 
Permian and Carboniferous strata are apparently not present. The Upper 
part of the Upper Devonian has been eroded off. Strata, probably pre- 
Upper Devonian in age, are represented below another erosional imoon- 
formity, just above the salt series. Approximately 324 feet of salt 
is present in the core, 

Pre-Devonian strata could not be identified in the core. 

History of Previous Work 

1800 - David Thompson made a trip from Rocky Mountain House down the 
Saskatchewan river and noted the coal series, but his journal 
is impublished, 

1841 - The coal at Edmonton noted by Sir George Simpson. 

1858 - Sir James Hector (37) described the coal at Edmonton and that on 
the Red Deer River South of Edmonton. The first geological map 
of the area was made at this time. It shows little geology but 
was the first important map made of Western Canada, 

1873 - Dr, A. R. C. Selwyn (46), descended the Saskatchewan and recorded

in much greater detail the coal seams on this river. This is 
the first report by an officer of the Canadian Government, 

Selwyn first used the term "Edmonton” in referring to the strata [ 
containing coal seams in the vicinity of Edmonton, | 

J, B, Tyrrell published the first extensive geological map of | 

; i;', 

central Alberta, Other important workers were Dr, G, M, Dawson 
and R, G, McConnell, Tyrrell brought in the term "Edmonton 
Series" and used Dawson’s "Belly River”. He assumed that the m 


Lea Park formation was younger than the Belly River Series, The I 
report (54) contains a very complete description of the fauna !'*’■ 
found, described by Whiteaves, | 

J, A, Allan (l) surveyed the lorth Saskatchewan from Edmonton 
to North Battleford, He worked out the stratigraphic sequence, J 


pointed out that no prominent anticlinal fold existed in central j 


Alberta, named the Lea Park Formation and subdivided the Belly 


River Series into five units. 


S, E, Slipper (49) worked south of the River from Viking east 


to the provincial boundary in the same year. He also subdivided 
the Belly River series into five units, 

G, S. Hume mapped the Wainwright area (24), 

Detailed mapping by the Geological Siirvey of Canada, Workers 
were Rutherford, Warren, Crickmay, and Hage, Hume’s formational 
units of 1924 were retained. 


1941 - Hume and Hage published a detailed report of East-Central 
Alberta, (26),

1945 - A* W. Nauss (36) published a study of the Cretaceous in the 
Vermilion area. The Lower Cretaceous was divided into six 
members, and the names given were geographical. 

It should be pointed out that much of the foregoing work is not directly 
pertinent to the area tmder consideration. It is however, the only 
information available, apart from that held by private companies, and 
hence not available to the writer.

Description of Formations 
!♦ Pre-Devonian 

It is quite probable that the base of the Devonian was not 
reached at Eeaverhills No, 2 well. It is, however, possible that pre- 
Devonian beds may be present, Faimal evidence below the salt series 
is very meagre. 

Several wells in East-Central Alberta have penetrated into the 
Palaeozoic, 

In the Lloydminster-Wainwright area two wells have penetrated 
a considerable thickness of Palaeozoic rocks. Vermilion Consolidated 
Oils No, 15, Is.d, 2, sec. 12, tp, 49, rge, 6, W 4th was completed at 
4632 feet (66), The Conservation Board places the top of the Cambrian 
at 4145 feet. Salt occurs from 3481 to 3896 feet. The top of the 
Cambrian is placed at the contact of a dolomite series, with an under¬ 
lying glauconite sandstone, associated with which is maroon; and green 
claystone approximately 710 feet of beds of doubtful age overlie the 
Cambrian, 

At Montreal-Alberta No, 1,, l.s.d, 2, sec, 15, tp, 45, rge, 7, 
W 4th the top of the Palaeozoic was encountered at 2321 feet, (26), 
This well was abandoned at 4653 feet, or 2322 feet into the Palaeozoic 
(66). A decided change in lithology occurs below 2890 feet. The beds 
are light grey tC brown limestones, with some greenish and grey shales 
at 3200, 3550 to 3560, 3595 to 3607 and 3718 to 3742 feet. Anhydrite 
is present in grey limestones from 3080 to 3130 and at 3679 feet (26). 
Salt is reported in layers from 4102 to 4514 feet. Palaeontological 
evidence is however scarce, but the lower part with the salt may be

SilTorian* 

At Imperial Ribstone No, 1 sec. 5, tp. 45, rge, 1, W 4th, the 

top of the Palaeozoic was encountered at 2065 feet. About 1424 feet 

of Palaeozoic strata was drilled. Kindle identified fossils from this 

well as Upper Devonian in age (26), A partial list reads; 

Crinoid stems 
Atrypa reticularis 
Trematopora sp, 

Cyrtina cf, hamiltonensis 
Athyris sp, 

Nucula sp. 

No great changes in lithology were noted, and it was inferred 
that the whole Palaeozoic section penetrated was Devonian, Farther 
afield, in the McMurray area on Athabaska river, Precambrian beds have 
been penetrated by drilling (6), MacDonald (54) deduces that beds of 
Upper Ordovician, Middle Silurian, or Pre-Middle Silurian, liiddle Sil¬ 
urian, and Upper Devonian are represented. He contends that no Middle 
Devonian beds are present. The evidence presented is l arg - c , but it 
seems strange that no Middle Devonian rocks are present, 

II, The Devonian 

1, Lower Devonian 

To date Lower Devonian rocks have not been recognized in the 
Central Sea area of Alberta, Furthermore, Lower Devonian rocks are 
not present in the mountains, Warren (61), 

2. Middle Devonian 

Middle Devonian rocks are not known to outcrop in Alberta, on 
the plains or in the mountains (63), At one time some Middle Devonian 

beds were believed to be present (56); however, at present this opinion 
has been revised.

Mddle Devonian rocks do however outcrop in Manitoba (68), 
These beds were deposited by a Northern sea. Three Formations are 

present: Athyris fultonensis 

Cyrtina hamiltonensis 


Manitoba limestone 

Middle Devonian Winnipegosan dolomite 
Elm Point limestone 


Strincocephalus burtini 

Atrypa reticularis 
(variety A) 


Each has a definite faima. Kindle does not give thicknesses. 

In a well drilled Dauphin, Manitoba, SE, ^ sec, 14, tp, 24, 

Range 20 W 1st l/ler,, T/ickenden (67) reports the probable occurrence 
of 1/fiddle Devonian beds, A total thickness of 720 feet is assigned to 
the Devonian, but the thickness of Middle Devonian is indefinite. He 
states that; "the limestone represented by the sair^ples between 990 and 
1,010 feet in the Dauphin well may be the Elm Point limestone,” that 
is Middle Devonian, 

In the liafeking No. 5 Well; location, L.S. 12, Sec, 2, tp, 43, 
Range 26, W 1st Mer,, Devonian beds were identified by the presence 
of Atrypa, cf, reticularis (determined by Kindle), Top and bottom of 
the Devonian as found in the Dauphin well are not present in the l/fe.fe» 
king well (67), It is interesting to note that in the Dauphin well, 
among the ostracods a peculiar species of Octonaria is found, Ostracods 
occ\ir in Beaverhills No, 2 well at 5428 feet but have not been deter¬ 
mined as to species. 

Mddle Devonian rocks do ou tcrop on Great Slave Lake, and in 
the lower Mackenzie valley. The advent of war and the search for oil 

brought the "Canol Project”’ into prominence, Warren (62) has recently 
clarified the faunal horizons in the Devonian sections in the North,

The Middle DeTonian strata on Great Slave Lake are divided 
into three formations; 

The Slave Point Limestones , Grey shaly limestones, 200 feet thick, 
correlated with the !^ianitoba limestones . 

The Presqu*ile dolomites ^ Hard crystalline dolomites, dolomitic lime¬ 
stones, thin beds grey shaly limestone, 375 feet thick, and correlated 
with the Winnipegosan dolomites . 

The Pine Point limestones » Soft, grey, shaly limestones, blue to black 
thin-bedded hard limestones, grey to brown shaly limestones, 595 feet 
thick and correlated with the Elm Point limestones , (Warren 62), 

In the upper beds of the Slave Point, another species known as 
Hypothyris venustuja , occurs. It represents the very lowest beds of 
the Upper Devonian, 

The Middle Devonian strata of the Lower Mackenzie valley are 
also divided into three formations: 

The Beavertail limestone . Hard thick, and thin bitminous limestones 
with some shale partings 350 feet thick and correlated with the Slave 
Point limestone . 

The Ramparts limestones . Compact grey limestones. Stringocephalus bur - 
tini and other fossils; 250 feet thick and correlated with the Presqu* - 
ile dolomite. 

The Hare Indian River shales . Calcareous clay shales with thin seams 
of limestone. Grey-green color. Few fossils, 300 feet thick and 
correlated with the Pine Point limestone, Warren (62),

Minor additions and corrections to the above were: 

(1) A limestone bed near the base of the Fort C-reek shale (Upper 
Devonian)* It contains the Leiorhynchus castanea faima* Incl^ided in 
the Beaver tail limestone. 

(2) A shale bed is usually present about the middle of the Hay 
River limestone. Not named but Hume has used the term Leiorhynchus 
gone for the Hay River limestone below the shale bed. 

(3) On Athabanka River the Hay River shale becomes quite limy, and 
the name Watervsrays formation has been proposed for this limy facies. (57) 

Warren (62)^describes the spirifer, Itotinia sublineata , from 
the Fine Point limestone . A small Bartinia possibly sublineata was 
found in the Beaverhills No, 2 core at a depth of 5490 feet about 65 
feet below the base of the salt series. It is not certain -whether this 
horizon is Pine Point or Beavertail , but it is m.ost probably a Middle 
Devonian form. 

At Verbata No. 2 Well, Unity, Saskatchev/an, l.s.d. 7, sec. 24, 
tp. 41, R. 24. W 3rd Mer., about 915 feet of Middle Devonian beds are 
believed, to be present (71). These beds consist mainly of limestones 
dolomite and anhydrite and are correlated with the Ramparts limestones . 
Fossil determinations were made by Warren (71), Below 3215 feet, 
approxim.ately 440 feet of these beds are salt. Overlying the salt are 
dolomitic red beds . Below the salt Ordovician beds, probably correlat¬ 
ing with the Tyndal limestones, and about 334 feet thick occur. They 
were determined on the basis of the brachiopod Rhynchotrema capax . 

Cambrian beds are believed to be present below 4422 feet, with 
the base not reached.

Hume (70) believed that the salt at Vermilion Consolidated 
Oils Limited, Well No. 15, l,s,d, 6, sec, 12, tp, 49, R, 6, of the 
4th Meridian was Devonian in age, Ee based this on Charophyte spores 
found just below the salt. The salt beds are about 415 feet thick and 
! are overla,in by dolomitic red beds , 

! Charophyta oogonea, (not determined) are found just below the 

salt series at Beaverhills No, 2 well at a depth of 5428 feet. At 
shout the same depth as these plant are ostracods . Overlying the 

salt series are red and green shales . 

Willson (66) reports no Middle Devonian present in the Lloyd- 
minster area, although he states that with a gradual thinning to the 
West, some expression of their presence should be seen, 
j Admittedly the faunal evidence at Beaverhills No. 2 well is 

very meagre belovf the salt series. The writer would however assign 
to those beds below the red beds , and including the salt a Middle 
Devonian age. The thickness is 505 feet with the base not reached. 

The top is placed arbitrarily at the top of the ”red-green shale beds”, 
but there may be additional beds above this break. The break is felt 
to be not too important in an evaporite basin feature such as is be¬ 
lieved to have existed. In addition zones in the residues above the 
”red beds” - show that very small breaks were present. This is based 
on residues mainly of limonite, at the intervals: 

4594*-4609» 

4789»-4877» 

5072*-5082* 


Approximately 324 feet of rock salt is present. It is generally very

important. At the top of this series in the interval 5499»-5507», 



potash salt is bright-orange~red and gives a definite test for potas¬ 
sium, Near the top of the m.ain salt "'51G0*-5424« reddish tinged salt 
occurs. Samples taken show clearly the differential solubility of 
halite and carnallite. The potash salts being more soluble than halite 
are deposited last, and dissolve out of the salt readily to form 



irregular cavities, 

3, Upper Devonian 

Upper Devonian rocks presumably \mderlie younger strata over 
the whole of the Great Plains and Foothills from the Manitoba lowlands 
to the Rooky Mountains, Hume (1933), 

I 

I The great flood of seas into the Cordilleran trough did not 

i 

I take place till the beginning of Upper Devonian time. It was a wide 

I seaway extending from the Selkirks far to the East, Spme 3000 feet of 
predominantly limy sediments were deposited in the trough during Upper 
Devonian time, Warren (61), Outcrops in the inliers and motintains, 
and deep borings under the Plains areas have added inmiensely to our 
fund of knowledge of the Upper Devonian,

The Upper Devonian, especially in the southern plains of Alberta, 


shows similarities to the Montana section. The Conservation Board 
terminology is as follows s

The Jefferson Formation in Alberta is divided into two divisions: 

Jefferson dolomite 

Jefferson Group 

Waterways Formation 




Cook (14) terms the upper member i.e, the Jefferson dolomite - The ! 

Burdett beds . The black bituminous shales he calls the "Duvernay I 

Shale% "This black bittrniinous shale is widespread. It is present

Waterways Form^ation I 

^ 1 

Name ij 

The name was given by P, S. Warren in 1933.(57), From fossils | 

collected by J, A. Allan, and K. A. Clark, Warren assigned an Upper I 


Devonian Portage age to the formation. A partial list of the collection 
reads: 


Spirorbis omphaloides, Goldfuss 
Pugnax pugnus (Martin) 

Atrypa reticularis (Linn,) 

Cyrtina billingsi (Meek) 

Athyris angelica var. occidentalis (Ti/hiteaves) 

Lithology 


The thickness of the limestone and shales containing this 
Portage fauna is accurately known through the log of the salt well 
drilled at Mclfurray (2), A thickness of 405 feet of limestone and 
shale overlying gypsum beds is reported, with the upper boundary an 
erosion surface. 



I 






























35 - 


The formation is mainly massive buff liiriestone, commonly 
argillaceous, Warren correlates these beds with the Devonian beds at 
Peace Point and the Sim.pson Shale on the MacKenzie River (57), In 
addition he correlates the Waterways with part of the Jefferson form- 
ation of Montana, and with beds above and below the Blackface Mountain 
shale, (58), 

! At Beaverhills No, 2 well the Waterways consists of greenish- 

grey shaly limestones in part mottled, fossiliferous, with aiihydrite 
and dolomite beds. The greenish-grey calcareous shale facies are very 
persistent and typical of the Yfaterways, 

Above the Waterways formation lie a series of interbedded grey, 

and black shales. Cook (14) calls these the Duvernay bituminous shales. 

oH 

The bitumen from the insoluble residues gives quite a positive oth - er 
j test, A lithological ”'pick” would place the top of the Waterways at 
3996 and the base at 5052 feet. This means a thickness of 1056 feet. 

An insoluble residue ”pick" would place the top,at 4043 feet, - this 
means a thickness of 1009 feet. The latter is probably the best pick, 
Yfillson (66) gives a thickness of 955 feet, determined from V.C.O, 

No, 15 core log. 

At Imperial Duvernay No, 1, l.s.d, 6, sec, 50, tp. 55, R 11, 

W 4th Mer,, Cook (14) places the top of the Waterways at 2500, The 
black bituminous shales, greenish-grey shales above 2500 he would place 
in the ”Burdett ^ formation,

designate essentially all of the limestones which lie between the top 
of the Cambrian and the bottom of the Three Forks shales, Deiss (17). 

The type section is at Three Forks, Montana, and approximately 640 feet 
of massive black limestones with bands of laminated magnesim limestone 
are present. 

Lithology 

"The Jefferson at Three Forks, Montana consists of smoky, or 
chocolate-brown, granular dolomite, much of it having a peculiar 
brecciated appearance and weathering with a rough, pitted, gritty sur¬ 
face, Thin beds of lighter-colored denser limestone or shaly limestone, 
giving the forniation the appearance of heavy masonry. On fresh fracture 
the rock has a glistening appearance in some instances resinous; and it 
is further distinguished by a strong, peculiar, fetid odor which it 
emits when struck with a haijl^r”. Moore (72), 

It is bounded by Potlatch anhydrite above, and the limestones 
of the Waterways formation below. 

The Jefferson is correlated in part with the Upper Mnnewanka 
formation in the Banff area (55), However Warren (58) correlates the 
Upper Part of the Waterways with part of the Jefferson, Warren further 
states that the Jefferson limestone and the Three Forks shale corres¬ 
pond stratigraphically with the Ghost River formation and the whole of 
the Minnewanka limestone in the Banff section. 

In general the Minnewanka limestone contains two faunas: 

Spirifer whitneyi 
Spirifer Jasperensis 

The lower one is correlated by Warren with the Jefferson limestone

while the "whitneyi” fauna is placed in the Chemung, 

5he Palliser formation of the Moose Moimtain ar8% Alberta was 
named by Beach (7), It contains the "Spirifer whitneyi’*' fauna, and 
probably correlates with the Upper Mnnewanka in part. 

At Beaverhills No, 2 well nothing lithologically similar to 
typical Jefferson dolomite is found. Above the so-called "bitimiinous 
shales”', a long section of green shales, slightly calcareous was encoun¬ 
tered, They are particularly devoid of fossils. Unfortunately the 
interval from the top of the Cretaceous/bevonian contact was drilled 
and not cored, A description is included in this paper, but the writer 
has not seen the samples, and hesitates in making any conclusions. A 
few small brachiopods were found in the interval 3859*-3868* - which 
may be Lingula , otherv/ise the shales are barren. 

The writer is not sure, then, exactly where to place the top 
of the Wateirways formation. It is however a fact that Atrypa , either 
Beticularis , or more closely missouriensis , foimd in the core plus 
specimens of Tylothytis , indicate an Upper Devonian age. All that can 
be said is that part of the equivalent of the Upper Mnnewanka may be 
present, despite the fact that Spirifer whitneyi is not found in the 
core. 

If the top of the Waterways is picked at 4043 feet, this would 
give a thickness of some 871 feet of Upper Devonian beds above the 
YiTaterways. This is a total of 1880 feet for the Upper Devonian, and 
a grand total of 2386 feet for Upper and Mddle Devonian, with the base 
not reached.

Three Forks Forraation ' '•* 

--— , j ■■ 

Name i i 


Perry (73) named this formation in 1928 from well samples in 
the Kevin-Sunburst area in northern Montana, 

Potlatch Anhydrite Member 

Moore stated (72), that there was no evidence to show that 
the "black shale"i,e Exshaw should be separated from the Three Forks, 
Perry excluded the Exshaw, Today, the "Potlatch” is restricted to the 
anhydrite series alone. This series is about 275* thick in the 
Princess area and is massive white anhydrite, dolomite, and green 
claystones, 

I a*^d'isS 

I This member is not present at Beaverhills No, 2 wel^ having 

! probably eroded off. 

Green Shale Member 

Cook (14) has suggested the term "Grassy Lake” member. Its 
boundaries, where it occurs, are the anhydrite belovr, and the blacky 
fissil^Exshaw shale above, 

d*t€C/^ 

This m.ember is not present at Beaverhills No, 2 well h a vin g 
probably besri eroded off. 

Exshaw Shale 

Vfarren (60) named this formation in 1937, He assigned an Upper 
Devonian age to it, mainly on faunal evidence, especially on the basis 
of the ibmnonite Tornoceras, Furnival (20) believes that it may be Mss- 
issippian in part. It is a remarkably persistent member, very wide¬ 
spread, although it is never more than 50 feet thick. It affords a 
valuable marker in drilling operations, when it is present. 


































- 37 - 


This member is again not present at Beaverhills No* E well. 
lAssissippian 

Mssissippian beds are not present at Beaverhills No. 2 well. 
Pre«Lower Cretaceous 

Pennsylvanian, Permian, Triassic and Jurassic rocks are mainly 
absent imder the Plains area. They are not present at Beaverhills 
No, 2 well. 

The Detrital Zone 

The "chert-detrital zone”, occurs where Ifississippian rocks 
underlie Lower Cretaceous beds. At Beaverhills No. 2 well this zone 
is not present as such. Chert is mainly absent. The electrolog pick, 
places the "detrital zone” in the interval 3094-5142 feet. From the 
core this interval is represented, mainly by varying colors of silt- 
stones and shale, with some oil staining (3093/3102) feet. Small chert 
fragments are present but not abundant. In the intei-val (3135-3172) 
feet, maroon and green shales are present. The red beds are brecciated 
in part, the green is very kaolinitic. Ihite silty patches of highly 
altered feldspars are associated with some quartz. The contact with 
the calcareous shale below is not too definite, and the top of the 
limestone "pick” at 3172 is arbitrary. This zone is about 37 feet 
thick. These "red beds”, probably represent a doT/viiward leaching on 
an old erosional surface imder almost desert conditions of climate. 

The green beds are probably the ferrous equivalent of the ferric red 
beds. It is suggested that this zone is a result of erosion and de- 
composition of the top of the Upper Devonian and possibly beds 
Upper Devonian in age.

III, The Cretaceous 


1, Lower Cretaceous 

In the area under consideration Leaver Cretaceous rocks do not 
outcrop and it is known only by deep borings, 

Name 

Until Nauss, (36) proposed the term I'Jannville formation in 


i!' ^ 

‘f 


1945, it was simply referred to as the Lower Cretaceous, Nauss sub¬ 
divided the formation into 6 units, retaining McLearnb Mclkirray sand¬ 
stone, Other writers have used (Dina) for Mclvsurray, - see Willson (66), 
The members as given by Nauss, reading from top to bottom are; 


O’Sullivan 


Shale and salt and pepper 
sandstone.

Quartz sandstone. 

Tovell 

- 

Shale and salt and pepper

Islay 

- 

Quartz sandstone. 

Cummings 

- 

marine shale and sandstone. 

licitoray 

- 

Quartz sandstone. 

Total thickness is variable, from 205-645 feet, NauSi 


that: "these beds are lithologically distinct from any known formations 
of similar age in Western Canada, They differ from correlative beds 
in the Rocky Mountain district in containing near-shore quartz sands 
and on e thin mari ne sh ale member" . Hence he has proposed the term 
J/Jannville, 

The writer was unable to distinguish these members at Beaver- 


hills No, 2, although it may be quite possible to do so. Definitely 
the basal quartz sand is not present. For this reason the 6 terms 
























I 



39 - 


are not used, and hence the term Mannville can not be used* 

In the Wainwright-Lloydminster area the Lower Cretaceous is 
important econom.ically* The oil producing horizons occur here, mainly 
in the Wainwright mnmber. 

At Beaverhills No* 2 well the Lower Crej^taceous is about 569 
feet thick, and lies between conformable Upper Cre^taceous black shales 
and the top of the so-called "detrital zone"* If this zone is included 
then total thickness is 606 feet* The contact with the overlying 
Colorado shale is sharp, the uppermost "salt and pepper" sandstone 
member lies directly below typical grey to black, fissile, marine 
shales* The top is placed at 2566 feet* The beds consist of grey 
siltstones, hard, grey "salt and pepper", sandstones, coal, light 
brown oil stained sandstones, kaolinitic sandstones, limy sandstones 
I and dark grey shales* Plant fragments and carbonaceous materials are 
very abundant in the sandstones, and in some of the shales* 

In some of the sandstones, calcareous cementing is common, and 
decomposed feldspars yield yellowish and white specks* The core has 
a strong kaolinitic smell* Fossil evidence foimd is mainly plant re¬ 
mains - indeterminable and of little value* Fish fragments do occur 
in the interval 2602-2611 feet and shell fragments in the interval 
3016-3024 feet. 

If marine facies are present the writer is unable to state 
thicknesses or to place them correctly in the series* As previously 
stated Nauss recognized one marine facies in the lower part of the 
Mannville.

Coal occurs in the Lower Cretaceous in thin seams; 

/ 

2611-2620 feet, 0.5 coal - dirty. 

2637-2646 feet, 11 - O.S^coal and black shale. 

2664-2673 feet, 11 - 1.0"coal. 

These are the main horizons. Others occur in very thin bands, with 
black shale. The "pebble chert" horizon may have some representation 
at the top of the series, in the "salt and pepper" sandstones, but 
the true polished chert grains are not present in Beaverhills No. 2 
well.

2, The Upper Cretaceous 
(a) Colorado Formation 

( 

i As previously stated the first core examined by the writer 

i 

was the interval 2405-2414 feet. Above this approximately 108 feet of 
Alberta (Colorado) shale was dumped on the ground. This would place 
the first core taken in approximately the 2397-2406 feet, interval. 
Electrolog "picks" place the top of the Colorado at 1550. 

I This means at total of 1016 feet for the Colorado, including the Viking 
zone. 

Various terms are applied to this formation, but it is not the 
purpose of this paper to discuss them here. The writer will use 
"Colorado" henceforth. 

The Colorado is a series of dark grey to black, fissile, marine 
shales with two "white speck horizons". Silty sandstones occur in the 
Viking zone. At Beaverhills No, 2 this zone is about 80 feet thick. 

A fish scale horizon is also a good marker and "aragonite prisms". 


1 



probably Inoceramus, are encountered in drilling 





























- 41 




Above the top of the Lower Cretaceous there are approximately 
63 feet of black marine shales, and interbedded sandstones and shales 
with "aragonite prisms" and fish scales. Bentonite bands also occur 
in three places. They are thin less than 0,5 feet, lying between black 
and grey shales. Plant fragments also occur, and it may be that these 
beds are part of the Lower Cretaceous, Considerable divergence of 
opinion exists as to the age of these beds, Nauss (36), The writer 
however does not wish to express an opinion here. 

The "Viking sandstone”, at Beaverhills No, 2 is represented by 
about 80 feet of siltstones, sandstones and shale. The shales are 

paper thin in places and grey to black. The sandstones near the top 

contain som_e rounded black chert grains, and thin beds of bentonite 
not over 1,0 feet thick. 

The typical Viking sandstone occurs in the Viking area of 
Alberta_^where it is the big gas producer. 

Above the Viking zone lie the typical Colorado shales grey, 
to black with some dark grey siltstones and sandstones. Fossils are 

poor and only fish scales were found in the first core 2405-2414 feet. 

The "second white speck horizon" occurs at 2055 feet (electro- 
log) and samples were not seen by the writer. 

The white specks are believed by Sanderson (45) to have orig¬ 
inated in association with volcanic ash or bentonite. Other opinions 
are not stated here, but it is sufficient to say that they are remark¬ 
ably widespread, and good horizon markers, 

(b) The Lea Park Formation 

This formation was named by Allan in 1918 (l). Its total

thickness, knovm from well logs is betvreen 750 and 850 feet. It is 
largely grey marine shale. The base is marked by the "first speckled 
shale’^. The thickness at Beaverhills No. 2 well from electrolog 
information is given as 580 feet. No samples have been examined by 
the writer. 

(c) Bell^i^ River Series 

These are a series of fresh-water sandstones 8,nd marine shales. 
They lie below the Bearpaw and above the Lea Park formations, 

Allan (l) and Slipper (49) working independently in 1916 sub¬ 
divided the series into 5 units; 4 fresh-water and one marine unit. 
Different names were applied yet they are readily correlative. 

Nauss has further subdivided the series (36). This is done on 
the basis of two marine tongues. 

The writer has not seen the drilled samples from Beaverhills 
No, 2 and so nothing further will be said about the series. An electro¬ 
log pick gives the base at 970 feet i.e. top of the Lea Park, This 
may include some Bearpaw beds. The nomenclature of Hume and Hage (26) 
is used in the Table of Formations, 

IV. Pa.laeontology 

Only the faunas found in the Palaeozoic strata are dealt with 
here. Reading from top to bottom, the main horizons are: 

Drilled interval 3175-3542 feet 

Several limestones are noted as fossiliferous. No 

identifications were possible. 

Cored intervals: 






3859-3868 feet - Lingula type brachiopod fragmants. 
Not determinable.

Atrypa missouriensis 

The Atrypas from the Waterways formation proper, show remarkable 
resemblance in degree and character as those described by Stainbrook 
from the Cedar valley limestones of Iowa (62), The Atrypas at Beaver” 
hills No, 2 show m.ore affinities with those in the mountains in that 
the ribbing is very fine. The writer would say the species is more 
closely missouriensis than reticularis , 

Charophyta Oogonia 

These interesting fossil spores were found below the salt at 
5424 feet. Only the oogonia are preserved, the antheridia being 
nowhere found. It is believed that the plants lived in quiet, clear 
fresh”water bodies like ponds, ditches, and lakes. It was im.possible 
to tell whether the diagnostic spirals were vertical, sinistral or 
dextral, 

These oogonia are widely distributed in the Upper, and the Ivliddle 
Devonian of North America, 

Ostracods 

These were not determined, but it is interesting to note that 
they may be Middle Devonian in age, Hume (70),

CHAPTER FOUR 

PART B - INSOLUBLE RESIDUES 

I* Definition 

In this study the insoluble residues are those derived from 
the complete digestion in dilute Hydrochloric acid of limestone and 
dolomite cor© samples. 

The insoluble residue obtained being the material desired for 

stiidy. 

The material includes chert and quartz, anhydrite and gypsum, 
silt and shale, dolomolds and fossil casts, pyrite and limonite, and 
other accessory minerals, 

II, Importance of Insoluble Residues 

One of the many problems that confronts the geologist in the 
Plains areas of Alberta is the lack of sufficient faunal evidence in 
the carbonate rooks of the Palaeozoics. Isolated surface samples and 
corings or cuttings from bore-holes too frequently can not be definitely 
correlated as to stratigraphic position. This is particularly true in 
the Devonian rocks which offer a paucity of fossil evidence in many 
instances. 

In the Plains area these rocks can only be read from subsurface 

samples. 

Any study therefore, by which drill samples can be identified 
and correlated over long distances, is of inestimable value. 

The study is of economic importance mainly in oil field geology. 
In drilling metalliferous ore bodies in sedimentary rocks the minerals 














































79 - 


contained -where insoluble in weak acid, can be obser-^-ed more easily 
than in the original samples. 

Unconformities can be recognized. Structure can in many cases 
be determined. The character and nature of the rock are features that 
may be recognized. 

In Mssouri the study was made chiefly with reference to 
ground water supplies, with a view to recognition of formations and 
the determination of the depths to water bearing horizons. 

In areas -where siliceous carbonate rocks are drilled, residues 
are guides to caving of material from overlying formations. In Missouri 
caving was noted in many drill holes. This -was noted by association 
of insoluble materials representing -bwo formation in the residual 
fractions of the lo’wer formation. 

Residues were also used to check the accuracy and care of 
sampling. In general^, residues were sufficiently characteristic to 
identify a sample out of place with respect to formation. 

In strictly scientific studies residues show; the character 
of the rock and the different constituents; the character of the 
sediments that were deposited, the possible source of the material, 
and the conditions under which they were laid down. Organic matter 
can be easily detected, and this is especially important in the field 
of petroleum geology. Erosion surfaces have been recognized. Areas 
in -which sedimentation in basins has been a dominant process have been 
determined. 

The present study has been of necessity an exploratory one. 
Results are of interest primarily for the possibilities they suggest

rather than for conclusions that may be drawn* 

No long range correlations could feasibly be drawn and a 
great deal more work must be done before definite stateraents and 
conclusions are made* 

III, History of Previous Work 

The earliest research on insoluble residues was begun by 


It ir! 

I: 


H, S, McQueen in 1924 on the dolomites and doloEiitic limestones of 


ft 


Lov/er Ordovician age (Canadian of Ulrich) in Missouri. The results 
were incorporated and published in 1931 (35), The publication of 1931 
established methods of preparation, terminology and practical applicatiaajjl |; 
of insoluble residues for subsurface and surface correlation and 


identification. 


This paper was exhau s t e d several years ago, but a second paper 


is now in the process of publication. 

The writer obtained a library loan copy from the Geological 
Survey of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, 

Until almost 1940 subsequent workers visited Rolla, Missouri 
for firsthand acquaintance with McQueen^s methods and procedure. 
During the period 1924-1931, prominent workers in the field of insol- 


!i u 


uble residues were; 

Earl A, Trager (1920), (52). 

J, E. Lamarr (1926), (31), 

Charles E, Decker and Clifford A, Merrick (1928), (ReC), 
For the period (1931-1938); 

J, W. Ockerman (1931), (Bsf).

H. A. Ireland (1938)., (Ref). 

Early workers on sxirface beds were: 

H. G. Martin (1931), (R^). 

H. A. Ireland (1936), (Ref). 

After 1938 , many papers on subsurface and surface studies indicate 
the increased interest in and use of insoluble residues. 

The examination of residues for petroleum geology did not 
come into wide use until 1940, 

”3y 1946 , State geological surveys of Illinois, Indiana, 
Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and fexas 
had issued publications based wholly or in part on surface and sub¬ 
surface data from insoluble residues,” (28), 

Three publications based on subsurface residxie data have 
recently been issued by the United States Geological Survey, (Note: 
See reference list at end of chapter, — thoso - marked w i rth - a -gfee picko-^r) 
In 1946 a conference was called at Midland, Texas imder the 
chairmanship of H, A. Ireland for the purpose of standardizing 
Terminology for Insoluble Residues, (28), The most recent work in 
the writer*s possession is that of Samuel S, Goldich and E, Bruce 
Pamelee (1947), (21). 

Method of H, S, McQueen 

1. The quantity of original material used varied according to 
the amount available. In general, 25 to 30 gram samples were used. 

In some cases amounts no greater than 2 grams were used. The residue 
obtained, while small, could be determined successfully.

Yfhen samples were left too long on the sand bath, the mother liquor 
tended to become thick and gelatinous and to contain slender crystals li; 
of gypsum. This wa.s due to the sulphuric acid present in the HCl ij 

reacting with the limestone or dolomite, j'

4, In order to decrease the strong immediate reaction of the 
more freely effervescing limestones, these are treated in the cold 
and the acid was added very slowly, 

5, After all effervescence ceased, the beakers were removed 
from the sand bath. 


10, Ihen no further reaction was apparent the samples were again 
washed with water. This removed any soluble salts that would upon 
drying coat the residues, 

11. In some cases it was found necessary to add acid 3 times.

this being particularly true of fine grained or dense very siliceous 
dolomites* 

12, After the samples are thoroughly washed with water again to 
remove all traces of acid and soluble salts, they are placed on a sand 
bath and dried. They are then ready for examination. 

Samples of residues were filed in cork-stoppered vials labelled 
to correspond to the labelling on the original samples. 

Wooden trays measuring approximately 28 x 18 x 2 inches with 
wire screen bottom.s were used to handle the beakers. Sixty beakers 
could be handled at one time and one man could prepare as many as 
200 samples in 8 hours, The above should be carefully noted in any 
future work to be done, as any short-cut which will cut down the time 
element is to be desired, Ihe wire screenbottoms permitted rapid 
warming of a series, 

McQueen makes no mention of percentage of total residue; the 
study is totally qualitative. Other workers have found it advisable 
to include a quantitative step in their research, TTie writer used a 
modified form of McQueen’s technique but in essence it differs only 
slightly. 

A resume of other methods is given below, (See XVI) 

V, Other Methods 

Trager (52) proposed a method by which the percentage of sand, 
shale and limestone could be determined in an insoluble residue. The 
samples were centrifuged in water giving a resultant separation of 
the sand and shale fractions. 












































K'

Most workers are concerned only with a qualitative deter¬ 
mination* Recent workers have been more concerned with the quant¬ 
itative side of the problem 

Cheney (10) in correlating the Ellenburger in the subsurface 
of north-central Texas makes use of the total insoluble percentage* 
Goldich and Parmelee (2^1) used a quantitative procedure in 
conjunction with a chemical analysis. After gentle heating, the fines 
were decanted into a liter beaker which was filled with water and 
allowed to stand until the fine material settled. The clear water 
was then siphoned off, and the fines transferred to a weighed filter 
paper, washed and dried in an oven at 105°C. The combined weight of 
dried fines and coarser residue was then used to calculate total 
percentage residue* 

In addition they tabulated results of determined percentage 
insoluble residue, and compared it with calculated non carbonate part 
from chemical analyses* The results checked remarkably well. 

They also adopted a table for relative abi^indance of constit¬ 
uents of residue; 

Flood - more than 75^ 

Ab^mdant - 25 to 75^ 

Common - 1- to 25^ 

Rare - less than 10^ 

Present - only one grain noted. 

The writer wishes to retain this handy scale throughout the thesis. 
Another method, proposed by St* Clair (51), is the use of

acetic acid instead of hydrochloric acid. The author concludes that; 

(1) Mineral suites were more completely preserved, 

( 2 ) Dolocasts were more easily examined because the acid did not 
attack the dolomite crystals which support the silica cast, 

( 3 ) Digestion takes longer but the residue is cleaner because 
no gelatinovis material is formed. 

The writer found that acetic acid could not be used in the present 
study because of the amount of shale and impurities in the limestones. 

These then are the most modern methods with slight modifica¬ 
tions found by trial and error to best suit the rock suites being 
examined, 

VI, Detail of Method Used 

1, All sam-ples used v/ere approximately 20 grams. These 
samples were first washed to remove drilling mud and extraneous 
material, 

2, Samples were crushed and screened to plus 20 mesh. This 
increases the acid rock interface and speeds up the time of reaction. 
Crushing to finer particles, or flour is inadvisable as certain 
characteristics are apt to be destroyed. Some workers use gyratory 
crushers or roil crushers. This is probably the best procedure, as 
it takes a short time and little work is required. However various 
types of crushers have to be carefully cleaned after each sample is 
put through and in many cases the end product is too fine. 

The T/riter used a cast iron mortar and iron pestle loaned by 
the DepartiE.ent of Mining. Hand bucking is time consuming, but the 
samples obtained are clean and little screening is necessary.

3. Calculation of the percentage insoluble residue of the 
total sample was carried out only on the first 100 samples* To do 
this, the 250 cc beakers used were first carefully weighed, and their 
weights recorded, against their respective numbers. Approximately 
20 grams of sample is added to the dry beaker, weighed again and 
recorded against number of beaker and depth of sample. 



4, Cold water is added to each beaker containing a sample, 
and allowed to stand 1-3 minutes, Ihe clear liquid is decanted. This 
removes unnecessary soluble salts and some very fine muds, 

5, Chemically pure analytical grade HCl diluted 2:1 is added 
slowly to each beaker. The reaction is sometimes quite violent so a 
wash bottle was kept handy. The froth sometimes will spill out if 

not quenched. This is particularly true in the case of limestones 

or if the sample has been finely crushed, 

6 , Acid in excess is slowly added and the beakers allowed to 
stand for some time. This interval depends upon the character of the 
original rock. Very shaly limestones have a short time of reaction^ 
dolomites require much longer, repeated acid treatments and heating 
on the sand bath. It is quite apparent in this initial stage which 
samples are muddy, dolomitic, or fairly pure limestones. The writer 
made no discrimination and treated all sam.ples alike, 

7, After no further reaction is apparent all the beakers are 
filled with cold water, ''When the liquor becomes clear it is carefully 
decanted and more water added. This step is repeated three times.

8 . More acid is added. Some samples show no reaction while 
others, particnlarly good limestones and dolomites, react violently, 

9, The beakers are then placed on a sand or steam bath and 
heated to almost but not quite boiling point. The writer used a steam 
bath. In a sand bath, fine sand may get into the beakers and give a 
misleading result. 

The time for this step varies. Some fine mud samples can be 
removed almost immediately. Dolomites require much longer times. 

They were usually left during the day and allowed to settle in the 
cold overnight. 

Time on the hot-plate should be carefully watched. If it is 
too long, gypsum crystals form due to the reaction between the sulph¬ 
uric acid present in the hydrochloric acid and the calcium ions in 
solution. The liquor tends to become thick and gelatinous. In 
addition glauconite tends to break down, as does some pyrite. This 
is apparent in the greenish yellow mother liquors above the residues, 

10, 1/Vhen reaction is definitely complete (as tested by stirring 
and observation), the beakers are allowed to stand until the mother 
liquor is clear. They are then carefully decanted and washed with 
cold water until the last trace of acid is gone, 

11, Beakers are placed on a slow hot-plate and dried thoroughly. 
The writer allowed the beakers to stand on a steaui register overnight, 

12, After completely dried and cooled off, beakers and contents 
are re-weighed. The percentage residue of the total sample is then 
readily calculable, from previous data recorded.

13* Samples are then placed in carefully labelled glass 
vials, with screw top stoppers* These vials were then filed in 
specially constructed light plywood trays* The trays were designed 
to hold 100 bottles in an upright position* They measure 11 inches 
by 11 inches by 3 inches in depth* Three such trays were prepared* 

14* The samples are then ready for examination* 

The writer recognizes the fact that this method of obtaining 
the percentage of insoluble residues does not make for complete 
accuracy* A more complete result would incorporate the use of filter 
procedures* However it was felt that due to the length of tim.e re¬ 
quired such a procedure could not be embarked upon* 

At this point the writer wishes to stress a few points that 
may be of help to future workers; 

1. Sampling at 5-foot intervals is probably the best, 

2* The use of trays capable of holding 60 or more beakers 
obviates individual handling of beakers and cuts down time* 

3, Make up at least one gallon of acid at a time, and use 
in a wash bottle set-up* 

4, Do not allow time on hot-plate to be so long as to produce 
the formation of gypsum crystals* 

5, Use a standard color scheme* 

6 * Adhere to standard terminology for Insoluble Residues (28) 
VII* Examination of Residues 

The residues were first examined by eye* A description was 
made noting color, texture, specific gravity, percent residue of total 
composition fossil casts, dolomolds, and any other special structures

or characteristics. 

The next step was examination under a wide field low power 
Bausch and Lomb binocular microscope, having a maximum magnification 
X 45. They were examined in the dry state and then because of their 
extremely muddy character generally, they were washed with water and 
dried. The writer foimd that fine silt and muds mask the true char- 
I acter of these residues and so they were carefully "panned” on a watch 
glass, dried and re-examined. 

In a few cases it was necessary to add more HCl and get rid 
j of siTiall particles of carbonate, generally the technique had been good, 
and these were only isolated cases, 

l/?here complete identification was necessary, immersion mounts 
were made and the material examined with a standard petrographic 
microscope. 

Finally, interesting saiaples were marked for future photo-

VIII, Types of Residues 
(a) General 

Throughout the literature extant the predominance of chert as 
a constituent of the insoluble residues is very marked. The chert is 
of many distinct types and variations. These variations are of such 
a nature and so restricted as to occurrence that they indicate forma- 
tional units and may be used as a basis in correlative study. (35), 

Next in importance to the chert content is the sand content 

of the residues. It generally varies from extremely fine, angular, 
well cemented grains, to coarse, roimded, and frosted grains. McQueen

in his work (35) found that Upper Cambrian sands exhibited definite 
characteristics in contrast to Lower Ordovician sands. 

Shale predominates in certain formations. It varies from 
soft, waxy, to porous or dense, micaceous fragments, but shows suf¬ 
ficient distinctions that each formation may be recognized. In the 
absence of chert, shale m-a 3 > ’ be used quite readily for the purpose of 
correlation . 

In many formations, clay, and silt fractions, are common. In 
most cases they do exhibit certain definite characteristics, and in 
some instances they have been sufficiently diagnostic to be of value. 

In this work, these fractions predominate, and do form definite zones, 
but they also mask the true nature of the residues. In order to get 
a better picture, the writer’‘panned'^ off these undesirable fractions. 

Other materials present are the undissolved heavy minerals 
and other accessory minerals as; Pyrite, 1/jarcasite, Ilagnetite, Bitumen, 
Fluorite, Gypsum, Anhydrite, 

The most striking features are, however, the casts or impres¬ 
sions of dolomite crystals preserved in the chert, shale, glauconite, 
pyrite and limonite, McQueen proposed and has used the term Dolocasts , 
This term has been changed by Ireland et al (28) to Dolomold , This 
is defined in Appendix B and the writer proposes to use it throughout 
this work, 

Dolomolds vary in size and shape but serve to identify the 
various forrri.ations in -which they occur. They are highly developed 
in cherts from good dolomites, McQueen found this particularly true 
in the Ozarkian system of Ulrich and to a lesser extent from the cherts

- 91 - 

of the Lovrer Ordovician (Canadian), 

Dolomolds have been foimd only in the insoluble residues from 
dolomites, and have not been foimd in limestone residues (35), 

The occurrence of dolomolds is an expression of the process 
of silicification perhaps dependent to some extent on the size of the 
original dolomite crystals. The formation of the dolomolds is the 
result of the deposition of silica in the interstices between the 
dolomite crystals. 

In some cases interstitial material is in part replaced. This 
replacement is often shown by the occurrence of dolomoldic chert at, 
or near unconformable contacts, or fonnation boundaries, 

Dolomolds are also present in shale, glauconite and pyrite, 
McQueen notes and stresses the fact that dolomolds first appear 
in the Upper Cambrian series, in the Ozark region of Missouri where 
they are restricted to shale, glauconite and pyrite in the Bonneterre 
formation. 

Another important feature of residues of certain formations 
are siliceous oolites. Their occurrence is particularly marked at or 
near contacts of dolomite, sandy dolomite and sandstone or along 
formational or intra-fomiational boundaries. 

Two types of oolites are noted: 

(1) Apparently a replacement by silica of the dolomitic oolite, 
occurring in a dolomitic matrix, 

(2) The second type is found commonly in sandy dolomite or 
sandstone. Secondary silica appears to have replaced the dolomitic 
filling, then coated the grains of sand, in some cases completely

Textures of Residues 


Goldich and Parmelee (21) used the following scale of grain 
size limits: 


Microgranular 
Very fine-grained 
Fine-grained 
Mediiim-grained 
Coarse-grained 


Less than 0.05 mm, 
0.05 - 0.2 mm. 

0.2 - 0.6 mm. 

0.6 - 1,2 mm. 


Greater than 1.2

If 


The writer attempted to use this handy scale as much as possible. 
It falls short however in differentiating between silts and clays. Un- 
less the residue is "panned" it is difficult to tell grain size. Clays 

■II 

usually malce up into cakes. Coarse material is generally not present ;i 

I 

in the residues. Microgranular textures predominate. Generally, the lit 

smallest residues give best textural and structural features, TChere [ 

the scale could not be used, the writer applied other descriptive 
terms. Large grains were usually measured directly, 

X. Residue Zones 


The zones are given as they occur. Their importance is 
questionable; the majority probably do not constitute zones , The 
following changes are apparent hov/ever and further study may reveal 
similarities. The table which follows gives the zone, the original 


rock type as it was logged, and in the third column what it probably 
should have been logged as.

XI# Correlative Value of Residues ^ 

It is hoped that some of the zones may have a correlative 
value. The writer had no access to other cores fairly close to 
Beaverhills No, 2 well. Presently being drilled in Lsd 9-18-50-18 w 
4th, is Imperial Tofield Ho, 1, Depth at April 2, 1948 is 3801 feet. 
This would make an interesting study as the well is located only about 
6 miles from Beaverhills Ho, 2, Sloss and Humblin (50) state: "Recog¬ 
nition of zones may not however be expected to extend beyond 50-100 
miles. 

The results were at first disappointing - when so much "mud" 
was encountered in the residues. However a negative result in some 
cases often has as much value as a positive one. 

The writer feels that "dolomolds"' are not too important in 
this one area, and although chert is not predominant it is proper that 
this should be so, 

XII, Photographs of Residues 

The main bulk of the photographs taken are included in 
Appendix A, Scattered throughout the manuscript are a few photographs 
illustrating some interesting features. 

Photographs are divided into three sections: 

Section (l) - Photographs of Residues - Natural Size, 

Section (2) - Photomicrography - Binocular Microscope, 

Section (3) - Photomicrography - Petrographic Microscope, 

The pictures taken show quite clearly that those in section (3) 

are the best. Textural features, dolomolds and fossil casts come up 
very well. Blurred photographs, and poor focus are not the fault of 
























102 - 


the equipment, rather the writer*s inexperience. 

Two cameras were used in this work. For Set (1) - a Certo 
(German Make) f 6,8 model, having an adjustable bellows and a ground 
glass screen, gave good results. Sets (2) and (3) were taken with an 
Exakta f3,5, 35 mm, reflex model made by Jhogee, Dresden, Germany, and 
good results were obtained. 

Both cameras were kindly loaned by fellow students. 

The set-up for (l) was essentially simple. The camera was 
rigidly fixed to a board against a shelf at a convenient distance 
above the material to be photographed. The bellows were extended to 
proper focus, the film pack substituted for the screen and the picture 
taken at the approximated time. Sufficient illumination was provided 
by two Burton spot lamps. The work was carried out in a darkroom to 
ue% out any possible stray light. 

The set-up for sections (2) and (3) is also quite simple, A 
universal head tripod was firmly fixed above the microscope and the 
camera screwed into place. Some workers remove one ocular and the 
camera lens, and provide a tube which screws into the camera and fits 
inside the binocular tube. The writer left both camera lens and ocular 
in place, and arranged the height of the apparatus so that the ocular 
fitted just inside the camera lens. The Exakta is ideal in this respect 
and no coxmecting tube is necessary. Focussing is done by the hand 
wheel or fine adjustment on the microscope, while observing the image 
on the reflex lens on the camera. Illumination was provided by two 
Burton spot lamps for sections (l) and (2) and one only for section (3),

Samples were photographed against both black and white backgrounds. 

In section (3) the petrographic microscope was substituted for the 
binocular microscope and immersion mounts photographed in plain light 
and crossed nicols. All photographs in section (3) were made using 
the medium power x 100, A standard light meter was made use of in all 
cases. The "jirnibo” prints from the 35 mm, film gave an enlargement 
of approximately 10 times.

XrV. SiJinmary and Conclusions of Insoluble Residue Research ^ 

Methods of technique haTe been discussed. The method used 
was outlined.a nd several hint 8 - added . Several conclusions have been 
arrived at, and some previously mentioned. The following is a brief 
review; 

1. Residues must be treated and examined in complete suites. 
Nothing is gained by "picked samples” being examined. 

2. Silts and clays should be "panned” but not discarded in areas 
such as the one studied. Here the silts and clays are almost all one 
has to work with. 

3. The binocular microscope must g o - h a nd « in-g 3rQve with the 
petrographic microscope, otherwise too much guessing is done. 

4. F\irther correlation from nearby wells should be done, and 
then the distance extended. 

5. A great many more samples should be treated at one time. 

6. Five-^ot sampling is good, but in important zones, it should 
probably be at 1-foot intervals. 

X?, The Use of "Mlneralight” in Examining Core Sampl es 

The technique, the results obtained, and the relative value of 
ultra-violet light examination are described in an extract of a letter 
to M. B. B. Crockford flom C. D. Newmarch, Department of Mnes, 
Victoria, B.C,, January 17, 1948. Mr. Crockford kindly passed this 
information on to the writer and ably assisted in the "Mineralight” 
work. 

Technique (a) 

The work was carried out at night in a dark room with a quartz- 
tube ^*Mineralight” loaned by I'Er. J. A, Kelso, and purchased from Cave 




















- 130 




and Company, Vancouver, B.C, It is iir.portant that the worker use 
goggles or spectacles , otherwise even reflected ultra-violet light | 

mil produce a painful damage to the eyes* Plain glasses are sufficient 
to ensure complete protection from all injurious effects. 

The original cuttings were handled dry and ICO or more may he |j|! 
set out on slips of paper and examined at one time. An ordinary desk !| 
lamp was kept handy so that it could be switched on quickly to make 
sure that extraneous material, (e.g, oil) was not fluorescing and I 

giving a false picture, Sam.ples are gone over verj'' rapidly and one “[] 

need only record, the color of fltiorescence, intensity of fluorescence, iP 
and possibly the percentage of sample fluorescing. 

The advantage of tiEie spent on samples as compared with insol¬ 
uble residue work is a big factor, j 

(b) Results Obtained | 

■Generally results were disappointing but these points are noted: [ 

i( [' 

1, Anhydrite zones fluoresce pinkish usually, h 

2, Fossils usually fluoresce brilliantly (due to phosphatio tii 
content). 


3, Dolomite zones do give a change of color, but this inform¬ 
ation is too meagre to do anything with. 

Results are noted as colors in the Insoluble Residue Log, 

(c) Relative Value 

The writer was confined to one well core and hence no cor¬ 
relations could be attempted. It is felt however that insoluble res¬ 
idue work would have to be done first, and then possibly "Mineralight” 
work as a follow-up and quick check.

CHAPTER FIVE 

CQNCLUSIOH 

I, Suaranary of Geological Events 

It is believed that the Palaeozoic formations present at 
' Beaverhills No* 2 well were deposited in a fairly shallovf, muddy sea, 
where from time to time evaporite basins and lagoons were present* 

After the shales, dolomites and salt beds were deposited the sea 
withdrew and erosion and downward leaching of the beds ensued under 
almost desert conditions. These stages were progressive, but less and 
less persistent. The seas then deposited the muds and limestones 
until possibly the close of Palaeozoic tim.e, A protracted period of 
erosion ensued. Post Devonian rocks which had probably been deposited • 
were removed. In Lower Cretaceous time this erosion was brought to 
a close by events which probably began in Aptian time. The continental : 
beds of the Lower Cretaceous were deposited with possibly marine 
tongues from the West, 

Willson (66) believes that the source of the quartz, and chert 
may have been the Pre«Cambrian Athabaska sandstone. 

These quartz sands do not extend west of Vermilion, 

In Upper Colorado time marine conditions prevailed again. The 
Viking sandstone, or siltstone as present in Beaverhills No, 2 well, 
Warren (63) believes may be correlatable with the Dunvegan sandstone 
of the Peace River section. 

The "red beds” above the salt are a feature that is found from 
Norman Wells in the North to Dakota in the South,

The most difficult thing to explain is the great thickness of 
muddy limestones in the Devonian, The persistence of anhydrite is 
also a remarkable feature, A great deal of loose terminology is used 
for the beds above the Waterwa.ys, They are silty, and shovild not be 
termed dolomites. This is quite apparent in the Insoluble Residues, 
Another peculiar thing is that animals could live in such a 
heavy concentration of salt, Brachiopods were found at 5490 feet in 
dolomite, with salt crystals, 

II, General Conclusion s 

1, It is believed that the beds below the ”red beds'^ 5052 feet, 
to the bottom of the hole 5558 feet and including 324 feet of salt 
are Mddle Devonian in age, 

2, ITo true thickness is assigned to the Waterways, it may 
include a part of 870 feet of beds which Cook (14) would ascribe to 
the "Burdett”, i,e, the top of the Jefferson, This means a total 
thickness of 870, and 1009 feet or 1879 feet, 

3, Chert is mainly absent in the residues, 

4, Silt is a feature of the top of the Devonian, 

5, The Middle Devonian - Upper Devonian "red bed” break is an 
arbitrary one, 

6, Although residues give negative results, it is felt that much 
more work should be done in order to get a more complete picture of 
the Palaeozoics under the Plains of Alberta. 

7, The ”authigenic quiartz zone”, at the bottom, of the well may 
be very important. It may indicate a Pre-lviiddle Devonian series. The 
writer does not wish to say vdiat age this series may be.

Appendix B 


Terminology For Insoluble Residues 


r 













(i) 


Appen.dix 3^ 

Terminology for Insoluble Residues 

For the most part terms used follow the precedent of the 
Lfissouri Geological Survey, but certain modifications were made by 
Ireland et al (28), 

Significantchanges arej 

"Dolomoldic’^ for ”dolocastic’^. 

’’Granular” for ’’crystalline”, 

’’Lacy” is restricted to fragments with irregular openings, 

’’Skeletal” is restricted to fragments with rliombohedral 
openings. 

This terminology is based on description, not genesis, because 
the genesis of many constituents is unlaio^ra._,v3gue_, or controversial. 
Some residues called ’’siliceous residues”', should not be so designated. 
Residues such as glauconite, pyrite, shale fragments, iron pellets, 
sphalerite, anhydrite and gypsum are not siliceous. 

The following is a summary of the outline as presented by 
Ireland et al; 

(1) Major constituents are grouped under headings of quarts, 
chert, argillaceous material, arenaceous material, an¬ 
hydrite, gypsum, and accessory minerals and other 
constituents, 

(2) A term is defined the first time it appears in the 

outline, 

(3) First-order headings are nouns, and subheads are 
descriptive adjectives, 

(4) Multiple stibheads give detailed descriptions 

(5) Many types are given a place although their existence 
has not been corxfirmed. 

















(ii) 


(6) Each term is intended to be clear-cut, but since types 
grade into others, then there may not be an adequate 
"pigeon-hole” for that t 3 rpe, 

(7) Quartz and chert are separated^ the terms crystalline and 
vitreous are eliminated* All clear quartz is either 
euhedral, subhedral or anhedral, Drusy quartz - subhedral. 

(8) Granular is put in place of crystalline* 

(9) "Smooth” is applied to the 3 types of chert. It is sub¬ 

divided into chaloedonic, ordinary and porcelajaeous, 
"Chalcedonic" includes all vitreous milky and transparent 
chert. 

The terms given below are exact ly as defined by Ireland et al. 
The original outline is followed but it is essentially a skeleton, only 
those terms applicable to the present work being included, 

I# Quartz ; Ordinarily clear colorless quartz, not detrital. 


A, Euhedra l; Doubly terminated crystals; unattached. ; 

B, Sixbhedral: Crystal forms partially developed. 

1, Loose: Individual fragments separated from former attachment. = 

2, Drusy: Clusters or aggregates of crystals; generally i| 

incrustations. J 

3, Granulated: Grains or granules partially cemented or loosely 

aggregated;saccharoidal; grade from angular to 1 

drusy; fine to coarse; particle rarely larger : 
than 0,5 mm, in diameter, 

(a) Fine: 

(1) Unmodified: Residue uniform with no modifying ; 

characteristcs, 

i 

s 

(2) Lacy: Residues with irregular openir^s in which the i 

constituent material comprises less than 25^ j 
of the volimie of the fragment, \ 

(3) Drusy: Incrusted with subhedral quartz, I 

(4) Dolomoldic: Containing dolomolds, (Dolom.olds are I 

rhombohedral openings in an insoluble | 

residue. Term, dolom^oldic is used for 
same feature that McQueen called Dolo- i 
castic.) ; 












(■ 




(iii) 


(a) Skeletal with dolomolds: Residues with rhombo- 
hedral openings in which constituent material 
comprises less than 25 % of volume of fragment. 
Openings vary from microscopic to megascopic, 

(b) Abundant dolomolds: Residues with rhombohedral 
openings with constituent material comprising 
from 25 %> to 75 %> of the volume of fragment. Open¬ 
ings vary from microscopic to megascopic, 

(c) Scattered dolomolds: Residues having rhombo- 
hedral openings in which constituent material 
comprises more than 75 % of volume of fragment. 
Openings vary from, m.icroscopic to megascopic, 

(5) Dolomorphic: Used for describing insoluble residues 

where there has been replacement or 
alteration of dolom.ite or calcite by 
insoluble mineral which assumes crystal 
form of the soluble mineral, thus fill¬ 
ing a dolom.oldic cavity. Dolomorphic 
describes conditions but does not put 
new meaning to obsolete word, "dolocast- 
ic”. 

(6) Oolitic: Containing eoliths, Ooliths as applied to 

insoluble residues are spheroidal bodies with 
nucleus or central mass enclosed by one or 
m.ore surrounding layers of same or different 
m.aterial. Ooliths are generally less than 
1,0 mm., in diameter. Those larger than 2,0 mm, 
in diameter are called pisoliths. 

(7) Oomoldic: Residue containing oomolds which are spher¬ 

oidal openings representing former presence 
of ooliths, 

b. Coarse: The headings (l) - (?) apply here as well, 

C, Anliedral: Ho crystal form developed. The headings 1,2,5, with 
their divisions apply here as well. 

Cryptocrystalline varieties of quartz regardless of color| 
composed mainly of petrographically microscopic fibers of 
chalcedony and / or quartz particles whose outlines range 
from easily resolvable to non-resolvable with binocular 
microscope at magnifications ordinarily used by petroleum 
geologists. Particles rarely exceed 0.5 mm, in diam.eter.

B, Granular ; Compact; homogeneous; composed of distinguishable rel¬ 

atively uniform-sized grains, granules or druses; un¬ 
even or rough surface fracture; dull to glimmiering 
luster; hard to soft; may appear saccharoidal, (This

I The headings Fine and Coarse, with their respective sub-headings 

unmodified to fossiliferous apply here, 

C, Chalky: Uneven or rough fracture surface; coiimionly dull or earthy 

in many cases; soft to hard; may be finely porous;
