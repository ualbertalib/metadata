COLCHIC INS-INDUCED TETRAPLQIDY IN VEGETABLES 


J. F. Carmichael 


INTRODUCTION 

Dr. A. W. S. Hunter (£0) says, "Colchicine has recently been very much 
in the nevus because of the importance it has assumed in plant breeding, but 
many people do not have a clear understanding of what it does for the plant 
breeder. The effect induced by colchicine is not new. It has occurred 
many times in nature, (according to Muntzing more than half of all 
angiosperms found in nature are polyploids (7)) but nature is not in a 
fturry and is content to wait for the one chance in many millions that such 
an event will occur. Man is impatient and in searching for a chemical 
that would speed up this natural process he found colchicine and made of 
it an invaluable tool." 

L. F. Earl (14) goes so far as to say it may give humans control 
over plant evolution, accomplishments already having been made which might 
have taken nature 5,000 years to evolve* A. F. Blakeslee (2) states that 
with' the colchicine method of evolution we now have an opportunity to make 
new species to order. "We now no longer have to wait for ages for the 
chance hybridization between species and the later rare spontaneous 
doubling of their chromosomes in order to secure much superior varieties." 

Many successful results in inducing polyploidy in plants by colchicine 
treatments, in the brief time since the inception of this technique in 
1937, support the above statements. Moreover, so frequently have these 

plants been shown to have desirable characteristics associated with their

polyploidy that we find full justification for the profound interest in 
colchicine experiments that has been aroused among plant breeders and 
laymen over the whole world* The fact that the technique of applying 
the drug has proven to be comparatively simple may also have contributed to 
this interest. 

It may be well at this time to describe briefly what is meant by 
polyploidy. Dermen (7) defines it thusJy: "In both animals and plants 
a numerical change of chromosomes involving an addition of at least one 
set of chromosomes (a basic set, or a genom, or 1 X) is termed polyploidy; 
and plants with one or more extra sets of chromosomes in addition to the 
two sets (2X or diploid number) normally present in somatic tissues are 
recognized as polyploids." 

Colchicine is a yellow, crystaline, alkaloid chemical, readily 
soluble in water and very highly poisonous in nature. It is extracted 
from the seeds and corms of the autumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale) which 
grows abundantly in the Mediterranean countries. It is manufactured 
mainly in laboratories in France and is available in Canada at about 
$30.00 per ounce. An interesting point to note is the fact that the 
autumn crocus itself is readily affected by treatment with colchicine, 
just as other plants are affected. 

HISTORICAL (2,7) 

Colchicine has been known for ages, as it was used 2,500 years 
ago in the treatment of gout by the ancient G-reeks, for which purpose 
it is yet the most effective remedy, even though the medicos cannot 
explain how it does it.

However, the origin of the use of colchicine as a plant poly- 
pleidizing agent is very recent and dates back only to 1934 when 
Professor Dustin at Brussels reported its action in arresting nuclear 
divisions. Blakeslee and Avery (3) of New York were the first tc be 
successful in inducing polyploidy (1937) although Nebel and Puttie (25) 
of New York achieved success at approximately the same time. Dr. 

Blakeslee f s first work was on a weed while the Nebel experiments were 
cn marigolds and snapdragons. 

BASIC CYTOLOGICAL EFFECT OF COLCHICINE (7, 15, 16, 22, 25, 36) 

The basic effect of colchicine when applied to meristematic tissue 
is the prevention of the anaphase of cell division (mitosis.). That is to 
say, the chromosomes split to form sister halves while in the metaphase or 
plate stage, but these sister chromosomes do not migrate to the poles of 
the cell (anaphase) on account of the colchicine preventing formation of 
the fibre strands that ordinarly draw the chromosomes to the poles. 

Crdinarly, when anaphase C otn /?? es?ce s , a division wall bep/rrs 

to appear at the equatorial region of the cell, eventually resulting in 
two daughter cells. With colchicine, since anaphase is prevented entirely, 
no new division wall is laid down.«±4J3SP. The remainder of the cell division 
process continues at its regular pace and eventually the doubled number of 
chromosomes round up to fofTana nucleus and the cell is then tetraploid. 

This effect is continuous, the tetraploidy going on to octoploidy 
and octoploidy to 16-ploidy, etc., as long as the colchicine concentration 
in the cell is strong enough and will eventually result in the death of 
the cell. If the colchicine is removed from the cell after causing the

first doubling, the chromosomes will then separate normally again, go 
through anaphase and produce daughter cells which are doubled in 
chromosome number. The size of the affected cell is usually found to be 
proportionate to the degree of polyploidy. 

?:0R?H0L0GICAL EFFECTS OF COLCHICINE (1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 16, 20, 33) 

Plants which are polyploids by colchicine induction are commonly 
larger, have thicker stems of greater height, thicker, and relatively 
shorter and broader leaves and fruits, much larger flowers, and seeds 
of greater size than normal ones. Leaves are often more deeply and 
profusely serrated. Pollen grains are larger, and stomata are larger 
and fewer per unit of area. These two characteristics* are frequently 
used in identifying doubled plants. Actual chromosome examination and 
counts are necessary for proof of doubling. 

However, exceptions to many of the above effects are frequently 
encountered as changes depend upon the original chromosomal and genic 
makeup of the species itself. Some plants when doubled, or induced to 
further polyploidy, are superior in general characteristics for their 
usual use, some show very little difference, and others are definitely 
inferior. These latter are probably species which have reached their 
most favourable physiological balance as a result of natural chromosome- 
doubling and any further chromosome increase leads to crowding and 
mechanical complications, thus swinging the balance in the wrong direction. 
In general, better results from colchicine treatment will probably be 
obtained from plants with a low chromosome number. 

G’Mara (27) found that the hypertropjiy which generally results in

growing regions that have been subjected to colchicine for a considerable 
time did not involve the meristem but rather the region of elongation. 

In this region growth is primarily by enlargment rather than by cell 
division. Thus colchicine must have an effect on the growth of the cell 
itself, more than simply causing an increase in the number of chromosomes 
within the cell. 

OTHhH EFFECTS r? COLCHICINE 

Besides the above morphological changes in plants through induced 
polyploidy, there are often qualitative changes as well. These may 
include intensification or widened range of flower color, increase in 
perfume content, or content of oil, sugar, drug, rubber, vitamin, nitrogen, 
protein or other compounds. Many of these have been reported. (7, 14, 18, 
20, 21, 29, 30, 31). 

Morphological and qualitative changes following polyploidy induction 
are net the only effects which colchicine treatment has on plants. Induced 
polyploids are usually more or less sterile, the degree depending upon 
whether or not the affected plant is an autopolyploid (resulting from 
treatment of a species) or an allopolyploid (resulting from treatment of 
a hybrid) and upon the original chromosomal and generic makeup. (7, 15, 33, 
36). The sterility may be correlated with the amount of multiple pairing 
in some chromosomes, resulting in complications in normal procedures (7). 
This is especially true of autopolyploids. In the case of allopolyploids 
(amphidiploids) they are usually much more fertile than the original hybrid, 
and herein lies one of the most important uses of colchicine in plant 
breeding. (5, 7, 13, 20, 28, 32).

Eigsti (15) states, "The frequency of chromosomal breakage is higher 
in treated material, which indicates that colchicine induces variations 
other than polyploid changes." Each such chromosome breakage would result 
in a mutation, thus giving rise to new types from treated material. Cases 
of this kind are found very often in experimental work, even among the 
polyploids produced. 

Several other workers have proven Eigsti f s statement given above. 

From their work we can relate the following effects of colchicine which 
are entirely separate from inducing tetraploidy or polyploidy: 

1. 6ertain concentrations applied to material intended foi~ cytological 
analysis aids definitely by shortening and unwinding the chromosomes. (27) 

2. Segregation in hybrids which refuse to segregate normally may be 
encouraged by use of colchicine. (39) 

3. Certain concentrations may stimulate germination of seeds to which 
they are applied. (4) 

VALUES CL INDUCED -LTRAPLOIDY 

The values of induced tetraploidy which have been already experienced 
may be summed up as follows: 

1. Quantitative increases, e.g. size of plants, flowers, fruits and seeds. 

2. Qualitative increases, e.g. increases in perfume, oil, sugar, vitamin, 
etc. 

3. Production of fertility in sterile interspecific and intergeneric 
crosses. (5, 28, 32) 

4. Increased longevity of cut and live flowers (14, 18) 

5. Widened adaptability and general use of the plant (14).

Since tetraploids developing naturally through evolution are more adapted 
to certain environments than are their corresponding diploids, it is to 
be expected that induced tetraploids will be better adapted somewhere also. 

6. Induced tetraploids may be used for further breeding work by crossing 
with species which are naturally tetraploid, thus making possible 
incorporation of new characteristics which were not before available for 
use. 

7. Rapid production of a homozygous line for use in further breeding 
work. (26). This will be dealt with in more detail later. 

TECHNIQUE, 0? APPLYING COLCHICINE (3, 7, 16, 17, 24, 33, 37, 41, 42) 

Technique is dependent upon the following factors (7): 

1. Colchicine diffuses into plant tissues and therefore surface application 
is all that is necessary. 

2. Only actively dividing cells are affected and therefore treatment must 
be applied to growing tips, germinating seeds, developing gametes, or to 
the very young embryo. Each of these requiresja different technique. 

3. The rate of cell division depends upon the temperature and it is 
therefore necessary to use the optimum temperature while treating. 

4. The length cf time to complete the cycle of cell division. It is 
important that the duration of treatment be approximately equal to the 
length of the cycle, to insure that all cells will be doubled and also to 
insure that some will not be doubled twice. 

5. Each species needs a specific concentration in order to be affected 
and this can only be determined by experimenting with different con¬ 


centrations

If seeds are to be treated, aqueous solutions of colchicine are used, 
ranging from 0.001$ to 1$ by weight. The most common concentrations are 
0.2$ and 0.4$. The length cf time for soaking seeds ranges from 6 hours 
to 4 days, depending upon the size of seed and permeability of the seed 
coat. Those seeds requiring a long period of treatment need only a weak 
concentration. An objection to seed treating is that tie root as well as 
the shoot is affected and frequently refuses to grow. However, in spite 
of this, seed soaking is probably the most suitable method to use with the 
majority of plants. 

Seedling treatment sometimes gives better results than seed treatment 
(7). This is especially true of species which take a long time to germinate. 
Freshly germinated seedlings are immersed in colchicine solution in a 
shallow container, or placed on filter or blotter paper thoroughly wetted 
with the solution. Duration of treatment varies from 3 to 24 hours 
depending upon the kind of seedling and its rapidity of growth. 

If growing tips or buds are to be treated, aqueous solutions may 
again be used, either dipping them into the solution cr spraying with an 
atomizer, the treatment being repeated 3 or 4 times at six hour intervals. 

A 0.1$ solution is probably best to use. Colchicine may also be applied 
in lanolin paste, agar solution or glycerine solution, and emulsions of 
these. (3, 7, 16, 42). If lanolin paste is used, the concentration of 
colchicine is usually 1$ to 2$. Such preparations are usually daubed on 
with a brush and one application may be sufficient. 

Myers (24), and Yeager and Haubrieh (42) describe injection methods, 
using 0.5 to 1$ aqueous solutions, with which they were successful in 
inducing tetraploidy in growing tips.

No matter which method of application is used it is well to keep in 
mind the extremely poisonous nature of colchicine and the danger in 
careless handling of it. It should not be allowed to come in contact with 
the skin. Very small amounts taken internally will cause death. 

HORTICULTURAL ACCOMPLISHMENT:; VITH COLCHICINE 

The most outstanding results achieved to date have been in floriculture. 
(3, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 25, 40). Giant marigolds, zinnias, phlox, clarkias, 
snapdragons, petunias and nasturtiums are already on the market. The 
colors in these are generally deeper and richer. 

In the fruit line there are very few reports tc date but this promises 
to be a big field. Doubled cranberries (10), peaches (8, 12) and 
strawberries (11) have been reported. No doubt there are many other fruits 
under experiment. 

In the vegetable line there is a great deal being done at present 
and many new varieties will be making their appearance soon. There is still 
room for much improvement through experimentation and breeding. The 
following literature review deals only with work done on vegetables. 

LITERATURE REVIEW 

Tor the sake of convenience, all vegetables upon which,reports have 
been found of colchicine experiments, are grouped under the following headings: 
Tomatoes, Lettuce, Onions, Root Crops, and Vine. Crops. 

TOMATOES 

Newcomer (26) selected five tomato plants from a field as probable 
haploids on the basis of phenotypic characteristics. On cytological 
examination two proved to be haploids and the other three to be diploid

rogues. The haploids were multiplied by cuttings and 18 were treated 
with 0.4$ colchicine emulsion. All treated plants became hypertrpphied, 
but in only 2 cases was the response more than superficial. These two 
plants proved to be diploid and produced a crop of normal diploid fruit. 
These diploid plants would be genetically homozygous and very 
useful in further breeding work. This instance of developing a homozygous 
line in a single generation would suggest a very valuable use of colchicine 
in other breeding programs to eliminate the time and effort usually re¬ 
quired in generations of inbreeding. 

Stair and Showalter (35) have reported success in inducing tetraploidy 
in tomatoes with colchicine. Three methods of treatment were used: 

1. Immersed tips of young seedlings in vials of colchicine solution of 
various concentrations for various periods of time. A solution of 0.8$ 
for 48 hours gave the best results. 

2. Soaked seeds in various concentrations for various lengths of time. 

A solution of 0.8$ for 8 days proved to give biggest percent of tetraploids. 

3. Dropped various amounts of 0.4$ solution on growing tips at 2 hour 
intervals over a 13 day period. This method yielded no success. 

Tetraploid plants could be easily distinguished even in the seedling 
stage, on.account of large flowers, heavy green stems, crinkly green leaves, 
and pollen grains twice normal size. Chromosomes were counted and found 
to be doubled in number. Tetraploid plants were conspicuous because-they 
bore only very few fruits or were barren; the fruits that did develop were 
small and solid and had few or no seeds. Seeds were saved from all 
tetraploids that produced seed, and they were sown the following year 

in the field. All such seeds produced large non-fruitful tetraploid plants.

The writers concluded that the production of tetraplcids in market 
tomatoes would appear to be of no commercial value insofar as increased 
size of fruits or yields is concerned. They assumed that such tetraploids 
might be of value in a tomato breeding program for the purpose of cross¬ 
ing some rather distantly related species. 

In 1935, before the present "era" of colchicine polyploidy, Kostoff 
and Axamitnaja (21) made an interesting comparative analysis of auto- 
tetraploid and diploid tomatoes. They found that the tetraploid had 
higher water content per unit of tissue, and more sugars, nitrogen and 
proteins; while the diploid had more ash and more starch. Sansome and 
Zilva (31) found that tetraploid strains of tomato exceeded the diploid 
in vitamin C content. 

An interesting discovery of a new colchicine effect upon tomatoes has 
been published by Walkof (39), while working with the hybrid seedlings 
of the cross Farthest North X Polar Circle he found no signs of segregation 
even into the third and fourth generations. All the Fl and following 
generations appeared identical and seemed to be very much the same as 
the Polar Circle variety. Since plants of the .Farthest North type were 
desired from the breeding work it was decided to try artificial means 
of bringing segregation into play. 

Colchicine was applied to a group of fifty F3 seedlings in concentrations 
of 0.02, 0.2 and 2$ solutions, ^n atomizer was used to treat the seedlings 
since it was found to produce a misty spray, essential for penetration 
of the dense hairs covering young tomato seedlings. The colchicine 
applications were made at regular intervals so that the growing tips were

kept moist from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. during four consecutive days. 

The plants ceased growth almost immediately and remained stunted for 
approximately two weeks. Six weeks after resumption of growth it was 
quite evident that definite segregation had taken place. Varying numbers 
of seedlings of the Polar Circle, Farthest North, and intermediate plant 
types were found. Uytological examination of the colchicine-affected 
seedlings showed that no polyploidy had resulted. Regarding segregation, 
Walkof states "the effect of the colchicine had been primarily an en¬ 
couraging one.” 

LETTUCE 

Thompson and Kosar (38) working with the Grand Rapids variety of 
lettuce, grew approximately 200 seedlings from seed treated with 0.1# 
colchicine solution for periods ranging from one-half hour to 48 hours. 
Three showed abnormal characters at maturity, such as smoother leaves 
which lacked savoying and marginal frills. Cytological examination of 
the pollen mother cells showed these plants to be tetraploids having 18 
gametic chromosomes. 'These 3 plants were all from the 27 hour treatment. 

Only a few seeds set on these plants. All the progeny proved to be 
tetraploid and were also quite self-sterile, although individual plants 
varied greatly, giving hope that fairly fertile line could be selected in 
future generations. 

The authors report that numerous variations were observed among the 
progeny ana state, "These variations are difficult to explain since it is 
not generally believed that the normal arrangement of the genes is 
affected by colchicine. The variations observed seem to indicate that it

is. They can hardly be attributed to heterozygosity in the original 
strain because the Grand Rapids variety is known to have been inbred for 
a great number of generations over a period of 20 years, and probably 
is as homozygous as any strain available.". It might be suggested that 
chromosome breakage and its resulting mutation as reported by Eigsti (15) 
is the explanation. This matter has already been discussed in this paper 
under the heading "Other Effects of Colchicine." 

Thompson and Kosar state further that "due to the particular variations 
in chromosome numbers among the Lactuca species, the use of colchicine in 
building up the chromosome number of different species to permit pairing 
in interspecific crosses does not seem promising. It may be of value 
in overcoming self-sterility in some of these hybrids already obtained. 

The most promising use of colchicine in lettuce breeding appears to be in 
the production of autopolyploids as in this experiment, especially where 
size can be increased in certain dwarf segregates of hybrid breeding 
which have good heading characters." 

ONION 

O’Mara (27) working with colchicine and the common onion (Alliuiqjbepa) 
observed the effects of treatments for various periods of time and con¬ 
centrations of solution. The hypertrophy usually associated with treat¬ 
ment was found not to involve the meristem but rather the zone of elong¬ 
ation. It was also found that concentrations of colchicine below the 
threshold of polyploid induction were valuable in studies of chromosome 
morphology and numbers in somatic tissue on account of causing shortening 
and thickening of the chromosomes and also a lack of coiling.

CORN 

The Horticulture Division of the Central Experimental Farm of Ottawa 
reported in the fall of 1941 that 4 tetraploids had been found among 21 
colchicine-treated corn plants. All of these were obtained from seed soaked 
for 3 days in 0.05$ solution. One formed very few male flowers and another 
did not form any females. A cross was made between these two plants and 
one ear was developed. 

Randplph and Hand (30) report that tetraploid strains of yellow corn . 
are higher in carotinoids than the diploids. In the tetraploid they found 
43$ increase of carotinoid and "the same percentage increase in Yitamin 
A activity, since both the active carotinoids, beta carotin and cryptoxanthin, 
and the inactive zeaxanthin were increased to the same extent." They 
also report that cell volume in the tetraploid is 3.5 times as great as 
that in the diploid. 

ROOT CROPS 

Peto and Boyes (29) report interesting experiments with sugar beets 
and colchicine. The drug was dissolved in an agar gel and applied in 
gelatine drug capsules. The young shoots were decapitated and capsules 
containing 0.1 or 0.5$ colchicine were slipped over the cut end. The 
colchicine affected the axillary buds just below the point of decapitation, 
and by cutting back all normal shoots, growth in the affected shoots was 
promoted. Abnormally large pollen grains were found on certain branches 
of five of the 33 stecklings treated. Chromosome counts were made on 
206 of the progeny of affected branches, and 69 triploids and 2 tetra¬ 
ploids were found. It was obvious that the majority of the tetraploid

flowers must have been fertilized with pollen from diploid sectors of the 
same plant or from adjacent diploid plants, 

their results indicate that triploids may be superior to diploids in 
respect to yield of sugar, weight of root, and particularly in the 
maintenance of percentage sugar with increased size of root. Percentage 
sugar and root weight were negatively correlated in both diploid and tri- 
ploid beets, but the decreases in percentage of sugar for every 100 gnu 
increase in root weight differed significantly, being on the average 0,34$ 
for the diploids and 0,17$ for the triploids. As root weight increased 
beyond 900 gm. the yield of sugar per lOOgm. of root weight increased more 
rapidly in the triploids than in the diploids. Triploid beets exceeded 
the diploids in root weight by 12.2$ in yield of sugar per beet by 14.9$, 
and in dry top weight by 17.8$. The triploids exceeded the diploids in 
area index of the leaves by 34.4$ and in area index of the stomata by 
42.6$. 

Extensive experimental work with sugar beets, mangels and swedes 
has been reported by Armstrong (1). Colchicine treatment on seeds and 
seedlings was used to induce tetraploidy/in each of these root crops, 
and cross breeding with the diploids was practised in order to develop 
triploids.- Yields of all types were then compared in field trials. 

It was found with swedes that a direct treatment of the seeds for 
24 hours in a 0.2 to 0.4$ aqueous solution of colchicine was effective 
in producing the characteristic symptoms of polyploidy. In sugar beet 
and mangels, owing to the seeds being embedded in a corky perianth it 


was necessary to presoak them in water for several days until the radicles 



- 16 


__and plumules had emerged. These germinated seeds were then treated with a 

I 

0.2 to 0.4$ solution for two to three hours and washed off before being 
planted. The characters that were used to identify C-seedlings (those which 
were probably polyploid) were thickening and crinkling of the leaves and 
increased diameter of the taproot along with retarded growth in the early 
stages. In later stages of growth increased size of stomata and pollen were 
used. Armstrong states, "Before using a plant in crossing work its status 
as diploid or tetraploid was established by pollen measurements." Apparently 
he did not use ontological analysis and chromosome counts, and was probably 
in agreement with the statement of Dermen (7), "It is apparently a 
universal phenomenon that following a doubling of chromosome number there 
is always an increase in the pollen grain size." Thus it may be concluded 
that the detection of induced polyploidy may be more accurately made through 
measurement of pollen grains than by use of any other morphological 
measurement. Armstrong found that pollen from diploids ranged in size 
from 0.035 to 0.042 mm. for all three varieties of roots while that of 
the tetraploids varied from 0.04 to 0.05 mm# pollen from tetraploids of 
mangel and sugar beet was highly viable but that from swedes had about 
50$ defective grains. 

Selfed and crossed diploid racemes in the swede gave approximately 
20 seeds per pd^, The tetraploid seifs and crosses produced very short 
pods with 3 to 4 seeds per pd. These seeds differed from the diploid in 
that they were generally larger and about 20$ cf them were in an arrested 
stage of -germination. These seeds proved to be quite capable of continued 
germination and normal development upon planting.

It is interesting to note that Armstrong’s yield trials showed that in 
all three varieties diploids yielded significantly better than tetraploids, 
while triploids were intermediate. This is definitely not .idjline with 
the finding of Peto and Boyes (29) already described. Also, the various 
sugar beet chromosome types showed no significant differences in percent¬ 
ages dry matter or sugar content. It was therefore concluded that in' 
the cases of the varieties investigated, the development of tetraploid 
strains would serve no practical purpose. 

It might be worth noting that Armstrong used the Cesena variety of 
sugar beet whereas Peto and Boyes used the Great Western.

Sinnott and Blakeslee (34) have reported success in colchicine-in¬ 
duction of tetraploidy in some of the varieties of cucurbits. They found 
that fruits of tetraploids were not larger in size but were relatively 
shorter and broader than the diploids. 

Shifriss (33) reports obtaining tetraploids of both cucumber and 
melons but writes in detail only on the autotetraploids of the cucumber. 

He found that the treatment of the shoot apex at the cotyledon stage 
of growth with 0.3-0. bf 0 colchicine emulsion is the most efficient method 
for mass production of polyploids in the cucurbits. The treated plants 
may appear morphologically octoploid or higher polyploid in the early 
stages and thereafter may revert to the tetraploid or diploid condition. 
Chromosome counts were made from root tips of seedlings of the next 
generation after treatment to determine definitely the polyploid character 


of individual plants.

The tetraploids showed, in general, the expected tetraploid features. 
Under favourable greenhouse conditions they were more vigorous, had thicker 
stems and petioles, and their leaved were thicker, darker in color, and 
slightly more hairy than diploids. However, the most outstanding feature 
of these tetraploids was the accentuated serration of the leaf margin. 

The stomata chloroplasts, and pollen grains of the induced tetraploids 
were compared with those cf the parental diploids. It is concluded that 
the frequency of stomat^es per unit of area is decreased as a result of 
chromosomal doubling. This decrease is associated with an equal increase 
in area of the tetraploid stomat^es. The chloroplasts in the tetraploid 
cells are not larger in size than in the diploid, but the number is 1.6 
times as great. However, since the area of the tetraploid cell is 1.6 
times as great as that of the diploid, the number of chloroplasts per 
unit of cytoplasm in both tetraploid and diploid tissues remains the 
same. The average diameter of pollen grains from tetraploids is 1.3 
times as great as that from diploids, the area is 1,8 times as great and 
the volume 2.4 times as great. 

The change in flower size was comparable to the change in stomatal 
size and pollen size. The octoploid is very different from the tetraploid 
and diploid. Besides stunting of stature, ovary shape is modified to be 
wider and shorter, and the fruit diffei^s from the typical elongate form 
in being spherical or oval in shape and much reduced in size. A3.though 
the corolla of the octoploid pistillate flower is slightly reduced, 
that of the staminate flower is vestigial. 

Under favorable greenhouse conditions the fruits of some tetraploids

are more truncate but are not any shorter than diploids. These same 
tetraploids under field conditions produced markedly shorter and broader 
fruits than did diploids. In contrast, other tetraploids produce con¬ 
sistently shorter fruits under a wide variation of environment, and there 
is no increase in the width of fruits over those of diploids. Therefore, 
the increase in width of fruits and decrease in length is not an inevitable 
change associated with tetraploidy. 

It was also seen that the tetraploid has a reduced ecological range 
for pptimum growth. Under cold outside conditions the plants were 30-40 
days later in maturity, more sensitive to mild frost, and at least 
equally susceptible to most common diseases. 

In the first three generations of the tetraploid population occasional 
diploids were recovered at the seedling stage. Reported cases of this 
autopolyploid reversion are rare. Shifriss states, "These diploids were 
assumed to be of maternal origin, as in the case of corn reported by 
Randolph and Fischer, who presented conclusive evidence that the diploid 
plants were due to parthenogenesis." 

In the succeeding generations following colchicine treatment and 
development of tetraploidy, various kinds of mutants began to show up. 

All treated plants manifested a remarkable degree of sterility. 

Both the number of viable seed and total number of seed per fruit were 
markedly reduced. Factors causing this sterility were eliminated in 
later generations since there was a pronounced increase of seed pro¬ 
duction. 

The cross 2n x 4n yielded 0.05$ viable seed and the 4n x 2n cross

___y {elded 1.11$* The embryos of these seeds are exceedingly weak. Thus, 
once they are established, the tetraploids represent a distinctly isolated 
population. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

In the early spring of 1941, the writer began some colchicine experi¬ 
ments with vegetables. Aqueous solutions of colchicine, ranging from 0.05$ 
to 0.4$, were used on seeds in Petri dishes, the time of treatment varying 
from 18 to 48 hours. Seeds which geminated fast received a shorter period 
of treatment than did those which were slower. In general, each species 
and variety was subjected to several different concentrations for several 
different periods of time. 

A wide range of vegetables was used for the preliminary treatments 
in order to obtain a working knowledge of which ones subsequently would 
grow and which ones for various reasons, seemed promising for further 
study. It was planned to reduce the material to two or three vegetables, 
or a half dozen at the most, in order to handle these more extensively 
and intensively in two years of growth. Seeds of the following vegetables 
were treated: lettuce, rutabaga, beet radish, carrot, parsley, broccoli, 
cauliflower, cabbage, onion, cucumber, squash, marrow, pumpkin, muskmelcn, 
watermelon, parsnip, tomato, corn, turnip, spinach, chard, Chinese cabbage, 
beans and peas. 

Most of these seeds were given 6 c.c. of colchicine solution in a Petri 
dish having a piece of blotting paper in the bottom upon which the seeds 
were laid. Larger seeds, such as those of peas, beans and corn, were given 
10 c.c. of solution. Covers were put over the Petri dishes and, after

labelling, the dishes were left at room temperature until time for seeding. 



Figure 1 


Method of seed treatment. 













Seeds of root crops were planted directly outdoors in the garden; 
all other classes were started in flats in the greenhouse. A few un¬ 
treated seeds of each variety were planted at the same time, side by 
side with the treated seeds, for comparison, thus enabling affected 
plants to be more easily distinguished. 

As the growing season advanced, quite a number of species and varieties 
were discarded from the experiments for want of any symptoms having shown, 
or because all the seedlings of that particular vegetable had either died 
or had failed to germinate. At the end of the year only the following 
varieties were kept for further experimentation: Nantes carrot, Early White 
Barletta onion, Early G-rano onion, Propageno sprouting broccoli, Long 
White Trailing English vegetable marrow, and Fort Berthold pumpkin. Certain 
specimens of carrot and onions were selected as probably polyploid on 
account of certain definite morphological differences from the normal 
which had developed. With broccoli, besides observing certain of the 
usual symptoms of being affected by colchicine, stomatal measurements 
were used in order to choose affected plants. With the vine crops, pollen 
smears were made. Increased pollen size c / 

ph cn es were user/ in order to select those plants which were 

probably tetraploid. or higher polyploid. 

Having thus chosen certain plants that were probably changed in 
chromosome constitution, the vine crops were self-pollinated and bagged 
and the resulting fruits, along with some open-pollinated ones, were 
carried over winter, and seed obtained from them. Seeds from each fruit 
were kept separate. Some of these were sown in flats in tne spring of

1942 and were transferred to pots before being set out in the garden. 
Potting was done in order to take root tips for chromesome-number deter¬ 
mination. Root tips were taken at mid-day and were fixed, embedded, 
mounted, and stained according to Pasternack’s Paraffin Method (19). 
Following the taking of root tips, all the potted seedlings, including 
some normal ones, were planted in. the garden, notes were taken on develop¬ 
ments during the year, self-pollination was again practised, and fruxts 
from certain plants which appeared outstanding were harvested for seed for 
another year. 

✓ 

Selected individuals of the carrot, onion, and broccoli were trans¬ 
ferred in the fall of 1941, before freeze-up, to pots and boxes in the 
greenhouse. All of these were allowed to flower and to seed by open 
pollination during the winter and the spring of 1942. Seeds from in¬ 
dividual plants were harvested separately and indexed. Some of these were 
grown during the following season and the plants compared with normal ones. 

Chromosome counts were not attempted on the carrots and broccoli 
selected, but during a period of one month leave of absence from work in 
January 1944, chromosome determinations were made on the onions and 
several methods were tried on the vine crops. The method used for the 
onions was the Feulgen Squash Method as outlined by Darlington and LaCour 
(6). Methods attempted for determination of chromosome numbers in the 
vine crops included: 

(1) Paraffin Method (19) 

(2) Feulgen Squash Method (6). 

(5) Heidenhain’s Kaematoxylin Methods, schedules 1 and 8 (6).

RESULTS 


METHODS OF TREATMENT 

With big seeded varieties, including corn, beans and peas, the 
concentrations of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4$ for periods of 18, 24 and 36 hours 
did not prove to be satisfactory. There was some indication with corn 
that 0.1$ for 44-48 hours might be more effective, in the case of beans, 
some seeds grew/ under all treatments, but other than the fact that there 
was poor emergence there were no symptoms noticed. The same was true of 
peas, although the effect on emergence was even more detrimental. Better 
results would probably be obtained with these big seeded varieties by 
germinating them first and then applying colchicine treatment to the growing 
shoot, as the reason for failure in seed treatment seems to be the prevention 
of growth of the radicle, along with inability of the solution to penetrate 
the thick cotyledons where the epicotyl could be affected. 

In the ease of beet, chard, and tomato the results again indicate that 
treatment of seedlings would probably be a better method than seed 
treatment. No affected symptoms were noted in any of these varieties from 
the three main concentrations (0.1, 0.2, and 0.4$) and the three periods of 
time (18, 24 and 36 hours) used in all the vegetable tests, except that with 
the beet there was poor emergence, and with the tomato several plants on 
nearing maturity showed affected symptoms of larger leaves and flowers. 

These are rather slow germinating varieties which might explain the reason 
why they were not affected by the treatments used, as the cells have to 
be in an actively dividing state in order to allow induction of tetraploidy. 

Parsley and parsnip, whicn are also slow germinating vegetables,

showed no emergence whatever under all three concentrations for both 
24 and 36 hours cf treatment. The carrot showed none under 36 hours 
treatment and only light emergence under 0.2 and 0.4$ for 24 hours. These 
seedlings that did emerge showed no affected symptoms until well on in 
the growing•season when leaf color and size and plant vigor exhibited 
differences from norrrial(see fig. $4) • For these three vegetables, especially 
parsley and parsnip, weaker concentrations should be tried. 

It is interesting to note that with these slow germinating varieties 
of vegetables, no concentration under trial gave any evidence of stimulating 
the germination as reported by Bond (4). In fact the effect was very much 
the opposite. 

A c-solution ( colchicine solution) of 0.2$ for 36 hours gave good 
results with kohl crops such as broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower. However, 
many plants which showed effects gradually died off, indicating that the 
treatment was too harsh. A shorter period of treatment could undoubtedly 
be used to advantage. The root-crop crucifers, radish, and rutabaga,seem 
to be too adversely affected by 0.2 and 0.4$ c-colutions for 24 and 36 hour 
periods, especially radish which had' no emergence whatever. An 18-hour 
treatment in 0.1 to 0.2$ solution would probably give good results. 

All three concentrations for 24 and 36 hour periods.proved to be too 
strong for lettuce, as no seeds grew. Good results were obtained with 
0.1 and 0.2$ solutions applied for 18 hours. Most seeds grew quite well 
and c-symptoms were evident in many. 

With the vine crops, good results were obtained with 0.2$ e-solution 
and a period of 36 hours, excepting cucumber and muskmelon which do not

require such a long period of treatment. A 0.2$ solution for 18 hours is 
more satisfactory .for them. A shorter period than 36 hours would probably 
give good results with the other cucurbits as well, as many of them 
showing severe effects such as stunting, thickening and hardening of 

i- 

cotyledons, and crinkly and mishapen first leaves, died off over a period 
of a few weeks.

Treatments for 24 hours with both 0*2 and 0.4% c-colution proved to 
be detrimental to spinach as no plants emerged. On the ether hand 0.1 
and 0.2% c-solution for 18 hours resulted in good emergence, although 
symptoms were not very evident in early stages of growth. A treatment of 
0.2% for 20 hours could be recommended. 

With onions, 0.2 and 0.4% solutions for US hours were the only treat¬ 
ments used. Emergence was good and all seedlings exhibited effects of 
treatment in having a large bulge on the growing tip and an absence of 
the right-angled "knees” characteristic of normal onion seedlings. How¬ 
ever, most of these died as the growing season advanced. Probably a 
weaker solution for a shorter period of time would be better. 

In general, with seeds which germinate readily any concentration 
ranging from 0.1 to 0.4% will give success if the period of treatment 
is varied to find the proper length of time. The same would probably 
apply to treatment of seedlings of large seeded varieties and slow ger¬ 
minating varieties. 

LETTUCE 

The variety Improved New York B head lettuce was used in the exper¬ 
iments. As already stated, the longer periods of treatment proved to be 
deleterious whereas 0.1 and 0.2% c-solutions for a period of 18 hours gave 
good results. The seeds emerged well under both these treatments and 
many showed symptoms of being affected in that the first several leaves 
were deformed, ragged, thicker than normal, and somewhat stiffer. 

Upon transplanting these affected plants to the outdoor plots a 
high percentage soon perished, even though growing conditions were very

good. This was probably on account of the weakened condition of the root 
system following the c-treatments. 

Most of the survivors produced extra large solid heads which would 
certainly excel the normal heads. However, the wide spacing between plants 
would be responsible in part for this difference. These plants were very 
slow in maturing and although they were transplanted to the garden in mid- 
June they were just beginning to flower when the first fall frosts des¬ 
troyed them. This was allowed to happen as all the material that could 
be handled during the winter had already been chosen from other vegetables 
under experiment. 

TOMATO 

The variety Bounty showed no c-symptoms whatever under concentrations 
of 0.2 and 0.4# e-solution for periods of 24 and 36 hours. It was then 
decided to try these same concentrations for an 18-hour period on seeds 
of the variety Farthest North. This very early maturing variety has 
very small fruits about l n in diameter, and it was hoped that the 
induction of tetraplcidy would result in a much larger fruit that would be 
suitable for commercial purposes. 

The seeds of this variety emerged well from both treatments. Any 
c-symptoms.were very difficult to detect in the seedling stage, although 
several plants were suspected of being affected on account of somewhat 
slower growth and thicker leaves with a small amount of distortion. After 
tramsplanting to the garden plots several plants were noticed to be more 
vigorous than the rest and the blossoms of these were considerably larger 
than normal. Fruit formation was delayed on these plants but ripened

nevertheless. It was disappointing to find that these fruits had no 
advantage in size over fruits from normal plants. This would be in line 
with the findings of Stair and Showalter (35) already dealt with in the 
literature review. Because of this fact further experimental work with 
this vegetable was dropped. 

SPINACH 

With spinach it was hoped that induction of tetraploidy would result 
in a delay of maturity, thus extending the period of usefulness of this 
vegetable as it normally goes to seed very early in the growing season. 

Any positive quantitative effect on the plant would also be an advantage 
since the vegetative part of spinach is the commercial part. 

The various c“-treatments have already been dealt with. Among the plants 
that grew from A 0.1 and 0.2$ c-solutionsused for 18 hours it was impossible 
to pick any that showed definite c-symptoms during the seedling stage. 

They all came through the transplanting to the garden in good shape 
and most of them went to seed almost immediately,/**'*? /$<?</every little 
growth. Three plants produced vigorous growth of dark green coloration 
and were decidedly later in maturity than the normal plants. One plant 
in particular, which resembled an extreme male, was still very green 
when winter set in, but four seeds had set. The ether two plants were 
more on the female side and these set an abundance of seed. 

These seeds were collected separately from each plant and indexed. 

The following spring some of them were sown alongside a row of normal 
seed for comparison purposes. It was quite evident that the -seeds from 
all three affected plants geminated much sooner than did the normal seeds.

This is f> a rf / cu //? fere sf/r?p as the same thing has been 

noticed with seedlings from e-affected onion and broccoli plants. It is 

C 

difficult to explain, especially after definite proof has been obtained 
with the onion seedlings that they were not tetraploid (see p. 31). 

The seedlings from two of the spinach plants were all very uniform 
in their growth, much more so than the normal or check seedlings, but 
they matured and went to seed considerably earlier. 

Seedlings from the plant which produced only 4 seeds were identical 
with their parent plant, being dark green in color, late in maturity, and 
resembling extreme males. There were, however, certain individuals among 
the check plants that appeared to have characteristics very similar to these. 

Although definite effects have thus been noted on the offspring of c- 
trented spinach seeds of the King of Denmark Long Standing variety, no 
chromosome counts have yet been made and it is impossible to say whether 
or not the earlier maturing seeds reported above are tetraploids. 

ONION 

Seeds of the varieties Early Grano and Early White Barletta were 
given c-treatments in the spring of 1941. The effects of treatment have 
already been discussed, under the heading Methods of Treatment. The 
Early Grano is a large suseet onion of the Spanish type which is very desir¬ 
able for culinary purposes. The Early White Barletta is a pickier. 

It was hoped that by c-treatment the earliness in maturity of this variety 
J could be coupled with larger size to make it a variety 
that would be suitable for culinary use and which would mature from 

seed in the garden under Alberta*s growing conditions. 

By the fall of 1941 many of the c-treated plants had perished. The

few that survived were much smaller than normal in the Early Grano variety 
while those of the Barletta were considerably larger than the affected 
Granos. 

The bulbs were taken up in the fall and carried on for seed in the 
greenhouse. In the early spring of 1942 two of the Granos and four of 
the Barlettas sent up seed stalks and developed a good set of what 
appeared in every way to be seed from, normal or diploid plants. The 
remaining bulbs failed to seed up to the spring of 1943 and were discarded. 

Some of the seeds collected from the six plants that matured were 
sown in flats along with some checks in March 1943. In 12 days time the 
checks were just beginning to emerge whereas all the others had developed 
vigorous seedlings over an inch in height. This material could not be 
carried on further on account of a change in occupation. However, root tips 
were taken for chromosome counts from seedlings of the same stock the 
following winter. The'Peulgen Squash Method (5) , a very rapid method in 
comparison to the paraffin method usually used, gave very good results. 

All the seedlings tested proved to have 16 chromosomes in their somatic 
tissues, this being the same as in the check seedlings. 

Since there was no chromosome difference between checks and seedlings 
from c — reated plants, it is hard to understand why there was such a big 
difference in the v<*gor of emergence of the two kinds of seedlings. 

BROCCOLI 

As already stated a c-solution of 0.2$ for 36 hours gave good results 
in causing c-symptoms to appear in seedlings of Propageno sprouting 
broccoli. The effects noted were stunted early growth, with first leaves

thickened, stiffer than normal, and somewhat deformed. The seedlings soon 
outgrew these effects and developed into vigorous plants after being 
transplanted to the garden plots. < 

By use of stomatal measurements, several plants were chosen as probably 
tetraploid. Stomatal length varied from 6 to 9 units with an average of 
about 8 units in the checks while in those plants chosen as probably 
tetraploid the length varied from. 7.5 to 11.5 units with an average of 
10.5. The change in width of stomata ith the change in length. 

Flower size in these selected plants was noted to be much larger than 
normal. 

Before danger of frost in the fall the selected plants were dug and 
transplanted to butter boxes in the greenhouse, where they seeded. Seed 
set was very poor, only a very small percentage of flowers developing pods 
which contained any seed, and these very seldom contained more than one 
seed. The pods that did develop a seed or two were much elongated and 
widened and often angled£ see fig. $3)• The seeds were considerably larger 
than normal seed and quite a number of them were noticed to be in a 
delayed germination stage as reported by Armstrong (1) in swedes. 

The following spring some of these seeds were planted in a flat, side 
by side with some check seeds. Again, as in the cases on spinach and 
6ni6ri, these seeds collected from c-treated plants germinated sooner 
than the checks and remained considerably more vigorous for several weeks. 
Following transplanting to the garden this difference became less apparent. 
In general, very little difference was noted in the development of the 
edible shoots although there were several plants among the c-lot that

had larger heads of deeper green color. This would indicate that selection 
following c-treatment might yield worthwhile results. 

Most of the plants in the c-lot appeared to have flowers larger in 
size than the checks and seed set was almost as poor as in the parents. 

It would thus appear that tnan^f the seedlings in the c-lot were 
tetraploia. However, no attempt was made to determine the chromosome 
numbers. 

CARROT 

Only very few seedlings of the variety Half-long Nantes began growth 
after the c-treatments already discussed. No definite c-sympto:as were 
noticed in these until fairly well on towards maturity when differences in 
color and size of foliage and size of the crowns were quite apparent. The 
accompanying photos (figs. 4 and 5 ) illustrate these differences. In 
figure 4 the leaf on the left is a normal leaf, while the other two are 
from c-affected plants. In figure 5 the right carrot is a normal one while 
the left carrot is c-affected. Note the big difference in the strength 
of the tops at the attachment to the crown as well as the changes in the 
root itself. The Nantes variety is noted for weakness of the tops 
and breakage while pulling the roots, and it was hoped that chromosome 
doubling might have a strengthening effect as illustrated. 

The roots from five plants which showed effects were put in large pots 
in the greenhouse, 3y early spring they had sent up flower stalks and 
eventually produced seeds. The new tops that grew on these plants after 
moving them into the greenhouse showed differences for each plant in 
degree of green coloration, size of leaflets, and strength of leaves.

Differences were also noted in seed set and size. One plant was part¬ 
icularly straggly and weak in the tops and seed stalk, and it set only 
three seeds altogether, ‘these being normal in size. The pistils in 
the flowers of this plant tended to grow out into little simple leaves, 
making a very good illustration of the fact that flowers have originated 
from leaves. Another plant had particularly dark green foliage with large 
leaflets and very good strong growth. It had a very good set of seed, 
these being larger in size than normal. Seeds from all the other plants 
were normal in size. 

Seeds from the dark-green-foliage plant were sown as soon as they had 
ripened and the seedlings compared with checks. They germinated excellently 
but did not show any appreciable difference in earliness of germinating 
as reported for several other vegetables. In a couple of weeks time, 
however, they began to show signs of being more vigorous in growth and darker 
in foliage than the checks. This difference increased over the growing 
season, resulting in a big difference in height of tops at the end of the 
season. The ire /?lants were very much like their parent except that the 
roots failed to grow to the same size. There was no increase in root 
weight over the checks although there was a change in shape, this being 
similar to that of the c-affected plant shown in figure 5, which is not 
to be desired over the normal shape of the variety. Supposing that these 
plants were tetraploid, the results would bear out the findings of Arm¬ 
strong (1) with field root crops as already reviewed.

The variety Fort Berthold was chosen for the experiments as it is a 
very early maturing variety, which yields an abundance of good quality but 
very small fruits. It was hoped that the good qualitites could be 
maintained and an increase in size accomplished by inducing polyploidy. 

The results have been favourable. 

Following transplanting of the c-affected seedlings to the garden plots 
certain individuals began to look more vigorous than others, and leaf and 
flower size was noticed to be particularly large. Pollen smears were 
made and measurements recorded. It was surprising to find that practically 
IOO 70 of the pollen examined appeared to be viable. The average diameter 
of pollen from untreated plants was 7.6 units and that from plants 
suspected of being tetraploids was 9.7 units. 

Certain plants were selected and self-pollination with bagging was 
practised upon them. Most of the flowers thus treated did not set fruit, 
but all those that did set resulted in fruits having many emp^ty seed coats 
which were much larger than normal seed. Only one seed which appeared 
viable was obtained from selfed fruits but it failed to germinate upon 
planting the following spring. 

However, the same plants upon which self-pollination was practised 
were allowed to set fruits from open pollination. TheBe were considerably 
larger than normal (see fig. 7) and contained quite a number of well 
filled seeds, these being more than twice the normal size(see fig. 6 ). 

Seeds Were harvested separately from each fruit of each selected 
plant and a pedigree system of numbering was developed.

plant (top) and from normal plant (bottom). 

One plant in particular had appeared very promising, so in .the 
following spring the work was carried on with its offspring. Out of 
27 seeds which had filled in the particular fruit selected from this plant, 
21 were planted and 10 germinated and grew to maturity. Segregation 
was very evident among these 10 plants. Several appeared very much normal, 
ethers were more vigorous with larger blossoms and fruits (very similar to 
the parent plant), and still others appeared to be crosses between vegetable 
marrow and pumpkin. This could easily have been the case as the parent 
plant had been open pollinated and grown side by side with vegeatble marrow 
plants. 














all of these ten plants was poor, although 


In general, seed set in 
there was a big improvement in this respect in the selfed fruits over those 
which had been selfed in the previous generation. Seed set ranged from 
10 to 50$. 

Plant number 3-7-8 was selected as being most outstanding in the lot 
of ten. It was self-pollinated and produced J- dozen typically shaped 
Port Berthold fruits, but which were considerably larger than normal. The 
one fruit saved for seed had about 33$ set of good viable seed. A few of 
these were planted directly into the garden at Lethbridge on June 5, 1944 
and matured fruits before frost appeared. Segregation was again evident 
in plant vigor and growth, size of leaves and flowers, and size of fruits. 

A few plants appeared in every way to be normal Fort Berthold pumpkins. 
Others appeared to be identical with the parent, number 3-7-8, while one 
plant was much more vigorous than the parent and set 2 fruits which were 
10” in diameter, 10.75" long, with an average flesh thickness of 2". This 
is definitely a large field pumpkin. A comparison of fruit size of the 
three segregates described above is shown in figure 7. Measurements 
recorded for the fruit of the normal type were 6.5" diameter, 4" in depth, 
1" average flesh thickness, and for that of plant 3 t 7-8 were: 8" diameter, 
5 " in depth, and 1.4" average flesh thickness. 

The fruit of the large-fruited segregate described above (now numbered 
3 _ 7 _ 3 _ 2 ) is attractive to the eye and appears to oe of good quality, both 
for cooking and storing. One fruit which was selfed contained 61 good 
plump seeds, indicating that the sterility exhibited in tne treated plants 
and in the following generation had been more or less overcome. This was

even more evident in other selections of this generation.

generation following e-treatment in the

VEGETABLE I-.1APHQE 

In general, what has been said for the pumpkin can be said again for 
results with vegetable marrow. One plant resulting from c-treatment was 
selected as the most promising, and on self-pollination matured several 
fruits which contained only very few viable seeds. These fruits were 
much larger than normal, as were also the seeds. The fruits were not 
any shorter than normal fruits in measurement but were definitely much 
more truncate and more ridgy. Fruits of each of the two following 



















- 42 - 


generations from this plant have been more or less identical with those 
of the parent plant. The fruit measures 14" in length and 8" in diameter 
in comparison to the normal of 14" in length and 4.5" in diameter. It 
tapers somewhat toward the stem end. 

C!.IRC;lQoO:.i: DE T.SP11 IN AT IONS ON CUCURBITS 

As already stated in the section on materials and methods, four 
methods were attempted in order to determine the chromosome numbers in 
the cucurbits which are described above. Three of these were used on root 
tips and the fourth on very young leaves. None of these were successful. 

Pasternack’s Paraffin method %19) is very time consuming. It resulted 
in well-stained sections of the root tips, the nuclei showing up very well, 
However, no cells were found to be in the plate phase or metaphase of cell 
division where chromosomes could be counted. 

Schedules 1 and 8 as given by Darlington and La Cour (6) were also 
used on root tips and gave similar results to the paraffin method. 

The Feulgen Squash method (6) is a very rapid method in comparison to 
the paraffin method and gave very good results with root tips of onions. 
With the cucurbit root tips, however, this method failed to make the nuclei 
show up at all. 

The Leaf Smear Method (S3) also failed to make any nuclei show up 
clearly. 

Since Shrifriss (33) had reported success in cytologieal work with 
the genus Cucumis it was decided to contact him regarding the method used. 
It was pointed out to him that all the root tips used in the trials had 
been taken from seedlings during mid-day. He suggested that this was the

Reason for failure in the methods used, as he had found it necessary to take 
the root tips at 3 to 5 a.m. in order to get good metaphase figures. He 
found that the paraffin method, using short staining with crystal violet 
gave very good results. 

Although chromosome determinations have not been completed, it is 
very evident that the cucurbits described above are polyploids. 

SimiARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

1. Seed treatment with colchicine solutions of large-seeded vegetables, 
including peas, beans and corn, did not prove satisfactory. It was con¬ 
cluded that treatment of the growing shoots of seedlings of these varieties 
would probably give better results. 

2. The same was found to be the case with vegetables such as beet, chard, 
tomato, parsley and parsnip which are slow to germinate. 

3. Any cf the various colchicine treatments used failed to show any effect 
on stimulatinggermination of slow germinating vegetables. 

4. Specific recommendations have been made for each vegetable under t^ial 
regarding the most efficient colchicine coneentration and period of 
treatment to use in inducing tetraploidy. 

5. It has been concluded that with fast germinating vegetables any 
concentration of colchicine solution between 0.1 and 0.4^ will give success 
if the period of treatment is. adjusted properly.. 

6 . In three cases, namely spinach, onion and broccoli, the seedlings of 
the generation following the one that had been treated with colchicine 
emerged much sooner and with much more vigor than did the checks. This 
was not a result of tetraploidy induction, at least in the case of the

.onion, for chromosome counts showed that the number had not been changed 
from diploid. 

7. The Feulgen Squash Method used on root tips of the onion taken at 
mid-day gave good results in enabling counting of chromosomes. This 
method was net suitable for the cucurbits. 

8 . four methods eommonly used for chromosome determination gave no ey/cfence 
71 with cucurbit root tips taken during mid-day. It is cfl/? c/Vc/eV that this 

failure was due to the taking of root tips at a time when the cells were 
not actively dividing, attention having been drawn to the fact that these 
root tips should be taken just before sun-/' v -S^- 

9. The effects of colchicine treatment morphologically and to a certain 
extent physj<?/#^ /r ^^have been described for many of the vegetables under 
trial, even into the second generation following treatment in the case 
of the cucurbits. 

10 . Alt he ugh llmiu-i." nu cytolflgixal preof , Since the induced effects 

on carrot, broccoli, and cucurbits have been passed on from one generation 

to the next, it has been concluded that the chromosome status has been

changed from that of the original variety. f
