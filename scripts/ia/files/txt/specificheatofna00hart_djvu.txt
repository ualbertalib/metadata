Introduction 

Thermal conductivities of various concentra¬ 
tions of napaim-Gasoline gels have been measured over 



Their results show that the thermal conductivity of the 
gels decreases with temperature hut is only slightly 
affected by the concentration. 


/ ilie purpose of this investigation was to de¬ 


termine the specific heats at constant pressure of 

similar gels over the same range of temperature. An 

adiabatic calorimeter using the method of mixtures has 

been used to measure the specific heats over the temp- 
o o 

erature range -50 0 to +50 0. Measurements were made 
on gasoline, napalm and on mixtures varying in con¬ 
centration from 5.0 to 18.5 per cent by weight of 
napalm. These mixtures form homogeneous gels. The 


apparatus provided an accuracy of about 2 % in the

General Method 

A sample of known mass was placed in a recept¬ 
acle in a constant temperature, pre-heating bath, the 
temperature of which was accurately measured. After it 
had reached the temperature of the bath it was trans¬ 
ferred to the calorimeter which contained a measured 
mass of distilled water, uere, under adiabatic con¬ 
ditions, the calorimeter and sample came to temperature 
equilibrium. She temperature change of the calorimeter 
was measured as well as the final temperature. i*hen, 
in the usual way, a calculation was made of the heat 
given out or absorbed by the sample in changing from 
its initial to its final temperature, conditions were 

arranged so that the final temperature for each case 

o 

was very nearly 21 0, A small correction was then 

applied to give the heat given out by the sample in 

changing temperature from its initial temperature to 

21.00°G. This was done for initial temperatures between 
o o 

-50 0 and +50 0. i'he following symbols were used: 

t^ - The temperature of the constant temp¬ 
erature bath, i.e. the initial temperature 
of the sample. 


t^ - the final temperature of the sample

The specific heat of water was taken to be 
1.000 cal/-gm/°C. Since the calorimeter itself operated 
over a temperature range from about 18°0 to 24°C, the 
effects of variation in the specific heat of water over 
this temperature range would lead to errors of less than 
0.1% and were neglected. S 


Apparatus and Technique 
(1) The Calorimeter 

The calorimeter assembly is shown in figure 1. 
The calorimeter proper (A) consisted of a brass vessel 
2 inches in diameter and 4 inches high, with a brass 
bottom soldered on to it. The top was made from sheet 
copper soldered to a brass ring which fitted into the 
brass vessel. A door in the top could be opened or 
closed by means of the thread (F). This contained.

during operation, ffom 100 to 140 grams of distilled 
water which could he stirred by the stirring arrange¬ 
ment (D-E). f fhe stirrer, a flat piece of copper 
shaped like a horseshoe,was mounted horizontally and 
moved up and down hy means of the plastic rod (E). 

i'he calorimeter sat on an insulating stand (0) 
inside a water-tight radiation jacket (B) and the 
whole was immersed in a large (5 gallon) water hath (P) 
which was continually stirred hy the motor driven pro- 
pellor shaft (0). 

i'he temperature of the water hath was controlled 
hy adding hot or cold water through the inlets (I) and 
00. A brass tube (Q) soldered to the inner side of 
the calorimeter proper, served as a well for one junc¬ 
tion of a copper-constantan thermocouple, fhe other 
junction was placed directly into the water hath and 
the E.M.P. registered hy means of a sensitive galvano¬ 
meter. The temperature of the calorimeter and of the 
radiation jacket could he kept equal hy adjusting the 
temperature of the water hath so that the galvanometer 
registered zero E.M.E. By this method, adiabatic 
conditions were obtained. 

i'he temperature of the calorimeter was 
measured hy means of a calibrated 0.1°0 mercury

therraometer (J) and also by a rhiladelphia type differ¬ 
ential thermometer (I) (a product of Precision Scientific 
Oo.) both of which were placed in the water bath. These 
thermometers read the temperature of the calorimeter when 
the thermocouple-galvanometer arrangement registered 
zero iS.M.F. The thermometers were read by means of a 
short focus telescope which permitted estimation to 0.01°G 
on the ©.1°C thermometer and to 0.001°C on the differ¬ 
ential thermometer. A deflection of 1mm. on the 
galvanometer scale was equivalent to about 0.003°0 
difference in temperature between the calorimeter and 
the water bath. 

An item was admitted to the calorimeter through 
the tube forming the upper part of the radiation jacket, 
which protruded just above the level of the water bath. 

The cork at the top of this tube W2s removed and the 
door in the top of the calorimeter opened by releasing 
the tension on the thread (F). Then the item, attached 
to a fine thread, was lowered rapidly into the calorimeter. 
The door in the top was then closed and the cork replaced. 

The calorimeter was operated over a range of 
o 

temperature of about 5 0 which was the range of the 
differential thermometer for one setting. The mid point

of the differential thermometer soale corresponded to 
o 

about 21 0. The change in calorimeter temperature during 
a measurement of hjj* was generally from 2 to 4°G. The 
mid point of 21°G was chosen as this was approximately 
the equilibrium temperature between the water bath and 
the surroundings. it was sufficiently low so that the 
effects of evaporation of the water in the calorimeter 
were small enough to neglect. This was substantiated by 
the following observations: If the water bath was kept 

at the same temperature as the calorimeter, by keeping 
the thermocouple-galvanometer deflection zero, the 
temperature of the calorimeter could be kept appreciably 
constant for at least as long as half an hour. This 
could be done at any point over the range of the diff¬ 
erential thermometer. In other words, there was no 
evidence of any drift in the calorimeter temperature. 

After an item had been transferred to the 
calorimeter from the constant temperature bath, the 
temperature of the calorimeter changed at first rather 
rapidly and it was not possible to follow the rapid 
change with the water bath, i.e. the galvanometer 
deflection could not be kept right on zero. Effects 
due to this were partially compensated for by the follow¬ 
ing method: If the galvanometer showed a deflection to

the left, for example, for some time, then when it became 
possible, the temperature of the water bath was so 
adjusted to give the same deflection to the right for 
a comparable time. For this reason, during the making 
of a measurement, the galvanometer deflection oscillated 
about zero with an amplitude as small as it was possible 
to obtain and becoming very small as the rate of change 
of the calorimeter temperature became small, 

fhe heating effect of stirring the calorimeter 
liquid could be quite noticeable if the stirring was 
vigorous. it was found that 100 quick strokes of the 
stirrer would produce about 0.6 calories of heat and 
cause the calorimeter temperature to rise about 0.005°0. 
very little stirring was done during the making of a 
measurement. Stirring of the calorimeter liquid con¬ 
sisted of three or four gentle and slow strokes of the 
stirrer about three times during the course of heat 
exchange. The effect of this stirring was neglected. 

(2) The Constant temperature Bath. 

i'he assembly of the bath is shown in figure 2. 

It was used to heat or cool the samples to the initial 
temperature.lt differed only slightly from the one 
described by F.Zeiler . The bath was a metal tank of 
about one gallon volume which was well insulated and

oontained in a wooden box. For temperatures above 0° 0, 
water was used as the bath liquid while for temperatures 
below this, methyl alcohol was used, uontinual stirring 
of the bath liquid was done by a motor driven propellor 
(D). The temperature of the bath could be thermostat¬ 
ically controlled by a toluene-mercury thermostat (0), 
which operated through a relay, an electric current 
through a heater coil situated at the bottom of the tank. 
For temperatures above room temperature, sufficient 
cooling was supplied by the surroundings, but for lower 
temperatures, coolinj was obtained with a dry-ice acetone 
mixture contained in an adjustable cooling unit (B). 

This unit consisted of two concentric, metal cylinders, 
the outer one being partially filled with acetone and 
j the inner one with a mixture of dry-ice and acetone. It 
! was necessary, of course, to keep adding dry-ice to the 
inner cylinder. The inner cylinder could be raised or 
lowered to provide various rates of cooling. 

There were two sample receptacles, placed side 
by side in the bath. These were made of 7 inch lengths 
of 1 inch diameter brass tubing and one is shown as (A) 
in figure 2.

The temperature of the hath was measured by 

means of a three-junction copper-constantan thermopile 

(not shown in the diagram) which was placed in the hath 

close to the stirrer* This thermopile was calibrated

hy the standard method * , using the dry-ice pdiint, 
the ice point and the steam point on the International 
temperature scale. The reference junction was kept 
at 0°0 in an ice hath. The E.M.E. was measured with a 
Leeds and iNorthrup type K potentiometer and large scale 
graphs were used to convert E.H.E. to temperature. The 
temperature of the hath could he estimated to 0.01 °0. 

The temperature of the hath was raised or 
lowered to a desired point and the thermostat set hy 
turning closed the stopcock at the top of it. The hath 
temperature would oscillate, due to lag in the thermostat 
control, hy about 0.05°0 at the lower temperatures 
(below zero) and hy about 0.01°C for the higher ones, 
hut remained within these limits for several hours. A 
mean value was taken for t^ .

(5) The Cartridges. 

In order to maintain a constant mass of gel 

ti 

during the process of making a determination of h. 

v f 

and to eliminate the possibility of any reaction between 
the sample and the water in the calorimeter, each sample 

of gel was contained in a cartridge 
made of brass (Fig, 3). Six such 
cartridges were used, ihe bottoms 
were soldered on and the tops 
threaded and fitted with cork 
gaskets to give a tight fit. On 
the center of each top was soldered 
a small loop of german silver wire 
to which a fine thread was attached. 
Each cartridge weighed about 18 
grams, had a volume of about SOcc 
and the gasket on each had a mass 
of around 0.1 grams. Since the 
napalm-gasoline samples were to be 
encased in these cartridges during the calorimetric 
measurements, it was necessary to determine a curve of 
h^i ^ or ea °k ^he cartridges. Ihe method used for 
doing this is given on page ig.

(4) '-The Transfer Tubes. 

To prevent loss of heat when transferring an 
item from the constant temperature hath to the calorimeter, 
transfer tubes made of brass were utilized. 0ne of 
these is shown diagramatically in figure 4 with a 
cartridge in place. The whole was placed in the

receptacle in the constant 
temperature bath where it was 
left for at least one hour to 
insure temperature equilibrium 
would be reached. When it 
was desired to transfer the 
cartridge to the calorimeter, 
the transfer tube, containing 
the cartridge, was lifted out of 
the bath by the wire loop at its 
top and carried across to the 
calorimeter. The cork and 

bottom were pulled out and the cartridge lowered into 
the calorimeter by the thread which passed through the 
top of the transfer tube. The transferring process 
took about four seconds.

Jitxperimental Procedure 
Preliminary uperations 

(1 / The thermal Capacity of the Calorimeter Proper* 

The thermal capacity of the calorimeter proper 
was found, experimentally "by adding to the calorimeter, 
j containing 20 to 30 grams of water, a measured mass of 

I distilled water at 0°G* i'he amount of water at 0°0 

\ 

added was from 5 to 8 grams and produced a temperature 
drop of the calorimeter of about 3 °q. its mass was 

determined by weighing the calorimeter and its contents 
before and after addition, This water was taken from an 
ice bath and poured directly into the calorimeter a little 
at a time so that the temperature of the calorimeter 
water bath coul^d be lowered along with the calorimeter* 
five determinations yielded a mean value of 
| 16*5 10.2 cal/°0 for the thermal capacity of the 
calorimeter proper* This result was considered sufficient- 
j ly accurate since the calorimeter would contain from 
100 to 140 grams of water during use.

(2) A Test on the Apparatus 

To test the operation of the apparatus, some 

determinations were made of the specific heat of a 

sample of copper and compared with values for copper 

6 

given by Aronson et. al. • The average value of the 
| specific heat between initial temperatures of approx¬ 
imately +50 and +60 °0 and the final temperature of 
approx. 2l°C was measured. Bronson^s results show 
that the average specific heat of copper over this 
range should vary only slightly for the different 
initial temperatures. 

Table 1 gives the measured values of the average 
specific heat of copper between t i and tf r (S cu ) av .

The mean of the measured values agrees well 
with the results of Aronson, This indicated that the 
apparatus was properly calibrated, The mean deviation 
of the measured quantities showed that the apparatus 
would produce an accuracy of about 1 °/o in a mean of six 
determinations. 

(5) Calibration of Cartridges and Specific Heat of Brass 

values of h^ for the cartridges, measured 
experimentally with the apparatus were found to be of 
no value since the calorimeter did not provide sufficient 
accuracy for a body with as small a thermal capacity as 
that of a cartridge (approx 2 cal/°0 ). The values could 
be calculated more accurately for each cartridge from 
the masses and specific heats of its component parts and 
sufficient accuracy was obtained by considering it to 
consist entirely of brass, with a cork gasket. Each 
cartridge and gasket was carefully weighed. 

The specific heat of a sample of brass was 
measured over the temperature range -60 to +50 °G. The 
specific heat of the brass from which the cartridges 
were composed may have been different from that of the 
sample measured. values of specific heats of various

types of "brass given in tables indicate tnat this 
difference should not be more than 2%. The specific 
heat of the gasket material had been determined by 
bangstroth, G.u, et al (unpublished) as 0.52 cal/gm/°C 
to about 2 % accuracjr. 




Specific Heat of Brass 

The sample, a circular cylinder of about 

150 grams mass was made from a commercial grade of 

t i 

yellow brass. Values of were measured for ten 

0 n 

values of t^ ranging from -50 0 to +50 C. These were 
plotted, against t^, and the result was a smooth 

curve, shown in figure 6. Two empirical formulae were 
fitted to the observed values by the method of least 
squares. The first was of the form: 


Hg£ = A + Bfti+273.16) + C( t.j+273.16 ) 2 +

This was the form suggested by Bronson for copper, 
tungsten and molybdenum. The resulting equation for 
brass was found to be:

in Table II. Both equations fit the observed values 
well* as shown by the tabulated values of 4*

The Specific neat of Brass 
vs.

Equation 2-a is not what would he expected 
for the specific heat at constant pressure of a solid 
metal, such as brass. The accuracy of the instrument 
does not justify this equation. Equation 2-b is the 
better one and gives the specific heat of the brass 
sample to about l$.and was the one used for calculating 
values of h tj - for the cartridges.

Preparation of Samples of Mapaim-Gasoline Gels 

The gasoline used was supplied by the Gasoline 
and Oil Testing laboratory of the Hesearch Council of 
Alberta and had the following specifications according 
to their tests: 


Sulphur. 


Preformed gum..... . 


Potential gum. 


Freezing point. 


Yapour pressure.... 


Tetraethyl lead..., 


Octane rating. 


Gravity. 


Specific gravity... 



The gels were prepared by mixing Napalm with this gasoline 
in the correct proportions and stirring mechanically 
for half an hour. The per cent concentration (C) of 
a gel is the mass, in grams, of Napalm in 100 grams 
of gel. Four gels were prepared with the following 

concentrations: 5.0 °/o, 7.5$, 10*0$, 12.5$. 


Four of the cartridges were filled with these

gels, another with gasoline and the sixth with Napalm. 

An air space was left in each cartridge to allow for 
expansion. Each cartridge contained about 15 grams of 
a sample. These served for all the measurements made. 

There was no appreciable leakage of the samples 
from the cartridges except for the gasoline. r J?he mass 
of this item decreased very slowly due to the gasoline 
vapour escaping through the top of the cartridge. Each 
cartridge was weighed before placing it in the pre¬ 
heating bath however and thus any small change in the 
mass of the sample could be accounted for. There was 
no appreciable change in the mass of the contents of 
any cartridge during the process of making a thermal 
measurement. There was never any evidence of water 
penetrating the interior of the cartridges. 

Measurements on the Napaim-Gasoline Mixtures 

Measurements of hJi were made on the six 
t f 

cartridges plus their contents for initial temperatures 
ranging from -50°C to+50°C. Values of h]^ were cal¬ 
culated for each cartridge for the required initial 
temperatures, as described on page 16 and then values

The results are shown in Table III as observed 
t i 

values. Graphs of H vs, t^ were plotted for each 
mixture (Figure 6) and empirical relations of the form 
^21 * ^ 4 Bt^ 4 were fitted to each of the 

curves by the method of least squares. The reason for 

choosing a relation of this form was as follows: 

t i 

large scale plots of against t^ were made and the 
best fit curve drawn visually. Values of specific heat 
were determined at various temperatures by measuring 
the slopes of these curves at different points. The 
resulting specific heat values indicated no more than 
a linear relation between specific heat and temperature. 

The equations found by the method of least 
squares were as follows, where (H**prefers to a 
mixture of concentration c%.

error of A 0 will "be that of the t^ coefficients of

he twice that of the t± coefficient. Errors due to the 
uncertainty of the specific heat of the brass of the 
cartridges, which will not be a random error, will bring 
the error in A 0 to about 1 °/o and the error in B c to 
about 10%. i'he total error in S 0 will therefore be 
about 2%. 

fhe coefficients A Q and B c of equations 
4-a) --4-f) were plotted against the concentration c. 
iThe result is shown in figure 7. 

B 0 showed no significant trend toward 
variation with concentration so a mean value of 
0.00092 cal/gm/°0 was taken. 

i'he curve of A Q and hence of S 0 8 g a i ns t 
concentration should be a smooth curve and moreover 
it is unlikely that it should have any inflection points, 
inspection of the observed values of A 0 in figure 7 
points toward a linear relation between A Q and c. In 
view of the large gap between the first five points and 
the sixth (A^qq), a relation of the form A 0 = a - be 
was f6und by the method of least srquares, using the

5-a)... A 0 = 0.479 - 0.00058 c cal/gm/°0. 

®&is equation is good for values of c between 0 and 
12.5 inclusive and the variation of any of the observed 
values from the one given by this relation is within 
the accuracy of the measured A c . 

Extrapolation of equation 5-a) to a value 
of c = 100 yields a value of ApoO ~ 0.421 cal/gm/°0. 

This value agrees very well with the observed one of 
0.425 cal/gm/°O f to within its experimental error. 

I This indicates that a linear relation between A 0 and c 
exists for the whole range of concentration and using 
all the observed values of A c this turns out to be: 

5-b)... . A o = 0.479 - 0.00054 c cal/gm/ 0 0. 

Because of its remoteness from the other points, A-^qq 
should have a marked effect on the slope of this 
equation. Equations 5-a) and 5-b) however are in excellent 
agreement. 

The resulting equation for the specific 
heat, using 5-b) is: 

6) S 0 r 0.479 - 0.00054c ♦ 0.00092t cal/gm/°0.

Discussion 

i'he specific heat at constant pressure of 
gasoline, napalm and of gels produced by mixtures of 
the two may be represented to an accuracy of 2ffo over 
the temperature range -50° Q to 50°0 by the relation: 

S 0 - 0.479 - 0.00054c ♦ 0.00092t cal/gm/°0. 
Where c is the u /o mass of napalm in the mixture and 
t is the temperature in °G. 

imo change of phase occurs over this 
temperature range. 

I'he results show no significant variation 
of the temperature coefficient with concentration 
for the concentrations measured. 

i'he equation above is linear in c and 
indicates that the mixtures form ideal solutions, 
i.e. ones in which no special force of attraction 
exists between the components of the solution. 

Ideal solutions are most likely formed from components 

which are very similar chemically. Napalm and 

gasoline have very different chemical structures 

and it is unlikely that they should form such a solution 

together. What is probable is that the napalm in 

the mixtures is in the colloid state, with the

gasoline adhering to the colloidal particles, fhe 

fact that the mixtures form gels upholds this. In 

such a system, there would he little interaction 

between the molecules of the two components and it 

would behave in the manner observed. 

fhe specific heats are stated to be "at 

constant pressure". fhe pressure on a sample did not 

necessarily remain constant during the process of 

making a thermal measurement, since it was encased 

in a cartridge. However, it is well known that the 

specific heats of liquids and solids in general are 

8 

extremely insensitive to changes in pressure. Any 
such effects would be negligible so that the expression 
"specific heats at constant pressure* is applicable 
to the results. 

fhe equation for the specific heat of brass 

over the temperature range -50°C to 50°0 was found to 

be: S t)rass = °* 08 85 ♦ 0.00038t cal/gm/°0. 

Values calculated from this relation agree with those
