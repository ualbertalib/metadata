PREFACE 


More accurately known as the bloodsucking rather than 
the biting flies, the insects dealt with in this paper include 
the mosquitoes, the blackflies or buffalo gnats, and the horse- 
flies and deer flies. Collectively these insects cause a 
great deal of discomfort to man over very large areas of Canada; 
they cause sickness and death in his domestic animals and birds, 
and sometimes even the death of human infants, and more rarely 
of adults. 

The work recorded in this paper was carried out mainly 
during the springs and summers of 1947 and 1948, on behalf of 
the Defence Research Board of the Canadian Government Department 
of National Defence. The primary object was to provide information 
which would enable some mitigation of the nuisance of biting flies 
to personnel of the armed forces, and to others whose duties lie 
in regions heavily infested by these insects. 

Both in 1947 and in 1948 a Canadian team of personnel from 
the Division of Entomology and from the Defence Research Board, 
and aU.S, team from the U.S. Bureau of Entomology and Plant 
Quarantine working on behalf of the Surgeon General, Department 
of the U.S. Army, were in close cooperation. Generous assistance 
was received from a great number of other persons and organisations 
at various times. While the present author was primarily 
responsible for all the work reported hereafter in detail, for 
the sake of coherence and continuity brief reference has been 
made to work of other members of the parties. I would like to 
record my appreciation of the generosity of Mr. W.C.McDuffie 
and Mr. H.F.Cross of the U.S.Bureau of Entomology and Plant 
Quarantine in allowing me to refer to the as yet unpublished 
results of their work on mosquito larvicides and on repellent 
chemicals, and of Dr. C.R.Twinn of the Division of Entomology, 
Ottawa in permitting the use of data on the species and succession 
of species of mosquitoes and blackflies in 1947. Acknowledgements 
are also due to Dr. Alan Stone and Dr. Harold Morrison of the 
U.S. Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, to Mr.G.E.Shewe-11 
of the Division of Entomology, Ottawa, Professor E.B.Mains of 
the University of Michigan, Professor E.A.Steinhaus of the 
University of California, and Professor T.Fetch of King's Lynn, 
England, to Professor E.H.Strickland, Professor B.H.Moss, 

Professor J.H.Whyte, Professor R.B.Miller, and Mr.E.Moore for 
assistance in the identification of specimens in their respective 
fields. Also to Professors L.A.Thorssen and G.WQGovier for 
assistance on matters relating to the measurement of stream flow 
and the flow of insecticidal fluids, and to Professor M.LI.Cantor 
and Mrs P.A.Wight for the analysis of nectar samples; to the 
administrative staff of the military camp at Churchill and 
Mr.A.C.Jones of the Defence Research Board for countless services 
which I had no right to expect. Finally, and perhaps most of 
all, to each and every member of the Canadian and U.S. parties 
at Churchill in 1947 and 1948 for their unfailing cooperation 
at literally all times.

ABSTRACT 


The species of blood-sucking flies of the families 
Culicidae, Simuliidae, and Tabanidae occurring in the vicinity 
of Churchill, Manitoba are listed. Some notes on the 
succession of species, larval habitats, and life histories 
of these species at Churchill are given, and some investigations 
into adult feeding habits, behaviour, and a new approach to 
the study of flight range are reported on. The influence of 
these insects on other organisms, and especially on man and 
his activities are considered in some detail. Experiments 
are described on the toxicity of some of the newer insecticides 
to all stages of mosquitoes in the field, and to the immature 
stages of blackflies under laboratory and field conditions. 

The possibility of utilising these materials for practical 
control measures is considered. Methods of personal protection 
from all three groups of insects are discussed and suggestions 
are made for improvements in these. 40 line drawings and 
photographs illustrate the text, and data are presented in 
8 tables and 7 graphs. The paper concludes with 85 references, 
a selected bibliography, and appendices listing the birds 
of the area and describing equipment for the routine 
application of insecticides to streams.

1. THE CHURCHILL ENVIRONMENT 


1.1. Climatic Conditions. 

Churchill is situated at approximately latitude 59° 

N. and longitude 94° W., on the western shore of Hudson Bay, 
at the mouth of the Churchill River. It lies inside the 
Sub-arctic area, about 170 miles from its northern boundary. 

In winter Churchill is one of the coldest spots in 

northern Canada. The snowfall is light, and high winds off 

snow cover 

Hudson Bay prevent this forming much persisteny, but cause 
drifting which may bury buildings. Very high wind chill figures 
are recorded, winds of 40 m.p.h. with temperatures down to 
-7Q°F being not uncommon. The summer weather however, may be 
unpleasantly hot and humid. 

During the periods of entomological work at Churchill, 
daily weather summaries consisting of six-hourly readings of 
relative humidity, temperature, wind direction and speed, 
barometric pressure, and extent of cloudiness, and daily records 
of precipitation, were kindly provided by the Department of 
Transport meteorological officer. Supplementary records of 
special and local conditions in connection with specific items 
of investigation are given with the items to which they refer. 

An analysis of the general weather records shows that 
the average temperature for the 87 day period from May 16 to 
August 10, 1947 was 47°F, the averages for May (part), June, 
July, and August (part) being 24.5, 44.8, 58.3, and 54.5°F

respectively. The range of temperature was 73 Fahrenheit 
degrees, from a low of 9°F on May 17 to a high of 84°F on June 
20 and July 12. The relative humidity was high throughout the 
period, but particularly so before the thaw. The average figure 
for the whole period is 85.5 per cent; that for May (part) is 
91.5 per cent and that for the remaining period separately 84 
per cent. Relative humidity figures had a range of 57 per cent 
from a low of 43 on June 18 to 100 per cent on several days; 
daily averages ranged from 63 on June 19 to 100 per cent. No 
definite trends appear in the figures for barometric pressure. 

Wind speed showed a slight general decrease from May 
to June and July, followed by an increase early in August. The 
average wind speed for the whole period was 12.6 m.p.h.; 
averages for each of the months separately were 14.3, 11.8, 

11.9, and 14.7 m.p.h. respectively. The range of wind speed 
was from calm on May 18, July 13 and 16, and on August 3, to 
45 m.p.h. on May 24 and 36 m.p.h. on August 6. The question of 
wind direction and the combination of this with wind speed has 
been treated in greater detail in view of the possible impact 
of these factors on the shift of insect populations, especially 
those of mosquitoes. Figure 1 shows the frequency with which 
the wind blew from each direction; apart from the scarcity of 
E and SE winds, there is no well marked trend although NE, and 
W to NW winds were somewhat more common. Figure 2 shows the 
mean wind speed for each direction; the scarcity of E and SE 
winds is to some extent compensated by their greater mean speeds. 
Figure 3 represents the product of mean speed and frequency,

and gives a picture of the general trend in the movement of 
air at Churchill throughout the whole period; the vector sum, 
representing a mean speed of 2.0 m.p.h. on a bearing of 311° 
(approximately NW ), is indicated by the solid column. Figure 
4 gives the same data as figure 3, but covers the period of 
significant adult mosquito activity only; from dune 20 to July 
20. There was a much clearer preponderance of HE wind during 
this period, but the vector sum represents a mean speed of only 
0.15 m.p.h. on a bearing of 39° (approximately NE ). 

The total precipitation during the period was 5.18 
inches water equivalent, of which 0.08 inches was in the form 
of snow. This precipitation was distributed between the four 
months as follows: 0.18, 0.91, 0.95, and 2.90 inches, the 
maximum rainfall on any one day being 1.63 inches on August 5. 
There was measurable precipitation on 36 of the 87 days; on seven 
of the 16 days in May, ten days in June, 12 days in July, and 
seven of the ten days in August. 

Observations of cloud conditions during the hours of 
daylight may be summarised as follows: 53 per cent overcast, 

40 per cent partly cloudy, 7 per cent clear. 

The ice went out of the Churchill River on June 20 
1947; the expected date for this occurrence being that of the 
spring tides closest to June 15 (5), the season at this stage 
was nearly a week later than normal. A comparison of average 
temperatures for June and July of this year with similar 
averages obtained over a number of years (6) supports the 
impression obtained from residents that by the end of July the

season was normally advanced. 

Weather data for 1948 are still accumulating so that 
a complete analysis is not yet possible. The season was very 
much earlier to start with, but cold weather early in June 
retarded development until by early ^Fuly conditions were 
comparable with those obtaining at this time in 1947 although 
very much drier. 


1.2. Other Ecological Conditions. 

Within a radius of a few miles of Churchill is to be 
found a great variety of terrain, including spruce-larch forest, 
muskeg, tundra, tundra-meadow, birch-willow scrub, low limestone- 
gravel and granite ridges, tidal flats, and sand dunes. It is 
a zone of transition from forest to tundra and supports a varied 
insect fauna including species of biting flies typical of the 
forest and of the plain and of the sub-arctic and the arctic. 

The northern fringe of the sub-arctic forest extends 
to within a short distance of Churchill. In this region it is 
rather open and swampy and consists chiefly of stunted trees 
rarely exceeding 50 feet. The forest floor is for the most 
part soft and spongy underfoot, very tiring to walk on and often 
treacherous to the unwary. 

The tundra and tundra-meadow in the area extends from 
the scattered tree growth along the uneven margins of the forest

to the shore of Hudson Bay. The predominant vegetation consists 
of lichens, coarse grasses and mosses, hut other flowering 
plants also abound, their successive blooming adding a touch 
of colour and beauty to the otherwise rather bleak landscape. 
Where soil conditions are favourable, dwarf spruce grow singly 
or in small clumps. In exposed situations overlooking Hudson 
Bay the branches of these trees grow out only on the south side 
of the trunk; or the whole tree may have a prostrate form, 
spreading out in a mat a few inches above the surface of the 
rock as if to take full advantage of the meagre heat reflected 
from this. In protected situations such as along the borders 
of streams, dwarf birch and willow grow, in places forming 
dense thickets. 

Large numbers of aquatic and wading birds nest and 
raise their young in the marshes and swamps of the Churchill 
region. Common among them are ducks, geese, gulls, terns, 
sandpipers, plovers, curlews, and ptarmigan. Among them, too, 
is that familiar habitue of suburban gardens, the American robin. 
Mammals are much less in evidence. A few caribou were seen 
near the Churchill River and along the shore; also two porcupine 
in the forest and a number of larch trees stripped of bark by 
their feeding. Burrows and trails of small rodents are numerous, 
but their numbers were at a low ebb in 1947 (14,52), the animals 
themselves were rarely seen and, in spite of several attempts to 
trap them, only three lemming were captured. From these, 2 males 
and 6 females of the flea Megabothris groenlandicus Wahlgren 
were taken (det. G.P.Holland). In 1948 mice and lemming were 
more numerous, and rabbits and the fresh tracks of wolves were

seen. Schools of white whales enter the mouth of the Churchill 
River after the ice goes out, and numbers of these are killed 
for their meat and oil by local Indians and trappers. Of fish, 
pike, grayling, and suckers abound in the larger streams and 
serve as a major part of the diet of sled dogs during their 
enforced summer idleness, as well as being preserved for 
winter use. Sticklebacks were much more numerous in 1948 
than in 1947. No reptiles were seen, but frogs were common 
in the marshes, and specimens collected were identified by 
C.L.Patch, of the National Museum, Ottawa, as the northern 
wood frog, Rana sylvatica cantabrigensis . 

Drainage is generally poor in the Churchill region 
because much of the terrain is low-lying and the ground is 
permanently frozen a short distance beneath the surface. As a 
result, innumerable shallow pools form on the tundra and in the 
forest during the spring thaw and serve as breeding places for 
the countless hordes of mosquitoes that appear on the wing in 
late June and July. What drainage there is occurs largely 
through numerous streams that flow into the Churchill River 
or into Hudson Bay. From these streams and from the rapids of 
the river, vast numbers of blackflies emerge and, with the 
mosquitoes, and the bloodsucking tabanids that develop in the 
forest, plague man and beast throughout the short summer. 

The biological violence of this short summer is a most 
striking feature, to one accustomed to the living continuum of 
the tropics, and can perhaps be conveyed best by a rapid survey 
of the sequence of events as observed in 1947.

consisted of springtails on the melting snow and ice, sometimes 
in such abundance on trails that they are reported to impede 
the passage of sleds, and various small flies, mainly 
dolichopodids and mycetophilids on the surface and at the 
margins of pools. 

By June 5 the smaller streams were beginning to flow, 
although ice remained at the bottom. Stonefly nymphs, previously 
solidly frozen, were active inside pockets of water formed 
inside blocks of ice presumably by radiation absorbed by their 
own dark bodies. Pools at this time contained many chironomid 
and dytiscid larvae and gerrid nymphs, and birds were courting 
on the marshes. Flowers of the mountain saxifrage, Baxifraga 
oppositifolia , the first plant to be found in bloom were 
collected on June 15, and by this time dung flies and bumble 
bees were flying, and most birds were sitting on eggs. 

By June 22, larch, willows and birch were coming into 
leaf, and many ericaceous plants, especially species of Ledum , 
Rhododendron , and Andromeda were flowering. Chironomid adults 
were locally numerous, and well grown caddis larvae abundant in 

pools and streams. 

. t '; 

The first week of July brought out the first families 
of ducklings and ptarmigan, many more plants were newly in 
flower* the sweet coltsfoot, Petasites sp. conspicuous amongst 
them, and arctic heather, Dryas integrifolia , several times as 
abundant as any other flower. Among insects adult dragonflies 
and caddis flies were on the wing. 

The replacement of arctic heather by cotton grass, 
Arlophorum sp., as the most abundant flower marked the middle

of July; by this time the eggs of plovers and terns had 
hatched, and half grown tadpoles were to be found in many of 
the pools. Most groups of insects were represented by the 
adult stage, those recently emerged including several species 
of mayflies, weevils, and some syrphid and trypetid flies. 

By the third week of July the peak of adult insect 
activity was over, and the eggs of a great many species were 
to be found in, and at the verges of, the now much diminished 
pools and streams. The ox-eye daisy, Ch ry santhemum arcticus, 
and the conspicuous fireweeds, Spilobium spp., were coming into 
flower, the latter becoming extremely abundant. 

An excellent account of the invertebrate ecology 
of Churchill is given by McClure (38).

2. THE SPECIES AMD SUCCESSIOM OF SPECIES 
OF BITING FLIES AT CHURCHILL 

2.1. The Mosquitoes (Culicidae: Diptera). 

Eight species of Aedes and two species of Culiseta 
have been identified among the specimens collected or reared 
in the Churchill area during 1947. No other genus of the 
sub-family Culicinae was represented, but the predaceous 
larvae of three genera of non-biting mosquitoes of the sub¬ 
family Chaoborinae, namely, Eucorethra . Mochlonvx and Chaoboras . 
were fairly common in the Culicine breeding pools. Unfortunately, 
none were reared to the adult stage, but a male and a female 
collected from a mating swarm at 4 p.m. on July 24 belonged to 
the species Chaoborus nyblaei Zett. 

The two species of ‘Culiseta represented are C. alas - 
kaensis Ludl., and C. impatiens Wlk. They are not abundant in 
the area, only small numbers of overwintered females being 
seen or captured during the month of June. No males or 
aquatic stages of the species were found. 

The species of Aedes definitely determined include 
A. nigripes Zett., A. punctor &by., A. nearticus Cyan., and 
A. communis Deg., occurring probably in that order of abundance; 

A. campestri s D.&K., and A. excrucians Wlk., less abundant, but 
numerous and widespread; A. flavescens Mtlll., and A. cinereus 
Mgn., relatively few and localised in occurrence. 

In 1948 several further species of Chaoborinae were 
taken. Males and females of Mochlonyx culiclformis DeG. were

reared from pupae collected in the forest on July 17. Other 
material has yet to be identified and may contain new species. 
The larvae of Culiseta alaskaensi s were collected and reared 
to maturity in a field insectary. 

In the genus Aedes two species were recorded for the 
first time in 1948. These were Aedes fitchii Felt & Young, 
and A. spencerii Theo., neither of them common, but the latter 
taken in most interesting circumstances. Only three specimens 
were taken, all of them inside army vehicles at the beginning 
of June, well before any other species of the genus had emerged 
at Churchill either in 1947 or 1948. The weather at this time 
was unusually warm, and winds had been continuously SSE at 
speeds up to 22 m.p.h.; immature stages of A. spenc e rii have 
never been taken at Churchill. It is most probable that these 
specimens came in from further south, either wind borne, or on 
aircraft or trains. The fact that the vehicles in which they 
were taken were all within easy access of both the airport 
and the railway station, suggests the latter explanation. 

A. specerii is known to be a migratory species, and data on 
the northern limits of its breeding would be very interesting. 

Immature stages of A. cinereus were taken for the 
first time in 1948, collected in the forest 12 miles south 
of Churchill. Matheson identified A. nigromaculis Ludl. among 
the mosquitoes collected here by McClure in 1936-7, but no 
specimens of this species have been obtained. 

All the species of Aedes found in the Churchill area 
overwinter in the egg stage. In 1947 larvae began to hatch out 
in small numbers in snow pools in sheltered places on the

tundra at the beginning of June, when snow and ice were still 
prevalent in the area. By the middle of June, when the snow 
was largely gone from the open country, the larval population 
of several abundant species was nearing its peak in pools in 
the open and among the sparse tree growth along the margins 
of the forest. These species were A. nigripes , A. punctor . 
and A. nearcticus . Early stage larvae of A. excr u cians had 
also begun to appear. In the forest the first larvae of 
A. communis were found hatching in favoured snow pools on June 
9, when nearly two-thirds of the forest floor was still covered 
with fast-melting snow. 

Pupation of A. nigripes began on June 16, and A. 
punctor on June 17, the first adults emerging on June 20, and 
June 21, respectively. Emergence of A. nearcticus started on 
June 22, and that of A. communis in the forest on June 24. 
Periodical collections indicate that these four dark-legged 
species are the dominant ones in the Churchill region. 

Towards the end of June emergence was general. During 
the early part of July pupae were still common, but larvae 
were becoming increasingly hard to find. By July 3, tremendous 
numbers of mosquitoes were on the wing, and they continued to 
increase until a peak of abundance was reached during the second 
week of July (Fig. 5). The pest species were augmented by adults 
of A. campestri s on July 5, A. excrucians on July 9, A. cinereus 
on July 13, and A. flavescens on July 20. By the third week of 
July, however, a definite falling off in abundance and aggress¬ 
iveness of the mosquito population was apparent, and by early 
August, their numbers had reached relatively small proportions.

The adult females of the four common species A. 
nigripes . A, nearcticus , A. punctor , and A, communis t are 
difficult to separate without associated males or last larval 
exuviae, which makes specific biological observations difficult, 
especially late in the season when much of the vestiture of 
scales has been lost. The first two species are rather hairier 
and are characteristic of the tundra; the last two smoother 
and typical forest species. A. punctor , however, is more 
mobile, and hence more often found in the open than is A. 
communis, which at least when newly emerged tends to remain 
very close to its larval habitat (62). 

Typical specimens of A. nigripes are much larger than 
those of A. nearcticus and have a relatively longer proboscis, 
the ratio of proboscis length to wing length being about 0.84 
in the former and only 0.73 in the latter. The occasional 
specimens of A. nearcticus which have small sub-lateral patches 
of white scales on the mesonotum can be identified at once in 
the field. The ratio of proboscis length to wing length in 
A. punctor is 0.7 and in A. communis 0.64; typically, the former 
can be recognised by the lateral expansions of the basal bands 
of white scales on the abdominal terga, and by the tendency of 
the black scales on the venter to form a median stripe instead 
of transverse bands as in typical A. communis specimens. A. 
communis sometimes develops in incredible numbers in quite 
small woodland pools. Adults emerging from these pools are 
much smaller than normal, presumably as a result of severe 
overcrowding in the immature stage. It is interesting to 
note that Mellanby (40) reports A. punctor as overwintering

in the larval stage at latitude 69°N in Finnish Lapland. 

A. cinereus is a small, dark mosquito of the forest, 
the smallest in the Churchill fauna, and the only distinctive 
black-legged species. It is late emerging, non-migratory, 
and has a rather short proboscis. 

A. campestris , the commonest of the species with the 
tarsal segments ringed with white scales, is a most attractively 
marked mosquito with its mixed black and white scales on the 
wings, bottle green eyes, and well marked pattern of almost 
silver and gold scales on the roesonotum. Late in the season 
in 1947 this species was more troublesome than any other in 
the military camp itself. 

A. excrucians is next in abundance to A. camoestris . 

It is a large dark distinctive mosquito, late emerging, and 
according to Hearle (26) does not travel far from its breeding 
grounds. 

A. flavescens , a large yellow species, with white 
banded tarsi, is a late appearing mosquito, individually 
conspicuous, but of comparatively minor importance. Its life 
history is fully dealt with by Hearle (27). In 1948 this 
species put in a rather unexpected early appearance before the 
end of June, after which there was an interval of nearly two 
weeks during which no specimens were taken, before it reappeared 
about the middle of July. This would suggest that under 
certain conditions of rainfall the larvae may hatch out in 
two broods. 

Culiseta alaskaensis and C. impatiens are large 
mosquitoes with white banded tarsi and black spots on the

wings; alaskaen sis having the more distinct wing spots, and 
being the largest mosquito in the Churchill fauna. These 
species both overwinter as adults -and are consequently the 
first mosquitoes to appear in the spring, flying and biting 
some two weeks before the earliest species of Aedes emerge. 
Dr. Douglas Leechman of the National Museum, Ottawa, quotes 
an entry in Peter Fidler's Journal for April 4, 1792, which 

may be taken to refer to a species of Culiseta . This entry, 

which reads as follows, was made near Fort Fitzgerald, 
northwest of Lake Athabaska, just south of the northern 
boundary of Alberta: 

"Put up about •§- mile above the head of the rapids amongst 

a deal of old Large Poplars we made a good fire & soon 

after we were all very much surprised to see numbers of 
muskettoes flying about altho the Snow was more than 10 
inches deep on the ground every where on examination we 
found that betwixt the Bark of the Poplars and the tree, 
of the old Dry wood there was a large open space which 
was full of muskettoes that have been in that situation 
all vdnter in some places they was in large cakes of 2 
Inches thick the heat of the fire had invigorated them 
so as to be able to fly about in the manner before 
mentioned”

2.2. The Blackflies (Simuliidae: Diptera). 

Previous to 1947, blackflies had been collected at 
Churchill in 1934, by A.M.Heydweiller, and in 1936 by H.E.McClure. 
These collections were examined and identified by Twinn. 

Heydweiller*s collection, all females except where 
otherwise indicated, included six species which are listed as 
follows, together with a statement of the numbers of specimens 
and the period during which they were collected: 

Simulium venustum Say, 121, July 11 - Aug.30 

S. vittatum Zett., 34 (plus 4 males) July 8 - Aug.15 

S. ottawaense Twinn, 26, July 10 - Aug.15 

S. arcticum Mall. 4, July 30 

S. perissum D.&S., 4, July 30 and Aug.11 

Eusimulium baffinense palens Twinn, 2, July 30. 

McClure's collection was made up of many hundreds of 
female specimens, mostly S. venustum and S. vittatum , but also 
including four specimens each of S. arcticum (July 11 - 23) and 
B. subexcisum Edw. (July 11). 

Thus these two collections were comprised of seven 
species. Among the specimens collected or reared during 1947, 
eight species are represented, five of them being additional to 
those collected by Heydweiller and McClure. The eight species 
taken in 1947 are as follows:

Busimuliu m latipes Mgn 
Busimulium species A, 

Busimulium species B. 

Busimulium species C. 

Daring 1948, at the time of writing all species taken 
previously had been collected as adults or reared from collected 
pupae except 5. arcticum , and E. baffinense palens . In addition 
several specimens resembling S, boreale Mall., specimens of 
what appears to be another new species, close to S. venusturn , 
and the first male specimens of E. aureum were taken, making 
a total of 14 species collected in this region. 

The fact that no pupae or male specimens of S. arcticum 
have been taken suggests that this species, like Aedes spencerii , 
is unable to overwinter at Churchill, but migrates in from 
breeding areas to the south and west. This species is noted 
for appearing sporadically in very large numbers at almost 
incredible distances from its breeding grounds (46). 

Simuliurn venusturn is the most abundant of the black- 
flies in the Churchill area and the most important pest of man. 
The immature stages were found in all bodies of running water 
examined wherever blackfiies were developing, including drainage 
ditches, rills, larger streams, and rivers. 

The first pupae were discovered in 1947 on July 3, in 
a small stream in the camp area and adults commenced emerging 
on July 5. Observations on several other streams indicated 
that emergence was general in the area on this and subsequent 
days. Females were first captured attacking humans on July 8, 
by which date mosquitoes were reaching their peak. By mid July,

the numbers of blackflies of this species were tremendous, 
especially in wooded areas, and the streams contained heavy 
infestations of eggs, larvae, and pupae, a condition that 
persisted until early August, when observations ceased. 

Further south, S. venustu rn passes the winter in the 
larval stage (60) but in the Churchill region it is believed 
to overwinter in the egg stage, except possibly in the Churchill 
River, which continues to flow all winter beneath the ice. 

The smaller streams were frozen solid in the winter of 1946-7 
and thawed out during the first week of June. At this time 
small numbers of dead pupae and cocoons of S. venusturn from 
the previous season were found attached to stones and to 
vegetation in several of the streams, but no living pupae or 
larvae were seen, and young larvae did not begin to appear 
until after the middle of June, two to three weeks before 
the first adults of this species were on the wing. 

There appear to be at least two generations of 
S. venustu rn at Churchill and probably three or a partial third, 
the generations overlapping, so that after the first adults 
emerge all stages may be found together throughout the short 
summer season. Apparently development continues until the 
streams freeze up. According to an official of the Churchill 
grain elevator, adult blackflies are present until the snow 
flies. 

Female specimens of S. vittatum were collected 
east of the Churchill River, in the open, and in the woods 
south of Churchill on June 21, 1947. These were the first 
blackflies on the wing, and presumably developed from larvae

that had overwintered in the rapids beneath the ice in the 
Churchill River. The ice went out on June 20. Pupal skins 
of this species were found on submerged rocks in the rapids 
close to the shore line, at Mosquito Point, on July 9. The 
pupae were not found in any of the numerous smaller streams 
examined. 

Edwards identified material reported by Longstaff (72) 
as attracted to, and apparently biting man in enormous numbers 
at latitude 64° 40* N on the west coast of Greenland, as this 
species. There was no evidence of this species attacking man 
at Churchill. 

The material referred to as Simuliurn sp. consisted of 
two pupal cases in cocoons collected on a stone taken from the 
Churchill River rapids at Mosquito Point on July 9. The cocoons 
are boot-shaped, and the respiratory tufts of the pupae are 
short and comprised of 16 filaments. The material may represent 
an undescribed form. 

Eusimuliu m latipes was found in 1947 in a shallow, 
stony, rather swift little stream that has its source in a 
pool in the camp area and flows through open woods and marshy 
meadows towards the Churchill River. Numerous well-grown 
larvae and small numbers of pupae were found on*stones and 
grasses in the stream on July 3, and were the first blackfly 
pupae seen in the area. In 1948 specimens were obtained from 
a variety of smaller streams. This species, which is widespread 
in Europe was first recorded in North America near Hull, Que., 
by Twinn (60). It apparently has only one generation a year. 

Six females of Eusimulium aureum were collected on

July 24 and 25, and August 2, 1947, but no pupae were found. 

In 1948 specimens were taken throughout the later part of the 
season and in various localities. This attractive species is 
widely distributed in North America. 

Both sexes of Eusimuliu m species A were obtained 
from pupae taken from three streams, two draining into Hudson 
Bay and one into the Churchill River. Emergence of adults was 
actively proceeding from one of these streams on July 6, and 
may have commenced a day or two earlier, as on this date empty 
pupal skins greatly outnumbered pupae. Newly emerged specimens 
were crawling up the vegetation in large numbers and many of 
the flies were also on the wing. Emergence of this species 
from the other two streams was still in progress about a week 
later, and females were taken on the wing on July 25. This 
is apparently an undescribed species; the pupa has short, bushy 
respiratory tufts, each consisting of 25 - 30 filaments, 
arranged mostly in pairs on short stalks arising from a common 
base. The cocoon is of indefinite shape. 

Pupae and pupal cases of both sexes of Eusimulium 
species B were taken from Goose River on July 8 and from stones 
in the Churchill River rapids at Mosquito point, on July 9. 
one pupa was found in collections from Eastern Creek on July 12. 

Eusi mulium species C is represented by one female 
which emerged by July 12 from a pupa collected on July 6. The 
respiratory tufts of this pupa each consist of numerous filaments 
(30 - 40) branching out on short stalks from the dorsal surface 
of a stout elongate main trunk. Further material of these 
species was obtained in 1948.

2.3. The Horseflies and Deer flies (Tabanidae: Diptera). 

Only a relatively casual survey of this group of 
insects was possible, the study taking second place to that on 
mosquitoes and blackflies and to control experiments on these 
two groups. The material obtained in 1947 consists of specimens 
collected during the course of that work, and is comprised 
entirely of adult females, no males or immature stages being 
taken. 

These specimens represent five or six species of the 
genus Hybomitr a and four species of Chrysops . These species, 
arranged within the genera in order of abundance are: Hybomitra 
affinis Kby., H. septentrionali s Loew, H. metabol a McD., 

H . zonali s Kby., H. hearlei Philip, and H. gracilipalpis Hine; 
and Chrysops carbonaria Wlk., C . furcata Wlk., C. nigripes Zett., 
and C. frigida O.S. 

The succession and relative abundance of these species 
as indicated by the material available are shown in figure 6. 

The first specimens taken were H. metabola , collected on July 5. 
Three independent reports were received of men being bitten 
prior to this (July 3) by flies which, from their descriptions, 
could have been tabanids. The first specimens of H. affinis 
were taken on July 6. This rapidly became the dominant species, 
and remained so until the middle of August (when observations 
were terminated) although in close competition with H. septe n¬ 
trionalis from the third week of July onwards. 


The earliest species of Chrysop s to appear was

G. carbonari a which was first taken on July 12. This was 
the most abundant species of the genus until towards the end 
of July, when it gradually gave place to a predominance of 
C . fur ca t a., which, with C. frigida and C. ni gripes , made its 
first appearance a few days after G. carbona ria. 

Hybomitra zonalis with its striking yellow and black 
abdomen was remarkable in that it put in an early appearance 
on July 10, but was not taken again thereafter. All the specimens 
of this species were collected in the camp area. 

In 1948, all the species taken in 1947 were again 
recorded, and in addition the tabanine species H. sexfasciat a 
Hine, and a species close to H . hinei Johnson; and the 
pangonine species C. mitis O.S. Only two or three specimens 
of the first two species were taken, but C. mitis was found 
to be quite abundant late in the season in the forest 25 miles 
south of Churchill. Many males were collected, including 
those of H .gracilipalpis , taken in copula, and one specimen 
believed to be H. septentrionalis ; the male of this species 
has not yet been adequately described. A number of larvae 
were also collected and are being reared. II. zonalis was 
much more abundant in 1948, and several specimens were taken 
as late as July 24, in the forest 25 miles south of Churchill. 

Dr. H.H.Schwardt identified H. illot a O.S. and H. 
rhombica O.S. among the material collected at Churchill by 
McClure in 1936 and 1937. No specimens of either of these 
species have been taken in this work.

2.4. Other Biting Insects. 

Apart from the three families already dealt with, 
the only group of blood-sucking flies of any potential 
significance at Churchill is the family Heliidae (Ceratopogonidae). 
These insects are commonly known as the biting midges, or 
no-see-ums, and present a somewhat different problem to the 
previous groups, since their extremely small size permits 
them to penetrate the ordinary protective nets and screens. 

In 1947 no-see-ums were very scarce and only three 
or four specimens were secured. In 1948 they were much more 
numerous, and in a really favourable year, they might well be 
quite troublesome. Several species of the genus Culicoides 
were taken, but have not yet been identified; the taxonomy 
of the group is difficult, and has received very little attention. 

No species of the family Ehagionidae, the snipe flies, 
has been recorded biting man at Churchill. One member of the 
1948 party however received a significant bite from a spider 
while in a forested area.

3. OBSERVATIONS ON THE BIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR 
OF THE BITING FLIES 

This is a subject on which, at first sight, very 
little progress seems to have been made; the difficulty however, 
is a very natural one. As soon as the observer enters the 
habitat of biting flies which use man as a host, the whole 
attention of all of these flies is directed towards obtaining 
the much sought after meal of human blood. The activities 
on which observations are required cease abruptly, and the 
would be observer becomes himself the object of observation. 

No progress can be made with eliminating this difficulty 
until more is known of the factors which attract these insects 
to their hosts. As a result, most of the data obtained will 
have to be based on circumstantial evidence, except for that 
relating to blood meals from man. 

3.1. The Mosquitoes. 

3.1.1. Immature Stages: 

The eggs of most species of Aedes will withstand 
dessication and extreme cold, and as a general rule will not 
hatch until they are flooded with water after having been 
subjected to these conditions. Roubaud (78) and Gjullin et al 
(67) have demonstrated the importance of chemical stimuli in 
the hatching of the eggs of species of Aedes . More recently

Abdel-Malek (1) has shown that eggs of A, trivittatu s require 
the presence of certain plant hormones in critical concen¬ 
tration for optimum percentage hatch. Eggs of Churchill 
species of Aedes have been observed to hatch in the laboratory 
when flooded with water from tundra pools, but no work with 
specific plant hormones has yet been done on these. 

Only few isolated observations on the behaviour of 
larvae and pupae have been made, the period of larval abundance 
being largely occupied with work on chemical control measures. 
In addition to the normal wriggling method of locomotion 
characteristic of mosquito larvae, the larvae of A. excrucians 
have been observed in water flowing very slowly through a 
drainage ditch, to maintain their positions in this ditch 
with no apparent locomotory movements. Observations on the 
intervals between submergence and surfacing for this species 
have been made as follows: at the surface, 2, 2, 26, 3, 6, 

2, and 4 seconds; submerged, 10, 123, 343, 8, 24, and 32 
seconds. In general a long period of submergence was followed 
by a long period at the surface. 

In muskeg areas, where ground movements may spread 
out many yards from every step taken, it was found impossible to 
approach pools without sending all larvae to the bottom, and 
the least movement while observing larvae from the margin of 
a pool would interrupt their activities. A conspicuous feeding 
habit, especially among tundra species, consists of grazing 
along the edges of decaying grasses in the pools. The micro- 

flora and fauna of these grasses are being studied. 

It is of some interest to record that larvae

isolated in the insectary for individual rearing to associate 
last larval exuvium with adult, were invariably slower to 
mature than comparable larvae which were reared together under 
otherwise identical conditions. 

The larvae of the chaoborine species appear to be 
the most important predators on Aedes larvae, consuming large 
numbers of these in the insectary. These predators also feed 
on fairy shrimps, and are in turn fed upon by the larvae of 
dytiscid beetles. A fairy shrimp has been taken from the 
prehensile antennae of a Chaoborus larva which was itself held 
in the mandibles of a larval dytiscid. 

3.1.2. Emergence and Mating: 

In insectary rearing, mortality at emergence is 
considerable, and is higher among females than among males. 

The reasons for this are unknown, but contributary factors 
may be the unnatural amount of illumination from the sides 
and below; perhaps the abnormal stimulation of the pupa to 
activity which is difficult to avoid during collection and 
transportation, has a devitalizing effect. 

The first interest of the newly emerged adult of 
all Churchill species of Aedes appears to be mating. This 
takes place shortly after emergence, and no species has been 
known to take a blood meal before mating. The typical mosquito 
mating swarm has been observed for most species, and these 
observations follow:

the perimeter of a small shallow lake, the swarms extending 
about 3 - 9 feet above the ground. 

A. punc tor a few feet above the Hudson Bay Railway 
tracks, in the forest near Warkworth Creek, after sunset (10.30 
p.m.) on July 13, 1947. Also over the tundra near woods east 
of Churchill, at 4.0 a.m. (ten minutes after sunrise) on 
July 25, and also in 1948, together with - 

A. communis forming one enormous swarm stretching as 
far as the eye could see as a dark cloud over the Hudson Bay 
Railway track at Warworth Creek, and following round the bend 
in the track. This swarm persisted from 8.30 until 9.0 p.m. on 
the evening of July 16, all individuals heading in the same 
direction at any one time, sometimes north and sometimes south, 
but always along the railway track, and extending from a height 
of 3 - 10 feet. There was no wind at this time; the air temp¬ 
erature over the track was 62°F, that over the vegetation on 
either side 58°F; saturation deficiency decreased from 4.3 to 
3.7 mms. of mercury, and light intensity remained at about 
650 lumens per square foot. Cloud was 4/lOths, and the sun 
set at 9.45 p.m. 

A. excrucians over open tundra at 9.30 p.m- on July 
12, temperature 61°F, saturation deficiency 2.5 mms., wind speed

Further evidence of the remarkable temperature 
sensitivity shown in these notes was obtained 2 hours after 
sunrise on July 17, when both mosquitoes and blackflies were 
seen to select the charred vertical surfaces of tree stumps in 
a burnt off area as resting sites. The greater absorption by 
these surfaces had raised their temperature 2 Fahrenheit degrees 
above the normal tree trunk. 

3.1.3. Adult Feeding and Activity: 

Mosquitoes having mated, man has no longer any 
practical interest in the male mosquito, but becomes increas¬ 
ingly interested in the female. It is well established that 
many mosquito species can lay viable eggs without a blood 
meal (9,30,50), although the number may be reduced, and this 
is probably true for most of the Churchill species. Certainly, 
as the season progresses, the majority of the mosquitoes which 
are attracted to man are carrying eggs of some description, 
although it is unlikely that many of them have fed on blood. 
Attempts were made in 1943 to obtain mosquitoes freshly fed on 
the blood of animals other than man for precipitin tests; no 
such specimens were secured up to the end of July. A list of 
birds and mammals seen in the area is given as appendix A; 
except for the white whale, the mammals are all exceedingly rare 
during the fly season, the commonest being mice and lemmings 
which spend most of fly time either under ground, or in water. 
There is no evidence that the cycle of lemming abundance is 
reflected in mosquito abundance. Nestling birds, and the few 
amphibia have been watched, but mosquitoes have not been seen to

feed on these; again, possibly because the observer is 
preferred. Longstaff (72) reports A. nigriues feeding on 
the redpoll and perhaps the arctic hare in Greenland, and 
Thienemann (33) records A. punctor and A. communis apparently 
feeding on Microtus and lemmings. 

In most individuals of all mosquito species collected 
on July 17, 1948, development of the eggs had scarcely begun; 
in one specimen of A. campestris eggs could be detected, and in 
one of A. communis about 50 developing eggs could be counted 
in each ovary. Further dissections on July 26 revealed 
considerable progress in development, although eggs were still 
far from ready to be laid. A total of 170 eggs could be 
counted in specimens of A. punctor , and 300 in A. excrucians. 
Captive specimens of A campestri s, given a blood meal in the 
insectary a few days previously, laid eggs on wet cotton on 
July 25 and 26. 

Nectar feeding appears to be a universal habit in 
Churchill mosquitoes, and here, circumstantial evidence has 
been kind. The very common woodland orchid Habenari a obtusata 
Pursh., as previously reported by Raup (45), is apparently 
normally pollinated by mosquitoes, which pick up one or both 
of the poliinia adhering to the ventral margins of the eyas, 
when visiting mature flowers, presumably for nectar. On 
July 24 and 25, 1947, 6 per cent of mosquitoes were found to 
be carrying the poliinia of this orchid. A larger sample 
collected on July 12,13,16 and 17, 1948, gave the following 
figures: total mosquitoes, 1364; number carrying a single 

pollinium, 55; number carrying two poliinia, 3. It seems

reasonable to assume that the probability of a mosquito in 
feeding on Habenaria picking up the left pollinium is the same 
as the probability of picking up the right pollinium. If 
this is so, the probability of a mosquito picking up both 
pollinia is the square of the probability of it picking up 
a single pollinium, and the ratio .of the number with two 
pollinia to the number with one is the same as the ratio of 
the number with one to the number which have visited the 
orchid. Working on this assumption, it may be stated that 
no less than 74 per cent of the Churchill mosquitoes attracted 
to man at the middle of July had fed on Habenaria obtusata . 

This is a remarkably high figure when it is considered that 
there are numerous other flowers secreting nectar accessible 
to mosquitoes at this time. Among these may be mentioned 
Rhododendron laoponicum L., Ledum palustre L. and Dryas 
integrifolia Vahl., all of which are extremely abundant, and 
on all of which, in spite of the difficulty of so doing, 
mosquitoes have been observed resting, and apparently feeding. 

Pollinia of H. obtusat a have been found on all the 
species of Aedes except A. cinereus , the proboscis of which 
is less than 2 mm. long. They have not been found however 
on the small individuals of A. communi s. 

On two occasions mosquitoes have been observed feeding 
on H abenaria h yoerborea L., and figure 7, paid for with no 
small amount of blood, shows A. punctor preparing to feed on 
this species. Neither the pollinia of this, nor those of 
other common species of orchid, however, have been found 
attached to mosquitoes.

Captive mosquitoes of various species feci readily 
on sugar solutions of a wide range of concentration in the 
laboratory. The process of feeding, however, was much slower 
than feeding on blood, and the quantity consumed at a single 
feed was never comparable to the size of the normal blood 
meal. 

Observations on mosquitoes feeding on blood are 
manifold, and need not be prolonged here. Some figure obtained 
for weights of blood meals are, however, given in Table 1, 
since these figures are used in flight range calculations 
in section 3.1.4. The figures for A. stimulans were obtained 
at Edmonton, using a chemical balance; the remainder at Churchill, 
using a micro-dynamometer improvised from glass capillary 
tubing, and calibrated by subdividing sheets of bond paper. 

Many of the preceding observations and data were 
secured during the course of 24 hour collections, in which 
2 or 3 observers recorded local weather conditions, collected 
biting flies and made notes on their activities at hourly 
intervals throughout a 24 hour period. Further data from 
these collections are given here, since most of them pertain 
to mosquitoes. 

In 1947 a preliminary 24 hour collection was made 
in order to investigate the possibilities of this method of 
working. Equipment and personnel were inadequate, but in 
spite of this, useful data were obtained. Two sites were 
selected about seven miles east of Churchill camp and a mile 
from the shore of Hudson Bay. The first of these (military 
map reference 024047, figure 23) was in open tundra meadow,

just to the lee side of a small clump of spruce, and is 
illustrated in figure 10. The second (025045) was in a wooded 
area about 200 yards south of this, illustrated in figure 11. 
Figure 12 shows the nature of the surrounding country. 

The first collection was made at 4*00 p.m. on July 
24, and the last at 3.00 p.m. on July 25th. Insects were 
collected at each station math a tube off the person of the 
observer so long as the light was sufficient, and by sweeping 
with a net through the cloud of insects on the wing around 
the observer. Temperature and humidity readings were taken 
every hour, and periodical observations of cloud conditions, 
light values, and wind were made. 

The observations appeared to indicate that the 
outstandingly important weather factor in relation to general 
biting fly activity is wind, w r ith temperature second in 
importance, but only below a definite limit, which for 
mosquitoes is certainly appreciably below 50°F. Mosquitoes 
appear to be indifferent to light intensity. These conclusions 
are in agreement with the generally accepted idea of relief 
from biting flies obtained along the sea shore, where the 
overall wind is fully effective, and where it is supplemented 
twice daily by local ‘land and sea breezes'. Mosquitoes 
appeared to exhibit some tendency to collect into groups 
of trees and patches of wooded country after sunset. 

In 1S48 two 24 hour collections were made, one on 

the tundra at the site used in 1947 on July 12 - 13, and one 
in the forest at Warlcworth Creek on July 16 - 17. Some of 
the data from these are presented in graphical form in figures

13 and 14. In these graphs the black columns represent a 
measure of the mosquito interest in man, and are computed 
arbitrarily from the biting rate and alighting rate figures. 
Biting rate figures represent the number of mosquitoes 
engaged in feeding during the second minute in which a forearm 
is exposed on the lee side of the body. Alighting rate is a 
count of the number of mosquitoes alighting on the front of 
the trousers between side seams from waist to knee, in the 
second minute of standing still, facing downwind. Open columns 
represent the proportion of the sky covered by cloud, and the 
broken and solid lines represent temperature and saturation 
deficiency respectively. The heavy line at the top of each 
graph represents the hours of darkness; records commenced 
between 10 and 11 a.m. 

The tundra graph shows remarkably good correlation 
between cloudiness and mosquito interest in man, a fact which 
has been previously observed by Hunter (71). There is a rough 
peak of activity shortly after nightfall, when both temperature 
and saturation deficiency were falling rapidly. In the forest 
graph, as would be expected, the correlation with cloudiness 
is less well marked, and there are two quite well defined 
peaks of mosquito interest, one shortly before sundown, and 
a second shortly after sunrise. Again, no inverse correlation 
with saturation deficiency is shown, biting rates often remain¬ 
ing surprisingly high at high saturation deficiencies. It is 
interesting to note that quite high biting rates were recorded 
at temperatures below 7°C; Mellanby (40) records the flight 
threshold of A. punctor , a dominant species in this collection,

as about 10°G in Lapland. Wind speed throughout both of these 
24 hour periods was low, so that no confirmation of 1947 
observations was obtained, except as regards the absence of 
any direct effect of light intensity. These data do not 
support the statement of Matheson (37) that all our far northern 
Aedes species are primarily diurnal. Further data are required 
before much specific variation in activity will show up, but 
an examination of the material taken at these collections 
reveals that A. cinereus is restricted in its biting activity 
to a few hours before sunset, and again after sunrise. 


3.1.4. Flight Range: 

The difficulties of measuring the flight range of an 
insect by the normal method of releasing marked individuals and 
recording the distance to the point of recapture, increase in 
proportion to the square of the flight range, and are immeasur¬ 
ably further increased over terrain such as that at Churchill, 
where the observer's own power of movement is very restricted. 

It is generally accepted that the more northern mosquito 
species have a very considerable range of flight, so that a 
new approach to this problem had to be found. 

The flight range of mosquitoes determines the area 
over which it is necessary to kill larvae to ensure protection 
from adults for a given locality. This is its primary practical 
application. Population pressure is a major stimulus to 
movement; this cancels out under normal conditions, but is 
at its maximum in infiltration into an area cleared by insecticide

spraying. It follows that the maximum possible flight range 
has greater practical significance than flight range under 
normal conditions. 

The normal method of determining flight range 
measures actual distances flown, and concludes that the 
maximum flight range is not less than the greatest of these 
distances. The method used here has the advantage of approaching 
the answer from the opposite direction; the maximum flight 
range which is theoretically possible being determined, it 
may then be stated that the flight range is not greater than 
this figure. Unfortunately it can only be applied to 
uninterrupted flights. Flight range data based on distances 
from known breeding grounds at which adults are captured are 
always open to suspicion in that there may be unknown breeding 
grounds, or that adults may have been carried by their hosts or 
by man’s vehicles. 

The method used is to determine experimentally the 
stomach capacity of the insect, the composition of its normal 
food and hence the energy obtainable from this by respiratory 
processes, the mass of the insect and hence the energy required 
to keep it airborne for a given time, and finally the wind 
resistance at various speeds and hence the energy required to 
travel unit distance. From these data a simple equation can 
be obtained for any air speed, solution of which will give the 
range at such a speed. The solution of a series of such 
equations enables range to be plotted against air speed, the 
resulting curve showing a single maximum range. No account 
has been taken of the energy stored in the fat body, and

elsewhere in the newly emerged adult. This is small in 
mosquitoes and is probably largely exhausted in mating and 
preliminary feeding activities. It has necessarily been 
assumed that the wind resistance of the stationary wings is 
the same as that of the wings in motion. 

Only a preliminary exploratory application of this 
method, using A, ounctor has been made so far, but the results 
are sufficiently promising to justify further work, and are 
reproduced here: 

A. Stomach capa c ity : It is true that mosquitoes do not normally 
engorge on nectar, the food presumably used for migratory 
flights, to the extent that they do on blood. On the other 
hand there is no evidence that migratory species before setting 
out on a long flight do not do so, and, since a maximum figure 
is required, stomach capacity has been taken as the space 
occupied by a blood meal of mean weight. Taking the specific 
gravity of human blood to be 1.06 (53), the figures in Table 1. 
show this to be 0.00274 ccs. 

B. Food composition and energy per meal : Samples of nectar 

from Rhododendron l apponicum which is believed to be utilised 
by mosquitoes were collected at Churchill at 3.0 p.m. on July 1 
by means of glass capillary tubes, and sealed into these. The 
amount obtained from a single flower was very variable, ranging 
from 0.00011 ccs. to 0.00088 ccs., but the 0.00274 ccs. required 
by A. punctor w r ould-be readily available from a single plant. 
Subsequent analysis showed this nectar to have the following 
composition: reducing sugars, 48 per cent; non-reducing

sugars, 41%; other matter not estimated, including water, 

11 per cent. 

Assuming the reducing sugars to be mainly glucose, 
with a heat of combustion of 673 kgm. cals, per gm. molecular 
weight, and the non-reducing sugars mainly sucrose, for which 
the figure is 1349.6 kgm. cals., the energy available in 
0.00274 ccs. of this material would be 12.7 calories or 

O 

5.30 x 10 ergs. Unfortunately little is known of the efficiency 
with which the insect can transform this chemical energy into 
mechanical energy, but it may be assumed that this is not 
much less than that of a mammal such as man (6 3), for which 
an average maximum is 25 per cent (54). This would give 
1.325 x 10 ergs available for flight. Still less is known of 
the efficiency with which insect wings can translate this 
muscular energy into fonward aerial motion, but since the main 
loss here is in the form of kinetic energy of the slipstream, 

O 

this is probably not more than 10 per cent, leaving 1.193 x 10 
ergs of useful energy available. 

C. Insect mass and energy r equ ired to remain airborne : Since 
the rate of loss of mass depends on the rate of consumption of 
energy, which in turn depends on the mass at any particular 
instant, the solution of a differential equation should be 
used here, but in a necessarily approximate preliminary 
investigation, sufficient accuracy is obtained by assuming 
that the mass remains constant at its mean value, which from 
the figures in Table 1. is 0.00605 gms. The energy required 
to remain airborne is equal to the rate at which gravity would

nature could remain airborne, without forward motion for

D. Wind resistance at various speeds ; This was measured with 
the aid of the micro-dynamometer referred to insection 3.1.3. 

The instrument was set up with the glass capillary vertical, 
with the free end below dipping into a cell built on to the 
side of the scale and containing a glycerol-water mixture 
of suitable viscosity to damp out vibrations. Adjacent to it 
was a portable anemometer, and at a variable distance from the 
two instruments, a 110 volt 1 ampere table fan with 16” 
diameten rotor, and a three stage resistance speed control. 

The apparatus was first calibrated by taking a series of 
corresponding readings of wind speed on the anemometer and 
deflection of the dynamometer, and plotting these against each 
other. A specimen of A. ounctor half fed on blood, recently 
killed and set in flying attitude, was then mounted with the 
load position of the glass capillary at the side of the 
mesothorax, and the readings were repeated. The curves 
obtained after converting the dynamometer deflections to dynes 
and the anemometer readings to metres per second, are given 
in figure 15, and enable the wind resistance at any desired 
speed to be read off. 

At an air speed of 0.5 metres per second (1.12 m.p.h.) 
the wind resistance is 1.0 dynes. Supposing the range to be 
R metres, the time in flight will be 2R seconds. The w T ork

done in remaining airborne will be 2910 x 2R ergs, and the 
energy used in forward motion will be 1.0 x R x 1000 ergs. 

The sum of these two must, equal the total energy available, i.e. 
1.193 x 10' ergs, and the solution of this equation gives R 

o 

the value 1.193 x 10 metres. This is 17,500 metres or about 
6820 

11 miles- Similarly the following figures may be obtained: 

At 1.0 metres per second: 23,400 metres. 

At 1.5 metres per second: 22,300 metres. 

At 2.0 metres per second: 17,700 metres. 

At 2.5 metres per second: 9,400 metres.

By plotting these figures on a graph (Fig. 15) it 
is seen that the maximum possible uninterrupted flight range in 
still air for A. punctor is not greater than 24 kilometres. 

A. punctor is not regarded as a migratory species. 


3.2. On the Biology and Behaviour of Blackflies. 

Studies on the immature stages of blackflies have 
been impeded by the difficulty of laboratory rearing, except 
for pupa to adult, and by the impossibility at present of 
identifying any stages earlier than the late last larval 
instar. 

Observations have been made on the hatching of eggs, 
which from the subsequent abundance of S. v e nusturn in the 
stream from which they were collected, presumably belonged 
to this species. Like many insect eggs, these darken as they 
mature; this is brought about partly by pigmentation in the

chorion and embryonic integument, and partly by the development 

of a prominent blue-black hatching spine on the vertex, and 

two dark eyespots on either side of the head. The front of 

the 

the embryonic head fits closely into/apex or smallest angle 
of the egg, which in dorsal view has an unusual rounded 
triangular shape. The thorax and abdomen are coiled into 
an S-shape and fill the remainder of the egg. Contractile 
waves in the abdomen, movements of the mouthparts, and partial 
rotations of the head, which apparently scratch the chorion 
with the hatching spine can all be observed prior to eelosion. 
The chorion eventually ruptures in such a manner as to allow 
the small angle of the triangle to hinge open, and the active 
young larva to emerge head first; the whole process, from the 
first appearance of the split, occupying about 20 minutes in 
the laboratory. 

These eggs are nearly always found in a very 
characteristic situation. Where sedges are bent by the current 
so that the top portion of the leaf lies parallel to and just 
below the surface of the stream, the eggs of this species 
will be found cemented to the upper side of the leaf within 
an inch or so of its tip. The mechanics of oviposition in 
such a situation are readily comprehensible. The egg just 
prior to hatching, and a typical oviposition site are shown in 
figures 16 and 17 respectively. 

Fish feed readily on blackfly larvae. As many as 
71 larvae of all ages have been taken from the stomach of a 
sucker ( Gatos tomus sp.) from a sparsely infested creek, and 
73 very young larvae from the stomach of a stickleback (Pungitius

uungitius ) from a stream which observers bad reported to be 
free from infestation. Larvae have also been found in the stom¬ 
ach of the northern wood frog, and of jackfish; in the latter 
animal they were apparently ingested incidentally along with 
a mat of filamentous algae to which they had been attached. 

Very little is known of the mating and feeding habits 
of adult blackfiies. Bnsim u liu rn species A resembles E . lascivum 
in that it mates freely on vegetation at the sides of the 
stream from which it emerged, on the clothing and person, and 
even in the collectors vials. The only other Churchill species 
of which the mating habits have been observed is B. aureurn , of 
which a pair was taken off the clothing, in copula, at 11.0 a.m. 
on July 17 in the woods adjoining the creek in which the 
species develops. 

S. venustum is the only species which is a serious 
pest of man at Churchill; this species takes rather longer to 
feed than do mosquitoes, but in spite of its smaller size it 
takes almost as large a meal, weights of 2.4 and 1.7 mgms. 
having been recorded. 

There are some indications that with the exception 
of S . arcticu m, the blackfiies do not travel far in search of 
a blood meal. Of 265 blackfiies taken during the 1947 24 hour 
collection, only 2 or 0.7 per cent were S . vittatum , the 
breeding of which is believed to be confined to the Churchill 
Paver, nine miles west of the collection site. Critical light 
values for blackfly flight and feeding recorded during the 
1948 24 hour collections were as follows: cessation of biting, 
tundra 900 lumens per sq. ft., forest 500; cessation of flying,

3.3. Biology and Behaviour of Tabanids. 

The abundance of certain tabanid species leads to 
speculation as to the larval food material, line (29) success- 
fully reared a number of species of Hybomitra on small Crustacea 
and on earthworms, both living and dead. Stone (56) was able 
to repeat this but found mosquito larvae to be the best food 
for the young tabanid larvae. It would seem possible, therefore, 
that the enormous numbers of mosquito larvae stranded from 
drying pools may form a material element in the diet of one 
or more species of Hybomi tra . 

Larvae in the insectary in 1948, species as yet 
unknown, fed avidly on small gastropods, and the presence of 
empty shells of this snail in the field provided a guide to 
the whereabouts of larvae. The cannibalistic habits of these 
larvae probably explain their very scattered distribution, 
which makes them very much harder to collect than the abundance 
of adults would lead one to suppose. The chemical treatment 
recommended by Bailey (7), but with Triton X-100 replacing 
sodium lanryl sulphate, and a trade preparation sold to anglers 
for bringing worms to the surface, were used extensively in 
1948 without revealing anything but extremely sparse larval 
populations, Cameron (13) states that Chrysops larvae will 
not feed on living animal material, but Waterston (84) reports

them as preying on mosquito larvae, under laboratory 
conditions. 

The few instances of mating observed took place 
at various times of day. H. gr a c ilipa.1 pis seemingly mates 
as a rule about the middle of the morning. Females at least, 
apparently feed on flowers soon after emerging; most of the 
earlier specimens taken of nearly all species, were liberally 
dusted with pollen. Specimens of Chrysops mitis were collected 
off flowers. Specimens of H. affinis fed readily on various 
concentrations of sugar solution in the laboratory, but 
would not take expressed human blood; the piercing procedure 
is presumably necessary to condition the insect for blood 
feeding. 

The effect of a meal of human blood on egg 
development in H. affinis is astounding. Specimens collected 
in the field on July 20 had very rudimentary ovaries, the 
abdomen being very largely filled with air sacs, and no eggs 
discernible. One of these given a full blood meal, and killed 
three days later y/as found,to have the abdomen swollen, and 
filled almost to bursting with well developed eggs. The 
number of these was estimated at 600. 

With the exception of H. affinis and H. seotentrionalis 
the adults of no species of either genus were found in numbers 
more than a few hundred yards from woodland; this was especially 
true of the Chrysops species which were seldom taken outside 
of the woods. 

The adults of several species of Hybomitra , H. affinis 
conspicuous amongst them, are attracted in large numbers to

vehicles, including trucks, trains, and aircraft. Large 
numbers of flies would collect around a vehicle (Fig.18) while 
an observer standing a few yards away might pass practically 
unmolested. Stone (56) suggests that they are attracted by 
the movement, but adds that they will collect around a 
standing automobile. This fact was also observed, but in every 
instance it was around a standing vehicle which had been in 
motion, and was warm in consequence. Warmth appears to be an 
attractive factor, while movement stimulates pursuit. Certainly 
it is of no use attempting to run, or even to drive, away from 
tabanids over the terrain around Churchill. Specimens which 
appeared to be H. affinis were observed to lose ground only 
slowly when in pursuit of a train travelling at approximately 
30 m.p.h. On the morning of July 12, 1947, and a few days 
subsequent to this, several observers reported a caribou calf, 
apparently separated from the herd, careering madly around the 
Churchill locality, pursued by a small cloud of tabanids. The 
animal appeared in very poor condition, presumably as a result 
of the attentions of the flies. Chained dogs, however, were not 
seen to be attacked by large numbers of tabanids, possibly on 
account of their inability to run away. 

Activity, and especially biting activity, of tabanids 
is far more influenced by weather conditions than is that of 
mosquitoes. In cool, damp, overcast and windy weather few, if 
any tabanids are seen on the wing. The weather factors of greatest 
importance seem to be temperature and sunlight; high relative 
humidity appears to be associated with absence of biting only 
secondarily, by virtue of its association with low temperature.

Biting was rare at temperatures below 55°F, and even above this 
temperature would not normally occur unless there had previously 
been an appreciable period of sunshine on the same day. The 
well established preference "of tabanids for biting through 
wet skin (57) was. confirmed by the observations of personnel 
working in biackfly streams, and by bathers. When up to the 
neck in water, H. septentrionaLis especially, will circle the 
head continuously at a distance of about a metre, coming in to 
bite as soon as the rest of the body is exposed. 

During the 1947 24 hour collection, tabanids were no 
longer on the wing about half an hour after sunset. The 
temperature at that time fell below 65°F. and the light value 
below 500 lumens per sq.ft. Activity was not resumed until 
two hours after sunrise, when the temperature was 55°F. and the 
light value 2000 lumens p. sq.ft, A. affinis was the most 
persistent species in each instance, but possibly only apparently 
so, on account of its greater abundance. These observations 
were confirmed during the 24 hour collections in 1948. 






4, THE INFLUENCE OF BITING FLIES ON MAN 
AND ON HIS ACTIVITIES 

/ 

There are many reports, some authentic, some otherwise, 
of individual men and animals being killed by biting flies, either 
directly by loss of blood, or indirectly through the reaction 
to toxic materials injected. There is no doubt whatever but 
that current methods of protection - protective, or even normal 
•sensible 1 clothing, and a modern repellent - can entirely 
eliminate such occurrences without undue expenditure of time, 
effort, or materials. There remain, however, very considerable 
discomforts and delays, risks of secondary infections, and in 
susceptible or sensitized persons reactions to toxic materials 
which not infrequently require hospital treatment. In a really 
intense blackfly and mosquito population, even conversation 
becomes difficult unless one is prepared to swallow many of the 
insects. Finally, there is another effect of biting fly attack 
which has not been fully considered in the past, a psycho- 
physiological effect. This was clearly demonstrated on several 
occasions at Churchill, in particular during the camp at Warkworth 
Creek in 1947, and during the 24 hour collecting camps. 

4.1. Physiological Influences. 

As opportunity offered, observations w r ere made on the 
reactions to bites of both mosquitoes and bla.ckflies, with the

object of confirming for the species encountered here, the 
accepted opinions that: repeated bites result in a degree of 
immunity, and that the reaction is less if the insect is allowed 
to feed to completion (47). Observations were not sufficiently 
numerous for definite conclusions to be drawn, but what evidence 
there is tends to support these views, and this evidence is 
recorded here: 


M osquito es: Culi seta alaska ensis Ludl. June 18, just above elbow, 
fed to completion in 2% minutes. Feeding was 
preceded by a preliminary probe from final puncture. 
Irritation was possibly slightly greater at the trial 
puncture. Symptoms just detectable after 30 hours. 

Aedes excrucians . July 17, partial feeding inside 
right knee. Considerable irritation directly after 
biting. After 9 hours a small reddish weal, very 
slight irritation. 24 hours, no symptoms detectable. 

A. nigripes . July. 17, complete feeding 2” above right 
knee. Some irritation during feeding and for a few 
minutes afterwards. After 8 hours slight hardness, 
small reddish weal and very slight irritation. 24 
hours very slight irritation, faint reddish mark. 

A. nigr ipes. July 17, complete feeding 1 M below elbow. 
Slight irritation during feeding. After 6 hours no 
detectable symptoms. 

A. nigripe s. July 17, partial feeding upper left 
forearm. Slight irritation during feeding; after 

4 hours slight reddish weal and slight irritation. 

After 18 hours no symptoms detectable. 

Blackflies : Four bites of S. venustu rn were observed on July 17. 

At the first two of these, the insect was allowed to 
feed to sateity, at the other two the insect was 
removed shortly after starting feeding. 

1. Below and inside right knee. Feeding time 5 minutes. 
After 4 hours slight swelling and moderate irritation. 
After 14 hours no swelling, slight irritation. After 

3 days slight irritation but no other symptoms. After 

5 days, no symptoms. 

2. Outside left leg, 4 U above ankle. Very slight 
irritation immediately after bite. Swelling appeared 
after 4 hours, l-| n across, irritation considerable.

After 14 hours no swelling, but still some irritation. 
Slight irritation after 3 days, none after 5 days. 

3. Outside left leg, 12" above ankle. Irritation 
considerable and continuous from 1 ', time of bite onwards; 
a hard lump around puncture. After 5 hours swelling 
about 3" across and irritation severe. After 14 hours 
swelling slight and moderate irritation. After 3 days, 
no swelling but moderate irritation. Appreciable 
irritation remained after 5 days. 

4. Outside right leg, 4" below knee. Symptoms as for 
No. 3 but somewhat more severe. 

There was no sensation of pain during piercing; in 
each instance the insect crawled down through the 
hairs and held itself practically perpendicular to 
the skin surface. There was a slight flow of blood 
from all four bites for a few minutes after feeding 
ceased. 


Concerning the direct effect of loss of blood, a simple 
calculation on this is of interest. The highest mosquito biting 
rate recorded at Churchill during 1947-8 was 160 bites per 
minute. The total skin surface is about 33 times that of the 
forearm, so that a completely unprotected man (materials often 
used for summer clothing give very little protection against 
northern species) could receive a maximum of 5290 bites per 
minute. At 2.5 mgms. per bite (see Table 1.), the blood lost 
per minute would be 13.2 gms. The symptoms resulting from a 
loss of 50 per cent of the blood are certainly severe enough (64) 
to prevent the victim from progressing any distance across the 
Churchill terrain. Assuming that the blood composes 7.7 per 
cent of the body weight, and has a specific-gravity of 1.06 ( 54), 
this situation could be reached in about three hours on account 
of mosquitoes alone. Although the biting rates for blackflies 
and tabanids are both much lower, the loss of blood from their 
larger punctures, in which an anticoagulin is present, would 
contribute materially to exhaustion from this cause.

In so far as the irritation caused by mosquito bites 
is concerned, Macloskie (35) regarded the middle lobe of the 
salivary gland as the source of the poison concerned, Hi ley and 
Johannsen (47) refer to the work of Schaudinn (49) and of Roy (48). 
Results appear to be based on Anopheline species only, and to 
demonstrate somewhat inconclusively that irritation is due to 
an enzyme produced by constant commensal fungi (yeasts ?) living 
in the oesophageal diverticula. The results of Cornwall and 
Patton (16) seem to support this view, and Imms (31) quotes 
Kindle, also in support of it. Bruck (12) however, extracted 
a toxin which he named culicin from the bodies of mosquitoes 
and assumed this came from the salivary glands, and McKinley (39) 
has demonstrated convincingly the presence of a poison in the 
salivary glands of Aedes aegyot i. hone of this work relates to 
northern species of Ae des ; I have not had access to the work of 
Hecht (28) who is reported to have summarised the information 
available in 1928. 

With regard to the situation in blackflies, Patton and 
Evans (41) figure the alimentary system of S. ornatum with a 
single oesophageal diverticulum, and suggest a toxic enzyme in 
the saliva of some species as the irritant. Both in 1947 and in 
1948 the reaction to blackfly bites diminished markedly as the 
season progressed; this has been regarded as the development of 
a temporary immunity as a result of bites received. In view of 
the very different environmental conditions under which the later 
generations of blackflies develop, however, this could equally 
well be attributed to a physiological difference in these 
generations of blackflies. This appears to be all that is known

on the subject, although, at least to the susceptible newcomer, 
the toxic effect of the blackfly bite is undoubtedly the most 
potent weapon in the whole biting fly armoury. It is believed 
to be this toxic material which is the cause of numerous deaths 
of cattle in Saskatchewan when attacked by S. arcticum (46). 

Typical reactions to the bites of mosquitoes and of 
blackflies are shown in figures 19 and 20 respectively. 

Observations on the bites of tabanids are few; these 
insects are so clumsy over piercing the skin that they rarely 
get away with a complete meal from man. As a group, they do 
not appear to have ’learnt 1 yet that man has hands, and it is 
usually a biological error for a tabanid to attempt to secure 
a meal from man. Considerable personal variation in liability 
to attack has been noticed. The species of Chrysops appear 
to bite man more freely than do Hybomitra, but none is a serious 
biter of man when he is protected by suitable clothing and a 
good repellent. 

Tabanids gain access to buildings in considerable 
numbers, but cause annoyance there more by their efforts to 
get out again than by any attempts to bite. In fact , no instance 
of a tabanid biting indoors has been recorded at Churchill. 

4.2. Psychological Influences. 

The psychological effects of biting fly attack seem 
to result partly from the immediate stinging sensation of the 
insect mouthparts, partly from the manual ’removal reaction’ 
to this, and partly from the continual impact of insects on 
the face and person. Given equal numbers, tabanids are regarded 










Figure 19: A typical reaction to the 

puncture of a mosquito in a 
susceptible individual. 



Figure 20: A typical reaction to 
blackfly punctures. 













66 


as the most important group in relation to each of these 
three factors, followed by mosquitoes and finally blackflies. 

The two genera of tabanids however, are very different in their 
effects. 'The Chrysops species contribute to the psychological 
menace mainly by virtue of their rather silent approach and 
furtive alighting, Hy bomitra species on account of their 
swift and noisy flight, and the momentum of their impacts 
on the person. 

The typical 'removal reaction' is illustrated in 
figures 21 and 22. It might be supposed that this, along with 
the first factor, could be eliminated by protective clothing 
and repellents, but such is not the case; the reaction may 
be evoked by insects alighting, but not biting, or even in 
certain circumstances by non-existent insects. 

The combined influence of these three factors presents 
a more serious problem in our present state of knowledge than 
the problem of direct physiological effects. This combined 
influence would, it is believed, also prove far more serious 
in military operations, causing as it does, a serious reduction 
in individual efficiency, and an even more serious lowering 
of group morale. Carried to the extreme, it is considered 
that the susceptible individual would become a liability 
rather than an asset from these causes sooner than from direct 
physiological effects; the rapidity with which such a person 
can become worked up into an emotional state bordering on 
dementia as a result of the continually accelerated and 
increasingly ineffective removal reactions, has to be seen 
to be believed.

More knowledge of this problem is required before 
definite solutions can be proposed; it is possible, for instance, 
that the effects may be very different in a large body of men. 
Tentaive proposals for combating these factors are given in 
section 5, and improvements in these methods of personal 
protection will certainly play their part. 


4.3. Indirect Influences of Biting Flies. 

None of the Churchill species of biting flies is 
known to serve as a true vector for any disease or parasite 
of man in the Churchill area. The possibility of mechanical 
transmission of disease by biting flies is also remote at 
present, in view of the very sparse human population, and the 
resulting extreme Improbability of any individual insect taking 
blood meals from two humans. 

S. venustu m however transmits an important disease 
of wild and domestic ducks, caused by a protozoon parasite 
Leucocytezoon anatis Wickware, which is closely related to the 
malaria plasmodia (75). The cycle of events in this disease 
is comparable with that in malaria, and it may cause heavy 
mortality; it has recently been shown, however, that it will 
not respond to treatment with anti-malarial drugs (21). 

Scott (82) has shown that H. sep t entrionali s is 
capable of transmitting swamp fever or infectious anaemia of 
horses, and various ?/orkers (7 9,85) have demonstrated the ability 
of the filarial parasite of dogs D irofilar ia immitis Leidy to 
develop in A. cixiereus , A. punctor , and possibly A. flavescen s 
and A-. excrucians . Tularaemia and Plasmodiu m gallinaceum have

also been transmitted experimentally by H . sep t ent rionali s 
(76) and A. cinereus (74), and by A. campestris (65) respect¬ 
ively. 

Although horses have been maintained at the extreme 
point of the Churchill peninsula. , where the full benefit of 
sea. breezes is obtained, in general the larger domestic 
animals are excluded from the area on account of biting flies. 
Most caribou move out northwards along the shore line, before 
the flies emerge; the Churchill butcher reports that animals 
from the forest can be distinguished at once by the presence 
of bites all over the body, the bites on those from the tundra 
being concentrated near the feet, presumably on account of 
wind. Husky dogs endure a miserable existence in fly time, 
and attempt to emulate the lemming, burrowing into the ground 
to secure a measure of protection. 

Further south, mosquitoes are blamed for reduction 
in land values, for crop losses through impeding harvesting 
operations at the best time, for general loss of working time 
on outdoor employment, and for impairment of health through 
preventing outdoor recreational activities. Only the last 
two of these factors are applicable in northern regions.

5. EXPERIMENTS ON THE CONTROL OP BITING FLIES 

Tnree approaches to the problem of biting fly control 
are possible. The first and most obvious method is the 
application of chemical insecticides, mainly against the larval 
stages. This is the simplest method, cheapest at the start 
perhaps, since less fundamental work is required, but probably 
most expensive in the long run, since once started it may 
bring about conditions which demand its continuation. It involves 
a risk of unforeseen consequences. The second is to so alter their 
habitat that they will never develop in troublesome numbers; 
this may not be practicable, and complete control by this method 
would certainly require vastly more knowledge than we have at 
present. The third, the safest and perhaps the most civilized 
method, is to let them live, but to arrange matters so that 
they are kept at a comfortable distance from man, and from 
animals on which he is dependent. What particular combination 
of these methods is employed will be decided by circumstances. 


5.1. Chemical means for the Reduction of Numbers. 

Chemical methods for the control of malaria carrying 


species are well established. The principle objects of this 
work were firstly, to discover what modifications would be

required in these methods for the control of northern species 
of Aedes ; secondly, to adapt the technique of preflooding 
treatments developed against salt marsh mosquitoes at Orlando, 
Florida,for use in the north; and finally to explore the 
possibilities of the chemical control of blackflies. 

Results of experiments involving the application of 
a variety of recently discovered insecticides against mosquito 
larvae from ground equipment, give no suggestion that any of 
these can compete with DDT, although some of them are no less 
toxic. 

The preflooding application of DDT on the frozen 
ground, or on ice and snow cover offers the following advan¬ 
tages over normal methods of treatment: movement over the 
ground is much easier at this time; DDT has a lower LD 50 
for newly hatched mosquito larvae, and DDT has a negative 
temperature coefficient of toxicity. In practice however, 
much material may be lost from snow drifting and heavy run-off 
at thawing, and the enormous areas which require to be treated 
dictate application from the air, so that these advantages 
are largely discounted. 

Results of several experiments on the aerial appli¬ 
cation of DDT in oil solutions indicate that the dosage 
required for the control of Aedes larvae is about 0.5 lbs 
DDT per acre, or nearly five times that required for Anophe les 
control, and also that very large areas would have to be treated 
to secure freedom from mosquitoes for the season at the centre 
of the area. This agrees with data on the flight range of 
these species.

Several tests of ground applications of DDT in 
aerosol form against mosquito larvae and adults, and tests 
of a number of materials against blackfly larvae were made. 
Detailed accounts of these experiments follow. 

5.1.1. Experiments with the Hochberg-Lamer 
Aerosol Generator against Mosquito 
Larvae: 

Two experiments were carried out in the second half of 
June 1947 to investigate the effectiveness of DDT aerosols 
against mosquito larvae in the open under the conditions found 
at Churchill. Material was dispensed from 500 yard base lines, 
and entomological observations were carried out to a depth of 
about 600 yards from these. The plot for the earlier experiment 
was on tundra meadow, and for the later, on terrain with a heavy 
covering of birch and willow shrubs, adjoining a tidal flat. 

These areas are marked (1) and (2) on figure 23. The material 
was dispensed with an early model of the Hochberg-Lamer aerosol 
generator (inventor’s model no.4) (32) which was mounted on a 
tracked amphibious trailer containing the tanks of insecticide 
and the fuel for the .generator, and towed behind a snowmobile 
(Fig.25). 

DDT was supplied to the generator in the form of an 
emulsion of the following composition: 

Lubricating oil (equivalent SAE 10) 5 imperial gallons 

Xylene 1 ■ r imp.gals. 

DDT 4| lbs. 

Triton X-1Q0 emulsifier 2-J- lbs. 

Water 5 "imp.gals. 

and this mixture was dispensed at the rate of about 1/3 of a

gallon per minute. 

Prior to the liberation of the insecticide, dipper 
counts of the mosquito larval population at selected locations 
were made; these were repeated at intervals after the treatment 
and a comparison of the figures obtained was used for estimating 
the mortality at varying distances from, §nd to the leeward 
side of the line of release of the insecticide. Uo chemical 
or physical estimates of the DDT deposited at varying distances, 
nor of the droplet size spectrum of the aerosol were made, but 
the nozzle temperature was kept at 300 - 325°F. to minimize 
the charring which occurred at the recommended temperature of 
450°F., and to give a rather coarse droplet size in view of the 
prevailing high wind speeds. 

Experiment 1, * 

The base line for the plot used in this experiment 
was set out with ends determined by the map references 917066 
and 922065. The sides of the plot ran north and south, and 
east and west, as the prevailing winds for a few days prior 
to the marking out had been approximately southerly in direction. 
The terrain was level tundra meadow, with a large proportion 
of the area taken up by shallow and for the most part rather 
indefinite pools in which the mosquitoes A. punctor , A. nigripes , 
and A. nearcticus were breeding. The population, although well 
distributed was nowhere very heavy. This distribution of water 
bodies, -while it greatly facilitated the selection of dipping 
sites, proved ultimately, in this particular instance, to render 

* This experiment was conducted by Mr. W.C.McDuffie to 
whom I am indebted for permission to interpret and 
use these results.

the effects of evaporation very serious. A general view of 
the area is shown in figure 26. 

The plot was being used for breeding purposes by 
various birds, chiefly plovers and curlews. These suffered 
no direct adversity from the experiment. 

Dipping stations were marked out in three equally 
spaced lines running north from the base line, and at intervals 
of 50 yards from this, the stations furthest from the base 
line being at a distance of 550 yards from it. Lines were 
numbered 1, 2, and 3, from east to west. The layout of the 
plot and the dipping stations is shown in figure 24. 400 cc. 

dippers were used, and ten dips were taken at each station at 
each population estimate. The average number of larvae 
obtained per dip in the pretreatment estimate made on June 16 
was 1.06; these were all in the third or fourth instar; the 
results are set out in detail in the first group in table 2. 

The insecticide was dispensed from 10.0 to 11.30 a.m. 
on June 18. The weather was fine, with light cloud; wind BSE, 
the recorded speed by anemometer on top of an adjoining ridge 
to the east of the plot was 15 m.p.h.; wind speed at the plot 
was appreciably less than this and was estimated at 10 - 12 m.p.h. 
The shade temperature during the treatment rose from 58 ~ 63°F., 
and it appeared from the behaviour of the insecticide cloud, 
which moved close to the ground and remained visible for a 
distance of some 150 - 200 yards, that inversion conditions 
xorevailed. The generator was actually in operation for 75 
minutes, one stoppage being necessary to change a choked filter, 
but for only 48 minutes was the emission actually over the

observed plot, the remaining time being spent in turning at 
either end of the base line. During these 48 minutes, 14 gallons 
of emulsion were consumed; this represents a total application 
of 5.4 lbs. DDT or 1.08 lbs. per hundred yards of base line. 

If it is assumed that virtually all of this DDT'is deposited 
within the observed area, the calculated dosage then becomes 
0.087 lbs per acre. 

During the emission period the generator was towed 
at a little over 2 m.p.h.; beginning at the east end of the 
base line, three complete round trips to the west end and back 
to the east end were made. Walking down wind from the generator, 
the smell of xylene could be detected wherever there was visible 
cloud. At the end of the emission a distinct oil film was 
detectable on the surface of pools up to at least 200 yards 
from the emission line; at 50 yards this was so pronounced that 
a photograph was secured and is reproduced as figure 27. 

A short distance from the baseline, dolichopodid flies ware seen 
to be in difficulties on the surface of the water quite early 
in the treatment, but towards the conclusion of this, dancing 
clouds of newly emerged midges at 400 yards from the base line 
seemed quite unaffected. 

The first population estimate after treatment was 
made approximately 24 hours later on June 19. Weather conditions 
remained much the same as at the previous count, except that the 
barometer was now falling rather rapidly. The counts obtained 
at this estimate appear in the second group in table 2. A 
superficial examination of the area showed no conspicuous 
reduction in larval population beyond 50 to 100 yards down wind

from the base line; many living larvae were seen considerably 
closer than this, although here there were also dead and 
moribund mosquito larvae and dead water beetles and caddis 
larvae. At stations 7 in lines 2 and 3, the pools had dried 
up to such an extent that it was not possible to take the full 
ten dips, and a similar drying up may account for, the capricious 
figures at other stations. As expected from the direction of 
the wind, mortality in line 1 did not extend appreciably 
beyond 100 yards from the base line. There were many pupae in 
the counts at this estimate. 

A final population estimate was made on the morning 
of June 21, 72 hours after the treatment. Weather conditions 
were very different; 0.08 inches of rain fell on the morning 
of the observations, humidity was much higher, the sky was 
overcast, and the barometric pressure still lower than at the 
24 hour count. The figures obtained are recorded in the third 
group in table 2. and are no less capricious, than those obtained 
at the previous count; figures for line 1 were unfortunately 
lost in transit. By this time further pools had so dried, up 
as to prevent ten full dips being tshen, notably at stations 8 
and 9 in line 3; clearly this drying up had not been offset by 
the small amount of rain which had fallen. There was a much 
greater proportion of pupae appearing in these counts. 

The first mosquito pupae taken in the Churchill 
area during this season were found on June 16, the date of the 
first population estimate. In view of the two day interval 
between this estimate and the treatment, the assumption has 
been made that some of the pupae appearing in the second and third

estimates had already pupated before the application of the 

insecticide. Considering also that the whole experiment took 
place during the very beginnings of the pupation period for the 
species concerned, it has been further assumed that the 
pupation rate throughout the experiment was uniform. Working 
on tnese two assumptions, in calculating percentage mortalities 
the pupal figures obtained in the post treatment counts were 
weighted, each pupa counting as 1/3 of one larva in the 24 hour 
count, and as 3/5 of one larva in the 72 hour count. This was 
done in order to give a picture of the effect of the insecticide 
on the larvae, uncomplicated by the known greater resistance of 
pupal mosquitoes. The apparent percentage mortalities given in 
table 2 were obtained by this method. 

Discussio n; It is clear that the dosage employed was too low 
to give effective larval control over a useful area, although 
the results obtained, in spite of their capricious nature, 
definitely represent a serious under-estimate of the actual 
mortality. 

During the period between the first and second 
population estimates, temperatures were high and humidities 
low, while wind speeds were moderate to high, and precipitation 
was nil. During the day of treatment, the humidity actually 
reached the lowest figure recorded during the period of work 
at Churchill, and the saturation deficiency reached a maximum 
for this same period at 8.S7 mms. of mercury, and was continually 
high throughout the period. These extremely drying conditions 
would naturally be expected with continual southerly or land 
breezes, and operating as they did, for an undesirably long

interval on highly dispersed water bodies, they clearly 
brought about a remarkable concentration of larvae from wide 
areas into smaller and smaller pools. Such a concentration 
naturally shows itself as an increased apparent population, when 
this is sampled by the dipping method. This apparent increase 
offset, and in some instances more than offset, the reduction 
brought about by the treatment. No other explanation for these 
figures can be adduced; first and second instar larvae were 
not found. 

The very great variation in apparent mortality 
recorded at different stations is directly attributable to the 
variation in mean depth of the separate pools and water areas. 
The fact that apparent percentage mortalities of 54 per cent at 
200 yards and 45 per cent at 250 yards were recorded, can only 
be explained on the assumption that the insecticide did cause 
significant kills; the possible action of predators can be 
discounted by virtue of their small numbers here, and the 
general absence of any conspicuous reductions in population 
due to them in this locality. 

The lapse of a further two days between the 24 hour 
and 72 hour population estimates allowed further evaporation 
to occur, although conditions were not then so severe. That 
this is the correct explanation is supported by the following 
facts: that there is good correlation between the 24 hour .and 
the 72 hour figures, the latter being the more extreme; that 
those stations which were nearly dry gave the conspicuously 
higher counts; and finally, that some stations had dried up 
completely at the 24 hour count, and still more after 72 hours.

If the 24 hour count population figures are adjusted 
for evaporation on the basis of station 10 line 2, which shows 
the highest per cent increase of stations where insecticide 
mortality would be expected to be small, the mortalities 
shown in the graph, figure 31, are obtained. These are 
considered to represent a reasonably close approximation to the 
true figures. 

On the basis of the results obtained in this 
experiment, it was decided to run a second experiment at a 
higher dosage, allowing a smaller time interval between 
population estimates, and particularly between the pretreatment 
estimate and the treatment. 

experiment 2. 

This experiment was run from a base line between 
the map references: 891083 and 896081. As it was proposed to 
release the insecticide on this occasion in the evening, and 
the wind on the three previous evenings had been SE and SSE, 
the base line was marked out on a bearing of 55°, and 600 yard 
side lines were marked out from either end of this. The 
terrain here was flat, with numerous discrete pools, which 
were rather scarcer towards the higher, shoreward, or eastern 
boundary. The central portion of the area selected vms densely 
covered with willow and birch shrubs to a height of 2 to 3 feet. 
Figures 28 and 29 show typical parts of the open and shrub 
covered areas. Drainage was towards the west, into the Churchill 
River. There were scattered spruce and larch trees on the 
higher ground, a small copse of these towards the northern

end, and many rocks. Although somewhat scanty in the higher 
area, the mosquito larval population here was considerably 
higher than in experiment 1, and its extent was more clearly 
circumscribed by the well defined pools. The most important 
species were A. punctor , A. campestris , and A* flaveseens , 
and these were present in second third and fourth instars. A 
species of Chaoborus was also present in considerable numbers 
at stations 2 and 5. There were many fish and frogs in the 
pools; none of these were observed to suffer any direct harm as 
a result of the insecticide. 

Thirty dipping stations were marked out within this 
area. These were selected with different degrees of exposure; 
number 11, a typical station is shown in figure 30. The larval 
population at each of these stations was estimated by dipping 
with 600 cc. capacity dippers. Five dips were taken at each 
station by each of two independent observers. When more than 
12 larvae were obtained in a single dip, this was recorded as 
T 12 plus T . The pretreatment count at the first 19 stations was 
taken on the ev-ning of June 19, and at the remaining 11 stations 
mostly in the higher area, on the morning of June 20. The 
detailed counts are shown in the first group in table 3; the 
average number of larvae per dip was 3.14. 

The insecticide was dispensed from 10.50 a.m. until 
3.30 p.m. on June 21, using the same equipment and material as 
in experiment 1, but during the second half of the run it was 
found necessary to tow the generator once along the base line, 
stopping for a calculated period at 25 yard intervals. This 
change was made on account of the very rough nature of the ground

and was found to be far more satisfactory, reducing wear and 
tear on machines and personnel to a minimum, and virtually 
eliminating end effects due to time taken in turning. A reduction 
of the distance between stops to 10 yards would be preferable, 
at least in experimental work, as the lateral spread is not very 
great, when meteorological conditions are suitable for aerosol 
application. The effect of an appreciable wind shift during 
operation in this manner would, of course, be far more serious, 
but such an eventuality did not arise. The greater time taken 
to dispense the material in this experiment was partly due to the 
greater amount of material, and partly to mechanical difficulties 
with the generator. There were numerous stoppages; three on 
account of choked filters, and one on account of engine trouble, 
appeared to have been unavoidable with the equipment as used. 

The longest continuous operation obtained was 25 minutes. These 
difficulties may have been accentuated by the rather violent 
movement of the vehicles. 

The wind in the early morning was NW which would have 
been very suitable for spraying from the north end of the plot. 

By the time the equipment was assembled at site, ho?/ever, this 
had changed to SW, and a new base line was set out at 45° to the 
original line passing through the two 100 yard marks N and E 
respectively of the SW corner of the original plot, and with its 
centre mid way between these. The new plot included all the 
dipping stations except no.l. which fell south of the centre of 
the base line, and no.10 which fell just outside the western 
side line at about the 500 yard mark. The layout of the initial 
and the ultimate plots, and of the dipping stations is shown 
in figure 24.

The sky was overcast almost throughout the treatment; 
the wind was blowing from a direction slightly west of that of 
the plot during the first half of the treatment, but veered to 
slightly east of this direction during the second half. There 
was thus a tendency for the dosage on marginal dipping stations 
to be low, and for that on the central stations to be high. 

Wind speed recorded on the ridge by the airstrip was 10 m.p.h., 
that at the site was considerably less and was estimated at 
about 4 m.p.h., strengthening somewhat later to about 6 m.p.h. 

From the behaviour of the cloud which clung closely to the ground, 
rather poor inversion conditions prevailed. Air temperature 
rose from 58 to 65°F. during the treatment; humidity was moderate, 
and barometric pressure rather low, and falling. 

The generator was in operation over the plot for a 
total time of 125 minutes, during which time 47 imperial gallons 
of emulsion were dispensed; this figure corresponds to 18 lbs. 
of DDT or 3.6 lbs. per hundred yards of base line. Assuming 
that virtually all this material was deposited within the test 
plot, this means an average deposition of 0.29 lbs. DDT per acre. 

The cloud of insecticide could be seen clearly for 
200 to 250 yards, and appeared to be settling down nicely; after 
two runs a definite film ?<ras visible on pools at 100 yards, but 
there were still quite a number of adult mosquitoes on the wing 
in the cloud. Walking in the aerosol cloud down wind from the 
generator, xylene could be smelled distinctly for a distance 
of 150 yards; from 100 yards onwards, the odour of DDT became 
noticeable as well, and this persisted up to a total distance 
from the machine of at least 400 yards. Before the end of the

treatment, many adult insects, mainly mosquitoes and other 
diptera (Tipulidae, Dolichopodidae, Scatomyzidae), had been 
knocked down on to the pool surfaces, and some mortality of 
mosquito larvae could be detected. 

The first population estimate after treatment was 
made 24 hours later, on June 22. The weather conditions were 
very much the same as during the treatment, but nearly 0.1 inches 
of rain had fallen since the initial estimate. The dilution 
resulting from this is reflected in the reduced population in 
the untreated check station (no.l), and in calculating apparent 
percentage mortalities the counts at this estimate have accord¬ 
ingly been increased in this proportion, viz; 26/23. While 
carrying out this estimate the smell of DDT was clearly noticeable 
when walking through thick shrubs, presumably from a deposit 
brushed off the leaves. Partial elutriation of this deposit 
into the pools by rain may have influenced the results obtained. 
Many dead sawflies, craneflies, midges and dolichopodid flies 
were seen on the pool surfaces during this count. 

As there were virtually no pupae in the majority of 
pools at the initial estimate, pupal figures obtained in the 
24 hour count were, on the assumption of a uniform pupation rate, 
weighted as one half larvae in calculating mortalities. Detailed 
figures are set out in the second group in table 3. The mean 
percentage mortality for the whole area after 24 hours was not 
less than 63 per cent. 

A final population estimate was made 48 hours after the 
"treatment, on June 23. The temperature was then much lower and 
the humidity much higher than at the previous two estimates, but

the barometer was rising rapidly, the wind speed had increased, 
and there had been no appreciable rain since the 24 hour estimate. 
The amount of water in the pools appeared to be approximately 
the same as that found at the beginning of the experiment; this 
is unfortunately not shown in the count on station 1, as this 
had been upset by contamination with oil from a passing vehicle. 
Larval counts in this estimate were accordingly taken at their 
face value, while pupae were valued at 2/3 larvae. Detailed 
figures are given in the third group in table 3, and a graphical 
interpretation of these in figure 31. The mean percentage 
mortality for the whole area after 48 hours was not less than 
81 per cent. 

Discussion: At the dosage used in this second experiment a 

useful mortality was obtained over the whole of the plot observed. 
It would have been of considerable experimental advantage, however, 
to have extended entomological observations to a greater depth 
from the base line, so that 50 per cent mortality at least were 
included within the observed area. 1000 yards would have been 
a more suitable figure. It appears from a consideration of the 
graph (Fig.31) that at this dosage, 50 per cent mortality could 
be expected at a distance of about 700 yards from the emission 
point, and that to obtain better than 90 per cent mortality over 
an area of country under these conditions, it would be necessary 
to traverse this at right angle to the wind direction at 
intervals of about 500 yards. 

Only one living specimen of Chaoborus sp. was taken 
in the 24 hour count (station 5), and none at all in the 48 hour 







93 


estimate. This would suggest 100 per cent mortality for this 
species at 220 yards, and consequently, that DDT is no less 
toxic to these larvae than it is to the larvae of Aedes . 

The low mortality figure for station 10 is attributable 
to the fact that this station was outside the plot boundary. 

The absence of any marked difference in mortality between the 
open and the heavily screened dipping stations would seem to 
indicate that in spite of the relatively large droplet size, 
the material was showing true aerosol characteristics. 

Weather conditions, as in the first trial were 
remarkably favourable: there ?/ere only about six days during 
this season-Y/hen both the mosquito larval population and the 
meteorological conditions were suitable for this method of 
dispersing insecticides. The most important adverse meteoro¬ 
logical factor is high wind speed. This coupled with the slowness 
in action v/ould be the main obstacles to the successful operation 
of this equipment here. A single machine in 1947, working 16 hour 
days whenever conditions were suitable, would have treated only 
a little over three square miles. With the existing mechanical 
shortcomings, even this figure could not have been approached, 
and in any event, the area would have to be selected for its 
traversable nature. A generator of greater capacity as used by 
Brescia and Wilson (11) or a battery of such generators, to 
permit continuous movement at about 4 m.p.h. would be a necessary 
development. 

The results obtained in both experiments are not in 
disagreement with those obtained in, or predictable from similar 
work elsewhere (25,33,58), so that there would not appear to be

any other special problems with regard to this method of 
insecticide application at high latitudes. Rather the general 
absence of very broken country would tend to favour the predict¬ 
able deposition of an aerosol. 

There is some evidence that high wind difficulty is 
partly a local effect only, resulting from sea breezes. Further 
inland, at least south of the tree line, more moderate wind 
speeds are to be expected, and in such areas, aerosol application 
should prove easier. It is relevant to note that both the adult 
mosquito and the aerosol, operate more satisfactorily at the 
lower wind speeds. 


5.1.2. A test of the Besseler Aerosol Generator 
against Adult Mosquitoes: 

An experiment was performed during the period July 1 
to July 3, 1947, to test the usefulness of the Besseler aerosol 
generator against adult mosquitoes in wooded country. Although 
the experiment was not a successful one, in that no very real 
test of the equipment resulted, nevertheless it proved of some 
value in demonstrating some of the difficulties which would 
face routine control measures equally with experimental work, 
in employing this generator in country such as that around 
Churchill. 

Two provisional plots for this experiment were selected 
on July 1. The first of these was in the vicinity of Farnworth 
Lake, to the south of Churchill, and could be treated from a 
vehicle on the Radio Range road, given a suitable southwest wind. 
The second was a strip of wooded country running north and south

about a half a mile beyond the eastern end of the east-west 
runway of the Churchill aerodrome. The wind on the morning 
of July 2 being from the south, it was decided to use the 
second of these plots for a test the same evening. Meteorological 
reports indicated that the wind might be expected to remain in 
the south, and that the wind speed should moderate. Detailed 
meteorological data were recorded. 

The locality was visited during the afternoon, and a 
400 yard base line was set out on a bearing of 100° from the 
point 951074. This gave a plot depth of nearly 1500 yards, the 
first 150 yards being open country, and the remainder woodland, 
mostly rather stunted spruce. The general appearance of the 
terrain is shown in figure 32. A wooded area some 500 yards west 
of the test plot was selected as the control area, and an 
alighting rate figure of 31 was obtained here, as compared with 
33 for the wooded area of the test plot. Each, figure is the mean 
of eight readings. All observers throughout the experiment wore 
one of four standard and comparable mosquito repellents on the 
face and hands. 

At 6.00 p.m. the wind was reported to be moderating, 
and from the same bearing, but the temperature had dropped 
considerably. It was decided to run the test, although conditions 
were far from ideal, truly ideal conditions being very rarely 
obtained at Churchill. By the time the equipment had been assembled 
the wind bearing had dropped 50° to 140 u , the speed, though rather 
high, was satisfactory, but the temperature had fallen to 56°F. 
and rain threatened. To compensate for the wind shift, the base 
line was reset to a bearing of 50° from the point 952075. This 
change resulted in the first 400 yards only of the plot depth

being in wooded country. At about 400 yards, a rocky cliff, 
some 30 feet in height, led up on to flat, higher, rocky open 
country, where the wind speed was considerably greater, extending 
back to the shore of Hudson Bay, 

Observers were stationed at 100 yard intervals from 
the base line to a depth of 900 yards. Hach observer took five 
readings, the individual readings at intervals of 25 yards 
along the central 100 yard portion of the plot at the distance 
at which the observer was stationed (Fig. 34). These five 
observations were taken immediately before the discharge of the 
aerosol commenced, and were repeated immediately after this was 
completed. Nil readings were obtained both before and after 
the release of the aerosol at all stations more than 400 yards 
from the base line; i.e., at all stations on the open and 
higher rocky area. Readings obtained at other stations are 
recorded in table 4. The mosquito species involved were A. 
nigripes , with some A. nea ret ions . 

The Besseler generator was mounted in a tracked 
amphibious trailer and towed by an amphibious weasel (Fig. 33). 
The insecticidal material employed in the generator was a 10 
per cent W/V solution of DDT in fuel oil with added Williams’ 

Red dye. The coil temperature employed was 300°F., equivalent 
to a mass mean droplet diameter of 20 microns and a discharge 

rate of 35 imperial gallons per hour. The equipment was moved 
along the base line, stopping at each 25 yards distance until 
the expiry of a three minute period from the time of leaving the 
previous stop. The total emission time was thus 48 minutes, 
during which period 21.5 gallons of insecticide were used. Since

this was expended over an actual front of 375 yards, this gives 
a figure of 5.73 gallons of solution, or 5.73 lbs. of DDT 
per 100 yards of front. Assuming practically all of this 
material to be deposited on the observed area, this would give 
a mean figure of 0.31 lbs. DDT per acre. 

The wind bearing during the emission period fluctuated 
between 150 and 170°, with a speed between 14 and 20 m.p.h. in 
the open, and 9-10 m.p.h. in the wooded area. No readings 
were taken on top of the rocky flat. The barometer was 
falling rapidly, and the air temperature dropped from 56 to 51°F. 
during the experiment, the relative humidity rising from 81 to 
94 per cent. The temperature gradient between one and two 
metres ranged from 0 to 0.12°C, giving a parameter R (8) value 
of 1.14 to 1.13. The sky was very heavily overcast almost 
throughout the test, and there was some very light rain. 

Emission started at 7.22 p.m. , and this, together 
with the conclusion of the emission at 8.10 p.m., was signalled 
to the observers in the plot by Yerey pistol. The aerosol was 
emitted from all four nozzles of the generator, the cloud 
drifting satisfactorily, though rather rapidly, into the woods. 
The observer at the 100 yard point reported the cloud visible 
after three minutes from the start of the emission, and the 
observer at 200 yards after 15 minutes. No observer on top 
of the rocky flat reported the cloud visible at any time, but 
the smell of the aerosol was noticed independently by observers 
at 800 yards and 900 yards, about 4 minutes after the start of 
the emission. No mechanical difficulties were encountered with 
the generator. This experiment clearly demonstrated the 














101 


disadvantage in experimental work of covering the area by 

f 

intermittent stops on s single run; wind shift during the 
emission was such that from the last two or three stops at the 
NE end of the line, none of the aerosol covered the plot at all. 

A final survey of the adult mosquito population was 
made at 5.0 p.m. on July 3, the figures obatined are recorded in 
table 4. Mosquitoes were active throughout the area, including 
the top of the rocky flat, and were very intent on feeding. The 
barometric pressure had fallen still further, but the wind speed 
was less and the humidity higher; other meteorological conditions 
were unchanged from the time of treatment. 

Discussion: It is not possible to say at all definitely how much 

of the reduction in immediate biting rate during the experiment 
was due to the action of the insecticide, and how much to adverse 
meteorological conditions. The fact that later in the season 
high alighting and biting rate figures were obtained with air 
temperatures down to 50°F. and even below this, with strong 
winds in addition, supports the view that the insecticide was 
the main cause of the reduced alighting rates. Observations in 
other experiments on plots up to one mile square sprayed from 
the air (McDuffie et al, Goldsmith et al) and also general 
observations on the habits of the species of mosquitoes involved 
here, indicate that complete repopulation of a plot this size, 
could readily occur within 24 hours. 

On the other hand, although the figures indicate a 
mean reduction in alighting rate of 94 per cent over the first 
400 yards of the plot, the percentage mortality obtained in the 
total population was probably very much less than this. David 










102 


and Bracey (17) have shown for droplets of 10 microns and less, 
that impact on the insect is brought about by movements of the 
insect rather than of the droplet. This probably remains in 
large measure true for droplets of the size used in this exper¬ 
iment, so that mortality among the resting mosquitoes, which at 
the time of treatment constituted a very large proportion of the 
total population, would have been very small. These resting 
mosquitoes were in fact probably very largely responsible for the 
rapid build up of a large active population after the treatment. 

The momentary and local smell of the aerosol which was 
detected on top of the rocky flat may be taken to indicate either 
that the high wind speed was inimical to uniform distribution, 
or that the wind direction being normal to the rocky cliff 
resulted in up currents being set up above this, which carried 
the bulk of the aerosol well clear of ground level. Probably 
a combination of these factors was operating. 

The absence of mechanical difficulties, and the greater 
discharge rate make the Besseler generator more satisfactory 
equipment for use in this area than the model of the Hochberg- 
Lamer generator employed in the earlier tests against mosquito 
larvae. The discharge rate of the Besseler generator, however, 
is still too low to permit the necessarily large area to be 
treated during the very short time when meteorological conditions 
may be expected to be suitable.

5*1.3. An Evaluation of some Insecticides against 
the immature stages of Blackflies: 

Introductory : 

Apart from work with miscible oils and pyrethrum 
preparations (24,80,81) which gave consistently uneconomic 
control, very little previous work has been done with insecticides 
against immature blackflies. In 1945 Fairchild (19) and 
Fairchild and Barreda (20) demonstrated that a number of species 
of Simulium occurring in Gautemala could be effectively 
controlled by the application of a DDT emulsion to give a 
concentration of 0.1 parts of DDT per million parts of water 
for a period of one hour, and that both a solution of DDT in a 
turpentine-kerosene mixture, and a suspension of DDT in water 
with a wetting agent were equally effective. Garnham and McMahon 
(22) have reported the local eradication of S. neavei Roubaud in 
Kenya colony in 1946, using the much higher concentrations of 
2 to more than 5 parts of DDT per million parts of water for 
exposure periods of 30 minutes. At these dosages mortality 
among fish and other animals was considerable. Steward (55) 
found that in the laboratory, 0*25 p.p.m. DDT for one hour 
caused almost complete mortality of Simulium larvae, while 
Gammexane gave similar results at 0.125 p.p.m. 

For purposes of comparison of these various exposure 
times and concentrations, it may be assumed that the time- conc¬ 
entration curve for any given mortality approximates to an 
hyperbola over the small range considered (15), and hence that:

concentration x time, is a constant. 

Dosages in these experiments may then be expressed as products 
of concentrations in parts per million and exposure time in 


104 


minutes as follows: 

Fairchild and Barreda - DDT 6 p.p.m./mins. 

Garnham and McMahon - DDT 60-more than 150 p.p.p./mins. 

Steward - DDT 15 p.p.m./mins.

It was decided to attempt to confirm these results 
under the conditions at Churchill, to compare the effect obtain¬ 
able with some other insecticides, and finally to explore the 
possibility of reducing the time of exposure required. In view 
of the great number of streams which would have to be treated 
for effective control in an area such as that around Churchill, 
the ability to do this would be of very great advantage. In 
addition it was hoped to obtain further data on possible toxic 
effects on eggs and pupae. 

The work may conveniently be reported in the form of 
seventeen experiments grouped into three main categories; two 
experiments involving aerial application of insecticides, fourteen 
involving direct application of insecticides to streams, and one 
experiment in which the pupal stage was treated with insecticides 
in the laboratory. Accounts of these experiments numbered 
serially throughout, from one to seventeen, are given below. 

The first two experiments in the second group are reported in 
somewhat greater detail than the remainder, since an attempt was 
made in these to secure quant i^-^yQ estimates of populations 
and mortalities; this was found to be impracticable, and 
qualitative estimates only, were attempted thereafter. The 
predominating species of blackfly in all experiments was 




105 


Simulium venusturn ; where other species were important, these are 
mentioned in the account of the experiment concerned. 

The following insecticidal preparations were employed 
in this work: 

1 - trichloro - 2 , 2 - bis(p-chlorophenyl) - ethane(DDT ): 

5 and 10 per cent W/V solutions in fuel oil with

Aerial spraying Experiments :(1) 

Two streams infested with blackfly larvae flowed in 
part through three plots marked out for aerial spraying trials 
against mosquito larvae and adults. A blackfly survey of these 
streams was made before the spraying to ascertain its effect on 
the blackfly larvae. The first of the streams flored through 
the first aerial spray plot only, for a distance of about 900 
yards. 

'The first half mile of the second stream was in the 
second aerial spray plot, described under experiment 2, the

second half mile in the third aerial spray plot, and only the 
last half mile in the first aerial spray plot. Sight observation 
stations were marked out in the first stream, and five in the 
last half mile of the second; at each of these stations there 
was a moderate to heavy population on the afternoon of June 27. 

No pupae were present at this time. The mean depth of each 
stream, and the rate of flow were estimated at the same time, the 
latter by timing a surface float over a measured distance to 
get the maximum speed, and calculating the total flow from the 
formulae: 

V* - 2/3.V (approximately) 

m 

and: Flow - V_.A 

a. 

where V is the measured maximum speed, V a the average speed, and 
A the cross sectional area of the water channel. This method 
was found to be sufficiently accurate for these small streams, 
providing suitably uniform sections of the stream were selected 
for measurement, and a sufficient number of timings taken. 

Spraying was carried out on the evening of June 27, 
the temperature of the water at this time was 58°F. Details of 
the spraying procedure are given elsewhere (McDuffie et al); it 
is sufficient to mention here that the material used was 5 per 
cent solution of DDT in fuel oil, and that this was put down at 
a mean concentration of 0.26 lbs. DDT per acre. The population 
of blackfly larvae was re-checked on the afternoon of June 28, 
and on July 21, and August 7. No living eggs, larvae, or pupae 
of any species of blackfly were found anywhere in the treated 
length of the first stream at any of these examinations. 

Untreated portions of the stream, and similar untreated streams 
in the same vicinity, continued to harbour immature stages until 













107 


at least August 7. In the treated length of the second stream, 
the only larvae found at the examination on June 28 were at 
station 5, where there were two or three half grown larvae per 
plant, on grasses rooted in the centre of the stream. This 
station was very near to the upstream limit of the treated length, 
so that the exposure time was very short indeed, and the insect¬ 
icide probably not well distributed. At the later examinations, 
which were made after the upper reaches of the stream had also 
been treated, no living eggs, larvae or pupae were found. 

The results of these observations, together with those 
on all streams treated in 1947 are summarised in table 5, and 
the locations of all treated streams, including those treated 
in 1948, are shown on the map in figure 55. DDT concentration 
in streams treated from the air was estimated on the assumption 
that all the material falling on the surface of the stream was 
carried along in it, as follows: 

Concentration in parts per million = 

0 

Deposit in lbs, per acre x 10 

4840 x 9 x Mean depth in feet x 62.5 

In the range of exposure time given, the minimum time 
represents the theoretical time for the water which received the 
spray to flow past the highest upstream observation station; the 
maximum time relates likewise to the furthest downstream station. 
In stream 1 the highest station was about half way between the 
limits of the sprayed length, so that here the minimum exposure 
time was quite high. 

Aerial spraying experiment (2): 

The second aerial spray plot covered half a mile of 
stream no. 2 from the source downwards. This was checked over

for blackfly larval population on the morning of June 30, 
immediately before the spraying, when 4 stations, each with a 
heavy to very heavy larval population were marked out. The 
temperature of the stream water was 55°F. The same insecticidal 
material was used in spraying this plot, but the deposit was 
0.48 lbs. DDT per acre; details of the spraying are given else¬ 
where (McDuffie et al). The stream was re-examined on the same 
afternoon about three hours after the end of the spraying, when 
the water temperature was 63°F. Only a very few sick looking 
larvae were found, less than 1 per cent of the previous population, 
all of them near the origin of the stream in a poorly defined 
area largely under water. Many of these were hanging on silk. 

A further examination on the morning of July 1, water temperature 
54°F., disclosed no living larvae at all, either in the treated 
stretch or below this. Subsequent examinations were made on the 
same dates as for stream no.l, and with the same results. 

Scum, consisting of insects, spray material, and debris, 
which had accumulated on vegetation at the margins of the stream, 
was collected in water on the afternoon of the spraying, and 
preserved in alcohol for later examination. Detailed examination 
was carried out at Edmonton from August 20, to 30, 1947, when 
the condition of the material was found to be such that 
identification of most insects beyond the family was not practicable

This represents a total of some 2600 specimens 
belonging to 37 different families, of which only 56 specimens 
(representing 2 families) belong to species it was desired to 
control. Of the remainder, many are parasites and predators, 
some of them, in the families which are to be controlled; others 
are competitors with these. Although this was clearly not a 
strictly random sample, it serves to indicate how insignificant 
the objective result of such an operation may be in comparison 
with its total effect on the biocoenotic equilibrium. 

The third aerial spraying operation, on the morning 
of July 3, put down a deposit of 0.26 lbs. DDT per acre on the 
half mile stretch of stream no.2, in between the portions 
treated in the first and second operations. As this stretch had 
been found to be without larvae two days previously, no further 
entomological observations were made on it at this time. In 
later surveys made on the other stretches of this stream, this 
stretch was found to be equally free of infestation. 

Direct Application of Insecticides to Streams : 

It had been intended to conduct these experiments 
primarily with emulsion formulations, as these appeared to be 
the logical preparations for this purpose. In view of the 
results obtained in the aerial spraying experiments with the 
cheaper and more readily obtained oil solutions, however, it was 
decided to concentrate on these, and to employ emulsions only 






112 


for the purpose of comparison. 

The first step in the procedure adopted was the select¬ 
ion of a suitable stream for experimental treatment; the require¬ 
ments are a high population of blackfly larvae, a well defined 
channel presenting a reasonable length without undue tributaries 
or distributaries, and suitable localities for flow measurement 
and insecticide application. Streams were surveyed in some 
detail, the amount of material needed to give the required 
concentration and time of exposure calculated approximately, and 
this amount applied if possible at the same time. Usually an 
observer would be present in the stream during the treatment, to 
watch the progress of the insecticide down the stream, and 
observe any immediate reactions of the blackfly larvae. In general 
the insecticide was applied a short distance from the upstream 
end of the surveyed length, in order to leave a portion of the 
stream undisturbed for check observations. The stream was then 
resurveyed as nearly as possible 24 hours after the treatment, 
and in most experiments, again when opportunity offered after 
another interval of about a week or more. 

Fourteen streams were treated in all, using various 
concentrations and exposure periods with each of the insecticides 
listed in the introductory section. The results are summarised 
in table 5. In special instances, samples of animal life 
presumably killed by the treatment were collected on screens 
fixed in the stream below the treated stretch. Water samples 
were also taken from these streams for pH and salinity deter¬ 
minations. Detailed accounts of each stream treated follow:

miles east of Churchill camp, shown on maps as Eastern Creek. 

It is a permanent stream, draining from an extensive area of 
lakes some three miles inland, and has a well defined bed of 
gravel and boulders. Throughout its length it flows through 
open tundra meadow, but there are patches of birch and willow 
near the mouth. The point selected for the application of 
insecticide was at the junction of two small tributaries from the 
west side, about a mile and a half stream length from the shore. 
The pre-treatment survey of this stream was made on July 10. 

Flow measurements were made at either end of the surveyed stretch 
as a check on the accuracy of the method, and good agreement 
between readings was obtained. The water was somewhat alkaline, 
with a pH of 8.46, the salinity much lower than that in other 
streams sampled, at 56 p.p.m. chlorides, measured as sodium 
chloride. Six observation stations were marked out as follows: 

1. 80 yards downstream from treatment point. Fine gravel 
bottom; deeper; slower current. Patches of larvae in lines 
at about 8 to the linear inch on stones. 

2. 380 yards downstream. Coarse gravel bottom; dimensions 
and flow similar to treatment point. Very heavy larval 
population on stones at the bottom and on vegetation at 
stream margins. 

3. 630 yards downstream. Island at eastern bank. Medium 
gravel bottom. 10 to 20 one-third grown larvae per linear 
inch on grasses. 

4. 880 yards downstream. Mixed clay and gravel bottom; 
stream breaks up round several islands. Very heavy 
population, all stages from newly hatched larvae to pupae. 

5. 1020 yards downstream. Boulders and very coarse gravel. 
Moderate population of half grown larvae on vegetation on 
the east side. Patchy heavy population on stones in centre 

6. 1410 yards downstream. Rapids; many very large boulders 
Patches of larvae on vegetation at sides and rocks in 
centre. One-third to two-thirds grown. 

Three species of Eusimulium , probably new species 
were present here in addition to S. venusturn . Two 3 foot by 4 
foot sampling screens with 16 meshes to the inch were fixed in 







114 


the stream, ten yards below station 6. 

Treatment was with 10 per cent DDT in oil solution 
by means of a gravity dispenser contrived by C.N.Husman. This 
consisted of a 4 gallon drum fitted with a wheel valve laterally 
near the bottom, leading through five feet of 3/8" bore rubber 
tubing to a four foot length of 5/8" bore copper pipe, and 
was calibrated for discharge rate at various valve settings 
beforehand. This was arranged with the container on the bank 
of the stream, and the outlet of the copper pipe held in a 
wooden support 2 - 3" above the water surface. Treatment was 
done on the afternoon of July 11, and the oil spread, mixed in, 
and carried well, although a strong SE breeze resulted in some 
piling up of insecticide in bays on the west bank. The concen¬ 
tration was one part DDT in ten million parts of water for an 
application time of 50 minutes. After 25 minutes treatment, 
larvae were beginning to release from the vegetation about 50 
yards downstream. Good turbulence immediately below the ’site 
of application was a primary factor in the good distribution 
obtained. 

The stream was examined again 24 hours after the treat¬ 
ment; no attached or living larvae were found at any of the 
observation points or elsewhere in the treated stretch. Specimens 
of pupae were collected from the treated and untreated portions 
of the stream for rearing. The screens from the downstream end 
were collected and the material from them preserved in conjunction 
with that from experiment 4 for later examination. 58 per cent 
emergence was obtained from pupae from the treated portion, so 
that there was no definite evidence of toxicity to pupae. A final 
examination of the stream was made on July 24, 15 days after the 




115 


treatment, by which time some reinfestation had taken place. 

No pupae were found, but there was a very general light 
infestation composed of all stages up to two-third grown 
larvae, with a preponderance of very young larvae. Unlike the 
streams draining into the Churchill River, there had been no 
great reduction in flow. 


Experiment 4 : This was done in a smaller stream than the last, 

draining from a small lake into Hudson Bay about 2~k miles east 

of Churchill camp. There was more variation in the character of 

this stream, which ran in some places between high banks, and 

had some stretches of clay, and some of sandy bottom. There was 

rather more vegetation along the banks than at Eastern Creek, the 

pH of the water was similar at 8.55, but the salinity was much 

higher at 143 p.p.m. Surveys and treatment were made on the 

same days as for experiment 3, the following 5 observation 

stations being marked out over a length of half a mile: 

l.S-bend, 160 yards below point of treatment: many pupae on 
vegetation and a few half grown larvae on stones. Coarse 
gravel bottom. 

2. 260 yards downstream. Island in centre of stream. Some 
pupae on stones very few larvae. Boulders. 

3. 560 yards downstream. Group of grassy islands in centre, 
fine gravel and sandy bottom. Few larvae and pupae on 
vegetation. 

4. 610 yards downstream. Rapids below small bay. Medium 
gravelly bottom. Many larvae on stones. 

5. 820 yards downstream. Small rapids; medium gravel with 
boulders. Yery few half grown larvae on vegetation, none 
on stones. 

The larval population in this stream had decreased 
greatly from that observed on previous visits on June 25 and 
July 7. Two new species of Eu si mu Hum were taken here. Flow 
measurements were taken at either end of the treated stretch, 
and a sampling screen was fixed 20 yards below station 5. 









116 


The same 10 per cent DDT in oil solution was used 
for treating this stream, but it was applied with an ordinary 
hand spray pump. Dosage and application time were the. same at 
0.1 p.p.m. for 30 minutes. 

During the first half of the treatment the material was 
sprayed onto the surface of the stream, with the jet held a few 
inches above the surface. It was found that some of the finer 
mist was carried away by the high wind, so that the procedure 
was changed to spraying with the jet held under water. This 
method seemed to be entirely satisfactory. 

No attached or living larvae were found on examination 
24 hours after the treatment. Pupae and eggs from the treated 
and untreated parts of the stream, and material from the gauze 
screens were collected. Adult emergence from the untreated 
pupal material was 71 per cent, and from the treated material 
47 per cent, giving a possible treatment mortality of 34 per 
cent. Eggs from the treated and untreated portions of the stream 
hatched uniformly with no detectable differences. The stream 
was examined again on July 25, when in spite of a greatly 
reduced flow, it was found to be liberally reinfested with all 
stages from egg to pupa. A final examination on August 11 shov/ed 
the stream very swollen by recent rain, with only a few larvae, 
very few pupae, all within the upper 100 yards, and no eggs. 

The material collected from the screens in experiments 
3 and 4 was examined as follows: 

The quantity of vegetable and inorganic debris mixed 
in with the specimens was such that it was necessary to remove 
all the larger fragments by hand for separate examination, and 
then to elutriate off the smaller particles, also for separate 









117 


examination. The quantity of material obtained was so great 
that complete counts were not practicable; a sample was taken 
by dispersing the specimens in alcohol in petri dishes, and 
making random complete counts on a number of fields of view 
under a binocular microscope. These counts were then added, and 
the material as a whole was scrutinized for the occurrence of 
organisms which did not show up in the sample counts. The results 
obtained by this method were as follows:

(* It is reported that only one previous record of

Representatives of the following groups were also 
encountered in the general scrutiny: Collembola, Trichoptera 
adults, Elateridae, Tenthredinidae, Tipulidae, Anthomyidae, 
and Mollusca - Pulmonata. With the possible exception of the 
beetles the material was not in good condition, and closer 
identifications could not be made. 

Experiment 5 : An appreciable proportion of the blackflies at 
Churchill breed in artificial drainage ditches of the type used 
in this and some of the succeeding trials. The turbulence in 
these channels is at all times rather less than in the streams, 
and late in the season is virtually absent. This channel was 
flowing very slowly indeed, but had a very heavy larval and 
pupal population for a surveyed length of 350 yards, the 
population decreasing thereafter. This length included a right 
angle bend under a railway culvert which provided ideal conditions 
for flow measurement, at a distance of 200 yards from the point 
of treatment. A sampling screen was fitted a further 200 yards 
downstream. This, and the streams in experiments 6 to 9 were all 
treated with insecticide on July 14. Treatment was again with 
10 per cent DDT in fuel oil, applied to give a concentration of

about one part DDT in two million parts of water for a period of 
15 minutes only. As the dosage required for this was only three 
ounces, this was applied by medicine dropper, and timed by 
stop watch. Pupae were collected from various situations in 
the stream before and after the treatment. The oil spread well, 
and moved slowly through the first part of the stream, more 
rapidly, and with better mixing further downstream. 

A preliminary examination at six hours after treatment, 
and the regular 24 hour examination both indicated that the kill 
of larvae was incomplete for the first hundred yards below the 
point of treatment, but complete thereafter throughout the 
surveyed length. Adult emergences were 21 per cent from the 
untreated pupae, and 48 per cent from the treated pupae, so that 
there was no evidence of pupal mortality due to the treatment. 

The screen was removed at the 24 hour survey, and the material 
collected from it was examined collectively vdth that from screens 
out of other drainage channels, the results are given under 
experiment 9. 

Experiment 6 ; This was done in a drainage channel very similar 
to the previous one, and with a very similar blackfly population, 
but for a distance of less than 100 yards only. There was a 
very heavy growth of shrubs along the banks, and the flow was 
rather greater than in no.5. 

‘The treatment of this channel was with fuel oil alone, 
for purposes of comparison with the results with insecticide 
solutions in fuel oil. This was applied by medicine dropper 
immediately after the survey was made, to give a concentration 
of one part of fuel oil to about 600,000 parts of water, for a

period of 15 minutes. - The behaviour of the material in the 
channel was similar to that of the insecticide in the previous 
trial. Pupae were collected before and after the treatment. 

A very slight and local release of larvae occurred 
just below the point of application, during the actual treatment; 
the situation after 24 hours was unchanged from this. Pupal 
emergence from the untreated sample was 51 per cent, and from 
the treated sample 54 per cent. 

Experiment 7 : This was done in a small tributary stream, flowing 
from Warkworth Creek into Goose River. There was great variation 
in width, the stream flowing through a small pool, and fanning 
out into a number of separate beds at its efflux into Goose 
River. The bed consisted of gravel, stones, and boulders, and 
the banks were rather open and grassy, but 'with spruce, larch, 
and dwarf willow growing a little back from them. There was a 
brisk flow, which was conveniently measured at the railway 
culvert, from which the insecticide was applied. 

For about 100 yards downstream from the culvert, the 
blackfly larval and pupal population was heavy, though somewhat 
localized; beyond this the population was sparser. 

This stream was treated by medicine dropper with 
10 per cent solution of Chlordane in fuel oil. The concentration 
used was about one part Chlordane in ten million parts of water 
for an application time of 15 minutes. Samples of pupae were 
collected before treatment and 24 hours after this. Good 
turbulence at the railway culvert aided distribution of the 
insecticide, which seemed to pass satisfactorily through the 
pool, and could be seen in the stream on the other side of this.

experiment 8, 1947.

123 


Some larvae could be seen to be releasing their hold on 
vegetation at the conclusion of the treatment for a distance of 
50 yards below the culvert. The stream was resurveyed 24 hours 
after treatment, when there was a noticeable reduction in the 
larval population near the point of treatment, although this 
did not extend very far, and even above the pool it was no 
longer perceptible. Percentage figures for pupal emergences 
were not obtained from this stream, but a high proportion of 
emergences was obtained from both treated and untreated batches. 

Experiment 8: This involved the treatment of Goose River itself 
(Fig. 36) at a point a little below the bridge on which the 
Churchill Railway crosses it. This is a substantial river, with 
a flow at the time of treatment of some 120 cusecs; unfortunately 
it was not possible to survey this to any great distance below 
the point of treatment, partly on account of inaccessibility, 
and partly because it breaks up into a maze of secondary streams, 
some of which were, however, encountered in the survey after 
experiment 10. There are small rapids immediately below the 
treatment point, and throughout the observed distance, the 
bottom is of large stones and boulders, with patches of moderate 
growth of filamentous algae and some higher plants. 

Stones and vegetation bore a heavy population of 
larvae, mostly nearing maturity, together with many pupae and 
some eggs. Samples of pupae were taken from just below the 
application point, and from 600 yards downstream. 

Treatment was with a 'water suspension of a 50 per cent 
DDT wettable powder, applied by a Dobbins portable pressure 
sprayer, the operator wading bank and forth in tne stream. 





124 


The concentration used was about one part DDT in thirteen 
million parts of water, applied for 20 minutes. During this 
time there was an interval of 5 minutes for pumping up the 
sprayer. The insecticide was applied on the morning of July 14, 
the operator making four double crossings of the river. 

The 24 hour survey of this river revealed a very 
considerable reduction in the larval population, only a few 
scattered living larvae were found, from the line of application 
to a distance of 350 yards downstream. Beyond this distance, 
pupae only were found to a total distance of at least 500 yards. 
Substantial emergence of adults was obtained from both treated 
and untreated pupae. 

E xperiment 9 : This ’was done in a drainage channel, similar 
to those used in experiments 5 and 6, with very little flow, 
and practically no turbulence. Flow estimates were made at 
the railway culvert, where the insecticide was applied also. 

There was a heavy population of all stages of larvae 
and of pupae for a surveyed distance of 400 yards below the 
treatment point. Simulium venusturn was the dominant species 
here, but Eusimuliu m iatipes was also present. A sampling 
screen was used here. 

A still further reduced dosage was applied here in 
an attempt to discover what the marginal dosage would be. 
Three-quarters of an ounce of 10 per cent DDT solution was 
applied over a period of five minutes, giving a concenoration 
of about one part DDT in eight million parts of water. 

On resurveying after 24 hours there- was found to be 
only a slight reduction in the numbers of larvae near the 








125 


point of application. The reduction increased further downstream 

to a maximum of about 50 per cent from 75 yards onwards* Most 
of the treated pupae which were taken from this stream gave 
rise to adults. 

The material collected from the sampling screen in 
this experiment was examined collectively with that from 
experiments 5 and 6. The procedure adopted in examining this 
material was the same as that described under experiment 4, 
except that the number of animal specimens obtained was so small 
that there was no difficulty in removing and counting every 
specimen. This was probably partly because of the much slower 
current and the greater proportion of vegetable matter suspended 
in the water, screens becoming choked with this material, and 
hence inoperative, before many specimens had been caught* The 
much smaller variety of species obtained is interesting:

Experiment 1 0: This experiment was carried out on Warkworth 
Greek, which, with a flow of about 270 cusecs, was the largest 
river treated. Flow measurements and treatment were both made 
from the only convenient location, the Churchill Railway bridge. 
In view of the size of the river, a somewhat more accurate 
method was employed for measuring flow, applying Simpson* s 
Rule, and using the bridge piers as ordinates. The bottom of 
Warkworth Creek is covered with large boulders, and there is 
moderate vegetation. The Creek breaks up into a number of 
streams, unites with Goose River, flows through a fair sized 
lake, and again breaks up into streams, before finally emptying 
into the Churchill River some five miles below the bridge 
from which it was treated. 

A full survey of the population of blackflies was 
not made before the treatment; some two hundred yards of the 
river, above and below the bridge ,had been under observation 
for some days. There was an abundant population of pupae and 
larvae, the latter mostly between maturity and half growth, 
on rocks and vegetation wherever the flow/ was adequate. 

The flow/ estimate w/as made and treatment was carried 
out between eight and nine o'clock on the evening of July 15. 

2§ imperial gallons of a 10 per cent DDT solution were applied 
over a period of 15 minutes. Application was made by two 
operators with portable pressure sprayers, walking back and forth 
along the railway bridge, and directing the spray down at the 
water surface. Each operator worked from one half of the bridge.

There was a slight loss of material, carried by wind, and 
deposited on the bridge structure. The calculated concentration 
was about one part DDT in six million parts of water. 

24 hours after treatment a few larvae were still found 
on rocks to a distance of about 100 yards from the bridge. 

Beyond this, the main channels of the river were examined 
thoroughly to a distance of 2£- miles. For part of this distance 
the water is mixed with that from Goose River (experiment 8). 

No larvae of any description were found beyond 100 yards from 
the bridge. Pupae were collected from 1^ and 2 miles downstream, 
and gave adult emergences of 55 and 80 per cent respectively. 

Many fish, including suckers up to 18 11 in length were seen, a 
good catch of jackfish was made at the bridge by a fishing 
expedition two days later, and no complaints of dead fish or 
reduced yield were made by the trapper who keeps his dogs on 
the fish from fish traps about 200 yards upstream from the bridge. 

Experiment 11 : This experiment involved a second treatment on 
the drainage channel which was treated, but not disinfested, on 
July 14 (experiment 9). There was a heavy population before the 
treatment, consisting mainly of larvae. 

Treatment was with a 25 per cent DDT emulsion 
concentrate, applied by medicine dropper to give a concentration 
of about one part DDT in two million parts of water for a period 
of 15 minutes. Treatment was done at nine o’ clock on the morning 
of July 18; examination at five o’clock on the evening of July 
19 disclosed a single living larva below the treatment site, a 
heavy population remaining above. 






128 

Exper i men t 12 : The stream used in this experiment drains from 
the Isabelle Lake system in a southwesterly direction, and is 
controlled by a sluice gate and weir. The bed of the stream 
is well defined for a length of about 80 yards only, thereafter 
the water fans out into a grassy marsh. The stream was shallow 
at the time of treatment, with a coarse gravel bottom, the 
margins and the bed itself becoming more grassy proceeding 
downstream. Earlier in the season, this stream harboured as 
large a population of blackfly larvae as was to be found 
anywhere close to the camp, but this population was well past 
its peak at the time of treatment. Flow was measured at the 
sluice gate. Pupae for rearing were taken before and after 
treatment, and the pupae used in experiment 17 were collected 
later, from the top of this stream. 

A benzene hexachloride emulsion concentrate containing 
5 per cent gamma isomer was applied at a point 20 yards below 
the sluice gate on the afternoon of July 20. The emulsion was 
diluted to four times its volume with stream water, and was 
applied by dribbling it in from a graduate at the rate half and 
ounce per minute for 15 minutes. The calculated concentration 
was one part gamma BHC in ten million parts of water. In view 
of the small length of stream available for observations, the 
insecticide was mixed in just below the point of application 
with a paddle. 

Towards the end of the treatment larvae could be 

seen beginning to let go, and a few minutes later, large numbers 
of them were trailing on silks from their points of attachment. 
Examination after 24 hours, however, revealed at least 50 per 




129 


cent of the larvae of all ages still present, alive and active; 
water temperature was 62°F. The percentage adult emergences 
from the treated and untreated pupal samples were 12 and 82 
per cent respectively, so that there is evidence of considerable 
pupal mortality due to this treatment. Further examinations of 
this stream on July 28 and August 6, showed that the population 
developed normally. 

Experiment 13 : This stream was not treated until July 21, by 
which time lack of rain had left but little water in most of the 
streams, and correspondingly small blackfly populations. This 
stream flows through the area of heavy birch and willow shrub 
growth adjoining the tidal flats on the east bank of the 
Churchill River. A point of junction with a second stream was 
selected as suitable for the application of insecticide,and 650 
yards length of the stream below this point was surveyed. The 
bottom was largely mud with scattered stones; the banks with a 
very heavy growth of shrubs. Flow was measured in each of the 
tributaries separately and added, the main stream offering no 
length suitable for measurements. 

The larval population was evaluated on the basis of 
observations at 20 stations; at most of these there was a moderate 
to heavy population of rather mature larvae. 

Pyrenone emulsion concentrate was applied by dribbling 
in from a graduate to give a concentration of one part piperonyl 
butoxide to two million parts of water for a period of fifteen 
minutes. This was mixed in v/ith a paddle. The temperature of 
the stream water at the time of treatment was 61°F. 

During the treatment, observations were made on larvae

at a point 50 yards below tlie application site, where the 
presence of the insecticide in the water could just be detected. 
Six minutes after the first arrival of treated water, larvae 
started to double up repeatedly, and the first larvae released 
after a further four minutes. By the end of the treatment the 
great majority of the larvae had released. At the resurvey 24 
hours later however, there was found to be considerable infestat¬ 
ion remaining in the stream. Only at the first three stations 
was there anything approaching effective control, the maximum 
reduction in larval population further downstream being less 
than 50 per cent. Specimens of treated and untreated pupae 
gave 46 and 50 per cent adult emergences respectively. 

Experiment 14 : This stream runs parallel to that treated in the 
previous experiment, and is very similar to it in character 
except that the upstream portion of it consists of a straight 
drainage channel, which provided very suitable conditions for 
measurements of flow. Vegetation on the banks was somewhat 
lighter, the bottom had more gravel and sand, the water was 
clearer, and the blackflv population rather heavier. Observations 
were made at 16 stations distributed over a length of 1500 yards. 

A 25 per cent DDT emulsion concentrate was applied 
for fifteen minutes on the morning of July 21 to give a 
concentration of one part DDT to ten million parts of water. 
Application was by dribbling in from a graduate, and mixing 
with a paddle. The temperature of the water was 62°F. 

The larval population at a point 50 yards below the 
treatment site wan observed during the treatment, but the only 
reaction was the release of a very small proportion of the larvae

towards theend of the application. At the 24 hour examination 
no blackfly larvae, living or dead, could be found anywhere in 
the treated part of the stream; water temperature at this time 
had fallen to 55°F. Many other insect larvae, especially those 
of chironoraids and ephemerids, were seen living and apparently 
unaffected by the treatment. Treated and untreated pupal 
blackfly samples gave emergences of 60 and 64 per cent 
respectively. A final examination on July 31 showed the treated 
stretch still without larvae or pupae, these two stages being 
present in about equal numbers in the untreated length of the 
stream. 

Experiment 15 : This experiment, and the succeeding one, were 
done in a portion of Eastern Creek upstream from that utilized 
in experiment 3. The conditions of terrain and stream bottom 
were similar to those in experiment 3, but as these streams 
were tributaries which unite to form the main stream of Eastern 
Creek, width and flow were less, although the depth was about 
the same. In this experiment, a single application was used for 
observations on the effect of two different concentrations by 
treating a short distance above the influx of a tributary, flow 
rates being measured both for the main stream and for the 
tributary. 

Infestation before treatment was heavy, and consisted 
almost entirely of larvae on stones. Vegetation was very scanty, 
and although empty pupal cases were quite numerous, no living 
pupae were found. 

Treatment was with 5 per cent gamma, BHC emulsion 
concentrate, to give concentrations of one part in five million 







132 


and one part in ten million, above and below the tributary 
influx respectively. Application was by dribbling from a 
graduate and mixing in with a paddle, the application period 
being 15 minutes. The temperature of the stream water was 
63°F. 

The treated stretch was resurveyed on the afternoon 
of the following day. In the 20 yard length above the junction 
(i.e. at the higher dosage), a few living larvae remained 
attached to the rocks. Below the junction, the reduction in 
population was less than 50 per cent. 

Experiment 16 : This stream was another of the upper tributaries 
of Eastern Creek, similar in character to that used in the previous 
experiment. The larval population was rather heavier, but again 
no living pupae were found. A hundred yard length of the 
tributary wassurveyed, and a situation with good turbulence 
was found for the application of the insecticide. The material 
used for treatment was a 25 per cent Toxaphene emulsion 
concentrate; this was diluted with stream water, and applied 
by dribbling in from a graduate to give a concentration of about 
one part in six million over a period of 15 minutes. This 
application imparted a distinct milkiness to the stream water, 
but no release of larvae during the application could be seen 
to occur. Treatment was done on the morning of July 24, and the 
stream was re-examined on the afternoon of July 25. No change 
in the larval population could then be detected.

stream treatments on the pupal stage of s . venusturn . An attempt 
was also made to obtain some information on the time-concentration 
relationship for a fixed blackfly pupal mortality, with a given 
toxicant of proved practical value. 

erlment_17: A large batch of pupae in cocoons attached to 
grasses was collected from the stream used in experiment 12 at 
2. J p.m. on July 18, and water for the preparation of insecticide 
dispersions was collected at the same time and place. The 
temperature of the water was 60°F., pH was 8.4 and salinity 130 
p.p.m. 

Dispersions of the insecticides were prepared in the 
following concentrations, expressed as parts per million.

DDT, chlorinated camphene, and Chlordane: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 

1.6, 3.2, 6.4, and 12.'8; pyrethrum-piperonyl butoxide (P.P.B.), 
based on piperonyl butoxide content: 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 

16.0, 32.0, and 64.0. One check container of plain stream water 
was used for each batch of dispersions. 

Batches of twenty pupae retained in their cocoons on 
vegetation were then immersed, each for one minute, one batch 
in each of trie above dispersions, including the check containers 
of plain water. The batches immersed in the insecticides were 
rinsed briefly in water from the same stream before setting them 
aside for emergence in covered jars containing a little moist 
cotton wool. During immersion the specimens were kept moving 
slowly through the liquid to simulate the effects of stream 
flow. 'The treatments were commenced at 4.0 p.m. on July 18 with 
0.02 p.p.m. gamma-BHC, and continued with increasing concentrations 






134 


of this material, followed in sequence by DDT, chlorinated 
camphene, P.P.B., and Chlordane, each in increasing concen¬ 
tration. Treatment was completed at 8.10 on the same evening. 
During the treatment, most of the larvae present on the vegetation 
were washed off into the treating fluid and were allowed to remain 
there, at least ten larvae of varying size in each vessel. 
Observations at 9.0 a. id. on the next day showed some of the 
larvae to be still living in the following containers: 

All containers of plain stream water. 

Gamma-BHC: 0.02, and 0.04 p.p.m. 

DDT: 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4, p.p.m. 

Chlorinated camphene: 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 p.p.m. 

P.P.B.: none. 

Chlordane: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 6.4 p.p.m. 

Records of adult emergence were made on July 19 and 22, 
and a final count was made on July 23. In a few batches a 

conspicuous fungus growth developed and emergence was much 
less than anticipated, but apart from this there was good 
correlation between concentration and mortality, and emergence 
in the controls was very uniform. The results obtained are set 
out in table 6, and the graphical expression of these results in 
figure 38 indicates L.D. 50*3 for gamraa-BHC and chlorinated 
camphene of 0.15 and 1.9 p.p.m./minutes respectively. The 
mortality given by DDT, P.P.B., and Chlordane was too erratic 
for reliable interpretation, and was not sufficient at any 
concentration to compare favourably with that given by the above 
two materials. 

These results indicate the desirability of investi¬ 
gating the relationship between exposure time and concentration 
for a given mortality for gamma-BHC. Attempts to do this were 
unsuccessful on account of a dwindling pupal population.

Discussion: There has been some controversy as to whether 
DDT and other insecticides actually kill the blackfly larvae 
in treated streams, or whether they merely cause them to release 
their hold, possibly to reattach further downstream, where the 
concentration may be reduced by the junction of tributaries 
and the influx of drainage water. In the Churchill locality, 
the opportunities for re-attachment are slight, and may only 
present themselves to larvae in streams draining into the 
Churchill River. The evidence from this work however, is that 
the larvae are actually killed; certainly no living larvae 
were removed from any sampling screens, and since the exposure 
period for released larvae moving downstream in the treated 
water would be greater than that for those caught on the screens 
or remaining attached, it is unlikely that any of them survive. 

The duration of treatment has been recorded as 
application period and. not as exposure period, since the latter 
naturally increases with the distance from the application site. 
The concentration, likewise, is that theoretically obtaining 
at the application site; this figure undergoes a corresponding 
decrease as the distance from the point of application increases. 
At any given point downstream, the concentration increases 
gradually to the maximum, and decreases again more gradually 
from the maximum to zero, the rate of both the increase and the 
decrease being less at greater distances downstream. There is 
no evidence that these factors have any appreciable influence 
on the mortality obtained for a distance of at least several 
miles downstream. 

The susceptibility of blackfly larvae to DDT appears 








138 


remarkable, until it is recalled that as a contact insecticide 
this material normally has access to the tarsi, or at least 
to restricted areas of the body only, whereas the whole of 
the integument of the blackfly larva is exposed to DDT. 

ihe application of DDT in oil solution from the air 
at 0.25 lbs DDT per acre immediately before the first blackfly 
pupae are lorraed, will effectively control for the season the 
common arctic species of blackfly breeding in the area sprayed, 
in screams up to lr> feet in mean depth. Heavier dosages might 
be required for deeper streams. It would seem likely, that 
with suitable delivery rates, a single swath applied along the 
course of smaller streams, and a swath along either bank.with 
the shore line as swath centre for the larger streams, would 
prove equally effective, and this would be a very practicable 
procedure. 

Such a procedure, however, would involve greater 
expense and, judging from the variety of insects killed, a far 
greater interference with the balance of nature, than the 
more laborious procedure of direct application to the streams. 
Until the effects of this interference .are more fully under¬ 
stood, it seems desirable that the aerial method be employed 
in special circumstances only. Similar mortality in diverse 
groups of insects has previously been shown to occur as a result 
of aerial spraying operations in Panama (2). Direct application 
to streams of DDT in oil solutions to give one part in ten million 
for 15 minutes caused remarkably little interference with other 
life, but is somewhat more arduous and might have to be repeated, 
the first treatment being given immediately before the start of 
pupation, and the second two or three weeks later. Rarely is

there an opportunity to control an economically important 
insect by using such an efficient, naturally provided, means 
of distributing and insecticide as the flow of a stream. 

Advantage should be taken of this opportunity. If further 
studies confirm that gamma-BHC is an effective pupicide, it 
might be possible to avoid a second treatment by applying a 
mixture of DDT and gamma-BHC just before the emergence of the 
first adults. This would increase the cost of materials, but 
would reduce the labour cost and would interfere less with the 
normal life of the stream. 

The greater residual effect of treatment from the air 
appears to be due primarily to the continued infiltration of a 
very small concentration of DDT into the stream, washed off 
rocks, the soil, and to some extent vegetation by rain and by 
drainage water. Mortality of adults during and after the spraying 
operation may be a contributary factor. A further possibility 
is that, as Provost maintains, adult blackflies return to the 
stream in which they matured to lay their eggs (43); the streams 
treated from the air were the only ones which had produced no 
pupae prior to treatment. However, the reinfestation of these 
streams in July 1948, suggests that this tendency is not manifest, 
at least in the earliest generation. 

Some development of equipment is required for routine 
direct application stream treatments. The requirements are, a 
simple form of current meter to enable a ready and reasonably 
accurate estimate of flow to be made, and a suitable dispenser. 

The latter should consist of a stock tank to hold perhaps ten 
gallons of material, leading to a flow meter consisting of a 
differential pressure gauge and a variable orifice, controlled

by a wheel valve. The* dispenser should be calibrated to give 
the required flow of insecticide at each setting for a concen¬ 
tration of one part DDT in ten million parts of water, using 
a ten per cent solution of DDT in fuel oil. The whole apparatus 
should be designed to fit on a folding tripod stand which could 
be set up in a small stream, on the bank, or in a boat. Two 
men with this equipment and a paddle, stopwatch, measuring stick 
and tape, could treat streams with a flow up to 250 cusecs 
rapidly and conveniently, and the problem would by reduced to 
the ever present problem of transportation. A shallow draught 
boat with outboard motor would assist here, and the motor could 
be employed also to secure good distribution of insecticide, 
taking the place of a paddle in the larger streams. 

What previous evidence there is seems to suggest that 
the direct effects of DDT on animals other than insects in 
ponds and tidewater are unlikely to be serious (59), even at 
concentrations of one part DDT in three million parts water, 
with exposure time limited only by the stability of the compound. 
Observations during this work do not entirely support this view; 
the possibility of accumulated concentrations of DDT in lakes 
fed by repeatedly treated streams should not be lost sight of. 
Indirect results can also be serious; blackfiy larvae for example, 
form a significant food item of fish, especially suckers, which 
are themselves important food of sled dogs. 

1948 work with Ins ecticides ag ainst immatu re,stages 
ofBl ackflies : 

The much drier conditions in 1948, and the earlier 
use of considerable areas of country for experimental spraying with 











141 


DDT from the air prevented extensive work with insecticides 
in streams. The results obtained with DDT in 1947, were however 
confirmed by applications to Eastern Creek, using the same 
stretch of the creek again, and to Herriot Creek (708885), 
flowing into the Churchill River from the west, some 25 miles 
south of Churchill. In 1948 flow measurements were made with 
a Gurley flow meter; the method used in 1947 was checked against 
this meter, and gave figures agreeing within 5 per cent. 

A preliminary test of a wettable powder containing 
15 per cent “Parathion" ( o,o-diethyl o-p-nitrophenyl thiophos- 
phate) was made, and both this material and gamma BHC were 
tested for toxicity to blackfly eggs. Results obtained in these 
tests are summarised in tables 7 and 8. 

The stream used in the first experiment has its origin 
at 951054 and drains into a small lake on the tundra east of 
Churchill camp. The water temperature at the time of treatment 
was 62°F and the pH 7.5. Since this was a' new toxic material a 
sampling screen was used; an analysis of a portion of the material

In so far as it was possible to decide on a field examination, 
the crustacean material was all alive at the time of collection, 
24 hours after treatment; the insect material however, was 
dead. Adults emerged from 6? per cent of pupae collected 
before treatment, as compared with 25 per cent from pupae 
collected immediately after treatment, and 20 per cent from 
pupae collected 24 hours later, so that f, Parathion H appears 
to have appreciable toxicity to pupae. 

The second and third experiments confirmed the 
effectiveness against larvae of DDT at 1.5 p.p.m./minutes. 

The length under observation in Herriot Creek (FIG. 37) was 
greater than that in any 1947 test. 

Both gamma-BHC and f, Parathion u especially, appear to 
have useful ovicidal properties against blackflies. The L.D. 

50's for these materials are of the order of 4 and 6 p.p.m./ 
minutes respectively. 

A. few tests against caged fish of insecticides 
suitable for blackfly control were made in 1948. Neither 
jackfish, suckers, nor sticklebacks were permanently affected 




I 










145 


by dosages of DDT up to 300 p.p.ra./minutes, although jackfish 
especially became violently agitated after about six minutes 
at the higher concentrations, and many were unconscious at 
the end of the exposure. Suckers withstood 15 minutes in 
"Parathion" at 1 part in 100,000. 

Discussion ; M Parathion", by virtue of its apparent toxicity 
to both eggs and pupae, and apparent harmlessness to stream 
Crustacea, would appear to offer advantages over DDT. Its cost 
however is greater, and it is believed to be much more toxic 
to man. 


5.2. Protection of the Person from Biting Fly Attack. 

It is clear from the results set out in 5.1, that the 
possibility of economical routine control of the numbers of 
Aedes mosquitoes, at least of the migratory species (reputedly, 
A. nigripes . A. nearcticus , and A. camoestris ) by chemical 
means is not very great. Even with DDT, to ensure freedom from 
mosquitoes in a single locality would require an annual spraying 
of an area of the order of at least a thousand square miles 
( say a circle of 20 miles radius ), an operation which would 
cost about a million dollars. As far as tabanids are concerned, 
the chemical approach is even less encouraging, and it is only 
against blackflies that this method seems at all hopeful. 


The information available relative to the second approach

to biting fly control is indicated in sections 1 to 3; it is 
quite inadequate, as yet, for any but the most tentative 
suggestions as to how this might possibly be initiated. 

By elimination, there remains for consideration 
only the third approach. 


5.2.1. Repellents: 

Although very great improvements in repellents for 
biting flies have been made in the last few years by the 
application of routine test methods on a very large number 
of materials, further significant progress cannot be expected 
without more fundamental work on the factors which attract 
biting flies to their hosts, and on the mode of action of 
repellents. 

In 1947 a study was made of the relative effectiveness 
of four standard insect repellents, twelve other liquid 
repellents, and two repellent creams. Primarily, the study 
was against Aedes mosquitoes, but the abundance of blackflies 
in the areas used for tests, allowed simultaneous tests against 
these insects. Accepted standard methods of test were 
employed. 

Of the standard repellents, dimethyl phthalate 
afforded the longest protection against both mosquitoes and 
blackflies, averaging 381 minutes and 393 minutes respectively. 
Repellent mixture 6-2-2, which contains 6 parts dimethyl 
phthalate, 2 parts Rutgers 612 ( 2-ethyl-l,3-hexanediol ), 
and 2 parts Indalone ( n-butyl mesityl oxide oxalate ), was 



147 


only slightly inferior to dimethyl phthalate in protection 
time. Rutgers 612 afforded less protection against mosquitoes 
than any other standard material, and repellent N.M.R.I. 448 
( 30% 2-cyclohexyl cyclohexanol, 70% 2 phenyl cyclohexanol ) 
gave good protection against mosquitoes, but afforded less 
protection against blackflies than any other standard. 

Of the remaining materials, only n-propyl N,i\F-diethyl 
suceinamate afforded a protection time greater than that 
given by dimethyl phthalate. It is doubtful whether the 
improvement is sufficient to justify the adoption of this 
material, should it prove sufficiently non-toxic. 

All materials in use suffer from the considerable 
drawback of being plasticisers, softening and dissolving 
plastics, paints, and varnishes. Some of the inconvenience 
of this could be avoided by eliminating these materials and 
finishes as far as possible on equipment such as axe and other 
tool handles, pencils, etc. which are regularly handled in 
the open. 

All observations made on repellents used while 
working in the field agree in respect of two general conclusions. 
These are, firstly, that there is little apparent difference 
in the effectiveness of the four standard repellents tested 
here, under conditions of actual use; and secondly, that with 
a heavy and aggressive population of mosquitoes, and normal 
activity of the subject in field work, the best of the repellents 
may require renewal at least as often as once every hour. 

Under very severe conditions; perspiration, working in water 
or through heavy vegetation, the period of adequate protection 
may of course be further reduced. The application of repellent

by hand to the outside of the clothing, particularly across 
the shoulders, round the waist, and on the seat of the trousers 
has material protective value. 

The application of repellent in the field is awkward; 
both hands are required, and if the bottle is set down, such is 
the distraction of the biting fly attack that it is forgotten 
with surprising frequency. The use of a liquid soap dispenser 
for insect repellent was introduced by Mr. J. Myler of the 
Edmonton City Parks Department, and proved very successful in 
Golf clubs and Ball grounds in Edmonton during 1948. This 
method could well be adopted in permanent military camps, such 
dispensers being mounted at the outside doors of buildings, and 
kept filled during the fly season. 

Attempts to find repellents which can be administered 
orally are not, as yet, promising; this idea was first 
recommended by Ochman in 1911 (68), but little work has been done 
on these lines until quite recently. 

The term repellent is an unfortunate one, implying as 
it does, an action at a distance which these materials do not, 
in fact, exhibit. Modern repellents are .gustatory rather than 
olfactory in their action; this fact, and the resulting 
necessity for the application of a thin continuous film needs 
to be pointed out to inexperienced users. 


5.2.2. Protective Clothing and Shelters: 

Many insects attacking man, are less inclined to do 
so through clothing of non-animal origin, and this appears to

apply to mosquitoes; many observers have recorded that biting 
is worse through woollen fabrics than through cotton of similar 
texture. 

Extensive tests have been carried out with materials 
of cotton and artificial fibres, mainly against nedes aegypti 

and veiy satisfactory materials are known (3). These materials 
are however mostly expensive and often uncomfortable to wear. 
Annand et al (4) have found that coarse open mesh materials 
worn underneath garments of highly permeable fabric prevent 
the biting of A. aegypti in the laboratory. Field trials of 
string vests, which are normal military issue in winter were 
made during 1948, and worn under ordinary cotton twill shirts 
gave complete protection under very severe conditions. This 
arrangement proved much more comfortable than closely woven 
materials. In this 1 distance piece* type of clothing, the 
thickness of the open mesh material should, of course, be 
comparable with the proboscis length of the mosquitoes concerned. 
A. nigripes has the longest proboscis of the Churchill Aedes 
with 0.42 cm. 

In general, the looser the clothing the less it is 
bitten through; biting through is worst whenever and wherever 
the cloth is stretched tightly over the skin. 

Gjullin (23) has shown for several species of Aedes 
that biting is worse through dark coloured materials than it 
is through light coloured, and states that colours are chosen 
on the basis of their spectral reflectances. Observations in 
section 3.1.3 would seem to suggest that it may be spectral 
absorption and consequently surface temperature which is the 
deciding factor, rather than reflectance. Whatever the reason,

lighter colours are certainly to be preferred. 

Blackflies and tabanids do not bite through clothing; 
but the former are very active and persistent in their efforts 
to gain an entrance to the space between clothing and body. 
Carefully designed closures are necessary to prevent this. 

Properly designed clothing should reduce the psycho¬ 
logical as well as the physiological effects of biting flies; 
that is, in addition to preventing biting, it should obviate 
the necessity for the ’removal reaction', and should minimise 
the impact of insects, at least on the face. The use of a fly 
fringe - eye length in front and shoulder length behind - in 
place of a net, might have advantages by virtue of its greater 
mobility, in reducing the need for removal reaction at less 
sacrifice of comfort and vision. Such a device would also be 
less inclined to get caught in vegetation, and would suffer 
less if it did so; the principle seems to be embodied in the 
improvised headgear of some of the Churchill residents. 

The impact of insects can only be eliminated by 
wearing a head net, and if necessary, arm nets. It seems 
reasonable to suggest that if a net has to be worn it might as 
well be one which will exclude everything, including blackflies 
and (possibly) no-see-ums, but cost is presumably a factor here. 
Certainly, the comfort advantages of a wide mesh net do not more 
than outweigh the necessity for keeping it doped with repellent, 
and the inconvenience of the occasional blackfly penetration. 
There may be some advantage in a net held sufficiently clear of 
the face to enable the eyes to focus on it, and hence also on 
any insects which may alight on it. Arm nets have few advantages 
and many disadvantages as compared with sleeves. 




151 


'The fly-proof shelter is a much neglected means of 

providing relief from the attentions of biting flies 5 it is 
the only single measure which will eliminate completely all 
the elements of the biting fly attack. The psychological 
effects respond to the provision of such a shelter as they 
will to no other treatment. 

Arctic biting flies in general are out-of-door insects; 
they do not congregate in large numbers, even in relatively 
unprotected buildings, nor do they cause such serious discomforts 
when they are inside them. Accordingly it should not prove 
difficult to render tents and shelters for use in the field 
sufficiently fly proof for practical purposes, nor to design and 
produce a special ’fly-refuge* for the use of field parties. 

Such a structure should be light, quickly and simply erected, and 
have plenty of headroom; a double door entrance to enable 
users to get rid of their accompanying swarm of biting flies 
before entering the main chamber is an advantage. The roof as 
well as the walls should be of screening; a solid roof serves as 
a great attraction to tabanids. Perfectly serviceable temporary 
shelters have been improvised in the forest with no other materials 
than a roll of cheesecloth, an axe, and a packet 01 tacks, and 
have proved invaluable. The aerosol bomb as at present produced, 
is a ready and efficient, if somewhat expensive, method of 
clearing out such shelters when erected. The mere knowledge of 
the existence of such a refuge, supplemented possibly by the 
right to get into it for say, five or ten minutes in every hour 
and relax, with flies kept at a distance, is of very great value 
to men working in the field. 



152 


o.2.d. Other Aspects of Protection and Control: 

Attempts have been made to immunise animals so that 
eitner mosquitoes will not feed on them, or that they will 
not react to bites received, buch attempts are unlikely to 
succeed until the factors which attract mosquitoes and the 
causative agents of reaction to their bites are understood. 

Dubin et al (18) working with Anopheles qua d rimaculatus and 
rabbits succeeded only in sensitizing these. 

With regard to the control of tabanids very little 
work has been done. Neither the ’pools of death' nor the 
carrying of black adhesive shields recommended by Porchinsky (77) 
can be regarded as very practicable in circumstances such as 
are encountered at Churchill. Traps as proposed by du Cordroy 
(66) and by Criddle (69) appear almost equally unpromising 
from the human viewpoint. A great deal more knov/ledge of 
these insects is needed. 

When the irritation of the bites of flies interferes 
with sleep, some treatment is called for. Ammonia, washing 
soda, iodine, and various ointments containing local anas- 
thetics are in common use. Any application for this purpose 
should have antiseptic properties to guard against secondary 
infection., Hoffman (70) recommends the local application of 
chloroform. Very hot water is an excellent counter irritant 
for blackfly bites. 

Next perhaps, to attempting to bathe (which can always 
be postponed), the greatest discomfort from biting flies while.

living in the open, arises during defecation. Palliatives 
which have been found useful include a smudge fire immediately 
to windward, and an aerosol bomb, set to discharge slowly, in 
the same situation. Smudges, of course, are often impossible 
under operational conditions, and an aerosol bomb, though 
effective, is hardly economical. Certainly it is as well to 
disregard the dictates of modesty, and to choose an exposed 
windy situation. 

It is felt that a big contribution to the solution 
of the psychological problem could be made through an 
indoctrination programme on the lines indicated by Shelesnyak 
(51). Superimposed on general arctic knowledge, should be some 
knowledge of and interest in biting flies, imparted through 
the normal media of training films, lectures, and popular 
literature and pamphlets. Such knowledge while presenting a 
true picture, should draw attention to the pleasanter aspects 
of the species concerned - the relative improbability of disease 
transmission, the acquired immunity resulting from bites, the 
small amount of blood taken, and so on. The more interesting 
gaps In our knowledge of these insects snould also be presented, 
it is when the individual has nothing to do that the insect 
menace is greatest; if he has an interest in the biting fly 
problem, he will never have nothing to do when there are flies 
about. The contributions to knowledge from such mass amateur 
observations would probably be small, but the contrioutions to 
morale might be very great. Above all else, the importance o± 
controlling the removal reaction should be stressed; there are 
physiological (47) as well as psychological grounds for this 






154 


recommendation. Philip (42) has stated that interruption in 
feeding results in regurgitation of blood from the mesenteron 
into the oesophageal diverticula, a statement which has since 
been confirmed by the work of Marshall and Staley (36) and of 
Sumsden (34). This suggests the possibility that such inter¬ 
ruption may also result in the regurgitation of the contents 
of the diverticula into the puncture. 

In conclusion it may be stated that the psychological 
threat of the biting fly can be greatly mitigated by the simple 
cultivation of an attitude of patient tolerance; by learning 
to accept these insects as an essential feature (at least for 
the present) of an environment which, after all, offers many 
compensations in other directions. Getting used to these 
pests and * learning to live with them 1 should be an essential 
part of the training of all personnel for the north, since it 
is certain that despite aeroplanes and DDT, and anything else 
that these may immediately foreshadow, under operational 
conditions at least, the biting fly will be an inseparable 
feature of life in the north for many years to come.

6. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
6.1. Summary of Control Conclusions* 

Chemical insecticides offer no immediate economic 
control of mosquitoes or tabanids. In special circumstances 
such as a military emergency, when economic considerations 
may be secondary, the application of DDT from the air at 
0.5 lbs per acre will effect control of mosquito larvae. 

Adult mosquitoes will also be controlled, but infiltration 
into the sprayed area will be rapid. 

Economic chemical control will require the development 
of insecticides of markedly greater toxicity per unit weight, 
or more probably, of more economical methods of distribution. 

The latter may be achieved through the development of aerosol 
generators with output of a new order of magnitude. 

Blackflies may be controlled by the procedure for 
mosquito larvae, or more safely and economically, by the 
application of DDT in any form to streams, to give 1.5 p.p.m/ 
minutes, just before the beginning of pupation. A second dose 
2 to 3 weeks later may be required. "Parathion" and gamma-BHC 
offer possibilities for use against eggs and pupae. 

There are no immediate prospects of control of any 
of the three groups being secured through ecological means. 

The most immediately hopeful approach is through

protection of the individual and his immediate habitats. This 
has two aspects; psychological, through training and cultivation 
of a reasonable attitude to biting flies; physiological, 
through the use of good repellents such as dimethyl phthalate, 
proper protective clothing, and shelters in conjunction with 
local insecticides. 


8.2. Recommendations for Further Work. 


A major result of most research is to demonstrate 
the limitations of existing knowledge: some of the more 
outstanding lacunae in this field are given briefly here. 

The development of insecticides and distribution 
methods are not mentioned; the biting fly problem alone hardly 
justifies the expense entailed in this work, and the results 
obtained are so generally applied that the work will, in any 
event, continue. 

Except where indicated, work on all of these problems 
could proceed simultaneously. 


1. The' factors affecting the hatching of mosquito eggs, 
especially chemicaf factors. 

2. The feeding habits of adult mosquitoes, other than on 
the blood of man, and the relationship of these to 
ovulation and oviposition, and to flight habits and 
migration. 

3. The food materials, feeding habits and behaviour of 
larval blackflies. Mating habits, flight habits, and 
feeding habits other than on human blood, of the adults. 

4. Life histories, and especially larval behaviour and 
feeding habits of the commoner species of tabanids.

5. The nature of the effect of biting flies on large 
bodies of men, living in the open, and the relative 
importance of psychological and physiological effects. 
Also, the effect of such bodies of men on the biting 
flies; is more men going to mean more blood meals, more 
eggs, and hence more flies ? 

6. The sensory physiology of all biting flies, especially 
mosquitoes and blackflies, with particular reference to 
the attraction of these insects to their hosts. 

7. The nature of the toxic materials injected by biting 
flies, especially blackflies, and the possibility of 
combating these. 

8. The mode of action of repellents, and the development 
of better repellent chemicals. (After some progress has 
been made on 5.) 

9. The design, testing, and development of protective 
clothing.

An Insecticide Dispenser for Blackfly breeding Streams: 

The dispenser is required to deliver a 10 per cent 
solution of DDT in fuel oil at controllable rates to give a 
concentration of DDT equal to one part in ten million parts 
of the water of streams with flow rates up to about 250 cusecs. 
The maximum tolerance permissible in this dosage, in view of 
the possible danger to fish and other aquatic organisms is 
considered to be plus* or minus 20 per cent. The most important 
sources of error when treating streams are in the adjustment of 
a dispenser to give the required dosage rate, and in the measur- 
ment of the flow of water in the stream. An accuracy within 10 
per cent can readily be obtained in the latter, even without the 
help of a flow meter, so that a further error of plus or minus 
ten per cent is permissible in the discharge rate of a dispenser. 

The projected dispenser will give at least the required 
accuracy at the low end of its range and increasingly greater 
accuracy at higher flow- rates, so that the net risk will be 
considerably less than that indicated by this figure. At the 
same time any simpler design of dispenser, which could perhaps be 
produced more cheaply, would require correspondingly more skilled 
labour to operate and more time in operation. 

The dispenser is designed for insecticidal fluids of 
viscosity 5.0 centipoises ( the range of viscosity figures 
quoted for fuel oil used in the North is 2.4 to 7.2 centipoises 
at 50°F ), but with the aid of a calibration chart and a range

of orifices it would operate successfully at any combination 
of temperature and intrinsic viscosity likely to be encountered. 
The only dimensions where accuracy is of importance are those 
of the tubing and of the orifices. 

The container consists of a ten gallon drum with a 
lid fitted with a gasket (B) and held in place by a wing nut on 
a bolt welded to the centre of the base of the drum. An air 
vent is required and could be conveniently drilled in the bolt 
(A). The drum is fitted with three legs of g" M.S. rod splayed 
at about 20° and extending about 15*' below the drum. About 3" 
above the ends of these legs, which are pointed, are 2” collars 
(E) which also serve as stops for 3' tubular extensions required 
for use in the deeper streams. The outlet pipe, of -g” bore, is 
placed half way between two legs about an inch above the base, 
and a drain plug is fitted in the base opposite to this (F). 

The outlet leads directly to the flow meter shown on . 
sheet 2, which is inserted at (G) in the drawing on sheet 1. This 
consists of a threaded union to hold the interchangeable orifice 
plates (J), and a differential pressure gauge (G) connected, in 
parallel and leading to a wheel valve (K). For routine use 
three orifices connected in parallel, each vdlth its own stopcock, 
might be desirable ( shorn dotted (H) ), since the range which 
can be obtained with a single orifice is only about 5 times, 
but for an experimental prototype, so long as the orifice plates 
can be readily interchanged by means of a knurled ring or wing 
nut connection, this is not necessary. The differential pressure 
gauge should give a full scale deflection with a pressure

difference equal to about 12" of water. It is understood that 
very suitable gauges are available in the form of war surplus 
air speed indicators for aircraft. The bore of the connecting 
pipes to this instrument would be determined by the fittings 
on the instrument; all other pipes should be of bore, except 
that the final outlet should be arranged to discharge inside a 
short length of wider pipe of sufficient bore to allow at least 
l/16 u clearance all round the outlet (D). Four foot and six foot 
lengths of this wider pipe, each with one end cut off at 45° and 
a one foot length of oil resistant rubber coupling should also 
be provided. 

The theoretical orifice diameters required in plates 
of 2 mm. thickness, determined from Poiseuille’s equation are: 
low range ( for streams 2 - 10 cusecs ), 0.154 cms. medium range 
( 10 - 50 cusecs ), 0.23 eras, high range ( 50 - 250 cusecs ), 
0.344 cms., but for experimental purposes ten plates with 
aperture diameters in the range 0.1 to 0.5 cms. should be 
provided.
