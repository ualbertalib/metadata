ABSTRACT 


The flow characteristics of a white mineral oil, 

Kremol 70, in the presence of water were examined in a 
smooth one-inch pipe. The input oil-water volume ratios 
were varied from 0.1 to 10.0 for 13 superficial water vel¬ 
ocities ranging from 0.116 ft per sec to 3*55 ft per sec. 

A review of the literature indicated that the flow 
of two liquids was most analogous to gas-liquid flow. 

A general analysis of the flow of two immiscible 
liquids between wide parallel plates is made and the equa¬ 
tions derived for pressure drop are modified and put in a 
form similar to those for circular pipes. For a parallel 
plate system of separation 0.1 feet and width 1.0 feet, a 
parallel plate friction factor is calculated and plotted 
against the superficial water velocity for eight input oil- 
water volume ratios from 0.0 to 13.4. 

The pressure drop flow rate data in the present 
experimental study are correlated for the rates and ratios 
studied in terms of a friction factor based on the water 
properties and a superficial water velocity. The general 
shape of this experimental set of curves is in good agree¬ 
ment with the theoretical set. 

Flow patterns of the mixtures were examined 
photographically and qualitatively related to pressure 
drop measurements. The three types of flow are: bubble, 
laminar and mixed. 

The theoretical development indicates that hold-

up for laminar liquid-liquid flow between wide parallel 
plates is a function of only the liquid input ratio and 
the viscosity. The experimental results confirm this 
prediction in the laminar region but indicate that super¬ 
ficial water velocity is also a variable in the turbulent 


region.

INTRODUCTION 


Studies concerned with the development of the 
Athabasca oil sands have from time to time revealed inter¬ 
esting problems in materials handling. Not the least of 
these is that associated with the handling of heavy crude 
oil in the presence of water. 

Clark (4) observed that under some conditions the 
flow of the heavy Athabasca oil through a pipe was aided by 
the inclusion or injection of water into the flowing stream. 

It appeared that the inside of the pipe was wetted by water 
instead of the viscous oil and a lubrication effect was the 
result. Clark and Shapiro (3) of Socony Vacuum Oil Company 
noticed the same effect and patented a process for injection 
of wetting agents with water into crude oil pipelines. The 
wetting agents were added to prevent destruction of the water 
film in the pipe. 

Other reports of water injection into crude oil 
pipelines substantiated the observations but it appears that 
little detailed study has been given to the oil-water system 
operative in these instances. 

The present project was begun with a view to laying 
the foundations for a comprehensive study of oil-water flow. 
The flow of oil-water systems in porous media has been exten¬ 
sively studied (15) but the type of flow encountered is not 
analogous to pipeline transportation of two fluids. This work 
does however, give some qualitative ideas on wettability of 
pipe surfaces, and might provide some ideas for further

extension of pipeline work. 

Pipeline flow of the various systems; solid- 
liquid., liquid-liquid and gas-liquid has received varying 
amounts of attention from different investigators. Plow of 
solid-liquid systems has been quite extensively studied and 
many correlations are available. Most of these correlations 
attempt to handle the problem from a rheological aspect and 
assume a uniform flowing material for all velocities. Since 
the flow pattern in gas-liquid and in liquid-liquid flow is 
constantly changing the solid-liquid type of approach is not 
too useful for liquid-liquid flow. Literature on the flow of 
two immiscible liquids in a pipeline does not exist at the 
present time. However, a great deal of work has been done 
on gas-liquid flow and because this type of flow more closely 
approximates liquid-liquid flow than any other, a general sur¬ 
vey of the literature in the field is discussed below. 

The general study of two phase gas-liquid flow has 
been mainly concerned with the effect of certain variables on 
flow pattern, pressure drop and hold-up. The pertinent var¬ 
iables examined in previous work are: 

(1) Density of each phase 

(2) Viscosity of each phase 

(3) Flow rate of each phase 

(4) Geometry of the system 

Since for design purposes it is often necessary to 
have pressure drop data, a good deal of work has been done to 
obtain a correlation between the variables mentioned and the

experimental pressure drop data. 

An attempt to correlate two-phase flow in a manner 
similar to single phase flow using a type of Fanning equation 
has been made by some investigators. Uren et al (23) and 
Howels (11) both working with gas-liquid systems in vertical 
pipes suggested that the Fanning equation could be used by 
assuming an average mixture density, viscosity and velocity. 

The difficulty in this method of correlation was the evalu¬ 
ation of the properties of the flowing mixture and the lack 
of attention to hold-up and flow pattern considerations. 
Lockhart and Martinelli (13) using an analysis of flow pat¬ 
terns made by Martinelli et al (l4) have correlated pressure 
drop for horizontal flow by using two parameters 0 and X, 

In the analysis, X is the ratio of the pressure drop per unit 
length of liquid flowing alone to the pressure drop per unit 
length of gas flowing alone; 0 is the ratio of the pressure 
drop per unit length during two phase flow to the pressure 
drop per unit length for either phase flowing alone. These 
two parameters were evaluated for each of the following gas- 
liquid flow mechanisms: 

(1) Both phases in turbulent flow 

(2) Both phases in laminar flow 

(3) Gas in laminar flow, liquid in turbulent flow 

(4) Gas in turbulent flow, liquid in laminar flow 

Jenkins (12) and Bergelin (2) tried some correlations 

with Martinelli and Lockhart parameters and found that while 
their data did fit the 0 and X correlations in general, there

was a spread -30 per cent. Baker (l) obtained data for flow 
through pipes four to 10 inches in diameter and found the 
Martinelli type correlation to be inadequate. White and 
Huntington (24) presented an empirical relation which pre¬ 
dicted the pressure drop in a gas-liquid system flowing in 
a horizontal direction from a knowledge of the flow rates* 
physical properties and pipe diameter. This correlation 
was limited to the flow patterns that are stable in nature; 
this excluded slug and stratified flow types. The correlation 
was not checked at high pressures and it did not apply to 
liquids with viscosity less than 120 centipoise. 

Chenowith and Martin (8) attempted to correlate 
Martinelli*s and Lockhart ! s work at higher pressures in the 
turbulent flow region and found that the predicted pressure 
drop was 1.4 to 2.5 times the observed pressure drop. 

Work done at the University of Alberta* by Govier 
and his associates* on vertical gas-liquid flow has led to a 
separation of the hydrostatic head component from the ir¬ 
reversibility component. This was accomplished by Radford 
(17) who applied a mechanical energy balance to the two 
flowing fluids and developed a general equation which per¬ 
mitted the separation of the pressure drop into its two 
components. Radford f s (17) correlation made use of a 
modified Reynolds number based on the gas phase alone and 
a friction factor calculated by considering only the gas 
properties and the irreversibility component. Dunn(9) 
continued this work and proposed a correlation based on the

flowing gas phase using a superficial friction factor and 
Reynolds number. A superficial friction factor based on 
the tube liquid properties was successfully correlated with 
superficial air and water velocities and tube diameter by 
Short (18). Short's correlation enables a calculation of 
total pressure drop for vertical flow of air-water mixtures 
at an average pressure of 38 psi and a range of tube diameters 
from O. 63 O to 2.50 inches. 

The above work on vertical flow has been continued 
by Sullivan (22) in an investigation of the vertical flow of 
two liquids* water and Varsol. 

Some work by Sobocinski and Huntington ( 19 ) on 
three phase flow comes closest to the present study in type 
of system investigated but doesn't suggest any correlation 
for liquid-liquid flow. 

Examination of gas-liquid vertical flow seems to 
indicate that the following types of flow patterns exist. 

(1) A dispersed phase of gas bubbles throughout 

the liquid 

(2) A dispersed phase of liquid droplets through¬ 
out the gas 

(3) Alternate slugs of gas and liquid 

(4) A core of gas flowing through an annular ring 

of liquid 

White and Huntington (24) report the series of flow 
patterns described below for gas-liquid horizontal flow.

Although Moore and Wilde ( 16 ) were among the first 
investigators to recognize the presence of slippage leading 
to hold-up in two phase flow, Govier, Radford and Dunn (10) 
provided the best method for handling and defining hold-up. 
It is defined as the ratio between the input mixture and the 
in situ or test section mixture and may be related to the 
average velocities of the phases as follows: 

% - Vq - % + 1 

V L 

where 

H R = Hold-up ratio, dimensionless 

= Average gas phase velocity, ft per sec 
= Average liquid phase velocity, ft per sec 

It appears that to understand and to interpret 
experimental work on two liquids flowing in a pipe that 
information on pressure drop, flow pattern and hold-up 
must be obtained through the use of a pilot pipeline.

THEORY 


A theoretical analysis of the laminar flow of two 
immiscible liquids would make it possible to predict pressure 
drops and hold-up ratios for any velocity and any input ratio 
if the fluid properties were known. To complete a mathe¬ 
matical analysis the relative position of the two streams 
must be defined and a fixed flow pattern established. The 
simplest system for this type of analysis pertinent to 
liquid-liquid flow is the passage of two immiscible liquids 
through parallel plates of infinite width and finite separ¬ 
ation. 

A complete analysis of liquid-liquid flow in paral¬ 
lel plate systems has not been described in the literature 
although Coulson and Richardson (6) and Corcoran et al (5) 
touched on one small phase of it in a student exercise. 

The following discussion summarizes a complete analysis of 
the flow in this system. The detailed development is shown 
in Appendix D. 

Figure 1 is a sketch of the flow system in which 
parallel plates are orientated in a horizontal position sep¬ 
arated by a distance 2a. The liquid-liquid interface is 
parallel to the plates at a distance y above the lower plate. 

In the analysis the following assumptions are made: 

(1) The upper layer is less dense than the lower 
layer. 

(2) There is no mixing of the liquids at the inter¬ 
face and the flow is in two distinct layers. 

(3) Both liquids are Newtonian and incompressible.

A separate force balance on liquid A and liquid B 
and application of Newton's second law yield the following 
equations since the acceleration is equal to zero. 

(i) Liquid A 

AP (x-y)b - R ALb + R.ALb = 0 .(1) 

(ii) Liquid B 

aP (y-z)b - R z ALb - R^ALb = 0 ...(2) 

Using the relationship between shear force and vel¬ 
ocity gradient, R = /<dU t integration and rearrangement of 

S c dx 

the variables yield: 

(i) Liquid A 

U = -APg e (x 2 - yx) - R ± g c (x) + C 

AL A 2 A 

(ii) Liquid B 

V = APg c (zy - z 2 ) - R i g c (z) + C

The constants are evaluated by substituting in the 
boundary conditions: when z = 0, V = 0; when x s 2a, U = 0.

Rj_ the interface shear force, may be evaluated by 
considering the system behaviour at the interface. At this 
point U is equal to V and an expression for FL can be ob¬ 
tained. 

Integration of the velocities over the area of 
flow enables Q, the flow rate, to be calculated for each 
liquid. The equation takes the general form: 

Q = APba3g c (N^ + N 2 A b ) .... .(5) 

B ——-———■ — —■ 

AL/I; (N 3 A a * N 4 ^) 

The constants Nj, Ng* N 3 and N 4 are functions of 
the in situ oil-water volume ratio. 

Confirmation of the expression for Q—the flow as 
a function of pressure drop, viscosity of the liquids and 
the in situ ratio of the flowing liquids—may be obtained 
by comparing Q with the expressions developed by Coulson 
and Richardson ( 6 ) and by Streeter (20) for related flow 
systems. Inserting the limits to evaluate the constants for 
a one-to-one in situ ratio gives: 

Q a = APba3g c ( 7 /* a +/* b ).(6) 

AL /* A vt ( / u_ k *M b ) 

which is in exact agreement with the Coulson and Richardson 
expression. 


Streeter developed the expression:

for a single liquid flowing between two parallel plates. 
Applied to the present two liquid system Q was evaluated for

each liquid for in situ ratios ranging from 0.1 to 10.0. The 
viscosity of A was then set equal to the viscosity of B and 
the two flow rates added 0 In all cases the calculated Q was 
equal to that derived by Streeter. 

Equation 5 expresses the flow rate in terms of the 
geometry of the system* the pressure drop and viscosity* for 
a parallel plate flow system.. Because the majority of fluid 
flow takes place in circular conduits it is desirable to 
adapt this equation for use with a pipe. 

Since the velocity distribution for two liquids 
flowing in a pipe is complex it is extremely difficult to 
handle this problem in the same manner* but it is felt that 
some similarity should exist in the general relationship 
under laminar flow conditions. To facilitate a comparison 
the derived equations are expressed in terms of a “friction 
factor” and superficial velocity. For the case of a single 
liquid in a given pipe the superficial velocity is directly 
proportional to Reynolds number. 

For convenience the friction factor will be based 
on the properties of a single liquid and is described below: 

The conventional friction factor is defined as 

follows: 


( 8 ) 


f = AP Pg e 


2ALV2p 

For parallel plates of width b and separation 2a* 

V = Q__ where 2ab is the area of flow. 2a may be arbitrarily

used instead of D in Equation (8) yielding 
f =

Accordingly f pp may be defined as: ^P4a^b^ e . , tt (9) 

aL Q 2 <? 


The general equation for Q takes the form: 

Q B = ^Pba3g c ( N^ + N/k ) 

(n 3 ^ a + %“ B ) 

For any two given liquids this becomes AP = QaL

where K = 1 (Nj/^ f N^) .(10)

Where N^, N^, and are functions of the in situ oil-

The values of the flow rate* Q, which will assure 
that flow is in the laminar region can be calculated by 
using a criterion for laminar flow between parallel plates 
described by Walker (25). 

Walker defined Reynolds number for parallel plates 


as follows 

Re = 4aVg........(12) 

For water this becomes 

Re = 9.26(10 ) 4 V4a....(13) 


Since Walker found experimentally that Reynolds 
number must be below 2000 for laminar flow, the upper limit 
on V4a for water flow must be 0.0216.

To enable the construction of a theoretical cor¬ 
relation plot of friction factor versus a superficial velocity 
the geometry of the system must be fixed. Accordingly it 
was decided to consider a parallel plate system of width 
one foot and separation 0.1 feet. The equation for the 
parallel plate friction factor now becomes

eKQ 


(14) 


By considering flow rates of 1(10)^, 5(10)^ and 
10 (10)^ ft^ per sec which are well in the laminar region as 
checked by Equation (23) and by evaluating K for seven in 
situ ratios from 0.0 to 10.0, f pp was calculated using water 
properties and tabulated for the three water rates in Table 


D IV. 


From these calculated data Figure 2 was prepared 

showing a plot of the parallel plate friction factor, f , 

versus V , the superficial water velocity. The curves in 
w 

Figure 2 are lines of constant input oil-water volume ratios 
calculated from the in situ ratios. 

Another important aspect of this theoretical 
development is the information which it gives regarding 
hold-up or the ratio of the input flowing mixture to the 
in situ flowing mixture. To obtain and a series of 
in situ ratios of oil to water were selected and the flow 
rates were calculated. The input ratio was then obtained 
by dividing into 

A sample calculation for this system of oil and 
water is shown in Appendix D. From Table D 111, Figure 3

was constructed showing Hp, the hold-up ratio, which is 
the input oil-water volume ratio divided by the in situ 
oil-water volume ratio, plotted against the input oil- 
water volume ratio. This curve shows that for the laminar, 
two layer flow of Kremol 70. mineral oil and water between 
two parallel plates the hold-up is a function of the vis¬ 
cosity of the two liquids and their input ratios. 

It also Indicates that for an input ratio of zero 
the hold-up ratio approaches zero. 

Consideration of the laminar two layer flow of 
two Immiscible liquids between parallel plates has indicated 
the general form of the friction factor Reynolds number 
relationship for laminar flow and the effect on it of the 
input ratio. While the flow of two Immiscible phases In 
a circular pipe presents a much different problem,' it Is 
reasonable to anticipate a similar general pattern in the 
laminar region.

EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS 


The pilot pipeline was designed to obtain pressure 
drop and hold-up measurements for two immiscible liquids. The 
two liquids chosen were water and Kremol 70, a clear light 
mineral oil with a Saybolt color of 30 + , a specific gravity 
of 0.834 and a viscosity of 22 cp at 20° C. 

A schematic flow diagram of the equipment is shown 
in Figure 4. The main test section was about 35 feet of 
transparent cellulose acetate butyrate pipe of one inch 
diameter supported in a horizontal position by a framework 
made of light steel sections. The pipe was tapped six feet 
from the inlet end and about two feet from the discharge end 
providing a test section of 28.18 feet, A third tapping point 
was provided half way along the test section. 

At the inlet end, the acetate butyrate pipe was 
joined to the input manifold by an eight foot copper pipe 
terminating in a welded 48 degree Y. To prevent trans¬ 
mission of vibration from the pumps to the test section and 
to provide, for flexible positioning of the Y, the copper 
was connected to the input manifold by rubber hose. The 
discharge end of the test section was attached to a separa¬ 
tor by rubber hose. Two roundport quick-closing valves 
connected by a mechanical linkage were installed at both 
ends of the plastic pipe for measuring hold-up. The input 
manifold, pressure measuring system and separator are described 
in detail in the following sections.

Input Manifold- 

Figure 5 shows the input manifold control panel. 

It was equipped with two bimetallic thermometers* four 
rotameters* three pump control switches and three pressure 
gages. Two of the pressure gages indicated discharge 
pressure and the other gave test section pressure. The 
small switch was wired so that the operator could stop 
both pumps simultaneously. This was installed as a safety 
feature to prevent pipe rupture when the quick-closing 
valves were closed for measurements of hold-up. 

The metering of the oil and water was done by 
Fischer Porter rotameters. To give a very wide range of 
flow rates two rotameters were mounted in parallel for each 
liquid and the small rotameters were equipped to operate 
with either a steel or plastic float. The small rotameters 
had a range from 0.152 to 4.52 Imp gal per min for the water 

and 0.0495 to 3.60 Imp gal per min for the oil. The large 

rotameters had a range of 3*54 to 17.3 Imp gal per min for 

water and 1.07 to 11.7 Imp gal per min for oil. The cali¬ 

bration curves for the rotameters are shown in Appendix G. 

Behind the control panel were the pumps and 
reservoirs. The oil and water were pumped bytwo Moyno pumps 
driven with V belts by two 7j hp 3/220/130 standard pro¬ 
tected motors. The pumps* manufactured by Robbins and 
Meyer* were the 2L4 - CDQ models with a displacement of 2.02 
U.S. gal per 100 rpm and a working pressure of 300 psi. 

Both pumps were equipped with safety relief valves because

of their positive displacement characteristic. Considerable 
care was taken with the suction and discharge piping to pre¬ 
vent inclusion of air. 

A cooling coil was found to be necessary in the oil 
reservoir because of heat generated when the oil was recycled. 
The temperature in the water reservoir was controlled manual¬ 
ly by the addition of hot or cold water. 

Pressure Measuring System 

The pressure measuring system consisted of pressure 
stations on the flow line* transmission lines* and manometers. 
The flow equipment in the present investigation was designed 
to permit the study of oil in the presence of water and be¬ 
cause the test section was handling both liquids* special 
pressure measuring stations were designed. To assure that 
the manometer transmission lines were filled with a material 
of uniform density* air was employed as the transmitting 
fluid. The measuring station as shown in Figure 6 consisted 
of a block of lucite through which the flow line passed. A 
hole 1/8 inch in diameter was drilled into the top of the 
block and through the pipe wall. The hole in the block was 
enlarged and tapped to take a i inch pipe nipple which sup¬ 
ported the splash pot with its gage* valve and tubing con¬ 
nections. A measuring scale was mounted on each splash pot. 
The elevations of the scales were adjusted to the same absol¬ 
ute elevation. 

Figure 7 shows the polyethylene tubing connections 
from the measuring stations to the manometers. The dotted

lines indicate temporary connections which were installed 
only as needed* Pressure differentials were measured with 
three Meriam manometers: one 12 foot mercury manometer., one 
12 foot water manometer and one 30 inch inclined water man¬ 
ometer . 

The pressure measuring system was checked by making 
a series of runs with water alone and clear oil alone. The 
results of this calibration are shown in Appendix C. 

Oil-Water Separator 

The separator for recovering the oil from the flow 
line discharge was originally designed to operate continuously 
but such severe emulsion problems were encountered that it 
could only do so at low flow rates. The gravity cell equipped 
with sight glasses was constructed of sheet metal and is 
shown in Figure 8. The mixture flowing from the test pipe 
was introduced at the centre and allowed to separate by 
gravity. If the separation was incomplete the process was 
conducted batch-wise and a steam coil used to break the 
water-in-oil emulsion. Water was allowed to flow from the 
bottom of the separator by gravity and was either recycled 
back to the water reservoir or discharged into the sewer. 

The oil was decanted into the secondary drum where additional 
suspended water tended to settle out. It was then pumped 
through the salt tower to take out final traces of water. 

The salt tower was constructed of sheet metal. As shown 
in Figure 8 it was equipped inside with a supporting screen 
placed 1.5 feet from the bottom of the tower. A pressure

gage at the discharge end gave an indication of any blocking 
of the flow by salt. The return line from the salt tower 
to the oil reservoir was equipped with a salt trap and two 
screens to prevent salt from remaining in the test oil. 

The tower was packed from the bottom up with one foot of 
rock salt then one foot of fine salt and finally two feet 
of rock salt. Trapped water was drawn off at the drain. 

The through-put capacity of the tower was about 100 gallons 
of oil with 100 ppm water. The exhausted salt was not 
dissolved but appeared to be completely coated with the oil. 



EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 


Pressure Differential Measurements 

Differential pressure measurements were made with 
varying input ratios of oil to water from 0.1 to 10 for 13 
different superficial water rates ranging from 0.116 ft per 
sec to 3*55 ft per sec. The measurements were made as 
follows: 

(a) All manometers were vented and balanced and the valves 
between the splash pots and the pipe test section were closed. 
The air reduction valves were closed. 

(b) All valves on the test section between the input manifold 
and the separator were opened. The discharge bypass valves 

on the pumps were opened, and the water and oil pumps started. 
The valves controlling the flow to the rotameters were then 
set to give the desired flow readings. 

(c) After a sufficient time was allowed for the oil and 
water flow to reach a steady state—-this was determined both 
visually and by pressure drop measurements to be less than 
about one minute for the rates under study—the valves on 
the measuring stations which spanned the test section under 
consideration were slowly opened. Care was taken to allow 
only oil to enter the splash pots. Fluid levels in both 
measuring stations were adjusted to the same elevation by 
regulating the air pressure in the splash pot. Valves 
connecting the pressure stations to the suitable manometer 
were then opened, the splash pot levels readjusted and the 
pressure differential recorded.

(d) After the reading was recorded all valves on the pressure 
measuring system were closed and the manometer rebalanced by 
venting. The oil flow rate was then changed and the sequence 
of operation repeated to obtain the new pressure reading for 
the new flow conditions. 

Hold-Up Measurements 

For measuring hold-up in the test section the 
rotameters were set at the required rates and the pipeline 
was allowed to reach a steady state. The quick-closing valves 
were then closed and the pumps shut off with the single switch. 
The contents of the line were collected from the pipe by inject¬ 
ing compressed air and elevating the pipe. It was found that 
almost 95^ of the material could be recovered from the line. 

The contents of the pipe were collected in a four litre measuring 
cylinder. The oil and water separated on standing and the 
volume of each was observed and the hold-up calculated. 

Examination of Flow Pattern 

A transparent material was chosen for the pipe test 
section so that visual observations could be made of the flowing 
material. At low flow rates a quiet interface existed between 
the oil and water streams. At high flow rates the interface 
tended to break up. A photographic record of typical flow 
patterns was made using a 4 x 5 inch Linhoff press camera with 
a 90 mm lens and a high speed electronic flash which effect¬ 
ively "stopped" the flow in the pipe at all the flow rates used 
in the investigation. The single flash unit was mounted below

the pipe at right angles to the camera and a flash duration 
of 1/2000 sec was used, 

A special shield to exclude outside lighting was 
constructed. This shield provided a light source from just 
above the test section and a black background for the pipe 
itself. 

Operation of the Separator 

The tendency of the clear oil to form stable emul¬ 
sions with water was not great at low water flow rates i. e. 
0.116 to O.718 ft per sec. Under these conditions the separ¬ 
ator could be operated continuously. The interface level in 
the separator was maintained in the range of one to two feet 
below the oil overflow point by adjusting the water discharge. 
In this manner the oil residence time in the separator was as 
great as possible. It was customary to check the separation 
by sampling and determining the water concentration of the oil 
accumulation in the secondary separator before pumping it back 
to the intake reservoir. 

At high flow rates i. e. 1.08 to 3*55 ft per sec 
of water, the separator was operated batch-wise to cope with 
the emulsification problem. The discharge from the test sec¬ 
tion was collected in the empty separator during a series of 
experiments which were continued until the separator was full. 
The flow line was shut down and the emulsion in the separator 
was broken down by heating to about l40° F. That temperature 
was maintained for several hours with the steam coil heater. 
When the water content of the oil fell to about 100 ppm the 



- 23 - 


oil was pumped through the salt tower back to the intake 
reservoir. If the water content fell readily to less than 
20 ppm in the separator the salt tower was not used. Al¬ 
though it was possible to tell the approximate water content 
by the cloudy or clear appearance of the oil, a Karl Fischer 
titration was generally used to check the water content of 
the final oil.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 


Pressure drop data were obtained for 13 different 
water rates at input oil-water volume ratios varying from 
0.1 to 10.0. Photographs were taken for the majority of 
water rates and ratios studied. Hold-up data at varying 
input ratios from 0.1 to 5 were obtained for all laminar 
water rates and for three different water rates in the 
.turbulent region. 

Pressure Drop 

The pressure drop data are presented as. unit 

pressure drop in feet of water per foot, vAP , plotted against 

AL 

the input oil-water volume ratio, for each superficial water 
velocity in Figures 9 to 21. The superficial water velocity 
was calculated by dividing the water volumetric flow rate 
by the inside cross sectional area of the pipe. Figures 
9 to 14 at the lower water rates show only readings measured 
over the complete test section. Measurements over both the 
complete section and the second half of the section are 
shown in Figures 15 to 21. The purpose of plotting both 
was to detect by pressure drop measurements any changes 
in the flowing material as it was pumped along the test 
line. If the shear forces at the wall of the pipe had changed 
the character of the flowing material to any marked extent 
the measurement of both pressure differentials would have 
detected the change. The unit pressure drop values for 
both the half and complete test section are in good agree-

ment except in Figures 19, 20 and 21. At these relatively 
high water rates the curves show a discontinuity at an 
input ratio of about 1.0. Figure 20 in particular shows 
that while complete test section results began to show a 
scatter from the smooth curve the half test section mea¬ 
surements appeared to continue along the curve. The dis¬ 
continuity appeared to fade out at the higher ratio of 1 . 6 . 
These curves are quite similar to the type of curve Sullivan 
( 22 ) obtained by plotting the pressure drop due to friction 
alone in his work on the vertical flow of water and varsol. 
The unit pressure drop values are also of the same order of 
magnitude even though Sullivan employed a slightly larger 
diameter test section. Short's (18) work on air and water 
also indicated the same type of curve when the hydrostatic 
head component was separated from the unit pressure drop. 

A discontinuity also appears in Figure 19 but 
since results are not available at the higher ratios it is 
not yet possible to report a disappearance of this scatter. 
At the higher superfic ial water rate of 3*55 ft per sec. 
Figure 21, considerable scattering was present due largely 
to the fact that at the higher ratios the flowing mixture 
was becoming more and more emulsified as shown in Figure 36 . 

There is a definite discontinuity in the unit 
pressure drop curves for the lower water rates. This occurs 
at very low input ratios and is most distinct in Figures 9 
to 14. Similar observations have been made by Short (18) 
using air and water in a vertical pipe. 

The pressure drop data were correlated in terms of

a modified Fanning type friction factor, f w , based on the 
properties of the water and the superficial water velocity. 

The modified friction factor is defined as 

f w - ^ oc ^ 

AL(2)V W 1 C , 

Curves of f w versus input oil-water volume ratios at constant 
water velocity are shown in Figures 22 to 34, the calculations 
for which are in Appendix B. By interpolation from these 
curves, values of the friction factor were obtained for 
input oil-water volume ratios of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 

5.0 and 10.0. These values are plotted on logarithmic 
graph paper against the superficial water velocity in Figure 
35. In addition the f w values for the water alone were 
plotted. Because the pipe was of a constant diameter and 
the properties of the water remained unchanged, the super¬ 
ficial water velocity V w is directly proportional to a 
superficial Reynolds number for this series of experiments. 

Because the superficial water velocity is pro¬ 
portional to a superficial Reynolds number, a picture of 
the liquid-liquid flow relative to the single phase cor¬ 
relation is obtained. The curves in Figure 35 form straight 
lines of slope equal to minus one in the laminar region, 
show the discontinuity present in the single phase line 
and then slope towards the single phase curve as the super¬ 
ficial water velocity increases.

indicates the excellent agreement in general form with the 
curves developed for the parallel plate flow system. The 
laminar region family of constant input oil-water volume 
ratio curves have the same slope, and roughly the same 
spacing as the theoretical curves shown in Figure 2. 

Flow Patterns 

The flow patterns were investigated by taking a 
complete series of photographs for most of the ratios and 
water rates studied. For the sake of brevity only five sets 
of phonographs are included here but this series is on file. 

In general three types of flow patterns were observed. At 
low input oil-water volume ratios a bubble flow was observed. 

As the input ratio and water rates were increased, bubble 
flow gradually settled into a laminar two layer flow with a 
quiet interface. At the higher rates of flow 1.44 ft per 
sec to 3*55 ft per see and at higher input ratios the lam¬ 
inar flow changed gradually with increasing agitation at 
the interface to a completely mixed type of flow. Figure 36 
shows the three flow patterns encountered. The qualitative 
effect of increasing the input oil-water volume ratio is 
shown photographically in Figures 37 * 38, and 39 for three 
different water rates. A series for increasing superficial 
water velocities for a constant input ratio is presented in 
Figure 40. In gas-liquid work, Govier, Radford and Dunn(lO) 
have described flow patterns in conjunction with pressure drop 
measurements and separated the pressure drop curves into four 
regimes using maxima and minima points as a basis for division.

Applying this gas-liquid analogy to the data obtained for the 
liquid- liquid system it appears from photographic evidence 
and examination of Figures 9 to 14 which contain the first 
maxima that bubble flow is occuring. This corresponds to 
a part of pressure drop Regime I as described by Short (18) 
the only difference being that the oil is not surrounded 
by the water but is flowing at the top of the pipe. 

The second discontinuity in Figures 19 and 20 
appears to be caused by a change from laminar two-layer 
flow to the completely mixed type of flow. This can be 
seen from Figure 38 which shows increasing ratios for the 
superficial water velocity plotted in Figure 20. This type 
of flow corresponds roughly to that of Regime II described 
by Short (18) with the exception again that the oil flows 
on top of the water. 

Hold-Up 

Hold-up data are plotted as H R , the hold-up ratio 
or the ratio of the input oil-water ratio to the in situ 
oil-water ratio, versus the input oil-water volume ratio. 

The hold-up data taken in the laminar region for five 
different water rates (Figure 4l) show some scattering but 
indicate that the hold-up ratio is not a function of velocity 
but is dependent on the input ratio and viscosity of the 

two liquids. This is consistent with the theoretical pre¬ 
diction for parallel plates shown in Figure 3. 

Data obtained in the turbulent region of flow show 
in Figure 42 that in this case the superficial water velocity

is an important factor. The theoretical curve (Figure 3) 
is also plotted on this set of axis. The general trend toward 
zero at an input oil-water volume ratio of zero is shown in 
Figures 4l and 42. 

Govier* Radford and Dunn (10) suggest that for the 
vertical flow of gas-liquid systems a hold-up of 1.0 is 
approached at an input ratio of gas to liquid of zero, or in 
other words when the flowing material is all liquid. They re¬ 
late hold-up to average liquid and gas velocities by the 
equation 

% = V G ~ V L + 1 

V L 

where V G and V L are the average gas and liquid velocities. 
Applying the extreme limits in this equation can lead to 
two different conclusions: 

(i) When the pipe is completely occupied by the 
liquid* one might expect the slip velocity* 

V Q - V L * to be zero and the hold-up ratio 
H r to be unity 

(ii) When the pipe is full of liquid* Vq = 0 and 
the hold-up ratio = 0 

The data of Govier* Radford and Dunn appear to sup¬ 
port unity as the limiting value. On the other hand* the 
theory developed in the present investigation for parallel 
plates indicates that the hold-up ratio should approach 
zero. The experimental results in Figures 4l and 42 strongly 
support this prediction. It is suggested that the second 
interpretation (ii) is the correct one.

(1) Pressure drop data have been correlated by 
plotting a Panning type friction factor based on water pro- 

1 vu ter velocity . The relation¬ 
ship applies only to water and Kremol 70 mineral oil flowing 
in a one inch horizontal pipe at 77^0.5° F. The correlation 
shows excellent agreement in general form with a mathemati¬ 
cal analysis made of the flow of two immiscible liquids 
between wide parallel plates. 

(2) For the liquid ratios and water rates 
studied, three flow patterns were observed; 

(a) Bubble flow 
{b) Lami na r f 1 o w 
(c) Mixed flow 

(3) Experimental hold-up measurements are in 
complete accord with the theory developed for parallel 
plates. In the laminar region of flow, hold-up is a func¬ 
tion of liquid input ratio and the viscosity. In the tur¬ 
bulent region hold-up Is also a function of superficial 
water velocity. 

In the limiting case when the Input liquid ratio 
is zero, the hold-up appears to approach zero. 




APPENDICES 





APPENDIX A 


(EXPERIMENTAL DATA) 



APPENDIX A 

Table A1 shows the pressure drop for pure oil 
and pure water flowing in the test section* Hold-up mea¬ 
surements and pressure drop data for varying input oil- 
water volume ratios are tabulated in Table All for thirteen 
different superficial water velocities* Pressure drop data 
marked with an asterisk were obtained by measuring the dif¬ 
ferential over 14.2 feet of the test section. Hold-up 
measurements were difficult to make so these data were 
obtained for only a few selected water velocities.

APPENDIX B 

Reynolds number and the conventional friction 
factor have been calculated for experimental runs on 
the pure liquids and are tabulated in Table Bl. Fric¬ 
tion factors calculated by using water properties and 
superficial water velocities are tabulated for the 
thirteen water rates in Table Bll. Results marked with 
an asterisk indicate measurements made over one half 
the test section.

(CALIBRATIONS) 



APPENDIX C 

The Fisher Porter rotameters were calibrated 
by time weight measurements and the results are shown 
in Figures 43 and 44. The three curves on each graph 
represent: 

(1) The calibration of the large rotameter 
with a steel float 

(2) The calibration of the small rotameter 
with a steel float 

(3) The calibration of the small rotameter 
with a plastic float 

The pipe test section was calibrated by making 
pressure drop measurements for the oil and water flowing 
alone. This data is plotted in Figures 45 and 46 on the 
conventional friction factor versus Reynolds number co¬ 


ordinates.

(THEORETICAL ANALYSIS) 





APPENDIX D 


The complete development relating pressure drops of 
two immiscible liquids to the flow rate, viscosities and geo¬ 
metry of the system is presented in Part 1 for laminar liquid 
liquid flow between wide parallel plates. The equations have 
been integrated for in situ oil-water volume ratios from 0.1 
to 10.0 and the results are presented in Table D 1 and D 11. 

A sample calculation evaluating and Qg for an 
in situ liquid A-liquid B volume ratio of 2.0 is shown in 
Part 11. A calculation of the input liquid A-liquid B 
volume ratio for this insitu ratio is also shown. 

For water and Kremol 70 a sample calculation of 
input oil-water volume ratios, Ry, is shown in Part 111 for 
an in situ oil-water volume ratio of 2.0. The input oil- 
water volume ratio was calculated for seven in situ oil- 
water volume ratios from 0.1 to 10.0 and the results are 
tabulated in Table D 111. 

Part IV shows the calculation of the parallel 
plate friction factor defined in the theory by Equation 10. 
Values for K were calculated for three different water rates 
and seven in situ oil-water volume ratios and are tabulated 


in Table D IV.

(ii) on layer between planes z and y

The force balance assumes that the bottom layer is 
flowing faster. 

EVALUATION OF LIQUID VELOCITIES

Substitute in equation D(l) 
aP(x - y)b +/^dU Lb + R^Lb _ q

Separate variables and integrate 
U s -APg c (x 2 - yx) - Rjg c (x) + C 

Evaluate the constant C 

when x = 2a, U = 0 

C = aPSc (2a 2 - 2ay) - Rjg c (2a)

Therefore: U = aPg c (2a 2 - 2ay - x 2 + yx) + R i g c (2a - x)

Substitute in equation D(2) 

AP(y - z)b ~/4 B d.V&Lb - R^aL'D = 0

Separate variables and integrate 
V = APg c (yz - z 2 ) - Rjg c (z) + C 

./V L 2 A 

Evaluate the constant C 
when x = 0, V = 0 
C = 0 

Therefore: V = ^Pg c (yz - z 2 ) - Rj_g c (z) .D(4)

From the theory. Equation 10: f-- = - . Since 

pp eK Q 

for water p is known Q must be chosen and K calculated from 
the in situ oil-water volume ratios. 



Table D IV shows the 

value of the
