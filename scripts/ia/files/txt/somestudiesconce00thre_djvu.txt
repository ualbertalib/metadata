ABSTRACT 


A study of chromosome IX in Thatcher wheat showed the 
telocentric and isochromosome for the long arm of this chromosome 
to be more stable then previously reported for Chinese Spring. The 
study showed that not only was the long arm responsible for decrease 
in plant growth, but that the short arm was responsible for increase 
in growth, as indicated by height differences. 

The growth differences between plants of the speltoid- 
compactoid series were shown to result from differences in both cell 
length and cell numbers. These differences could not be correlated 
to differences in the enzymatic destruction of indoleacetic acid, 
but may be affected by differences in the adenine; indoleacetic 
acid ratio of the plants. 

The plants were grown in solutions of potassium gibberellate 
and of kinetin. It was found that the effect of the gibberellin was 
to differentially increase growth rates of mutants and normals, with 
the result that both attained similar increases in height when in the 
seedling stage® The effect of kinetin was to differentially depress 
growth in the various plant types but again to result in nearly equal 
increases in height for mutants and normals. The plants grown in 
gibberellin more nearly attained equal total growth during a given 
period of time, then those grown in kinetin, for with the latter, the 
shorter plants were slower in germinating.

INTRODUCTION 


lb is known that an increase in dosage of chromosome DC 
of Triticum vu'lgare results in a decrease in plant height. In the 
complete absence of chromosome DC, plants are taller than normal,(22) 
while the presence of four chromosome DC*s results in a dwarf type of 
plant. Thus differences in mature plant height follow from chromosome 
DC being present in different dosages or combinations, either as a 
complete chromosome or as a telocentric or as an isochromosome for the 
long arm. 


The work of Van Overbeek (30) has given rise to the generally 
accepted concept that dwarf mutants in plants are deficient in some 
aspect of growth hormone physiology (29). An attempt has been made in 
the present work to correlate such a deficiency with the dwarfing effect 
of chromosome DC. 

As a preliminary to the study an investigation was made of 
the various height relationships that may be attributed to dosages of 
chromosome DC. Included in this preliminary work was an evaluation 
of the stability and gametic transmission of the telocentric and 
isochromosomes in Thatcher wheat.

LITERATURE REVIEW 


Genetics and Cytogenetics 

Chromosome IX of hexaploid wheat has a submedian centromere 
giving it a long arm and a short arm. Three genes or gene complexes 
have been located on the long arm. At the distal end is the Q factory 
near the centromere is a gene for supression of winter habit, denoted 
by between these two is a gene controlling awning (lU)* The 
literature appears to be without reference to any phenotypic effect 
that can be related to the short arm. 

It is the Q factor that is of primary concern in this 
thesis* The Q factor is a pleiotropic gene complex, and of its many 
effects the following are of interest in the problem under study; 
its effect on height, on head type, and on cell elongation* Dosage 
of the long arm of chromosome IX and so of the Q factor is directly 
related to height. Mature height decreases from that of the nulli- 
somic, containing no Q factor, to that of the tetrasomic containing 
four Q factors. Head type is also related to the chromosome dosage, 
varying from speltoid in the nullisomic and monosomic, normal in the 
disomic, subcompactoid in the trisomic and compactoid in the tetra¬ 
somic (III). According to Li et al. (13) the epidermal and stomata 
cells of the speltoid types are more elongated than those of the normal. 

Misdivision of a centromere of a normal univalent or an 
isochromosome, may result in the production of a telocentric or 
isochromosome (20, 21). If misdivision of the centromere of

chromosome IX leads to the formation of telocentrics and isochromosomes 
of the long arm, then the various types of the speltoid-compactoid 
series may arise from combinations of telocentrics and is©chromosomes 
(HO. A plant not possessing the long arms of chromosome IX, or one 
which is deficient for nearly all of the long arms, but possessing 
a pair of short arms, is similar to nullisomic IX, being of winter 
habit, tall and awned (19)® 

Sears (21) has studied the frequency of misdivision of 
telocentrics and isochromosomes in common wheat and has demonstrated 
the degree of their stability. By pollinating isomonosoraics and 
telomonosomics with pollen from normal plants, he showed that in a 
total of 358 female gametes frommono-iso-IX there was a yield of ±h% + 
h*9% telocentrics, and in a total of 769 female gametes from mono-telo- 
IX plants the yield of isochromosomes was 13% + 3»1%* It is to be 
realised, of course, that telocentrics may fail to divide, and iso¬ 
chromosomes may misdivide to form telocentrics and isochromosomes 
respectively so that it would be impossible to detect these mis- 
divisions genetically. 

While the percentages of the different female gametes 
that are active in fertilization is a direct estimate of the 
percentage of the different functional female gametes actually 
produced, the same is not true of male gametes. On the male side the 
amount of transmission of a telocentric or an isochromosome is deter¬ 
mined by the competitive effect of the pollen carrying the telocentric 
or isochromosome in comparison with nullisomic pollen. From plants

-k- 


that were monosomic for the long arm of chromosome IX, Sears reported 
that 26,k% of the functioning male gametes were nullisomic, 30% had a 
derived telocentric, and k3»6% had the isochromosome. Thus although 
about lk% of the gametes actually produced would possess a telocentric, 
30$ of the functional gametes were of this type. In mono-IX about 
2% of the male gametes are deficient for chromosome IX, and in mono- 
telo-IX about 3% of the male gametes were nullisomic. Intensive 
selection, then, occurs against male gametes deficient for the long 
arm of chromosome IX, pollen with the telocentric for the long arm of 
IX having about the same advantage as normal pollen, but pollen with 
the isochromosome for the long arm having less advantage (21). 
Transmission of the female gametes in plants monosomic for chromosome 
IX reflects the gametes actually produced and is about 1$% for the 
(n - 1) gamete, regardless of what form the monosome may take (22). 

Chemistry and Physiology 

It has been proposed that the dwarfing effect caused by the 
long arm of chromosome IX and specifically the Q factor, is due to 
a mechanism inhibiting auxin action (13)• Similar mechanisms have 
been demonstrated to be present in other higher plants. Nana corn, 
a dwarf type of Zea mays has been shown, in the classic studies of 
Van Overbeck (30, 31), to possess tissues which are more active in 
destroying indoleacetic acid than those of the normal. He also found 
that five other dwarf mutants in maize possessed less auxin than the 
normal (31). As reported by Teas (29), Nakayama has found that the 





- 5 - 


coleoptile tips of dwarf plants of rice contain less auxin than the 
normals* Phinney (16, 29) was able to increase the rate of growth of 
dwarf plants to that of normals by treating them with gibberellic acid. 
Brian and Hemming (29) showed the existence of differential stimu¬ 
lation of growth in dwarf and normal peas by indoleacetic acid* They 
also reported a striking stimulation of growth in dwarf peas by the 
addition of gibberellic acid. Thus to date (195?) literature con¬ 
cerning the chemical basis of dwarf mutants is confined to studies of 
indoleacetic acid, auxin metabolism, and the action of gibberellic 
acid. 


One of the first references to plant auxins was that of 
Charles Darwin who concluded that "when seedlings are freely exposed 
to a lateral light, some influence is transmitted from the upper to 
the lower part causing the latter to bend" (1+). Later workers have 
shown that what Darwin was observing was the now known phenomenon 
that auxin is synthesized in the growing tips of higher plants and 
is then translocated down the stem where it becomes active in elongat¬ 
ing the cells. This auxin has its activity greatly reduced by the 
effect of light. Thus where more light falls on one side of the stem 
than on the other, auxin present in the illuminated side will be 
reduced in activity compared with that on the darkened side, and thus 
the stem will bend towards the light (12). 

It was in 193U that indoleacetic acid was first isolated 
from plant material and identified as an auxin or plant growth hormone 
(12). Since that time indoleacetic acid has come to be generally 





- 6 - 


accepted as the commonest growth hormone in higher plants. Ga'lston 
suggests that in many instances, all the auxin in a plant is either 
indoleacetic acid or closely related compounds (5). Other compounds 
are thought to be active as auxin through being converted to indole¬ 
acetic acid (7)« The concept has been formed that auxin may be present 
in plants in various forms, and these forms may be considered to be 
either free or bound auxin. It is thought likely that free and bound 
auxin are in a dynamic equilibrium with each other (12). Short time 
extractions and isolation by diffusion yield free auxin, while long 
time extractions yield bound auxin as well. 

It is believed that tryptophan is quite likely the primary 
precursor of indoleacetic acid, (7), and of the number of inter¬ 
mediate products that have been suggested it appears that indole- 
acetaldehyde is probably involved, and that indolepyruvate may be 
involved. However relatively little is yet known about the pathways 
operative in the biosynthesis of indoleacetic acid, and little more 
is known about the inactivation of auxin in higher plants. 

It is known that plant auxins and in particular indoleacetic 
acid can be destroyed by photoxidation. These compounds do not possess 
absorption bands in the visible spectrum, photolysis being induced by 
intermedian pigments that absorb light and convey the energy so absorbed 
to the auxin molecule. A number of compounds are known to have the 
ability of mediating in the photoinactivation in vitro of both pure 
auxins and auxins in plant extracts ; such compounds are riboflavin, 
methylene blue, and eosin (6).

It has been found that the enzymatic inactivation of indole- 
acetic acid results in the uptake of one mole of molecular oxygen for 
every mole of indoleacetic acid inactivated. The stoichiometric 
relationship concerning the uptake of oxygen has resulted in enzyme 
systems capable of inactivating indoleacetic acid being named 
indoleacetic acid oxidases (18). Tang and Bonner (28), working with 
peas, were the first to isolate such an enzyme system. Later Waygood 
(3lt) found a similar system to be present in wheat leaves. 

A number of hypotheses have been suggested for the manner 
in which indoleacetic acid may be oxidized enzymatically. There is 
evidence that indoleacetic acid oxidases possess peroxidase character¬ 
istics in that they catalyse the oxidation of phenols using hydrogen 
peroxide as an electron acceptor. Hydrogen peroxide has been shown 
to be required in the inactivation of indoleacetic acid. It is 
believed that two separate enzymes, forming a coupled system, are 
involved in oxidation of indoleacetic acid, and one of the enzymes 
appears to possess the characteristics of a flavin enzyme. Thus It 
is thought that indoleacetic acid may be oxidized by hydrogen peroxide, 
the reaction being catalyzed by a peroxidase, and hydrogen peroxide 
regenerated by a flavin enzyme as follows (18); 

1AA + H 2 O 2 peroxidase y + H^O 

+ 0 2 flavoprotein Po + HgOg 

Waygood ( 3 !*) has proposed a somewhat different reaction. 

His hypothesis is based on the knowledge that trivalent manganese ions 
have been shown to stimulate the oxidation of indoleacetic acid, and 





- 8 - 


their chelation has been shown to have the reverse effect. Following 
the lead of Kenten and Mann (10), who showed that hydrogen peroxide 
can be disposed of by oxidizing manganese to the trivalent stage via 
an appropriate phenol-peroxidase system, Waygood suggests that the 
highly positive trivalent manganese ion, initially produced as sug¬ 
gested by Kenten and Mann, polarizes the carboxyl group of the in- 
doleacetic acid. An electron and hydrogen ion are withdrawn and 
CO^ is released. The free radical remaining is thought to react 
with oxygen to produce a peroxide. It is suggested that the 
peroxide then reacts with a phenolic compound in a peroxidase- 
catalysed reaction, resulting in the production of an aryl radical 
that would reoxidize the manganese. The reactions are summarized 
as follows (18):

Galston (5) has drawn attention to the ability of older 
cells to cause a greater inactivation of indoleacetic acid than 
younger cells. Apparently the peroxide-generating capacity of the 
tissue closely parallels its indoleacetic acid-oxidase activity, 
rising as the cells age. Peroxidase activity shows no such increase. 





















- 9 - 


Galston has shown that the addition of 2*l|.-dichlorophenol increases 
the effective peroxide level* and that the addition of 2,lj-dichloro- 
phenol to homogenates of younger tissues gives a greater increase in 
indoleacetic acid-oxidase activity* than do such additions to homo¬ 
genates of older tissues. 

Indoleacetic acid is known to be active in causing cell 
elongation* but just how this is accomplished is rather vague. 

Bennet -Clark (1) draws attention to three main hypotheses that suggest 
possible mechanisms involved in stem elongation by indoleacetic acid. 
They are (i) that the cell wall is rendered more plastic; (ii) that 
water and possibly solute uptake is promoted; (iii) that polysaccharide 
synthesis is stimulated so that the wall "grows”. However it is 
pointed out that none of these hypotheses attempts an explanation 
involving molecular mechanisms* and until such mechanisms can be 
demonstrated the manner in which indoleacetic acid causes cells to 
elongate will remain rather vague. 

Skoog (23) suggests that the effect of indoleacetic acid 
on growth may be due not to its concentration per se but to its 
concentration in relation to other compounds* notably in relation 
to adenine. He found that in tobacco stem where the ratio of adenine: 
auxin added was high with regard to adenine, bud formation was favored; 
whereas when indoleacetic acid was the higher concentration* root 
formation occurred. Skoog found other purines to have an effect on 
growth* guanine being nearly as effective as adenine. He believes 
both adenine and auxin to be part of a single system controlling 






- 10 


growth and organ differentiation, making it clear that their relation¬ 
ship is not that one is the precursor of the other* 

Skoog visualizes the control of growth in plants as being 
dependent on delicate concentration balances between substances that 
are highly active physiologically. He believes that "factors which 
control growth and differentiation in the orderly laying down of new 
tissues and primordia in the meristeras are essentially the factors 
which regulate their subsequent growth and development into a mature 
plant". 

Skoog (23) has suggested that relative growth of tissues 
and induction of organ formation in callus, stem, or root segments 
may be controlled by a balance of nutrients supplied in the medium, 
particularly auxin and certain amino acids* Buzzati-Traverso (2) 
has shown the close relationships that appears to exist between the 
genotype and free amino acid content in certain Drosophila and some 
higher plants. Organisms differing from the normal by a mutation 
at a single locus were shown to possess different free amino acid 
patterns. 


A growth substance that appears to be quite unrelated 
to indoleacetic acid is gibberellic acid. The gibberellins were 
first isolated in fungi, and it seems highly likely that they are 
present in higher plants. A material obtained from ether extracts 
of recently fertilized bean seeds has been interpreted as being 
similar to gibberellin. The characteristic effect of gibberellin is

stem elongation. It appears that while the major effect on stem 
elongation is through increase in cell length, gibberellins are also 
active in promoting cell division (27). 

Some substances are known to effect stem elongation primarily 
by cell division* Miller et al. (1$) isolated a substance, from an 
old sample of deoxyribonucleic acid, which they found to possess the 
characteristic physiological effect of causing cell division. 

Because this substance specifically promotes cytokinesis it was given 
the name kinetin. Later it was identified as 6-furfuryl amino purine* 

Miller et al. propose the term "kinin” to describe substances 
specifically active in cell division. It is not known whether kinetin 
exists as such in nature or whether some other substance is responsible 
for cell division. 

Besides the growth substances mentioned above, many others 
are known, such as the phenoxyacetic acids, diphenyl urea, and 2- 
benzthiazolyloxyacetic acid (26), all of which were outside the scope 
of this study.

PART I. MATURE PLANTS: SEGREGATION, HEIGHT, AND 

CYTOLOGY . 

MATERIALS AMD METHODS 
(a.) Plant Material 

It was originally intended that only Thatcher wheat and its 
mutants should be used throughout this study. However, the variety 
Chinese Spring and the aneuploid Chinese Spring tetrasomic IX were 
also used for two reasons: (i) The dwarf type Thatcher under study 
has the chromosome constitution of twenty pairs plus two isochromosomes 
for the long arm of chromosome IX, and although possessing four Q 
factors it by no means breeds true. Such plants when selfed are not 
very fertile and give rise to only a small proportion of dwarf plants 
of the parental type. The dwarf Chinese Spring tetrasomic IX, however, 
gives rise to 80^ or more tetrasomic progeny (22). (ii) It was thought 
that experiments using similar mutants of two varieties would yield more 
information than those conducted with only one variety. 

Thus the plant material used was the wheat species Triticum 
vulgare , varieties Chinese Spring and Thatcher, and various mutants 
of these two varieties, involving chromosome IX. They were as follows, 
with abreviations from Li (13) and Sears (22): 

— Chinese Spring tetrasomic for chromosome IX. (Chinese Spring: 
UO + I|.; Chinese Spring tetra-IX.) 

— Thatcher with the normal chromosome pair for IX replaced 
by a single telocentric or a single isochromosome for the long arm of

chromosome 3X. (Thatcher: kO + It and Thatcher: UO + i ; Thatcher 
telo-IX and Thatcher iso-IX.) 

Thatcher with the normal chromosome pair for IX replaced 
by a pair telocentric for the long arm of IX. (Thatcher: lj.0 + 2 It.) 

Thatcher with the normal pair for chromosomes IX replaced 
by a pair telocentric for the short arm of chromosome IX, or almost 
completely deficient for the long arm (19). (Thatcher: i|0 + 2 st.)

Grosses were made between Thatcher wheat and its mutants. 

All mutant parents were previously identified cytologically by 
examination of the pollen mother cells by the ace to carmine technique 
(2k)• The crosses were as follows:

Selfs of the various plant types were obtained by bagging 
the heads of cytologically identified plants In the field before 
microsporegenesis. 

Seed from cytologically identified plants of the various 
lines, and from crosses involving the lines, was treated with a 
mercuric fungicide, ,, MergaInma ,, , and space planted in the field in 
the Springs of 1957 and 1958.

Classification of Plants 


Phenotypic classification of the progeny of the crosses and 
the seifs was on the basis of height and head type. The height was 
determined by taking the average of the three tallest tillers of each 
plant. The various head types were classified under the following 
headings; 

Compactoid (indicating presence of k Q factors) 

Subcompactoid ( ” ” ” 3 ” ” ) 

Normal ( " " ,f 2 " " ) 

Speltoid ( ,f « » 1 « n ) 

The notation for head types is that of Mac Key (lli). The 
nullisomic, or 1|0 + 2 st mutants, (No Q factors), behaving like a 
nullisomic, has winter habit and so did not head under the conditions 
of the experiments. 

Little difficulty was experienced in classifying the plants 
phenotypically, either with regard to head type or to height. However, 
some cytological checks were made on pollen mother cells and chromosome 
numbers were found to be in accordance with previous phenotypic classi¬ 
fication. 


(c) Measurements of Ceil Lengths 

Epidermal cells of mature wheat stems were found to vary 
in length, depending on internode concerned, and where they were 
within an internode. Cells at the higher end of an internode 
were generally shorter than those nearer the base. Also cells near

the stomata, that might be considered as guard cells, were, in general, 
of a different size to neighboring epidermal cells. Therefore, the 
method of measurement finally adopted was to take the average length of 
cells within the full length of each internode. 

Stems, which had ceased elongating, were selected from typical 
specimens of the plants under investigation. The epidermal layer was 
stripped off, mounted in water, and the cells were counted from node 
to node, care being taken not to include cells directly adjoining the 
stomata. It was not possible to count one continuous line of cells 
from node to node, and perhaps not desirable. About 20 to 30 cells 
were counted in one line and then another line was chosen. The average 
length of cells was obtained by dividing the length of the internode by 
the number of cells. 

An estimate of the validity of the above method was made by 
counting cells in a strip of epidermic from a mature Thatcher plant, 
approximately $Q cells wide x 100 cells in length. Twenty counts were 
made over different sections of the strip. A mean of 98 cells was 
obtained with a Standard Error of one, giving a Coefficient of Variance, 
or % Standard Error, of approximately 1$.

RESULTS 


(a) The Stability and Gametic Transmission of the Telocentric and 

Isochromosome for the Long Arm of Chromosome 31 , 

As isochromosomes misdivide fairly readily to form te'lo- 
centrics, the possible progeny from a selfed plant of Thatcher iso-IX 
is as follows:

Table I shows the population obtained from selfed Thatcher: 
1*0 + i plants. In a similar analysis with Chinese Spring, Sears has 
shown the percentage of nullisomics to be 13*8 (22), a figure very 
close to that for "% nullisomics” in Table I # Unfortunately Sears did 
not give details for percentages of the other classes. However of 
68 phenotypically normal plants analyzed, he showed that all were 
of the type 1*0 + i, and none were 1*0 + 2 It. Table I shows all normals 
analyzed to be of the type 1*0 + i. 


An additional class to those expected was found in the

population described in Table I. This class has been designated 
"very late spelt". The reason for the lateness may be environmental, 
but this seems unlikely in view of the degree of lateness, the random 
distribution of the plants in the field, and the small standard error 
of the mean of the days to head. It is perhaps not too surprising 
that other mutant types should be observed in these lines, for as 
Mac Key points out chromosome IX is highly mutable ('ll;). Cytological 
examination of three of the very late spelt plants showed them to be 
monosomic, presumably as mono-telo IXs. Further investigations of 
these.plant types was not pursued. 

The gametic frequencies in Table II differ from those 
obtained for Chinese Spring by Sears (21). Transmission of the 
monosome was 3k% in 1957 and 2%% in 1956. See rows (i) and (ii) 

Table II. Sears shows such transmissions to be ll$. However he 
does remark that his low figures may be due to seasonal variation and 
he mentions a season when transmission of the monosome in iso-IX 
females was over 25$. Again the figures in Table II differ from those 
of Sears in that his percentage of gametes, from iso-IX females, 
carrying a derived telocentric in place of the isochromosome is much 
higher. In Sears 1 work about l/6th of the monosome gametes are 20 + 

It, whereas in Table II the figures in rows (i) and (ii) show that such 
gametes were l/l7th and l/ 25 >th of the monosome gametes in 1957 and 1958 
respectively. 

For the cross JUO + It x Thatcher, the figures in rows (v) and 
(vi) of Table II show no gametes with derived isochromosomes. The pop¬ 
ulation is perhaps small, however Sears showed such a cross to yield 13% of

the monosom.es as isochromosomes* 

Table II shows that the class “very late spelt” also occurs 
in these crosses; thus this class is not restricted to selfed Thatcher 
iso-IX populations* 

In general it appears that the work done in this study shows 
both telocentric and isochromosomes of Thatcher to be more stable than 
those of Chinese Spring as shown by Sears* 

2 

A X -test was made on the data in Table II to compare the 
values from the crosses involving the isochromosome for 1957 with those 
for 1958* As the 1957 populations were greater, the 1957 figures were 
regarded as the “theoretical”* The results were as follows: For female 
gametes (rows (i) and (ii)), with 2 degrees of freedom, - 3*7 and P3> 
.1 

For male gametes (rows (iii) and (iv)) with 2 degrees of Freedom, 

X 2 = 17.1* and P<.01. 

Thus it appears that the proportions of female gametes 
involved in fertilization are fairly constant, and, assuming approxi¬ 
mately equal proportions of gametes to be produced both at macrospore- 
genesis and microsporegenesis, competition between male gametes seems 
to vary considerably, probably being governed by such environmental 
conditions as temperature and humidity* 

The average female gametic frequencies, from the combined data 


of rows (i) and (ii) of Table II are 70*5 % for 20-chromosome, 1*5 % 
for 20 + It, and 28*0 % for 20 + i gametes respectively*

of male and female gametes to give the various somatic types (arrows

that male gametes are also produced in the same ratio, the following 
estimate of competition between male gametes is arrived at*

if these gametes were initially present in equal numbers (i.e. in 
column A), it thus gives a selection coefficient for each gamete. 

It can be seen that the transmission of male gametes 
in selfed Thatcher iso-IK plants shows a highly competitive action 
favouring the 20 + It gamete. 

(b) The Phenotypic Effect of Chromosome IS on Height 

Tables III and IV show the direct relation of chromosome IK 
to height. Table V is developed from Table III and attempts to show 
the precise effect per dose of long arm or short arm on height. Thus the 
long arm apparently causes a loss of approximately 17 centimeters per 
dose in Thatcher. The effect of the short arm seems to be an increase 
in height by about 12 centimeters, one dose being sufficient to give 
the maximum increase. It seems reasonable to suppose that the control 
of growth by the short arm involves a different physiological mechanism 
than that governed by the long arm. 

The cross Thatcher: 1*0 + 2 st x Thatcher 1*0 + 2 It, 
designed initially to produce a wheat with 22 bivalents, provided 
further evidence of the effect of the short arm on height. 

From Table V the F^ of such a cross might be expected to 
give rise to the following phenotypic classes: (see page 26)

* As indicated by Table II row (v), (vi) and (vii) little or no activity 


is expected from gametes carrying isochromosomes. 


It would be expected that in fertilization the most active 
female gamete would be 20 , and the most active male gamete would 
possibly be 20 + It + st, followed by 20 + It. If this is so the two 
most frequent classes should be Late spelt, 110 cm., and Late spelt 
98 cm. 


The F 2 of the cross Thatcher; I 4 .O + 2 st x Thatcher; 

I 4 .O + 2 It was indeed found to segregate in the manner suggested above, 
as is shown in Table VI. Thus it appears most likely that the short 
arm of chromosome IX carries genetic material that gives rise to about 
12 centimeters of plant height. 


Cytological examinations of pollen mother cells of four 
of the F 2 plants gave these results; (See Figs. 8 to lo)

(e) Comparison of Cell Lengths 

Table VII shows a trend of the overall average length of 
cells being longer in the speltoid Thatcher mutant and shorter in the 
compactoid mutant* However it appears that the difference in cell 
length by no means entirely accounts for the difference in height 
between the various types* 

Thus the following ratios, based on figures from Table VII, 
indicate that both cell division and cell elongation are responsible 
for the differences in height.

Although further measurements are needed it appears that 
the excess height of Chinese Spring over Thatcher cannot be accounted 
for by cell elongation, and is due only to differences in cell numbers.

PART II. SEEDLINGS: GROWTH, AMD AUXIN METABOLISM. 


MATERIALS AND METHODS 


Unless otherwise stated, the plant types used throughout 
Parts II and III of this study were Chinese Spring and the mutant 
Chinese Spring tetra-IX, and Thatcher and the mutant Thatcher: 
hO + 2 st # These types were chosen because they include both the 
tall type of the speltoid-compactoid series and the dwarf, and, 
except for Chinese Spring tetra-IX, they are true breeding. Chinese 
Spring tetra-IX is true breeding to the extent that about 8C$ of the 
progeny are of the parental type (22), and so is reasonally satis¬ 
factory in this respect. 

(a) Growth, and Rates of Growth of Seedlings 
Treatment of Seeds and Seedlings 

To ensure a fair measure of freedom from bacterial and 
fungal contamination all seeds were first placed in a solution 
of "Perfex", a commercial sodium hypochlorite, for six minutes. 

Seeds were then rinsed in sterile water before being placed on moist 
filter paper in sterilized petri dishes, or germinated in moist 
vermiculite in suitable containers. With few exceptions sterile 
tap water without added nutrients was used throughout the period 
of growth of the seedlings. 


It was found that at room temperature germination was not 










- 35 - 


sufficiently even for the experiments. Particularly was this true 
of seeds from Chinese Spring tetra-IX. However by first placing the 
germinating seeds in the cold at about 3° C, for three days, quite 
even germination was obtained. Without this cold treatment it some¬ 
times appeared impossible to break what seemed to be a dormancy 
factor in Chinese Spring tetra-IX seeds, evident if they were left 
to germinate at room temperature. 

After the cold treatment, seeds in petri dishes were trans¬ 
ferred to plastic holders consisting of verticle strips of plastic with 
holes into which the seeds were fitted. These were in turn placed in 
dishes and then covered with vermiculite. The purpose of the holders was 
to ensure that all seeds planted remained at the same depth. However 
seeds planted initially in vermiculite at a depth of about -J inch were 
also found to be quite satisfactory for measurement. Measurements were 
made from the level of the vermiculite usually at time intervals of 2k 
hours. Comparisons were made between seeds grown in the same container, 
except where indicated. Checks were made to see if early growth was 
directly related to dry seed weight. 

Light and Temperature Conditions 

Seedlings were grown at room temperature, the temperature 
being between 75° F. and 85° F. Seedlings were grown both in the dark 
and in the light. For measurements, dark-grown seeds were exposed 
only to a weak red light, the source of which was a Ip watt red 
Westinghouse bulb, or a Kodak Safelight with a Wratten Safelight 
Series 2 red filter and a 15 watt bulb. Seedlings grown in light were

grown in the room near a window, no additional light being supplied 
at night* 

Older Seedlings 

The growth rate of seedlings grown in flats in a mixture 
of soil, peat moss, and sand (3:3*1 v/v) was also studied to a limited 
extent. After the cold treatment in petri dishes, as described earlier, 
the seedlings of the various types were planted in flats and placed 
outside in cold frames. These seedlings were harvested at various 
intervals for other experiments and their heights at times of harvest 
were noted. 

(b) Auxin Assays: Free Auxin, Indoleacetic Acid Oxidase , 

and Auxin Synthesis 

Methods Involving Coleoptile Curvature 

The general method for the experiments is well described 
in "Auxins and Plant Growth” by Leopold (12). Certain modifications 
were made; instead of the conventional Avena coleoptile apparatus, 
holders for the seedlings were made from corks cut, bored and fitted 
with glass tubing, as shown in Fig. 11^- Batteries of holders were 
held in galvanized tin troughs. Moulds for the agar were made from 
pieces of plastic, their inside measurements being 12 mm. x 9 ram. 
x 1.5 mm. Blocklets of agar were cut from the moulds with a 2 mm. 
square cutting die made from a piece of small-bore aluminum tubing. 
Before use the agar was washed and dried'. It was used at a concentration 


■* On page 60. 














- 37 - 


of 1 . 25 $ to 3% in demineralized distilled water, with or without 
added indoleacetic acid. 

All operations involving the preparation of the coleoptiles 
were carried out in a dark room under red light, as described previously 
for dark-grown seedlings. In order to maintain the required humidity 
conditions for the agar, the dark room hot water taps were run when 
applying the blocklets to the coleoptiles. After the agar blocklets 
were applied the coleoptiles were placed in a humidity chamber, made 
from a converted Shandon chromatography cabinet, where they remained 
during the lj hours of the run. At the end of the run shadowgraphs 
of the coleoptiles were made on Kodabromide FI 4 . paper. Measurements 
of the angles of curvature were obtained from the shadowgraphs, see 
Figs. 20-23. 

Assay of Free Auxin in Wheat Coleoptile Tips 

Avena coleoptiles, of the variety Victory, were prepared in 
the conventional manner (12). 

Wheat seeds were treated as previously described to ensure 
reasonably even germination. The seedlings were maintained in the 
dark throughout the experiment, except for exposure to red light 
during operations. Three days after removal from the cold room the 
wheat coleoptiles were about 20 to 30 mm. long and ready for use in 
the actual experiments. 

1 mm. to Ij. ram. tips were cut from the coleoptiles, the 
primary leaf removed, and the tips placed immediately on the blocks 












. 













- 38 - 


of agar, in numbers ranging from 12 to 5>0 per block, for from one 
to five hours, depending on the experiment. The agar was than cut 
into b'locklets and applied to the Avena coleoptiles* 

It is believed that during diffusion of the auxin, from the 
plant*s growing tip to the agar, auxin destruction may take place (31). 
In an atterrpt to reduce such destruction to a minimum the following 
additional methods were used: 

(i) The coleoptile tips were allowed to stand on moist 
filter paper for from 10 minutes to 1 hour as suggested by Van Overbeck 
(31). By doing this it is thought that auxin inactivating enzymes are 
washed from the cut surface while the auxin continues to be produced 

at a constant rate for several hours (31). 

(ii) As described by Steeves et al. (25), a drop of 10“^M 
potassium cyanide solution was placed on the agar block prior to 
applying the coleoptile tips for auxin diffusion, and then, an hour 
before the actual run, the cyanide ions were precipitated with a 
drop of ICT^M ferric sulfate solution. It was thought that by the 
use of this treatment cyanide ions would inhibit the action of auxin¬ 
inactivating enzymes. 

Buffered agar, as suggested by Larsen (11), was also used. 

But neither this nor any of the methods described above resulted in 
a curvature. 

Oat coleoptile tips were run as a check in place of the 










- 39 


wheat tips and were found to give a reasonable curvature* Oat coleoptile 
tips were also used successfully by Steeves et al. (25), both with 
and without the cyanide treatment. Consequently it was thought that 
the Avena coleoptiles and the wheat coleoptile tips might contain 
substances that were antagonistic to one another, and so preventing 
the expected auxin activity. Thus the following method was developed: 

Adaptation of the Avena Curvature Test to a Triticum Curvature Test 

The general procedure of these experiments was as above, 
except that Triticum coleoptiles, variety Chinese Spring were sub¬ 
stituted for Avena Coleoptiles. Treatment of the substituted Triticum 
coleoptiles was the same as for the Avena coleoptiles, but again no 
curvature was observed. It may possibly be that free auxin in the 
wheat coleoptile tips is released in very small amounts so that any 
enzymic inactivation that might occur at the cut surface would destroy 
most of the diffusable auxin. 

The Triticum coleoptile test was finally used in the 
following manner. 

Known quantities of indoleacetic acid were applied in agar 
blocklets to coleoptiles of Chinese Spring, Chinese Spring tetra-IX, 
Thatcher, Thatcher kO + 2 st, and Thatcher UO + 2 It, all prepared in 
the same way as the oat coleoptiles, except that they were given the 
added cold treatment as described earlier. Concentrations of indole¬ 
acetic acid of from 0.1 mg. per liter to 0.2 mg. per liter, were found 










- Uo - 


to give measurable and consistent curvatures. All runs contained two 
sets of coleoptiles, comparisons being made between two seedling types 
in each experiment. 

It is thought that indoleacetic acid, diffusing from the agar 
blocklet into the wheat coleoptile in the above type of experiment, is 
oxidized by the indoleacetic acid oxidase present in the coleoptile. 

It is thus concluded that the degree of curvature would be inversely 
proportional to the activity of the indoleacetic acid oxidase present. 

Colorimetric Determination of Indoleacetic Acid Oxidase 

The varieties Chinese Spring, Chinese Spring-tetra IX, 

Thatcher, and Thatcher: lj.0 + 2 st, were grown in flats as described 
previously on page 36 • Six flats were prepared, each of which contained 
all of these four lines. 

The method used for estimating the indoleacetic acid cxidase 
activity in plant extracts from these types of seedlings was based on 
that developed by Waygood (3k)* At three day intervals, the flats were 
harvested two at a time, the seedlings from one flat being kept separate 
from those of the other. The plants were cut at soil level, weighed 
immediately on an electric balance, and then immediately placed in a 
deep freeze at —'ll; 0 C. for one hour. The separate lots of frozen 
seedlings^were ground in a chilled mortar in a cold room at 3° C., 
with the addition of about 20 ml. of demineralized distilled water. 

The homogenates were then centrifuged at 5000 r.p.m. for 1 hour, after 
which the supernatents were poured into dialyzing sacks and placed in

2 liter beakers of demineralized distilled water in the cold room, the 
water being changed twice a day* At the end of six days the dialyzates 
were centrifuged for one hour and the supernatent poured into erlenmeyer 
flasks and stored in the deep freeze. 

To determine the activity of indoleacetic acid oxidase present 
in the extracts, 5 ml. aliquots of an extract were diluted with deminera¬ 
lized distilled water to a total volume equal to multiples of the frozen 
weight in grams, the multiples ranging from 25 to 200. One ml. of this 
diluted extract was than added to each of several variations of the 
following reaction mixture: 

1 ml. 2,U-dichlorophenol (10"^M) 

1 ml. MnCl„ (10" 3 M) 

2 ml. Orthophosphate buffer pH 6.1 (l/lO M), made up to 
10 mis. with indoleacetic acid solution in varying concentrations, 
from 20 to 1^0 mg. per litter (3U). 

The reaction mixture with the plant extract was placed on a 
shaker and incubated for one hour in the dark. At the end of this 
time 1 ml. aliquots of the reaction mixture were added to 2 mis. of 
the Gordon and Weber modification of the Salkowski reagent (8). 
Colorimetric determinations were made according to the method of Gordon 
and Weber (8). The color development was allowed to proceed for \ hour 
and the optical density was than read on a Bausch and Lomb colorimeter 
at a wavelength of 350 mu. Runs were duplicated and comparisons were 
made between duplicate samples of the different seedling types. 









A standard curve. Fig, 2h, was obtained for optical density 
vs. indoleacetic acid concentration, and the amount of indoleacetic 
acid destroyed in the reaction mixture was thus estimated. 

Growth of Coleoptile Segments in Tryptophan as a Measure of Auxin 

Synthesis 

As it seemed possible to estimate auxin inactivation in the 
various seedlings, but not possible, at least by diffusion technique, 
to estimate the amount of free auxin actually present, it was thought 
desirable to attempt an estimate of auxin synthesis from tryptophan. 

The method used was adapted from the conventional Avena 
straight growth test (12), with wheat coleoptile segments replacing the 
Avena segments. Other, perhaps, better, methods are described in the 
literature ( 33 ) > but were thought rather complex for an initial 
experiment in this work. 

Seedlings of Chinese Spring, Chinese Spring tetra-IX, 

Thatcher and Thatcher: lj.0 2 st, were germinated in the dark with 
cold treatment, as described previously. When the cole optiles were 
about 20 mm. long, 5 mm. segments were cut from a region 5 mm. from 
the tips, one segment being cut per coleoptile. The operation was 
carried out under red light and the segments were placed in water, 
tryptophan solution and in some cases indoleacetic acid solution, 
both the latter at 0.5 mg. per liter. About 10 segments were used 
for each petri dish containing 20 ml. of solution. In some of the 
experiments a 2 % sucrose solution was used as a basis instead of

water. The segments were left in the solutions in the dark for 2k hours 
and were then placed on a piece of glass, and, with the use of a photo¬ 
graphic enlarger, shadowgraphs of 2X magnification were obtained. 
Segments were then measured from the shadowgraphs. Differences in 
length between water-treated and tryptophan-or indoleacetic acid- 
treated segments were obtained to give an estimate of growth due to 
either tryptophan or indoleacetic acid. 


(c) Bioassay of Adenine in Plant Extracts 

Plant extracts were prepared as described in the method for 
the colorimetric estimation of indoleacetic acid on page I 4 . 0 , except 
that the extracts were not dialyzed. Plants from two separate flats 
were used. 

The method of estimating adenine present in the plant extracts 
was by comparisons of the growth of a purple adenineless mutant of 
Neurospora in media containing the plant extracts. The minimal medium 
used was that described by H.J. Vogel (32). The plant extracts were 
diluted with demineralized distilled water to a total volume equal in 
ml. to ten times the fresh weight in grams. In the first experiment 
10 ml. of the diluted plant extract was added to 2$0 ml. of minimal 
medium per flask. The medium was then autoclaved for ten minutes and, 
on cooling, inoculated with a 2 ml. spore suspension of the Neurospora 
mutant. The inoculated medium x*as incubated for a week at 30° C. 

It was then filtered and the Neurospora growth weighed on the filter

paper. The second experiment was a repetition of the first, except 
that 1*0 ml. of minimal medium was used per flask with 5 ml. of the 
same plant extracts. Photographs were obtained of the second experi¬ 
ment; weight differences were too small to be accurately measured. 
Controls run in both experiments consisted of inoculated minimal 
medium with no plant extract added. 

(d) Paper Chromatographic Seperation of Free Amino Acids 

The general method used was based upon that described by 
Buzzati-Traverso (2). Plant material was applied to the chromato¬ 
graphic paper by squashing root tips of the various plant types under 
investigation directly on the paper so that they formed small spots 
of squashed material. Root tips from three seedlings were used per 
squash; the seedlings were four or five days old, and six or seven 
root tips, 5 mm. in length, were selected from them. 

Both one- and two-dimensional chromatography was used, and 
in all cases the descending technique was chosen. Watman No. 1 paper 
was used throughout the experiments. 

For the single dimensional, the solvent and color development 
was as described by Woiwood ( 35 )# The solvent was 2l| ml. glacial acetic 
acid added to 200 ml. n-butanol and water (v/v 50/50). After preparat¬ 
ion the bottom layer of this mixture was drawn off and placed in the 
bottom of the chromatography cabinet with a beaker of water. The top 
layer was used as the actual solvent. At the end of the run the paper 
was dried over-night at room temperature. The amino acids were then

detected by spraying with .1$ ninhydrin in n-butanol with .1$ collidine 
added, and again allowing to dry. 

For the two dimensional chromatography the solvents and 
color development were as described by Hausmann (9). The solvents 
were 150 ml. redistilled sec-butano'l + 60 ml. Jfo aqueous ammonia run 
twice down the long edge, and 1^0 ml. redistilled sec-butanol + 30 ml. 
88 $ aqueous formic acid + 20 ml. water, run once along the short edge. 
At the completion of the run the papers were dried at room temperature, 
and the amino acids were detected by spraying the paper with .3$ 
ninhydrin in ethanol and allowing the color reaction to proceed in the 
dark for 18 hours. 









RESULTS 


(a) Growth of Seedlings 

Table VIII, and Figs* 15 to 18, show that the differences in 
growth between the mutants and the normal may be detected in very 
young seedlings. 

Coleoptile length was chosen as a convenient standard 
measurement for comparisons between young seedlings with respect to 
growth.. Although coleoptile measurements in Table VIII have quite 
high standard errors, the differences in length between normal and 
mutant seedlings is sufficient to conclude that the physiological 
growth mechanism causing the mutant phenotypes appears to be operative 
from the time of germination. Table VIII shows no correlation between 
dry seed weight and early seedling growth. However in all probability 
food storage in the seed would eventually become a limiting factor in 
the growth rate of seedlings grown in inert material and supplied only 
with water. 

Figs. 15 to 18 also support the conclusions drawn from Table 
VIII. From these figures and Table VIII it appears that dark conditions 
have an effect on the normal similar to that on the mutants. Thus it 
was concluded that whatever part light may play in growth, it was not 
a factor related to reactions directly causing the differences between 
mutants and normals. If the reverse were true it would be expected 
that the growth rate of the shorter plant would tend to approach that 
of the taller when both were subjected to dark conditions, and such

does not appear to be the case. Comparisons between Figs. 15 to 18 
are not strictly valid as each figure describes a separate experiment 
with its own set of conditions, e.g. temperature and humidity. 

Fig. 19 indicates that with outdoor grown plants the winter 
type of growth of the Thatcher mutant seems to first become detectable 
when the seedlings are about three weeks old. 

These experiments did indicate that it is valid to seek 
physiological differences between the plants at the seedling stage. 

It should perhaps be pointed out that owing to the variation existing 
in coleoptile height and growth rate, it was very difficult to correlate 
differences in these two factors, to particular mutant seedlings in the 
segregating populations from selfed Thatcher iso-IX plants. 

(b) Indoleacetic Acid Oxidase 
Triticum Coleoptile Curvature 

If the curvatures of wheat coleoptiles resulting from the 
application of known quantities of indoleacetic acid are inversely 
proportional to the indoleacetic acid oxidase activity in the coleoptiles, 
then Table IX, and Figs. 20 to 23 show that such activity is greater 
in Thatcher than in Chinese Spring, and that little difference of 
activity is present between the mutants and their specific normals. 

Note that the mutant Thatcher: lj.0 + 2 It is also studied in this test, 
see Table IX and Fig. 22, its reaction was compared with that of Thatcher. 
Differences between Thatcher and this mutant would suggest activity due 
to the short arm of chromosome IX, but such differences did not exist.

t = 1.1, and at 1 D.F. P > .1 

The test thus shows a significant difference between Chinese 
Spring and Thatcher at the 1$ level, but the differences between the 
mutants and their respective normals are regarded as insignificant. 
These results are interpreted as meaning that the activity of indole¬ 
acetic acid oxidase is greater in Thatcher than in Chinese Spring, 
and that virtually no differences in this activity are present between 
the mutants and their normals. 

The reason that mature Thatcher is about 20 cm. shorter than 
mature Chinese Spring may be due to a greater activity of indoleacetic 
acid oxidase in Thatcher. 

Colorimetric Estimation of Indoleacetic Acid Oxidase 

Table X shows the results of the colorimetric estimation 
of indoleacetic acid oxidase activity to be similar to the results 
obtained from the coleoptile curvature test, and substantiates the 
hypothesis that amount of coleoptile curvature is directly related

to indoleacetic acid oxidase activity. However a t-test for paired 
data did not indicate a highly significant difference between the 
values for Thatcher and Chinese Spring in Part C of Table X, the 
value of t being 3.58, giving a P<,1 and > .05, for 2 D.F. But 
when these values are compared with those from t-tests for paired 
data on the figures for Chinese Spring and Chinese Spring tetra-IX 
in Part A of the table, and on the figures for Thatcher and Thatcher: 
U0 + 2 st in Part B of the table, the differences become more obvious. 
Thus a t-test for Chinese Spring, and Chinese Spring tetra-IX gives 
t = .56, and with 3 D.F. P> .5, and for Thatcher and Thatcher: UO + 

2 st, t - .35 and with 3 D.F. P>.5» It is reasonable to conclude 
that the test showed relatively no differences between the activity 
of indoleacetic acid oxidase in the normals and their mutants, and 
that such differences were relatively large between Chinese Spring 
and Thatcher. 

Fig. 25 again shows that indoleacetic acid oxidase is of 
a greater activity in Thatcher than in Chinese Spring. A t-test for 
paired data on the values in the histogram gives t - 3 *7U giving 
P<.05 and > .02 at 3 D.F. 

(c) Growth from Tryptophan 

Table XI shows the results of the straight growth test. 

These results show considerable variation and are rather inconclusive* 
The differences in growth between segments in water and in tryptophan 
are not significant by the t-test. However the segments in tryptophan

show a consistent though small excess growth over those in water* 

It is concluded that this growth is likely due to synthesis of 
indoleacetic acid from tryptophan, but it was not possible to determine 
whether such synthesis proceeded at a greater rate in one type of 
seedling than in another* 

As increase in dosage of the Q factor of chromosome IX 
results in decrease in growth, it is perhaps less logical to expect 
differences in auxin synthesis than differences in auxin inactivation 
as a cause of growth differences* There is no evidence from the 
literature, as yet, that differences in synthesis of auxin from 
tryptophan are a cause of dwarfism and so it was not thought expedient 
to pursue this approach with more complex experiments at this time. 

(d) Bioassay of Adenine in Plant Extracts 

Table XII shows the results of the first experiment. 

Although consistent differences are shown they are not significant 
according to the t-test for paired data, which is to be expected 
because of the relatively small differences and few samples. However 
when the second experiment is also considered it is reasonable to 
conclude that differences in adenine content of the two plant types 
on a fresh weight basis do probably exist. A photograph of the 
second experiment is shown in Fig. 26; differences in weights in 
this experiment were too small to be accurately measured.

mutants and normals in both Thatcher and Chinese Spring to be remark¬ 
ably constant. All the plant types appeared to have the same pattern 
and relative amounts of free amino acids. Single dimensional chromato¬ 
graphy separated about 12 amono acids, and two dimensional about 19. 
Since no differences were observed, no attempt was made to identify the 
amino acids. Because of the possible role played by tryptophan in 
indoleacetic acid metabolism this amino acid was of particular interest, 
but as none of the chromatogrammed amino acids fluoresced in ultra 
violet light it was concluded that tryptophan was not present as a free 
amino acid in the tissues investigated, at least not in amounts large 
enough to be detected.

PART III. SEEDLINGS: RESPONSE TO POTASSIUM GIBBEREILATE AND 

KINETIN SOLUTIONS . 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
( a ) Preparation of Seedlings 

Seeds were pretreated with "Perfex" and planted in verraiculite 
contained in shallow tinfoil pans. The vermiculite was kept moist with 
potassium gibberellate or kinetin solutions; these substances, except 
for controls, were used in place of water throughout the experiments. 

It was thought that this method of supplying the substances was a 
more consistent form of treatment than either spraying or adding them 
in any form, at a later stage of growth. After planting, the seeds were 
kept in the cold at 3° C. lor three days, as previously described, in 
order to promote even germination. After the cold treatment the pans 
were placed in the light, by a window, and the seeds were left to grow 
at room temperature. 

Where comparisons between separate pans of seedlings were 
desired equal quantities of solutions were added, as required to each 
of the pans under comparison. Controls were run under the same con¬ 
ditions as the treated seedlings, except that sterile water was used in 
place of the solutions of growth substances. The seedlings were measured 
every 2k hours. Graphs were drawn from the averages of seedling heights. 
The number of seedlings used, and the concentration of growth substances 
varied with experiment as indicated in the results.

(b) Preparation of Solutions 

Kinetin was obtained from the California Foundation of 
Biochemical Research, Los Angeles. Solutions of 5 mg. and 0.5 mg. 
kinetin per liter were prepared from tap water. Kinetin is rather 
insoluble in water and so was first dissolved in a few ml. of IN HCI 
and then added to the water. The pH of the solutions was readjusted 
to that of tap water by additions of IN NaQH. Before use the 
solutions were autoclaved at 115° C. for 5 minutes. 

Gibberellin was obtained from Merck and Co., Montreal, in 
the form of potassium gibberellate. Solutions of 50 mg. and 100 mg. 
potassium gibberellate per liter were prepared from tap water. 

Potassium gibberellate is highly soluable in water and so was dissolved 
without pretreatment. Before use these solutions were also autoclaved 
at 115° C. for 5 minutes.

RESULTS 

( a ) The Effect of Kinebin 

Fig. 27 shows that kinetin, at a concentration of 5 mg. per 
liter had the general effect of depressing growth in both Chinese 
Spring and its mutant Chinese Spring tetra-IX. 

Fig. 28 shows that not only did kinetin have a general 
depressive effect on the growth rate, but also that the resultant 
growth rates of the mutant and normal in Chinese Spring tend to become 
equal. 


Fig. 29 shows that the effect of kinetin on the growth of 
the Thatcher mutant and its normal was again depressive, but possibly 
to a less extent than with the Chinese Spring types. Fig. 29 also 
shows that kinetin tended to equalize the growth rates of Thatcher and 
its mutant. 


Fig. 30 shows that the growth rate of both Thatcher and 
Chinese Spring tended to become equal when they were grown in kinetin 
solutions. This appeared to be particularly true where the concent¬ 
ration of kinetin is $ mg. per liter. Fig. 30 further shows that in 
this experiment the depressive effect was greater with Chinese Spring 
than with Thatcher, and greater at 5 mg. per liter than at 0.5 nig. 
per liter. 


From the results shown in Fig. 27 to 30 it is hypothesised 
that the action of kinetin on growth in these experiments, involves 












































Wm 









, 





















* 

, 







* 



- 71 - 


the formation of a complex between kinetin and an unknown compound, 
or compounds, present in the wheat plant. It is suggested that the 
unknown compound is present in greater amounts in Chinese Spring than 
in Thatcher, hence the greater depressive effect of kinetin on the 
growth rate, and on the total growth of Chinese Spring. The tendency 
for the growth rate of the normal and the mutant to become equal, while 
the normally taller plant remains relatively taller than the normally 
shorter plant, suggests that the amounts of the hypothesised compound 
present in the mutants tends to be the same as the amounts present in 
their respective normals. 

That kinetin has a differential effect on Chinese Spring 
and Thatcher, and does not simply reduce growth in the plant types 
studied, suggests the action of kinetin not to be one of a simple 
or partial inhibition of growth substances. 

(b) The Effect of Potassium Gibberellate 

Fig. 27 shows that the effect potassium gibberellate, at a 
concentration of $0 mg. per liter,was to increase the growth rates of 
both Chinese Spring and Chinese Spring tetra-IX, and it appears that 
these growth rates tend to become equal. 

Fig. 31 shows that potassium gibberellate at 50 mg. per liter 
resulted in both the growth, and growth rate, of Thatcher and Thatcher: 
UO + 2 st becoming remarkably equal. 


Fig. 32 shows a repetition of the effect of potassium

- 72 - 


gibberellate in Fig. 31* and with potassium gibberellate at 100 mg. per 
liter a similar but much less marked effect. 

Thus the effect of gibberellinwas not only to increase growth 
rates, but also tended to result in both the growth rate, and the over¬ 
all growth in the mutants becoming equal to these two factors in the 
respective normals. Such an effect is similar to that described by 
Phinney (16) for dwarf mutants in maize, except that the taller plants 
described by Phinney increased in growth to only a slight extent. 

However it is possible that at a particular concentration of potassium 
gibberellate, probably less than 5>0 mg. per liter, the taller Thatcher 
may increase in growth only slightly while the shorter increases to a 
greater extent, to equal the taller. Indeed, it may be possible to 
find a concentration of gibberellin at which the whole speltoid- 
compactoid series (as present in a population from selfed Thatcher 
iso-IX) can all be made to grow at the same rate and to the same 
height. 


(c) Kinetin and Gibberellin Compared 

From these experiments it is concluded that both kinetin 
and gibberellin tend to equalize the growth rates of the normals and 
their respective mutants. The two substances differ in their effect, 
the one increasing growth rate and the other decreasing growth rate. 
At the concentrations used it was possible with gibberellin to obtain 
nearly equal overall growth for mutant and normal, but with kinetin 
this effect was not so apparent.

DISCUSSION 


It was thought that one of the more obvious possibilities 
for the cause of decrease in growth from increase in dosage of the 
long arm of chromosome IK was an exaggerated destruction of indole- 
acetic acid without a concomitant increase in growth, such as was 
suggested by the classic work of Van Overbeek with the Nana dwarf 
in maize (30). However it must now be concluded that auxin destruction 
in the form of indoleacetic acid oxidase activity is not the basis for 
the differences in heights between the various mutants involving the long 
arm of chromosome IK and their normals. Neither is the decrease 
in height, due to the absence of the short arm of chromosome IK, 
based on differences in indoleacetic acid oxidase activity, as is 
shown by the coleoptile curvature of Thatcher and Thatcher: i|0 + 2 It 
in Fig. 22. Similar experiments carried out by Von Abrams (33) on 
normal and dwarf peas also failed to yield any evidence of differences 
in indoleacetic acid metabolism. However Von Abrams cites other work 
in which the decrease in growth of another dwarf mutant in peas was 
shown to be due to the inactivation of auxin by oxidizing enzymes. 

In nearly all the experiments described in the literature, 
that seek the cause of dwarfism, no mention is made of an attempt to 
measure cell length. It is of considerable interest to know whether 
a plant is dwarf because of a decrease in cell length or a decrease 
in cell numbers. A decrease in cell numbers rather than cell length 
would suggest a more complex basis for dwarfism than simply a shortage 
of indoleacetic acid. In the plants investigated in the present study

it is apparent that both cell length and cell numbers are decreased 
in the dwarf. 

The presence of a higher concentration of adenine in the 
plant extracts of the taller plant than the shorter, suggests the 
more complex type of growth relationships described by Skoog (23). 

Thus variations in the ratio of adenine to indoleacetic acid may pro¬ 
mote differences in cell division as well as cell elongation. However 
further experiments concerning the adenine concentration of these plants 
are needed. In particular the assay should be carried out on a dry 
weight and a nitrogen basis, and also enlarged to include Thatcher and 
Thatcher: I 4 .O + 2 st seedlings. 

Phinney (17) describes 5 mutants in maize that respond by 
normal growth to minute amounts of gibberellic acid, and another 3 
mutants that respond in some degree to gibberellic acid. None of these 
mutants respond to indoleacetic acid, amino acids, or kinetin. Phinney 
believes that because extracts of certain higher plants behave similarly 
to gibberellic acid in a number of chemical, physical and biological 
reactions, there is sufficient evidence to suggest a new class of 
plant growth regulators that are gibberellin-like. He further 
believes that the dwarf mutants of maize which show a response to 
gibberellic acid, are dwarf because of an abnormal control of the 
synthesis or metabolism of naturally occuring gibberellin-like sub¬ 
stances. A similar reasoning, based on the results of treating seed¬ 
lings of the mutants and normals in the speltoid-compactoid series with 
potassium gibberellate, suggests that the long arm of chromosome IX

may likely control the synthesis or metabolism of gibberellin-like 
substances in wheat, although, admittedly, more experiments are necessary, 
particularly with regard to the effect of gibberellic acid on the 
mature phenotypes of the series* 

Unlike Phinney^s mutants, the mutants in the present study 
responded to kinetin, and it might be concluded that, as the response 
to kinetin is not unlike that to gibberellin, the long arm of chromo¬ 
some IX also controls the synthesis of metabolism of kinetin-like 
substances in the plant i.e. increasing dosages of chromosome IX 
resulting in increased activity of kinetin in the plant* But there 
is no evidence, as yet, to suggest that kinetin is present in higher 
plants, so the conclusion is less valid than that suggested for 
gibberellic acid. However the following analogy may be drawn: 
kinetin acting like a key, fits into a lock-like mechanism in the 
plant to open the door to a certain metabolic pathway manifested 
in the response of the seedlings to kinetin. This analogy would 
indicate that the presence of such a mechanism to respond to kinetin 
points to naturally occuring kinetin-like substances that could also 
fit the mechanism, for the presence of a lock suggests the presence 
of a key* 

The difference in the activity of indoleacetic acid oxidase 
in Chinese Spring and in Thatcher is interesting, particularly when 
considered with the possibility that cell length does not appear to 
be the reason for differences in height between Thatcher and Chinese 
Spring. However further evidence is required particularly with

regard to the synthesis of indoleacetic acid, before it can be 
speculated that indoleacetic acid oxidase activity is the principle 
reason for Thatcher being shorter than Chinese Spring. 

The use of Chinese Spring-Thatcher substitution lines might 
prove a fruitful! means of gaining further information on the differences 
between Chinese Spring and Thatcher that have been shown to exist in 
this study. This would be of interest not only for growth regulating 
mechanism but also for the differences in the stability of the iso¬ 
chromosome in Thatcher and in Chinese Spring. 

It is believed that such studies as have been described in 
this work concerning the correlation between genetic and physiological 
differences, form an exceptionally useful approach for increase of 
biochemical information. Thus the presence of a gene is only detected 
through it being present in the forms of at least two different alleles; 
similarly it is conceivable that the presence of a biochemical reaction 
may only, or at least more readily, be detected by studying plants, or 
other organism, with relatively small but detectable genetic differences. 

Another aspect of the work which has been sufficiently 
striking to be worth drawing attention to, is the precise degree in 
which many of the reactions investigated make themselves apparent. 

This is true of the growth mechanism controlled by the long arm of 
chromosome 3X, of that controlled by the short arm, of the activity 
of indoleacetic acid oxidase, and of the patterns of free amino acids, 
all of which have very exact manifestations.

The berm homeostasis was first used by the physiologist 
W.B. Cannon in "The Wisdom of the Body”. As it was first described 
homeostasis was defined as the "coordinated physiological processes 
which maintain most of the steady states in the organism” (3)* The 
interesting aspect of homeostasis is its place in evolution. As 
Cannon ably points out homeostasis results in an organism, in part, 
freeing itself from its external environment, by virtue of its various 
internal mechanisms which maintain the steady states in the face of 
a fluctuating environment* 

To develop Cannons argument and bring it a little up to 
date, it is suggested that there is an evolution of sequences of 
chemical reactions, resulting in a more economical production and 
usage of energy, so that evolutionary higher organisms have an energy 
advantage over lower organisms. Thus whereas more primitive plants 
might show a wide diversity of reactions x^ithin a group, more advanced 
plants result from the selection of the more economical of these 
reaction sequences and thus have an energy or chemical advantage* 
Admittedly with wheat the selecting agency has been man rather than 
nature, nevertheless the same specific sets of reactions are selected 
for. 

What is proposed, then, is that underlying biological 
evolution, is the chemical evolution of sequences of increasingly 
efficient reactions of a physical chemical nature. Thus the evidence 
for precise reactions such as must govern the increase in growth due 
to the short arm of chromosome IX, or the qualitative and quantitative

exactness of free amino acids present in the plant types, demonstrates 
the presence of homeostasitic systems that are presumably derived 
from the physical chemical basis of evolution. 





SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


The experiments have shown that the telocentric and iso- 
chromosome for the long arm of chromosome IX are more stable in Thatcher 
than in Chinese Spring. It has been shown that the short arm of 
chromosome IX is responsible for increase in plant height. Both cell 
length and cell numbers account for differences in height between the 
mutants and normals of the speltoid-cornpactoid series. 

The enzymatic destruction of indoleacetic acid by the plants 
of the speltoid-cornpactoid series, cannot account for the differences 
in their growth, however this destruction may have some bearing on the 
differences in height of Thatcher and Chinese Spring. The possibility 
of the basis of the differences in the speltoid-cornpactoid series 
involving an adenine: indoleacetic acid ratio cannot be excluded. 

From the arguments put forward by Phinney differences in the synthesis 
or metabolism of gibberellin-like substances may account for the 
differences in growth in the series. 

While gibberellin leads to an increase in growth, kinetin 
leads to a decrease in growth. The seedlings response to kinetin 
tends to suggest a place for kinetin in the metabolism of higher 
plants.
