CHAPTER I 

INTRODUCTION 

In the Province of Alberta during the past fex^j 
years there have been some radical changes in the system 
of education, particularly in the towns and the rural 
areas. The old one room schools are gradually being closed 
and the students are being transported to central schools. 
With the development of motor transportation and the 
building of better roads, the recently formed divisional 
boards have considered it good educational policy to set 
up larger schools to replace the one room rural type. 

This policy has made it possible for more and more rural 
students to achieve a more complete education and to 
finish their high school work while remaining at home 
with their parents. The immediate problems of the boards 
have been to build and equip central schools, to staff 
them with competent teachers, and to transport the students 
to these improved facilities. 

THE PROBLEM 

Chief among the problems of school transportation is 
that of the ownership of buses. Should the buses be 
publicly oxmed or privately owned? In the immediate past 
the divisional boards have been so concerned with building

Schools that transportation has not received much 

consideration. In the main, ownership has been 

determined by expediency, with little regard to the 

results of cost accounting or to the experience of 

others. With one quarter of the students in Alberta 

riding buses to school at a cost of over a million 

dollars a year, school transportation has now become 
1 

big business . Many boards are trying to decide 
whether to ovm and operate their o’vm buses or to use 
buses omed privately. The time seems ripe for an 
Investigation to secure evidence concerning school bus 
ownership, evidence which rests on the backlog of 
experience of operating buses in Alberta and elsewhere. 

Actually very little work has been done about 
bus ovjnershlp in the Province of Alberta. Individual 
boards are now attempting to analyse their oxvn costs 
but, so far as can be ascertained, no overall study 
embracing the whole Province has been attempted. 

It is to be expected that as time goes on the school 
divisions of Alberta will keep more detailed and accurate

records of their school buses, and that more detailed 
information will be gathered yearly by the Department of 
Education. For the present, any Investigation is limited 
by the amount of recorded evidence and by the short period 
of experience in transporting pupils in Alberta. 

It is the purpose of the vjriter to study evidence 
that is now available and to attempt to arrive at a tentative 
solution to the problem of ovmership. At present some 
boards ovm and operate some or all of their buses vihile 
other boards use only privately oxmed buses. Argimients 
are offered pro and con for each t^rpe of ox-inership. From 
tD.m.e to tim.e articles discussing the problem appear in the 
Alberta School Trustee, the official organ of the Alberta 
School Trustees’ Association. The minutes of the annual 
refresher course for school administrators point up the 
fact that the boards are vitally concerned with the 
problem of school bus ownership. Ratepayers and teachers 
also have an interest in this problem. 

This investigation has been concerned with ansi-'/ers 
to the following questions: 

1. Should school boards contract for buses, or should 
they om them? 

2. Fbiich type of ownership gives better service -with 
respect to comfort, safety, efficiency of operation? 

3* VAiich costs less? 

Ij-. I'diich is better from an adjainistrative point of viewr? 

3. hhat is the trend in oxmershlp in Alberta and 


else^There?

A REVIETy^f OP PREVIOUS STUDIES IN SCHOOL BUS 
TRANSPORTATION 

Although the main purpose of this investigation is to 
study the problem of school bus ownership in Alberta and 
to base conclusions mainly on experiences gained in this 
Province, it is considered useful,nevertheless, to dis¬ 
cover how similar problems under similar conditions have 
been solved elsewhere. In the United States, ownership of 
school buses has become a major problem, with the result 
that many investigations have been made both nationally 
and on the state or county level. A study of this litera¬ 
ture throws light on the questions with which this investi¬ 
gation is concerned. Prom theses,reports of surveys, text 
books, letters and bulletins, information has been gathered 
on the comparable costs of operating publicly owned and 
privately ovmed buses, the safety of operation, the 
administrative problems and the trend in ox\mershlp. 

Cost . Of the writers in the field of pupil trans¬ 
portation two names stand cut, A.C. Lambert and M.C.S. Noble. 
Both have written books which are now accepted as standard 

works on transportation. Mr. Lambert’s book is cited in 

2 

this thesis and a letter received from him makes his con¬ 
clusions with respect to ovmership of buses eminently clear.

In part he says: 

..••• I have written several surveys for consoli¬ 
dated school districts in Utah with the ownership 
issue in focus, .... You will find that "ownership” 
is justified, both in principle and in actual 
economy of operation, where the system is of any 
material size. I have assembled facts on the issue 
since 1932. So also have other students of the 
matter. The evidence is perfectly clear. This City 
of Los Angeles has just this year had an object 
lesson, long to be remembered, on the excessive 
costs of operating a pupil-transportation system by 
the method of private contract. Audit studies 
made by the district have shown the excess cost to 
be in the millions over a period of five years. 

The studies are not published, but they exist. I 
proved the same thing in a number of direct studies 
in Utah school districts. 

The overall conclusions relative to school bus owner¬ 
ship reached by M.C.S. Noble^ are evident from the following 
excerpt; 

Since 1925 more than a dozen highly comprehensive 
surveys have been conducted to determine the 
difference in costs which occur as the result of 
different methods of operation. Briefly summarized, 
all of these studies indicate that contract 

methods a.re much more expensive than school ownership® 

In the state of Oregon, according to Wright^, there 

are about 1500 school buses in operation, of which about 

seventy-five percent are publicly owned. He writes that 

privately oimed buses cost approximately twenty per cent 

more to operate than do publicly owned buses®

Concern5.ng the state of Iowa, Sd^ren writes that 
available fir^ures indivate that oublicly owned buses cost 
ten dollars per ounil per year less than do privately oxmed 
buses. 

Follovxing is an excerpt from a bulletin from Minnesota^ 

x•^Jhich ay. pports the above statement: 

Studies made of the comuarative costs of pupil 
transportation by privately oimed and district 
oxmed buses indicate that the conveyance of pupils 
by district oT^med buses, is more economical and 
more satisfactory. 

An extensive sunimary of research on bus ownership in 
the United States before 19l!-0 is given by Dr. Meadows of 
Montgomery, Alabama. This summary Includes reference to 
studies made in thirteen of the forty eight states to deter¬ 
mine the relative cost of privately ovined and publicly 
orned buses. In these studies, many unit costs were 
used. ■'.diere such is the case, and these unit costs are 
consistent, then the conclusion should be valid. If, 
further, various independent studies are made using various 
unit costs which all agree the conclusion is still more valid. 

That is the outcome in eight separate and independent studies 
carried out in the thirteen states and referred to by Dr. Meadows.

The states included Texas, Colorado, Arkansas, California, 

New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah, Iowa, South 
Carolina, Minnesota, Alabama. In some states studies were 
carried out by several investigators. In each case, the 
conclusion was that the cost of operating publicly owned 
buses is less than the cost of operating privately owned 
buses. 

0 

Willi amis , for example, found that in Iowa the 
median cost per pupil per year was $ 21,30 where publicly owned 
buses were used and $29.00 where privately owned buses were 
used. 

9 

Little, investigating in Arkansas, concluded that 
the average cost per pupil per mile per day was one cent 
for the publicly owned buses and one and a half cents 
for the privately owned. 

The foregoing references are Indications of what 
all investigators and authorities now state with respect 
to cost of operation of school buses. The unanimous 
conclusion is that publicly owned buses are less expensive 
to operate than are privately owned buses. No literature

2. Safety of Operation * The evidence studied with 
respect to the comparative safety of operation of publicly 
owned and privately owned buses includes reference to 
objective investigations and to the opinion of authorities. 
Noble^*^, for example, has x-'jritten: 

The author of this text after visiting rural schools 
in forty states is of the opinion that the average 
contract bus is markedly inferior to the average 
school owned bus. 

Included in Dr. Meadow^s^^ record was also a reference 
to safety of operation. He reported on a study by Poulkes 
and Beery^^ who concluded that in the state of Wisconsin 
“privately owned buses consistently fail to meet the 
equipment standards maintained by district-owned and jointly 
owned buses.” 

Meadows^^ reports in a study which he carried out in 
Alabama, that thirty-eight per cent of publicly owned buses 
were of all steel construction, while seven per cent of 
privately owned buses were of all st.eel construction.

Castafero^^ refers to some important work done by 

Engum in the field of safety of operation: 

Studies have been conducted in Minnesota and 
Oklahoma that show a greater degree of safety in 
district-ownership of school buses* In 1934^ 

Engum made a survey of school bus construction 
in sixty-nine consolidated school districts in 
Minnesota. After checking each of two hundred 
and forty five buses on the basis of thirty 
construction items, Engum found that the per 
cent of deficiencies was thirty for privately 
owned buses and eleven for publicly owned buses. 

V/rlght^^ is of the opinion that in the interest of 

safety school districts should ox^rn their own equipment. 

Edgren^^ asserts that in Iowa the inspection program 

demonstrates that school owned buses 3.re much better 

maintained than privately owned buses. 

The conclusion with respect to the comparable safety 

of operation of school buses is that publicly owned buses 

are safer than privately owned. No evidence has been 

found to the contrary. 

3. Administration . With respect to this question 

Lsjnbert^'^ writes rather boldly: 

The administrative arguments of keeping machinery 
functional to program and purpose, flexibility, 
organizational efficiency, lines of authority and 
check-up etc., are all on the one side, that of 
ownership. Of course, if the administration is

uninformed, or is unwilling to take over the 
work which is properly theirs, that is another 
matter for some local case. The thing to do 
then is to change the administration, or educate 
it* 

1 ft 

Haggerty*^ prefers public ownership on the basis of 
administration because he claims that with ownership of 
buses goes control, 

Wright claims many advantages for public oxmership 
such as having complete control of the buses, being able 
to use them for field trips, and routing them as the 
district sees fit. Problems of administration, he says, 
are- considerably lessened. 

All the writers studied show a preference on the basis 
of administration for publicly owned buses. There is an 
undercurrent of feeling throughout many of the commentaries, 
which suggest that some boards are loathe to change to 
publicly ox^jned buses because these boards believe their 
administrative problems x^^ill increase. No writer studied 
has given any sympathy to this outlook. 

Trend , It is apparent from the literature received 
that much attention has been given to the trend in school 
bus ownership. Investigators have been anxious to find out 
how the percentages of publicly oxmed and privately owned 
buses have been changing in various states.

In the state of Minnesota^^ there are more than 2?^ 
districts that own and operate one br more buses. The 
number is increasing each year. 

In Kentucky^^, ”The present trend of ownership of 
school buses is moving gradually in favor of publicly 
owned equipment.” 

In lowa^^, 95^ of the buses are publicly oraed. Pour 
years ago the figure was G0%o 

In Minnesota^^ during the past five years the trend 
has been markedly toward public ownership. 

Bergan^^ suggests a reason for the trend in Montana 
to public ownership; 

At the present time the trend is towards district 
owned school buses instead of contract buses. The 
reason for this trend probably lies in the fact 
that the school district can finance its own school 
buses easier than it can finance its contract buses. 
The length of a school bus contract in Montana is 
limited to three years and the contractor feels that 
he must pay for his bus during the first three years. 
At the end of three years the contractor hesitates 
to lower his contract. 

The Office of Education, Washington D.G, publishes a 
statistical sheet showing the number of buses in the United 
States which are publicly owned and the number privately 
oimed. For 19l4-9-50 there were 99#562 buses classified.

being privately owned and 60,020 publicly owned, 

2k 

Martin refers to a reoort on transportation in 
New York state which recoimnended that conversion to district 
ownership be encouj?aged. It emnhasized the fact that in 
1914-5? of all school buses were publicly owned. 

Any figures received relative to trend indicate that 
in the United States the percentage of publicly owned 
buses is increasing. 

With respect to the foregoing questions of cost, 
safety, administration, trend and overall efficiency we raay 
now refer to general opinions voiced by some authorities, 

25 

Noble made a general coroment concerning the preference 
of the superintendents of school. The forty-eight state 
departments of education were asked to supply lists of 
rural-school systems - approximately two-thirds of the 
superintendents declared a preference for school owned 
buses,

Culp listed advantages of publicly omied and privately 
ojned buses. His claim for the privately/- ovnied bus is that

it relieves school officials of part of the management 
responsibilities and it enables them to estimate accurately 
at the beginning of the year how much transportation will 
cost. His claim for the publicly owned bus is that it 
costs less to operate, it is easier to control, it is 
flexible to changing conditions, it can be Integrated 
with the total school program and used to enrich the 
instructional plan, it enables school officials to train 
and supervise drivers, it fits into the general pattern 
of public oxvmership of school buildings and other school 
facilities, it offers a higher standard of service and it 
is easier to maintain in a safe operating condition. 

Summary . The evidence reviex-^ed in this chapter 
indicates that the trend is toward public oi>rnership of 
school buses in the United States, There is general agree¬ 
ment among all the investigators and authorities quoted 
concerning the quality and economy of the service. The 
greatest amount of research regarding ownaership of school 
buses has investigated cost, the conclusion being unanimous 
that publicly ox\rned buses cost less to operate than do 
privately owned buses. Further, the various Investigators 
who studied the safety factor in school bus operation all 
reached the conclusion that publicly oX'jned buses are safer 
than privately oxraed buses. Also in discussing other factors 
such as service and administrative problems the. agreement is 
general that publicly owned buses are to be preferred.

■CHAPTER II 


III. 


PROCEDURE 

Each year every school division in Alberta sends to 
the Department of Education in Edmonton a record of the 
number of buses omed and the nuinber contracted, together 
with the details of pupil load, mileage and costs. These 
figures will be analyzed to arrive at unit costs to compare 
public and private buses. This analysis will cover divisions 
in the northern, central and southern parts of the province. 

More detailed evidence concerning costs and service 

given by buses will be secured by visiting the offices of 

five school divisions in Southern Alberta. These five have 

had more experience than most of the others. Three of 

them, Lethbridge, Macleod and Foremost, rank first, second 

and third in the Province for number of buses operated. 

Two of them, Taber and St. Mary’s River, rank fifth and 

27 . 

sixth . These not only have experience, but they are 
representative of both thickly populated and sparsely popu¬ 
lated districts, and of both all weather roads and dirt roads. 

In Alberta the Highway Traffic Board, which passes 
judgment on all school buses, has gathered data relevant to 
the safet 7 / and comfort o.f buses. These data which are 
representative of the whole province x^ill be used also in 
this study.

Comparisons will* be made where appropriate, between 
conditions here and in the United States and reference 
made to solutions there which might apply in Alberta. 

Reference will be made to the minutes of the Annual 
Refresher course, held each year in the province, for 
school division secretaries and others. At these courses 
the whole problem of school bus ownership has been debated. 

To arrive at a tentative solution to the problem 
certain criteria must be set up and applied. A review 
of the literature reveals that there is a general agree¬ 
ment on what these criteria should be, although some 
studies concentrate on perhaps one or two criteria while 
others use more. 

The Highway Traffic Board^°, for instance, is con¬ 
cerned only with service which they specify as safety 
and comfort, 

Lambert discusses cost, flexibility of operation 
or administrative control, and service. 

In the studies reviewed in chapter one emphasis was 
placed on trend in ownership. 

In this investigation, therefore, the following 
criteria x-^ill be applied:

CHAPTER III 

SERVICE GIVEN BY PRIVATELY OWNED AND 
PUBLICLY OWNED BUSES 

COI'-IPORT 

During the last few years there has been a marked 
improvement in the type of buses used by the divisions. 

Until recently thousands of children were riding in 
conveyances considered unsatisfactory by parents? students 
and others. Very often a half- to one-ton truck chassis 
was used, with a home-made box on the back containing tvjo 
longitudinal benches to accomraodate a dozen or more 
youngsters* Thanks to vehement opposition by the Highway 
Traffic Board and by the parents concerned, these vehicles 
are disappearing from the roads. A check reveals that in 
the divisions of Foremost, Taber, Lethbridge, Macleod or 
St. Mary's River, not one of these substitute conveyances 
is now used. No doubt other divisions are replacing them. 

However, many students ride in buses that the Alberta 
Highway Traffic Board classifies as B and C conveyances® 
Mostly, these are one-ton truck chassis with panel bodies® 
The seats usually run lengthwise. In some cases the seats 
are padded, or perhaps the ^^^indow space is increased. Aside 
from these panel bodies, there are many locally built bus 
bodies made wholly or mainly of x-^ood and usually with 
longitudinal seats.

In the main, an A class bus# is usually factory built 
with all steel body, padded cross seats, ample window space 
with safet^r glass, proper heating and ventilation. Many 
of these attributes of a class A bus make it more comfor¬ 
table than a class B or class G bus. It is m.uch more 
comfortable for instance to ride on cross seats than on 
longitudinal seats. To make a comparison, on the basis of 
comfort, of publicly oTOed and privately ox^med buses, a 
check was made of all buses operating in five school divisions 
to discover the n^umber of class A buses >jhich are publicly 
owned and privately owned.

In two of the divisions studied, Foremost and St. 
Mary’s, only privately owned buses were used. This situa¬ 
tion accounts for the larger number of privately owned 
buses and makes it necessary to use percentages to make 
comparisons as to comfort. 

Table I indicates that where publicly owned buses are 
operated a youngster has nearly three times the chance of 
riding in a bus that qualifies for the A category than he 
would have if he rode in a privately ovmed bus. 

There is a danger of minimizing the fact that some 
private operators do provide good buses. Some divisions 
are more successful than others in persuading private 
contractors to buy factory made buses. The question of 
cost enters here and will be discussed later. 

An important factor to consider in analyzing the above 
table is that the average load in a division bus is larger 
than in a private bus^^. Therefore, figured on a pupil 
basis, the percentage differences would be even greater in 
favor of the publicly owned vehicle. 

In the city of Lethbridge, one large garage owner”, 
has specially interested himself in the business of selling 
school buses. After he was v/ell started in his sale of 
school buses, he supplied the following figures relative 
to total sales he had made:

All of these buses except the panel buses were factory 
made vjith all the required attributes for a class A bus* 

That is, they had a bus^type, all steel body with padded 
cross seats. The figures indicate that private individuals 
bought more of the small type factory bus or the panel bus 
and that divisions bought panels and larger buses. In some 
areas the lighter bus is no doubt better because of road 
conditions or sparsity of population or some other factor. 
These figures show, however, that in spite of many routes 
being in areas of thick population and gravelled or hard 
surface roads where large buses could be used, private 
individuals did not buy the large buses. 

The evidence from these five divisions shows, therefore, 
that in the matter of comfort the publicly owned bus excels.

These publicly owned vehicles tend to be larger than the 
privately owned, apparently because often the private 
contractor will not purchase a large bus. Further, there 
is a larger percentage of them in the A category which 
means that they are built for the job they have to do. 

SAFETY 

Some of the elements that determine the safety of a 
school bus are:- the driver, the type of body, the age of 
the body. 

The driver ; By common consent the driver is considered 
to be the most important factor in the safe operation of a 
school bus. No bus, no matter how well constructed or how 
well maintained, is safe in the hands of an irresponsible, 
careless driver. Concerning the driver, there has been 
much, opinion offered by board members, parents and teachers. 
Cn the one hand it is said that if a driver owns his bus 
he will exercise judicious care in maintaining and driving 
it; on the other hand that a driver of a public bus does 
a better job because in the first place he was chosen and 
perhaps trained as a driver and he may easily be dismissed - 
he is completely under the control of the board. This, ^ 
however, is in the realm of conjecture - no evidence supports 
either opinion. 

No objective investigation has come to the writer»s 
attention which would substantiate the belief that there 
is a relationship between safe drivers and ownership of

buses. Until proven otherwise it may be assumed that the 
proportion of good and poor drivers is the same for publicly 
owned buses as for privately owned buses. This is an 
important observation, because if a board believes that 
good drivers and privately owned buses go hand in hand 
then that board will tend to use privately owned buses with 
their thinking based on an Incorrect premise. The same 
could be argued of course w^ith respect to publicly owned 
buses. 

School divisions where buses are publicly owned are 
often confronted with the question of the advisability of 
using high school students as drivers. Ambrose^^ made a 
study which is most useful to such school boards because 
he found that high school students may safely and economically 
be used as school bus drivers provided they are carefully 
chosen, given a definite training program and properly 
supervised. 

Meadows^^ offers an opinion relating to drivers, which 

favors the publicly owned bus; 

It is possible, through public ownership to have 
a greater number from which to select in choosing 
the school bus drivers. Not all individuals who 
would make capable and efficient drivers would be 
able to own a bus. - = = 

It has been claimed that a private owner will

take better care of a school bus than the school 
bus driver of a publicly oi^med vehicle. However, 
this claim has not been substantiated by facts. 

The type of body : Evidence concerning the type of 

body in use by divisions and private oTAjners may be found 

in a study made by the Highway Traffic Board. This Board 

Q o 

classifies buses primarily on the basis of safety-^-^. Under 
the direction of lir, G«J* Kem^^ay, Technical Advisor, Highway 
Traffic Board, a report on the school bus situation in the 
province of Alberta was written in 19l|-7. He made a detailed 
check on two hundred and ninety-seven buses, arriving at the 
figures indicated in Table III.

Because of the small number of buses, in the A category 
at that time, it is expedient to combine the A and B 
classes. It will be seen that of the publicly owned buses 
checked 69% were B or better, while of the privately ovmed 
buses l\.3% were B or better. The sample included nearly 
half of the buses in the province. 

This study by the Highway Traffic Board shows that the 
boards were operating a larger percentage of safer buses 
than were the private owners. 

No study is available concerning the age of the publicly 
owned bus compared to the age of the privately owned bus. 

The school division secretaries do not keep a record show¬ 
ing the ages of the private buses, which means that an 
investigator must interview every private bus operator to 
determine the age of his bus. An attempt to do this was 
made in the Lethbridge School Division. 

A private owner"” operates a fleet of fourteen buses 
in the latter School Division,ranging from new to fifteen 
years old. Table IV gives the data concerning the ages of 
these buses as of December, 1950.

These two tables compare the ages of only one section 
of the privately owned buses with all the publicly owned 
buses for one school division. The comparison may not, 
therefore, be completely fair to all private owners. The 
private owner was operating buses in 1935 while the school 
division has owned buses since 1937* At the date for which 
figures were obtained they had been operating seventeen and 
fifteen years respectively. It might be claimed that new 
buses are not being purchased by private operators because 
they feel insecure in their contract. In the Lethbridge 
School Division, however, the policy of the Board has been 
to use privately owned buses x^rhen they can be obtained. 

In the samples herein considered, the average age of the 
privately owned buses is three times the average age of 
the publicly owned buses. 

EFFICIENCY OP OPEMTION 

The efficiency of any school bus is dependent on factors 
already studied such as the comfort of the bus and its 
safety; but it is dependent also on the type of driver, the 
service rendered, the reliability and control of the bus 
by school authorities. 

Some of these factors are difficult to determine object¬ 
ively but it is interesting to note the opinion of the 
people closely concerned x-jith school buses. For purposes

of this Investigation opinion was gathered from eleven 
principals in the Lethbridge School Division, who have 
had experience with both publicly owned and privately 
owned buses. They administer schools ranging in size from 
four rooms to eleven rooms with an average of about seven 
rooms. Serving their schools are fifty-five buses - 
twenty five of them aimed by the division and thirty 
privately owned.

Table VI is a digest of the opinion of these eleven 
principals. There is little difference in their estimate 
of the qualities of the drivers of either type of bus; 
five of the principals see no difference. In the judgment 
of the principals, however, the public and private buses 
do differ with respect to comfort and safety. The opinion 
here is definitely in favor of publicly owned buses. 

By service is meant such things as punctuality on a 
schedule, delivering children as close to home as possible, 
protecting children from accidents in crossing roads, 
making detours when necessary, and any extra courtesy when 
called upon. The opinion of the principals in regard to 
service favors the publicly owned buses in the ratio of 
two to one. 

Reliability is concerned with a bus making its route 
day after day, in all types of weather, and arriving on 
time. The number of principals who made a choice favored 
the publicly o^med buses in a ratio of more than two to one. 

It is Interesting to note that no principal claims 
that a school board has more control over a private bus. 
Control is a vital factor in efficient operation. The 
school board at all times should be able to determine where 
a bus shall operate and how many children it should carry. 
The board should be able to determine when a bus is unfit 
for operation.

^*//hen principals were asked to make an overall choice 
of ownership, eight out of eleven preferred buses owned by 
the division* It is to be recognized that this is a small 
sample, and not necessarily representative of the entire 
province• 

Opinion was solicited also from representative rate¬ 
payers in the Lethbridge School Division. One hundred 
questionnaires'"* were circulated among the ratepayers of 
eleven central schools. Fifty three completed questionnaires 
were returned from nine of these schools. 

The questionnaire was worded in such a way that the 
opinions expressed, in order to carry weight, should come 
from people who lived in districts served by both publicly 
owned and privately oi\rned buses. Unfortunately, question¬ 
naires received from people in this category numbered only 
five. This is not a large enough sample from which to 
draw general conclusions. It is interesting, however, to 
note from Table VII that the opinions of these five strongly 
favor public ownership. 

Of the remaining forty-eight questionnaires returned, 
thirty-seven came from ratepayers who lived in districts 
where only privately owned buses were used; and eleven came 
from ratepayers where only publicly owned buses were used. 

As stated before, the wording of the questionnaire would

preclude any valid conclusions based on the detailed 
response of these forty-eight ratepayers. They lArere not 
asked if they were satisfied with their present buses but 
were asked to compare their own buses with the other type, 
but since they had no experience with these they were not 
in a position to judge them. It might be claimed, however, 
that if the ratepayer chose the kind of bus presently 
operating in his district he was satisfied; but that if 
he chose the opposite type of bus, there was an implied 
complaint.

with the above limitations and qualifications in mind 
the totals from these forty-eight questionnaires were noted. 

Of the total of thirty-seven ratepayers living where privately 
owned buses were used, sixteen gave the other type of bus 
as their overall choice, six registered no opinion and 
fifteen favored using privately oimed buses. Of the total 
of eleven ratepayers living where publicly owned buses were , 
used, one gave the other type of bus as his overall choice 
and ten favored using publicly bwned buses. 

To make a more objective study of the reliability of 
both types of buses, a check was made on bus reports in 
the Lethbridge School Division. This furnished a sample 
of data from which valid conclusions could be made as to 
reliability of operation. Every school month each driver 
presents a bus report to the secretary treasurer in the 
school division office. This bus report shows, among 
other things, the time of arrival at school each morning, 
reasons for being late and days missed and why. The bus 
reports of all seventy-three buses were checked. This 
check covered 730 separate sheets which made up the record 
for the full year from January to December of 1950. 

A digest of these reports is given in Table VIII. In 
fairness to the whole bus system of the Lethbridge School 
Division it should be noted that January and February of 1950

Average number of days missed per year per Division Bus I}.. CO 
Average number of days missed per year per Private Bus 3*54

\<iere unusually cold attj.raes and there was much snow and 
drifting snow. These figures are not, therefore, typical 
of winter bus operation in the division studied. However, 
the figures are valid for this Investigation, because both 
types of buses were subject to the same road and weather 
conditions. 

Month by month the lates x-j'ere not in the same proportion 
as the number of buses in the two categories; but over a 
period of a year they were in the same proportion, which 
indicates that reliability of operation is not dependent 
on ownership. The twenty five publicly ovjned buses 
recorded l52 lates or an average of six each for the whole 
year’s operation. The forty-eight private buses recorded 
289 lates or an average of six each for the year. 

These findings are Important to this investigation. 

Much opinion has been offered in regard to the reliability 
of operation of one type of bus as against the other. The 
check on these seventy three buses over a period of a year 
shows, hovjever, that there was no difference in these 
aspects of reliability of operation between publicly ovjned 
and privately/ ovmed buses. 

Summary . Factors which determine efficient management 
were well summarized by iir. A.P. Grant, President, Alberta 




3k 


Divisional Secretary-Treasurer's Association at their 

^ 1 

annual short course in June 

The advantage of the division owned buses may be 
summarized as follows: 

1. Better, more comfortable vehicles• 

2. More direct and efficient control by 
the Board, 

3. No haggling over changes in route, 
increased mileage, bad roads, et cetera, 

[f.. It is easier to deal with private owners 
if you have some of your own buses, 

5* Continuity of service is assured. Some 
private operators are quite enthusiastic 
for a while, then they get careless and 
lose Interest, 

6, In our area-it is difficult to interest 
people in school bus operation. This is 
probably due to the present high Income 
of the people in our area. Or it may be 
that we do not offer enough money. If 
the latter is the case it would cost us 
more to have the privately owned buses. 

The conclusion as to efficiency is that in respect to 
reliability of operation there is no difference between 
privately owned and publicly owned buses; while in respect 
to control, and popular choice the evidence favors 
publicly ow’-ned buses.

CHAPTER IV 

RELATIVE COSTS OP OPERATING PRIVATELY AND PUBLICLY 
OWED BUSHS 

As stated before, the transportation problem has 
presented itself gradually to school boards. It has been 
a necessary appendage to the problem of closing one-room 
schools and building central schools. As a result, there 
has been very little systematized cost accounting relative 
to school buses. It appears that full, complete, and 
meaningful records, showing the cost of operating public 
school buses in Alberta, do not exist. It is easy to 
ascertain what privately owned buses cost the school 
division to operate; the contractor's pay check will show 
that; but determination of the cost of operating publicly 
owned buses presents a problem. Among the items to be 
considered are capital cost, depreciation, repair bills, 
iminning expenses and driver's salary. One can read a 
financial statement of any division and discover the total 
amount spent in any year for transportation, but to make 
a comparison it is necessary to know cost per mile and 
cost per mile per student. Here the issue is clouded be¬ 
cause the total amount recorded may not include depreciation. 
Interest on debentures, or other indirect costs. 

The situation, however, is improving. School boards

are aware of the increased costs of school transportation, 
which are annual fixed charges. Accordingly some school 
boards are examining their accounts to determine hox^ the. 
best service can be given at the lowest cost* Of the five 
divisions studied for this thesis, two use only private 

buses - there is no question about their costs. The 

other three divisions, Taber, Lethbridge and Macleod, have 
both types of buses. Taber School Division is now keeping 
exhaustive records on its buses and has employed an addi¬ 
tional bookkeeper to set up and maintain a system, of 
detailed accounting of the buses (1951)* Lethbridge School 
Division is now maintaining a system of cost accounting 
and Macleod for some time has done this. This means that 
as the years go by more and more reliable figures will be 
available with which to compare the costs of public and 
private buses. 

To get a view of provincial overall averages. Table IX 
is set up. This is taken from the Annual Reports of the 
Department of Education,where figures for two years 
only were available.

From this table the Indication is that public buses 
cost less to operate than do private buses* 

Table X offers a more comprehensive picture. These 
figures were taken directly from the Annual Report of the 
Department of Education published in 1950 ^*^, They cover 
the year 194 Q» Investigators in the United States, who 
are studying the problem, are hesitant about accepting 
unit costs as a yardstick unless many unit costs are cal¬ 
culated and found to be consistent, one set with another^^. 
In Table X three unit costs were calculated and found to be 
consistent in that they are smaller in the case of publicly 
owned buses. 

It is noticeable from Table X that costs as measured 
by these three units tend to be less in divisions where 
some publicly owned buses are used than in divisions where

only private buses are used. 

Although the evidence as set out in Table X is not 
conclusive, because in some cases depreciation et cetera 
were not considered, there is an indication that unit 
costs for operating publicly owned buses are less than 
for privately owned buses. 

COSTS IN THE TABER SCHOOL DIVISION 
In 1949 # Taber School Division owned and operated 
seventeen of its thirty-eight buses. These were operated 
from the divisional garages, one situated in Taber, and 
the other in Vauxhall. The private buses served the smaller 
centres xvhere population was somewhat sparse. 

A concerted effort on the part of the Board and the 
superintendent was made here to set up an accurate cost 
accounting system. It is difficult, hovjever, with figures 
thus far available, to make a detailed breakdown of costs 
to determine the ‘difference between operating private and 
public buses. A comparison is not very meaningful because 
most of the publicly oxmed buses were larger than the 
privately owned buses, and some of these publicly oiArned 
buses made two trips each day and operated over better roads. 

With these qualifications and limitations in mind 
Table XI is presented, using figures secured from the files 
of the Taber School Division.

To arrive at these figures, the Taber School Division 
gave consideration to the following items: 

Depreciation on bus, gasoline, oil, repairs, 
driver’s salary, garage mechanic’s salary, 
main garage - heat, light, water, 
depreciation on garage, insurance on garage, 
license on bus, telephone, painting and 
insurance on bus« 

An examination of Table XI substantiates the board’s 
belief that they are saving money on those buses which 
are owned by the division* 

Table XII is offered as added evidence concerning 
cost of operation of buses. Macleod and Foremost Divisions 
are both in the South where winters are comparatively 
open; both have been opera.ting buses for some time; and 
road conditions are fairly comparable. It is apparent 
from the table that Macleod with some publicly owned 
buses is operating at less cost than is Foremost. 

An investigation was made to determine the actual 
cost of a fleet of five privately owned buses and the probable 
cost if these same five buses were publicly owned. The 
following are actual costs, as calculated by the owner 
operating five buses in the Lethbridge School Division. 

The figures x^rere submitted by the owner himself and are 
based on his experience of operating buses. If the 
Lethbridge School Division were to set up a central garage 
of its own in the city of Lethbridge, not necessarily for

storage purposes but for periodic checkups, minor and 
major repairs and overhauls, supplies of cylinder oil, 
grease jobs, et cetera, then these five buses could be 
owned and serviced by the division as is done by the 
Taber division* Items could be purchased wholesale as is 
done elsewhere; including: oil, grease, parts, tires, 
batteries, antifreeze, et cetera* 

The difference between the actual cost of operating 
five privately ox'ined buses and the estimated cost of 
operating five publicly owned buses represents a saving 
of $ 1*25 pe3? bus per day* Since the five divisions studied 
in Southern Alberta operated an average of forty-seven 
buses each, this amount represents a possible saving to 
each school division on forty-seven buses of $11,750*00 
per year. 

It may seem impractical to make a comparison xvrhich 
hinges on a division owning its own repair depot, but such 
depots are nox^ appearing in Alberta, as in Taber and 
Vauxhall, and have been used extensively In the United 
States* This practice is referred to by Dr, J*W. Gilles, 
Associate Professor of Education, University of Alberta, 
in speaking before the school division secretaries at 
their short course in June 1914.9^^. He was talking speoi-

fically of forty-five school districts in California: 

Districts owning five or more buses generally 
employed a part-time or full-time mechanic 
whose responsibility it was to service and 
repair the buses in garages owned and equipped 
by the school districts. These districts also 
generally purchased oil, grease, tires, batteries, 
and parts at the wholesale prices. 

In this same address Dr, Grilles made other remarks pertinent 

to the discussion here: 

These forty-five districts used a total of one 
hundred and eighteen buses of which ninety or 7o% 
were owned by the districts. These figures 
indicate the great popularity of district-owned 
buses, 


. It will be noticed (referring to a 

table) that the unit costs of school districts 
using contract buses are uniformly and appreciably 
higher thanthose of districts owning their own 

buses... this confirms the dictum of 

authorities in the field of pupil transportation 
that it is more economical for a district to own 
its own buses than to use contract buses. 

Abbott^^ refers to North Carolina where all the buses 

are publicly oxmed and garages are used. 

All of the one hundred counties, except one, in North 
Carolina maintain school bus garages in x^rhich is 
carried on the major portion of the school bus main¬ 
tenance program. These county garages are operated 
on a very economical and satisfactory basis. 

North Carolina is furnishing safe transportation to 
its school children at less than half the per pupil 
cost of any other state. 

There is another problem concerning costs xvlilch has 
been the topic of much discussion - capital costs. Some

school divisions decide their whole ovmership policy on 
the basis of their ability to make capital expenditure 
for buses. 

Mr. G.J. Kenway^^, Technical Advisor, Highway Traffic 

Board, has this to say in part: 

The basic factor that must be considered in 
the economy of operation is the type of owner¬ 
ship under which school transportation is 
being carried on. Opinions differ on this 
point and at the present time, particularly 
in this province, no one can as yet state 
dogmatically as to x^hlch type of ownership 
of buses should be favored. Many school 
Divisions favor the privately oxvned bus 
arrangement; on the other hand several 
Divisions o’wn and operate buses with good 
results. It would appear that the type of 
ownership that should be favored would be 
dependent upon the individual school Division's 
ability to make outlays in capital investment. 

When no further capital investment is possible 
in the immediate future, the School Division 
can make provision for adequate school trans¬ 
portation by letting out contracts to private 
individuals. However, in those Divisions 
where funds are available experience has 
shown in many parts of the United States 
that the publicly owned vehicles would be 
the most economical a^rrangement. 

At the annual short course for division secretaries 

( 1948)^2 

the problem of capital outlay for buses was dis¬ 
cussed. One delegate used it as an argument against 
public oxmership. This objection was answered by Mr, A.P. 
G-rant, the President, as follows:

I don»t care whether you buy the buses your¬ 
self or a private person buys them, in the 
end the Division pays for them. The only 
difference is that when the private operator 
buys them, the Division pays for them and the 
private operator gets them. No man is going 
to buy a bus if he isn^t over a period of 
five or six years going to get the capital 
cost of that bus back. 

The general conclusion from the experience of the 
Taber School Division and from the data from the Lethbridge 
School Division and the Department of Education must be 
tempered by the inadequacy of the records; but, neverthe¬ 
less, it is clear that publicly owned buses are operated 
at less cost than are privately owned buses. This con¬ 
clusion is in harmony with what has been found in the 
United States.

CHAPTER V 

ADMINISTRATION OP PUBLICLY OWNED 
AND OP PRIVATELY OWNED BUSES 

No matter who owns the buses, the problem of adminis¬ 
tration is a growing one. Where numbers of pupils are 
transported, additional records are essential in the 
school division offices, adding to the work of the 
secretary-treasurer. Supervision is required out on 
the routes, a task which is currently performed by the 
division trustees. 

Where school boards own and operate some or all of 
the buses there are many administrative details encountered. 
The first problem a board has with a publicly oimed bus 
is the business of purchasing and paying for the bus. 

Time is required to discuss the financing of the proposed 
bus because an adequate bus may cost as much as $8,000.00. 
Division boards at present are finding themselves in 
financial difficulties because of rising costs Including 
that for transportation. As a rule buses are purchased 
out of much needed current revenue. Regardless of how 
they pay for them, time and deliberation are required 
concerning such matters as the size of bus required, the 
type of body, the motor and chassis. Often the board 
and secretary, either collectively or individually, do 
a good deal of shopping around and looking over various

types of buses before purchasing* The Highway Traffic 
Board has prescribed the rules for general construction 
of a good school bus. Keeping within these rules the 
board buys a bus which is suitable in size for the number 
of children on the route and for the type of road over 
which it must travel. There are such things as dual or 
single wheels to be considered also. 

After the purchase is made, a suitable driver must 
be secured. It takes a man with a keen sense of respon¬ 
sibility who will try to look after a piece of expensive 
equipment which is not his own. He must be somewhat 
mechanically inclined so that he can do minor repairs 
and attend to the servicing of his bus. He must be in¬ 
dustrious enough to rise early every school morning and 
make his route regardless of the weather or road condi¬ 
tions. He must be capable of maintaining discipline in 
his bus. He should be living on the route in order to 
prevent waste mileage on the bus. All these things the 
sub-division trustee has in his mind when he looks around 
for a potential driver. 

The trustee plans the route having due regard for 
the location of the bus driver, of the location of the 
children and of the roads to be travelled. 



52 


Every morning of school, the driver checks in his 
load of children. In the Lethbridge School Division this 
checking means that the driver or teacher enters on a 
record sheet the time of arrival and the nujniber of students 
carried. At the end of the month the principal of the 
school checks over the bus report to see that times, days 
and loads are recorded properly; then he signs the report 
for the bus driver who submits it to the secretary-treasurer 
prior to payraent by check. 

If the driver should need repairs for the bus, he 
gets an order from the trustee or from the secretary and 
proceeds with his purchase. Everything that is bought 
except gasoline and oil usually requires permission and 
results in a book entry in the division office, llie 
divisions of Taber, Lethbridge and Macleod and probably 
many others, now keep a separate and full account on each 
bus, which purports to show every dollar spento 

During the surmier vacation the decision must be made 
relative to any m.ajor repairs or repls-cements needed, 
such as a complete m.otor overhaul or a new motor. There 
can be no set policy as to motor requirements, because 
different buses operate under different road conditions 
and different lengths of routes. 



53 


The trustee ordinarily investigates complaints 
about the operation of the bus. Perhaps it is not running 
on a time schedule, perhaps too often it misses a certain 
section of the route where the road is muddy or snowbound. 
Usually the bus driver is paid by the day, and if he buys 
his own gas and oil, which is the case in the Lethbridge 
School Division, he does not feel Inclined to use too 
much gas on a particularly bad road. The trustee som.e- 
times has to deal with the other extreme where a bus 
driver will drive the bus over a road which endangers 
the safety of the children or may seriously harm his bus. 
perhaps his most disagreeable task is that of reprimanding 
a bus driver or even asking him to relinquish his contract. 
The driver may be a former friend or business associate. 

In rural areas everyone knows everyone else and the trustee 
is foremost in this regard. 

These, then, are some of the adrainlstratlve problems 
connected with a publicly owned bus system. Some of these 
problems present themselves when a private bus is used, as 
for Instance, when a bus is purchased. With the present 
high cost bf equipment the prospective private bus operator 
is somewhat hesitant about investing his money. Boards 
have trouble pursuading a man to invest his money in the

type of bus that will meet the requirements of the Highway 
Traffic Board and will be large enough economically to 
serve a given territory. Tables I to V present evidence 
that publicly owned buses are generally more adequate than 
are privately ovmed buses. 

Another problem, common to both is the competency and 
honesty of the driver. In the case of the private operator 
it is a lesser problem because it is not incumbent on the 
division to authorize the use of the bus for any private 
or extra-curricular work. Nor is it the trustee^s concern 
as to how roughly the bus is used so long as it is kept 
repaired and in a safe condition. The driver may still 
constitute a problem. He must be personable enough to 
maintain good order and good spirit in his bus. He must 
be co-opera.tive, such as when a cha.nge in route becomes 
necessary, or extra driving is required because of im¬ 
passable roads. A driver might be over solicitous about 
his equipment with the result that he does not cover his 
full route when the road is not in good condition. The 
whole problem is not so great with a private bus because 
it is only the driver that presents a problem and not 
trie bus, provided it is a good one. The secretary does 
not have to keep a running record showing capital cost, 
depreciation, repairs to body, repairs to engine and 
running gear, replacements such as batteries and tires. 

Nor does he have to scimitlnize every garage bill for 
validity and proper signature.

Under ideal conditions, where a good driver buys a 
good bus and the route is planned, the administrative 
problem almost vanishes. Once a month the secretary is 
called upon to sign a pay check. This is a very im¬ 
portant consideration for it saves much time both for 
secretaries and for trustees. It is only natural to 
expect, that because of this and other problems mentioned, 
that some school divisions favor private ownership. Many 
of course have been forced into some public ownership or 
have voluntarily tried it and nox>r realize the advantages-- 
they are willing to suffer the extra office and field work.. 
To quote Mr. A.F. Grant^^ again: 

The big obstacle I see to the division owned 
buses is all the work in the office, and as 
a secretary I am definitely against that, but 
if you are going to give the people service 
that is the way you x->7ill have to do it. 

A.G. Lambert^^ in coromenting on administrative problems 

has this to say: 

On educational grounds and from the stand¬ 
point of flexibility in operation of the 
system, the case for district ownership is 
very clear. Where the amount of service 
is small or new systems are not very exten¬ 
sive, the contract method is often better. 

But for large systems, and as a long-time 
policy, district ownership and m.anagement 
is the better method.

citizens and school administrators are 
coming to see that educational service 
together with economical use of public tax 
money is more Important than contentment of 
local contractors or the convenience of 
School Boards, who wish to escape some of 
the problems incident to ownership and 
management of the transportation system* 

Probably the time will come in the Province of 

Alberta when the business of transporting students to 

school will be integrated under one transportation director 

in Edmonton, and the details of administration will be 

looked after by local transportation managers* This of 

course will radically change the present situation, as 

outlined in this chapter, where trustees and secretaries 

are called upon to carry out many duties connected with 

publicly owned buses*

CPIAFTER VI 


TREND IN OWNERSHIP 

As was pointed out in chapter two, the students of 

transportation in the United States have been watching 

the trend in school bus ownership very carefully on the 

assumption no doubt that any school authority is interested 

in what other school authorities are doing with respect to 

ownership of buses. To further exemplify the study of 

trend the following is quoted from E. Glenn Peatherston, 

a recognized authority on school transportation: 

The general conclusion is that publicly- 
owned transportation facilities result in 
a better and more economic transportation 
program if all other things are equal. 

That this is a generally accepted fact is 
indicated by the fact that there has been a 
change in the United States in the last 
ten years from about I|.0% public ownership 
of school buses to over 60 % public owner¬ 
ship. I feel sure that this trend will 
continue and that in another ten years 
there will be a relatively small number of 
privately owned school buses in this country. 

The advantages of public ownership are 
most fully realized when large fleets are 
operated by a single unit. If a school is 
to operate only a single bus, the advan¬ 
tages of public ownership might be out¬ 
weighed by some of the disadvantages. It 
is my conviction that when a school operates 
as many as three buses that the advantages 
of public ownership outweighs the disadvantages.

The above writer was kind enough to forward a copy 
of a speech^^ he made in which he attempts to explain the 
reasons for the trend in favor of public ownershlpo 
Briefly his reasons are as follows: 

1 . There is no problem of negotiating annually one 
to two dozen contracts with the owners of your school 
buseso There is no such thing as a formula which will 
give a just contract price for all bus routes* 

2. School administrators may lay out or change bus 
routes without consultation with a contractor. 

3. Buses may be used for legitimate purposes to con¬ 
tribute to the instructional program. 

V. There is control over the kind of driver and over 

his actions. 

5. On the average one should find better discipline 
on a school omed bus. 

6. In a number of studies the school-owned buses have 
been found to be in better condition than those privately 
owned. 

7. There is no doubt that economy will result from 
public ownership. 

This writer in the same pamphlet discusses ways of 
making public buses cost less than private buses. He 
puts emphasis on the fact that a private contractor wants

interest on his investment plus something for management* 
With the school Board it is a non-profit proposition. He 
calculates that a school system operating a fleet of forty 
buses could save $23^500.00 annually* 

This is a much more ambitious figure than that 
estimated on the five buses*''” studied herein* If it were 
valid for Alberta it would represent a saving of roughly 
one half a million dollars annually, provided all buses 
were publicly owned. Of course, the economy is presented 
as only one phase of the argument* 
li/hat is the trend in Alberta? 

In 1947 the Department of Education started publish¬ 
ing the totals of publicly owned and privately owned 
buses^7, jri 19I4.7 there were 697 buses in Alberta, I38 
or 20^0 owned by the Boards. In 1950^^ there were ll56 
buses in Alberta, 296 or ZG% owned by the Boards* To 
state it another way: Between 1947 and 1950 there were 
459 more buses put into service; of these l58 were 
division owned. That means about one-third of the ne^^^ 
buses were publicly owned* 

The figures also show that in 1947 twenty-one 
divisions owned one or more buses; in 1950 thirty-four

divisions owned one or more, an Increase in divisions 
of 614.^. In 1947 thirty-nine divisions contracted one 
or more buses while in 1950 fifty-two divisions contracted 
one. or more, an Increase of 33^ in the number of divisions. 

Thus, Insofar as figures for a three year period can 
be used as an indication, the trend in Alberta is toward 
publicly owned buses.

CHAPTER VII 

CONCLUSIONS 

To answer the question, ^^Should school buses be 
publicly or privately owned?", the following criteria 
have been examined: 

Service (Including comfort, safety, efficiency) 

2« Cost 

3. Administration 

I}.* Trend in ovmership 

1* Service . The sample of data used and opinion 
gathered indicate that publicly o\med buses offer more 
comfort than do privately owned buses. 

Studies on safety of operation in the United Sta.tes, 
the investigation made in Alberta by the Highway Traffic 
Board, and opinion gathered all agree that publicly owned 
buses are safer than privately owned. 

In the evidence used from the Lethbridge School 
Division reliability of operation is not dependent on 
ownership. Opinion of authorities in the United States 
and opinion of a sample of school principals and rate™ 
payers indicate a preference for publicly o\med buses 
because with ox^ership goes complete control which they 
feel improves efficiency* 

2. Cost* All evidence studied from the United States

and from Alberta is unanimous in claiming less cost for 
operating publicly owned buses than privately owned. 

3. Administration . The body of opinion points up 
the apparent fact that publicly owned buses entail more 
office work for the secretary and more field work for the 
trustee. Authorities quoted and opinion gathered show, 
nevertheless, a strong preference for publicly ox^^ned 
buses. They claim that the benefits accruing from public 
ownership far outstrip any disadvantages resulting from 
extra routine work. 

Trend . The trend in ownership in the United 
States and in Alberta is towards publicly owned buses. 

The conclusion reached by the writer, therefore, on 
the basis of the literature studied from the United 
States and the data gathered from the Province of Alberta, 
is that the school authorities should tend toward ownership 
of school buses.

CHAPTER IX 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

To supply factual data for future investigation into 
school bus ownership, and to improve the school transpor¬ 
tation system the follox^ring recommendations are offered: 

1. That all school boards keep an individual record 
on each bus owned, showing such items as make, size, 
description of bus body, original cost, depreciation, 
repair record, running expenses, route and mileage, 
driver’s wages, load carried, cost per day, cost per mile, 
cost per student mile. 

2. That a record be kept of privately owned buses 
showing such items as make, year, size, description, 
contract price, load carried and unit costs as above. 

3. That all divisions oxxrning buses explore the possi¬ 
bility of setting up their own bus garages. 

4. That, school boards give consideration to the 
advisability of purchasing some buses every year and tend 
more and more toward public ownership. The results of 
this study show that there are definite advantages 
accruing from public ownership. 

5. That the Department of Education appoint a senior 
official as a director of school transportation. 

6. That the divisional boards employ a transportation 
manager to supervise the buses of one or more school divisions.

AREAS FOR PURTPIER RESEARCH 


I'here appears to be a need for fu]&ther study in the 
field of school transportation in Alberta. ’while owner¬ 
ship of buses ranlvs among the important problems that 
confront school boards, in the course of this study many 
other questions arose which it was not possible to 
investigate within the limits of this thesis. 

The following are some of the areas where further 
research would be of value: 

Cost of operation . To what extent have cost 
accounting systems been instituted b^r boards'? Ehat 
type of records are kept? VJhat type of records should 
be kept? Could divisions form a co-operative to purchase 
buses, repairs and supplies? How do divisions arrive at 
the amount paid to private operators of school buses? 

Administration of school bus systems: hhat 
provision is made for periodic checks on the condition of 
buses? Do any divisions have a driver training program? 
VJhat use is made of buses for extra-curricular activities? 

3* School bus garages . l/Vhat are the details of 
operation of these garages? Vdiat are the arguments in 
favor of using them? Hox%r large should they be? How many 
garages are required by one school division?

APPENDIX A 


SPECIFICATIONS FOR A, B AND C BUSES^^ 

BY HIOOTAY TRAFFIC BOARD 

Onp definition under the ”A" classification is as 
follows; 

In general, a class "A^' bus is one which incorporates 
most or all of the salient features required in a school 
bus for the regulations of tlie Highway Traffic Board with 
particular consideration being given the following: 

1. General Desi gn, The design must be such that the 
vehicle is well suited for use as a school bus. Materials 
used must be strong enough to withstand great impact in 
case of collision or overturning. Design and construction 
must meet the approval of the Inspector. 

As yet, we have not made any rigid specifications 
as to the technical requirements concerning the strength 
of the materials that are to be used. For example, we 
have not specified the size of the channel steel or 
other material to be used in making the framework. Like¬ 
wise, we have not specified the gauge of sheet steel 
that is to be used in coating the bus. All we specify is 
that the materials used must be capable of withstanding 
great impact. In general, however, it is to be expected 


49 

C.So Kenway, Report on School Vans , Highway 
Traffic Board, Edmonton, Alberta. 







69 


that class "A" buses of the highest grade should be of 
all-steel construction. 

2. Pro vision s for Suitable Entrance, Ex i t and 
Eme rgency Ex it. Entrance doors must be located toward 
the front of the vehicle and on the right-hand side, under 
the direct control of the driver. Emergency doors may be 
located either at the middle rear or toward the rear on 
the left-hand side, must open on a vertical hinge and 
be equipped with a safety latch. Design and dimensions 
of these doors must be in accordance v/ith the require¬ 
ments of the regulations. There must be provided a suit¬ 
able step leading into the bus. 

Adequ ate Seating . Forward-facing seats preferred 
in the larger type of bus, although longitudinal seats may 
be allov/ed in some instances. Seats to be adequately 
cushioned and upholstered, properly spaced, with adequate 
aisles, including emergency aisle of a minimum ?/idth as 
specified. 

Adequate Lighting . Sufficient window space to 
give the driver a complete and clear view of the interior 
of the bus in daylight hours. Wlndoxvs to lower not more 
than 12 Inches. All glass used to be safety glass. Wind¬ 
shield to be of lamina-ted safety plate glass to prevent 
distortion of view and to be sloped to cut down refraction 
of light.

5. Suitable Heat inp^ and Ve n tilation , Buses to be 
lined inside with suitable material and heated with hot 
water heaters. No exhaust or gas heaters allowed. Ven¬ 
tilations according to minimum in the regulations. 

6. Safety and Emerge ncy Devi ces . Buses to be equipped 
v/ith suitable flares, fire extinguishers, reflectors at 
rear, clearance lights when over 80 inches wide, at least 
one STOP light four inches or more in diameter and an 
adequate First Aid Kit. Yie are also making a provision 
for the carrying of a short-handled axe for emergency 
purposes. Directional signals are required in some cases. 

• Mechanical Fitness . All school buses must be 
mechanically efficient and up to the standards generally 
required of all motor vehicles under the Vehicles and 
Highway Traffic Act. 

Means o f Identification . School buses must be 
painted a chrome yellow color and trlmined v/lth black. 
Proper signs identifying the school bus must be displayed 
on both the front and the rear. 

CLASS '*B” BUSES 

Requirements for this class are much along the lines 
stipulated under the ”A*' class with this exception that 
somewhat lower standards of material and ?/orlimanship may 
be present. This class Includes largely the locally made 









71 


buses, used road buses converted to school buses, all 
panel trucks equpped as school buses, and up to the 
present we have been including station v/agons in this 
class* 

CLASS BUSES 

Tills class is reserved especially for the very small 
unit, particularly one used only temporarily and one that 
cannot feasibly be required to comply with the requirements 
of trie two senior classes. This class includes all 
passenger cars regardless of whether they are brand new 
or used*
