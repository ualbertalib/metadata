STUDIES ON THE CHEMICAL SEED TREATMENT 


OF GRASSES 


Jack Gilbert Grimble 


INTRODUCTION 


Historical Review 


Four general methods of control of plant diseases 
are recognized, viz. exclusion, eradication, protection, 
and immunization* Seed treatment may be either an eradica- 
tive or protective measure, or both. The organic mercury 
dusts, for example, are both eradicants and protectants. 

The history of seed treatment extends back as 
far as the latter part of the 17th century when the brining 
method for the control of bunt of wheat was accidentally 
discovered. Since then, other materials besides common 
salt, such as lime, saltpetre, and wood ashes, have been 
used. However, it was not until 1761 that an intelligent 
application of chemical seed treatment was made. Schulthuss 
(23, 25, 27) suggested the use of copper sulphate in place 
of common salt for seed treatment purposes. It was not 
generally used, however, until after 1858 when Kuhn (23, 25, 
27) made definite recommendations from the results of his

extensive experiments. This treatment, although controlling 
bunt of wheat, was found to cause considerable seed injury. 
This disadvantage was partially overcome when the treated 
seed was dipped in a lime solution. 

In 1895 Geuther (23, 25) in Germany, and in 1896 
Bolley (23, 25) in the United States, advocated the use of 
formaldehyde for the prevention of cereal smut diseases. 

It soon replaced copper sulphate and became quite popular 
due to its cheapness and effectiveness. Its main disad¬ 
vantage was that, while controlling covered smuts of cereals, 
it tended to injure the seed rather seriously. Even today 
it is, perhaps, the most widely used chemical for the treat¬ 
ment of seed grain in western Canada. 

In 1902 Von Tubeuf (23) introduced the first 
successful dust fungicide in the form of copper carbonate 
dust. It was not, however, until 1915, following success¬ 
ful experiments made by Darnell-Smith (23, 25, 27) in 
Australia, that it came into much prominence. Five years 
later Maokie and Briggs (23, 27) introduced it to the 
United States. Advantages, such as ease of application and 
non-injurious action on seed, which this treatment seemed 
to h8ve over other treatments at once placed it in the fore¬ 
front. It is still used today in many places as a standard 
treatment for the control of bunt of wheat. 

Kellerman and Swingle (27) tested mercuric chloride, 
a powerful bactericide, for the treatment of cereal grains

but without success. This apparently was the first time a 
mercury compound had been used for seed treatment. Hiltner 
(27) found that it was valuable for the control of Fusarlum 
disease of rye and a number of preparations such as 
"Fusariol" and "Fusafine n containing mercuric chloride were 
marketed. About 1912 mercuric chloride, because of its 
highly poisonous properties, was being replaced for phar¬ 
maceutical purposes by organic mercury compounds. Such 
compounds were found in medicine to combine high efficiency 
in destroying bacteria and spores with little or no tendency 
to injure body tissue. Those interested in seed treatment 
problems were naturally attracted by the properties of this 
new group of compounds, and V/esenberg (23, 27) was the 
first to suggest the use of such chemicals as seed fungi¬ 
cides • 

Martin (27) points out that, "true organo-mercury 
derivatives are those in which the mercury atom is attached 
direct, by one or both valency bonds, to carbon atoms. The 
general structure of those derivatives found as the active 
constituents of seed disinfectants is R.Hg 0 X. where R rep¬ 
resents a hydrocarbon with or without substituent groups, 
and X represents an acidic radical". 

The first person to use an organic mercury com¬ 
pound for seed treatment was Riehm (23, 25, 27) who carried 
out extensive tests with chlorophenol mercury and reported 
successful control of bunt in 1913. This compound is a

chemical combination of mercury and carbolic acid, suitable 
for use only when dissolved or suspended in water. It was 
marketed in Germany under the trade name "Uspulun”, and in 
1921 a similar compound called "Chlorophol" was sold in the 
United States. 

Numerous other compounds, mostly for liquid treat¬ 
ment, were experimented with but failed to attain commercial 
success because of inconsistent effectiveness, seed injury, 
or excessive cost. 

Organic mercury compounds for dry seed treatment 
were first tested experimentally in the United States in 
1922, about ten years after Riehm t s first work. In 1924 a 
commercial compound called "Uspulun Dry Dressing” (a mer- 
curized nitrophenol compound) was manufactured in Germany, 
and a similar compound called "Semesan” appeared in the 
United States in 1925. Other dust compounds such as 
Germisan (cresyl mercuric cyanide), Bayer Dust (hydroxy- 
mercurinitrophenol sulphate), Sterocide (mercury furfura- 
mid), Semesan Jr. (hydroxymercuricresol), Semesan (hydro- 
xymercurichlorophenol sulphate), and Merko (5.5% metallic- 
mercury in an inert filler) were also used to a consider¬ 
able extent. 

Further impetus was given to the seed treatment 
investigations by the introduction of alkyl and aryl mer¬ 
cury salts. These were many times more efficient as 
fungicides, against the smuts of wheat, oats, and barley,

than the original mercurated phenols. This group contains 
such commercial products as "European" Ceresan (phenyl 
mercury acetate), Agrosan G. (tolyl mercuric acetate), 
"American" Ceresan (ethyl mercury chloride), Standard Ley- 
tosan (methyl mercury nitrate), Leytosan P (methyl mercury 
phosphate), £ oz. Leytosan (methyl mercury carbamide), 

New Improved Ceresan (ethyl mercury phosphate), and Luna- 
san (ethyl mercury thiourea). 

The use of suoh compounds, although very effi¬ 
cient at first, was very expensive as the recommended rate 
of application was two to three ounces per bushel but, 
upon further study, some of these compounds such as Ceresan 
were found to be volatile, giving off germicidal vapours. 
Because of this fact it was found that such a volatile 
fungicide could be applied at one-half ounce per bushel and 
still be effective. The cost of seed treatment with these 
organic mercury compounds was thus reduced, permitting 
them to be used more extensively. 

In the development of organic mercury compounds 
there has been a marked decrease in the metallic mercury 
content. The original compound "Uspulun" contained 18.8$ 
metallic mercury, while later ones such as "Ceresan" con¬ 
tain only 3.8$ metallic mercury. This indicates that the 
fungicidal properties are not all due to the metallic mer¬ 
cury content as has been demonstrated by Dillon Weston and 
Booer (6).

At present there are, on the market in Canada, 
three organic mercury dusts commonly used for the treat¬

Lunasan. Information on the composition et cetera, of 
these and other preparations used in these studies is

Objects of the Investigations 


These investigations were conducted in order to 
determine the effects, both beneficial and injurious, of 
oertain fungioides on some of the grass seeds* The prin¬ 
cipal objects were to determine: 

1. The effeot of chemical seed treatment on 
germination and disease prevention in lawn 
and forage grasses 

2. The relative injurious effects of different 
organic mercury dusts on wheat 

3. The relative reactions of different varieties 
of wheat to treatment with an organic mercury 
dust. 

THE EFFECT OF CHEMICAL SEED TREATMENT ON GERMINATION 
AND DISEASE PREVENTION IN LAWN AND 
FORAGE GRASSES

ant functions we might develop methods of treatment of seed 
other than disease preventing measures, which would add

materially to the crop yield of the country and to the 
national wealth”.--Harrington (17). 

Many grasses are known to have inferior germina¬ 
tion which presents a difficult problem for agronomists. 

The methods now used to inorease germination are chiefly 
of a mechanical or physical nature, such as scarifying the 
impermeable seed coat or membrane, and the use of alternat¬ 
ing temperatures. Toole (42) was successful in germinating 
Kentucky blue grass seed by alternating the temperatures 
daily during the period of germination. Hite (21) found 
that Canada blue grass, without light or alternating 
temperatures, germinated only 25%, and Kentucky blue grass 
60%. She found that alternating temperatures were benefi¬ 
cial for both and that light was essential for Canada blue 
grass germination. Hulless timothy seed is also known to 
have very poor germination. Goss (13), for instance, 
showed that it germinated 17% less than the hulled seed 
and that 72% of the seed tested was hulless, which indicates 
the seriousness of the problem. Newton and Ficht (32) also 
mention a similar problem in the production of timothy in 
Alberta. 

The use of chemicals has apparently had little 
or no part in the attempt to promote germination of grass 
seed. In official seed testing laboratories, a 2% potas¬ 
sium nitrate solution is often used to promote germination. 
Apart from this, there appears to be little available

literature on the effect of the use of chemicals for the 
purpose of improving the germination of grass seed. 
Chippindale (2) in 1934, noticing the marked beneficial 
effect of seed treatment with Ceresan in the case of 
cereals in practical agriculture, thought it advisable to 
determine exactly the action of this substance on grass 
seeds since the germination of the latter in the field is 
often unsatisfactory. He experimented with indigenous 
cocksfoot ( Dactylis glomerate ), tall fescue ( Festuca 
elatior ). and red fescue ( Festuca rubra), and found there 
was no evidence of stimulated germination. However, he 
concluded that the application of Ceresan to grass seeds, 
previous to their being sown in the field, might often be 
markedly beneficial in practical farming, the value of 
such application being that it would protect the seed 
during unfavorable germinating conditions. 

Weimer (43) treated seeds of Kentucky blue grass 
and timothy with indolebutyric acid and found no stimulat¬ 
ing action. She pointed out, however, that even the most 
lethal poison can be used as a valuable therapeutic agent 
if taken at the proper time in the proper dosage, and that 
indolebutyric acid may be just such a potential chemical. 
Incidentally, no reference was found in which favorable 
effects of chemical seed treatment on the germination of 
timothy seed were cited. 

However, there are reports of chemical treatment 
of the seed of perennial grasses for the control of disease.

Fraser and Soott (12) found that the use of formaldehyde 
would control smut ( Ustilago bullata Berkeley) of slender 
wheat grass ( Agropyron pauclflorum Sohweln. Hitchc.) but 
that copper carbonate dust would not. The same pathogen 
also causes a smut of prairie grass ( Bromus unlololdes ) 
which Morwood (30) claimed is effectively controlled by 
applying abavit B or Ceresan at the rate of three ounces 
per twenty pounds of seed. Smut was reduced from 83.5$ 
to 0.1$ by such treatments. He also found that formalde¬ 
hyde effectively controlled the smut but that it reduced 
the germination as well. Henry et al (20) found that smut 
(U. bullata ) of slender wheat grass could be effectively 
controlled by the use of organic mercury dusts applied at 
the rate of one-half ounce per bushel. 

Preliminary Experiments 


Experiment I 

Seed of several lawn grasses was available in 
the laboratory, having been obtained previously from a 
commercial seed house. It was necessary, at the outset, 
to determine the percentage germination of these samples 
of seed. 

Methods 

The seed was sown on the top of sand of optimum 


moisture content in 9 cm. Petri plates. There was a single

at room temperature with plenty of light available. Ger¬

It will be observed that the seed samples of Poa 
and Festuca species are very low in germination, especially 
the Poa species. Kentucky blue grass, because of its low

attempt to inorease the germination by chemical seed treat¬ 
ment. Kentuoky blue grass is a common component of lawn 
and pasture mixtures, but it is sometimes difficult to get 
established due to its low germination. 

Experiment II 

This was a preliminary experiment to determine 
the effect of organic mercury dusts on the germination of 
Kentuoky blue grass. 

Methods 

The organic mercury dusts, Ceresan, £ 02 . Leyto- 
san, Leytosan P, and Lunasan, were diluted with talc to 
give a 2% concentration of the active ingredient in each 
case. The dusts were applied in excess and the surplus 
removed by means of a fine silk screen. The treated seed 
was then allowed to stand for 24 hours prior to sowing. 

The treatments were in quadruplicate and the seed was sown 
under the same conditions as in Experiment I. Notes were 
taken on the germination each week for six weeks and the 
germinated seeds removed. At the end of this period, notes 
were also taken on the number of mouldy seeds present. 

Results 

The percentage germination and percentage mouldy 
seeds are given in Table II.

The results show that the organic mercury dusts 
at 2$ concentration did not increase the germination but, 
on the contrary, appear in each case to have seriously 
injured the seed. This is no doubt due to the excess 
application of dust and shows that the concentration of the 
active ingredient in the dust used was too great for this 
method of treating or that the dust should be applied in 
smaller quantities. The interesting point of the experi¬ 
ment, however, is the reduction of the number of mouldy 
seeds in the treated lots. This indicates that if the 
dusts were applied at the proper concentrations and rates, 
there might be a beneficial effect on germination. This 
would be especially likely in the case of unfavorable ger¬ 
mination conditions, as pointed out by Chippindale (2).

Experiment III 

This was an experiment to determine the effect 
of various chemicals on the emergence 5 * 1 of Kentucky blue 
grass in sterilized and unsterilized soils. 

Methods 

The same treatments were used as in Experiment 
II, plus sulfanilamide at four concentrations: 5, 10, 20, 
and 100$. The dusts were applied in the same manner and 
the seed left for 24 hours before sowing. The seed was 
sown in six-inch pots containing a three to one black loam- 
sand mixture. One-half of the pots were sterilized prior 
to sowing, for eight hours at fifteen pounds steam pressure, 
while the other half were left unsterilized. The treat¬ 
ments were in quadruplicate, randomized, and the pots 
placed on a greenhouse bench at ordinary greenhouse tem¬ 
perature. The pots were placed in large galvanized trays 
and watered from the bottom to avoid disturbing the seed. 
After seven weeks, notes were taken on the emergence. 

Results 

Table III presents the emergence for the various 
treatments, and Table IV shows the variance for emergence. 


In these studies "emergence" means that the seed 
has been covered and that the seedling appears above the 
ground level, while "germination" means that the seed has 
not been covered and the seedling appears directly.

are beneficial in the unsterilized soil. The lower emer¬ 
gence percentages and greater variability found in the 
sterilized soil are due to the fact that the sterilized 
soil did not take up water very readily. The differences 
due to treatments were not significant because the very 
high mean square of the interaction was used in determining 
the F value. The results obtained with Ceresan, i oz. 
Leytosan, and Lunasan in the unsterilized soil show definite 
increases in emergence over the check, but not so in the 
sterilized soil. The only treatment to show definite in¬ 
creases in emergence in both the sterilized and unsterilized 
soil was that made with sulfanilamide 5%. This is interest¬ 
ing in view of the therapeutic action of sulfanilamide in 
medicine. 

Experiment IV 

This was an additional test to determine the effect 
of various chemicals on the emergence of Kentucky blue grass. 

Methods 

These were similar to those of Experiment III 
except that only unsterilized soil was used. The formalde¬ 
hyde treatment consisted of dipping the seed, held in small 
cheese-cloth bags, into the formaldehyde solution for two 
minutes, then draining and covering for four hours before 
drying and sowing. The seed was sown in small cardboard 
boxes containing a three to one black loam-sand mixture.

The differences due to treatments are significant 
beyond the 1% point, which is due to the fact that in nearly 
every case the seed was severely injured, and consequently 
the emergence lowered. The action of sulfanilamide in this 
experiment is the reverse of that in the previous experi¬ 
ment and cannot be explained. 

The Effect of Various Concentrations of Ceresan, 

Applied at Different Rates, on the Emergence 
of Kentucky Blue Crass 


In the preliminary experiments, an attempt was 
made to use organic mercury dusts diluted with talc to 2% 
of their active ingredients, applying them in excess so 
that each seed was covered. This proved unsatisfactory as 
it generally caused severe seed injury. It was, therefore, 
decided to increase the number of concentrations by dilut¬ 
ing with varying amounts of talc and applying the dust at 
definite rates.

Methods 

Ceresan was diluted with talo to give concentra¬ 
tions of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5$ ethyl mercury phosphate, whioh 
is the active ingredient. The seed was then treated at the 
following rates: one part dust to 50, 100, 300, 600, and 1000 
parts of seed for each of the above concentrations. There 
was also an untreated check and a check using talc alone at 
each of the above rates. The treatment of the seed was done 
in 10-gram lots, in 200 cc. rubber-stoppered Erlenmeyer 
flasks. The seed was left 24 hours before counting into 
lots of 100 seeds each, and then sown in small cardboard 
boxes containing a three to one black loam-sand mixture. 

The treatments were quadruplicated, randomized, and the 
boxes pieced on a greenhouse bench at prevailing greenhouse 
temperatures. To eliminate border effect as much as pos¬ 
sible, a row of extra boxes was placed all round the outer 
edge of the group of experimental boxes. After four weeks 
notes were taken on the emergence. 

Results 

The summary tables are presented in Appendix I 
and the variance for the emergence data is given in Table 
VII.

of Ceresan on the emergence of Kentucky blue grass. There 
are, however, some treatments that do show a beneficial 
effeot over both the untreated check and the talc check, 
the talc check being the 0 % concentration. 


The Effect of Chemical Seed Treatment on the Control of 
the Leaf Spot and Foot Rot Disease of Kentucky Blue 
Crass Caused by Helminthosnorium vagans

ized by the production of numerous lenticular lesions on 
the above-ground parts of the plants, particularly on the 
leaves* In badly infected areas the plants may die due to 
the parasite girdling the plants at the base or foot, cut¬ 
ting off the flow of nutrients* This is termed foot rot. 
The disease is quite common and may be serious on fairways 
of golf courses or on lawns where close and frequent clip¬ 
ping is the common practice* It is common in this locality 
but is usually not destructive. 

Methods 

The parasite Helminthosnorium vagans was isolated 
from diseased plants of Kentucky blue grass found on the 
University campus. The pathogenicity was checked by 
inoculating Kentucky blue grass plants in pots in the green¬ 
house. These plants later showed leaf spot and foot rot 
symptoms. The inoculum for this experiment was produced 
on a medium consisting of black loam soil plus 10% cornmeal. 
This inoculum was produced in 200 cc. Erlenmeyer flasks, 
each containing 50 grams of the air-dry soil-cornmeal 
mixture plus 27 cc. of tap water. These flasks were steri¬ 
lized for two hours at 15 pounds steam pressure, and the 
contained medium then sown with Helminthosporlum vagans 
from potato dextrose agar slants. The fungus was allowed 
to grow for approximately three weeks at room temperature, 
by which time the mycelium had completely penetrated the 


substrate

The pots in which the seed was to be sown were 
sterilized for eight hours at 15 pounds steam pressure. A 
three to one black loam-sand mixture was used. The seed 
was treated with Ceresan at the concentrations and rates 
which appeared to be most beneficial in the previous experi¬ 
ment. The pots were divided into two groups; one half were 
infested with the fungus and the other half left as a check. 
Inoculum was placed at seed level in the pots and added at 
the rate of 25 grams per pot. The treatments were in 
duplicate and randomized. The pots were then placed on a 
greenhouse bench with ordinary greenhouse temperatures pre¬ 
vailing. After three months, notes were taken on the number 
of surviving plants and also on the number of diseased 
plants. A plant was considered diseased if it showed any 
lesions or signs of foot rotting. 

Results 

Table VIII presents the percentage survival and 
percentage of diseased plants recorded.

The results show that Ceresan, at the concentra¬ 
tions and rates used, does not effectively control the leaf 
spot and foot rot disease of Kentucky blue grass. Some of 
the higher applications, however, seemed to increase the 
percentage survival of plants in the inoculated series, 
particularly 3$ Ceresan applied at the rate of 1-100.

The Effeot of Various Concentrations of Ceresan 
Applied at Different Rates on the Emergence 
of Crested Wheat Grass ( Agropyron 
cristatum (L.) Beauv•) 


Methods 

The same methods as for the similar experiment 
on Kentucky blue grass were used. The seed was taken from 
the 1940 crop which had just been threshed. After four 
weeks, notes were taken on emergence. 

Results 

Summarized tables of the percentage emergence are 
presented in Appendix II. Variance for the emergence data 
appears in Table IX.

are not significant. The interaction of concentrations x 
rates is not significant, so there is no beneficial effect 
of Ceresan on the emergence of crested wheat grass. There 
is, however, a slight benefit from the diluent alone, that 
is the talc. The fact that the seed had been only freshly 
harvested and threshed may account for the low emergence 
figures and also explain why the Ceresan tended to reduce 
the emergence regardless of concentration or rate applied. 

The Effect of Various Concentrations of Ceresan 
Applied at Different Rates on the Emergence 
of Hulled and Hulless* Timothy Seed 
( Phleum pratense (L.)) 


Methods 

The methods were the same as for the experiment 
with crested wheat grass, except that the hulled and hulless 
seeds were separated after treatment and sown separately. 
Emergence notes were taken two weeks after sowing. 

Results 

Hulless seed : The summary tables of the percent¬ 
age emergence are presented in Appendix III. The variance 
for the emergence data appears in Table X. 


* In these studies the term ’’hulled” describes seed 

which has retained the protective hull (lemma and palea) 
and ’’hulless” describes seed which has lost this protective 

hull.

The differences due to concentrations are not sig¬ 
nificant, while the differences due to rates are significant 
beyond the 1% point. The interaction of concentrations x 
rates is highly significant* The mean square for the inter¬ 
action was used in calculating the F values rather than the 
mean square for error. From these results, it appears that 
there is a beneficial effect produced by Ceresan on the 
emergence of hulless timothy seed and that the rate of 
application is a far more important consideration than the 
concentration used. There is serious seed injury when the 
dust is applied at the higher rates. The application of 
talc alone increased the emergence on the average approxi¬ 
mately 12%.

The differences due to concentrations are not sig¬ 
nificant, while the differences due to rates and the inter¬ 
action of concentrations x rates are both highly significant, 
particularly the latter. There is a marked beneficial 
effect produced by the Ceresan on the emergence of hulled 
timothy seed, although severe injury occurs at the higher 
rates of the stronger concentrations. Talc apparently has 
a beneficial effect over the check lots, but the differences 
are not significant. 

These results, for both hulless and hulled timothy 
seed, were analysed on the basis of percentage emergence. 
According to Clark and Leonard (3) this is not considered 
to be statistically correct as it tends to give false 
results. They suggest that data such as these, which show 
large differences, should be converted to the sine of the 
angle 0. This conversion reduces the differences by increas¬ 
ing the size of the smaller values and by reducing the size

of the larger values. For this reason it was thought 
advisable to carry out this conversion on these data and 
determine the effect which it might have on the analysis. 
It was important to know this as most of the data pre¬ 
sented in this paper were taken on a percentage basis. 

The percentages were, therefore, converted to the sine of 
the angle © from tables given by Bliss (1). The variance 
for the converted emergence data appears in Table XII for 
the hulless, and in Table XIII for the hulled seed.

Comparing Table X with XII, and Table XI with 
XIII, it will be seen that the differences are slight and 
unimportant. The interaction of concentrations x rates in 
the oase of the hulled seed has been reduced by the conver¬ 
sion, but it still remains highly significant. 

On the basis of the above comparisons, it was 
decided that nothing would be gained by converting all the 
percentage data into the sine of the angle 0, since the 
percentage figures in this experiment show more variability 
than in any others. Hence, if conversion to the sine of 
the angle 0 is unnecessary here, it should be still less 
necessary in the other experiments. 

The Effect of Various Concentrations of £ oz. Leytosan 
Applied at Different Rates on the Emergence of 
Hulled and Hulless Timothy Seed 


Methods 

The fungicide used here, namely, £ oz. Leytosan, 
was diluted with various amounts of talc to obtain concen¬ 
trations of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4$ methyl mercury carbamide, 
the active ingredient. The methods were similar to those 
used in previous experiment on timothy. 

Results 

Hulless seed ? The summary tables of the percentage 
emergence figures are presented in Appendix V. The variance 
for the emergence data is given in Table XIV.

The differences due to concentrations and to rates 
are significant beyond the 1% point while the interaction 
of concentrations x rates is barely significant at the 5$ 
level. The application of § oz. Leytosan produced an 
increase in the emergence of hulless timothy seed, and in 
no case was there severe seed injury. Talc did not increase 
the emergence over that of the check lots. Appendix V 
indicates that 4% £ oz. Leytosan applied at the rate of 
1-50 parts per weight of seed is the best treatment.

The differences due to concentrations and to 
rates are not significant hut the interaction of concentra¬ 
tion x rates is highly significant. There is thus a 
beneficial effect produced by £ oz. Leytosan on the emerg¬ 
ence of hulled timothy seed. There is some seed injury 
produced when the stronger concentrations are applied at 
the higher rates. Treatment with 2% concentration of £ oz. 
Leytosan applied at the rate of 1-100 parts by weight of 
seed gave best results. The application of talc gave a 
slight increase in emergence over that of the check lots.

tested, it was ohosen for this experiment. The seed was 
treated with 3% Ceresan at the rate of one part dust to 
300 parts of seed, because this treatment had produced the 
greatest inorease in emergence in previous tests. The 
seed was sown in Petri plates containing black loam soil 
at optimum moisture, 100 seeds per plate. There were also 
check plates. The treatments were replicated five times, 
and the plates were placed in constant temperature cabinets 
maintained at the following temperatures: 10, 15, 20, 25, 
and 30°C. Although thermostatically controlled, the 
temperatures of the cabinets were checked daily during the 
time of the experiment, which was approximately ten days.

data are presented in Appendix VII. The variance for the 
emergence data is given in Table XVI. The results are also

The differences due to treatments are signifi¬ 
cant beyond the Vf> point, which was expeoted from previous 
results. The differences due to temperatures are not sig¬

is significant beyond the 5# level. Therefore, the treat¬

THE RELATIVE AMOUNT OF SEED INJURY IN Y/HEAT 
CAUSED BY VARIOUS ORGANIC MERCURY DUSTS 


Introduction 


w The aim in seed disinfection is to kill all 
disease infection and at the same time not injure the 
vitality of the seed. The perfect seed disinfectant has 
not yet been found, but important advances in that direc¬ 
tion have been made in recent years".(23) 

Within the past fifteen years there has been a 
marked shift from the use of liquid to dust fungicides for 
seed treatment purposes. Organic mercury dusts have found 
most favor as seed fungicides within the past ten years. 
This has been particularly noticeable since the development 
and adoption of volatile mercury dusts. One of the advan¬ 
tages claimed for organic mercury dusts is that they cause 
a minimum of seed injury, and often improve emergence. 
However, a number of cases have been reported in which con¬ 
siderable seed injury occurred from the use of organic 
mercury dusts. 

In 1932 Rabien (37) reported that farmers using 
abavit B, a mercurial fungicide, in a certain German dis¬ 
trict, had suffered losses due to seed injury. Neill (31)

in 1934 found that when Ceresan was applied at forty times 
the normal rate, germination was practically inhibited. 

New Improved Ceresan also applied in excess caused severe 
seed injury, but not as great as Ceresan. The application 
of superphosphate tended to reduce the injury. Later 
workers also reported seed injury oaused by Ceresan. 

Crosier (4), on testing a sample of Marquis wheat which 
had been treated with Ceresan and stored for a year, found 
that many of the kernels germinated abnormally. On the 
basis of 300 seeds, 51$ were abnormal—13 %> developing short, 
thickened roots, 34 %> very mishapen plumules and roots, and 
4$ failing to germinate. Work carried on at the Geneva 
experimental station (8) showed that Ceresan, when applied 
to moist wheat seed, commonly caused abnormal germination, 
at least 50$ of the seeds being so weakened that the seed¬ 
lings consisted of short, clubbed roots and plumules. 

Seed treated with Ceresan or New Improved Ceresan 
and stored even for a week resulted in some depression in 
yield, and longer storage resulted in still greater injury, 
in tests made by Koehler in Illinois (23). Similar results 
were obtained by Hanna in Manitoba, especially when the 
moisture content of the seed was high (16). MacDonald (26) 
treated normal wheat seed at 3, 6, and 42 times the regular 
rate, with Ceresan and Agrosan G. The latter gave only 
slight reduction in germination, while the former reduced 
the germination approximately 50$ at the highest application.

New Improved Ceresan, according to Porter (35), oaused 
severe seed injury to barley, sorghum, and corn* 

Reports of seed injury caused by treatment of 
seed with organic mercury compounds led to investigations 
on the nature of such seed injury. In 1938 Noll (33), 
working in Uruguay, found after intensive histological and 
cytological studies that the abnormalities resembled those 
due to the application of colchicine. The tumor formation 
found in the coleoptiles and roots is induced by hyper¬ 
trophy of the existing cells rather than by an increase in 
their number. These giant cells contain from two to eight 
nuclei and are nearly always present in the outgrowths. 
Similar results were reported by Sass (38) in corn. In 
this plant the leaf primordia undergo extensive thickening 
and develop irregular crenations and lobes. Cell division 
in both the leaf primordia and apical meristem is inhibited 
and extreme enlargement of the existing oells takes place. 
The cells of the hypertrophied organs become multinucleate, 
containing nuclei ranging from minute micro-nuclei to 
polyploid giant nuclei the number of chromosomes of which 
may exceed two hundred. Kostoff (24), working with five 
species of wheat and rye, was able to double the number of 
chromosomes by germinating the seeds in 0.5 to 1% Granosan 
(ethyl mercury chloride) solutions for three to six days. 
Studying the abnormal seedlings, he found abnormal mitosis 
similar to that induced by colchicine and acenaphthene,

namely, failure of (rather abnormal) achromatic figures, 
ohromosome multiplications, multinuoleations, and forma¬ 
tion of large amoeboid nuclei. 

The object of the present work was to determine 
whether there was any seed injury oaused by the organic 
mercury dusts commonly used in western Canada for treating 
seed wheat and, if so, under what environmental conditions 
it would occur. It was necessary to determine this since 
a study of the varietal reaction to seed injury oaused by 
organic mercury dusts was contemplated, and a suitable 
fungicide was needed. 

General Methods 


The seed was placed in 200 cc. Erlenmeyer flasks, 
closed with rubber stoppers. In order to promote seed 
injury, the seed was raised to approximately 14 % moisture 
before treating. After 24 hours the seed was treated with 
an organio mercury dust at the following rates: 0, 1, 

li, 2, 2-je, and 3 ounces per bushel. The flasks were then 
tightly stoppered and left for 24 hours before seeding. 

In the greenhouse the seed was sown in small 
cardboard boxes, 4-§-” x 3 3/8” x 1J-", containing either 
sand or a three to one black loam-sand mixture. Each box 
was sown with 25 healthy, normal seeds at a depth of three- 
quarters of an inch. The treatments were randomized and

replicated five times. The seeded boxes were placed on a 
greenhouse bench with ordinary greenhouse temperatures pre¬ 
vailing. To prevent the outer boxes from drying out, a 
row of boxes was placed round the outside as a border. In 
two weeks’ time, notes were taken on emergence, plant height, 
and number of injured seeds. 

In the field, the seed was sown at the rate of 
200 seeds per rod row, with a border row on each side. The 
seed was sown at a depth of about 1-J- inches in rows 9 inches 
apart. The treatments were randomized and replicated five 
times. When the plants were mature, a foot was trimmed off 
each end of the centre row to eliminate border effect, and 
the rest of the row was then harvested and wrapped with 
cotton cloth. Notes were taken on emergence and yield. 

The results were analysed by Fisher’s method (10) 
as described by Goulden (15) and the level of significance 
was determined by means of Snedecor’s table for values of 
F and t (40). 

Experiment I 

Methods 

A variety of wheat, Regent, was treated as indi¬ 
cated under General Methods, with each of three organic 
mercury dusts—Ceresan, ■§• oz. Leytosan, and Lunasan— and 
sown in sand in the greenhouse. The treatments were not 
randomized so the results could not be analysed statis¬ 
tically by Fisher’s method.

Results 

The summary tables showing emergence, plant 
height, and the number of injured seeds, are presented in 
Appendix VIII. Figure III illustrates graphically the 
effect of the treatments on emergence. The plants were 
also measured and the average height for each box, as well 
as the number of injured seeds per box, was noted. These 
figures, on the whole, gave a much better index of the 
effects of seed treatment on wheat than did the emergence 
alone. The same trend is shown by each of the measurements 
but together they give the most complete picture. 

The striking thing about this experiment is the 
effect Ceresan has upon the seed, especially when overdoses 
are used, as compared with the effects of the other two 
dusts. However, an increase in the percentage emergence 
occurred for each dust when applied at the recommended 
rate. The increase in height brought about by £ oz. Ley- 
tosan and Lunasan is probably due in part to the fertiliz¬ 
ing effect of these compounds, as well as to their fungi¬ 
cidal effect. In general, the results indicate that, when 
overdoses were used, Ceresan caused more seed injury than 
■§- oz. Leytosan or Lunasan. It was, therefore, decided to 
use Ceresan in future experiments to determine the relative 
responses of different wheat varieties to treatment with 
an organic mercury dust.

Experiment II 

This experiment was conducted in an effort to 
determine the aotion of the various organic mercury fungi¬ 
cides under field conditions. The methods of preparing 
the seed were the same as for the previous experiment. 

Results 

The summary tables containing the percentage 
emergence and yield data are presented in Appendix IX. The

was not the oase in the greenhouse experiment. It appears 
then that seed injury does not necessarily occur if the 
treated seed is sown in the field under favorable condi¬ 
tions .

Yield : The differences due to dusts, rates, and 
the interaction of dusts x rates are not significant. 

This would indicate that there was insufficient seed injury 
to reduce the yield. The general trend is towards an in¬ 
crease in yield from the treated seed. 


Experiment III 

This experiment was designed to check the contra¬ 
dictory results obtained in the two previous experiments. 
Methods 

The variety, Regent, was treated in the same 


manner as before and sown in both sand and a three to one

each treatment was divided by the average emergence for the 
check boxes in the case of each fungicide.

aotions are significant especially dusts x rates, which 
shows that there is a differential response. The differ¬ 
ent dusts react differently for different rates and also 
different media. The different rates used reacted dif¬ 
ferently with the different media. Ceresan is the only 
one of the three dusts to cause any seed injury, but it 
will be noticed that the injury does not occur until the 
rate of application exceeds one ounce per bushel. The 
other fungicides—£ 02 ♦ Deytosan and Lunasan—tend to in¬ 
crease the emergence at all rates of application. The 
beneficial effect of treatment is much more apparent in 
soil than in sand. This is no doubt due to the greater 
number and variety of microorganisms present in the soil 
which interfere with the untreated seed.

Height : The differences due to dusts and media 
are significant, the latter beyond the Vfo point. The first 
order interactions dealing with rates are significant, 
showing that the different rates behaved differently for 
the different media and also for the different dusts. The 
fact that the plants growing in the soil are significantly 
higher than those in the sand is obviously due to the pre¬ 
sence of a greater nutrient supply. The results for height 
are essentially the same as for the emergence data. 

The Effect of Temperature and Moisture on the Seed Injury 

Caused by an Organio Mercury Dust 

The study of the problems of seed treatment is 
not complete without a study of the effects of soil tem¬ 
perature and moisture. The contradictory results obtained 
in the greenhouse and in the field might be explained on 
the basis of these factors. Dickson (5) reported that an 
increase in soil temperature up to 28°C increased the rate 
of germination. Above this, both the germination and the 
rate of germination decreased rapidly. This was much less 
noticeable in the treated seed, and there was less growth 
of moulds. He found soil moisture was not a limiting 
factor in the germination of wheat, except at the very high 
and low moisture levels. All treatments except formalde¬ 
hyde, unless severe, increased the germination at all soil 
moistures used. Formaldehyde reduced the germination,

especially in the dry soil. 

Supper (41) claimed that the type of soil and the 
water content of the seed bed exercised virtually no in¬ 
fluence on the action of Ceresan, abavit B, or Tutan (mer¬ 
curial compounds). Kirchhoff (22) maintained that, generally 
speaking, a low soil moisture content (20# of water-holding 
capacity) resulted in greater injury to germination than a 
high one (80# of water-holding capacity) and a combination 
of low temperature and low soil moisture was particularly 
unfavorable for seed treated with Ceresan. Rabien (37) 
found seed injury to occur in wheat with abavit B when seed 
was sown in a cold chamber 0 to 3°C. However, no such 
injury followed treatment of the seed with Germisan or 
Tillantin R. 

Methods 

Seed of the variety Regent was treated as out¬ 
lined under General Methods. The boxes were waxed to pre¬ 
vent changes in moisture content which might result from 
absorption or drainage. Each box contained 250 grams of a 
three to one black loam-sand mixture, 150 grams under the 
seed and 100 grams covering the seed. The boxes were 
divided into three lots and made up to soil moisture con¬ 
tents of 18.6, 30.0, and 35.5#, based on oven dry soil. 

After this, a third of the boxes at each moisture level 
were placed in each of three cabinets having the following 
temperatures, 15, 20, and 25°C. For each moisture level,

at each temperature, there were three treatments, viz., 

0, i, end 3 ounces per bushel of the fungicide Ceresan. 

The moisture content of the boxes was cheoked each day by 
weighing each box and adding water when meeded. However, 
after five days, it was thought that 18*6% moisture was 
not sufficient to germinate the seeds, so the moisture level 
was raised to 25$. These boxes were not watered again until 
the moisture content fell below the original level of 18.6$. 
After ten days notes were taken on the emergence and plant 
height. 

Results 

The summary tables for the percentage emergence 
and height are presented in Appendix XI. The variance for 
emergence and height data appears in Tables XXI and XXII, 
respectively. The results are illustrated in Figures VII, 
VIII, IX, and X.

Emergence : The differences due to temperature and 
moisture are not significant. The differences due to rates 
are highly significant. All the first order interactions 
are highly significant, which indicates differential res¬ 
ponse of temperatures, moistures, and rates, i .e. differ¬ 
ent moisture levels and different temperatures have differ¬ 
ent actions on the different rates of application, also 
different moisture levels react differently at different 
temperatures. These results show that temperature and 
moisture have no consistent effect on the seed treatment 
of wheat, but that there is a differential response of 
rates to both temperature and moisture. The best germina¬ 
tion and the least seed injury occurred at the 30% mois¬ 
ture level for each temperature. Figure X shows the 
marked increase in emergence and height as well as the 
uniformity of the recommended rate over the check.

Height ; The differences due to temperatures, 
moisture levels, and rates are all highly significant, 
while the first order interactions are not significant. 
This is the exaot reverse of the emergence data. The 
second order interaction is significant beyond the 1 % 
point, showing the differential response and the varia¬ 
bility of the height data. The significant influence of 
temperature and moisture levels shown in the height data 
is natural because it is known that increased temperature 
and moisture under normal conditions, up to a certain 
limit, increase the growth of a plant. The insignificant 
differences due to the first order interactions show that 
the various treatments behaved alike under all conditions 
of temperature and moisture. 

THE RELATIVE REACTIONS OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES 
OF WHEAT TO TREATMENT WITH AN 
ORGANIC MERCURY DUST 


From the information and results obtained in the 
preceding study, it appeared that Ceresan caused seed in¬ 
jury when applied to moist seed in overdoses. The problem 
now was to determine whether there was any difference in 
varietal reaction to treatment with Ceresan.

Introduction 


Winkelman (44) in 1932 deemed it advisable to use 
three cereal varieties in seed treatment studies, in order 
to exolude irregularities due to a "special constitution" 
of the seed. Skaptason (39) in 1935 and Leukel (25) in 
1936 reported that the extent of formaldehyde injury varies 
with the different varieties of grain used. Little atten¬ 
tion has been given to varietal reaction of wheat to seed 
treatment with organic mercury dusts. Fischer e_t aJL (11) 
working with wheat in 1938 reported that some varieties 
differ significantly in their sensitiveness to treatment 
with organic mercury dusts. In Canada, Mead (28) suggested 
"the possibility that some varieties of wheat are less 
easily injured by seed treatment than others is being 
investigated". 

Varietal Reaction of Wheat to Ceresan as 
Affected by Seed of Different Years 


Seed from two consecutive years, 1938 and 1939, 
was used to determine the varietal reaction. The seed was 
obtained from the Cereal Division of the University of 
Alberta and had been grown in the same experiment at the 
same station each year. The tests were carried out a year

apart, each time several months after harvest. The varie¬ 
ties in the 1938 test were Reward, Marquis, Red Bobs, 

Garnet, Renown, and Regent and in the 1939 test the same 
varieties, plus Thatcher and Sikora, were used. Marquis 
is the oldest of these varieties and has, until recently, 
occupied the largest part of the 7/heat acreage of western 
Canada. Red Bobs, Garnet, and Reward are next in point of 
age and constitute a fair proportion of the wheat acreage. 
Garnet and Reward are rapidly being replaced but Red Bobs 
is increasing in ponularity, especially in Alberta. 

Thatcher, Renown, and Regent are of comparatively recent 
origin and are increasing in popularity due to their 
resistance to stem rust. Of these, Thatcher is the most 
widely grown, particularly in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. 
Sikora is of importance here only as an experimental variety. 
The methods were the same in both cases and were carried 
out as outlined in the General Methods of the preceding 
investigation. The experiments were made in sand, as it 
has been shown previously in these studies that seed injury 
is much more apparent in sand than in soil, chiefly because 
the protective effect of the organic mercury dust is not 
operative to the same extent as in soil. 

Results for 1938 seed 

The summary tables are presented in Appendix XII. 
The variance for the emergence and height data is shown in 
Tables XXIII and XXIV, respectively.

Differences due to varieties, rates and varieties 
x rates in both emergence and height are significant beyond 
the 1 % point. This shows that there is a difference among 
the varieties tested in their reaction to seed treatment with 
Ceresan. Marquis and Renown in this case are the extremes the 
former being the most resistant and the latter the most suscep¬ 
tible. The resistant varieties are Marquis and Red Bobs; the 
susceptible, Regent and Renown with Reward and Garnet intermediate

in reaction. It should be noted, however, that all varie¬ 
ties showed increased emergence and height when the 
recommended rate was used. The increases are small due to 
the faot that the experiment was carried out in sand, where 
the protective effect of the fungicide is not operative to 
the same extent as in soil. 

Results for 1939 seed 

The summary tables are presented in Appendix 
XIII. The variance for the emergence and height data 
appears in Tables XXV and XXVT, respectively. Figure XI 
presents graphically the extremes represented by the 
varieties, Thatcher, resistant and Regent, susceptible. 

The height data in this experiment are based on the average 
emergence in the check boxes. The total height in centi¬ 
metres for each box in each treatment is divided by the 
average emergence for the check boxes of that particular 
variety.

The differences due to varieties, rates, and 
varieties x rates for both emergence and height data are 
highly significant. This again shows that different varie¬ 
ties react differently to seed treatment with organic mer¬ 
cury dusts. The varieties Marquis, Red Bobs, Thatcher, and 
Sikora are resistant to seed injury while Regent and Renown 
are susceptible. Reward and Garnet are still intermediate 
in reaction. The results also show that seed injury occurs 
only at the higher rates of application and that both 
emergence and height are increased at the recommended rate 
of application. 


Varietal Reaction of Wheat to Ceresan 
as Affected by Storage 


A similar experiment, as outlined above, using 
treated grain left over from the 1938 seed was stored for a month 
in stoppered flasks at room temperature. It was thought that

The differences due to varieties, rates, and 
varieties x rates in both emergence and height data are 
highly significant. This shows rather conclusively that 
there are significant differences between varieties in 
their reaotion to seed treatment with Ceresan. The rela¬ 
tive placing of the varieties according to their reaction 
is the same as for the previous experiment. The recom¬ 
mended rate of application has slightly decreased the 
emergence and height. It seems advisable, therefore, when 
moist grain is treated, to sow the seed as soon after 
treatment as possible. 

Varietal Reaction to Ceresan under 
Field Conditions 


Having obtained conclusive results in the green¬ 
house, it was considered important to determine the rela¬ 
tive reaction of the varieties under field conditions. The 
methods followed were similar to those given under General 
Methods for field experiments. The seed was from the 1939 
crop, and the tests were carried out at two points, Edmonton 
and Castor.

The differences due to varieties, rates, and

nificantly increased by treatment with Ceresan.

Yield 

The differences due to varieties and rates are 
highly significant, while the interaction of varieties x 
rates is not significant. The varieties, therefore, 
according to the yield data, behave alike at the different 
rates of application. The rate averages of Appendix XV 
show that the recommended rate of treatment increases the 
yield significantly.

This was a small experiment, using only Marquis 
and Regent, which had proved to be representative of the 
extremes in reaction in previous experiments. The summary

Yield 

The differences due to varieties, rates and 
varieties x rates are not significant. The results show, 
therefore, that there is no varietal difference in reaction 
to seed treatment with Ceresan under the field conditions 
obtaining in this experiment. The trend, however, is for 
increased emergence and yield, with no evidenoe of seed 
injury from any application of the organic mercury dust 
used. 


Varietal Reactions of Wheat at Different Seed 
Moisture Levels to Seed Treatment with Ceresan 
and Formaldehyde under Field Conditions 


Since all previous experiments both in the green¬ 
house and in the field were conducted with moist seed, it 
was deemed advisable to compare moist with normal seed. 

At the same time, it was thought that a comparison of an 
organic mercury dust with formaldehyde might lead to some 
interesting results. The methods were similar to those 
outlined under General Methods except that normal as well 
as moist seed was used. The formaldehyde treatment con¬ 
sisted of dipping the grain in the formaldehyde solutions 
for two minutes, draining, covering for four hours, and 
then drying at room temperature before seeding. The con-

varieties x moisture levels, and moisture levels x rates 
are significant beyond the 5# point. This shows that the 
varieties and rates reacted differently at the different 
moisture levels. The second order interaction, varieties 
x moisture levels x rates, is barely significant, which 
indicates that there is considerable variation in the 
percentage emergence throughout the experiment. These 
results would no doubt be changed considerably if the num¬ 
ber of varieties and moisture levels had been increased. 
The small number of degrees of freedom makes it almost im¬ 
possible for them to be significant. The emergence is 
increased significantly in every case.

Yield 

These results agree very closely with those of 
the emergence except that the second order interaction of 
varieties x moisture levels x rates is not significant, 
which indicates that there was less variability in the 
yield data. The summary tables show that the yield is con¬ 
siderably increased and, in many cases, significantly.

great that the F value far exceeds the 1 % point. The only- 
interaction that is significant is the interaction of 
varieties x moisture levels, which shows that the varieties 
reacted differently to the different moisture levels. From 
other results (19) less seed injury would be expected for 
the moist seed but this was not the case, the injury being 
greater than for the dry seed. There is no varietal resist¬ 
ance to formaldehyde injury as shown by this test, which 
is in oontrast to Skaptason’s results (39). This is pro¬ 
bably due to the difference in the length of time of the 
treatment. In this experiment the seed was dipped in the 
various formaldehyde concentrations for two minutes, 
drained, oovered for four hours, and dried, while Skaptason 
(39) dipped the seed for only fifteen seconds in the various 
concentrations. The significant point is the marked injur¬ 
ious effect of formaldehyde, as shown by the emergence data, 
as compared with the non-injurious effect of Ceresan.

Yield 

The differences due to rates are highly signifi¬ 
cant, and those due to moisture levels are barely signifi¬ 
cant. None of the interactions is significant, showing 
that both varieties behaved alike under the different rates 
of application at the different moisture levels. The 
important point is the significant reduction in yield at 
the recommended rate.

DISCUSSION 


The application of Ceresan to seed of Kentucky 
blue grass in an effort to control the leaf spot and foot 
rot disease proved unsuccessful. The reason for this was 
that the inoculum was added to the soil instead of to the 
seed. This was necessary because the pathogen, Helmin - 
thoscorium vagans, does not fruit readily in culture. 
However, if the disease is naturally seed borne, then the 
treatment might be beneficial. 

The increase in emergence of the treated hulled 
and hulless timothy seed over that of the check is impor¬ 
tant when it is considered that a good deal of the com¬ 
mercial timothy seed is hulless. For example, the sample 
used in these studies was graded as No. 2 grade, No. 1 
purity, with approximately 47$ hulless seed. The fact 
that the hulless seed responded to a much greater degree 
to seed treatment than did the hulled seed compares with 
the results obtained in the seed treatment of cereals. 

For instance, wheat responds better to treatment than does 
either oats or barley; also hulless oats responds much more 
than hulled oats to seed treatment. 

In this case it appears that the treatment of the 
hulless seed replaces the protective effect given by the 
lemma and palea in the case of the hulled seed. However,

there still remains a possibility that besides the protect¬ 
ive effect of the fungicide there might be a stimulative 
effeot. This has never been proved adequately, in fact, 
the majority of the evidence appears to point to the pro¬ 
tective rather than the stimulative effect. 

It is quite evident from these studies that dif¬ 
ferent grasses respond differently to the same treatment. 
This would indicate that further work should be done, using 
as many different grasses as possible in order to deter¬ 
mine their reaction to chemical seed treatment. It is 
quite possible that one chemical might produce a greater 
response than another, which would mean that a large num¬ 
ber of chemicals should be experimented with. 

Common talc, which is usually considered to be 
an inert material, appeared to increase the emergence of 
both hulled and hulless timothy seed as well as crested 
wheat grass seed. This is the opposite of Youden's (45) 
findings while working with powdered growth promoting sub¬ 
stances mixed in talc. He found that the emergence of 
treated wheat and soybean seed was reduced, and attributed 
this to the detrimental effect of the talc. 

Temperature in these studies had no consistent 
influence on the seed treatment of hulless timothy seed. 
This, however, is far from conclusive evidence and much, 
more extensive work needs to be done. Even in these results,

the maximum emergenoe for the different treatments occurred 
at different temperatures. It is suggested that further 
experiments he conducted to include different grasses and 
treatments over a wide range of soil temperatures and 
moistures. 

The results show that the organic mercury dust, 
Ceresan, is more injurious than 2 oz. Leytosan or Lunasan 
when applied in overdoses to moist wheat under greenhouse 
conditions. The margin of safety in concentrations is at 
least 100$. The field tests, which proved contradictory 
to the greenhouse results, show that there is little danger 
to wheat from the organic mercury dusts tested, even when 
applied in overdoses to moist seed. These results agree 
with those recently published by Dillon Weston and Brett 
(7). 

The effects of temperature and moisture were not 
consistent enough to explain the contradictory results 
obtained from the greenhouse and field. However, the fact 
that the least seed injury occurred at a moisture level of 
30$ based on an oven dry soil, is a plausible explanation. 
The seed in the field experiment was sown under very favor¬ 
able conditions for germination and growth. The soil 
moisture taken about the time the seed was sown was 
approximately 30$, based on an oven dry soil, which cor¬ 
responds with the moisture content of the soil in the

controlled greenhouse test. It is difficult to say whether 
seed injury resulting from organic meroury dusts would he 
serious in the field if growth conditions were unfavorable. 
On the basis of the controlled soil temperature and mois¬ 
ture test, it appears safe to conclude that there would be 
no seed injury at the recommended rate of application. One 
of the most interesting findings from the controlled soil 
temperature and moisture experiment was that the greatest 
beneficial effect with the organic mercury dust Ceresan 
was obtained under high temperature and low moisture soil 
conditions. As a contrast it has been shown that under 
low moisture conditions formaldehyde produces its greatest 
injury to the seed (18). 

Although the results of the greenhouse experiments 
show conclusively that there are differences in varietal 
reaction of wheat to Ceresan, such differences are only 
apparent under very abnormal conditions, e.g. when over¬ 
doses are applied to moist seed. The same is true, but to 
a lesser degree, for the field experiment as indicated by 
the emergence data of Appendix XV, It is, therefore, pro¬ 
bable that with normal seed, treated at the recommended 
rate, under average field conditions, such differences in 
varietal reaction would not occur. 

One of the more important points brought out by 
these experiments with organic mercury dusts is that when 
the recommended rates are used and the seed is planted

immediately following treatment, there is no seed injury. 
However, there is a danger of seed injury occurring if the 
treated moist seed is for any reason kept too long in 
storage, as has been previously reported by Hanna (16) 
and Koehler (23). 

The beneficial effect of using organic mercury 
dusts on healthy seed is well brought out in Tables XXXVII 
and XXXVIII and in Figure XIV.

The above table shows the results of treating 
wheat with different amounts of Ceresan under greenhouse 
conditions. The figures were obtained from four experi¬ 
ments containing eight different varieties and consisting 
of twenty replicates. It shows definitely an increase in 
emergence and height at the recommended rate of applica¬ 
tion, as well as the margin of safety.

wheat with different amounts of Ceresan under field condi¬ 
tions. The figures were obtained from four experiments 
containing eight different varieties, carried out at two 
different stations and comprising nineteen replicates. 

This table shows that under field conditions there was a 
consistent increase in both emergence and yield for all 
applications. These results are shown graphically in 
Figure XIV. 

It is known that formaldehyde causes considerable 
seed injury to wheat. This is well illustrated in the rate 
averages of Appendix XVIII. At the recommended rate of 
1-320, the emergence is reduced 18% and the yield is 
reduced 8.5 bushels per acre. However, if we compare the 
rate averages of Appendix XVIII with those of Appendix 
XVII, which are the results of the Ceresan rates from the

same experiment, the difference between the emergence 
values is 29% and between the yield values is 14 bushels 
per acre at the recommended rates of application. This 
almost doubles the loss which a farmer may experience if 
he uses formaldehyde rather than Ceresan. 

There still remains the possibility that, under 
field conditions adverse for germination, the results 
might be entirely different. 

In a previous experiment using controlled soil 
temperature and moisture conditions, it was shown that a 
moist soil tended to reduce the amount of seed injury 
caused by overdoses of an organic mercury fungicide like 
Ceresan. The conditions prevailing during the time the 
field experiments were being sown might have had a similar 
effect. Table XXXIX gives the maximum and minimum tempera¬ 
ture of the air and the precipitation for the month of May, 
1940. The maximum and minimum soil temperatures cover 
only the latter half of the month. These figures cover the 
periods, of approximately two weeks duration, before and 
after seeding. The soil moisture at the time of sowing 
was approximately 30 % on an oven dry basis.

This table, therefore, provides a plausible 
explanation of the results obtained. It will be observed 
that the conditions prevailing in the field during the 
time of germination, May 17 to May 31, are comparable to 
those of the controlled temperature and moisture test 
which gave the least seed injury from Ceresan. 

Suoh observations as have been made indioate 
that the increase in emergence and yield resulting from 
seed treatment with organic mercury dusts is due to seed 
protection rather than to a direct stimulation to plant 
growth. It appears that convincing evidence of stimula¬ 
tion is not forthcoming (29, 34, 46). Miles (29) also 
reported that in laboratory trials the growth rate of seed¬ 
lings from treated seed exceeds by from 5 to 20% that of 
those from the controls which are commonly overrun by 
moulds. Other workers who have reported significant in¬ 
creases in emergence and yield of clean, healthy seed 
grain are Morwood (30), Koehler (23), and Porter (36). The 
increases in yield were as high as 10% for oats and 5% for 
wheat. 

On the basis of these experimental data, it would 
seem that seed treatment of wheat with organic mercury 
dusts is good agricultural practice and that there is no 
danger of seed injury to moist seed if the seed is sown 
immediately following treatment, whereas normal seed can be

as has been demonstrated here and in other laboratories. 


SUMMARY 


1. There has been very little reported in the liter¬ 
ature on the chemical seed treatment of grasses, 

2, The work was conducted mainly with the idea of 
improving the germination and stands of several grasses by 
means of various chemicals such as Ceresan, i oz. Leytosan, 
Lunasan, Sulfanilamide, etc, 

3, Chemical seed treatment of Kentucky blue grass 
and crested wheat grass failed to increase the germination. 

4, The leaf spot and foot rot disease of Kentucky 
blue grass caused by Helminthosporium vagans was not con¬ 
trolled effectively by Ceresan, in an experiment in which 
the inoculum was added to the soil. 

5. Ceresan and i oz. Leytosan markedly increased the 
germination of hulless timothy seed, while only Ceresan 
increased the germination of the hulled timothy seed. 

6. Talc, used as a diluent in these studies and 
usually considered to be an inert material, tended to increase 
the germination of hulled and hulless timothy seed and

crested wheat grass seed but not that of Kentucky blue 
grass. 

7. Temperature had little effect on the response of 
hulless timothy seed to treatment with Ceresan. 

8. Ceresan is much more likely to cause seed injury 
than oz. Leytosan or Lunasan when applied at excessive 
rates to moist seed, especially under greenhouse conditions. 

9. Temperature and moisture appeared to have no 
direct significant effect on the response of wheat to seed 
treatment with Ceresan, but there is the possibility of an 
indirect effect. 

10. Varieties of spring wheat reacted differently to 
seed treatment with Ceresan. Overdoses caused least injury 
to Marquis, Red Bobs, Thatcher, Sikora, and Canus, while 
Regent and Renown were seriously injured, with Reward and 
Garnet intermediate. 

11. The varietal differences were distinguished in 
the greenhouse on the basis of emergence and height, and 
in the field on the basis of emergence and yield. 

12. In these studies, treatment of normal healthy 
wheat with organic mercury dusts—Ceresan, i oz. Leytosan, 
and Lunasan—increased the emergence and height in green¬ 
house experiments, and emergence and yield in the field

when applied at the recommended rates. The plants from 
treated seed appeared more uniform and vigorous. 

13. Formaldehyde treatment of wheat seed caused 
serious seed injury resulting in decreased emergence and 
yield. 

14. No seed injury occurred when organic mercury 
dusts were applied at recommended rates to moist seed and 
the seed sown immediately. However, treated moist seed 
was injured when stored for a month after treatment, as 
has been demonstrated by other workers.
