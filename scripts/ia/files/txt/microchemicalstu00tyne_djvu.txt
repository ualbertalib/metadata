MICROCHEMICAL STUDIES OH WHEAT SEEDLIHOS IH RELATION TO THEIR 
REACTION TO FOOT-ROT PATHOOEHES 


Lawrence Edmund Tyner 


INTRODUCTION 


Oi late years a number or investigators Have been approaching 
the (question of disease susceptibility and resistance in plants 
irom the point or view or the carbohydrate metabolism* It is well 
ioiown that pathogenic rungi show degrees of preference for the 
various carbohydrate tissues or their hosts, and that these prefer¬ 
ences depend upon the enzyme complement of each fungus# Careful 
studies dn culture media have shovm the carbohydrate range for 
many common fungous parasites and saprophytes# 

Dichson and Holoert (?) have reported that the difference in 
susceptibility of wheat and com seedlings to "blight” caused by 
Qibberella saublnetii under favorable and unfavorable ten^erature 
conditions is due to the actual sugars and polysaccharides in 
relation to their percentage fractions of the total carbohydrates* 
They concluded that the pentosans and pentosan complexes constitute 
the most favorable food supply for the organism# High temperatures 
in the case of the wheat seedlings favored an increase in the per¬ 
centage fractions of such polysaccharides# This condition was 
found to be reversed in the case of corn seedlings, which showed

resistance to blight at the higher temperatures, and this was 
coupled with a low pentosan content. 

In western Canada, Ophlobolus graminis , a fungus which is 
probably indigenous, is our most destructive foot-rotting pathogene* 
It v;as thought advisable to study the reaction of v/heat seedlings 
to this pathogene under controlled environmental conditions which 
might be expected to modify the carbohydrate metabolism of the 
host. Similar studies were also made with other common foot-rotting 
pathogenes, namely: Helminthosporium sativum , and Pusarium c‘almorum » 
The study is an extension of the work done in this laboratoiy by 
llr. H. T. Hobertson (22) upon the histological phenomena associated 
with the invasion of wheat tissues by 0^ graminis . 

The primary concern of this investigation, however, is to 
estaolish some foundation for the hypothesis that foot-rotting fungi 
exhibit preferences for the different carbohydrates of the wheat 
plant. Particular attention is given to the role of the pentosans 
and pentosan eon 5 )lexes found in wheat seedlings. Chemical and 
micro Che mi cal tests have been carried out in an endeavour to find 
a reliable g.uantitative measai*e of the pentosan content of plant 
tissues grown under various environmental conditions* It is believed 
tnat such measurements might be taken as indices of the responses 
of the wheat plant to the foot-rotting pathogenes under different 
environments*

LITEiLlTURE REVIEW 


!♦ Pentosans as Fungus Food, 

Hawkins (11) in 1915, working v;lth the fungus G-lomerella 
cingulata , discovered that by inoculating half an apple with this 
organism and leaving the remainder uninoculated, more furfural 
producing substances were yielded by the inoculated rotted half than 
by the sound control. From cultural experiments on a synthetic 
medium of HH 4 HCg, lfeS 04 v/ith the addition of hexoses, 

pentoses or pentosans, be concluded that the organism developed 
better on the pentose or pentosan medium. He also demonstrated 
the ability oi an extract of tne organism to hydrolyse xylan into 
xylose. 

Campbell (2) in studying the white rots ox woods showed that 
various rungi exhibit preferences for the specific pentosan complexes; 
thus ArmlHaria mellea attacked the non-cellulose pentosaiia and 
avoided the cellulose pentosans, v/hereas Polyp or us hispidus acted 
in an exactly opposite manner. 

Herman (19,20) in discussing the nature and q^uantity of the 
furiural yielding substances cx straws points out that in the de¬ 
composition ox straw the cellulose disappears most q^uickly, hence 
is the most inportant item of food. In an extension of the aoove 
work in 1930 Herman en^ployed the following organisms in the decom¬ 
position of cereal strav/s: Aspergillus flaviceps , A. fumigatus , 

A. nldulgns . A. niger . A. terreus , Irichoderma spp., phoma spp., 
Actinomyces spp. He tested the availability of various nitrogen

and carbon compounds to these organisms* Particular attention was 
directed to those sugars naturally occurring in that class oi‘ 
substances iaiown as the hemicelluloses (hexoses, uronic acids and 
pentose units). Tne pentose sugars, though reaaily available, did 
not appear so suitaole lor iungous lood as their sterieally related 
hexoses. The luaximum period of heat evolution was found to corres¬ 
pond v/itii tne most rapid loss of hemicelluloses. This class of 
saccharides decoii 5 )Ose very rapidly during the first few days because 
they are encrusting substances of the cell walls and must oe removed 
oefore tne v/all can be attaciced. 

Dickson (o) in his conclusions from experiments on the host;- 
parasite eon 5 )lex of com and v/heat infested with Giberella saubinetii 
states that pentose yielding substances such as pectin and xylan 
are excellent fungous foods and produce five times more vegetative 
grovrth of the fungus than do the hexoses, and other soluble sugars* 

He summarizes as follows:- 

"Any metabolic balance which results in the formation of 
easily hyarolysable cell walls and the accumulation of pectic 
and other pentose substances predisposes the seedlings to 
fungus attack." 

Young (Eo) studying the penetration phenomena of Alternaria 
and Diplodia spp. observed a definite change in the chemical com¬ 
position Of cell v/alls at the point of the fungus penetration. These 
changes were no doubt due to enzyme activity, the pectins of the 
middle lamella being dissolved {o). However, v/hetner the products 
resulting from pectin uissolution are preferred as food by the

auvancing hyphae is doubtful* 

LiicLtife (lo) in ex^periments with Qphiobolus graminis and 
Pusarium culmorum snowed by microchemical teais upon the cell 
v/alis of invaded wheat plants, that these pathogenes were concerned 
only incidentally with the cell v/alls during penetration. He 
considered it probable that the greater susceptibility of young 
plants to these parasites was due to the action of the parasite’s 
enzymes upon the polymerous carbohydrates of the host, the success 
of the enzyme activity being dependent upon the coincidental 
development of host and parasite* 

2* Relationships of Temperature to Carbohydrate Ivletabolism* 

Dickson (6) analysed winter wheat grown at soil temperatures 
ranging from Ib^ - 36^ and foimd that the carbohydrate content 
v/as greatest in the plants at 20^ C., decreasing in amount at the 
higher temperatures* Ihe nitrogen content Was least at the greatest 
concentration of the carbohydrates and increased as the carbohydrate 
fraction decreased* He attributed temperature effects in disease 
development primarily to changes in the host, Ihus he observed 
that corn plants "blight” at temperatures of 12® - 20® C., at ?/hiGh 
temperatures wheat plants are relatively free from injury by the 
organism aibberella saubinetii * On the other hand, he observed that 
at soil teii 5 )eratures oi 24® - 30® G# com plants remain healthy, 
whereas wheat is severely affected* 

Jones, Johnson and Dickson (13) from a study of the relation of 
soil ten^erature to plant disease conclude; 2hat at temperatures 

aoove 20° c. the plumule of the young wheat plant pushes through

oi 16° or less the plumule does not push through until alter emer¬ 
gence, nence eraoryonio tissues are preserved trom intection during 
the early stages oi growth. Adverse soil temperatures, according to 
these v/riters, create an unbalanced metabolism in the seedling which 
leads to the accumulation oi pentosan-like substances, providing 
good iungous rood# Plants with a well balanced metabolism on the 
other hand contain chieily substances which are relatively poor in 
iungous food values# 

g# Helationships of Light to Carbohydrate l^etabolism. 

Gamer, Bacon, and Allard (9) found that the dioration of the 
daily light pexiod may definitely control the carbohydrate metabolism 
and other parallel processes of fundamental importance in plant 
development# The period of illumination may determine not only the 
(quantity of carbohydrates produced but also controls the utilization 
of these substances* Tne light period in some way ini'luences 
acidity relations, tne form of carbohydrate present, and also 
probably tne v/ater content of the tissue. 

Shirley (23) studied the influence of light intensity and 
g.uality upon the follov/ing plant species; buckwheat, Fagopyrum 
esculentim ; sunflower, Helianthus annuus ; wandering Jew, Tradescantia 
iluminensis. ; tomato, Lycopersicum esculentum ; tobacco, lacotiana 
tabacum # Ee found; (1) that at low light intensities the dry 
v/eight produced by the plants studied was almost directly proportional 
to the light intensity received up to about 20 per cent of full 

sunligJat; (2) uhat the ratio of dry weight of roots to dry weight of

shoots, the percent or dry matter in tops, the density or growth, 
the strength or stem, and the leaf thiclmess, all increased with 
increasing light intensity* 

He id (21) continuing the work ot Shirley made con^jarisons ot 
plants grown in light and in darkness. He found that the weight 
or shoots in proportion to the weight of roots of seedlings grown in 
the light is lower than that of seedlings grown in darkness. The 
shirt in proportion is brought about especially by the shorter 
stems, and in most cases by the much larger root systems of the 
seedlings grovm in light. Light favored the assimilation of 
nitrates, especially by nigh protein seedlings with relatively lov/ 
carDon reserves* Light was found to favor secondary thickening in 
stems and roots and the deposition or strengthening materials in the 
cell walls* 

Arthur, Guthrie and Darrell (1) round that small grains such 
as barley and spring wheat in contrast to potatoes, will grow well 
and yield v/ell at a high temperature (25° C.) if given additional 
light and COg. The production of these grains is not favored by 
low temperatures when day length is long and the COg supply 
abundant* The weight per plant of barley increased with the day 
length up to a 1^ hour day* The total cai'bohydrates also increased 
and nitrogen decreased* finely v/ar-e 

The conclusions mentioned by Arthur certainly do not substantiate 
ohe theories of Jones, Johnson and Dickson regarding the effects of 
temperature upon the metabolism of the seedling.

plants in relation to photoperiodic ohaiiges* He used tomato plants 
grown ror several weeks under normal greenhouse light conditions 
in summer, ^ne plants were divided into two groups, one group 
oeing harvested and dried and the other group being placed in a 
aark chamber for an additional eleven days* A hemicellulose 
analysis oi the stems irom each treatment revealed 12*16 per cent 
in the lirst harvested iraction and 7.96 per cent in the latter. 
Thus, apparently the synthesis oi this class of not only 

ceased in the darkness as one might expect, but heavy demands ¥/ere 
made upon the available supply. 

Clements (S) studied the inxluence oi photoperiodism on the 
carbohydrate coH^lex in Solajium tuberosum var. Husset ibiral, 

3oja max var. Ito San, and Helianthus annuus . He observed large 
and ireq.uent variations in the heraicellulose content of leaves 
at different times of the day and. at different seasons. Hezoses 
and pentoses were the sugars first formed by the plant. The 
hemicelluloses,besides serving as building substances and reserve 
food, were observed to be of importance in the degree of drought 
resistance of the plants. 

SXPSRBCTTAL iCSTHODS 
(Qualitative Tests for Pentosans. 

At the outset a number of procedures for staining pentosans 
in plant tissues v/ere tried: 

1. (a) Sections of seminal roots, secondary roots, and the sub¬ 
coronal intemodes of seedlings of various wheat varieties were

iixed in iorm-acetic-a.LOOiiol, washed, dehydrated in a butyl alcohol 
series, and embedded in paraitin* Sections lu u in thiclaiess were 
out and the slides treated-in a xylol-alcohol series before staining 
in aniline acetate (lb). 

(b) Benzidine hydrochloride in alcoholic solution (Eb). 

Ko appreciable staining of tissues occurred upon treatment with 
either of these reagents# 

2# Free-hand sections of the sub-coronal internodes of wheat and 
com seedlings were cut about 0#t) mm# thick# These sections, when 
treated directly with either of the reagents (a) or (b) above, 
showed the presence of pentosans in all the dignified elements of 
the vascular system# Using aniline acetate, these tissues stained 
yellow, while with the benzidine hydrochloride solution they stained 
a dark pink# Mounts x-vere made with Canada balsam, but it was found 
that the colors faded out from the sections In a few weeks^ time* 
Conseq.uently, if any permanent record were to be obtained from this 
phase of the investigation it tnougiit necessaiy to xiad «# 
staining procedure ?Aiioh would achieve a more permanent staining 
reaction# 

3# Ur* J* Gr# Uickson (6) kindly forwarded an outline of the pro¬ 
cedure employed in an analogous study# In respect to that part 
of his outline dealing with pentosan staining his method consists 
of the following procedure* 

”Cut free-hand sections of tissue and transfer to 10 cc# of 
0#b per cent ammonium oxalate solution# Heat on water bath at 95® C# 
for two hours to remove pectic acid# Extract the sections from the 
ammonium oxalate solution with 4#0 per cent sulphuric acid on the

sulphuric acid per 50 cc* ot solution* Let stand 6-12 hours*” 

This treatment shov.ed pentosan units to be present in the epidermis, 

the endodermis, the pericycle and all the lignified elements of the 

vascular system* Ho staining was demonstrated in the cortex nor in 

the pith* Upon mounting the sections in glycerine jelly and covering 

it was round that uhe colors did not iade over a period of some 

months if the slides v/ere stored in the daric* Ruthenium red 

(Rug (OH )2 01^) is, unfortunately, a very light sensitive reagent and 

care must oe taken in tne staining procedure and after mounting to 

avoid any undue exposure to light* The safranin and Sudan P/ 

prooaDly help in fixing it however* 

It was hoped that the aoove teohniq.ue would afford a reliable 

q^uantitative index of the pentosan content of plant sections by 

means of variations in staining intensity. However, no reliance 

could be placed in the method on a color intensity basis, since 

all tissue elements carrying pentose units stained in the same 

manner regardless of the q,uantity of pentosans present* Any value 

inherent in tne teohniq.ue is dependent upon the following features; 

(1) The pentosan yielding areas are orientated* 

(2) Theirs is an increased facility in making q,uantitative 
measurements under the microscope of the pentosan bearing cells* 

(3) A rapid method of roughly estimating the pentosan content 
by the extent of staining in a particular section is available* 

Various applications of tne metnod will be recorded under the 
experiments on light and teiiperature which follow*

Q.uantlta^lve E3tj.max/xon or pentosans> 

The method employed was that of Krober (10) as adopted by 
the Association of Official Agricultural ChemistSa 

The material to be analysed was washed thoroughly and cut into 
one inch portions* These were dried at 70^ C* for 48 hours, then 
ground to a fine powder in a meat chopper* A sample of 1.6 grams 
was weighed out accurately and placed in a 600 cc. distilling 
flasA connected to a water cooled condenser with a 300 nm* jacket* 

A quantity of 100 cc* of IZ per cent hydrochloric acid was added 
through a graduated dropping funnel and heat applied to the bottom 
of the flask. The heat was so regulated that approximately 30 cc. 
of distillate passed over in ten minutes* Alter this q^uantity 
had distilled the distillation was discontinued and 30 cc. more of 
HCl v/ere added and the distillation resumed. This process was 
continued until ^76 cc* had passed over* A measured q^uantity 
(0.26 gm*) of phloroglucinol (Merk C.P*), dissolved in 26 ec* of 
the acid, was added slowly with vigorous stirring and the distillate 
let stand for 36 hours, when the precipitate of phloroglucide was 
filtered off through tared Gooch crucibles fitted with asbestos 
mats. These v/ere dried at 97^ for four hours, and weighed before 
■cooling* 

The pentosan was computed from the formula: P = (weight of 
precipitate + *0062 gm* ) X 0.8866. 

This method depends upon the fact that pentosans are converted 
into furfural in a weak hydrolytic solution; this reacts with the 
phloroglucinol to form an insoluble phloroglucide

Several iactors militated againsT/the application of this method 
as a reliable (quantitative measure of pentosans in plant tissue* 

Some of these factors are difficult if not irr 5 )Ossible to overcome, 
as they arise from the biologic nature of the material tested* 

Thus it is thought that the difficulty of obtaining homogeneous 
samples was an important factor* Purthermore, it has not yet been 
possible to guard against slight errors arising from the techniq^ue 
of the method used such as uneq^ual precipitation rates of the 
phloroglucide, and the destruction of some of the furfuraldehyde by 
failure to pass off as fast as it is generated. However, although 
a certain degree of experimental error is unavoidable, (quite good 
checicing results can be obtained by using this method*

Effects of Temperature on Carbohydrate Metabolism. 

Experiment 1. 

During the winter of 1931 « 3£ preliminary experiments upon 
temperature effects were conducted in the greenhouse. Porty 5 inch 
pots of 3:1 soil and sand mixture were sterilized and planted to 
l^r(quis wheat {Elite selection U. of A*)* Ten pots were placed on 
a bench in one section of the greenhouse in full sunlight, which 
was supplemented by artificial light for 7 hours per day. The 
average soil ten^erature was lE^ C* Ten pots were placed below the

bench and remained there for the SO-day period of growth, at an 
average soil temperature of Ih^'C* 2en pots were placed on a bench 
in another section of the greeniiouse at an average soil tec^erature 
of 17^ C* Tne remaining ten pots were placed beloiAr this bench 
where the soil temperature was approximately 20° C* 

Alter cutiiing rree-hand sections from the sub-coronal intemodes 
or plants grown under the different conditions, and staining for 
pentosans by the Huthenium red method, a microscopic examination 
snow^ed: 

!• Tnat lignification, and conseq^uently pentosan staining, was much 
less apparent in the sections of plants grown under the benches than 
in those grown in the more intense light# 

That there was more advanced lignification of tissues and more 
intense staining or sections from plants grown at 17® in the light 
than in those at 12® in the light# 

3# That staining was more pronounced in sections of the material 
grown at 20® in the shade than in sections from the material grown 
at 15® in the shade# 

In this preliminary study, it was evident that differences in 
pentosan content, due to these environmentaJ. factors, v/ere at 
least demonstraole microchemically* It appeared that light v/as 
probably more important than temperature as an influencing factor* 

Experiment 2# 

A lurtner test of the effects of terrperature v/as made a July, 1932, 
when sections v/ere cut from Marq^uis wheat seedlings grown in the 
constant temperature tanks at temperatures of approximately (lb°,

significant. The fact that the differences shown among the four 
treatments do not agree with those in the previous table might be 
explained by the factor of difference in length of daylight periods 
prevailing. Here it might be apropos to again refer to the conclusion 
of Arthur et al (1) that the growth of v/heat plants is not favored 
at low temperatures when the days are long and the COg supply 
abundant. 

If the pentosan percentages are not significant, yet the dry

weights oi‘ the cLiiterent trec.tments would seem to uear out Dioitson’s 
(o) statement xhat the metabolism ot the plant is unbalanced at 
highei’ growth ten^eratures. However, his statement that there is 
a greater concentration oi' pentosans at higher grov/th temperatures 
is not Dome out, at least not under the short day,lengths oi the 
above experiment. 

Lioreover, in this connection, it is of interest to note that 
Henry (12) demonstrated a greater incidence of infection by 
Qphiobolus graminis on wheat seedlings grown at ten^enatures of 
13^ to 18® than at higher temperatures in unsterilized soil. li 
we positively correlate his findings v/ith the pentosan content of 
the plants grown under the lov; ten^enature conditions in the present 
study it further complicates an understanding of the statements of 
])iolcson.

iiixperiment 4. 

The preliminary work was done in the greenhouse as indicated 
in the section on temperature effects. Hollov/ing these, more 
attention was directed toward securing controlled conditions of 
illumination. Accordingly, lour small cages were constructed and 
covered with white cheesecloth. Half the cages v/ere covered ivith 
two layers, and the i^maining naif with six layers. Twenty-four 
b inch pots of soil planted to Marq^uis wheat were used in tne 
experiment, twelve being placed outdoors and twelve within the 
greenhouse. 3ach group of twelve were suDdivilsd as follows:

It was noted that the ratio of the thickness of endodermal 
walls to vessel walls increased as the illumination increased* 
Moreover, as the a^e 'of the seedling increased there was manifested 
a tenaency for the ratio of the thickness of the endodermal walls 
to vessel walls to become greater than one. This will be seen upon 
an examination of table 4* 

Those plants growing outside the greenhouse developed a more 
extensive degree of lignification of the endodermal cells* Not only 
were these cells more sturdy, but the same was found to apply to the 
cells of the vascular ring linking tne bundles. In this experiment

Experiment o. 

An atteitpt was next made to grow Karq,uis seedlings under more 
raeasuraole conditions of illumination, and it was thought best to 
exclude daylight altogether. One of the refrigeration rooms was 
subdivided into three eq^ual compartments by screens, iiazda lamps 
were suspended midway to the floor in each compartment, and thermo¬ 
graphs were standardized, and one placed in each compartment in 
positiOTxS as closely as possible alike in respect to the suspended 
lamps, being sufficiently remote to prevent the influence of direct 
radiation from the lan^js. The total watts of the lamps were 800, 
400 and EOO for the three light sources. Elats planted to LIarq.uis

study ana sections were cut and treated in the manner previously 
described* From an examination of the stained and mounted sections 
it was found that lignification in the 200 and 400 v/att material 
nad not progressed sufficiently far to allov; of any conclusions 
regarding the staining reaction, since the sections collapsed and 

















- EO 


masiced the results* The sections from the 800 watt material showed 
that lignitication had occurred to an extent sufficient to lend a 
degree of rigidity to the tissues, capable of withstanding the rather 
vigorous manipulation necessary in this free-hand sectioning tech- 
niq^ue* Pentosan staining was well advanced in these sections* 

It may be noted tnat Reid (21) found that the process of 
secondary thickening of steins and roots of many seedlings and the 
deposition of materials in the cell walls were very much inhibited 
in darkness# 

The remaining plant material gathered from ihe experiment was 
cut, dried, powdered and analysed as described under Krober^s 
method of pentosan analysis. The results of the analysis are given 
in taole b.

Although insufficient of the dry plant material was available 
from the experiment to run duplicate analyses, nevertheless, the 
rauher wide diiferences in tne pentosan content indicated that the 
light treatments were of decided influence.

a larger tipace, sacriiioing tiie rather absolute lignt control 
obxainaDle in trie darh room in lavor oi a more regular temperature 
and a greater growing area* Accordingly the method ot Experiment 4 
was extended and a v/hole greenhouse bench was used, divided into 
thi’ee portions, each to accomodate Ih ilats about one foot sq.uare. 

A iramev/oric of lumber was erected over two sections of the bench to 
a height of three feet above the surface. One section was fully 
covered v/ith six layers of 28 -- 28 mesh cheesecloth, the second 
with two layers, and the third section remained uncovered. The 
cheesecloth covering was brought down only to within two inches of 
the surface of the bench to favor ventilation of the chamber. 

The soil temperatures were taAen at freq^uent intervals during 
the experiment from August 1 to September 2, and it was found that 
the temperature of the soil in all three compartments did not 
vary at all during cloudy days and after sunset. On sunny days 
a variation of 1,5^ G, was recorded as between the six layer cheese¬ 
cloth chamber and the uncovered section, it being lower in the cover¬ 
ed section. This control was secured by the adjustment of the 
greenhouse curtains. 

On September 2 four flats from each chamber y/ere harvested, 
a portion being used for histological examination and the remainder 
washed and dried at once. 

The microscopic examination of the stained sections shov/ed 
fundamentally the same degrees of difference between material grov/n 
under different light intensities. It v/ill be noted from Table 7 
that the magnitudes of the measurements have decreased from those 

obtained on ma^terial grown earlier in the summer. This is quite to 










I 









be expected, however, due to the changing light intensity v/ith the 
season*s advance. 

Davis and Hoagland (4) , experimenting upon the extent of wheat 
growth in ditierent seasons, found variations in ar^ v;eight of wheat 
plants grown at different times of the year from Ib.E to 97.0 grams 
per luu tops© 

in table 7 is shown a comparative tabular treatment of the 
measweinents taken on the material examined September 2, and on

This table well e^qpresses both the limitations and advanta^'es 
ot the chemical method o£ pentosan analysis• It is obvious that 
one cannot expect very close cheching results but a valuable com¬ 
parative metnod of testing different samples is indicated. From 
the results it is obvious that q^uite a consistent difference exists 
as between the pentosan content of the material grov/n under varied 
conditions of illumination. The fact that the relative percentages 
do not appreciably change in the plants grown for an a,dditional 
twenty days is noteworthy. The escplanation suggests itself that the 
deposition of pentosan units had reached its maximum for the condit¬ 
ions of the environment at the end of the 30-day period* 

Again, it is inolcated that the magnitude of the pentosan 
percentage does not directly correlate with a lowered metabolic 
balance, but rather seems to be related to tne maturation and 
extent of the pentosan yielding tissues* Light is seen to be a very 
direct factor influencing the development of sucn tissues. An 
attempt was made to measure the light intensity received by the 
plants under the conditions of illumination in this experiment 
by the photometric method, but the apparatus was found to be q.uite 
useless under sunlight conditions,

The 2 ‘e suits

7 and 8 indicate that 

infection by

apparently tends to 

be more severe at the 

lower light 

intensities 

« As 

has already been shown, the pentosan 

content of 


wheat seedlings decreases directly with the decrease in intensity 
of illumination, hence some explanation other that the theory that 
severe infection attends an increased pentosan percentage linked 
v/ith an unbalanced metabolism is needed. It is recognized that 
the artiiioial illuminants used in Experiment 8 would not be likely 
to promote growth at tne optimum conditions of physiologic activity, 
yet, continuing the argument, it would be expecteu that the 400 v;att

source would oe more suitable than the 100 w^tt source and we 
should expect the metaDoliceq_uilibrium to oe more seriously upset 
at tne low light intensity. Certainly the decrease in tne height 
oi the plants would suggest tnis. 

Experiments on the nutrition of some goot-rotting lathogenes. 

ICxperiment 

The first experiment under this caption was designed in an 
eiiort to determine the con^arative values of the pentoses and 
higher sugars as carbohydrate food sources for the fungi. The 
patnogenes tested were: 0. graminis , our laboratory strain No. 4o; 

H. sativum , a single spore culture obtained from J. J. Christensen, 
Minnesota, and culmorum ^ isolated from a saii^le of oats from 
Beaverlodge, ^iluerta.

of each tube v/ere poured into a 100 mm. Petri dish, and these plates 
v/ere inoculated in the centre of the hardened medium v/ith the

iv v/ill be noticed, from figure b ihat the disaccharide maltose 
provides a moi^e utilizaole carbohydrate lood for all three 
orgaiiisms. Tne figures ai’e especially significant v;hen it is 
considered that the molar value of the five carbon atom sugars are 
to the molar value of the disaccharide as J.3:*Ub* All media gave 
poor growth of ^ sativum and ^ graminis , the former soon 
exhausting the available food supply and reaching a state of 
inactivity. A sub-optimum food supply v/as tnought desirable in 
this test in order that differences might be more marked and more 
readily measurable. Text figures 7 to 11 illustrate the degree 
and type of grovrth of the fungi. 

iTo photographs could be taken of the plates inoculated with 
0. graminis , as the mycelium at no period showed its usual v/hite 
or grey aerial growth, but rather adopted a much reduced, super- 
licial habit.

It appears tnat the extract from the plants receiving the most 
light provides more growth promoting substances than do the extracts 
from plants receiving less light. It may be assumed that the energy 
foods supplied are of a carbohydrate nature, but just v/hat proport¬ 
ions of the carbohydrate content of the respective extracts are of 
hexose or pentose nature have not been determined. Although the 
method of extraction v>rould not be expected to exert a hydrolytic 









r 









erreot, thereby freeing the pentoses from their pentosan and peotlc 
combinations, still it seems worth while to note that the actual 
differences in food value of the extracts to lU sativum vary 
directly with the percentages of pentosan indicated by the analyses, 
which fact would suggest that the relative proportions of soluble 
and insoluble sugars vary together. 

In order to determine what loss in pentosan content occurs in 
the plant material during the course of malcing an extract, duplicate 
saii 5 )les of the plant powder remaining in the Buchner funnel were 
analysed in the case of the medium light material. The results 
showed a less of 21.6 per cent of pentosans sustained by the 
treatment. This loss is probably accounted for largely by the 
water soluble pectic substances.

dry soils because oi the abnormal plant environmental conditions. 
McKinney and Davis (17) observed an increase ot infection by 
0. ^raminis on wheaL seedlings at high soil moisture-holding 
capacitieso They express the beliei' that the incidence oi‘ some 
soil drying agent makes disease sjmiptoms evident upon the above¬ 
ground parts oi the plants, whicn already were present in the root 
system. This statement, hov;ever, gives no information as to the 
actual progress of infection in dry soils, but it is thought that 
germination and grov/th of the plants under investigation will be 
sufficient to support tne life processes of the rungus. 

DISCUSSION AlW CONCLUSIONS 

It has been our purpose in the present study to determine wnat 
role may be played by the factor of carbohyui'ate metabolism in the 
wheat plant in the problem ox disease expression as caused by the 
root-rotting pathogenes ^ graminis , H. sativum , and ^ culmorum o 
The necessity of investigating the reactions of these pathogenes 
from this angle was suggested by the work of Dickson et al , 
who have i^eporteci their conclusions regarding tne relations of 
Gribberella saubinetii to the carbohydrate metabolism of the host 
plants, wheat and com. These v/orkers state that the pathogenicity 
of the organism is stimulated in hosts whose metabolic eq^uilibrium 
is unbalanced, and they show^ that a high percentage of pentosans in 
the plant goes hand in hand with such an unbalanced physiological 
state. The factor of high soil temperature v;as stated to be of 
great influence in causing this unbalanced metabolic state in the 
wheat plant. Hov/ever, the present investigation v/as designed to

Study not only the elieot o±‘ soil teii^erature, out also that of 
li£^ht intensity and of soil moisture,in inducing changes of the 
carbohydrate metabolism, the extent of such changes, and tne result 
of tnem in modifying the expression of the disease in the host. 

Tne experiments on the factor of illumination v;ere carried 
out mainly in tne greenhouse and in the refrigeration cnamber set 
at suitable temperaBoth natural sunlight and artificial 
illumination were used as light sources, and it v/as thought that 
the latter metnod, though not simulating field conditions, provided 
a more measuraole state and made possible more accurate control of 
the constants, soil moisture and soil ten 5 )erature. Various factors 
in relation to tne degree of illumination received were determined, 
viZo:the extent and amount of lignification, and of pentosan 
bearing tissues as demonstrated in stained freerhand sections; the 
pentosan percentages as determined by chemical analyses; the degree 
of infection of the plants by Qj^ grarninis ; the value of plant 
extracts made from the dried plant material as food sources for 
the fungi in vitro,; the heights of plants and their total dry 
weights* 

Since the factor of light plays the dominant role in the 
processes of photosynthesis, v/e would expect marked differences in 
the carbohydrate metabolism and disease e^^pression in the plants 
related to differences in the ill^imination received* These expect¬ 
ations v;ere realized in the present work, as marked and consistent 
differences were apparent in the pentosan content, in the expression 
of disease symptoms as caused by grarninis , and in the general

planx vigor, under dillerent illumination intensities applied* 

^hus, plants grov/ing under curtailed illumination were lower in 

pentosan content, were more susceptible to attack by graminis . 

and were less vigorous as expressed by tneir average heignt and the 

total ary weight. The stained sections snowed a much less extensive 

ligniiication oi' tne tissues end a conse^^uent decrease in the 

pentosan staining area. According to tne conclusions of Dickson one 

v/ould expect to rind such plants, obviously grov/ing in a state of 

to 

unbalanced metabolism,/show larger concentrations or the pentosan 
substances, but as v/e have not found this to be the case and have 
round in addition tnat the severity oi iiiiection by graminis is 
increased with a aecrt^ase in light intensity, one must conclude that 
although Ills theory may hold in the case of ^ saubinetii and 
possibly with other ps.thogenes, it d.oes not hold in tne case of the 
pathogene that v/e have used* - 

The experiments on temperature effects v/ere subjected to the 
degree of control obtainable in the constant temperature control 
tanks of the Field Crops Department. These v.^re adjusted to a 
range of rour values approximating Ib^, £1^, £b^, and 21^ C. and 
both summer-and winter-grown material was studied, llo attempts were 
made to study disease expression in this case as this relation has 
been well covered oy others (13,14,17). Only such factors as the 
histological observation of lignification and pentosan staining, the 
q_uantitative estimation oi pentosans, and tne vigor of the plants 
v/ere studied. Ho definite difference in the pentosan percentages 
of plants grov/n at the above tei] 5 )erat'^es were noted. The tests

were not very extensive however, and it is thou^t that tests on 

more replications would be uesiraole* It would also be of interest, 

and possibly of value, to devise apparatus which would control the 

temperatures oi une axx- in contact v/ith the above ground parts of 

the plants in harmony v/ith the soil temperatures, since analyses 

are made of the total plant tissue. There v/ere marked differences 

observed in the extent of lignixication and in the amount of pentosan 

staining tissue observed in sections from the roots of plants grov/n 

at tne different ceii^eratures, tne most marked staining reaction 

0 

and lignin deposition being observed in the ^6 C, material. Thus, 
if one were basing his estimations of tne relative pentosan content 
of the seedlings upon the observed histological findings this would 
prove eminently unsatisfactory in the light of the actual pentosan 
analyses. The chief value ox the application of microchemical 
techniq.ue to plant sections must be mainly the orientation of the 
various tissue components in the structure, ITo definite compre¬ 
hension of the plant as a living, reacting organism can be gained 
from such methods. On the other hand, the q.uantitative methods of 
analysis offer a clearer understanding of the general vigor and the 
physiological state of the plant since these characters v/ill be 
expressed (quantitatively in structural features and tissue organis¬ 
ation, 

ITow, considering the work of ])osdall{8) , Henry (1£) , McKinney 
and Davis (17) and others who nave reported upon the iniective 
power ox the foot-rot patnogens unaer different temperature condition^ 
it must be admitted that somev/hat definite temperature optima exist 
for the various fungi. Since exti-emes in soil 'uemperatui*e may be

expected to oe directly linked wixli extremes of soil moisture, and 
illuinir!u.tion, unaer field conditions, it is difficult to decide just 
wdat si^'nificance to attach to this single factor of teniperature. 
Dickson et al (o, 7, 15) nave ascribed consideraole importance to 
tnis factor under controlled conditions, showing that is is assoc¬ 
iated witn marked difierences in une degree of infection shown on 
wheat seedlings by G;^ saubinetll * They observed definite differences 
in the composition of cell walls and in the stability of the compleass 
by (qualitative microchemical tests, but observed little differences 
in the composition of tne plants grovm at different temperatur^sS by 
q^uantitative analysis for the. hydro lys a ole sugarsa This latter 
finding agrees with the results of pentosan analyses as carried 
out in the present investigation* 

One experiment oxiiy on the factor of soil moisture was ...ade, 
tnere being a series of three moisture holding capacities used of 
70, bO, and 45 per cent* notes on the plants grom included data 
on the pentosan content and vigor of the seedlings* ^igain, in this 
aspect of the problem it v/as thought that the (question of infection 
relationships had been sufficiently covered by others to v;ai^rant 
omission from our considerations. Thus, our object would be 
attained by comparing the present data with tnat already published. 
The results showed tnat tne pentosan content of tne v/heat seedlings 
bore a direct relation to the soil moisture condifions* It was 
found that these measurable factors varied Inversely, but little 
difference in fhe plant vigor could be noted under tne conditions 
of the test. Hov/ever, it is xhought xhat such manifestations of the

plants’ response to its environment would have become apparent in 
ihe post-seecLlin$^ sta,^’e. Since IloKlnney and Davis (17) iiavo shov/n 
that iraection oi‘ wneat plants oy t^rarolnis is more severe at 
high soil moisture conditions, it is again seen that the parasite 
is favored by those plants possessing the lov/er pentosan percent¬ 
ages# Eenoe it must be concluded, that, aside from allegedly oiier- 
ing favorable and easily utilizaole sources of food for the fungi, 
the pentosan content is but indicative of the general vigor of the 
nost, thus any resistance noted in seedlings grov/n under particular 
environmental conditions is only indirectly related to the pentosan 
content and directly related to tne plant vigor, of which the 
carbohydrate metabolism is an expression* This contention is 
further borne out oy the results of a preliminary varietal test 
in which three representative v/heat varieties v;ere analysed for 
pentosans. It was found that the variety which appeared most 
resistant to the foot-rot pathogenes in the field yielded the 
highest percentage or pentosans* Further,indication is found from 
the results of cultural experiments wherein sativum was grown 
on extracts of plants knovn to possess different percentages of 
pentosaiiB,'and hence different amounts of the other utilizaole 
carbohydrates* In this case, that extract containing the greater 
sugar content supported the most abundant m^rcelial grov/th of the 
fungus tested# 

0i course it must be recognized that any experiment designed 
to test the reactions of any particular fungus to various nutrients 
is complicated by the necessity of talcing into consideration the

enzymatic complement oi the lunj^nsa On bhis account no 3v;eeping 

e 

generalizations can be applied as to the favorablness or unfavor- 
abfness or specitic carbohydrates as iungous roods* Thus, it may 
be that parhogenes possessing alike or similar cornplements or 
enzymes will be round to show nearly similar pathogenic habits in 
the same plant variety* 

The development of resistant v;heat varieties is a most desirable 
method oi approaching the highly intangible root-rot problem, and it 
would seem, ii there can be any credence attached to the results or 
carbohydrate metabolism studies reported in this work, that this 
method of approach should not be neglected, Planes, if further 
tests lena support to the observations already made and substantiate 
the hypothesis of the importance oi the carbohydrate con 5 )lex, it 
would seem a v/orth wnile task to determine oy chemical analyses v/hich 
of our available varieties, grov/n under various environmental 
conditions, shoula be included in a plant breeding program* In 
such a chemical study it is thought that the carbohydrates would 
play a major role, sincf the present vvork and others* investigations 
show the close relation between the e:q)re3Sion of the carbohydrate 
Organization and the possible resistance of the plant* Thus, 
aside rrom the q.uestion of the nutritional value of the plant 
sug-ars in vitro, the same sugars in vivo are linked up v/ith the 
metabolism of the living plants and protect them by the very vigor 
for which they-fhemselves are largely responsible in establishing 
and maintaining* 

Tne particular carbohydraxe complex of a given variety is

closely tied up with the morpliolo^’ical characters and- is 

suoject to ^he laws of inheritance* Its expression, however, is 
aependenx in great part upon the environment. Varieties posses sing- 
different inherent abilities to utilize and manifest their synthe¬ 
sized carbohydrates, if grown under li}ce conditions, should exiiiuit 
a gradation of r^^sp^nsos, gr other Vvords, different expressions 
of vigor. Those varieties which succeed in maintaining a balanced 
carbohydrate eq.uilihrium under extreme conditions of environment 
would he considered to oe the most vigorous and hence the most 
promising parental material for a plant breeding program, provided, 
of course, that the vigor is associated wit-i resistance.

insofar as they indicate the cellular structures which contain 
pectic suhstances. 

2. The results of q_uantitative pentosan determinations may be taken 
as direct indices of the extent of lignifieation in the wheat

The extent of iigniiication ma^' he correlated directly with 
the intensity of illumination received.

whereas too abundant moisture will lead to a greater expression of
