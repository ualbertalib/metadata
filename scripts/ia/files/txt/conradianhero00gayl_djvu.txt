Preface 


Joseph Conrad has, both by inference and by direct 
statement, affirmed that the importance of the individual far 
surpasses that of systems of government or ethics in society 
or theories of art in the novel* "I insist not on events but 
on their effect upon persons in the tale." This sub-ordination 
of plot to character is just one aspect of Conrad 1 s attitude to 
the role of the hero in his work* 

By an analysis of the character of this hero, who ap¬ 
pears over and over from Almayer } s Folly to Suspense , unique 
in each case, yet fundamentally the same man, and of his re¬ 
lationship with his own problem, with society, and with the 
subsidiary characters who often represent facets of his complex 
personality, we may illuminate the other aspects of Conrad’s 
art. A development in emphasis may be traced from the conflict 
of man with nature to one involving purely human relations, and 
in addition to this, a study of the technique of character- 
presentation, whether through a narrator or directly, may reveal 
any parallel between the artist’s vision of himself and the hero 
he creates. 

Throughout this investigation, it will be important to 
keep in mind Conrad’s further statement that "a work of art is 
seldom limited to one exclusive meaning". The multiple appeal 
of art to all levels of life is one of its advantages over 
other forms of communication. 

The aim of this study then will be to present the Conrad- 
ian hero, as he appears on these various levels in the novels and 
tales, where he is the pivot of the other elements in Conrad’s 
conception of human reality.

THE CONRADIAN HERO 


I. The Objective Creator 

Joseph Conrad, after twenty years as a sailor, 
published his first novel in 18yb* The conception of that 
novel, Almayer*s Folly , seems to have resulted from the 
powerful Impression made upon Conrad oy a stranger seen some 
years before on the shore of a Bornean river* This obscure 
trader, cut off from civilization and from success, but still 
clinging vainly to the dream of his own worth, so haunted the 
imagination of the young sailor that he had eventually to in¬ 
corporate his impressions into a novel* Thus, Conrad began a 
literary career that was to produce eleven complete novels and 
seven volumes of tales, besides numerous essays and articles* 

No desire to follow in the footsteps of some great 
artist or to spread the doctrines of a particular philosophy, 
no contemporary social cause or even the need to make a living 
started Conrad writing, but rather his meeting with an unknown 
Dutch trader, a failure and a laughing stock, whose undying 
hope only partially redeems him® Conrad must have held certain 
beliefs and ideals before h© met Almayer, but he needed the 
individual through whose character these convictions could be 
communicated* "The most idealistic conceptions of love and 
forbearance must foe clothed in flesh as it were, before they 
can be made understandable 

As with Almayer, so with most of Conrad*s later heroes* 
The moral or ideal may be of the finest and noblest; the

adventure and romance of the plot may be stirring beyond all 
imagination; the technique may give cause for study and ad¬ 
miration; but without the central figure around whom all these 
elements are ranged, the whole work loses its unity and thus 
its very meaning. And, therefore, it is to the hero of 
Conrad’s novels that w© turn our attention, hoping to find 
in his dreams and follies, his failures and his triumph, some¬ 
thing of the purpose of his creator. 

In his essay f! Books n Conrad urges the aspiring novelist 
to be independent of false creeds and schools, advice he fol¬ 
lows scrupulously himself® This conviction, that the temporary 
formulas of art, like realism, romanticism or naturalism, are 
but imperfect veils over the enduring fundamental truth. Is 
stated over and over in Ms prefaces and applied In the novels® 
Although he was writing in the first quarter of the twentieth 
century when new schools and fads appeared and passed away 
almost daily, when the whole solid tradition of the nineteenth- 
century novel was being questioned, when all art was charact¬ 
erized by revolt, Conrad kept his foothold on the old foundation 
of plot and character# He learned to profit by the new ex¬ 
periments without selling his creative soul in exchange for 
their theories. Like Henry James, he records the history of 
consciences, not so fine perhaps but nonetheless subtle and 
complex. Like Wells and Galsworthy, he has a lively Interest 
in social man, but he universalizes his heroes’ problems by a 
subtle use of symbolism and thus avoids a narrow didacticism.

The emphasis laid by his contemporaries upon psychology no 
doubt contributed to Conrad’s insight into human motivation, 
but he never commits the error of producing characters who 
are only thought-processes isolated from any concrete social 
context. The technique which differentiates him most from 
his contemporaries, as well as from his predecessors, is his 
method of presentation for, without actually entering into 
the stream of consciousness of his characters, Conrad gives a 
complex impression of reality by the use of some figure or 
figures within the story whose subjective reactions are passed 
on to a listener. 

Since the days when Pamela first wrote her letters and 
her journal, authors have been devising new methods to make 
fiction appear like truth. First-person narration, the records 
of letters or diaries, the subjective eye-witness - all have 
been used in place of the omniscient author. But with Conrad, 
the technique of a narrator seems to b© more than a device. 

He seems unable or els© unwilling to present his heroes directly, 
preferring to place between them and himself a Marlow or a 
teacher of languages. 

Of course, Almayer f s Folly is told directly, although 
the past is sketched in as if through Almayer's own reminis¬ 
cences. In The Nigger of the Narcissus several methods are 
combined, or rather, confused. Part of the story is told as 
if by an eye-witness, part by a third person outside the plot. 

In The Arrow of Gold , the hero records the ©vents in a letter 


containing his journal, with the addition of a preface and a

conclusion by some objective outsider. But on the vtfaole, 
someone else besides Conrad is employed in character- and 
plot-presentation, and an understanding of this narrator 
within the story seems indispensable to any study of the Con- 
radian hero himself. 

Even where Conrad does not U3e a narrator, he still 
retains an indirect approach by a flash-back technique popular 
with movie-producers. We find the hero involved in some in¬ 
teresting adventure, follow that for a time until the scene 
shifts back to a past incident that may explain or underline 
the action already described. In The Rescue , the first section 
introduces Captain Lingard as he goes to aid a yacht stranded 
on the shallows near a native settlement. But Lingard seems 
particularly concerned over the welfare of the yacht, especially 
when h© hears there is a woman on board. Part II explains his 
attitude by the story of his pledge of friendship to a deposed 
native chieftain who has once saved his life. The yacht’s 
presence threatens to complicate Lingard f s plan to reinstate 
Hassim in his rightful place as Rajah. Part III picks up the 
story at the yacht with the reader nonetheless interested 
though a good deal more enlightened. This indirect method, 
however, is one used to advantage by many novelists and drama¬ 
tists when they wish to seize the reader’s interest at once, 
before introducing less stirring, but nevertheless indispensable, 
background material. The narrator, as Conrad uses him, is a 
unique personality. What is his role in the presentation of 
the Conradian hero?

Marlow first appears in Youth where he tells of a 
voyage east as second mate. Here he may be interpreted as a 
direct representative of the author since the incident is 
from Conrad’s own nautical career. A certain objectivity is 
achieved, however, by having Marlow tell it. Then too, he 
looks back as a middle-aged man upon his youth, indulgent, 
generalizing but detached, a being completely independent of 
the author. Conrad himself refers to Marlow as if he were an 
acquaintance who became, through years of intimate relations, 
a friend. Called by critics a clever screen, a mere device, 
a personator and a familiar spirit, even a whispering daemon, 
he was always a gentleman and never a vexation to the spirit 
of his creator. In th© stories he appears as a retired seaman 
and a wanderer, a sympathetic observer of all mankind and a 
born story-teller - at any rate, a character upon whom Conrad 
has laid more emphasis than he would upon a mere screen. 

In Under Western Eyes , Marlow is replaced by the 
teacher of languages, a little older perhaps, more moralistic 
than philosophic, and not nearly so charming, but still 
sympathetic and tolerant, one in whom people naturally confide. 
It Is with Nostromo that Conrad had achieved the ultimate 
effect of this particular technique. There, the events of a 
revolution in the small South American republic of Gostaguana 
unfold in part through th© medium of several persons who ar© 
all closely involved within the plot - Deeoud, a Costaguanero, 
godson of th© leading English family in Sulaco, but raised in 
Paris, Captain Mitchell, the dependable but stuffy commander

of a coastal shipping company, and Dr. Monygham, the embittered 
survivor of an earlier revolution and an admirer of Mrs. Gould. 
The character of each is biassed so as to affect profoundly 
his angle of presentation; none has either the insight or the 
philosophic tolerance of Marlow; yet our final impression is 
one of deep emotional reality and capable artistic execution. 
However, it is in Lord Jim and Chance that the narrator, as 
Marlow, appears most suitably for the sake of discussion. 

Critics have been stating opinions about Marlow since 
Conrad first introduced him. He is most generally recognized 
as a technical device, a means of presenting the story with 
the ultimate detachment on the part of the artist himself. 
Another of the narrator’s functions is to pronounce the moral 
values of the author who must remain unseen behind his work. 
Marlow can moralize upon the actions of those he encounters 
in Lord Jim or in Chance ; the teacher of languages in Under 
Western Eyes can comment upon the hero’s character without 
destroying the illusion of objectivity. 

Mr. Crankshaw, in Some Aspects of the Art of the Novel , 
suggests that, since Conrad was temperamentally incapable of 
revealing objectively the train of thought of a character alien 
to himself, he required Marlow to give a subjective presen¬ 
tation. But, since Marlow appears most frequently with the 
more admirable characters like Jim or Captain Anthony, the 
hero of Chance , it does not seem that he is needed to interpret 
"alien M minds. 

J. W. Beach, in The Twentieth Century Novel , recognizes

that no single explanation is sufficient to account for this 
particular technique. Marlow performs several very important 
functions. A depth of emotional tone is provided by the 
addition of the narrator’s background to that of the hero’s 
action. By the unifying figure of the narrator, the advantage 
of multiple points of view is retained without the loss of 
coherence. Accumulating effects of horror, of suspense, or 
of tragedy are all controlled through his consciousness. 

Being in direct personal contact with the hero, he enables 
the audience to see more clearly and also more sympathetically. 
Mr. Beach, however, deals only with Marlow’s function in the 
relationship of hero with reader. There, his rol© is clear 
because we have our own impressions by which to judge* But 
what of the relation of hero with artist? 

In a letter to Arthur Symons, Conrad refers to this 
relationship. "I know that a novelist lives in his work. He 
stands there, the only reality in an invented world, amongst 
imaginary things, happenings and people* Writing about them, 
h© is only writing about himself. Every novel contains an 
element of autobiography - and this can hardly b© denied, 
sine© the creator can only explain himself in his creations 
At the same time as a novelist writes about himself, he is 
required by artistic canons to retain a certain detachment. 

In his advice to John Galsworthy regarding an author’s r©“ 
lationshlp to his characters, there may be a veiled confession 
of Conrad’s own difficulty xn maintaining this detachment. 
f, In a book, you should love the idea and be scrupulously faithful

to your conception or lire. There lies the honour of the 

writer, not in the fidelity to his personages. You must 

never allow them to decoy you out of yourself. As against 

your people, you must preserve an attitude of perrect in- 

dirference, the part of creative power. A creator must b© 

indifferent; because directly the ’Fiat* has issued rrom his 

lips there are the creatures made in his image that*11 try to 

drag him down from his eminence - and belittle him by their 

worship. Your attitude to them should be purely intellectual, 

5 

more independent, freer, less rigorous than it Is." 

A novelist must somehow separate himself from his 
characters without actually losing contact. He must ’distance* 
himself from his own creation. 

This word ’distance’ is used here with a particular 
meaning - on© presented by Edward Bullough in the British 
Journal of Psychology in June, 1912. He says, "Distancing 
(in artistic production) means the separation of personal 
affections, whether idea or complex experience, rrom the con¬ 
crete personality or the experiencer, its filtering by the 
extrusion of its personal aspects, the throwing out or gear 
of its personal potency and significance.” Everyone may ex¬ 
perience such powerful ©motions that he longs to express them 
in some form of art but very few individuals possess the 
temperament that would make possible this kind of expression« 
Only the artist is able to achieve the impersonality required 
to universalize his own experience so that It will be generally 
accepted and understood. The faculty of abstracting personal

emotions while yet retaining their intense quality, that is, 
of distancing, is a characteristic of the artistic personality. 
Sucn abstraction usually involves the removal of most of the 
details that have meaning only for the artist and are tin- 
necessary to an understanding of the work* It may require a 
complete change of particulars so that the incident related 
is entirely different and only the emotion remains, that too 
sublimated Dy universalization and expression* 

If Conrad is presenting personal experiences - not 
actual perhaps, but parallelled emotionally at least by his 
own - then he would be in danger of losing artistic distance 
unless he employed some objective means of hero-interpretation. 
The psychological theories of art that attribute every detail 
to some element In the sub-conscious of the artist may be too 
extreme ror complete acceptance, but they at least give witness 
to the importance of personal experience in artistic creation* 
Whether we interpret Jim * s leap from the Patna particularly, 
as corresponding to Conrad f s voluntary exile from Poland or, 
more generally, as a young man’s betrayal of his personal 
vision, we still recognize the power of past events in the 
formulation of a work of art. Conrad has confessed to the 
autobiographical elements in ©very novel, and he has also ad¬ 
mitted that a journey into the past could be a fearful ex¬ 
perience to on© ’’who had not known how to preserve against his 
impulses the order and continuity of his Life”. 5 Would not 
such a writer be inclined to lose his artistic grip upon his 
subject unless he found some third person to Introduce the

hero, sympathetically, yet without pathos or sentimentality? 

To quote Bullough once more, M The artist proves 
artistically most effective in the formulation of an in¬ 
tensely personal experience, but he can formulate it artisti¬ 
cally only on condition of a detachment from the experience 
qua personal * 1 . The conventions of various art-forms, while 
still retaining the emotional appeal of the works, help to 
distance both artist and audience* Since it is the quality 
of the emotion, not the actual ©vents, that are important for 
art, conventions, like the scenic structure of drama, metre 
in poetry and rules of harmony in music, rid the ’raw’ ex¬ 
perience of externals and superficialities, tempering it Into 
something pur© enough to have universal significance* Th© 
novel, a looser genre, allows greater freedom, and thus more 
easily becomes a vehicle for preaching or sentimentalizing. 
Conrad’s use of the narrator avoids such dangers by performing 
the regulating function of an artistic convention; Marlow 
brings the hero as close as possible to th© reader at the same 
time as he distances Conrad from the intense personal emotion 
the hero embodies. Our opinion of Jim Is conditioned but not 
determined by Marlow’s reasonable sympathy. Conrad’s personal 
dislike of Russia is tempered by the tolerance of the teacher 
of languages toward the hero, Razumov. The presence or the 
narrator gives Conrad a control over material of a highly 
emotional nature that would be achieved only with great diffi¬ 
culty in a direct first- or third-person technique. 

Thus, Conrad’s relationship with his heroes usually

requires the insertion or distance; whether the events of 
the plot are borrowed directly rrom his career, or the 
character is someone who illustrates for Conrad some parti¬ 
cular personal emotion or ideal, he is so involved in each 
work or art that he cannot otherwise achieve the attitude 
required by the successful artist. In Under Western Eyes , 
where the narrator is the weakest link, Conrad 9 © grasp upon 
impartiality weakens considerably until at times hie bitterness 
against his country 1 s oppressor is evident in spite of his 
avowal in the preface to sustain M detachment from all passions, 
prejudices and even from personal memories’ 1 .^ In The Secret 
Agent , a cloak of irony replaces the narrator as the shield or 
distance between Conrad and the sordid ©vents of that particular 
plot. Peyrol, the Rover, as well as playing an important role 
as the saviour of Arietta and Real and an example as a man of 
action, also interprets most of the happenings at Escampobar 
Farm. 

It has been seen that this narrator can serve a mul¬ 
tiple purpose. In Chance , Marlow gathers together the threads 
of the plot and even interferes a little in its final outcome; 
he helps us understand just what is actually happening by his 
attitude of 9 involved objectivity 9 ; but primarily, he is the 
agent of distance between Conrad and his characters. When 
criticized for the length and complexity of that novel, Conrad 
answered that he was incapable of the detachment required to 
use a simpler, more straightforward method. He needs Marlow, 
therefore, because of the very nature of nis artistic temperament.

This necessity is proof of Conrad’s close personal 
relationship with his heroes. Every one is so much a part of 
his very being that he cannot trust himself to present them 
personally. He must step back and let another perform the 
introduction and interpretation. And, of course, it is this 
very intimacy of feeling between artist and hero that gives 
Conrad’s novels their intense atmosphere of real ©motion. 
No-one can be more sincere about his vision than Conrad. And 
Marlow is there to vouch for this sincerity. 



II. A Matter of Choice 


The hero of classical tragedy is characterized by 
admirable qualities corrupted by a single unpardonable flaw. 

The exemplary novel presents as its central figure some 
wholly good person who retains his uprightness in spite of 
the evil influence of his surroundings. In the psychological 
novel, the hero appears as the battleground of sub-conscious 
drives and fears. Each genre requires a different guise for 
its hero - as villain or misguided saint, as victim of mental 
conflict or saviour of society. 

Conrad’s heroes, too, have a definite character. Now 
that the method of hero-presentation has been discussed, w© 
may go on to study the hero himself, his role in the novels, 
his personal qualities, and the part he plays In Conrad’s 
ultimate purpose. As central figure, what is it that the 
hero must do? Why, among so many interesting and equally real 
characters, does he stand out as the hero? 

In Under Western Eyes , a Russian student, KIrylo 
Sidorovitch Razumov, fearing for hie own safety and anxious 
to gain an administrative appointment, betrays a fellow- 
student, a revolutionary, to the police in an assassination 
case. Because of his connection with this man, Razumov proves 
a valuable government spy, and is sent by the police to Geneva, 
where h© meets the leaders of the rebel faction as well as the 
family of the dead man. Just when his personal dreams of ad¬ 
vancement seem most secure, the possibility of being loved by

the sister of the man he has betrayed drives the lonely young 
student to abandon his hopes and confess, both to her and to 
the revolutionists, so that he purges his conscience at the 
same time as he endangers his life. 

Just as Razumov gives himself up in expiation for a 
former wrong, so Lord Jim surrenders to Doramin, the father 
of a young Malay killed in an ambush. Jim is not directly 
to blame for the death of Dain Waris, but remorse over his 
past cowardice and a desire to clear his name lead him to 
make such a sacrifice. An older man, and a more practical, 
is the hero of The Rover . Peyrol, retired from an adventurous 
and lawless career at sea to a lonely farm near the Mediter¬ 
ranean coast, meets there the sans-culotte master of the farm, 
his charge, Arlette, orphaned and deranged by the horrors of 
the revolution, and later. Real, a young French lieutenant 
who is stationed at the farm and who holds life cheap as com¬ 
pared to patriotic service. Peyrol, realizing that Arietta’s 
sanity depends upon Real’s love, replaces him in a war- 
manoeuvre against the English, giving up his own life in order 
that both young people might survive. Lingard of The Rescue , 
although he does not die, loses much more than his life. 
Strangely affected by the powerful personality of an English 
woman, he is persuaded, in the name of chivalry, to intercede 
for her husband and a friend who are prisoners of the Malays; 
and thus he betrays a long-standing pledge of friendship to 
a native chieftain who once saved his life. In the final 
tragic outcome, Lingard loses not only the friends and the 




-

15 


work of many years, but, more important, his faith in himself. 

These four, Razumov, Jim, Peyrol, and Lingard, as 
representative of the heroes in Conrad*s novels, have many 
qualities in common besides the one which makes their par¬ 
ticular roles foremost in importance. Of course, as with th© 
heroes of most novels, it is their reactions to people and 
events that are given emphasis. They are kept continually 
before the reader by their own actions as well as by the 
references of others. But the outstanding thing about every 
one of these heroes in Conrad’s novels is that each must make 
a choice. Every hero, young or old, sailor, student or ad¬ 
venturer, is faced with a dilemma. Razumov chooses, in the 
early part of the book, to give Haldin up to the police rather 
than endanger his own position. Later, he can choose again, 
this time between a life outwardly successful but plagued by 
guilt and remorse or confession and possible death. Jim, too, 
is able to redeem himself by a final sacrifice. Lingard, un¬ 
like Peyrol, makes the wrong decision, and must live out his 
life, only too aware of his failure. The events of the novel 
fore© the hero to a decision, which usually involves his own 
welfare as well as that of those he loves, and upon his choice 
rests the outcome. 

The alternatives offered vary greatly from novel to 
novel as do th© reactions of th© hero. Jim has his whole life 
before him, and yet he prefers death to a life debased by 
cowardice. Razumov, too, is young when he decides to give up 
success and security in exchange for peace of mind. Almayer

is middle-aged, but a decision made when he was a young man 
affects the rest of his life, spiritually as well as mater¬ 
ially, Peyrol, on the other hand, has already completed a 
full career, but even when he deserves retirement and ease, 
his temperament will not allow him to sit back while others, 
younger and stronger than he, are destroyed. 

As the ages of the heroes vary, so do their surround¬ 
ings. Many of them, of course, are connected with the sea, 
if not as sailors, then as traders, like Almayer or Willems, 
or as men associated with sailors, like Heyst or Deeoud. 

But there are others, Razumov and the Verlocs for example, 
who are found in cities far from the sea and her men. 

It is interesting to note at this point how the two 
dominant influences of Conrad’s life, the sea and Poland, de¬ 
termine the background of his novels, H© himself avows, in 
the preface to The Mirror of the Sea 9 that the sea, sailors 
and ships were the shapers of his character, his convictions 
and even, in a sense, his destiny. And naturally, sine© a 
novelist must write of what he knows, Conrad’s heroes are 
sailors, captains and mates, water-clerks and traders, men 
close to the sea and ships. But, when he is not describing 
sailors, Conrad turns to the other influence in his life - 
his Polish background and his experience of tyranny and revol¬ 
ution. There, as a sensitive child in a family proud of its 
nationality and persecuted by its conquerers, he formed his 
opinions about the value of revolution and anarchy, opinions 
frankly advanced in Nostromo , The Secret Agent , and Under

Western Eyes * Needless to say, the effects of his early- 
life in Poland upon Conrad»s attitude to society and govern¬ 
ment are implied, often unconsciously, in most of his work, 
but these three novels deal directly with revolutionists or 
anarchists, and demonstrate, on one level at least, the 
criminal futility of such destructive activity. At any rate, 
the background against which the hero makes his choice, though 
it varies from novel to novel, still retains some parallel to 
Conrad ! s own past. 

The hero makes a choice but various forces lead him 
to that necessity. Sometimes it is the sea that presents 
the hero with his problem; often it is his social context, 
the individuals with whom he is associated. He is in conflict 
with nature or with man. 

The role played by the sea in the lives of Conrad ! s 
heroes reveals a particular attitude to nature on the part of

his friendship for Nostromo. Conrad*s attitude to nature, as 
it is revealed in these and other stories, is an important 
element in his conception of the hero. Blind, but nevertheless 
determined to crush man in its magnificent power, nature ap¬ 
pears as an amoral force in the universal scheme. The violent 
storms of Typhoon and The Nigger of the Narcissus , the malig¬ 
nant treachery of the sea in the lives of Jim and Decoud, the 
mysterious jungles and lonely shores, all give witness to 
nature*s hostility. Yet man cannot hate the see* Her "sublime 
spectacle" commands his awe and homage. He remains her super¬ 
ior, however, because of his awareness and his powers of ex¬ 
pression. "For after all, a gale of wind, the thing of mighty 
sound, is inarticulate. It is a man, who, in chance phrase, 
interprets the elemental passion of his enemy.Man, unlike 
nature, has the gift of will-power. Nature may force him to 
choose, may test his character in her storms, but he alone has 
a soul and an intelligence. As a matter of fact, it is this 
very hostility of nature to human beings that gives them an 
opportunity to prove their worth, whether they rise to the 
occasion like Captain MacWhirp or go down before her opposition 
like Jim. 

Nature offers on© kind of choice to the Conradlan 
hero - a simple choice between duty and cowardice, strength 
and weakness. As the hero becomes involved in society other 
than the realm of the ship, the conflicts facing him increase 
in complexity. More alternatives, less clearly defined, are 
possible. The effects of the choice are farther-reaching. 





19 


To choose at all becomes almost impossible. 

Captain Anthony, the hero of Chance , dares to aid 
an unfortunate girl and her father, who has been jailed lor 
fraud, and rinds himself opposed by his family, resented and 
hated by the father, and almost estranged from the girl her¬ 
self. Before he finally recognizes his own claim to her love 
as surpassing that of her jealous parent, he is the cause of 
deep anguish to them both. Anthony, when confronted with the 
girl’s problem, decides to help her, out the choice, because 
of its complicated social context, is not that simple. A 
second decision is required to resolve the difficulties re¬ 
sulting from the first one. The choices of Lingard in The 
Rescue, Razumov in Under Western Byes , and Monsieur George in 
The Arrow of Gold are all determined by their relationships 
with women. Monsieur George joins in a smuggling scheme of 
the Carlists; Lingard forgets a pledge of honour, and Razumov 
his petty dreams of material advancement. Circumstance, 
chance, or maybe fate thrust upon these men decisions that call 
into question their whole code of conduct, their beliefs about 
human duty, their attitude to good and evil. Whether on the 
lonely sea or in the midst of a social revolution, whether 
isolated on a Malay island or among London’s millions, man is 
given a chance to prove the value of his moral being, to his 
associates, to some deity, or to himself. 

This all-important choice, made by each of Conrad’s 
heroes from Almayer to Peyrol, is one of a predominantly moral 
nature. Art, as Conrad regards it, deals with man’s relation

to his universe, natural, human, and spiritual, that is, witn 

his ethical life. "Every subject in the region of intellect 

and emotion must nave a morality of its own if it is treated 

at all sincerely; and even the most artful of writers will 

give himself (and nis morality) away in about every third 

,.10 

sentence. 

Approaching the novels on one level, we may find 
other important ideas and attitudes. Nostromo , Under Western 
Eyes , and The Secret Agent discuss the social problem of 
revolution; colonial administration is berated in Heart of 
Darkness; Winnie Verloc, the heroin© of The Secret Agent , makes 
an interesting psychological case in her fanatical mother-love 
for her brother; so does Willems, the Outcast, as the victim 
of an overpowering physical passion. All of these aspects of 
human life, political, psychological, religious, or social, 
are legitimate subjects for art, but, in Conrad*s final analysis, 
each problem is referred to the ethical level. Any decision 
involving man’s relationship to nature, to other men, or to 
God resolves itself eventually to a case of morality. 

This emphasis of Conrad’s upon the ethical nature of 
mankind and the universe is underlined by the statements and 
judgments of the narrator, be he Marlow or some other. He 
generalizes upon the actions of the characters so as to give a 
universal cast to the events of the plot. Little essays on 
the moral of the story, such as w© find in Thackeray, are 
distasteful to the majority of modern readers, and, indeed, 
it is the rare novelist who can include such comments

artistically. Yet, as Conrad admits, every artist reveals 
his own morality "in about every third line". His particular 
judgments are inherent in the attitude of the narrator or 
some other objective person in the tale, and these judgments, 
it may be seen, are usually moral in character. Powell, in 
Chance, is anxious to convey the topography of the Ferndale *s 
cabin. Marlow, characteristically, confesses to a livelier 
interest in "its moral atmosphere"The ironic method ap¬ 
plied in The Secret Agent is a none-tco-subtie comment upon 
the ignoble character of anarchistic demonstrations. 

Another proof that Conrad regards ethics as basic in 
the nature of things is the far-reaching effect attributed 
to the hero’s decision. His very existence is involved. 

Upon his choice rests his complete moral identity, and by it 
he reveals his fundamental ideal of conduct. Life, to the 
Conradian hero, is a pilgrimage, a sea- voyage plagued by 
storm and fog, reefs and collisions, a journey begun in search 
of self-knowledge. He may make a false start that jeopardizes 
the rest of his career, or he may get a second chance to prove 
himself worthy. Success may come only with death. But the 
journey must b© taken, the choice must be made. 

The Conradian hero then is appearing, quality by 
quality, before us. So far, we know very little. We know 
that h© is closely related to his creator, just how closely, 
we may discover as more of his character is revealed. We 
know also that the events in which he is embroiled demand from 
him a decision which Is ethical in nature and upon which 






22 


depends his moral identity* The background of the plot and 
the profession of the hero may vary but only within Conrad’s 
own experience - especially his experience as a child in 
Poland and a young man at sea. But of his character, whether 
admirable or faulty, of the temperament that determines his 
momentous decision, and of Conrad’s purpose as it is implied 
by that act of will, w© have still to learn. 

We may ask also whether an ethical aim is compatible 
with an artistic medium. However, in view of Conrad’s re¬ 
action to the universe as a whole, his aim could hardly be 
otherwise. "Even he, the prose artist of fiction, which after 
all is but truth dragged out of a well and clothed in the 
painted rob© of imaged phrases - even he has his place amongst 
kings, demagogues, priests, charlatans, dukes, giraffes. 
Cabinet Ministers, Fabians, bricklayers, apostles, ants, 
scientists, Kaffirs, soldiers, sailors, elephants, lawyers, 
dandies, microbes and constellations of a universe whose 
amazing spectacle is a moral ©nd in itself.” Whether he 
succeeds in combining art with ethics remains to be seen. 



III. The Invincible Illusion 


Marlow tells his listener in Chance that ”the purely 

human reality is capable of lyrism but not of abstraction. 

Nothing will serve for its understanding but the evidence 

13 

of rational linking up of characters and facts’*. It has 
already been seen how Conrad ! s interest in humanity for Its 
own sake led him to choose the novel as his medium. In 
these words of Marlow 1 s, he re-affirms that Interest and adds 
to it the belief that ’’the human reality” can never even b© 
fathomed without the combined knowledge of character and sit¬ 
uation. Marlow knows that he will have a greater insight In¬ 
to the events Powell Is to relate because of his previous 
acquaintance with Flora and Captain Anthony. In the same way, 
the action of the hero in Conrad’s novels, the choice he makes 
has very little meaning except as it Is conditioned by his 
character. 

Not that the persons In the novels completely over¬ 
shadow the plot. Conrad enjoys telling a story even for the 
sake of the ©vents themselves. The novels and tales are full 
of exciting, often sensational, happenings - murders and 
suicides, ship-wrecks and smuggling, revolutions and duels, 
but a second look reveals that the characters involved are 
not the ’types’, the flat characters, of the typical adventure 
story. They are fully-developed human beings whose very souls 
are under the novelist’s analysis. Conrad’s plots are import¬ 
ant certainly f and artistically excellent, from the point of

24 


view of probability, of causal sequence, and of suspense, but 
there is not a single event that does not add in some way to 
the development of character. R. M. Stauffer recognizes Con¬ 
rad’s emphasis upon this revelation of the individual through 
events. She says, "Every link in the series of happenings is 

chosen to fix our attention upon the temperamental uniqueness 

14 

that constitutes the individual". The significance of the 

plot follows from its effect upon the persons involved in it 

or from the personal qualities it reveals, and the particular 

personality of each hero determines, at least in part, the 

sort of things that happen to him, so that a closed circle is 

constructed, an organic union of "characters and facts". 

Besides the hostility of nature that may hound the 

hero like fate, there is his own character which contributes 

in a very definite way to his success or failure. Both Haldin 

and his sister, encouraged by something in Razumov’s character, 

force their confidence upon him, secrets that lead him first 

15 

into betrayal and finally "back into truth and peace". 

Heyst’s natural sympathy for the unfortunate brings upon his 
head the hostility of those best able to destroy him. The 
romantic idealism of Jim persuades him to free Brown, the one 
man who can break down everything Jim has taken so long to 
construct, Conrad’s heroes interpret events to themselves 
in the way that proves most dangerous to their safety. 

However, it is not a simple case of character being 
destiny, but rather an inextricable fusion of plot and char¬ 
acter, with the emphasis placed upon the hero’s moral life.

M. Georg©, the youthful hero of The Arrow of Gold , speaks for 

Conrad when he says, H You may take it from a man who has led 

a rough, a very rough life, that it is the subtleties or 

personalities, and contacts, and events, that count for in- 

tt 16 

terest and memory - and pretty well nothing else”♦ These 
same elements - personalities, contacts and events - are the 
material of the Conradian novel. 

Events are important in his novels; the choice of 
the hero is the outstanding event; but the choice is determined 
by the hero } s character. In each hero, as in each novel, cer¬ 
tain recurring qualities appear, qualities that are inherent 
in Conrad 1 s philosophy of man and the universe. 

Of profound effect upon the hero ! s temperament and 
his fate are his social origin and his environment. Why else 
would Conrad b© at such pains to sketch In for us the past of 
each hero, the home from which he came, and the dominant in¬ 
fluences upon his early life? Paragraph after paragraph in 
Victory is devoted to Heyst ! s early education with his phil¬ 
osopher-father, the education that produces his fatal detach¬ 
ment. Captain Anthony Is seldom mentioned without some ref¬ 
erence to his father, Carleon Anthony, the poet. Jim* s 
parsonage home peaches out to him even in the East. Neither 
Heal nor Razumov have any family, and their subsequent lone¬ 
liness deeply affects their attitude to other men. The actions 
of ail these men are often determined by the values instilled 
in them before they became sailors or wanderers, or else by 





26 


their reactions to their early surroundings. Every time 

little Mr. Fyne says f, the son of Carleon Anthony, the poet - 

you know,” we are reminded of Roderick Anthony®s escape from 

a home dominated oy a father "who had his own decided views 

17 

about parental prerogatives"• This "savage sentimentalist" 
has so instilled the belief in parental authority that Anthony 
is willing to accept de Barral as a superior claimant for 
Flora®s affection. This same home-life drives Anthony to sea. 

Jim has left home in search of adventure, but he has learned 
there only an untested, unquestioning idealism that rails him 
more than once before it is finally tempered by unselfish action. 

Not only does the ancestry or a man arfect his char¬ 
acter, but his past, too, determines what follows. No-on© can 
ever escape from the past. It is carried with him wherever he 
goes in the form of remorse. Jim once deserted an apparently 
sinking ship that unfortunately survived as witness to his 
cowardice. Long after the world has forgotten this trifling 
event, Jim suffers from his own imaginative memory so that 
even the vaguest references send him searching for a darker 
obscurity. Brown®s insinuations, though based upon nothing 
but surmise, touch this unhealed wound and rob Jim of his self- 
confidence. In the same way, Heyst is the victim of remorse 
over the death of Morrison. Razumov, though more direetly 
guilty than either Jim or Heyst, also suffers from his conscience 
until he finally repents and confesses. 

The hero’s past haunts him not only in the guise of 
remorse but, more concretely, in the shape of some character 



27 


symbolic of his guilt. These "alter-egos" are seldom real¬ 
istic; they are too intense to be human. Rather, they are 
types - symbols - even allegories, of the evil in human 
activity. The sepulchral "plain Mr. Jones", Gentleman Brown, 
"the great Mr. de Barral", otherwise known as Smith, Ortega 
and Therese - these and others taunt Heyst, Jim, Flora, 

Anthony, and the fascinating Rita with remembrances of past 
mistakes. Jttrgenson, the wreck of an adventurer who no longer 
lives among men, represents, not Lingard’s past, but his 
future, bereft of honour and peace of mind. Razumov is 
haunted by an actual spectre, the vision of his mystic Russian 
conscience. Whether as remorse or as an actual person, one’s 
past is a permanent part of his present and his future because 
of the importance of its role in the formation of character. 

His present surroundings are important to the character 
of the hero also, for all of Conrad’s heroes are sensitive to 
their environment, whether it is a ship in mid-ocean or a 
shabby garret in St. Petersburg. As Conrad uses background 
to intensify the emotional atmosphere at the same time as he 
shows the effect of environment upon character, there is an 
inter-play between the mise-en-scene and the hero. More often 
it is conflict. The serenity of the Indian Ocean increases 
Jim’s complacency just when he should be most on his guard; 
the jungles of Malaya and of Africa decay and finally destroy 
the self-respect that had seemed so secure in the midst of 
civilization. 

Strong as the ties to his past and his origins may be. 



28 


the Conradian hero is a wanderer and an exile• Either he has 
no home and family or else he has left it, to search perhaps 
for himself. In the settled communities of Europe, it is too 
easy to succumb to the accepted, the conventional, to remain 
at the superficial level of appearances, to follow in the 
paths already beaten by ancestors and parents. But alone 
and independent, at sea, for example, where a man has only 
his own conscience and his own ideals to which to account, he 
must define for himself his code of action, and he must live 
up to that or lose stature in his own eyes. Over and over, 
we find Conrad writing of the lonely figure - orphans like 
Real and Razumov, sailors like Jim and Anthony and Lingard 
who have left their English homes, outcasts or exiles. Heyst 
is the supreme example of the detached man who tries to deny 
any human ties whatsoever. Taught by his father that all 
action is necessarily harmful, he tells Lena, "I only know 
that he who forms a tie is lost. The germ of corruption has 
entered his soul”.‘ w ’ The lonely farm, the ship far from land, 
the remote outposts, these scenes symbolize man’s isolation 
from his fellow-creatures. Some, from conviction or from 
shame, are voluntary exiles; some are cast off by society; 
but all, alone as they must face life, are doubly endangered. 
The moral problem of each Is intensified like a strong white 
light in the darkness. Conrad himself must have been painfully 
aware of the exile ! s state of mind. His decision to become 
a sailor meant leaving the settled, aristocratic home of his

uncle to live and work among foreigners. In spite of the loss 
of his parents, his ties with Poland were still very strong, 
and when conditions were hard, he must have regretted the for¬ 
feit of such security. How much greater each test of char¬ 
acter must have appeared. And so such problems appear to the 
Gonradian hero. In a different situation, Razumov might not 
have been so dependent upon the Silver Medal; and so anxious 
to protect his own position. Simple, direct men like Anthony 
and Lingard accustomed to a lonely life at sea, are unprepared 
for the complex problems of shore-life. With his Insight into 
the loneliness of an exile, Conrad draws his hero cut off, 
either spiritually or actually, from society, and thus empha¬ 
sises the conflict. Whether the hero is Isolated voluntarily 
or not, his state is a vital element in the nature of his 
problem. 


In "The Return” from Tales of Unrest , Alvan Hervey 
arrives at his fashionable home to discover a note from his 
wife, announcing that she has left him for another man. How¬ 
ever, she returns the same evening, and Hervey must decide 
what attitude to take towards the sudden change in their re¬ 
lationship. He, whom Conrad calls ”the sever© guardian of 

formulas, of rites, of the pure ceremonial concealing the 

„ 19 

black doubts of life”, vacillates between a position of in¬ 
jured self-righteousness and condescending forgiveness. ”And 
then” writes Conrad, ”eame the idea, the persuasion, the certi¬ 
tude, that the evil must be forgotten - must be resolutely 




30 


ignored to make life possible; that the knowledge mu3t be 
kept out of mind, out of sight, like the knowledge of certain 
death is kept out of the daily existence of men." 20 Whether 
Mrs. Hervey has actually been unfaithful or not, she has com¬ 
mitted the unforgiveable evil of flouting social convention. 

The unquestionable propriety of life, as Hervey believes it 
should be led, has been endangered by her straightforwardness, 
and the falsity of their apparently-ideal married life has 
been exposed. But that such irregularities are even possible 
Hervey refuses to recognize. When cracks appear in the plaster 
he wants to curtain them over and forget them. This sort of 
hypocrisy has been characteristic of his life for so long that, 
faced with a crisis, he cannot tackle it honestly with sound 
principles. He wants to treat the situation, a graver on© 
than he has ever experienced before, like all the minor shams 
of which his whole life consists. Fearing the social stigma 
that © separation or a divorce would create, his first con¬ 
sideration is his own position. Nothing must be allowed to 
stain his shining reputation. But after only a few hours of 
existence in this hypocritical situation, Hervey experiences 
a sudden revelation, and his conscience is born. He realizes 
that "it was not a question of more or less pain, of this joy, 

of that sorrow. It was a question of truth or falsehood - 

„ 21 

it was a question of life or death"• Recognizing the im¬ 
possibility of living such a monstrous lie, he leaves the house 
and never returns. 

Hervey, before the truth is revealed to him, is, to 



31 


Conrad, the epitome of our hollow civilization, anxious to 

keep up appearances at all costs, refusing to recognize the 

reality of evil, each completely devoted to his own shallow 

happiness and to the "formulas, the rites, the pure ceremonial 

concealing the black doubts". Hervey*s symbolic character is 

emphasized by the device of the dressing-room mirrors that 

multiply all his precise and studied movements as if a dozen 

puppets were imitating him. These reflections Conrad likens 

to "real people who are slaves of common thoughts, that are 

22 

not even their own". Hervey’s society, based as it is upon 
hollow formulas and selfish actions, is completely false. It 
is the society that produces so many illusions and false ideas 
those that the Conradian hero so often entertains. What he 
discovers through suffering or death is the society founded 
upon reality and the human bond of fellowship. 

Though the particular form of the illusion differs 
with the individual, the Conradian hero is generally char¬ 
acterized by some mistaken idea like Hervey ? s, usually concern 
ing his duty to society. He may be wrong about the society 
to which he pays court; he may be wrong about his particular 
role in it; though he is not always entirely to blame for his 
mistake, the power of these illusions to warp his ethics and 
ruin his life cannot be denied. 

Over and over, Conrad refers to the hero 1 s activity 
as folly or illusion. Lingard aids Mrs. Travers under the 
spell of a "fatal illusion". Almayer ! s unfinished house is 
called his "folly". A "false suggestion" leads to Razumov’s 



32 


betrayal of Haldin. With youth, Conrad says, passes ,! the 

romance of illusions' 1 . The preface to Almayer’ s Folly closes 

with this paragraph;-"I am content to sympathize with common 

mortals, no matter where they live; in houses or in tents, 

in the streets under a fog, or in the forests behind the dark 

line of dismal mangroves that fringe the vast solitude of the 

sea. For, their land, like ours - lies under the inscrutable 

eyes of the Most High, Their hearts - like ours - must endure 

the load of the gifts from Heaven, the curse of facts and the 

blessing of illusions, the bitterness of our wisdom and the 

23 

deceptive consolation of our folly." Reality can be faced 
only with courage; illusions, dreams afford relief but it is 
"deceptive consolation" at best, that saps man’s moral strength. 
In each of Conrad’s novels there is some character suffering 
under such a delusion. Usually it Is the hero himself; some¬ 
times the illusion increases until it becomes the fixed idea 
of the monomaniac. When the hero regards his social reputation 
as more important than truth and honesty, when he believes he 
can succeed without work, or that he can neglect his duty to 
the rest of mankind, when h© reruses to recognise the evil in 
lire, then he has allowed illusion to replace reality and un¬ 
less he realizes his mistake he is doomed® 

The Conradian hero may De threatened by the illusion 
of material progress. He is orfered a cnoice between two sorts 
of success, and upon nis decision depends the life or death 
of his moral existence. First, there is tne success lauded by 
the superficial society of appearances, where the hero achieves

material security with the minimum of personal application, 
and is accepted by the general puolic because of his res¬ 
pectability. Sometimes, such success depends upon an in¬ 
considerable loosening of principles, sometimes upon down¬ 
right unscrupulousness; it is seldom achieved without the 
hero’s betraying his own ideals no matter how slightly. As 
time passes, his awareness of the betrayal increases until 
remorse fills every waking moment. Almayer and Razumov reach 
this state because of their illusion about society. Almayer, 
believing material success the only desirable kind and eager 
to insure for himself an "opulent existence” without work, 
agrees to marry LIngard’s Malay charge. But this one instance 
of nis weak will brings utter failure - materially, for trade 
proves poor and Lingard suffers losses, spiritually, for 
Almayer has degraded himself in his own and his wife’s eyes. 

Eis awareness of his own failure is lessened somewhat by his 
hopes in his beautiful daughter, but when he loses her to a 
Malay chief, he is forced to seek refuge in artificial for¬ 
getfulness until death blots out the painful memory of his 
folly. 

While Almayer fails utterly because of his illusion 
about society, Razumov is given a second chance to redeem his 
mistake. The importance of the Silver Medal overwhelms his 
sense of duty to a friend but remorse leads him to recognize 
the second and superior kind of success that results from un¬ 
selfishness. This success has little to show to the world in 
the way of material achievement but the peace of mind it assures

is worth the suffering. 

The illusion which Nostromo honours is that of popular 
esteem. n The only thing he seems to care for, as far as I 
have been able to discover, is to be well spoken of. An am¬ 
bition fit for noble souls but also a profitable one ror an 
exceptionally intelligent scoundrel. ,f * Such is Decoud*s 
judgment upon this ideal man of action whose admirable quali¬ 
ties soon are sub-ordinatea to the one goal of personal pres¬ 
tige. He refuses reward ror his service to Costaguana with 

the words, ”My name is known from one end of Sulaco to the 

26 

other. What more can you do ror me ?* 1 His good name means 
so much to him that he prefers to conceal the disappearance 
or the two silver bars rather than risk a slur on his own 
character. After his first subterfuge, the temptation of 
wealth is too great, and to avoid suspicion, ne begins to 
grow rich slowly. The real villain of the novel is, of course, 
the silver that betrays, one by one, each of the 'heroes 1 , 
Decoud, Nostromo, and Charles Gould, and through these, 

Antonia, Mrs. Gould, Viola, his wife, and his two daughters. 
But, in the case of the three main characters, some illusion 
or fixed idea makes them vulnerable to the silver's power of 
destruction. 

Before discussing the mental mistakes of Decoud and 
Charles Gould, there is another type of illusion about social 
success under which the Conradian hero may suffer that must be 
noted. That is the belief that a secure place can be achieved 
in society without any real contribution to it. The particular

heroes who cling to this indolent dream are the least ad¬ 
mirable characters in the novels, and would be more suitably 
termed ’negative heroes*. Almayer, who expects a fortune by 
simply marrying the captain’s favourite, Verloc, the Secret 
Agent who avoids honest work by keeping a shabby shop as a 
cover-up for his doubtful profession as an "agent-provocateur", 
the great Mr. de Barral, who confiscates others’ savings to 
make himself rich - these and others are examples of men who 
refuse to recognize Conrad’s dictum, "?/ork is the law". His 
is a moral code evolved from life at sea where co-operation 
is an essential of survival and where shirking one’s duty is 
the supreme sin. With such an ethic, Conrad sees Mr. Verloc’s 
panic about losing his means of security as the depth of human 
baseness. No-on© deserves a place in any society, whether 
that of superficialities or that of reality, unless he does 
his share of work for it. The parasites who believe that they 
deserve something ror nothing rind only failure and gnawing 
discontent. The reason for this raise belief is, once again, 
ignorance or neglect of the real society rounded upon solid 
principles of fellowship. 

A less despicable, out nevertheless impossible, approach 
to man’s duty in society is that of which Decoud and Heyst are 
guilty - the illusion that man can exist entirely detached 
from the rest of humanity. With these two, it is not so much 
a case of rinding effort distasteful as it is the result of a 
firm philosophic position. Because Heyst*s father has taught 
him to mistrust life and to believe in nothing, he wants "to

look on and never make a sound”. He regards action on oe- 

27 

half of mankind as succumbing to the "illusion of progress”, 
and so, in order to find contempt for mankind, he has tried 
to cultivate pity in place of compassion. Decoud too, in his 
skeptical comments on everyone else in Sulaco, believes him¬ 
self completely uninvolved; he takes nothing seriously; he is 
a trirler. The French lieutenant. Real, is a younger example 
of such detachment until he, like the others, is led back into 
lire through the love of a woman. Lena, Antonia and Arlette 
are the agents of society that prove the impossibility and in¬ 
advisability of isolation. Too late to save Heyst and Decoud, 
the influence of a woman does keep Real from giving up his 
life as undesirable. Through his habit of detachment, Heyst 
has lost the ability of self-assertion, and both he and Lena 
are destroyed. Decoud, who so often denied his dependence upon 
the rest of humanity, begins to lose his sense of individual¬ 
ity among the forms of nature. A stronger tie to society 
might have saved him in his crisis. Dr. Monygham has once be¬ 
trayed other men because of the "crushing, paralyzing sense of 
human littleness, which is what really defeats a man struggling 

go 

with natural forces, alone, far from the eyes of his fellows”. 
Just so, Decoud succumbs to sheer loneliness, the very illusion 
he had purposely cultivated. 

When the Conradian hero prefers isolation to social 
attachment, his illusion is usually the result of philosophic 
or logical thinking, an activity Conrad regards as not only 
dangerous but even pernicious. If the hero begins to think, he

is lost. The man of action, symbolized Dy Peyrol and Dominic, 
is the one emulated. In action, not in untested philosophic 
ideals, does man fulfill himself and find real knowledge. Re¬ 
flection, "which is a destructive process, a reckoning of the 
cost", proves the downfall of many. "It is not the clear¬ 
sighted who lead the world. Great achievements are accomplished 

29 

in a blessed, warm mental fog." 

The hero of The Rescue is Conrad’s ideal man of action 
before the illusion of emotion obscures his duty. Captain 
Lingard’s natural impulse is "to grapple with the cire urn- 

30 

stances. Conflict of some sort was the very essence of life." 
But against this new sensation of conflict within himself he 
has no weapons. Loyalty battles with passion, and the first 
time that Lingard inclines toward passion he has betrayed a 
trust. Illusion replaces reality and he is lost. The frequent 
references to knights and chivalry, especially in Chance and 
The Rescue , emphasize the artificiality of such conventions as 
compared to the solid reality of duty founded upon friendship 
and service. Conrad’s attitude to the chivalric code is two¬ 
fold, for he Is drawn towards its romantic idealism at the same 
time as he criticizes its unrealistic approach. His tutor 
once called him "an incorrigible, hopeless Don Quixote", 5 ^ and 
perhaps he does resemble "the Ingenious hidalgo of La Mancha 
(who) desired naively to escape with his very body from the 
intolerable reality of things".^ At any rate, he does show 
uncanny and sympathetic insight into the psychology of the ad¬ 
venturer who wishes to devote himself to some apparently 






38 


glorious cause like that of serving a woman in distress. 

Lingard and Anthony, both likened to knights by Conrad, are 
reluctant to face reality, Lingard the reality of his pledge 
to Hassim, Anthony that or his "mortal passion”. 

Besides the illusion about material success and pop¬ 
ular opinion, and those concerning man’s duty to society, 
there is another not unlike the chivalric Illusion that ob¬ 
scures reality. That is the refusal to recognize the exist¬ 
ence of actual evil. A practical morality like Conrad’s, 
that demands action and not thought from mankind, refuses to 

'j 

accept the universe as entirely without sin. Sympathy he has, 
but it is an open-eyed compassion unlike that of Captain 
Anthony and Captain Whalley. Both these men, closing their 
eyes to the possibility of downright evil, let unscrupulous 
villains take advantage of their generosity. Just as these 
two neglect to assert themselves against the forces of wrong, 
so do Jim and Heyst when they allow Brown and Jones to estab¬ 
lish themselves instead of ordering them away at once. Hervey, 
too, tries to ignore the wrong in the situation but finds such 
suppression of reality impossible. Evil, like the hostility 
of nature, is only too present, and man cannot combat it unless 
by realistic action in the name of society. 

Strong as the influence of the illusion may be, not 
all of Conrad’s heroes reach the state of madness. They are 
often very seriously misled, even to the extent of loosening 
their grip upon reality, but few reach the hysteric pitch of 
the monomaniac, whose whole existence is obsessed by one notion.

When such a fixed idea takes hold in a man's life, little hope 
remains of dislodging it. For example, the silver of the San 
Tome Mine is instrumental in destroying both Decoud and 
Nostromo, but its effect upon them is at no time so overpower¬ 
ing as it is in its hold upon Charles Gould. The mine has be¬ 
come a passion with him to the extent of cutting him off com¬ 
pletely from his wife without his noticing the separation. He 
has "fits of abstraction" that Mrs. Gould learns to dread for 
they "depicted the energetic concentration of a will haunted 
by a fixed idea. A man haunted by a fixed idea is insane. He 

is dangerous even if that idea is an idea of justice; for may 

33 

he not bring the heaven pitilessly upon a loved head?" 

Winnie Verloc's fanatic love for her brother parallels Gould's 
attitude to the mine as a noble but misguided intention. Not 
all the fixed ideas are as high-minded. In Heart of Darkness , 
Conrad has produced the supreme portrait of the monomaniac. 
Kurtz, savage, terrifying, possessed completely by avarice, 
is barely human. Just so, those under the spell of some 'idee 
fixe* lose their human characteristics or else distort a single 
quality until all the rest are beyond recognition. The more 
one-sided a person becomes, the more he loses his sense of 
proportion, the wider the gulf between himself and society. 

And yet the illusions and fixed ideas seem to be uni¬ 
versal maladies. Looking at Karain, the warrior haunted by 
the memory of a friend he has shot, Conrad finds himself think¬ 
ing "of all the men that wander amongst illusions; of the 
illusions as restless as men; of the illusions faithful. 




40 - 


faithless; of the illusions that give joy, that give sorrow, 
that give pain, that give peace; of the invincible illusions 
that can make life and death appear serene, inspiring, tor¬ 
mented or ignoble * 1 . 34 All mankind seems "to wander amongst 
illusions" of some kind and these heroes of Conrad’s are no 
exception. As they search for their moral identity, they 
cling to their particular dreams and follies; sometimes new 
illusions are exchanged for old, but seldom are they shed 
altogether unless in some completely selfless act. And even 
that act may be performed for the sake of an illusion. 

Lord Jim’s dream of heroic achievement is finally 

fulfilled when he sacrifices his life in a social cause. 

Paradoxically, the illusion that has caused the tragedy in 

his life eventually leads him to triumph. "Not in the wildest 

days of his boyish visions could he have seen the alluring 

55 

shape of such an extraordinary success." The opportunity 
offered him in Patusan is just the sort his egotistical dream 
would fasten upon but at the same time he is doing a service 
to society, giving up himself to a cause greater than the per¬ 
sonal one. Unless the Conradian hero is able to do just that, 
forget himself in some humane service, he fails. The common 
reason for such failure is the illusion which Conrad so often 
emphasizes. If the hero is concentrating upon material success, 
he is thinking of himself; if he sacrifices virtue to pres¬ 
tige, he is thinking of himself; if he isolates himself from 
society or allows passion to over-rule honour, he is thinking 
of himself. Man’s dreams are a shield between himself and his

social obligation, protecting him from the unromantic and often 
frightening realities of life. The pilgrimage of the Conrad- 
ian hero is never easy, thanks to hostile nature and omni¬ 
present evil, and it is a frequent temptation to replace truth 
with illusion. Lena triumphs in death because only then has 

she proven to Heyst the necessity of "taking his soul down into 

„ 36 

the street to fight there". By remaining aloof, he could 
have avoided the remorse that followed Morrison’s death and 
the powerful emotions that Lena aroused in him, but in such a 
selfish life there is no victory, no eventual discovery of 
truth. It has been mentioned that the Conradian hero is gener¬ 
ally an exile or an outcast, the very characteristic that em¬ 
phasizes the tragedy of isolation. Almayer, Verloc, Willems, 
Razumov, - each illustrates in his particular way the fate of 
those who fail to recognize their close ties to their fellow- 
men. Never one to put unfounded trust in human institutions, 
Conrad rests his faith upon the individual. This does not mean, 
however, the individual apart from any sort of society but 
rather as he is united by a bond of compassion and sympathy. 
Alone before nature or before evil, the hero is helpless, but 
strengthened by friendship or love, he has the force with which 
to defend himself. Often the revelation of the power of society 
comes only with death. Too often others perish because of the 
hero’s self-centredness. Stevie’s horrible death results dir¬ 
ectly from Verloc’s will to avoid honest labour. Haldin is be¬ 
trayed by Razumov, and Hassim and Immada are sacrificed to 
Lingard’s passion for Mrs. Travers, all three, victims of the 



42 


hero 1 3 illusion that turns his thoughts upon himself instead 
of toward his duty to others. 

This concentration upon one 1 s self, this introversion, 
is often combined in the Conradian hero with a quality of action. 
Men of few words, sailors or adventurers, are not often self- 
centred but, in the instance of some illusion or some problem 
resulting from that illusion, these heroes prove themselves to 
be brooders. Without the strong mental faculty required to 
solve the situation logically, and too emotionally involved to 
think clearly anyway, they worry, turning events over and over 
in their minds. The mistake they have made or the decision they 
must make fixes itself unshakably in their minds. Suffering from 
remorse or else paralyzed before further action, they lose con¬ 
tact with the world of reality. Another man than Jim would have 
soon forgotten the Patna episode, but Jim has not the kind of 
mind to make light of such an instance. He broods and regrets 
as do Razumov and Nostromo. Since Conrad has rejected logical 
thinking and since his hero proves the danger of reflection, no 
matter how unphilosophical, action, properly directed, appears 
as the only alternative. It is likely that Conrad*s own inten¬ 
tion parallels the one he expects of his hero. ”1 have always 

37 

approached my task in the spirit of love for mankind.” 

Gradually, the characteristics of the Conradian hero 
are assembling themselves Into some vague sort of order from the 
varied incidents of each novel. Each hero is an individual, in¬ 
dependent of all the others; still, there is a core of similar¬ 
ity from which we may deduce some positive facts about Conrad*s 
attitude toward art and toward life. Involved in a conflict that 



43 


will affect him spiritually as well as bodily, the hero is 
required to make some moral choice, but any decision is 
complicated by the presence of an illusion, or, in some cases, 
a fixed idea, that clouds his vision. With his real duty 
hidden in this way, the hero may fall victim to false impulses 
or else to evil forces outside himself. At any rate, whether 
he confuses material success with real spiritual triumph, 
whether he neglects the reality of evil or his insoluble ties 
to humanity, whether he is misled by artificial conventions or 
unworthy passions, the hero is obsessed, under the power of il¬ 
lusion, with his own being. Duty is neglected for selfish 
dreams and, forgiveable as his mistake may be, he must suffer, 
and others with him, in order to cleanse his soul of its folly. 

He must forget himself in service to others before he can really 
identify himself morally. Strongly connected with his past, 
the hero is, at the same time, an exile or an outcast, a state 
that underlines his dilemma and emphasizes the need for fellow¬ 
ship and co-operation. Since he is a brooder rather than a 
thinker, he is haunted by remorse over past mistakes, and yet 
unable to rid himself of such regret by cold logic. Though fate 
often seems to pursue him, he also contributes concretely to 
his own downfall by these qualities of exile, dreamer and brooder. 
But the hero’s suffering, his follies, dreams and regrets, can¬ 
not be entirely without significance. "Haven’t we, together 
and upon the immortal sea, wrung out a meaning from our sinful 
livesThe revelation of the hero’s career, the discoveries 
he makes through hardship, these are fundamental to Conrad’s 
ideal of life and art. 






IV. The Ideal of Conduct 


Though Conrad has often denied a directly moral pur¬ 
pose to his art, there is, nevertheless, among the multiple 
levels of each novel, one aspect that presents an ideal of 
conduct - an ideal that is, because of its application to 
man’s relationship with the universe, of ethical significance. 
Conrad, or pernaps Marlow, takes a particular stand in regard 
to the events of the novel and to the behaviour of tne hero, 
and by that attitude, even if no directly judgmental state¬ 
ments are made, the opinion of the novelist is inferred. In 
addition to the bias of the novelist’s attitude, the presence 
of the narrator gives another opportunity to present some 
ideal, for Conrad, while ne can nardly praise his own opinions, 
can at least make Marlow’s sympathy an exemplary quality. By 
these two methods the reader is given a double lesson - an 
Ideal approach as well as an ideal of conduct. On the other 
hand, no matter how ethical Conrad’s effect may be, he can 
never be accused of didacticism, for, although he attacks sucn 
particular problems as anarchism and colonial administration, 
they are only incidental to the universal qualities the hero 
represents. More aware than many of the danger of such 
narrow ’message-novels’, Gonrad writes "that a work of art 
is very seldom limited to one exclusive meaning and not neces¬ 
sarily tending to a definite conclusion. And for the reason 
that the nearer it approaches art the more it acquires a 


44

45 


symbolic character... All the great creations of literature 
have been symbolic, and in that way have gained in complexity, 
in power, in depth and in beauty”.^ y 

One of the difficulties of interpreting Conrad*s 
meaning and his ideal results directly from this very symbol¬ 
ism, for truly, few of Conrad’s novels ’’are limited to one 
exclusive meaning”. One cannot merely conclude ’’Conrad says 
all thought is dangerous and all action good”, or even ’’Conrad 
despises Almayer and idolizes Peyrol”. Art, as he states, is 
never that simple. The artist’s attitude to his own creations 
is mixed. Since he deals with life, even if it is in an art¬ 
istic form, he must realize that there is no line, visible or 
invisible, exactly dividing good and bad. The best of inten¬ 
tions may be unwittingly corrupted by evil forces or by the 
unworthiness of their object. At times the artist’s personal 
sympathy for a scoundrel or unconscious dislike of a saint 
colours his conscious statements with shades of meaning of 
which he himself is unaware. And Conrad, though less subject¬ 
ive than many of his contemporaries, is not unique in the 
varied levels of his attitude to his own hero. 

As proof of this statement, the hero of one novel may 
be examined. Let it be Jim. Does Conrad set Jim up as an 
ideal example of conduct or does he condemn him as a hopeless 
villain? Neither extreme is wholly false for both contain an 
element of truth. On one level Jim is recognized as a real 
tragic hero because he is a leader in Patusan and because his 
action of sacrifice in a social cause makes him greater than

average. When the plot affords him the opportunity to act 
heroically, he does so without flinching, and yet, in spite 
of the qualities of bravery and unselfishness revealed in the 
final chapters, there has been a great deal of criticism over 
his actions. Did he not desert his Malay wife, Jewel, ignor¬ 
ing her entreaties and destroying her dreams after all his 
promises to her? Was he not, after all, still behaving like 
a dreamy adolescent, lost in a personal vision of adventurous 
glory that he has not the power to fulfill? His death in 
Patusan may be interpreted as escapism and his leap from the 
Patna as weakness. Is he not then pathetic rather than tragic? 
If Conrad's statement that ail art has multiple meaning is 
accepted, (and to reject such a theory of art is to Ignore all 
but the most obvious of its appeals) then both conclusions 
about Jim are true. Neither villain nor ideal, he is as right 
as he is wrong. His romanticism is a weakness when he does 
not live up to the ideals it presents, but a power when it is 
finally fulfilled in action. Perhaps he is answering an ego¬ 
tistical desire to be a hero, but, at the same time, he act¬ 
ually is a hero, achieving something greater than mere external 
success. To his wife, to Brown, he is a failure, a deserter 
to one, a fool to the other, a leader who throws away a chance 
to become a real power in trade and society; but others, Stein 
and Mariow especially, recognize the ideal for which Jim 
strives that is greater than outward achievement because its 
reward is spiritual and intangible. 

The attitude of Marlow-Conrad reveals these two levels 













.

47 


of the novel. Often, an ironic tone towards Jim T s idealized 
opinion of himself colours Marlow’s narration of events, but 
Marlow recognizes, in spite of his irony, that Jim’s weakness 
is only too widespread and that anyone, even Marlow himself, 
is just as likely as Jim to cling to dreams. The combination 
of sympathy and censure in the portrayal of this particular 
hero is the very quality that elevates the novel to the level 
of symbolic art. By giving the novel several possible meanings, 
Conrad has eliminated the danger of a narrow, single conclus¬ 
ion, and has intimated that the real meaning is something even 
beyond these two attitudes of tragedy and irony, some inex¬ 
pressible universal truth that can be only suggested by the 
particulars of plot and character. 

Marlow’s function as the agent of artistic distance 
has been discussed in an earlier chapter and another of his 
duties might be mentioned here in connection with these levels 
of meaning. In the narrator the multiple meanings are united. 

Ee joins the sympathy and the censure into a complete symbolic 
whole. For example, Conrad, who is more closely related to 
Jim, emotionally at least, than he would care to admit, might 
be inclined to overdo one or other of the two attitudes we 
find in the novel. He may allow his subjective sympathy to 
overwhelm his sense of proportion, setting Jim up as perfection, 
or else, realizing the weakness of Jim’s romanticism and the 
danger of identifying himself too closely with his hero, he 
may underline the irony and criticism until there Is nothing 
left, no heroic actions or powerful emotions, to admire in Jim. 



- 48 - 


He could be portrayed either as entirely innocent of mis¬ 
takes or completely inexcuseable, but Marlow, with his ob¬ 
jective understanding and his wonderful sense of balance, 
can maintain a suitably-proportioned attitude of sympathetic 
judgment, enabling Conrad thus to avoid either undesirable 
extreme• 

Conrad’s two-sided attitude to Jim is not the only 
example of such bipolarity In his work* Any of the novels 
or tales would afford the same evidence* The heroes exist in 
varying degrees of praise or blame, but both approaches are 
always present. Peyrol is perhaps the most purely ’heroic’ in 
the sense of the Ideal. From the events of The Rover there is 
little in his character to be questioned* He is honest, sym¬ 
pathetic toward Arietta 1 s unbalance and Real’s coldness, 
patriotic and brave, a worker even in the days of his retire¬ 
ment* But, at the same time, there are clear references to 
the questionable quality of his past* As a ’Brother of the 
Coast’, his career has not been exactly respectable, and, though 
he has always lived by a definite code of ethics, it is a code 
not likely to be accepted by more conservative circles. Even 
those whose lives he has saved by his own death. Real and 
Arlette, ask ”What sort of man was he really?”, and the answer 
is, ”the only certain thing we can say of him is that he was 

not a bad Frenchman”. Peyrol is the ”man of dark deeds, but 
40 

of large heart”, neither all good nor all bad, whom Conrad 
admires, but with reservations. 


While Peyrol tips the balance toward the ideal side.

men like Willems and Almayer and Kurtz weigh it well on the 
side of evil. Willems is a cact, a weak, dishonest cheat, 
but, by having Almayer relate at least part of the story of 
Willem 1 s mental and moral decay, Conrad manages to elicit 
some particle of sympathy ror the Outcast. After all, Almayer 
is no example. He too has made mistakes and is in no position 
to judge others. His complaining attitude toward Willems 
leads the reader to more than pity ror the man so completely 
under Aissa ! s spell that he is willing to betray his bene¬ 
factor, Lingard, in exchange for her love. 

Kurtz is no less despicable than Willems and a good 
deal more horrible in his savage greed, but Marlow, as he 
travels along that African river toward the Heart of Darkness, 
is only too aware of his remote kinship with the prehistoric 
men who howl and dance along the bank. Guilty as Kurtz may be, 
Marlow cannot condemn him utterly, is even willing to lie for 
the sake of his memory, because of his realization of the po¬ 
tential evil in every human being. Conrad’s emphasis upon 
this bond of humanity gives his creation of the most villain¬ 
ous scoundrels a touch of sympathy, a level of tragedy elevating 
the ironic quality of the narration or the pathetic or melo¬ 
dramatic events of the plot. 

Lingard, an older version of Jim in many ways, reveals 
a neater balance between admirable and questionable character¬ 
istics. His is the tragedy of the well-meaning man who is 
willing to act on'behalf of any human being, and yet who has 
uncommonly bad luck or else bad judgment in choosing the objects

of his charity. Almayer 1 s Folly relates as background 
Lingard’s rescue of a native girl from a Malay prau he has 
conquered. In spite of his desire to help her, she fears 
and dislikes him because of his failure to take her for him¬ 
self. Instead, he educates her and marries her eventually to 
Almayer. She avenges her dissatisfaction years later by en¬ 
couraging their daughter, Nina, to run off with Dain Maroola. 
Lingard had hoped to enrich Almayer by this marriage at the 
same time as he assured his charge’s security, but his hopes 
are killed when Almayer proves too weak to make the most of 
the opportunities for trade in Sambir. Another of Lingard*s 
proteges, Willems, first steals from the trader with whom 
Lingard has placed him and finally becomes a traitor to his 
benefactor by bringing a rival trader up the river which only 
he and Lingard can navigate. The Rescue , the only novel In 
which Lingard is the central figure, tells of another of his 
failures. Events are such that a pledge of honour conflicts 
with the motive of passion. Lingard cannot persuade the 
Malays to free their English prisoners taken from a stranded 
yacht without straining the diplomatic relations so necessary 
to his Intention of reinstating his native friend, Hassim, in 
hi 3 lost kingdom. Lingard’s admiration for the woman passenger 
of the yacht causes him to forget momentarily his friendship 
with Hassim, a lapse that results in tragedy and dishonour. 

His desire to assist Mrs. Travers is indeed a legitimate one, 
and yet, like most of Lingard’3 fine intentions, it proves 
false, bringing destruction and unhappiness in its wake. 





51 


Conrad*s dislike of Russia and his sympathy for a 
misled young man combine in his portrayal of Razumov, so that 
Under Western Eyes is more than a particular condemnation of 
revolution and betrayal* The final impre33ion is that of 
the tragic nobility of a persecuted people and a heroic young 
student * 

The split in Conrad*s attitude that results in these 
levels of meaning and that bears witness to some spiritual 
ideal beyond the merely pathetic or tragic, elevating his work 
from didacticism to art, also increases the difficulty in 
reaching a single conclusion about his purpose• The variety 
of acceptable interpretations makes it impossible to state 
simply one ideal that Conrad advances. And as with any man 
who continues to deal seriously with the issues of life, his 
opinions are continually developing and changing. No great man 
has ever been a consistent thinker, at least not on the super¬ 
ficial level. There may be some more general truth that in¬ 
cludes all the varied elements of the beliefs of such a man, 
but on the surface he appears to contradict himself. Conrad 
admits the static quality of unchanging systems of thought 
as compared to a dynamic living belief when he writes, "My 
attitude to subjects and expressions, the angle of vision, my 
methods of composition will, within limits, be always changing - 
not because I am unstable or unprincipled but because I am 
free. Or perhaps it may be more exact to say, because I am 
always trying for freedom within my limits." Because Conrad 
is "no slave to prejudices and formulas", a clearly defined

ideal of conduct is not easily deduced from his novels. The 
passage from his letters quoted at the beginning of this chap¬ 
ter, stating his belief that a definite conclusion is foreign 
to art, should warn us perhaps that we should not seek for 
such an ideal. But symbolism, in addition to giving power and 
beauty to art, has its universal significance, ethically as 
well as artistically, and although the word ^moral* is often 
avoided because of its unattractive overtones, it cannot be 
denied that Conrad is presenting in his novels his own ideas 

about right and wrong. He, ”who has never flapped any Message* 

42 

in the face of the world”, still states that "certain con- 
elusions remain immovably fixed in my mind”. And, while one 
of those conclusions is about the symbolic character of all 
great art, we cannot help but conclude that another is his 
belief about an ideal of conduct for man in society. Conrad 1 s 
novels may be read and enjoyed for the plots alone or for the 
amazing psychology of characterization or even for the beauty 
and clarity of the descriptive passages, but, unless any one 
of those elements - or all three together - move the reader in 
some definite way, unless his own beliefs and attitudes show 
some change, no matter how slight, after reading the novel, 
then he has wasted the time spent in reading. As long as he 
finds something to praise or condemn, a character to admire or 
one to pity, then he has found an element or two of Conrad*s 
ideal, and the meaning communicated through his writing. 

Conrad writes in ”A Familiar Preface” to A Personal 
Record "Those who read me know my conviction that the world.

the temporal world, rests on a few very simple ideas• •. 

44 

It rests notably, among others, on the idea of Fidelity”. 

This fidelity is one of Conrad 1 s Ideals, the one that, in 
action, leads to other virtues like courage and honesty. The 
quality of these fundamental ideas which Conrad emphasizes 
again and again is their simplicity. ”A few very simple 
ideas”, he says. "Thoughtless lives guided by a simple feel¬ 
ing”^ are presented in many of his novels, for the complex 
ideas reached by intense reflection or by philosophic thought 
contribute little to human achievement. "Nothing humanely 
great - great, I mean, as affecting a whole mass of lives, - 
has come from reflection.When thought loses its simplicity 
it loses as well Its efficacy. Remaining simple and straight¬ 
forward, it remains effective. If the hero has a single ideal 
or dream, by which he is guided, he cannot wander far, no 
matter how the universe battles against him. Fidelity to this 
simple idea, whatever it might be. Is the first consideration 
in the Conradian ideal of conduct. Jim, by remaining faithful 
to his romantic vision, finally achieves nobility. Razumov 
mistakes personal security for spiritual peace of mind and 
thus betrays his ideal until his confession of his treachery 
brings him back to the truth, a truth to which he remains 
loyal by living out his life crippled and poor, tended only 
by the patient Tekla. 

Very often the Conradian hero is befriended or ac¬ 
companied by some such figure as Tekla, the symbol of unquest¬ 
ioning devotion. Often, like Tekla, these faithful creatures

are just allegories, with no other characteristics but their 

fidelity - the French captain in Lord Jim , who has been in 

the party that boarded the deserted Patna and who "does one’s 

possible" without ever wavering, the dog-like Pedro in Victory , 

called ’faithful’ over and over, and loyal to Mr, Jones in 

spite of his undeserving of such trust, Haji Wasub, the 

47 

’serang* of Lingard’s brig, "a slave to duty", and "symbolic 
of blind trust in his (Lingard’s) strength, of an unlimited 
obedience to his will", Tekla is the supreme example of 
fidelity. She tells Miss Haldin the story of her suffering 
while she nursed a revolutionist-lithographer who had been 
fatally injured in a beating by the police and deserted by his 
fellow-revolutionists because he revealed in his weakened state 
some bits of information. Just as passively she has accepted 
her inferior position as secretary to one of the anarchist- 
leaders* Finally, when Razumov, deafened by Nikita as punish¬ 
ment for his duplicity, is struck by a street-car he does not 
hear, Tekla is the only one to go to his aid, and it is she 

who cares for him "unweariedly with the pure joy of unselfish 
„ 49 

devotion". Just as Gentleman Brown and Mr, Jones represent 
something in the hero’s character, his past or his guilt, so 
do these faithful ones, Tekla and Wasub and the rest, symbolize 
the quality that to Conrad is ethically uppermost. 

The second simple idea that contributes to the Conrad- 
ian ideal of conduct and that is a corollary to the idea of 
fidelity is responsibility. When J8rgenson tries to dissuade 
Lingard in The Rescue from reinstating Hassim as Rajah, Lingard

answers "When you save people from death you take a share in 
50 

their life", Charles Gould, in spite of his preoccupation 
with the San Tome Mine, still realizes his responsibility 
toward the people of Costaguana that have benefited by the 
mine*s operation. His wife, wearied by all the trouble the 
mine has caused them, wishes aloud that they had left it alone, 
but he reminds her that it is impossible to do so, and now 
that they had brought mankind into it, they were no longer 
free to turn their backs on them to go and begin a new life 
elsewhere. The responsibility of every human being toward 
his fellows is just as important as his fidelity to his own 
personal ambitions. No-one can turn his back upon the rest of 
mankind without incurring the wrath of some part of the uni¬ 
verse. Usually it is one f s conscience that keeps his sense of 
responsibility alive. If, like Razumov, he has neglected his 
obligation toward a friend, his sense of guilt will pursue and 
torture him until he acknowledges his mistake by some sort of 
penance. On the other hand, he may, like Heyst, purposely 
deny any responsibility whatsoever toward mankind. Then, fate 
or whatever force is active in the universe to punish man*s 
folly, throws in the path of this detached man those very 
persons whom he feels constrained to aid. Morrison first draws 
Heyst into human fellowship and responsibility by his need of 
a loan to save his brig. Morrison looks upon Heyst as the 
answer to a prayer, but the inhabitants of the Eastern ports 
where the two men visit feel Heyst is taking advantage, es¬ 
pecially after Morrison dies. While Heyst is still suffering

under the unfavourable opinion of such critics, Lena appears 
at Schomberg’s hotel, a badly-treated musician in the all-girl 
orchestra of the cruel Zangiacomo and the object of Schomberg’s 
unwelcome advances. Heyst once more offers his assistance, 
rashly perhaps, led by some desire to help the unfortunate, 
a humane impulse ungovernable in spite of his intellectual 
principles. He and Lena escape to the island that was the 
former site of his and Morrison’s liquidated coal company, and 
are pursued there by Mr. Jones and his companions who have been 
led to believe by the frustrated Schomberg that Heyst has a 
treasure hidden somewhere on the island. Now, Heyst, by free¬ 
ing Lena from Zangiacomo, has become her only guardian. He 
has taken a share in her life and it is his responsibility to 
go on protecting her. But the noble impulse that led him to 
help her before is suspended when he allows his father’s theor¬ 
ies of isolation to govern him. By reflection, as Conrad says, 
he loses his powers of self-assertion, and Jones is able to 
destroy Lena and thus, indirectly, Heyst himself. But, Lena, 
dying from Jones’ bullet, has proven to Heyst the triumph of 
death that is suffered for the life of another. Love that is 
greater even than life, love that accepts such complete respon¬ 
sibility for a beloved, is victory, and Heyst in his loss 
finally realizes the meaning of Lena’s sacrifice. His last 
words to Davidson, before he purifies everything by burning 
himselx and Lena’s body in their bungalow, bear witness to 
this revelation, "Woe to the man whose heart has not learned 
wnile young to hope, to love and to put its trust in lif@. nS ^

The responsibility toward individuals that Heyst 
fails to fulfill is paralleled by the duty of every man to¬ 
ward society as a whole. Everyone may not have one particular 
friend or loved one for whom he is responsible, but neverthe¬ 
less, he is not exempt from social obligation. The illusion 
which misleads Almayer and Verloc into indolence is the one 
that ignores this social necessity. Just as each sailor must 
perform his especial duty to keep the ship travelling toward 
port, so must every being do his part in the progress of society 
against the chaos of the natural universe. Man has the capabi¬ 
lity of bettering himself spiritually, but only insofar as he 
joins with the rest of mankind in the struggle. 

Responsibility as Conrad sees it is closely related 
to duty. To neglect one’s duty, be it great or small, is to 
prove oneself unworthy of a place in society. Purposeful iso¬ 
lation like Heyst’s, unconstructive scepticism like Decoud’s, 
greed like Almayer’s, indolence like Verloc’s, selfishness 
like Razumov’s, - each of these attitudes is untenable if one 
is to advance in any way, for without some contribution, no 
reward is forthcoming. There is no simpler idea in human ethics 
than that of duty - duty to family, to community, to God. Often, 
a choice between two duties seems to present itself. Lingard 
has pledged his aid to Hassim and yet he feels bound to en¬ 
danger that pledge by helping Mrs. Travers. Because the first 
pledge was one of honour, and because of Lingard’s responsibi¬ 
lity toward those he has already saved once, he was really not 
free to make a second promise. Separately each duty makes a 



58 


legitimate claim, but events are such that, no matter what 
decision Lingard reached, destruction is the only possible 
outcome* The decision he does make however, to waive Hassim f s 
cause Tor the sake of Mrs* Travers, proves a wrong one, and 
his good intention is corrupted at the outset by the very 
nature of the dilemma, 

Conrad too must have faced the conflicting demands of 
two equally-pressing duties when he decided to go to sea. Be¬ 
hind him was the memory of all his father had done for Poland 
in the name of liberty; before him were his personal dreams 
and longings. A decision either way must have seemed like a 
betrayal of one duty or the other, his duty to his family and 
his country or his duty to himself. But by becoming a sailor 
and later a writer of novels, Gonrad acknowledged his duty 
towards society. Whether he fulfilled his purpose as he wished 
to is something only he can know, but we have his own words that 
he regarded life as a ’’task”, one which he approached ”in the 
spirit of love for mankind”• 

The recognition of the absolute necessity for accept¬ 
ing one *s responsibility follov/s naturally from Conrad’s be¬ 
lief in the insoluble bonds binding mankind into a whole. He 
insists upon this bond in direct statements as well as in the 
inferences of every novel. In The Mirror of the Sea he refers 
to the fundamental quality of this bond. ”No matter how 
earnestly we strive against each other, we remain brothers on 

the lowest side of our intellect, and in the instability of our 
52 

feelings.” Marlow becomes uneasy at the thought of his

kinship with the savages he encounters in Heart of Darkness , 
That particular tale, by its method of taking the reader back 
through time to some primeval age as well as away from civil! 
zation along that dark river, reminds him of his connection 
with such times and such people through his similar origins* 
It is interesting to note also, in Conrad*s statement about 
human brotherhood, that he specifies "the lowest side of our 
intellect”• Does thought tend to separate people? Certainly 
it is the simple, unphilosophical ideas, the nobler emotions, 
that Conrad advocates as doing humane service. Fellowship is 
guided by an intuition, not by a rule, and, like most of the 
Gonradian virtues, remains meaningless except in action* 

When criticized for his f decivilized ! subjects and 
scenes, Conrad answered these objections by insisting upon 
the bond between European civilization and "that humanity so 
far a?/ay" in Malaya and Africa. These obscure lives that 
catch and hold Conrad*s interest are witnesses of the "solid¬ 
arity. •.which binds men to each other and all mankind to the 
visible world”.^4 How can any man fall to take his place in 
this union without bringing tragedy upon himself and those 
close to him? 

This bond of humanity that demands fidelity and a 
sense of responsibility is deeply imbedded in human conscious 
ness. It is one of the universal laws that order human exist 
ence in eternal opposition to the artificial externals that 
are Imposed by illusions and obsessions. The moral laws of 
duty and fidelity are intuitive in mankind, whereas conscious

reflection substitutes unrealities for basic truths. To 
Conrad, duty is the first reality, often more effort than it 
first appears to be worth, but the eventual reward of peace 
with oneself and one’s fellows is sufficient reason for transi¬ 
tory hardship. 

The quality that keeps one’s sense of duty alive is 
the third Conradian ideal - the virtue of sympathy. Marlow’s 
attitude toward those whose stories he relates presents the 
example. In spite of his awareness of Jim’s weaknesses, of Anthony’ 
faults, of Kurtz’s corruption, or even because of this aware¬ 
ness, he is able to understand and sympathize, and to convey 
his compassion in the way he tells the story, so that the reader 
too sympathizes. In order to express fully one’s feeling for 
the rest of mankind, it is necessary to take part in their 
suffering. ”1 would not like to be left standing as a mere 
spectator on the bank of the great stream carrying on so many 
lives”, says Conrad. Though he is no reformer, he can never 
be accused of indifference. ”1 would fain claim for myself the 

faculty of so much insight as can be expressed in a voice of 

55 

sympathy and compassion.” And this sympathy is extended not 
just to those who happen to hold similar beliefs to Gonrad’s 
or who belong to his particular part of society. ’’There is 
not a place of splendour or a dark corner of the earth that 
does not deserve, if only a passing glance of wonder and pity.” ° 
The worst sinners of Conrad’s tales - Verloc, Willems, even 
Kurtz - are treated sympathetically because of the bond uniting 
humanity, coward with hero, scoundrel with saint. Even Heyst

and Decoud, who determine to keep themselves untainted by 
human relationships, sooner or later are caught up by friend¬ 
ship or by love, and both experience a fuller sense of their 
own reality through that union. 

Even Marlow, who remains objective throughout the 
stories he describes, does give actual assistance to those 
who come to him with their problems. It is he who contacts 
Stein about finding a position for Jim, and, not satisfied 
with this, he later goes to Patusan to check on Jim’s success 
there. In Chance , he helps Flora and Anthony to combat the 
opposition of Mrs. Fyne, the captain’s sister, and is even in¬ 
strumental in bringing Powell and Flora together to end her 
long widowhood after Anthony’s heroic death. Of course, 

Marlow’s role in events is only secondary to his part as in¬ 
terpreter and narrator, and he never reaches the heights of 
the hero who sacrifices his very being In sympathetic action, 
but his ’involved objectivity’ is a guide to the sympathy 
Conrad believes indispensable to human happiness. 

Fidelity and sympathy and duty, however, are just 
hollow words without action. Principles, no matter how noble, 
no matter how strong, are worthless unless they are fulfilled 
in action. ’’Work is the law” states Conrad In an essay on 
the tradition of the British Merchant Service. Logical thought 
offers only numerous alternatives, any of which can be dismissed 
by further reflection so that all activity is suspended. Be¬ 
fore a move can be made emotion of some sort must be aroused. 

An act of will is not the result of philosophic deliberation

but an impulse founded usually upon an emotion - of love or 
hatred, of fear or of courage. As long as these impulses 
have at their source one of the simple virtuous ideas like 
loyalty, a sense of duty or of fellowship, they are trust¬ 
worthy, and the hero can rest assured that he has acted upon 
noble instincts regardless of the outcome. The Conradian 
hero, as he appears in the later novels, where he is fully de¬ 
fined and straightforwardly presented, is a man of action. 
Dominic, the sailor in The Arrow of Gold who is M. George’s 
assistant in the smuggling of arms to the Carlists, though 
not the hero of the book, is at least a clear example of the 
ideal man of action with his innate understanding of events 
and emotions and his complete lack of reflective qualities. 

He is absolutely dependable, unquestioning even when he sees 
clearly the pointlessness of their dangerous business. He has 
a taste for adventure and just enough lawlessness and scorn 
for propriety in his character to make him a captivatingly 
romantic figure. 

Unlike Dominic, Peyrol is the central figure of the 
novel in which he appears, but many of their characteristics 
are similar. Peyrol has been a sort of pirate; he is a sailor, 
fearless, reckless when the occasion demands. When he recog¬ 
nizes evil in a situation there is no hesitation in his impulse 
to correct it. He sails out in his little boat to trick the 
whole English fleet in the Mediterranean, certain that he will 
die but proud that he is acting for his native country. Never 
falsely heroic, he shows some annoyance with Real for forcing

63 


him into a situation which can only be solved by his death, 
but, in spite of his desire for peace and retirement, he 
accepts the role of sacrifice simply as his duty and performs 
it with a flourish. 

But the most complex of Conrad f s novels yields for 
our study the most complex man of action, Nostromo. As a 
Genoese sailor working for Captain Mitchell in Costaguana, he 
is called upon to assist during the particular revolution 
dealt with in the novel. Nostromo, along with Decoud, is to 
pilot a lighter of silver from the Gould mine to one of the 
islands in the Golfo Placido where it is to be hidden until 
the rebel forces are driven back from Sulaco. Nostromo, de¬ 
pendable, brave, a leader among the people, is regarded as 
the ideal man for the job. He and Decoud reach the island 
after narrowly avoiding capture by a rebel ship, and Nostromo 
leaves Decoud on guard while he swims back to Sulaco. But 
Decoud cannot withstand the loneliness of the islands and he 
drowns himself weighted down by two silver bars. When the 
political situation calms down once again, Nostromo returns 
to the silver which everyone believes lost at the bottom of 
the bay, and the disappearance of the two bars prevents him, 
for fear of arousing suspicion, from revealing the truth. He 
tries to grow rich slowly, removing the silver piece by piece, 
until he is finally shot accidently by Viola, the lighthouse 
keeper on the island and the father of the girl he loves. 

Conrad describes him in the preface as a Man of the People. 

"In his firm grip on the earth he inherits, in his improvidence

and generosity, in his lavishness with his gifts, in hi 3 

manly vanity, in the obscure sense of his greatness and in 

his faithful devotion with something despairing as well as 

desperate in its impulses, he is a Man of the People, their 

very own unenvious force, disdaining to lead but ruling from 

within.” Later, after the incident of the silver, to which 

Captain Mitchell refers as ”a fatality. A misfortune pure and 
50 

simple”, Nostromo feels that he has been betrayed. Always 
anxious to protect his good name among the people, his aware¬ 
ness of moral ruin robs him of peace and of pride. And though 
he is certainly not completely free of blame, he is the victim 
of two different forces - opposed to each other and each re¬ 
presented by another character in the novel. 

Charles Gould symbolizes material interests, armed 
with the sword of wealth ”double-edged with the cupidity and 

misery of mankind.».tainting the very cause for which it is 
59 

drawn”. Sulaco has benefited from the produce of the mine 
but revolutions are fought because of it, Mrs. Gould is de¬ 
serted, Nostromo and Decoud betrayed and Gould utterly possessed. 
The English '’master of the mine” is an idealist, dreaming of 
bettering the whole world by his efforts to renovate the mine 
that killed his father. Eventually, the responsibility of 
the mine corrupts Goulds judgment so that he loses his sense 
of proportion and becomes a monomaniac, ready to sacrifice 
everything, human or social, for the sake of the mine’s sur¬ 
vival and the abstract justice it symbolizes. No matter how 
idealistic and noble Gould’s intentions may be, the debasing

effect of material wealth finally eats its way into his soul. 
Through his fervent desire that not a bar be lost to Montero, 
the rebel leader, Decoud and Nostromo are sent off to conduct 
the lighter to the island with the fatal results that follow. 

Decoud represents the rival force to material inter¬ 
ests. His ironic dilettantism makes Nostromo uneasy, for he 
is a man unused to criticism of life, who takes his duties and 
those of others seriously, and who accepts his role as leader 
as his just desert. But Decoud is a trifler, an intellectual 
exile who desires no contact with the society he finds so 
ludicrous. He is unattached and cynical until he meets and 
loves Antonia, the most serious and intelligently devoted young 
lady among Conrad 1 s feminine characters, the only individual 

"capable of inspiring a sincere passion in the heart of a 
60 

trifler". Born in Sulaco and raised in Paris, Decoud delights 
in entertaining his Parisian friends by describing the annual 
political eruptions in Costaguana as if they were scenes from 
comic opera. While Gould is bent upon producing more and more 
silver with some abstract idea of aiding humanity, Decoud scorns 
any such activity, preferring rather to "derive an artistic 
pleasure from watching the picturesque extreme of wrong-headed¬ 
ness into which an honest, almost sacred, conviction may drive 
a man".If Decoud had held some such faith as Gould, wrong¬ 
headed as his may be, he might have had some strength against 
the forces of loneliness that drive him to commit suicide, the 
suicide that indirectly betrays Nostromo into doubt and greed. 

At any rate, both Gould and Decoud, by their particular stands

in life, lose touch with reality, and especially with the 
people to whom Nostromo is so close. Abstract ideals on the 
one hand, intellectual detachment on the other, prove false 
guides, not only to those who purposely follow them but to 
others associated with them, their wives, their loves, their 
friends and those who serve them. 

Nostromo, the victim of these guides that lead only 
to inaction or folly, remains, in spite of his bewilderment 
and sense of ruin, a Man of the People, a man whose ideals of 
loyalty and duty are tested and proven in action. Captain 
Mitchell vouches continually for his excellent character• the 
people of Sulaco love him and respect him; old Viola envies 
his adventurous spirit and his liberty. Incidentally, it is 
when Viola f s wife calls for a priest to bless her last living 
moments that Nostromo makes his first error. Because of the 
urgency of the silver 5 s removal, he refuses her request, thus 
allowing the insidious power of the silver to obscure a duty 
that once would have been quite clear to him, so that he for¬ 
feits the utter peace of mind he had once enjoyed. His char¬ 
acteristics, though admirable, are just the ones to make him 
vulnerable before the forces that assail him. First of all h© 
is proud before his people, of his appearance and of his repu¬ 
tation for bravery. His jacket is decorated with silver buttons, 
he wears a silver ring and carries a silver-handled revolver. 

Such a man is surely fair game for the temptation of wealth. 
Secondly, since he has gained a name for courage, he must carry 
out the Englishman^ dangerous plan to remove the silver no

matter how impossible it sounds. Thirdly, so that his repu¬ 
tation may remain unsullied even by the slightest stain, he 
cannot reveal the disappearance of even two bars of the treasure, 
preferring to risk eternal damage to his moral being rather than 
a few months of criticism by gossips. His dependability brings 
him to the attention of Gould as the only man for the job to be 
done. Although Nostromo ! s code is one of action, its strength 
is undermined slowly but surely by the inroads mad© by two ab¬ 
stract ideals. The power of his fidelity, both to those who 
depend upon him and to his own idea of himself, is the virtue 
that directly contributes to his tragedy. His sympathy with the 
people, his bravery and sense of duty, all make him the hero 
of the novel while Decoud and Gould, important as they are, are 
not the heroes but symbols, very realistic indeed, but neverthe¬ 
less symbols of the forces that eventually destroy the hero. 

In every case where Conrad demonstrates, either affirm¬ 
atively or negatively, his ideal of conduct, involving fidelity 
to duty, a sense of responsibility and of sympathy, it is shown 
in action. The uncreative quality of detachment or indolence 
results over and over in actual destruction in contrast to the 
dynamic creative quality of practical ideals. Isolation like 
Heyst*s that causes the death of Lena and himself is redeemed 
by the victory of her sacrifice. Her love has been creative, 
life-affirming, while his chose to deny life by refusing to 
fight for survival, Verloe's laziness is counteracted by his 
wife^ love for her brother, Stevie, a love that, fanatic as it 
may be, at least resembles something creative in its parallel to

mother-love. Jim, though he deserts Jewel by his suicide, 
for so his sacrifice is, feels that only his death can make 
him worthy of her respect and love. Every tragedy bears wit¬ 
ness to some fine quality, either latent or active, in human 
nature, as well as to the tragic waste of evil in human activi¬ 
ty. In spite of evil, in spite of amorality in nature, some 
sort of human progress is possible through the efforts of 
those who recognize the power of simple ideas faithfully fol¬ 
lowed and fulfilled in action. In the form of the novel Conrad 
has succeeded in presenting an ethic that is practical though 
idealistic, realistically aware of barriers but nevertheless 
hopeful. 

The dedication in The Rescue reads: 

To 

Frederic Courtland Penfield 

last ambassador of the United States 
of America to the late Austrian Empire, 
this old-time tale is gratefully in¬ 
scribed in memory of the rescue of 
certain distressed travellers effected 
by him in the world’s great storm of 
the year 1914. 

Besides this inscription, Conrad prefaces Lingard’s story with 
four short paragraphs in praise of all such adventurers, those 
who "belong to history" like Penfield or obscure sailors like 
Lingard whose impulses are no less pure or sympathy no less 
sincere. These few sentences of Conrad’s present the belief 
behind his portraits of the ideal man of action whom Penfield 
represents, " a true adventurer in his devotion to his impulse -

69 


a man of high mind and of pure heart•••He recognized chival¬ 
rously the claims of the conquered; he was a disinterested 
adventurer...Misunderstood and traduced in life, the glory of 
his achievement has vindicated the purity of his motives”. 

The obscure adventurers, "their thoughtless lives guided by 
a simple feeling”, are no less worthy to Conrad, for their 
adventurous spirit, wasted as it may have been upon wrong¬ 
headed causes, has "tinged with romance the region of shallow 

waters and forest-clad islands, that lies far east, and still 

63 

mysterious between the deep waters of two oceans". These 
men are Conrad*s heroes and their lives demonstrate his ideal 
of conduct. 



V. The Rewarding Vision 


In such an attempt as this to organize into a system 
the beliefs and ideals of Joseph Conrad, something of the 
power of his original inspiration is naturally lost. True 
to his avowal that cold formulas are meaningless, a list of 
virtues characteristic of the Conradian hero misses the liv¬ 
ing quality of those virtues as they are seen in action in 
the individual novels. And yet, in spite of the disadvantages 
of over-simplification, such an analysis does bring to light 
the most important facets of Conrad’s art and reveals as well 
the driving force behind his inspiration. By isolating the 
dominant qualities common to the heroes of his novels, by 
noting what Conrad condemns, what he admires and what he for¬ 
gives in their careers, by discovering the significance of 
each of their obscure lives, we hope to have reached some under¬ 
standing of Conrad’s personal goal and his conception of human 
reality. After such an analysis, we may return to the novels 
and read, perhaps, with fuller appreciation and a deeper emo¬ 
tional experience. 

In The Arrow of Gold , a comparatively late novel 
published in 1919, the events related are taken almost directly 
from Conrad’s own career, the period of his life when, as a 
young sailor, he helped smuggle arms by sea to the men fight¬ 
ing to claim the crown of Spain for Don Carlos de Bourbon. 

When the Bohemian friends of the hero. Monsieur George, accuse 
him of disloyalty to their circle, he is defended by an elderly

member of the group In these words. "That fellow is a 
primitive nature, but he may be an artist in a sense. He 
has broken away from his conventions. He is trying to put 
a special vibration and his own notion of colour into his 
life; and perhaps even to give it a modelling according to 
his own ideas. And for all you know he may be on the track 
of a masterpiece; but observe; if it happens to be one nobody 
will see it. It can only be for himself. And even he won't 
be able to see it in its completeness except on his death- 
bed. There is something fine in that." Does not that 
judgment apply equally to each of Conrad's heroes as well as 
to M. George? And is it not especially true of Conrad him¬ 
self? Conrad has "broken away from his conventions" to become 
a sailor and later an English novelist; he tried to fulfill 
his own dreams, "to put a special vibration...into his life", 
to model it "according to his own ideas"; in his fidelity to 
his own beliefs, he has certainly been striving after a 
"masterpiece". We have his novels, the results of that effort, 
as proof of his endeavour, and we can make our own decisions 
about his success. At any rate it seems clear that Conrad 
and his hero are very closely parallel; they may even be one 
and the same person. 

Nevertheless, a few sentences in the mouth of an un¬ 
named character in one of the lesser known novels are hardly 
sufficient evidence that Conrad is to be completely identified 
with his own hero. But that is not the only clue. Conrad's 
statement that "the creator can only explain himself in his

creations” has already been cited. We have seen too how 
his experiences as a child in Poland and as a sailor with the 
British Merchant Service have influenced the subject-matter of 
his novels so that most of the characters are either sailors 
and traders or else anarchists, and his backgrounds are pre¬ 
dominantly seascapes or cities plagued by revolution. 

More significant parallels are to be found between 
the characteristics of the heroes and those of their creator. 
Many are exiles; Conrad too became a voluntary exile, breaking 
ties with his own country in order to be free to give his life 
”a modelling according to his own ideas”. Men like Jim and 
Lingard are brooders and introverts; Conrad’s preoccupation 
with the moral question of fidelity may have amounted to the 
same sort of introspection. The past haunts Razumov, Jim and 
Heyst; there is certainly a good deal of direct evidence, mostly 
in Conrad’s letters, that he suffered from remorse as so many 
of his heroes do. The Conradian hero’s most important act is 
his moral choice; Gonrad’s decision to leave Poland involved 
the conflict of family traditions and patriotism with his per¬ 
sonal dreams of achievement. And finally, no matter what il¬ 
lusions may possess the imagination of the hero, Conrad is 
always aware that he too is vulnerable to the very same obses¬ 
sions. Perhaps Jim’s romanticism or Heyst’s detachment or 
Razumov’s ambitions are the very illusions that he himself has 
served. Above all, both hero and novelist are seeking an ideal 
of conduct, some code of ethics with which to oppose the host¬ 
ility of nature.

Once more Marlow enters the picture as proof or the 
close relationship joining Conrad with his heroes. Because 
he is dealing with emotional experiences that so closely 
resemble his own, Conrad must employ a narrator to achieve 
the artistic distance necessary to a successful novel. Marlow 
provides the desired combination of emotional intensity and 
disinterested sympathy, thus relieving Conrad of the virtually 
impossible task of judging fairly his own mistakes. As we 
investigate the novels for parallels with Conrad*s life, we 
find varying degrees of success. Razumov*s betrayal of Haldin 
in Under Western Eyes may be Conrad*s expression of the emotions 
he felt at his apparent betrayal of Poland and the family tradit¬ 
ions he was expected to carry on, but the narrator*s role in 
that novel is such a weak link in the chain that the novelist*s 
personal abhorrence of revolution and of Russia especially is 
allowed to overflow the boundaries required for an artistic 
balance of subjective opinions with the desired objectivity* 
Nostromo too tells of betrayal and mistaken ideals, some of 
which may have haunted Conrad, but the complications of South 
American politics and the profusion of interesting characters 
tend to obscure the main issue. Lord Jim , however, recognized 
universally as superior, manages to achieve such power because 
of the happy balance between personal emotions and artistic 
distance. We may deduce that the intense reality of Jim*s 
experiences is the direct result of their likeness to Conrad*s 
own emotions, but the strength of Marlow*s personality and the 
firm hold he keeps over everything maintains the balance lost

in Under Western Eyes and obscured in Nostromo. Lord Jim is 
the novel that shows Marlow to best advantage, and it is that 
novel that best accomplishes its purpose. In such a case, 
where the novel*s achievement depends upon the strength or 
weakness of the agent of distance, we cannot be entirely mis¬ 
taken in the identification of hero with artist. 

It should be emphasized here as before that this is 
not a question of finding proof, in Freudian details of plot 
and background, of inhibited drives and guilt-complexes deep 
in the artist*s sub-conscious, but rather a recognition of the 
parallel that exists between the emotional experiences of the 
novelist and the characters with which he peoples his novels. 

It seems natural that even the most disinterested of artists 
would write of the problems he has faced, the crises that have 
stirred him most deeply. But let us compare further the code 
of the Conradian hero with the artistic and ethical philosophy 
of the novelist himself. 

In the discussion about the vices and illusions plaguing 
the Conradian hero, a discovery was made that all these faults 
tended to separate the hero from society, that Is from the 
real society of human fellowship. Ambition for material gain, 
intellectually-induced detachment, impractical idealism, greed, 
indolence, - all the characteristic flaws cause a separation 
of the hero from his real vocation in society. They are all 
savage or anti-social vices. The Ideal hero, on the other hand, 
possesses the social virtues of fidelity, sympathy, and a sense 
of responsibility. Rather than indulging in unproductive 
























.

reflection, he acts, and always in the name of society. Now, 
art too is a social activity. No matter how independent of 
public attention the artist may be, he is producing for a 
particular audience, whether it actually exists or not. He 
creates in words, harmonies, or colour patterns that are sig¬ 
nificant to other people. Conrad 1 s profession as a novelist, 
therefore, is just as much a contribution to society as Jim's 
activities in Patusan or Heyst T s assistance to Morrison and 
Lena. 

Not only are the efforts of both Conrad and his hero 
concerned with society and human fellowship, but the virtues 
governing the hero's life are very similar to those required 
in the artist's. Conrad f s ideal of conduct applies equally 
well to artistic creator and created, to life on a sailing 
ship or a career writing successful novels. First of all, 
Conrad demands from his hero living beliefs and ideals in 
place of dead formulas. Coldly intellectual standards like 
Heyst T s and Decoud ! s, untested idealism like Jim ! s, the conven¬ 
tions of a false society, any of these prove untenable in 
practice, resulting only in destruction and betrayal. Parallel 
to the hero ! s rejection of such hollow faith is Conrad's in¬ 
sistence that the novelist be free from literary schools and 
creeds, for they all, Realism, Naturalism, Romanticism, are 

only the ”temporary formulas of his craft” and will eventually 

66 

abandon him ”even on the very threshold of the temple”. 

Secondly, Conrad asks sympathy of his hero, a real de¬ 


sire to take part in the lives of others, to help the unfortunate.

76 


or at least to try to understand the misled. Similarly, the 

preface to Conrad's very first novel, Almayer 1 s Folly , states 

in these words his own attitude. "I am content to sympathize 

67 

with common mortals no matter where they live.” His intention, 
the prevailing atmosphere of every novel, and the relationship 
of hero with novelist emphasize Conrad's sincere effort to un¬ 
derstand the faults and mistakes of even the most obscure, and, 
because of that understanding, to sympathize. The 'task* of 

writing novels, like life in any community, requires ’’the spirit 

68 

of love for mankind”. Even when he is making stern judgments 
upon villains like Kurtz or weaklings like Willems, Conrad 
never preaches from the lofty heights of the righteous moralist. 
He is too aware of universal human folly to be so superior. 
Sympathy unites him with all his heroes, strong or weak, just 
as it guides Lingard, Peyrol, and especially Marlow. 

The ideal attitude of enlightened sympathy results in 
the ideal action of performing one's duty to society. Since 
Conrad's ethic has at its foundation the concept of action, all 
the rest of his ideals are meaningless unless they result in 
actual deeds - either as duties performed by the hero or as 
works created by the artist. In the novels, Lingard acts to 
rescue Mr. Travers from the Malays, Peyrol, to save Real for 
Arlette, Razumov, to clear his own conscience and to enlighten 
Natalia Haldin; and the fact of the hero'3 acting is the only 
proof we have of his professed ideals and his excellent intent¬ 
ions. By acting in the name of the human bond, the hero makes 
a vow of his faith in the ideal for which he searches. Love

like Lena's, endurance like Captain MacWhirr f a, a sense of 
duty like Peyrol's, such traits make a real contribution to 
progress. And in the same way that these characters employ 
their gifts in the universal struggle against the chaos of 
nature and the evil of illusion, Conrad wields his genius to 
produce works of art. In The Mirror of the Sea , he defines 
the parallel. ’’An artist is a man of action, whether he creates 
a personality, invents an expedient, or finds the issue of a 
complicated situation.' 1 The temperament characteristic of 
Conrad 1 s ideal man of action must combine ”a fierceness of con¬ 
ception with a certitude of execution upon the basis of just 

f’Q 

appreciation of means and ends". Whether the man revealing 
such a wonderful balance of inspiration, action and judgment 
be a sailor, a police inspector or a novelist is immaterial. 

What matters is the resultant action. 

It is evident then that the resemblance of hero and 
artist covers their emotional biographies, their code of ethics, 
the evils they must avoid and the ideals to which they must 
cling, and even their intentions to make a ’'masterpiece'* of 
their lives. Above all, both Conrad and the composite hero of 
his novels are searching for self-knowledge, forced by the 
hostility of nature into making choices and decisions that 
eventually produce a code of ethics. This code, that applies 
equally well to student, sea-captain and artist is a systematic 
one that can be reduced by analysis to a few abstract nouns 
like fidelity, duty and sympathy, and yet, since it has been 
achieved, not by logical thought, not by induction as it were,

78 


but by an emotional involvement in practical affairs, it is 
worthless as long as it remains on the level of the ideal¬ 
istic catch-phrase. Until it results in action it is still 
at the furthest pole from Conrad's intention. 

Conrad's most direct statement of his aesthetic is 
found in the preface to The Nigger of the Narcissus . Most 
of the author's notes are concerned, at least in part, with 
the intention of the particular story they accompany, or with 
the circumstances of the tale's appearance, but the one before 
The Nigger is the most complete and systematic statement of 
his conception of art. In addition, this preface was written 
at the same time as the tale itself in contrast to the majority 
which were written later, between 1917 and 1920, for the uni¬ 
form edition of his work published by Dent's. The Nigger , 
completed in 1897, was published first in December of the same 
year and, since the foreword was also written in 1897, it should 
therefore be truer to Conrad's intentions in that story than 
the retrospective ones written ten years or more after the 
novel or tale they preface. Maybe some of the same inspiration 
that produced that excellent tale entered into the more theor¬ 
etical statement of the artist's aesthetic philosophy. At any 
rate, these few paragraphs are just one more proof of the close 
relationship uniting Conrad's artistic and ethical ideals into 
an integral whole. A brief discussion of the contents of that 
preface should reveal this union. 

The purpose of art as Conrad sees it is to render jus¬ 
tice to the visible universe by revealing its truth, the truth 
of existence itself which is to be found in every form of nature.

79 


no matter how obscure• By abandoning external formulas and 
concentrating instead upon giving a voice to the obscure on 
every level of life, the artist hopes to make his reader see. 
Simply that. To see the truth that exists in even the low¬ 
liest is perhaps to understand, and by understanding to for¬ 
give. This truth, that is to be found in the lives of ordinary 
men like the sailors aboard the Narcissus , or the traders in 
Eastern ports, can be revealed by the artist who persuades us 
to turn our gaze for a moment upon these lives, and, through 
our interest, to make us aware of the solidarity of all man¬ 
kind. The thinker or the scientist, in their attempts to re¬ 
veal the truth of existence, appeal to our common sense and 
our intelligence with ideas or facts. The artist, however, 
uses different material to achieve his purpose. "Confronted 
by the same enigmatical spectacle, the artist descends within 
himself, and in that lonely region of stress and strife, if he 
be deserving and fortunate, he finds the terms of his appeal." 

The conflicts in his own soul are pressed into service to speak 
to our emotions rather than to our intelligence, to our eternal 
sense of pity and mystery rather than to "the changing wisdom 
of generations", and especially to our "conviction of solid- 

„ 70 

arity that knits together the loneliness of innumerable lives”. 

It is this bond to which the artist appeals and according to 
which the hero must conduct his life. 

At all times, Conrad insists that art reaches our 
emotions and temperament by addressing itself to the senses. 

He uses words like sight, feelings and sensations when he speaks 



















*

. 



















80 


of aesthetics rather than abstracts like apprehension, 

thought or reflection. Faithful to his belief in concrete 

action before abstract logic and in men before untested 

ideals, Conrad carries on this attitude to his literary 

theorizing by insisting upon the appeal of art to the senses 

of sight, touch and hearing. 

In order to accomplish his purpose of the revelation 

of truth, it is the artist f s task to give new meaning and 

persuasion to old words. Of Chance , Conrad says, f1 In doing 

this book, my intention was to interest people in my vision 

of things which is indissolubly allied to the style in which 
71 

it is expressed'’. Thus, the particular tone that each artist 
gives the old words he uses depends upon his individual inspir¬ 
ation, his particular way of looking at things. Just as the 
hero acts according to his ideals, the artist creates according 
to his f vision ? . This word, Vision’, is a very important one 
for Conrad in his description of the artistic process. Beneath 
the multiple appearances of the universe lies a single truth, 
a truth which appears to the artist, whether by force of in¬ 
spiration or imagination or insight, in a moment of vision. 
Marlow experiences such a vision in Youth when he catches his 
first glimpse of the romantic East at the end of the Judea * s 
catastrophic voyage. The triumph of finally reaching port 
after the heart-breaking failures of that journey, turns his 
first sight of his goal into a moment of revelation, a vision 
of youth. Peyrol, at the end of his life, "smiled to his visions 
and died", for it is this vision of "the days of his manhood,

72 

of strength, and adventure" that makes it impossible for 
him to neglect an opportunity to perform his duty, to sacrifice 
something to the ideal of conduct by which he has tried to live* 
Less fortunate than Peyrol, who seems to have been guided most 
of his life by such commendable ideals of fellowship and ser¬ 
vice, other of Conrad 1 s heroes mu3t watch their particular 
visions being proven and often discarded by the tests nature 
provides, Jim’s romanticism is tried on the Patna and found 
wanting in backbone, Prom then on he is condemned by his own 

personality to wander until events offer him an ”opportunity 

73 

which, like an Eastern bride, had come veiled to his side" . 

At that moment Jim is acting under the influence of a vision, 
that of an ideal of conduct that he is at last able to fulfill. 
Heyst and Heal, like Jim, have to experience life more deeply 
before they are rewarded by such a revelation. It takes Lena’s 
murder and Peyrol ! s death to make these men aware of the truth 
they have been neglecting all their lives. Unable to reach a 
satisfactory solution to life’s problems by reflection, they 
find the answer tragically obvious in emotional experiences like 
those in Victory and The Rover , experiences that replace their 
inadequate ideals by glorious visions of truth. 

Without the supra-national drive contributed by such 
inspiration, the most admirable code of ethics would be almost 
impossible to follow. In Conrad’s vision of things, belief in 
the single truth revealed in the multiplicity of experience is 
paralleled by the recognition of the bond uniting mankind in 
sympathy. This vision leads him - as it does his hero - to act 
























«

82 


in an effort to make visible to everyone what he, because of 
his gift, can see. 

Returning to the preface of The Nigger , we find Conrad 
has included his theory of vision. He says there that, by 
using the conflicts of obscure lives to appeal to the emotions 
of the audience, an artist may call up not only the hard facts 
of those lives but the moral and emotional atmosphere of time 
and place. These elements, far more significant than mere de¬ 
tails, may afford the reader a moment of vision. The aim of 
the artist, illogical and shadowy as it may be, is merely to 
compel men "to glance for a moment at the surrounding vision of 
form and colour, of sunshine and shadows"; and if that task is 
accomplished, "beholdi - all the truth of life is there; a 
moment of vision, a sigh, a smile - and the return to an eter¬ 
nal rest". 74 

Once the artist is sure of the purpose he wishes to 

accomplish, the audience to which he appeals, and the method 

he is to use, only his attitude remains to be determined. To 

Conrad, in the preface, that detail is all-important for he 

contends that it is the artist’s sincerity of endeavour to carry 

out his creative task that justifies all the effort. This idea 

that it is the intention, not the result, that counts is borne 

out in one of his letters to Edward Garnett that discusses this 

very preface. He states there his desire to convey "the opinion 

that in art alone there is a meaning in endeavour as apart from 
75 

success". And although Conrad singles out art as the only 
activity wholly justified by the virtue of the intention, there 























.

83 


is in most of his novels evidence that he would apply that 
belief to life as well. The paragraph that ends the preface 
to Chance contains these sentences. "And it is only for their 
intentions that men can be held responsible. The ultimate 

76 

effects of whatever they do are far beyond their control." 
Lingard meant to do good by aiding Mrs. Travers, and thus far 
he cannot be blamed for the final destruction; Heyst intended 
to rescue Lena from the cruelty and evil that surrounded her 
in Zangiacomo ! s orchestra. Of course, Lingard allows selfish 
dreams to confuse his sense of duty, and Heyst 1 s philosophy 
of isolation prevents him from, playing his role of saviour 
successfully. Such is the tragedy of human limitation. The 
varying levels of Conrad^ attitude to his heroes bear witness 
to the mixed quality of even the noblest purpose. But, while 
every hero can be condemned for some weakness, Conrad still 
insists that we search for the good intention behind his actions, 
the sincere endeavour to produce good that redeems him in spite 
of the outcome. 

In pleading indulgence for the unintentional mistakes 
of his hero, Conrad includes himself and his work. Both he 
and his hero are perfectly sincere in their endeavours, and 
their sincerity must be recognized whether they succeed or not 
in revealing to us their vision. At any rate, the parallel is 
complete between artist and hero, that is, insofar as one in¬ 
dividual can be identified with another, for "life is life and 
77 

art is art", and Conrad is as separate from Jim as a real man 
must be from a character in a novel, as creator must be from

creature. Yet Jim and Lingard and Heyst and all the rest 
have taken form out of the mistakes and successes, the fears 
and the dreams of Conrad himself. They cannot, on that account, 
be far different. And, furthermore, without them, Conrad is 
inaccessible. In writing of them he is expressing his own 
emotions. Through them he condemns folly and delusion. 

Through them he presents his ideals, and through them he hopes 
to reveal his own vision. Without the hero, who fails and 
strives and, above all, acts, the artist*3 beliefs remain un¬ 
attainable, incomprehensible abstracts. "Life is a thing of 
form," says the teacher of languages to Natalia Haldin. "It 
has Its plastic shape and a definite intellectual aspect. The 
most idealistic conceptions of love and forebearance must be 

clothed in flesh as it were before they can be made understand- 
78 

able." The novelist, like any artist, renders his ideals 
into form so that he shows them in living conflict with other 
forces and by these tests proves their power. The Conradian 
hero, composed as he is from the qualities of each novel, is 
our surest guide to Conrad himself and to the vision of truth 
that is his inspiration.
