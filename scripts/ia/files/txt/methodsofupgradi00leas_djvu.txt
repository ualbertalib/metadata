METHODS FOR UPGRADING SOME ALBERTA COALS 


General Introduction 

The Province of Alberta has large reserves of coal^ ) 
ranging in rank, according to the A.S.T.M. Coal Classification System^), 
from semi-anthracite through the bituminous and subbituminous coals to 
lignite. The higher rank coals occur in the mountain and foothill 
regions of Alberta, the rank progressively decreasing with the distance 
from the mountains and in a line roughly parallel to the mountain range. 
The extent of coalification apparently has been due more to the 
pressures exerted laterally during the upthrust which resulted in the 
formation of the Rocky Mountains than to the geological age of the coal 
beds. Generally speaking, coals appear in three distinct geological 
horisons, namely, the Edmonton, the Belly River and the Blairmore- 
Kootenay( 4 ). The first two horisons are in the Upper Cretaceous and 
the third in the Lower Cretaceous, 

For analytical details of the composition and for the 
characteristics of the various coals in the several districts of the 
three formations, reference should be made to Report $35 of the Research 
Council of Alberta, For ready references, however, Alberta coals have 
been placed in five main groups (2) which are briefly; 

Group I - Low volatile, non-coking, bituminous coals from 
mountain areas. 

Group II - High volatile, coking, bituminous coals from mountain 


areas

Group III - Subbituminou® coals, principally from the foothill® 

areas* 

Group IV - Domestic coals possessing fair storage properties, 
from the prairies* 

Group V - Domestic coals possessing poor storage properties, 
from the prairies* 

Plate I shows the distribution of the coals in the Province according 
to their position in the separate groups* 

The generalization that the rank of the coals decreases 
progressively according to their distance from the mountain barrier 
cannot be interpreted too literally. Plate I shows that in the 
Mountain Park, Oldman and Crowsnest areas the coals are essentially 

of a coking type whereas those in the Highwood, Cascade, Mordegg and 

' 

Brule areas are non-coking low volatile coals. The geographic 
distribution of the coking coals is naturally of considerable economic 
importance and attention is drawn to it at this early stag® since in 
the experimental work on briquetting described later in this thesis, 
eoals of a coking nature have been used to a considerable extent. 

Mot only do the coking qualities of the various coals differ 
according to the Provincial districts in which they are mined but also 
their physical characteristics. Those coals which were subjected to 
the greatest disturbance during the mountain building period are much 
more fractured and friable than coals in the less disturbed areas, 
i.e. the plains* In many of the former cases, bands of slat© and shale 
have become so intimately mixed with the coals that separation in the

actual course of mining is impossible* On the other hand most of the 
coal seams in the prairies lie in a relatively undisturbed condition* 
They commonly contain lenses or bands of clay and shale which can be 
readily discarded during mining* In other instance, however, shale 
and clay become invariably mixed with the coal during mining operations* 
Whilst coals occur in Alberta which are suitable for most 
domestic and industrial purposes, the tonnage actually mined is 
naturally limited by the available markets* The Province of Alberta is 
distant from the more thickly populated and industrialised eastern 
areas of Canada and the cost of transportation, therefore, becomes an 
exceedingly important factor in considering the marketing of Alberta 
coals. Within the Province, there are very large reserves of natural 
gas which continues to displace coal largely owing to its availability 
of supply, cleanliness in operation and the ease with which the 
quantity used can be controlled automatically in both domestic and 
industrial processes of utilization* With the development of hydro¬ 
electric power in the Province, the electrical distribution systems 
are being extended and accordingly there are cases in which local 
power plants burning slack coal have been closed owing to ample supplies 
of electricity being made available which is cheaper or which for other 
reasons is preferable to use. The generation of hydroelectric power 
and its wider distribution, as well as a marked tendency for coal 
consumers to favor oil fuels, has heightened the interests of the 
colliery industry in the problems associated with the improvement or 
upgrading of solid fuels, both for domestic and industrial purposes*

By the term "upgrading of coal" I refer to any process whereby 
a higher quality of coal can be obtained. Upgrading may include the 
preparation of a better sized product! a product substantially free from 
fine material! or a product with a higher heat value or improved coking 
or combustion characteristics. Thus coal may be upgraded during its 
mining, its preparations for the market or by further processing after 
it leaves the colliery premises. 

In the work described in this thesis, studies have been made 
of three methods of upgrading coals, namely, upgrading by coal washing, 
upgrading by briquetting with a suitable binding agent and upgrading by 
briquetting followed by a process of low temperature carbonization. 

For these studies the following coals have been used: 

(a) Drumheller coal - for washing and for briquetting followed 
by low temperature carbonization. 

(b) Camrose coal - for briquetting followed by low temperature 
carbonization. 

(c) Mordegg coal - for washing and for briquetting. 

(d) Luscar coal - for briquetting. 

(e) Crowsnest coal and Mountain Park coal - for blending purposes 
in briquetting followed by low temperature carbonization. 

In the Drumheller area, of the Edmonton formation, which is 
one of the principal mining districts of Alberta, the coals fall into 
Group IV, that is to say, these coals are high volatile subbituminous 
coals of high moisture and oxygen contents entirely devoid of coking 
properties. According to Report jf 13 of the Research Council of 
Alberta( 5 ), there appear to be three principal seams which have been 
worked at all extensively in this area, namely, the Drumheller seam.

Seam No* 1; Seam No. 2; and the Top or Newcastle seam. Seam No. 5. 

The seam source of the Drumheller coal used in the experimental 
work was not known but since the coal came from the Midland Mine, it is 
assumed that probably the coal was at least principally from the Drum- 
heller or No. 1 seam. This seam is divided into two portions by a band 
of bentonite which varies in thickness from one inch to twenty inches. 

In some cases the bentonite band is underlain by a band of bone or coaly 
bone or hard granular coal. In certain mines the band is too wide to 
warrant its extraction and the lower bench of coal is left in the mine. 

The coal above the bentonite, varying in thickness from five 
feet to six feet four inches contains, in places, one or more bands 
of bentonite and in some cases, a band of bone separates the coal from 
the roof whilst in other cases a lense of coal appears between the 
bone and the true roof. Occasionally the roof is soft and coal may be 
left for roof support. 

It will be obvious, therefore, that the coal as mined may 
contain considerable amounts of clay impurities deriving not only 
possibly from the roof and floor of the seam but also from the 
bentonite bands. 

The coal is bright in appearance when it is mined, but on 
exposure to the air the surfaces quickly assume a dull appearance. 

The moisture content of the coal is about sixteen per cent and the 
ash content varies widely. Slacking, as shown by numerous cracks 
on the surface, also takes place on exposure to the air but this 
type of coal does not disintegrate easily and with reasonable care in 
handling the amount of slack is low. There are local areas where the

coal is finer and in some cases rusty, but generally these areas are 
avoided in mining. The coal appears to contain gray translucent and 
transparent crystals of selenite or gypsum along its oleavage faces 
which, whilst not lowering the value of the coal for most purposes, 
frequently is responsible for a dull gray lustre on the coal blocks 
when mined. 

In the Camrose area there are several coal seams throughout 
the Edmonton formation^) containing coals which belong to Group V, 
that is to say, high volatile subbituminous coals of high moisture 
and oxygen contents which will not store well. The seam source of 
the Camrose coal used is not known but the eoal was obtained from a 
strip pit with an overburden of approximately twenty-five feet; the 
seam was approximately five feet in thickness• The coal was obtained 
from a fresh stripping section. 

In the Hordegg area, the coals belong to the Blairmore- 
Kootenay formation and are classified as Group I coals, that is to 
say, low volatile non-coking friable bituminous coals. The seams are 
found above a band of conglomerate. According to Report #34 of the 
Research Council of Alberta, there appear to be two principal seams 
mined, namely Ho. 2 Seam and Ho. 3 Seam which are six feet and 
thirteen feet thick respectively. 

The only information available regarding the Luscar coal 
is that it belongs to Group I. 

The coal formation in the Mountain Park area contains high 
volatile coking bituminous coals, that is to say, the coals fall in 
Group II. There are at least five seams in this formation but only

two of them are important, each varying in thickness from about twenty- 
five feet to fifty feet* 

Coals from the Crowsnest area fall in Group II* The 
formation here varies in thickness from five hundred and eighty feet 
to eight hundred feet and contains at least five seams of which only 
two are mined at any one place* The International Coal and Coke 
Company which supplied the Crowsnest coal works only the No* 2 and 
No. 4 seams. The former seam is approximately fourteen and one half 
feet thick and the latter nine feet thick.

SECTION I 


UPGRADING BY COAL WASHING 



- 8 - 

Upgrading by Coal Washing 

Coal washing consists of the separation of the shaly and 
other mineral impurities from coals and is dependent upon differences 
in specific gravity of the two types of material. In practice, though 
some processesoperate with solutions or dispersions of the 
appropriate specific gravity, more generally a similar effect is 
obtained by either imparting to the mass of water, through which the 
raw coal undergoing treatment is passing, a rapid upward movement 
followed by a slow downward movement (the principle of the Jig washer) 
or causing the water to flow upward at such a velocity that the 
particles of coal pass upwards with the water whereas the particles 
of impurity, due to their higher specific gravity, fall against the 
flow of water (the principle of the upward current classifier). In 
the former case the coal undergoing treatment is generally supported 
in its passage through the Jig washer on a screen placed fairly near 
the surface of the water; in this way the material stratifies and 
the heavier impurity, forming the lower layer in the stratified mass, 
can be readily separated from the coal by the provision of a gate 
placed at a suitable point to separate the stratified mass into 
clean coal and rejected material. In the upward current classifier, 
of course, the coal is actually floated off in the upward flowing 
current of water whilst the shale falling against the current is 
readily rejected. The methods of separation which apply in these two 
washers are applied together in such plants as the rheolaver. 















- 9 - 


In controlling the operation of coal washing plants it is 
customary to carry out within the laboratory tests which are called 
washability tests. The coals, being tested, are separated into 
different fractions by using solutions of suitable and known specific 
gravities. In order to cover an appropriate range of specific gravity, 
mixtures of carbon tetrachloride (specific gravity 1,60) and a special 
petroleum distillate (specific gravity 0,74) or toluene (specific 
gravity 0.87) are used. The material which has a specific gravity 
greater than that of the solution used is known as "sinks” and the 
lighter material which floats is known as ”flouts”. In the divided 
sample method the "sinks” and "floats” are separately recovered and 
their weights from a known weight of coal treated are ascertained. 

In the unit sample method the coal being tested is placed in the 
solution having the lowest specific gravity, the '’floats” are 
separated while the "sinks” are then treated in the next solution 
of higher specific gravity and the process repeated until the whole 
series of treatment is completed* The weights of the fractions 
obtained from a known weight of sample can be determined. The ash 
contents of the different fractions, obtained by either method, are 
then determined. All the tests were carried out by the unit sample 
method in the Kemp and Thomson Float and Sink Apparatus(®) using 
mixtures of carbon tetrachloride and a special petroleum distillate. 

Many methods have been proposed for the interpretation of 
float and sink data. Of these, two have been selected, namely those 
described by R.C. Brewer(®) and B*M* respectively. The 

former method is used to ascertain the feasibility of satisfactory 
washing the Drumheller slack coal; the latter is especially referred to 
in discussing the coal washing operations of the Brazeau Cleaning Plant.

Drumheller Slack Coal 

A screen analysis was made on the slack coal as obtained from 
the Midland Coal Company and each fraction thus obtained was used for 
the washability tests. The data obtained with each separate fraction 
are given in Table 1» 

Cumulative data are compiled from the test data. The 

cumulative value for the ash contents of the ”floats” is calculated by 

using the weights and ash contents of the separate “floats" up to the 

point in question. Thus* for the fraction larger than l/2” at a 

specific gravity of 1.40 there are 78.5 parts of “floats” containing 

4.64 per cent ash and 12,4 parts of "floats” containing 12,3 per cent ash 

or 90,9 parts of “floats" containing (78*5 x 4.64) * (12.4 x 12,3) = 

90.9 

5.68 per cent ash. The cumulative ash in the “sinks” is determined 
similarly. 

To calculate the percentage loss of combustible matter, it 
is assumed that the total amount of combustible matter in the raw 
coal fraction larger than l/2” is 100 - 9,3 * 90,7 parts, 9.3 being 
the ash content of this fraction. Therefore, at any particular yield, 
the loss of combustible matter is equal to the total combustible, matter 
in the raw coal less the combustible matter recovered at that yield. 

In 90.9 parts of "floats”, at a specific gravity of 1.40, the combust¬ 
ible matter recovered is 90.9 - (90.9 x 5.7 ) =* 85.7 parts. The loss 

too 

of combustible matter is therefore 90.7 - 85.7 or 5,0 parts which 
correspond to 5.5 per cent. Other values are calculated in the 


same manner

On the "washability curves” constructed from data in Table I 
(Figures I to V inclusive) the percentage yields, corresponding to 
each solution employed are indicated by perpendicular dotted lines. 

The “washability curves” of the unscreened sample (Figure V) 
indicate that with efficient operation of a coal cleaning plant it 
should be possible to obtain a product representing 87 per cent of the 
coal treated and having an ash content of 6.8 per cent as compared to 
13.0 per cent for the raw coal. The separation should correspond with 
the treatment of a solution of 1.50 specific gravity. Moreover, 
Figures I-IV inclusive indicate that treating the different sized 
fractions with a solution of 1.50 specific gravity, reduces the ash 
content considerably and yet gives a good yield. Kconomlcally, the 
optimum point for the separation of clean coal depends upon the yield 
of clean coal and its ash content and the loss of relatively clean 
saleable coal in the rejected material. This point lies somewhere 
between the points where the ash in the float curve and the loss of 
combustible matter curve commence to increase, that is to say, in the 
neighborhood of 85 per cent yield. (Figure V). 

The percentage yield indicated between the two dotted 
”specific gravity” lines shows the amount of material whose specific 
gravity is between these limits, and therefore the position of these 
lines is a representation of the specific gravity distribution of 
the coal. Where these gravity lines are close together, favorable 
cleaning possibilities are indicated because of the small amount of 
material having a specific gravity approximately the same as that 
used for the separation. In all five cases, the gravity lines 1.45

and 1.50 lie close together which confirms the above conclusion regard¬ 
ing the point of separation. 

The Braseau Cleaning Plant 

The run of mine coal* a mixture from the Ho. 2 and Ho. 3 
seams in the Mordegg district (page 6), is fed to the screens of the 
cleaning plant where it is divided into 3 fractions, namely* coal below 
l/4”, coal between l/4” and 3/4”, and coal larger than 3/4”. The 
fraction below l/4”, i.e. the dust and fine coal, which has an ash 
content of approximately 16j£ is not cleaned at all but goes directly 
to storage for briquetting. The fraction between l/4 fl and 3/4” is 
cleaned on air-tables and the cleaned product then passes directly to 
the briquetting plant. Coal larger than 3/4“ is cleaned in a Vissac 
Jig, dried and sold. 

(a) Fraction l/4 w to 3/4” - Treatment on Air-Tables 

Composite samples of the raw coal fed to the air-tables and 
of the cleaned coal and the refuse were obtained and washability 
tests carried out on all three samples. All the observed and 
calculated data for this series are contained in Table II. 

The method used for the interpretation of the sink and float 
data is that described by B.M. Bird in Report of Investigations $3012. 
United States Department of Interior, Bureau of Mines. In this method 
the percentage “float” is plotted against the percentage cumulative 
ash, the percentage elementary ash and the specific gravity of the 
solutions used respectively. The elementary ash is the ash content 
of the highest-ash particle included in a “float” fraction at any 
given cumulative weight percentage. The two methods for interpreting

float and sink data have been used in this thesis to illustrate the 
point that the choice of method used for interpretation depends upon 
the information desired. 

The cumulative ash curve and the elementary ash curve are 
calculated from the test data. The elementary ash curve shows the rate 
of change of the ash content at different yields but it must be pointed 
out that this is only a convenient approximation atod not a mathematically 
exact method. 

The calculation of the elementary ash curve is based on the 
assumption that all the float particles are arranged in order of 
increasing ash content. It is obvious that every particle of the 
run-of-mine coal fed to the air-table which has a specific gravity less 
than 1.35 does not contain exactly 3,5 per cent ash, that is to say, the 
ash content of the floated material. Since the average ash content of 
all the particles included in the range from 0.0 to 39.5 per cent 
cumulative weight is 3,6 per cent, all those particles below 19.75 
per cent cumulative weight contain less than 3,6 per cent ash and all 
those above contain more than 3.6 per cent ash* Thus a particle at 
19.75 per cent cumulative weight should contain 3.6 per cent ash which 
is the first point on the curve. Table II shows that a particle having 
a specific gravity of exactly 1.40 is at a point 10.5 per cent higher 
than a particle with a specific gravity of 1.35 or at the cumulative 
weight of 50.0 per cent. The particles in this fraction have an 
average ash content of 7.5 per cent and the cumulative weight per cent 
corresponding to 7.5 per cent elementary ash is 39.5 + 10.5 * 44.7 

~T 

which gives us the second point on the curve. A rule for determining

points on the elementary ash curve from sink and float data may be 
expressed as* 

"One half of the "weight per cent" of the specific-gravity 
interval involved, plus the "cumulative weight, per cent" of 
all material of lower specific gravity, is plotted against the 
ash content (not cumulative ash) of the specific gravity 
interval involved." 

From Figure VI, it can be seen that with 100 per cent 
efficiency it might be possible to obtain a product representing 77 
per cent of the feed and having an ash content of 9.7 per cent as 
compared to 18.2 per cent for th© feed, if cleaning were done to an 
equivalent specific gravity of 1.56. This product would contain no 
pieces of coal with an ash content exceeding 30 per cent (elementary 
ash curve). With no two yields for successive gravity solutions 
close together, the results indicate that a clean separation at ary- 
specific gravity is not practical. 

Figure VII shows the results of th© tests on the cleaned 
coal. Large scale cleaning cannot be 100 per cent efficient and the 
equivalent specific gravity of the table setting is not known; but 
nearly 15 per cent of this product had a gravity above 1.56 and an 
ash content of 43 per cent. 

Figure VIII illustrates the results obtained on the refuse 
which contained approximately 15 per cent with a gravity lighter than 

1.56. 

Figures VII and VIII confirm the above conclusion regarding 
the difficulty in obtaining a sharp separation.

(b) Fraction Larger than 3/4” - Treatment in Vissac Jig 

Although the Vissao Jig was installed to handle only coal 
larger than 3/4”, in actual operation it handles a small amount of 
finer coal because some of the lumps, too large to pass through even 
the largest opening in the vibrating screen, are subsequently crushed, 
and all this coal goes to the jig without further screening. 

Table III contains all the data for samples of the raw coal, 
the cleaned coal and the refuse leaving the Vissac Jig. 

As in the former case. Figure IX shows that the specific 
gravity distribution for this coal is such as to make economical 
washing impracticable. Working to a specific gravity of 1*66 in 
this case would only give a theoretical yield of ©3 per cent which 
appears to b© too low for economic operation. 

The result® of the examinations of the separated fractions 
from the Jig show that the separation is not sharp; 18.5 per cent of 
the cleaned product had a specific gravity greater than 1.56 and 
13.5 per cent of the refuse had a specific gravity less than 1.50.

Conclusion 

Since no two coals are alike, differing in the nature and 
amount of removable and non-removable mineral matter, every coal 
presents its own cleaning problem. The washabillty tests indicate 
that a good separation of clean coal and refuse is possible with 
Drumheller slack coal but not with Nordegg coal. 




SECTION 2 


BRIQUETTING WITH A SUITABLE 


BINDING AGENT 



- 28 - 


Briquetting with a Suitable Binding Agent 


Briquetting is recognized as a practicable method of convert¬ 
ing much of what is now considered unusable fuel, because of its 
fineness of division, into a clean lump fuel for domestic and industrial 
purposes. Briquetting consists of mixing with graded coal a suitable 
amount of binder, either in a crushed or molten condition, heating the 
mass and then pressing it into briquettes. 

Figures XII and XIII, showing the yearly production of 
briquettes in Alberta and the United States respectively, indicate 
the rapid expansion which has taken place in the briquetting industry 
since about 1939. 

Some of the important factors in briquetting may be 
summarized as follows: 

(a) The slack coal should be as clean as possible. A high ash 
content requires a greater percentage of binder, because the binder 
does not adhere well to slate or to other similar high ash materials. 

(b) The binder should be well dispersed so that all the voids of 
the finely divided coal are more or less completely filled in. A 
minimum quantity of asphaltic binder in a proper compounded mixture 
produces a strong weatherproof briquette. 

(c) The briquettes should satisfy the following requirements: 

(1) they should be of maximum density 

(2) they should be strong enough to withstand handling and 


transportation

(3) they should be smooth and regular in shape* Sharp 
edges are readily broken off in handling. 

(4) they should retain their shape and not disintegrate 
during storage or combustion 

(5) the heat value of the original coal should not be 

decreased 

(6) the ash content should not be increased. Inorganic 
binders of high mineral matter content such as lime, clay, sulfur, 
calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, cement, etc. increase the 
mineral content of the briquettes without suitable compensation for 
the increased ash by providing a better or cheaper binder. 

(7) all the desirable characteristics of the raw coal should 
at least be retained if not enhanced. 

A "binder” as referred to in coal briquetting is any 
substance which is capable of binding fine materials to one another 
and which does not interfere with the attainment of any desirable 
physical properties in the briquette. A special petroleum asphalt 
is used more extensively than any other binding medium in coal 
briquetting in America. This asphalt, which is tough and hard when 
cold and yet possesses the properties of adhesiveness and stickiness, 
has a low viscosity and is almost as fluid as water when heated above 
its softening point. For all the studies made on some phases of 
briquetting, which are described later, a special petroleum asphalt 
or briquette binder ms supplied by Imperial Oil Compaq. It had 
the following specifications:

Effect of Pressure on the Density of Briquettes 

As a preliminary measure in order to permit experiments to 
be made with relatively small amounts of coal and to increase the 
number of experiments which could be made in a limited time a small 
briquetting mould was designed, as illustrated in Figure XI¥. The 
different parts of the mould indicated on this figure are described 
below? 

The base of shaft (a) was 5 3/4" diameter and 1” thick. 

A hole 2 M diameter and 3/8“ deep was cut to hold the shaft. 

The shaft was 2” diameter and 3 5/4“ long. 

A block of wood (B) 2 3/8“ in length was used to support 
the collar (C) until the briquetting mixture had been placed in the 
mould and pressure applied in the hydraulic press. 

The collar (C) was 3 3/4“ outside diameter, 2“ inside 
diameter and 3“ long. A section l/8“ by l/8” was cut away on the 
outside circumference at on© end which ms used to centre the loose 
collar (E) over the shaft. 

The cap (D) had an overall length of 1", l/2“ length had a 
diameter of 2” and the other l/2“ length a diameter of 2 3/4“. 

The loose collar (E) was 4” outside diameter, 3” inside 
diameter and 2 l/s" long. A section l/s” x l/4“ was cut away on the 


















































































































































































34 


inside circumference at one end to centre this loose collar over the 
shaft. This part was used only when extruding the briquette from the 
mould. 

The base (A), the collar (C) and the loose collar (E) were 
made from cold rolled steel whilst the shaft (a) and the cap (D) were 
made from a special tool steel. Sections 1, 2, and 3, respectively 
show the relative positions of the above parts when the briquetting 
mixture lias been placed in the mould prior to pressing, after the 
pressure has been applied, and after the briquette has been extruded 
from the mould. 

Pressure was applied to the briquette mixture in the mould 
by means of a 30 ton w Watson Stillman” hydraulic Press. This is 
shown in Figure XV. 

Since the experiments described previously had shown that a 
good separation of clean coal and refuse material was possible with 
Drumheller slack coal, the coal used for these investigations was 
washed by treatment on a shaker screen available in the University 
Mining Department. It consists of two screens, one set below and in 
front of the other. The screens are set at a low angle and the 
material being screened moves down the screen owing to the forword 
thrust imparted to the screens by means of two cams located on the 
single driving shaft. The washing was accomplished by subjecting 
the slack coal, as it moved down the two screens, to a fine jet of 
water. The water passing through the screens carried the fine 
particles of dirt. 

The first batch of briquettes was made from a mixture 
containing 80 per cent Drumheller slack which had been so washed and

air-dried, 20 per cent Crowsnest coking coal and 6 mixing ratio of 
asphalt* The mixing ratio represents the number of parts by weight 
of asphalt which are added to 100 parts of the mixed coals* The two 
coals were mixed and heated for five minutes in a steam-jacketed 
helical mixer or until the mixture reached a temperature of 125°C* 

The mixer consists of a helical vessel in which there are two blades 
geared so that one rotates at twice the speed and in the opposite 
direction to the other. The mixer can be tipped to discharge its 
contents and has a maximum capacity of 25 pounds* The asphalt which 
had been weighed and heated to over 200®C. was then added and the 
mixing continued for an additional five minutes. In order to maintain 
the mixture in a plastic condition only sufficient was withdrawn at 
one time to make a single briquette* This amounted to about 60 grams 
by weight* The pressure was applied rapidly to the mixture in the 
mould until the desired pressure was attained and this pressure was 
maintained for two minutes* The pressure was then immediately released. 
The extruded briquettes were allowed to cool and the density of each 
briquette was then determined. A briquette was weighed first in the 
air and then completely submerged in water* The densities were 
calculated in the usual way. Table IY shows the results for this 


series of tests

Since eight kilograms of this mixture had been made, part 
of it was compressed on th© two large presses already installed by 
the Research Council. Density determinations were also made on th© 
briquettes obtained in this way. A figure of 1.06 was obtained for 
the briquettes from the plunger press and 1.09 for th© briquettes 
frcKn the roll press.

The results in Tables IV and V show that the density of th© 
briquettes increases with pressure up to a pressure of approximately 
4000 p.s.i. but that above 4000 p.s.i. pressure does not affect the 
density of the briquette to any appreciable extent. 

The Effect of the Amount of Binder Used on the Strength of Briquettes 
Seventeen and one-half pounds (8 kilograms) of coal were 
placed in the steam-jacketed helical mixer and heated for seven minutes 
whereby the coal temperature was raised to a recorded temperature of 
approximately 125°C. The weighed amount of binder was heated 
separately to over 200*C. so that it would pour and mix readily, and it 
was then poured onto the coal in the mixer. The temperature of the 
binder was recorded. Mixing of coal and binder continued for three 
minutes, when the temperature of th© mix was measured and also recorded 
Water, in the proportion of 8 parts to 100 parts by weight of coal was 
then added in order to reduce the temperature to that suitable for 
pressing, and in order to make a mix that would briquette without 
sticking to the rolls. Mixing was continued for another 30 seconds.

Industrially, steam is passed directly into the mass in the mixer, and 
the mass is not heated to as high a temperature. The mix was then 
dumped into a suitable container, where its temperature was again 
recorded, and from which it was fed to the roll press or the plunger 
press. The briquettes were then collected and allowed to stand for 
four days before the rattler loss and density were determined. 

The rattler test consists of placing about 2000 grams of 
briquettes in a drum which is then revolved two hundred times at 32 
r.p.m. This test is substantially that adopted for testing paving 
bricks by the Aiaerican Society for Testing Materials. The dram is 25 
inches long and 30 inches outside diameter and is built of cast-iron 
plates 6 inches wide, 25 inches long and l/4 inch apart. The material 
rubbed off the briquettes as the drum revolves falls out between the 
plates, and the percentage loss of weight is determined by weighing 
the rumbled briquettes. The rattler test appears to provide a 
satisfactory criterion of the handling quality of the briquettes. 

A briquette that is otherwise satisfactory and does not lose more 
than 20 per cent in the rattler test is regarded as strong enough to 
b© handled and shipped.

In all the runs made, the mix pressed very well and the 
briquettes had a hard smooth shiny surface. The above results indicate 
that it should be possible to make a briquette on an industrial scale 
using only a proportion of asphalt equivalent to a mixing ratio of 4, 
that is 3.8 per cent by weight of the total material. Increasing the 
asphalt content to 4.3 per cent by weight of the total mixture reduces 
the rattler loss from 19 to 12 per cent and any increase in the asphalt 
content beyond this does not give any further appreciable reduction. 

(2) The Variation in Asphalt Content of Briquettes Made on Industrial 
Scale 

In order to gain experience in briquetting on an industrial 
scale, a period of three weeks was spent assisting in the operation of 
the Brazeau Briquetting Plant. This gave an opportunity for large 
scale experiments to be made on the effect of variation of the asphalt 
content on the strength of a briquette. 

A small briquetting plant was installed when the Brazeau 
Collieries were faced with a loss of markets because of the excessive 
amounts of fine coal produced during the handling and transportation 
of the coal mined by this company• Since the commencement of 
operations the briquetting plant has been considerably extended and 
at present there are four briquetting presses in use with a daily 
output of 1050 tons. Each press has its own blending system consisting 
of a preheater, a mixer and a fluxer. The purpose of the fluxer is to 
ensure thorough blending of the constituents of the briquettes. The 
asphalt is emulsified with steam and apportioned to the coal in the 
mixer through a special metering device. As far as could be observed 
there was no tendency for the briquettes to stick to the rolls as has

been the experience with the presses installed by the Research Council* 
Presumably the quantity and manner in which the moisture was added had 
a marked effect on the freeing of the briquettes from the presses. It 
should be mentioned here that a vertical fluxer ’was tried out in the 
laboratory and was found to be unsatisfactory as a batch mixer because 
the temperature could not be controlled easily* Also the particles of 
coal coated with the binder were abraded and fresh surfaces were thus 
oreated which did not receive any coating with the binder and in this 
way the quality of the briquette was reduced. 

The four presses at Brazeau are all of the roll-type* I 
was informed that the best metal for making the rolls is a 12$ chrome 
steel. One set of such rolls was installed in 1941 and is still giving 
very good performance. Table VII contains some production data 
regarding the four presses.

Owing to the blend being pressed at a temperature of approx¬ 
imately 77°C. the briquettes were too warn to be dropped at once into 
a storage bin. By using a slow moving belt to transport the briquettes 
from the briquetting presses to the storage bins and spiral chutes in 















43 - 


the storage bins, any damage was minimized, 

A series of runs was made on each of the four presses with 
varying amounts of asphalt in the mixture, all other operating conditions 
being kept normal. Samples each of approximately 10 pounds in weight, 
were taken from every experimental run on the presses. Compression 
tests v;ere done four days after the briquettes were made, A Kom&rek- 
Greaves Briquette Tester was used for this purpose. Later the briquettes 
were also tested for rattler loss and density as previously described 
and the amount of asphalt present was determined by extraction of the 
briquettes with benzene. Approximately 200 grams of briquettes were 
broken into several pieces which were dried for 1 hour in an 
electrically-controlled gas-filled oven at 105®C, and then cooled 
and weighed. The pieces of briquettes were then covered with 200 
cc. f s of benzene in a 400 cc. beaker and placed in a hot water bath 
for 15 minutes, the mixture being stirred occasionally. After allowing 
the mixture to settle for 30 minutes, the liquid was decanted and two 
more similar extractions then carried out. The residue was centrifuged 
in a Dulin Rotarex Separator. The Separator consists of an aluminum 
bowl mounted on the top of a vertical shaft which is hand-driven. 

The cover of the bowl is held in place by a centrally placed filler 
screw which is a funnel-shaped piece which screws into the head of 
the power shaft and serves also as an inlet for additional solvent as 
the separation proceeds. A ring of filter paper is used between the 
cover and the bowl. Surrounding the bowl is a covered catch-basin, 
draining to a spout so that the treated liquid can be recovered. After 
placing the residue in the bowl and fitting the ring of filter paper 
over it, the lid is screwed down tightly. The bowl is then set in 



- 44 - 


motion and the centrifugal action forces all the liquid through the 
ring of filter paper at the periphery of the bowl. The process is 
repeated with fresh benzene admitted through the filler screw until 
the benzene from the spout runs clear. The previously decanted liquor 
was also centrifuged and any residue so obtained was treated in a similar 
manner. The total residue was then allowed to air-dry for two days, 
dried for one hour at 105°C. cooled and weighed. The loss in weight 
was taken to be the amount of binder present in the briquettes tested. 

Table VIII contains the results obtained. 

At Mordegg a compression figure of 150 p.s.i. is regarded as 
the minimum for a good briquette. In each case the compression test 
results are averages from tests done on three briquettes. With a 
few exceptions the range of variation of the results of the tests on 
these briquettes was ± 10 p.s.i. and this variation was adopted as 
the maximum variation allowable. Any results showing differences 
exceeding this tolerance were discarded. It is noteworthy that in 
the tests made briquettes having compression strengths of at least 
150 p.s.i. contained a different percentage of asphalt according to 
the press in which they were made. In Wo. 5 press less than 3 per cent 
of asphalt was required, in Mo. 2 press 4 l/2 per cent, in No. 1 press 
approximately 4 l/2 per cent for the second series and in No. 4 press 
7 1/2 per cent. 

The values obtained in the above compression tests for the 
first series of briquettes made on No. 1 press were considered to be 
decidedly low and accordingly a second series of tests was carried out. 
The management of the Brazeau Collieries expressed the opinion that the 
briquettes would be much improved in strength if a larger amount of

steam was used in both the mixer and the fluxer. Ho facilities were 
available to measure the quantity of steam actually used. The second 
series was made with all steam valves wide open, otherwise the procedure 
was identical with that used in the first series of tests. The results 
of the compression tests on the briquettes made in the second series 
have been given above in Table VIII which affords a ready comparison 
with the results of the first series of tests. The improvement in 
strength may be explained by assuming that in the plant during the 
mixing of the first batch of material the temperature obtained was not 
high enough to allow the asphalt to flow easily and to coat the 
particles of coal with an even adhesive film. 

The degree of fluidity of the asphalt must be an important 
factor in the filming of the individual particles of coal which is 
essential before they can adhere to one another. The plasticity of 
a material is a function of both pressure and temperature, that is to 
say in briquetting the asphalt will tend towards greater fluidity 
under increased pressure or temperature. It would seem that there 
must be an optimum condition of pressure and temperature regarding 
the fluid and adhesive properties at which in the formation of 
briquettes the coal particles are filmed with a minimum quantity of 
adhesive material. This obviously raises the question of the 
examination of the properties of an asphalt which are essential in 
the manufacture of briquettes as well as the adsorptive powers of the 
coals being briquetted. Unfortunately time has not permitted study 
of this problem.

The briquettes made on the four presses at Nordegg are all 
tested on the same compression tester and are considered suitable for 
handling if they withstand a pressure of 150 p.s.i, Assuming that the 
degree of mixing is uniform in all cases, the effect of size and shape 
of a briquette on its compression strength is indicated in the results 
of the compression tests which were made at Nordegg* It will be seen 
that No. 4 press which required the largest amount of asphalt, 7 \/Z 
per cent, to produce a briquette capable of withstanding a pressure 
of 150 p.s.i* produces the thinnest briquette and No. 5 press which 
required the smallest amount of asphalt, less than 3$, produces the 
thickest briquette. Although the test may be satisfactory for 
briquettes made by one press, it is not necessarily satisfactory for 
testing briquettes made on presses producing briquettes which differ 
in size and shape. 

The rattler test which uses approximately 2000 grams of 
briquettes, that is to say between 20 and 40 complete briquettes, does 
not give such large variations. This is shown in Table VI (page 40) 
where the maximum difference of 3.1 per cent was obtained using three 
separate batches of briquettes made with the same amount of asphalt-. 

In the Research Council laboratories a loss on the rattler test of 
less than 20 per cent is considered essential. If the binder content 
was related to a rattler loss of less than 20 per cent, this figure 
only varies from about 4 to 5 per cent for the four presses. 

It is also noteworthy that the screen analyses of the 
extracted material, mentioned above, approach a straight line when 
plotted on a semi-logarithmic scale. Stansfield and Lang(^^) 



' - 48 - 


arrived at the conclusion that the best screen analysis of coals for 
briquetting was one that approached a straight line when the screen 
sizes were plotted on a logarithmic scale, providing there was not too 
much coarse or fine coal. A coal having such an analysis usually gave 
a strong briquette as judged by the rattler test. Figure XVI is 
typical of the results obtained on the extracted material from the 
Brazeau briquettes. 

Conclusion 

The results obtained indicate that on an industrial scale 
satisfactory briquettes can be made with coal from the Luscar and 
Nordegg areas using approximately 5 per cent asphalt. The briquetting 
presses should be capable of exerting a pressure of approximately 
4000 p.s.i. The results also indicate that a large steady supply of 
steam is of considerable importance in the production of a good quality 
briquette. The compression test as it is done at Nordegg is not * 
necessarily a satisfactory method for determining the handling qualities 
of the briquettes made on the four presses.

SECTION 3 


3RIQNETTING FOLLOWED BY A PROCESS OP 


LOW TEMPERATURE CARBONIZATION 



Briquetting Followed by a Process of Low Temperature 
Carbonization 


The principal objection to the use of briquettes is the smoke 
which results on combustion. A great deal of experimental work has been 
done and a number of processes tried out on an industrial scale in the 
effort to overcome this disadvantage. The results in most cases, 
however, have been very discouraging. The briquettes were not strong 
enough to withstand normal handling. Especially when inorganic binders 
have been used, the increase in ash content has resulted in a very low 
grade fuel being produced. Carbonization of course means that the 
solid product will be higher in ash content than is the uncarbonized 
briquette. 

With uncarbonized briquettes the presence of a certain 
proportion of higher rank coking coal prevents the disintegration of 
a briquette when burned on a fire; on heating the higher rank coal, it 
cokes and helps the briquette to retain its shape. If the briquettes 
are to be carbonized it is essential that a certain proportion of 
coking coal should be present if a carbonized product is to be 
obtained which will withstand a reasonable amount of handling and 
which will not disintegrate on combustion. 

Carbonization may be carried out at low or high temperature. 
Low temperature carbonization means carbonization at temperatures not 
exceeding about 700°C. High temperature carbonization means carbon¬ 
ization in general at temperatures exceeding 900 to 1000*C. In any 




- 51 - 


carbonization process the quantity and quality of the products depend 
not only on the final carbonization temperature obtained but also on 
the rate of heating and especially in the case of the volatile product 
the rate at which these are removed from the retort or oven* 

Different processes are therefore possible for producing a 
clean smokeless fuels 

(a) Low rank coal may be carbonized at a low temperature in order to 
upgrade it. The resulting char after admixture with a suitable 
proportion of coking coal and asphalt and briquetting may then be 
carbonized at a low or high temperature# 

(b) The upgrading process may be an integral part of the whole carbon¬ 
ization process at a low or high temperature. 

With regard to (a) no account appears to be given in the 
literature for experiments in which this procedure has been followed, 
but I have been given to understand that experiments carried out in 
the laboratories of the Research Council of Alberta have shown that 
the char from the low temperature carbonization of a low rank coal 
requires 2-4 per cent more asphalt than the uncarbonized coal alone. 
The char is exceedingly porous and excessive abrasion occurs during 
briquetting. Moreover, the procedure would involve two separate 
carbonizations. My investigations'therefore concentrated on (b) above 

Six runs of briquettes were made on the plunger press using 
four different coals, namely* Drumheller coal, Camrose coal. Crows- 
nest coal and Mountain Park coal. The composition of these coals 
is given in Table IX.

The two non-coking coals, Drumheller and Camrose, were crushed to 
approximately one-quarter inch size and then dried on a steam table to 
a moisture content of approximately 4 per cent. These coals were dried 
because briquettes made with a high moisture content disintegrate easily 
and do not stand firing or handling (12), ^he steam table, 4 feet by 
5 feet, is located in the laboratories of the University Department of 
Mining Engineering and uses steam at 10 p.s.i. The drying occupied 
two days with each sample. The coking coals, Crowsnest and Mountain 
Park, were ground in a hammer mill using a screen marked "50" which 
corresponds to 1 mm. opening. The appropriate amounts of the coking 
and non-coking coals for each run consisting of 8 kilograms were 
weighed out and placed in the helical mixer (page 36), The procedure 
followed from this point on has been described earlier (page 38). 

The amount of asphalt used was kept constant throughout these six 
runs at 7 M.R. Table X contains the briquetting data and the results 
of tests and analyses made on the briquettes from each run. Blends 
of 70 per cent non-coking coal and 30 per cent coking coal were used 
for runs 1354 to 1356 inclusive because the carbonization results

obtained on briquettes from runs 1351 to 1353 inclusive indicated that 
this blend gave a better product when carbonized than those containing 
either 10 or 20 per cent coking coal* 

I 

Two series of carbonization were carried out on each run of 

I 

briquettes with different rates of heating* The carbonization temperatures 
ranged from about 500°C« to approximately 900 # C. in stages of 100 or 2Q0*C. 
In the first series the teniperature was raised as quickly as possible to 
the desired temperature while in the other series a lower rate of heating 
was employed. For the first series the rheostat under the electric 
muffle furnace used was cut out completely and in the second one 
approximately 50 per cent of the rheostat was used but the rate of 
increase was never allowed to drop below 50 # C. in fifteen minutes. The 
time required to reach the desired temperature and the temperature 
obtained were recorded. On the following figures (figures XXI - XXIV 
inclusive) the results obtained for the first series are indicated by 
(a) and the second series by (B)« Figure XVII shows averaged rates of 
heating for the two series. In Series (a) it was impossible to duplicate 
exactly the rate of heating. 

The carbonization was carried out in the furnace using the- 
carbonizing retort shown in Figure XVIII. For the first experiments 
four briquettes were carbonized in each case. It was found that the 
shrinkage of the briquette in the front part of the retort was less 
than that of the other three briquettes, indicating that the heating 
of the retort was not uniform. Accordingly in later experiments only 
three briquettes were carbonized at one time. The position of the

briquettes in the retort are shown in FigureXVIII. The individual 
briquettes were weighed and measured for length, width and thickness 
before being placed in the carbonizing retort* The filled retort was 
then placed in the cold furnace and the temperature of the furnace was 
raised to the desired value and this temperature was maintained for 
thirty minutes. The retort was then withdrawn and allowed to cool* 

The carbonized briquettes were weighed and measured as before* They 
were tested for compression strength and their apparent specific 
gravity was determined* 

It was decided that since all the briquettes had been made 
on the same press a compression test would give a satisfactory 
comparison of the strength of the briquettes. Accordingly, the small 
Hydraulic Compression Briquette-Testing Apparatus, shown in Figure XIX 
was designed. The various parts of this compression apparatus are 
described below: 

The two pieces of wood (A) are used to hold rod (B) in 

place. 

The steel rod (B) is 7 inches long and has a diameter of 
1 l/4 inches. The lower end of this rod has a bevelled edge, this • 
bevelling being made to a 3/4 inch diameter. 

The steel cap (C) sits over the top of a Hydraulic press (G). 

It has an overall length of 1 inch and a diameter of 1 3/4 inches. 

A hole 1 l/2 inches in diameter is drilled in the bottom of this cap 
to a depth of l/2 inch to allow the cap to fit over the top of the 
press. The upper edge is bevelled in the same manner as that at rod (B).

The container (D) is a can 4 inches high and 4 inches in 
diameter. It is attached to am (F) by means of a small hook and a 
piece of wire. The arm (F) is a wooden rod 13 l/2 inches long and has 
a diameter of 13/l6 inches. It extends into the pump beam 1 l/4 inches. 
The distance of the hook from the end of the am is l/2 inch. Water is 
run into the can at a slow uniform rate by means of a siphon until the 
briquette breaks. 

The ruler (E) is used to fix the length of stroke allowed 
during a compression test. The arm (p) ms never lifted above the 11 
inch mark and never allowed to go below the 3 l/2 inch mark. These 
positions were found to give reproducible results. 

(H) is a release valve. 

The briquette (i), being tested, must be carefully centered before 
pressure is applied. The apparatus ms calibrated by measuring the 
pressures exerted on a platform scale when different amounts of water 
were placed in the container (D). Figure XX shows the calibration 
curve obtained for the apparatus. 

The carbonized briquettes were very porous, and the 
apparent specific gravity could not be determined in the manner 
previously described. This was shown when on© of the carbonised 
briquettes was placed in water and weighed, the weight increased 
appreciably owing to penetration of water into the briquette isith 
the displacement of air bubbles. An attempt was therefore made to 
determine the apparent specific gravity of the carbonized briquettes 
using a solid material such as sand or rape-seed. Sand or rape-seed

was allowed to fall freely into a tarod quart jar until It overflowed* 

• The contents were levelled off with the top of the jar and the material 
In the jar weighed. This procedure was repeated at least three times 
in order to obtain an average value* Th© apparent specific gravity of 
the material was thus determined. Th© average weight of material 
required to fill the jar was than weighed out and used in the determination 
of the apparent specific gravity of the briquettes. The flow of material 
into the jar was interrupted at intervals to allow the briquettes to be 
placed in the jar. Csr© was taken tc see that the briquettes did not 
touch one another or the sides of th® jar. The material which overflowed 
was collected and weighed. This procedure was also repeated at least 
three times. Knowing the apparent density of the material displaced, 
the apparent specific gravity of the briquettes was thus ascertained. 

The results obtained were approximately 10 per cent lower than those 
obtained later using a wax coating method and this discrepancy was 
not consistent. P.ape seed however gave slightly more uniform results 
but these were still low. This method was not used because it was 
slew and inconsistent. 

A wax coating method was used to determine the apparent ' 
specific gravity of the carbonized briquettes. The weight of the 
briquette was first determined in air. The briquette was then lightly 
coated with molten paraffin wax by dipping. The weight of the waxed 
briquette was then determined in air and in water. The density of 
the paraffin was mte assumed to be 0.9. The following formula was 
used to calculate the apparent specific gravity:

Seme of the results of the various series of carbonisations 

from Tables XI to XVI are presented graphically in Figures XXI to XXIV 
inclusive* As mentioned previously, in all the figures the curves 
marked (A) represent the results obtained with a rapid rate of heating 
and those marked (B) are the comparable curves for a slow rate of 
heating. Throughout, the curves for runs 1351-1353 inclusive are for 
the results obtained with mixtures of Drumheller non-coking and 
Crowsnest coking coal in varying amounts and are indicated by 
subscript (1) after (a) or (B) as the case may be* Similarly the 
curves for runs 1353-1356 inclusive are for results obtained with 
different blend® of coking and non-coking coals. These are identified 
by subscript (2). For convenience. In discussing the significance of 
these graphs the actual blends are repeated below*

1352 10 per cent Crowsnest coal and 90 per cent Drumheller coal 

1353 30 per cent Crowsnest coal and 70 per cent Druraheller coal

Carbonized briquettes exposed to the atmosphere for a considerable period and then 
analysed showed that they did not contain any appreciable quantity of moisture. In certain 
cases a small increase in weight occurred during the moisture determination which was 
carried out in an atmosphere of natural gas at a temperature of 105*C.

The results of the graphs are dealt with in turn# 

Figure XXI 

All the curves show that the carbonization at a temperature 
exceeding 700*C# only results in a small increase in the percentage 
loss in weight# This of course does not make any reference to the other 
properties of the briquettes prepared at these temperatures# A temp* 
erature of 700°C# can be taken as that temperature at which substantially 
all the tar and liquor has been evolved# The loss shown between 700°G. 
and 900®C. is thus represented as a loss due to the evolution of gas 
which will contain large quantities of hydrogen# This gas will be 
relatively low in calorific value* 

Increasing the quantity of coking coal increases the yield 
in carbonization at a low and a high rate of heating* The maximum 
difference obtained in these experiments ms of the order of 4 per oent 
whatever the carbonization temperature. 

Below 7Q0®C* the yield of carbonized briquettes increase© 
rapidly as the temperature approaches S00 # C. The actual difference in 
the yield of the carbonized briquettes at 500*C. and 900*C# is of the 
order of 16 per cent. 

The (A)g curves show that the yield of briquettes appears to 
depend principally on the kind of non-coking coal# It is more marked 
in the regions of low temperatures. Mo standard test was available 
for determining the caking index of the coking coals used.

Figures XXII and XXII continued 

Compression strength increases with temperature. Referring 
to curves (a)^, as the percentage of coking coal is increased the 
compression strength increases but not in a direct proportion. At 500*C. 
the compression strength is very low and it is not until a temperature 
of at least 600°C. is reached that the briquettes have any appreciable 
compressive strength. If one is to judge by the former criterion of 
the experiments at Uordegg, a briquette of sufficient strength might be 
prepared by the carbonization at 700°C. of briquettes containing 30 
per cent Crowsnest coal and 70 per cent Drumheller coal. With this 
blend of the two coals there is a substantial improvement where the 
carbonization temperature is increased to 800°C. and above. The 
increase in compression strength for briquettes containing smaller 
proportions of coking coal is not very great# 

Comparison of (a)i and (B)^ shows that the slower rate of 
heating has a marked effect on the compressive strength of a carbonized 
briquette throughout the whole range of temperatures and this is 
particularly the case with the blend containing the maximum amount of 
coking coal used. That is to say that should it be considered necessary 
for reasons other than strength, such for example as the ease of 
combustion, or to obtain the maximum amount of carbonized product from 
a definite weight of uncarbonized briquettes, to carbonize the briquettes 
at 7Q0*C. it would be most desirable and perhaps essential on an 
industrial scale to adopt a slow heating rate. The actual output of 
the plant would be a major consideration. Alternatively, it might be 












- 71 - 


pointed out that with a slow rate of heating a satisfactory briquette 
could be made by carbonizing at 700*C. a blend containing only 20 
per cent oolcing coal as compared to a briquette made from a blend 
containing 30 per cent coking coal if the carbonization were carried out 
faster. The compression strength of a briquette made from a blend 
containing the largest quantity of coking coal and carbonizing, by slow 
heating, to 900 a C. was so high that it could not be measured on the 
apparatus used. 

Curves (a )2 and (B)g both show that compression strength as 
distinct from yield appears to depend more on the quality of the coking 
coal. In both cases the Mountain Park coal will be seen to be superior 
in this respect. This is not to say that the nature of the non-coking 
coal is not of great importance because the two curves in (a)£ for the 
same proportions of Mountain £ark coal and the non-coking coals are 
quit© different apparently due to the nature of the non-coking material. 
The same applies up to 700 # C. with a slow rate of heating and the 
indications are that this effect may be enhanced with carbonization up 
to 900°C. The (A)g curves show that with the Crowsnest coking coal the 
nature of the non-coking coal with a quick rate of heating is not- of so 
great importance. Reference to ( 6 ) 3 , however, shows that this is not 
so at low heating rates where the poorer quality of the Camrose coal 
is very marked indeed. From a purely practical view of carbonization 
a 3 carried out at 700°C., whether the heating rate be slow or rapid, 
a blend of 70 parts Drumheller coal and 30 parts Mountain Park will 
produce a briquette which should readily meet all requirements for 
strength.

In a fairly recant paper the view is expressed that in 

the coking process the fusible coal bitumens render the mass plastio 
which phase is of course essential if a hard coherent coke is to be 
obtained. The remainder of the coal which is infusible varies in 
adsorptive properties which must be satisfied before the individual 
particles of coal can become plastic. A connection is therefore drawn 
between the coking power of a coal and ita adsorptive properties as 
measured by its inherent moisture content or to use what has become 
a well known term its natural bed moisture or capacity moisture. If 
this view is correct, one would anticipate that a similar state of 
conditions applies in the blending of coking and non-coking coals. 

It is considered that all of the coking coal when it becomes plastic 
has first to satisfy the adsorptive power of the non-coking coal 
before the particles of the latter can be filmed on their surfaces 
and thus adhere to one another. If this is so, non-coking coals of 
a low capacity moisture would require less coking coal than a 
non-coking coal of a high capacity moisture content. This view is 
introduced here because th© curves (k)$ and (8}g la Figure JQLII 
continued show that Drumheller coal gives a better briquette than 
Camrose coal and the capacity moistures of these two coals are /a 
per cent and zs per cent respectively. Tlw coking pr@fc#§§ is of 
course a complex one and must involve not only such considerations as 
are outlined above but also such factors as the penetrative power, 
softening point, viscosity and final setting power of the coking 
materials. Accordingly it is impossible within the scop© of this 
thesis to discuss the fundamental reasons why th© slow rate of heating 
gives such a marked improvement in compression strength.

Figures XXIII and XXIII continued 

Some of the factors which have just been mentioned will 
presumably apply to the apparent specific gravity of the briquettes and 
consequently only general trends can reasonably be considered. Comparing 
(A)l and (B)^ it will be seen that the rate of heating has not a very 
marked effect on the apparent specific gravity of the briquettes. This 
also applies for curves (a) 2 and (Bjg. 

Cobb(^) in studying the solid products of carbonization of 
a variety of materials ranging, from cellulose to anthracite paid 
particular attention to specific gravity. Carbonization temperatures 
ranged from about 400*C. in stages of 100° to approximately 1200°C. 

He states "That the specific gravity whatever it may be initially and 
in the first stage of carbonization reaches a common value very near 
1.4 at 500*; anthracite did not alter in this stage, cellulose 
diminished from 1.6 and a Welsh meta-bituminous coal increased from 
1.23, changes due to differing decompositions. From 500° to 800° the 
specific gravity always increased from 1.4 to 1.8, but in the stage 
from 800° to 1200° it remained nearly constant at about 1.85." Curves 
(A)^, (B)^ and to a lesser extent (A)j>, (B)2 show the same general 
trend. As far as (A)q and (B)^ are concerned any initial drop to 6QQ*C. 
is due apparently to completion of the evolution of tar vapors and 
consequent shrinkage. Above 600* further shrinkage especially above 
700*C. is of course characteristic of the carbonization of coal at 
high temperatures. This shrinkage is due of course to the emission 
of gas which is principally hydrogen and lesser amounts of carbon 


monoxide and methane

Tho order of tho curves in Figures XXIII and XXIII continued 
is not that in Figures XXII and XXII continued. In other words the 
compression strength of a briquette does not appear to be simply a 
matter of shrinkage. In the case of the apparent specifio gravity 
(curves (A)g and (Bjg) the position of the coking coals is reversed to 
that in the case of compression strength, the non-coking coals however 
are in the same relative positions. No explanation of this is attempted 
on the evidence obtained. 

Figure XXIV 

Briquettes carbonized at a temperature of 600° - 700°C. have 
a maximum calorific value in the caoe of the Drumheller and Crowsnest 
blends (a^, Bp). The difference in calorific value due to the 
different rates of heating is not very marked. It will be noticed 
that the increase in heat value obtained does not compensate for the 
loss in weight. 

With regard to (a)£ and (b)£, presumably each coal used 
would contribute to the calorific value of the carbonized briquette 
in proportion to the amounts and calorific values of the cokes 
prepared from the separate coals at any particular temperature of 
carbonization. 

Conclusion 

(l) To obtain the best carbonised product with Drumheller 
coal, it should be blended with a coking coal and carbonized at 
about 700°C. at a slow rate of heating. The amount of coking coal 
required will vary with the coking power. With the two coals used 
practically the same percentage of coking coal was required but with 
coals of higher coking power the percentage would presumably be less. 














• 78 


(2) Judged by the compression strength, density and calorific 
value, a blend of 20 per cent Crowsnest coking coal with 80 per cent 
Drumheller coal and a slow rate of carbonization, will give a satisfactory 
briquette. Seven mixing ratio of asphalt will be required in briquetting. 

(S) A final carbonization temperature of 700*C. is the 
minimum temperature which should be employed. Carbonization at a some¬ 
what higher temperature would mean an increased density and compressive 
strength at the expense of a decreased calorific value. Circumstances 
might justify the higher temperatures but the actual carbonization 
temperature employed would have to be related to the burning quality 
of the briquettes, 

(4) Cararose coal requires a larger proportion of coking coal 
if a strong enough product is to be obtained. This proportion amounts 
to 30 parts of coking coal and 70 parts of Camrose coal as compared to 
20 parte of coking coal and 80 parts Drumheller coal. Similar remarks 
apply to the Camrose coal as to the Drumheller coal with regard to 
density, calorific value and compression strength. 

(5) The actual value of the briquettes to the consumer must 
obviously depend upon the economics of the carbonization process. This 
work shows that an enhanced fuel of a smokeless character and a blacky 
nature can be manufactured by the methods outlined from either Drumheller 
or Camrose low grade coal. 








SUMMARY 











. 











v 























- 79 - 


SUMMARY 

f, A M Drumheller ooal can be upgraded by any one of the following 
methods or by a combination of them. 

(i) Coal Washing 

Laboratory tests have shown that the ash content of the slack 
coal can be reduced considerably by normal coal cleaning processes. 
The extent of breakage which might occur if the coal was cleaned in 
a wet washing process has not been determined. 

(ii) Briquetting and Carbonization 

A strong smokeless fuel can be obtained by carbonising a 
briquetted blend of 80 per cent Drumheller coal, 20 per cent 
Crowsnost coking coal and 7 M.R. asphalt up to a final temperature 
of about 700®C. employing a slow rate of heating. 
w B n Camrose Coal 

Carbonized briquettes of practically equal quality can be 
obtained with C&mrose coal using the same treatment as for Drumheller 
coal except that 30 per cent of Crowsnest or Mountain Park coking 
coal is required. 

"C" floraegg coal 

Washing tests on Hordegg coal show that it cannot be 
sharply separated into clean coal and refuse. The smaller size3 can 
be successfully briquetted using 4-5 asphalt. 

"D n Luscar coal 

Briquetting experiments with Luscar coal show that this coal 
like that of Hordegg requires approximately 5 per cent asphalt to 
produce a satisfactory briquette.
