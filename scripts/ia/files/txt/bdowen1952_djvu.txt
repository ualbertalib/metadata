SUPPLEMENTAL PANTOTHENIC ACID IN 


SMALL GRAIN RATIONS FOR SWINE 


ABSTRACT 

An investigation of the effects of pantothenic acid supple¬ 
mentation of small grain rations for Yorkshire smne has been conducted. 
The studies were prompted by the reported occurrence of deficiencies of 
this vitamin in smne fed rations based on corn. Growth trials during 
two generations, a reproduction and lactation experiment, and micro¬ 
biological assays for pantothenic acid in the milk and blood of the 
animals involved in the reproduction and lactation trial were conducted. 

A ration, based on barley as it is the small grain lowest in pantothenic 
acid content, was used throughout so that control lots received as little 
pantothenic acid as is possible in a typical balanced Western Canadian 
ration. 

Supplemental pantothenic acid had no effect on first genera¬ 
tion growth, or on gilts between the time that they were weaned and the 
time they farrowed their first litters. However, indications were that 
supplemental levels of from three to twelve mg. per lb. of feed in gilts 1 
rations may have had a detrimental effect on the birtbweight of their off¬ 
spring, and on the growth of the suckling pigs. 

The results of microbiological assays, which were conducted 
following both water and enzymatic hydrolysis of samples, indicated that 
the pantothenic acid content of the blood and milk of the sows, and the 
blood of their suckling pigs was related to the content of the vitamin 
in the sows ’ ration. Values obtained for the pantothenic acid content 













of sows* blood, pigs 1 blood and sows* milk ranged from 0.16 to C.li.7, 0*8$ 
to 3*70 and 5.50 to 16.23 "V per ml., respectively, following, -water hydrol¬ 
ysis of the samples. Corresponding valn.es obtained following enzymatic 
hydrolysis of the samples ranged from 0.1+6 to 0.99, 1*37 to 1+.1+2 and 5*09 
to ll +*76 y per ml. 

Since the basal rations contained sufficient amounts of panto¬ 
thenic acid to promote normal growth and reproduction in Yorkshire swine, 
it has been concluded any balanced small grain ration of the type common¬ 
ly fed in Western Canada should contain adequate amounts of the vitamin. 

It has been concluded also that unnecessary supplemental pantothenic acid 
in swine rations may result in certain harmful effects during the second 
generation.

SUPPLEMENTAL PANTOTHENIC ACID IN 


SMALL GRAIN RATIONS FOR SWINE 


INTRODUCTION 

Pantothenic acid, one of the B-complex group of vitamins, has 
been shown in the past few years to be an essential factor in the metab¬ 
olism of several species of animals, including swine. It is generally 
recognized that pantothenic acid, although widespread in various natural 
feedstuffs, can become a limiting factor in nutrition. Deficiencies of 
this vitamin, furthermore, may produce serious effects on the growth and 
thriftiness of the animals concerned. 

Several investigators have reported pantothenic acid deficiencies 
in swine rations. However, when produced on diets of natural feedstuffs, 
the deficiencies have been confined to rations containing a relatively 
large proportion of corn. At the time of writing there has been little 
work done concerning the possibility of a pantothenic acid deficiency 
occurring on small grain rations such as are generally used in swine 
feeding in Western Canada. It may be noted that as wheat, oats and 
barley contain higher levels of this vitamin, such rations would gener¬ 
ally contain a greater amount of pantothenic acid than rations formulated 
with corn as the chief constituent. Nevertheless, the possibility of a 
borderline deficiency of pantothenic acid occurring on a small grain ra¬ 
tion must be considered, and it was to investigate this contingency that 
the studies reported herein were initiated. 

The experiments were designed to investigate pantothenic acid 
requirements of Yorkshire swine fed a small grain ration, for growth

over two generations, and for reproduction and lactation. The control 
ration was supplemented with varying levels of calcium pantothenate* 

In addition, a study was made of the pantothenic acid content of the 
blood and milk of the lactating sows, and the blood of their suckling 
pigs. 

The experiments reported in this thesis were carried out in 
the Department of Animal Science at the University of Alberta between 
May, 1950 and January, 1952.

REVIEW OF LITERATURE 


Pantothenic acid was first recognized as a growth stimulant for 
yeast. However, from the time of its discovery, in 1931 in a bios con¬ 
centrate (78), the possibility that it would prove to be a vitamin 
required by animals was considered, and further investigation continued 
along two lines. Poultry nutritionists postulated an antidermatitis or 
filtrate factor for chicks, and chemical studies of this factor (66) (80) 
proceeded simultaneously with attempts to isolate and identify panto¬ 
thenic acid (77)• The various workers soon began to suspect that they 
were working towards identification of the same biological factor, and 
this proved to be the case, for soon after the announcement of the 
structure and synthesis of pantothenic acid (72) it was proven to be 
identical with the filtrate factor (36) (U6) (8l). 

Pantothenic acid is an organic acid, soluble in water, and 

unstable to heat when in solution. It

is also unstable to acids and alkalis.

It may be noted that in recent years several analogues of the vitamin, 
such as panthenol, and N-methyl pantothenic acid, have been synthesized 
and studied (1) (17) (28) (1|2). 

The biochemical role of pantothenic acid has been the subject of 
considerable investigation during the past few years. The vitamin is 
concerned in both plant and animal metabolism to a much greater extent 
than was originally thought. The most important physiological action of

pantothenic acid in the animal body is now considered to be its connec¬ 
tion with vital processes which involve acetylation (5>l)* Its particular 
role here is as a component of coenzyme A, which is required for one 
type of pyruvic acid oxidation (56) (57) (62)* In addition to its role 
in acetylation it is considered likely that coenzyme A, and thus panto¬ 
thenic acid, is involved in carbohydrate, fat and steroid synthesis. 

The vitamin functions in the control of respiration of widely different 
cells, and is concerned with the maintenance of the health of the spinal 
cord, nerves, adrenal glands, and of skin and fur (79)* Pantothenic 
acid is believed to play a part in the prevention of certain types of 
anemia ( 13 ) and it is also thought that the vitamin has a role in the 
control of the water and salt balance of the body. Other possible func¬ 
tions are being investigated. Pantothenic acid is thought to be involved 
in the utilization of certain other vitamins, particularly riboflavin 
( 79 ), and evidence has been put forward indicating interrelationships 
with biotin, folic acid and with vitamin (83)* 

Pantothenic acid occurs as such, to a limited extent, in natural 
materials. A large proportion of the vitamin is present naturally in 
various conjugated or bound forms which have been studied quite extern 
sively (8) ( 38 ) (5U) (56) (82). It is generally believed that coenzyme 
A is the most widespread of pantothenic acid conjugates, and that it 
contains a large part of the cellular pantothenic acid. However, several 
other bound forms have been identified, one of these being the newly 
discovered L. bulgaricus factor ( 8 ) ( 38 ) (56) (82). The availability 
of bound forms of pantothenic acid for animals has not been extensively 
studied although a report by Lih et al » (ill) has stated that all the 
known naturally occurring bound forms of pantothenic acid are available 


to the rat

The importance of pantothenic acid has been studied from several 
points of view during the past few years through the medium of small 
animal experimentation. Melampy and Northrop (1$), working with mice, 
found that animals on a pantothenic acid deficient ration survived only 
six to seven weeks. A deficiency resulted in weight losses in the heart, 
kidney and liver, but little, if any, in the brain. Deficiencies resulted 
also in a decrease in the tissue content of the vitamin, with the excep¬ 
tion of the heart where an increase occurred. The average daily urinary 
and fecal excretion decreased from 80 to 96 percent after a six week 
period on a pantothenic acid deficient ration. 

Carter et al. (13), studying pantothenic acid deficiencies in 
rats, have noted that a severe hypochromic anemia developed in about 
60 percent of the cases. The anemia was characterized by a decrease in 
hemoglobin, erythrocytes and polymorphonuclear leucocytes. It was found 
during the course of these experiments that the administration of panto¬ 
thenic acid would restore the blood to normal in a proportion of cases, 
but that treatment had to be begun early if it were to be successful. 

Pilgrim et al. (62) have reported a decrease in pyruvate oxi¬ 
dation in the livers of pantothenic acid and biotin deficient rats as 
compared to normal animals. This was considered as an indication that 
these vitamins were components of the enzyme systems concerned with the 
metabolism of pyruvate. Olson and Kaplan (58) found that rats main¬ 
tained on pantothenic acid free diets for periods up to nine weeks 
maintained normal coenzyme A content in their tissues for two to three 
weeks and then showed a gradual depletion to 35 to I4D percent of normal* 
Adding pantothenic acid to these diets increased the coenzyme A content 
of the tissues and the ability to utilize pyruvate. 

A report by Supplee et al* (7U) indicated weight losses and

dermatitis in rats deprived of pantothenic acid* Damage to the cortical 
layer of the adrenal glands has also been reported by these workers. 

Such damage, in turn, caused bleeding, wasting away and finally death 
of the tissue, and a cessation of the cortical hormone secretions 
which control the water and salt balance of the body. The observations 
of the latter workers are substantiated by Figge and Atkinson (19) who 
reported that partial dehydration of rats has produced the most con¬ 
spicuous symptoms of pantothenic acid deficiency, i.e. porphyrin incrust¬ 
ations on the nose and fur. 

The fact that pantothenic acid is required by poultiy for 
growth, reproduction and maintenance of normal metabolism has le'ci to 
considerable investigation of the vitamin in this field. Gillis, et 
al. (21) (22) (23) have established that pantothenic acid is required 
for hatchability in eggs. A deficiency of the vitamin resulted in 
embryonic mortality which was found to occur almost entirely during 
the last two or three days of incubation. It was found also that the 
hatchability of eggs from depleted hens returned to normal after one 
to two weeks of pantothenic acid supplementation. 

Further effects of pantothenic acid deficiency in poultry have 
been studied in some detail by several workers. Ram (63) found, in 
experiments using pantothenate deficient synthetic diets, that the 
pantothenic acid deficiency syndrome was characterized by a specific 
•type of dermatosis affecting the skin on the dorsal surface oj. the 
feet, corners of the mouth and eyelids. They also noted stunted 
growth, and retarded and rough feathering, as well as thymus involution, 
eroded gizzard lining, slight thickening of the proventricuius, and 
distended gall bladder.

Shaw and Phillips (68) have made neuropathologic studies of 
pantothenic acid deficient chicks, and have reported a widespread 
nyelin and axon degeneration in the spinal cord. No accompanying 
degeneration in the peripheral nerves was noted in these studies. 
Tissue assay results reported by Snell et al. (70) have shown that 
in a pantothenic acid deficient state, the tissues contain only 30 
to 70 percent as much pantothenic acid per gm, as do tissues from 
chicks receiving sufficient amounts of the vitamin to meet their re¬ 
quirements* 

The actual requirement of chicks for pantothenic acid has 
been estimated by Jukes and McELroy (37) to be about one mg, per 
100 gm, of diet. This requirement Y/as found by these workers to 
be lowered somewhat when a preliminary depletion period was omit¬ 
ted. The requirement stated above has been generally substantiated 
in more recent investigations (29) (kQ)* A level of 0.8 mg. per 
100 gm. of diet has been found to be sufficient for normal hatch- 
ability. Turkey poults have been found to require a somewhat 
higher level of pantothenic acid in their diets than chicks (1|0). 

Requirements have been established for certain other species. 
In their studies with mice, lelampy and Northrop (i+8) reported that 
30 -v of d-calcium pantothenate per gm. of purified diet was adequate 
to maintain body weight and normal levels of the vitamin in the 
tissue of adult males. Unna (75) found the requirement of the rat 
to be approximately 80 > per day* 

There is, at present, some controversy concerning the role 
of pantothenic acid in human nutrition. However, although no defi¬ 
ciency symptoms have been reported a level of nine to 12 mg. per

25>00 Calories is recommended for maintenance of a state of good health (2U) • 

Ruminants do not appear to require a dietary source of pantothenic 
acid, as they are able to synthesize the vitamin in the rumen in sufficient 
quantities to meet their requirements (ltf) (b9)* 

Evidence has been put forward indicating that the horse does re¬ 
quire a dietary source of pantothenic acid* Pearson and Schmidt (60), in 
experiments carried on with Shetland ponies reported that about 38 V. per 
kg* of liveweight per day is necessary for normal growth and health in the 
horse. Intestinal synthesis does meet a part of this requirement accord¬ 
ing to Maynard (U7) • The experiments of Pearson and Schmidt indicated 
that the amount of pantothenic acid excreted by the horse is definitely 
influenced by the amount ingested. 

The role of pantothenic acid in swine nutrition has been studied 
extensively in the United States during the past several years. It has 
been shown repeatedly that this class of livestock requires a dietary 
source of the vitamin, and that a deficiency can have very serious effects. 
Hughes and Ittner (3k), using a purified diet of sugar, casein, salts and 
vitamins other than pantothenic acid determined the minimum requirement 
of pantothenic acid for the growing pig. They found that the minimum 
requirement of pantothenic acid lies between 7*8 and 11.8 mg. per 100 lb. 
of pig daily. In the trial they added various levels of c§lcium panto¬ 
thenate equivalent to 0, 3*6, 7.8 and 11.8 mg. of pantothenic acid per 
100 lb. of pig daily, and used rate of growth and other deficiency symp¬ 
toms as the criteria* 

Hughes (32) reported that young pigs fed a diet deficient in 
pantothenic acid developed subnormal appetites, grew slowly, became thin 
and emaciated, showed a lack of coordination, and goose stepped. There 
was also some loss of hair, and autopsy showed gastritis and involvement

of the large intestine. McMillen et al. (JO) have reported pantothenic 
acid deficiencies in swine fed a diet of corn, soybean oil meal, casein, 
minerals and vitamins other than pantothenic acid. Animals being fed 
this ration made slower and less economical gains than animals on a 
control ration of the same constituents plus 2j mg. of calcium panto¬ 
thenate per lb. of ration. Deficient animals began goose stepping in 
seven weeks, and shoY/ed locomotor incoordination and myelin degeneration. 
Severe diarrhea was also present. Further experiments by McMillen et al . 
reported at the same time showed that a ration of 77 percent corn, 20 
percent soybean oil meal and three percent of a mineral mix, plus a 
supplement of vitamins other than pantothenic acid was not satisfactory. 
This basal ration Yrtiich produced deficiency symptoms contained, by micro¬ 
biological assay, U*21 mg. of pantothenic acid per pound. Blood levels 
of pantothenic acid in animals showing symptoms of a deficiency were 
found to be approximately two-fifths of those in animals receiving the 
same ration supplemented with calcium pantothenate. 

In similar trials, Luecke et al. (UJ) found that growing pigs 
fed a basal ration of corn, casein, soybean oil meal, minerals and vitamins 
except pantothenic acid developed typical pantothenic acid deficiency 
symptoms, including poor growth, locomotor incoordination and myelin 
degeneration. The symptoms did not appear until the seventh week of the 
experiment. The same ration, with pantothenic acid added, produced good 
growth and increased the efficiency of feed utilization. A separate 
trial, using a basal ration of com, casein and minerals, plus other 
known required vitamins produced more severe deficiency symptoms, and a 
severe diarrhea. Blood and urine analyses were carried out on the animals 
used in the experiments. Urinary excretion showed wide variation within 
lots, while blood levels of the vitamin were quite uniform within each

group* Large differences in favor of the supplemented lots were noted 
in both urinary excretion and blood levels* 

Further work by Luecke et al. (Ui) with a ration of corn and 
soybean oil meal, minerals and required vitamins other than pantothenic 
acid illustrated definitely that the locomotor incoordination was a 
result of pantothenic acid deficiency* A group of pigs fed the basal 
ration plus all known required vitamins including pantothenic acid made 
good growth and was normal in all respects* Ihere pantothenic acid alone 
was added to the basal ration, poor growth and unthriftiness was noted, 
but there was no incoordination. The lot receiving all required vitamins 
except pantothenic acid showed a definite incoordination, and the other 
characteristic symptoms of a pantothenic acid deficiency. Growth differ¬ 
ences attributable to pantothenic acid were significant, and blood levels 
of the vitamin in animals showing deficiency symptoms were about two- 
fifths of the normal levels of 1.0 to 2.0 v per ml* of whole blood* 

Wiese et al * (76) have produced a pantothenic acid deficiency in 
baby pigs, and have found the characteristic deficiency symptoms. Forty- 
eight hour old pigs were placed on an artificial milk diet of casein, 
cerelose, lard, salts and all known required vitamins except pantothenic 
acid. The deficiency produced was characterized by poor growth, loss of 
appetite, scours, lachrymation, dermatitis, coughing, loss of the suck¬ 
ling reflex, a dark brown exudate around the eyes, spastic gait, goose 
stepping and low urinary excretion of pantothenic acid. Adding one mg. 
of pantothenic acid to the ration of each pig daily stopped the scours 
and improved the appetite, but failed to improve any of the other symp¬ 
toms. However, addition of from 10 to 20 mg. of pantothenic acid to the 
daily ration resulted in complete recovery, and a great improvement in 
appetite and growth rate.

The necessity of pantothenic acid for normal reproduction in 
swine has been indicated by Hodgskiss et al. (31). These workers have 
reported results of reproduction experiments with gilts which were fed 
a purified ration of 26.1 percent casein, 57.7 percent sucrose, 11.0 
percent lard and 5.2 percent of a mineral mix* The ration was tested 
with supplements of all known necessary vitamins, and with all known 
necessary vitaniins except pantothenic acid. On the ration which included 
all the vitamins, gilts conceived and farrowed, but some pigs were in the 
process of resorption when born. All of the pigs were weak, showed signs 
of a nervous disorder, and died within 36 hours of farrowing. Animals 
receiving the pantothenic acid deficient ration displayed a typical 
deficiency syndrome, i.e., loss of appetite, reduced water intake, goose 
stepping with the hind legs and an exudate on the skin. There was also 
diarrhea and rectal hemorrhage. The gilts conceived but showed no signs 
of pregnancy. Autopsy revealed partially resorbed, macerating fetuses in 
the uterine horns of the animals, as well as gastro enteritis in the gilts. 

The complementary effects of certain other vitamins on the panto¬ 
thenic acid requirement of swine, and the possibility of interrelationships 
of pantothenic acid with other vitamins have been the subject of several 
investigations in recent years. Ellis et al. (18) reported experiments 
with heated diets, which indicated that although calcium pantothenate 
greatly reduced the incidence and severity of locomotor incoordination 
in swine, pyridoxine seemed to be necessary for full prevention of the 
disorder. There was also some evidence that lack of choline was partially 
responsible for the symptoms. It was felt, however, that the rather 
frequent occurrence of locomotor incoordination in growing swine fed 
normal coin rations was due to borderline levels of pantothenic acid 
rather than of the other vitamins mentioned.

Briggs and Beeson (7) fed weanling pigs a practical, mixed animal 
and plant protein ration, supplemented with vitamin B-^ and aureomycin. 

It was shown that while the simultaneous addition of riboflavin, niacin 
and pantothenic acid increased the average daily gain by ten percent, and 
decreased the feed consumed per 100 lb. gain by 13 percent, single addi¬ 
tions of either riboflavin or calcium pantothenate failed to improve growth 
rate markedly, and exerted only a slight favorable effect on feed efficiency* 
The basal ration used in these experiments was a high quality one of yellow 
com, soybean oil meal, fish meal, meat and bone scraps, cottonseed meal, 
alfalfa meal, minerals and vitamin A and D feeding oil. No diarrhea or 
any other B-complex deficiency symptoms were observed in any of the groups 

Bennison et al. (1;) noted no significant interactions between panto¬ 
thenic acid and vitamin B-^* However, experiments reported by Luecke £b 
al . (Ij 3) have indicated that there may be a complementary effect here. The 
latter workers found that on an 18 percent protein ration, a combination of 
vitamin and pantothenic acid did not prove in any way superior to 
either of the vitamins alone; but that on a 1$ percent protein ration the 
combined feeding of vitamin B-^ and pantothenic acid did yield some in¬ 
crease in rate of gain over that obtained with the same ration with either 
of the vitamins added singly* 

Microbiological assays for pantothenic acid have been carried out 
by numerous workers in the field of vitamin research since the discovery 
of the importance of this vitamin. The accuracy of values obtained for 
the pantothenic acid content of various materials by the use of micro¬ 
biological methods has been the subject of some controversy, and as a 
result of this quite a variety of methods has been proposed for releasing 
bound pantothenic acid to a form available to test microorganisms* As the 
vitamin is acid and alkali labile, the use of either acid or alkaline

hydrolysis procedures is totally impractical, so that the methods used 
must be confined to either water or enzymatic hydrolysis* Earlier pro¬ 
cedures used included direct addition (3), water hydrolysis (3) (53 )> 
digestion with such enzymes as clarase or papain (53) or a mixture of 
papain and takadiastase (61;)• 

Two hydrolysis procedures which have been proposed more recently 
are now being generally used, and are considered to be more effective 
than previous methods for releasing bound pantothenic acid. These are: 
digestion with mylase P, or digestion with a mixture of a liver enzyme 
and an alkaline phosphatase. The digestion procedure involving the use 
of mylase P has been and is being quite widely used (35) (9) (10)* The 
method releases a considerable amount of bound pantothenic acid, and has . 
a distinct advantage in that enzyme blanks are very low (10) as the panto¬ 
thenic acid content of mylase P is negligible. 

Although the procedure involving mylase P for digestion is much 
more effective than autolysis alone in releasing pantothenic acid from 
natural materials, the values obtained on extracts prepared in this manna? 
are still somewhat below those obtained by chick assay of similar materials 
(26). The mixture of liver enzyme and alkaline phosphatase is therefore 
being tentatively recommended, as this procedure has been shown to permit 
a closer approximation to complete release of bound pantothenic acid than 
do other methods. However, no standardized procedure for the use of these 
two enzymes with various natural materials can yet be given ( 26 ), and it 
is still not certain that all of the pantothenic acid in natural materials 
is being released. A "blank” sample containing only the enzyme preparations 
is always run, and the pantothenic acid oontent found is subtracted from 
that found for the digested samples. The pantothenic acid content of the 
enzyme mixture is relatively high (55)*

The organism 1. casei £ was used extensively as the test organism 
in the earlier assays for pantothenic acid (53) (6l) (73)* tut it has been 
largely replaced in recent years by L. arabinosus 17-5* The nutritional 
requirements of this latter organism have been shown to be considerably 
simpler than those of L. casei (26)• The basis of the assay media has 
been, in all cases reviewed, either hydrolyzed casein or alkali treated 
peptone properly supplemented to supply all necessary ingredients for 
growth of the test organism used ( 30 ) (53) (6l) ( 65 ) (73)• 

Pantothenic acid values for a variety of feeds, and for the blood 
and milk of certain species have been determined by various workers. Re¬ 
ported values that have a relation to the present study are listed in 
Table 1. It may be noted that no evidence has been found (15) to indicate 
that any of the pantothenic acid in milk is in a form unavailable to L. 
casei or L. arabinosus.

EXPERIMENTAL 


A series of experiments was carried out to determine whether the 
swine rations commonly used in We stern Canada contained sufficient panto¬ 
thenic acid for normal growth, reproduction and lactation. Barley, supple¬ 
mented with a mixed protein supplement, minerals and vitamins A and D when 
necessary was used exclusively in the experimental rations. Barley is, 
generally speaking, lower in pantothenic acid content than either wheat or 
oats, so it was assumed that if an all barley ration proved adequate inso¬ 
far as its content of the vitamin was concerned, the findings could be 
applied generally to small grain rations. 

Experiment I - Pantothenic Acid Requirements for Growth and Fattening 

Four lots of six purebred Yorkshire pigs from the University herd 
were started on experimental rations at an average weight of approximately 
35 lb. The lots were made up on a littermate basis with as uniform as 
possible distribution as to weight and vigor, and with two males and four 
fema3.es in each lot. All pigs in this and subsequent experiments were 
treated with sodium fluoride to remove round worms ( Ascaris lumbricoides ) 
prior to going on experiment. The dams of the pigs were fed a basal ration 
of oats, barley and a lj.0 percent protein supplement, and vitamin A and D 
feeding oil,during pregnancy and lactation. The pigs, during the period 
between weaning and going on experiment were fed a ration of oats, barley, 
alfalfa meal and the same protein supplement, which included tankage and 
fish meal. 

The trial was begun May 22, 1950. The control rations shown in 
Table 2 were fed in lot 1, with varying amounts of supplemental calcium 
pantothenate being added in the test lots.

During period 1 up to 110 lb. in weight each lot was fed daily 
U8 ml. of a 1200 A - 200 D vitamin feeding oil spread evenly over the 
diy morning feed. The pigs were hand fed three times daily from the 
start of the experiment until they reached an average weight of 110 lb., 
and twice dally thereafter until reaching a weight of 200 lb. They were 
fed all they would clean up in 30 minutes, and water was added after 
each feeding at the rate of two and one half lb. per lb. of feed. The 
animals were housed indoors, and did not have access to either pasture or 
soil. Pens were kept as clean as possible in order that access to feces 
be kept at a minimum* Feed was weighed to each lot at each feeding, and 
suitable records were kept. 

The pigs were weighed individually at 1U day intervals, and 
more frequently as they approached market weight. At an average weight 
of 200 lb., the two males, and one female in each lot were marketed. 

Dominion Government grades were determined on each carcass of the 
experimental pigs slaughtered. The remaining three females in each lot 
were retained for use in the reproduction experiment.

beginning of the experiment, and at six and twelve weeks thereafter . 
The animals were watched carefully for any symptoms of a deficiency. 


Experiment II - Pantothenic Acid Requirements for Growth and Fattening 

A second growth trial was commenced on Sept. 26, 1950, for the 
purpose of checking results obtained in the previous experiment. The 
design and procedure followed were the same as used in Experiment I, with 
the following exceptions: The allotment was not made so as to include 
four females and two males in each lot, as all the animals used in this 
trial were marketed upon reaching a weight of 200 lb. Pigs in this and 
all subsequent experiments were self-fed. The upper level of pantothenic 
acid supplement used in Experiment I (12 mg. of calcium pantothenate per 
lb. of feed) was eliminated, and replaced by a h»5 mg. per lb. level. 
Thus, the rations used in Experiment II were supplemented as shown in

The gilts were weighed at the time of breeding, immediately pre¬ 
ceding farrowing, and just after farrowing. The animals farrowed between 
April 16 and May 19, 1951, and individual weights of the pigs in each 
litter were recorded at birth and at one, three, six and eight weeks of 
age. 

Blood and milk samples were obtained from each sow at one and six 
weeks postpartum. Blood samples were taken also from two pigs, one of 
each sex, which were selected as representative of each litter, at one and 
six weeks after birth. The method of obtaining blood samples was similar 
to that used by Carle and Dewhirst (12), and milk samples were obtained 
by the use of oxytocin in a method similar to the one employed by Braude 
et al. (6). These samples were assayed microbiologically for pantothenic 
acid using a procedure similar to that of itay et al. (6I4.) • 

The pigs were weaned at eight weeks of age, and selection of the 
animals to be used in Experiment IV was made. 

Experiment IV - Second Gene ration Study of Pantothenic Acid Requirements 
~~ ■ ” ' for Growth and Fattening 

The animals allotted to the four lots of six pigs each in this 
third feeding trial were selected from the litters of sows which had re¬ 
ceived the same levels of supplementary pantothenic acid tliroughout their 
lives as the lots were to receive in this experiment. The lots were made 
up with as uniform as possible distribution as to sex, weight and vigor. 

The rations and levels of calcium pantothenate used, and other experimental 
procedures were the same as in Experiment I. In this instance, however, 
no provision was mad.e for retaining any of the animals for further 
experiments•

It was found necessary to terminate this trial at the end of the 
first period. Shortly after the pigs had reached 110 lb. in weight several 
of them contracted an infection, and began to lose weight. They soon be¬ 
came emaciated to such an extent that it was considered unfeasible to 
continue the experiment. 

Autopsies were carried out on several animals. A typical post¬ 
mortem examination of one of the affected animals revealed the following: 
The apices of the lungs were consolidated* the stomach and intestines were 
chronically inflamed, with round worms being noted; and there was peri¬ 
carditis. Also noted were abscesses on the tail and right hind leg. The 
affected organs were cultured and two pathogenic organisms isolated. A 
Pasteurella suiseptica was isolated from the lungs, and Corynebacterium 
pyogenes from the leg and tail lesions. The round worm infestation in this 
animal was probably due to its extreme weakened condition, as the parasites 
had not been found prevalent in two other affected animals which had been 
autopsied previously, and all animals had been treated for worms prior to 
going on experiment. 

Experiment IV was initiated July 23, and terminated on October 3* 
1951. The average protein and pantothenic acid content of the ration used 
was as shown in Table 8.

Microbiological Assays 

The pantothenic acid content of the blood and milk samples 
obtained from the sows and young pigs used in Experiment III was deter¬ 
mined microbiologically. Assays were conducted on a semimicro scale in 
which the final volume was 2 ml. The composition of the basal medium 
used in the assays was similar to that described by Riesen et al. (65)* 

So far as is known, this type of medium, wherein the casein or peptone 
is replaced by a solution of pure amino acids has not been used pre¬ 
viously for the assay of pantothenic acid. The medium was found very 
satisfactory, and yielded extremely low blanks. 

Two procedures were used in the preparation of samples for 
assay i.e. water and enzymatic hydrolysis. The latter procedure in¬ 
volved digestion of the sample with a fungal enzyme, mylase P. Blood and 
milk samples were prepared for assay by a method based on that used by 
Ray et al. (61;) with several modifications being made to adapt the 
method to the purposes of this assay. All samples were assayed in 
duplicate, and values reported were obtained in at least two replicate 
assays. Recoveries were run along with the samples at regular intervals, 
and were in almost all cases betvreen 90 and 110 percent. 

Details of the hydrolysis procedures used, and of the assay 


method are described in the Appendix,

During the growing period to 110 lb. there appeared to be a slight 
trend toward increased gain and feed efficiency favoring the lots receiving 
the calcium pantothenate supplemented rations. As may be seen in Table 9* 
the average daily gains increased consistently, although very slightly, 
with increasing amounts of the vitamin in the ration. The same general 
trend was indicated for over—all feed efficiency. The differences in

A reversal of the trend seen in period 1 occurred during the 
finishing period, at least insofar as average daily gains were concerned. 
This indicated that, if pantothenic acid was of any value in increasing 
daily rate of gain, the effect manifested itself prior to the finishing 
period. The situation with regard to feed efficiencies during this 
period was erratic with no trend being established. 

Results for the complete feeding period of Experiment I are

The rate of gain, feed consumption and feed efficiency of all lots 
were similar throughout the overall growing and finishing period* However, 
it appeared that there might have been a slight beneficial effect from the 
added vitamin in the earlier stages of growth as indicated in Table 9* 

As a result of the average daily gain picture, shown in Experiment 
I, it was decided that the 12 mg. per lb. level of supplementation would 
be deleted from Experiment II, and replaced with one of U.5 ^g* P er lb* 

Any possible heneficial effects of the vitamin on growth appeared to have 
been obtained on a supplemental level not higher than six mg* per lb. of 
calcium pantothenate. 

Table 12 shows the average hemoglobin content of the blood of the 
pigs used in Experiment I. Allotment was made prior to determining hemo¬ 
globin levels so that they did not enter into distribution of the pigs.

As may be seen from Table 13, there were no evident effects of 
supplementing the basal ration with calcium pantothenate. Both the 
average daily gain and the feed required per 100 lb. gain were similar 
in all lots. It was therefore evident that the possible trend in daily 
gain and feed efficiency, which had been noted in period 1 of the first 
trial, was due to chance only# 

Results during the finishing period from 110 to 200 lb. are shown 
in Table lU.

Although the two lots receiving the highest levels of calcium 
pantothenate did make the best gains during period 2, the fact that there 
were no significant differences, and that lot 2 made slower gains than the 
controls must be taken as ample indication that differences between lots 
were due to chance. The same applies to feed efficiencies, even though 
the three lots receiving supplemental calcium pantothenate did require 
slightly less feed per 100 lb. gain.

As in the previous trial, the calcium pantothenate had no effect 
on rate of gain, feed consumption or feed efficiency. It would appear 
that normal variation accounted for any slight differences which occurred 
during either of the trials. 

It may be noted here that, of those pigs which were sold com¬ 
mercially 5>0 percent of the carcasses graded A and $0 percent graded % 
in Experiment I, and 86 percent graded A and 111 percent graded Bj, in 
Experiment II. No differences in the grades between lots were obtained.

Three gilts were retained from each of the four lots in Experi¬ 
ment I, and managed and fed as indicated previously. Each animal was

The gains made by the gilts in the four lots 

were quite 

uniform 


during the interval between the end of Experiment I and the date of 
breeding. The animals in lot 2 gained somewhat faster during the gesta¬ 
tion period than did those in lots 1, 3 and b with average gains in lot 
2 being slightly greater than is normally desired in the first gestation 
period. Decreases in weight after farrowing were normal in all cases. 

ihere was no indication that the level of supplemental calcium panto¬ 
thenate had any effect whatsoever on the gains made by the animals 
between the time they reached a weight of 200 lb. and the time they 
farrowed.

sows, and averages for each of the four lots

It may be seen that the average number of pigs bora per litter 
increased somewhat with increasing levels of pantothenic acid in the sows’ 
rations. However, the only notable difference occurred between lots 1 
and 2, and this difference must be attributed to the fact that one of the 
litters in lot 1 was unusually small. This fact, in turn, cannot be attri¬ 
buted to a lack of pantothenic acid, as the other litter in the same lot 
was one of the largest# 

The percentage survival in the four lots varied to such an extent 
that there was no indication of an effect of supplemental calcium panto¬ 
thenate on survival at weaning time. The percentages of the pigs born 
which were surviving at weaning time were 93, 83, 97 and 67 percent for 
lots 1, 2, 3 and H respectively* 

Table 18 indicates the average weight per pig in the various lit¬ 
ters at different stages during the suckling period. Analysis of variance 
was carried out on birth and weaning weights.

*Tt is recognized that the use of the individual weights of the pigs in 

the various litters in each lot as independent measures of treatment 
effect is subject to criticism. For this reason no definite conclusions 
have been drawn from the results of the analysis of variance on this 
particular data. 
































The table illustrates a definite trend towards decreasing average 
weights with increasing levels of pantothenic acid in the dams* rations. 

Even when due consideration is given to the fact that one of the two litters 
in lot 1 was unusually small, which resulted in the average weights of the 
pigs in that litter being greater than those of any of the other animals in 
the experiment, the fact that highly significant differences were found in¬ 
dicates a possible treatment effect. However, the recognized Y/eaknesses of 
the statistical analysis as applied to these particular data permit no 
definite statement on this point. 


Experiment IV 

As has been previously stated, it was found necessary to terminate 
this trial at the end of period 1, so that data are available only for the 
growth period to an average weight of 110 lb. The results obtained are 
shown in Table 19*

As may be noted in the table, lots 1 and 2, and lots 3 and 1; 
respectively were practically identical as to rate of gain, feed consump¬ 
tion and feed efficiency* Once again no definite differences were noted 
among the various lots. The fact that lots 3 and U made slower and less 
efficient gains may be explained, in part at least, by the fact that the 
acute infection which resulted in the termination of the experiment may 
have been already present in a chronic form, and was having an adverse 
effect on the pigs. It was the animals in these two lots which were most 
extensively involved. As pigs from the litters in lots 3 and I 4 . were 
weaned at lighter weights than those from lots 1 and 2 , they may have 
been less thrifty at the time of allotment*

As may be seen by comparing Tables 20 and 21, enzymatic digestion 
of the samples gave consistently higher values for pantothenic acid, and 
the increase in values obtained appeared to be considerably greater in the 
case of sows* blood than in the blood of the young pigs. It may be noted 

i 

also that the pantothenic acid content of the sows* blood increased as the 
stage of lactation advanced, while the content of the vitamin decreased in 
the blood of the young pigs as they grew older. There was no indication 
that the sex of the young pigs had any influence on the pantothenic acid 
content of their blood. Although blood levels tended to correlate with 
levels of pantothenic acid in the ration, significant differences between

lots were not present insofar as the content of pantothenic acid in the 
blood was concerned. The above mentioned points will be discussed 
later. 

Results of the assays carried out on milk samples obtained from 
the sows used in Experiment III are shown in Table 22. Values obtained 
in assays following both water and enzymatic hydrolysis are included. 
An aly sts of variance was carried out on values obtained ior pantothenic

The results shown indicate that the pantothenic acid content 
of the sows 1 ration had a very definite effect on the amounts of the 
vitamin present in the milk, as the milk levels increased consistently 
and quite markedly with the amount of calcium pantothenate added to the 
basal ration. It may be seen also that the pantothenic acid content of 
the sows' milk increased as the lactation period progressed. A possible 
explanation for the low values obtained on the milk samples following 
enzymatic hydrolysis will be discussed later.

DISCUSSION 


A consideration of the results of the first generation growth 
trials in Experiments I and II, which are outlined in Tables 9 to lS* 
leads to the conclusion that the control ration used contained adequate 
amounts of pantothenic acid. No signs of a pantothenic acid deficiency 
occurred in the control lots, and no response that even approached sig¬ 
nificance occurred as a result of supplementing the ration with calcium 
pantothenate. As has been mentioned, some indication of a beneficial 
effect of calcium pantothenate supplementation was obtained during the 
earlier growing period of Experiment I, However this was not significant 
and was not substantiated in any way throughout the remainder of this 
experiment, or in Experiment II. Daily gain, feed consumption and feed 
efficiency differences were nothingmore than Yrould be expected due to 
normal variation. 

Because of the fact that little work has been done concerning 
pantothenic acid deficiencies in small grain rations it is rather hard 
to compare the results obtained in these experiments with those obtained 
by other workers* However, it may be noted that Briggs and Beeson (7)* 
using a high quality, well balanced ration based on corn found that 
calcium pantothenate failed to improve growth rate markedly and exerted 
only a slight favorable effect on feed efficiency* 

It is notable also that pantothenic acid deficiencies are easily 
produced, and symptoms are quite obvious, in cases where rations are 
definitely deficient (iili) (US) (SO). This fact may be considered as 
lending strength to the inference, made on the ba.sis of the results of 
Experiments I and II, that the control ration used contained sufficient 
pantothenic acid to meet the growth requirements of the animals concerned*

It may also be stated, at this point, that as barley contains less panto¬ 
thenic acid than the other small grains it appears unlikely that typical 
balanced rations based on wheat or oats would be deficient in this 
vitamin* 

As may be seen in Table 12 the hemoglobin determinations which 
were carried out gave no indication that the level of pantothenic acid 
in the ration had any effect on hemoglobin levels in the blood of the 
pigs. This may possibly be further evidence to the effect that the con¬ 
trol ration used contained adequate amounts of the vitamin, for, although 
lowered hemoglobin levels are not necessarily characteristic of a panto¬ 
thenic acid deficiency, they have been reported (13) (lU) * 

The gilts retained for use in Experiment III gained evenly 
and normally during the prebreeding period. The fact that the two re¬ 
maining gilts in lot 2 as is illustrated in Table 16 gained more rapidly 
than those in lots 1, 3 and 1> during the gestation period was considered 
as being due largely to chance but possibly, to some extent at least to 
the fact that there may have been less quarreling and competition for 
feed than in the other lots. There were triree animals in each of the 
other lots throughout most of the gestation period, as the unbred animal 
in lot 1 was kept with the other two in the hope that she would conceive 
in time for use in the experiments. As further indicated in Table 16, 
weight decreases in all lots at the time of farrowing were normal, and 
did not differ to any extent. It may therefore be said that supplemental 
pantothenic acid had no visual effect on the experimental animals between 
the time they reached a weight of 200 lb. and the beginning of their 
first lactation. 

The average number of pigs farrowed as is shown in Table 17 * 
appeared to increase with the level of calcium pantothenate in the

ration. However, when consideration is taken of the fact that one of 
the litters in lot 1 was unusually small, the differences are no greater 
than would have been expected due to normal variation. Likewise, the 
number of pigs surviving at weaning time was unaffected by the amount 
of pantothenic acid in the dams* ration. The mortality rate was un¬ 
usually high in one litter in lot U* but normal variation may be con¬ 
sidered to have accounted for all differences as there was no significant 
trend. 

The average weights of the suckling pigs showed a definite 
downward trend, with the weights decreasing as the level of calcium 
pantothenate in the sows* rations was increased. As may be seen in 
Table 18, statistical analysis showed that there may have been a treat¬ 
ment effect involved. The highly significant differences in birth weights, 
between lots 1 and h, and in weaning weights, between lots 1 and 3 and 
lots 1 and U indicated that in some way, the higher levels of supplemental 
calcium pantothenate being added to the dams 1 rations may have had a 
detrimental effect on the well-being of their offspring. 

Tables 20 and 21 show that blood levels of pantothenic acid 
tended to increase in both sows and young pigs with the level of the 
vitamin in the sows * ration. This trend appeared to be quite regular, 
although several values were obtained for individual animals which were 
considerably out of line, and none of the differences were statistically 
significant. Values obtained following enzymatic digestion of samples 
were higher, as may be noted by comparing tables 20 and 21, than those 
obtained following water hydrolysis. This would indicate that some of 
the blood pantothenic acid exists in a bound form, which observation 
agrees with work reported by Wright (82). The increase in values obtained 








was considerably greater for sows than for young pigs, which possibly 
indicates that a greater proportion of bound pantothenic acid existed 
in the blood of the older animals. It may be noted also that the panto¬ 
thenic acid level in the blood of the sows increased, as lactation pro¬ 
gressed, while that in the pigs decreased. A possible explanation for 
these "reverse" trends is that the high level found in the young pigs 
at one week of age had come about as a result of prenatal depletion of 
the sows in order to build up the levels of the young pigs. Ihile the 
sows were able to increase their levels after farrowing, the young pigs 
were unable to maintain the high levels per ml. of blood from the amounts 
available to them in the milk. Although there are no comparable results 
of other workers with which to compare these findings, a similar occur¬ 
rence takes place in the case of certain other blood constituents of 
swine. The work of Grummer et al. ( 25 ) shows a similar trend with 
several other vitamins. 

Results of assays conducted on milk samples, as shown in Table 
22, indicated that the level of pantothenic acid in the sows 1 ration 
was reflected in milk levels of the vitamin. The milk levels in lot U 
at one and s:bc weeks, and in lot 3 at six weeks after parturition were 
higher by either a significant or highly significant degree.than the 
respective levels in the control lot. Throughout the other lots there 
was a definite trend toward increased levels of the vitamin m the milk 
as the level in the ration increased. Differences in milk levels of 
pantothenic acid tended to be wider than corresponding differences in 
the blood. This was not surprising since the blood tends to remain 
reasonably constant in the level of most nutrients, while secretions 
and places of storage of various constituents may vary widely in content of

that same nutrient. It was also noted that an increase in milk panto¬ 
thenic acid levels occurred between one and six weeks after farrowing, 
an increase which was more marked as the level of the vitamin in the 
ration was increased. This was considered logical, since the percentage 
of the vitamin which was being ingested that was utilized for maintenance 
would be fairly constant, and the quantity of milk being produced had pro¬ 
bably dropped. Hughes and Kart (33 )* in summarizing the literature, have 
noted that maximum milk production in sows occurs three to four weeks 
after parturition, following which there is a drop. 

The fact that the enzyme values were quite consistently lower 
than those obtained following water hydrolysis is a feature of the milk 
assay results which is difficult to explain. The differences, in most 
cases were greater than those encountered between duplicates of either 
kind of hydrolysis, so that normal variation is not the explanation. 

It should be noted here that other workers (15) (39) have reported that 
little or none of the pantothenic acid in milk is in a bound form, so 
that the water hydrolysis values obtained in these experiments may be 
considered as maximum. This would indicate that there was perhaps some 
slight destruction of the vitamin, or of one of its active analogues, 
by the mylase P# 

The results of Experiment IV indicated that supplemental 
pantothenic acid was of no benefit in the grovdng ration used in these 
experiments, even after the pigs were fed for two generations on rations 
containing a basal level of approximately six "v per gm. of the vitamin 
based on microbiological assay. For growing pigs, the National Research 
Council (5>2) recommends U.7 mg* per lb. of feed which is equivalent to 
10.U v of pantothenic acid per gm. of feed. As has been previously

stated* the infection which made termination of the experiment necessary 
possibly had some effect on the results obtained during the experimental 
period* but apart from this there was no indication of anything other than 
normal variation in daily gains* feed consumption and feed efficiency. As 
it would be difficult or impossible to compound a natural Western Canadian 
ration with levels lower than this* it appears likely that supplemental 
pantothenic acid is unnecessary for proper growth and finishing of York¬ 
shire swine. 

In summing up this discussion* it may be said that* on the basis 
of results of experiments reported herein* supplemental pantothenic acid 
was unnecessary in the basal rations used for growth and fattening, and 
for reproduction at least insofar as good health of the sows during ges¬ 
tation and lactation was concerned. Ihirthermore* those results pertaining 
to the well-being of the offspring of the sows in Experiment III would 
indicate that supplemental amounts of the vitamin were unnecessary* and 
perhaps detrimental. The baby pigs whose dams had received the higher 
levels of supplemental pantothenic acid were significantly lighter at 
birth than those in the control lot* and these differences were magnified 
during the lactation period* when the animals suckling sows which were 
receiving a calcium pantothenate supplemented ration ingested considerably 
greater amounts of the vitamin. 

The particular manner in which this seemingly detrimental effect 
was brought about is unknown. It is possible that some type of vitamin 
imbalance was created* for such situations are known to occur (20). vi/hile 
the reports of other workers (7) indicate that multiple vitamin supplements 
including pantothenic acid may be of considerable benefit* our expeliments 
have shown that excessive amounts of unnecessary single vitamins may pro¬ 
duce harmful effects when fed over an extended period of time.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


The investigations reported herein of pantothenic acid supple¬ 
mentation of small grain rations for Yorkshire swine were prompted by the 
reported occurrence of deficiencies of this vitamin in swine fed rations 
based on corn. Barley was used as a basis for formulating the control 
rations, as it has been shown to be the small grain lowest in pantothenic 
acid content. Varying levels of supplemental calcium pantothenate were 
fed during the course of the experiments, to determine if the addition of 
the vitamin had any supplemental effect on the basal ration. 

The experiments included two generation growth trials, and a 
reproduction and lactation experiment. In addition, a study was made 
by means of microbiological assays, of the pantothenic acid content of 
the blood and milk of the sows, and the blood of young pigs selected from 
each litter in the reproduction trial. 

The two first generation growth trials, as well as the second 
generation growth trial yielded results which indicated that no benefit 
was to be obtained from supplementing the control ration used with calcium 
pantothenate. The same indications were noted in the reproduction exper¬ 
iment, at least insofar as the effects of the supplement on the behavior 
of the gilts and the size of litters were concerned. Furthermore, there 
was indication that the pantothenic acid content of the dams* rations, when 
considerably higher than usual in a natural ration, may have had an adverse 
effect on the birth and weaning weights of the pigs in their litters. 

The results of the microbiological assays illustrated the fact 
that the pantothenic acid content of the blood and milk of the sows, and 
the blood of the suckling pigs was related to the content of the vitamin 
in the sows* ration. This was particularly true in the case of the milk. 









where it was found that supplemental calcium pantothenate fed to the 
sows resulted in quite a marked increase in the milk levels of the vitamin. 

From the investigation which has been carried out, the follow¬ 
ing conclusions may be drawn: 

1. The basal rations of barley plus protein and mineral supplements, 
and a vitamin A and D supplement when necessary contained sufficient 
pantothenic acid to promote normal growth and reproduction in 
Yorkshire swine. 

2. Any well balanced small grain ration of the type commonly fed in 
Western Canada will normally contain adequate amounts of this 
vitamin, since the all barley control ration used contained as 
low a level of pantothenic acid as is likely to be present in a 
natural ration of this type. 

3. The amount of pantothenic acid ingested by the sows influenced the 
content of this vitamin in their blood and milk, and in the blood 
of their offspring. 

!w There was a trend to indicate that relatively large amounts of supple¬ 
mental pantothenic acid in the sows' rations may have had a detrimental 
effect on the birth weight and rate of gain of their offspring during 
the suckling period.

APPENDIX 


Procedures Used in the Microbiological Assay for Pantothenic Acid- 

Preparation of Samples 

Feedstuffs: 

The procedure used for the enzymatic hydrolysis of feedstuffs 
was similar to that of Ives and Strong ( 35 ). The same general procedure 
was followed for the water hydrolysis, omitting the digestion with the 
enzyme* 

Enzymatic hydrolysis 

An amount of the finely divided sample estimated to contain 
between three and ten y of pantothenic acid was suspended in £0 ml. of 
distilled water. The suspension was adjusted to pH 6.8 to 7*0 and auto¬ 
claved for 15 minutes at 121° C. After the mixture had reached room 
temperature, an amount of mylase P equivalent to l/lO of the estimated 
dry weight of the sample was added to the flask. The contents were buff¬ 
ered with two ml. of 2.5 M sodium acetate, and the pH lowered to U*8 with 
1 N hydrochloric acid. The mixture was then layered with toluene, covered 
and incubated for 2k hours at 50° C. At the end of the incubation period 
the volume of the digest was increased to 200 ml. with distilled water, 
and it was filtered through a fluted Whatman No. 12 filter paper, several 
filterings being used when necessary, until a clear filtrate was obtained. 

A 50 ml. portion of this filtrate was then neutralized, and further diluted 
to a convenient concentration for assay. 

Water hydrolysis 


As in the case of enzymatic hydrolysis, an amount of the finely 













- 11 - 


divided sample estimated to contain between three and ten v of pantothenic 
acid was suspended in 50 ml. of distilled water. The suspension was 
adjusted to pH 6.8 to 7*0 and autoclaved for 1$ minutes at 121° C. After 
the mixture had reached room temperature, the contents were buffered with 
two ml. of 2.5 M sodium acetate, and the pH lowered to U.8 with 1 N 
hydrochloric acid. The volume of the digest was then increased to 200 
ml. with distilled water, and it was filtered through a fluted Whatman 
no. 12 filter paper, repeatedly when necessary, until a clear filtrate 
was obtained. A 50 ml. portion of this filtrate was then neutralized and 
diluted to convenient concentration for assay. 

Blood and Milk : 

The procedure used for the preparation of blood and milk samples 
was based on that described by Ray et al. (61|). Several modifications 
were made to adapt the procedure to the requirements of this assay. 

Enzymatic hydrolysis 

A two ml. sample of blood was measured into a 50 ml. Erlenmeyer 
flask, and to it was added eight ml. of a 0.25 M sodium acetate solution 
(at pH U.5) and. ten ml. of distilled water. The mixture was then auto¬ 
claved for 15 minutes at 121° G. After the mixture had reached room 
temperature, an amount of mylase P equivalent to l/lO of the estimated dry 
weight of the sample was added to the flask, and the mixture, after layering 
with toluene, was incubated at 50° C for 2h hours. At the end of the 
incubation period, the mixture was filtered through a fluted Whatman No. 

12 filter paper, several filterings being used when necessary, until a 
clear filtrate was obtained. Following neutralization a five ml. aliquot was 
taken and extracted in a 125 ml. separatory funnel with two - ten ml. por¬ 
tions of ether, after which it was diluted to a convenient concentration

for assay. 

The ether extraction, it was found, eliminated the "drifting” 
which was observed to give considerable trouble when ether extraction was 
not carried out. It should also be noted that in all cases where milk 
samples were being prepared, a ten ml. aliquot was taken for ether ex¬ 
traction and subsequent dilution. In the latter case 20 ml. portions of 
ether were used in the extractions. 

Water hydrolysis 

As described under enzyme hydrolysis, a two ml, sample of blood 
was measured into a ?0 ml. Erlenmeyer flask, and to it was added eight 
ml. of a 0.25 M sodium acetate solution (at pH U*5) and ten ml. of dis¬ 
tilled water. The mixture was then autoclaved for 1 5 minutes at 121° G. 
After it had reached room temperature, the mixture was filtered through a 
fluted Whatman no. 12 filter paper, repeatedly Yfhen necessary, until a 
clear filtrate was obtained. Following neutralization, a five ml. ali- 
qjiot was extracted in a 125 ml. separatory funnel with two - ten ml. 
portions^ether, after which it was diluted to convenient concentration for 
assay. 


Details on the Method of Pantothenic Acid Assay 

The medium used, and the assay technique followed were similar 
to that employed by Riesen et al. (65). 

Preparation of Inoculum 

The organism L. a rabinosus 17-5 was used throughout, and was 
maintained by transferring every two weeks to fresh stabs, incubating for 
2It hours and then storing in the refrigerator.

To prepare inoculum the bacteria were transferred from stab to 
broth culture and incubated for 2l|. hours at 37° C. The liquid cult-iares 
were then centrifuged, and the supernatant liquid decanted. The bacteria 
were washed and recentrifuged with three - five ml. portions of sterile 
physiological saline before being resuspended in a 20 ml. portion of 
the saline. A further dilution of the suspension was made before inoc¬ 
ulation, which was carried out using a small hypodermic syringe, in 
order that blanks be kept at a minimum. Aseptic technique was used 
throughout. 

The broth cultures and stabs contained the ingredients in the 
amounts given in Table 1.

(1) The amino acids were included at the maximum levels 
recommended by the Wisconsin Board. 

(2) Xanthine was included in the medium* 

(3) Pyridoxamine was used exclusively in place of pyridoxine, 
as it has been reported by Snell and Rannefield (71) that 
it is doubtful if lactic acid bacteria can utilize un¬ 
changed pyridoxine. 

(H) Choline and inositol were omitted. 


The medium differed from that used by Riesen et al * (65) in 


that proline was included in the medium.

Preparation of Standards 

A stock solution of calcium pantothenate containing 100 V per 
ml. was made up in 0.05> M phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 to 7*0# The buffer 
solution consisted of 6.8 gm. KP^PO^ and 7*1 gm. NagHPO^, dissolved in 
distilled water and made up to 1000 ml. This solution was diluted as 
required to give an assay range of from 0 to U0m*. 

Assays were conducted on a semimicro scale in which the final 
volume was two ml. ( 67 ). later and medium were added with a Cannon auto¬ 
matic dispensor (11) to 20 x lf>0 mm. bacteriological test tubes in racks 
provided with metal covers. The samples and standards were pipetted in 
by hand using a one ml. graduated pipette. Levels of 0, 0.2 5 0.i}._, O.o, 
0.8 and 1.0 ml. were assayed in each case. Water was then added to make 
up to one ml. and one ml. of basal medium was added to make the final 
volume of two ml. The tubes were then autoclaved for 12 minutes at 15
