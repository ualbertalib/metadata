GENERAL 


While dairy science literature is by no means devoid of reports 
of studies of specific defects caused by certain microorganisms capable 
of growth at low temperatures, there are few reports of the occurrence 
and distribution in milk and cream of psychrophilic bacteria in general. 
Such bacteria might be expscted to be favored in a northern climate. In 
any case the present universal practice of long farm storage of churning 
creams before delivery to the creameries, and the rapidly Increasing 
practice of holding pasteurized milk for long periods before consumption 
bring into bold relief the importance of such investigations. 

The present study is an attempt to measure the psychrophiles 
in Edmonton milks and creams, particularly with respect to numbers, mode 
of entrance into the product, relation to pasteurization and flavor defects, 
and some of the characteristics of the organisms.

HISTORICAL 

Ravenal et al (13), found that a temperature of 40°F will 
generally inhibit all lactic acid producing organisms but not putrefac¬ 
tives and pointed out that even normal-tasting milk may contain by-products 
of bacterial decomposition of proteins which are harmful to man. 

Pennington et al (12), reported Micrococcus arranticus and 
Micrococcus avails to be the predominating flora of milk and cream held at 
0°C for long periods. They state that some of the mesophiles will ultimate¬ 
ly grow at this temperature after an initial, quiescent stage. 

3y their action on litmus milk the psychrophiles were grouped by 
Ayers and Johnson (4) into the four classes, acid-coagulating, acid non¬ 
coagulating, neutral and alkali-peptonizing. 

Micrococcus tyrogena and Bacillus prodig!osis predominated in the 
milk held at 13°C to 15°C by Reed and Reynolds (14) who reported growth 
down to —1°C and a flavoring of peptonizing bacteria at low temperatures. 

Stale, unclean and bitter flavors, but not high acidity, were 
observed by Martin, et al (11), on prolonged holding of milk and cream, 
irrespective of quality, at temperatures below 60°F« 

Jezinski and Macy (10) found 20°C to be the optimum temperature 
for psychrophiles. Of 41 isolations (both caseolytic and lipolytic) from 
water and butter, 28 isolates were Pseudomonas, 5 FIavobacterium, 6 Alkali- 
genes, 1 Achromobacter, while one was yeast. 

On the other hand, 3°G to 5°C in 21 days was cited as the optimum 
temperature for psychrophile counts in the work of Thomas and Chandra (16). 

Of their isolates, 98% were gram negative rods and 2%> were yellow micrococci. 
These organisms were found in both raw and pasteurized milk, but none sur-

vived laboratory pasteurization. 

Burgwald and Josephson (6) concluded that the initial mesophilic 
and psychrophilic counts of the raw milk are not good criteria of the keep¬ 
ing qualities of the pasteurized product, the primary cause of the deterior¬ 
ation of which is psychrophiles. 

Pseudomonas fragi was usually found , by Hus song et al (9), to 
be present in milk and cream. They state that at low temperature this 
species may outgrow others and produce serious defects in various dairy 
products. Incubation at 37°G failed to detect the organism, but Incubation 
of the sample at low temperatures prior to plating, and incubation of the 
plates at temperatures considerably lower than 37°C usually revealed the 
presence of the organism in varying numbers. 

A gram negative rod capable of hydrolizing fat at low temperatures 
was isolated by Anderson and ^ardenberg (3)« It was responsible for the 
development of a bitter defect in cream, producing an irritating ”sore 
throat a after effect. Similar organisms were also Isolated from deep well 
water. 

Anderson (2) proposed the name Bacterium iipidis for the above- 
mentioned organism. He further stated that the hydrolysis of fat and 
protein in cream stored at low temperatures for any length of time was 
mainly responsible for the defects occurring in this type of storage. 

A variation of 5°F in storage temperature was found by Thornton 
et al (17) to make a marked difference in the keeping qualities of creams 
stored in the range of 40°F to 50°F.

METHOD

METHOD 

A, Cause and Prevalence of a Specific Flavor Defect . 

Identification of the cultures originally isolated by Thornton 
et al (17) was carried out on a morphological and biochemical basis follow¬ 
ing the procedures given in the Manual of Methods for the Pure Culture Study 
of Bacteria (15)* The detection of flagella was done following the technique 
of Gray ( 3), Fluorescence was determined using the asparagin medium of 
Georgia and Poe (7), 

The cultures were isolated from samples of cream which had been stored 
for some time at 4*5°C and had developed a characteristic n alkaloidal t> bitter¬ 
ness. 

During the period of July 1st to September 1st, 1948, 21 samples of 
cream and 10 samples of milk were collected from a producing farm and a milk 
plant. The samples were stored at 4*5°G for a period of 15 days. At the end 
of the storage period, the samples were tasted to check for the prevalence 
of the ^alkaloidal 11 bitterness defect. Plate counts were made at the beginn¬ 
ing of the storage period to gain some idea of the initial quality of the 
samples. 

B. Psychrophilic Bacteria Present in Milk and Cream . 

Samples of milk and cream were collected from a local milk plant 
between January 31st and September 31st, 1949. The 10 milks obtained prior 
to April 4th are considered to be representative of winter milks, while the 
23 milks and 28 creams analyzed after May 1st are called summer samples. 

The creams were of two classes, ordinary sweet cream and cream, largely of 
high bacterial content, produced for a different purpose. 

Collection into sterile containers was accomplished as carefully 
as possible from storage tanks representing from a few, to many, shippers.

The samples were immediately removed to storage at 4.5°C until plating 
which was not over 1.5 hours later. 

Plating was done in duplicate or triplicate according to Standard 
Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products (1), except for incubation 
which was at 35.5°C for 2 days and 10.5°C and 4*5°C for 7 days. 

Immediately follo\vring the counting of the 10.5°C and 4«5°C plates, 
colonies were fished onto TGEM agar slopes. The number of isolations 
varied from a few, apparently typical colonies, to an entire plate, and 
averaged approximately 12 colonies per sample. 

Gram stains were made from the agar slope cultures after an incubation 
of 24 to 36 hours at 12°G. Inoculation was then made Into tubes of 4 
differential media which after 7 days at 12°G were observed for reaction 
in litmus milk, fluorescence in asparagin broth under ultra-violet light, 
gelatin liquefaction and flavor production in skim milk. 

The numbers and kinds of milks and creams studied are set forth in

EXPERIMENTAL 

A. Prevalence of the ll Alkaloidal Bitterness" Defect , 

The 11 samples of cream obtained in the summer of 1948 from a 
farm producing a good grade of cream had plate counts running from a low 
of 390 to a high of 10,000 per ml. and so were classed as excellent creams. 
Five of these samples were classed as bitter after storage for 15 days at 
4.5°C. The remaining samples all showed flavor defects of other types. 

Some of these samples exhibited considerable proteolysis and it is suspec¬ 
ted that the proteolytic flavors may in a few cases have masked the sought- 
for alkaloidal bitterness. 

Of the 10 creams obtained from a local milk plant, 7 were of high 
bacterial content. While developing other defects, in many cases going 
sour, none of them developed the sought-for bitter defect. The remaining 
3 samples of this lot were creams with a fairly low bacterial content. Two 
of them developed the bitter defect, while the third developed a strong 
fruity flavor. 

The 10 milks, having a plate count ranging from 10,000 to over 
200,000, included 4 samples which exhibited the sought-for bitter defect, 
while the remaining 6 samples developed other off flavors. 

In all cases, the bitter defect seemed to develop more readily 
in the samples with the lower initial plate counts. This suggests that the 
casual organism may be present quite extensively, but will only produce the 
characteristic defect when there are few enough other bacteria present that 
it is able to outgrow them. This was actually the case with the defect pro¬ 
duced by Pseudomonas fragi as reported by Hussong et al (9)* 

B. Identification of Isolated Cultures 

Twelve cultures were isolated by Thornton et al (17) from

samples of cream exhibiting the alkaloidal bitterness defect* They were 
given the following designations:- A 1, 2 and 3; B 1, 2 and 3; L 1, 2, 

3 and 4; 0 and P. 

On further study it was found that only the 6 cultures of groups 
A and B would reproduce the characteristic defect when inoculated into milk. 
These cultures agreed closely with the description of Pseudomonas flucrescans 
as given by Bergey 1 s Manual (5) except in the following characteristics:- 

Glucose not fermented. 

Alkaline in litmus milk followed by rapid proteolysis. 

No noticeable pigmentation of pellicle on broth. 

Growth of all cultures of Group B on solid media was viscous and 
stringy. 

Growth on potato of the cultures of Group B was whitish and almost 
filiform. 

Culture B3 produces stratiform liquefaction of gelatin. 

Additional biochemical characteristics for these two groups were 
identical and were as follows:- 

Asparagin broth: Fluorescent under ultra-violet light with the produc¬ 
tion of a slight yellow-green pigment. 

Acid but no gas in 1% arabinose and xylose broths. 

Lactose, sucrose, inulin and rhamnose not fermented. 

H 2 S: Not produced. 

MR and VP tests: Both negative. 

Cellulose: Not decomposed. 

Starch: Not hydrolized. 

Casein: Hydrolized. 

Citrate Carbon: Utilized.

Growth is inhibited by crystal violet in a concentration of 1 part per 

100,000, and by 0.5% lithium chloride. 

Skim milk: No visible change. A musty or cellary taste is produced. 

C. Plate Count 

Counts at 35.5°C . 

There was a definite tendency for the standard plate counts of the 
milks to increase during the hot weather of summer (Tables II and III). Pre¬ 
vious investigations by the Department of Dairying at the University of Alberta 
have shown that such high counts in Edmonton market milks are caused primarily 
not by growth of bacteria in the milk, but by growth of bacteria in the milk 
utensils. Therefore, the majority of these bacteria were introduced into the 
milk by non-sterile utensils. 

Counts at 10.5°G. 

With few, if any, exceptions, the count at 10.5°C of the summer 
milks and creams (Tables III, IV and V) equalled the 35.5°G counts, within 
the probable experimental error of counting bacteria in dairy products by the 

plate method. This confirms earlier work by Thornton et al (17) that 50°F is 

# 

not a satisfactory farm storage temperature for churning creams which &xe not 
delivered frequently. 

Counts at 4»5°G. 

The 4.5°C counts (Tables II to IV) paralleled the standard plate 
counts remarkably closely (Figures 1 to 4)• Thus, since the summer standard 
milk counts were higher than those of the winter milk, so also the 4*5°C 
counts increased in the summer milks. It is doubtful if the conclusion is 
justified that there was any difference in the proportion of psychrophiles 
to total bacteria in the different products or at different seasons.

There can be no doubt that psychrophiles constitute a very signifi¬ 
cant proportion of the total bacterial content of Edmonton milks and creams 
and gain entrance into these products largely from non-sterile utensils. 

It is probable that the very high counts in some of the special 
summer creams are related to bacterial growth in the product since delivery 
of these creams was not daily. 

Accuracy of the Plate Count. 

There is an extensive literature on the accuracy of standard plate 
counts of milk. From this literature it is at once apparent that such 
counts are subject to great variability and may frequently be misleading. 

No studies have been reported on the variability or accuracy of plate 
counts of the psychrophiles in milk. Wolochov et at (18) using 2 media 
found 10~15°C plate counts of water to be disturbingly variable and inaccur¬ 
ate and directed. attention 16 to the inadequacy of either medium as a single 
general measure of total numbers 11 . 

There seems to be no reason for regarding the psychrophilic counts 
of milk more accurate than is the case for water. The exceedingly variable 
proportion that the 4*5°C counts are of the 35.5°C counts lends support to 
this view. 

Therefore, beyond the fact that significant numbers of bacteria 
capable of growing at 4* 5°C occurred in these milks and creams, further 
interpretations become very difficult. 

Pasteurization » 

It is not unknown for pasteurized milks to have not only inordinate¬ 
ly high standard plate counts, but also high psychrophilic counts, sometimes 
equalling and even surpassing the standard counts. The meager literature on 
the subject leads to the surmise that these psychrophiles did not survive the 


heat treatment

This view is supported by the data in Table VI in which it is shown that 
the psychrophiles did not survive the commercial pasteurization of 4 samples 
of milk and 2 samples of specialties. The homogenized 10 % milk was pre-pas¬ 
teurization standardized with cream known to be rather high in psychrophilic 
content. Moreover, spore formation was not noted at any time during this 
entire study of psychrophiles. Therefore, the conclusion is justified that 
psychrophiles in significantly large numbers in freshly pasteurized milk or 
cream have been placed there by non-sterile plant equipment subsequent to 


the heat treatment,

D. Cultural Characteristics of Plate Count Isolates . 

Morphology ; There were 722 isolations made from all samples collected 
during the period of January 31st to September 31st, 1949. Of these, 45? 
were rods and 55? were coccus forms. Approximately 60? of the winter iso¬ 
lates and 40? of the summer isolates were rod forms with coccus forms showing 
the reverse relationship (Table VII). However, this slight seasonal variation 
in form may well represent an artifact. 

Gram Reaction : The gram reaction of the 722 isolates (Table VII) reveals 

that 65? of the cultures were gram negative. The cultures from winter samples 
included 72? gram negative bacteria while 63? of the summer cultures showed 
this reaction. Gram negative rods and cocci occurred with about equal fre¬ 
quency, and there is probably no significant difference between the gram 
positive rods and cocci. However, it is to be noted that the gram negative 
rods and cocci consistently predominate over the gram positive ones. 
Biochemical. Reactions s Since these bacteria were isolated from milk and 
cream, and since their growth in, and action on, these products are important, 
initial classification was done utilizing their reactions in litmus milk. 

The results are reported in Tables VIII, IX and X, 

Of the isolations made at 4«5°C, 97? of the winter and 82? of the 
summer isolates fall into the 4 litmus mI3.k classes, acid, acid proteolytic, 
unchanged and alkali proteolytic. A further breakdown reveals that of the 
winter isolates 15? were acid, 17? were acid proteolytic, 61? were unchanged 
and 4? were alkali proteolytic, while the summer milk isolates yielded 6? 
acid, 2? acid proteolytic, 36? unchanged and 37? alkali proteolytic. The 
summer cream isolates yielded 17? acid, 9? acid proteolytic, 34? unchanged 
and 22? alkali proteolytic. There is an increase in the alkali proteolytic 
bacteria in the summer samples, coupled with a decrease in the acid proteo-

lytic and unchanged groups. 

The isolations at 10*5°C cover a wider range of litmus milk reactions. 
Here there does not appear to be a concentration of cultures in any particular 
class of reactions in litmus milk. This would seem to indicate the inclusion 
of a greater variety of species with a 6°C increase in incubation temperature. 
This is borne out on comparison of the plate count, the counts at 10.5°C 
being much greater than the count at 4«5°C. As with the 4.5°C isolates, 
there appears to be no significant difference (in summer samples) in the types 
of bacteria isolated from milk, from those isolated from cream* This might 
be expected since the production of these 2 products is carried out under 
similar conditions, with the exception that more growth would be possible 
in the creams before delivery, since delivery of that product is usually not 
carried out daily. 

Gelatin liquefaction, fluorescence and flavor production in skim 
milk were also determined for the 722 isolates. The results are given in 
Table XI. While further classification by using these reactions is probably 
too severe, giving rise to apparently a very large number of species, at the 
same time an indication can be obtained of the types of reactions produced 
by bacteria at low temperatures. It is interesting to note that all the 
cultures produced off flavors of some description and in varying degrees of 
severity. From the flavor standpoint alone this supports the fact that In 
producing a good quality of milk or cream, bacterial growth of any type is 
undesirable and should be kept to a minimum. 

Protein liquefaction, as indicated by gelatin stab cultures, was 
produced by 35 %> of the cultures. Of the gram negative rods, 61 % were gelatin 

liquefiers while 15 % of the gram negative cocci, 31 %> of the gram positive 

. 

rods, and 28 % of the gram positive cocci were capable of gelatin liquefaction. 
This indicates that the proteolytic bacteria are fairly prevalent in milks and

On the basis of the information in Table XI, as well as that 
supplied by a few additional tests where necessary, the following classes 
of bacteria which are usually present to some extent in milk have been 
recognized:- 

1. Coliforms. These were identified as gram negative rods giving a positive 

presumptive test for coliforms as well as the characteristic reactions 
in the , *Imvic n tests and on eosin methylene blue agar.. Eight cultures 
gave coliform reactions. This constitutes 1% of all the isolates and 
4$ of the gram negative rods. Of the 8 coliform cultures, 2 belong to 
the genus Eschrichia and 6 were of the genus Aerobacter . Isolates were 
distributed throughout the products studies and did not seem to be 
affected seasonally. 

2. Pseudomonads. 121 gram negative rods have been classed as belonging to 

the genus Pseudomonas . They comprise 16*7% of all isolates and 54$ of 
the gram negative rods. They composed 27 % of the winter isolates and 51$ 
of the summer ones. 

3. One culture was identified as Alcaligenes viscosus . It produced the typic¬ 

al ropy condition characteristic of this organism in milk and was Isolat¬ 
ed at 10,5°C from a sample of simmer milk. 

4*'Six yellow chromogenic rods were isolated and have been classed as belonging 
to the genus Flavobacterium . 

5. Twenty gram positive cocci have been placed in the Streptococcus lactis 

group. Of these, 17 produced the typical 3. lactis reaction in litmus 

milk while 3 failed to coagulate the medium in 7 days. Of the 20 cultures, 

1 was isolated from the winter Samples, 3 were from summer isolates at 

j 

4«5°C and 16 were from summer isolates at 10.5°C. The comparatively few 
isolates, as well as the significant increase with the higher temperature, 

















- 30 - 


of this fairly common organism illustrate its reluctance to grow in the 
lower psychrophilic range. 

6. Thirty-two of the gram positive rods have been classed as Lactobacilli . 

All except one of these were isolated from summer samples at 10.5°C. 

Due to the heterogeneity of the 2 families MICROCOCCACEAE and 
LACTOBACTERIACEAE which undoubtedly make up the majority of the remainder of 
the isolates, further differentiation of them has not been attempted* The 
information presented is not sufficient for this, and since there are no 
simple tests which will readily subdivide these 2 classes of organisms, it is 
felt that further classification would entail work beyohd the scope of this 
problem.

DISCUSSION 




- 31 - 


DISCUSSION 

Although the term ’’psychrophile” includes all those bacteria capable 
of growth at temperatures from 0°C to 20°C, the incubation temperatures used 
in this study never exceeded 12*5°C, with actual isolation temperatures never 
exceeding 10*5°C. It was felt that this would give a truer picture of the 
growth of psychrophiles in milk and cream, since these products are usually 
handled at temperatures around 10°C* 

The picking of colonies from plates poured from unincubated samples 
has eliminated to a great extent the inclusion of mesophiles* The fact that 
some of the mesophiles are capable of growth in the psychrophilic range is 
recognized, but it is felt that if these bacteria are able to grow in this 
temperature range, their inclusion by the methods employed is justified, as 
then their growth in dairy products would be of significance* While consider¬ 
able numbers of mesophiles may adapt themselves to growth at psychrophilic 
temperatures after long periods of storage, to date at least, milk and cream 
are not held for sufficient lengths of time to permit their growth to be of 
significance in spoilage of dairy products held at low temperatures* There¬ 
fore, to prevent isolation of mesophiles which might show this adaption, the 
plates were not incubated any longer than 7 days* 

Tryptone glucose meat extract agar plus 1 % skim milk was used in an 
attempt to favor the growth of bacteria normally present and growing in milk, 
by actually having milk constituents present in the medium* 

However, the author realizes the inadequacy of using any one medium 
or specific temperature as a true criterion of the bacteria actually present 
in milk or cream. Further studies on the suitability of any one particular 
medium, or incubation temperature for the isolation of psychrophilic bacteria 
from milk and cream would greatly aid in the study of these bacteria, but it

believed that sufficient data have been presented to give an indication of 
the numbers, types of spoilage and extent of occurrence of some of the more 
common bacteria concerned in the growth of psychrophiles, in milks and creams

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

A survey has been made of the psychrophilic bacteria occurring in 
the milks and creams of the Edmonton area, particularly with reference to 
number, mode of entrance into the products, flavor defects produced and the 
occurrence of some of the more common types of bacteria. The following con3 
elusions appear justified:- 

1. An improvement in milk quality increases the significance of the 
psychrophilic bacteria, giving rise to niff flavors which have been generally 
uncommon to date, 

2. Of 12 isolates from creams developing a peculiar ’’alkaloida!* 1 bitter¬ 
ness on storage, 6 were found to be closely related variants of Pseudomonas 
fluorescens, 3 were other members of the genus Fseudomonas, and 3 were mem¬ 
bers of the genus Bacterium. 

3. Bacteria capable of growth at 1Q„5°G and 4»5°G are introduced into 
milk during farm production by non-sterile utensils. 

4. In general and with few, if any, exceptions, the plate counts of 
bacteria capable of growth at 10.5°C equalled the plate counts of bacteria 
capable of growth at 35.5°C. 

5. Plate counts at 4.5°G varied from 0% to over 100 % of the 35*5°C 
counts and were in most cases present in significant numbers* Both 35.5°C 
and 4«5°C counts tended to be higher in summer milk than in winter milk, 

6. The 4»5°C count curves paralleled the 35*5°C counts remarkably close¬ 
ly in all classes of product, 

7. The psychrophilic bacteria were not found to survive commercial pas¬ 
teurization, Therefore, when found in significant numbers in pasteurized 
milk, the source is likely to be non-sterile plant equipment \-/ith which the 
milk comes into contact after pasteurization.

8. Of 722 low temperature cultures, rods and coccus forms occurred with 
approximately equal frequency. Gram negativeness predominated over gram 
positiveness. 

9. An increase of 6°C from 4.5°C to 10.5°C not only increased the plate 
count considerably, but also increased the variety of bacteria as evidenced 
by increased variety of reactions produced in different media by bacteria 
isolated at the higher temperature. 

10. All the bacteria isolated at 4.5°C to 10.5°C caused undesirable off 
flavors in milk stored for 7 days at low temperatures. In most cases the 
flavor defects were in evidence even before 7 days. 

11. Thirty-five per cent of all isolates were capable of gelatin lique¬ 
faction. These may all cause proteolytic defects in milk. 

12. Of 722 isolations made from milk and cream, the following readily 
identifiable genera ^ere noted:- 

8 coliforms, 6 being Aerobacter and 2 Sschrichla 
121 were Pseudomonas 
1 was Alcaligeneg 
6 were Flavobacterium 

20 were Streptococcus lactls , or closely related variants thereof, 

32 were Lactobacillus 

13. No significant difference appeared between the cultures isolated from 


milk and those isolated from cream.
