SYNOPSIS 


The purposes of this investigation were to evaluate 
the teaching of drama in Alberta schools and to suggest 
feasible recommendations to those in authority. The 
criteria for evaluation were the objectives of the courses 
in drama as outlined in the Programme of Studies . 

The information was gathered by questionnaire. There 
were one hundred and one replies from teachers of drama and 
forty-three from superintendents. The data were tabulated 
wherever possible. 

There was a consistency of opinion expressed. Lack 
of equipment, inadequate reference materials, heavy teaching¬ 
loads, and lack of funds were reported from the majority of 
schools. It appears that there is a scarcity of teachers 
qualified in terms of current standards to teach drama in 
the schools. No connection between this scarcity and the 
difficulties of teaching the course was established. 

The teachers of drama, either because of training or 
because of the conditions found in their schools, stressed 
different objectives. On the whole, both teachers of drama 
and superintendents were convinced of the value of the 
course but considered the work in drama would improve as 
the facilites for teaching the course were Improved.

CHAPTER I 


HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE PROBLEM 

Until very recent years the only expression of drama 
in Canada was to be found in the spontaneous activities 
that grow naturally from the dramatic instincts of all. 
Canada is a young country whose youth has been renewed from 
decade to decade into the present century by new settlers 
who were too busy developing the country to spend much time 
on the cultural arts. Thar© was no professional theatre. 
Travelling companies of English and American actors brought 
plays to the principal cities of Canada. During the later 
decades of the nineteenth and the first decade of the 
twentieth centuries American theatrical touring companies 
included Canada as part of their itinerary. These com¬ 
panies collapsed about 1910 because of the "star 11 system 
which had brought high salaries to the star with correspond™ 
ingly low salaries to the remainder of the cast. There was 
an increase in the price of admissions to cover rising 
expenses which in turn caused a decrease in attendance. A 
moving-picture company gained control of nearly all the 
important theatres in Canada and refused to leas© them to 
stage producers. Theatrical stock companies were formed 
but financial difficulties were found insuperable. This 
practically brought to an end any form of the professional 


drama

At the same time there was a steadily growing interest 
in amateur productions which revolved about literary soci¬ 
eties, churches and schools. In 1906, the Governor-General 
of Canada, Earl Grey, conceived the idea of an annual music 
and drama festival. This idea was carried out and was 
successful until 1911 when the cost of operation became too 
high. In 1918 Canadian soldiers returned from Europe 
enthusiastic about the stage productions they had seen there. 
Their interest acted as a stimulus which resulted in a 
marked increase in amateur drama societies. 

The Montreal Repertory Theatre, the Ottawa Drama 
League, and the Players Club of the University of Toronto 
are pioneers in the amateur drama movement in Canada. 

In 1919, stimulated by the interest of the Honorable 
Vincent Massey, the Hart House Theatre was established as 
an experimental art theatre. The Players Club was invited 
to manage the theatre but because of financial and technical 
difficulties the arrangement was later found unsatisfactory. 
In 1921 the Hart House Theatre came under the management of 
a separate body called the Syndics of Hart House who are 
responsible to the Governors of the University of Toronto. 

All the actors taking part in Hart House Theatre 
productions are amateurs. The theatre is usually open to 
the public although certain productions may be given 
exclusively to interested groups. The policy of the theatre

is to use plays written by Canadian authors and students. 

A two-volume edition of Canadian Plays produced by the Hart 
House Theatre has been edited by Vincent Massey and publish¬ 
ed by the Macmillan Company. The players from this theatre 
have toured Ontario, and one outstanding contribution they 
have made is the presentation of Shakespearean plays to the 
schools. "The Theatre endeavors in every possible way to 
encourage the development of the Canadian Drama." ^ 

To the Players Club of the University of British 
Columbia goes the honor for pioneering in drama in the West. 

The Earl of Bessborough was greatly interested in the 
drama and did much to revive interest in the stage. H® 
called a meeting of representatives from each province and 
with their cooperation organized the Dominion Drama Festival. 
Regional competitions were held in the spring of 1933 and 
the winners presented their productions in Ottawa in May. 

The best production received the Bessborough Trophy but 
additional awards were mad© to the best English and French 
plays. Later the Sir Barry Jackson Trophy was awarded to 
the best Canadian play with a cash prize to the author. 

These festivals have done much to broaden and inspire 
popular interest in the drama. The truth of this was quite 
apparent when the Dominion Drama Festival was held for the 
first time in Calgary in May 1950. Canadian society at

last was supporting the drama in ever increasing numbers. 

Playwrights inspired by the growing popularity of 
the drama festivals were encouraged to portray the Canadian 
scene. To an American, Merrill Denison, goes the honor of 
laying the foundation for a pur© Canadian drama. His plays. 
Brothers in Arms and Marsh Hay , "have embedded inescapable 

p 

Canadianism in reputable dramatic expression. Mr. Denison 
was born in Detroit and educated in Toronto. H© was 
appointed Art Director of Hart House Theatre in 1921. In 
1932 he left Canada to join the Columbia and National Broad- 
casting System as specialist in radio drama. 

Although Merrill Denison is lost to Canada, Robertson 
Davies is a man who in his work identifies himself closely 
with his country. Within the last ten years his reputation 
as a leading Canadian author and playwright has spread 
beyond his own country. Educated in Ontario and at Oxford, 
he was apprenticed with the Old Vic in London as actor and 
writer. His three-act play. Fortune , My Foe , published in 
1949, won the award for th© best Canadian play in the Drama 
Festival of that year. This play has been performed by two 
professional companies and adapted for radio by the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation. The same year he published Eros 
At Breakfast and Other Plays . Eros At Breakfast was the 
first Canadian entry in the Edinburgh Festival last summer.

It received favorable notice. The Montreal Repertory Theatre 
produced three of the Other Plays on an All Robertson Davies 
Night. His latest play. At My Heart»s Core , is considered by 
drama critics to be better even than Fortune , My Foe, s 

In Alberta the interest In drama was stimulated by the 
Little Theatre groups, quite active since 1927. Noted early 
producers in Alberta were Eva Howard, of Victoria High School, 
Edmonton; E. C. Davis, formerly of Edmonton and now of Cleve¬ 
land, Ohio; Betty Mitchell, of Western Canada High School, 
Calgary; Theodore Cohen, now of New York; and perhaps the 
best known of them all, Elizabeth Sterling Haynes, founder 
of the rural community drama movement, 

A graduate of the University of Toronto, Elizabeth 
Sterling Haynes had taken an active part in Hart House pro¬ 
ductions, On her arrival in the West she joined the 
Edmonton Little Theatre and was a director of the University 
of Alberta’s Dramatic Club, She was a member of the 
executive when the Alberta Dramatic League was formed In 
1930, When in 1932 the University Extension Department 
decided to extend its work to the fin© arts, Mrs, Haynes 
was the logical choice of the Department as Director of 
Dramatics, Her aim was to encourage and assist drama groups 
in rural areas. Tireless in her endeavors, she travelled 
the length and breadth of the province conducting drama

schools, adjudicating festivals, and offering encouragement 
and advice to all. The School of the Theatre was begun in 
Banff. It was expected that forty would enrol but two hun¬ 
dred arrived. The continued success of the school is almost 
certainly due in part to its sound initial organization. 

Dr. Koch, head of the Department of Dramatic Art at the 
University of North Carolina, lecturing In Banff, warmly 
praised Mrs. Haynes and expressed his delight that such a 
thriving Little Theatre movement existed in Alberta. ^ 
Although Mrs. Haynes is no longer drama director of the 
University Extension Department her services are much in 
demand as an adjudicator. On the University campus is an 
army hut now used as a Little Theatre. Here during July and 
August Mrs, Haynes will usually be found, surrounded by a 
group of eager students. The enthusiasm of these students 
for their work under the guidance of Mrs, Haynes Is a tri¬ 
bute to this indefatigable pioneer. 

Alberta f s best known playwrights are Elsie Park Gowan 
and Gwen Pharis HIngwood. Mrs. Gowan has written several 
one-act plays and one full length comedy. She has been 
honored with the Canadian Drama Award which is given to one 
citizen in each province each year for services to the 
Canadian Theatre. She has don© some of her best work as a 
writer of historical script and her productions have been

heard not only on provincial airways but on the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation. 

Uwen Pharis (Hingwood) is considered on© of Canada’s 
promising dramatists. A graduate of the University of 
Alberta, she accepted a Rockefeller fellowship in 1958 
tenable in the Department of Dramatic Art of the University 
of North Carolina. Her first play. Still Stands the House , 
is considered her best. In Alberta her best-known play is 
The Courting of Mari© Jenvrin . 

It is reasonable to suppose that the growing interest 
in drama in Alberta’s urban centres and rural areas was 
responsible, at least in part, for the introduction in 1956 
of drama courses into the provincial school curricula. 

This does not mean that there had been no form of 
drama in the schools previously. The Christmas concert and 
the spring concert were almost traditional, especially in 
the rural areas. The one-act play was usually on© of the 
main features of an evening’s entertainment. These concerts 
were produced by enthusiastic students seeking no credits, 
and by teachers without formal training but with a keen 
interest in community life. In 1956 drama was first offered 
in the schools for credit, and teachers giving instruction 
were required to be trained. 

Required training could be got at the summer sessions 
of the Department of Education in either Calgary or Edmon-

ton. Teachers having successfully completed four courses 
were granted a junior certificate. An additional four 
courses entitled the teacher to a senior certificate. Each 
course was a daily forty-minute period five days a week for 
six weeks. The junior certificate entitled the teacher to 
give instruction in drama to students in Grades VII, VIII 
and IX, and in Grade X to offer the general elective. Drama 
1. To teach the general elective. Drama 2, the teacher 
required a senior certificate. The Banff School of Pine 
Arts also offered courses leading to these certificates. 

In 1946 the University of Alberta began giving credits in 
drama toward the junior and senior certificates both in the 
regular university session and at the summer session. 

Drama courses have thus been taught as exploratory 
or optional courses in junior and senior high schools of 
Alberta over the past fifteen years.

CHAPTER II 


THE PROBLEM 

The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the 
teaching of drama in Alberta schools today. The criteria of 
evaluation are the objectives outlined in the Programme of 
Studies , 

As stated in Chapter I, courses in drama were intro¬ 
duced, to the junior and senior high schools of Alberta in 
1956, Summer school classes in drama were crowded as 
teachers endeavored to meet the special certification re¬ 
quirements, Prom the high peak of the late thirties, 
registration in these courses has fallen off until courses 
occasionally have now to be cancelled because of insufficient 
registration. Does this mean that properly qualified teachers 
of drama are in short supply? If this is so, what is the 
reason? How has school drama fared in the fifteen year 
interval? 

To answer these questions the superintendents and 
teachers of drama were approached by questionnaire and in a 
few cases by personal interview. Is the course popular with 
the teachers? If not, why not? Are the teachers of drama 
carrying an unusually heavy teaching load? How many classes 
of drama are they teaching? How many students are in the 
drama class? How many plays are produced each year? How

many hours does the teacher spend in out-of-school 
rehearsals? 

Drama is called an optional or elective subject but 
the extent to which it is truly optional is questionable. 
Junior high school students must have a specified number of 
options and the number offered is frequently limited either 
by the qualifications of the staff or by the facilities 
available* What type of student is enrolled in the drama 
class? Why is the student taking the course? 

The problem of finance is one from which schools can 
never escape. Drama is not considered an expensive course 
but money is required for copies of plays, make-up, sets, 
costumes, reference books, and numerous other small but 
important items* Where does this money come from? How 
many school boards are willing to meet the expenses of the 
drama classes? How many drama classes ar© expected not 
only to finance themselves but to purchase athletic and 
other equipment for the school? The extent to which school 
boards are willing to pay is one way of measuring the 
interest of the public* 

Closely allied with the matter of finance is the 
question of facilities provided in the school* This must 
be treated apart from finance because in many cases money 
alone cannot solve the problem of an old school. It is 
important to know if teachers have stages upon which to

work. Can a teacher do justice to a course in drama without 
rehearsal space? Do schools have lighting equipment, sets, 
make-up kits, or must they constantly improvise? 

A survey of any course would not b© complete without 
a study of the teachers* techniques. The flexibility of the 
programme and the varied circtimstances under which teachers 
work make the study particularly interesting. Some teachers 
have a stag© constantly at their disposal; some never have 
access to one. Some classes number more than forty; others 
have only two or three students. All teachers are hoping 
to achieve the same objectives. To discover how teachers 
meet these varying problems and to discover what techniques 
they find most useful is the object of a major portion of 
the questionnaire. In addition, both teachers and super¬ 
intendents were invited to offer criticisms and suggestions.

the completed questionnaires. This represents 
a 60 per cent return. 

2. Eleven teachers returned the questionnaire 
with the information that they were not 
teachers of drama.

CHAPTER IV 


THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE TEACHERS OF DRAM 

In this chapter there will be presented the data 
obtained from the superintendents from the viewpoint of 
availability of properly qualified teachers of drama, and 
from the teachers of drama from the viewpoint of their own 
qualifications. 

- Of the superintendents reporting, 41.8 per cent 
found no difficulty in getting teachers of drama with a 
junior certificate; 34.9 per cent had difficulty in getting 
such teachers. The remaind©r--25.2 per cent--©Ither did 
not need teachers of drama because of small enrolments in 
the schools, or could not give an opinion as they left the 
choice of options to the teachers. On the other hand, 65.1 
per cent of the superintendents had difficulty In obtaining 
teachers with a senior certificate while 9.3 per cent had 
no difficulty and 25.6 p6r cent either did not need such 
teachers or were unable to give an opinion. 

Some interesting comments were offered; 

I have not been specially concerned about drama 
but find that few applicants have qualifications for 
teaching drama (or music) beyond the regular teacher¬ 
training course. 

My records show that teachers-in-training in 
recent years are not qualifying in drama. Of eighty- 
five teachers on the staff only eight have qualifica¬ 
tions and only one has taken dramatic courses 
recently.

Another superintendent made the following notation: 

Junior certificates nine out of ninety-eight. 

Senior certificates none out of ninety-eight. 

Since few teachers have the qualifications it 
is seldom taught. 

In the country schools very few teachers have 
drama qualifications. 

Success depends more upon personality and natural 
ability than upon certificates held. 

Teachers must have a keen interest rather than 
a certificate in this subject. 

A course in drama is not sufficient to teach 
drama properly. A teacher must have some natural 
aptitude and ability in drama. We lack such 
teachers. 

The comments of the superintendents with regard to 
personality and natural aptitude are well taken. At least 
in the early years of offering options in the junior high 
schools there was a scramble to obtain qualifications and 
it was often impossible to consider aptitude and the 
teacher's personal interests. This was particularly true 
in the smaller centres where on© teacher would need to be 
able to offer the required number of options demanded by the 
Department of Education. Today some of them would prefer 
not to teach the course but with a limited number of options 
stipulated they often have no choice. It would b© interest¬ 
ing to know how many teachers of drama have the particular 
aptitude without which no teaching of drama can be success¬

of Education summer schools and that comparatively few have 
been seeking certification sine© the courses were taken over 
by the University of Alberta. This may b© because teachers 
working towards the Bachelor of Education degree hesitate to 
take a course that entails both lectures and workshop for 
one credit.

additional work that would entitle them to the senior 
certificate. This certificate is needed to teach Drama 2 
in the high school, but this course is rarely taught except 
in the city schools. 


SUMMARY OP FINDINGS 

1. 34.9 per cent of the superintendents had difficulty in 
getting teachers with a junior certificate in drama. 

2. 65.1 per cent of the superintendents had difficulty in 
getting teachers with a senior certificate in drama. 

3. Some superintendents considered that a certificate to 
teach drama was not enough. Aptitude and ability on 
the part of the teachers are more important. 

4. Pew teachers require a senior certificate as Drama 2 
is seldom taught except in the city schools.

CHAPTER V 


THE TEACHING- LOAD IN DRAMA 

The survey showed that the size of the centre had 
considerable influence on the teaching load. The city 
schools of Calgary, Edmonton, Lethbridge, Medicine Hat and 
Red Deer have therefore been considered apart from the town, 
village and rural areas. Wetaskiwin did not offer drama. 
Drumheller did not supply any information. 

In the smaller centres the enrolment in thirty-four 
drama classes on the grades seven and eight level varied 
from two to thirty-nine. The median enrolment was fourteen. 
The grade nine picture was similar to that of grades seven 
and eight. The fifty-one classes reported numbers ranging 
from two to thirty-six with a median at eleven. The Drama 
1 classes in high schools had a tendency to be larger. The 
range of one to thirty-three was similar but the median for 
twenty-seven classes is seventeen. There were no classes 
in Drama 2 reported. 

These figures indicate that class enrolment is not a 
problem for most teachers in the smaller centres. Where 
the enrolment was very small, some combining of junior high 
school classes in drama was done. 

The teaching load in drama is, however, rarely con¬ 
fined to classroom work, and to complete the study teachers

spent in rehearsals.

In addition to the above* thirty-two schools produced 
a full-length play each year. 

Seventy-six per cent of the teachers reported they 
needed out-of-school time for rehearsals, although some said 
they were unable to get this time as their schools were served 
by buses and they were not able to keep students after school 
hours. Forty-eight teachers spent an average of thirty hours 
on this work but eight of these spent fifty hours or more on 
rehearsals after school hours. 

The majority of the teachers had a heavy schedule of 
school subjects covering three or four grades. The amount of 
time that would of necessity b© spent in preparing these 
subjects for class presentation plus the time spent for

rehearsals would indicate a heavy teacher-load. 

In the smaller centres forty-four of the teachers 
were in favor of a double period for drama but fourteen were 
opposed to this form of timetable schedule. Some teachers 
remarked that it was possible to change their timetables to 
get additional drama periods when needed in preparation for 
a public performance. 

Replies were received from twelve junior and three 
senior high schools in Edmonton. Four of the junior high 
schools said they did not offer courses in drama. Calgary 
has seven junior high schools and drama is offered in four 
of them. The three high schools in Calgary all offer drama, 
but in one high school the boys are not allowed to take the 
course. Lethbridge Collegiate returned a completed question¬ 
naire but there was no response from the junior high schools 
in that city. Two junior high schools reported from Medi¬ 
cine Hat, as did the Medicine Hat Composite High School. 

Red Deer reported they had not offered drama for several 
years, but that in the year 1950-51 the grad© nine classes 
had become part of the Red Deer Composite High School where 
drama is offered as an option. 

In the city schools the number of classes per 
teacher and the enrolment per class indicated that the city 
teachers were carrying a heavier load than their contem¬ 
poraries In the smaller centres. In grades seven and eight

the average number of classes taught was slightly over two. 
Class enrolment ranged from twenty students to forty-four 
students and the median was thirty-five. The teacher who 
had twenty students stated that she refused to handle any 
more. The next figure was twenty-nine, so only one teacher 
had classes small enough for effective teaching according 
to the standard in the Programme of Studies . Similar 
conditions existed in grade nine classes. The minimum 
enrolment of the sixteen classes reported was eighteen and 
the maximum was forty-four. Again the median was thirty- 
five . 

The figures for the high school enrolments were 
smaller than those for the junior high schools, but ©van 
so many teachers had more than the twenty students recom¬ 
mended by the Department of Education. In Drama 1 the 
minimum for twenty classes was fifteen, the maximum thirty- 
seven, and the median twenty-five. In Drama 2 the minimum 
for six classes was twelve, the maximum thirty-two, and the 
median twenty. 

The city schools, in proportion to the number of 
teachers involved, prepared more plays for audience- 
presentation than did the smaller centres. Six of the 
senior high schools and one junior high school produced a 
full-length play.

Very few teachers in city schools were able to do 
their rehearsal work in school hours• Twenty-on© of twenty- 
four reported they spent from ten to ©ighty-fiv© hours with 
drama after school. The median for such work was forty-five 
hours. Although two teachers said they spent over on© 
hundred hours at rehearsals, they pointed out that it was in 
connection with drama clubs in the school formed as an extra¬ 
curricular activity. 

In the cities eighteen teachers favored double 
scheduling of drama periods and four were opposed. The 
comments indicated that some teachers misconstrued the term 
“double period** to mean the present four credit course would 
be increased to an eight credit course. Actually what was 
meant was an arrangement of the timetable to provide two 
long periods for the course rather than the four short ones. 
The Edmonton teachers, who have used this scheme, find the

other schools would be advisable. 

The contrast between rural, village and small town

SUMMARY OP FINDING’S 

1* The drama teachers in the smaller centres have smaller 
numbers in their drama classes and fewer drama classes 
than do teachers in the city schools. 

2. The teaching load where drama is taught is heavy in both 
smaller centres and cities since the teachers in the 
smaller centres have a greater variety of subjects to 
prepare whereas the city teachers have usually more than 


one class of drama

3. Class enrolments are somewhat lighter in high school 
drama classes. 

4. More plays for audience presentation are prepared in 
schools in the city than in the smaller centres. 

5. Most teachers of drama spend time on rehearsals after 
school hours. 

6. The majority of teachers favored the idea of a double 
period for drama. Some teachers in the smaller centres 
where timetabling is more flexible did not consider 
that double periods were necessary.

CHAPTER VI 


STUDENT INTEREST IN DRAMA 

Since drama is considered an option in both junior 
and senior high schools, the survey would not be complete 
without some attempt to discover to what extent the 
student was interested in the course. The questionnaire 
endeavored to discover if students took the course in 
drama because: 

1. they were interested, 

2. it was considered an easy option, 

3. it was the only course they could fit into 
their timetables. 

The information requested in connection with student 
interest was too subjective to be conclusive because it was 
based on teachers* opinions. Prom one hundred and one 
questionnaires, thirty had to be discarded as the informa¬ 
tion asked was either incomplete or incorrectly compiled. 

In addition to the information given in Table V, 
one teacher reported interest of 90 per cent where the 
class was limited to twenty students. Eight teachers re¬ 
ported drama was a compulsory subject as it was the only 
option offered in their schools.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 

1. Approximately 63 per cent of the students enrolled in 
drama courses are interested. 

2. From 13 to 17 per cent took drama because it was an easy 
option. 

3. The percentage taking drama in cities and smaller centres 
due to its being compulsory or because of timetable clash 
varied from 18 to 23* 

4. It must be remembered that these data are based on teacher 
opinion and must therefore be regarded as subjective.

CHAPTER VII 


FINANCING DRAMA IN THE SCHOOLS 

The extent to which school boards are willing to pay 
is one way of measuring public opinion of the value of a 
course. Such a criterion would not set a high value on- 
drama in the schools. The questionnaire showed that drama 
is financed almost entirely by the drama classes through 
their own productions with little or no help from the school 
boards. 


TABLE VI 


TEACHERS f REPORTS ON THE FINANCING OF DRAM 
IN EIGHTY SCHOOLS

Drama is financed by the students through their own 

productions . .. 53 

Drama is financed by both the school board and school 

productions. 18 

Drama students finance their own course . 2 


Since drama classes frequently present plays for 
public entertainment and usually make a charge, it was 
desirable to ascertain how the money was used. Was it used 
to improve drama in the school, or was it used for other 











.

TABLE VII 


THE USE OP MONEY RAISED BY DRAMA STUDENTS IN EIGHTY SCHOOLS 


AS REPORTED BY THE TEACHERS OP DRAMA 

The money is used for drama purposes only. 6 

The money is used to purchase athletic equipment .... 29 

The money is used to purchase library books.13 

The money is used to purchase visual aids ....... 17 

The money is used to purchase miscellaneous school needs 52 


The expenses of the drama courses in seven schools 
were met entirely by the school board. Pour questions in 
the questionnaire in regard to finance were not definite. 

It is, therefore, to be assumed that the first claim on the 
money raised by the productions of the drama classes was to 
defray the cost of their productions. The drama classes, 
generally, were self-supporting and any surplus money could 
be used to purchase school equipment. 

The number of schools using some of this income to 
purchase athletic equipment is higher than the twenty-nine 
reported in the table as some of the teachers included 
athletic equipment under miscellaneous school needs.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 

1. With few exceptions the drama course is financed by the 
students through their own productions, 

2. After deducting expenses, the income from productions 
of the drama classes is disbursed for the satisfaction 
of a variety of school needs, although findings in the 
questionnaire would indicate that the drama classes 
might use the money for permanent equipment. ®

CHAPTER VIII 


FACILITIES FOR TEACHING- DRAMA IN THE SCHOOLS 

The facilities for teaching drama are very meagre in 
the majority of schools*

lighting equipment was adequate. The smaller centres had 
little or no lighting equipment, but this would likely be 
accounted for by the fact that a large number of schools-- 
fifty-five—did not have a stage or free access to a stage. 

More than half the city schools did not have a room 
that could be used as a workshop. In the smaller centres 
only twenty out of seventy-four had a classroom with free 
rehearsal space and only four had a workshop. 

Because of inadequate storage space very few of the 
schools could arrange to store properties. Properties were 
borrowed when needed for productions. 

Several teachers added enlightening comments: 

We have the facilities for drama in the local 
community hall. I should prefer purely school 
facilities. 

The stage is available only upon request at cer¬ 
tain periods. 

We have an unheated hall on© and a quarter miles 
away. We us© it once or twice before the final 
performance. 

The chief reason for not teaching drama is the 
lack of facilities. 

We use the front of the classroom for rehearsal 
space and the community hall for production pur¬ 
poses . 

We have the full time use of a stage. 

We have not the use of a stage in school hours. 

(This school had no free rehearsal space.) 

We have the use of a stage once a week at noons. 
(This school had no free rehearsal space.)

We have a classroom with forty-two desks screwed 
to the floor. This could not be considered free 
rehearsal space. The stage is seldom available be¬ 
cause of sport activities. 


SUMMARY OP FINDINGS 


1. More than 60 per cent of the schools reported had no 
classrooms that were suitable for rehearsals or for 
demonstration use. 

2. 75 per cent of the classes in drama did not have free 
access to a stage, although 66 per cent had the part 
time use of one. 

3. Lighting equipment was better in the city schools than 
in the smaller centres. 

4. Very few schools rented lighting equipment from either 
the Department of Extension or from commercial firms. 

5. Space for storage was inadequate in 72 per cent of the 
schools reporting. 

. Some 80 per cent of the schools borrowed or rented their 
stage furnishings.

CHAPTER IX 


TECHNIQUES USED IN THE TEACHING OP DRAMA 

The teachers of drama are anxiously seeking ways and 
means of keeping their students interested in their courses. 
All techniques mentioned in the survey are not used by all 
teachers but it is apparent that a wide variety are in use 
In all drama classes.

Verse speaking is popular both in smaller centres and 
in city schools. Prom their informal comments one learns 
that there is a definite correlation with the English classes. 
One teacher considered that the drama course is justified by 
the advances made by the student in oral English. Another 
teacher said that through drama, Shakespeare might be intro¬ 
duced to students at an earlier level. However, another 
teacher said that there were few occasions where an integra¬ 
tion of drama and English might naturally occur. Although 
seventeen teachers reported no correlation with the English 
classes it may be assumed that, if these teachers do not 
actually teach English, they would not be aware of any 
close connection between their work and the work of the 
English teacher. 

About half the teachers encourage playwriting at the 
junior high school level, but a larger number do so at the 
high school level. There was little correlation reported 
between drama and either the English or social studies 
classes in the city schools but in the smaller centres more 
than half the schools reporting incorporated drama instruc¬ 
tion with their classes in English and social studies. 
Wherever such correlation was undertaken, an effort was 
made to produce worthwhile plays written by students. 

In the teaching of voice and diction the group 
approach is the most popular. This is particularly true

in the cities where large classes make the individual 
approach almost impossible. Formal teaching, incidental 
teaching and a concerted drive on speech problems are used 
whenever possible or needed. 

Only nine schools reported they did not use panto¬ 
mime exercises in teaching acting. One teacher suggested 
that this medium could be used to best advantage in grades 
seven and eight as at that time the students were not so 
self-conscious and were interested in pantomime as a 
creative art. If such work were a continuation of that 
taken in the elementary school the ability and interest of 
the student might b© extended through junior and senior high. 

Excerpts from plays are used by the majority of 
teachers to develop additional elements of acting. 

Most schools design and build their own sets. In one 
case where there were no facilities for play production, 
sets were made in miniature. Unfortunately storage space 
was lacking, and it was necessary to dispose of these sets 
at the end of the project. Very few schools receive any 
help from the Industrial Arts or Home Economics departments. 
It is probable that in many of the smaller centres no such 
departments exist, but in the cities where these subjects 
are taught only half of the reporting schools receive any 
help from such quarters. Some of the city teachers qualified 
the positive reply by writing "some 11 and "a little”.

Period costumes are studied in the junior high by- 
more than half the schools but this is not a popular choice 
for study in the city schools until senior high school 
level. 

Very few schools had done any work with puppets or 
marionettes. In the city schools, none of the junior high 
and only one of the senior high schools had used this 
device. It was more popular in the smaller centres, where 
it had been used in six of the junior high and four of the 
senior high schools. 

The dramatic interest book or scrap book is used 
extensively. About half the schools use them as both 
individual and classroom projects. The majority of city 
schools favored the filing of such material for reference, 
giving the students credit for their contributions, A few 
teachers had used this project in the past but ar8 not using 
it at the present time. 

Some experimentation with make-up is attempted in the 
majority of schools. Sixteen junior highs and seven senior 
highs said they did not do any work in make-up. One teacher 
added that the board made no provision for materials, and 
that if such work was done the materials had to be provided 
by the teacher. 

Only eleven schools have access to a wire or tape 
recorder. One teacher said he would certainly use one if

one were available. Another stated it was invaluable for 
speech work. 11 A wire recorder should be a must in drama,” 
was the emphatic statement made by a third teacher of drama. 
These and similar remarks indicate that the teachers feel a 
great need for such a machine. 

That many teachers of drama are offering a diversi¬ 
fied programme is indicated by the wide variety of techniques 
used. Yet the popularity of drama teaching has declined 
somewhat in recent years. A reason offered for this trend 
is that the teacher’s ingenuity is taxed to the limit to 
meet even the minimum requirements of the course. Ideas and 
interests are curtailed by lack of materials and facilities. 

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 

1. With the exception of puppetry, all the techniques men¬ 
tioned in the questionnaire, verse speaking, exercises 
in voice and speech, playwriting, pantomime, building 
sets, drama work books, and experimentation with make-up 
were used by the majority of teachers. 

2. No difference in techniques was noted between teachers 
in the smaller centres and in city schools. 

3. Very little correlation was reported between drama, 
social studies and English in city schools. There was 
more correlation reported in these subjects in the 


smaller centres.

CHAPTER X 


REFERENCE MATERIALS ON DRAMA IN THE SCHOOL 

An adequate library is as necessary for effective 
work in drama as it is for any other school work. The 
teacher of drama needs, in addition to reference books for 
research, copies of plays for group reading and rehearsal 
purposes. A wide variety of plays, poems and stories should 
be available for speech training. The requests of the drama 
teacher are often eclipsed by the more insistent demands of 
the social studies, English, and science teachers when 
requisitions are being made. Principals and superintendents 
are too often not aware of the need, and feel that they have 
done their duty when they see that the prescribed drama text 
is in the school library. 

Because of the wide range of reference materials in 
the schools, it is impossible to ascertain actual library 
facilities for drama courses. The purpose of the survey was 
to discover whether, in the teacher ? s opinion, the library 
was adequate. 

In the opinion of teachers, the majority of schools 
have not sufficient library books for drama references. 

Their stock of plays for reading and production appeared 
even worse. The facilities of the Department of Extension 
do not appear to be utilized to full advantage. One might

SUMMARY OP FINDINGS 

1. Slightly over 70 per cent of the teachers in the smaller 
centres reported an inadequate reference library for 
drama • 

2. Conditions were better in the cities where 44 per cent 

of the teachers reported an inadequate library for drama. 

3. Insufficient copies of pla,ys for reading, play selection 
and rehearsal purposes were reported by approximately 80 
per cent of the teachers in the smaller centres and 
approximately 46 per cent In the cities. 

4. Despite the fact that reference material was lacking in 
varying degrees in all the schools reporting, only about 
one third of the teachers of drama made use of the 
Department of Extensions services to drama classes. 

5. The majority of teachers of drama had difficulty in 
obtaining plays suitable for productions in junior high 
schools. The difficulty was greater among city teachers. 

6. The difficulty of play selection for senior drama 
students was not so great as for junior students although 
approximately 50 per cent of teachers of drama in the 
high school had this difficulty.

CHAPTER XI 


TEACHERS f AND SUPERINTENDENTS* OPINIONS ON THE 
EFFECTIVENESS OF DRAM INSTRUCTION IN THE SCHOOLS 


The teachers of drama and the superintendents were 
asked in the questionnaire to state their opinions on the 
effectiveness of drama instruction in the schools in an 
informal way. It is not possible to organize these opinions 
in the form of a table; therefore, individual opinions will 
be cited in this chapter. 

The Programme of Studies For the Intermediate School 
outlines the objectives of the drama courses as: 

1* To provide for the students opportunities for 
creative enjoyment, 

2. To continue and develop the work in drama¬ 
tisation early begun In the elementary schools, 
with the purpose of stimulating the imagination, 
encouraging self-expression, developing self- 
assurance and character, and inculcating social 
and moral ideals, 

3* To integrate Dramatics with other materials of 
the curriculum. 

4. To impart an elementary knowledge of the arts 
of the theatre, 

5. To provide as much opportunity as possible for 
the students to act, the technical details of 
the stage are being taught gradually and to 
some extent incidentally. This technique will 
include correct posture, voice production, 
enunciation, poise, self-control, stage group¬ 
ing, stage mechanics, 

6. To familiarize the student with some good plays, 
and to develop their ability to read and to view 
plays with critical appreciation.

7. To assist the pupils in developing grace of 
speech and grace of movement, through dramatic 
activity. 

8. The correlation of the work in Dramatics with 
the other school subjects: General Science 
(stage lighting, sound effects and acoustics, 
special stage effects). 

Manual Arts (stage-craft and properties). 

Dress-making (historical and other costumes 
and their improvisation). 

Junior Business (typing manuscripts, business 
management of plays in production). 

9. To develop a sense of leadership and responsi¬ 
bility by putting students in charge of 
direction, stage-management, stage-craft and 
committees on costuming, properties and business 
management. 6 

Teachers were asked: !, What do you think drama does 
for the boy or girl taking the course? 11 Each teacher sug¬ 
gested one or two ways in which the student benefited. If 
these benefits were assembled they would be the equivalent 
of the objectives listed above. Varying circumstances and 
differences in teacher ability determine which of the 
objectives are attained. 

Most teachers are agreed that drama can accomplish 
much in the improvement of speaking and reading habits. 

This comment was made by one teacher of drama: "Drama gives 
the students training and confidence in themselves in 
speaking and acting before an audience. It makes them

conscious of good posture and speech," Another said, "My 
main objective at present is to teach my pupils to speak and 
read correctly. I find that even Grade XI pupils are incap¬ 
able of good oral reading." Surely, if drama can make pupils 
more desirous of speaking and reading well, it is a commend¬ 
able achievement. 

That drama provides for the students opportunities for 
creative enjoyment is evident in such remarks as these: "It 
provides an immense amount of pleasure and good fun*" "Most 
of my students enjoy reading and interpreting plays. To most 
of them acting on the stage before an audience is an oppor¬ 
tunity for self-expression." One teacher, however, felt that 
the students take the attitude that it is a period to do 
nothing but rest, and said, "With my crowded program I find 
I can f t treat the course adequately." 

It is encouraging that so many teachers feel that 
drama can assist in the development of personality. "Drama 
gives more self-confidence," is a remark that appeared 
often. The teacher who said, "The most important thing 
drama can do in a rural school is to broaden the children^ 
interests," shows the understanding and enthusiasm which 
will bring continued growth in school drama. Some stated 
that the class provides an opportunity for improving social 
relations and that often it provides "a means of gaining 
approval for many who might not get it otherwise,"

Several of the superintendents said they saw so little 
of the work done in drama that they were unable to judge its 
value. Others did not appear to have based their opinions on 
observation of drama classes at work, but rather on what they 
hoped drama would do for the boy and girl. ”Drama should 
develop poise, ability to perform before a group. It should 
develop an appreciation of drama” was the remark of one of 
these superintendents. ”Drama has many possibilities,” was 
the cryptic but not illuminating remark made by another 
superintendent. Those who had based their opinion on obser¬ 
vation had varied views. One said gloomily, ”1 know of no 
way to evaluate it, but I assume it can do no harm. I see 
so little of It and I don’t know the pupils Intimately 
enough to note the difference. 11 A similar remark was made 
by another: "It's effectiveness varies very greatly. The 
result is generally pitiful due to lack of time, equipment 
and ability on the part of the teacher.” A more encouraging 
remark was: ”The results in drama are becoming rather 
gratifying in larger schools where facilities are being 
improved. In smaller schools small enrolments and lack of 
facilities seriously hamper the average teacher.” The 
remaining superintendents gave opinions as to the objectives 
that paralleled those given in the Programme of Studies , but 
it is difficult to decide whether they were listing actual 
school accomplishment or suggesting desired outcomes.

A few of the superintendents admitted that they had 
little or no opportunity to observe drama classes in action. 
The superintendents were aware that in many centres the 
facilities for teaching drama were lacking. There is an 
opportunity here for the superintendents to give encourage¬ 
ment and help to their teachers by instituting a programme 
to provide equipment for the drama classes. 

The teachers appear to be convinced of the value of 
the drama courses if the conditions under which they are 
teaching could be improved. Under present conditions they 
feel it difficult to evaluate the general effectiveness of 
the course. !, In large classes it is difficult to evaluate 
what a child gains. When a class of thirty-five or more 
students has only a thirty-five minute period individual 
growth or attitude is hard to measure. tf 

SUMMARY OP FINDINGS 

1. All teachers of drama did not emphasize the same 
objectives but all objectives were achieved in the 
over-all picture, 

2. The objectives of the drama course as given by the 
superintendents paralleled those in the Programme of 
Studies ^ but it was not possible from the question¬ 
naire to decide whether they were reporting from obser¬ 
vation or whether they were anticipating these objectives.

3. The majority of teachers and superintendents are con¬ 
vinced of the value of the drama course but found it 
difficult to evaluate because drama is taught under such 
varying conditions.

CHAPTER XII 


TEACHERS* AND SUPERINTENDENTS* EVALUATION 
OP THE PRESENT DRAMA COURSE 

Not all teachers took the opportunity to estimate the 
worth of the course. Those who made comments did not object 
to the course as a whole but rather to the conditions under 
which they are forced to work. The general opinion was that 
the course is sufficiently flexible for adaptation to the 
needs and capabilities of the various student groups. Many 
teachers expressed a hope that if the course were revised it 
would not be in the direction of greater rigidity. 

An analysis of the suggestions for revision showed 
that what the teachers really want is more direction and 
help. Beginning teachers are accepting the course as pre¬ 
scriptive rather than suggestive. They found the prescribed 
textbook for junior high school drama hopelessly Inadequate. 
While many teachers have surmounted this difficulty, there 
are conditions under which a text is essential, and experi¬ 
enced and Inexperienced teachers alike have found a worth¬ 
while text a valuable aid. A teacher who is familiar with 
conditions both in the smaller centres and in the city said, 
**A satisfactory text for 8ach course in drama is most 
desirable, especially in the smaller schools.’ 1 

The most pressing need, however, was for help in play 
selection. The Department of Education was criticized by

many for failing to give adequate assistance in this regard. 
The list of plays has not been altered or extended since it 
was compiled in 1936. Furthermore, the teacher who really 
needs help in choosing a play finds the list of titles of 

little assistance. One teacher made this comment, n . 

I wonder which plays are suitable for grades seven and eight 
and what each play is about. As the list is now I might 
just as well close my eyes and put my finger on one. 

Having put her finger on one she probably finds that the 
play is one of a collection which will take months to obtain. 
One teacher offered this solution, ”The Department of Educa¬ 
tion might publish collections of current plays for use in 
the school.” 

The Programme of Studies states, ”The number of pupils 
in each Dramatic class should not exceed twenty. A greater 
enrolment than this would make rehearsals difficult, if not 
impossible, A class of fifteen pupils would be nearly ideal. 
72 per cent of the teachers in the cities and 20 per cent of 
the teachers in the smaller centres have classes up to twice 
the maximum number recommended and find themselves incapable 
of accomplishing anything worthwhile. Without some coopera¬ 
tion between the Department of Education and the school 
boards, the teachers are powerless to remedy this situation.

At the opposite extreme there are teachers having to teach 
drama to two or three students. 

Teachers were even more voluble in their complaints 
about the attitude of the school boards. "The lack of 
importance attached to the course by the school boards 
results in a woefully inadequate place to work and no sup¬ 
plies except what we provide for ourselves." Thi3 teacher*s 
comment was echoed by sufficient numbers of teachers to 
indicate a very serious obstacle to the survival of any 
teacher enthusiasm in drama. To quote: 

Our school board has never spent one cent on drama. 

My chief gripe is the inadequate provision of 
facilities and finance for drama projects. If drama 
is to be offered at all it should be done with a 
view to doing it adequately. Under the present set¬ 
up a teacher’s ingenuity is certainly taxed to the 
limit. 

The satisfactory solution of the foregoing problems 
might eliminate a third major difficulty, namely: the out- 
of-school hours spent in rehearsals. Smaller classes and 
better facilities would make it possible to produce a play 
with a minimum of after-school work. This would serve to 
maintain class interest and conserve teacher energy. It 
would also make it possible for consolidated schools served 
by buses to fulfil more adequately the objectives of the 
Programme of Studies. One city teacher suggested that the 


double class period might lessen extra-curricular activity

in the subject. Sets could be built and rehearsals carried 
out in school time. This would probably be practical in a 
limited number of schools. 

A few teachers considered that their training had not 
fitted them for the conditions they found in their schools. 
One young man summed up the situation this way, "Teaching 
drama in a rural school is not the same as being taught in 
the university. Being accustomed to using proper lighting, 
costumes, flats and make-up makes it difficult for a teacher 
to adjust where no equipment for drama is present." 

It is evident from the teachers* remarks quoted above 
that some, at least, are becoming discouraged. 

The principal of a fairly large high school in south¬ 
ern Alberta reported that while there were four teachers 
with drama qualifications on the staff there was not one 
teacher willing to teach the subject. This is a situation 
which is likely to become more prevalent each year unless 
something is done to make the courses more inviting. 

Four superintendents confirmed the opinions of the 
teachers by stating that facilities and extra school time 
must be provided for the drama courses to bring about any 
improvement. One reported that the results in his division 
were becoming rather gratifying in the larger schools where 
facilities were being improved. 

The superintendents gave varied opinions on the

effectiveness and value of the drama course. Fifteen super¬ 
intendents were satisfied with the course in varying degrees 
whereas ten were dissatisfied. Of the remainder, eight made 
no comment and four would not advance a considered opinion 
as they had had little experience in drama in their super¬ 
visory capacity. Opinion was divided on the value of the 
programme of the drama course but a majority felt that in 
large degree the course achieved its objectives in the hands 
of the good teacher. 

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 

1, The drama course as outlined in the Programme of Studies 
is flexible enough to meet the needs of the teachers. 

2. A general complaint was the lack of facilities provided 
in the schools for the teaching of drama. 

5. The Department of Education could offer more direction 
and help in the selection of reference materials and 
plays for production. 

4. The maximum of twenty students in a drama class as 
recommended in the Programme of Studies is not enforced. 
The majority of city teachers and 20 per cent of the 
teachers in the smaller centres find their classes so 
large that effective work is impossible. 

5, In the opinion of the teachers the school boards are not 
carrying their share of the cost of the drama course.

6# Teachers of drama are required to spend too much out-of- 
school time in directing rehearsals. Smaller classes, 
better conditions for work, and double class periods 
were suggested as solutions to this problem. 

7. Some teachers were discouraged because they thought their 
training had not fitted them to cope with conditions 
found in the schools. As a result other teachers with 
qualifications in drama did not want to teach the sub¬ 
ject. 

8. One superintendent reported progress in drama in his 
division where the facilities for teaching the course 
were being improved. 

9. The opinions of the superintendents on the value and 
effectiveness of the course varied greatly. Approxi¬ 
mately 35 per cent of the superintendents were satisfied 
and 20 per cent were dissatisfied. The remainder did 
not express an opinion. 

10. On the whole, the superintendents considered the course 
achieved the main objectives in the hands of a good 


teacher.

CHAPTER XIII 


CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS 
AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY 

This chapter is devoted to conclusions which emerge 
from the data collected. The conclusions are presented in 
tabulated form and will be followed by the recommendations. 

CONCLUSIONS 

1. The majority of the teachers of drama have not taken 
courses leading to higher certification. 75*1 per cent 
of them have junior certificates, 18.8 per cent have 
senior certificates and 5-8 per cent have the Faculty of 
Education methods course in drama. 

2. There is a scarcity of teachers qualified to teach drama. 
34.9 per cent of the superintendents admit experiencing 
difficulty in getting teachers with a junior certificate 
and 65.1 per cent admit having difficulty in getting 
teachers with a senior certificate. 

3* Three superintendents considered that aptitude and 

ability are important prerequisites for the teaching of 
drama. 

4. 62.9 per cent of the students in the schools reporting 

are interested in their drama course. The remainder are 
apparently taking the course because of timetable clash 
or because drama is considered an easy option.

5. Large numbers in 77.7 per cent of city classes make 
effective work in drama difficult. Class enrolment is 
not a problem in 68.8 per cent of the smaller centres. 

6. Fifty-three classes out of eighty reporting finance their 
own course by public performance where a charge is made. 
Surplus income is used to purchase athletic equipment, 
library books, visual aids, and miscellaneous school 
needs. 

7. 63 per cent of the schools do not have classrooms suit¬ 
able for rehearsals and 73 per cent do not have class¬ 
rooms for demonstration use® 68 per cent do not have 
free access to a stage. 

8. Production equipment is not provided in 78 per cent of 
the schools® 

9. Reference books, plays for reading and play selection 
are not provided in sufficient numbers to supply the 
needs of the students. 

10. 37 per cent of the teachers of drama took advantage of 
the services offered by the Department of Extension. 

11. A wide variety of techniques: verse speaking, exercises 
in voice and speech, playwriting, pantomime, building 
sets, drama work books, and experimentation with make¬ 
up was used by the teachers of drama. Work with puppets 
was carried on in very few schools. 

12. A tape or wire recorder was available in eleven schools.

13. Correlation between drama and English and social studies 
was not in evidence in the reports of the teachers in 
city schools, probably because of more rigid depart¬ 
mentalization. 

14. The majority of teachers and superintendents seemed 
convinced of the value of drama, but found it difficult 
to evaluate because drama is taught under such varying 
conditions. 

15. The drama course as outlined in the Programme of Studies 
is flexible enough to meet the needs of the teachers, 
but more direction and help could be offered by the 
Department of Education in the selection of reference 
materials and plays for production. 

16. The opinions of the superintendents on the value and 
effectiveness of the course varied. 35 per cent were 
satisfied and 20 per cent were dissatisfied. The 
remainder did not express an opinion. 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

1. The scarcity of teachers of drama might be alleviated 
by encouraging qualified teachers to resume teaching of 
the subject by making the position more attractive 
through limiting numbers in a class and by provision of 
more adequate facilities for rehearsals and demonstra¬ 


tions

2. Student interest should be the major prerequisite for 
enrolment in drama classes. Students taking the course 
because of timetable clash or because drama is consid¬ 
ered an easy option seldom contribute to class progress. 

3. The maximum of twenty students in a drama class as 
recommended in the Programme of Studies should be en¬ 
forced to make effective work in drama possible. 

4. Care should be taken that drama students do not get the 
impression that the sole purpose of the drama course is 
play production. The play is the culmination of one 
phase of the work in drama. 

5. During this period of extensive building* the Department 
of Education should be careful to see that new schools 
should have an assembly hall with proper acoustics* a 
stage* dressing rooms equipped with running water* and 
proper storage space for drama equipment. 

6. The school boards should be mad© aware of their 
responsibility in providing reference books* make-up 
kits, and tools for building sets as standard equipment. 
The school boards should encourage the teacher to 
requisition for copies of plays, lumber, paint, and 
other articles that might be needed from time to time. 

7. The services of the Department of Extension should be 
brought to the attention of the teachers by the Depart¬ 


ment of Education

8. Films should he made available by the Department of 
Education for use in drama classes. Films on puppetry 
might prove of interest. 

9. The wire or tape recorder is valuable for speech train¬ 
ing. Such a machine should be available wherever enrol¬ 
ment is large enough to justify the expenditure. 

10. Correlation between drama and English and social studies 
should be encouraged by cooperation between the teachers 
coneerned. 

11. The Department of Education should issue periodic bulle¬ 
tins to keep teachers of drama informed about plays 
suitable for production. It should be possible to get 
plays on loan for study before school boards are asked 
to make the purchase. 

12. The drama course should be reviewed by a committee of 
teachers of drama and officials from the Department of 
Education. Discussions by teachers of drama at conven¬ 
tions might offer some guide to those who have the 
responsibility of reviewing the course. 

SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY 

This study was designed as a broad survey of the 
teaching of drama in Alberta schools. Its nature forbade 
intensive examination of certain problems which might prove 
fruitful areas for future study. Three such problems are

listed below. 

1. Student interest in drama came under only superficial 
scrutiny. A major study of student interest might be 
made through student questionnaire, case study, or other 
devices by means of which the interest of students in 
drama might be classified, thus yielding important in¬ 
sights for teachers of drama. 

2. Correlation of drama with English, social studies, and 
other subjects might provide a profitable study. It 
appears that correlation occurs in the smaller schools 
where departmentalization is more flexible than in city 
schools. A study of the nature of conditions of drama 
with other subjects in Canadian, English and American 
schools might prove of value. 

3* The structure and equipment of the physical facilities 
for drama in modern schools in Canada, Europe and the 
United States might be investigated. Such an investiga¬ 
tion should prove of value to those planning to build 
an auditorium suitable for drama productions.
