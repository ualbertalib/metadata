SYNOPSIS 


The author's aim in this study was to investigate the 
advisability of establishing a composite high school to serve 
the Picture Butte area. This involved an evaluation of the 
adequacy of the existing small high schools in serving the 
needs of the people of high school age in the area, the 
proposal of a plan for a composite high school, and an 
appraisal of the feasibility of the plan. 

A survey of school enrolments indicated a relatively 
small proportion of students in the high school grades and a 
high drop-out rate in these grades. In comparison with larger 
schools offering Qiore diversified programs, the proportion of 
students completing high school in this area was found to be 
low. It was concluded that the traditional academic program 
offered in the schools of this area was not suited to the 
interests and aptitudes of a large number of students enter¬ 
ing high school. 

A plan for establishing a composite high school at 
Picture Butte over a period of three years was outlined. 

The program for this school provided for expansion of the 
curriculum by the addition of courses in commercial and shop 
subjects. This program would enable a student to obtain a 
high school diploma by any one of the following routes: an 
academic course, a commercial course, a technical course in 
shop subjects, or a general course.

It was found that with the exception of the shop 
building, existing high school buildings at Picture Butte 
would be adequate for the implementation of the plan. 

A new shop building, or at least an extension to the 
existing building, would be necessary. 

To carry out the proposed plan, the three smaller 
high schools in the area would be closed and the students 
from those schools would be transported to Picture Butte. 

The reduction in the high school teaching staffs at these 
smaller schools would be offset by an increase in the Picture 
Butte staff, and the number of teachers serving the area 
would remain unchanged. 

The transportation of students from the more distant 
small schools was a major factor considered in assessing the 
feasibility of the plan. It was shown that minor changes in 
the daily time schedules of the different schools would make 
transportation possible without undue hardship on any group 
of students. 

The main increases in costs would result from the 
extra transportation, and from providing a building and 
equipment for the shop courses. It was not considered that 
this additional expenditure would cause an excessive increase 
in the tax burden in the area. 

In general the establishment of a composite high 
school for the Picture Butte area was found to be desirable 
and feasible.

CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 

1. Reason for the Investigation 

Since the formation of the first school divisions in 
Alberta in 1936 great changes have been brought about in 
rural education. In many respects the Lethbridge School 
Division has been among the leaders in this progress. In the 
fifteen years of divisional administration nearly all the one- 
roomed schools in the Division, and practically all were of 
that kind in 1936, have been replaced by multi-roomed central 
schools with auditoria, shop and home economics rooms, and 
equipment such as typewriters, duplicating machines, and 
motion picture projectors. 

A good deal of this progress is due to the foresight of 
Mr. Owen Williams, Superintendent of the Lethbridge School 
Division from its beginning until his retirement in 1951. 

Mr. Williams suggested in 1949 that an investigation into the 
advisability of establishing a composite high school in picture 
Butte to serve the surrounding area would be of practical 
value. Although all children of high school age have easy 
access to the existing small high schools, he doubted that 
they were adequately served because of the rather limited 
curricula of these schools. Mr. Williams visualized composite 
high schools throughout the southern part of tne Province, and.

finally, a junior college, affiliated with the University of 
Alberta, in the City of Lethbridge. 

This study was undertaken to analyze the weaknesses of 
the existing high school system in the picture Butte area and 
to investigate the feasibility of a composite-type high school 
to improve high school services. 

S. Txie Problem 

This investigation attempts to determine whether it 
would be advisable for the Lethbridge School Division, in the 
near future, to replace the four existing small high schools 
in the Picture Butte area by one centralized school offering 
a much more diversified program than the present schools. To 
determine this, answers are sought to the following questions: 

1. In what respects, if any, and to what extent, does 
the present system of small high schools in the area 
fail to serve the needs of the people of high school 
age ? In view of existing buildings, equipment, staff, 
and bus service, is a justifiably large proportion 
of the people of high school age in school and are 
they satisfactorily completing the high school program ? 
What justification is there to assume that a more 
diversified program would serve better than the 
existing programs ?

2. Taking into account available facilities and probable 
enrolment, what kind of expanded program, in terms of 
specific courses, is possible ? 

5. Is such a program practical ? Could students from all 
parts of the area get to the school ? Could such a 
school and program be financed without an excessive 
increase in the tax burden ? Ho?/ could such a pro¬ 
gram be implemented ? 


This study has the following limitations: 

1. The area under consideration is that part of the 
Division now served by schools at Turin, Iron 
Springs, Barrhill, Shaugnnessy, Diamond City, 
and Picture Butte. 

2. The proposed new program is for Grades X, XI and 
XII only. The lower grades are not considered 
except insofar as they are affected by the changes 
which would be made in the high school. 

5. The study is limited to the consideration of the 
desirability and feasibility of establishing a 
composite high school and not with possible future 
problems of its development and administration.

3. Plan of Procedure 

A general description of the picture Butte area and 
a Brief history of some aspects of the development of the 
Lethbridge School Division will be given as a background to 
the investigation. 

A survey will be made of existing school buildings in 
the area* their equipment, high school programs offered 
in the different schools, organization of the schools by 
grades, and trends in enrolments. The adequacy of the exist- 
ing system and the need for a new system will be inferred from 
a study of the proportion of students in the high school grades, 
the number leaving during their high school years, the success 
of those who remain in school, the success of students in 
different types of subjects, and from comparisons with other 
schools. 

Some information will be given on composite high schools 
in general and an attempt will be made to outline some of their 
basic characteristics. 

A fairly definite program will be outlined for the Pic¬ 
ture Butte area and details of its implementation over a period 
of three years will be described. 

A plan to transport the students from all parts of the 
area to the school will be discussed. 

Finally, some consideration will be given to the finan¬ 
cial implications of the whole proposal for the composite nigh 
school.

4. Definition of Terms 


Centralization —The process of forming a large scnool by trans- 
porting the pupils of smaller, scattered schools. 

Centre —A school resulting from centralization, a term in 
common use in the Picture Butte area. 

Circuit —The itinerary of a teacher who serves more than one 
school. It applies in this area only to teachers of 
shop and home economics subjects. 

Commercial courses— Courses in typewriting, bookkeeping, office 
practice, etc. 

Composite high school- —Strictly, a very large high scnool 

offering instruction in practically every course on the 
Alberta high school program. Where used in this work 
in reference to a proposed school for the Picture Butte 
area, it means the beginning of such a school, i.e., a 
school offering a range of courses in commercial and. 
technical subjects in addition to academic courses. 1 

Constants --Courses in English, social studies, and health, 
comprising nearly 40% of the requirements for a high 
school diploma—compulsory for all students. 

Diversified program— The program of studies of a composite 
high school. 

Division— The large unit of school administration in Alberta. 
When used in this work, capitalized, the Lethbridge 
School Division No. 7 is meant. 

Electives —All courses other than constants. Choice among 
these coursesis limited to some extent by diploma 
requirements. 

Technical courses —Courses in shop subjects such as wood¬ 
work and automotives. The term is often used to include, 
also, home economics subjects such as foods and nutrition. 


1 The definition of the term ’’composite high school’ 1 
is more fully developed in Chapter III.

5. Description of the Area 

Figure 1, page 7, shows the boundaries of the Lethbridge 
School Division and its location in relation to surrounding 
towns. The City of Lethbridge is Yd.thin the boundaries but is 
not a part of the Division. As a consequence of the establish¬ 
ment of certain co-terminous areas in the southern part of the 
Province, the boundaries of the Division were changed in Jan¬ 
uary 1954. These changes are indicated in Figure 1. Although 
the Division was considerably reduced in size, the school 
population was reduced by only about IQ|>. The total assess¬ 
ment, however, was decreased by nearly 20 %,^ 

The shaded portion of the map, which constitutes the east¬ 
ern part of the Lethbridge Northern Irrigation District, repre¬ 
sents the area under consideration in this investigation. It is 
referred to in this study as the Picture Butte area. It has nat¬ 
ural boundaries on the east and south, the Little Bow ana the Old 
Man Rivers respectively; the northern boundary is the boundary of 
the Division and the western boundary is, roughly, a north and 
south line about four miles west of Diamond City. The map shows 
that the Division lost a small part of the Picture Butte area as 
a result of the 1954 boundary changes. However, the effect of this 
loss is negligible insofar as this investigation is concerned. 

1 These percentages were calculated from figures given 
in the Annual Report of the Superintendent to the Electors 
and Divisional Board, 1955.

The Picture Butte area comprises a total of about 300 
square miles. The larger map in the appendix shows the 
region in some detail. 

Figure 2 shows the distribution of population by town¬ 
ships for the area.l The populations of the hamlets, Turin, 
Diamond City, Shaughnessy and Iron Springs, are included here 
in the township figures as they are in the census report. 

1 The population figures are from the Dominion Bureau 
of Statistics, Ninth Census of Canada , 1951, Bulletin 1-2.

The population of Picture Butte, an incorporated village, is 
counted separately. 1 An estimate of the total population 
of the shaded area in Figure 2 is 5000 people. This is a 
rather rough estimate because the boundaries of the area under 
consideration do not follow township lines. The greatest 
density of population is along an axis through the hamlets 
and the village of Picture Butte. This does not mean, however 
that most of the people live in the hamlets and village. On 
the contrary, by far the greater number of the people live 
on farms. Buch a concentration of population on farms is 
made possible by irrigation, for, in tnis area, practically 
all the land is "under the ditch 11 . By contrast, the Figure 
shows that the population in the townships east of the Little 
Bow River, where the land is not irrigated, is, on the average 
much lower. 

The people of the area are of many racial origins. 

In 1941 large numbers of Japanese were sent to the area from 
British Columbia. They were largely employed as beet workers, 
but many have since moved away while ooners have established 
themselves on farms or in business. For several years there 
has been considerable immigration from Europe. In the years 
just after World War 11 many of these were displaced persons 

1 The population of Picture Butte was 865 according 

to the 1951 census.

from central Europe, while more recently, large numbers 
have come from the Netherlands and Germany. However, this 
immigration has not resulted in a rapid increase in population 
because most of the immigrants have remained nere only a year 
or two before moving elsewhere, especially to the cities. Mr. 

P. M. Sauder, Director of Colonization, L.N.I.D., stated in 1950 
in a letter to the writer that in his opinion no great increase 
in population would be likely to occur within the next few years. 

The increase in population between 1946 and 1951 is pro¬ 
bably a fair indication of the rate of growth. The total popu¬ 
lation, including Picture Butte, of the tw r enty townships shown in 
Figure 2, page 8, was 6254 in 1946. 1 In 1951 this total "was 
6840, an increase of 586. In this period the population of the 
village of Picture Butte alone increased from 689 to 865. Thus 
the rate of increase in the area exclusive of Picture Butte was 
7.4 %, while the increase in Picture Butte was 25.6%. 

Agriculture is the main industry. Wheat is the chief 
grain although the coarse grains, too, are important. There 
are ten elevators in the area to handle the grain crop. Perhaps 
the most important crop, from the point of view of the number 
of people employed and the value of the product, is sugar beets. 
The sugar factory at Picture Butte, established in 1956, is a 
branch of Canadian Sugar Factories Limited. It processes

annually about 130,000 tons of beets which yield about 
13,400 tons of sugar. The factory employs over 300 workers 
during the processing period, (usually October, November 
and December), and about 150 during the rest of the year. 

A large livestock industry depends on a by-product of the 
sugar manufacture. The beet pulp, supplemented with grain 
and alfalfa, is an excellent food for fattening cattle. All 
winter tnis pulp is carried by trucks to feed lots in the 
surrounding area. Hogs and sheep are raised in large numbers 
and dairying is important. 

A large coal mine is operated at Shaugnnessy by the 
Lethbridge Collieries Limited. Coal mines were formerly 
operated at Diamond City (Commerce) and Picture Butte. 

No other minerals are of much importance, although several 
gravel pits are Y/orked in the area ana natural gas has been 
discovered near Turin. 

Provincial Highway No 25 runs from Letnbridge through 
Diamond City, Shaughnessy, Picture Butte and Iron Springs 
to Turin. The Lethbridge to Picture Butte section of this 
road is an up-to-date, hard surfaced highway completed in 1353. 
The Picture Butte to Turin section is a fairly good gravelled 
road. Most of the district roads are used as van routes 
which are indicated on the map in the appendix. These 
roads, built and maintained by the Municipal District of 
Barons No 25, are nearly all graded high to prevent the 
accumulation of sno*wdrifts in winter, and many of them

have some gravel. The Canadian Pacific Railway operates a 
branch line from Lethbridge to Turin which carries one mixed 
train weekly, and more frequent freight trains as far as 
Picture Butte. During the beet harvest, trains operate daily 
carrying beets to Picture Butte. A daily passenger bus service 
is provided from Lethbridge to Turin by Northern Bus Lines 
Limited, and commercial vehicles carry on a regular trucking 
service over the same route. 

The village of Picture Butte and the hamlets, as well 
as most of the rural area, are served with electricity by 
the Calgary Power Company. The extension of this service to 
the rural area has taken place mainly between 1949 and 1955. 

In 1955 the village of Picture Butte completed the installation 
of a water supply and sewage disposal system. 

Two lakes have been created by the irrigation system. 

These are Park Lake, a fine resort and picnic grounds, and 
Keho Lake, a fairly large reservoir. A small reservoir 
adjacent to Picture Butte supplies water for the sugar factory. 

6. Some Aspects of the History of the Lethbridge 
School Division No.7 

The Lethbridge School Division, formed in 1957, was 
among the first established following the experimental ones 
at Berry Creek and Turner Valley. At that time the Division 
comprised about seventy school districts, nearly all of which

supported one-room schools. Under divisional administration 

centralization was rapid, resulting in a great reduction in 

the number of one-room schools ana the establishment of multi- 

roomed schools. By 1955 there remained only seven one-room 

schools. As these were located in scattered Buttente Colonies, 

they did not lend themselves to centralization. In the same 

year there were eighteen schools of from two to nineteen rooms, 

and fourteen of them had six or more rooms. This centralization 

was hastened, and in part made possible, by the inclusion of 

village and consolidated schools in the Division as follows 

1940 Wrentham Consolidated School 
1942 Readymade Consolidated School 
1942 Carmangay Village School (transferred 
to the Macleod Division in 1946 and 
subsequently to the Vulcan County) 

1945 Warner Consolidated School 
1947 Nobleford Village School 
1947 Coaidale Consolidated School 

There have been no inclusions since 1947 and the 

o 

boundaries of the Division have remained unchanged until 1954. 
Hence the increase in the number of classrooms operated 
is a rough indication of the grov^rth of the school pop¬ 
ulation. The number of classrooms operated in September

Since the formation of the Division, a new school, 
or at least a considerable addition to existing buildings, 
has been built at each of the nineteen centres. Most of the 
building has been done since 1946. The following list of the 
sales of debentures by the Division indicates the extent of 
the building program:^

Among the largest schools built ?/ere the following: 

1947 McNally, seven classrooms.

in 1951). 

1950 Picture Butte, eight classrooms, (four classrooms 
added in 1952). 

1950 Coaldale, eighteen classrooms.

In addition to the classrooms mentioned all of these 
schools have special rooms such as auditoria, laboratories, 
shops, home economics rooms, libraries, and offices. The 
building program is continuing, for there remain a few 
obsolete buildings to replace, and the increasing population 
at Coaldale and Picture Butte necessitates additional class¬ 
rooms. 

Centralization brings with it the problem of trans¬ 
portation of the pupils from their homes to the school. 

Table 1 gives some indication of the extent of this service 
in the Lethbridge School Division.

In 1953 about 65$ of all pupils enrolled in the 
schools of the Division were transported daily, and the cost 
of this service accounted for nearly 20$ of the total 
expenditure of the Division* These facts illustrate the 
magnitude of the transportation problem* Of the eighty- 
nine busses used in 1953, thirty-eight were owned by the 
Division while the other fifty-one were provided by contract 
with private owners. 

Figure 3, page 17, shows the part of the Division 
under consideration in this investigation and the approximate 
location of the schools which existed at the time of the 
formation of the Division* There were then about nineteen 
schools, nearly all of only one room. Those indicated by 
0*s in the Figure no longer exist, but in place of them 
there are now six school centres. The smallest of these, 
which is at Shaughnessy, is a school of four rooms. Besides 
the large building at Picture Butte mentioned above, new 
buildings have been erected at each of the other centres 
since the formation of the Division. The development of 
these centralized schools is especially noteworthy as there 
were no town, village, or consolidated schools in the area 
when the Division was formed in 1937* Although Picture Butte 
is a village, it was Incorporated only in 194-3; in fact, it 
is only since the establishment of the sugar factory there 
in 1936 that it has become the largest centre of population

in the area. 

Brief as this sketch of the development of the Division 
is, it indicates that the people of the area are forward- 
looking in the matter of the education of their children. It 
seems to. indicate also that the people of this area would 
support further improvement in facilities for education if 
a need were shown and a practical plan for such improvement 


could be found

CHAPTER II 


A SURVEY OF THE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES AND NEEDS OF THE 
PICTURE BUTTE AREA 

This survey includes the schools at Turin, Barrhill, 
Iron Springs, Shaughnessy, Diamond City, ana the two schools 
at Picture Butte, elementary and high. The location of 
these schools is shown on the map in the Appendix. 

1. Existing School Facilities 

The number of classrooms and auxiliary rooms at the 
six school centres in the area are shown in Table II, page 
19. All classrooms are about standard size, approximately 
thirty-two feet by twenty^two feet, and have the usual 
classroom equipment. The rooms listed under "general pur¬ 
pose rooms" are about equal in size to two classrooms; they 
are used for physical education, meetings and assemblies, 
music, and film showings. The auditoria-gymnasia are larger 
than the general purpose rooms, and, in addition to the uses 
of the latter, are also used for public performances of 
dramatics and music, dances, and basketball. The rooms listed 
under the other headings require no further explaiiation. 

The data of the table give only a rough indication 
of the adequacy of the various school plants. This is 
because there is no uniformity of construction at the

different centres. With the exception of Barrhill all schools 
are made up of two or more separate buildings. Some of these 
are new, some are fairly old, while others are old one-room 
schools which have been moved from their original locations. 
Except in the Picture Butte High School, laboratories, ofiices, 
libraries, and staff rooms are quite small. The only basement 
classrooms are in the Picture Butte Elementary School, but in 
some of the other schools basement rooms are used as shops, 
home economics rooms, and laboratories. The poorest facilities 
exist at the Picture Butte Elementary School and at Shaugh- 
nessy. However, a new school, to be ready for use in 1954, 
is under construction at Shaughnessy, and a new elementary 
school is planned for Picture Butte.^ 

All the schools are fairly well equipped. The shops 
are suitable for the general courses in shop subjects of tne 
junior and senior high school. Most of the equipment is for 
woodworking, and includes, besides the common hand tools, 
some power tools such as lathes, band savs is, drill presses, 
and grinders. However, the. shops are rather small and not 
well provided with storage space. Home economics rooms are 
adequately equipped for junior high school courses ana for 
Home Economics 1. Each school has a moving picture projector.. 


At the time this was written a site for the new school had 
been selected and architects* plans studied, but a contract 
for construction had not yet been let.

a duplicating machine, and some typewriters. Since the School 
Board makes a substantial annual grant for books, quite good 
libraries have been built up. Laboratory equipment is sat¬ 
isfactory for general science ana chemistry* but apparatus 
for senior high school physics is not adequate except in 
Picture Butte. Very little equipment for physical education 
has been provided, probably due to the fact that there had been no 
space for indoor physical education until the recent provision 
of general purpose rooms and auditoria. In 1958 the School 
Board provided a small annual grant for this type of equip¬ 
ment which may ultimately remedy the present inadequacy.^ 

While this sketch gives a very incomplete picture of 
the school facilities in this area, it does show that the 
school authorities have succeeded fairly well in providing 
the special rooms and equipment needed in a moaern school. 

For example, of the eighty-one rooms listed in Table II, 
page 19, t¥renty~five are listed under General purpose. 
Laboratories, Shops, Home Economics rooms. Libraries, and 
Auditoria-gymnasia.

schools.

of classrooms operated in each school, and the grades and 
enrolments in each classroom. This information is summarized 
in Table 111, page 25. Although this table gives the grades 
and enrolments for a particular date, April 1, 1953, the 
organization of these schools has been fairly stable for tne 
past five or six years with tne following exceptions: 

1. The number of classrooms operated in Iron Springs was 
increased from six to seven in September, 1951. 

2. The number of classrooms operated at Barrhili was 
decreased from six to five in September, 1952, and 
again increased to six in September, 1953. 

3. The enrolments fluctuate somewhat from year zo 
year which occasionally necessitates changes in 
the grades assigned to certain rooms. 

4. The most notable exception to the general stability 
is in the number of classrooms operated at Picture 
Butte. This number has increased from thirteen in 
September, 1949, to nineteen in September, 1955. 

Of the seven schools, three offer instruction in 
Grades 1 to XII, usually two grades per room, and have 
rather small enrolments in the senior high school grades. 

Two schools offer instruction only up to Grade. Vlll and 
Grade IX respectively. The remaining two, the elementary

others and were, at least till 1955, continually expanding.

Iron Springs and Shaughnessy have had no nigh school 
grades for several years. High school students from these 
schools attend Picture Butte and Diamond City high schools 


respectively. 

3. Curricular Offerings of the High Schools in the 
Picture Butte Area 

High school instruction is offered in four schools in 
the area. Diamond City, Barrhili, Turin, and Picture Butte. 
The first three are classed as two-teacher high schools; that 
is, tvsTQ teachers give the instruction in Grades IX to XII. 
Although the Barrhili teaching staff was temporarily reduced 
in 1952-53 so that two teachers were giving instruction in 
Grades VII to XII, it normally has two teachers for Grades 
IX to XII. In addition to their two high school teachers, 
these schools have the services of part-time shop ana home 
economics teachers. These teachers travel from school to 
school and serve Grades VII, VIII, and IX as well as the 
high school grades. 

The number of courses offered, in terms of credits, 
in the two-roomed high schools is limited to ninety by 
regulation of the Department of Education. 1 To this number 
may be added the courses taught by the part-time teachers

of shop and home economics subjects. Thus, if four-credit 
courses in these subjects were given at both the Grade X 
and Grade XI levels, the total number of credits could be 
106. In practice, however, the total is usually between 
eighty and ninety-five. In Picture Butte, Y/here about 150 
credits are offered, there are four teachers, of whom one 
is the principal, for Grades X, XI and Xll.^ 

Table IV, page 26, shows the actual courses offered 
in the four high schools in the area for two recent years. 

It is the practice in small schools to alternate certain 
courses from year to year so that a greater total number of 
courses may be offered over a two or three year period. 

Thus, the programs of two consecutive years give a fairer 
picture of the courses offered than does the program of any 
one year. The variety of courses offered depends partly on 
the demand by the students, but also, to a considerable 
extent, on the qualifications of the teachers. This is because 
some courses, such as typewriting, bookkeeping, dramatics, and 
music, may be taught only by teachers with special certificates. 

The main feature of Table IV is the very limited range 
of courses, especially in the smaller schools at Diamond 
City, Barrhill, and Turin. This may be illustrated by 
taking as an example a student who enrolled in Grade X in 

1 picture Butte also has the services of part-time shop 
and home economics teachers, but instruction in these subjects 
in Grades X and XI is not offered each year.

Diamond City in 1951. If he took ail the courses available 
in Grade X he would have a total of thirty-six credits 
made up of: 


English 1 
Social Studies 1 

Health and Physical Education 1 
Geometry 1 
Physics 1 
Typewriting la 

Home Economics 1, or Farm and 
Home Mechanics 1 
Music 1, 

Assuming he was successful in meeting all prerequisite 
requirements and enrolled in all available Grade XI courses 
in 1952 he would have a total of thirty-five credits made 
up of: 

Farm and Home Mechanics 2 
Art 1 

Social Studies 2 
English 2 
Algebra 1 

Survey of English Literature 
Busriness Fundamentals. 

Again assuming he was successful, and assuming that the 

program offered in 1955 for Grade XII was the same as in 

1951, by taking all available courses he would have twenty- 

three credits as follows : 

Psychology 
English 3 
Social Studies 3 
Algebra 2 
Chemistry 2 . 

This would give him a total for the three years of ninety- 
four credits, six short of tne number required to earn a

high school diploma. However, it is likely that a Grade Xll 
five-credit course other tnan French 3 was offered in 1953 
in this school, and it is quite possible that a course such 
as Bookkeeping la or Dramatics 1, not offered in either of 
the two previous years, was given. This would have enabled the 
student to make up the necessary 100 credits. But, even tnougn 
he were successful in qualifying for the diploma, he would 
lack the general matriculation requirements of the University 
of Alberta. He might be able to qualify for matriculation by 
attending the Diamond City school another year provided the 
courses he needed were available; otherwise he would nave 
to take correspondence courses or attend another school. 

This student has had no choice of subjects in his three 
years of high school. Moreover, if he obtained a n C” 
standing in a subject such as Chemistry 1, which would give 
him credit for the course but would not permit him to proceed 
to Chemistry 2, he would not be able to qualify for a diploma 
without spending an extra year in high school and repeating 
the course. 

Picture Butte students are a little more fortunate, 
for they have some choice of subjects, and they can qualify 
for matriculation in three years. But those not interested 
in matriculation v/ould find it difficult to get a diploma 
without taking two or three science, mathematics, or language 
courses at the Grade Xll level.

This outline of the curricular offerings of the high 
schools of the Picture Butte area shows that at all four 
schools a student may obtain the high school diploma in three 
years. Matriculation standing may be obtained in three years 
in the Picture Butte school, but in the others four years would 
be required. The chief weakness of tne programs is that nearly 
all students are forced to take the same courses. Although 
courses such as typing, bookkeeping, and shop are offered, 
they are only one-year exploratory courses, and no year-to- 
year sequence is provided. Thus, all students, including those 
of Picture Butte, must take programs that are predominantly 
academic. 

4. Enrolment by Grades and by Schools in the 
Picture Butte Area 

The data for this analysis were taken from the Depart¬ 
ment of Education Attendance Form E502-2Q. This form is com¬ 
piled by each school at the end of June each year and shows 
the total number of pupils enrolled during the year with the 
exception of those who transfer to other schools in Alberta. 
Thus, it does not show the actual enrolment at the end of 
June since it includes pupils who left the Province, or who 
left school, during the school year. 

Table V, page 30, shows the total enrolments by grades 
for tiie schools at Turin, Diamond City, Barrhill, Iron Springs,

Shaughnessy, and Picture Butte for the past few years. The 
most evident features of this table are: 

1. The extreme fluctuations in the enrolments in the 
first three grades. These fluctuations may be largely 
accounted for by the transient immigrant population prev¬ 
iously described. 1 Immigrant children are usually placed 
in the first three grades regardless of their age and are 
subsequently accelerated according to their progress in 
English. Rather few immigrants are enrolled in Grades Vll, 
Vlll,and IX and very few in Grades X* XI,and Xll. 

2. A fairly steady increase in the enrolments in Grades 
IV, V,and VI. 

5. The very stable condition of the enrolments in Grades 
X, XI, and Xll. These enrolments are rather low relative to 
the totals. 

4. An increase of 118 pupils, or about 11 %, over the 
five year interval. 

Figure .4, page 32, is based on the dat a of 'Table V and 
illustrates the features just mentioned. Enrolments by grades,, 
for the years 1948, 1949* and 1950 ?/ere averaged and are 
shoY/n on the figure by Ihe black line. The averages for the 
last three years are shown by the red line. Evidently the 
over all increase of 118 pupils is mostly accounted for

by the increases in Grades II to VI inclusive. The graphs 
emphasize the rapid decline in enrolments after Graae VI 
and the stability of the enrolments in Grade X, XI and XII 
from year to year. It cannot be assumed from these data that 
the declining enrolments following Grade VI are entirely 
the result of pupils leaving school, but it is likely that 
this is a major cause. Although this investigation is con- 
cerned primarily with the senior nigh school,, it is pointed 
out that the weakness in holding power of Grades VII, Vlll 
and IX presents a serious problem. 

The enrolments by schools for the same period are 
shown in Table VI.

Although this table shows marked fluctuations from 
year to year in all schools, no trends are evident except in 
Picture Butte. Tne rather large increase in Picture Butte 
in 1950 and the decrease in Iron Springs the same year is 
partly accounted for by the fact that the high school stuaents 
from Iron Springs, about twenty in number, were transferred to 
Picture Butte. About the same number of stuaents from Iron Sp¬ 
rings have attended at Picture Butte since that time. Making 
allowance for these students from Iron Springs, the net increas 
in Picture Butte is about 110 for the five year period. This 
is almost equal to the increase over the whole area under consid 
eration.^ Some increase in enrolment is shown in Iron Springs 
when the loss of its high school students is taken into consider 
ation; but it appears that the school population of the area, 
with the exception of Picture Butte, is quite stable. 

The relatively low enrolment in Grades X, XI, and Xli in 
tne schools of the Picture Butte area is shown in Table Vil, 
page 55. The high school enrolments are given as percent¬ 
ages of the total enrolments for the Picture Butte area, 
Lethbridge City, and the Province as a whole. The per¬ 
centages show a fairly steady decline in all cases, due, 
no doubt, to the increase in the birth rate in Alberta during 

^ This could be expected as it was shown on page 10 
that the population of the Village of Picture Butte had 
increased much more rapidly than that of the surrounding 
area between 1946 and 1951.

and since World War II with the consequent greater increase 
in the enrolments in the elementary grades. The proportion 
of students in high school was lower in the Picture Butte 
area than in the City of Lethbridge and about the same as 
for the Province as a vdiole. It could be expected that 
this proportion would be higher for the Picture Butte area 
than for the Province as a Yfhole since in this area a high 
school is conveniently accessible to every student, whereas 
this is not the case over the whole province. 

This rather low proportion of students in the high 
school grades in this area indicates a weakness in the 
holding power of the schools. A further analysis of this 
will be made in the next section. 

5. Humber of People of High School Age Who Are Not in School 

Direct data on the number of people of nigh school 
age who were not in school were not available. An estimate 
was made, however, by inference from Table V, page 30. 
Students who left school before Grade IX and those who failed 
to qualify for the Grade IX diploma 'were disregarded, thus 
limiting this analysis to those who were eligible to 
enter high school. The average number of students in Grade 
IX in all the schools of the area for the past six years 
iras seventy. Assuming that the same proportion qualified 
for Grade IX diplomas in this area as for the Province ass

a whole, (about 90 % according to the Annual Reports of the 
Department of Education), there could have been sixty-three 
students enrolling in Grade X each year; and, if each remained 
in school for three years, the average total high school 
enrolment would, have been 189. The actual average enrolment 
in Grades X, XI, and XI1 in the schools of the area, calculated 
from Table V, was 145. Thus, of 189 who w T ere eligible for 
high school forty-four, or about 23%, were not enrolled. 

The percentage of those eligible who were not attending at 
any given time was actually higher than this for two reasons. 
First, the figures of Table V, on which the estimate was 
based, include students who dropped out during the school 
year. Second, some students spent a second year in Grade 
Xll. This fact was disregarded in making the estimate. It 
was assumed that the number of students leaving the area was 
equal to the number entering from other districts. 

Another approach to the study of the number of people 
of high school age who are not in school ?/as made by analyzing 
the individual attendance records of a selected group of 
students through high school. The group selected consisted 
of the students who enrolled in Grade X in each of the years 
1948, 1949 ? and 1950 in the Picture Butte High School. The 
data are summarized in Table Vlll, page 58. Of the total of 
eighty-seven who enrolled in Grade X over the three years, 
ten left the district before spending three years in high

school and no further information was available about tnem. 

Of the remaining seventy-seven students, thirty-one left be¬ 
fore spending three years in high school. This is a drop¬ 
out rate of about 40$. The drop-out rates for the different 
grades as calculated from the figures in the total column 
of Table VIII, page 58, were as follows: 14 % during or at 
the end of Grade X, 2‘3% during or at the end of Grade XI, 
and IQjS during Grade XII. Thus the greatest drop-out rate 
occurred during or at the end of Grade XI. 

The total high school enrolment for all schools in 
the area was quite stable as shown in Table V, page 50. Also 
about half the high school enrolment was in picture Butte, 
which was the source of the sample. Therefore, it may be 
inferred that the drop-out rate of 40^ determined for the 
selected sample applied to the area generally. 

6. Number of Students Completing Grade XII 

On the basis of the drop-out rate determined in the 
preceding section, only about 60% of the students who enrolled 
in Grade X in the Picture Butte area spent three or more 
years in high school. But even of these, relatively few 
qualified for the high school diploma in any given year. 

Table IX, page 40, shof^s that the average number of diplomas 
earned annually in the area during the past five years was 
eighteen. This number is only about 41/6 of the average

Taber High School 1951 to 1955 ... 59 


Some caution must be observed in the interpretation of 
these figures. The percentages are based on the total Grade 
Xll enrolments. But some students spent two years in Grade 
Xll, qualifying for the diploma at the end of their second 
year. Others spent an extra year in Grade Xll, after qualify¬ 
ing for the diploma, in order to raise a mark or take an extra 
course for matriculation purposes. * 2 * 4 5 Eviaently the percentages 

of students enrolled in Grade X^l who ultimately received 
diplomas 'would be somewhat higher than those given above. 

It may be assumed, however, that the effect of these 
factors would be about the same for the Picture Butte area

schools.ss for the others. Thus, it may be concluded that 
the percentage of the Grade XII enrolment who received 
diplomas in the Picture Butte area was about 20% lower thaft 
in the Lethbridge, Red Deer, and Taber schools. 

The following factors may partly account for the 
superiority of the latter group of schools in respect to 
percentage of graduates. Most of the students of the 
Lethbridge schools have their homes in the city; consequ¬ 
ently their attendance is not much affected by conditions 
of the weather and the roads, or by problems of husbandry. 

It may be assumed that the Grade XII class at Red Deer is 
rather selected since it is the largest class in the school 
and includes a number of students who come from consider¬ 
able distances. Most of these students are attempting to 
complete a matriculation program. The use of a semester system 
by the Red Deer school also makes comparisons, difficult.- 
But the main difference between the two groups of schools 
is that those of Lethbridge, Red Deer, and Taber are larger 
and offer much more diversified programs than the Picture 
Butte area schools. It is possible that this is the major 
factor accounting for the difference in the percentage of 
graduates between the two groups. 

^ These difficulties in making comparisons with the 
Red Deer Composite High School were suggested by Mr. Dandell 
in a letter to the writer.

7• Reasons for Students Leaving School 

An attempt was made to determine the reasons for the 
rather high drop-out rate in the high schools of the Picture 
Butte area hut precise information was not available* The 
most common reasons given by the principals of the schools 
were: "lack of interest” and "not academic". Thus the most 

important reasons would seem to be those related to the 
school. This agrees with the findings of the c ana dian 
Research committee on Practical Education.^ It is doubtful 
that many students leave school in the Picture butte area 
because of economic necessity; although, in this area where 
nearly half of the high school students live on farms, some 
may be required at home in husbandry. Moreover, many of the 
students from the farms have to stay out of school for a 
period of from three to five weeks during the beet harvest. 

The result is that such students are left so far behind in 
their school work that some become discouraged and leave 
school. Table A, page 44, shows the immediate post-school 
record of the thirty-one students shown in Table VIII, page 38, 
who left school before spending three years in high school. 

The fact that ten of these students were at home on farms 
lends some support to the assumption that same of the students

in this area leave school because of economic necessity. The 
relatively large number of girls who went to business colleges 
indicates that the Picture ^utte school might well offer 
more courses in line with these interests. All but five of 
the thirty-one students shown in Table X attended one or 
more courses given by the writer in the Picture Butte High 
School. learly all of these students were below the average 
for the school in their achievement. From this it is inferred 
that their reasons for dropping out are mostly related to 
the school; that is, either the methods of instruction used 
or the courses offered were not suited to the interests and 
abilities of these students. 

8. Performance of Students in Academic 
and Mon-academic courses 

to investigate the suitability of courses to the 
interests and abilities of the students a comparison was 
made of the performances of certain students in the two 
types of courses, academic and non-academic. The students 
selected for this comparison were all the G-rade X and XI 
students of the Picture ^utte nigh School for the years 
1949-50, 1950-51, 1951-52. The academic subjects considered 
were: Algebra 1, Physics 1, (Geometry 1, uhemistry 1, and 
French 1 and 2. The non-academic subjects considered were: 
Bookkeeping la, Art 1, Typewriting la, ieedlework, Home

Economics 1, Farm and Home Mechanics 1, and Dramatics 1. 
These non-academic subjects involve relatively little study 
of textbooks and are to a large extent manual skills. At 
the end of June each year the teachers of both the academic 
and non-academic subjects grade their students according to 
the following categories: n H fr * ,T A f? , ft B w , !l C !r , 11 D n . In the 
non-academic courses a grading of fl C ft or U D is a failure. 

In the academic courses a grading of "D ff Is a failure but 
a grading of u C tf is only a partial failure; that is, the 
student obtains credit for the course but is not permitted 
to proceed to the next higher course in that subject. 

Table XI, page 47, shows the distribution of the 
gradings of the selected group of students for each type of 
course. The students generally were more successful with 
the non-academic courses: they received higher gradings and 
there were fewer failures. This, of course, is probably 
true of the Province as a whole.^ The percentage of failure 
In the academic subjects was actually higher than Table XI 
shows, for students frequently enrolled in courses which 

■** Since 1953 the Regulations of the Department of 
Education have permitted a student to proceed to the Grade 
XI course of a subject with a "C” grading in the Grade X 
course, but he is not permitted to proceed to the Grade XII 
course of a subject without at least n B' ff standing in the 
Grade XI course.

they dropped before the end of June while this table shows 
the results for only those which were continued to the end 
of the school year. This dropping of courses is confined 
almost wholly to the academic ones. Although the percentage 
of failures, ,f D fl gradings, in the academic subjects was not 
extremely large, there was a fairly high percentage of 
partial failures, u C n gradings. Since this grading does 
not confer the privilege of proceeding to the next higher 
course in a certain subject, a student with two or three 
such gradings would find it almost impossible to complete 
the requirements for a diploma in his third year because 
he would be barred from certain Grade XII academic courses; 
and, in a small school, there would not be enough other 
courses for him to choose. 

Further evidence of the higher gradings obtained by 
students generally in the non-academic courses is shown in 
Table XII, page 47, which shows the performance of the 1951-52 
Grade XI class of the Picture Butte High School. This cla.ss 
was chosen as an example because the total number of gradings 
in the non-academic courses was about the same as in the 
academic ones. Usually there is a preponderance of the 
academic courses. The courses of this type available to 
this class were: Algebra 1, Chemistry 1,and French 2. The 
non-academic courses were: Art 1, Bookkeeping la. Home 
Economics 1, Farm and Home Mechanics 1, and Typewriting la.

In the academic courses there were 25% failures or partial 
failures whereas there were no failures in the non-academic 
c our s e s. 

The difference in the actual performance of students 
in the two types of courses may not be as great as Tables XI 
and XII indicate. Since the academic subjects are tested by 
the Departmental Examinations in Grade XII, a higher standard 
may be maintained in these subjects in Grades X and XI. Also 
there is no sequence in the non-academic courses offered; they 
are mostly of an introductory or exploratory nature. For these 
reasons teachers would be often inclined to give a student a 
passing grade for attitude and effort rather than for actual 
achievement. But in assigning grades in the academic courses 
teachers would be likely to keep in mind the minimum standard 
of achievement necessary for attempting the next higher course 
in the subject. However, even if these precautions in 
interpreting the data of Tables XI and XII are observed, it 
still appears that students who fail in the academic stibjects 
might be better served by more non-academic subjects. The 
weakness of the programs in these small high schools is that 
no sequence of courses is provided in such subjects. Two or 
three successive courses in subjects such as Art or Bookkeep¬ 
ing would present a greater challenge to the students, and, 
if completed, would probably be a worthwhile achievement.

9, Summary of the Educational Services and leeds 
of the Picture nutte Area 

high schools were provided at xurin, xarrhill, ificture 
nutte, and diamond ^ity. xhe extensive bus service enabled 
all students in the area to reach one of these schools, The 
schools were generally well equipped for the courses they 
offered and were staffed with well qualified teachers.^ In 
the three smaller schools urade IX was combined with the high 
school, with two teachers giving the instruction in the four 
grades. The staffs of all the schools were supplemented by 
part-time teachers of shop and home economics. 

The high school programs of all the schools were very 
limited in scope. Students were restricted to programs 
containing a substantial number of the traditional academic 
courses in mathematics, science, and languages, nevertheless 
students could not qualify for university matriculation 
within three years except in Picture .butte. In all schools 
some non-academic subjects such as typewriting, shop, art, 
dramatics, and home economics were offered; but, as no sequence 
was provided, students could not plan their programs around a 
core of these subjects. 

The enrolments in the high school grades varied little 

^ Since 1948 nearly all the high school teachers in 
the area were experienced teachers with university degrees.

from year to year. In the three smaller schools, JBarrhill, 
Turin, and Diamond City, the high school classes were very 
small. Although an increase in enrolment in the Picture 
Butte elementary grades was evident, this had had no effect, 
at least till 1953, on the high school enrolment. The 
high school enrolment was relatively small, averaging only 
12.8% of the total for all grades since 1948. It was 
estimated that of young people eligible to be in high school 
only about 77% were enrolled in any one year. The proportion 
in actual attendance was less than this since students 
dropped out during, as well as at the end of, a school year. 
The drop-out rate of students from Grade X to Grade XII, as 
shown by a sample from Picture Butte, was about 40%. 

In spite of this high drop-out rate, the students 
remaining In high school three years or more were not very 
successful. Less than half of them qualified for the high 
school diploma. An average of eighteen high school graduates 
a year In a school system, elementary and high, of nearly 
1200 pupils appears to be very low. 

The programs of these high schools made very little 
provision for differences in aptitudes and Interests among 
their students. The core of these programs was the academic 
course originally Intended for the few who were preparing 

for higher education. But to-day it Is expected that all 

( 

young people should have the advantage of high school

education.'** The Annual Reports of the Department of Education 
show the following percentages of successful candidates in 
the Grade IX Departmental Examinations:

Thus it appears that a large, and increasing, percentage of 
Grade IX students is being admitted to high school. It is 
not likely that all of the large number of students who 
succeed in Grade IX are academically Inclined. Therefore, 
the high school should make some provision for those who are 
not. 

A diversified high school program is proposed as a 
solution to the problem of providing for the needs of 
students who are not academically Inclined. Findings from 
this survey which indicate the usefulness of such a program 
are: 

1. The better performance, in terms of the proportion 
of students graduating, of Lethbridge City, Red Deer 
Composite, and Taba?schools where such programs are 
offered. 

2. The better performance- of Picture Butte students in 
non-academic subjects than in academic ones, (showing 


This point of view will be discussed further In

that some students who cannot succeed in academic 
courses can do satisfactory work in the non-academic 
fields). 

3. The fairly large number of students who dropped out 
of school, to take business training or to work on 
farms as shown by their post school records (showing 
that practical courses in these fields would fill a 
need) . 

Dr. Mar tor ana, who made a survey for a Community 

College in Lethbridge, stated: 

The sizable drop-out rate which is now prevalent in the 
secondary grades represents a loss to general society. 
There is little argument against the proposition that 
the material and cultural productivity of a society is 
directly related to the level of education achieved by 
the individuals in that society. For this reason the 
fact that there is a sizable proportion of students who 
drop out of school somewhere between Grade IX and Grade 
XII should be a matter of concern. 


Such a student mortality rate suggests the need for 
expansion in the curriculum at the secondary level so 
that more advantage is made of the interests and aptitudes 
of all the youth who attend at this level. In this regard 
a special mention should be made of the progress which has 
been made already in the Lethbridge Collegiate Institute 
in the provision of curriculums in home-making, commerce, 
shop, and industrial arts. These programs should be 
continued and strengthened. ... a curriculum in voca¬ 
tional agriculture may well be justified. ... a program 
in retail salesmanship or in distri.butive education would 
be fitting. . . 

Through the strengthening and addition of such non¬ 
university-transfer currieulums, therefore, there can be 
developed a program of offerings which has both the appeal 
of personal interest and that of occupational outlet to 
the non-university-preparatory student. As a result, 
a higher proportion of students would persist in attendance

in the secondary grades; the holding power of the 
secondary schools would be improved, and the local and 
general society would profit by it.^ 


Some general considerations relating to diversified 
high school programs will be outlined in the next chapter.

CHAPTER ill 


COMPOSITE HIGH SCHOOLS 

1. The Need for Diversity in the High School Program 

The limitations of the small nigh schools illustrated 
in Chapter II are not confined to the Picture Butte area. 
The drop-out rate of students has attracted the atten¬ 
tion of laymen and educators to the objectives and the 
curricula of the secondary schools. The Canadian Research 
Committee on Practical Education set up by the Canadian 
Education Association in 1947 carried out, over a period 
of four years, an investigation into "what constitutes a 
suitable secondary school education for students who go 
directly to employment from school* 1 . 1 The Committee pub¬ 


lished four reports. Bp earning of the Committee*s second 

report, "Your Child Leaves School", J. G. Althouse stated: 

Two features of the report are so prominent, however, 
that I offer no apology for bringing them to your no¬ 
tice. The first is that, of all Canadian children who 
pass through Grade VII, 59 % of the boys and 51 % of the 
girls leave school without finishing the courses they 
have begun — they leave with a record of failure to 
accomplish what they have undertaken. The second is 
that the majority of these boys and girls give as the 
cause of their dropping out reasons which are within 
the power of the school system to correct, or at least 
to amend. The report remarks: "The school can increase 
retention by improving its curriculum and instruction.

and by guiding students into courses suited to their 
abilities, aptitudes and interest." ^ 

Among the conclusions reached in a recent investig¬ 
ation of the causes of high school drop-outs in southern 
Alberta were these: 

Three-quarters of the drop-outs changed their vocat¬ 
ional plans while in high school. The changes were 
all from matriculation courses to technical or commerc¬ 
ial courses. In these fields there was a shortage of 
courses, therefore they left school. 


Only 20 % of the pupils who graduate want to go on 
to higher learning institutions. The others want to 
go to work. The academic curriculum under which these 
students were trained did not, apparently, meet the 
needs of the majority of the pupils. It Is this lack 
of practical courses that causes many pupils, who 
might otherwise have remained in school, to drop out. 

There Is widespread agreement that the high schools 
are for all young people and that the schools must provide 
a diversity of courses to meet the needs of such a relative¬ 
ly unselected group. Some statements of this point of view 
follow. In 1949, the Chief Director of Education for 
Ontario wrote: 

Clearly secondary schools can no longer confine them¬ 
selves to the training of selected brains for profes¬ 
sional service; they must seek to give all our young 
people something that will be of specific use to each.^

A former superintendent of Calgary schools, report¬ 
ing the findings of a committee set up to study the aims of 
high school education to-day, stated, in part: 

This committee agreed that the responsibilities of to-day ! s 
high school are: 

1. To be concerned primarily with the needs of the 
majority of its students, that is, the large group v/ho 
will not go to University. 

This does not mean that matriculation subjects will 
not be taught thoroughly and efficiently for the small 
group who plan on university edudation .... The emphasis 
will fall, however, on providing for the majority a general 
education, that is, a selection of subjects that will meet 
the varied needs of young people and prepare them for 
efficient living as individuals and as citizens. 

2. To provide adequate accommodation and equipment to 
give modern courses in general and vocational education 
for both boys and girls. ^ 

The first of a list of recommendations made by a 

conference arranged by the United States Commissioner of 

Education to discuss the question of high school drop-outs 

and what educators can d.o about them was, ^diversify the 

program by providing experiences that meet the general and 

special education needs, interests and abilities of all 
2 

students. 

Among the recommendations made by the Canadian 
Research Committee on Practical Education were the follow¬

8. That schools offer a variety of courses to suit the 
varied interests and aptitudes of the pupils and 
make provision for the ready transfer from one course 
to another. 

35. That home economics be offered in all secondary 
schools and that more girls be encouraged to en¬ 
roll in these courses. 

36. That courses in business education be extended to 
include training for workers in the distributive 
trades as well as for office workers. 

37. That courses in industrial arts be offered in all 
secondary schools and include, where required, 
specialized courses designed to develop specific 
skills needed in industry. 

38. That agriculture be offered in all secondary schools 
in rural areas and include, where possible, pract¬ 
ical courses such as farm mechanics, farm manage¬ 
ment, soil conservation, and market ing. 

The Director, Faculty of Education, Calgary, in a 
magazine article stated: 

Our Alberta high schools must continue to prepare 
students for liberal arts and professional programs 
offered by otir peopled university. High school 
standards must not be relaxed. However, bi-lateral 
or multi-lateral tracks must be provided for youth of 
varying abilities and interests including many students 
of high ability whether or not they go to university.^ 

The principle of diversity in the high school program 

is advocated by the Alberta Department of Education: 

The school should be organized to meet the needs of 
all educable youth until thejr are eighteen years of age. 
This means that the secondary school should make a 
determined effort to provide both for the academically 
minded student preparing for university entrance, and 
for the much larger group who, though intending to 
go into farming, business, or industry, would never¬ 
theless profit from several additional years of school¬ 
ing. Matriculation requirements must not hinder the

development of a curriculum sufficiently flexible to 
provide for the needs of the non-matriculants. 


The foregoing implies that the secondary school 
[should] be organized to furnish socially approved 
programs of a multi-track nature suited to the varied 
needs, backgrounds, preferences and abilities of all 
Alberta youth. Our past experience has proven that 
the non-matriculant [non-matriculants] cannot be cared 
for under the various matriculation patterns but will 
require programs suited to their own individual needs. 
Young people vary tremendously in their stud_y persuits, 
in terms of their backgrounds, preferences, needs and 
previous experience, as well as their ability. Some 
are satisfied with the academic program leading to 
university matriculation. Many are much more interested 
in preparing themselves for farming, hememaking, business, 
secretarial work, art, industrial employment and other 
activities of a vocational and cultural nature. 

University matriculation and professional training 
should appeal only to the few since professional 
opportunities are strictly limited and indeed carry 
no assured superiority other than in a traditional 
sense over the varied activities suggested above. We 
have weakened our high school in recent years in endeav¬ 
oring to force all into the severe academic pattern 
of university matriculation. As a matter of fact 
the young people who leave high school in such 
numbers cannot be retained until they are provided 
courses consistent with their interests and ambitions. 

If we believe there is value in retaining these young 
people In the schools for a year or two longer, whether 
for vocational, cultural, or economic advantage, or for 
improvement in quality of citizenship, we must provide 
the variety of offerings which a multi-track program 
alone possesses. 

The authorities quoted above all suggest that the 
traditional academic high school does not satisfactorily serve 
the needs of all the young people of high school age. The 
main evidence supporting this view appears to be that there is 
a high drop-out rate among high school students. These

authorities also imply that the high school should provide 
for all educable youth and that this can be done by adapt¬ 
ing the curriculum to their needs and interests. The next 
section summarizes the attempts made by some schools to pro¬ 


vide broadened curricula. 


2. Attempts to Implement a Diversified Program 


In many parts of Canada and the United States cur¬ 
ricula have been set up to implement the point of view 
just described. One author describes schools in several 
small communities in the United States in which a 
curriculum has been developed based on the immediate needs 
and interests of the community. 1 In the rural areas of 
Ontario, centralized high schools, in which agricultural 
subjects are emphasized, have been established. An 
example is the Haliburton District High School, Haliburton, 
Ontario. 


The Haliburton District is new and covers the area 
between Minden and Dorset, a distance of some thirty 
miles. Pupils are transported by bus throughout the 
area.. . The present attendance is 280 pupils . . . 

The present school contains the following accommodation: 
four classrooms, one library, one art room, one commer¬ 
cial room, one agriculture room, one home economics 
room, one cafeteria and kitchen, one shop, one 
gymnasium-auditorium, and administrative offices. 

From the above summary it will be seen tnat the scxiool

provides the full range ^ of academic and vocational 
subjects of the modern composite high school .... 

As the Haliburton area is essentially rural in 
character, agricultural science is stressed . . . . ^ 

The extent of the movement to establish such schools 
in Ontario and its success is summarized by Althouse: 

Five years ago, a small group of schpoiLs in rural 
centres was meeting with success in its effort to 
relate their courses more closely with the agricultural 
interest of most of their pupils. Efforts to extend 
this sort of experimentation revealed two things — 
they revealed a prompt public interest in the movement, 
and they showed that only schools with a fairly high 
enrolment could combine the practical agriculture 
course with the more traditional offerings of the 
schools. The first resu.lt was unprecedented activity 
among county councils to enlarge high school areas 
to make such schools possible; . . . one hundred 
twenty-three of these districts have been formed in 
five years. The second result was the construction 
of many fine, new buildings, specially adapted to the 
enriched course. These buildings present a wide range 
of size and elaboration . . . AH of these, however, 
whatever their size or cost, are alike in one respect; 
they represent a deliberate effort to make secondary 
education more attractive and more retentive by 
incorporating into the curriculum elements of immediate 
interest and practical importance to the pupils in the 
communities in which they live . . . 

By far the most convincing evidence of the effect¬ 
iveness of curriculum revision as one answer to the 
secondary school problem is the response of the rural 
people to this reorganization of their high schools. 
Five years ago, there were 27,000 boys and girls frcm 
rural Ontario attending secondary schools; last year 
there were 38,000. Please remember that, although 
Ontario*s population has shown substantial growth in 
those five years, that growth hasnot been in the rural 
population. More that one quarter of the. rural 
children of high school age in Ontario who are now 


^ The expression tT full range 51 seems to be used 
loosely here. However, the school does appear to provide 
facilities for some courses in all the fields of the 
n five-sided 51 composite high school.

seeking a high school education would not have been 
attracted by the courses offered five years ago. This 
fact, I suggest, indicates that the laymen of rural 
Ontario have defined secondary education in terms of 
more attractive subject matter, and they like this 
definition. 

As a matter of fact, there is mounting evidence 
that a similar definition of secondary education is 
rapidly approaching the proportions of a peremptory 
demand right across Canada, and is not restricted to the 
rural areas. 

In Alberta, high schools offering a diversified 
program are frequently called B composite” high schools. 

The following statements from a publication of the Alberta 
Department of Education describe these schools and imply 
a definition of the term "composite”. 

In Alberta the need has become apparent for more 
high schools which will provide a wide variety of 
academic courses and also in the same institutions 
make more extensive provision for prevocational 
training. The effort to meet these needs has led to 
the organization of the composite senior school, 
offering courses adapted to the needs of those 
students who hope to proceed to college as well as 
courses particularly suitable to those who wish to 
secure employment in business, farming, or the trades 
and crafts, or become homemakers. 


A complete five-sided program of a composite high 
school included in addition to the obligatory subjects 
of Phglish, Social Studies, Health and Personal 
Development and Physical Education, courses grouped 
amder the general headings of College Preparatory, 
Commercial, Agriculture, Industrial Arts or Technical, 
and Home Economics. Each student’s individual program 
is composed of subjects selected from the whole

offering with a particular departmental grouping of 
subjects given more prominence than tne others.i 

It is only in some of the cities of Alberta that 

the above criterion of the "complete five-siaed program” 

has been met. However, one of these schools is operated 

by the Red Deer School Division, a division that is mainly 

rural. Although the school is located at Red Deer, it 

serves a large number of students from the rural areas as 

well as those from the city of Red Deer. Several other 

smaller schools have programs representing a partial 

development of the "composite"plan. Examples are: 

Athabasca 150 students, 8 teachers (1951) % 

Cardston 155 " 7 « (1951) % 

Taber 200 « 14 " (1955) 

Sedgewick 131 " 8 " (1953) 1 * * 4 

In these schools the "college preparatory" or 
academic field still receives the greatest emphasis, but, 
in each case, at least one other "side" of the composite 
program has been developed to a considerable extent. For 
example, at Sedgewick five courses are offered in each of 
the fields. Commercial, Technical, and Home Economics.*

Although well developed IT five-sided" composite high 
schools are not common, the program of almost every high 
school in Alberta represents to some extent the application 
of the composite principle, in that all include compulsory 
or core subjects, selected academic subjects, ana one or 
more of the general elective subjects. 1 The point here is 
that the principle of diversity in the curriculum seems to 
be generally accepted in Alberta. However, as Is pointed 
out in Chapter II, the inclusion of an exploratory coarse 
or two in the non-academic fields, while serving a useful 
purpose, does not meet the needs of the students whose 
main interests are in those fields. 

3. Factors to Consider in Proposing a Composite 
High School in a Rural Area 

It may be inferred from the foregoing that a fairly 
large number of students is necessary for even a partial 
implementation of a composite plan. Of the Alberta schools 
which are described as completely composite, the largest 
have over one thousand students, while the smallest. Red Deer 
and Medicine Hat, have over five hundred. Evidently an 
extremely large rural area would be needed to provide

several hundred high school students. To illustrate — the 
high school enrolment in the whole of the Lethbridge School 
Division, a large part of which is in one of the most 
densely populated rural areas of the Province, was only 
about 450 in 1953. ^ Thus something less than a complete 
five-sided program will have to suffice, at least as a 
starting point. The reference to the schools at Taber, 
Athabasca, Cardston, and Sedgewiek shows that a partial 
composite plan is possible with an enrolment of from 130 
to 200 students. It may be assumed from this that the 
minimum number of students necessary to warrant a worth¬ 
while expansion of a high school program is about 130. 
However, to make up even this number in a rural district 
would necessitate the gathering of students from a rather 
large area. Thus a major factor in determining the 
advisability of establishing a composite high school is 
the feasibility of gathering such a number of students 
either by daily transportation or by the provision of 
dormitories. 

Although it is difficult, or impossible, to gather 
enough students to form a complete composite high school 
in a rural area, the need for a diversified program is 
probably just as great as in the larger centres of populat¬ 
ion. Differences in ability among rural students are.

no doubt, as great as among city students; and, although 
city students may show a greater diversity of interests, 
this is probably because of the greater variety of their 
observations and experiences. Mreover, large numbers of young 
people from the rural areas go to the cities to work, where, 
as a result of the limitations of their schooling and other 
experience, they are at a disadvantage in comparison 
with the young people of the cities. The latter have, 
in addition to the more diversified programs of the 
public high schools, the advantages of technical schools, 
trade schools, business colleges, apprenticeship opportun¬ 
ities, and part-time job experiences, practically all of 
which are not available to the young people of the rural 
areas. For these reasons it may be desirable for schools 
in such areas to expand their high school programs even 
though an optimum number of students is not available. 

This relatively greater need for diversity in rural schools 
is a second factor to be considered in determining the 
advisability of establishing a composite high school. 

A third consideration is the teaching staff —• the 
number of teachers needed and their qualifications. It 
is noticeable that In composite high schools the number 
of teachers is rather high In relation to the number of 
students. In the schools listed on page 63 the number 
of students per teacher varies from fourteen to twenty-two.

Even in the larger composite schools such as Red Deer and 
Medinine Hat the number of students per teacher is only 
about twenty.**- Thus, although a composite school may 
be formed by combining the enrolments of a number of small 
schools, it cannot be assumed that a reduction in the tbtal 
number of teachers will follow. Moreover, specially qualified 
teachers are required for subjects such as shop and commercial 
work. By regulation of the Department of Education such 
teachers require special certificates in addition to a 
general teaching certificate. 2 

A fourth consideration is the availability of 
buildings and equipment. Hot only are classrooms required 
for the large number of students to be assembled at one 
centre, but also special rooms with suitable equipment are 
needed for certain subjects. Examples are: for commercial 
work, a room with tables and typewriters; for dramatics, 
a stage; for woodwork or automotives, a specially equipped 
shop. Evidently the number and kind of rooms required 
depends partly on the total number of students and partly 
on the direction ■which the expansion of the program takes. 

This direction of the expansion of the program is 
the fifth consideration. Ideally the courses offered

should depend on the needs. Interests and abilities of the 
students. These, however, do not seem to be Immediately 
capable of very accurate determination. Therefore the 
experience of other schools and practical considerations 
of space and equipment will largely determine the initial 
offering of courses. A high school with an enrolment of 
130 to 200 students would, no doubt, continue to offer a 
fairly complete selection of the academic or matriculation 
courses. In some Alberta schools in which the composite 
plan has been implemented, wholly or partially, the field 
which attracts the largest numbers, next to the academic, 
is the commercial.' 1 ’ Expansion in this field satisfies 
the criterion of practinability since one room provided 
with typewriters, tables and chairs, would be adequate for 
an offering of up to eight five-credit courses in commer¬ 
cial subjects, of the remaining fields, technical, home 
economics, and practical agriculture, it might be assumed 
that In a rural area practical agriculture would be popu¬ 
lar. This does not seem to be the case. Even at Red Deer 
with its excellent facilities and fairly large enrolment 

of rural students, the enrolments in courses in practical 

2 

agriculture are very low. In view of this situation

and of the considerable extra equipment required for these 
courses, they probably should not be included in the first 
stages of the implementation of the composite plan unless 
there is strong local support for them. The technical and 
home economics fields are both popular. Most students are 
familiar with the nature of these since exploratory or 
general courses in these subjects have been offered for 
several years in a large number of Alberta schools in the 
intermediate grades as well as in the high school. Whether 
expansion in these fields is advisable depends on the number 
of students available. If commercial courses are offered, 
it is possible that these would attract such a large number 
of girls that not enough would be left to warrant expansion 
in the home economics field. As the commercial courses do 
not attract as many boys as they do girls, there probably 
would be sufficient demand to warrant the offering of 
some technical courses.^ 

In the following chapters an attempt will be made to 
outline a composite-type program for a high school in 
the Picture Butte area and to show how it can be Implemented. 
As the present high school program of the Alberta Department 
of Education provides enough courses for a fairly complete 
five-sided composite school, this outline is confined to 
courses selected from that program.

CHAPTER IV 


A SUGGESTED PLAN FOR A DIVERSIFIED HIGH SCHO L PROGRAM 
FOR THE PICTURE BUTTE AREA 

The survey in Chapter II indicated that the small high 
schools in the Picture Butte area did not adequately meet the 
needs of a large number of people of high school age. In 
Chapter III were outlined some of the characteristics of 
composite-type high schools which, through a more diversified 
program, attempt tp provide for the variety of interests and 
aptitudes of the present day high school population. The 
purpose of this chapter is to outline a program for that type 
of school for the Picture Butte area. 

To establish such a school it is proposed to eliminate 
the three smaller high schools at Diamond City, Barrhill, and 
Turin, and to transport the high school students from those 
schools to Picture Butte. The program to be outlined for this 
school will provide a fairly complete offering of courses in 
the academic subjects for matriculation purposes and also a 
sequence of courses in the commercial and technical fields. 
Enough courses will be included in these two fields so that 
a student may plan his high school program around a core of 
courses in one of them. Of the considerations mentioned in 
the last part of Chapter III, the following are taken into 
account here. First, the proposed program should meet the

needs of the people of high school age better than the exist¬ 
ing programs. Second, it should be practical in view of the 
expected enrolment. Third, the program should not require 
a great extension of existing facilities, at least in its 
initial stages. The remaining considerations will be dealt 
with in subsequent chapters. 

1. The Location 

Picture Butte is the logical location for a centralized 
high school offering a diversified program because: 

1. It is central to the area, and even if the high schools 
to the west, Nobleford and Coalhurst, were untimately 
included, it virould still be fairly central. 

2. It is the largest centre of population in the area. Its 
school population is nearly half of the total of the 
six schools under consideration, and its high school 
population is more than half of the total in the area. 

3. The high school building in Picture Butte, completed 
in 1950 and extended in 1952, is well suited for the 
projected program. 

2. Picture Butte High School Facilities 

The school is of brick, two stories high. It has no 
basement except in the east end to house the furnace and 
boiler. Figure 5, page 72, is a rough plan of the building.

The auditorium, exclusive of the stage area, is sixty feet 
long by forty feet wide. It is provided with basketball 
goals, the one at the stage end being removable. The stage 
is partly equipped for dramatics. For seating there are 
one hundred folding metal chairs, and planks and supports 
capable of seating about 150 more. 

The classrooms are all of standard size, about thirty- 
two feet by twenty-two feet. In 1952-53, Classroom 1 was 
used as a music room and moving picture projection room. 
Classroom 8, containing chairs and tables and eighteen type¬ 
writers, was used, as a typing room. The remaining eight 
classrooms were in use as home rooms as follows:^

The laboratory is the same size as a classroom. It 
contains six students* tables each about four feet by six 


In 1953-54 there were two Grade 6 classes. Classroom 
1, the music room, was used as a homeroom for the extra class. 
Music and.film showings were given on the stage of the audi¬ 
torium. v’/ith the completion of the new elementary school 
referred to on page 20, Grade 6 will no longer be housed in 
the high school building, thus releasing two classrooms. But 
it is quite possible that in a year or two Grade 8 will 
require two homerooms. Hence the use of rooms In the immediate 
future will be the same as In 1952-53 except that classroom 
4 will be uded for Grade 8 instead of for Grade 6.

feet covered with a non-corroding material. Each table is 
provided with hot and cold running water and good-sized 
cupboards and drawers. There is a demonstration table about 
three feet by fourteen feet similar in construction to the 
students 1 tables. There is a good fume cupboard with suction 
fan. For supplies and apparatus there is adequate cupboard 
space, part of it with sliding glass doors. The laboratory 
is well equipped for chemistry, physics, and general science. 

The library, which is about two-thirds of the size of 
a classroom, is well supplied with shelves, tables and chairs. 
It is used as a study room by the Grade 12 students. It 
contains about 250 volumes from the Recommended Reading List 
for Senior High Schools and about 200 volumes from the Junior 
High School List. There is a wide range of reference books in 
science and social studies. Besides the books from the 
Department of Education lists there are about 400 volumes of 
fiction, a good deal of it by well known authors. 

In separate buildings, which were originally one-room 
schools, are housed the shop and home economics rooms. The 
home economics building has a basement; the interior has been 
recently redecorated and the exterior improved with ,f insul- 
brick 1 ’ siding. The shop building has been partially improved 
by shop classes, having been set on a foundation and the 
interior lined with n ten-test !! . Both the shop and home 
economics rooms are fairly well equipped for the courses at

present being offered. 

The school is situated at the southern edge of the 
village on grounds of about five acres. The grounds are not 
nearly large enough, but the School Board has been negotiating 
for the purchase of additional land adjacent to the school 
grounds. There are no permanent playground fixtures and the 
landscaping has been rather neglected. 

5. Probable Enrolment 

If a centralized high school were established at 
Picture Butte for the high school students of Diamond City, 
Barrhill, Turin, and Picture Butte, the immediate total 
enrolment as estimated from Table V, page 50, would probably 
be about 150. About sixty of these would be in Grade X and 
about forty-five in each of Grades XI ana XII. If the program 
of the centralized school reduced the drop-out rate, which is 
one of the reasons for proposing it, the total enrolment would 
increase somewhat from year to year. But even if all eligible 
students remained in high school for three years it does not 
appear that the total enrolment would exceed EGu for several 
years. The following suggested programs are based, therefore, 
on an enrolment of between 15 g and EGG students. 

The initial enrolment of about 15G students would 
require four homerooms, tw r o for Grade X and one each for 
Grades XI and XII. In addition to the three rooms now' in use

as home-rooms for these three grades. Classroom 8 could be 
used for part of the Grade X class. Classroom 8 is the taping 
room and would be continued in use as such. But there is 
room in it for about twenty-five desks in addition to the 
typewriting tables. As this room would be used for only seven¬ 
teen periods per wreek for typewriting, it is proposed to use it 
for other courses also. 1 2 

4. Program for the Initial Year of the Composite High School 

Table XIV, page 78, suggests a diversified program 
for the first year of operation of a centralized high school 
at Picture Butte. The Department of Education has, over the 
past three years, adopted a new system of naming ana numbering 
courses.^ The new system is used in this and subsequent 
tables. For comparison Table XIII, page 77, showing the 
courses offered at Picture Butte in 1952-53, is included. 

With the exception of two electives in Grade XI, the proposed 
program does not add to the Grade XI and XII courses. In the 
first year of the suggested program the Grade XI and XII 
students of Picture Butte would benefit little. But students 
of these grades from the smaller schools would have a

greater choice of courses than they wovt 14. have under the 
present system. 

The main expansion in the suggested program is in the 
Grade X electives. The essential difference between the 
proposed program and the 1952-53 program is that two 
commercial courses and two shop courses are added. These 
courses, which are vocational in nature, are Shorthand 10, 
Typewriting 10 (5 credits). Woodwork 10, and Metalwork 10, 

It is the intention to suggest, for subsequent years, more 
advanced courses in these subjects so that students may do 
a fairly large part of their high school work in one of these 
fields. 

There are several reasons for thus expanding the 
curriculum by Including commercial and shop electives rather 
than other possible courses. Of the four fields. Commercial, 
Shop, Home Economics, and practical Agriculture, the commer¬ 
cial courses have by far the largest enrolment over the 
whole Province, and about twice as many girls as boys are 
enrolled in them. The shop courses have the next highest 
enrolment followed fairly closely by the home economics 
courses. With the exception of the Arts and Crafts courses, 
the shop courses are taken almost exclusively by boys and 
the heme economics courses by girls. To warrant the offering 
of both commercial and home economics courses a school would

require a fairly large enrolment of girls. The experience 
of the Taber High School is an illustration. In that school 
in 1950, fifty-three girls were enrolled in Grade X, Of 
these* twenty-eight were classified as having commercial 
programs and only six as having technical (home economics) 
programs even though a number of home economics courses 
were available to Grade X students. 1 

Practical Agriculture enrols the fewest students. 

In 1951, courses in this subject were offered in ten schools 
in the Province but the total enrolment was only 160 students.^ 
For this reason courses in this subject were not included, in 
the suggested program. But such courses should probably be 
considered in the future. Practical Agriculture is relative¬ 
ly new to the Alberta High School Program, and, although 
enrolments are still small, interest in the subject is 

Q 

increasing. The requirements of equipment, sps.ce, and 
specially qualified teachers probably explain why such 
courses are not more widely offered. 

Specific examples of enrolments according to type of 
program selected by students are shown in Table XV, page 81. 

The Red Deer Composite and Taber High Schools were chosen 
for these examples because they offer a wide range of courses 

1 The information was supplied by Mr. H.B. Myers, 
Principal of the Taber High School.

from rural areas* The table shows that substantial per¬ 
centages of the students are enrolled in commercial and 
technical programs. It also illustrates the low enrolments 
in agriculture. 

The foregoing considerations appear to justify the 
inclusion of commercial and shop subjects in the expanded 
Picture Butte program. An explanation of the selection of 
particular courses in these subjects will now be given. 

Since the Alberta High School Program provides for 
only two vocational commercial courses at the Grade X level. 


The figures, which are only approximate, were 
supplied by the principals of the two schools, Mr. D.C. 

Dandell. Red Deer, and Mr. H.B. Myers, Taber. 

2 

The large percentage of Red Deer Students classified 
as academic may be accounted for, in part, by the unusual 
nature of the Grade XII class to which reference was made 
page 42.

these courses are included in the proposed Picture Butte 

program.^" Teachers of commercial subjects must have special 
o 

certificates. For the Grade X courses the Junior Certificate 
in the particular subjects is sufficient. However, as 
further expansion in the commercial field is proposed for 
the second and third years, for which the Senior Certificate 
in Commercial Subjects is required, it would be desirable 
to secure a well qualified commercial teacher in the first 
year. The school has eighteen typewriters. This would be 
enough as it is not likely that more than 50 % of the probable 
Grade X enrolment of sixty would take the five-credit type¬ 
writing course. Since no other special equipment is needed 
for Shorthand 10 and Typewriting 10, there appears to be 
no great difficulty in including these courses. The typing 
room would be used five periods per week for the five-credit 
course, six periods for the three-credit courses, and six 
periods for Grade IX typewriting classes. This is a total 
of seventeen periods per week. 

The Alberta High School Program lists six shop courses 
5 

at the Grade X level. The two included in the proposed 
Picture Butte program. Metalwork 10 and Woodwork 10, were

suggested by Mr, Lowery 1 2 * 4 who believed they would serve fairly 

well the needs and interests of the boys and would be the 

2 

most practical in view of existing equipment. The present 

shop building would be suitable for these two courses but 

additional equipment would be needed, particularly for the 

metalwork course. Such items as metal forming stakes, bar 

folder, beading machine, and welder were suggested. The 

provision of teaching time for these courses would not present 

much difficulty. Two half-days would be required. In 1952- 

53 the shop teacher spent one-half day teaching General 

4 

Mechanics 15 in the Picture Butte High School. Since this 
course is omitted from the proposed program, this teaching 
time would be available for Metalwork 10 or Woodwork 10. 

The shop teacher spent two half-days at each of Turin and 
Barrhill part of which time was used to teach high school 
courses. As there would no longer be high school classes at 
those centres, he could spend an extra half-day at Picture 


jack N. Lowery, B.Ed., has been the teacher of 
shop subjects in the schools of the Picture Butte area since 
1940. 

2 He also suggested that the course in Automotives 
would be very desirable but that it would require much more 
space than is now available and also a considerable amount of 
expensive equipment. Hence the inclusion of this course was 
not recommended for the first year. 

2 

A detailed list of this additional equipment and its 
cost is given on page 119.

Butte, This would provide the additional teaching time 
necessary for the proposed courses. 

The inclusion in Table XIV, page 78, of Shorthand 10, 
Typewriting 10, Woodwork 10, and Metalwork 10, as Grade X 
electives has now been explained. Mathematics 10 and Science 
10, which are required for matriculation, are included. In 
addition to these six courses there are ten other electives. 
All of these, except Mathematics 11, have been offered in 
recent years at Picture Butte® Mathematics 11, a course in 
business arithmetic, would be of special value to the commer¬ 
cial students® Two classes are suggested in the three-credit 
Typewriting 10 course as it would probably continue to be 
taken by nearly all students as it has been in the past. This 
is not a vocational course but aims, rather, to give the 
students practice in the use of a typewriter for their 
personal needs. 

All Grade X students would take eighteen credits in 
the constants. Assuming that in addition they took Mathe¬ 
matics 10 and Science 10, or Woodwork 10 and Metalwork 10, or 
Typewriting 10 and Shorthand 10, or any other combination 
amounting to eight or ten credits, they would still require 
two or three other electives to make up a program of from 
thirty-five to forty credits which is considered a full 
year’s work. Sixty students, the expected. Grade X enrol¬ 
ment, each choosing two or three courses from the ten

electives mentioned above would provide classes with an 
average enrolment of about fifteen in each of them. Some of 
these electives would be chosen by the students of Grade XI 
and XII since only five non-academic electives are suggested 
for these two grades. Grade XII students completing a 
matriculation program would need not more than one non- 
academic elective, others would need as many as three or four 
depending on their prerequisites for the Grade XII academic 
courses. Most Grade XI students would need two or three non- 
academic electives. To get a rough estimate of the enrol¬ 
ments in these electives it was assumed that the ninety 
students expected in Grades XI and XII would require an 
average of two non-academic electives. If each student chose 
one course from the five non-academic electives suggested for 
Grades XI and XII, there would be an average enrolment of 
eighteen in each. If each chose one course from the ten Grade 
X electives mentioned above, there would be an average enrol¬ 
ment of nine in each. This would bring the total average 
enrolment in these Grade X electives to twenty-four. On the 
basis of this estimate the number of electives suggested 
appears reasonable. 

An idea of the adequacy of the program suggested in 
Table XIV in relation to the probable enrolment is obtained 
by the following calculation. The total number of teaching 
periods provided is 196 per week, and the expected enrolment 
is 150 students. The average number of credits required by each

student is estimated to be thirty-six; that is, each 
student would attend an average of thirty-six classes 
per week* Multiplying 150 by 56 and dividing the product by 
196 gives 28 which is, therefore, the average enrolment per 
class. The largest classes would probably be in the Grade 
XII constants and in the Grade XI academic electives. These 
classes v/ould have about forty students each. In courses 
where the enrolment was expected to exceed this number, two 
classes were provided. An average enrolment of twenty-eight 
per class and a maximum of forty probably indicates that the 
number of courses offered is satisfactory. 

The total number of teaching periods per week required 
for the program shown in Table XIV is 196. Of these, fifteen 
are taught by the part-time teachers of shop and home economics 
subjects leaving 181 to be taught by the full-time Picture 
Butte teachers. Assuming that the principal taught twenty 
periods per week, there would remain 161 periods which would 
require the services of five teachers, each teaching an 
average of thirty-two periods per week® This number is less 
than the number of periods taught per teacher in 1952-55, 
which was about thirty-seven. But with a larger enrolment, 
teachers would be required for special duties such as the 
supervision of study periods and guidance and counselling 
which would require several periods per week. A total of 
six teachers, including the principal, for 150 students is

not unreasonable in comparison witn the practice of the 
schools listed on page 63. 

Classroom space must he provided for the 196 periods 
required for the proposed program, and, in addition, for 
six periods per week for typewriting in Grade IX in Class¬ 
room 8. Present facilities are adequate for tnis total of 
202 teaching periods per week as shown by the following

the Grade ^ courses listed in Table XIV, page 78. It is 
based on an eight-period da,y, which has been used in Picture 
Butte for several years — five in the morning, and three in 
the afternoon. The only difficulty in devising a timetable for 
these courses is the provision of periods for the shop and 
home economics courses. Teachers of these subjects generally 
prefer to have the periods for each course in a H block”. In 
Table XVI these courses are listed for periods two to five 
on Monday and Tuesday. In order to make Art 10 available to 
as many Grade X students as possible, the periods for tnis 
course are listed in !! blocks” of two periods on Monday ana 
Tuesday. The timetable is planned so that all students may 
choose two electives from one of the fields, academic, commer¬ 
cial, or technical. The timetable partly takes into account 
the proposal of the Department of Education to include at 
least one mathematics course and at least one science course 
in the requirements for a high school diploma. 1 Of course, 
both these requirements need not be met in the first year of 
high school, but it is probably desirable to meet at least 
one of them. The timetable makes it possible for every 
student to take one mathematics course. The academic students 
would meet the science requirement with Science 10 . Although 
Science 11 is available to the commercial and technical 
students, it would not meet this requirement because it is

suggested here as a three-credit course* If used to meet the 
science requirement it must be taken as a four-credit course* 

Table XVII, page 91, shows how students may choose 
programs of the three types, academic, commercial, and 
technical. These sample programs illustrate the features 
mentioned above. A student could, of course, choose a 
general course by making a selection from more than one of 
the three major fields. 

The sample program of the technical type does not 
provide any electives in art, music, or dramatics, and the 
commercial type lacks music and dramatics* Students in 
these fields probably should be encouraged to choose 
electives from these cultural subjects. The fact that Music 
10, Art 10, and Dramatics 10 are suggested here as four-credit 
courses causes the difficulty in making them available to 
the commercial and technical students* A more extensive 
use of the "block" system would be one way to overcome this 
difficulty. Another way would be to offer these courses on 
a three-credit basis. If this were done they could easily 
be made available to the commercial and technical students 
without changing the plan of the timetable. For example. 

Music 10, (three-credits) could be exchanged on the timetable, 
page 88 , with Business Fundamentals. Similarly Dramatics 10 
(three-credits) could be exchanged with Bookkeeping 10. 

Another alternative would be to omit a course such as

Business Fundamentals from the program anu substitute an 
additional class in one of the cultural subjects. This could 
be done if there appeared to be sufficient demand for one of 
these subjects to warrant trie offering of two classes in it. 

5. Program for the Second Year of the Composite High School 

The extent of expansion of the program in the second 
year of operation of the centralized high school would depend 
on the total enrolment. As was shown in the analysis of the 
enrolments for recent years in the scnoois of the Picture Butte 
area on page 34, there is no indication of a substantial 
increase in the high school enrolment within the next few years. 
There is a possibility that following the introduction of the 
diversified program in Grade X there would be fewer drop-outs 
during and at the end of this grade. But it appears very 

unlikely that the total enrolment for the second year would 

«!'• * 

exceed by ten the enrolment for the initial year. Therefore 
no very great expansion of the program seems to be warranted. 

To provide a sequence of courses in commercial ana snop 
subjects it is proposed to add two courses in each of these 
fields at the Grade XI level. The Senior High School Handbook 
lists five such commercial courses: Bookkeeping SO, Shorthand SO, 
Office Practice SO, Typewriting SO, ana Clerical Practice SG.^

These are all five-credit courses except Shorthand 20 which 
may be offered as five or eight credits. The first three of 
these courses have the corresponding Grade X courses as 
prerequisites, while Office Practice 20 and Clerical Practice 
20 have no prerequisites. The inclusion of one of these 
latter courses would, therefore, make it available to more 
students. Apart from this consideration any two of the five 
might be chosen, but to give a specific example. Typewriting 
20 and Office Practice 20 are suggested. No additional 
special equipment would be needed for these courses; class¬ 
room space would be available as shown on page 87, and, 
assuming a qualified commercial teacher was secured in the 
initial year of the plan, there appears to be no difficulty 
in making this addition to the program. 

Six shop courses are listed for Grade XI in the Senior 
High School Handbook all of which may be offered as eight or 
ten credits, and all have the corresponding Grade X courses 
as prerequisites. As Woodwork 10 and Metalwork 10 were 
suggested for Grade X in the initial year. Woodwork 20 and 
Metalwork 20 are suggested for Grade XI In the second year 
of the plan. It is suggested that these be offered as eight 
credits rather than as ten to make it easier for students 
choosing them to fill out their programs from other courses 
on the timetable. The inclusion of these shop courses 
presents some difficulties, especially in their requirements

of teaching time and of equipment* The one shop teacher 
provided for the first year would teach eight periods or one 
full day in the high school, and the rest of his time would 

be taken up with Grades VII, VIII, and IX in Picture Butte, 

Iron Springs, Turin, and Barrhill. It is evident that an 
additional shop teacher would be needed in the second year. 
The shop work in Grades VII, VIII, and IX in the four schools 

would be enough to require a full-time teacher. By providing 

a teacher for this work, the shop circuit could be maintained 
as at present. Therefore it is suggested that a full-time 
shop teacher be secured for the Picture Butte High School. 

He would be needed for only twenty-four periods, or three 
full days, per week for shop classes, but he could teach some 
other high school classes as well. 

The Grade XI courses in Woodwork and Metalwork would 
require additional equipment of which the largest and most 
expensive Item would be a metalworking lathe. The extra 
equipment would require extra space; hence a new shop build¬ 
ing or at least an extension of the existing building would 
be required. 1 

The proposals for the second year of the composite 
high school are summarized as follows: the program would be

increased by twenty-six credits requiring twenty-six teaching 
periods, ten periods for Grade XI commercial courses, and 
sixteen for Grade XI shop courses; the teaching staff would 
be increased from six to seven full-time teachers one of 
whom would be a shop teacher. 

Table XVIII shows the total number of teaching periods 
and how they would be distributed among the teachers. It was 
assumed here, as In the first year, that the principal would 
teach twenty periods per week. The average number of periods 
per week for the other teachers would be thirty-three, which 
would be about the same as the average for the initial year4^

6. Program for the Third ana Subsequent Years of the 
Composite High School 

Again enrolment will be the major factor determining 
the extent of expansion of the program in the third year. It 
is assumed that enrolment will remain fairly stable; hence 
few additions are proposed. It is desirable that one aadition- 
al course be offered in each of the commercial and shop fields, 
preferably at the Grade XII level, to enable a student to take 
a complete three year sequence in at least one subject. Type¬ 
writing 50 or Shorthand 50 could be offered; but if the 
enrolment should be too small to warrant either of these, 
a third commercial course could be offered at the Grade XI 
level. The addition of one commercial course \¥ould present 
no difficulties as to teaching time, classroom space or 
equipment. 

In the shop subjects either Woodwork 50 or Metalwork 
50 could be offered. These courses may be given as ten or fif¬ 
teen credits. Assuming that one of these courses were 
given on a ten credit basis, the number of additional teach¬ 
ing periods would be only two. The reason for this is that 
where enrolments are small, classes in Woodwork 20 and 30 and 
in Metalwork 20 and 50 are combined. It is very likely that 
the Picture Butte classes would be small enough for this 
arrangement. As the two proposed additions. Typewriting 30 
and either Metalwork 30 or Woodwork 50, would require only

seven additional teaching periods per week,the increase 
in the teaching load per teacher would be negligible. 

Table XIX, page 98, shows the suggested program for 
the third and subsequent years. 411 students would enrol 
in the constants of this program, giving them a total of 
forty-one credits. A student taking an academic course would 
take Mathematics 10, 20, and 50, Science 10, 20, 30, 31, and, 
possibly, 32, and French 20 and 30 for a total of fifty credits. 
4 student in commercial work could take Typewriting 10, 20, 
and 30, Shorthand 10 and Office Practice 20 for a total of 
twenty-five credits. A student in shop work could take 
Woodwork 10, 20, and 30, and Metalwork 10 and 20 for a total 
of thirty-four credits. Besides these courses there are 
fifteen other electives, excluding Home Economics 10 and 
Needlework 10, from which all students may choose to make 
up the diploma requirement of 100 credits. 

If the total enrolment should exceed that estimated in 
proposing this program, two major modifications of the plan 
in the third and subsequent years probably would be necessary. 
First, it might be necessary to offer two classes in the 
Grade XII constants, English 30 and Social Studies 30. To do 
this without curtailing the total program an additional 
teacher would be needed. Second, if the enrolment in the 
Grade XII shop course were fairly large, or, if it were 
considered desirable to include more shop courses, an

additional shop room would be needed. The reason for this 
is that following the introduction of the second year of the 
program, the shop room would be in use for practically ail 
periods of the week, twenty-four periods or three days for 
high school courses, and the remaining two days for shop 
classes in Grades VII, VIII, and IX. 

7. Readjustments in the Organization of Other Schools 

in the Area 


The schools at Shaughnessy and Iron Springs would not 
be affected since they have had no high school classes for 
several years. The teaching staffs at Diamond City, Barrhill, 
and Turin would be reduced by one each. As these schools 
have, at present, one classroom for Graaes IX and X and one 
for Grades XI and XII, the loss of Grades X, XI, and XII 
would result in changes in the distribution of grades to 
classrooms. This, however, is a problem that occurs in most 
schools from time to time. Each of these schools would have 
an extra room which, no doubt, could be used for special 
purposes such as a typing room, a projection room, a library, 
or a play room. 

Equipment for science, shop, home economics, typing, 
and physical education would still be in use for Grades VII, 
VIII, and IX in these three schools. Library books that are 
useful only for the high school grades could be transferred

to Picture Butte. 

No serious problem of readjustment in these schools is 
apparent. In at least one respect the loss of the nigh school 
grades could be an advantage. In schools with Graaes I to XII, 
the principal, who is always a teacher of high school grades 
and predominantly occupied with those grades, cannot give to 
the elementary and intermediate grades the attention which 
could otherwise be expected. 

8. Summary 

While a rather definite program has been outlined and 
specific courses suggested in this chapter, the aim was to 
show how the development of a composite type program could 
proceed rather than to prescribe a certain list of courses. 

The considerations which determined the expansion in the 
commercial and shop fields probably have some weight, but 
actual experience may show that expansion in other fields 
would be better. The program outlined for the first year is 
wide enough that it may have an exploratory function, and 
experience in the first year would be a basis for making 
modifications in the second and subsequent years of the plan. 

The establishment of the proposed composite nigh school 
is to be accomplished in three successive years by adding 
courses in commercial and shop electives first in Grace X, 
then in Grade XI, and finally in Grade XII. In this school

a student would then be able to pursue, through his three 
years of high school, an academic course leading to matricu¬ 
lation, or a commercial course, or a technical course, or, 
by choosing from all fields, a general course. Any one of 
these courses would qualify him for the high school diploma. 
To provide the instruction in this school the teaching staff 
is to be increased from the four at present to seven, one of 
whom is to be a commercial teacher, and one a shop teacher. 
Shop facilities are to be improved by the provision of a 
considerable amount of extra equipment, and, in the second 
year, by some additional building. Apart from these require¬ 
ments, no extra building and little extra equipment are 
needed.

CHAPTER V 


GETTING THE STUDENTS TO THE SCHOOL 


Although the preceding chapters have shown that a 
composite-type high school for the Picture Butte area is 
desirable and that a program for it is feasible, there 
still remains the considerable problem of getting the 
students to the school* A summary of this transportation 
problem is shown in Table XX*

their home schools. As the high school students are very 
widely scattered it would be entirely impractical to provide 
special busses to gather them from their homes and take them 
directly to Picture Butte. Evidently they would have to be 
taken to their home schools as they are at present and then 
transported by special busses to Picture Butte. In order to 
allow time for the trip to Picture Butte adjustments would 
have to be made in the present bus schedules and school time¬ 
tables. Such adjustments would affect not only the high 
school studenrs but nearly all students of the four centres 
shown in the table. 


1. The Transportation of Iron Springs Students 

Since September 1949 the high school students from 
Iron Springs have been transported to Picture Butte; hence 
an analysis of this case might indicate how the problem could 
be solved for the other centres. The following data were 
obtained from a questionnaire answered by ail the students 
from the Iron Springs district who were attending the Picture 
Butte High School in April 1955. Of the twenty-one students 
involved, sixteen were first taken from their homes to Iron 
Springs, while the remaining five lived along the highway 
between Iron Springs and Picture Butte and were taken 
directly to Picture Butte. The bus left the Iron Springs 
school about 8:55 a.m. ana arrived at Picture Butte about

8:55. The earliest any student had to leave home was 8:00 
am., the average being about 8:15. 1 The latest any student 
reached home was 4:15 p.xn. , the average being about 4:00. 

The maximum total distance travelled by any student in one 
day was thirty-four miles, twelve miles in the morning and 
twenty-two in the afternoon. This student left home at 8:20 
and arrived home at 4:15. Very few students had to walk an 
appreciable distance to catch the bus; in most cases the bus 
stopped at the student 1 s gate. 

It is not likely that the transportation arrangement 
just described works a hardship on the high school students. 
According to some authorities, a bus ride of one hour, morn¬ 
ing and afternoon is not considered excessive.^ But most of 
the younger pupils are forced to adopt the same schedule and 
for them it may be rather strenuous. These students do not 
have a longer bus ride than they would have if the high 
school students were not taken to Picture Butte. But they 
have to leave home earlier in the morning and arrive home 


Two students, of the same family, left home at 
7:55 and travelled nearly two miles by car to catch a bus. 
These students were actually in the Turin district, having 
moved there during the school year, but continued to attend 
the Picture Butte school by choice.

later In the afternoon. Some of them are away from home for 
eight hours or more, which is a rather long school day for 
young pupils. 

This arrangement also causes some inconvenience to 
the Iron Springs teaching staff. School hours in Picture 
Butte for the past few years have been from 9:00 to 12:10 
and from 1:30 to 3:20. In Iron Springs the hours have been 
from 9:00 to 12:00 and from 1:10 to 3:40; that Is, the Iron 
Springs students are dismissed at about the time the bus 
arrives from Picture Butte. Thus the Iron Springs school 
day has been lengthened slightly. Moreover, extra pupil 
supervision is involved there since nearly all pupils arrive 
at school about ten minutes earlier than they otherwise would. 
Also the Iron Springs staff Is responsible for the supervision 
of the high school students while they are waiting there to 
transfer from one bus to another. 

Irregularities in bus schedules occur as a result of 
weather and road conditions and, more rarely, as a result of 
mechanical breakdowns. Although the roads are generally good, 
many are not gravelled; consequently rain or drifted snow may 
delay certain busses. Thus it happens occasionally that the 
Iron Springs students are a few minutes lateat Picture Butte. 

A record of the times of arrival and departure of the Iron 
Springs bus was kept for the writer by a Grade XII student 
for a two-week period in April 1953. A similar record was

larity.

The record for April 1953 was kept during an unusually 
rainy period ——it rained on five of the ten days on which 
observations were made. Consequently this record probably 
shows the extremes of irregularity rather than the normal 
schedule. The record for February 1954 was kept during a 
period of comparatively good weather. This record shov/s 
greater regularity in time of arrival at Picture Butte — a 
maximum variation of twelve minutes compared with twenty- 
five on the first record. But the time of arrival in Iron

Springs was more irregular tham in April 1955. The time of 
leaving Picture Butte was not recorded during the second 
period because this is almost always 3:25. Unfortunately 
during this period the bus was a few minutes late in leaving 
Picture Butte on two occasions. This would account for the 
greater irregularity in the times of arrival at Iron Springs. 
The records for the individual days showed rather little 
variation in the actual running time between Picture Butte 
and Iron Springs. The fastest time was fifteen minutes and 
the slowest twenty-one minutes* the average being approxi¬ 
mately seventeen minutes. This indicates that delays on the 
run between Iron Springs and Picture Butte, where the route 
is along Highway Ho. 25, are rare. 

A comparison of the attendance of Iron Springs and 
Picture Butte high school students was made to determine 
whether the former were at a disadvantage in this respect. 
Table XXII, page 108, shows a summary of the average 
attendance of the two groups for the years since the Iron 
Springs students have attended the Picture Butte High 
-School. The figures show the average number of days attended 
during the school year by each group. In this table, the 
attendance of students who left school before the end of 
June in each year was disregarded. The reason for this is 
that the inclusion of the attendance of students who attended 
only a few days and then left would have a disproportionate

enrolment is small relative to the Picture Butte enrolment* 
Prom the table it appears that the Iron Springs 
students are at a disadvantage as to attendance* However, 
it cannot be concluded that this disadvantage is entirely 
due to the irregularities of bus transportation, for, 
whereas most of the Iron Springs students live on farms and 
are required at home for some time during the beet harvest, 
more than half of the Picture Butte district students have

bus fails to make the trip from Iron Springs to Picture Butte 
Such a failure has occurred only three or four times since 
1949. Thus, if a student reaches Iron Springs, he can almost 
always go to Picture Butte. But it sometimes happens that a 
bus serving the Iron Springs school cannot cover its full 
route because of blocked roads. When this happens some 
students will be left behind. 

In spite of these difficulties and inconveniences the 
transporting of Iron Springs high school students to Picture 
Butte appears to be satisfactory to the people concerned. 

The writer has heard of no movement to have a small high 
school re-established at Iron Springs. 

2. The Transportation of Diamond City Students 

The distance of Diamond City from Picture Butte is 
only one mile greater than the distance from Iron Springs 
to picture Butte. Thus, a transportation plan similar to 
that serving Iron Springs could be adopted with no greater 
inconvenience than has been experienced by Iron Springs. 

There are some factors which make the problem less difficult 
than for Iron Springs: the route is entirely along that por¬ 
tion of Highway No. 25 which is hard-surfaced; most of the 
district roads in the Diamond City and Shaughnessy area are

gravelled; and many of the Diamond City students live at 
Shaughnessy which is only about four and one-half miles 
from Picture Butte. 

5. The Transportation of Turin and Barrhill Students 

Turin is sixteen miles east of Picture Butte on High¬ 
way No. 25. Since this is eight miles greater than the dis¬ 
tance of Iron Springs from Picture Butte, the transportation 
problem would be more difficult than in the Iron Springs case. 

Data on times of leaving home in the morning and of 
arrival home in the afternoon were obtained in February, 

1954, from a questionnaire ansv/ered by students attending 
Turin School. Thirty students in Grades VII to XII, ?/hich 
was practically all of the students of those grades who 
travelled by bus, answered the questionnaire. The time of 
leaving home varied from 8:00 a.m. to 8:40 a.m., the average 
being 8:18 a.m. Six of the thirty students left their homes. 
at 8:00. The time of arrival at home varied from 5:45 p.m. 
to 4:30 p.m., the average being 4:00 p.m. Only two students 
arrived home as late as 4:30 p.m. These were students from the 
Sundial area east of the Little Bow River ’which w r as added to 
the Lethbridge School Division in January 1954.-^

It Is estimated that it would take a bus about thirty 
minutes to travel from Turin to Picture Butte* The records 
kept in 1953 and 1954 showed that the bus from Iron Springs 
required an average of seventeen minutes for the eight-mile 
trip to Picture Butte.^ It made three stops enroute. The 
bus from Turin would not have to make any stops in its last 
eleven miles and could, therefore, proceed at the maximum 
rate permitted; viz., forty miles per hour. Hence an estimate 
of thirty minutes for the trip seems to be reasonable. To 
reach Picture Butte a few minutes before 9:00 the bus would 
have to leave Turin not later than 8:25. Since the busses 
serving the Turin School at present arrive there between 
8:30 and S:45, some of them would have to arrive at least 
twenty minutes earlier. Consequently some students would 
have to leave their homes as much as twenty minutes earlier, 
and there would be a corresponding delay in their times of 
arrival at home. A few would have to leave their homes at 
7:40, and some would arrive home at 4:50. This schedule 
appears to be impracticable, especially since it would 
affect the younger pupils as well as the high school students. 

A similar problem would occur in the case of the Barr- 
hill School which is eleven miles north of Picture Butte. 

This is only three miles greater than the distance from

Iron Springs to Picture Butte, but seven miles of the route 
are district roads. These roads, although they are gravelled, 
do not permit as great a speed as the highway. Moreover, the 
students in the Barrhill area are more scattered and the bus 
routes consequently longer. 1 The adjustments that would have 
to be made in the Barrhill schedule would be about the same as 
for Turin. Hence this, also, would be impracticable. 

A possible solution to this difficulty would be a 
change in the school hours at the Picture Butte High School. 
For the past few years this school has opened at 9:00 in the 
morning and closed at 3:20 in the afternoon. The noon inter¬ 
mission has been from 12:10 to 1:30, a period of one hour 
and twenty minutes. By opening at 9:10 and closing at 3:10, 
and reducing the noon intermission to one hour, the schedule 
of teaching periods would remain unchanged. By making these 
changes the transportation of students from Turin and Barrhill 
could be accomplished with little more inconvenience than has 
been experienced by the Iron Springs students. 

Such a shortening of the noon intermission would 
necessitate some adjustments on the part of the teaching 
staff and the students who live in Picture Butte. It would 
not cause much hardship as the greatest time any teacher or

student requires to walk home is about ten minutes* The 
elementary school in Picture Butte has had a noon intermission 
from 12:00 to 1:10 for the past few years. If, in making a 
change, the intermissions of the two schools could be brought 
more closely into agreement, it does not appear that a short¬ 
ening of the high school noon intermission would result in 
any serious inconvenience to the public generally* 

There are at least two factors tending to increase 
the efficiency of bus transportation in the Picture Butte 
area. First, municipal district roads are being constantly 
improved, mainly by more extensive gravelling, thus making 
possible higher average speeds by the busses. Second, there 
is a trend towards the use of smaller busses but more of them. 
The reason for this is that the smaller busses are more suit¬ 
able for the district roads. The consequence has been that 
the routes are shorter and the pupils do not have to board 
the busses so early. This trend Is illustrated in the Iron 
Springs area where the number of busses covering the same 
routes and serving about the same number of pupils has been 
increased from four to seven over the past three years. 

Transportation problems are rather serious difficulties 
in the establishment of the proposed centralized high school 
at Picture Butte. But, if the suggested adjustment in school 
hours were adopted, transportation would seem to be feasible.

The prospects for increased efficiency in bus service 
indicate that these problems might become less formidable 
in the future.

4. Dormitories 

An alternative to transportation is the dormitory. 
High school dormitories have been operated for many years 
in various parts of Alberta. But many difficulties are 
involved in their administration and supervision, and the 
cost to individual students is rather high.-** In recent 
years there has been a general decline in dormitory enrol¬ 
ment over the Province as a whole.^ This is attributed to 
improved transportation facilities. Since transportation 
seems to be feasible in the Picture Butte area, the 
possibility of establishing dormitories was not seriously 
considered in this investigation.

of School Dormitories . 1950, p.14, 16.

CHAPTER VI 


FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS 

Although the proposed composite-type high school 
discussed in the previous chapters may be desirable and 
physically feasible* the final test of its practicability 
is its cost. This project* like any other* project to 
improve an educational system* would result in increased 
expenditures. These expenditures may be divided into 
annual operating costs and initial or capital costs. 

1. Annual Operating Expenditures 

Under operating costs are transportation, teachers 1 
salaries, and miscellaneous items such as supplies* insurance* 
and the upkeep of buildings. The largest item would be the 
cost of transportation. An additional daily bus trip would 
be required from each of the centres* Turin* Barrhill, and 
Diamond City* to Picture Butte. Bus service in this area is 
provided by contract with private owners of the buses. Most 
of this service is supplied by a Picture Butte firm at a flat 
rate of # 15 per day per bus regardless of the length of the 
route or the number of pupils carried. 1 As there are about

Treasurer of the Lethbridge School Division No. 7.

190 school days per year, the expenditure for each additional 
bus route would be about $2500, or a total of about $7500 for 
the three routes, per year. Of this amount 40% would be re¬ 
covered by the Division as a grant from the Department of 
Education. ^ 

The expenditure for teacher’s salaries would probably 

not exceed present expenditure for this item. It was shown 

that the total reduction in the number of teachers resulting 

from the elimination of Grades X, XI, and XII from the schools 

2 

at Turin, Barrhill, and Diamond City would be at least three. 
This reduction might be greater than that if the enrolments in 
the lower grades of one or more of these schools were small 
enough to permit the combining of three grades in one room. 
However, the survey in Chapter II indicates that this possi¬ 
bility is not likely® Hence the reduction in the staffs of 
the smaller schools Is estimated to be three. In the second 
and subsequent years of the plan, as outlined in Chapter IV, 
three additional teachers would be required in the Picture 
Butte High School. As high school teachers are involved In 
both cases, it may be assumed that there would be no sub¬ 
stantial change in the total expenditure for salaries. In 
the first year of the proposed plan the increase in the 
Picture Butte staff would be only two while the decrease in

the staffs of the smaller schools would be three. This would 
result in some savings on teachers* salaries in the first year. 

Under the proposed plan the grants received by the 
Division with respect to teachers would be the same as under 
the present system. Although two of the additional Picture 
Butte teachers would be teachers of special subjects, shop 
work and commercial work, equal grants are now paid for all 
classes of teachers.*^ 

The cost of such items as laboratory supplies, paper 
and chalk would increase for the Picture Butte High School, 
but this would be offset by the decrease in such expenditures 
in the three smaller schools where the high schools would be 
eliminated. If a new shop building were provided, there would 
be some increase in expenditure for insurance, heating, and 
building upkeep. 

2. Expenditure for Building and Equipment 

Some additional students* desks would be required. 

Since the students would move from room to room to some extent 
for their classes, the number of desks needed would exceed the 
number of students. A number of desks, presently used by the 
high school students at Turin, Barrhill, and Diamond City, 
could be transferred to Picture Butte.

listed for Woodwork 10 and 20, the above total of about 
$2000 would be the cost of the extra equipment required for 
the shop courses proposed in Chapter IV. One-third of the 
cost of the above equipment would be recovered by the Divi¬ 
sion as a government grant. s The cost to the Division would.

therefore, be about $1335, 

The largest item of expenditure involved in the 
proposed plan would be the provision of a suitable building 
for the shop courses. The present building, originally a 
one-room school, could be used for the first year. But with 
the addition of the extra equipment for the second year 
courses, larger shop facilities would be necessary. An 
addition to the present building is possible. Two small 
buildings, presently on the elementary school site, would 
be available after the new elementary school is built. 1 One 
of these might be moved to the high school site and used as 
an addition to the shop building. But it is unlikely that 
such a solution would be satisfactory since a shop room 
should be considerably larger than an ordinary classroom. An 
additional small building would be useful mainly for storage 
space. A new building especially designed as a shop would, 
no doubt, prove more satisfactory in the end. Such a build¬ 
ing would probably cost between $20,000 and $2:5,000. This 
estimate is based on information about other shop buildings 
recently constructed in Alberta. A H frame stucco” building, 
thirty feet by one hundred nine feet, without basement, con¬ 
taining a general mechanics room, a vocational agriculture 
room and storage space, was completed at Stony Plain about 

^ This new school building was referred to on page 20.

1952 at a cost of slightly less than $ 20,000A "frame 
stucco" addition, about forty-eight feet by sixty feet, con¬ 
taining a combined woodwork and automotives room, storage 
room, finishing room, and office, was built at Leduc in 1952 
at a cost of about $ 25,500.° Some local construction, too, 
indicates that the estimate made above is fairly reliable. 
Frame buildings, not shops but comparable to the type of 
building required for shops, were built at Turin and Iron 
Springs in 1851 at a cost of about $ 24,000. each.^ These 
buildings were without basements ana contained two class¬ 
rooms and a larger general purpose room.

In 1952 the total assessment of the Lethbridge School 
Division was about $15,000,000, and the requisition rate was 
twenty-eight mills.^ It may be assumed that the construction 
of the new shop building would be financed by borrowing as 
most construction in the Division has been in the past* The 
payment of debentures and the increase of about $4500 in 
operating expenditures would require an increase of less 
than one-half mill in the requisition rate* The total 
expenditure in the Division in 1952 was about $840,000.^ 

4s about 50$ of the pupils were in the Picture Butte area, 
it may be assumed that about 50$ of the expenditure, or 
$250,000, was incurred in this area. In view of these figures 
the increase involved in the proposal for a composite high 
school does not appear excessive. However, the School Board 
in considering such a proposal would probably take into 
account the fact that a similar service might be demanded in

other parts of the Division. If two or three such centra¬ 
lized high schools were established, the cost would, of 
course, amount to a considerable increase over the cost 
of the present system.

CHAPTER VII 


CONCLUSION 
1. Summary 

In this study of the advisability of establishing a 
composite-type high school to serve the Picture Butte area 
three main problems were considered. The first of these was 
to determine the extent and nature of the weaknesses of the 
present high school system in the area. The second was to 
propose a plan for a centralized school which might improve 
high school services. The third was to determine whether 
the proposed plan was feasible with respect to facilities, 
transportation of students, and costs. 

The first of these problems was analyzed in Chapter II. 
This analysis showed two main weaknesses. First, the present 
small high schools did not serve a very high percentage of the 
students who were elegible to attend, i.e., students who had 
received the Grade IX diploma. While little evidence was 
presented to show that the proportion of people of high school 
age who were not in school was greater in the Picture Butte 
area than elsewhere, it was clear that the percentage was 
much higher than could be considered desirable. Second, of 
the students who remained in school, only a small percentage 
graduated, i.e., qualified for the high school diploma. It was.- 
shown that this proportion was low relative to certain other 
schools.

It was concluded that many people of high school age 
were not adequately served by the schools of the area. This 
inadequacy was attributed to the rather restricted programs 
offered by these schools. It was shown that these programs 
were largely limited to the academic subjedts. That such 
limited programs fail to meet the needs of the present day 
high school population was examined further in Chapter III. 

This examination of the results of wider investigations and 
of the opinions of several authorities pointed to schools 
offering a more diversified program as a solution to the 
inadequacy of the strictly academic schools. It was shown 
that in Alberta such diversification was achieved by adding 
to the academic programs such subjects as shop, home economics, 
practical agriculture, and commercial courses. Schools 
offering such programs required a fairly large enrolment. 

The second problem, a plan for a centralized composite- 
type high school, wag dealt with in Chapter IV. A program 
was suggested providing a core of courses in the shop and 
commercial fields as well as a quite complete program in the 
academic subjects. This program was based on the assumed needs 
and preferences of 150 students, the approximate total high 
school enrolment at Picture Butte, Turin, Barrhill, and 
Diamond City, at present. It was also assumed in proposing 
this program that the Grade VI classes would be removed

from the high school building upon completion of the new 
elementary school, and that better shop facilities would 
be provided* 

The third problem, the feasibility of the plan, was 
considered in Chapters V and VI. It was shown in Chapter V 
that daily transportation of the students, though difficult, 
would be feasible. The main difficulties pointed out were 
that transportation of high school students would also affect 
the schedules of the younger pupils, and that the rather 
great distances involved in transporting the students from 
Turin and Barrhill would cause a rather long school day for 
some students* Attention was drawn to some factors tend¬ 
ing to improve bus service, and a plan was suggested for 
adjusting the school hours at Picture Butte to lessen the 
hardship which would fall upon the students from the more 
distant centres. 

The increase in costs involved in the proposed plan 
was summarized in Chapter VI. It was shown that the increase 
in operating costs would not be excessive. However, the cost 
of equipment for the proposed shop courses would be fairly 
high, and the provision of a suitable shop building would be 
the major item of expense. 

On the basis of these conclusions the writer recommends 
that the School Board of the Lethbridge Division give earnest 
consideration to the proposal for the establishment of a

composite-type high school to serve the Picture Butte area. 

The writer does not believe, however, that the proposed plan 
is a complete solution to the problem of providing for the 
needs of all people of high school age. There is no certainty 
that the number of students graduating from high school under 
the proposed plan would greatly exceed the number now 
graduating. It was pointed out in Chapter II that a great 
many students left school during Grades VII, VIII, and IX. 

This group would not be helped much by the proposed plan. 

A further reason for this caution is that the number of high 
school students available in the schools of this area is not 
much greater than the theoretical minimum for the type of 
school proposed. In other words, even with the proposed 
addition of two subject fields to the program, there may still 
remain a large number of students whose needs and interests 
are not satisfied. Moreover, it is not universally believed 
that the composite-type school is the most desirable solution 
to the high school problem. Some authorities, particularly 
those concerned with university education, believe that the 
high school should be concerned mairly with the academic 
subjects and that special vocational schools should be pro¬ 
vided for other subjects.

Suggested Steps for Implementing the Plan 


lki0 


1. The people of the area should have an opportunity to 
discuss the plan. The leadership in this would probably 
be taken by the Superintendent of Schools and the members 
of the School Board from the sub-divisions in the Picture 
Butte area. Contact with the public could be maae through 
the Local District School Boards ana the Home and School 
Associations. 

2 . The high school teachers at Turin, Barrhill, ana Diamond 
City, who would be affected by the plan, should have ample 
advance notice of the change so that they could make 
adjustments. As there is usually a considerable turnover 
of teachers in the Division each year, positions within 
the Division could probably be found for them. 

3. In May or June of the year in which the change is to be 
made, the high school students should be advised and given 
guidance as to different types of programs which they could 
choose. A student questionnaire could be used to gather 
information as to enrolments in the various courses. 

4. Arrangements should be made for the additional bus trips 
required, and changes in school hours at picture Butte 

and at other centres to allow for the extra travelling time 
of high school students should be agreed upon. 

5. Specific half-days of the shop and home economics teachers 1

time should be allocated to the small schools, and these 
schools should be re-organized, where necessary, on a grade 
and room basis, 

6. The services of a teacher qualified in the commercial 
subjects should be secured, 

7. Extra desks and the equipment for the new shop courses 
should be provided. 

8. A timetable for the program of the centralized school 
should be drawn up. 

9. Although the extension of the shop facilities would not 
be required until the second year, plans should be made 
for it in good time. 

3. Possible Future Developments 

In the course of this study a number of problems 
which may demand attention after the school is in operation 
occurred to the writer. Some of these are: 

1. The inclusion of the Nobleford and Coalhurst high 
schools in the scheme. These schools are within a 
reasonable distance of Picture Butte and may possibly 
desire inclusion. This would increase the enrolment 
by some eighty students, and the school would then 
serve all that part of the Division between the Old 
Man and Little Bow Rivers.

2. The provision of a guidance and counselling service 
for the students. With a wide range of courses to 
choose from, students would require some expert help. 

5. Extra-curricular activities for the students who 
come to school by bus. It may be possible to give 
these students a greater share in such activities by 
providing periods for them during school hours. 

4. The inauguration of a semester system. The absenteeism 
of students in the fall is a serious problem. A system 
similar to that of the Red Deer school may be a 
solution* 

5. The inclusion of a course in vocational agriculture. 
Such a course would be valuable in this area. The 
Curriculum Guide for Agriculture 10, issued by the 
Department of Education in 1952, outlines practical 
courses which are adaptable to a variety of conditions.
