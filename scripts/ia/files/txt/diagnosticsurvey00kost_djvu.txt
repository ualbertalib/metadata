CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 

In June, 1940, the Department of Education gave for 
the first time a new set of tests to he administered annually 
in June to the urade Xll students writing departmental Ex¬ 
aminations and seeking admission to the Normal Schools of 
Alberta. This set consists of two parts: a u-eneral rest, 
and a Survey rest in Science (Part A) and Mathematics (Part B). 
ihe purpose of these tests is to measure comparatively the 
mental ability and the scholarship of candidates from all parts 
of the Province. "The general Test is one of mental aptitude 
and the Survey rest one showing the candidate’s grasp of those 
fundamental notions and principles in mathematics and science 
which a high-school graduate seeking admission to the teach¬ 
ing profession should reasonably be expected to understand. 

The only satisfactory preparation for either test is a sound 
high-school education". (Regulations of the Department of 
Education for the year ending, jjune 1940.) 

It is hoped that these tests may reveal the range of men¬ 
tal ability an3 scholastic competence of those candidates who 
might be admitted to the Normal bchools on the basis of their 
high-school standing; for it is suspected that it is possible 
to obtain satisfactory marks in the regular subjects in high- 
school and yet rank low in mental ability and possess an in¬ 
adequate grasp* of the fundamentals of mathematics and science.

j?or this reason r, a candidate’s average standing in high-school 
work combined with his scores on these tests will be the basis 
for provisional admission to the iMormal Schools*” (Regulations) 
Actually what do these tests reveal? 1*0 answer this ques¬ 
tion a survey of the answer-papers on the Mathematics Survey 
Test (Part B) of June, 1940, of two hundred candidates was 
made, and this thesis proposes to summarize the findings in 
Chapters II, III, and IV, as follows:

AN ANALYSIS OF THE ANSWERS PAPERS 
An Analysis of the answers for each Question 

Figure 1 is a graph showing the distribution of the 
scores, the Mode, Median, and Mean average score, and ave¬ 
rage deviations from the Mean score. 

This subsection analyzes the ansYjers to each question 
with a view to discovering significant processes of thought, 
types of incorrect answers, etc. The complete test itself is 
given in the attached form—Appendix I. For each question are 
given the number (out of 200) of correct answers and the equi¬ 
valent percentages.

Correct answers: 123, or 61*5% 

24, or 12% of the students said that there was no 
change, but showed no computation. 

55, or 27.5% reasoned from one instance; i.e., they 
took one example and from that deduced their general 
answer. 

9, or 4.5% realized that by adding the same positive 
number to both the numerator and the denominator the 
fraction becomes nearly equal to unity. 

6, or 3% took two or more examples to be sure. 

One student, by adding 2 to each of the numerators 
and the denominators of fractions beginning with 3/4 
obtained a series of fractions: 5/6, 7/8, 9/10, 11/12, 
but concluded that the fraction became smaller and 
smaller. 

Correct answers: 172, or 86% 

8, or 4% thought that there was no change, either 
because they guessed wrongly, or because their compu¬ 
tation was at fault. 

67, or 33.5% reasoned from one example. 

9, or 4.5% worked out wo or more examples for veri¬ 
fication. 

Correct answers: a) 99%, b) 44.5% c) 2.5% 

There was considerable guessing on this question; e.g., 
I ~ prt is the area of the surface of the sphere; S“ 
p(l+ r) b is the volume of the sphere; volume of a cube, 
or even an electro-chemical equivalent.

Question: 

4.(a) Correct answers: a) 19% b) 11% 

(b) 24% of those who got the correct answer knew and app¬ 
lied the formula for the Volume of the Sphere (4/3^); 
while only 11% knew the formula for the surface area 
of the sphere. 

(c) There was no dearth of guessing, or impossible solu¬ 
tions; e.g., the answers ranged from "an increase of 
1/1000% to 1000%. 

, (d) 13 students reasoned that if the radius increased by 

10% the volume would also increase by 10%, and the 
surface area likewise would increase by 10%. 

(e) 12 students had the right idea, and knew the formula, 
but failed to carry their thinking to a conclusion. 

For instance, several began by assuming a volume of 
100 cu. units, and by successful computation found that 
the increased volume was 133.1 cu. units. Then they 
failed to note that the increase in volume was 33.1%, 
saying that the increase was 133.1%. 

(f) Curiously enough, 8% of the students, having correctly 
answered part (a) of the question, apparently could 
not carry out the same process of reasoning for part 

(b) even though they knew the formula to be applied. 

(g) The most significant aspect of the answers is the fact 
that the great majority of students could not grasp 
the idea of variation; i.e., they could not see the 
variation in the volume and the surface area of a

Question: 

4. (g) continued: 

sphere when there was a variation in the radius even when 

they knew the formulae to be used. 

5. (a) Correct answers: 102, or 51% 

(b) 9%> of the students grasped the idea of the problem 
involved but did not complete their thinking; e.g., 
they left their answer as a common fraction instead 
of converting it to a decimal fraction. Eleven stu¬ 
dents left 1/8.5 as the answer; while nine realized 
that 17/144 was a fraction between 1/9 and 1/8 but 
left it at that. 

(c) This question, too, had its share of guesses; e.g., 
.0001, 2/27, .0125, 145/1296. 

6. (a) Correct answers: 25, or 11.5# 

(b) This question was one of the "worst offenders”. 

i- 51# thought that Intensity varied directly as 
the distance. 

ii- 17% thought that it varied inversely as the dis¬ 
tance. 

Ill- 3% thought it varied directly as the square of 
the distance. 

(c) 11 students were content to say that "A could hear 
the loudest, then B, and then C". Logical enough, 
but scarcely good mathematics! 

(d) In this question the commonest fault in reasoning

is evident; viz., assuming that volumes and surface 

areas vary directly as their radii. 

7. (a!

(b) The most frequent incorrect answers were: 



complementary angles .25 times. 

right angles .20 " 

straight angles .15 " 

8.(a) 

Correct answers: 100, or 50% 

(b) 

The most commonly given incorrect answers were: 

chord (cord in several instances).....57 times. 

9. (a) 

Correct answers: 82, or 41% 

(b) 

Some of the most unexpected answers were: 

"eccentricity”, "unharmonic progression", "equili¬ 
brium" . 

10.(a) 

Correct answers: 151, or 75.5% 

(b) 

9 students gave "sexagon" as the answer; 1 rhombus; 

and 1 hexameter. 

(c) 

In common with Questions 7, 8, and 9, this one tested 

vocabulary and came in for its share of "wild" guess¬ 
ing. 

11.(a) 

Correct answers: a) 140, or 70% b) 84, or 42% 

(b) 

It is interesting that while 70% of the students 

could give the unecniivocal answer Yes for the first

continued: 

part of the question, only 42% could support their 
answer by giving a correct example. 

Of the 140 who said Yes, 43 promptly contradicted 
themselves by giving examples showing that the quo¬ 
tient was smaller (not larger) than the dividend. 
Apparently the absurdity of their example did not 
strike them. 

5 students were astute enough to realize that if a 
negative number is divided by another negative num¬ 
ber the quotient is positive, and therefore greater 
than the dividend. 

Correct answers: 157, or 78.5% 

The answer to this question could quite possibly be 
guessed correctly. 

Correct answers: 60, or 30% 

The significant feature of this question was that 
the correct answer could be obtained by the solution 
of the equation F-9/5 01-32, when F=C. 

There is more than a shade of suspicion that a con¬ 
siderable number of students who got the correct an¬ 
swer did so by recalling from General Science or 
Physics that the reading (-40°) is the same for the 
Centigrade and the Fahrenheit scales. These students 
showed no evidence of reasoning. 

14 students said that the reading was the same when 
the thermometers showed temperatures of 32*C and 0° F.

Question: 

14. (a) Correct answers: a) 80.5% b) 77% c) 75% 

(b) Little can be inferred from the fact that no less than 
75% of the students scored correctly on all parts of 
this question except that it tested a mechanical use 
of the symboloC without at the same time testing the 
students 1 ability to solve problems involving direct 
and indirect variation. 

15. (a) Correct answers: 150, or 75% 

(b) This question rated high in the correct answers 
perhaps because it is at about the Grade Till level 
of difficulty. 

(c) Five students gave a formula indicating the volume 
of a cube. 

16. (a) Correct answers: a) 96.5% b) 45% c) 82% 

(b) The only interesting feature of the answers is the 

low score on part (b) as compared with the high scores 
on parts (a) and (c). It is probable that a lack 
of understanding of the word "reciprocal" was respon- 
ible for the low score. 

17. (a) Correct answers: a) 73% b) 65% c) 77% 

(b) The high score on all parts of the question indicates 
that it was too simple. Only occasionally did a 
student draw a curve which no possible interpreta¬ 
tion of the data could have justified. 

18. (a) Correct answers: 193, or 96.5%

Question: 

19. (a) Correct answers: 108, or 54% 

(b) The answers, particularly the incorrect ones, to 
this question , more than to any other one, re¬ 
vealed the astounding degree to which students will 
hazard guesses regardless of how impossible or ab¬ 
surd they may be* For instance, although one di¬ 
mension (height of triangle) was not given as a 
numerical value, 24 students gave the area of the 

triangle as some integral quantity such as 1000 sq. 
inches, 5J~75 sq* in., 167.5 cu. in., 43 inches. 

(c) 36 students realised that the area might be in¬ 
finitely large or "indeterminate”. 

(d) 60 students gave the answer as 5 x h (or some other 
symbol representing the height of the triangl^. 

20. (a) Correct answers: 26, or 13% 

(b) This question was another of the "worst offenders", 

155 students giving 36 as the area of B. Obviously 
they fell into the common error of supposing that 
two areas are to each other as their respective sides. 

21. (a) Correct answers: 105, or 52.5% 

(b) Astuteness, or common intelligence, was all that was 
necessary to see the "catch" in this question; viz., 
that the triangle was isosceles. Questions of this 
sort test intelligence apart from any deep know¬ 
ledge of geometry.

Question: 

21 continued: 


(c) 

34 students estimated that AC was anywhere from li 

to 1-g- times as long as AB, leaving a strong sus¬ 
picion that they had measured the two sides. 

(a) 

25 students thought that AC was two times as long 

as AB. Could it be that they were led to believe 

so because of the fact that /ABC -2/CAB? Perhaps, 

they erred in reasoning from very misleading cues. 

(e) 

Although it is very evident to the eye that AC is 

not shorter than AB, six students thought it was, 

saying that AC was from 1/3 to 7/8 of AB. 

22.(a) 

Correct answers: a) 90% b) 35% 

(b) 

It is interesting to note that, although 90% of 

the students were of the opinion that the sum of 

the interior angles of all polygons was the same, 

only 35% of them knew what that sum is—63 of them 

gave 360° as the sum. 

23.(a) 

Correct answers: 26, or 13% 

(b) 

Prom the "high mortality” bn this question one v^ould 

gather that there is only a very rudimentary notion 

of 'locus’ in the minds of high-school students. 

(e) 

19 students gave the location of the ”treasure” rough 

ly somewhere in the four quadrants formed by the 

two intersecting "fences”. Perhaps the wording of 

the question did not suggest definitely enough that 

some construction was necessary to locate the "treas¬ 
ure” exactly.

Question: 

23 continued: 

(d) 77 students located the "treasure” on one or more 


of the two bisectors of the angles at the intersec¬ 
tion 50 yards from the point of intersection, or 
50 yards from the nearest "fence", thus: 



24.(a) Correct answers: a) 63.5$ b) 50$ c) 47$ 

(b) This question tested the power to visualize geo¬ 
metric figures. In a way, this type of question 
is justified as it reveals that this power is ne¬ 
cessary for the successful solution of many prob¬ 
lems in geometry and trigonometry. 

(c) This question provided a goodly share of "howlers": 
car tire, cylindrical rectangle, circle with thick¬ 
ness, drum, doughnut. 

(d) It would be an interesting experiment in psychology 
to find out how students can see "a pyramid in a 
wire rectangle rotated about one of its sides", or 
"a spiral in a circle moving perpendicular to its 
own plane". 


25.(a) Correct answers: a) 52$ b) 71.5$ c) 47.5$ 

(b) That part (b) ranked highest in correct answers 
might mean that where the proposition was not

Question: 

25. (b) continued: 

obscured by references to geometric figures the 
students could more readily see the converse. 

26. (a) Correct answers: 67$ 

(b) Because the answers were simply the letters T, F, 
or S, there was no way of judging what the students 
had in mind when they gave their answers. However, 
one significant fact did reveal itself; viz., that 
well over 50$ of the. students who "missed” on part 
(n) said that it is True that inAABC, AD=DC when 
it is obvious from the figure that this is not so. 
There was apparently no hesitation in hazarding a 
guess in the face of the most contradictory evidence. 

A Comparison and a Summary of the Scores made by the 
Two Hundred Students on each Question 

A study of Figure 2, showing the percentages of correct 
answers to the individual questions discloses some interesting 
facts. 

First, the students, as a whole, scored low on questions 
3(c), 4(a) & (b), 6, 13, 20, and 23. Can any common diffi¬ 
cult features be found in these questions that might throw 
light on the reason for the low scores? Question 3(c) may be 
disregarded . That students in high-school have not, for some

16 


years, been required to work out problems in compound in¬ 
terest is undoubtedly the reason for the low scores. How¬ 
ever, questions 4(a) & (b), 6, 20, have this in common: 

(a) ‘l'hey definitely involve reasoning; 

lb) They involve relationships; e.g., linear measure to 
area or volume; 

(c) They call for some computation, especially question 4. 

it would appear, then, that the concept of functionality 
and relationship, coupled with somewhat difficult computation 
and requiring some reasoning, has been responsible for the 
low scores. 

Secondly, question 15 required the solution of a rela¬ 
tively simple equation, £=9/5 032, when £*C. Judging from 
the answers the main reason for the high "mortality” was that 
the students did not understand the point of the question; i. e 
they did not see that the "reading" on both scales is the same 
when F=C. 

Thirdly, as for question 23, all that can be said is that 
the students failed to see the "geometry" involved. Had the 
question been worded in some such way as this: "Locate 4 
points which are equidistant from the two intersecting lines 
AB and CD. Show the construction required to locate these 
points.",it is probable that the students would have done 
much better on the question. The fault here is pretty typical 
of the difficulty students have in applying their knowledge 
of geometry (or any other exact science) to situations more

or less foreign to the typical situations found in the text. 
to avoid this fault an attempt is being made in the new courses 
in geometry and algebra for high-schools to enable students 
to reason directly from common situations found in every-day 
life. Hitherto, seeing relationships, etc., was a formal 
sort of thing. Any logic that was involved in problem - 
solving had to do with the mental "manipulation” of abstract 
or general terms. Too much stress was laid on formal logic, 
memorization of propositions and formulae, types of proofs, 
methods of construction, types of problems, etc. Question 
23 is only one of the questions revealing the shortcomings 
of this type of instruction. 


A Comparison of the High Scores 
and the Low Scores 

This section gives a detailed, as well as a graphic, 
comparison of scores on the individual questions of two 
groups of candidates: G-roup A scoring more than 30 on the 
Test, and Group B scoring less than 30. Croup A had taken 
both Algebra 2 and Trigonometry in Grade Xll; while Group B 
had taken either Algebra or Trigonometry, or both (29 cand¬ 
idates had taken both). There were 50 in each group; and their 
papers were part of the 200 that were analyzed for the pur¬ 
poses of this investigation. The purpose of this comparison 
is to discover the way in which students who scored low differ¬ 
ed from those who scored high in the manner in which they 
scored on the individual questions. Were their scores lower

in the same proportion on all questions; or did the students 
fare badly only on certain questions? 

An examination of the graph (Figure 3) shows that : 

1. While none of Group B scored anything on question 
4(a) and (b), the scores of Group A were 45$ and 
22$ correct respectively. 

2. There is a difference of over 50$ between the scores 
of the two groups on question 5. 

3. There is considerable range in the scores of the two 
groups on questions 7, 8, 9, 14(a, b, and c), 15, 17, 
20, 21, and 24. 

4. There are uniform low scores of the two groups on ques¬ 
tions 3(c) and 23. 

5. On the other hand, both groups scored uniformly high 
on questions 3(a), 10, 16(a), 18, and 22(a). 

Can any significance be attached to the differences and 
similarities in the scoring of the two groups? 

1. W 7 e see that the greatest range in scores of Groups 
A and B occurred on questions involving variation and 
relationship between linear and surface or cubic 
measures, as in questions 4 and 20. This may be due 
to the more intensive instruction in mathematics which 
Group A had received. On the other hand, it may be 
assumed that this difference is also partly due to 
differences in intelligence, for, as it shall later 
be shown, Group B scored consistently lower than 
Group A on the General Test.

2. The range in scores on question 5 (fractions and decimals) 
is more difficult to explain, unless one can say that Group 
A is more alert and consequently comprehended more thor¬ 
oughly the point of the question. This possibility is borne 
out by the fact that a greater number of students of Group B 
than of'Group A did not complete their computation, but left 
the answer in the form of a fraction. 

3. More intensive and extensive instruction in mathematics 
probably accounts for the difference in the scores on ques¬ 
tions 14 and 17, and for the differences in scores on Nos. 

7, 8, and 9 in which only vocabulary was tested. 

4. Nothing but differences in intelligence can account for the 
range in scores on questions 15 and 21; for it appears that 
no profound knowledge of algebra or geometry, but mainly 
acuteness, is called for in the solution of these questions. 

5. Since no specialized knowledge is required to answer ques¬ 
tion 24, the difference in the scores can be explained only 
on the grounds that Group A could visualize better because 
of some superior intellectual power. Whether this superior¬ 
ity can be considered an index of superior general intel¬ 
ligence is for psychologists to say. 

6. On the other hand the two groups scored uniformly low on 
questions 3(c) and 23. What may account for this? Question 
3(c) asked for a recognition of formula Ssp(l-rr). Only 
2.5% of all the students (none of Group B) recognized it. 
Perhaps this is not so surprising when one considers that 
the old Arithmetic 1 course in which stress was laid on

compound interest has not been compulsory in high-schools 
for some years. 

The low scores on question 23 cannot be so easily ex¬ 
plained. An analysis of the answers to this question 
reveals that there was considerable loose thinking. Many 
students had carried their thinking only part of the way 
to a successful and logical conclusion. Many more did not 
seem to be aware of absurdities in their attempts or their 
conclusions. There is more than a suspicion that had more 
questions required several connected and logical steps or 
stages in their solution, the results of the whole test 
might have been even less satisfactory. On this question, 
at any rate, good pupils did not differ from the others in 
their slip-shod thinking. 

7. What of the uniformly high scores on questions 3(a), 10, 

16(a), and 22(a)? The obvious answer is that these questions 
were too easy. Indeed, some of them were about the Grade 
711 level of difficulty. Another reason may be that, as 
in 22(a), the question could be answered with a Yes or No. 
This provided plenty of opportunity for correct guessing. 

On the whole the superior group scored higher on most 
questions and pretty much in the same proportion. The 
notable exceptions are: questions 3(a), 16(a), 18, and 
22(a), on which both groups scored uniformly high; and 
question 3(c) on which both scored practically nothing. 

The reasons for these similarities have already been sug¬ 
gested—the first group of questions were too easy, and 
the latter too hard.

Another comparison (Figure 4) was made of the manner in 
which students who had taken at least one senior mathematics 
scored on the individual questions, and the manner in which 
students who had taken no Grade Xll mathematics at all scored. 
Group C had taken either Algebra 2 or Trigonometry (79 had 
taken both); and Group D had taken neither. There were 100 
in Group C, and 50 in D. The reason for the smaller number 
in Group D is that of the 200 papers that were analyzed for 
the purposes of this thesis only 53 belonged to pupils that 
had taken no Grade Xll mathematics. 

An examination of the graph in Figure 4 shows that: 

1. On questions 3(a), 16(a), 18, and 22(a) Group D scored 
practically the same as Group C, both scoring high. Whether 
or not the candidate had taken any senior mathematics in high- 
school the questions were easy enough for him to answer correct¬ 
ly. 

2. On questions 3(c), 4(a) and (b), 6, 20, and 21, Group D 
did not score at all; while Group C did, although on some of 
them the scores were not very high. It would appear that in¬ 
struction in senior mathematics is necessary for an understand¬ 
ing of some of the principles measured in the Test. 

3. On question 10 (naming a six-sided polygon) Group D 
scored higher than Group C. 

4. On the remainder of the questions Group D scored con¬ 
sistently lower than Group G.

A comparison of figures 3 and 4 shows that students who 
had taken no mathematics in arade Xll (group D) scored on the 
whole lower than did those (Group B) who had taken at least one, 
even though the latter did not do very well on the Test. The 
average score, of Group D was 22, and of Group B it was 29.5. 

One might say, then, that "some mathematics is better than no 
mathematics.” 


A summary of the Scores on Ten 
fundamental Principles in Mathematics 
as Deduced from the Test 

As was pointed out in the introduction the Survey Test in 
Mathematics attempts to "measure the grasp of those fundamental 
notions and principles in mathematics which a high-school gradu¬ 
ate should be reasonably expected to understand.” Although the 
framers of the rest did not definitely indicate what fundamental 
principles and notions were to be measured, a careful analysis 
of the Test warrants the grouping of certain questions on the 
basis of more or less distinct mathematical principles involved. 
The accompanying table (Table 1) shows the general principles 
tested, the questions which involve these principles, and the 
percentages of correct answers for each principle. Do attempt 
is made to weight the questions in any group, although this 
would appear to be desirable in view of the fact that the ques¬ 
tions purporting to test the understanding of any one prin¬ 
ciple were of different degrees of difficulty.

scores on the ten fundamental principles. A study of this

graph would perhaps justify the following general observations: 

1. The students on the whole have a very inadequate grasp 
of the relation between linear and surface or cubic 
measures. 

2. The students have a most thorough grasp of ratio and 
variation (?) How can this be accounted for in the light 
of the very poor showing on the principle of relation¬ 
ship above-mentioned--a principle that is somewhat akin 
to ratio and variation? The answer lies in the fact that 
the questions measuring an understanding of ratio and 
variation are extremely elementary; e.g., questions 12 
and 18; while those testing the principle of relation¬ 
ships are considerably more difficult and involve in 
addition a knowledge of the formulae for surface and 
volume of a sphere, it may be that the principle of 
variation is not adequately measured by the Test. 

3. The percentage averages for all the principles are not 
unduly high. On the whole, one may be justified in 
inferring that the students have only a fair grasp of 
the fundamentals. This inference receives support from 
the analysis that was made of the answers to the indi¬ 
vidual questions.

CHAPTER III 
CORRELATIONS 

Correlation between Scores on Test B 
and Marks in high-school mathematics 
made by the same Students 

An attempt has been made to discover if there is any sig¬ 
nificant correlation between the marks made on the Departmental 
Examinations in Algebra 2 and scores on the Survey Test in 
Mathematics, Did those students who made high scores in Alg¬ 
ebra likewise score high on the Survey Test? Do low scores in 
Algebra reveal any "abnormalities” in the way the same students 
scored on the Test? furthermore, is the performance on the Sur¬ 
vey Test of those students who have taken no Grade Zll math¬ 
ematics in any way similar to, or different from, the perfor¬ 
mance of those who have taken one of: Algebra 2 or Trigonometry? 

In figure 6 the graph shows the relative scores on the 
Mathematics Test of three groups of students: 

a) Those who obtained high marks in Algebra 2 (above 65) 

b) Those who obtained low marks in Algebra 2 (below 65) 

c) Those who had taken neither Algebra 2 nor Trigonometry. 
There were 50 students in each of groups (a) and (b), and 45 

in group (c) 

Is there anything in the graph that will throw light on 
the questions raised above? An examination of it discloses the 
following interesting facts: 

1. Except on two questions, 22(a) and 25(b), those students 
who made the highest marks in Algebra likewise scored 
highest on the Survey Test. Does this mean that the 
same factor (whatever it may be) was responsible for

30 


the high scores on both the Algebra paper and the Survey Test? 
If so, can one assume that this factor is simply what is called 
"intelligence”? The assumption may appear to be justified by 
the fact that the performance of group lb) parallels on the 
Survey Test quite consistently, but lower, the performance of 
Group 1 a). 

But what of group (c)? Because they made scores consist¬ 
ently below the other two groups, is one justified in judging 
this group as the least intelligent? Hardly. Table 2 shows 
the mean scores on the General Test (measuring intelligence) 
of the three groups, (a), (b), and (c) to be 54, 40, and 47 
respectively. Group (c) has a higher mean intelligence than 
than group (b) but scored lower on the Mathematics rest. It 
appears then that ability to grasp and understand the funda¬ 
mentals of mathematics is'a product of intelligence and of 
instruction in mathematics. 

2. Group (b) scored highest on question: 25(b), and group 
(c) scored only 5% less than group (a). This question did not 
involve any mathematical principle; therefore it may be sup¬ 
posed that ability to see the converse of a stated proposition 
depends largely on ordinary perspicacity, and group (cj could 
be expected to do as well as either of the other two groups-- 
as they did. 

3. A further correlation between high-school mathematics 
scores and the Mathematics Test scores is shown in the follow¬ 
ing table:

On the other hand, Group G has a weaker background of 
mathematical knowledge as a result of avoiding the

Correlation between Scores on the General 'rest 
and the Mathematics rest 

until recently the accepted basis for admission to the 
Normal Schools in Alberta was a specified standard of achieve¬ 
ment in certain designated subjects in high-school, it has 
been felt that this basis is inadequate even as an index of 
academic achievement, certainly it is inadequate as a measure 
of personality, intelligence, and interests, which are factors 
entering into the making of successful teachers besides the 
factor of academic standing, recognizing then the need for 
measuring some of these factors the Department of Education 
devised the General rest designed to measure at least one of 
them; viz., intelligence. 

ferhaps, it may be argued, a student 1 s high-school stand¬ 
ing or his understanding or his understanding of the fundamentals 
of mathematics and science is an accurate enough index of his 
mental ability. This Section shall attempt to indicate the 
degree to which high-school marks on the Departmental Exami¬ 
nation subjects and the scores on the Mathematics and Science 
Survey Tests correlate with the scores on the General Test. 
Several methods of measuring this correlation have been used. 

1. Scores of ICO of the candidates on the Mathematics and 
on the General Tests were ranked in order from the lowest to 
the highest. It was found that 34 $ of the scores on both 
tests were in corresponding deciles. The distribution of the

a total of 34 papers out of 100. This would mean that the 
probability of a student scoring in the highest decile on both

2. One hundred papers were selected more or less at random and 
divided into two groups? those with scores "below 30 on the 
Mathematics test and those with scores above 30. A frequency 
distribution of the scores on the General Tmt of the two groups 
was mads 9 and the average (Mean and Mode) scores were found to 
be 40 and 51 respectively* The better group in Mathematics 
averaged on the General Test 11 points higher than the les*, 
successful group.

dred scores on either test were taken for this computation. 

4. The "Scatter Diagram" (Figure 7) of 200 scores on the 
General Test and the Mathematics Test show a fairly uniform 
concentration of scores, indicating a considerable positive 
correlation between the two sets of scores.

5. The correlation between 100 scores on the Science Survey 
Test and the General Test may be inferred from the Scatter 
Diagram in figure 8. 

6. Marks in Algebra 2 of 100 students were divided into 
two groups: Group A with marks above 65, and Group B with 
marks between 50 and 60. 

Table III shows the average scores of the two groups on 
the General Test, the Mathematics Test, the Science Survey 
Test, Algebra 2, and the average high-school standing.

We may conclude then that there is a positive correlation 
between intelligence and mathematical ability, and that within 
limit marks in high-school mathematics, or for that matter, 
general standing in high-school, are an index of a student 1 s 
general intelligence. Referring back to the original question 
of admission to the Normal Schools, perhaps the basis of high- 
school standing has not been altogether hap-hazard. A high 
standing is a fair indication of general ability, or even of 
the understanding of mathematical and scientific principles. 

On the other hand, a high standing in high-school work 
or high scores on the General Test and the Survey Tests is 
no guarantee of success in teaching. It gives no clue to 
interests, attitudes, or personality—-traits which are as 
important as general ability or academic knowledge in success¬ 
ful teaching. 


CHAPTER TV 

General Observations and Conclusions 

To go back to the original question of the purpose of the 
Survey Tests, particularly the Mathematics Test, viz., "to show 
the candidates 1 grasp of those fundamental notions and prin¬ 
ciples in mathematics----which a high-school graduate seeking 
admission to the teaching profession should reasonably be ex¬ 
pected to understand." We may safely assume the premise that 
if students get an adequate grounding in elementary and high- 
school mathematics they should have a reasonable understanding

of the fundamentals of mathematics, in Chapter i an attempt 
was made to give a picture of the degree to which a number of 
principles, as measured by the Test, were mastered by 200 un¬ 
selected candidates. An examination of Figure 5 shows that 
12% of the students scored on question involving the principle 
of linear and surface relationship; 55% were successful in 
scoring on questions requiring generalization, and so forth. 

On the average only 56% of the students scored on the funda¬ 
mental principles. It would appear that the 200 who sought 
admission to the Normal Schools and were granted it have only 
a 50% grasp of the fundamentals of mathematics. Does this 
mean that their training in the elementary and high-school 
grades has been only partially successful? Or does it mean 
that they were taught one thing and tested on something en¬ 
tirely different? 

To answer these questions let us see what the aims and 
objectives of mathematics instruction in the schools of Alberta 
are. below are given excerpts from the Programme of Studies 
in Mathematics for the Intermediate and High-Schools, enunciating 
the aims and objectives of the Programme. They may be classi¬ 
fied as "General" and as "Specific" aims; the former being such 
as "socializing the mathematical experiences of the students, 
making them meaningful, relating mathematics to the practical 
needs of the students, etc". We may disregard them as they 
are general and no attempt was made in the Test to discover to 
what extent they were met. The more specific aims, those under¬ 
lined in the excerpts, appear to be a reasonable understanding of

6. Logical thinking in mathematics. 


Ai ms and Objectives of the Programme of Studies in Mathemati cs 

f or intermediate and high Schools in Alberta 


"Many pupils will not continue their schooling beyond 
Grade IX, It is not desirable, therefore, to spend time on 
perfecting techniques of computation which they will seldom 
if ever use. It is preferable to introduce them to as wide a 
range of interpretative Mathematics as possible. There are 
concepts in Algebra and in Geometry which are easily under ¬ 

stood and which will make meaningful much of the child's out- 
of-school experience, " 

"Since the aim of the course is to interpret the environ¬ 
ment rather than give skill in computation, emphasis is placed 
on easy mathematical relationships and expressed in the form 

of tables, graphs, formulae, and equations. " 

"Throughout the Algebra and Geometry (Intermediate) the 
concept of functionality is repeatedly introduced . The early 
emphasis of this notion should make meaningful the Algebra of 
Grades X and XI, in which equations will be viewed as state¬ 
ments of relationships among variables rather than of state¬ 
ments of facts respecting constants." 

"In the algebraic portion of the course it is intended 
that the students* knowledge of number and space relations 
be used as the basis for formulae and operations, and that 
every effort be made to recognize that it is mathematics 
that is being studied, and not a narrow and abstract set of 
algrbraic rules."

"Teachers are reminded that some time should he devoted 
to helping students master the spelling and meaning of all 
new words belonging to the technical vocabulary of Mathematics ." 

"The really important thing is that students be kept 
working at optimum efficiency throughout the year on meaning ¬ 
ful problems which have practical interest for them . The aim 
is not to enforce a standard but to increase the students’ 
understanding' and practical efficiency.” 

"Students are expected to secure training in defending 
these (propositions that have already been assumed ) by weTT - 
arranged argument , and to recognize the meaning and develop ¬ 
ment of logical thinking in which certain words and certain 
propositions are assumed." 

It will be observed that there is a close correspondence 
between the fundamental principles tested by the Survey 'rest 
in Mathematics (Table I) and the principles which the programme 
of studies aims to teach. This being the case, the inference 
that students graduating from the high-schools have only an 
imperfect (about 50 °/o) grasp of the fundamental mathematical 
principles appears to be justified, but whether it may be 
reasonably expected that students should have a better grasp, 
in view of the many factors entering into a consideration of 
teaching and learning of mathematics, is another question , 
and cannot be considered here. 

The Adequacy of the Mathematics Training 
in the Elementary and Secondary u-rades 

if the findings given in the first section of this chap¬ 
ter seem to be disappointing the fault may lie in a number of 
factors: the test itself, the teachers’ interpretation of 

the aims and objectives of the teaching of mathematics, or 
the methods of teaching. To analyze these factors and to

attach the proper weight to these factors, much more research 
would have to be done than has been attempted by this thesis. 
.Nevertheless, some general observation may be hazarded relative 
to one of these factors; viz., the methods of teaching, or more 
broadly, the adequacy, as disclosed by the Test, of a high- 
school graduate's education in mathematics. 

irirst, in a most general way it may be said that students 
graduating from the high-schools have a very imperfect under¬ 
standing of the principle of functionality and variation, it 
must be realized, however, that departmental regulations no 
longer require either for the digh-bchool diploma or for iMormal 
Entrance any senior mathematics in which this principle re¬ 
ceives anything like adequate treatment. While it is true 
that it has been receiving increasing emphasis in recent years 
even in the junior courses in mathematics (Algebra 1 and ‘geo¬ 
metry 1), it is doubtful whether the "gospel of functionality" 
has been as yet adequately "preached" by the teachers. Time 
will reveal the reaction of the teachers of the Province to 
the new book in geometry 1 in which the principle is all- 
important. 

Secondly, the ability to form generalizations from 
specific problem situations does not appear to be too out¬ 
standing. if this ability is dependent on the so-called 
innate intelligence then there is little that can be done. 

On the other hand, if pupils can be taught to form general¬ 
izations then greater emphasis must be placed on its teaching. 
This need is being recognized in the more recent texts in 
mathematics where algebra has found its way even into the 
seventh grade.

Since many of the candidates, whose papers were the sub¬ 
ject of this investigation, had taken their Algebra, Geometry, 
and Trigonometry under the old system which stressed "type 
problems", memorized propositions, stereo-typed solutions, etc., 
it is understandable why they should find difficulty with the 
principles of functionality, variation, etc. it would be 
interesting to make a survey similar to this some years hence 
to measure the general content of mathematics of students 
"raised" under the new system. 

Jfinally, the importance of language whould be evident 
from an analysis of any test in mathematics, it may be stated 
that leading teachers in mathematics have long been dinning 
into the collective ears of the teachers of the Province the 
crying need of deliberate instruction in the language of 
mathematics right from the very first grade. One prominent 
teacher of mathematics confessed that he "taught English 
most of the time and boot-legged a little algebra on the side." 

The Difference in the Educational Background of 
those Students who Scored Low and those 
who Sgored High on the Mathematics Test 

The Departmental regulations read "a candidate's average 
standing in high-school work combined with his score on these 
tests (General and Survey) will be the basis for provisional 
admission to the Normal Schools". Actually, because of the

small number of applications for admission in 1940, no appli¬ 
cant who had fulfilled the requirements insofar as high-school 
standing is concerned was refused admission on the basis of 
his scores on the Survey Tests* Let us suppose, however, that 
the number seeking admission had been greater than could have 
been accommodated, and that selection had been made on the 
basis of the Test scores. Let us further suppose that those 
scoring low had been eliminated. What type of candidate would 
have been eliminated? 

To find the answer to this question the high-school re¬ 
cords of 200 students who had been granted provisional ad¬ 
mission to the Normal Schools in 1940 were studied. These 
200 were divided into two groups of 100 each: those who had 
generally scored high on all the Tests, and those who generally 
scored low. The following information was compiled regarding 
the scholastic record of the students in both groups: 

1. Scores on the General Test, and the Mathematics Test, 

2. Average standing in Grade XII, . 

3. The number of subjects taken in Grade XII, 

4. The number taken out of: Algebra 2, Trigonometry, 
Physics 2, and Chemistry 2. 

Table IY gives the following averages: 

1. The average score on the Mathematics Survey Test, 

2. The Average score on the General Test, 

3. The average number of subjects taken in Grade XII, 

4. The average standing in Grade XII, 

5. The average number of subjects taken out of the se: 
Algebra 2, Trigonometry, Physics 2, and Chemistry 2.

even to their exclusion from the teaching profession, they 
are obviously not so inferior judged on the basis of their 
standing in the high-school work. How then can a group of 
students who are apparently significantly inferior in intel¬ 
ligence and even more deficient in the knowledge of the

fundamentals of mathematics average in Grade XII standing only 
13 points lower them Group A? The reason probably lies in the 
fact that of the so-called academic subjects, Algebra, Trigo¬ 
nometry, Physics, and Chemistry, Group A took on the average 
3.0 out of 4; while Group B took 2.1 out of four. The latter 
had apparently substituted for the more difficult academic sub¬ 
jects those on which they could score higher. 

Moreover, Group A had taken on the average 7.4 compulsory 
subjects and academic electives in Grade XII; while Group ave¬ 
raged only 7.1. The difference as yet is not great enough to 
be significant, for until three years or so ago, all high-school 
students whether they aim*d to matriculate or qualify for 
Normal Entrance had little option in the selection of their 
Grade XII subjects. However, as the new programme of studies 
for high-schools comes into more general application through¬ 
out the Province, it may be anticipated that the average number 
of academic electives selected by the students wishing to 
qualify for Normal Entrance will gradually decrease, these 
electives being replaced by optional subjects. 

When that happens, how significant and revealing will the 
average standing in high-school work be? If the standing in 
all subjects in the three years of high-school is taken into 
account the selection and classification of students will have 
to take into consideration standing assigned by teachers in 
the optional subjects; and it is well-known that in many cases 
such standing is unreliable, being entirely out of line with 
the standing obtained in Grade IX and the marks obtained in

the Examination subjects in Grade XII. On the other hand, if 
only the latter marks are taken into account, how reliable as 
an index of mental ability and general proficiency will marks 
on two compulsory subjects be? For it is at least theoretically 
possible for a student to qualify for Normal Entrance having 
taken only two eompulsory subjects in Grade XII. It was this 
very possibility that prompted the Department of Education to 
set up the General and the Survey Tests. 


The Regulations respecting Normal Entrance 

Another question is raised. If it is conceded that the 
average standing in high-school work alone is insufficient 
basis for admission to the Normal Schools, are the General 
Test and the Survey Tests any more reliable? Assuming that 
the General Test is reliable as a Measure of mental ability 
(this thesis did not undertake to investigate its reliability) 
what about the Survey Tests? The Survey Test in Science is 
disregarded, and only the Mathematics Test will be considered 
here. 

It has already been shown that there is a significant 
correlation between the scores on the Mathematics -rest and 
marks obtained on the senior courses in mathematics, Algebra 2 
and Trigonometry. It is also true that those students who 
had not taken these major mathematics courses generally 
scored low on the Survey Test. The question arises: Are 
those students who, while not being required to take any 
senior mathematics, score low in the Survey Test because of 
this deficiency to be discriminated against even to the

point of exclusion from iMormal Entrance? 

There will be no difficulty in deciding the admissability 
of the students who do well on their high-school programme and 
on their Tests. But there will be two groups whose case will 
not be so clear-cut: those who elect optional subjects in 
preference to academic electives and in all probability obtain 
high marks in the options but score low on the Survey rests, 
and those who, electing academic subjects in preference to the 
options, obtain a relatively low standing on their high-school 
work but score relatively high on the Survey Tests, it will 
be these border-line cases that will present a problem in 
teacher-selection. Which will weigh more heavily in the final 
selection: high-school standing, or scores on the 'Tests? 

Then there is another question. Are the fundamental 
principles as tested by the Survey Test in Mathematics learned 
in the intermediate and Junior high-school, or in the high- 
school? If it is assumed that training in Algebra 1 and 
Geometry 1 is sufficient for a reasonable grasp of the funda¬ 
mentals of mathematics, then it is fair to assume that any 
student scoring low on the Mathematics Test has an insuffi¬ 
cient grounding to teach intermediate or even Elementary 
mathematics. On the other hand, if senior courses in high- 
school are necessary for this fundamental understanding, is 
it logical to allow students to omit senior mathematics from 
their programme and then penalize them because they have 
not this fundamental grasp as a consequence of the omission?

An examination of the Test shows that, with the exception 
of three questions (Numbers 4, 6, and 20) there is no question 
of a level of difficulty above urade IX, certainly not above 
u-rade X. Yet of 200 of the students who qualified for admis¬ 
sion to the iMormal Schools in 1940, 48 scored below 50%, 160 
scored less than 75$. That is, 24$ of the candidates who were 
pronounced on the basis of their high-school standing qualified 
for Normal Entrance did not have a 50% grasp of those principles 
in mathematics which they might reasonably be expected to under¬ 
stand in u-rade IX; and 80% of them did not understand more than 
75% of the principles involved in the Test and corresponding 
largely to the principles taught in the intermediate and high- 
school grades. 

This then is the position: The Departmental regulations 
do not require that candidates for Normal Entrance obtain more 
than a 50% pass in junior mathematics (Algebra 1 and Ueometry 1) 
and then permit admission of these same candidates of whom 
80% have no better than a 75% understanding of the principles 
which they will be required to teach. Can we reasonably ex¬ 
pect them to be successful in teaching say, the mathematics 
in the intermediate grades where the principle of functionality 
is to be carefully stressed? Is it likely that anyone with 
a n B Tt grading in Algebra 1 or u-eometry 1 has sufficient grasp 
of algebra or geometry to teach it in u-rade IX? At best he 
can only assist his pupils acquire knowledge of mathematics. 

What can be done? One of two things, or both: Either 
the pass mark in the junior high-school mathematics must be 
raised to ensure a higher standard of mathematical knowledge

of students entering the iMormal Schools, or requirements must 
be revised to include some senior mathematics. Figure C shows 
that students who had taken Algebra 2, even though on the 
Departmental examination they obtained marks ranging between 
50 and 60, made scores on the Mathematics Test consistently 
higher on all questions than those who had taken no senior 
mathematics at all. The average score on the Test of those 
students who had taken no mathematics in L-rade XII was 24, or 
less than 50% of the possible score; whereas of those who took 
mathematics courses the average score was 32. (The mean score 
of the whole group of 200 was 30.4) 


The Validity and Keliability of the Test 

Incidental references have been made to various features 
of the Survey Test, a summary of which will now serve as a 
basis of a criticism of the rest itself. 

1. in Ohapter il a grouping of the questions in the 
Test was made on the basis of fundamental principles tested. 

The first section of this Chapter summarized the principles of 
which a student is expected to have a reasonable grasp upon 
graduating from high-school, to the extent that the two groups 
of principles (tested and taught) correspond the Test is valid; 
i.e., it measures what it purports to measure. 

2. An examination of the Test shows that on certain ques¬ 


tions the scores were:

(a) Extremely high; e.g., questions 3(a), 16(a), 18, 
and 22(a), on which the percentages of correct 
answers were respectively 99, 97, 96, and 90. 

These high percentages would seem to indicate that 
the items were too easy, and consequently the in¬ 
ference that the principles tested in these questions 
were thoroughly mastered hardljr justified. Speci¬ 
fically item 18, on which the percentage of correct 
answers was 96, involves the principle of ratio and 
proportion. Questions 4(a) and (b), 6, and 20 also 
involve proportion, but the percentages of correct 
answers were only 19 and 11, 11.5, and 13 respectively. 
In the face of this contradictory evidence it would 
hardly be fair to judge the candidates’ mastery of 

the notion of ratio and proportion as being almost 
perfect, or at the same time as being wholly inade¬ 
quate . 

(b) Extremely low; e.g., 5(c), 20, and 23, on which the 
percentages of correct answers were 2.5, 13, and 13. 
Question 3(c) should not have appeared on the Test 
at all in view of the fact that compound interest is 
scarcely touched upon in any of the courses in mathe¬ 
matics. Question 23 is a special case of "loci of 

a point", and therefore, might be considered hardly 
to be justified as a measure of the candidates’

understanding of the principle of Loci. However, 
question 25 on the Supplemental Test of August, 1940, 
also tested the understanding of Loci, it read as 
follows: 

"Mark the point P which is eouidistant from 
three line segments in the figures. Show 
construction lines used in finding the re¬ 
quired point.” 

Of the fourteen candidates whose papers were checked 
not one had answered the question correctly. There¬ 
fore, one cannot help but conclude that students on 
the whole do not understand adequately the principle 
of Loci, and that question 23 was a reliable measure 
of the principle. 

As for question 20, it may be considered as a 
reliable test of the notion of relationship and 
vairability, for although the percentage of correct 
answers was only 13, there was an equally low per¬ 
centage of correct answers on questions 4(a) and (b), 
and 6 (19%, 11% and 11.5%) which also tested the 
principle. 

3. On the whole the reliability of the Test may be in¬ 
dicated by Table Y.

in Row 1 are listed questions which appeared on the June Test, 


and in row 3 the questions on the August Supplemental lest cor¬ 
responding in the principles tested to the respective questions 
in Row 1* in Rows 2 and 4 are listed the percentages of correct 
ans??ers on the June and August papers respectively. Thus: Quest¬ 
ion 3(a), (b), (c) tested the knowledge of formulae on the June 
paper, while questions 11(a) and (b), and 12(a), tested the 
same knowledge on the August paper, and so forth. On the two 
tests the wording of the questions testing the same principle 
differed somewhat, but it was okvious from the wording what 
principle was involved. While the elose correspondence between 
the percentages of correct answers on the two tests might lead 
one to assume reliability of the tests, this assumption must be 
qualified and accepted with caution because the number of papers 
providing the statistics for the Supplemental Test was only 14— 
too small a sample from which one might draw hard and fast con¬ 
clusions. Nevertheless, the above Table does serve as a fair 
test of the reliability of the June Survey Test.

between the scores on the Mathematics Test and marks in 
Algebra 2 indicates a high degree of reliability in the 
Test itself. 

In a test attempting to measure a grasp of mathematics 
two modifications might be suggested—modifications which 
would make the test diagnostic in nature and would aid materi¬ 
ally a survey and analysis of the data furnished by the test. 

First, the questions might be so prepared and arranged 
that the principles tested would be apparent; and the answers 
so marked that the score on the Principle rather than on the 
individual questions would be shown. A total score of, say 
25, on the whole paper is of much less value diagnostically 
than would be scores on, say half a dozen, fundamental 
principles. 

Secondly, the Test might include questions of a type 
that would disclose the thinking processes and steps in¬ 
volved in their solution. They would then show wherein 
students have difficulty in mathematics in general. 

It is recognized, of course, that the Test was not 
intended to be diagnostic. Nevertheless, it is felt that 
a diagnosis of a student*s thinking processes and know¬ 
ledge of mathematics is desirable in determining the eligi¬ 
bility of that student to become a teacher.

The Need for Further Study and Investigation 

In conclusion, is it possible to say whether or not the 
Mathematics Survey Test furnishes any criterion, or criteria, 
on the basis of which teacher-selection might be made? A 
summary of some of the salient features of the analysis carried 
out in this thesis, in so far as the question suggests them, 
may serve as an answer. 

First, while it is admitted that scores on the Test 
disclose little qualitatively of the student 1 s knowledge 
of mathematics, they do tend to confirm what might be dis¬ 
closed by the marks secured on Departmental examinations in 
the high-school mathematics. What is of greater importance, 
in view of the fact that for students who do not elect 
senior mathematics teachers’ grading on the compulsory 
subjects, Algebra 1 and Geometry 1, is notoriously un¬ 
reliable, this Test with modifications as suggested might 
very well supply the information lacking with respect to 
the student’s background. 

Secondly, while the bare score gives little absolute 
information regarding the mathematical knowledge of a 
particular student, his position on a percentile scale 
of the whole group may determine his eligibility for 
admission to the Normal School. 

Lastly, the fair degree of correlation between scores 
on the Test and the Science and General Tests may serve 
to a limited extent as a criterion of the student’s ability 
in general, as well as of his ability specifically in 


mathematics

It is clear, nevertheless, that in order to establish 
the criteria we must go beyond measuring the understanding 
of mathematical and scientific principles, or even mental 
ability. We must know the candidate’s interests and atti¬ 
tudes. Above all, we must be able to find out to what ex¬ 
tent his personality is compatible with success in teaching. 
While it is true that there is some opportunity to judge 
the teacher-student in the Normal Schools on the basis of 
his personality, interests, and attitude, it would be more 
just to the student if he were judged suitable or unsuitable 
for training as a teacher before he entered the Normal > 
School, or even before he began planning his high-school 
career. Such selection and guidance would relieve many 
a heart-ache on the part of the teacher and fruitless 
effort on the part of many a pupil in an educational 
system that has barely touched the question of guidance. 

But this takes us too far from the question of Mathematics 
Survey Tests. In conclusion it may be said that the ques¬ 
tions raised throughout the thesis indicate that the whole 
field of teacher-selection can bear more investigation and 
research than has been attempted in this thesis.

HIGH SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY MATRICULATION EXAMINATIONS BOARD 

SURVEY TEST, 1940 


Ail applicants for provisional admission to Normal School are required to write on 
this test. 

Students may write on this test ONCE only. 

Notes to candidates: 

1. This is a general information test in Mathematics and Science. You have not pre¬ 
pared any assigned subject-matter for this test. The questions are selected from 
various parts of your past school courses. Do not worry if you find the paper too 
long or if you do not understand all the questions. 

2. You are not expected to answer all the questions in either section. Do your best , 
but do not delay too long on any single question or section. Answer the easy 
questions first; then, if you have time, return and do the more difficult ones. 
You may answer the questions in any order you choose. 

3. (a) Study the directions carefully as printed at the beginning of each section. 

( b ) Ask no questions. Read everything in the test very carefully. You will have 
plenty of time, but work steadily and do not waste time.

SECTION VII: A TEST OF APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES. 


THE PROBLEM: 

After pumping for considerable time, what happens when the 
piston of a lift pump is raised? 

OBSERVATION AND CONCLUSION: 

Water is raised and pours out of the spout. 

DIRECTIONS: 

Fourteen statements are given below. From these, select the 
seven which give the best scientific reasons for the conclusion pre¬ 
viously stated. Mark these seven reasons by placing an “X” on the 
line following each. 


Reasons : 

1. Lift-pump makers have designed pumps so that water can 
be obtained by pushing the handle up and down. 

2. As the air is exhausted from the pump cylinder, air pres¬ 
sure acting on the surface of the water in the well forces 
water into the barrel. 

3. The common opinion of most people is that water is lifted 
out of the cylinder. 

4. Air pressure at sea level can hold up a column of water 
thirty-four feet high. 

5. Both pump valves cannot be open at the same time. 

6. The pump would not raise water if no one worked the 
handle. 

7. To prime the pump, water must be poured around the 
piston. 

8. The fact that water is a fluid permits of transference of 
air pressure from the well water to the valves in the 
piston. 

9. Only uninformed people would say that you cannot lift 
water in a pump one hundred feet from the surface of 
the water in the well. 

10. In mountain regions, water can be raised higher above 
the level of the water in the well than at sea level because 
the air pressure is less in the mountains. 

11. Just as drinking water through a straw is the result of 
the difference in air pressure inside and outside the 
straw, so too water is raised in the lift pump by the differ¬ 
ence in pressure inside and outside the barrel of the pump. 

12. The more completely the air is removed below the piston, 
the higher the water will rise in the barrel. 

13. Pump designers try to build perfect pumps. 

14. The piston valve finally dips into the water on the down- 
stroke and admits water above the piston. The water is 
then lifted into the spout.
