SYNOPSIS 


This thesis deals with two contemporary social 
problems# It tries to find possible solutions in the 
teachings and practices, past and present, of Christianity# 
The first problem is the abolition of war, wiiich has become 
so urgent because of the destructive possibilities of modern 
warfare# The second problem deals with property and oviner- 
ship, which stands in the foregroxmd of many efforts towards 
economic reform# 

The method used is threefold# The Scriptures are 
questioned for answers, history is studied for practical 
church endeavours and contemporary proposals are examined 
critically# 

Biblical teaching has a realistic attitude regard¬ 
ing war, it is never good or just, but participation is 
imavoidable in this state of huDianity# The Churches have 
been responsible for much bloodshed and at the same time 
have hindered and limited wars# They can teach their ad¬ 
herents today, to overcome the passions which favour war 
and strengthen those groups^ which work for reforms of 
those institutions^ which make the outbreak of war inevita- 
able# 

The same threefold methodical approach v/as used 
with regard to the problem of property# The Bible looks

with favour on common property without pressing this 
pointo The temptation of property should be overcome, 
this was tried out by the first Christian congregation 
in Jerusalem# St. Thomas uses his philosophical system 
in favour of private property, which, though it is second 
best as an ideal, works better among men as they are now* 
The protestant reformers aided the rising esteem of private 
property considerably* 

Today Christianity should encourage experiments 
trying to establish new property relationships* The goal 
will be a balanced system of collective property in basic 
industries and middle-sized private property for as many 
individuals as possible*

CHAPT.ER I 


CHRISTIAN CONTRIBUTIONS 
TOWARDS THE ABOLITION OF WAR 


A. The Definition of War 

Bismarck defined war as "diplomacy by other means," 
though it might be nearer to the truth to call it "the end of 
diplomacy." The Prussian general von Klausewitz gave this 
definition: "War is an act of violence to compel our opponent 
to fulfill our will." This statement has such a wide range that 
it includes war between nations as well as civil war, undeclared 
warfare as well as legalized war. The essence of war is violence 
this is the only realistic way to describe it. Its purpose is a 
psychological one, namely to break the enemy*s will; all violence 
and destruction are only means to this end. Klausewitz considers 
war from the social point of view, "our opponent" not ‘^my enemy"; 
this avoids numerous misunderstandings. Emil Brunner^^ finds 

fault with this definition, he felt different words should be 
used, whether we want to describe a local incidence or a world¬ 
wide conflagration, the kind of war we envisage today.

3# Does Biblical Teaching Oppose ^11 Wars? 

The Old Testament 

Luther in commenting on the Old Testajuent cal]s war 
one of the greatest plagues and includes the conquest of Canaan 
in this judgment. He draws our attention to the fact that the 
Israelites did not attack the new inhabitants of Palestine. 

They first made an offer of mediation tox^rards a peaceful settle¬ 
ment. Luther has a general belief, that the losers in any war 

are always those who started the war. He gives as examples a 

2 ) 

number of war records \ The Old Testament knows nothing about 
the desirability of war, but calls it, in the words of Luther, 
"God*s wrath over the wicked"^The famous "Wars of the Lord" 
which David had to fight, he takes purely historically, thus 
taking it out of the hands of any modern propaganda machine. In 
the writings of the 7th and 8th century prophets we find an 
abhorrence of war. This has been interpreted as the beginnings 
of Biblical pacifism. Yet in this case the historical situation 
seems to be all-important. Palestine was a bxiffer state between 
the great powers of Egypt, Assyria and Babylon, which were con¬ 
tinually at war. The prophets felt that to be neutral and to 
trust in divine providence was preferable to becoming a tool of 
the great powers. However, their advice was seldom accepted and 
the period of the prophets was a time of useless bloodshed and 
national frustration, ending in the disastrous captivity of the

natlon. Besides their political common sense the prophets left 
us great visions of lasting peace* Isaiah pictures the time when 
swords will be melted into ploughshares and spears into priming- 
hooks* These visions will not be realised by human action, but 
by a great deed of God* Thus these prophetic must be 

imderstood eschatologically and find their climax in St* Peter*s 
sure hope of new Heaven and a new earth, where there dwelleth 
righteousness*” 

2# The New Testament 

There is one passage in the sermon on the mount which 
is always quoted when any discussion arrives at the topic of 
war: St. Matthew, Chapter verse 39* After having rejected 
the principle of Jewish national law, ”An eye for an eye, a tooth 
for a tooth,” Jesus says: ”But I say unto you, that ye resist 
not evil^” Prom the early Christian enthusiasts and to the Quakers 
and to Tolstoy, this commandment was interpreted as absolute 
non-resistance in case of a hostile attack* This non-resistance 
should preferably Include the whole nation or at least the Christians 
within the nation* 

Today it has often been claimed that Mahat;^a GJ^andl, 
a pagan, imderstood the intentions of Jesus better than did the 
Christians* His passive resistance campaign in India was hailed 
as an application of the sermon of the mount. It was completely 
overlooked that there is a deep difference between passive resist¬ 
ance and non-resistance* 

Furthermore, Ghandi had to deal with the British adminis¬ 
tration, which generally took a rather humane view of his efforts.

as most officials had a Christian or at least a liberal outlooko 
His campaigns would have been dompletely ineffective against 
Bolshevism; he would have been liquidated after the first try 
to resist. However, the Christian pacifists should be allowed to 
practice their convictions in case of war. They should not be 
allowed to escape from the sufferings of war altogether, even if 
it would be possible. On the European continent it has been 
customary to use this type of conscientious objector in the medical 
corps.' It is good to have these Christian pacifists in our midst, 
though their interpretation of St. Matthew, Chapter verse 39 > 
is scarcely correct. Until so far their number in comparison to 
the whole population of any western country has been small. Once 
they form the majority, resistance has become impossible. Whole¬ 
sale persecution of these Christian pacifists would be useless, 
as they undoubtedly would prefer death to an immoral life. However, 
they are right, that war is a total negation of the Christian 
ideal of brotherhood, having its source in the sinfulness of the 
human heart. Yet because of this, it is impossible for the in¬ 
dividual to escape participation in it altogether. 

The Christian ideal of a worldwide brotherhood (not only 
of the proletariat) is revolutionary, but the Christian methods 
are not. They work slowly and for many people they take too 
muoh time. Jesus used the parable of the leaven gradually pene¬ 
trating the dough and thus changing it. However, criticism of 
the slowness of Christian methods is most appropriate as the 
churches are generally rather sleepy. The Christian pacifists 
felt an effort should be made to abolish war through non-participa-

tion and national suffering® Yet it is a dangerous fallacy to 
expect anything from a national crucifixion* They argue that 
national non-resistance would melt the hearts of the most vicious 
attackers. If we allow them to carry away our children, to abuse 
our property and to employ the adult population for slavelabor, 
they will not triumphantly exploit us, but will repent and become 
our brothers. As this has never been tried in history (even the 
occupation of Denmark in World War II is no proof for it) the 
Christian pacifists are busy seducing us to try this method. 
Experiences of occupied countries during the last war prove that 
such an experiment is nothing else but national suicide. Luther 
says: "First fill the world with real Christians before you can 
behave in an evangelical manner; if you behave as if the world is 
Christian already, it is like putting sheep and wolves in one 
fold"^^ (Gospel sermon 23rd Sunday after Trinity). St. Thomas 
and Calvin frequently express the same opinion. Ihe deeper 
reason why no nation can overcome the enemy by love lies in the 
moral Imperfection of its population. It is altogether out of 
place to compare the historical sacrifice of Christ, the truly 
innocent for the guilty, with any necessarily half-hearted 
national sacrifice. 

In stressing the sermon the mount the Christian 
objectors against war tried to overlook other New Testament 
passages dealing with the same subject. When John the Baptist 
was interviewed by soldiers in service as to what they should 
do to become members of the Kingdom of God, he did not advise

them to leave the army® He told them only to be satisfied with 
their pay and to abstain from looting and terrorizing the civilian 
population. It is historically true that some Christian synods 
excommunicated soldiers. Yet this was not done because of an 
ungodly occupation, but because of the far reaching oath of 
allegiance which they had to swear. It was considered to be 
incompatible with loyalty toi>?ards Christ, The office of a soldier 
was never to be regarded as dishonorable in itself; Paul often 
used metaphors depicting the soldier’s life and weapons. If the 
interpretation of nonresistance would be correct Jesus did not 
behave properly before Pilate, for he did not turn the other cheek, 
and Stephan did not, who very vehemently resisted his accus'ors, 
and Paul did not, who demanded his right as a Roman citizen be¬ 
fore the governor Jilyraas, Thus the use of isolated scripture 
passages does not give us sufficient insight to draw authorita¬ 
tive conclusions, 

Sven the famous word ‘*A11 that take a sword shall perish 
by the sword** is not conclusive, St, ‘i'homas says ’*A11 that take 
the sword without having public authority to do so, shall perish,” 
Therefore we must look for the underlying principle s concerning 
war as we find them in the Hew Testament, If we seek diligently, 
we find two doctrines, which stand in tension to each other, 
namely the doctrines of the law and the gospel* 

According to the moral law ” what man sows, that he 
shall reap,” Jesus must proclaim the punitive justice of God 
over Capernaum and a war of complete destruction over Jerusalem, 

The theologians used to call this his opus alienum. This prin-

ciple of punitive justice is still at work in our midsto It is 
at least a partial explanation of why war has not been abolished. 
The real task of Christ however, his opus proprium, is the 
proclamation of the gospel. I'he gospel is the love of Crod towards 
a hostile world. The Christian reflects this love in his life 
in a twofold way: Regarding war in the personal realm, love ex¬ 
pressed itself as non-resistance. The term personal realm 
describes man in his lonely relationship with himself and with 
his God. In other words, this personal sphere is only a small 
sector of man*s life, a rule man has numerous associations 

and that includes at once obligations towards other human beings. 
Here love expresses itself as an activity, it seeks the welfare 
of its objects. St. Thomas points out that in doing so "one deed 
can have a double effect." A mother, protecting her child, might 
have to kill a vicious animal. A father, defending his household 
from a burglar, might be forced to do the latter bodily harm. 

In other words, we must always consider the end for which an 
agent is active. Luther said once "it is childish to see the 
slaying only in the soldier’s office, we must see the end of his 
office, which is peace. In this regard we may compare a soldier 
with a surgeon operating; we do not consider the amputation of a 
finger as such, but the restoration of health"^)o 

In Interpreting the sermon of the mount with regard to 
war, Calvin is a good disciple of Luther; in his polemics with 
the anabaptists, who were pacifists, he writes:

’’Pinally they conclude that all use of arms is a diabolical 
thing. Now it is true that the use of the sword ought 
not to be permitted by any private individual, to make 
resistance to evil; for the arms of Christians are prayer 
and meekness, to possess their lives in patience and to 
overcome evil by doing good, according to the doctrine of 
the gospel. The duty then of each of us is to suffer 
patiently if some outrage is done to us, not to use force 
and violence. But to condemn the public use of the sword, 
which God has ordained for our protection, is blasphemy 
against God himself. -According to the spirit of C^od, 
uttered by St. Paul, the magistrate is a servant of God in 
our behalf, to repress and curb the violence of the wicked. 
The sword is placed in his hand to punish malefactors. 

Since God orders him to do this, who are we to hinder him?... 
Furthermore, it is clear that it is the intention of these 
poor fanatics to condemn all munitions, fortresses, bearing 
of arms, and all such things which make for the defense 
of the coimtry: and to prevent subjects from obeying their 
princes and superiors when they want these to be used in 
time of need .••• lut let us remember that it is to usurp 
the authority of God to condemn as bad what our Lord has 
permitted to us. He never forbade the use of arms to 
princes, to maintain their peace among those who molest 
them wrongfully: the Scripture does not say so**o)^ 

We said before: ’*Love seeks the welfare of its objects," 
what has happened today is that we include wider objects into 
our love. We are not only concerned with our family, our business, 
our city, or our* state; these objects are all fairly narrow ones. 

As soon as we include science, art, religion, and in our political 
goals h-umanity as a whole, the objects of our love become world¬ 
wide. The difficulty for the average man consists, that these 
objects in their worldwide aspect cannot be observed any longer, 
but must be imagined. Our imagination still seems to be unable 
to accomplish this. Or to put it into other words, we have a 
deeper feeling of guardianship, as Jesus had it in regard to his 
disciples, to "the little ones" (the children), and to the people 
of Israel with a special care for "the beloved city" Jerusalem.

Once we get a global feeling of guardianship, world wars become 
emotionally pretty difficulto 

We mentioned already Galvin's interpretation of war. 

We may add that St. Thomas in commenting on the sermon of the 
mount, does not consider it as a generally binding commandment, 
but as an evangelical counsel for the religious people, that 
means for a few only* Luther's attitude has often been misunder¬ 
stood and only recently he has been bitterly assailed by Dean 
Inge as a forerunner of Bismarck and Hitler. He distinguishes 
between man for himself and man in office. ”See, we talk not 
about the Christian in relation, not about the Christian in his 
lonely position before God, but bound in this life to another 
person, who is under him or next to him or above him, as for 
example Master or Mistress, wife, child, neighbour, etc., where 
one owes it to the other to protect and guard him wherever 
possible*'* Man does not act against God's will if he uses 
force and resists evil. He acts in his office which is a divine 
ordinance. All these ordinances have been established out of 
love and as an opportunity for loving. To realize their goal 
they must be at the same time ordinances of force. Luther asks 
the question "Shall a father never punish his child?** He answers 

"This would be a terrible cruelty, you could call it even murder, 

■ ^ 

if a father always leaves his child unpunished, it is just as if 
he would strangle it with his hands"®). Once Luther talked in a

llghter mood about the right of war: ’*If the Turk attacks us, 
what he is not supposed to do, and yet we cannot stop him, 
should we send him theologians as ambassadors, who explain to 
him: ’*You may not fight, else we must condemn you?" and then 
must we allow him to destroy us and as a consolation we claim 
that we are really the victors?"^) Luther distinguishes between 
the true Christian who is a citizen of the kingdom of ^od and 
those people who are only citizens of this world# The first is 
essentially good as a husband, who loves his wife, knows without 
reflection what good he can do for her# These Christians do not 
need the sword or laws# They are guided by the Holy Spirit and 
among them is no danger that the peace will be disturbed# 

But among the children of the world it is different# 

They are still being guided by the devil# They are driven by 
the urge to kill, which Luther so often describes as the essence 
of natural man# They would devour each other, if God had not 
instituted among them government, sword and law, and the ordinances 
which look after these divine commands# Luther knows that no 
person is naturally pious# Thus government, sword, laws and or¬ 
dinances receive their authority in this world. And even if 
here and there would be real Christians, they must suffer these 
ordinances because of the weaker brother# "The Christian shall 
not resist evil, but a Christian in office shall resist all evil"^^). 

The ordinances of this world are not evil even if they 
originated through the fall of man, but everything depends upon

the attitude which I have while acting in and through these ordin¬ 
ances o My attitude can make them good or bad. I'he fact that I 
act in office does not free me from moral responsibilityo '-^‘he 
reformers addressed themselves frequefatly to the rulers and magis¬ 
trates to admonish them in Christian conduct, yet Luther was very 
pessimistic about the kings of his time, "a good king is a strange 
bird in heaven.'* 

Willingly man should fulfill his duties which the or¬ 
dinances of this world demand of him. In doing so, he should not 
think of himself, his profit and his honor, but should exclusively 
be concerned with his fellowman. -^s soon as it affects myself 
and my cause, I must be willing to bring any sacrifice. ’*Thus 
both things go nicely together, that you satisfy the Kingdom of 
God and the Kingdom of the world, that you siiffer evil and at 
the same time that you punish evil, that you resist evil and at 
the same time do not resist it. F'or at one time you consider 
yourself and your cause, at the other time you consider your 
fellowman and his affairs, -^s far as it concerns you, you follow 
the gospel and you suffer Injustice like a real Christian; as far 
as your fellowman is concerned you follow the principle of love 
and you do not tolerate injustice for him"^^). 

All the three great theologians, ^t. I'homas, Luther, 
Calvin, have an abhorrence towards war, yet following the teach¬ 
ing of the New Testament they know that war, never being desir¬ 
able, still is always probable, because of the deep spiritual

dlsimity of mankind* As much as a Christian will loath it, he 
will not be able to escape from it* War is a constant challenge 
asking for a solution* 

C* Christian Ethical Thinking -dealing with War* 

The Christian attitude towards war has been largely 

12 ) 

molded by St* Augustine* In his fundamental book ’*De civitate Dei” 
he enumerates the following 5 points: 

1* God appointed to wage wars in the past* 'i'hls statement, 
though historically correct, is not very helpful for the present 
problems, because it would be a dangerous fallacy to take events 
of the past and simply project them into the future* 

2* The attacker must be compared with a murderer and should 
be treated accordingly* This second principle led to much 
hypocrisy# nobody had the courage any longer to be an honest 
attacker, but clothed his villainy in the garb of innocent self- 
defense* 

3o Non-resistance is inconsistent with public policy* St* 

Thomas comments d/V this point: ^Resist not evil does not require 
from us, to do mischief by allowing wickedness to go unpunished**' 
i|.* St* Augustine explains the turning of the cheek as an 
inward disposition of goodwill towards the Jgressor* To illustrate 
this, if the stressor in battle would be wounded and becomes 
helpless, we will not go in for the kill, but become like the 
good Samaritan*

5# St. Augustine says: ”War is a means-to the end of peace;** 

and peace: ’*Is the tranquility of order” (St. Thomas). 

From St. Augustine we get the classification of wars 

into two groups: The just and the iinjust wars. The just war 

equals the defensive war and the unjust war equals the attacking 

war. This classification is really an alien thought in St. 

Augustine*s doctrine of universal hujnan depravity; don*t we all 

fall short of the glory we should have before God? (Romans III, 21.) 

St. Thomas elaborates the principle of the just war. 

13) 

He puts down three conditions: 

1. There must be a definite legal authority to declare war. 

This might have been common sense in his time, especially to avoid 
the nuisance of private wars, but today wars are either never 
declared or the declaration follows a few days after hostilities 
have begun. 

2. The war must have a just cause, '*that is, that those who 
are attacked for some offense merit such treatment.” This is a 
very vague statement and has some similarity to a blank cheque. 

3. The belligerent must have right intentions, “either of 
achieving some good objects or of avoiding some evil.” This 
sounds like common sense, yet John K. Ryan, a modern disciple of 
Sto Thomas, criticizes the philosopher on this point. He says: 
”Right Intentions are a subjective element determined by consci¬ 
ence, they must be weighed by objective standards of justice and 
charity. iW ** 

^^^Summa Theologla 22, Question i}.0* 

^^^John K. Ryan, Modern Wap and Basic Ethics, Milwaukee, Bruce Ed., 
page 5i|.. 





As decisions about war have to be made today in a very 
short period of time, how can the people make up their minds 
whether the cause is just and the intentions of their government 
right? How can the people get to all the facts involved in modern 
politics? Ryan points to the shocking discdveries which every 
nation makes once a war is ended* There yawns a deep gulf between 
wartime beliefs, which drove many to bring the highest sacrifices, 
and the post-war knowledge of shabby politics* It might take 
fifty years and longer to make any valid decisions about the 
justice of a cause and the right intentions of governments* 

The Finnish Russian war (1939"40) is only too good an 
example* After the negotiations in Moscow had failed, it seemdd 
that jTistice and right intentions were completely on the Finnish 
side* The Finnish cause had a tremendous emotional appeal, not 
only in Finland and the neighbouring Scandinavian countries, 
but all over the Western World* Here at least was a clear case, 
where on the one side everything was white, and on the other 
side everything was black* However, ten years later, at the 
time of general hysteria with regard to Russia, we must acknow¬ 
ledge that the Kremlin had a relatively just cause for war* It 
might even have quoted Luther: ”lf war threatens, you must not 
wait imtil the enemy invades your country, but you should meet 
him when he is still far away, or even in his own territory* 

The brave Finnish soldiers who fought desperately during 
the spring offensive, died for a government which was a secret ally

of Hitler*3 foreign policy to find living space for an overcrowded 
Germany (Drang nach dem Osten). Left by the West, left by Germany, 
forsaken by their Scandinavian brothers, death must have been 
hard for these heroic men; let us hope they perished in the belief 
that theirs was a just war* The two protestant reformers did not 
contribute anything that is essentially new in the classification 
of wars. Luther classif^s them into: 

1* Wars of desire, whose author is the devil* 

2. Wars of self-protection, which do not have God as their 
author, as some pious people might imagine, but which he calls a 
human misfortime* 

Calvin was too much of a realist to be captivated by 
the glaraoiir of war, and he recognized clearly its evils* He 
comments upon ’*that fierceness idiich is often found in the military 
profession, and which is utterly unbecoming to the servants of 

Urging the elect to greater fidelity in the midst of 
persecution and forced migration, he exhorts them to show more 
courage than mercenaries who undergo all manner of hardship in 
war to serve the devil# He recognized and deplored the unchristian 
character of war*s accompaniments, "the cruelties, thefts, re¬ 
prisals, acts of violence, extortions, and other such unholy deeds 
which are committed in it*" In a measure, he realized its ineffect¬ 
iveness for he remarks that "we are not at all surprised ’ when a 
war is finished, if it begins over again right away"^^^^

The classification of v;ars into just and unjust has 
led Christian ethical thinking astray* In all huraan affairs 
there is only a relative justice, and **we do not live by our 
deeds, but through the forgiveness of them*’* (Karl Barth, G^edo)* 

A far better division might have been the statement that war is 
always a choice between two evils* Ihe question wo uld Be: '*Is 
war the lesser evil?" **0r peace the greater one?’* Before the 
^ar of liberation (l8l3) the people in Germany encouraged each 
other with the slogan: 

"Better an end with losses (meaning hioman life) 
than loss without end*" (meaning loss of liberty) 

It is true that when war is presented as a choice between two 
evils, there is still the risk of a faulty judgment* But the 
whole atmosphere is much clearer, the danger of hypocrisy is 
lessened, everybody knows, that we are in for terrible times, 

"Blood, sweat and tears*" 

Because of the terrific consequences that will accompany 
an erroneous judgment, suggestions have been made that no war 
should be declared or no aggression resisted without having 
first conducted a popular referendum* This was taken quite serious¬ 
ly in the twentieth, but in^the time of the "Blitzkrieg" this 
sounds ridiculous* ¥e depend completely on the social conscious¬ 
ness of our public leaders, who often within an hour or so have 
to make far reaching global decisions. More than ever, general 
elections have become of the utmost importance, and the elector 
must withstand the temptation to prefer as his choice "the jolly 
good fellow" before "the conscientious statesman*"

ticularly true in the United States, which has twice within thirty 
years won the war and lost the peace. Lofty ideals, worth fight¬ 
ing and dying for, have been put before the people, and the results 
have been disappointing. Naturally this let-down is nothing new 
in the history of nations, particularly after a war. Luther tried 
to solve this conflict in his famous pamphlet "Whether soldiers 
too can be saved"^^^» 

"If you are \mcertain about the war think the best of 
your Lord^s intentions, but if your lord is wrong in going to 
war, refuse to go*" In times where a wrong decision of our 
statesmen can lead to a national disaster, the question of par¬ 
ticipation in war must remain a matter of conscience. I'his 
critical attitude of the population will be one of the most 
efficient brakes to stop rash decisions, but might at the same 
time be a real monkeywrench thrown into the machinery of total 
warfare. A. M. Rehwinkel in "The Christian and Government”^^^ 
writes: 

"Participation in war is a matter of conscience. We admit 
this in the l6th article of the Augsburg Confession* But 
wars have become more sweeping in implications and consequ¬ 
ences since the adoption of that article* If it was a matter 
of conscience then, it most certainly must be now. But 
today governments conscript all citizens, Christians and 
non-Christians, able to do war service and no one can escape 
from the support of war with his taxes. Once war is de¬ 
clared by those in power, Christian and non-Christian alike 
are compelled to kill, destroy helpless women and children, 
wield the most horrible weapons of destruction ever devised 
by man for the annihilation of entire cities, and he has no 
chance to inquire whether the cause for which he must destroy 
the lives and habitations of fellow human beings is a just 
and righteous cause* To kill a man or a woman and a child 
without a just cause is murder, and no glamour of war can

chang© that* To take or destroy the property of another is 
a violation of the seventh commandment, and that is still a 
commandment in God*s holy Decalog, and no government can 
abrogate God’s own laws* With the coming of atomic and 
hydrogen bombs the question of war has become a most serious 
matter for the consciences of the individual Christian and 
of the Christian churches*” 

The freedom of conscience to decide whether to partake 
in war or refuse to do so, is the main contribution of Christian 
ethical thinking©

CHAPTER II 

CHRISTIAN ACCOMPLISHMENTS 


D* What Did the Nominally Christian Middle Ages Accomplish 

With Regard to War? 

A mere contribution of thought regarding war is not enough 
for the church* At a time when everybody called himself a Christian, 
at least nominally, and when the power of the state could be used 
for Christian goald, we should expect the theoretical contribution 
to have been realized in life* However, a great disappointment 
awaits us* Christianity was one of the main causes for war* 

We can observe this in the crusades, in the fight for 
supremacy between Popes and Emperors, and in the so-called religious 
wars* Let us consider the first mistake, the crusades* It is true, 
the Muslims were the attackers, and the Christians had to defend 
their way of life; it is true, that the Muslims were intolerant, 
making pilgrimages to the Holy Places first difficult and later 
impossible* Still, this was no excuse for the Christians to allow 
an outbreak of emotional religion, with all the ugliness that 
follows when the mob-mind raises ils sinister head, to let thousands 
of children march imprepared and thus to perish in the snow of the 
Balkan mountains* 

All the crusades failed, though the best theologians 
stood behind them as, for example, Bernard of Clairveaus* The 
results of these unfortunate attempts were thoroughly bad* The 
spirit of gain and adventure, imtil then checked by the church, got 
free hand and has never been controlled again* 


Early capitalism is an imwanted child of 







-20- 


the crusades, though true Marxists might see it the other way 
aroundo The military orders were created to provide the man¬ 
power for these shortlived conquests. With the cessation of the 
crusades new fields of activity had to be found for them. The 
Teutonic knights were transplanted into eastern Europe^ and it can 
be said, that Prussia was born in Jerusalem. 

Already at Luther’s time the evil effects were clearly 
seen. As a new wave of Turkish aggression rolled as far as Vienna, 
Luther wrote his pampjilet ’*0n war against the Turk’*^^o The main 
points are: 

1 . This is a war between the Emperor and the Turkish ^ultan. 

2. The church should not mix itself in this war by calling 
for a crusade. 

3o Instead, the church should realize that the aggressive 
Turk is the devil’s servant and God’s rod to punish its severe 
failings. 

I 4.0 To beat the Turks’ god, namely the devil, there must 
first be a sincere repentance. 

5o Luther goes so far as to warn against resistance, if 
there has been no general profound change. This sound attitude 
was misunderstood by his theological adversaries, who suggested 
that he was in secret agreement with the enemy and tried to under¬ 
mine the national fighting spirit. These suggestions were more 
than once hiirled against Christian churches during the last war, 
as they insisted that victory without preceding and visible 
repentance was meaningless.

There is always danger that somebody would change a war 
into a crusade or proclaim it as a holy affair* But holiness 
means '*to be without spot or wrinkles," which cannot be said 
about any human affair* Even Hitler withstood the temptation 
to call his attack against Russia a crusade but somehow this 
concept has a strangely suggestive power and it is still with 
us® 


One of the latest warnings comes from Reverend Martin 

2) 

Niemoller, who said: 

"I am directing myself exclusively against the frequently 
heard statement that a war against Bolshevism is necess¬ 
ary in order to save Christianity and the Christian Church* 
It is un-Christian, however, to carry on war for the piu?- 
pose of preserving the Christian Church, for the Ch-urch 
is not in need of being saved* She has no fear of Bol¬ 
shevism because she has the promise that even the gates 
of hell shall not prevail against her* She is rather to 
serve, with her message, the Communists as well as all men, 
while she rejects Coramimism as a doctrine of salvation as 
well as all other doctrines of salvation* Coramvinisra, 
however, must and may be opposed only with spiritual weapons 
and lifted out of its joints* All application pf power will 
prove in vain* The great sorrow of the West results from 
the fact that until now it has not been in a position to 
oppose Bolshevism with a spiritual power and a spiritual 
dynamic* The Church of our day, which so emphatically 
stresses peace, does so on accomt of human beings who 
again are in danger of being sacrificed for allegedly 
"higher purposes" and hurled into misery* According to 
Christian teaching, a so-called "higher piirpose" does not 
exist because Jesus Christ died and rose again not for in¬ 
discriminate higher purposes, but for men* And, Indeed, 

0-11 men: good and bad, just and unjust, capitalists 
and Commimists, democrats and National Socialists*" 


Another source for constant fighting was a continual 
conflict between Popes and Emperors* Today the Pope has tried 
to become an arbiter of peace, to be present at the international 
conference table* However, the mediaeval record of the Papacy

wlth regard to war is so poor, that the Popes seem to be forever 
disqualified for this high office. We should have no romantic 
feelings about the "universal culture," this shortlived synthesis, 
which was destroyed in the fights for supremacy between secuilar 
and spiritual power. 

However, the greatest blunders of Christianity were the 
religious wars which devastated Germany and Prance. There it 
was tried to decide the question (What is truth?) by military 
power* Though Frederic the Great lived nearly two centuries 
later, the clergy seemed to believe in his sarcastic saying: 

"God is always on the side of the stronger battalions." 

Behind these religious struggles stood the theology of 
intolerance. St. Thomas compared an heretic with a forger, 
thus putting him in the ranks of criminals, deserving a severe 
punishment. The evil deed of a forger cheated people out of 
some money, a purely earthly affair, but the heretic robbed 
people of their eternal salvation. 

Calvin thought along the same lines, only he called the 
heretic a blasphemer, thus opening the way for the death penalty 
according to Old Testament Law. It is true, that neither the 
Roman nor the Reformed chiu’ch killed heretics, this job was 
always delegated to the worldly powers. This is a very nice 
judicial distinctinn, which could scarcely appeal very much to 
the burning "unbeliever." 

The young Luther tried to accomplish everything by "the 
WORD only", but his royal followers soon found this procedure 
too cumbersome. Therefore at the end of his life Luther was put

imder pressure and followed the traditional teaching of the 
Middle Ages, that the State has the task to protect and to expand 
’*the true religion*’* 

After incredible bloodshed, x^hile cruelties were permitted 
which were never heard before, the intellectual world got tired 
and disgusted with this spectacle and gave up the search for 
right doctrine altogether* Thus these religious wars invited 
the age of tolerance, meaning in most cases the age of indiffer¬ 
ence* There seemed to be little connection between l 6 th and 
17 th century Christianity and the Christ as He is portrayed in 
the Gospelso 

E* Christianity has been Successful in Trying to Humanize Warfare * 

The preceding paragraphs throw a rather dark light upon 
Christianity and the problem of war* Yet Christianity has been 
able to overcome the ’*Vae Victis’* of the Romans and has for some 
time successfully humanized warfare* 

The churchmen of the early Middle Ages had to face the 
teutonic Barbarians, who enjoyed the excitement of war, the rich 
spoil, considering warfare as a normal occupation of a male human 
being* The bishops could not altogether extinguish the fight¬ 
ing spirit, but they accomplished one difficult goal? that war 
had to be fought under rules. Under certain circumstances, 
mainly following the idea of St. Augustine, war was a completely 
legal affair* The Pax Dei Synod of Elene 1027 did not only 
accept a number of resolutions, but enforced them too* Among 
the prohibitions we find: No fighting in winter, no fighting

‘ !'^ 






during Holy days (and there were innumerable Church festivals 
during the Middle Ages), no fighting in Jubilee years, places 
of refuge to be respected by all belligerents and, last but not 
least, the arbitration of the Church. 

Gellert-^' finds this Church system quite effective, and 
quotes numerous occasions where frictions, which might have led 
to war, were successfully settled by the Church authoritieso 

The Russian philosopher Berdaiev claims that we are on 
the threshold of a new Middle Age, meaning an universal culture 
under the leadership of Christianity* He is hopeful, too, that 
this would lead to the abolition of war* Unfortunately, the 
new barbarians of today are not only outside of the Church, as 
in the time of St* -Augustine, but they are right within her. 
Under the battleery of ”Internal evangelism’* the Church has 
tried to convert them, but so far in vain* There seems to be 
little hope that the new barbarians will stand reverently before 
the bishop, who meets them outside of the city, imploring them 
to show mercy, to regain self control, and to become a member 
of the large Christian family. The Christian Church of the 
twentieth century has as many courageous men and therefore' 
martyrs as the early Church^ hovjever the seed of the seven 
thousand slain priests in Russia has not germinated yet| whether 
it ever will, we do not know* 

The many years of confinement in a concentration camp 
in Dachau of the Reverend Martin Niemoller or his marvelous 
deliverance by American troops, did not bring the new barbarians

in Germany back to their Churcho Dr. Niemoller became a hero 
in a Hollywood movie, but the real purpose of his life is still 
unaccomplished. 

Leaving the Middle Ages we come to the great reformed 
theologian Hugo Grotlus, who was not alone in his work to limit 
war, but was supported by practically all Christian Churches. 
Gradually the limitations he set up were accepted by most civil¬ 
ized countries and laid down by international law. A distinction 
was made between the non-combatant population and the army. War 
was considered to be a fight between soldiers, and the population 
should be spared from as much suffering as possible. Private 
property was ’’Sacrosanct." Looting was out of the question, if 
any property had to be used by the invading army, it had to be 
paid for. Even public property could not be destroyed, unless 
it had a definite military value. 

A further distinction was made between the fighting 
soldier and the wounded or captured soldier. It was felt that 
the right to injure the enemy is not unlimited, the soldier 
must have a chance to escape death; weapons that destroy every¬ 
body, weapons which cannot be resisted, were outlawed. A good 
example of the latter case is the use of poison gas, and the 
atom bomb falls into the same category. 

This legal system of limiting war and thus humanizing 
it, was imdermined by many breaches during World War I| it broke 
down in World War II. 

Virgil Gheorghiu expresses this in his book "The Twenty- 
Fifth Hour": "In contemporary Society human sacrifice is no 
longer considered worth mentioning - it is commonplace. Human

life is valuable only as a source of energy; the criterion is 
exclusively scientific* That is the terrible law of our tech¬ 
nological barbarism. It will reign supreme after the total 
victory of the mechanical slaves. Man will be fettered by 
technocracy for a very long time to come - but he will not die 
in chains. Technological civilization can create comforts, but 
it cannot create the spirit.** 

A few examples, chosen at random, of how 1 ±ie Churches 
tried to limit warfare in the second world war, might prove that 
they tried to face the issue squarely* 

The Church of England protested to the Allied High 
Command against the saturation bombings of German cities. The 
Church did this at a time -when the ruins of British cities were 
still smouldering from recent attacks. Church, within its 

own ranks, overcame the natui^al iirge for revenge, pointing out 
the barbarism of these saturation raids and their consequences 
for the victor once the war was won. The history of the last 
five years has justified the verdict of the Church, the victors 
have to rebuild the cities they destroyed and to feed the popula¬ 
tion^ who have been robbed of their means of production. 

The arguments of the Church of England were a mixture of 
Christianity and utilitarianism and did not change the decision 
of the high command. The clergy might have accomplished their 
purpose, if they had remembered and published their parish experi¬ 
ence, that bombing raids in most cases strengthened the determina¬ 
tion of the population to fight on instead of breaking their morale.

Both morally and strategically they followed the right track, 
because the efficacy of air bombing is largely debatable* ’*It 
is a fact that, in spite of all our bombing of Germany, Hitler’s 
war production kept increasing up to the summer of 194-4-> 
multiplied nearly three times between the winter of 1941“4-2 and 
D-day, 1944 * ^y the end of 194 ^ total German production was 
reduced by only some 20%, although their cities lay in ruins 

The Amerlcan-Lutheran-Conference stood behind the child- 
feeding program of ex-president Herbert Hoover. This program 
was rejected by the British High Command and many Lutheran 
ministers were henceforth considered to be disloyal, because 
they backed a humanitarian project which might have saved the 
health of thousands of children. 

The Confederation of Dutch Churches made an effort to 
protect the Jews in Holland, who were not too popular among the 
Dutch population. Though their efforts could not stop the cold¬ 
blooded mass murder of a national minority, they endangered 
their own lives and became one of the centers of resistance. 

The confessing Church in Germany succeeded in the winter 
of 194-4-“4-5 delaying the gassing of so-called "useless persons" 
(invalids. Incurables, insane and old people) who were later 
liberated by the western armies. At the end of hostilities the 
same Church proposed a confession of a common war-guilt, which 
was not accepted by the churches in the victorious countries. It 
seems today that a great opportunity for humiliation was missed 
and, instead of understanding and mutual forgiveness, the spirit 
of national arrogance and deceit did flourish again.

P. The Characteristics of Modern ^ar » 

Before we can consider the endeavors of Christianity 
to abolish modern war, we must point out its specific character- 
istlcs» 

lo The Prussian general, von Klausewitz, observed the great 
break in the science of warfare* After the defeat of Napoleon 
the mass armies, which had to be drafted to achieve this goal, 
were not released, but remained. The small mercenary force had 
become an institution of the past* Whenever the three great 
theologians - St. Thomas, Luther and Calvin - discuss war, they 
have this institution before their eyes* As it does not exist 
any longer, it is rather dangerous to return to their ideas and 
to repeat them uncritically* 

2 o The use of explosives and the mechanization of the troops 
means total war* This phrase ”total war** has a different mean¬ 
ing whether it is used by a VJestern or a totalitarian strategist* 
In the West it means a total effort of the whole population, of 
all the means of production, a total mobilization* For a total¬ 
itarian strategist it means all this and the unlimited use of 
the war machinery; moral limitations are definitely antiquated 
when he conducts a war* 

3 o Every military conflict today has a tendency to become 
world wide* Emil Brunner in his "The Divine Imperative"^^ des¬ 
cribes the global war of today as follows: 

^^Philadelphia, Pa*: Westminster Press, p* I|- 70 *

"Owing to the substitution of a national army for a mercen¬ 
ary army, to the introduction of mechanical and chemical 
methods of warfare, and to the close-knit character of all 
the economic spheres throughout the world, war has now be¬ 
come a method which cannot any longer be reckoned as an 
item in any political reckoning of gain or loss* The idea 
of "winning a war" still plays its old disastrous part in 
the popular mind, but it no longer has any place in reality. 
In modern warfare all are conquered and none are victors; 
in modern warfare there is no longer any "non-combatant 
population." If war were to break out at the present time, 
it is extremely uncertain whether the idea of "fighting in 
defense of one’s country" would have any meaning at all. 

It is quite possible that in the "next war" the soldiers 
in the lower ranks would enjoy the largest measure of pro¬ 
tection, compared with the rest of the population. Some 
decades ago war may have been an instrument which, although 
it was brutal, could be used to resolve intolerable inter¬ 
national tension; but today, owing to the fact that it 
cannot be controlled, it has lost even this shred of utility. 
It seems highly probable that the next war would consiirae 
the whole of the material and vital energies of the nations 
of Europe, or of the civilized world, to such an extent 
that it would be no exaggeration to describe it as a pro¬ 
cess of "bleeding to death." In view of this fundamental 
change in what lArar means, it is impardonably superficial 
to try to justify war by means of pictures of the wars of 
the past with all their glamour and romance. The Christian 
in particular has no right to live in the past. He in 
particular ought to know that modern vjarfare means such a 
complicated mechanism for the destruction of material, 
vital, physical and spiritual goods, such an exhausting 
process of bloodletting, in which the most valuable blood 
of all the nations is wasted, such a technical business, 
which has become entirely divorced from all the ancient 
"manly virtues", and an international disaster of such vast 
proportions whose effects cannot be calculated, of equal 
horror for the victors and for the vanquished and, through 
the fact that it involves the defenseless civil population 
- women and children - is such a radically imchivalrous 
method of international strife, that all that used to be 
said in its favor, vjith some amount of justification, has 
today lost all validity. The development of the technique 
of warfare, the heightening of war’s intensity, and its 
enormous extension has led to a point where war becomes 
race suicide. Wa^ has outlived itself. It has become so 
colossal that it can no longer exercise any sensible func¬ 
tion. To expect to establish any just order by means of 
a conflagration - called war - has become a political 
madness. "

Unfortunately Brunner has become a prisoner of his own 
terminology, that war always means ‘*a world-wide conflagration,** 
that his view for facts has been darkened* There have been 
victors in the war of independence between Indonesia and the 
Netherlands, and between Palestine and the Arab League. Brunner*s 
whole description holds true only for the war between the great 
powers* 

4* Another characteristic of twentieth century war is 
its permanent condition. The main cause for this phenomenon 
can be found in the "science** of communism. Its philosophy 
centers around three laws, the first one is known as the law of 
the dialectic, which is not important for our purposes. The 
second is called the law of negation, which is very important 
for the permanence of war. Engels and Marx pointed out that 
a living body, which acquires new cells, must have some of the 
old ones die. The most familiar analogy they used is that of a 
grain of barley. VJhen this is put into the ground, the grain 
dies and ceases to exist. In its place there grows a plant. 
Eventually the stalk dies too. In its place we get a handful of 
new seed. This principle is applied by Marxism to all of life. 

It is used to explain the quantitative increase of reality with¬ 
out appealing to some cause outside of the matter itself. Pro¬ 
gress in the social order works in the same way. New life is 
born of death and destruction* 

The third is the law of transformation. This is a 
corollary of the law of negation. It is based on the observa¬ 
tion that the quantitative development of a reality often results 

in the production of an entirely new form.

Let us take water for an example. At thirty-two degrees 
Fahrenheit it suddenly becomes ice, a new kind of substance. 

In the same way at a given point, namely at 212 degrees Fahren¬ 
heit, and by a leap, water turns to steam. The classic example 
usually cited to demonstrate this matter of the leap is the 
following: One atom of carbon and four of hydrogen make methane; 

if one atom of carbon and two of hydrogen are added, we get an 
entirely new substance, ethane; add another atom of carbon and 
tvjo of hydrogen and the leap will produce propane; add once 
more and lentane results; add again, and pentane is produced. 

Their concept of the leap in matter is of great signifi¬ 
cance in an understanding of commimlsra. From it is derived its 
whole theory of revolution, of leaps in social order. Revolu¬ 
tion is justified by commimists on their principle that the laws 
of nature not only allow it but demand it. In spite of these 
laws communism became successful abroad only after it joined 
with the ideology of Russian Imperialism, using the Red Army 
as a spearhead for its ‘^revolution.” 

The term "permanent revolution" h^d a two-fold meaning 
in Marxist phraseology. It meant: 

1. to join the liberal revolution of l8i|.8, whose goal was 
very different from the communist, hoping to use the tiirmoil which 
generally accompanies upheavals for communistic purposes. 

2. to arrange for revolutions until the globe was under 
communistic influence. This opinion was represented by G. 

Trotsky, who was exiled and later murdered in Mexico, yet it 
is doubtful whether his viewa died with him.

The relationship between permanent revolution and per¬ 
manent war is obvious; the communistic revolutionary forces 
within every country serve two purposesJ they lead to inter¬ 
ference from the communistic countries and are a powerful weapon 
in themselves (’*the fifth column”)* 

Some circles in the U.S.A. try to use the idea of the 
permanent revolution for their own pijrposes* ‘I'hey call the 
American rebellion *^a permanent revolution in the affairs of 
men;” they quote R. W. Emerson, ”the office of America is to 
liberate,” giving to all people inalienable rights, which re¬ 
flect the laws of nature, namely life, liberty and the pursuit 
of happiness. 

Fascism and Nazism tried to counteract the communistic 
movement by becoming more warlike® They nearly verbally copied 
its philosophy, that war is a permanent condition, yet added a 
distinctly religious flavor. ”ll Duce” or ”Der Fuiirer” are men 
out of this world, surely sent by divine providence, with a 
mission similar to 3t. George, namely to conquer the wicked red 
dragon. This conquest usually gets the name of a Holy Crusade 
and is supposed to give meaning to the ”hum-drum” existence of 
most individuals® 

With this thought Conrad Heyden concludes his well-known 
work ”Der Fuhrer”: 

”Hitler was able to enslave his own people because he 
seemed to give them something that even the traditional 
religions could no longer provide: the believe in a meaning 
to existence beyond the narrowest self-interest® The 
problem today is to give that larger significance and dignity 
to a life that has been dwarfed by the world of material 
things. Until that problem is solved, the annihilation of 
Nazism will be no more than the removal of one symptom of 
the world’s unrest.”

Nazism and Fascism were only a bad copy of the original, 
namely commimlsm, being saturated with the same spirit in order 
to defeat it# The Western world has accepted war as a permanent 
threat for some time to come - "There will be high defense ex¬ 
penditures for at least another generation" (Canadian Minister of 
Defense Claxton)• But the same glamour of war which marred 

the first countermovements against commimism has appeared in 

6 ) 

our midsto A. M. Rehwinkel in his essay makes this comment 
about contemporary iiraerlca: 

"In America today everything tends to glorify waro Every 
soldier is a hero* Most of our public monuments commemor¬ 
ate men or events of war; our school textbooks make every 
war in idiich we have participated a war for freedom or a 
holy and a religious war© War is symbolized by song, 
picture and symbolism* Even the toys we give our* children 
at Christmas, the birthday of the Prince of Peace, aim to 
popularize war*" 

The attitude of Americanism is sometimes the same as that of 

7 ) 

Russian expansionism*'' Me may expect a "head-on collision" 
between these powers* 

5* Christian leaders have viewed this situation with 
•great alarm and judged it accordingly* Emil Brunner called war 
a great folly. Pope Pius the Eleventh has described its effect 
upon the populations as "monstrously murderous and almost cer¬ 
tainly suicidal*" Pope Pius the Twelfth has gone one step 
furtner, and has set a fascinating goal for the catholic faith¬ 
ful, namely the conversion of Russia* The Roman Catholic church 
is uniquely fitted for this task, having millions of believers 
behind the iron curtain* However, it has been connected for so 
long with reactionary economic policies in these countries, being

ono of the large property holders, that its missionary efforts 
cannot appeal to the land-hxmgry peasantry* 

We seem to be heading towards a global disaster, not 
only the destruction of all our comforts, but ”an ice-age of 
the mind.’* As this trend roughly follows the prophecies of 
Jesus, we can expect a revival of New Testament eschatology, 
which will leave the outsider completely baffled, but which will 
make the disciple of Jesus **to lift up his head for his salva¬ 
tion draweth nigh.’* 

G* Attempts to Abolish War * 

The causes for war are to be found in the individual 
as well as in the inadequacy of human institutions* Let us 
first consider the causes as we find them in the human heart* 

1* Hobbes gives the following description of human 
emotions vHalch call for warfare: 

(a) The desire for gain* 

(b) The fear of injury* 

(c) The love of glory* 

(d) The desire for power* 

(e) Hatred and revenge. 

The very words, desire, fear, love, hatred, revenge, imveil 
strong human passions. War appeals to all of them, though once 
these feelings have been satisfied the appeal has become stale* 
Luther once remarked: **War intrigues only those who did not 
experience it.’* 

These emotions drag men dov/n from the human level of 
reasoning to the subh-uman level of brutish desire. While the

reasoning power in men should be growing continually, being a 
dynamic force in his life, this is generally not true. Sir J. G. 
Fraser gives the following pessimistic view about cultural 
inertia:®^ 

”Thus while the avowed creed of the enlightened minority 
is constantly changing under the influence of reflection 
and inquiry, the real though unavowed creed of the mass of 
mankind appears to be almost stationary, and the reason 
why it alters so little is that in the majority of men, 
whether they are savages or outwardly civilized beings, 
intellectual progress is so slow as to be hardly percept¬ 
ible. I'he surface of society, like that of the sea, is in 
perpetual motion; its depth, like that of the ocean, 
remains almost unmoved.’* 

In this depth we find the urge to kill, which often breaks into 
the open, e.g. at some of our sport affairs. One must have 
heard the screaming crowd shouting at a wrestling-match: ’’Give 
him the finish,** ’*Kill him,** "Let us see blood,’* to perceive 
that these crowds are putty in the hands of a demagogue, who 
can lead them to destruction, like the famous ’*Red Piper of 
Hamelin’* who, blowing his flute, led the children into the cold 
grave of the deep river. Yet we may not limit these outcries of 
animal passions to crowds with a low intelligence level. Calvin 
knows better, he even warns the magistrates "to be cautious and 
not to give way to passions.’* It is not only the urge to kill 
which makes us listen to the trumpets, but participation in war 
can become a way of escape from the everyday drab life. American 
authors have frequently expressed their convictions in postwar 
novels, that to get away from the office routine, from the care 
of a rather tiresome family, was the reason many of the heroes

enlisted. Though this fact should not be generalized too much, 
many lives are exceedingly empty* The prayer of Paul “That 

we may live a life of peace and quietness'* has little attractioh 
for most contemporaries. They only know about the empty quiet¬ 
ness, where no other voice can be heard but their own. 

2. What can be done about this situation? Gould these 
turbulent emotions be led into quieter channels, or must they 
sweep away our civilization? The one great remedy of our democ¬ 
racies has always been education. Instead of giving a generallj/i 
optimistic view of hi-iman personality, it should try to implant 
in us again a healthy distrust of our own selves. But beward of 
the morbidity of the puritan mind I We might be taught also that 
it is not true, as Dostoweski says: “Everybody is responsible 
for everything," but it is true that '*many are responsible for 
many things." It will always be wise to include ourselves among 
the many. Furthermore, we might learn that war is an interrup¬ 
tion of politics and that, on a global scale, it cannot be won 
any longer. Expressions like "the victor" and "the defeated" 
are fairly meaningless today* 

Yet an up-to-date knowledge about the causes of war, 
for which the individual can b'e held responsible, will not be 
sufficient. The passion of war can only be defeated by a stronger 
passion for peace. The Christian poet T. S. Elliot recently 
expressed it thus: 

"The only hope, or else despair, 
lies in the choice of pyre or pyre, 
to be redeemed from fire by fire. 

We only live, only suspire. 

Consumed by either fire or fire." 

Against the fire of nationalistic feeling, whether in the west

or in the east, the Christian oeciimenical movement aroseo This 
movement, more than anything else, has built bridges from person 
to person and from nation to nation* While after V\[orld War I 
the feeling of antagonism remained for many years between the 
former opponents, and in spite of the fact 6hat World War II 
was fought in such a ruthless way, this hostile feeling did not 
last so long after this armistice* Unfortunately this feeling 
of a common calling and destiny is still very weak on the con¬ 
gregational level* The leaders of the different churches knoxv 
what is in store for us if we do not pull together, but the 
comraon Sunday-worshipper is pretty well in the dark as to what 
it means for him* Three hundred years of separatism are not 
easy to erase from the minds of Christian people. Yet the 
oecumenical movement is one of the great hopes of our days. 

During the ’^Police action” of the Dutch Government against Indo¬ 
nesia the largest protestant church body in the Netherlands 
took the very unpopular step to support the Indonesian Christians 
in their struggle for independence* This was done with the full 
knowledge that the separation of the Asiatic possessions would 
lead Holland, and therewith their own members, close to bankruptcy* 
Throughout the centuries the churches have tried to 
awaken a working conscience deciding about the personal impact 
of war* Yet the sense of duty seems to be duller today than 
ever* We find a very outspoken disillusionment concerning war, 
a soldier who feels he has been deceived by a high-geared propaganda 
machine, has always been eager to turn pacifist. This is a dis¬ 
appointment, not a new vitality of conscience. Men working in

the field of art |iave been far more successful in stirring up 
human minds than the church. We should only recall the heated 
controversy about ”A11 Quiet on the Western Front” (Erick Maria 
Remarque), or the effects of the solemn English drama, "Journey’s 
End.” 

3* The effects of education and religion with regard to 
war upon any individual can only last for a lifetime. Every 
generation has to make its decision anew. To lighten this heavy 
task it has been proposed to change deliberately either the 
human race or to change its environment. Changing the human 
race through supervised breeding following the laws of science 
as we use them with livestock, has been proposed by Plato and 
Niettche. It has been practised during the short period of time 
vh ile Nazism was in power in Germany. In England Lord Haldane 
has spent much work looking into this matter, coming to the con¬ 
clusion that hiiman beings cannot be treated as animals and follow 
^ partly the hereditary laws as they were discovered by Mendel. 

Thus the hope of breeding a peace-loving humanity seems to be 
futile. 

What is left is the possibility of changing the environ¬ 
ment. This must be preceded by a change in social thinking, 
which is a very double-edged affair. Even if we could overcome 
the cultural inertia, a.new group thinking should be morally 
orientated. As long as people avoid the revealed moral law and 
phe natural law with its divine origin, we might get all kinds 
bf systems of morality.

[j.* Let us ask, ‘*What does Christianity advocate in 
changing some of our institutions which might be responsible for 
war?” The church system of arbitration disappeared as soon as 
the judges received a national character. Therefore new insti¬ 
tutions for arbitration had to be set up, which could air issues 
between nations before they got too hot. These organizations 
have the full support of all churches. Their main weakness 
always became apparent when they had to enforce a decision. 

The dire fate of Abyssinia as it was attacked by Italy, 
and the disastrous weakness of the League of ^^ations as it was 
enforcing the economic sanctions, is still fresh before Qur mind. 
The philosophers Rousseau and Kant were convinced that once an 
institution of arbi^'tfation had been set up, the governments 
concerned in any dispute would obey the arbirtation and seek 
peace in their own self interest. Unfortunately their optimistic 
opinion has been totally false. There seems to be a constant 
possibility of a quick and complete victory over a relatively 
unarmed enemy; this possibility is too tempting for the great 
powers, and after they have set up boards of arbitration they 
destroy them from the inside. However, when we find goodwill 
on both sides during a dispute, arbitration has given us some 
wonderful results; the relationship between the United States 
and Canada during the last hundred years proves this point. 

After the first World War Christianity worked for a 
general disarmament. It knew that powerful standing m.ilitary 
forces, a hereditary officer class and a profitable armament 
industry are fery effective institutions for war. It was stated

in the suburban Parisian peace treaties that after the disarmament 
of the middle powers the western allies would follow. This 
promise was partly kept by the British, but the French, in 
hysterical impotence, did not only keep their armies and forti¬ 
fications, but even enlarged them. Thus a great opportunity for 
lasting peace was completely missed. In these years a small 
skeleton force could not only have kept watch over Germany, it 
would have been sufficient too to check Soviet Russia. It is 
no mere chance that after the failure of the disarmament confer¬ 
ence in London in 1932 I'ir. Hitler gained pox^rer in Germany and 
started to rearm at the very first date. 

The sovereign State is one of the institutions 
which has a strong bias towards war. Christianity undoubtedly 
has helped with its creation. After the breakdoivn of the universal 
mediaeval empire, Christians supported the theory of the 
divine rights of Kings, who were not responsible to the people 
beneath them, but only to God above them. This sounded quite 
comforting on paper, but left no safeguards against tyranny. 

The conscience of the father of his country was supposed 
to be duly enlightened by his court Chaplain in all questions of 
right and wrong, yet in practice the chaplain’s influence could 
seldom be recognized. Among the reformers, it was Luther who 
furthered the development towards the national sovereign state. 
Though he complained ’*A pious prince is a rare bird in Heaven”, 
qnd though he personally was quite independent with respect to 
his ruler, nevertheless the princes used the Lutheran Reformation 
to enlarge their power and wealth.

Historically here is a heavy guilt which the Lutheran 
church has to expiateo I'^ierever the catholics and the Calvinists 
were in opposition towards the existing governments, they were 
champions of popular rights, and where Luther taught passive 
obedience, they called for resistance and overthrow. Through 
their efforts the sovereign state has become a limited state© 

It seems that Christianity today should follow in this direction. 
A universal empire, as we partly had it in the Middle Ages, not 
of a centralized, ^but of a federal character, might hinder war 
very effectively. The example of the United States, which after 
the revolutionary wars changed from a loose association of states 
into a federation, is considered by many as the path, which we 
should take. Whatever Christianity can do to overcome national 
pride and ambitions, she will undoubtedly try. One of the fore¬ 
most reformed theologians of our decade, Emil Brunner, claims 
that the order of peace is the most urgent problem^ . He sees 
three theoretical possibilities for peace: 

(a) Peace by means of a superior uniformly coercive 
force, as we had it during the Pax Romana. He has no confidence 
in a triumphvlrate of great powers. This one world government 
does not exist now, though it might come into being after a 
great global war. 

(b) Peace by law. This means historically the period 
from the Middle Ages to igiij.. At that time a corpus christianum 
existed which exercised moral pressure to keep treaties inviolate. 
The end of this period was pronounced by the German Chancellor

von Bethmann-Holweg, when he described a treaty as ”a piece of 
paper." 


(c) Peace by law combined with force, included with a 
supra state organization, ‘-^‘his organization, the League of 
Nations, failed for two reasons: 

(1) The League of Nations was a meeting-place to discuss 
international problems, always trying in the end to find a solu¬ 
tion by parliamentary procedure. It was not a supra-state, 
which could solve the problem of anarchy between the states, as 
the individual state solves it by force within its boundaries. 

(2) The League of Nations had no monopoly of force, no central 
power among its members was absolutely superior to every single 
power. Whenever the League was challenged to stop an agressor 

it had to fail and the most urgent modern problem, the ofder of 
peace, remained unsolved. 

The first assembly of the World Council of Churches, 
Amsterdam, Holland, accepted the following resolution concerning 
the problem of war: 

”¥e hold that in international, as in national life, justice 
must be upheld. Nations must suppress their desire to *^save 
Pace.” This derives from pride, as imworthy as it is 
dangerous. The churches, for their part, have the duty of 
declaring those moral principles which obedience to God 
requires in war as in peace. They must not allow their 
spiritual and moral resources to be used by the state in 
war or in peace as a means of propagating an ideology of 
supporting a cause in which they cannot wholeheartedly 
concur. They must teach the duty of love and prayer for 
the enemy in time of war and of reconciliation between 
victor and vanquished after the war. 

”The churches must also attack the causes of war by promot¬ 
ing peaceful change and pursuit of justice. They must stand

for the maintenance of good faith and the honoring of the 
pledged word; resist the pretentions of imperialist power, 
promote the multilateral reduction of armaments, and combat 
indifference and despair in the face of the futility of 
war; they must point Christians to that spiritual resistance 
which grows from settled convictions widely held, themselves 
a powerful deterrent to war* A moral vacuum inevitably 
Invites an agressor.” (First Assembly of the World Coimcll 
of Churches, Amsterdam, Holland, Findings and Decisions, 

pp» 55-56.) 

This statement is worth studying, because it is a fairly 
recent one, and because it was accepted by all Christian Churches, 
though the Roman Catholic Church was voluntarily absent and the 
Russian Orthodox Church was not allowed to attend* A shortened 
form of this program seems to include these propositions: 

lo The Churches and all their members must keep their 
Independence against any encroaching state* Thus the churches 
have learned the bitter lesson of the Russian revolution, where 
the Ch\irch was too closely connected with the Czar is t regime 
and collapsed together with it* 

The Church in Germany succeeded only partly in freeing 
itself from the bondage of an absolute government, yet it was 
surely worth striving for it* Today all states are in tempta¬ 
tion to use the Churches as a part of their smoothly rimning 
propaganda machine* In wartime, this desire becomes irresist¬ 
ible, and to keep independent the Chuj?ches will reckon with 
persecution* According to the statement published in Amsterdam, 
they are ready to face it. This would bring them close again 
to the Apostolic Church with all its obvious miseries and hidden 
glories* 


2* A very hopeful development is the declaration of the 
independent Churches to attack the causes of war, both in the

human heart and among the nations* National pride is mentioned 
as one of the emotional factors leading to war; especially in 
case of defeat this id.ll be of utmost importance. The Churches 
realize that a defence of the status quo is another cause for 
war. This applies very much to the colonial people. Happily, 
we can report that the Churches in South Africa have accepted 
the challenge of the Malan-Government, they are v/orking for a 
better integration of the coloured people within the Dominion, 
against a very dangerous and reactionary policy of segregation. 

Another field of laboin? for the Churches will be the 
piu?suit of justice, e.g. the revision of unjust treaties. 

3. The Churches will try to create a moral sphere, 
because ’^A moral vacuum inevitably invites agression." 

This is the great problem of Western hurope; rearmament 
and an American general are not enough. The most elaborate 
weapons will do no good if there is no will to use them an.d 
if there is no goal to fight for. The churches, so far, have 
failed to create the promised moral sphere. In Germany a lively 
discussion goes on between famous leaders of the Evangelical 
Chiirch; the venerable Bishop Wurm calls for national resistance 
in case of a Russian attack while the Reverend Niemoller demands 
non-resistance. 

The same disagreements of minds can be observed in France, 

All 

where the Domican Order is for non-resistance and the Jesuits 
for resistance. The greatest minds of contemporary French Roman 
Catholic, theology cannot agree; Gibson advocates "To lie low", 
while Jacques Maritain wants to unroll the banner of resistance.

For the outsider these disagreements seem to be dis¬ 
couraging, but they really make for a more vital and personal 
morality than the former authoritative approach, which treated 
people as if they were without reason or will. One thing is 
certain, the Christians oppose any sacrificial war system a la 
Mussolini which claims that it is a high pleasure to die on the 
altar of your country, without asking any questions^ We will 
not forget' that none of these “great leader;^* themselves felt the 
urge, to do so. 

4^ / Christians oppose the other extreme too, which claims 
that all human life is absolutely sacred and may never be sacrificed. 
The great Saint Albert Schweitzer for some time took this posi- 
^on, he even went so far that all life is sacred. But as a 
doctor he found out that to cure human beings he had to kill 
germs. 

It might be necessary for the larger unit of Society 
that the Individual will have to sacrifice his life. It is 
morally superior to lay it down, knowing why and what for, than 
simply to allow the Government to take it away and use it. Instead 
of despair and indifference, the Churches try to make a personal 
decision possible again. 

Should war break out, the Churches promise to exhort 
their people towards love and prayer for the enemy. This is a 
very tough proposition, as hatred is now already being stirred 
up to a dangerous degree. Against the slogan “Let us win the 
war first” the Churches will declare “It is the peace which 
coimts.“ Thus the word of reconciliation will finally have 


social implications

5* The Christian contribution towards solving the problem 
of war is far-reaching* Yet the Churches have little power to 
enforce their ideals. The time has passed forever, when rulers 
of nations could be put in ban for waging war. Christianity is 
limited like any other religion, it can proclaim its truth, and 
has to wait whether it will be lived. 

Conclusion 

War is still a grim necessity; in its path not only 
material values are destroyed, but all h\mian ideals are endangered© 
It is the task of the Churches to preserve the moral perspective, 
both before and during a war© Man may never be degraded into 
a mere means, but always remains an end* The spiritual health 
of the armed forces as well as of the home-front, might be 
strengthened by the Churches. In times of war people realize 
that there is no security, whether social, political or economic. 
People will be forming their own idols, the deification of their 
own country, of their ovm ^*high cause,” will be particularly 
tempting. Even in wartime Christianity must uphold common 
values and a common faith; guilt can be found on all sides and 
without forgiveness, there will be no new life.

CHRISTIANITY AND THE PROBLEM 


OP PROPERTY AND OWNERSHIP 





Two prayerful statements about the problem of property: 


Oh Eternal God, one Father of all, who 
teachest us by reason that all the riches of 
the world are made by thee for man*s common 
use, and that by natural law not one of them 
belongs to one man more than to another; 
direct us, we pray thee, in obedience to Thy 
law, that all things may serve all men, to 
the increase of Thy glory; for Jesus* sake* 
Amen* 


- Saint Anselm, Teaching on Property. 


Oh God our Father, in whom we know that 
those ensnared in penijiry of things needful 
for the body cannot set their minds on Thee; 
have pity, we beseech Thee, on the poor «•« 
Thou, 0 Lord, providest enough for all men, 
and Thy goodness is common to all; we, by 
our greediness, have disordered Thy world; 
give Thou^ meat to the hungry and drink to 
the thirsty *•«• and give Thou hope and 
courage to them that are out of heart «»•* 
for Thine only Son, our Lord and Savior

CHAPTER I 


THE BIBLICAL AND MEDIAEVAL APPROACH 
TOWARDS PROPERTY 


Definitions of property and ownership 

Jurists have often been accused that, in 
their definitions, they have exempted private 
property from all legal restrictions# However, 
when we look into the different laws, we find the 
principle "Salus publics suprema lex” generally 
observed# 

The French Civil Code (544) defines 
ownership as ”the right to make use and dispose 
of a corporeal thing absolutely, provided it be 
not forbidden by law or statute#” The Code of 
the German Empire (903) has this to say: The 
proprietor of a thing may use it as he likes and 
exclude from it all outside interference, as long 
as the lav7 or the rights of others are not violated#” 
Blackstone^^ defines the right of property 
in the following way: ”lt consists in the free use, 
enjoyment and disposal of all acquisitions, without

any control or diminution, save only by the law 
of the land.’* 

The scholars, .who follow the scholas¬ 
tic tradition, present a little different definition, 

2 ) 

e.g. J. Messner • ”In private ownership the essen¬ 
tial nature of a right is most perfectly typified, 
for it means the exclusive and \mrestricted right 
of control over things. It involves free disposal 
by the owner (use, consumption, sale, donation, 
bequest), the rights to the fruits of property 
(whether or not these are the result of work), the 
right to make the thing owned a source of gain for 
the owner within the framework of the socio-economic 
process and in conformity with its end. A right is 
always power of control.” 

Although the latter definition is quite 
comprehensive, we feel that a better one can be 
found by W. E. Moore^^^ ’’Property consists in 
institutionally defined and regulated rights of 
persons, (or other social units) in scarce values.”

This definition contains eight terms describing 
property, giving a convenient outline which we shall 
meet again in these chapters* 

1* Property consists in values, these values 
may be tangible; e*g* land machine-tools, books, or 
they may be intangible, e.g* a patent, or professional 
goodwill; a stock or a bond representing a claim to 
income* 

2* Property values are scarce, therefore 
St* Thomas remarked, that there were no property 
problems in paradise* The scarcity of all values . j. 
makes it necessary to determine ”who gets what” in 
society* 

3o Property is a right, or a complex of 
rights; it is best thought of as a bundle of rights, 
though there is still a common tendency to think of 
property as a thing rather than a claim* 

4* Property-rights are defined, and this 
is a task of our various agencies which specialize 
in lawmaking* 

5* Property-rights are defined by insti¬ 
tutions, and apart from the human community property 
is without meaning*

6 # Property-rights are regulated# This 
means that society not only protects property- 
rights, but also modifies them; e#g# a citizen may 
own a gim, but its use is regulated by law# 

7# Property rights are assigned to persons# 
Society not only defines the relations of persons 
to scarce values, it thereby also defines the rela¬ 
tions of persons to persons; if there is no person, 
e#g. the modern corporation, the lavj uses a legal 
friction: The *^corporate personality#” 

8 # Social imits, other than the indi¬ 
vidual, may hold property# In no social system have 
property-rights been restricted to individuals, in 
our society collective property becomes more and more 
important as compared with individual property, at 
least if consumer goods are excluded# 

2# Property and ownership in the Old Testament 

The Old Testament proclaims, that all 
property belongs to God, vho made it# ”The earth 
is the Lords, and the fulness thereof” (Psalm 2 I 4 ., 
vs# 1 )# 

God is the real owner, man is his steward;

’*Man*s authority to say "This is mine" rests, finally, 
on his power to say "I am God*s"."^^ 

God is not only the Creator of all property, 
but wealth is His gift and therefore it is good* This 
gift is a part of God Himself, and therefore it 
cannot be evil or a snare which leads the recipient 
into trouble* 

The blessing of its original owner is con¬ 
tained with it, it is not a sale commodity* God 
hono\u?s the faithful patriarchs and judges through 
material rewards; "And the Lord was x-jrith Josef, and 
he was a prosperous man*" (Genesis 39# vs* 2) 

However, this doctrine contains a great 
difficulty idiich often bothered the pious men of the 
Old Covenant* If God rewards faithful service, what 
about the wicked, who despise and mock Him? One 
answer is given in the 14.9'^^^ Psalm, which seems to be 
typical of the Jewish outlook before the national 
disaster of the exile* 

"Be not afraid when one is made rich. 

When the glory of his house is increased; 

For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away. 

His glory shall not descend after him •••• 

They that trust in their wealth. 

And boast themselves in the multitude of 

their riches,

In the New Testament parable of the rich 
fool death is the great leveler; even the mighty 
rulers who could call their lands after their own 
names, will reach the inevitable end* In this psalm 
the end is the grave, but in others it is a judg¬ 
ment beyond the tomb, where the wicked will receive 
their due sentence* 

The Catholic Encyclopedia states in the 
4i5'if/0^"Ih’operty" that there is a tendency in history 
;bowards a development from collective property to 
private property* The Old Testament bears this out* 

At the times of the patriarchs while the 
Israelites still lived as nomadic shepherds, the 
patriarchs controlled the common property, which the 
family as h whole used* As Israel settled dowa into 
villages and then into cities with their commercial 
life, the nomadic principle that :wealth belongs not

to an individual, but to a whole family or commimity, 
becomes weaker* Yet the ideal of common possession 
lived oh* 

We find well-meant but wholly ineffective 
laws to uphold family property; eog. the law of the 
sabathical jearm "At the end of every seven years 
thou Shalt make a release* And this is the manner 
of the release: every creditor shall release that 
which he has lent \mto his neighbour"Another 
law dealt with the "Sabbath of Sabbaths" or the 
Jubilee or Liberty year, in which "Ye shall return 
every man -unto his possession"*^^ 

Another law tried to keep the family property 
intact even through the female line* This was done 
not so much to protect the women, but to preserve 
the inheritance so that it should not pass to another 
family* 

Another group of laws which were designed 
to protect the family property were the laws of 
levirate marriage. This law was very advantageous 
for any man who married his brother*s widow, because

f)) 

“^Lev* 25 , vs. 13* 







- 56 - 


if the deceased had no offspring the property would 
pass to his surviving brother* 

Western civilization has been deeply 
influenced by the property commandment, ”Thou 
Shalt not steal*” This order establishes protec¬ 
tion and equality for all property-holders* It is 
true that this equality is sometimes limited; women 
are not men*s equals, but even they have their 
property rights* 

Slavery was not challenged, although even 
slaves had rights*'^ Nevertheless, despite these 
limitations, the rights of the individual are established 
and the rights of the common man against the oppres¬ 
sion of the rich are defended* 

One of the unforgettable scenes in the 
prophetic struggle for the rights of the weak is the 
encounter between El^ah and king Ahab in the vineyard 
stolen from Naboth* The enraged servant of God tells 
the ruler that the double crime of robbery and murder 
will not be tolerated* ”Has though killed, and also 
taken possession? In the place where dogs lick the 


blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood”

Not only things can be stolen, a man can 

be robbed of his wife*s affections* This is what 

David had done, violating the property rights of 

one of his army officers* Before the whole court 

his misdeed is revealed in the story of the rich man 

who took the poor man*s one ewe lamb, a clear defense 

Q) 

of property rights*^ 

Sometimes a contradiction seems to arise 

between the idea that property is a divine blessing 

and the prophetic outbursts against the rich as 

wicked* The explanation, of course, is that the 

original intended blessing changes into a curse, 

when property is acquired by exploitation and 

profits are made at the expense of one*s fellowman* 

One can imagine the righteous fury of the 

prophet when one reads a passage like Amos 6, vs* 1-6: 

"Woe to them that are at ease •*•• in the mountain 
of Samaria •.. that put far away the evil day 
and cause the seat of violence to come near; 
that lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch them¬ 
selves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out 
of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of 
the stall; •**• that drink wine in bowls, and 
anoint themselves with the chief oils with never 
a single thought for the bleeding wounds of the 
nation*" (Moffat translation)

Through the bitter experience of the exile 
some Jews learned an additional lesson with respect 
to property: namely that service and self-sacrifice 
are better than wealth, 

Nehemia/heard that some of his brethern 
had to mortgage their fields, vineyards and houses 
and even had to sell their sons and daughters into 
slavery to buy corn in time of drought. Whereupon 
he set the right example: He lent them money without 
interest, and induced others to do likewise, refused 
his salary as governor, and fed many people at his 
table 


Yet at the end of this account he adds: 
’’Remember unto me o my God, for good, all that I have 
done for this people,” He still expects a reward for 
the charitable use of his property, but gradually 
the view grows that sacrifice has its own rei^rard. 

This contrition forms a bridge from the Old into the 
New Testament,

3* **Beware of Covetousness** (The teachings of Jesus)» 

The teachings of Jesus with relation to 
property, tangible or intangible, are quite different 
from the way in which modern man regards wealth. It can 
truly be said, that a gulf separates them. While 
riches to most of us seem to be highly desirable, Jesus 
shares the opposite view. He says: ”Be careful, they 
are dangerous.” 

He frequently dwells on the periM of property, 
but He does not seem to be much concerned with the 
dangers of poverty. It is true, that poverty in His 
time and in the climate of Palestine could not be so 
harmful as poverty tnday in Canada. Yet the difference 
dif time and place does not explain His attitude. 

He Imew what poverty was; He did not talk 
about it in the style of a well-paid social reformer. 
”With untrolled power to possess all. He oimed 
nothing. He had no place to be born in but another 
man*s stable, no closet to pray in but the wilderness, 
no place to die but on the cross of an enemy, and no 
grave, but one lent by a friend.” ' The truth is, 
that He sees a relationship between the poverty in 


^^^W. M. Thausere: The Land and the Book, page IjJO?* 





i 


-6o- 


oarthly means and the poverty of the hvunan spirit* 

Though poverty is not essential to enter into the 
Kingdom of Heaven, it makes it much easier* The 
poor in spirit are probably also poor in other respects* 
Jesus does not condemn possession of proper¬ 
ty as such or denounce ownership in land, goods or 
money* However, He tries to unveil the dangerous 

impact of them on the human personality* Riches are 

12 ) 

deceitful, giving their owner a false feeling of 
secvirity* 

Rauschenbusch described the effect of wealth 
in a twofold way: 

1* Wealth lifts the individual out of the whole¬ 
some dependence on his fellowraan* 

2* Wealth lifts the individual out of the full 
sense of responsibility for his fellowraan. (Christi¬ 
anity and the Social Crisis, London, 1908 )* But this 
description is rather onesided, not only has the 
relationship with his fellow-beings been destroyed, 
but man feels autonomous against his Creator* 

The desire for wealth seems to stir up the 
human soul more than any other passion* Therefore 
Jesus says: "Beware of covetousness*"^^^

Throughout the ages, the Church continued 
to repeat this warning, calling it the sin of avarice, 
with :|just as little success as Jesus in His day. 

Once man has decided that property is the 
goal of his life, he starts to accumulate earthly 
treasures. Jesus knows what happens to material 
values, the moth eats the rare silken garments and 
the rust corrupts the most precious containers. The 
emphasis is on the word earthly, meaning: temporal 
and destroyable; the true riches are somewhere else. 

As a keen observer of human nature, Jasus 
knows that it is impossible to serve God and Mammon 
Both demand the allegiance of the whole person; try¬ 
ing to serve both of them will lead to a split person¬ 
ality, which can be observed so often. 

The positive principle in the matter of 
property is expressed in Luc. 12, vs. l5* man’s 
life consistest not in the abundance of the things 
which he possesses.” Or as He said to the devil:

"Man does not live by bread alone", fellowship with 
God is more essential* 

Temporal possessions are not an evil in 
themselves, the hermits who left all possessions 
to live a solitary life in the desert, misunderstood 
Jesus* Possessions might easily become an evil, 
something which was felt throughout the history of 
the Christian Church* Vie need only recall the great 
movement of monasticism, especially the Franciscans, 
or remember the Waldensians and the Anabaptists, or 
the Hutterites of today, the latter being represented 
in Alberta* 

Wealth often became a hindrance for people 
who felt the urge to join a small group of Jesus* 
disciples* The best known is the rich young ruler^^^ 
whom Jesus asked to sacrifice all his possessions, 
which should not be taken as a general rule but was 
addressed to one particular person* In his case 
property robbed him of the purity of hearty to will 
the one thing which is needful* It was not the 
possessions as such which had to be surrendered, but 
rather the surrender of the person, who gives his will

over to God* This has been the traditional exposi¬ 
tion of the encounter between the rich young man and 
Jesus* The theologian of the ’^Social Gospel”, 
Rauschenbusch, gives a different Interpretation: 

”We think of the salvation of the individual in 
the life to come, and find it hard that so fine 
% young fellow should be barred out of heaven 
because he was rich* Jesus was thinking of 
the righteous society on earth which He was 
initiating and of the yoimg man’s fitness for 
that* Suppose the youhg man had left his 
property and had thus joined the discipleship? 

Hovj would that have affected the spirit of the 
group? Would not the others have felt jealous¬ 
ly that he was in a class by himself? If 
Jesus had shown him favour, would not even the 
Master’s motives have been suspected? If he 
had replenished the common purse from his private 
wealth, it would have given them all a more 
opulent living; it would have attracted selfish 
men and would have paralyzed the influence of 
Jesus on the poor* Then the crowds would have 
been at his heels, not merely for healing, but 
for the loaves and fishes, with dessert added. 
Judas would have been deeply pleased with such 
a reinforcement of the apostolate, but Jesus 
would have gone through the same sorrow which 
came upon Francis of Assisi, when property was 
forced upon his order and its early spirit was 
corrupted* It is all very well to say that rich 
and poor are alike in Christ, but only excep¬ 
tional characters like Jesus himself can sit at 
a rich man’s table and be indifferent to the 
fact that he is rich* Others can forget it for 
a while under the pressure of a great common 
danger or sorrow or joy, but in general the 
sense of equality will prevail only where sub¬ 
stantial equality exists* The presence of the

rich young man would have been ruinous to the 
spirit of the discipleship and would have put 
a debased Interpretation on the hope of the 
Kingdom* Jesus did not ask him to hand over 
his property for the common purse, as the 
Chin?ch in later times did constantly, but 
simply to tiu’n it back to social usefulness 
and come dovjn to the common level®** (Christi¬ 
anity and the Social Crisis, London, I 908 , 

pp. 76 - 77 ) 


The weakness of this explanation is obvious, 
the social side of the Christian fellowship is stressed 
exclusively, the impact of the individual on an exist¬ 
ing group is described with much imagination, but 
the eternal fate of the young ru2er is completely 
neglected* It seem,s that the traditional exposition 
is still preferable* 

While so far we have mainly emphasized the 
negative teachings of Jesus with regard to property, 
the positive teachings are even more helpful* 

In his famous parables of the talents, of 
the rich man and Lazarus, of the rich fool, he is 
concerned with the right use of property* Absolute 
ox-jnership does not exist, property is subordinated to 


human need 









-65- 


The greatest example is the good Samaritan, 
who employs his property for a woimded enemy, who 
gives his time, his strength, his knowledge, the use 
of his donkey, his money, and who changes a hotel 
into a hospital. All possessions and occupations 
must be related to the supreme end of all human life, 
^o the Kingdom of God, a realm of right relations 
between man and God and man and man® 

The positive teachings of Jesus in the 
matter of property can be expressed in another way; 
Property is both a test and a trust. Nowadays we 
use the word stewardship to describe human obliga¬ 
tions regarding material wealth. This attitude can 
express itself in a number of ways. In the fore¬ 
front of Jesus* thought is the duty of almsgiving, 
which should not be confused with the modern under¬ 
standing of charity. Charity endangers both the 
giver and the receiver. Almsgiving has as its basis 
justice. Jesus has never worked out a program to 
overcome pauperism. He only stated realistically: 

’*Ye have the poor always.’* He knew that under any

economic system there will be a certain amount of 
poverty, viiich should never degenerate into depravity* 
But all of us go through periods of scarcity and 
anxiety, like ore goes through the oven to become 
p\ire and thus valuable* A completely different 
situation would arise if people^ for on© reason or 
the other^ were condemned to remain in the state of 
constant poverty* 

The remedy for accidental poverty is alms¬ 
giving, an act of justice and not of mercyj from her© 
the road opens towards urgent reform of property 
and ownership whenever justice demands it* Alms¬ 
giving is not supposed to soothe the rich man*s heart 
nor give him glory of man, but is a necessary contri¬ 
bution towards social equity. However, ’*All the 
hard questions connected with pauperism lie beyond 
the horizon of the Gospel 

Another aspect of stewardship is fidelity 
to our daily task, which is divinely expected from 
us* This part of Jesus* teachings has been stressed

by the Protestant reformers and we will meet it 
again in a later part of the thesis* 

All oiir property should be at the complete 
disposal of God* ”We are pensioners on His bounty 
and trustees for what He lends to us*” The Churches 
of today all have their stewardship-programs with 
which they endeavour to reach this goal* As a rule 
both the end and the means have been watered down to 
such a degree that the teachings of the gospel are 
scarcely recognizable* There we read: ”And they 
forsook all*” Here we are approached with tithing 
and similar schemes which might fill the Church 
treas-uries, but influence social conditions very 
little. ,The true meaning of stewardship is the 
willingness towards self-surrender, to give up all 
whenever it is demanded* When the old garment of 
society is worn out to such a degree that it cannot 
be repaired any longer, new conditions demand far- 
reaching changes* Christians should be in the 
front, not so much demanding these changes, but shovj- 
ing personally hovj they can be accomplished*

i].* The Communism of Love # 


The first Christian congregation grew up 
in Jerusalem, and had many features, which made it 
quite distinct from the surrounding Jewish communityo 
One of these marks, namely commimal property instead 
of private property, is described in the book of Acts 
as follows: 

"And the multitude of them that believed were 
of one heart and of one soul: neither said 
any one of them that ought of the things which 
he possessed was his own; but they had all 
things common*" 

"Neither vjas there any among them that lacked: 
for as many as were possessors of lands and 
houses sold them, and brought the prices of 
the things that were sold*" 

"And laid them down at the Apostles* feet: and 
distribution was made unto every man as he had 
need*"17) 

The force behind this collective property 
was a common expectation^that Christ would soon re- 
turn and establish His Kingdom on earth* The 
Christians in Jerusalem simply followed the custom

of the first twelve disciples, who had a coinmon 
purse and a coinmon life* This communism, if we may 
call it so, has nothing to do with production, 

"they sold all their possessions and goods," and 
tried to distribute from their common treasury 
according to need, so that nobody lacked the 
necessities of life* Whether there was any produc¬ 
tion at all, and whether everybody produced indi¬ 
vidually, we do not know* 

The right of private property was not 
questioned, as the incident of Ananias proves, 

"While it remained, was it not thine own?" And 
after it was sold, was it not in thine own power?" 

It is not that he kept back part of the price, 
which made him a hypocrite, but it is the lie that 
he brought only part of the price received, trying 
to deceive the apostle, as though he contributed the 
full amount* "Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto 
God * " 

Just as there was no pressure on any of the 
members to sell their house and land, so too there 
was no hostility against the institution of the family* 



< - f 



) 


■ ( 








-70- 


The latter is always found in contemporary communism, 
which feels that the institution of the family is a 
constant threat against collective property. 

This "generosity** as Rauschenbuch calls it, 
lasted only for a short time in Jerusalem# Why it 
was discontinued cannot be said with certainty# 

Did the hope for a speedy return of Christ fade out? 
Did a period of disappointment follow the early 
enthusiasm, and everybody go back into his own? Did 
this communism of Love prove itself unworkable? Did 
extreme poverty arise, which made a general collec¬ 
tion necessary among the sister congregations outside 
of Jerusalem? As the record is silent, speculation 
is useless# 

Yet this experiment had a profoimd influ¬ 
ence throughout the following centuries# It was 
felt that a disciple of Christ can either have an 
appetite for the earthly, or for the eternal# Just 
as the first Christians in Jerusalem had differed 
from their Jev/ish neighbours, so the Christians in 
later centunies felt that they had to be different#

AHcetlsm entered the Church, first in the form of 
the hermit, who desired to leave the world behind as 
far as possible, and then in the shape of monasticism* 
The hermits were radicals, especially with regard to 
property* One, St* Macarius, surprised a robber in 
his hut, who was busy trying to carry away his few 
belongings* The Saint pretended to be a stranger, 
helped him to carry the things out, and went so far 
in his co-operation as to load them on the waiting 
cart* 

The monks, too, desired to withdraw from 
the world, but in their cloisters they built up a 
complete society with all its necessities. They promised 
to have no property, hoping thus to imitate the life 

1 o \ 

of Christ and his apostles* St* Benedict wrote: ' 
"Above everything the vice of private ownership is 
to be cut off by the roots in the monastery* Let no 
one presume either to give or to receive anything with¬ 
out permission of the abbot, nor to keep anything as 
his ora, neither book, nor v/rlting tablets, nor pen,

nor anything whatsoever, since it is unlavrful for 
them to have their bodies or wills in their own 
power,” 

This institution of the monastery had no 
intention of changing property rights everywhere, 
nor did it primarily want to civilize the surround¬ 
ing districts, though this was often accomplished 
unintentionally, especially in the case of Germany, 

”The object of withdrawal is to achieve a life, whose 
ideal is different from and largely at variance with 
that pursued by the majority of mankind,” (Catholic 
Encyclopedia) 

This authoritative definition refutes the 
claim that monasticism is not so much Christian, but 
comes close to the communistic ideas of Plato, Plato’s 
guardians did not abstain from private property as an 
expression of complete self^negation, but for pragmatic 
reasons, 

”,,o,none of them should have any property of 
his own beyond what is absolutely necessary| 
neither should they have a private house or 
store closed against one who has a mind to

enter; their provisions should be only such 
as are required by trained warriors, who are 
men of temperance and courage; they should 
agree to receive from the citizens a fixed 
rate of pay, enough to meet the expenses of the 
year and no more; and they will go to mess and 
live like soldiers in a camp* Gold and silver 
we will tell them that they have from God; 
the diviner metal is within them, and they have 
therefore no need of the dross which is current 
among men, and ought not to pollute the divine 
by any such earthly admixture; for that commoner 
metal has been the source of many imholy deeds, 
but their own is imdefiled* And they alone of 
all the citizens may not touch or handle silver 
or gold, or be imder the same roof with them, 
or wear them, or drink from them* And this 
will be their salvation, and they will be the 
saviours of the state*’* 19 ) 

The Communism of Love in Jerusalem has 
shown that a common spirit has a tendency to obliter¬ 
ate property distinctions* Short-lived though it 
was, it has presented a goal worth striving for* 
Monasticism in some respects is a communism of love 
too, but the force behind it seems to be fear^that 
man might be overpowered by the lure of property, 
and therefore escape seems to be advisable* The x 
scope of its love is rather narrow; it has a very

limited concern for those who are outside of its 
walls, it does not try to set an example, which can 
be followed by all, it is for the few who take the 
evangelical counsel of poverty seriously* Thus, 
the many who cannot accomplish this are put into the 
lower-bracket of second-rate Christians* Within 
its walls is common property and the true Imitation 
of Christ, outside is private property and the rush 
for this world’s goods* This seems to be a unsatis¬ 
factory solution of the problem of property* 

5* Property belongs into the ius genti\;im * 

Many theories have been set up to justify 
private property, the Roman Catholic Church has 
rejected them all, with the exception of one, which 
bases property on natural law* 

The personality theory, in which private 
property is a necessary supplement and expansion of 
the personality, has been repudiated, because it is 
unconcerned with the poor and with children* 

The primitive contract theory (Hugo Grotius) 
did not fare better, since it is historically imposs-

ible; and even if we could trace it back into early 
times, why should the primitive contract be binding 
for us today? 

Hobbes proposed the legal theory, '*The 
State is a fountain-head of all the rights, which 
the subjects have and consequently also as a source 
of private ownership#" This would give the State 
the right to introduce collective ownership, a possi¬ 
bility which worries some theologians* 

The labour theory which states that private 
property is the right, which every man has to the 
product of his labour, has not been accepted, though 
it was proposed by eminent men like Locke, A^am 
Smith, Ricardo and Say* This theory gives no answer 
about the material used in any kind of labour, and 
about the means of production*

The teaching of the Roman Catholic Church 
respecting property goes back to St, Thomas of 
Aquino, who analyses private property as a part of

short summary of how, to St, Thomas, the different 
levels of law are related* First there is the eternal 
law, which is the purpose and rational rule which 
the creator has in his mind* This eternal law has 
been revealed in the divine law, which is interpreted 
by the theologian* The philosopher working with his

reason only, is interested in the natiiral law, which 
is defined by St. Thomas as certain kind of par¬ 
ticipation by us in the eternal law#”^^^ 

Knox^ing that there is a natural law does 
not necessarily mean that we know, in detail, what 
the law is; the natural law is an unwritten law, 
it has only one absolute principle: ”To do good and 
to avoid evil#" How this principle will work out, 
must be decided by hxmian reason, leading us into the 
secondary and tertiary precepts of the law* These 
precepts have often been called positive laws, mean¬ 
ing that they are the actual laws of states. A 
comparison of all these laws throughout different 
times give us the ius gentium, which is closer to 
the natural law than to the positive law. Property 
does not belong strictly either to natural or posi¬ 
tive law, but is in between, found in conjunction 
V7ith the ius gentium. 

"The right of private ownership will belong 
to the ius gentium, if in the judgment of reasonable 
and good-willed men, it is a mode of possession most

favourable to order and most conTormed to the best 

conditions of human social existence® 

**Every means necessary to attain the essential 
ends of human life is imposed on human con¬ 
science by reason of the secondary precepts of 
the Natxiral law, but is rather added to it as a 
discovery of human reason® It is natural and 
necessary for man to prepare his own being, to 
propagate his own species and to live in Society. 
Reason concludes that certain conditions are 
necessary to make possible the attainments of 
these natural ends, viz. conditions such as 
peaces order, justice, stability, etc® Private 
property appears as being precisely of certain 
social value, as being apt to secure the above 
conditions, and to that extent it is necessary 
for human life. This conclusion will not have 
the same force for all people and all times.”^3) 

St. Thomas selected his words carefully as 

he analyzed property (II - II, 66, 1 and 2), the terms 

used are: 

Dominium - The widest term, applying to any 
property right whatsoever. 

Possessio - Embraces both collective and private 
ownership. 

Proprietas - The right to private property. 
Communltas possessionum - collective ownership.

Law, Blackfriars, Oxford, 19q-8, p. li}..

As a first step he develops a basic doct¬ 
rine of possession, which shows God as the only 
possessor of all things* Man can have no participa¬ 
tion in this dominion of God over the natiare and sub¬ 
stance of things. Only by Divine providence has he 
received the privilege of participating in God*s 
dominion, in the sense that he can use material 
creation since man alone is created with reason and 
will. 

He must use the material created to attain 
the end appointed for him by God. Prom this end man 
derives certain human rights, e.g. man must conserve 
his being, thus he has a right to a livelihood; man 
must propagate his species, thus to protect, to nour¬ 
ish and to educate his children^ he has a general right 
of possession. 

The Mediaeval Church condemned Wicliff and 
Huss because they based the dominion of man on char¬ 
ity and grace instead of on natural law. St. Thomas 
teaches that man has dominion because of a two-fold 


reason:

1# On the nature of man as a rational being* 

2* On the natural destiny of material creation, 
which is to serve him* 

Yet, so far, the question is left open 
whether this "right of possession*’ should take the 
form of private or common property, of individual or 
collective ownership* This question is decided in 
the second step of the analysis, and leads to the 
doctrine of private ownership* 

While every man has an absolute natural 
right to possess and use the things necessary to 
preserve his life, the fact that this right is best 
exercised by way of private ownership is a conclu¬ 
sion reached by human reason, working on the principles 
of nat\iral law* 

Pope Leo XIII says in his Encyclical "Herum 
Norar\mi": "The limits of private possession have 

been left to be fixed by raan*s own industry and by 
the laws of individual races*" With respect to

possession in general there can be no alternative, 
man must either possess material things or else dieo 
But with regard to the particular way in which 
possession is exercised, there are numerous alter¬ 
natives, varying from private ownership on the one 
hand, to extreme Communism, as in religious orders, 
on the other, with numerous forms of more or less 
corporate possessions in between. 

To arrive at a solution of these alter¬ 
natives we must ask, what is the end of property? 
Following a gradual analysis we arrive at a nmiber 
of conclusions: 

1* All material creation is naturally destined 
for the common use of mankind. 

2. It cannot be used, as it is found, it must be 
organized, it must become human and therewith 
rational. 

3. How can this be done most effectively? In 
the form of private property? A modern scholastic

wit er, G* Messner ^ , claims that the institution 
of private property is best as proved by experience 
and reason. Man has a national desire for property,' 
its acquisition gives him great satisfaction. This 
is undoubtedly true, but what about the dangers in¬ 
volved? What about the sin of covetousness? 

Some Churchss in segregating and numbering 
the commandments have gone so far, that they enimierate 
two commandments against covetousness* They feel 
that the natural desire for property is one of the 
greatest temptations confronting man; it gives tem¬ 
porary satisfaction, but in the long run makes man 
more desirous. 

Another argument for private property runs 
like this: Man can only be charitable if he owns 
something. It is a strange argument, because excep¬ 
tions, like poverty or the consequences of a disaster, 
are used to establish a general rule. This proposi- 
6ion has furthermore been weakened by the historical 
observation that, in a modern society, individual and

club charity, based on the system of private property, 
have been faili^res. Only since we have adopted a 
dystem of social welfare, based on collective property, 
are we approaching satisfactory results# 

Another plea for private property points 
to family life; the rearing of children presupposes 
private property# This is undoubtedly true for the 
sphere of consumption, but how often is it true as 
far as the means of production are concerned? Not 
only Catholic social ethics, but Christian social 
ethics in general, have a tendency to consider the 
average family as a unit in the country, making its 
living by farming# If this were true, a fairly strong 
case could be established for private property, but 
we knowT from experience and statistics that this is 
an unrealistic approach since it omits the vast major- 
ity of \n*ban families# Many families are quite success¬ 
ful in raising their children without possessing the 
means of production# 






For the principle of private property it 
is furthermore contended that it encourages creative 
development in the economic sphere* This is the 
common argument for private enterprise, basing it¬ 
self on the freedom it gives to initiative* If we 
look at the booms only, this is correct, but if we 
take the depressions into account, many are not 
likely to be convinced by the merits of private enter¬ 
prise* 

The final argument of G. Messner tries to 
prove that private property encourages people to pro¬ 
vide for the future* The validity of this reasoning 
always has some flaw^si e*g*, what provision can one 
make if one is incapacitated in early life, or has 
had bad luck with one *s savings and investments? 

In an industrial age, with masses of people nea? the 
poverty line it becomes a mockery, end hence our social 
conscience has provided for old age pensions, and a 
long and lengthening list of various insurance schemes

against contingencies - some of these schemes being 
voluntary, and others of a kind^that can only be 
adequate when they are compulsory and state run© 

The scholastics, following the analysis 
of Sto Thomas, acknowledge that the institution of 
private property is not always most effective and 
under all circumstances* Messner^^^ says: "Any 
system of social economy is in conflict with natural 
law to the extent^ that it precludes a proportionate 
distribution of the goods produced in the cause of 
social cooperation by the working of the resources 
available in the community*" 

Yet the scholastic theologians bring private 
property in through the backdoor claiming that it is 
necessary in view of the defects in human nature, 
caused by the loss of original justice* 

"In justice all ought to belong to all, 
it is sin which has made private property*" "God 
ordered the earth to be the common possession of all* 
Nature therefore granted a common right, it is usurpa- 
tion that has made it a private right*" ‘

Small groups of people may be able to 
overcome the temptation to usurp a common right, 
but according to the schoolmen they are an exceptionj 
no social teaching can be based on them, but only 
on the quasi universal experience of sin® This is 
called a realistic doctrine of property* 

Thus, under the normal conditions of huiman 
life, a regime of private property is the best means 
of insuring an equitable and peaceful distribution 
of the fruits of the earth among all men* This does 
not exclude another arrangement, e*g. the idealistic 
doctrine of Plato concerning property in the fifth 
book of '*The Laws”* Yet the schoSiastics believe 
that Communism would only work in an ideal state, 
in which men were like gods; the possibility of 
collective ownership is never taken too seriously* 

The general trend of thought seems to be that the 

27 ) 


St. Thomas, ij., sent, d 33 2, 2 













- 87 - 


natiire of society requires the institution of private 
property* 

As social functions of private property 
the follov/ing are enumerated: 

1* It makes a clear demarcation possible of what 
is mine and thine* Otherwise this has to be decided 
by endless disputes which might be democractically 
decided by a majority decision or which might lead 
to the use of force* Furthermore it is plain that 
common property is difficult to control* How shall 
it be done? By experts only, who might miss the 
national point of view just as frequently as advisory 
committees which were recruited from the rank and file 
of the population. If you choose group representa¬ 
tion, will those members overcome the inherent self¬ 
ishness of their particular party? The problem of 
control is a difficult one, though some solution will 
be achieved by the British nationalization of basic 
industries* 

2* Another social function of private property is 
that it is supposed to create personal interest; a 





- 88 - 


Russian proverb claims: "Give a man a barren rock for 
his ovjn, and he will make of it a flowering garden." 
Yet, is it really necessary to arouse personal in¬ 
terest in property? Can it not generally be observed 
that the average man has already too much desire to 
gain possessions? Must we not train people to over¬ 
come this desire and to serve collective property 
without being personally rewarded in the exact pro¬ 
portion of the energy spent? The existence of an 
efficient and hard working Civil Service is a reminder^ 
that effort is not nicely adjusted to personal rewards* 

3» The institution of private property makes ex¬ 
change of goods by trade possible, public ownership 
ultimately results in the supplying of goods from 
official warehouses. 

4 . It creates richly diversified social functions, 
while common ownership degrades society into a mere 
mass; private property limits the encroachment of the 
state. This is true if we put private property versus 
the principle of common ownership. The nineteenth 
century looked at the problem along those lines. Today 





- 89 - 


we try to find the realms in which each of the two 
principles work best* This will eliminate a good 
deal of the foregoing criticism* 

5« Through private property economic and political 
power is distributed through society, and is not con¬ 
centrated in the hands of one group, namely the 
government* This proposition contains an amomt of 
truth differing in various coimtries* Sometimes 
private property is in the hands of only few people, 
who vjork together as a class and do not guarantee 
any distribution of property* There has always been 
a strong aversion against such a system; e*g* the 
anti-trust or combines laws and heavy succession 
duties* It would have been wiser to state that any 
one-sided concentration of property is dangerous* 

G* Messner summarizes his findings, that 
private property serves and protects the natur'al 
order of society and the political coramimity* It 











-90- 


stands for freedom, whether it is personal, social, 
political, or economic, for freedom (he says) is 
indivisible* He has a strong bias for private 
property. 


This attitude was not so marked among the 

Ghiirch-fathers and theologians of the Middle Ages. 

Professor E* G. Carlyle explains the Medieavel 

conception of property in this way:^^^ 

’^To the Fathers the only natural condition is 
that of common ownership and individual use. 

The world was made for the common benefit of 
mankind, that all should receive from it x^hat 
they require.,.. They admit however, that human 
nature being what it is, avaricious and vicious, 
it is Impossible for men to live normally under 
the condition of common ownership* This repre¬ 
sents the more perfect way of life, and this 
principle was represented in the organization 
of monastic life, ... (but) for mankind in 
general, some organization of ownership became 
necessary^ and this was provided by the State 
and its laws ,.«• Private property is therefore 
practically the creation of the State, and is 
defined, limited and ahanged by the State. 

VJhile however the Fathers recognize the legal 
right of private property, as a suitable and

necessary concession to human infirmity •••• 
they are also clear that from the religious and 
moral standpoint the position of private proper¬ 
ty is somewhat different. 

*.. .’’^Ihatever conventional organization may be 
found necessary for practical adjustment of 
hirnian affairs, the ultimate nature of things 
still holds good. Private property is allowed, 
but only in order to avoid the danger of viol¬ 
ence and confusion; and the institution cannot 
override the natural right of man to obtain 
what he needs from the abundance of that which 
the earth brings forth. This is what the 
Fathers mean when they call the maintenance of 
the needy an act of justice, not of mercy; for 
it is justice to give a man that which is his 
own, and the needy have a moral right to that 
which they require.”

THE MODERN CHRISTIAN APPROACH 


09 The attitude of the Protestant reformers towards 

property o 

The sixteenth century experienced a coimner- 
cial revolution, which changed its life Just as much 
as the industrial revolution changed the nineteenth 
centuryo Luther stood bewildered before the complex¬ 
ity of his economic environment. He preached fiery 
sermons and published thundering pamphlets against 
the taking of interest, against monopolies, against 
high prices, which he blamed on the merchants and 
not on the discovery of the New World with its flow 
of metal and accompanying inflation. When his econ¬ 
omic analysis finally led nowhere, he blamed the 
Church of Rome because she was too lax in dealing 
with the profiteers or because her own financial 
machinations were responsible for all economic evils.

In his whole outlook he was completely mediaeval 
and reproduced in a simplified form the teachings of 
the schoolmen. His goal was the same as theirs, 
namely a Chiirch-civilization, where the whole of life 
was regulated by the clergy in accordance with the 
Scriptures. 


”There can be no better instructions in 
....all transactions in temporal goods than that every 
man who is to deal with his neighbour present to him¬ 
self these commandments: ”What Ye would that others 
should do unto You, do Ye also unto them,” and ”Love 
thy neighbour as thyself.” If these were followed 
out, then everything would instruct and arrange 
itself; then no lawbooks nor courts nor judicial 
actions would be required; all things would quietly 
and simply be set to right, for every one^s heart 
and conscience would guide him.”^' 


Tawney is not convinced by Luther*s logic, 

2 ) 

he comments as follows: 

”Evorything would arrange itself? ... Pew would 
deny it. But how if does not? Is emotion 
really an adequate substitute for reason, and 
rhetoric for law? Is it possible to solve the 
problem which social duties present to the in¬ 
dividual by informing him that no problem exists?

Is it true that the inner life is the sphere 
of religion, does it necessarily follow that 
the external order is simple Irrelevant to 
it? To wave aside the world of institutions 
and law as alien to that of the spirit - is 
not this to abandon, instead of facing, the 
task of making Christian morality prevail, 
for which mediaeval writers, with their con¬ 
ception of a hierarchy of values related to a 
common end, had attempted, however inadequately, 
to discover a formula? 


This weakness of Luther becomes apparent, 
when we ask about his attitude towards the institu¬ 
tion of private property* It was mainly on three 
occasions that Luther had to accept the challengei 
the property question became urgent in dealing with 
monasticism, in answering the demands of the 
revolutionary peasants, and in the exposition of the 
Seventh Commandment* 

The monks had established a limited ”Commun¬ 
ism of Love’*, they had given up their private property 
for the good of the monastery* Luther does not deal 
with the property question in particular, he only 
claims that the monks do not understand the justlfica- 








-95- 


tlon by faith, but try to obtain it by works, e.g* 
voluntary poverty. Once they have recognized their 
mistake, monasticism will dissolve by itself; this 
actually did happen in all Protestant countries. 

Far more important were the demands of 
the peasants, who were siaffering particularly in 
Southern Germany from an impoverished nobility. 

They were practically slaves on the large estates, 
and in Luther’s time they were losing their last 
rights through the introduction of the Roman lq.w, 
which was replacing the teutonic custom-law. 

' The peasants asl©d Luther * s opinion about 
their political program, the so-called "Twelve 
Articles." They were determined to establish an 
ideal Christian brotherhood in place of an intoler¬ 
able social order. In some of these articles the 
problem of property is raised. 

"The small tithe of a head of cattle they 
will on no accoimt pay to any lord, spiritual or 
temporal, since God had created the beast for the

free use of man.'* 

"They are entitled according to the word 
of God, to their share of game and fish, for God 
has given a right to all men to the fowls of the 
air and the fish in the water® Anyone who cannot 
prove the pxirchase of "a water" must restore it to 
the oommunity, and the excessive preservation of game 
by the lord must cease, similarly in regard to the 
woods*" 

"The peasants are against the us\u?pation 
of the common land, which the peasants will take back 
in all cases where they have not been honestly purchased*"3) 

McKinnon mentions that these demands were 
very moderate and written in a persuasive- form* Luther 
gave his opinion in a pamphlet called "An exhortation 
for the peasants'*; he considers their demands justi¬ 
fied, and asks the territorial princes to enforce them*

’^Dear Sirs, it is not the peasants which stand against

you, but God himself to p\mish your madness*” 

However, he disagrees with the revolution¬ 
ary methods of the peasants, ’’Suffering, suffering, 
cross, cross - this is a Christian’s right and no 
other. 


Luther advises that concessions be made on 
both sides, but it is obvious that he considers serf¬ 
dom as compatible with spiritual freedom* 

This attitude is too much for McKinnon, 
who protests in these words: 

”Yet calmly to assert that it is immaterial 
in a Christian society whether the Christian 
is a serf or a free man, whether the laws and 
institutions under which he lives are good or 
bad, whether he and his family are ground in 
the dust in order that a privileged class 
which professes to be Christian may life in 
selfish ease or luxury, showed a lack of 
understanding of human natuj?e and what is 
permissable in a Christian state. 

After Luther had seen the devastation of 

the peasant revolution, even though they were at the

time victorious, he took the hard path of not favour¬ 
ing them* He published a rather deplorable effusion: 
’’Against the robber and murdering bands of the peas¬ 
ants;” here we find the famous sentence: ” No thing 
is more develish than a rebellious man.” 

Though the Reformer was right, in condemn¬ 
ing the revolutionary methods, which made the peasant’s 
lot worse, which brought them into severe serfdom, 
lasting until the middle of the nineteenth centiiry, 
yet their social demands were justified. The property 
question alienated the peasantry and later the prolet¬ 
ariat from the Lutheran Church. 

In his exposition' of the Seventh Command¬ 
ment ’’Though Shalt not steal,” Luther puts his whole 
emphasis on the protection of property. He becomes 
very eloquent, when he describes the various forms of 
stealing, whether he observes the laziness of ser¬ 
vants, the overcharging of tradesmen, their bad mer¬ 
chandise, their false measures, the driving of a hard

bargain with the needy, his conclusion always is: 

’*The world is nothing else than a vast wide stall, 
full of great thieves®” 

The Commandinent establishes the right of 
ownership, lawful governments may declare private 
property as a civil ordinance® Here Luther approaches 
the position of Hobbes, for whom the State is a 
fountainhead of all rights® This makes it seem as 
though the State could establish communism, but the 
’’Formula of Concord” among the articles that cannot 
be tolerated in domestic life states: ’’That a Christ¬ 
ian cannot with a good conscience hold or possess 
property, but is in duty bound to devote it to the 
common treasury®” 

As on other occasions, when a problem be¬ 
comes too intricate, Luther points out that its solu¬ 
tion really does not matter® Thus when discussing 
property he likes to add ’’temporal”, making it 
clear that the true property of the Christian should 



f

be found somewhere else* The Augsburg Confession 
closes this discussion by stating: ’*It is right for 
Christians to hold property*’* 


V/hile the German Reformers wanted to return 


to the simple life, which is they supposed had ex¬ 
isted before the era of commercialism, Calvin accepted 
the economic civilization of his day* Calvinism was 
a strongly urban movement and the accumulation of 
riches in itself was not considered to be bad* But 
this did not mean that Calvin overlooked their in¬ 
herent dangers* Therefore Calvin published and tried 
to enforce many regulations which concerned themselves 
with the mode of living, regulations which for us 
would seem to be \mbearable* 


The first Swiss Reformer, Zwingli, repeated 


the medie/Jival thesis, that pr&vate property originated 



^ sin* Calvin agrees with him, but shifts the emphasis 
back to the Old Testament idea, that property is a 
Divine blessing* 

’’Though some seem to enriche themselves by vigil¬ 
ance, nevertheless it is God who blesses and 
cares for them* Though others are rich before 



-ICl- 


they are born, and their fathers have acquired 
great possessions, nevertheless this is not by 
accident, but the providence of God rules over 
it.’* (Opera XXVI, 62?. Ser. on Deut. 8:lI|-“20) 

Naturally the problem arises: ’*How do bad 
people get riches?” Calvin answers that God some¬ 
times gives riches to bad people, but only to bring 
them to greater condemnation. They have received 
greater grace, but they did not profit by it. Thus 
wealth becomes a doubtful blessing, poor and rich are 
endangered, but the poor are safer. Professor Hark- 
ness has found passages in Calvin’s sermons, where 
he compares the poor with a small boat on a stream¬ 
let which may strike a tr -e along the bank, but it 
is safer than a ship on a tempestuous sea. The rich 
are like those who skate on ice and are apt to fall, 
or like those who walk amongst thorns and must walk 
carefully lest they be pricked. She remarks that 
later^ Calvin’s followers used such metaphors to 

7) 

justify keeping the poor in poverty as a moral service.''

and Co., p.2i|.l.

We are not surprised, that Calvin stood for 
the right of every man to possess his owi. The collect¬ 
ive property of monasticism did not interest him es- 
peciallyi he was ppposed to the monastic vows for 
the same reason as Luther* The time of the peasant 
revolts had passed, but Galvin observed communistic 
tendencies among the Anabaptists and the Libertines 
of his beloved city of Geneva* 

"We have already seen how these wretches pro¬ 
fane marriage, mixing men with women like brute 
beasts, as their iList leads them* And how under 
the name of spiritual marriage they colour up 
this bestial pollution •••••• 

But finally, to leave no order among men, they 
^Iso make a similar confusion as to goods: say¬ 
ing that it is the communion of saints for no 
one to possess anything df his own but for each 
to take whatever he can* At the beginning there 
were some silly Anabaptists who talked this way* 

But now that such absurdity has been rejected by 
all as repugnant to human sense, so that even 
the original authors are ashamed of it, these 
Libe-‘tines have taken refuge in it *•• It is 
true that on the surface they have some justifica¬ 
tion, complaining of the avarice of those who 
call themselves Christian*" 

"Let us recognize it as a just punishment of God 
that these fanatics come to overthrow all order, 
wishing to abolish all distinctions of goods, 
making the world like a forest of brigands where 











without account or payment everybody takes as 
his own whatever he can get* However, there 
are so many witnesses in scripture to rebuke 
this villainous confusion, that if we were to 
recite them all there would be no end*'*8) 

This rather lengthy quotation, shows Galvin 
as a vigorous defender of the rights of private 
property,' Max Weber has claimed in his famous 
treatise ’*The protestant Ethic and the Rise of 
Capitalism” (Translated London, 1930) that the 
Swiss Reformer has ma.de an outstanding contribution 
to capitalism* Weber*s ideas were popularized and 
criticised at the same time by R. H* Tawney* He 
makes this remark? 

”If capitalism means the direction of industry 
by the owners of capital for their own pecuni¬ 
ary gain, and the social relations i^^iich estab¬ 
lish giemselves between them and the wage¬ 
earning proletariat which they control, then 
capitalism has existed on a grand scale both 
in mediaeval Italy and in mediaeval Flanders* 

If by the capitalist spirit is meant the temper 
which is prepared to sacrifice all moral scruples 
to the pursuit of profit, it had been only too 
familiar to the saints and sages of the Middle 
ages. It was the economic imperialism of Catholic 
Portugal and Spain, not the less imposing, if 
more solid, achievements of the Protestant powers.

C- 












v;hich iinpressed contemporaries dom to the 
Armada. It was predominantly Catholic Cities 
which were the commercial capitals of -Europe, 
and Catholic bankers who ^were its leading 
financiers.’* (Op. cit. p*93) 

Though these observations were imdoubtedly 
correct, Weber's intention was to describe the par¬ 
ticular contribution of Calvinism. His starting 
point was the observation that in a mixed population 
Protestants have more property than Catholics. His 
explanation is that the social teachings of Calvinism 
have comlpined an intense piety and a shrtl^^ business 
acumen. The acquisition of money is not a means any 
longer, for the satisfaction of man’s material needs. 
In Calvinism it has become a means to prove for the 
individual that he is predestined for eternal salva¬ 
tion. What in the Middle Ages was considered as the 
lowest form of avarice, has now become the duty of 
man’s calling* 

While asceticism during the Middle Ages 
brought man into a cloister, now under Calvinism it 
drives him into economic activity. 




-105- 


This thesis of Max Weber*s has been dis¬ 
cussed for nearly forty years, and the general agree¬ 
ment seems to be, that he was both wrong and right* 

H© was wrong, that he found the stream of capitalism 
flowing only from the middle class virtues of indus¬ 
try, thrifty sobriety and frugality generated by 
John Calvin* He overlooked that these virtues were 
Indoctrinated long ago by the Stoa and the mediaeval 
schoolmen* he did not take into account how Machia- 
vellii* exaltation of egoism profited capitalism* 

He connected the religiously good works of Calvinism 
too soon with the good work of capitalism* It is 
doubtful whether he ever studied Calvin in much detail 
and whether he saw the rircheTS of Calvinism as it 
developed in Western Europe and in the New World* 

He starts his famous essay with a quotation from 
Benjamin Franklin, who can scarcely be called a good 
Calvinist* 

Yet in many respects Weber was right, Galvin 
ism with its hatred of poverty and idleness impressed 







-106- 


a strong sense of obligation on Its adherents to 
make money and to acquire property. This was not 
considered any longer as greed, and therefore sinful. 
Once possessions are acquired they are not enjoyed 
In easy living, but are accumulated, handed from one 
generation to the other,and play an Important part 
In the process of saving. 

In one respect Calvin was a trallbreaker; 
he changed the Christian attitude with respect to 
money property. He broke down the many prohibitions 
regarding the taking of interest; he was thus instru¬ 
mental in aiding the modern system of money and bank¬ 
ing. While until then money-lenders and bankers 
always lived with an uneasy feeling, Calvin made 
honourable people out of them. This had tremendous 
consequences, as property today is not so much a 
thing any longer, but a claim; it is investment and 
not real estate. 

Luther had repeated the doctrine of Aristotle 
that money cannot give birth to money, and had for¬ 
bidden the taking of interest.^)

If a man does not partake of the risk in¬ 
volved in any economic transaction, he should not 
partake of any profit* Luther grants two exceptions, 
the tithe of land, where the creditor is completely 
dependent upon the crop, and the buying of an annuity 
as a protection against poverty,' the latter should 
not give more than 5 or 6 percent* 

Calvin*s position was published in a letter 
vjhich he wrote to his friend Sachinos in 1545* This 
document is of such great iraportance, that we shall 
quote it almost in full* 

"While I have had no experience myself, I have 
learned from the example of others, how danger¬ 
ous it is to give an answer to the .question on 
which you ask my advice* i^or if we wholly 
condemn usury, we impose tighter fetters on 
the conscience than God himself. Yet if we 
permit it in the least, many under this pretext 
will take an unbridled liberty which can then 
be held in bounds by no restriction. If I 
were writing to you alone, I should have no 
fear, for I know well your prudence and restraint 
but since you are asking for another, I fear 
that he may gather a little more permission 
from my words than I wish* However, since I 
Have no doubt, that you will act with discretion 
according to the nature of the man and the 
circumstances, I will tell you how the matter 
seems to me* 

In the first place, by no testimony of the 
Scriptures is usury wholly condemned* For the 




- 108 - 


meaning of the saying of Christ, commonly 
thought to be very clear, i*e. **Lend, hoping 
for nothing again” (Luke 6:35) has been per¬ 
verted, As elsewhere in speaking of the sumptu¬ 
ous feasts and ambitious social rivalry of the 
rich, he commands rather that they invite in 
the blind, the lame and the poor from the 
streets, who cannot make a like return, so here, 
wishing to curb abuses in lending, he directs 
us to loan chiefly to those from whom there is 
no hope of receiving anything,...The words of 
Christ mean that he commends serving the poor 
rather than the rich, 'j-'hus we find not all 
usury forbidden# 

The Law of Moses (Deut. 23:19) was political, 
and should not influence us beyond what justice 
and philantrophy will bear# It could be wished 
that all usury, and even the name, were banished 
from the earth. But since it is possible, it 
is necessary to concede to the common good* 

We have passages in the Prophets and Psalms 
in which the Holy Spirit inveighs against usury# 
Thus a city is described as id.eked because usurj^ 
is found in its market-place and streets (Ps. 

55‘ll)* But as the Hebrew word here means 
fraud in general, the passage can be otherwise 
interpreted. Sven if we grant that the prophet 
speaks explicitly of usury, it is not surprising 
that among the great evils of this time he should 
mention it, for with an improper use of usury, 
cruelty and many evil deceptions are often 
joined.••.. 

It is said in praise of a holy and G-od-fearing 
man, that ”He putteth not out his money to usury*’* 
Indeed, it is a very rare thing for a man to be 
honest and at the same time a usiirer* The prophet 
Ezekiel (Ezek. 22:12) goes even further, for in 









-log- 


enumerating the crimes which inflamed the 
wrath of the Lord against the Jews, he uses 
two Hebrew words, Nesec and Tarbit: one of 
which means usury and is derived from a root 
meaning to consurae, while the second signifies 
an increase or addition, doubtless because each 
man contriving to fin^ther his own gain takes 
or rather extorts it at his neighbors loss ••• 

Not it is said that today, too, usury should 
be forbidden on the same grounds as among the 
Jews, since there is a bond of brotherhood among 
us. To this I reply, that in the civil state 
there is some difference; for the situation in 
which the Lord had placed the Jews, and many 
other circumstances, make it easy for them to 
engage in business among themselves without 
usury. Oiir relationship is not at all the same. 
Therefore I do not consider that usury is wholly 
forbidden among us, except it be repugnant to 
justice and charity. 

In this letter Galvin recognizes that a 
change in an economic situation justifies a change in 
policy. This is most significant, because it leads 
Calvin not to interpret the biblical prohibitions 
literally as he usually does, but in terms of ”justice 
and charity.’* 

In the next part of his letter he attacks 
the idea of Aristotle and of the Church-fathers that 
money is barren, ‘‘Money cannot beget money,” and there¬ 
fore interest must not be taken. 






. t] 



<■ 








- 110 - 


'*The reasoning of Saint Ambrose and of Chryfeto- 
stom that money does not beget money, is in my 
judgment too superficial. What does the sea 
beget? lA/hat does the land? I receive income 
from the rental of a house* Is it because the 
money grows there? The earth produces things 
from T-diich money is made, and the use of a house 
can be bought for money. And is not money 
more fruitful in trade than in any other form 
of possession one can mention? Is it lawful to 
l0t a farm, requiring a payment in return, and 
unlawful to receive any profit from the use of 
money? .•«. 

How do merchants derive their pfofit? By 
their industry you will say. Certainly if 
money is shut up in a strongbox, it will be 
barren - a child can see that. But whoever 
asks a loan of me does not intend to keep this 
money idle and .gain nothing. The profit is not 
in the money itself, but in the return that 
comes from its use. It is necessary then to 
draw the conclusion, that while subh subtle 
distinctions appear on the surface to have some 
weight, they vanish on closer scrutiny, for they 
have no substance. I THEREFORE CONCLUDE THAT 
USURY MUST BE JUDGED, NOT BY ANY PARTICULAR 
PASSAGE OP SCRIPTURE, BUT SIMPLY BY THE RULES 
OP EQUITY. 

True, Calvin makes a number of exceptions, 

because he fears his letter could be used and the 

new freedom to take interest tiorned to evil purposes: 

Interest must not be taken from the poor. One 
must not be so bent on gain as to neglect the 
necessary offices, scorning his poor brethern. 
One must not go beyond the boimds^ of equity. 

These are to be ascertained by the Golden Rule. 
He who borroi^s must make as much or more gain

from the money borrowed. (Apparently to pre¬ 
vent the possibility that the money borrowed 
might actually be ’^barren'*©) We must not 
judge what is equitable according to "vulgar 
custom" or the iniquity of the world, but take 
the rule from the word of God. 

We must regard the transaction, not as a 
private affair, but for the good of the public. 
One must not go beyond what the laws of the 
regions permit. This is not always a suffici¬ 
ent rule, for they often permit what they 
cannot restrain. It is better to ask too little 
than too much.^^) 


In spite of these restrictions, Tawney 
regards Calvings treatment of capital as a water¬ 
shed. Not that the reformer was highly original 

in treating the problem of interest, nor that he in¬ 
troduced new customs, but that he gave a good con¬ 
science to owners of money property. Prom that time 
on, none of the churches tried to set up elaborate 
regulations against usury. The commercial revolution 
and later the industrial revolution gave many chances 
for profit, and from then on, this profit could be

re-invested and a constant growth of more money 
property became possible. This leads us to the 
problems of our day. 

7* The contemporary problem of private property . 

The contemporary economic system, which is 

mainly based on the institution of private property, 

has frequently been analyzed. It has been vehemently 

attacked by Karl Marx and his school, who consider 

it as a refined system of exploitation. It has been 

passionately defended by presidents of the Chambers 

of Commerce, e.g. Eric Johnston (U.S.A.), or by 

economists such as Hayek (The Road to Serfdom). 

The Churches too have added their analysis, 

the Roman Catholic Sncyclica (Quadrageslmo Anno), as 

12 ) 

found in K. Reinhardt gives this description: 

’*It is patent, that in oin? days not alone is 
wealth accumulated, but Immense power and des¬ 
potic economic domination is concentrated in 
the hands of a few, and that those few are 
frequently not the owners, but only the tuustees 


Realistic Philosophy (Milwaukee, Bruce Company, 19^9)

and directors of invested funds, administering 
them at their will ••• They hold and control 
money, are able to govern credit and to deter¬ 
mine its allotment and thus supply so to speak 
the lifeblood of the entire economic body, 
grasping as it were in their hands the very 
soul of production, so that no one dare breathe 
against their will •••• This accumulation of 
power is a natural result of limitless free 
competition, which permits the sircvival of 
those who are strongest, which often means those 
who are most ruthless and pay least heed to the 
dictates of conscience*” 

The last paragraph of this description is 
only half true, monopoly means not always the survival 
of the fittest, but is frequently a deliberate agree¬ 
ment between competitors to limit production and there¬ 
with to' raise prices* Otherwise the analogy seems 
to be fair enough* Another Christian view was given 
in a resolution at the Malvern conference of the 
Church of England, 194^2 

”There are certain features of our social life 
which act as stumbling blocks making it harder 
for men to live Christian lives. Among these 
we believe that the maintenance of that part 
of the structure of society, by which the 
ultimate ownership of the principal industrial 
resources of the community can be vested in the 
hands of private owners, may be such a stumbling 
block.”13"

Archbishop Temple was the author of this 
resolution, of which the last part had been such 

a stumbling block*” To his great disappointment 
this was replaced by the words *^ may be such a stumbling 
block*” This took the force out of the resolution* 

The same thing happened at the Amsterdam 
Assembly of the World Council of Churches» Section 
III, which dealt with the topic: ”The Church and the 
disorder of society” stressed the points of conflict 
between Christianity and athejajftic communism as 
follows: 

1 * the commuhist promise of what amounts to a 
complete redemption of man in hlstory| 

2 o the belief that a particular class by virtue 
of its role as the bearer of a new order is free 
from the sins and ambiguities that Christians believe 
to be characteristic of all human existencej 

3* The materialistic and deterministic teachings, 
however they may be qualltied, that are incompatible 
with belief in God and with the Christian view of 
man as a person, made in God*s way, and responsible 
to Him; 







- 115 - 


Ij.* the ruthless methods of communists in dealing 
with their opponents; 

5* the demand of the party on its members for an 
exclusive and imqualified loyalty which belongs only 
to God, and the coercive policies of communist dic¬ 
tatorship in controlling every aspect of life.^^^ 

Against the dissenting vote of the Czech 
protestant delegate this description was accepted. 

But as capitalism was anaiysec^ John Poster Dulles 
moved an amendment to place the vrords ’’laissez-faire” 
in front of capitalism, which made the issue an historical 
one, as laissez-faire capitalism does nowhere exist 
today# 

The Churchg^foimd the following points of con¬ 
flict with capitalism: 

la It tends to subordinate what should be the 
primary task of any economy - the meeting of human 
needs ,- to the economic advantage of those who have 
most povrer over its institutions a

ism in Western nations in spite of their Christian 
background, for it has placed the greatest stress 
upon success in making money. 

[j-. It has also kept the people of capitalist 
countries subject to a kind of fate which has taken 
the form of such social catastrophes as mass •unem¬ 
ployment.^*^ ^ 

For our pui*poses it is important that we 

inquire how law students and economists describe 

our system today. We find a team of them in Berle

and Means. In the preface to their book (p.VIII) 

they describe the corporate revolution. During the 
last fifty years, perhaps two thirds of the industr¬ 
ial wealth of the country has been transferred from 
individual ownership to ownership by the publicly 
financed corporation. The divorce of ownership! from.

control almost necessarily involves a new form of 
economic organization of society. 

These varied descriptions show roughly the 
contemporary problem of private property, namely that 
capitalism has become a pseudo-religion, that economic 
reforms to avoid expiajitation of the masses are de¬ 
manded from many quarters, and connected with this 
is the cry for social reform, to arrive at a better 
balance of political power. 

As private property has become one of the 
main features of capitalism, we use the latter ex¬ 
pression idienever we talk about the contemporary 
economic system. The word capitalism is charged with 
emotions, and stands for a way of life as the word 
orthodoxy did in the sixteenth century. The contemp¬ 
orary word for heresy seems to be communism. Capital¬ 
ism is a system of life for which many people seem 
to see a quasi divine origin. 

Like every good theological system it has 
different parts, which fit nicely together. In its 
anthropology man is pictured as an acquisitive animal.

the possession of property is a tangible symbol of 
self-realization* 

Competition is not any longer on the physical 
plane, as among animals, but on the economic level. 

Man*s individualism, a wolf among wolves, is accented 
against his sociality. The ’’self-made’* man receives, 
high praise, though few people realize that no man 
has made himseli^ nor is the sole power behind his 
progress. 

The real worth of a man is usually estimated 
in terms of possessions. The mediaeval idea of voca¬ 
tion is often replaced by the cash value theory of work. 

The cosmology of capitalism expresses h belief 
in the primacy of economic law, as the fundamental 
principle which interprets the universe, '-^his basic 
principle is usually called: The law of supply and 
demand. It is claimed that the welfare of man depends 
in the last analysis upon uninhibited economic enter¬ 
prise. 

The ethics of capitalism may be described 
as ’’enlightened self interest,” implying that all 
human relations can be expressed in economic terms.

Labour is not any longer a personal or social problem, 
but exclusively an economic one* The crown of it all 
is its mythology, or as it is called today, ’*the 
American way.’* In this way of life property is the 
sacrament - ‘*an outward and visible sign of an in¬ 
ward and spiritual grace’* which this religion purports 
to convey. The ownership of property is the earnest 
of the good life. Each succesful acquisition is in 
its specific way a symbol of divine favour, estimated 
by a scale of values. 

The rating of the sacramental aspect of 
property depends in the last analysis upon the pro¬ 
portion of the amount gained to the output required. 
Hence, dividends and rents have greater sacramental 
meaning than wages, while achievements through specula¬ 
tion have a fascinating, yet dangerous character of 
the holiest of the holy. The accumulation of property 
is the piling up of merit, and the statement of 
Daddy VJarbucks in the comic strip ’*Little Orphan 
Annie,’* ’*This country needs more million-dollar- 
a-year-men’*, is a description of the sanctified man.^^^

in Christianity and Property. Edited by Joseph 
P. Fletcher, Philadelphia, the Westminster Press, 

1947, p. 1660

Not all property is considered to be on 
the same scale of relative values. At the top is 
property in the form of all kinds of securities, 
mortgages, stocks and bonds. 'I'his kind of property 
is regarded very highly, because theoretically it 
grows by watching the market. 

Next in the scale of values is wealth 
producing property in a material form, such as factor¬ 
ies and industrial real estate, used for money making 
purposes. 

The third important category of property 
includes real estate and residential buildings occu¬ 
pied by the owner, automobiles, insurance policies, 
etc., going down to the ownership of clothing and 
other personal essentials. This kind of property 
is used to satisfy the personal needs, but not to 
gain further wealth. 

The ownership of property has become a means 
by which men can be classified in a social hierarchy. 
The acquisition of property has become the accepted 








- 121 - 


standard in western culture, by which the success 
or failure of anybody can be ineasuredo In comparison 
with property, lineage or education have become quite 
secondary* 

The final purpose of property is to give 
its owner a feeling of security* The cry for more 
social security shows that too many people have too 
little property and thus feel insecure. Therefore 
reforms of property must be seriously considered* 
Existing forms of ovjnership are not inviolable and 
unalterable. Social obligations are stressed far 
more than the privileges which are tied up with 
private property. 

There is a general feeling that the restric¬ 
tion of production by monopolies is an abuse of rights, 
whether these rights are of a purely technical nature 
(patents) or whether the monopoly is simply an accumu¬ 
lation of wealth, makes no difference. I'he same 
attitude is being taken concerning land monopoly, 
which in former years strangled growing settlements 
and is today broken up by tax devices*

It is generally recognized that the owners 
of the means of production must make economic goods 
available. In times of depression the capital owners 
who, during the ’*boom‘* did not like state interfer¬ 
ence, are frequently approaching the government for 
help, at that time it is their duty, to know for 
themselves when ”to prime the p-ump.’* 

Archbishop Tample wrote ( 19 ii 7)5 ‘*The heart 
of it all is a full recognition of private property, 
combined with an insistence, that it must always 
carry responsibility. The property without the func¬ 
tion is a thing which is condemned. Now this con¬ 
demns a very large amount of the property that exists 
today: to some extent in land, to an enormous extent 

in stocks and shares 

Legal institutions must be used to assure 
that the ov/ners of property fuaifill their social ob¬ 
ligations. The workers must be protected against 
the dangers of their occupations, against sickness, 
and always against the threatening unemployment.

The owners of property are forced today to obey 
many regulations and to contribute towards the well¬ 
being of those WTho have little or no property and 
therefore must work for them* 

Another powerful public weapon is the use 
of taxation* Taxes today are not solely used to 
bring in revenue but they also try to accomplish 
social goals* They aim at a better distribution of 
income and property* Progressive personal income 
taxes are taken for granted, estate and inheritance 
taxes could be used to a far greater degree to change 
our pattern of property* 

The nineteenth century became conscious 
of the exploitation of the proletarian by the owners 
of the means of production* The twentieth century 
has recognized another danger, the reckless exploita¬ 
tion of the soil* It has been estimated that the land 

in the Canadian West has only one fourth of the fer- 

18) 

tllity it had fifty years ago* This "soil mining"

has taken such forms that, if it is not stopped in 
time, it might lead to a national disaster* Some 
system of licensing every farmer and the legal right 
to supervise him, thus limiting his property rights, 
will soon have to be worked out* We might consult 
the British experience, since the Labouj? government 
introduced licensing and supervision of every farmer* 
This has led to only very few convictions, but given j 
the legal means to influence agricultural production 
without changing the laws of property* 

In the realm of industry a change of the 
relationship, between labour and capital has been 
proposed. Instead of having private ownership of 
the means of production in basic industries, collec¬ 
tive ownership has been tried. Yet there seems to 
be an immense ideological barrier from both sides* 
People are still not x^rking for themselves, but they 
are working for the government* 

Christian thinkers have advocated a system 

19) 

of co-ownership in industry, e.g. Messner . This

implies more than co-partnership; in the latter system 
the workers are represented at the board of directors 
without having any financial interests in the firm* 
This system of co-ownership leads to a better distri¬ 
bution of property, it forms a link between labour 
and property, it Increases the interest of the workers 
and therewith their productivity* This co-ownership 
might take the form of acquiring or giving shares to 
the workers. Many problems are connected with this* 

If the worker wants to partake of the profit he must 
be willing to share the occasional unavoidable loss* 

If he is co-owner of the plant in which he works, 
probably his freedom of movement has been curtailed* 
This co-omership is no panacea and many experiments 
will be necessary before its value is established* 

One experiment was started this January in the coal 
Industry in the Rhineland (Germany) v/here the workers 
are now co-owners and therevjith co-managers. The 
same proposals have frequently been made by Walter

Routhor, president of the United Autoworkers of 
America. 

This brings us to the problem of the modern 
corporation. It has been demanded that those who 
control the corporations should be made responsible, 
not only towards the shareholders, but tov/ards the 
commimlty. Until recently only two possibilities 
were taken seriously, either that the trusteeship 
should be established for the so-called passive 
property, or that free should be given to the 

controlling group. 

’*The rise of the modern corporation has 
brought a concentration, which can compete on equal 
terms with the modern state, economic power versus 
political power, each strong in its own field. The 
State seeks in some aspects to regulate the corpora¬ 
tion, while the corporation, steadily becoming more 
powerful, makes every effort to avoid such regula¬ 
tions. i/Ihere its own interests are concerned, it 
even attempts to dominate the state. The future may 




-127- 


see the economic organism now typified by the corpora¬ 
tion, not only on an equal plane with the state, but 
possibly even superseding it as a dominant form of 
social organizationo 

As a remedy the same author proposes in a 
somewhat vague way: ’*It seems essential that the 
control of the great corporations should develop 
into a purely neutral technocracy, balancing a vari¬ 
ety of claims by various groups in the commimity 
and assigning to each a portion of the incomestream 
on the basis of public policy rather than private 
cupidity* 

This suggestion follows the line laid down 

22 ) 

by Henry Damford Parker who sees the property 
problem not as private property versus public 
property. **There are two key features of the capital¬ 
ist system where changes of a radical nature will be

found to be imperative* The first is the unearned 
income which accrues to the property-owning classes, 
and the second is the status of the wage-earner in 
industry* The two main items in any progressive 
program should be to reduce the share of the national 
income which goes to the rentier class, and to give 
the worker in large-scale industry the status of a 
property-owner *” 

Christian ethical thinkers have generally 
agreed with this position* Private property givesr 
not only a chance to exploit the weaker individual, 
but is an important means to gain political power* 

This power may be organized in the form of a class 
which works together and excludes outsiders or in the 
form of giant corporations which try to control the 
political parties* To arrive at a better distribu¬ 
tion of power, it is important that everybody should 
possess essential property* Emil Brujiner defined this 
rather narrowly as natural property - ’*that which is 



t 



f'" 






- 129 - 


immedlately associatAdnwlth our person#”^^^ The 
usual description of essential property is wider and 
might be defined as a minimum standard of living* 

This is not vague any longer, because medical and 
social workers can assess fairly precisely what a 
person needs to remain on the human level. This has 
little to do with the expectations of the individual, 
which vary with the cultural level* 

For many people their job is practically 
the only property they have, as the cash-value of 
their personal (essential) property is unimportant* 
Therefore his job becomes all-important* Parker^^^ 
proposes: ”if a job in corporate industry consti¬ 

tuted a property right, so that the worker could 
not be deprived of it (except for legally proved 
misconduct) without his own consent, industrial 
managers would normally find it profitable to keep

their workers fully occupied and would, therefore, 
expand production; and in order to sell their products, 
they would be compelled to lower their prices*** This 
idea, that a job constitutes a property-right, has 
revolutionary impiiications* V/hat it implies is that 
each industry should be ‘*the property, not of the 
state, but of the individuals who work in it; and 
that the relationship between different industries 
should be regulated, not by centralized planning and 
control, but by the mechanism of the free market*” 

This scheme is both anti-capitalist and anti-commimist* 

The greatest possible portion of society 
should enjoy income from property* This is of consider¬ 
able Importance, because the income from property, 
in contrast with the Income from work, leads to the 
first accumulation of wealth* The development of 
middle-sized possessions, which would not give much 
political power, should be the rule* Large possessions 
or extensive poverty should not be caused by the social

system itself. The goal of social reform is not 
the abolition of private property, but the creation 
of private property for the greatest portion of the 
members of the community. The great weapon will be 
the modern methods of fiscal policy. 

Yet there will always be differences in 
private property, because of different ability and 
energy, especially if a severe estate-tax would 
level off the property^which people might receive 
from their relatives. 

An unequal human effort should receive a 
different monetary reward, which will partly be saved 
and will thus lead to the formation of private prop¬ 
erty. Theoretically this is not supposed to happen 
in the U.S.S.R., yet we quote from a Soviet newspaper 
o.according to the Moscow paper Trud (20/1/1936) 
sixty employees of a Donetz mine earned monthly wages 
of 1000-2500 roubles per head; four hundred earned 
500-800 roubles per head and the remaining thousand 
averaged 125 roubles. The top wages in this average

mine were about thirty times higher than the minimum 
wages. But the director of a mine of l^OO employees 
belongs only to the medium stratum of the technocracyp 
the salaries of directors, chief engineers and adminis¬ 
trators in the top stratum are up to 100 times higher 
than the average wage and up to 300 times higher 
than the minimum wage. In 194-3 the appearance of 
the first proletarian millionaries, enthusiastically 
welcomed by the Soviet press, completed the develop- 

These new millionaires can invest their 
excess income in government bonds, yielding between 
7 and 8 percent; the dpposits in the saving banks 
are free from income tax and succession duties. 

Economic equality has been abandoned, diC;9ttator Stalin 
made this explicit in a speech (1934-) 2 .equality 

in the sphere of requirements and personal life is a 
piece of reactionary petty-bourgeous stupidity worthy 
of a primitive sect of ascetics, but not of a social¬ 
ist society organized on Marxian lines, because we

cannot demand that all people should have the same 
requirements and tastes, and that all people shall' 
live their individual lives in the same way 
By equality Marxism means, not equality in personal 
requirements and personal life, but the abolition of 
classes, i«e« (a) the equal emancipation of all 
toilers from exploitation after the capitalists have 
been overthrown and expropriated; (b) the equal aboli¬ 
tion of all private property in the means of produc¬ 
tion after they have been transformed into the proper¬ 
ty of the whole of society; (c) the equal duty of all 
to work according to their ability and the equal right 
of all toilers to receive according to the amount of 
work they have done (Socialist society); (d) the equal 
duty of all to work according to their ability and 
the equal right of all toilers to receive according 
to their requirements (Commimist society)o And 
Marxism starts out vilth the assumption that peoples’ 
tastes and requirements are not, and cannot be equal

srocialism or in the period of communism • • • • It is 
time it was understood that marxism was opposed to 
levelingo 

Stalin, as far as points (c) and (d) go, 
is here in company with Christian theologians, like 
Emil Brunner, who opposes equality of income, because 
it creates a mechanistic society. He favours inequal¬ 
ity of income which supposedly gives us an organic 
society® Unfortunately, he does not explain how far 
this inequality may go, until it becomes harmful for 
society; neither does Stalin® 

Christian thinkers seem to agree, that an 
experimental approach seeking new forms of property 
seems to be warranted* Theoretically the problem 
can be easily described; an older collection of 
essays, ‘^Property, its duties and rights’*^*^^ makes 
this terse comment:

”It is this intellectual passage from the 
conception of private property as secondary and con¬ 
tingent to the conception of it as ultimate and ab¬ 
solute, which has caused all the trouble. And this 
passage was made, almost insensibly, through the 
intense realization of the value to be set upon the 
liberty of the individual to live his own life*'* (pol8l) 
But the practical solution is more difficult* 
Both Jew^s and Christians have experience with social 
ownerships, e.g. the tribe, the clan, the monastery* 

This ancient experience of the common-v;ealth (the 
primitive Christians called it koinonia) could become 
effectual again today. ■‘•'his will bring us into a 
strange dilerana which Joseph J. Fletcher expresses 
in these words: 

"It will be said, perhaps more often than 
anything else, that in the Cjnristian view man 
is a sinner as ,we11 as a social being, and 
that social ownership of the social means of 
production will lead to corruption and power 
lust in,the public offices. This is no doubt 
true. These evils exist already in private 
enterprise and in police (as distinct from 
participating^ Governm.ent control. We may be 
sure in a "fallen world", that new modes of 
property ovjnership will create new problems 
of justice and adjustment. Therefore, for

Christians, the question is: which kind of 
problems should we be trying to solve, the 
kind that arise because we do not practice 
our principles, or the kind that arise be- 
c§.use we do?** 


The social dilemna is obvious; if the social 
aspect of ownership is denied or minimized the con¬ 
sequence will be Individualism with all its dangers; 
if, on the other hand, the individual character of 
ownership is rejected, we- get some form of collectiv¬ 
ism. 

Both, individualism in itself and collectiv¬ 
ism in itself, are unable to give a balanced system 
of property. The problem is ho longer private property 
or public property. Today it must be determined how 
much property shall remain in private hands and how 
much shall be controlled or owned by public authorities. 
Co-partnership and co-ownership are possible and the 
job should become a right and not something insecure

and accidental. I’he decisions will be made not along 
ideological lines of inalienable rights but along 
pragmatical lines, whether they servo the common 
good. Just because '-'hrlstlanity cannot be identified 
with any specific economic program^it gives freedom 
for decision.
