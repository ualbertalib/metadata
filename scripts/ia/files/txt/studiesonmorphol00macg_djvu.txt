The exchange reaction is subject to the principles of 
mass action and chemical equilibrium* Kelley and Brown (14) 
found that it requires an extracting solution strength slightly 
greater than half* normal to effect complete extraction, normal 
solutions being used as a general rule* The usual shaking and 
filtering of soil solutions is not satisfactory* Leaching the 
soil continually disturbs the equilibrium by removing the sol¬ 
uble products of the reaction, which will eventually go to com¬ 
pletion, or approximately so* 1 n the case of ammonium acetate 
being used as the leaching salt. Nil4 will then remain in the 
soil as the only replaceable base* 

Van Bemmelen concluded that the replaceable bases are ad¬ 
sorbed in the surface of the colloidal particles of the soil, 
and are not held as ordinary chemical compounds* Hissink (10) 
investigated the speed of the exchange process, and found that 
97 per cent of the exchangeable bases went into solution in 
the first five seconds. Prom this he concluded that only ad¬ 
sorbed bases are replaceable, since the reaction was too rapid

Kelley, Dore and Brown (16) compared bentonite, natural 
zeolites and soil colloids chemically and by X-ray analysis. 
They decided that the properties of the zeolites were not 
the same as soil colloids or bentonite since: 

(1) Grinding the soil colloids and the bentonite brought 
a marked increase in base exchange properties, but did not in 
the case of the natural zeolites. 

(2) heating to 350° C destroyed the exchange properties 
of the zeolites, whereas it required a temperature of 750° u 
to destroy similar properties in the soil colloids and ben¬ 
tonite. 

(3) X-ray analysis indicated that the zeolites did not 
have the typical diffraction patterns of the bentonites and 
soil colloids, consequently their exchange properties cannot 
be due to the same substance. 

(4) .Natural zeolites are relatively unstable substances 
formed as the result of the weathering of feldspars, and it 
is reasonable to assume that they would undergo complete dis¬ 
integration within a short time. Soil colloids are relatively 
stable substances. 

They found that substances composing the colloidal mater¬ 
ial of soils are not amorphous, but crystalline, and replace¬ 
able bases occur not only on the surface of the particles, 
but also on the interior of the crystals. X-ray analysis re¬ 
vealed an orderly arrangement of the atoms within the particles, 
and since the exchange of bases is stoichiometric, they con¬ 
clude that base exchange substances are true chemical compounds.

two successive litres of solution. Since the exchange reaction 
is extremely rapid and solution rates should be the same, he 
reasoned that differences in calcium content betv/een these two 
successive leachates should represent the exchangeable calcium, 
chapman and Kelley (4) report this method as not very accurate. 
Gedroiz advocated a determination of the carbonate content of 
the soil before and after extraction. Kelley and Brown (14) 
found this method to be quite accurate provided that the total 
carbonates did not exceed 1 per cent of the soil and where 
magnesium carbonate does not occur. 

Methods of Determining Exchangeable Bases 

Three main procedures have been developed, all of which 
involve the previous elimination of soluble salts, or the de¬ 
termination of soluble salts on a separate sample and the ap¬ 
plication of a correction.. 

(1) Blectrodialysis. Largely utilized by Mattson (18) 

and has also been used by several workers with success. Wilson 
(34) and Bradfield (2) have reported upon this method, how¬ 
ever, it is subject to the same errors as the other methods 
when the alkaline earth carbonates are present. 

(2) Leaching with Dilute Acid Solutions. Gedroiz (8) 
reported that when a soil is leached with dilute hGl, the 
bases are replaced by hydrogen. Kelley and Brown (14) found 
that dilute iiCl, when used in this way, not only attacks 
substances normally involved in replacement reactions, but 


others as well. 







26 


The preceding results indicate the serious error intro¬ 
duced in the determination of exchange bases b y the presence 
of the various carbonates, and by high concentrations of the 
sulphates. Both carbonates and gypsum (CaSO^hgO) occur more 
or less abundantly in the lower B horizons of most soils-- 
rarely in the upper horizons in any amounts. 

The normal ammonium acetate solution extracted greater 
amounts of calcium from each of the three substances than was 
extracted by an equal volume of water. The amount in excess 
of the water extraction apparently was considerably greater 
wherever calcium occurred in the sample as the sulphate. The 
acetate solution extracted approximately eleven times the 
amount extracted by the water, in the case of the UacjOg sample; 
nine times the amount where the lime plaster was leached (since 
the sulphate form is relatively more water soluble), and not 
quite twice the amount in the case of the (jaS 04 .. Thus it 
would seem that if any of these substances remain in the soil 
after the water leaching, that the succeeding acetate solution 
will remove greater quantities, this being especially true of 
the uaSO^.BiigO (gypsum), since it is approximately three times 

more soluble in the acetate solution than the oaCOS® However, 
the 0 aS 04 « 2 ii 20 is approximately seventeen times more soluble 
in water than is the uauC^® This would indicate that relative¬ 
ly much greater quantities of the uaS 04 * 2 ii 20 would be dissolved 
with the water leaching. It could be assumed that unless an 
extremely high percentage of the sulphate form occurred in the 
soil, it would largely be removed by the water extraction and 
would then be classed as water soluble forms, noY/ever, where

make an extraction for soluble sodium in this manner, sodium 
was always quite abundant. Good comparisons of the different 
extraction methods as to sodium content were obtained in the 
solonized horizons. 

It should be kept in mind in any soil analysis comparison, 
that profiles selected a short distance from each other may 
vary considerably in base proportion and content, due to natural 
variations in the soil. Kellogg (13) has pointed out that the 
most common occurrence of the solonchak, the solonetz and the 
soloth soils is as a complex. Within an area which in some 
places has an approximately normal profile, there occur ir¬ 
regular patches of the solonized complex, and these patches 
are usually not uniform In any characteristic. The original 
solonchak which was dominant throughout the area at one time, 
may have had almost any ratio of the various bases (present as 
salts) in the saline water. Thus the resulting solonetz struc¬ 
ture will vary from an almost normal profile, through a weakly 
developed solonized structure to the extremely hard solonetz 
morphology, depending on the ratio of monovalent to divalent 
bases which were present in the original solonchak. These 
bases may have risen in Irregular patches from the water 
table, or may have saturated the soil from the surface. Thus 
considerable variability in base content and the ratio of diva¬ 
lent to monovalent bases might be expected to occur in soils 
within relatively short distances, especially in solonized 
areas. In the analyses presented, such variations are seen.

water soluble salts, these occurring mainly as the sulphates 
of Ca, Mg, and wa. Exchange base content in the clay flat 
soils is much higher than in sandy soils, but the differences 
decrease as the soil type becomes heavier, boils which are 
high in organic matter contain greater amounts of exchange 
bases than such clay flats as this. 

The conclusion of this investigation is that low-lying 
clay flats occurring in solonized areas, due to their very 
high content of soluble salts, and relatively low per cent 
of exchange Na, could be more truly termed *solonchak f soils 
rather than f solonetz ? , even though some morphological indica¬ 
tions of the solonetz are present. It might also be pointed 
out that in analyzing such soils for exchange bases, the great 
amount of soluble salts to be removed from the soil require 
at lease 1000 c.c. ! s of water leachate to effect complete 
removal and so not produce errors in the amount of exchange 
bases determined. 

At the start of this investigation it was thought that 
there existed a possibility of some significant differences 
in either water soluble or exchange base content, or the pro¬ 
portions of sodium to the divalent bases, if profiles from 
the same area, but showing variations in structure development 
and nearness to erosion, were studied. 

Profiles were selected from - 

(1) The centre of an eroded or "blow-out” spot. 

(2) The side of an eroded or "blow-out" spot. 

(3) Some distance away from the other profiles, fairly 
well removed from any erosion.

solonized profile, with the greatest concentrations occurring 
in the solonized b-^ horizon, whereas very small amounts of jNa 
occur in the normal profile. The exchange divalent bases in 
the normal soil are greater than in the solonized profile, but 
a portion of this ca and Mg actually existed in the soluble 
form, probably as the carbonate. (iviote the discrepancies in 
the results of the last two columns of the table for tne 
and c horizons of the normal profile). In the solonized pro¬ 
file, such concentrations of carbonate apparently do not occur, 
since only minor differences exist in the base exchange capac¬ 
ity analyses for that profile. i\io base unsaturation is noted 
in either profile. 

Table A shows that water soluble i>ja occurs in greater 
proportions in the solonized profile, especially in the upper 
horizons. The percentage of exchange bases shows the very 
low proportion of exchange Ma present in the normal soil (1 to 
2 per cent) whereas it is several times this percentage in the 
solonized profile. The percentages of total extracted bases 
also illustrates the greater relative proportion of i\ia in 
the solonized profile. 

The conclusions from this comparison are that both water 
soluble and exchangeable Na content of a solonized soil is 
greater in both amounts and proportions. Greater concentra¬ 
tions are also closer to the surface than that found in a normal 
profile taken in the same general area. This is probably a 
result of poor drainage and a relatively impervious Bq_ horizon 
which prevents percolation of water. If any significant quantity 
of Na was originally present in the normal soil, it appears to

with respect to the divalent bases, only in the lowest horizons. 
This would indicate some leaching of soluble salts in these 
more weakly solonized profiles, with the removal of these salts 
from the upper horizons. The percentage of exchange IMa is very 
low for a solonized soil, which could be expected from the low 
amounts of soluble Na salts present. Total extracted base per¬ 
centages show that in general, Na constitutes only about 5 per 
cent of the three bases determined, which approaches the amount 
of Na found in normal soil profiles. The presence or absence 
of (JaCOg is an important factor in converting solonized soils 
to the more normal profile. 

The conclusions from this comparison are that a weakly 
solonized structure appears to be related to low Na content 
and proportion. Low soluble Na salts tend to produce low ex¬ 
change Na in the complex. Evidently these two profiles are 
almost normal, both in structure and in base content, and near¬ 
ness to erosion spots does not always indicate solonization 
characteristics occurring the soil. 

Table II. Group VIII. 

This comparison consists of two profiles, one eroded and 
the other non-eroded, selected 4 feet apart. The eroded pro¬ 
file shows well developed solonization characters, whereas 
the second profile is more weakly developed. The erosion or 
"slick spots" present,are about 5 inches deep and the soil is 
a glacial loam with undulating topography. The comparison was 
made to illustrate differences occurring in base content and 
proportion in relation to the degree of solonization of pro¬ 
files within a small radius.

8 to 38 per cent. The m.e. of exchange sodium in the solonized 
area profiles range from 0.2 to 4.0 m.e., being higher than 
the normal soil area amounts of 0.3 to 0.5 m.e. Percentages 
show 1 to 21 per cent range for exchange sodium for the solon¬ 
ized area profiles compared with 1 to 3 per cent of exchange 
sodium in the normal soil areas. Total extracted bases (water 
soluble plus the exchange bases), also point to the same con¬ 
clusion. The range of the total extracted sodium from the 
solonized area profiles is from 0.6 m.e. to 12.4 m.e., as 
compared to the normal soil profile sodium limits of 0.5 m.e. 
to 0.8 m.e. Percentages of total extracted sodium vary from 
1 to 35 per cent in the solonized area profiles, and from 1 
to only 5 per cent in the profiles of the normal area. 

It would seem that such differences in sodium content 
and proportion, as are shorn here to exist between the soils 
of normal areas and those of solonized areas, indicate that 
the occurrence of solonized soils could be correlated with 
the presence of greater quantities or proportions of sodium 
in the soil. 

The so-called "solonetz" soils of Alberta appear to con¬ 
tain much the same amount and proportions of both water soluble 
and exchangeable bases as do other soils with this structure 
in various parts of America, Kelley (IV) has published analyses 
on similar soils occurring in California, he found in the 
seven profiles studied that amounts of water soluble salts in¬ 
creased with increasing depth, and that fta salts predominated. 
Also, the sum of the exchange bases found varied from 6.5 m.e.

(1) An arid or semi-arid climate. 

(2) An impervious subsoil or hard-pan layer. 

(3) A temporary abundance of humidity in the soil, inter¬ 
sected with dry periods. 

In English speaking countries the term alkali soil simply 
means saline soil, the salts of which may be the sulphates, 
chlorides, carbonates or nitrates of such bases as sodium, 
magnesium and calcium* Russian scientists felt the need of a 
more specific term, and divided alkali soils into three main 
groups• 

(1) "Solonchak” soils--saline soils which contain an abundance 

of soluble salts. 

(2) "Solonetz" soils-- alkaline soils which contain relatively 

much replaceable sodium. 

(3) "Solod", "Solodi" or "Soloth" soils--soils which were 

formerly solcnetzic, but in which the exchangeable 
sodium has now largely been removed and exchangeable 
hydrogen substituted-- a degraded solonetz soil. 

The morphological features of these soils are characterized 
by the extremely well developed profile of the solonetz in which 
the relatively impervious horizon constitutes the most im¬ 
portant character, whereas both the solonchak and soloth have 
comparatively little profile development in this horizon. 

The main features of the Gedroiz theory as to the origin 
and evolution of these soils is outlined by Mkiforoff (24) 
as follows: 

" formal soil , (brown soil), in these soils the base ex¬ 
change is largely saturated with the divalent cations, the 






4 


colloids are in a flocculated state and the soil is nearly 
neutral. The calcification process is dominant." 

"Solonchak (saline soil). In this case there is an ex¬ 
cess of soluble salts especially sodium, and also usually 
some portion of the divalent cations. The presence of the 
excess salts prevents the hydrolysis of the sodium from the 
exchange and keeps the colloids flocculated. The soil is 
not highly alkaline. This process is best called salinization." 

"Solonetz (alkali soil). These soils have a relatively 
high percentage of exchangeable sodium in the complex and a 
low percentage of soluble salts. As the drainage of the solon¬ 
chak becomes improved, the excess soluble salts are removed. 

In such cases where these salts were essentially all divalent, 
the soil changes back to normal. In most instances, however, 
the solonchak contains considerable amounts of exchange sodium, 
such that when the excess salts are removed the colloids are 
given increased mobility and the soil becomes highly alkaline 
as a result of the hydrolysis of the sodium to form sodium 
hydroxide. Because of the deflocculated state of the colloidal 
portion, the soil exhibits a prismatic structure with hard 
aggregates. This process is called solonization and might 
be said to consist of desalinization plus alkaiinization." 

" Soloth. As soon as the solonetz has formed, the highly 
dispersed colloids tend to move downward in the solum, in a 
sense this process is similar to podsolization, except that 
the original mobility of the colloids is due to exchange sodium 
rather than to exchange hydrogen. The exchange capacity of

with different bases stands in the order ca<Mg<K<iMa<Li• which 
is the exact order of hydration of their respective ions. It 
would seem that the hydration of ions is closely connected 
with the physical properties of soils. 

Murphy and Daniel (20) studied erosion or ,f slick spots" 
of central Oklahoma in relation to the relative dispersion 
coefficients of the exposed hq and the nearly normal A hori¬ 
zons, and noted significant differences in the settling time 
necessary; a much longer time being required for the colloidal 
Bi solution to settle out. 

The Reactions Involved in Base Exchange 

It has been known for almost a century that when a soil 
is treated with a neutral salt solution, the base of the salt 
is fixed in the soil with the corresponding release of a num¬ 
ber of soil bases, - in other words, a part of the base of 
the displacing neutral salt solution displaces an equivalent 
amount of the soil bases. The former passes out of solution 
and becomes a component of the soil complex, and the latter 
passes into solution and may then be leached away, provided 
that insoluble compounds are not formed. When chlorides, ni¬ 
trates or acetates are used as the anion of the leaching salt 
solution, the salts formed by base exchange are highly soluble, 
but the use of carbonates and phosphates leads to the forma¬ 
tion of insoluble precipitates. The process of ion exchange 
may be illustrated as follows:

errors introduced toy using contaminated Berkefeld filters. 

The preceding analyses show in the first column the sodium 
extracted toy leaching ten grams of soil with 500 c.c.*s of water- 
a ratio of 1:50, The three succeeding columns indicate the 
sodium extracted toy shaking the same soil samples for thirty 
minutes in the varying concentrations of soil and water, namely, 
1:5, 1:50, and 1:100. The filtering after shaking in the case 
of the 1:5 and 1:50 solutions was done toy means of berkefeld 
filter candles using suction, No significant contamination 
from the filters occurred in the case of the 1•5 solution, 
tout contamination was particularly marked in the first four 
samples of the 1:50 solution. Filtering was done with three

Water soluble Na appears to be important throughout the 
clay profile, whereas it is not so important or present in 
such quantities in the sandy loam soil, but in the latter pro¬ 
file it does increase rapidly with depth, nigh sulphate con¬ 
tent in all horizons where fta occurs in marked amounts suggests 
the presence of the soluble fta^SO^. The higher concentration 
of sodium in the clay flat indicates little, or no percolation 
of water, whereas the removal of salts by the downward percola¬ 
tion of water has been extensive in the sandy soil profile. 

The water soluble ua and Mg of the upper horizons is much as 
expected, these being smaller in amount in the sandy soil. 

If any great amounts of Ga or Mg other than exchangeable do 
occur in the upper horizons of the clay profile, they probably 
exist mainly in the carbonate form, rather than as the highly 
water soluble sulphate, the sulphate in these horizons being 
mainly united to fta. The water soluble ua and Mg in the lowest 
horizon of both profiles occur in such amounts that large 
quantities apparently exist as the sulphate. The water soluble 
Ca extracted from the Bg horizon of the clay profile, exceeds 
by far the amounts which were extracted with water in any other 
profile examined in this investigation. We may say that the 
lowest horizon of the clay profile is very high in the sul¬ 
phates of Ga and Mg whereas the HagSO^ occurs in considerable 
quantities throughout the profile. The sandy loam profile is 
low in water soluble salts, with considerable accumulation 
of the sulphates of ua. Mg, and fta in the B3 horizon. 

The exchange constituents determined show some sulphate 
still present in both profiles, which was not removed with the 





41 


Water soluble bases show an increase of* Na with increasing 
depth, though this does not appear to be present as the sul¬ 
phate. Since both profiles are relatively shallow, sulphates 
may be present at greater depths, beyond the lime horizon. 

Water soluble Na is slightly greater in amounts in each hori¬ 
zon of the eroded profile. These differences are insignifi¬ 
cant since the divalent bases also occur in greater amounts. 

The exchange base analyses show greater amounts of ha in 
the eroded than in the non-eroded profile. However, the ex¬ 
changeable divalent bases have increased greatly, especially 
in the lower horizons, and total base exchange capacity re¬ 
sults (compare last two columns of table) show that consider¬ 
able error has been introduced in the Bg horizons by solubility 
effect, indicating probable carbonate accumulations. 

The A table shows that water soluble ha in the non-eroded 
profile occurs in as great or greater proportions than the 
water soluble divalent bases, which holds true only in the 
lowest horizon of the eroded profile. The relatively high 
proportion of the water soluble divalent bases present, may 
be one explanation for the invasion of grasses upon the eroded 
surface. The proportion of exchangeable Na is relatively low 
in both profiles, the greater concentrations occurring in the 
B i horizons. Here the effect of Na content on the degree of 
structural development is marked, since the eroded profile B^ 
is much better developed and also contains relatively much 
more Na. Exchangeable divalent bases are markedly dominant 
in both profiles. Total extracted base percentages again show 
higher Na content in the better developed profile Bi horizon. 






42 


this being almost double the proportion of £ja in the less 
solonized non-eroded • 

The conclusions of this group comparison are that no 
significant differences in base content of the two profiles 
occur which might account for erosion* The eroded profile 
does contain more iMa throughout, both in amounts and in re¬ 
lative proportions to the divalent bases. These differences 
do not seem to be sufficiently great to be significant. The 
degree of development of the solonized horizons appears to 
be correlated with exchangeable Wa content. Percolation of 
water evidently tends to lower the J^a content and thus produces 
a more normal profile structure. 

Table II Group III. 

This comparison consists of three profiles, being selected 
to the center, at the side and about 30 feet distant from the 
erosion respectively. The eroded profile represents a relative¬ 
ly large area from which the surface has been removed, and this 
profile is intermediate in structural development to the other 
two profiles. The second profile which was taken at the edge 
of the erosion, exhibits a strongly solonized structure, where¬ 
as the third, profile is practically normal in this respect, 
being taken from a slightly higher level. The area is undulat¬ 
ing in topography and the surface soil is a fine sandy loam.- 
Sulphates were not determined. 

The most significant feature of the wrater soluble base 
analyses, is the difference exhibited by the third, and most

Water soluble Na occurs in much greater amounts in the 
eroded profile, increases of Na with depth occurring in both 
profiles where it evidently occurs as the sulphate. The parent 
shales appear to contain considerable gypsum as well as water 
soluble Mg. It is noted that differences apparently exist in 
the solubility of the Wa in these shales. 

exchangeable Wa occurs in smaller amounts, but is more 
abundant in the upper horizons of the eroded profile, where 
leaching has evidently not been so great. The exchangeable 
divalent bases are greatly in excess of the exchange Na in 
both profiles. Total base exchange capacity analyses indicate 
an unsaturated condition in the A horizon of the eroded profile, 
and slight unsaturation may occur in the same horizon of the 
non-eroded profile. In the lower horizons, considerable 
amounts of carbonates appear to be present. 

Table A shows that the percentage of soluble Wa is much 
greater In the eroded profile, being dominant to the divalent 
bases in two of these horizons. As pointed out previously, 
this is probably the result of limited water percolation through 
the heavily solonized horizon. The proportion of exchange 
Na is lov/ in both profiles, but total extracted base percent¬ 
ages show that Na is consistently higher in the eroded and 
more strongly solonized profile. 

The conclusions of this comparison are that base unsatura¬ 
tion does occur in the A horizons of some solonized profiles, 
but evidently is not a constant character. The sodium content 
of the soil appears to be related to the degree of solonization. 
The removal of most of the A horizon in the eroded spots leads 



91 


normal area profiles. (Actually one of the normal area pro¬ 
files was located in the solonized area, but was in a strictly 
normal profile district.) This range of sodium is presented 
in Table Vi. 

Table VI. 

In this table, the ranges of sodium for the (J horizons 
of five solonized area profiles are given. However, these 
will not be considered in the comparison, since no such data 
was determined in the normal soil area. Also, the upper limits 
of exchangeable sodium in one profile showed 8.7 m.e. of sodium 
In the Bi horizon, whereas the upper limit in the B]_ of all 
the rest of the solonized area profiles was 4.0 m.e. or lower. 
In a second horizon of the solonized area, due to low ex¬ 
change calcium and magnesium present, the upper percentage 
limit of exchange sodium was 35 per cent, whereas the same 
horizon in all other solonized area profiles were not above 
17 per cent. Obviously it would be misleading to include these 
amounts in the comparison, and they are placed In brackets, and 
are not included in the discussion. The limits given represent 
the extreme range of sodium in the profiles with the exception 
of the o horizons. 

The range of the water soluble sodium in the solonized 
area is from 0.2 m.e. to 8.3 m.e., whereas the corresponding 
limits in the normal soil are 0.2 m.e. to 1.4 m.e. The per¬ 
centage limits of water soluble sodium show much the same 
relation, those of the solonized area profiles varying from 
11 to 80 per cent in comparison to the normal area limits of

for the cations to he located on the inner surface of the par¬ 
ticles, the rate of diffusion in solid bodies being very slow* 
ne believes the cause of adsorption was a chemical attraction 
between the bases and the soil acids. 

Stephenson (32) points out that adsorption is conceded 
to be a surface phenomenon, whether physical or chemical. 
Adsorption formerly was considered to be due entirely to physi¬ 
cal forces, but at the present time evidence indicates that it 
may be entirely chemical or that it is imnecessary to make a 
distinction between chemical and physical forces in such re¬ 
actions. boil minerals are attacked chemically onl3r at the 
surfaces. The reaction goes on with great rapidity because 
the colloidal particles are small and present a large sur¬ 
face area per unit weight, and the reaction is limited to 
surfaces. The reaction per unit area may be the same as for 
coarse particles. 

The Identification of the Base Exchange complex 

Since the publication of the classical investigations 
of Way in 1852 on base exchange in soils, several investiga¬ 
tors have reported on the nature of the complex responsible 
for the interchange of bases. Way noted that the clay frac¬ 
tion of the soil exhibited exchange properties to the great¬ 
est degree and suggested that the inorganic exchange consti¬ 
tuents of soils belonged to the alumina-silicates, which are 
analogous to the zeolites. Gedroiz holds that replaceable 
bases occur either as humates or in zeolitic forms.

It is also well known that solutions of neutral salts 
have a greater solubility effect upon some soil constituents 
than has water. It was decided to carry out an experiment to 
compare the leaching effects of water and normal ammonium ace¬ 
tate solution upon three materials which had been mixed in 
pure sand, in such proportions that about 5 per cent of the 
ten grams of material leached in each case, consisted of cal¬ 
cium. The materials used were lime plaster, u. P. UaCOs and 
0. P. GaSC 4 * 2 H o, since the latter two, are two of the princi¬ 
pal constituents introducing the solubility error. The amount 
of the leaching solution used in each case was 750 c.c.s. 
Excellent duplicate results were obtained and the analyses 
are given below.

candles, which were v/ashed, leached with distilled water and 
used again the same order, i.e. one candle was used to filter 
the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth solutions, etc. As the 
candles were repeatedly used with the dilute soil solutions, 
the contamination rapidly became insignificant, especially 
with increasing water soluble sodium content of the soil* 

This leads to the conclusion that suctioning with a consider- 

# 

able quantity of distilled water previous to filtering such 
dilute soil solution, should remove any appreciable amounts 
of sodium present in the filter* It is of interest to note, 
that contamination, if present in the 1:5 solutions, is not 
significant. However, the solution which is ten times more 
dilute (1:50) rapidly extracts sodium from the filter candles, 
and the later concentration of such solution for analysis 
greatly emphasizes such contamination. 

Folded filter papers were used to filter the 1:100 soil 
solution to minimise possibilities of sodium contamination. 

Shaking with the 1:100 solution (last column) apparently 
gave the most comparable results to the leaching method (first 
column), especially where the concentrations of soluble sodium 
were high as in the two lower horizons (samples #261 and #262)• 
In the 1:100 shaken solution some of the exchangeable sodium in 
the upper horizons has evidently been extracted as water soluble 
sodium since approximately twice as much sodium has been ex¬ 
tracted by this method as by the leaching. Where such dis¬ 
crepancies betv/een the two methods occur, the soluble sodium 
content in such horizons is low. Where it was necessary to

there has been no significant decrease in soluble Na in any 
horizon. Surface cultivation has not, as yet, produced any 
marked decrease in JNa content in the lower horizons. 

Table II, Group VII. 

This comparison consists of two profiles, neither of them 
being eroded. One profile was selected 4 feet from an erosion 
spot, whereas the second was approximately 40 feet distant and 
well removed from any erosion. Both profiles were weakly 
solonized, although solonization was more marked in the pro¬ 
file near the erosion. The region was an undulating glacial 
loam. The object of the comparison was to determine if any 
great difference in base content occurred between these two 
profiles on the same level in regard to proximity of erosion. 

The analyses are in harmony with previous results obtained 
on weakly solonized profiles, situated on the same general 
level. Water soluble Na is low in both profiles, with a gradual 
increase with depth. Water soluble Ua and Mg occur in about 
normal quantities, and sulphates do not appear to be present 
in any great amount. It may be said in general, that the 
amounts of water soluble salts in these prefiles are very 
small. 

The quantities of exchangeable Na are also very low with 
little increase with depth of profile, whereas the divalent 
bases have increased considerably. The base exchange capacity 
analysis indicate that carbonates occur in both profiles in 
considerable quantities, especially in the lower horizons. 

Base unsaturation apparently does not occur. 

Table A indicates that water soluble Na becomes dominant

From a. consideration of* these two profiles, it is apparent 
that very slightly higher water soluble sodium content and pro¬ 
portion to the divalent bases, is a feature of the most normal 
profiles in the solonized area when compared to profiles occur¬ 
ring in strictly normal soil areas. 

Since only the most normal appearing profiles in the solon¬ 
ized area were selected for comparison, it would appear that 
soils from such areas have the higher sodium content due to 
the presence of the higher content of water soluble sodium, 
which has not been leached away probably as a result of the 
lower precipitation and the lack of adequate drainage in such 
areas. 


Table V. 

This table is presented to illustrate differences in base 
content and relative proportions occurring in a normal profile 
just outside the solonized area, and a strongly solonized pro¬ 
file in the Sullivan Lake region. The soil type in the two 
profiles is the same, and the topography in both cases is un¬ 
dulating. 

The water soluble analyses indicate very little difference 
in either the amounts or relative proportions of the divalent 
bases present in the two profiles, however, it will be noted 
that the water soluble ha is consistently greater in the solon¬ 
ized area profile where it increases in quantity with increas¬ 
ing depth, whereas in the normal profile, the ha content is 
very low and remains practically constant throughout. The 
exchange base analyses present practically the same picture.

Summary 

Tile so-called morpnological solonetz soils or Alberta do 
not belong to the true alkali soils, but are alkalized to a 
lesser degree. The profile morphology is typically solonetzic, 
but lacks the solonetz chemistry. This is in agreement with 
other investigations carried out in several parts of America. 

hio significant differences exist in base content or pro¬ 
portion of bases, between eroded and non-eroded solonetz pro¬ 
files which are immediately adjacent to each other. Slight 
increases in water soluble sodium occur in the B 2 horizons of 
the eroded profile, apparently being in the sulphate form. 

This increase may be explained by the relatively impervious 
Bl horizon preventing the percolation of water through the 
profile. Any precipitation evaporates rapidly from the ex¬ 
posed surface. 

Significant differences in base content and proportions 
were observed between very weakly solonized profiles and those 
which showed a decided solonetz morphology. In several cases, 
these profiles were located only a few yards apart. This 
feature was especially marked in two sandy loam profiles which 
were compared (Table II Group IX), where the differences in 
base proportion and amount were attributed to differences in 
depth at which the impervious subsoil occurred. 

In all solonized profiles analyzed, exchangeable sodium 
constituted a greater percentage of the exchangeable bases in 
the strongly solonized horizons, than occurred in the more 
weakly solonized adjacent horizons.

accumulation. 

Bg, b 3 , B 4 - the lowest horizon usually indicates an ac¬ 
cumulation of electrotytes - most of them being precipitated 
as the carbonate. 

Typical solonetz profiles likewise are characterized by 
the development of the general horizons A, B, and u. The A 1 
horizons of the solonetz profiles have no well developed struc¬ 
ture, an do not differ materially in appearance from the A hori 
zons of normal soils. However, the solonetz soil profiles dif¬ 
fer decidedly in the following characters which are rarely 
found in normal profiles. 

(1) The presence of a light colored extremely leached, 
ashy A2 horizon immediately on top of the B. This varies in 
thickness from a mere film to 2-3 inches, 

(2) The occurrence of a relatively impermeable, defloc- 
culated, highly colloidal horizon in which columnar struc¬ 
tural development is at a maximum. The upper surfaces of 
these columns, where well developed, are oftern termed ”round- 
tops” from their characteristic biscuit-like appearance. 

Where erosion of the A horizon has occurred, the crevices 
between these columns have been filled with highly dispersed 
colloidal clay, resulting in a smooth impermeable washed clay 
surface. The entire upper B horizon is extremely colloidal 
and is almost impervious to water. 

The lower B horizons do not differ materially in structure 
from such horizons in normal soil profiles though the kind and 
concentrations of the various chemical constituents may not be 


similar.

(3) Leaching with Neutral Salt Solutions. This is the 
most common method. The neutral salts commonly used are 
HH 4 CI or NH 4 AC. 

Choice of Neutral Leaching Salt . 

Sodium chloride was the first salt so employed, but 
since sodium was one of the important bases to be determined, 
ammonium salts were utilized, either the chloride or the ace¬ 
tate. holowaychuk ( 11 ) found that either of these salts pro¬ 
duced closely agreeing results and that the acetate had several 
advantages. 

Schollenberger and Dreibelbis (29) state the following 
desirable qualities of NH^Ac as a leaching agent. 

(1) "it has pronounced buffer properties around pH. 7. 

(2) It is easily expelled by a simple evaporation. 

(3) It is inexpensive and easily prepared." 

The Problem 

The problem undertaken in this investigation was to ob¬ 
tain specific information regarding the chemical composition 
of morphological solonetz soils in Alberta. In this investi¬ 
gation, attempts were made to obtain information as follows: 

(1) To determine if the morphological solonetz soils of 
Alberta were similar to those in other parts of the world, 
both in exchangeable and water soluble bases. 

(2) To find if any appreciable differences in base content

the carbonates are present in the soil, usually as (ja(JC> 3 , due 
to their low water and. high acetate solubility, serious error 
in the determination of exchange calcium results. 

In several cases it was found impossible to leach the 
highly impermeable colloidal B]_ horizons with water. This 
made it necessary to obtain an extract by some other method 
in order to determine the soluble bases. This was done by 
using suction on a Berkefeld filter candle. Then a fresh 
soil sample was leached with the acetate solution, and the 
amount of water soluble bases subtracted from the exchangeable 
bases found. This' procedure involved a new error. It fre¬ 
quently happened that one sample of the horizon would leach 
whereas its duplicate would not, in which case suction filter¬ 
ing was carried out. Upon analysis, it was found that although 
soluble calcium and magnesitiai results agreed closely In the 
two extraction methods, the sodium content of the Berkefeld 
filtered extract was much higher than the leached sample on 
the same soil. It was also noted in several cases where both 
duplicates had to be suction filtered, and a fresh sample 
leached with acetate to determine exchangeable bases, that 
the water extracted soluble sodium obtained by the Berkefeld 
filtered duplicates did not agree and were often in excess 
of the total exchange sodium found. 

The error was traced to sodium remaining in the filters 
from more concentrated soil solution extractions--although 
these filters had been thoroughly washed and leached with dis¬ 
tilled water. It is emphasized that when suction filtering a 



28 


more concentrated soil solution such as 1:5, sodium adsorption 
by the Berkefeld candle does not interfere. It appears that 
the more dilute solutions emphasize any error involved through 
adsorption of sodium from previous, and especially more concen¬ 
trated, soil solutions. 

Parker (27) has reported on the adsorption of phosphates 
by the Pasteur-Chamberland filters when dilute soil extracts 
were used. He concluded that the adsorption of phosphorus was 
largely due to soil colloids held in the pores of the filter 
candle, since new filters did not adsorb phosphorus. Pasteur- 
Chamberland filters are composed of unglazed porcelain, whereas 
the Berkefeld filters are of infusorial or diatomaceous earth 
composition. It would seem logical that the adsorption of fta 
by these filters would be due to much the same cause. It is 
suggested that when filtering dilute soil extracts for either 
sodium or phosphate, that several litres of distilled water be 
suctioned through each candle prior to the dilute soil solu¬ 
tion. 

The sodium content of the horizon was of considerable 
importance in this investigation, and where water leaching was 
impossible, it was necessary to use some other method of ex¬ 
traction whereby a similar amount of sodium could be extracted 
to that obtained by the leaching method. A soil profile was 
leached and the v/ater soluble sodium extracted determined. 

Then the same profile samples were shaken on an end-over-end 
shaker for thirty minutes with water in various concentrations, 
filtered, and made up to volume and sodium determined on an 
aliquot. The results are given below.

horizons of this soil when compared with the clay flat profile, 
until the B 3 horizon is reached. JNo unsaturation is evident 
in either profile. 

Table I A. 

The results from Table I are here presented in another 
form. The water soluble percentages show the dominance of 
the soluble ha salts in the upper horizons of both profiles, 
nowever, in the lowest horizon of each profile, the less sol¬ 
uble <ja and Mg sulphates are the dominant water soluble salts 
present. 

The percentages of the exchange bases determined show 
the dominance of the divalent bases in both profiles, how¬ 
ever, in all horizons of the clay profile, and in the lowest 
horizon of the sandy profile, this dominance should not be so 
marked, as much of the exchange ua and Mg determined was actu¬ 
ally present in the soil in the water soluble form. 

The percentage of total extracted bases indicates that 
ha is relatively more important in the sandy loam than in the 
clay profile, though total extracted divalent bases are still 
much the dominant bases in both profiles. 

The m. e. of total extracted bases shows the high content 
of the various types of bases in the clay flat profile, where 
accumulation might have occurred from surrounding areas; bases 
in the soluble form being very abundant, and evidently little 
salt removal from the flat has occurred. Total bases in the 
sandy soil are low and percolation and leaching of bases to 
lower horizons is suggested. 

We may state from the results of this comparison (Tables 
I and I A) that the clay flat profile has a high content of

yard radius, tut on slightly different levels and with vary¬ 
ing degrees of profile development. The topography is un¬ 
dulating and the soil type is a solonized silt loam. 

The most significant differences between these four pro¬ 
files is that of profile #3 from the other three profiles. 

This is a non-eroded, very slightly solonized profile, a short 
distance from any erosion. Smaller differences in bases exist 
among the other three profiles. 

Water soluble analyses indicate that ha is comparatively 
high in the more solonized profiles #1, #2, and #4. In pro¬ 
files #1 and #4, which are both eroded, a high concentration 
of ha 2 SC >4 and gypsum is apparently present in the b 2 horizon. 
(Samples #361, and #364). This relatively high concentration 
of the sulphate appears to be a common occurrence in the H >2 
horizons of eroded profiles, and seems to be a result of the 
impermeable Bi horizon developed. Any precipitation occurring 
on these eroded spots does not pass through the but is 
evaporated, after lying on the eroded surface for some time. 
The absence of leaching through this horizon, results in the 
accumulation of the sulphates relatively close to the surface 
--otherwise they would be leached to a much greater depth. 

It is seen that the water soluble ha content of profile #3 is 
quite low in comparison to the other three profiles. 

The exchange base analyses also show that the content of 
Na is greater, especially in the horizons, in the three 
more solonized profiles, although in all cases the exchange¬ 
able divalent bases are much in excess of the exchange ha. 


78 


Total "base exchange capacity results (see last two columns 
of table) Indicate that carbonates occur In considerable 
amounts in the lower horizons of all four profiles. 

Table A shows that water soluble sodium occurs in slightly 
greater quantities in profiles #1, #2, and #4, whereas it is 
less important in the third and less solonized profile. Water 
soluble Wa content of the three profiles may be important, in 
that Wa may directly displace the divalent bases from the ex¬ 
change complex, and thus increase the amounts of exchange Wa, 
However, the water soluble Wa would probably have to occur in 
much greater excess than it does here, to have such replacement 
occur. The exchangeable Wa, while it is proportionally much 
lower than the water soluble Wa, is still of considerable im¬ 
portance especially in the B^ horizons in the three more 
solonized profiles. The third profile again shows the least 
proportion of this base. Total extracted base percentages 
give much the same picture. It should be emphasized that in 
all the profiles in this comparison the greater proportions 
of Wa occur in the horizons. 

The conclusions of this comparison are that relative dif¬ 
ferences in base content and proportion occur in profiles 
selected within a very small radius. Sodium appears to be 
relatively more important in the solonized profiles, and there 
appears to be a direct relationship between Wa content and 
structural development. An accumulation of the sulphates of 
Ca, Mg and Wa i3 noted in the Bg horizons of the eroded pro¬ 
files, in the case of the cultivated eroded solonized profile.

to evaporation, rather than to the downward percolation of 
water through the soil* This probably causes greater amounts 
of soluble sodium salts to remain relatively close to the sur¬ 
face* Thus the amounts of exchange sodium tend to remain 
fairly constant and the horizons apparently retain their 
deflocculated and impermeable character. The shallow depths 
at which the parent shales occur with their apparent high i\ia 
content, possibly has been one factor in causing the original 
erosion* 

Table II* Group IX. 

This comparison consists of two profiles, one of which was 
located at the edge of an erosion spot, and showed pronounced 
solonized structure. The second was selected some 50 feet dis¬ 
tant on the same level, and showed little structural develop¬ 
ment with a very sandy subsoil. The topography was undulating 
and the soil type is an alluvial sandy loam. Since the parent 
shales below the solonized profile occurred at 24 inches, 
this comparison was made to illustrate differences in soloniza- 
tion which apparently were due to an impervious subsoil occur¬ 
ring relatively close to the surface. 

Water soluble iMa occurs in much greater amounts in the 
solonized profile with high concentrations in the parent shales 
where it appears to occur largely as the sulphate, consider¬ 
able gypsum and water soluble Mg also occur in the B 3 horizon. 

The non-solonized profile has very small amounts of water soluble 
bases present, at least to depth of 40 inches, and leaching 
appears to have been extreme. Apparently the parent shales 
occur at much greater depths in this case. The exchange base

The presence of alkali in soils was observed and methods 
of reclaiming such areas were studied long before scientists 
were able to account for their origin. However, it was not 
■until 1894 that the presence of columnar horizons in alkali 
soils was first pointed out by Zemiatchensky. This phenomenon 

of the soil profile has now been observed in many parts of the 

♦ 

world which are located in arid or semi-arid regions. 

At the present time, considerable difference of opinion 
still exists as to the evolution of alkali soils. In general, 
theories of Russian investigators as to the origin of these 
soils have been followed to a great degree, Oedroiz postu¬ 
lated that relatively large proportions of sodium in the soil 
were necessary to evolve the columnar structure and physical 
properties now present. More recently it has been noted by 
such workers as Kelley and fiikiforoff that the morphology of 
at least some of these soils does not agree with the present 
chemical content. It has been said that the study of exchange® 
able bases with the previous determination of soluble bases 
has been the cornerstone in regard to the study of alkali soils. 

Theory of Evolution of Alkali Soils 
Hilgard defined alkali soils as those containing exces¬ 
sive amounts of soluble salts of continental origin, tie 
designated them as a result of climate and was the first to 
put forth a scientific theory regarding their origin. 

de f Sigmond (5) concluded from his investigation that the 
factors reponsible for the formation of alkali soils were:

The Occurrence of Colonized Soils 

Solonized soils in varying degree appear to be almost 
world wide in distribution where low precipitation occurs. 
Russian investigations on these soil3 are numerous and de• 
Sigmond (5) has reported on their presence in nungary. 

Nevros and Zvorykin (25) have reported a solonetz red soil 
in Attica. 

Storie (33), Kelley (17), Meschmidt(21), Murphy and 
Daniel (20), Fieger and Sturgis (7), Rost (28), Kellogg (13), 
and Rikiforoff (23), have reported on morphological solonetz 
soils in various parts of the united States. Ellis and uald- 
well (6) found a magnesium slay solonetz in southern Manitoba 
and Mitchell and Riecken (19) report the occurrence of sol- 
onized soils in southern Saskatchewan. The presence of 
eroded spots appears to be a characteristic feature in some 
of these areas at least. 

Soil Origin and the Morphology of Sol o netz 
Soils in Alberta 

A brief description of soil formation and development in 
general is of importance. Soils in Alberta have originally 
been derived from two sources: 

(1) Those soils which have been deposited upon the parent 
shales or sandstones by glacial action, the glacial deposits 
being referred to as glacial "drift" or "till". These are the 
glacial or transported soils. 

(2) Those soils which have developed "in situ" from 
weathering of the parent sandstone and shales.

It was also noted that soil types in the same region 
vary in their degree of solonization and erosion, silt loams 
being much the most susceptible. Loams are more intermediate 
in this tendency, the extremely light and heavy soil types 
being in general more normal in character. In general, solon- 
ized soils are associated with the more arid regions of the 
earth f s surface; climate and a topography which tends to al¬ 
low inadequate drainage appear to have been the main factors 
in their formation, soil types being a secondary and more 
localized factor. 


Analytical Methods 

Ten grams of air-dry soil was the size of sample used in 
each case, and each was determined in duplicate. The soil was 
ground slightly to pulverize lumps and to secure a more uni¬ 
form sample. The granular structure of the soil particles 
was not completely destroyed. All bases determined were re¬ 
ported as milligram equivalents per 100 grams of air-dry soil. 

A continuous automatic leaching apparatus was used, which 
was set up as follows: a lOOQu.C. florence flask was fitted 
with a tightly fitting rubber stopper through which two holes 
had previously been bored and two pieces of glass tubing (one 
long and one short) had been inserted. By means of a stand 
and ring, the florence flask was inverted over a small U-shaped 
glass funnel. The funnel was first equipped with a disc of 
glass wool over the outlet tube and a mat of paper pulp was 
laid on top (special care being exercised to prevent the glass

have been removed, probably by percolating water to other areas. 
It seems logical to assume that this displaced i'Ja (due to its 
solubility) has finally accumulated on lower, more level areas, 
which is the type of topography upon which solonization and 
erosion appear to have maximum development. 

Table II Group V, 

The two profiles in this comparison were selected within 
a few feet of each other in a glacial loam area. It is Im¬ 
portant to note that this area is rolling topography, soloniza¬ 
tion is very weakly developed, and erosion spots are few and 
largely grassed over. 

Little or no significant differences exist in these two 
profiles, and the eroded profile appears to be almost normal. 
Differences in total and relative proportion of soluble bases 
might be attributed to sampling and analytical error, bodium 
content, both in soluble and exchangeable bases is very low 
and the divalent bases are dominant. Low sulphate content and 
discrepancies in total exchange capacity indicate the abundance 
of carbonates in the B2 horizon of both profiles. 

This profile comparison in rolling topography supports 
the assumption that good drainage tends to decrease the con¬ 
tent of water soluble, and eventually the content of the ex¬ 
change, sodium. The abundance of calcium carbonate also ap¬ 
pears to be important in converting the solonized to a normal 
profile. 

Table II. Group VI. 

The comparison presented in this table consists of analyses 
on four profiles, one of which was selected from an eroded spot 
in cultivation. The profiles were all selected within a 25

features, and as was previously pointed out, a higher content 
of sodium is a character of these profiles. This comparison 
does show that soils lacking the characteristic solonetz pro¬ 
file development even where present in solonized areas, do not 
differ materially either in quantity or proportion of bases 
from soils of normal areas, although the quantity of water 
soluble sodium in the lower horizons tends to be greater. 

Table IV. Group II. 

The two profiles in this comparison were selected near 
Provost and near Brooks respectively. The normal area profile 
from Provost is a silt loam, whereas the very weakly solonized 
profile from Brooks is a silty loam. 

As in the previous group comparison, the main difference 
in the base content of the two profiles is the slightly greater 
amount of Na, with the attendant increase with depth in the 
solonized area profile. The content of water soluble divalent 
bases appears to be approximately the same, wo significant 
differences occur in the content or proportion of exchangeable 
bases. Total base exchange capacity analyses indicate no un- 
saturation. 

Table A shows that the percentage of water soluble wa to 
the divalent bases is greater in the solonized area profile, 
and Wa here becomes dominant in the lower horizons. The ex¬ 
change base percentages indicate Na to be consistently, though 
not significantly higher in proportion to the divalent area 
bases in the solonized area profile than is found in the nor¬ 
mal profile. Total extracted base percentages give much the 
same picture.

Surface erosion appears to be related to the degree of 
solonization and the soil type. The results presented in¬ 
dicate that solonization of the profile may be to some degree 
correlated with sodium content, which is one cause of defloc¬ 
culation and impermeability. It seems possible that erosion 
may be directly related to the sodium content of such soils. 
Joel (12) has suggested that erosion may be correlated with 
the comparative closeness of the underlying non-calcareous 
parent shales, since the glacial till appears to be relatively 
shallow or absent in these areas. 

Soil profiles which exhibit extremely weak solonetz 
morphology, even though occurring in heavily solonized areas, 
do not differ materially in base content or proportion from 
soil profiles of normal areas with the exception of the greater 
increase of sodium with depth. This greater concentration of 
sodium in the lower horizons in the solonized areas appears 
to be a direct result of incomplete drainage combined with 
the lower precipitation of the solonized area in general. 

The analysis of the one cultivated eroded profile which 
was heavily solonized, indicates that cultivation is of little 
value in reclaiming such lands unless the impervious B horizon 
is disturbed. The relative proportion of bases present after 
surface cultivation, have not altered significantly, indicating 
probable small physical change in the condition of the subsoil.

appear to be much the same in this respect. 

Base unsaturation of the A horizons does not appear to be 
a characteristic feature of these solonetz soils. Definite 
unsaturation was found in only two of the profiles studied. 
Unsaturation apparently does not occur in the normal soils of 
the area. 

The relative solubility effects of water and normal am¬ 
monium acetate upon lime plaster, calcium carbonate and hydrated 
calcium sulphate are reported. Differences in solubility ef¬ 
fect tend to introduce severe error in the determination of 
exchange bases.

The larger proportion of soils in Alberta are of the 
former type. However, it is important to note that in the 
south-eastern portion of the province the present deposition 
of glacial "till" for the most part is relatively thin, in 
many cases the parent shales and sandstones being exposed. 

In this case it is difficult to distinguish and state definitely 
the origin of these soils, but it is reasonable to assume that 
at least a portion of these soils might be more correctly desig¬ 
nated residual soils. 

Normal soil profiles are characterized by three general 
horizons, namely. A, B, and u. 

A is the surface horizon and is that portion of the soil 
which has undergone weathering. 

The B horizon is immediately below the A, and is the hori¬ 
zon of accumulation of various products which have passed down¬ 
ward by various means from A. 

The G horizon, being parent material by definition, 
varies widely - being sandstones or shales in Alberta. 

It is necessary to divide the two upper horizons into 
two or more subdivisions: 

Ai- The horizon of grass root accumulation, and where 
leaching has not been extensive. 

Ag- Usually a lighter colored horizon, where leaching 
has occurred to a greater extent. 

B Q - Transition horizon between A and B. It includes 
the flaked off portions of the B. 

The horizon into which the colloidal matter from 
the A horizon has been leached - the horizon of colloid

destroy any organic matter present. The nitrates were then 
converted to chlorides by treating with 25 c.c. of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid and evaporating to dryness. Then the re¬ 
sidues were taken up with a few c.c. f s of concentrated hydro¬ 
chloric, approximately 100 c.c. ! s of water added and filtra¬ 
tion and washing with hot water then carried out. The solu¬ 
tions were then made up to volume and aliquots taken for the 
determination of exchangeable Ca, Mg, and Na. The sulphates 
were also determined in this leachate, but in general due to 
their high solubility, these v/ere present mainly in the water 
leachate. 

After the acetate leachate was removed, the soil was im¬ 
mediately saturated with calcium, by leaching with 750 c.c. 
of normal calcium chloride solution. Then the excess calcium 
(that which was theoretically not held by the exchange complex) 
was removed by leaching with distilled water, until the leach¬ 
ate gave no further test for calcium. The soil was then leached 
with 750 c.c. of normal ammonium acetate solution. The leach¬ 
ate thus obtained was treated in a similar manner as the ex¬ 
change leachate, but analyzed for calcium only. The milligram 
equivalents per 100 grams of soil in this solution were con¬ 
sidered to be a measure of the total base exchange capacity. 

Calcium was determined by precipitating as the oxalate 
and titrating with 0.05 N. Kmn04* 

Magnesium was determined by evaporating the calcium oxa¬ 
late filtrate to a low volume and treating with a 10 per cent 
microcosmic salt (MaMH4HP04) solution, brought down under am- 
moniacal conditions and let stand over-night. The precipitate 




24 


was filtered off in the morning, air dried, dissolved in stan¬ 
dard JigSO^ and titrated with standard naOH. 

The sodium was determined gravimetrically, being preci¬ 
pitated as the triple salt-uranyl zinc sodium acetate-accord¬ 
ing to Barber and Kolthoff (1). 

Sulphates were determined gravimetrically by precipitat¬ 
ing with 10 per cent Baulg solution, filtered, and ignited in 
the muffle furnace to a temperature of 700Ou* 

Potassium was not determined. 

Errors Involved in the Method 
Chapman and Kelley (4) have emphasized the complexity 
and number of interfering factors involved in such investiga¬ 
tions, and the difficulty of securing good results. Leaching 
the soil with a neutral salt solution for any extended period, 
tends to introduce errors by dissolving bases which do not oc¬ 
cur in the soil in the exchange form. 

In this investigation, 500 c.e. of water was 

used to extract the soluble salts. It was decided to con¬ 
tinue extraction with a second similar quantity from ten soil 
samples, to determine if further soluble bases were obtained. 
In each case It was found that the second leachate contained 
further bases, principally the less soluble calcium and mag¬ 
nesium, and the amounts, though small. Indicated that extended 
leaching continues to extract smaller amounts of the bases. 
This would indicate that a portion of the so-called exchange¬ 
able bases could be removed as water soluble, if water leach¬ 
ing was continued for some period.

Total extracted base percentages shov; that the proportion of 
iMa is consistently higher in the solonized profiles. 

The significant feature of this group comparison is the 
low amounts of soluble bases and exchange Na present in the 
more normal profile. This could mainly be attributed to dif¬ 
ferences in drainage, either being slightly higher or by hav¬ 
ing a more pervious subsoil. 

Table II. Group IV. 

These two profiles which were analyzed and the results 
given in this comparison were selected within a few miles of 
each other, since the first profile occurred in a normal soil 
area. Both surface soils are a fine sandy loam in texture. 

The purpose of this comparison was to determine if any marked 
differences in base content and proportion occurred in a badly 
solonized profile, and in a normal profile taken from a normal 
area. The profiles were selected as close to each other as 
was possible in this case. It should be noted that the normal 
profile is much deeper than the solonized profile. 

The water soluble analyses indicate that the content of 
water soluble iMa is greater in the solonized profile, with 
higher concentrations much closer to the soil surface. In 
the normal area profile, no great accumulation of water soluble 
IMa occurs until the parent shales are encountered at 4 feet. 

The presence of the sulphate wherever Na concentrations occur, 
suggest the presence of considerable ftagSC^. in the lower 
horizons of both profiles, some gypsum appears to be present. 

Exchangeable base analyses also show higher fta in the 





83 


analyses also show more Ma present in the solonized profile, 
though the divalent bases also occur in greater amounts, being 
dominant to the Ma, especially in the parent shale. The amount 
of exchange base in all horizons of the non-solonized profile 
is relatively low. Total base exchange capacity analyses show 
the presence of extremely little carbonate, except in the B 3 
and u horizons of the solonized profile. Mo base unsaturation 
in any horizon appears to be present. 

Table A shows some differences in the two profiles as to 
the proportions of water soluble Ma - it appears to be mainly 
a question of the differences in the quantity of bases present 
in the profiles. The percentages of exchange bases show a 
higher Na content in the upper horizons of the solonized pro¬ 
file, which is probably a result of the greater amounts of 
soluble Ma salts present. The percentages of total extracted 
bases show that Ma is consistently a relatively more important 
base in the solonized profile. 

This comparison appears to be a case where the presence 
or absence of a slightly pervious subsoil relatively close 
to the surface has been a contributing factor in the formation 
of a solonized profile. The parent shale of the solonized pro¬ 
file is within 24 inches of the surface, and appears to be 
very high in sodium, whereas in the non-solonized profile 
nothing but loose sand is encountered at 40 inches. In the 
latter case, subsurface drainage has been excellent, result¬ 
ing in the leaching of any original bases present and their 
subsequent deposition elsewhere. The slightly pervious parent 
shales below the solonized profiles prevented adequate drainage 


84 


with the result that the original bases were probably not 
leached away, but possibly have accumulated. This would offer 
one explanation for the high water soluble Na content of the 
solonized soil. 

Table III. 

This analysis is presented to illustrate the base content 
and their proportions in a heavily solonized profile of the 
Sullivan Lake region. The topograph;/ of the area is undulating, 
and the soil is a glacial loam with parent sandstones at ap¬ 
proximately 5 feet from the surface. The profile was charac¬ 
terized by a very strong solonetz development. 

It is noted that the water soluble divalent bases remain 
consistently low throughout the profile, whereas the content 
of w/ater-soluble Na consistently increases with depth, ap¬ 
parently occurring as the sulphate. Wo concentration of 
gypsum is noted. The exchangeable divalent bases do not occur 
in any great amounts, but are decidedly dominant to the exchange 
l\ia, though exchange Na is greater than the water soluble Na 
amounts. Total base exchange capacity analyses indicate that 
apparently considerable base unsaturation occurs in both the 
Ai and Ag horizons. These results also show that carbonates 
are practically absent In the profile, even in the lower hori¬ 
zons where they usually occur in large amounts. 

Table A shows that the percentage of water soluble Na 
constitutes over half the water soluble bases throughout the 
profile except in the horizon, being decidedly dominant 
over the w r ater soluble divalent bases. The percentage of 





85 


exchangeable Na is much lower, but still remains relatively 
large. Total extracted base percentages shows that Na con¬ 
stitutes approximately 20 per cent of the total bases extracted. 
This is a relatively high Na concentration, and probably is a 
considerable factor in the development of the strongly solonized 
profile. Total extracted bases show that both ua and Na in- 

>-i 

crease quite consistently with depth, whereas Ma appears to be 
variable in this regard and occurs in intermediate amounts. 

Significant features in this profile are the unsaturated 
A horizons and the relative absence of Ca in the carbonate 
form. It would seem that the low uauO^ and appreciable Na 
content of this soil would tend to prevent the development 
of a normal profile. 

It was thought that significant differences in either 
soluble or exchange base content or proportions might exist 
between the soils of normal area, and the more normal profiles 
located in solonized areas adjacent to heavily solonized pro¬ 
files. It was necessary to compare profiles selected several 
miles apart, but an effort was made to obtain soils which were 
the same in texture. Two comparisons of this type were made. 

Table IV. Group I. 

The two profiles whose analyses are presented in this 
table, were of necessity selected some miles apart, the topo¬ 
graphy being undulating and the soil type a silt loam in both 
cases. The normal area profile was selected east of Bindloss, 
whereas the second, which was an extremely weakly solonized 
profile in a more heavily solonized area, was selected near 
Bingville.

Studies on Morphological Solonetz Soils of Alberta 


by 

J. M. MacGregor 


Introduction 

A relatively large area in south-eastern Alberta is com 
posed of slightly alkaline soils with a characteristic mor¬ 
phological solonetz profile. The presence of eroded and ir¬ 
regular shallow pit-like depressions, usually several feet 
across, and commonly designated as "blow-outs” or "burn-outs 
are the most noticeable feature of the micro-relief of the 
area. The term "morphological solonetz" has been used to 
designate these soils since the vertical profile exhibits 
characteristic solonetz structure , but apparently lacks the 
typical solonetz chemistry. Solonetzic soil profiles are 
characterized by the development of a relatively impervious, 
strongly columnar horizon, whereas no such pronounced 
structures occur in normal soil profiles. This development 
has been attributed to the presence of relatively large pro¬ 
portions of sodium at one period, though such concentration 
may no longer be present. Solonetz soils are usually found 
in regions where sufficient salts to term the soil "alkali" 


still occur.

"slick-spots" and non-eroded profiles immediately adjacent• 

(3) To determine if appreciable differences in base con¬ 
tent or relative proportion existed between the above soils 
and those located at some distance from the erosion spots on 
the same general level. 

(4) To report any significant differences existing in the 
relative ratio and content of water soluble and exchangeable 
divalent bases to sodium, in soils of the solonized areas and 
of adjacent areas where soils are normal in structure, 

(5) To compare total exchange capacity of these Alberta 
solonetz soils with the total exchange capacity occurring in 
the Alberta black and the grey wooded soil zones as well as 
with other normal soils in different parts of the world, 

(6) To determine the relative proportions and amounts cf 
the divalent bases to sodium in the strongly developed solonized 
profiles, 

(7) To report upon the total base exchange capacity of 
these soils and determine if any base unsaturation existed 
in either normal or solonized profiles. 

(8) To determine if the degree of profile development 
could be correlated with relative amounts and proportions of 
sodium in comparison to the divalent bases, 

(9) To study the relative solubilities of water and nor¬ 
mal ammonium acetate upon lime plaster, calcium carbonate and 
hydrated calcium sulphate, the latter two being common re¬ 
latively soluble substances in the lower soil horizons,

wool strands extending along the sides of the glass past the 
paper pulp which might cause channelling.) Then the ten gram 
soil sample was placed on the paper mat followed by a close 
fitting disc of filter paper to prevent the soil from washing. 
The glass funnel outlet was equipped with a stop-cock which 
was necessary to adjust the rate at which leaching proceeded. 

The end of the shorter tube in the florence flask stopper 
extended just below the top of the glass funnel, the air en¬ 
tering the flask through this tube until immersed by the rise 
of leaching solution in the funnel, which in turn had to leach 
through the soil and lower the level of leaching solution in 
the funnel before air was again admitted to the flask and the 
solution again delivered through the longer tube into the fun¬ 
nel. 

The leaching rate was adjusted at approximately 12-15 
drops per minute, and it required eighteen to twenty-four 
hours to leach with a 750 c.c. volume of solution. 

The soil was first leached with 500 c.c. of GOg-free. 
water to remove soluble salts. The leachate was then evapor¬ 
ated to approximately 50 c.c. on a steam bath, filtered, washed 
with hot water, and made up to volume. Aliquots of this solu¬ 
tion were then analyzed for Ca, Mg ? Na, and sulphates. 

The extraction of replaceable bases was then carried out 
by leaching the same soil sample with 750 c.c. of normal am¬ 
monium acetate adjusted to a pH* of 6.9, immediately follow¬ 
ing the water leaching. This leachate was evaporated to dry¬ 
ness to dehydrate any silica present, then treated with 25 c.c. 
of concentrated nitric acid and again evaporated to dryness to

Experimental Results 

The main results of this investigation are set out in 
Tables I to V. Each table actually consists of two parts, 
e.g. Table I and Table IA. Each table number represents 
a comparison of one aspect of the investigation. However, 
in some cases several comparison studies were made to study 
the same aspect, and in this case they were given the same 
table number, but eacn comparison was given a group number 
e.g. Table II Group I etc. In the first table in each case 
is given the profile , horizon, depth from the surface, water 
soluble and exchangeable ua, Mg, and Na, in M.e. per 100 grams 
of air-dry soil, and water soluble and. acetate extracted sul¬ 
phates in milligrams per 100 grams of soil. In a few cases 
sulphates were not determined. 

The last two columns present the total base exchange 
capacity of each horizon. Total base exchange capacity refers 
to the quantity of cations which the soil is capable of hold¬ 
ing in a form that is replaceable by, and stable in, neutral 
solutions of ua. Mg, fra, K and salts. This was determined 

in two ways, with the exception of a few group comparisons in 
Table II, where the results are not given for the last column. 
In the first of the last two columns the total base exchange 
capacity is found by adding together the three exchange bases 
determined. This is not a true measure of total base exchange 
capacity, since only the three major exchange bases were re¬ 
ported. small amounts of K, Ee, Al, Ti, Mn, etc. would also 
be present in the exchange complex as well as hydrogen. How¬ 
ever the sum of the three major bases determined should ap- 




39 


The possibility existed that the relative proportion or 
content of exchangeable bases might have some bearing upon the 
occurrence of erosion. 

The number of profiles selected in each group varied from 
two to four, and nine group sets of profiles were collected 
and analyzed. Each group represents comparisons of profiles 
which were all taken within a radius of a few hundred feet, 
and yet these profiles exhibited some differences in structural 
development• 

Table II. Group I. 

This group of profile comparisons consists of two pro¬ 
files, one eroded and the other non-eroded, selected from an 
undulating, solonized, fine sandy loam area. The two profiles 
were selected' 28 inches from each other, the main object in 
this case being to determine if any significant differences 
In base content ¥/ere present in the profiles which might in¬ 
dicate the cause of the erosion. Sulphates and total base 
exchange capacity were not determined in these profiles. 

Water soluble fta occurs in both profiles In amounts vary¬ 
ing from 1 m. e. to 4 m. e. approximately. The greater quanti¬ 
ties were found in the (round-top), and the Bg horizons. 
Water soluble ua and Mg compared to fta are low, indicating 
little of these bases as the sulphate. Appreciable amounts 
of exchange fta also occur in both profiles, particularly in 
the Bi horizons. The exchangeable divalent bases occur In 
much greater quantities than are present in the water soluble 
form. In the lowest horizons of both profiles, the amounts 






40 


of these divalent bases are so great, that it appears that 
some soluble base substances have been dissolved in these 
horizons* Since total base exchange capacity was not deter¬ 
mined, it is impossible to state this definitely. 

The A table shows that water soluble Na practically 
equals the sum of the two divalent bases, and this base in¬ 
creases rapidly with depth. The proportion of exchange Na 
to the divalent bases is not so great in either profile and 
constitutes from 5 to 35 per cent of the total. The percent¬ 
ages of total extracted bases show that Na is an important 
base in both profiles, and while not dominant in any horizon, 
the relative effectiveness of Na in soil deflocculation may 
cause it to be a much more significant factor in soionized 
soil profiles than it appears here. 

The conclusions of this comparison are that no signifi¬ 
cant differences in base content which might cause erosion 
were found. As with all heavily soionized soils, Na consti¬ 
tutes an appreciable proportion of the bases, though it is 
not in excess of the two divalent bases in any horizon. 

Table II. group 11. 

This two profile group comparison was taken from an un¬ 
dulating soionized, fine sandy loam area. The profiles were 
selected only a few feet apart, and the eroded profile, though 
grassing over on the eroded surface, still exhibited the strong¬ 
ly soionized morphology, whereas the non-erod.ed profile showed 
less development. This comparison was made for similar reasons 
as in Group I. Sulphates and total base exchange capacity were 
only determined, on the dg horizons of each profile.

The water soluble base analyses indicate that Na content 
is slightly higher in the solonized profile and increases with 
depth, which is not true of the normal area profile. The ex¬ 
change base analyses indicate that the solonized area profile 
is not essentially different in content or proportion of ex¬ 
change bases than from soils of normal areas. Total base ex¬ 
change capacity results show that no unsaturation appears to 
be present, and that the carbonates occur in considerable 
quantities in the lower horizons of both profiles. 

Table A shows that the percentage of water soluble fta is 
distinctly greater in the solonized area profile, but the water 
soluble divalent bases are dominant except in the horizon. 

The percentages of exchange bases indicate that l!a constitutes 
a very small proportion of these bases in both profiles. Per¬ 
centages of total extracted bases illustrate that though ha 
does form a slightly greater proportion of the bases in the 
solonized area profile than in the normal area profile - the 
increase is not significant. 

In general, differences in these two profiles are not 
significant, excepting the concentration of soluble sodium 
in the lower horizons of the solonized area profile, however, 
it must be kept In mind that very weakly solonized profiles 
such as the one compared above, are not characteristic of the 
more heavily solonized areas unless certain favorable conditions 
prevail, such as a topography allowing adequate drainage, or 
a pervious subsoil underlying such soils. On the whole the 
soil profiles of these areas show much stronger solonization

The amount and proportion of sodium (to the divalent bases), 
appears to be related to the degree of solonization. Strongly 
solonized protiles contained relatively greater amounts of ex¬ 
tracted sodium than the more weakly solonized profiles. 

Magnesium, either in exchangeable or totally extracted 
quantities, did not increase consistently with the depth of 
profile or with the degree of solonization. The inconsistency 
in the amounts of this base present, indicates that it probably 
has not been as important as sodium in the genesis of the solon¬ 
ized profile. Calcium was present in relatively much greater 
quantities than magnesium, in practically all horizons, even 
when a correction is allowed for soluble calcium that was often 
present in the lower £ horizons. 

Profiles from normal areas, and apparently normal pro¬ 
files from solonized areas were compared. The only significant 
difference was the higher concentration of water soluble sodium 
in the lower horizons of the solonized area profiles. Exchange 
sodium was not significantly greater. 

The relative ratio of exchange sodium to the divalent 
bases found in Alberta solonetz soils, is low in relation to 
some soil areas reported in California and in Russia. 

Total exchangeable bases in these soils are appreciably 
lower than those reported in the soils of the black soil zone 
in Alberta by Holowaychuk. This is probably due to the lower 
content of organic matter in these soils. The amounts of ex¬ 
changeable bases found agree well with those obtained in similar 
soils occurring in Saskatchewan. Rothamsted and Illinois soils

the soil becomes reduced, and the pH. becomes lower with the 
increase in exchangeable hydrogen. A light colored horizon 
with a platy structure and a light texture develops over a 
dark hard columnar B horizon. With the completion of the de¬ 
velopment, the B horizon loses its columnar structure and it¬ 
self becomes somewhat acid. This process is called solodiza- 
tion." 

" normal soil. After the complete formation of soloth 
with the removal of the mobile colloids, the continued growth 
of the native grasses again changes the soil to the normal 
for that region. This process of calcification impinged on 
the soloth might be termed reconstruction." 

Shaw and Kelley (30) recently have shown that the terms 
"solonetz" and "soionchak" are used in two senses, vix. mor¬ 
phologically and chemically. They point out that consider¬ 
able confusion in the use of the terms now exist due to the 
occurrence of soils wit?a the typical solonetz morphology, but 
lacking solonetz chemistry. 

Mkiforoff (22) states that as well as the typical 
solonetz, there is a great group of soils alkalized to lesser 
degree. The chemical features of these are the presence of 
exchangeable sodium but in relatively small proportions. The 
physical and morphological features are the compactness of 
the solonized section of the profile. They possess all the 
properties of a solonetz but in a smaller degree and such 
soils are much more common than the typical solonetz.

proximate the total exchange capacity unless large quantities 
of hydrogen are present, since the bases which were not deter¬ 
mined usually occur in very small quantities. 

In the last column in the table, the amounts represent¬ 
ing the total base exchange capacity have been obtained by 
resaturating the base exchange complex with calcium after 
having removed the exchange bases by jm. Njti^Ac. This amount 
should represent the true base exchange capacity. 

considerable variation exists in these two columns, 
especially in the lower B horizons. However, where the amount 
given in the last column is decidedly greater than the amount 
in the previous column, the major part of this difference is 
attributed to the presence of hydrogen in the exchange complex 
of the soil and that horizon is then termed " unsaturated” 
with respect to the bases. This occurs in the A horizons of 
only two of the profiles studied and is generally attributed 
to a high hydrogen content in that horizon actually having 
displaced some of the exchange bases originally present. 

Where the amounts in the last column are smaller than in the 
preceding column, this error is attributed to base containing 
substances mentioned previously which are highly soluble in 
N. MH 4 AC. solution. Thus some of the bases determined as ex» 
changeable (principally calcium), have not been present in 
the soil in the exchange form but rather as simple salts or 
crystalline materials. This is a common feature of the lower 
B horizons, where the determination of exchange bases, especially 
calcium, is highly erroneous.

water extraction. This has led to considerable error in the 
exchange bases determined, as can be seen by comparing the 
last two columns of the table (base exchange capacity results) 
with each other. It is seen that wherever the acetate extrac¬ 
tion contained no sulphate, the two columns of total base ex¬ 
change capacity agree very well. Thus much of the exchange 
bases determined throughout the clay profile, and in the low¬ 
est horizon of the sandy loam profile, actually occurred in 
the soil not in the exchange form, but in soluble forms such 
as the sulphate or carbonate, the error thus caused being 
especially great in the lower horizons. To obtain a more 
accurate idea of what the total amount of exchange bases should 
be, one should consult the last column of the table. The dif¬ 
ferences between these amounts and those in the preceding 
column illustrate the magnitude of the error introduced by 
solubility effect in this case. The last column, however, 
shows that the clay profile has several times the exchange 
capacity of the sandy loam and also contains much greater 
amounts of water soluble bases in various forms. This would 
suggest very little percolation of water through the clay pro¬ 
file. Some of the Ga reported as exchange Ga in the Bg hori¬ 
zon of the clay profile must have existed in the soluble sul¬ 
phate form, since sulphate content in this horizon is high 
and Mg and amounts of Na are relatively low. 

The sandy loam profile is not as low in exchange bases as 
might be expected for a soil of this class, however, both 
water soluble and exchangeable base content is low in the upper

in the A-^ horizons to 33.8 m.e. in the Bg. The percentage of 
Wa in the four exchangeable bases determined varied from 2 per 
cent in the to 29 per cent in the Bg horizons of these Cali¬ 
fornia profiles. 

In the Alberta solonised soils studied, replaceable K was 
not determined, but it usually occurs in very low amounts and 
it will not be considered in this discussion. The sum of ex¬ 
changeable bases found in these Alberta soils varied from 5.7 
m.e. in A horizons to 77 m.e. in the B 2 horizons (the latter 
amount is taken from total exchange capacity analyses). The 
amount of water soluble salts also increase with depth, and 
Na salts are often predominant. 

Kelley (17) and Mitchell and Riecken (19) found definite 
increases of replaceable wig with the depth of horizon, where 
it becomes the dominant replaceable base, but did not associate 
its occurrence with the development of the solonized profile. 
They concluded that the greater amounts of Mg present in the 
B horizons was associated with the greater degree of downward 
movement of materials in these profiles. Kelley points out 
however the important point that Mg clays are much more colloi¬ 
dal than Ga clays. Sushko (33) concludes that the amount of 
exchange Mg present is correlated to the degree of solodiza- 
tion in the profile, but does not associate the presence of 
this base with the evolution of the profile. 

No such concentrations or dominance of replaceable Mg 
In the lower profiles of the Alberta solonetzic soils was 
observed in this study, Oa being the dominant base in practi¬ 
cally all cases. This dominance of exchange ca however may 



be due to some extent to errors in the amounts of exchange Ua 
determined, due to the presence of carbonates in most of the 
B horizons studied. 

Murphy and Daniel (20) have reported on the exchangeable 
fta content of the exposed Bj horizons in the solonetzic soils 
of Oklahoma, where it varies in amount from 1.6 m.e. to 11.9 
m.e. This is considerably higher than the amounts of exchange¬ 
able ft a found in the B]_ horizons of Alberta solonetzic soils, 
where it ranged in amounts from 0.4 m.e. in the more normal Bi 
horizons, to 8.7 m.e. in profiles which were heavily solonized. 

Mitchell and Riecken (19) state that slight unsaturation 
of the A horizon is a common occurrence in the solonetzic 
soils of Saskatchewan, -^n the present study with Alberta soils 
unsaturation of the A horizon appeared to be present in only 
two of the profiles studied. According to the Oedroiz theory, 
the a ions of the water percolating through the solonetz for 
a long time would gradually replace Na, thus forming hydrogen 
complexes or base unsaturated soils, however, if the soil con¬ 
tains CaC 03 , the ua ions will gradually displace the fta and 
convert the solonetz into a normal soil. In the profile 
(Table III) where unsaturation was most evident, the amount 
of da 003 present was extremely small, it would seem that in 
most cases in these Alberta soils that the relative abundance 
of GaCOs present, and the low precipitation occurring in these 
areas would tend to prevent unsaturation as a normal feature 
of these soils. 

Total exchange bases determined in the A horizons of the 
solonized area varied from 5.7 to 18.1 m.e. per 100 grams of

A common micro-relief feature of a badly solonized area 
is the presence of erosion spots termed "blow-outs" • J-f the 
surface is impermeable to water with no vegetation present, 
the eroded surface at the top of the h horizon presents a 
white washed appearance and gives rise to the name of "slick" 
spots. Such areas present a serious problem for agricultural 
utilization. 

The Significance of base Exchange in Solonized 

Soil studies 

The study of saline and alkali soils has of necessity 
involved the determination of exchangeable bases in soils, it 
being first necessary to extract the soluble bases from the 
soil, or to determine them on a similar sample and apply a 
correction on the amount of exchangeable bases determined. 

Gedroiz and others have shorn that the physical proper® 
ties of soils are influenced by the exchange complex. When 
sodium is substituted for the divalent bases, the granular 
structure of the clay material is broken down with the even¬ 
tual development of extreme impermeability. If sodium is pre¬ 
sent in sufficient quantities and proportions, hydrolysis to 
sodium carbonate is the result. When calcium is the dominant 
base, the clay particles tend to assume the form of aggregates, 
and the soil is then relatively porous, hissink found that 
when a sample of sodium-saturated heavy clay was shaken with 
water and allowed to stand, it showed practically no sedimen¬ 
tation after seven months. The same clay when saturated with 
calcium settled out quickly. Kelley and Brown (15) state that 
the relative degree of dispersion of a soil when saturated 






15 


Stephenson (32) states that the exchange complex apparent¬ 
ly is identical with the colloidal fraction of soils, and it is 
unnecessary to distinguish between organic and inorganic com¬ 
plexes as the source of the exchange reaction since both are 
colloids and are thus responsible for exchange reactions. 

The iiirror Involved in the Determination of 
Exchangeable bases 

Kelley and Brown (14) point oiit that soils may contain 
bases in at least four forms: 

(1) Exchangeable bases--those held by the exchange complex. 

(2) Water soluble salts, such as chlorides, nitrates and 
sulphates. 

(3) carbonates. 

(4) The crystalline phosphates and silicates. 

The main source of error in the determination of replace¬ 
able bases is the presence of the carbonates in considerable 
quantities in soils, although the crystalline silicates and 
phosphates also present lesser difficulties. The reaction 
which takes place between the leaching electrolyte solution 
and the base exchange material involves an exchange of ions 
which does not hold true in other cases. It is well known 
that calcium carbonate is soluble in solutions of ammonium 
salts, and when calcareous soils are being studied, it is not 
uncommon to find that the calcium equivalent of the dissolved 
carbonate may exceed the replaceable calcium., hissink (9) 
developed a method of eliminating this error by leaching with

that apparently exists between the presence of morphological 
solonetz soils, and the probable causal and stabilizing 
factors of such soils as climate, topography, drainage and 
soil types. 

The extent of the major solonized soils in Alberta can 
be seen from the accompanying map, However, the area out¬ 
lined represents only that portion of the province, where 
due to climatic and other factors these soils have a decided 
tendency to form. It should be emphasized that solonized 
soils are practically limited to level or undulating areas, 
the more rough topography being normally little affected. 

There appears to be the drainage factor involved in their 
formation, as well as climate. However, more weakly developed 
morphological solonetz soils may be seen in many other parts 
of the province than that area outlined. Usually these areas 
occur on comparatively level lands and as scattered localized 
phenomena, they can be observed in the black soils around 
Edmonton. 

Solonisation, then is a common occurrence in the brown 
and dark brown soil zones of the province, and is of more 
rare occurrence in the black soil zone. x n all probability 
this is essentially due to inadequate drainage as well as 
to the lower precipitation and higher evaporation rates in 
the more solonized areas. The brown and dark brown soil 
zones have a lower average annual precipitation than is found 
in the black soil zone to the north and west.

The second table (Table A) of each comparison group pre¬ 
sents the results given in the first table of the comparison, 
but in a different form. This table is divided into four sec¬ 
tions. Tne first section presents the amount of each water 
soluble base as a percentage of the total of tne three bases 
determined. The second section presents in the same manner 
relative percentages of the exchange bases extracted. The 
fourth section gives the sum of each of the total bases ex¬ 
tracted in milligram equivalents per 100 grams of soil, that 
is, the water soluble and exchange calcium were added together 
to.give the total extracted calcium. Total extracted magne¬ 
sium and sodium were obtained in the same way. The third 
section presents the results of the fourth section in a similar 
manner to those presented in the first two sections of the 
table. This often gives a different picture, due to the 
differences in the ease of extraction of the various bases. 

Table I. 

All base exchange investigations lead to the conclusion 
that the exchange complex resides chiefly in the soil colloids, 
hence it is to be expected that a heavy clay soil would have 
a much greater exchange capacity than an extremely sandy soil. 
In the course of this investigation, the exchange properties 
of an apparently solonized heavy clay flat were determined. 
Since like determinations were also carried out on a sandy 
soil, a comparison of the two are present. These two profiles 
were of necessity collected considerable distances from each 
other.

normal profile, in having much lower amounts of soluble salts 
present throughout than are found in the first two profiles. 
These two profiles contain appreciable amounts of soluble ha 
throughout, and the relatively high water soluble ua and Mg 
content of the Bg horizons suggests the presence of consider¬ 
able amounts of the sulphates of (Ja and Mg, as well as ha2S04. 
The presence of this greater concentration of soluble salts 
in the more heavily solonized profiles than are present in 
the third profile can most easily be explained by differences 
in elevation or by the presence of a more impermeable subsoil. 

In the exchangeable base analysis the first two profiles 
again are so near alike In base content that they again can be 
considered as a unit in discussing the results. The higher 
content of exchange ha is evident in both horizons, nere 
again exchange ha in the third profile is much lower, in all 
three profiles, the exchangeable divalent bases are much in 
excess of the exchange ha. 

Total base exchange capacity (see last two columns of the 
table) indicates that only slight differences exist in the 
three profiles. In each case there is evidence of some GaCOg 
in various parts of the profile, but it apparently does not 
occur in any great quantities. Base unsaturation evidently 
does not occur in any of these three profiles. 

Table A. -- shows that the proportion of water soluble ha 
to the water soluble divalent bases present In all three pro¬ 
files to be much the same, and appears to about equal them in 
proportion in some cases. In the percentage of exchangeable 
bases, Na is slightly lower in the more normal profile, though 
the divalent bases are greatly dominant in all three profiles.

with the exception that there appears to be a considerable con 
centration of* uaC03 in the lowest horizon of* the normal area 
profile—which is not true of the solonized profile. Unsatu¬ 
ration is also evident in the latter profile. 

Table A illustrates that the percentage of water soluble 
i^a to the divalent bases is much greater in the solonized area 
profile, whereas it never becomes dominant in the normal pro¬ 
file. The exchangeable and total extracted base percentages 
show much the same relationship. Total extracted bases also 
emphasize the fact that ha occurs in much greater amounts in 
the solonized soils. 

This comparison of two profiles located only a few miles 
apart indicate that IMa appears to have a direct bearing on 
profile structure. The lack of oa<j03 in the solonized hori¬ 
zon is probably a contributing factor to such structure de¬ 
velopment . 


General Discussion 

The results of this investigation show the vertical dis¬ 
tribution of soluble, exchangeable and total extracted bases 
in various soil types occurring in several parts of south¬ 
eastern Alberta. These profiles were selected mainly from 
the brown soil zone although a few were obtained from the 
dark brown soil zone. Total exchange capacity of the various 
horizons was also determined, but such results are not re¬ 
liable in the lower B horizons. 

Kelley and Brown (14) include soils whose replaceable 
ha amounts to almost 14 per cent of the exchangeable bases

present, in the neutral or slightly alkaline soil group. Since 
the greatest percentage of exchange i>ia found in any horizon of 
the soils studied was 21 per cent of the three major exchange 
bases, and is usually much lower, it would appear that the Al¬ 
berta solonetzic soils would in general be included in this 
group, however, it should be remember that these soils do 
contain larger proportions of exchangeable ha to the divalent 
exchange bases than are present in the more normal soils of 
the world, in the three normal area profiles studied exchange 
ha did not exceed 3 per cent; ua and Mg constituting 97 per 
cent of the three major exchange bases present. Kelley and 
Brown (14) report that in neutral or slightly alkaline soils 
of California, Kussia and nolland studied, exchange ha averaged 
3 per cent, 0 per cent and 6 per cent of the four main ex¬ 
change bases present. 

In the present study it was considered advisable to pre¬ 
sent the upper and lower limits of sodium extracted in each 
horizon of all the profiles studied. (The clay flat profile 
of Table I was omitted, since this profile is not representa¬ 
tive of the solonized area and was the only heavy clay soil 
investigated). The extreme limits of sodium content are pre¬ 
sented in milligram equivalents extracted per 100 grams of air- 
dry soil, and also as a percentage of the three major bases 
determined. The profiles included were divided into two main 
divisions; the solonized area profiles and the normal area 
profiles being considered as two distinct groups. Water solu¬ 
ble, exchangeable, and total extracted sodium ranges are pre¬ 
sented, from twenty solonized area profiles, and from four

soil, whereas the normal soil area to the north varied from 
15*0 to 21*2 m.e. This is lower than amounts found by noloway- 
chuk (11) in the black and in the grey wooded Alberta soil 
zones, however, it does agree with those reported by Page and 
Williams (25) found in Rothamsted soils, where soils contained 
12-15 m.e. and in general, are slightly lower than those of 
Illinois soils reported by Bray 13) where total exchange bases 
as high as 33 m.e. occurred. 

Solonized soils in Alberta appear to be the result of 
limited precipitation and a topography which tends to give 
incomplete drainage of relatively large areas. Soil type may 
be considered as a secondary and more localized factor. The 
mean annual precipitation in the more solonized area is ap¬ 
proximately 12 inches, with the high evaporation rate which 
is typical of such semi-arid regions. Solonization, however, 
does occur to a limited extent in the Edmonton region where 
the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches, with a 
much lower evaporation rate. 

The relative absence of solonization on slopes and rolling 
topography In the solonized area has consistently been observed 
The results presented here indicate that the presence of strong 
ly solonized areas can be correlated with the presence of 
slightly larger amounts of sodium, in either the water soluble 
or exchange form. It appears that considerable movement of 
sodium has occurred from the surrounding soils, which now ap¬ 
pear more normal In structure, into the present strongly solon¬ 
ized more level land where it has accumulated, probably due 
to a more impervious subsoil. These conclusions agree with 
those of de f SIgmond (5).
