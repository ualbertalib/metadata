FOREWORD 


The layman may see the system of public education 
as something which has developed spontaneously through¬ 
out the last two or three centuries without visible 
effort or guidance « The fact is, that public education, 
like free speech and universal suffrage, has been 
attained only by intense effort and personal sacrifice 
of many persons, and not without setbacks, losses and 
false turnings along the route • 

The ensuing pages will deal with the genesis of 
public education in a province which now emphasises, 
perhaps more than any other Canadian province, the 
support and encouragement of vocational education . 

This is a comparatively recent feature of New Bruns¬ 
wick schools and is completely at variance with a 
traditionally classical background . Chapter I and II 
contain material intended to give insight into this 
classical background* Chapter III, (which deals with 
finance), will show how schools, and vocational 
schools particularly, are integrated into the county 
system of New Brunswick • Chapter IV contains a 
survey of the history of vocational schools in New 
Brunswick and describes recent phases of the movement . 
Chapter V summarises the conclusions* 


The aim in this thesis is to explain the causes

of a sudden and somewhat belated development of 
vocational education in New Brunswick and to 
describe features of that development . From 
this description it is hoped that Alberta educators 
may be enabled to note valuable similarities and 
contrasts between the public and vocational schools 
of Alberta and New Brunswick .

CHAPTER I 


THE HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL ASPECTS 
OF NEW BRWSWICK EDUCATION 

1. BRITISH INFLUENCE 

The early growth of educational institutions in 
New Brunswick can he understood only in relation to 
the philosophy (if such it can he called) controlling 
similar institutions in England during the latter part 
of the eighteenth century . The distinctive trait of 
the British people who ahhor the disappearance of tradi¬ 
tional systems and prefer to compromise hy patching up 
existing structures, in preference to creation of new 

ones, was as evident in education as in all other 

1 

phases of English life • England, which under George III 
from 1760 to 1811 was destined to see almost unequalled 
cultural achievements, was at the same time character¬ 
ised hy paralysis in many endowed institutions, includ- 
ing education . 

The conditions existing at the time of George III 
were such that corporate interests and privileged 
persons had little to fear from inquiry or interference 
of any kind . It is not surprising that this freedom

from intervention should have produced in the educa¬ 
tional systems of that period a situation inimical to 
efficient instruction • .4 feature of the schools of 

the period was the identification of the Anglican 
clergy with learning and instruction of youth . The 
universities could not he recognised as centres of 
culture and learning; they were little more than 

"comfortable monastic establishments for clerical 

3 

sinecurists with a tinge of lettersThe young men 
passed pleasant years in drinking and social activities 
with some little attention to books. The examination 
system was interesting when contrasted with our mid- 
twentieth century objective requirements. Before 1800 
no examinations were held, and the candidate, presiding 
examiner, and other officials spent the examining 
period in profound silence and entertaining but 
irrelevant reading. 

Another outstanding feature of education in 
Britain in the latter part of the eighteenth century 
was the absence of any attempt by the lower and middle 
classes themselves, or by the ruling aristocracy in 
their behalf, to provide public instruction for under¬ 
privileged groups . This phenomenon is not difficult

to explain. The aristocratic rulers of England, the 

4 

"ten thousand landlords and merchants n who held the 
'balance of power, viewed with disfavor the prospect 
of universal education. It might he said that the 
motive of this ruling class was one of self- 
preservation, since it could see virture in the ex¬ 
isting social order only to the extent to which it 
tended to strengthen and perpetuate its own enviable 
position. 

Educational institutions of that period were a 
part of the system which prepared the flower of 
English youth for leadership and civic responsibility, 
and they did this with no mean success. There seemed 
to be no need to provide instruction for that segment 
of the population which had no practical use for 
cultural enlightenment. A higher standard of education 
in the lower groups might easily result in the dis¬ 
placing of those above in the social order. 

The close identification of the Anglican clergy 
with all media of education had as an outcome the 
Sunday School Movement, inaugurated in 1782 by Robert 
Raikes. Originally taking two days a week, since more 
time was not available because of the stress of industrial

expan3ion, the movement gradually confined itself to 
Sunday instruction. The teaching, which was first a 
combination of religious and secular training, was 
later restricted to religious observances. Even with 
this limitation in scope, there can be no doubt that 
"the movement which has gradually spread to include 
practically all denominations, is today one of the 

5 

great educational assets, both in England and America. " 

While education at the beginning of the nine¬ 
teenth century was, in England, considered solely 
an aristocratic privilege, and while there was 
Inching at that time even a poorly educated yeoman 
class, it would be unfair to judge too harshly the 
standards of instruction and culture existing in the 
upper classes. The emphasis upon Greek and Latin 
classics would not have failed to produce a graceful 
and even tempered philosophy of life based upon the 
ancient concepts of the good life. Further, it can¬ 
not be denied that this period produced a class of 
men famed for brilliant leadership and scholarly 
aptitude. It is possible that the present day 
Englishman may view with something akin to nostalgia 
that period of England's greatness, which shone with 
such figures as William Wordsworth, Dr. Johnson,

2. NEW ENGLAND PATTERN 

The aristocratic tradition of English educat¬ 
ional institutions had little influence upon the 
rough frontier society of New Brunswick in the latter 
part of the eighteenth century . Such a tradition was 
to have little influence until the founding of a more 
permanent and highly organised society typified by 
nineteenth century provincial New Brunswick • 

The early settlement of New Brunswick was 
accomplished by three successive waves of people, 
each bringing their own distinctive political and 
social ideologies . First arrivals upon the scene 
were the French Acadians, occupying originally the 
counties now known as Albert and Westmoreland, 
situated in the Chignecto and Shepody Bay region . 

With the expulsion and subsequent wanderings of the 
ill-fated Acadians, we are not concerned at the 
moment . It will be found, however, that the descend¬ 
ants of these earliest colonists were to form 
minority groups of French-speaking people on their 
return from southern points along the New England 
coast • The earliest Acadians were expelled during 
the summer of 1755, and at this time there were 
English settlements only in the Annapolis Royal

and Halifax regions. n The movement of the Acadians 

was completed by 1763, but we find mention of the 

first New England settlement of New Brunswick in 1761 

6 

in the Albert and Westmoreland counties." This 
earliest movement of New Englanders was motivated 
not by political urgings but by the simple desire 
for personal betterment. A hundred years of Acadian 
occupation had, in many areas, provided a rich 
agricultural heritage for later New England settlement. 

A second wave of New England settlers arrived 
upon the New Brunswick scene during the period from 
1777 to 1788. It is to this group that consideration 
must be given in a study of the early cultural pattern 
of the province. The Loyalists brought with them a 
strong aristocratic tradition, so strong, indeed, 
that they preferred danger and personal loss to a 
renunciation of their early British heritage. It 
would be erroneous, however, to conclude that the 
New Englanders were not affected by their American 
background. Characteristics of individualism, free 
enterprise, and the dawn of universal suffrage and 
education were in the land whence came these early 
Loyalists. Accordingly it is necessary to examine

the progress which had been made in the educational 
institutions of the rebellious colonies. 

The intrepid settlers of the Massachusetts Bay 

region were noted for two contributions to the 

social and educational history of America • They are 

credited with maintaining, for a time, an absolute 

theocracy, almost unique in the history of the New 

Y7orld, To them, also, is attributed the first 

democratic school act, which aimed at universal 

support of education and provided penalties for 

failure to continue such support • The leaders of 

the new colony, Rev, John Cotton, (a former tutor of 

Emmanuel College at Cambridge), Governor Vane and 

his deputy, John Winthrop directed with missionary 

seal the affairs of the people to the end that a 

7 

8elf-perpetuating n Bible Commonwealth" might be 
created, The legislative franchise was granted 
only to those persons who were land owners and 
church members • It is interesting to note that 
these early settlers, abandoning the old world 
because of real or fancied religious intolerance, 
blundered into a form of absolutism as intolerant as 
the system responsible for their emigration . However,

the theocracy was short lived and after two decades 
of existence, was modified in 1691 to a government 
elected by property owners of the state • 


Whether the famous Massachusetts School Ordinance 
of 1647 was, or was not, the first historical instance 
of an attempt at democratic, universal instruction, 
is a moot question • Certain features of this much 
discussed act, and its later amendments, were to 
influence educational developments in the yet unborn 
Loyalist Province of New Brunswick . 

Excerpts from the law follow: 

"It being one of the chief projects of 
that old deluder, Satan, to keep men 
from the knowledge of the scriptures, 
as in former times by keeping them in an 
unknown tongue, so that the true sense 
and meaning of the original might be 
clouded by false glosses of saint seem¬ 
ing deceivers, that learning may not be 
buried in the grave of our fathers in 
the church and commonwealth, the Lord 
assisting our endeavors: 

"It is therefore ordered that every town¬ 
ship in this Jurisdiction after the Lord 
hath increased them to the number of 
fifty householders, shall then forthwith 
appoint one within their town to teach 
all such children as may resort to him 
to read and write, whose wages shall be 
paid either by the parents or masters of 
such children or by the inhabitants in 
general, by way of supply as the major 
part of those that order the prudentials 
of the town shall appoint: 

Provided, those that send their children 
be not oppressed by paying much more than 
they could have them taught for in other 
towns; and

ff It is further ordered. That where any 
town shall increase to the number of 
one hundred families or householders, 
thay shall set up a grammar school, 
the master thereof being to instruct 
youth so far as may be fitted for the 
university: 

provided, that if any town neglect 
the performance hereof above one year, 
that every such town shall pay five 
pounds to the next school until they 
shall perform this order, n 8 

The permissive, as well as the mandatory powers 
embodied in the above act made it a model for many 
later publicly supported school systems . It has 

9 

been called the "Mother of American School Laws, 8 9 
Theoretically providing for all contingencies, the 
law was to be shown lacking in compulsive force • 

Many communities, lacking the missionary seal of the 
original founders, preferred to pay the assessed 
fine as being more economical than providing school 
accommodation and instruction. In 1671, an amendment 
to the Act was passed, raising the fines for failure 
to Keep a grammar school to ten pounds, and for 
neglect to Keep a Latin school, five pounds. That 
the law provided for the essentials of democratic 
education cannot be denied, A survey of the pre¬ 
vailing political structure in this state reveals 
that the ruling power was invested in the Puritan 
clergy • Furthermore, the records of the time show 
that there existed a shortage of properly trained

men to take responsible positions in this group of 
ruling churchmen . One must infer that while the law 
was to appeal to coming generations as an early, 
courageous attempt at democratic, universal instruct¬ 
ion, the Puritan clergy were more concerned with 
perpetuation of their power than with the creation 
of liberal legislation . The fact that the colleges 
of Yale and Harvard arranged their students according 
to the wealth and prestige of their families, suggests 
that the aura of democracy was not real • We may 
conclude, however, that regardless of the manner in 
which later critical historians were to view the 
early school laws enacted by the Calvinist Church, 
a precedent for state control over school systems 
was established, which remains valid today . later 
events were to see a separation of the established 
churches from secular rule, but the legal control 
of education by the state, established by the Pilgrim 
Fathers, was to outlive the necessity which prompted 
the measure . 

"The English settlers in the Massachusetts area, 
and especially in the Boston colony, were as a class, 
highly educated in comparison with any other group

in America at that time . " .Anjongf both, clergy and laity 
were numerous university graduates with records of 
distinguished service in many fields . The urge to 
transmit this enviable standard of learning to 
future generations was strong, and action could 
not be postponed, or learning in the first generation 
would be lost . We find in the early records of New 
England references to determined and ambitious 
schemes bached by leading citizens, to ensure in¬ 
struction in religious and secular training . 

The function of education in the seventeenth 
century, in the colonies no less than in England, 
was the preparation of young men for political and 
clerical leadership . 

The early theocratic structure built up in the 
Massachusetts Bay region, had its counterparts in the 
other colonial states . Rhode Island, alone, maintained 
freedom of thought; there is evidence that many groups 
from nearby areas were persuaded to move into Rhode 
Island to escape unjust religious discrimination . 
Because of the association of school legislation with 
coercive action, this colony was to remain free of 
any school enactment until 1800 • The New Hampshire

school system oame into existence in the year 1719 
with a school ordinance based on the Massachusetts 
Act of 1647. The people of the Connecticut colony 
appear to have been resistant to the idea of 
education, since there are records of the founding 
of schools and their subsequent closing because of 
public apathy. The legislation in Connecticut, 
while following the example of the School Ordinance 
of 1647, seems to have been less thoroughly en¬ 
forced, since we find the Grand Jury visiting once 
each year each family suspected of neglecting the 
instruction of servants and children, and penalizing 
those found guilty of neglect an amount of twenty 
shillings. 

Certain characteristics of these early attempts 
at state control lingered in eighteenth-century 
New Brunswick. As the expanding New England colonies 
found it more difficult to send their children to 
the centrally located grammar and Latin schools, 
district schools were set up in the outlying areas 
especially during the winter months. There appears 
to have been a close connection between these early 
district schools and the parish schools still 
existent in rural New Brunswick. The county grammar 
schools of today in the province employing teachers

of Grammar Sohool License, and located one to a 
county, have undoubtedly descended from early grammar 
schools brought into existence by the School 
Ordinance of 1647 . In some cases the New England 
grammar schools were moved from one section of the 
town to another because of disagreement over the 
permanent location of the school . This device was 
resorted to in 1605, when a New Brunswick legislative 
act permitted the movement of the county grammar 
school from parish to parish, until each parish had 
shared in the benefit of having the grammar school . 

We have seen how the religious background was a 
force in the development of New England society • In 
the harsh American frontier life, aesthetic appreciat¬ 
ions were to become blunted and thwarted • Compromise 
between traditional method and changed geographical 
conditions were inevitable when these conditions made 
necessary such pioneer activities as the rearing of 
log houses, the making of primitive furniture, the 
tilling of land and the dealing with hostile Indians • 

The schools of this period were definitely 
teacher-centred* The pupils were expected to retain 
and return what they were taught, and more was not 
expected • Memory was improved by rhyme and meter, and

the branches of trees and applied vigourously and 
11 

almost daily. 9 The more liberal and advanced theories 
of educational method based on the writings of Locke 
and Comenius had not yet reached these shores • 

The secondary school curriculum narrowed* to an 
almost exclusive study of Latin grammar. Occasionally, 
some secondary schools, where conditions warranted it, 
had departments where preparatory courses in the 
9 three B f s n were given to younger students deficient 
in this respect . Such schools were lacking, however, 
in functional role, and were recognised as supplying 
a mere gloss of culture to a privileged few; consequently 
their following was limited . The classical requirements 
in Greek and Latin were not dictated by local agencies, 
but by such colleges as Harvard and Yale, which re¬ 
quired a full classical background for matriculants • 

The persistence of this tendency is evident in the 
requirement of both French and Latin from candidates 
for grammar school licenses in New Brunswick, at the 
present time • The University of New Brunswick also 
adheres to the classical tradition in requiring two 
languages for entrance to the Faculty of Arts . The 
emphasis upon humanistic elements in education was

strong enough to force any practical consideration, 

such as professional training, into the background. 

It can be noted however, that an early law of 1642 in 

Massachusetts gave sanction to a training in the law 

of the land; *probably in the belief that such know- 

12 

ledge would inbue qualities of citizenship. 9 

University classes were as completely formalized 
as the elementary and secondary schools . The 
curriculum at Harvard, for example, was limited to 
grammar, rhetoric, arithmetic, logic and astronomy. 
The avoidance of any subject which might have useful 
application is shown by the fact that arithmetic and 
geometry were neglected for that reason. 


3. THE LOYALIST TRADITION 

In this section, attention will be given to 

the humble beginnings of New Brunswick as a province, 

and to the social and educational institutions which 

gradually emerged as the Loyalists accepted the 

challenge of the new land . 9 By Heaven, we will be the 

13 

envy of the American States n , wrote Edward Winslow, one

of the early founders of the St. John Colony, in con¬ 
templation of the truly Loyalist Province. 

The fact that the Loyalists had repudiated every¬ 
thing republican was to result in the strengthening of 
everything that stood for the opposite of democracy. 

In the institutions they set up in New Brunswick we 
should expect to see evidence of a reverence for all 
things connected with the British crown, a deep rooted 
class consciousness, a complete aversion to equal 
franchise and a prejudice against innovations in social, 
political, and educational institutions. We should 
expect to find little sympathy for equal educational 
or vocational opportunity. For example, the earliest 
Loyalists of highest military rank requested land 
grants of 5,000 acres each, while, in contrast to this 
generous allotment, the privates were granted fifty 
acres each, which were later raised to one hundred 
acres. 


4. EARLY LOYALIST SCHOOLS 


The earliest schools in New Brunswick could be 
classified into those which were partially supported 
by the state for the training of upper class children, 
and those which were designed to function for the 
middle and lower classes in the province. The grammar 
schools, academy schools and the colleges fall into

the former Glass, while the parish schools, Indian 
schools, and those institutions maintained under the 
sponsorship of the Anglican Churoh fall into the 
latter category . 

The leaders of the provinces were dimly aware 
that some sort of provision for education in the out¬ 
lying areas must he made unless generations of succeed¬ 
ing Loyalists were to he vastly inferior in learning 
to the originals . The Parish School Act of 1302 
provided a suvi of £420 for all the parishes in the 
province or an amount of £10 for each parish . This 
amount was small, hut prohahly fairly generous con¬ 
sidering the limited finances of the province . No 
provision was made for the erection of school buildings, 
and the existing machinery for the licensing of 
teachers was simple in the extreme • Royal instructions 
to the governor stated that teachers might obtain 
licenses by applying to his office . The scarcity of 
teachers made the issuance of licenses a mere formality 
and probably had the effect of admitting many persons 
of unsuitable calibre to the profession . Whatever 
inadequacies there might have been in this Act, it 
must be admitted that it cast a ray of light in the 
darhness, and was responsible for a change in the 
attitude of the province as a whole towards education .

The first grammar school in the province was 
established at St John by the Act of 1805. This statute 
was entitled, "An Act for Encouraging and Extending 
Literature in the Province." Two schools were established 
in each county for the instruction of both sexes in 
English, Writing and Arithmetic. The control of these 
county schools was under the Justice of Peace in each 
district since the funds were supplied to the County 
Justices to be used as they saw fit. £25 was to be 
supplied for each school as requested, but the 
arrangement apparently proved unattractive since, 
with the exception of St. John, no county tooK 
advantage of the offer. 

The first of the 1816 school ordinances established 
a grammar school at St. Andrews under terms similar to 
those which brought into being the St. John Grammar 
School. A second act was termed, "An Act to establish 
grammar schools in the Several Counties of the province", 
and was a significant departure from the 1805 legislation 
in that boards of grammar school trustees appointed by 
the lieutenant-governor were given definite supervisory 
duties. These duties included choosing a suitable 
school site, receiving donations, hiring teachers, 
making by-laws, holding public visitations, and admitting 
free scholars. The grant was raised from £25 to £100. 

This amount however, was to be paid only on receipt of

assurance that the inhabitants had contributed an 
equal amount. The purpose of these early grammar 
schools was clearly to provide secondary school 
education; but many of them seem to have fallen short 
of their requirements and degenerated into superior 
type parish schools. 

It has been shown that the assessment principle 
originated in the New England School Ordinance of 
1647. The third act passed by the New Brunswick 
Council in 1816 was the germ of the free school system 
in the Loyalist province. Parish sohool trustees 
appointed by the general sessions were given the power 
to assess the inhabitants for a sum not less than £30 
and not more than £90 a year for the maintenance of 
parish schools. The motives behind this early 
legislation are difficult to discern since it was 
inconsistent with the purported anti-democratic stand 
of the council. That the parishes were not ready 
for such advanced legislation is shown by the fact 
that not one parish availed itself of the privilege 
and in consequence the act was removed from the statute 
books in 1818. The compulsory assessment principle 
was to remain discarded for more than fifty years. 

The parish schools were doomed to limp along on £10 
per year for each parish, as originally provided for 
in 1802.

The Madra8 Schools in the period immediately 

following 1320 were a direct outcome of the interest 

of the Anglican Church in the training of the young. 

These schools were supported by direct contributions 

received from the Anglican National Society and the 

Society for the propagation of the G-ospel, and were 

intended to provide instruction in all but the more 

remote centers for those children whose parents were 

incapable of paying for other instruction. Although 

the teachers in such schools were Anglican trained 

and administered the catechism as an integral part 

of the daily instruction, the tremendous reputation 

for discipline and efficiency built up by such schools 

encouraged parents of other denominations to send 

their children. As the schools were attended by 

children of all Christian denominations, the answers 

to the question, "my god-fathers and my god-mothers 

in my baptism", etc., must have been curiously 
18 

incongruous. The monitorial system, probably modeled 
after similar English institutions of that period, 
was simple and inexpensive. From the students, 
brighter boys were selected in the proportion of 
about one to ten of the rank and file. Over these 
monitors an usher was appointed with duties analogous

to those of a sergeant-major in the army, plus the 
responsibility of liaison between the separate Monitors 
and the Anglican instructor in the school . The record 
for impartiality, fairness and prompt treatment of 
misdemeanors has probably not been surpassed by any 
other school system . 

The day opened with the Lord's Prayer and the 
church catechism, which was carried on by the 
question and answer method among the students . Bead¬ 
ing, Spelling and Writing followed until the noonday 
period . The afternoon was devoted to n Ciphering . * 
Recitations were always given standing and students 
were required to maintain positions relative to chalk 
lines drawn on the floor by the Monitors . The dis¬ 
cipline was of such an order that the Master was able 
to leave the room for periods of one-half hour with¬ 
out interrupting the routine • Saluting the Master in 
best military style at the end of the day was common . 

A system of extrinsic rewards and rigid fines and 
punishments was adhered to . The purpose of these 
schools was to prepare those pupils who so desired it 
for grammar school entrance, and to bring instruction 
to the children of indigent groups; in this latter aim 
they succeeded because of their great economy of 
operation .

There is no doubt that the Madras Schools were 
superior to anything hitherto employed in the province 
and their presence helped to create a more favorable 
attitude towards education, especially in the rural 
areas • The social mingling of the children of middle 
and pauper classes probably had a favorable influence 
in dissolving class barriers and in the democratising 
of education in the province . In these schools is 
discernible the familiar Loyalist pattern . The Church 
of England sponsorship of a matter relating to the 
common good, and the aura of philanthropy and religion 
surrounding the education of the lower classes, are 
features which proclaim the New Brunswick school 
system as being unmistakably Loyalist in tradition 
as well as in practice *

CHAPTER II 


EVENTS LEADING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT 
OF A FREE SCHOOL SYSTEM 

1. COLONIAL SOCIETY IN TRANSITION 1829 - 1871 

The period from 1829 to 1871 was to show les3 con¬ 
sistency as to social and political pattern than the 
first fifty years of the existence of New Brunswick . 

In the year 1829, the educational and political 
framework of the province lacked many things which 
we today consider to be fundamental . The assessment 
principle had not yet been applied as an expedient for 
the support of education; there was as yet no central 
training institution for teachers, and, most important 
of all, responsible government was still lacking in 
the Loyalist colony • Legislation during this period 
to improve the educational system was for the most 
part indecisive . The methods employed were those of 
compromise, of patching up existing structures, rather 
than the introduction of radical change • 

A committee of the Assembly in 1829 reported that 
both the grammar and Madras schools were failures . 
Legislation was introduced, which, although failing to 
make any improvement in the general situation, contained 
the very significant provision which prohibited a 
clergyman of any denomination from assuming duty as 
master or usher of a grammar school .

The New Brunswick Ordinance of 1829 was the first 
in a series of steps in all departments of public life 
designed to remove the established privileges of the 
Anglican Church. The act further increased the 
financial support of the grammar and Madras schools, 
and provided for the local appointment of three trustees 
in each parish for the supervision of the schools. 
Parishes were to be subdivided into districts, and 
schools in each district which were operated to the 
satisfaction of the trustees were to receive £20 per 
year. A maximum grant of £160 yearly per parish was 
allowed, and in each county the maximum average per 
parish was to be £120. A significant feature of the 
Act provided that female teachers were to receive not 
more than one half of the grant issued to males, and 
local contributions to a female teacher were to be 
not more than one half the amount collected for a 
master. 

In 1837, the discriminatory clause regulating 
the size of grants to female teachers was removed, 
although the Act still limited payment of the grant 
to not more than three teachers per parish. This 
year was also to see the first step towards central¬ 
isation. County boards of three, appointed by the

Lieutenant-Governor, were set up for the purpose of 
examinations and the supervision of teacher permits • 

Not only were these county boards to investigate 
the character and learning of the prospective teacher, 
but they were also required to examine into the 
loyalty of all teachers • 

Legislation regarding the establishment of a 
Teachers f Training School appeared in the Act of 
1847, which gave authority for a Training and Model 
School, and a newly constituted Board of Education • 

The latter, however, was to consist only of the 
Lieutenant’-Governor and the Executive Council, with 
a Secretary employed at £100 per year . Students- 
in-training, after demonstrating their efficiency, 
were to receive an allowance of ten shillings per 
week for the ten weeks of their course* 

The policy of providing grants to fledgling 
teachers has remained an integral part of the teacher 
training program of New Brunswick until the present 
day • After three weeks training, the assistant teacher 
is apprenticed under the charge of a licensed teacher . 

Ee is expected to draw off small groups to an outer 
room, where he continues exercises, drills and projects* 
The pay of the assistant teacher enables him to con¬ 
tinue at the Training School after a term in actual

practice. One is impressed with the basic soundness 
of this system, since, in most of the Canadian 
provinces, the high school graduate is thrown blindly 
into his first year at Normal, without having a 
practical background or ”apperceptive mass” to which 
the abstract, and to him, often meaningless theories 
presented, may be related. 

Returning to the Act of 1847, it can be seen that 
the compulsory features of the Act were embodied in 
the power of the board to require as many teachers to 
attend the Training School as was deemed necessary, 
and to withhold licenses from those who had not 
attended. This last clause was later rescinded to 
permit teachers of lowest grade to teach without 
training experience. Legislative grants to teachers 
were set at £30, £22, and £18 per year respectively, 
to the three grades of license, as compared with the 
grant of £20 per year to all teachers previous to this 
Act. 


The Bill of 1852, dealing with parish schools, 
filled a long felt want by providing for a Superintend¬ 
ent of Education and County Inspectors, appointments 
being made by the Governor-in-Counoil. The inspectors 
were to be paid at the rate of seven shillings and 
sixpence for each inspection, with a guarantee of a 
minimum salary of fifty pounds per year. The assess -

ment principle was again pushing to the fore, since 
the Act also gave permission to the Parishes to assess 
themselves in support of schools and also offered a 
bonus of 25% of the government allowance to those 
that availed themselves of the compulsory taxation 
clause . 

No further school legislation was passed until 
1858 • The School Act of 1858 established four in¬ 
spectorates in the province, with an Inspector for 
each division, paid at the rate of £250 per year, an 
exceedingly generous salary in comparison with the 
teacher incomes of that period • 

We have seen how the responsibility for the 
parish schools devolved upon the trustees in each 
parish • A further School Ordinance of 1858 authorised 
the formation of school committees in the small 
district subdivisions within each parish . These school 
committees were to have immediate charge over build¬ 
ings, libraries and equipment, and authority to call 
meetings of the local inhabitants • The parish trustees 
retained their former supervision over the teachers . 

Aleo in 1858, the province r s first Superior schools 
were established . Such schools were limited one to 
a parish, and received higher grants, the increased 
scale of grants being contingent on the hiring of

first class teachers • These new schools eventually 
developed an educational standard midway between the 
grammar and the parish schools . 

2. TEE SCHOOL ACT OF 1871 

In 1871 the New Brunswick legislature passed a 
bill which included a clause dealing with the non¬ 
sectarian character of New Brunswick schools . It 
also provided for free, tax supported schools, which 
were to derive their finances from three sources: 
first, the provincial treasury; second, the county 
school fund; and third, the tax collections from i 
district residents . We shall see this framework 
existing, with minor modifications, in a later study 
of the contemporary financial system of New Brunswick . 
Inspectors were given duties related to the choosing of 
certain f, poor districts#, which were to receive special 
concessions from the treasury for their support . The 
inspectors were further empowered to appoint trustees 
for those districts failing to choose their own . 

Other routine but important points under the Act 
were the precise regulations relating to the election 
of trustees, and the duties of trustees and teachers . 
The law forbade the display, by any student or teacher, 
of any emblem of a society or religious denomination .

Many other definite regulations were laid down, some 
of which have remained unchanged until the present 
time . The length of time required for training at 
the Normal School was set at five months • A be¬ 
ginning of the modern consolidatedschool is seen 
in the setting aside of the cities of Fredericton 
and St, John as individual school districts . A 
seven-member school board was appointed in each of 
these districts, three members being appointed by 
the Governor-in-Council, and the remainder by the 
city council . This organisation is identical with 
that of the rural consolidated school district at 
the present time . 

The Act of 1871 reinforced the trend towards 
decentralisation • The School Act of 1816 had pro¬ 
vided for parish trustees in a supervisory role 
over the schools of the parish . This measure 
remained in force with few modifications until 1858, 
when School Committees were set up for each district, 
providing a limited control over the district schools . 
The Act of 1871 abandoned the idea of parish control 
and formed District School Boards with complete 
localisation of function • The legislators apparently 
hoped that in giving control of each school to local 
district boards, a fostering of local pride might 
result which had been lacking in the parish unit .

In later years there has been more centralisation, 
as shown by the establishment of County Finance 
Boards and consolidated School Districts • The im¬ 
provement in means of transportation, the demand for 
increased facilities in all phases of education have 
again rendered obsolete the decentralised school 
unit of n little red school house 9 fa,me . 


3. RESOLUTION OF THE SECTARIAN CONFLICT 


In considering the controversy which arose 
after the passing of the Assessment Act of 1871, it 
is necessary to examine those clauses of the British 
North America Act evidently formulated with an 
awareness of the complexity of the sectarian problems 
in education, over Canada as a whole . 

Section 93 of the British North American Act 
reads, in part, as follows ; 

9 In and for each Province the Legislature may 
exclusively maKe laws in relation to Education, 
subject and according to the following provisions: 

(1) 9 Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially 
affect any Right or privilege with respect to Denominat¬ 
ional Schools which any class of persons have by law 
in the Province at the time of Union . " 

Two points will be considered in arriving at a 
clear interpretation of this sub-section. The word.

n exclusively*, unquestionably means exclusive of the 
Federal Parliament, The power of the Dominion 
Government is strictly limited to that of taking 
action in support of a religious minority, which, 
by reason of the enactment of a provincial ordinance, 
is proved to have lost rights held prior to Confederat¬ 
ion, It must be noted that the "Right or privilege" 
here refers only to that relating to denominational 
matters, Such questions as finance and sanitation, 
for example, could not legally be considered as of 
a sectarian character. 

The term, *Denominational School", needs 

separate consideration, A subsequent decision of 

the Judicial Committee of the privy Council was to 

define the "Denominational Schools" as those which 

were *permanently and by law denominational*, and 

not schools that happened to be denominational in 

their operation for the time owing to the fact that 

the original intent of Section 93 of the British 

North America Act had not been explicity enforced. 

The mere accident of denominational teaching in a 

school, permitted on sufferance over a period of 

years, was not, in the language of their lordships, 

"a thing to which it is possible to give the color of 
11 

a legal right, *

While the *Educational Bill of Rights v under the 
British North America Act is considerably broader in 
extent than the clause interpreted above, we shall 
see the sectarian differences in New Brunswick 
centered principally around the meaning and intent 
of this particular section . The forthcoming battle 
was to extend over a period from 1871 to 1875, 
during which time it was to become a matter of 
bitter issue in both the Provincial and Dominion 
houses of Parliament . 

It is seen that the Catholics were not reconciled 
to a school system which would force them to pay taxes 
for schools to which they were forbidden by their 
clergy to send their children . In the fall of 1875 
the New Brunswick Executive Council gave answer to 
certain propositions of the Catholic members of the 
Provincial Legislature • The school trustees in each 
parish were empowered to allow children from any part 
of the parish to attend any school within the parish, 
provided that grading regulations were observed . 

This granted the first Catholic request, that Catholic 
children might be grouped in the same school . A 
second concession allowed the certificates of any 
Roman Catholic teaching order to be accepted at the 
Normal School, but not in lieu of an examination for

teaching l i cense . The third proposition of the Catholic 
member, that school boohs should contain nothing inimical 
to the Catholic order, was replied to by the statement 
that the school books were selected so that nothing 
therein should be objectionable to any religious order • 
The fourth proposition concerned religious instruction 
after school hours, and asked that the regular school 
time shouldl be shortened to the extend allowed for 
religious instruction • In answer to this, the 
Executive Council advised the Catholic group that the 
Schools Act gave permission to trustees to rent for 
school use buildings belonging to religious orders or 
the Catholic Church, and advised that no restriction 
would be placed upon the use of such buildings after 
the close of school hours • Later modificiations 
specified that such religious instruction was not to 
be given during the noon or recess period, and that 
the prayer at the beginning of the day was to be the 
Lord f s Prayer . 

Thus, we see that the Catholic minority problem 
in New Brunswick was finally solved by legalizing 
within the framework of non-sectarian schools of the 
province schools to be operated on a limited 
sectarian basis . Such a solution fell short of the 
Catholic demands, but was accepted as being the best 




obtainable. Subsequent difficulties over the object¬ 
ion of the Catholic sisters to sitting for examination 
with other candidates was solved by granting special 
examination periods for the Catholic candidates. It 
was emphasized, however, that all candidates would 
write the same papers . 

Today, in New Brunswick Catholic children attend 
district schools supported by Catholic and non-Catholic 
tax-payers. While these schools are not Separate 
Schools in the true sense of the word, they do provide 
Catholic children with limited religious school time 
instruction as provided for by the School Act. Further, 
Catholic children may receive instruction from members 
of the clergy after school hours in buildings rented 
from the Catholic church, presumably such rent to be 
paid for assessment on members of the school district ♦ 


4c TEE NEW BRUNSWICK DUAL LANGUAGE SITUATION 

In the early life of the »Loyalist Province 9 
the Acadians took little part in the official 
affairs of the oolony. Before 1871, the date of the 
inauguration of the Free School System, the Acadian 
schools received little attention from the educational 
authorities. The larger French schools were parochial

institutions, which occasionally qualified for 
legislative aid prior to 1871 . Some of the Acadian 
schools attempted cursory instruction in English in 
some of the more advanced districts, hut the French 
language predominated in most . 

The Act of 1871 said nothing about the use of 
French in the schools, but since the provincial 
system already included Acadian schools, it seems to 
have been taKen for granted that the French language 
might be continued in those districts where the 
majority of the persons spoKe French . Indeed, the 
French schools in New Brunswick up to the present 
time, appear to have been not separate language 
schools, but bilingual schools with French vernacular, 
the primary pupils being instructed in French and 
English until a point was reached where they could 
continue their education in English * 

The establishment of a French department at 
the Normal School in 1884 was the first practical 
means of coping with the training of bilingual 
teachers • The Principal of the Normal School arranged 
to give instruction to French language students . 

For these students to receive certification in advance 
of Glass III, it was necessary to receive further

academic and professional instruction in the regular 
English department of the Normal School . A further 
regulation, passed in 1897, provided that licensees 
of Glass III qualified after attendance at the 
French department of the Normal School, if they had 
not subsequently passed through the English Depart¬ 
ment, should be employed only in French districts . 
Moreover, no such teacher was to be employed in any 
district, Acadian or otherwise, if the Superintendent 
notified the trustees to that effect * 

Studies on the bilingual schools of New Bruns¬ 
wick covering the period from 1897 until the present 
time are meagre, but there appears to have been 
little change in regulations for the certification 
of the teachers employed in the French districts 
until 1945 . An amendment, passed in that year as 
an addition to Regulation 32, made it possible for 
such teachers to obtain a *Special Certificate * tf 
Candidates are required to write, in addition to 
the regular entrance examination papers, papers in 
French Grammar, Composition and Literature, such 
papers to be written in French . The Normal School 
program for these candidates is designed to prepare 
them for the teaching of French and English to 
French speaking children • The pass requirements 
are the same as for Class III candidates, with the

Literature . 

It is understood of course, that certificates of 
Superior and Grammar grade are issued to French candi¬ 
dates on the same basis as to the English, all papers 
being written in the latter language . Thus we see 
that New Brunswick, while being recognised as a 
bilingual province, makes no provision for its higher 
professional teacher candidates to be examined in 
other than the English language •

CHAPTER III 


FINANCIAL MAINTENANCE AND FINANCE UNITS IN NEW BRUNSWICK 

The government of New Brunswick at this time re¬ 
cognises three modes of support of the public schools 
of the province. These are briefly, the provincial 
treasury grants, the county school fund and direct 
district assessment. Of these three, the matter of 
provincial aid will be considered first. 

1 . PROVINCIAL AID 

Fixed Teacher Grants 

Direct grants to teachers are paid twice 
yearly and vary with the class of license and length 
of service of the teacher. For example, a teacher 
of the first class receives $155 per annum during 
the first two years of service. The amount is 
increased to $150 after two years of service and up 
to seven. After 3even years of service the amount 
remains at $170. Assistant teachers are paid one 
half of the above amounts, provided they instruct 
at least four hours each day, and have a Glass room 
separate from the main school room. 

In addition to the above, there are grants paid 
to holders of grammar school licenses to a minimum

of $400 and slightly lower amounts to the holders of 
Superior Class 1 licenses. At the first glance, it 
is difficult to see the advantages of such a system 
of direct teacher grants, hut in actural practice, 
since these funds are free from local variations of 
policy of school hoards, they provide a powerful 
instrument in the hands of the Board of Education 
for a uniform policy of teacher certification. They 
also provide incentive for the teacher to raise his 
license to a higher grade hy self-improvement. 

Fixed District Grants (unattached districts) 
School hoards also receive grants from the 
provincial treasury for each teacher employed. The 
amount received is inversely proportional to the 
district r s assessed valuation. A district with an 
assessment of # 20,000 or less is entitled to $120 
per teacher employed. For a district of assessment 
amounting to $50,000 hut not over $200,000, the 
amount paid is only $40 per teacher • The matter of 
provincial aid does not end with individual hoards. 
In an effort to encourage the formation of the large 
county unit, the treasury is authorised to pay a 
certain fraction of the expenses of these units, as 


we shall see latter ,

Grants to County Finance Boards Organised Under the 

County Schools Finance Act. 

The trend to larger unite and simplified fin¬ 
ancing took place in New Brunswick with the passing 
of the County Schools Finance Act in 1944. This act 
was to bring into existence the county finance board. 
Before we examine the aid which the Provincial Govern¬ 
ment gives to these boards it would be well to examine 
their organization. 

The machinery required in the operation of the 
larger unit of SGhool administration in New Brunswick 
is simple in the extreme. The existing municipal 
structure is utilized to the fullest extent. County 
finance boards are set up in all counties in which 
the majority of the local boards are in favor of such 
a move. The board consists of seven members, three 
appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council and 
four by the county council . The County Superintendent 
of Schools is present at all the board meetings and 
acts in an advisory capacity to the board. There is 
a full time secretary-treasurer appointed and paid 
by the board. The liaison between the local boards 
and the finance board is simple. Once during each 
year, the district school boards draw up a budget, 
which is presented to the finance board. The duty 
of the finance board is to draw up the county school

budget, which, as the name implies, is to contain 
all the details of the financial requirements of the 
rural schools in the county . Here is where the matter 
of provincial aid again appears . 

From the county school budget is deducted an 
amount computed by adding: 

(a) The amount of the County School Fund (see 
part two of this Chapter.) 

(b) The amount of the school budgets of the towns 
and cities within the county • 

(o) The amount received from the treasury for the 
education of the blind and deaf . 

(d) The amount of the expense involved in the 
transportation of the children in the county • 

(e) The amount of the fixed district grant men¬ 
tioned above • 

The amount left after deducting the five items 
above, is now the actual net expenses of the rural 
districts within the county . The p r ovince will pay 
10% of this net deficit. We see that such a provis¬ 
ion has a double barreled effect . Not only are the 
rural school districts encouraged to consolidate 
into larger districts, with a consequent economy of 
administration, but there is a saving of 10% of the 
cost to the rural districts so consolidated . The aid

to the county finance board does not end at this 
point. A further sum, equal to the 10% grant, is 
paid to each board by the provincial treasury. This 
is called the Equalisation Fund and is created for 
the express purpose of raising the standards of the 
rural schools. It is to be used for the purchase of 
items of school equipment which would ordinarily be 
acquired with difficulty, if at all, by the rural 
schools. These include audio-visual aids equipment, 
school radios, boohs for the school library and 
mimeograph machines. 

Grants to Consolidated School District s 

The existence or non-existence of the County 
Finance Unit does not preclude the formation of 
consolidated SGhool districts. The Keen interest of 
the Provincial Board of Education in vocational 
training is shown in the liberal system of financial 
aids which are offered to these units upon consolida¬ 
tion. These generous provisions are given only to 
those units that are prepared to give manual training 
and domestic science, in keeping with the needs of the 
community. When such conditions have been met, the 
provincial government will grant $1000 per year to 
schools with enrolment under 100, in the grades above 
seven. When the enrolment is above 100 the grant may

be raised to $2,000 . The consolidated school districts, 
whether urban or rural, meeting with the requirements 
of their communities, are also aided by the province 
to the extent of one-half of the cost of maintaining 
the vocational departments . Teachers employed full 
time in vocational work in the school are given grants 
of $50 for rural areas and $200 for urban areas . 
Three-quarters of the salaries of such teachers are 
paid by the province . 

The foregoing provision seems generous and no 
doubt makes possible the continuance of vocational 
education where such instruction is beyond the 
financial means of many districts . However, an un¬ 
foreseen difficulty may arise where there are vocat¬ 
ional and academic teachers employed in the same 
school . It is quite possible to have academically 
qualified teachers with excellent qualifications and 
experience who may earn but a fraction of the salaries 
paid to their vocational co-workers, the highter 
vocational salary scale being made possible by the 
aforementioned government support . Such a situation 
can, and does, in some cases, prevent full co-operat¬ 
ion between academic and vocational staffs • 

Grants to Superior Schools

instruction up to college entrance level . This type 
of school is established in every community of 4,000 
inhabitants or major fraction thereof • Where pupils 
are admitted to the Superior School from outside the 
district in which the school is located, the province 
will pay the school district the sum of $10 per 
pupil so admitted • 

Provincial Aid to Capital Expenditures 

We have seen how the provincial government is 

prepared to give aid towards the maintenance of the 

rural composite high schools . Capital expenditures 

for schools of this type may be borne by the 

treasury to the extent of 60% of the first $100,000; 

50% of the second $100,000; 40% of the third $100,000 

and 30% of any additional expenditures . Wh,ere the 

expense is in connection with alterations, purchase 

of new equipment, or addition to the existing school 

1 

plant, the aid is 40% of such expense • The Provincial 
Government will also guarantee debentures covering 
the portion of indebtedness which the district has 
assumed . 

Provincial Aid in School Transportation 

The province maintains a blanket provision 
whereby 50% of the cost of all school transportation

in the province is borne by the Provincial Government • 
The purchase of new school buses for consolidated 
schools is also supported in the same manner • 

Provincial Aid to School Libraries 

School libraries are encouraged in two ways: 
directly by the equalisation fund, and indirectly 
by a provision in the school act which states that 
the provincial treasury will matach dollar for 
dollar any amount up to $20 which a rural board may 
raise in one year, towards a school library • 

2. THE COUNTY SCHOOL FUND 

The second source of revenue supporting the 
Public schools is the County School Fund . This fund 
is collected by the County Secretary of each county 
from the several parishes in the county . The amount 
is arrived at by calculating a sum of money equal to 
sixty cents per person in the Gounty as determined 
by the last census • The assessment for each parish 
is based proportionately on the amount paid in for 
other county rates . 

The County School Fund is used as a pool out 
of which payments to school boards are made on the 
basis of $60 for each qualified teacher employed in

the parishes exclusive of assistants • Out of this 
fund also are made payments towards the support of 
the schools for the blind and the deaf, as well as 
aid to indigent districts requiring special help • 

The county secretary is also authorised to provide 
grants to the superior schools in the county of an 
amount equal to the provincial grant to such schools . 
The sum remaining after the above payments have been 
made is distributed among the parishes in proportion 
to their enrolment of school children . 

In evaluating the system of county assessment, 
one is at a loss to determine the logic of a system 
which collects from a parish at one time, and pays 
bach an approximately equal sum at a later date . The 
value of such a system was perhaps greatest during 
the era of the unattached school district or parish . 
Those parishes not maintaining sufficient school 
accommodation would thus be penalised, while the 
more progressive parishes would benefit • In the 
province of New,Brunswick where the larger school 
units have almost entirely superseded the smaller 
districts this means of collecting revenue for the 
schools seems to be archaic .

3. DISTRICT ASSESSMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 

The sum of money required for the payment of 
teachers r salaries, improvement of school grounds, repair, 
maintenance and erection of school houses, purchase of 
fuel, light and supplies, over and above the amounts 
provided by the county and the province, are raised 
by direct assessment on the residents of the parishes. 

Such assessment is on whatever real property is rated 
for parish purposes . Real estate which lies within 
the parish may be assessed whether the owner resides 
within the parish or not . 

In addition to the tax on property. New Brunswick 
recognises a poll tax which may be levied on all male 
residents of the parish between the ages of twenty-one 
and sixty . The poll tax is ordinarily $1 per year, 
but may be increased to $3 per year at the discretion 
of the local board of trustees • 

4. MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS 

Aid to *Poor Districts ^ 

By reason of the scattered rural population of 
New Brunswick, it has been found necessary to provide 
special aid to certain areas where adequate financial 
support is lacking to maintain proper facilities .

Recognition of the fact appeared first in 1871, when 
the School Act of that year gave the inspectors the 
power to single out those districts requiring aid, 
and to report such to the Chief Superintendent. 

This arrangement is continued at the present time, 
with the inspectors reporting once each year on any 
indigent districts. 

The criterion of special aid to n poor Districts 1f 
comes under a rigid framework of assessment values, 
and is briefly thus: 

(1) Districts under an assessed valuation 
of $5,000 are to receive $120 per year 
per district. 

(2) Districts assessed between $5,000 and 

$10,000 receive $80 per year per district * 

(5) Districts assessed between $10,000 and 

$15,000 receive $40 per year per district. 

These sums of money are paid out of the Provincial 
Treasury and the County Fund on a 50 - 50 basis. 

In addition, the county ireusurer is authorised 
to raise the grants payable to district boards in 
respect to teachers employed by such boards, and also 
the net amount remaining from the County School Fund, 
apportioned among the districts according to student

enrolment, in the proportions as shown below: 

(1) For districts assessed under $5,000, the 
sums mentioned above are doubled. 

(2) For districts assessed between $5,000 and 
$10,000 the sums mentioned above are 
raised\ by 50%. 

(3) For districts assessed between $10,000 
and $15,000 the above amounts are raised 
by 25%. 

Figures for the New Brunswick aid to w Poor 

Districts* in 1948-49 show a total of $16,769 paid 
2 

out. The total cost of education in the province for 

3 

the same period was $7,822,125. It is thus seen that 
aid to”Poor Districts n represents slightly over 1/5 of 
1% of the total expenditure on education, which is not 
a significant amount. 

The Teachers Pension Scheme 

In the survey of the educational facilities of 
New Brunswick one is compelled to note that pecuniary 
considerations have been the dominant motivating force 
behind many past and present developments. This state¬ 
ment is not introduced in the spirit of censure, since 
comparative statistics would probably show the small per

o apita income of this province to be the chief reason 
for its proportionately meagre educational expenditure 
as compared with other Canadian provines . The teacher 
pension scale of New Brunswick is, on the contrary, an 
exceedingly generous attempt to provide a measure of 
security, after retirement, to a professional group 
traditionally underpaid during its productive years • 

The retiring period comes at the end of 35 years 
service or at the age of 60 for males and 55 for 
females . These figures are reduced by 10 years in 
the case of veterans with overseas service . The 
pension to which the retiring teacher or school 
official is entitled is equal to three-fifths of 
the average annual salary earned during the last 5 
years of service . The minima and maxima in all cases 
are $360 and $1,200 respectively 0 

payments by teachers into the fund are in 
accordance with the following schedule ; 

(a) Where the annual salary of the teacher 
or school official is $1,600 or less, 

2*3% of the annual salary earned; 

(b) Ifhere the annual salary exceeds $1,600, 
during the first twenty years of service, 

4% of the annual salary earned and after 
such twenty years service 5% thereof.

CHAPTER IV 


DEVELOPMENT OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN 
NEW BRUNSWICK 


1. HISTORICAL ASPECT OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN 
NEW BRUNSWICK 

The introduction of vocational education in New 
Brunswick is of comparatively recent date • This type 
of instruction requires specialised and expensive 
equipment, and specially trained personnel, and it is for 
these reasons that the building of vocational schools 
was slow until the enactment of the Dominion Education 
Act in 1919 provided funds which gave increased impetus 
to the vocational program • Factors responsible for the 
slowness of the province to gather enthusiasm for the 
new movement are: 

(1) the low revenues of the province in modern times; 

(2) the ingrained dependence upon traditional classical 
instruction, dominated by college entrance requirements, 
(S) the scattered and largely rural districts which 
required consolidation before central vocational schools 
could be established . 

The first record of Manual Training and Domestic 
Science courses offering practical training in Canadian 
students, was in Kingston in 1904* The instruction was 
given to Grades V, VI, VII, and VIII, and there was no

attempt to give the teaching a vooational basis* 

It was not until 1917 that any progress was made 

in introducing vocational training into the secondary 

schools of New Brunswick* The late Dr* Fletcher 
2 

Peacock, who at the time was the instructor in Manual 
Training at the Provincial Normal School, was in¬ 
trigued by the possibilities offered by the report 
of the Royal Commission on Industrial Training and 
Technical Education, which in 1913 recommended Federal 
aid for the establishment of Vocational Education in 
the Dominion* Through Dr* peacock 1 s efforts, the 
matter was brought to the attention of the Provincial 
Legislature, and in 1917 a committee was appointed 
to investigate the need for vocational Education in 
the province* 

This committee visited various centres in Canada 
and the United States where Vocational Education formed 
a part of the secondary school program* They also made 
a careful study of the needs of the youth of New Bruns¬ 
wick with regard to employment opportunities, by inter-

ional circles across Canada for many years prior to 
h\}s death*

viewing employees in industry, commerce and other 
fields of endeavour . The committee completed its 
study by April, 1918, and submitted its report to the 
legislature . This report found the following conclusions 
in regard to a system of practical education: 

lm That New Brunswick needs Vocational Education . 

2 . That Vocational Education is most successful 
when it deals with the occupations of the 
locality in which the school is located and 
where the nature of teaching may be made ruore 
realistic by close contact with industry . 

3o That Vocational Education is for the masses 
of workers and should be made accessible to 
all. 

The committee recommended that, to meet these 
needs, a system of Vocational Education be developed, 
and that a sum of money be allotted from the Provincial 
funds to assist the school districts in putting the 
system into operation . The Legislature acted immediately 
upon the Committee’s report and passed the New Brunswick 
Vocational Education Act in April 1918 — one year 
before the Federal Government passed its first Vocational 
Act under which Federal assistance was made available to 
the provinces .

In brief, the First New Brunswick Vocational 
Act provided: 

1. That a system of Vocational Education be 
established on a 50 - 50 basis between 
the County and the province on operating 
costs • 

2. That a Vocational Education Board care for 

provincial administration • (The late Dr* 

Peacock was appointed Director and Secretary 
of the Board on May 1, 1919.) 

3. That Vocational Education have as its aim the 
training for useful employment in order to 
increase the productive efficiency of the 
learner as well as to develop his civic 
intelligence* 

4. That full time classes be provided for 
those from fourteen to twenty-five years 
and evening classes for those over sixteen 
years . 

5. That local Vocational Committees be established . 

The first actual work done by the Vocational 
board dates from the beginning of the school year 
1919-1920 at the Carleton County Vocational School at

Woodstock, with day classes in Homemaking and Agriculture, 
and evening classes in commercial subjects and Mechanics. 
During the same year nine other communities were organ¬ 
ised for vocational evening classes . 

The New Brunswick Vocational Act of 1918 did not 
provide aid towards the cost of buildings and equipment 
and consequently progress was slow in establishing 
day classes . The emphasis was thrown on evening classes 
and during the years 1920 and 1921 seven districts 
organised night schools • In addition to the evening 
classes, eleven communities on the Atlantic coast were 
served by an itinerant instructor giving training in 
marine engine repair. 

At this critical time in the history of Vocational 
Education in New Brunswick, the sums of money made 
available under the Dominion Education Act of 1919 
finally found their way into the provincial coffers 
and by the year 1926 six of the now familiar Composite 
High Schools had been completed. Until this Federal 
aid was offered, the only grant to schools interested 
in vocational Training was 50% of operating costs from 
strictly Provincial funds . With the additional money 
available , reimbursements were made to school districts

on the following terms: 

1 . SALARIES 

(1) For salaries of approved Vocational teachers, 

60% of the amount paid in communities above 
6,000 persons; 

(2) 66 2/3% of the amount paid in communities 
between 2,000 - 3,000 population; 

(3) 75% of the aviount paid in communities of 
2,000 or less; 

2 . BUILDINGS 

(1) For buildings erected or portions there¬ 
of, 25% in cities of 10,000 population or 
over; 

(2) 33 1/3% in cities and towns from 5,000 to 
10,000 population; 

(3) 50% in towns and districts under 5,000 
population; 

(4) 50% of the total cost of vocational 
equipment in all cases . 

In 1923, a second Provincial Vocational Act was 
passed which brought all vocational plans and policies 
under the control of the Board of Education of the 
Province. The Provincial Vocational Board set up in 
1918 was charged with the administration of Government 
aid, general supervision, special short courses, instruction

by itinerant teachers and correspondence courses. 

The money made available to the Province under 
the provisions of the Dominion Vocational Act was 
wxhausted in 1951 . The Provincial Government cont¬ 
inued to pay the full rebates to the local school 
districts until 1952, when falling revenues due to 
the depression forced it to cut the grants so that 
the school districts had to assume the additional 
portion of expenditure that was formerly covered 
by Federal grants . This resulted in a closing of 
a few Vocational Departments and a drastic re¬ 
duction in teachers r salaries . In 1937 the Provincial 
Legislature restored to their former size the scale of 
rebates as laid down by the Provincial Vocational Act 
of 1923. 

Thus the discontinuance of Federal grants for 
Vocational Education in 1931, and the depression of 
the early thirties, brought to a close the development of 
the first phase of Vocational Education in New Brunswick. 
Two vocational and five urban Composite High Schools were 
established and operating with facilities for about 
5,000 students at the end of this period. 


From 1931 to 1940 the development of the vocational

program was almost at a standstill due chiefly to 
falling provincial revenues during the depression . 

The seven schools already established offered to 
the young people of the urban communities in which 
they were situated a modified version of the multi¬ 
track high school curriculum presently in force in 
the schools of Alberta . Students had the choice of 
College Preparatory, Industrial, Home Economics, and 
in the rural and agricultural area of Carleton County, 
Agriculture in place of College Preparatory . 

Dr, Fletcher Peacock was made Director of 
Educational Services in 1836, a position which 
parallels that of the Deputy Minister of Education 
in other provinces, Under his guidance, and in step 
with latter day developments in education the follow¬ 
ing innovations were introduced into the province ; 
Visual Aids, teacher training for Industrial and 
Home Economics and a Teachers 9 Library • 

Progress in Vocational Education remained re¬ 
latively dormant until 1843, which was a momentous 
year in several respects. The philosophy underlying 
vocational training, had not been clearly defined and 
the objectives remained to be brought to focus in the

Annual Education Report of 1945. The words of the 
Chief Superintendent of Education in that report are 
reproduced herewith: 

*In order to give rural pupils an even chance 
with their city cousins, they must have modern 
high schools as well as improved elementary 
schools. This means the erection of forty or 
fifty regional composite high schools at 
strategic centres. These schools, to he 
effective, must not he too small. Each re¬ 
quires at least 100 students of Grade VII and 
up, and 300 would he better. Transportation 
will have to he arranged to bring students 
from quite long distances. 

*Each school must provide training in 
agriculture and farm mechanics and one main 
objective of each school will he build up its 
own community. Nutrition and Home Economics 
courses will he provided for the girls in 
order that the homes too may he servedl. Every 
future citisen has the right to training in 
essential academic subjects on the secondary 
school level. In a democracy the college door 
should not he closed to those who wish to enter 
and practical training should certainly he not 
denied to those who can profit from it. These 
Rural High Schools through a composite of 
academic and vocational courses, will train not 
only those few who go to college, hut also the 
many who remain at home. 

n Each composite high school will he the 
center of the cultural and vocational life 
of the community. The playgrounds, the library, 
gymnasiuh, classrooms, shops, cafeterias, motion 
pictures, radio, health clinic, etc., will he 
used by pupils during school hours and by groups 
of adults during evening and vacation periods. 
The Principal of the school as the community 
leader will, besides running his day class, 
promote all suitable types of adult education. n 


Ambitious as this plan may seem at first glance,

it will be interesting to examine in the light of 
present attainments the extent to which words have 
been translated into action . 

Before the framework of the vocational system 
in the province could become reality, two things 
were necessary ; first, the setting up of the larger 
unit of school administration on the county basis, 
and second, the passing of legislation to permit the 
establishment of Regional High Schools of a composite 
type in rural areas . The first condition, i.e., the 
development of the county unit, was provided for in 
the County Schools Finance Act of 1944 . That action 
was not long in coming is shown by the fact that, in 
1945, one year after the passing of this act, fourteen 
out fifteen New Brunswick Counties were consolidated 
into the county finance unit of administration . The 
second condition, that of appropriate legislation 
permitting the establishment of Regional Nigh Schools , 
was fulfilled by the passing of the New Brunswick 
Rural Schools Assistance Act in 1943 and amendments 
in 1948 . Under the impetus provided by the passing 
of this Act thirty Regional High School consolidations 
were established, in which thirteen Regional High 
Schools were operating, ten Consolidated Districts 
were in the planning stage of securing sites and 
preparing school building plans, and the remaining seven

districts have schools actually under construction

2 o THE REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL IN NEW BRUNSWICK 

The functional role of the New Brunswick 
Regional High School is illustrated in those areas 
where forestry is the basic industry . Through the 
help of civic-minded individuals and corporations, 
forestry plots have been donated to the Regional 
School with a view to teaching better forestry 
practice . These wood lots vary from 50 to 160 acres, 
and it is intended that ten schools suitably located 
will take advantage of this plan .

One cannot but wonder why the Board of Vocat¬ 
ional Education, having taken a progressive step 
in the matter of forestry practice, should be con¬ 
tent to pause at this stage. Reference to il l ust- 
rati on I will show many Regional High Schools 
located in tidewater areas where fishing is the 
predominant occupation. The interior of the 
Province contains many rich farming districts, 
particularly along the St. John River valley. 

Looking at this situation with a detached, but 
critical eye, it is possible to see great value in 
the adaptation of the *wood lot n principle to farm¬ 
ing communities in terms of experimental farm plots. 

It is apparent that the chart of students in 
attendance at Regional High Schools shows two periods 
of rapid growth, one from 1919-1929 and one from 1939- 
1949 with a plateau between showing the effects of 
the depression on school development. It can be noted 
that the two periods of grovjth are periods in which 
Federal Aid was available. In other words, as far as 
New Brunswick is concerned. Vocational Education has 
grown and developed with the assistance of Federal 
Aid, and growth has been most rapid when that aid was 
avai lable.

2. EXTENSION OF THE 60-50-40-20 PLAN TO URBAN 
VOCATIONAL HIGH SCHOOLS WITH ST. STEPHEN AS 
AN EXAMPLE 

The 1948 amendments to the Rural Schools Assist¬ 
ance Act, also known as the Vocational Act, which made 
available assistance formerly granted only to rural 
areas • This assistance is knovm as the 60-50-40-20 
plan and is described, in Chapter III under, "Provincial 
Aid to Capital Expenditure. " 

An example of one of the six urban centres 
which have taken advantage of the Vocational Act is 
St. Stephen with a population of approximately 10,000. 
St. Stephen is an industrial area ; and the vocational 
needs of the students have determined the types of in¬ 
struction that are given. 

Students in 1952 may elect to study woodworking, 
drafting and blue printing, electrical theory and con¬ 
struction, automobile mechanics, metal working and 
household science. The construction consists of a 
$250,000 addition to the St. Stephen Academic High 
School.

ments is that school locatedin sparsely settled areas. 
Unlike the Regional and Urban High Schools, no pro¬ 
vision is made for vocational training. The Rural 
High School of New Brunswick, however, is a potential 
community centre and is designed to serve the need for 
adult education in the community. 

Typical of the Rural High School is Keswick 
Valley which contains seven classrooms, science 
laboratory, auditorium and projection room, kitchen 
and janitors’, teachers’ and principals ’ rooms. 
Provincial Aid under the Vocational Act is limited 
to the 60-50-40-30 plan and 50% of the cost of school 
transportation. 


5. SUMMARY OF SCHOOLS RECEIVING ASSISTANCE UNDER THE 
NEW BRUNSWICK VOCATIONAL ACT OF 1948 AND AMENDMENTS 


Three types of schools have appeared in New 
Brunswick as an outcome of Federal Aid to vocational 
education and the Vocational Act of 1948. These are, 
first, the Conso li dated 1 Rural Re gional High School in 
thickly settled rural areas. This type of school re¬ 
ceives aid to capital expenditure under the 60-50-40-30 
plan. School transport and vocational equipment are 
half financed by the province. Vocational teachers’ 
salaries are three-quarters financed by the province. 
Second, the Urban Vocational High Schools receive aid

under the same provisions as the Regional High Schools • 
Third, the Rural High Schools receive aid under the 60- 
50-40-50 plan hut no further assistance . 

6. INTEGRATION OF NEW BRUNSWICK VOCATIONAL AND 

ACADEMIC CURRICULUM 

The new Intermediate Course of Studies in Grades 
VII, VIII and IX shows a definite socialising trend, 
which in the writer r s opinion, compares favorably 
with the aims and practices of similar programs in 
other Canadian provinces • Compared\ with the 
academically weighted program in vogue before 1949, 
there is a definite broadening of subject matter . The 
interest in Vocational Training in New Brunswick is re¬ 
flected in the inclusion in the general intermediate 
course of studies of General Shop and Household Arts, 
designed; 

(1) "To provide a training that will enable the 

pupil to find for himself a place in community 

life which shall be both personally satisfact- 

1 

ory and socially useful . n 
Further objectives enumerated in the Intermediate 
course of studies are: 

(2) "To acquaint the students with such fields of 

knowledge as will adequately prepare them for 
the business of living, that is, for useful, 
happy, and desirable citisenship.

(3) "To create an exploratory period with a 
greater variety of courses, and therefore, 
with enlarged opportunities for aptitude 
findings ; 

(4) "To provide a connecting linh between the 
lower and upper levels in such a way that 
there shall be no sudden break, in the con¬ 
tinuity of the school program, no jumping- 
off place from one grade to another — in 
other words, to provide a unifying force 
for the whole system; 

(5) "To allow slight variations in the school 
training in order to satisfy vocational 

2 

needs peculiar to a particular locality» " 

The fifth aim in this enumeration is an outcome 
of the peculiar geographical condition of this 
Atlantic province, which sees within its border many 
basic industries, including lumbering, fishing, farm¬ 
ing, mining, and shipbuilding . Consolidated schools, 
in particular, provide Vocational training suitable 
to the basic economy of their area . For example, 
the Urban Vocational High School at St • Stephen 
stresses the Industrial Arts, thus answering the needs 
of a community whose primary occupations are centered

around medium heavy industry. 

The vocational curriculum in the Consolidated 
Regional High Schools of New BrunswicK is of necessity 
flexible in nature to allow the principals ample scope 
in the selection of courses suitable to the needs of 
the area « The board of Vocational Education specifies 
only that a minimum of 15% to 25% of the time of 
students in Grades VII to XI be occupied at vocational 
subjects. Furthermore full-time, properly certificated 
vocational teachers must be employed in fully equipped 
General Shop and Home Economics classrooms.

CHAPTER V 


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

The following points emerge from the foregoing 
survey of the educational system of New Brunswick;. 

Fin a nc ial m _Cons iderations 

1 . The present arrangement whereby the salaries 

of Vocational teachers are financed to the extend of 
approximately 75% by the Provincial government is a 
present and potential source of difficulty. In Rural 
Regional High Schools, academic teachers are working 
beside Vocational teachers of comparable training 
who earn as much as 75% more. 

2. Federal Government aid to the Provinces to 
promote Vocational Education, has, in New Brunswick, 
resulted in making vocational and secondary training 
available to numerous urban and rural communities 
hitherto unable to provide such instruction • 

Administrative Considerations 

1. The fact that New Brunswick solved her sectarian 
conflict without resorting to Separate Schools, reveals 
the ingrained propensity to compromise indicated as a 
salient characteristic of her people in the historical 
survey covered in Chapters I and II.

2* The dual language situation, while not a source 
of difficulty at present, could conceivably become 
a problem in future, owing to the lack of academic 
certification above Class III for French speaking 
candidates. 

3. The New Brunswick system of County Finance 
Units follows the national trend toward centralisation . 
The pressing of municipal administrative machinery 
into the service of these larger school units promises 
reasonable economy of operation. Control of financial 
requirements still rests with local consolidated 
boards through their annual school budget* 

Vocational Education 

1o New Brunswick, traditionally classical in out¬ 
look, has promoted Vocational Education to an extent 
greater than most Canadian provinces* Two reasons 
for this situation are apparent. First, the large 
widely scattered rural population requires many types 
of training varying with the geography and economy of 
particular areas. Second, the classical tradition 
persisted while most of the United States and Canada 
adopted a *progressive n outlook. A belated realisation 
of this fact has spurred New Brunswick to great efforts
