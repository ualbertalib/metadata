THE EFFECTS OF SULPHUR ON THE 


QUALITY OF WHEAT 


Francis Lloyd Rigby 


INTRODUCTION 


The protein content of wheat is not an ideal 
measure of baking strength for it takes into account 
only the total amount of protein present and is in no 
way a measure of the quality of the protein® In general 
application* protein content is the best single measure 
expressive of baking strength, apart from actual baking 
tests, but in particular cases it frequently proves in¬ 
adequate In explaining loaf volume differences® 

It is well known that differences in the quality 
of protein do exist® If such differences in quality of 
protein did not exist, then flours of equal protein con¬ 
tent would be expected to produce loaves of equal volume, 
provided that a suitable baking formula is used® While 
in the majority of cases this rule holds true, there are 
many times when it does not® There must, then, be some 
other factor, or factors, almost certainly associated 
with the protein, which are responsible for these dis-

crepancles. 

The crude glutens from hard wheats of dif¬ 
ferent baking strengths generally vary in both quantity 
and physical properties. Particularily where the dif¬ 
ferences in baking strength are large, the physical 
properties of the glutens from high and low quality flours 
show very obvious differences. The gluten from poor qual¬ 
ity flours lacks the cohesive, elastic, and extensible 
properties of that from strong flours. 

Much research has been done in order to find an 
explanation as to why these differences in gluten quality 
occur. As yet, no entirely adequate answer has been found 
to this problem, though it has been attacked from a variety 
of angles. 

Extensive physico-chemical studies have been 
carried out on doughs and glutens in attempts to establish 
sound criteria for evaluating the quality of gluten. However, 
no strictly chemical test as yet applied has been of value in 
differentiating between strong and weak glutens. 

The gray wooded soils of Alberta are particularily 
noted for the production of wheat of inferior baking quality. 
In 1929 the Department of Soils of the University of Alberta 
commenced a series of experiments with various fertilizers 
at Breton, in the gray wooded soil area. (See Wyatt, Newton 
and Ignatieff, 26). The response in yield of crops to the

fertilizers containing sulphur was particularly notable. 

There was also a marked improvement in the baking strength 
of wheat grown on plots receiving a sulphur bearing fertilizer 
over those receiving fertilizers containing no sulphur. This 
difference was, in many cases, not explainable on the basis 
of protein content of the wheat. The evidence pointed to some 
quality factor in the gluten as being responsible for the wide 
range in baking strength. 

The apparent improvement in the quality of the wheat 
as a result of a sulphur fertilizer, prompted a more critical 
study of this element and its compounds in the wheat itself. 

The investigation was carried forth as outlined in 
the following report. 

REVIEW OF LITERATURE 


As nearly as can be determined, the literature 
reveals no information of significant value in indicating the 
probability or improbability of the sulphur content of wheat 
being a factor influencing the baking strength. In view of 
this, some of the literature reviewed may appear to be re¬ 
motely connected with the problem. It does, however, give 
some knowledge of the metabolism of this element and the 
probable forms and quantities which are present in the plant. 

As mentioned in the introduction, the remarkable

increases in baking strength of flours milled from wheat 
grown on the plots receiving sulphur bearing fertilizers, 
as compared with those receiving no sulphur, is illustrated 
by Wyatt, Newton and Ignatieff (26). They further show that 
the protein content appears to bear slight relation to the 
loaf volume in many cases. 

Peters (17), working also with Breton material, has 
shown that sulphur fertilizer applications to crops results 
in higher sulphur content of the plant products, particularly 
in the case of legumes which have a high nitrogen requirement. 

Wood and Barrien (24) state that the sulphate ion 
constitutes the sole source of sulphur to plants and that 
sulphur-containing proteins are the synthetic end-products in 
the sulphur metabolism. 

Wood (25), in a later paper, further states that the 
only sulphur constituents of the protein molecule are the 
sulphur-containing amino acids, cystine and methionine. 

These acids also occur in the free state in plant tissue, to¬ 
gether with cysteine and glutathione which are derived from 
them. Cystine and methionine are present in approximately 
equal amounts in the plant tissue, 

Hoffman and Gortner (14), 1922, state that cystine is 
the principal form of sulphur in proteins and that cysteine, 
as such, has never been proven to be present. They found 
evidence of some other form of sulphur being present.

Methionine, which may have represented the remainder was 
discovered only in the previous year, 1921. 

Harrow (13) lists five sulphur containing amino acids, 
namely, methionine, cystine, ergothionine, lanthionine and 
djenkolic acid, which are found in biological substances. 

He classifies cysteine as a reduced form of cystine, of im¬ 
portance in biological reactions. It is formed readily upon 
the reduction of cystine. 

In the literature reviewed, no reference could be 
found signifying the presence of ergothione, lanthionine 
or djenkolic acid in wheat or wheat products. 

Cysteine is noted for its sulphydril group, (S-H), 
which is highly reactive due to the hydrogen being readily 
surrendered to oxidizing agents. The organic compounds of 
sulphur are frequently divided into two groups on this basis, 
that is, those containing S-H groups and those without. 

Where the sulphur is linked on both sides to a oarbon atom, 
or to some atom other than hydrogen, the linkage is com¬ 
paratively stable and is non-reducing. 

In wheat, by far the most attention has been given 
to the S-H compounds. One of the sulphur compounds in wheat, 
glutathione, possesses a sulphydril group. Glutathione is a 
polypeptide of glutamic acid, glycine and cysteine. It occurs 
chiefly in the germ in wheat according to Sullivan, Howe and 
Schmalz (20), and no more than traces, if any, are found in

patent flours from commercial mills* The reducing 
capacity of the S-H group in glutathione is considered 
by Sullivan, Howe and Schmalz (21), and also Balls and 
Hale (1,2), to be responsible for the activation of some 
of the proteolytic enzymes in wheat with consequent del¬ 
eterious effects on the baking quality* They further 
believe that the oxidation of this S-H group by heat 
treatment, aging and flour improvers, such as potassium 
bromate, at least partially explains the beneficial effect 
of these processes* 

On the basis of experiments testing the rate of 
oxidation of glutathione by potassium bromate, Smith and 
Geddes (19), cast some doubt on the validity of this theory. 

Myers and Working (16) tested flour protein fractions 
for the presence of S-H groups. In preliminary experiments, 
neither reactive nor unreactive S-H groups were found in the 
gluten proteins. The soluble portion of the protein was 
tested and only after denaturation were Indications of the 
presence of unreactive S-H groups found* The presence of 
free S-H groups was found in the lipid fraction obtained 
upon ether extraction. 

Greaves and Bracken (11), found no inorganic sulphur 
in wheat and concluded that all the sulphur was present in 
organic form* The range of sulphur content of the Utah var¬ 
ieties tested was 0*15,$ to 0*22$, A correlation coefficient

of 0*81 was found between sulphur and nitrogen content, 

Gubler and Greaves (12), working also with Utah 
wheats, found percentages of cystine ranging from 0*338$ 
to 0.405$ in the whole wheat, with an average of 0.364$. 

A greater percentage of cystine was found in spring wheats 
than in winter wheats. When the data were subjected to 
statistical analysis, as much difference was found between 
different determinations on the same variety as between 
variety means. In general, variations in sulphur content 
were accompanied by corresponding variations in the cystine 
content. The higheijpercentage of cystine In spring wheats, 
as compared with that for winter wheats, was paralleled by 
a correspondingly higher average value for total sulphur 
and nitrogen. The variation between the highest and lowest 
value for total sulphur was about 46$ of the mean whereas 
that for cystine was only 20$, Thus not as wide a range 
was obtained in the percentages of cystine as in those of 
sulphur. It was observed that the cystine sulphur constit¬ 
uted about 50$ of the total sulphur, with the range from 
47$ to 66$. In general, as the total sulphur and cystine 
increased, there was a decrease in the percentage of the 
total sulphur represented as cystine. The coefficients 
of correlation found for sulphur and cystine and for 
nitrogen and cystine were highly significant.

Csonka (7) determined the amounts of several 
amino acids in three varieties of wheat grovm in Ohio. 
Expressing the cystine found as milligrams per gram of 
nitrogen in the wheat he found:-

Thus, cystine was present 

as a greater proportion 


of the protein in Marquis than in the winter wheats. 

Barnstein (5), has developed methods for the 
determination of cystine and methionine and in applying them 
to purified cereal proteins* he obtained the following 
results:-

MATERIALS 

The wheat used in these experiments was of the 
Thatcher variety and was supplied through courtesy of the 
Department of Soils of the University of Alberta, It was 
grown on the Breton Experimental Field* in the gray wooded 
soil area of Alberta, seventy-five miles southwest of 
Edmonton, (For full details of the Breton Field Experiment 
consult Wyatt, Newton and Ignatieff 26), 

The series ,s Wheat after Glovers’ 8 consistently has 
produced the greatest variations in baking strength and con¬ 
sequently it has been chosen for this study. Three years 
material were available, 1941 to 1943 inclusive® 

All of the samples from the old Series, plots one 
to eleven, were used. The checks, samples 1, 5 and 11 were 
bulked together to form a representative check sample. Five 
samples from the new series, plots 13 to 26, were selected 
owing to their wide variations in loaf volume, and the 
relative amounts of nitrogen and sulphur fertilizers used. 
These plots were 13, 18, 19, 20 and 21, The checks, 13 and 18 
were bulked as in the old series to give one check sample. 

For cystine and methionine determinations, each of 
the 1941 snd 1942 samples of similar sulphur content and loaf 
volume were bulked, in order to conserve the limited quantity 
of material and to reduce the number of samples.

METHODS 

Protein 

Nitrogen was determined using the Kjeldahl- 
G-unning-Arnold method, with mercuric oxide as catalyst. 

The protein is N x 5.7, and results are reported on a 
13,5$ moisture basis. 

B aking 

Flour samples of 100 grams were baked using 
the malt-phosphate-brornate formula, with 0.3$ diastatic 
malt, 0.1$ ammonium phosphate and 0.001$ potassium 
br ornate. 

Sulphur 

The A*O'.A.0* (15) method using nickel crucibles, 
open fusion and sodium peroxide was used, but the following 
modifications were introduced: 

Seven grams of anhydrous sodium carbonate were 
added to the material at the outset. After moistening, 
sodium peroxide was added in small amounts until eight grams 
had been added, stirring constantly. The granular mixture 
was then allowed to stand over night. Following this, the 
mixture was heated over a low bunsen flame with constant 
stirring, until evolution of gas had ceased and the fusion

mixture was dark and pasty. Three grams of sodium per¬ 
oxide were then added, and the covered crucible heated 
over increased flame for five minutes. The crucible was 
rotated until the contents had solidified and then placed 
in a 600 cc beaker and 100 cc of distilled water added 
immediately. This was followed with concentrated HOI, 
and the crucible was turned to bring all parts in contact 
with the solution. As the voilent reaction subsided the 
acid was added carefully until the solution was just clear. 
The crucible was removed and rinsed thoroughly with dis¬ 
tilled water. 

The remaining steps were carried out in the 
regular manner. 

Gluten Washing 

The solution suggested by Dill and Alsberg (8), 
was used, namely, 4$ sodium mono-phosphate adjusted to 
pH 6,8 by the addition of sodium di-phosphate. Using this 
as a stock solution, further dilution was made in the 
proportion of one part stock solution to forty parts of 
unboiled distilled water. Washing time was standardized 
at ten minutes for a 30 gram sample.

locating methods for the determination of cystine in this 
material. Although cystine has been determined quite 
extensively in biological material, little work has been 
done with wheat. 

Two methods which offered possibilities of suc¬ 
cess were found. These were: 

(1) The colorimetric method of Gubler and Greaves (12), 
for the determination of cystine in whole wheat. 

(2) The gasometric method of Barnstein (3) for the de¬ 
termination of cystine in proteins. 

( 1) The Golorimetric Method 

G-ubler and G-reaves reviewed methods for the 
determination of cystine in search for a method adaptable 
to wheat. They eventually decided upon the method of Folin 
and Looney (9), as modified by Shinohara (18). They added 
further modifications to this method in adapting it to wheat. 

This method was followed in every detail accord¬ 
ing to the procedure outlined by G-ubler and Greaves, Three 
difficulties were encountered in applying the method. 

(1) Directions for the preparation of the color reagent 

were not contained in the outline, nor were they avail- 
able in any of the papers directly referred to by Gubler 
and Greaves, A method for the preparation of molybdate- 
free phospho-18- tungstic acid reagent was located in 
Folin and Marenzi (10), It was assumed that this was the 
color reagent used but this is not definitely known.

(2) Complete directions were not given for the preparation 
of the color standard* In the literature cited, both 
cystine and cysteine hydrochloride were used in either 
hydrochloric or sulphuric acid solution* Both were 
tried here, however, with no perceptible difference in 
results. 

(3) A Bausch and Lomb colorimeter, as prescribed, was not 
available. The Ernst Leitz colorimeter used did not 
permit a wide range of color intensities in the un¬ 
knowns without frequent changing of the color standard* 
Since the color-producing reaction requires strict ad¬ 
herence to a time schedule in making readings, the 
instrument was hardly suitable for even a moderate num¬ 
ber of samples. 

Table 1 shows some of the results obtained with 
this method. There is a decided lack of agreement among 
replicates, even between duplicate determinations on the 
same hydrolysate. The cystine percentages account for a 
smaller fraction of the total sulphur than was anticipated, 
but this may or may not be a fault of the method.

Same hydrolysate 


The method was applied to wheat gluten with 
slightly better agreement between duplicates, but with even 
lower percentage of the total sulphur represented. 

Starch and gelatin mixtures were prepared and 
known amounts of pure cystine added. These samples were 
hydrolysed and the following recoveries obtained: 

Sample Actual Cystine % Cystine Found % 

1 6,6 0.44 

2 3.3 0,15 

3 0.0 Negative Quantity 

Samples of urine were tested and found to average 
approximately ten milligrams of cystine per 200 cc. This 
is within the normal range and signifies that the method 
as used would probably have been successful on such mate-

rial. 

The low recovery of cystine in the starch-gelatin 
mixtures, as compared with the presumably satisfactory 
determination on urine points to the probability of loss 
during hydrolysis. The only apparent chance for error in 
hydrolysis was the tendency for the material to produce 
humin nitrogen which collected in a charred mass on the 
sides of the hydrolysis flask. This material adhered so 
tightly that it could not be removed by washing down during 
hydrolysis. Glass beads were used to extract this residue 
from the flask upon the completion of hydrolysis* 

(2) The Gasometric Method 

This method was developed by Barnstein (3) for the 
determination of cystine in proteins. No attempt was 
made here to apply it to the whole wheat, but rather to 
the gluten as washed from the flour. 

The gasometric apparatus was constructed in the 
laboratory according to the plan of Van Slyke and Neil 
(23). The trial determinations were performed on pure 
cystine and cysteine solutions. 

o 

Barnstein (3) states that at 25 C. the change 
in pressure for 3.85 milligrams of cysteine or 3.79 
milligrams of cystine is 48.1 plus or minus 0.7 millimeters 
of mercury. In other words, a change on pressure of approx**

imately 12.5 mm. is produced by one mg. of cysteine. 

It is not clearly stated whether this means one 
milligram of cysteine in the total sample, in the aliquot 
oxidized by the iodine solution, or in the 1 cc. of iodine- 
sample mixture introduced into the apparatus,, 

The change in pressure for each 0.5 mg. of cysteine 
in the total sample was found here to be extremely small, 
less than 0.2 mm. For each mg. of cystine in the 2 cc. 
aliquot oxidized by the iodine solution the change in 
pressure was 11.4 mm. For each mg. introduced into the 
apparatus for testing it was 57 mm. Presumably B arnstein 
meant the aliquot oxidi zed by the iodine solution. How¬ 
ever, there is still some lack of agreement. 

The results in Table II show the change in pressure 
per increment of 0.1 mg. of cysteine in the one cc. sample 
introduced into the apparatus. Each figure is the mean of 
several determinations. The results are plotted graphically 
in Figure 1.

Except for the first increment, the change in 
pressure for each additional increment is approximately 
the same* Theoretically, each increment should have 
produced the same change in pressure and the regression 
line should have passed through the zero point* The only 
explanation that can be offered is that part of the ex¬ 
cess iodine was oxidized by some impurity either in the 
hydrochloric acid, the hydrazine solution or the mercury, 
with consequently less liberation of nitrogen gas® 

Neglecting the first increment, the average change 
in pressure for each 0*1 mg® of cystine in the test sol¬ 
ution was 5*7 mm* 

Calculation of results was performed as follows:-

Methionine 

Only one method for the determination of methionine 
was located, namely, the method of Barnstein (4) for the 
determination of methionine in proteins* 

Barnstein states that there is a possibility of the 
results not being absolute, since the ability of many sub¬ 
stances, which may be present, to yield volatile iodides 
has not been fully investigated. 

The method was applied here to samples of crude gluten 
in hope that it would give some indication of the relative 
amounts of methionine present* 

The difficulties encountered were entirely mechanical; 

(1) Ground glass joints, as prescribed, were not pro¬ 
curable. For the boiling flasks, corks, charred 
corks and finally rutber stoppers were used. All 
showed considerable signs of deterioration by the 
hydriodic acid. 

(2) The carbon dioxide stream was delivered by a high 
pressure carbon dioxide cylinder, the rate of flow 
being regulated by the needle valve carried by the 
cylinder. The rate of flow was thus controlled with 
difficulty. Much more satisfactory control could 
have been made with a constant pressure valve of 
the type used on high pressure tanks. 

The water was brought to 60°G by circulating it 
through a heating coil immersed in a constant temperature

of success for the purpose intended here, particularly 
if a more purified gluten is used, 

RESULTS 

1941 Material 

The first experiments were carried out on the 1941 
samples* Protein content, sulphur in whole wheat* sulphur 
in flour and sulphur in gluten were determined* The re¬ 
sults are presented in Table V together with the loaf 
volume figures obtained for the bread bahed from these 
samples. 

The loaf volume ranges from 405 cc» to 750 cc, and 
the protein content from 11,6$ to 14,1$, From even casual 
examination of the results it is apparent that the vari¬ 
ations in loaf volume are not due to corresponding vari¬ 
ations in protein content. Outstanding examples can be 
selected, such as Sample 19 with the highest protein content, 
14,1$, and a very low loaf volume, 485 cc,, as compared with 
S ample 20 with a much lower protein content, 12,8$, and the 
highest loaf volume, 750 cc. Sample 6 as compared with 
Sample 4 is a similar case. From the statistical calculations 
presented in Table VI, the correlation between protein con¬ 
tent and loaf volume is not statistically significant. Some 
factor or factors other than protein content must be re¬ 
sponsible for the differences.

The sulphur content of the wheat varies over a 
considerable range, from 0.12$ to 0.22$. The high sul¬ 
phur values are consistently associated with the high loaf 
volumes. Samples 19 and 20, 4 and 6, and some others, 
illustrate this apparent effect of sulphur on loaf volume. 

A highly significant correlation exists between the sul¬ 
phur content of the whole wheat and the loaf volume. 

The sulphur content of the flour follows closely 
that for the whole wheat but the level is slightly higher. 

This indicates that the sulphur is more concentrated in the 
endosperm of the kernel than in the whole wheat. 

S amples of crude gluten were prepared from each 
flour and analysis for sulphur performed. A much higher 
level of sulphur is clearly shown, indicating that the sul¬ 
phur in wheat is concentrated in the protein. The range of 
sulphur content is much greater in the gluten than in either 
the whole wheat or the flour. However, the glutens high in 
sulphur are quite regularily produced from the flours high in 
sulphur, as would be expected. 

A high degree of association is also evident between 
the sulphur content of the gluten and the loaf volume. This 
is confirmed by tho highly significant correlation coefficient. 
This is strong evidence that sulphur, as some component of 
the protein, contributes in some way to high baking strength. 

As is shown in Fig. 2, there is a tendency for the 
points to be grouped at each end of the regression line.

apparent effect of sulphur on loaf volume* 

The multiple correlation coefficient, Hy.pw 
highly significant* In addition, this multiple is sig¬ 
nificantly higher, statistically, than either the simple 
r V w or r-yp, which signifies that both protein and sulphur 
exert a positive influence on loaf volume and that appar¬ 
ent overlapping can be expected* 

It is interesting to note that In this material 
the deposition of sulphur has not, to the slightest degree, 
followed the deposition of nitrogen, the correlation co¬ 
efficient actually being negative*

1942 Material 

Similar analyses were carried out on the 1942 
samples. In addition the weights of dry and moist 
gluten were recorded. The results are presented in Table 
VII. 

The range in loaf volume for this year is not as 
large as that obtained in 1941, the total range being 207 cc. 
for this year as compared with 347 for 1941. 

Further evidence of the lack of agreement between 
protein content and loaf volume is evident. There is, how¬ 
ever more of a positive relationship here than with the 
1941 samples as is shown best by the Just significant rpv 
value. Table VIII. 

The association between sulphur content of the wheat 
and the loaf volume Is still apparent, but not to such a 
high degree as in 1941, If the four samples, 18 to 21, are 
considered separately, the sulphur Is seen to correspond 
quite well with the loaf volume, and the protein content does 
not. These four samples are of a different series, as has 
already been noted. Thus, dividing the data and considering 
each part separately, a much closer agreement between loaf 
volume and sulphur in wheat is obtained in both sections, 
and a lesser agreement between protein and loaf volume. 

Sample 8 is an outstanding exception, the high loaf volume 
not being supported by either protein or sulphur content.

There are too few samples in each division to permit 
statistical calculations and* therefore, the correlation 
coefficients are derived from all 13 samples* 

The partial correlation coefficient r V w.p shows an 
increase over the simple r V w & s would be expected, indicating 
some improvement in the correlation when the effect of protein 
is eliminated* 

The R v# p W is significantly higher, statistically, than 
either r vw or r vp , again indicating that both protein and. 
sulphur contribute to the variations in loaf volume# 

In the over all correlation between sulphur in gluten 
and loaf volume, no association is evident between these two 
variables* Despite this low coefficient, considering the 
four new series samples separately shows that the improving 
effect of higher sulphur in the gluten is definitely present* 
The irregularities in the old series, however, destroy the 
correlation* 

The range of sulphur content in the gluten is not as 
great as in 1941, 0*22$ as compared with 0*32$. Since loaf 
volume is also extended over a narrower range, only a few 
irregularities are necessary to reduce the correlation to 
below the significant level* 

In view of the significant correlation between sulphur 
in wheat and loaf volume, and also the fact that the sulphur 
is concentrated in the gluten, it seems justified to conclude 
that sulphur is still a significant factor affecting the

baking strength of the samples. 

In this year's results also, there is no signi¬ 
ficant correlation between sulphur and nitrogen content. 

The weights of dry and moist gluten provide ad¬ 
ditional information. The highly significant correlation 
between the weight of moist gluten and loaf volume in¬ 
dicates that the factor responsible for the differences in 
loaf volume also modifies the physical properties of the 
moist gluten. The physical properties are obviously not 
dependent upon protein content alone, possibly not at all. 
Since sulphur has been shown to be a significant factor 
contributing to baking strength, there is distinct evidence 
that the presence of sulphur in larger amounts is at least 
partly responsible for the improved physical properties of 
the gluten. 

The higher correlation between weight of dry gluten 
and loaf volume than between protein content and loaf volume 
is explainable on the basis of purity of the gluten. The 
more elastic, cohesive and tenacious properties of the better 
glutens increase the difficulty of complete removal of the 
starch in gluten washing. Consequently, more of the starch 
is present in the better glutens at the end of the standard¬ 
ized washing period. Further, this will have a lowering 
effect on the apparent sulphur content of the gluten.

1945 Material 

The 1943 samples were of very low commercial grade 
due to extremely unfavourable weather conditions prior to 
harvest. Many of the samples failed to reach a proper 
stage of maturity, and all were severely damaged by frost. 

Sulphur and protein content of the wheat, together 
with the baking results are presented in Table IX. 

The loaf volume figures show that all of the samples 
are of uniformly low baking strength. The total range is 
so low that one value can hardly be considered significantly 
different from the mean value if the probable baking error 
is taken into account. Since loaf volume is used as the 
final basis for the measurement of quality, the material is 
not suitable for this study, as no quality differences are 
evident. No statistic involving loaf volume was calculated. 

Sulphur analyses of the samples show that consider-* 
able variation in sulphur content occurs. The response to 
the various fertilizers is similar to that of 1941 and 1942, 
The protein content varies over a normal range but on a 
slightly lower level. 

A notable exception occurs this year, in that there 
is a highly significant correlation between sulphur and 
nitrogen content.

Cystine Analyses 

On the assumption that most of the sulphur is 
present in the gluten in the form of one or both of the 
two common sulphur-containing amino acids, cystine and 
methionine, a quantitative measurement of each of these 
in the gluten was attempted. Only the measurement of 
cystine was sufficiently successful to warrant reporting 
the results. The analyses were carried out on the 1941 
and 1942 samples after they had been bulked according to 
special grouping as indicated in “Materials". Protein 
content of the gluten was also determined after the samples 
had been bulked. 

The values for sulphur in wheat, sulphur in gluten, 
and loaf volume are the mean values of those samples which 
were bulked to produce the new sample. It is expected that 
these values will approximate what would, have been obtained 
by performing the analyis or baking test in each case. The 
data are presented in Table X. 

The amount of cystine in the gluten ranges from 
1.40# to 2.29#. The cystine sulphur represents from 56# 
to 89# of the total sulphur with a mean value of 76#. 

Subject to error of the method, it appears that cystine is 
the main sulphur containing component of the gluten protein. 

The cystine percentage in the gluten is also pos¬ 
itively and significantly correlated with loaf volume.

There is a tendency for the cystine-sulphur/total- 
sulphur ratio in the gluten of 1942 series to be high in 
those samples exhibiting high baking strength, and low in 
those of inferior baking strength, but this is not borne out 
by 1941 results. 

The cystine content of the gluten is highly sig¬ 
nificantly correlated with the sulphur content of the 
whole wheat. Since in both 1941 and 1942 a close relation¬ 
ship was apparent between sulphur in whole wheat and loaf 
volume, and since the cystine content of the gluten cor¬ 
responds very well with the sulphur content of the wheat, 
it seems definite that the cystine in the wheat or gluten

contributes to baking strength. 

The nitrogen content of the gluten shows that all 
the glutens are not of the same degree of purity. There 
is a tendency for higher purity of gluten to be associated 
with low baking strength. Sample 3* with the lowest lo^f 
volume, has the lowest cystine value and the highest gluten 
purity. In direct contrast, Sample II has the highest loaf 
volume, one of the highest cystine contents, and the lowest 
gluten purity. This is further evidence that sulphur, prob¬ 
ably in the form of cystine, improves the physical properties 
of the gluten. It also indicates that if the samples were 
all of the same degree of purity, a greater range would exist 
between the high and low cystine, or sulphur In gluten, val¬

DISCUSSION 

It would appear that sulphur has heretofore been 
overlooked as a possible factor affecting baking strength 
of wheat. No publication has been located in which this 
problem has been discussed. 

The first indication that sulphur might be a factor 
in wheat quality arose from the fertilizer experiments of 
Wyatt, Newton and Ignatieff (26), It was apparent that an 
improvement in baking quality generally resulted from the 
application of sulphur fertilizers. No attempt was made, 
however, to correlate the sulphur content of the wheat or 
wheat fractions with the baking strength, 

Peters (1?) found that the application of sulphur 
fertilisers resulted in increased sulphur content of the 
wheat but he did not associate the sulphur content of the 
wheat with improved baking quality. In this, and the pre¬ 
ceding paper, the subject is dealt with from the aspect 
of plant nutrition. 

This material is well suited to this study for sev¬ 
eral reasons; 

(1) It provides a wide range of quality, as evidenced 
by the baking results, 

(2) There is considerable rang© in protein content 
and for the most part the expected relationship 
between protein content and loaf volume does not 


occur

(3) The wheat has been produced on a soil nat¬ 
urally deficient in sulphur and hence there 
has been a marked increase in sulphur deposi¬ 
tion wherever sulphur-containing fertilizers 
have been applied. 

(4) In this systematic longtime study of the ferti¬ 
lizer requirements of the gray wooded soils, 
yearly variations in the significance of quality 
factors in the wheat can be studied® 

Perhaps this particular set of conditions has not 
occurred in any other part of the wheat growing areas of 
North America* It may also be, however, that this phenom¬ 
enon is purely a result of the specific conditions and will 
not explain protein quality differences under other con¬ 
ditions. At least, however, this does represent one ca.se 
where a chemical difference in constitution has been closely 
associated with varying quality in wheat protein® 

There is need for much further research on this 
problem. It would be of considerable significance if the 
amount of sulphur or sulphur-containing amino acids in the 
protein could be shown to account for variations in wheat 
protein quality in general. 

G-reaves and Bracken (11), have shown that the sul¬ 
phur content of wheat differs between varieties* They fur¬ 
ther state that the sulphur/nitrogen ratio remained quite 
constant. The foregoing results have shown that the latter 


\j n r) o 


rtnuoiriB 

xaci'-o^q 

.tfiooqq 


o 





4? 


is not true in all cases. 

Osonka (7) has shown that the percentage of cystine 
is considerably higher in the protein of Marquis in Ohio 
than it is in the protein of Tenmarq or Fulhio, the former 
being hard red spring variety, and the latter two, hard 
red winter and soft winter respectively. 

A study of the amounts of sulphur and sulphur-con¬ 
taining amino acids in the wheat fractions., particularly 
the protein, among varieties, and perhaps kinds, might 
reveal the reason for protein quality differences. In 
Western Canada the quality of the protein of Garnet has been 
proven to be inferior for bread making to that of the ap¬ 
proved hard red spring varieties. It would be interesting 
to determine whether or not the lower quality is associated 
with lower sulphur and cystine content * One of the main 
difficulties probably would be encountered in obtaining samples 
of different varieties of comparable protein content, grown 
under similar conditions, but differing sufficiently in 
protein quality as indicated by the baking results. 

While significant information has been obtained in 
this study using crude gluten as representative of the 
protein, more precise results could be obtained using a more 
purified protein. As was illustrated, the weak glutens are 
purer than the stronger glutens when obtained under constant 
washing conditions. This could be partially overcome by

prolonged washing, but even then differences in purity 
would likely occur* 

Further investigation of methods for the accurate 
determination of the sulphur-containing amino acids in 
both the wheat and the protein would be of value in con¬ 
tinued studies of the influence of sulphur on baking 
strength. 

The manner by which an increased amount of the 
sulphur-containing amino acids could influence the gluten 
properties and also protein structure, assuming that the 
two are related, reaches further into the complexity of 
protein chemistry than this discussion is prepared to ven¬ 
ture. However, it is of interest to note that Hoffman and 
Gortner (14) state that aside from the normal peptide lin¬ 
kage, only one other linkage has been demonstrated in 
proteins and that is the S-S linkage in cystine.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


(1) The purpose of this investigation has been to ex¬ 
amine the possibility of sulphur being a factor affecting 
the baking strength of wheat* The samples used were pro¬ 
duced on the Breton Field Experiment where improved baking 
strength, not explainable on the basis of protein content, 
had been noted as a result of the application of sulphur- 
containing fertilizers* 

(£) Three years 1 material have been studied. Protein 
content, sulphur content and loaf volume were determined 
in the three years, sulphur in flour and sulphur in gluten 
in two years, and the weights of moist and dry gluten in 
one. The data were analysed statistically. 

(5) Methods for the determination of cystine and 
methionine have been discussed. A gasometric method for 
the determination of cystine in the gluten has been applied 
to some combined 1941 and 1942 samples and the results cor¬ 
related with loaf volume, sulphur in wheat and sulphur in 
gluten. 

(4) The protein content In this material is not ad¬ 
equate as an indicator of baking strength. 

(5) Sulphur content of the wheat is positively and sig¬ 
nificantly correlated with loaf volume. The relationship

varies between years, being more outstanding when protein is 
less closely associated with baking strength and when loaf 
volume differences are large. 

(6) The sulphur in wheat is concentrated in the gluten. 

It is present in larger amounts In the glutens from the 
"strong 11 flours and it appears to modify the physical prop¬ 
erties of the gluten, increasing elastic, cohesive and ex¬ 
tensible characteristics. The weight of wet gluten is highly 
correlated with loaf volume# 

(7) Cystine Is the principal form of sulphur In gluten, 
ranging from 56$ to 89$ with a mean value of 76$. There is 
a tendency for the cystine-* sulphur/total-sulphur ratio to be 
higher in the "strong* 8 samples. Most of the sulphur not ac¬ 
counted for as cystine is probably present as methionine® 

(8) Cystine content of the gluten is closely associated 
with loaf volume, sulphur in gluten, and particularly sulphur 
in wheat. 

(9) The sulphur/nitrogen ratio in wheat is not necessarily 
constant.

APPENDIX 

FOREWORD 

The data presented in this appendixare not associ¬ 
ated with the foregoing thesis* 

Since wartime labour regulations curtailed research 
in non-essential projects, the u Sulphur and Wheat Quality n 
investigation was interrupted* This report represents some 
work done in connection with the investigation into the 
production of 2,3-butylene glycol from grain* carried on in 
associated laboratories* It is included in this appendix 
only for the purpose of a permanent record* 

INTRODUCTION 

Information with respect to the program of the 
investigation and the organism used in the fermentation are 
found in Canadian Investigations on the Production and 
Esterification of 2,3-Butylene Glycol (6), and Studies on 
the production of 2,3-Butylene Glycol from Grain (22)* 

The starch analyses presented in the following re¬ 
port were carried out In order to determine whether or not a 
relationship existed between the yield of glycol and the 
percentage of starch in the wheat samples used in the fer¬ 


mentations

MATERIAL 


Representative grade samples of wheat were collected 
from five inspection offices* Calgary* Edmonton* Moose Jaw* 
Saskatoon and Winnipeg® The commercial grade and the origin 
of each sample are Indicated in Table X-A along with the 
other data* 

Comparable pairs of samples* one weathered and one 
unweathered* from four points in Alberta were analysed to 
determine starch content differences due to weathering and 
the relation of such differences to glycol yields* Details 
are presented with the results* Table II-A. 

METHOD 


Starch was determined using Clendenning 1 s modification 
of the Mannich-Lenz method (6)* Starch percent is expressed 
on a moisture free basis*

CONCLUSION 


No consistent relationship is apparent between starch 
content and glycol yield. Statistical analyses of the starch 
content with the glycol yield for the 1 5$ mash shows a cor¬ 
relation coefficient of 0*360, not significant. 

The starch content is negatively and highly signif¬ 
icantly correlated with protein content, a coefficient of 
-0*70? being obtained,

CONCLUSION 

Starch content tends to be higher In the weathered sample 
from each pair* However, the increase is not consistent and 
ranges from -1,4$ to +1,9$, There is no significant relationship 
between starch and glycol except perhaps with organism 500 where 
a negative relationship appears to exist.
