Preface 


Steam caring is being introduced into the con¬ 
crete masonry industry more and more every day. This 
investigation was carried out to elucidate some of the 
problems arising in steam curing and to determine some of 
the effects of steam curing upon the concrete. Also, since 
there has been little known work done concerning the effect 
of steam curing at atmosphereic pressures upon the bond 
between concrete and steel, a short investigation was carried 
out to more or less pave the way for more investigations of 
this nature to be carried out at the University of Alberta. 

One of the main items of this investigation was 
the building of a steam curing kiln suitable for laboratory 
use. This part of the investigation was performed in 
conjunction with Mr. D.A. Bernard, B.Sc. When the steam kiln 
was built and functioning properly, we both branched out 
into separate investigations. 

A total of 300 cylinders was made and tested 
and 24 pull-out tests performed. The conclusions reached 
from these tests are listed on pages (90) anfl (127) 0 

The author is deeply indebted to Professor L.A. 
Thorssen for his valuable suggestions and guidance. Appre¬ 
ciation is also due to Mr. L.F. Fead and Mr. G.C. Malmberg, 
laboratory technicians, for their advice and assistance in 
keeping the equipment functioning at all times

HISTORY 

The demand for concrete masonry units has app¬ 
roximately doubled within the last ten years, creating an 
unprecedented burden in the concrete masonry industry. 

Plants have been enlarged, new plants established; new and 
more efficient equipment has replaced the old every few 
years; labor saving methods have been installed and 
production processes speeded up - all in an effort to keep 
output abreast of demand. This speed up has made the cur¬ 
ing cycle the object of critical examination and research. 

In the modern factory production of concrete prod¬ 
ucts it is necessary to speed up the curing cycle from a 
matter of weeks to a matter of hours. This necessity arises 
for a number of reasons; to release moulds and pallets as 
quickly as possible; to generally syncronize the curing 
cycle with the manufacturing process; and to put the finished 
product on the market as soon as possible to avoid having 
tp provide extensive storage space. In the speeding up of 
the curing cycle there must be no sacrifice in the quality 
of the finished product; if anything, the quality of the 
finished product should be improved. 

Naturally, the best way to cure concrete is by 
warmth and moisture, therefore the speeding up of this process 
lends itself to steam curing. Some acceleration of setting and

curing can be achieved by chemical means, but steam cur¬ 
ing is more effective and susceptible to accurate control. 
Considerable amount of work has been done in the steam 
curing of concrete but the results are in some respects 
contradictory and not easily applied to commercial practice. 

Some of the earliest work was done in 1911, by R.J. Wig 
and later a few investigations have been made in comm¬ 
ercial kilns, Mansfield (2) Nurse (3). From a study of the 
literature, steam curing lends itself to three main proc¬ 
esses: (1) High Pressure, (2) Low Pressure Continuous and 
(3) Low Pressure Intermittent. 

High Pressure Process 

High pressure steam curing consists of curing 
blocks in high pressure vessels at about 125 psi and temp¬ 
eratures in the vicinity of 350 degrees - 360 degrees Fah¬ 
renheit. Excess water is kept in the chamber, and control 
is therefore achieved by regulation of either temperature 
or pressure alone. The steaming period, 8 to 10 hours, is 
compartively short but the process is intermittent. 

In -A.C.I. Committee 716 (5) the following conclus¬ 
ions were reached regarding high pressure steam curing: 

c oncrete masonry products can be produced by high 
pressure steam curing methods and ready for use 
within 24 hours after molding. 

2. High pressure steam curing is complete without 
cracks and without substantial change in shape or 
size. 

3. High pressure steam cured units are substantially

in a drier condition and lighter in color than 
moist cured units, and give a clear ring when 
tested with a hammer. 

4. Compressive strength of high pressure steam cured 
units at one day is at least equal to that of moist 
cured units at 28 days. 

5. High early strength of high pressure steam cured 
units is permanent. 

6. High pressure steam curing treatment tends to stab¬ 
ilize unsound materials that might otherwise result 

in popping or spalling in service. 

7. High pressure steam curing develops increased re¬ 
sistance to sulfate action. 

8. High pressure steam curing ( especially in the presence 
of silica) practically eliminates leaching and 
efflorescence. 

9. The strength of high pressure steam cured units is 
influenced by the amount and character of siliceous 
material in the mix but to a lesser degree in lean 
mixes than in rich and wet mixes. 

10. The shrinkage of high pressure steam cured units, in 
drying from a saturated condition to eauilbrium with 
air in a heated building, is about 50 per cent less 
than in moist cured units. 

11. High pressure steam curing results in lower bond 
stress between steel and concrete.

One can see from the above that the high pressure 
steam curing process does a good job but the equipment 
required is very expensive to install and operate. Also 
high pressure steam curing tends to make some aggregates very 
brittle. High pressure curing can be recommended only when 
it is important to reduce shrinkage or to increase sulfate 
resistance, or where the maximum strength is desired. 

The main difference between high and low pressure 
curing as given in Nurse (3) are; in high pressure curing, 

1. A more rapid increase in strength occurs owing to 
a higher temperature. 

2. With certain aggregates a lime silica reaction may 
take place between the cement and aggregate, and 
strengths may be developed in excess of that pred¬ 
ictable from the effect of increased hydration alone. 

3. A reduction in initial drying shrinkage and the 
reversible wetting and drying movements occur. 

4. An increased resistance to sulfate attack is obtained. 
Low Pressure Continous Process: 

For the mass production of concrete products the 
continous process has an advantage over the intermittent 
process for obvious reasons. The operation of the plant can 
be regulated so that there is a continous process from the 
time the blocks are made until they have been cured and put 
into the storage yard. The curing kiln usually consists of 
a long tunnel. The raw blocks are put in one end and the

cared blocks come out of the other end. The tunnel may 
have a temperature gradient at each end, and in this case 
the doors may be left open without undue loss of heat. 

The doors on a shorter high temperature tunnel may be fitted 
to conserve heat and in this case the haulage is usually 
intermittent. In this process a day and night shift is 
necessary for utmost in plant efficiency. 

Low Pressure Intermittent Process 

The low pressure intermittent process is carried 
out in a battery of curing kilns. The kilns are filled 
during the day and steamed during the night. The heating, 
steaming and cooling or soaking period are usually controlled 
automatically. There has been no definite conclusions 
reached yet, as to suitable lengths of time and temperatures 
for these cycles. A number of investigations has been carried 
out to ascertain the effect of different cycles and temper¬ 
atures upon the concrete products. All of these investigations 
show that there should be a waiting period after molding, 
before the concrete is subjected to steam curing* The 
length of this waiting time varies, but 2 to 6 hours is 
usual. 

Difficulties have arisen in the building of suit¬ 
able kilns for steam curing. It is necessary to know the 
atmospheric conditions within the kiln and the effect of 
different kiln atmospheres on the curing of the concrete 
products. The kiln must be built and operated properly to

iated with low pressure steam caring are: the effect of 
steam caring concrete units, building of a suitable kiln, 
establishing the proper steaming cycles and curing temper¬ 
atures, etc. When these problems have been solved the 
final result will be one of the greatest advances in man¬ 
ufacturing procedure in the concrete masonry industry.

FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN STEAM CURING 

The hardening process is a chemical reaction be¬ 
tween the cement and water known as hydration, and this 
chemical action is controlled by time, temperature and 
moisture, commonly known as curing. Faulty curing will 
cause incipient failure and limited life to the concrete 
irrespective of care taken in selection of aggregates, 
methods of placing or molding etc. Sufficient moisture 
must be in immediate contact with the cement for the normal 
products of hydration to develop. 11/hen a concrete block is 
cured in a steam kiln three atmospheres should be considered, 
atmosphere outside the kiln, atmosphere in the kiln gna the 
atmosphere within the block. Of importance in each of the 
three atmospheres are relative humidity, the temperature, 
vapor pressures and their relation to one another. Is 
moisture being added or taken away from the concrete block 
as the curing process is going on? If moisture is being 
taken away from the block, is their still enough left for 
hydration? 

Properties of Moist Air 

From a study of properties of air at various temp- 
eratures one can understand the difficulties of maintaining 
moisture in contact with cement during a high temperature 
curing cycle in a kiln at atmospheric pressure. Consider 
the data in Figure I selected from the tables in American 
Society of Heating and Ventilating (8) with points out the

amount of moisture necessary at high temperatures to maintain

The thermodynamic properties of saturated air 
are listed in 10 degree increments from 70 to 200 degrees 
Fahrenheit, inclusive. Column B shows the moisture require¬ 
ments per pound of dry air; Column C, the saturation press¬ 
ures in pounds per square inch; Column D, the enthalpy per 
pound of dry air; and column E, the heat content of the 
moisture of dry air saturated. The thermodynamic data is 
tabulated to show the decidedly progressive demands in moist¬ 
ure requirements, saturation pressure, heat content of dry 
air saturated as against straight line demands in tempera¬ 
ture and heat content of dry air. 

The curves in Figure 1 were established by plott¬ 
ing each thermodynamic property from 70 degrees to 200 
degrees Fahrenheit in 10 degree increments and expressed 
as a ratio to the condition at 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The 
curves further emphasize the problem of maintaining a sat¬ 
urated atmosphere when elevated temperatures are contemplated 
for accelerated concrete masonry curing in a kiln at atmos- 
hereic pressure. 

As another example, suppose a curing system is 
being employed having a dry bulb temperature of 130 degrees 
Fahrenheit and a wet bulb temperature of 130 degrees Fah¬ 
renheit which is 100 per cent relative humidity and 100 per 
cent saturated. If the dry bulb temperature were raised 
to ISO degrees Fahrenheit without the addition of any more

moisture, using the formulae and tables in American Society 
of Heating and Ventilating (8), the resulting wet bulb temp¬ 
erature would be 133 degrees Fahrenheit and the relative 
humidity £9.5 per cent. Similarly at £00 degrees Fahrenheit 
the relative humidity would be 19.£ per cent. 

Atmospheric Conditions in the Steam Kiln 

The atmospheric conditions within the kiln and the 
air outside the kiln are different at all times during the 
curing cycle. Suppose the kiln temperature is 160 degrees 
Fahrenheit and the outside temperature is 70 degrees Fah¬ 
renheit and further that both atmospheres have 100 per cent 
relative humidity. Then the vapor pressure within the kiln 
is 4.74 pounds per square inch and the vapor pressure out¬ 
side the kiln is 0.36 pounds per square inch, giving a press¬ 
ure differential of approximately 13:1. 

If the outside air had a relative humidity of 50 
per cent, which is more likely to be the ease, then the 
pressure differential would be still greater. Under these 
conditions moisture would be forced out of the kiln. This 
shows the necessity for having a well built kiln when con¬ 
sidering high temperature, high humidity curing of concrete 
products. 

Now consider the atmospheric conditions within 
the concrete block and the kiln atmosphere. If the vapor 
pressure within the concrete unit is greater than the vapor 
pressure in the kiln atmosphere, then moisture will move from

the unit to the kiln air. When a concrete block is first 
made excess water is usually present, therefore when the 
block is first put into the kiln the relative humidity with¬ 
in the block is very close to one hundred per cent. Unless 
the relative humidity of the kiln air is very close to one 
hundred per cent, there will be movement of moisture from the 
block to kiln air. But if the temperature of the kiln air is 
raised, temperature of the block will lag behind the temp¬ 
erature of the kiln air. If the relative humidity of the 
kiln air is kept near 100 per cent, moisture will move from 
the kiln air into the block even though the relative humidity 
of air within the block is 100 per cent. For example suppose 
the temperature of the kiln air is 165 degrees Fahrenheit 
and of the block 160 degrees Fahrenheit, and the relative 
humidity of the air within the block is 100 per cent and of 
the kiln air is 95 per cent. By using the table in American 
Society of Heating and Ventilating (8), the vapor pressure 
in the block is 9.6556 inches of mercury and the vapor press¬ 
ure of the kiln air is 10*522 inches of mercury. This shows 
that during the heating cycle it is not necessary to have a 
relative humidity near 100 per cent. In the above example a 
relative humidity of 87 per cent would still be quite satis¬ 
factory. 

If the temperature of the kiln remained constant 
for a considerable period, the kiln air temperature and the 
block temperature would tend to equalize; but heat produced 
within the block due to the hydration of the cement would

bring the block temperature slightly above that of the kiln 
air. From Figure 1 it can be seen that the higher the 
temperatures, the greater will be the difference between the 
saturation pressures for the same difference in temperature. 
Therefore if elevated temperatures are maintained for long 
periods, the moisture required for hydration of cement will 
be removed from the block regardless of the relative humidity 
of the kiln air, but the higher the relative humidity of the 
kiln air, the smaller is this movement of moisture. 

In the cooling or so-called soaking period of the 
steaming cycle, moisture will move from the block into the 
kiln air. The temperature of the block will be higher than 
the temperature of the kiln air. The temperature difference 
will be greater for faster rates of cooling. This would 
indicate that the rate of cooling should be controlled, and 
procede at a very slow rate. To illustrate these tempera¬ 
ture differences see Figure 2 obtained from Mansfield (2) 
and Shedeler and Chamberlin (9). 

The rate of temperature rise and rate of cooling 
must also be controlled to prevent thermal shock. If the rate 
of temperature rise or fall is too great, cracking will 
result from the differential stresses set up by the large 
temperature gradients. This will have a greater effect on 
the larger concrete units; also the shape and position of the 
reinforcing will have an effect when the possibility of thermal 
shock is considered. The average rate of temperature rise in 
most plants is above \ degree Fahrenheit per minute and the

cooling rate is somewhat slower. 

From the discussion so far an ideal steam cycle 
might be proposed such as the following: Heat to a fairly 
high temperature quite quickly, for example \ degree 
Fahrenheit per minute from 70 degrees Fahrenheit to 150 
degrees Fahrenheit; then increase from 150 degrees Fahrenheit 
to 180 degrees Fahrenheit, a rate of heating that will keep 
the temperature of the kiln air just above the temperature 
of the block. Suppose that this is kept up for 12 hours 
and then the cooling cycle is started. This cycle could be 
adjusted somewhat to coincide with the plant operations and 
other factors in the operation of a concrete products plant. 
With a cycle like this, one would have to be able to control 
the kiln temperature very accurately, and because of this 
some manufactures might stray away from this type of steam¬ 
ing cycle. However, with the number of automatic devices 
developed today, it should not be hard to control automatic¬ 
ally a cycle such as this. 

Phase Equilibrium 

It has been explained why a kiln atmosphere of high 
relative humidity is required but now it is necessary to 
consider how to obtain this type of atmosphere. From 
thermodynamics it is indicated that to have a condition of 
equilibrium existing below 212 degree Fahrenheit and at 
atmospheric pressure, it is necessary to have a system con¬ 
taining steam, water and air. This means we must have air, 
water and steam entering the kiln. 

The above can be explained better in terms of

phase language. The number of degrees of freedom or var¬ 
iance of a system is given by the equation: 

V * C / 2 - P 
where 

V = variance or degrees of freedom 
C = number of components 
P = number of phases. 

In the case of steam and water entering the kiln, 

C - 1 (Water) 

p = 2 (Water and water vapor) 

Valjz-zz i e 

Thus we have one degree of freedom, and if we 
stipulate atmospheric pressure, there is a unique temperature 
for equilibrium conditions, namely 212 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Now consider steam, air and water entering the 
kiln, where 

C - 2 ('Water and air) 

P - 2 (Saturated air and watefc) 
V-e/2-2-2. 

T We now have two degrees of freedom, and if we stip¬ 
ulate atmospheric pressure we still have one degree of free¬ 
dom left, so that we can vary the temperature and still have 
equilibrium conditions. Thus, to have saturation conditions 
existing at atmospheric pressure and temperatures below 212 
degrees Fahrenheit, it is necessary to have steam, water and 
air entering the kiln.

Carbonation 

The carbonation of the concrete is another factor 
that should be considered in curing of concrete masonry. 

When sufficient moisture is not present with Portland cement 
during the curing cycle, carbon dioxide from the kiln atmos¬ 
phere is absorbed by the concrete and this can be detriment¬ 
al or beneficial. If the carbonation occurs before the period 
when the Portland cement hydration compounds are being formed, 
it is detrimental, but if it occurs following the hydration, 
it is beneficial* As the concrete becomes successively 
drier, the rate of carbon dioxide absorption becomes increas¬ 
ingly greater. The detrimental effect is to make the con¬ 
crete units brittle, although the strengths may be favorable. 
In view of the harmful effect of carbonation during hydration, 
caution should be observed in selecting a curing method that 
develops heat and moisture, particularly when the system 
being considered causes the products of the fuel combustion 
to become part of the kiln. 

Drying of Blocks 

If the concrete block is to be put into almost 
immediate use, it is desirable to have a dry block. If the 
block has a high moisture content when put into use, there 
will be considerable shrinkage which is detrimental to the 
resulting structure. As a result of this some plants use the 
last part of the cooling cycle as a drying cycle. This is 
quite feasible, because as the block temperature cools it 
will be higher than the kiln air temperature, and due to the

vapor pressures moisture will be forced from the block to 
the kiln air. If the relative humidity of the kiln air is 
reduced, the movement of moisture from the block will be 
still greater. 

When a temperature of 221 degrees Fahrenheit is 
maintained, then chemical compounded water is driven from 
the hydrated cement, which in turn tends to destroy the cem¬ 
ent gel. For this reason it is advisable to refrain from 
using temperatures in excess of 200 degrees Fahrenheit for 
atmospheric pressure curing. Similarly, when a plant intends 
to use dry heat for reducing moisture content, the same 
caution must be observed to prevent loss of chemically com¬ 
pounded water. 

Size of Concrete Block 

Another problem that will arise is the size of the 
concrete block or concrete specimen. The rate at which heat 
is taken up will depend upon the specific surface area, i.e. 
the surface area divided by the volume. Specific surface 
area for a 6 by 12 cylinder will be 0.83, for a 4 by 8 
cylinder 1.24 and for a 2 by 4 cylinder 2.5* If all the other 
factors in the units are kept constant but the size, then the 
temperature lag in the large cylinder will be greater than in 
the small cylinder during the heating and cooling periods in 
the steaming cycle. If the temperature of the kiln air were 
held constant for a considerable length of time, the temper¬ 
ature difference between the kiln air and the cylinder could 
be greater for the large block than the smaller block.

That is, the heat produced by the hydration of the cement 
would be lost more readily by the small block than by the 
large block. The vapor pressure differences in the two 
blocks would correspond to the temperature differences. 

As an example, suppose the kiln air were at a temperature 
of 180 degrees Fahrenheit, the smaller cylinder at a tem¬ 
perature of 182 degrees Fahrenheit, and the large cylinder 
at a temperature of 184 degrees Fahrenheit; then (assuming 
100 per cent relative humidity) the corresponding vapor 
pressures (American Society of Heating and Ventilating (8)) 
would be 15.294, 15.985, and 16.702 inches of mercury. As 
was said before, the greater the vapor pressure differences, 
the greater is the tendency for moisture to move from the 
block to the kiln air; however, in this case, the moisture in 
the large block would have further to travel than in the small 
block, so that there effect would tend to cancel one another 
out. From these considerations a prediction might be made 
that the smaller block would be cured slightly better than 
the larger blocks, but this remains to be seen. 

Type of Aggregates 

The effect of low pressure steam curing upon the 
different types of aggregates will not be so great as the 
effect of high pressure steam curing. The presence of 
excess amounts of calcium carbonate will affect the strength 
when low pressure steam curing is considered, especially 
at the higher temperatures. Dense aggregates and the conc¬ 
rete made from them will have a larger heat capacity and

therefore take longer to heat, but the thermal conducti¬ 
vity of the denser mixes will be greater and this will 
probably offset any effects due to heat capacity. 

Design of Mix 

The design of the concrete mix should have little 
effect upon the effectiveness of steam curing since steam 
curing primarily affects the hardening process or the hydr¬ 
ation of the cement. However where the water cement ratio 
of the mix is very low, that is to a point where there is 
insufficient moisture for hydration to take place, it will 
increase the necessity of having a condition in the cur¬ 
ing chambers so that moisture will move from the kiln air 
into the block. Also where the mix design results in a 
dense concrete, the effect will be the same as that discussed 
under aggregates.

LABORATORY EQUIPMENT 

L Steam Curing Cabinet for the Laboratory 

Introduction 

A steam curing cabinet to be used in investiga¬ 
tions on the effect of steam curing at atmospheric press¬ 
ures must be susceptible to accurate control, and also the 
individual elements which go to make up a steam curing kiln 
must be controllable. From the thermodynamic considerations 
laid out in the previous sections, it is necessary to have 
steam, air and water entering the kiln to obtain the required 
high relative humidity of the kiln. The steam supplies the 
necessary heat and, although it can be replaced by other 
means, for this investigation steam was the most practical. 

Also it is more economical and practical to use standard build¬ 
ing materials wherever possible in the construction of the 
steam kiln. 

Following are some of the necessary requirements 
in an experimental steam kiln: 

(1) . To be able to obtain an atmosphere in the kiln 

of very high relative humidity over a wide 
temperature range. The temperature range in 
this investigation was from 75 degrees Fahren¬ 
heit to 185 degrees Fahrenheit. 

(2) . To be able to control the rate of temperature 

rise and temperature fall and to be able to 
hold a constant temperature for considerable

siibje c t the concrete specimens to different 
curing cycles. 

(5). To provide a method of measuring and record¬ 
ing the temperature within the kiln and with¬ 
in the concrete units over long periods of 
time. 

(4) . To have uniform temperature throughout the kiln* 

(5) . To be able to measure the pressure within the 

kiln to check whether the pressure is atmos¬ 
pheric. 

(6) . To provide a means of measuring the weight 

changes of the concrete unit during the cur¬

(7). To provide a means of measuring the relative 
humidity within the kiln* 

Construction of the Steam Kiln 

Figures on pages (26), (27), (29) and (30) ill¬ 
ustrate the steam kiln in different views. The kiln was 
built out of brick and concrete. It consisted of a cabinet 
5 feet by 3 feet by 2| feet. The walls were made of a 
single layer of bricks, the roof consisted of a concrete slab 
lit inches thick and the floor consisted of a concrete slab 2 
inches thick. Both the roof and floor slabs were reinforced 
with chicken wire. A single tapered door 28 inches square 
provided access to the cabinet. Holes were left in the central 
portion of both ends to provide an entrance for the steam and

an exhaust* Holes were left in the roof slab to provide 
passage ways for the thermocouple leads and other equipment* 
The inside surface of the kiln was lined with "Horn Kiln 
Liner”, an asphaltic type kiln liner compound sold by 
A.C. Horn, 821,Queen Street E, Toronto 8. The interior was 
divided into top and bottom sections by an open shelf 
of 2 by 4 slats supported on a aluminum frame. Figures 
(3), (6) and (7) on pages (26), (29) and (30) illustrate 
provisions made to obtain the first requirements of the 
steam kiln. Steam, air and water were introduced into the 
kiln. The amount of each material necessary was not computed 
but was put into the kiln in such quantities that the re- 
quired atmosphere was likely to be obtained. The air, water 
and steam entered the mixing chamber first. The air came 
from an air supply line delivering air at 25 pounds per square 
inch. The steam came from the radiator heating system, using 
exhaust steam from the University of Alberta power plant 
supplied at 3 to 4 pounds per square inch. The water came 
from the city water supply and entered the mixing chamber 
through a fog nozzel of the type used in air conditioning 
systems and rated at 0.65 gallons per hour at a pressure of 
40 pounds per square inch. The mixing chamber consisted of 
a one-inch diameter standard four way pipe fitting. From the 
mixing chamber the resulting atmosphere went into the steam 
kiln through a one inch diameter pipe. An extra fog nozzel 
was placed on top of the kiln to ensure a high relative 
humidity.

The second requirement of the steam kiln was ful¬ 
filled by regulating the steam supply to the mixing chamber, 

A "Powers" type "T" direct acting, air operated, thermo 
regulator and J-inch valve capable of delivering 88 pounds 
of steam per hour at a pressure of 4 pounds per square inch 
was used. The valve was connected between the steam supply 
and the mixing chamber and a by pass valve provided for use 
if necessary (see Figure (7), Page (30)). The thermo 
regulator was placed on top of the kiln with the thermostatic 
temperature rod extending into the cabinet. 

The regulator employs a copper bulb and invar rod 
as the sensitive element. With a change in temperature at 
the bulb, a valve inside the regulator is positioned to vary 
the air pressure to the diaphram which operates the valve. 

The thermo regulator could be set at the desired 
temperature by the adjusting knob, but in order to obtain the 
steaming cycles automatically it was necessary to build a 
remote control mechanism. This remote control devise con¬ 
sisted of a small electric motor which turned a cam very 
slowly (approximately one revolution per day). The cam 
actuated a rack and pinion assembly which in turn operated 
the adjusting knob on the thermo regulator. The cam was so 
shaped that any desired curing cycle could be obtained. 

Finer adjustments of the steaming cycle were obtained by 
providing a cam follower push rod which was adjustable. A 
schematic sketch of the remote control mechanism is given in 
Figure (5), Page (28). A different cam was made for each

cycle so that when it was decided to run the steam kiln at 
a different cycle it was necessary to change the cams . The 
mechanism provided a large range of temperature control, 
allowed an accurate reproduction of any curing cycle, did 
away with manual control except for the initial adjustments 
and was relatively simple, 

A "Brown Temperature Recorder" provided the answer 
for the third requirement for a curing kiln to be used for 
experimental purposes. The Brown Recorder measured and 
recorded temperature by the use of thermocouples. A total 
of sixteen thermocouples could be connected to the recorder 
and temperature records would be kept for the sixteen 
thermocouples. (The operation of the "Brown Temperature 
Recorder" is completely outlined in "Manual of Maintenance 
and Operation" supplied with the instrument.} 

To obtain the average temperature of the kiln dur¬ 
ing the curing cycles, eight thermocouples were placed in 
the kiln and then connected to a single lead. The result¬ 
ing temperature was the mean of eight temperature readings 
throughout the kiln. 

The fourth requirement was provided by using a 
steam manifold and a baffle plate. The steam manifold was 
placed 4—inch above the floor. The manifold was connected 
to the mixing chamber by a one-inch pipe. The manifold 
was made from one-inch pipe and contained two rows of holes 
discharging down at an angle of 45 degrees. The holes had 
a diameter of 3/16-inches and were 7-inches centers. Each

row contained 7 holes. The atmosphere from the mixing chamber 
entered the kiln through these holes. The baffle plate was 
positioned at the exhaust end of the kiln. The baffle plate 
was made of transite board J- inch thick with 150 - J inch 
diameter holes. The baffle board was placed 8 inches from 
the end of the kiln. The exhaust pipe came out of the kiln 
at mid height in the centre of one end of the kiln and con¬ 
tinued for 140 feet to a waste water sump. This lay out gave 
a fairly uniform temperature throughout the kiln. The tem¬ 
perature at the corners of the kiln varied somewhat but no 
cylinders were placed here. The temperature variation was 
within about 5 degrees Fahrenheit. 

It may be noted here that at first two baffle 
plates were used (one at each end of the kiln) with the 
steam coming in at mid height in the centre of the end of 
the kiln opposite to the exhaust. The steam came direct from 
the mixing chamber and not through the manifold. With this 
method the temperature variation throughout the kiln was too 
great. The variation was about 20 degrees Fahrenheit. The 
use of the manifold proved much better. 

A "U n type water-filled manometer was used to 
measure the pressure inside the kiln. It was placed at the 
discharge end of the kiln. A rubber tube connected the man¬ 
ometer to the inside of the kiln. At first it was thought 
that the kiln pressure would probably be built up by a dis¬ 
charge pipe 140 feet long but this was not so. The greatest 
pressure difference recorded was about 0.05 pounds per square

inch, so that for all practical purposes the kiln atmosph¬ 
ere was at atmospheric pressure. 

To obtain the variations in weight of the concrete 
unit as the curing progressed a small beam type of balance 
was used. A scale pan was suspended inside the kiln by a 
wire running through a small hole in the roof of the scales * 

The relative humidity inside the kiln was measured 
by a thermocouple hygrometer. A flannel wick was wrapped 
around a thermocouple and the wick suspended in water and 
another thermocouple was placed just above the wet therm¬ 
ocouple. These two thermocouples indicated the wet and dry 
bulb temperatures within the kiln which could be used to 
compute the relative humidity. Enough space was left around 
the wick to allow a free circulation of air so the wet bulb 
temperature would be fairly accurate. 

During the construction of the experimental cur¬ 
ing kiln numerous trial runs were made to check the opera¬ 
tion. These runs showed that the requirements as set down 
were fulfilled. The investigation into the effect, of steam 
curing at atmospheric pressures upon concrete was then 
started.

Electric Motor and is operated at a speed of 20 revolutions 
per minute. This mixer is designed for laboratory work, 
having an open, circular, removable type of drum in which 
the concrete is mixed. Vertical mixing blades rotate in an 
opposite direction to the drum and can be raised vertically 
to allow removal of the drum. 

(b) . Testing Machine 

The load testing machine which was used for 
measuring compressive strengths of cylinders was a Baldwin 
Southwark Tate-Emery Testing Machine. It is a hydraulic, 
reaction-type load testing machine having a maximum capacity 
of 200,000 pounds. The machine has a pneumatic load indica¬ 
tor and also a loadpacer which enables the adjustment of the 
rate of loading to an desired number of pounds per second. 

The load indicator has three scales: 

0 - 10,000 lbs. Low Scale 

0 - 50,000 lbs. Medium Scale 

0 -200,000 lbs. High Scale 

This allows for the choice of whichever scale is required 

to give the maximum deflection of the needle, thus enabling 

greater accuracy in reading. The machine was accurate to 

about 0.25 per cent. 

(c) . Concrete Molds 

Cylindrical steel molds of 2, 4 and 6 inches inside 
diameter and 4, 8 and 12 inches high respectively were used. 
The walls of the molds were about one eighth of an inch thick. 
A steel base plate was provided for each mold. A clamping 
device was part of each cylinder to allow unloading of the

mold. (See Figure (9), page (35)). 

(d) . Tamping Machines 

Two types of tamping devices were used. The stan¬ 
dard "Proctor" tamping device as used in soil investigations 
was used for the large and the medium sized cylinders. It 
was necessary to construct a smaller one to fit inside the 
2 inch by 4 inch cylinder. The larger machine had a 5 - 
pound hammer and the smaller one a 3-pound hammer. In 
each case the hammer dropped one foot. A cylindrical guide 
was used in order that the hammer might be dropped one foot 
with each blow. (See Figures (b) and (10), Pages (35) and 
(36).) 

(e) . Moist Room 

A cement plaster-lined room 10 feet by 10 feet by 
8 feet was used as a moist room. Shelves and racks were 
provided in the moist room to hold the cylinders. A 
humidifier kept the room at a high relative humidity. The 
room was kept at a constant temperature of 70 degrees 
Fahrenheit by the use of the hot and cold water systems. 

(f) . Miscellaneous Equipment 

Other equipment used included drying oven for 
moisture content samples, shovels, trowels, containers for 
moisture contents, scales, pails, equipment for capping 
cylinders, thermocouples, etc.

LABORATORY PROCEDURE 


Outline 

Three types of curing cycles, run at three diff¬ 
erent maximum temperatures, were used in this investigation. 
In the first type of cycle the kiln was heated to tempera- 
ture at a fairly rapid rate (about one degree Fahrenheit 
per minute) then this temperature was held constant for about 
sixteen hours; after this the kiln temperature was brought 
back to room temperature at a fairly slow rate of tempera¬ 
ture fall (about J- degree Fahrenheit per minute). This 
cycle was run at maximum temperature of 135 degrees Fahren¬ 
heit, 150 degrees Fahrenheit and 185 degrees Fahrenheit. 

For the second type of cycle the kiln temperature 
was brought slowly up to the peak temperature and then 
slowly brought back to room temperature. The rate of tem¬ 
perature rise and temperature fall were the same. The 
curing cycle lasted for approximately twenty-four hours. 

The cycle was run at temperatures of 135 degrees, 160 degrees 
and 185 degrees Fahrenheit maximum temperatures. 

In the third type of cycle the kiln temperature 
was raised fairly rapidly (about one degree Fahrenheit per 
minute) to an intermediate temperature 20 degrees Fahren¬ 
heit below the peak temperature. The kiln temperature was 
then raised very slowly to the peak temperature. When, the 
peak temperature had been reached the kiln was cooled off 
slowly to room temperature. This cycle was run at peak tern-

peratures of 135 degrees, 160 degrees and 185 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 

It was thought that by using these three cycles 
some information could be gained concerning the best type of 
curing cycle and the best temperature for steam curing of 
concrete at atmospheric pressures* Moreover, the effect of 
steam curing upon the crushing strength of concrete might be 
brought out more readily. 

In a previous section it was stated that the size 
of the concrete specimen might have some effect upon the 
final result. It was therefore decided to use three sizes 
of cylinders in this investigation, namely 2 inch by 4 inch, 

4 inch by 8 inch, and 6 inch by 12 inch cylinders. The three 
sizes of cylinders were fabricated from the same mix and then 
subjected to the same curing conditions. 

To gain information on what happens to the con¬ 
crete cylinders when subjected to different curing conditions 
after steam curing, cylinders were made for moist curing 
after steam curing and for curing in the laboratory air. 

From each concrete mix twelve cylinders were made, 4 small, 

4 medium and 4 large. One cylinder of each of three sizes 
was put directly into the moist room, to be broken after 
7 days and to be used as a control. The remaining nine 
cylinders were steam cured; three (one of each size) were 
broken immediately after the steam curing cycle was complete; 
three (one of each size) were moist cured for six days then 
put in the laboratory air for seven days and then broken;

three (one of each size) were left in the laboratory air for 
thirteen days after steam curing and then broken. 

To gain some information on how steam curing 
affects the moisture content of the concrete, moisture con¬ 
tents of all the cylinders were taken. A total of 276 
cylinders was made and tested. 

Mix Design 

After a search through the bibliography it was 
decided to use a 1:6 mix (1 part cement and 6 parts agg¬ 
regate) and a water cement ratio of 0.45. For sand and 
gravel aggregates this was the most common mix design used 
by investigators in the literature. The sand and J-inch 
gravel were combined in equal amounts, which resulted in a 
well graded aggregate. When the mix had been made from 
this design, the batch weights for a two hundred pound mix 
were computed: water - 12.08 pounds, cement - 26.84 pounds, 
sand - 80,54 pounds and gravel 80.54 pounds. The weights 
for the aggregates were based on the saturated surface dry 
basis. A trial mix was run and found to be very satisfactory. 
The mix was very dry and had to be tamped into the molds 
thus bringing in another problem. 

Tamping 

The amount of tamping a concrete cylinder is given 
will affect the final value for the compressive strength. 
Because of this it was decided to give each unit volume 
of concrete the same compaetive effort. That is each cubic 
inch of concrete received the same amount of energy in the

process of being compacted in the cylinders. Two types of 
tamping machines were used: one with a 5-pound hammer fall¬ 
ing one foot, used for the large and medium sized cylinders, 
and one with a 3-pound hammer falling one foot, for the 
smaller cylinders« For each unit volume of concrete to 
receive the same compactive effort, the large cylinders 
were compacted in eight layers, each layer being subjected 
to 22 blows, the medium cylinders in 5 layers, each layet 
receiving 10 blows, and the small cylinders in 3 layers, the 
first two layers receiving 3 blows and the last layer receiv¬ 
ing 4 blows. This procedure proved very tedious but was 
strictly adhered to throughout the investigation. 

^reparation of Aggregates 

To make possible the production of mixes which 
were very close to the design mix, it was necessary to prepare 
the aggregate. This preparation consisted of mixing the 
aggregate thoroughly with water until uniform, conditions had 
been obtained and the moisture content had passed the satu¬ 
rated surface dry condition. Each size of aggregate was then 
put in individual containers and covered with a damp sack, 
and samples of the prepared aggregates were then taken for 
moisture content computations. This procedure made it 
feasible to gain good control over the mix. 

Fabrication 

To eliminate as many errors as possible in the 
fabrication, the same sequence of events was followed for 
each mix. All the materials of the mix were weighed to the

nearest ounce and then everything was put in the mixer 
except the water. The materials were mixed dry for one 
minute and then the water was put into the mixer and the 
mixing continued for another five minutes. At the same 
time samples of the aggregate were taken to make moisture 
content computations in order to know the exact condition 
of the aggregate as it went into the mixer. 

When the mixing was finished the concrete was 
tamped into the molds. When thermocouples were required, 
they were located at the centre of the cylinder. The test 
cylinders were then left to stand for about 4 hours before 
being stripped and put into the steam kiln and the moist room. 
Loading the Steam Kiln 

Extreme care had to be used in loading the kiln 
as the concrete had not quite set up, with the result that 
it was easy to chip off the edges of the cylinders. The 
cylinders were spaced in an orderly arrangement in the kiln. 
The thermocouples were the connected to the Brown Recorder. 

One of the specimens was placed on the scale pan in order 
to obtain the weight variations as the curing cycle pro¬ 
gressed. 

The kiln was now prepared for the curing cycle. 

The proper cam was placed on the electric motor and the 
necessary adjustment made. The fog nozzles had to be 
cleaned every day as heat seemed to precipitate a substance 
which clogged up the small screen within the fog nozzles. 

The electric motor was started and the steam, air and water

turned on. When the steaming cycle was complete the doors 
were opened and 3 cylinders were tested, 3 put in the moist 
room and 3 left in the laboratory air. 

Testing Procedure 

The cylinders were capped with a sulfur and fire¬ 
clay mixture to ensure a square and level surface. The 
cross sectional diameter of each cylinder was taken. All 
cylinders were tested in the testing machine at constant 
rates of loading for each size. The load was applied at 
40,000 pounds per minute for the large cylinders, 20,000 
pounds per minute for the medium cylinders and 4,000 pounds 
per minute for the small cylinders. Immediately after the 
cylinders were broken, a sample of concrete was taken from 
each for moisture content computations. 

The results of the tests are tabulated in Tables 
(1) and (2), Page (50) and (51).

Tables and Graphs of Results 

Table No, 1 

Table No. 1 shows the weight variations in the 
medium cylinder during the curing cycle. See Graph numbers 
(14), (18), (19) and (20) for the relationship between these 
weight variations and the various curing cycles. The weight 
variations include the water that condensed upon the out¬ 
side of the cylinder and upon the scale pan. 

Table No. 2 

This shows the compressive strengths and the moi¬ 
sture content of all the cylinders tested. It also shows 
the water cement ratio and batch weights of the twenty-two 
mixes. 

Tab le No. 5 

Table No. 3 lists the strengths of all the cylinders 
broken, as per centsges. 

First the strengths are expressed as per centages 
of the strengths of the large cylinder after it was cured 
in the moist room for 7 days. That is, the strength of the 
large cylinder after seven days moist curing is taken as 100 
per cent. Per centage values were used to eliminate part¬ 
ially the effect of the variations arising between the 
different mixes. 

Next, the strengths are expressed as a per centage 
of the strength of the corresponding cylinder size, using ad¬ 
justed values for the seven day moist cured strengths. 

When all the moist cured strength values found for the three 
cylinder sizes were used, on the average the small cylinder

showed a strength value of 71 per cent of the large cylinder 
and the medium cylinders showed a strength value of 104 per 
cent of the large cylinder. These three values were used 
in computing the adjusted values found in Tables No. 3. 

For example in Mix No. 8: 

Compressive strengths of the large, small and 
medium cylinders were 8770, 1970 and 8970 psi, the average 
value being 8570 psi. This value was then taken as 91.67 
per cent of the strength of the large cylinder (since the 
average value of 100 plus 71 plus 104 is 91.67)* 

Then the adjusted strength value for the large 
cylinder is: 

100 X 8570 « 2800 psi 

91.67 

For the small cylinder: 

0.71 X 2800 *1990 psi 
For the medium cylinder: 

1.04 X 2800 * 2910 psi 

If the strength value for the small cylinder did 
not compare favorably with the strength of the other two 
cylinders, it was ignored in the computations of the adjusted 
values as in Mix No. 6. 

Compressive strength of the large, small and med¬ 
ium cylinder were 3859, 1080 and 8360; the average of 3850 
plus 2360 is 3605. 

Then the adjusted value for the large cylinder is: 

8605 X 100

For the small cylinder: 

2560 I 71 - 1820 psi 

For the medium cylinder: 

2560 X 104 - 2660 psi 

These adjustments were made in order to obtain a better 
value for the concrete strength, especially for the small 
cylinders* The values for the other two cylinders did not 
change greatly* 

Table No* 4 

Table No. 4 gives the mean values for the differ¬ 
ent curing cycles as computed from Table No. 3. 

Table No* 5 

Table No. 5 gives the mean values for the moist¬ 
ure contents as obtained from Table No. 2. The table also 
gives the strength gain in per cent of the cylinders that 
were moist cured and air cured after steaming over cylinders 
that were broken immediately after steam curing. Values were 
obtained by computations from Table No. 4. Strength gain 
values were computed in the following manner: From Cycle 
No. 1 at 135 degrees Fahrenheit, Table No. 4; strength 
value for large cylinder steam cured then broken is 73 per 
cent and the value for large cylinder steam cured, then 
moist cured for 6 days and cured in laboratory air for 7 
days is 133 per cent; therefore gain - (133 - 73) per cent 
Z 60 per cent. The table gives only the strength gain values 
for the per centage based on the large cylinder.

Graphs 

Graphs No. 1 to No. 12 are plotted from the values 
in Table No. 4. 

Graphs No. 13 to No. 21 are graphs of the various 
steaming cycles. They show the temperature of the kiln 
air and temperature of the large, small and medium sized 
cylinders during the curing cycle. The temperatures were 
taken at the centres of the cylinders. 

Graph No. 22 shows the temperature variations to 
which mixes No. 10 and 11 were subjected. These two cycles 
were not run intentionally but were due to a break down in 
the equipment supplying the air to the kiln and regulator 
valve. 

Graph No. 23 is a plot of the water cement ratio 
vs. the compressive strength. Graph No. 24 is a plot of 
the moisture contents vs. the compressive strengths.

Discussion 

The experimental steam kiln as constructed for 
this investigation worked very well. It was possible to 
control the temperature and to produce almost any type of 
curing cycle. The kiln atmosphere had a high relative 
humidity value, A commercial steam curing kiln would not 
be quite so easy to construct as the one used in this 
investigation. In the investigation steam, air and water 
were put into the kiln in quantities that gave reasonable 
assurance that the required atmosphere would be obtained. 

With a commercial kiln this practice would not be economical. 
It would be necessary to obtain the services of a qualified 
engineer to decide on the proper amounts of steam, air and 
water necessary for the particular curing kiln. He would 
also have to specify the size of plant required to produce 
the necessary amount of steam and the size of the other 
equipment. 

The curing kiln used in this investigation prod¬ 
uced the required high relative humidity atmosphere. This 
was shown by the wet and dry thermocouple hydrometer and 
also in Table No. 1 showing the weight variations during 
the curing cycle. The weight of the cylinder increased when 
the curing cycle was started, indicating that the cylinder 
was taking up moisture. The weight variations did not become 
negative until the end of the cycle, and in some cases did 
not become negative even at the end of the cycle. There are 
not enough weight variation readings to give any quantitive

conclusions. A continous observation of the weight varia¬ 
tions would have been more desireable. I believe a device 
could be constructed quite easily to take continous observa¬ 
tions of the weight variations. A spring balance could be 
used and if a pen were attached to the spring balance the 
variations could be recorded on a drum which turned very 
slowly. This drum could be run from, a pully attached to the 
cam in the remote control mechanism. 

It must be realized that the weight variations 
include the weight of the moisture which is condensed upon 
the concrete specimen and upon the scale pan. This fact 
should not greatly change the conclusions reached from the 
weight variations readings. A correction factor might be 
determined to eliminate this effect. If moisture is being 
condensed during the curing cycle, it means that the kiln 
atmosphere must have a very high relative humidity; also, 
if moisture is being condensed upon the concrete specimen, 
there is probably enough moisture present for the proper 
hydration of the cement. 

It would be interesting to run a series a tests 
without introducing extra water, or air, or both into the 
kiln during the curing cycle. That is, allow only steam, 
steam and air or steam and water to enter the kiln. An 
investigation of this nature would be more liable to bring 
out the actual importance of the theory discussed under 
"Thermodynamics of Steam Curing”.

It is of the author's opinion that a little too 
much stress was put on the thermodynamics of steam curing 
as laid down in the beginning of this report. This opinion 
is based on the fact that the different curing cycles did 
not greatly affect the concrete strengths. It was stated 
in the first part of the report that Cycle No. 3 would be 
more or less of an ideal cycle. This was not the case in 
a number of instances. That is, Cycle No. 1 produced concrete 
strengths greater than Cycle No. 3. The idea of Curing 
Cycle 3 was to keep the cylinder temperature just below the 
kiln air temperature; thus the resulting vapor pressures 
within the cylinder would be less than the vapor pressure 
of the kiln air, with the result that moisture would move 
from the kiln air into the concrete block. The benefits of 
Cycle No. 3 might show up more readily when the kiln is 
operated without the introduction of extra water, or air 
or both into the kiln. In our investigation the relative 
humidity was so high that possibly the benefit gained from 
using Curing Cycle No. 3 was lost. However, one should 
not ignore the Importance of thermodynamics in steam curing 
but probably its importance was stressed a little too much 
in this report. 

In Table No. 3 it was found that on the average 
the small cylinders had a strength value of 71 per cent of 
the large cylinders and the medium cylinders had a strength 
value of 104 per cent of the large cylinders. (This is for the

moist cured cylinders),. The 71 per cent value for the 
small cylinder certainly does not follow from the exten¬ 
sive investigation made by the Bureau of Reclamation (16) 
regarding the effect of cylinder size on the compressive 
strength of concrete. Using the results from this invest¬ 
igation, the comparative percentages should be 108.7 per 
cent for the small cjrlinder and 104 per cent for the medium 
sized cylinder. The low value found for the small cylinder 
was probably due to the method used to compact the concrete 
in the molds. The cylinders were compacted so as to give 
each unit volume of concrete the same compactive effort, 
with the result that the small cylinder received 10 blows 
from a three pound hammer, the medium cylinder received 50 
blows from a 5 pound hammer and the large cylinder received 
176 blows from, a 5 pound hammer. The vibrational effect 
caused by the increased number of blows the large cylinder 
received probably caused the large cylinder to be compacted 
better than the small cylinder. This explanation does not 
quite follow when the medium sized cylinders are compared 
with the large cylinders, but the difference in the number 
of blows received by large cylinder and the small cylinder 
is greater than the difference between the large cylinder 
and the medium cylinder. The large cylinder received about 
18 times the number of blows given to the small cylinder 
and only about 3§ times the number of blows given to the 
medium cylinder. If another investigation is to be carried 
out using dry mixes, it might be adviseable to use a vib-

ration machine to compact the cylinders instead of using a 
tamping device. 

The tamping probably caused the large variations 
found in the strength values of the small cylinder. Be¬ 
cause of this large variation, too much reliance should not 
be put on the conclusions reached from the strength values 
of the small cylinders. To eliminate the effect of tamp¬ 
ing and vibration altogether, a wet mix might be used instead 
of a dry mix when investigating the effect of steam curing 
upon the different cylinder sizes. 

To make the discussion of the different graphs 
etc. more readable, symbols will be used for references to 
the different curing methods, as follows: 

M C - refers to the cylinders which were cured in 
the moist room for seven days, then tested. 

S24 - refers to the cylinders which were steam cured 

and then tested immediately after the steaming 
cycle was complete. 

S67 - refers to the cylinders which were steam cured, 

then moist cured for six days, cured in the 
laboratory air for seven days and then tested. 

SLA - refers to the cylinders which were steam cured, 
then cured in the laboratory air for thirteen 
days and tested: 

In regard to Table III, it should be noticed that 
the M C strengths are all higher after Mix No. 10. It was 
necessary to use a new batch of cement after Mix No. 10

and this fact probably caused the discrepency. Also there 
is quite a variation in strengths between the different 
mixes. To eliminate these factors all the strength values 
were reduced to per centages. The reduction of the strengths 
to per centages does not, however, eliminate all the errors. 
More reliable results could have been obtained had a much 
larger number of cylinders been broken. The investigation 
does not warrant a quantitative discussion, but a qualit¬ 
ative discussion is permissible. 

Referring to G-raphs No, 1 and 7 of Curing Cycle No, 1 

For the medium and large sized cylinders, for 
maximum S24 strengths, a temperature of 160 degrees is the 
best, but for the S67 and SLA strengths the best temper¬ 
atures are 135 degrees and 160 degrees. The temperature 
of 185 degrees Fahrenheit was detrimental in all cases. 

The largest gain in strength between the S24 and S67, SLA 
cylinders occured at 135 degrees Fahrenheit, next was the 
160 degree temperature and the least gain in strength was at 
185 degrees Fahrenheit. For the small cylinders temper¬ 
atures of 160 and 185 degrees were detrimental as far as 
the S67 and SLA strengths are concerned. However, for the 
S24 strengths there is not a great deal of difference be¬ 
tween the different temperatures, but a temperature of 
135 degrees Fahrenheit is somewhat better than, the other 
two temperatures for the small cylinders,. 

Referring to Graph No, 2 and 8 of Curing Cycle No. 2 

The temperature of 185 degrees Fahrenheit seems

to be the best temperature. This is contrary to the results 
of cycle number one, but with cycle number two the tempera¬ 
ture rose very slowly to up to 185 degrees Fahrenheit and the 
kiln was at that temperature for only a short time. The 
S24 strengths are higher for the 185 degrees Fahrenheit 
and lower for the other two temperatures, 155 degrees Fah¬ 
renheit being the lowest. The gain in strength from the 
S24 to the S67 and SLA seems to follow from Cycle No. I. 

The gain in strength from the S24 to the S67, SLA is the 
greatest for the temperature of 135 degrees Fahrenheit but 
for the temperatures for 160 degrees Fahrenheit and 185 
degrees Fahrenheit the gain in strength is about equal. 

Since the S24 strengths at 185 degrees Fahrenheit were 
greater, this would make the S67 and the SLA strengths 
greater at a temperature of 185 degrees Fahrenheit than at 
a temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit. It is probable 
that the rate of gain of strength was not greatly affected, 
but that the final amount of gain was affected between the 
two temperatures of 165 degrees and 185 degrees Fahrenheit. 

If long-time tests were made, it is probable that the temp¬ 
erature of 135 degrees Fahrenheit would give the greatest 
strength, 160 degrees Fahrenheit the next and 185 degrees Fah¬ 
renheit the least final strength value. This fact agrees 
with finding of other investigators, who have reported, that 
the final concrete strength is reduced through the use of 
steam curing.

Referring to Graphs No. 5 and 9 of Caring Cycle No. Ill 

In Cycle No* 3 the S24 strengths do not vary 
greatly with the temperature. However, the gain in strength 
between the S24 and the S67, SLA decreases with increasing 
temperatures. Cycle No. 3 differs from Cycle No. 1 in 
that the S24 strengths of Cycle No. 3 are not reduced at 
185 degrees Fahrenheit as they were in Cycle No. 1. This 
is probably due to the slow rise to temperature as compared 
with the quick rise to temperature of Cycle No. 1. 

From the discussion so far one might say: (1) 

The rate and amount of strength gain after steam curing 
is decreased with increased curing temperatures; (2) The 
detrimental effects of high temperatures are somewhat 
abated when the rate of temperature rise is considerably 
reduced and the high temperatures are maintained for only 
short periods of time. 

Referring to Graph Nos* 4 to 6 and 10 to 12 Comparing 

the Different Curing Cycles 

It is rather difficult to pick out the best cur¬ 
ing cycle as there are a number of factors that must be 
taken into consideration. The main object in steam curing 
is to obtain high early strengths but in doing so one must 
not disregard the long-time strength of the concrete. 
Therefore, when trying to pick the best cycle from the 
cycles used in this report, one must put considerable stress 
on the strength values for the S24 cylinders without dis¬ 
regarding the strength values for the S67. It must be

remembered also that cycles affect the three sizes of 
cylinders in a somewhat different manner. It would be 
desireable to pick a curing cycle which gives good results 
for all three cylinder sizes. 

Cycles No. 1 and 3 at 185 degrees Fahrenheit 
are eliminated because of the detrimental effect of the high 
temperature upon the concrete. Another cause for their 
elimination is the economics of running a kiln at such a 
high temperature. 

Cycle No. 2 at 135 degrees Fahrenheit and 160 
degrees Fahrenheit is eliminated because of the low S24 
strength values at these temperatures. The small cylinder 
showed favorable strength values at 160 degrees Fahrenheit 
using Cycle 2, but the other two cylinder sizes did not. 

To eliminate Cycle No. 2 at 185 degrees Fahren¬ 
heit is a little more difficult. For the large cylinder 
the S24 strengths were below the S24 strengths for the 
other two cycles run at the two lower temperatures, but for 
the other two cylinder sizes the S24 strength was greatest 
for Cycle No. 2. For the medium sized cylinder, Cycle No. 1 
at 160 degrees Fahrenheit has S24 strengths comparable to 
Cycle No. 2 at 185 degrees Fahrenheit. When the S67 and 
SLA strengths are considered, Cycles 1 and 3 are better than 
Cycle 2 at 185 degrees Fahrenheit. 

To make a choice between the remaining cycles is 
hardly warranted in this investigation. The 135 degrees 
Fahrenheit temperature seems to give the best results for

the small cylinders while the 165 degrees Fahrenheit tem¬ 
perature gives the best results for the large cylinder with 
the medium cylinders coming inbetween these two temperatures. 

From the discussion on cycles the following con¬ 
clusions are justified: 

(1) The type of curing cycle does affect the concrete 
strengths to a certain extent, but the temperature 
at which the curing cycle is run is a more imp¬ 
ortant factor. One type of cycle may give good 
results when operated at one temperature and an¬ 
other type of curing cycle may give good results 
when operated at another temperature. 

(2) For better results, lower temperatures should be 
employed for smaller sized specimens. 

Referring to G-raphs No. 7 to 12 
Another item to be noticed in these graphs is the 
relative positions of the lines indicating the strength 
values of the large, medium and small cylinders. In the 
majority of cases the highest strength value is found in 
the small cylinder, the next strength value in the medium 
cylinder, and the lowest in the large cylinder. This would 
indicate that the beneficial results of steam curing increase 
as the size of the concrete specimen decreases. This fact 
is also indicated in the average values as computed in Table 3. 

On comparing the S67 and SLA strengths in the 
graphs, one finds that there is not much advantage in moist 
curing after steam curing. This factor is again emphasized

when the averages in Table 3 are compared. A 5 to 10 per 
cent gain in strength is all that is obtained in the maj¬ 
ority of cases. In a number of cases the SLA strengths 
were above the S67 strengths. This could be due to exper¬ 
imental errors and the fact that the SLA cylinders were 
in a drier condition when tested. 

Referring to G-raph No. 24 of the Moisture Contents 

For the MC and 324 points plotted on the graph 
there is a trend indicating that the lower moisture contents 
gave the higher compressive strengths. This follows what 
a number of investigators have found out. However, for 
the S67 and SLA, the trend is in the other direction. It 
would be very difficult to reach any conclusions from the 
moisture content evaluations because of the large number of 
other factors entering into the picture. The different 
steam curing cycles, different temperatures, different 
water cement ratios, variations in concrete strengths and 
errors in laboratory technic all enter into the graph, 
making it very difficult to draw any conclusions. In 
nearly all cases the smaller the cylinder was, the drier 
the concrete. 

The results from Mix No. 10 and Mix No. 11 bring 
out another interesting point. 

From the results of Mix No. 10 it would seem that 
adverse curing conditions at the end of the curing cycle 
do not affect the compressive strength of the concrete. 

From the results of Mix No. 11 it would seem that adverse 
curing conditions occurring throughout the curing cycle

do considerably reduce the concrete strength. These con¬ 
clusions, although they seem very plausible, should not be 
made definit until more results of this nature are obtained. 


Conclusions 

One of the main objects of this investigation 
was to build a suitable laboratory steam curing kiln. The 
steam kiln as built worked very well and fulfilled the 
requirements as stated on page 20. The conclusions reached 
from the remainder of the investigation must be necessarily 
restricted because of the relatively small number of cylinders 
made and tested. The conclusions reached from this invest¬ 
igation, concerning steam curing of concrete at atmospheric 
pressures, and employing a system having a high relative 
humidity value are: 

(1) . Reasonably high early concrete strengths are 

obtained. 

(2) . The rate and amount of strength gain after steam 

curing are decreased with increased steam curing 
temperatures. 

(3) . The detrimental effects of high temperatures 

are abated when the rate of temperature rise is 
very slow and the high temperatures are not 
maintained for long periods of time. 

(4) . The type of curing cycle employed does affect

but the temperature at which the curing cycle 
is run is a more important factor.

Suggestions for Other Investigations on the Effect 

of Steam Curing Upon Concrete 

1* A more intensive investigation similar to the one 

carried out in this report. The curing cycles should 
be run at four or five different temperatures and the 
effect of not introducting air, extra water or both 
into the kiln could be investigated. 

2 • Effect of steam curing upon the durability of concrete. 

3. Effect of steam curing upon the modulus of rupture and 

modulus of elasticity of concrete. 

4. Effect of steam curing upon different concrete mixes* 

5. Effect of steam curing upon the long time strengths of 

concrete. 

6. Effect of steam curing upon airentrained concrete. 

7. Effect of different admixtures upon steam cured concrete.

Introduction 

The demand for precast reinforced concrete units 
is increasing. Precasting is becoming a major factor in 
the choice of reinforced concrete as a construction mat¬ 
erial because of the ever-rising cost of labor and mater¬ 
ials. The advantages of precasting are not, however, con¬ 
fined to savings in cost and materials. Since it is a 
planned method of construction, comparable to factory prod¬ 
uction, its use also assures a better control of quality 
and speedier completion of the project. The units are 
made by mass production methods and, as in the concrete 
block industry, the curing cycle is under critical examin¬ 
ation. To speed the curing cycle steam curing is feas¬ 
ible. While the effect of steam curing upon the concrete 
is being investigated, very little work has been done con¬ 
cerning the effect of steam curing upon the bond strength. 

In connection with high pressure steam curing it was found 
that the bond strength was lowered. No material was 
found on the effect of steam curing at atmospheric pressure 
upon the bond strength. Therefore It was decided to 
carry out a short investigation into the effect of steam 
curing at atmospheric pressures upon the bond between con¬ 
crete and steel. Time was not available for an intensive 
program so this investigation is in the nature of an introd¬ 
uction to give some information on testing procedure, 
difficulties encountered and other pertinant information.

Factors to Be Considered 

Present Knowledge 

Considerable knowledge has been gained regarding 
the bond between concrete and steel; an excellent summary 
is given in Mansfield (2). 

•Some of the main features to be considered in 
the various papers in the bibliography are: 

1. For current concrete mixes, bond resistence does 
not increase in proportion to the strength of the 
concrete. 

2. Bond strength is greater for a dry concrete test 
specimen than for a saturated concrete specimen. 

3* A longer period of moist curing will increase the 
bond strength. 

4. Vibration up to nine hours after pouring is benef¬ 
icial to the total bond which is developed by the 
bars. The reason is probably that vibration reduces 
the water gain which tends to form around the bars. 

5. Up to L - £4, the total bond resistance increase 

D 

with added length of embedment, but beyond 24 
diameters extra embedment develops little added 
resistance. 

Considerable knowledge has been gained concerning 
the physical variations in both the steel and concrete on the 
total bond stress developed, but very little is known re¬ 
garding the effect of steam curing upon bond strength.

Nature of Bond 

All of the investigations show that bond strength 
can be separated into two distinct elements, adhesive resi¬ 
stance and sliding resistance. The true action of the adhe¬ 
sive resistance is not fully understood but it must be over¬ 
come before the sliding resistance comes into effect. The 
sliding resistance comes into effect after the bar has 
started moving and it is probably due to the irregularities 
in the surface of the bar moving past the corresponding 
deformations in the concrete. The sliding resistance or 
maximum bond strength is nearly always higher than the 
adhesive resistance. In practice the adhesive resistance 
is the most important because once the adhesive resistance 
is overcome the deflections in the structure become excessive. 
Measuring Bond Strength 

In investigations of this nature the pull-out test 
is nearly always used. The pull-out test will give the best 
relative results. That is, variations in bond strength due 
to the different methods of curing will show up quite read¬ 
ily. The bond strength obtained in this manner will not be 
the actual values of bond strength gained in practice but 
will be very close to the proper values. In the computations 
of bond strength, the bond is assumed to be uniformly dist¬ 
ributed throughout the full length of embedment. Also, in 
pull-out tests an arbitrary value of total slip of the bar 
(usually about 0.0001 inches) is taken to indicate the over-

coming of adhesive resistance. Thus we can see that the bond 
strength found in this manner is only approximately correct 
but the relative values found are accurate. 

Thermodynamic Considerations 

The thermodynamic considerations will be similar 
to Part 1, However, a difference might occur because of 
having the steel exposed while curing. The thermal conduct¬ 
ivity of concrete is approximately 14 BUT per hour per square 
foot per fahrenheit degree temperature difference per inch 
thickness and the thermal conductivity of the reinforcing 
bar is about 430 BTU per hour per square foot per fahren¬ 
heit degree difference per inch thickness. From this inform¬ 
ation one can see that the steel will conduct more heat 
than the concrete. Now if the steel is exposed as it is in 
an ordinary pull-out test specimen, the concrete surround¬ 
ing the steel will have a higher temperature than for example 
the concrete half way between the steel and the outside of 
the test specimen. This difference in temperature will 
cause the concrete surrounding the steel to lose moisture 
(as discussed in Part 1). When the moisture movement is 
taken into consideration, will there be enough moisture left 
for hydration? This effect is counter-balanced by the area 
of steel and area of concrete exposed. The area of concrete 
exposed will be much larger than the area of steel. This 
will affect the curing mostly during the heating cycle. 

W 7 hen a constant temperature in the kiln is reached the

resulting temperature differences will not be great, and 
as long as the relative humidity of the kiln air is high, 
sufficient moisture will be present for hydration. (This 
has been more fully discussed in Part 1). From the above 
discussion one might conclude that the exposure of the steel 
to the kiln atmosphere will have little effect upon the 
resulting concrete and bond strengths as compared to having 
the steel covered or enclosed within the concrete unit. 

Other Items 

To predict from theoretical considerations the 
effect of steam curing upon bond strengths would be diff- 

If*' 

icult since true nature of the bonding action of concrete 
to steel is not known. The water gain m ay be affected by 
steam curing since steam curing seems to have considerable 
effect upon the moisture movement and moisture content of 
the block. Water gain is a phenomenon that is evidenced by 
the moisture sheen that gathers, soon after casting, at 
the surface of even stiff mixes*, Water gain is apparent 
visually on the mortar bed below any horizontal bar. Where 
water gain occurs, the bond strength is reduced. This 
effect can be overcome somewhat by using pull-out specimens 
which are cast vertically. 

The effect of steam curing upon the shrinkage 
of the concrete might affect the resulting bond strength. 

Wig (1) states that the bond strength of intial slip is not 
appreciably affected by shrinkage during curing, but that

Laboratory Equipment 

1« Curing Kiln 

The curing kiln used in this investigation was 
the same one that was used in the investigation of the 
Effect of Steam Curing upon Concrete and it has been fully- 
described in Part 1 of this report. To place the pull¬ 
out test specimen in the kiln, it was necessary to remove 
the racks from the kiln. 

2. Mixer 

The mixer used in this investigation was a lj- 
cubic foot Lancaster, type - S.K.G-. Serial No. 305, man¬ 
ufactured by Volta Manufacturing Company Limited of Well¬ 
and, Ontario* See Figure (126), page (103). 

5. Load Testing Machine 

The testing machine used was a Baldwin South- 
work Tate-Emery Testing Machine. The testing machine had 
three loading ranges - 0 to 10000 pounds, 0 to 50000 pounds 
and 0 to 20,000 pounds. The machine was accurate to 
about 0.25 per cent. 

See Figures (11a) and (lib), page (102). 

4» Moist Hoorn 

The moist room was a small 10 by 10 by 3 room lined 
with cement plaster. Shelves and racks were provided with¬ 
in the moist room to hold the test specimens. The atmos¬ 
phere within the moist room was kept at a high relative 
humidity and at a constant temperature of 70 degrees Fahren¬ 
heit .

Mix Design 

It was decided to use a concrete mix similar to 
a mix that was used in another investigation being carried 
on at the same time. Theoretically, this mix should have 
given a water cement ratio of 0.50 and a slump of 3 inches. 
Below is a table giving the design mix and the mixes 
actually obtained. The weights are for a 200 pound batch 
of concrete.

Laboratory Procedure 

Since many different factors affect the bond 
between concrete and steel to ascertain the effect of steam 
curing upon the bond all the other factors but the steaming 
must be kept constant. That is, there should be no inherent 
differences in the test specimens other than the fact that 
some are steam cured and others are not. This factor was 
kept in mind during the laboratory work. 

The aggregates were prepared twenty four hours 
before the concrete was mixed. This preparation consisted 
of mixing them thoroughly with water in order to obtain uni¬ 
form moisture content past the saturated surface dry con¬ 
dition. The different aggregates were then put in indiv¬ 
idual containers and covered with a damp sack. A sample 
of each of the three aggregates was taken for moisture 
content computations. The samples were dried for twenty- 
four hours in the drying oven. 

At mixing time the proper amounts of materials 
were weighed out and put into the mixer. A sample for mois¬ 
ture content computations was again taken in order to 
ascertain the actual moisture content at the time of mixing. 
This enabled us to know the actual batch quantities that 
went into the mixer. (See Mix Design, page (109).) 

The mixing time was held constant at one minute 

dry mixing and five minutes wet mixing. 

Immediately after mixing a slump test was carried 


out

Next the test specimens were poured. The steel 
mold and its base plate were clamped on the stand (Figures 
(12a) and (12), pages (103) and (104)) and the steel bar 
made perpendicular. The concrete was poured in three layers, 
each layer being rodded twenty-five times. The procedure of 
clamping the mold on the stand proved cumbersome when a 
relatively large number of test specimens was poured and was 
not used. The stand proved very effective when only a few 
test specimens were to be poured. When the stand was not 
used, a ruler was taken to make certain that the steel bar was 
perpendicular to the base plate. A spacer (Figure (13), 
page (104)) was inserted at the bottom of the mold. In the 
centre of this spacer was a hole one inch in diameter. This 
allowed the steel bar to protrude one-eighth of an inch past 
the bottom of the concrete. (See Figure (13), Page (104). 

The test specimen consisted of a six-inch diameter 
concrete cylinder, eleven and seven-eighths inches high, with 
a steel bar one inch in diameter running longitudinally 
through the concrete cylinder. The steel bar protuded 14 
inches from one end and one-eighth of an inch from the other 
end. 

After the test specimens were poured they were 
left to stand in the laboratory air for five hours and then 
put into the steam kiln. At all times the test specimens 
were kept in a vertical position. 

During fabrication of the test specimens, thermo¬ 
couples were placed in two of the specimens. Two thermo-

couples were placed in each of the two test specimens, one 
thermocouple against the steel and the other midway be¬ 
tween the surface of the steel and the outside surface of 
the concrete cylinder. The thermocouples were placed 
about mid-height of the concrete cylinder. See Figure (13), 
page (104). 

When the five-hour waiting time had elasped some 
of the test specimens were placed in the moist room and 
others placed in the steam kiln for steaming. The steel 
in two of the specimens placed in the kiln was covered "(as 
shown in Figure (14), page (105). One of the covered steel 
test specimens contained thermocouples and one specimen 
with the steel exposed to the kiln air contained thermocouples. 
The thermocouples were attached to the Brown Recorder and

Testing Procedure 

Two sets of 12 test specimens were made. In 
each set, four were put into the moist room for testing at 
7 days and at 28 days after casting. The remaining eight 
test specimens were steam cured; two of these had the steel 
covered and the remaining had the steel exposed to the kiln 
air. Of the ones that were steam cured, two were tested 
after being removed from the steam kiln; two were put into 
the laboratory air for 1-3 days and then tested; the two 
covered steel test specimens and the last specimens were 
cured in the moist room for six days then in the laboratory 
air for seven days, then tested. This was repeated for the 
second set, giving a total of four specimens tested for each 
curing method. 

The pull-out tests were carried out using the 
testing machine. Ifter the machine was adjusted for the 
pull-out tests, the test specimen was put into it. A 
layer of plaster of paris was applied to the cross arm of 
the testing machine and then test specimen seated in the 
plaster of paris. A:load of 150 pounds was applied to the 
steel bar and this load was left on until the plaster of 
paris had set (about 45 minutes). Thi3 procedure allowed 
the load to be evenly distributed across the face of the 
concrete and allowed for any eccentricities that arose in 
the fabrication of the test specimen. 

An Ames dial was fixed to the other end of the 
bar to enable us to observe the load when the intial slip

had occored. When a slip of 0.0001 inches had occured, 
the load was recorded and this was taken as the load to 
overcome the adhesive resistance. The load was applied 
at a constant rate of 10,000 pounds per minute. (See 
Figures (11) and (14), pages (102) and (105). 

After the bar had been pulled out of the concrete 
cylinder, the cylinder was tested to obtaih the concrete 
strength. 

Samples of the concrete were taken for moisture 
content computations. The results from these tests are 
tabulated in Table (6), page (115).

Discussion of Results 

One result indicated by this investigation is 
that it would be desirable to carry out a more inten¬ 
sive research program on the effect of steam curing at 
atmospheric pressure upon the bond between concrete and 
steel. Any conclusions reached from this investigation 
must be restricted because of the small number of tests. 

The tests do show that steam curing has an effect upon the 
bond strength. 

Referring to the graph of bond strength vs. days 
curing on page (116), the bond strength for the test spec¬ 
imens tested immediately after the steaming cycle was 
completed had about three-quarters the bond strength of 
the test specimens tested after seven days moist curing, 
and about half the bond strength of the specimen tested 
after twenty-eight days moist curing. Comparing the test 
specimens broken after steam curing and the ones broken 
after steam curing plus thirteen days curing in the labor¬ 
atory air, it can be seen in the graph that there was little 
gain in bond strength when the test specimen was cured in 
the laboratory air after the steam curing. For the test spec¬ 
imens steam cured, moist cured for 6 days, cured in the 

laboratory air for 7 days, then tested, the bond strengths 
were 10 to 15 per cent higher than the test specimens moist 
cured for 28 days. It would seem that the ultimate bond 

strength can be increased by steam curing, provided moist 

curing is continued after the steam curing period. This,

of course, is not feasible in a plant which employs steam 
curing methods. A plant operator does not want to steam 
cure and moist cure the same unit. The cost of operating 
the plant would be increased, thus increasing the cost of 
the reinforced concrete unit. 

The effect upon the concrete strengths of moist 
curing after steam curing was entirely different from the 
effect upon the bond strengths. There was little difference 
in the concrete strengths of the cylinders, which were 
moist cured after steam curing and those which were put 
into the laboratory air after steam curing. At fourteen 
days, both the concrete cylinders showed strengths con¬ 
siderably higher than the corresponding cylinders moist 
cured for fourteen days. This shows that where high bond 
strength is an important item in the design it might be 
necessary to continue moist curing after steam curing to 
increase the bond strength, but this would not be necessary 
if increased concrete strengths were desirable. 

In Table (6) the allowable bond strengths to be 
used in reinforced concrete design were computed according 
to the formulae given in the C.E.S.A. code. In all cases 
the actual bond strengths found were above the values 
computed for the allowable bond strengths, although in some 
cases the factor of safety is low.

was employed. It is possible that other steaming cycles 
and temperatures might affect the bond strengths one way 
or the other but it is the author’s opinion that this would 
not greatly affect the bond strengths unless extreme tempera¬ 
tures and very adverse steam curing cycles were employed. 

Having the steel exposed to the steam did not 
seem to affect the bond strength or the strength of the 
concrete. The bond at intial slip was about 5 to 10 per 
cent greater when the steel was covered, but the maxim¬ 
um bond strength was 5 to 10 per cent less. Since the 
actual results themselves are probably in error by this 
amount, the above differences are not significant. 

From an examination of the individual results in 
Table (6), page (115), it can be seen that there is con¬ 
siderable variation, in some instances, from the mean. 

This is probably due to experimental error and defects in 
the test specimens themselves. If a larger number of test 
specimens could have been made, a better value could have 
been established. The variations in the bond strength at 
intial slip are somewhat greater than the variations in 
the maximum bond strengths. This is because it is difficult 
to observe the true load at the intial slip. Probably a 
slower rate of loading should have been used. This factor 
was considered after a good number of tests had been 
carried out, but was not followed as it did not seem advis¬ 
able to bring another variation into the tests. The tests 
were all carried out at the same loading rate.

All the concrete strengths were based on values 
obtained by loading the concrete cylinder after the rein¬ 
forcing bar had been pulled out. There is some doubt 
about the effect of the hole in the centre of the cylinder 
upon the final result. Visual inspection of the hole 
showed no deformation of concrete in the immediate area 
around the hole. When the cylinders failed under the load, 
the failure seemed indentical to the failure of cylinders 
without the holes. The planes of failure seemed the same 
as one would obtain from an ordinary cylinder. In the 
computations the area of the hole was subtracted from the 
cross-sectional area of the cylinder before the strength 
was found. That is, it was assumed that the hole had no 
effect other than to reduce the cross-sectional area. 

The graph on page (119) shows that there was no 
relationship between the concrete strengths and the bond 
strengths. Most of the higher bond strengths were obtain¬ 
ed with higher concrete strengths, but almost an equal 
number of low bond strengths were obtained with the same 
higher concrete strengths. This follows what a numb er 
of investigators have found out, that bond resistance 
does not increase in proportion to the strength of the 
concrete. 

Not enough moisture contents were obtained to 
warrant conclusion about bond strengths and moisture 
content. 

Th® effect of water gain was not evident in any

of the tests, nor was there any visual evidence of water 
gain. 

An interesting point seems to be brought out in 
the graph of bond strength vs. ratio of intial slip to 
maximum bond. The ratio seems to be increasing as the 
bond strength increases. This is what could be expected 
from a theoretical point of view. This is, the frictional 
resistance (maximum bond strength) has a limit but the 
adhesive resistance can keep on increasing and even pass the 
frictional resistance (Then the adhesive resistance will 
become the maximum bond strength.) Since the true nature of 
bond has not yet been explained, the above statement is only 
speculative.

Conclusions 

1. Steam curing at atmospheric pressure does affect the 
bond between concrete and steel. 

2. It would be desirable to conduct a more intensive 
research program on "The Effect of Steam Curing at Atmos¬ 
pheric Pressures upon the Bond between Concrete and Steel"* 

It seems that to obtain bond strengths comparable to 
the bond after 28 days of moist curing, it is necessary to 
continue moist curing after steam, curing. 

4. Where bond strengths are not an important factor in 
the design, the effect of steam curing upon the bond 
strengths may be ignored. Where bond strengths are a 
fairly important factor, the allowable bond strengths 
should be reduced to increase the factor of safety w.r.t. 
bond strength. 

5. Exposure of the reinforcing bar to the kiln air did 
not have any appreciable effect upon the resulting bond 
strengths.

Other Investigations That Could Be Carried 

Out Concerning Steam Curing and Bond Strengths 

1. A more intensive program along similar lines in order 
to be able to reach more definit and quantitative conclus¬ 
ions. Testing considerable more test specimens and in 
addition testing steam cured specimens at three, seven and 
twenty-eight days after casting, also testing moist cured 
specimens at three and fourteen days after casting. 

2. Effect of different curing cycles and curing temperatures 
upon the bond strengths. 

3. Investigation of the effect of water gain, using beam tests 
and pull-out tests, and testing specimens which are cast 
vertically and horizontally. 

4. Amount of moist curing after steam curing necessary to 
bring the bond strengths up to values comparable to the 
bond strength after 28 days moist curing.
