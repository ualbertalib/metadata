CHAPTER I 


THE PROBLEM, THE METHOD, AND THE POPULATION. 

In view of the widespread opinion among adults that 
some of the cinematographic productions of the present day 
have harmful effects upon children and youths, it seemed 
advisable to endeavor to find out what the latter themselves 
think in the matter. It is possible that what adults condemn 
as suggestive, or obscene, or worthless may seem to young 
people to be merely funny. On the other hand it may be that 
they are quite as much aware as their elders are that things 
are oortraj r ed or suggested on the screen which are considered 
wrong or immoral in the society in which they live. Again it 
may be that children do not believe that what they see in the 
H movies M is real life; they may look upon shows merely as 
interesting stories and be not influenced by them in conduct. 

It may be, however, that either directly or indirectly; either 
consciously or unconsciously, the thinking of children of to¬ 
day is being molded by this recent element in our intricate 
society. Whether the value of that influence is positive or 
negative is a question that ought soon to be decided if govern- 
ments are to retain control of the complete education of child¬ 
ren. This study purports to make a contribution toward that 
end.

This investigation limits its scope to an attempt to 
discover what value children put upon the movies, what kinds 
they prefer, what kinds they do not like, what they think 
are the physical results of attendance at the theatre, in 
what way they think their conduct is influenced by the movies, 
what relation there is between their opinions and their home 
status, and between their replies and their Intelligence 
Quotient; or, in general, to investigate what place the cinema 
does and should have in recreation and education. 

To make an investigation in such a field it was felt 
that a large number of subjects would be necessary in order 
that conclusions might be valid. The personal interview 
method would, therefore, be unsatisfactory for in the time 
available only a few children could have been examined and it 
would be difficult to get results that could be objectively 
scored. For the latter reason also an "essay 1 ' type question¬ 
naire was rejected as a sole source of information. An object¬ 
ive type of questionnaire was finally considered the best meth™ 
od, but in order to make the investigation more thorough it was 
decided to use also an essay type. The latter was given first 
and was followed immediately by the objective questions. It 
was hoped that the essay type would get responses with the 
minimum of suggestion and thus provide a check upon the ans¬ 
wers in the objective type and give some indication of the 
reliability of the results obtained. 

in a further attempt to get trustworthy results, the 
instructions to be given to the children before and during 







3 


the filling out of the forms were carefully worded and kept 
as near to standard as possible. The main emphasis in the 
instructions was on frank answers. It was hoped that thus 
the influence of such opinions as those of relatives, teachers, 
and friends would be reduced to a minimum. 

The principles kept in mind in framing the essay type 
questionnaire were to ask questions that gave free scope for 
expression of personal opinion, to avoid "leading questions", 
and at the same time to keep the responses within limits which 
would be valuable for the purposes of this study. Such a set 
of questions was found in the report of the investigations 
made by The Birmingham Cinema Enquiry Committee (cf. Chp. II), 
but only a few suggestions from it were considered suitable. 

The objective type questionnaire was even more diffi¬ 
cult to prepare, owing to the necessity of avoiding words and 
phrases which the children would not understand or would mis¬ 
interpret. Valuable help in this part of the work was had 
from a similar study conducted by May V. Seagoe and reported 
in the Journal of Juvenile Research for July, 1931 * Compar¬ 
isons of results found In this study with those of Seagoe will 
be presented later. 

In order that reliable results might be obtained it was 
considered inadvisable to give the questionnaires to children 
below Grade VI or above Grade X. It was doubted if children 
younger than that would properly understand and interpret the 
questions, and it was also feared that pupils older than that 
might not give sufficient serious attention to their answers.

The schools in which the questionnaire were to be 
given were chosen with a view to adequate sampling. A cross 
section showing all the social, economic, and educational 
levels was striven for by choosing rooms from schools in 
various districts of both Calgary and Edmonton. Eighteen 
rooms in all were selected, twelve of them from six schools 
in Edmonton and six from four in Calgary. Following is a 
list of the classes to which the questionnaires were given, 
together with the number of pupils in each.

In regard to this table a few comments with regard to 
adequacy of sample are necessary. The fact that the medians 
for the Grades compare closely with the means obtained from 
the Edmonton School Board lends some support to the assumption 

















7 


that the sample is representative. Similar figures for the 
Calgary Schools were not obtained. The similar distributions 
and medians of Grades IX and X reflect the fact that the 
grading system in the High Schools has been supplanted by a 
unit system. As classification in rooms is not by year but 
by courses being taken it is altogether possible that rooms 
questioned as IX and X contained about equal numbers of first- 
year and second-year High School students. With reference to 
age, then, it may be assumed that the sampling is adequate for 
the purposes of this study.

CHAPTER II 


REVIEW OF PREVIOUS STUDIES 

Seagoe , May V., Stanford University. 

The Child’s Reaction to the Movies. 

Reported in The Journal of Juvenile Research, 
July 1931. 

This study was made under the Women's Education 
Club of the University of California for the purpose of 
investigating "the movie and the nature and extent of 
its formative power in the life of the elementary school 
child." 

Eight hundred children in the public schools in 
and near Los Angeles were examined by means of a question¬ 
naire. Grades one and two were interviewed individually, 
but the children of the higher grades filled in their own 
answers. Tabulations were made of results, of compari¬ 
sons with intelligence quotients and with occupation of 
parents; and special consideration was given to certain 
groups, such as conduct problem cases, the well chaperoned 
and those who go alone or with no adult guidance. The 
results are presented in the article by means of graphs, 
and in the form of percentage of choices for each answer 
in the questionnaire.

Parts of the questionnaire used by Seagoe follow, 
with percentages; and for purposes of comparison the percent¬ 
ages found for Alberta children are entered wherever the 
question is the same as or very similar to that used in the 
present study.

The following are the conclusions drawn hy Seagoe: 

H In summary, this study seems to show: 

1. The movie is of almost universal importance 
as a factor in child life. In most families it is 

a weekly institution of great importance to the child. 

2. The child’s preferences in movies show a liking 
for a rapid action and excitement, for laughter, and 
for learning. 

3. The primary appeal of the movie seems to he 
emotional rather than intellectual. 

4. The influence of the movie would appear to be 















11 


capable of modification through chaperonage or guidance. 

5. The increasing independence of parental guidance 
and chaperonage in the early adolescent years indicates 
a need for training in movie selection by some other 
agency. Such independence appears to be greatest among 
those least capable of exercising it wisely, i. e. the 
less intelligent, the behavior problems, and those with 
less money to spend. For such children the need for 
guidance is acute. 

6. The greatest possibility of the movie from the 
educational point of view lies in its social and moral 
influence. Through the emotional appeal of the movie 
attitudes and ideals are generated. The implications 
of this fact for civic training have been not fully ex¬ 
ploited. 

7 . The child movie market is worth cultivating from 
the point of view of the producer. 1 ' 


Birmingham Cinema Enquiry Committee. 

Report of Investigations. 

April, 1930 - May, 1931* 

This investigation, which was lead by the Vice- 
Chancellor of the University of Birmingham, was begun owing 
to dissatisfaction with the prevalent type of film, and was 
pursued in the hope of impressing upon the Home Secretary 
the necessity for the appointment of an impartial committee 
of investigation whose report would form the basis of an 
adeouate reform of. the principles of censorship. Both before 
and after the investigation the men and women making the - en¬ 
quiry felt sure that the cinema can be a "tremendous and in¬ 
exhaustible source of recreation and education", and "an 
instrument of untold good", but they are equally certain that 
the cinema as it Is has evil intellectual, physical, and moral 
effects upon children and adolescents. 

The report is in three sections, the first having refer¬ 
ence to children aged 8 - 14; the second to young people and 
to adults; and the third is a summary of 430 reports made by 
adults of various walks of life on 285 different films.

With regard to frequency of attendance of the 1439 
children examined, the results of the enquiry follow. The 
corresponding percentages for "Los Angeles 1 ' and "Alberta" 
are added for comparison.

In answer to the question 

as to the 

sort of 

picture 


preferred the replies of these children show definitely 
that they prefer the comedy; and after this follow Adventure, 
Cowboy, War, History, Nature, for the boys, and for the girls: 
Adventure, Detective, Love Stories, Nature. Those who made 
the investigation report the. t, "An arresting feature is the 
recurring emphasis upon crime, war, and what they term ’fight¬ 
ing pictures’ and ’frightening pictures'," and give extensive 
lists to show that there are many among both girls and boys 
who find their main delight in the War and Murder type of 
picture; and also that children are emotionally upset for some 
time after seeing a picture that frightens them. Of the 1439 
examined 349 say their sleep is disturbed after attending the 
cinema. 

"What have you learnt from the pictures?" brings forth 
a volume of replies. in a large proportion, in some groups 
rising as high as one-third, the answer is "nothing". The 
report, however, shrewdly observes that this does not mean 









'

that there are no “impressions stored up in the unconscious 
to aopear in later years 1 '. Of the answers given many refer 
to history, nature, geography, peoples of other races and 
nations; an almost equal number refer to moral conclusions 
based on the observation that the villain almost always gets 
caught and that the honest, brave man usually succeeds; but 
there are some who have concluded otherwise--that this world 
must be an unjust one if the cinema pictures are true. 

With regard to the relations between men and women, 
many of the observations reveal prematurely developed curios¬ 
ity and a M worldly-wise*' attitude. The impression received 
from reading their answers is that human affection is identi¬ 
fied with passionate embraces and promiscuity. Furthermore 
there are definite indications that the child mind has been 
fascinated, even if frightened, by deeds of murder and pillage. 
American gangster pictures, especially, have captured their 
imaginations. B/iany report having imitated some of these activ¬ 
ities. When the children were asked how the cinema could be 
improved, a good many replies showed that at least some do not 
enjoy the pictures which show killing, Indecency, and fright¬ 
ening scenes. A few say that the pictures are "just right 18 . 

Sections II and III tend to bear out In the replies of 
young people what the first section has already stated. In 
the older youths there is increasing dissatisfaction with the 
lurid and murderous type of picture, a larger demand for stories 
true to life, and an increase In the frequency of attendance. 

The report is a valuable contribution to the subject, 
and no doubt will aid at least somewhat in attaining what Its

Thurstone , L. L., A Scale for Measuring Attitudes 

Toward the Movies. 

Journal of Educational Research, 

Vol. XXII, 1930, p.89. 

"The purpose of this paper is to present a scale for 
measuring attitude toward the Movies and to describe the 
method of its construction". Two hundred fifty-eight opinions 
were collected and then, by twenty-five people who understood 
the method, sorted into eleven piles according as they were 
in favor of or opposed to the Movies. Statistical Methods 
were then used to select the hundred statements which were 
equally spaced along the scale and for which the probable 
error (or Quartile Deviation) of the mean was low. Two hun¬ 
dred people sorted these opinions in such a way that by the 
•'method of paired comparisons" it was possible to select as 
a final attitude scale "forty statements approximately evenly 
spaced on the scale". The forty statements are included in 
the paper with their scale values. The opinion highest on 
this scale is number 27'* "The movies are the most powerful 
influence for good in American Life". Two others very high 
on the scale are: “The Movies are the best civilizing force 
ever developed"; and "The Movie is one of the greatest insti¬ 
tutions for common people". The statement lowest in the scale 
(i. e. expressing greatest disapproval) is number 15: "It is 
a sin to go to the movies '. Another very low one is: "The 
Movies are the most important single influence for evil". "Any 















15 


individual's attitude is measured by the average or mean 
scale value of the statements" with which he agrees. 

Abbott , Mary Allen, A Study of the Motion Picture 

Preferences of the Horace Mann High Schools. 
Teacher’s College Record. Vol. XXXVIII, p.819- 

A study of the preferences and attitudes with respect 
to the movie® which the children of these schools had seen 
revealed a good deal of interesting comment. The paper in¬ 
cludes many of these comments on individual movies. 

in general the author concludes that the “reasons 
the,t guide Horace Mann boys and girls in disliking a film 
are these: lack of a good story or good acting and presence 
of exaggeration, too much love or too much pathos or too much 
comedy". "The girls were furious in their denunciation or 
■'cheap' 1 or "vulgar" or "silly" comedy, and the boy® unite in 
their indifference to films in which a girl heroine figures 
in a story of modern romance". Boys and girls both demand 
"action, plot and suspense", but boys seem more inclined than 
girls to judge a screen play on the basis of its merits as 
dramatic and technical art. 

Motion Picture R esearch C ouncil 

Reported in Mcdall T s Magazine 

for September, October, and November, 1932. 

This council was assisted financially by the Payne Fund 
to conduct an examination into the effects of films upon child¬ 
ren and adolescents. Their full report is to be published 
soon in nine volumes. Three aspects of the study are reported 
in these articles, viz., sleep, health and conduct. 







16 


The study was made in a dozen cities of the United 
States, and included examination of thousands of children, 
adolescents, and adults. The findings as to frequency of 
attendance are even higher than any others here reported. 

They discovered that 20% of a group of 5,000 children at¬ 
tended twice a week, and 5 % attended three times. They 
also report that in an audience of 5,000 in a theatre, 1,700 
were under twenty-one years of age. Of these, 150 were under 
seven, 600 were between seven and fourteen, and 950 were be¬ 
tween fourteen and twenty. Less than 8 % were accompanied by 
their parents, and about 17% by brothers or sisters. 

The studies of sleep were made with every possible 
care as to accuracy and control. A total of 170 children, 
between the ages of eight and eighteen, members of an insti¬ 
tutional home, saw 58 different, unselected programs over a 
neriod of 347 days. By means of delicate instruments attached 
to the beds, careful records were made of the amount of “toss¬ 
ing" done during s.everal nights when no shows were allowed 
them. Then records were made of the same children on nights 
after they had seen movies. Studies of the normal sleep of 
many cases showed that maximum of rest coincides with a cer¬ 
tain amount of tossing. If the child is noticeably more quiet 
or more restless than this norm, sleep is not so recuperative. 
After seeing a show f about 25% of the children were decidedly 
more quiet than they were normally. Of the remainder, the 
boys were 26% more restless, and the girls 14%; and this rest¬ 
lessness is greatest during the early hours when sleep should 













17 


be most sound. Furthermore it was discovered that these 
hours of excessive restlessness are not followed later by 
recuperative slumber. Other studies showed that the same 
results could be obtained by depriving the children of 
three hours sleep per night. It is not only on the follow¬ 
ing night that there is disturbance of sleep; the effects 
can be traced even to the fifth night after. Greater 
frequency of attendance does not make the child less sus¬ 
ceptible to this type of disturbance. 

Another aspect of the study concerned emotional excite¬ 
ment during the show. Galvanometric tests revealed that the 
nine-year-olds were excited the most of all; the sixteen-year- 
olds not so much, and the twenty-year-olds were almost un¬ 
ruffled. Boys were more stirred than girls by danger and con¬ 
flict, and girls more than boys by amorous scenes. When 
viewing pictures that were considered sexually exciting, the 
nine-year-olds were as much affected as were the adults, and 
the sixteen-year-olds twice as much. Other evidence was 
considered sufficient to conclude that when children were 
attended by their parents these emotional effects were not so 
strong. The constant emotional stimulation, say the authors, 
without an outlet is bad for health, represents a deplorable 
mental hygiene situation and might easily contribute generously 
to the habits which are popularly called "nervousness" in 
children. 

The common opinion that the movies are harmful to the 
eyes is not supported by evidence found by this council. They

made experiments with flickering lights and found that there 

were no obvious ill effects, and, therefore, conclude that the 

* 

"movies are not injurious to eyesight". 

The educational value of the motion-picture was inves¬ 
tigated and it was concluded that there was a clear gain of 
knowledge, and that in Grades II and III after seven months 
94.7 % was retained, and the average for all children was 70 ^. 
n A medium such as this is too valuable to be omitted from the 
ranks of principle aids to education". 

There are effects of the movies which are peculiar to 
the transient stage of adolescence, namely, imitation, day¬ 
dreaming and dissatisfaction with their homes. "Sixty-two 
percent of 458 high school boys and girls admitted that they 
imitated the dress and mannerisms of screen stars. Thirty- 
three percent of the same group said that love techniques shown 
on the screen had inspired them to emulation, ^not always 
successful). Sixty-six percent remembered that they had dwelt 
in a world of fantasy; prolonged hours of day-dreaming had 
come to them as a result of the movies. Twenty-two percent had 
become dissatisfied with home and its limitations because of 
the splendors shown on the silver screen." Out of all these, 
however, the adolescent grows, and, when he returns to normal, 
smiles at his former childish attitudes. 

The general conclusion of these studies under the Payne 
Fund is that "excessive movie-going is harmful. Both sleep 
and health are endangered. Children grow abnormally nervous. 
Horror and mystery films do distinct damage. For the rest,

the general run of movies, no hard and fast conclusion can 
be drawn." "The best hygienic regulations for children should 
include, among other things, only infrequent attendance at 
selected types of picture programs." 



CHAPTER III 


THE QUESTIONNAIRES 

The main source of information for this investigation 
was the questionnaire which is here called "objective”. It 
consists of twenty-eight questions, each followed by a num¬ 
ber of answers from which the child was to choose the one 
which was right in his case. How accurately that was done 
is difficult to decide. The criticisms usually levelled 
against questionnaire methods are all possible in this case. 
There were a few cases in which the answers were obviously 
inconsistent, such as those in which all the questions were 
answered by one who never goes to the movies; but, even where 
no obvious inconsistency is present, it is not known to what 
extent the answers are reliable bases for statistical tables. 
It is possible that identical answers would have meanings so 
different that they ought not to be grouped together. 

In order to have some knowledge of the reliability, 
therefore, of this objective test, it was preceded by an 
"essay” type, on which six questions were printed. These are 
the six questions: 

1. What kind of Movies do you like best? 

2. What kind of actors and actresses do you like best? 

3. Have you ever imitated an actor or actress? 

What did you do? 

4. What have you learned from the Movies? 

5. What harmful effects do you think they have? 

6 . How do you think they can be improved?

21 


The answers given to these questions could not be 
analysed objectively either by themselves or in comparison 
with the corresponding Questionnaire replies; but careful 
cross reference showed, except in rare cases, that there 
was at least seeming sincerity on the part of the children 
in attempting to answer, and that where interpretation was 
correct the answers on one questionnaire were in agreement 
with those on the other. One exception was noted: namely 
that morally bad effects of the Movies listed on the essay 
questionnaire did not find reflection in the question on 
ethical teachings in the objective type. Examination of 
these questions, however, in the light of other answers 
showed that the difference lay in interpretation. On the 
essay sheet the question was interpreted to have reference 
to children in general, and, therefore, (in the minds of 
nearly all) did not refer directly to the one answering; but 
the corresponding question was thought to have personal refer¬ 
ence, Possibly this was due to the fact that in the latter 
case the question was preceded by one which asked for a reply 
relating to the child who was writing. This will be dealt 
with more fully in the section dealing with moral effects. 

If all the limitations of the method adopted are 
kept in mind, and stress placed upon tendencies rather than 
upon hard and fast conclusions, the assumption that the data 
is reliable may be granted. 

The complete objective questionnaire follows, with a 
precentage analysis of the replies. Ideally those percentages

should represent the proportions of children "voting” for 
each part, but actually they represent the proportions of 
votes cast for each part. There were numerous cases in 
which the children, in spite of warnings, voted for more 
parts than they should have done. The amount of such dup¬ 
lication is not great enough to invalidate the results.

Prom these data some general observations may be made. 

An estimate of the influence of the cinema in the lives of 
children may be made from the facts that 42% prefer going to the 
movies to either reading a book or playing games, 36 % go once 
a week, and over 8 % go more often. Over 27 % would go oftener 
if they could find time, and 26 % would if they or their parents 
could afford the expense. A further indication of the popu¬ 
larity of the films is the fact that 57 % of the boys and 20^ 
of the girls, in their own opinion at least, earn the money 
to pay their own admissions. 

Out of a population of 671 a total of 493 (i• e. 75 %) 
make 775 complaints of eyestrain, headaches, illness or fears, 
as the result of attending the movies. It should also be 
noted that 25 % are quite certain that none of these effects 
take place. 

Father or Mother usually goes to the Movies with 5 % 
of the boys and 18 % of the girls, while 51 %> of the boys and 
57 % of the girls go with those of their own age and sex; 21 % 
of the boys and 5 % of the girls usually go alone. If it be 



29 


true, as the replies indicate, that children, in 39$ of the 
cases, go as often as other members of the family, and in 
17 $ more often, then children must form a comparatively large 
proportion of the audiences. Three quarters of the children 
say that they themselves choose the shows they attend, and 
half of them make their choice on the basis of their prefer¬ 
ence for the actors. 

Of the complete program offered the long feature pic¬ 
ture is preferred by 39$ of the children, and the comedy by 
24$. With regard to the preferred content the Cowboy picture 
is certainly the favorite. From the girls it gets 34$ of the 
first choices and 16$ of the second choices; and from the boys 
30$ of the firsts and 18$ of the seconds. War pictures get 
16$ of the total votes of the boys, but only 4$ of those of 
the girls; on the other hand Love pictures get 3$ of the votes 
of the boys and 20$ of the girls'. Very few children like 
shows that make them sad or frightened, while 35$ like best 
to see exciting films. Next to excitement they prefer to be 
made to laugh and to be taught. Of all they learn they are 
of the opinion that most of it is in the realm of customs, 
manners and ethics, for these answers together receive 55$ 
of the votes. 

It is gratifying to notice that in over 50$ of the 
cases the reason for preferring a screen actor is that he or 
she is a good actor or actress. Over half of both boys and 
girls have at some time imitated an actor, the boys mostly 
by trying to copy their use of weapons or tools, and the girls 





30 


by pretending to be a movie star. Further light upon the 
influence of their screen friends can be had from an ex¬ 
amination of the lists of favorite actors and actresses. Of 
the actresses the first three places are given to Janet G-aynor, 
Nancy Carroll, and Marie Dressier, though the boys reverse the 
order. More significant, however, is the fact that the boys 
and girls do not agree as to actors. The boys’ choices are 
comedians and cowboy actors, while the girls prefer the "draw¬ 
ing room heroes”. Confirmation of this and other inferences 
is found in the lists of liked and disliked shows. 

Further and more detailed comment will be made in the 
chapter on Analysis of Data, in which many of these answers 
are compared with each other in two-way tables. 

The first five questions on the "essay” questionnaire 
have not been considered for their own sakes in this chapter, 
because of the overlap with the "objective” type. Their chief 
value was to test the accuracy and sincerity of replies on the 
other form. Question-number 6, however, on the essay sheet 
has no parallel in the objective questions, and, since the 
answers to it are considered of value, an attempt is made here 
to summarize them. The question asked was "How do you think 
they (the Movies) can be improved?” 

In the Public Schools a number of opinions were ex¬ 
pressed, chiefly by girls, that the Movies cannot be improved. 
The majority of the children, however, suggested some ways in 
which improvement might be made. The omission of love scenes 
is the change most generally recommended and the suggestion is 






31 


more markedly stressed "by the boys. Evidently very few 
children like murder pictures, for a large proportion of the 
answers from both boys and girls suggested that such shows 
be eliminated. The boys urged more improvements of a mechan¬ 
ical nature connected with the actual presentation of the 
picture on the screen. Both boys and girls think that the 
coloring of all pictures would be an improvement but there is 
a general feeling that this would make the pictures harder on 
the eyes. A number of requests that the actors and actresses 
appear on the stage seem to indicate that even Public School 
children would like to see more actual stage plays rather 
than only films.

Boys 

By showing you parts of 
later life and shows that 
give you education. 

By leaving love scenes out. 

By admitting children 
cheaper. 

They can be improved by 
showing the truth and not 
a fake. 


Girls 

Not having so much love in 
them. 

Not having so much slang 
in them. 

I think a little common sense 
and more comedy would improve 
them. 

I don't think the movies 
need improving. 


In the High Schools a small number of the children 
say that the movies cannot be improved but the great major¬ 
ity think otherwise. The desire to have love scenes elimin¬ 
ated is not as strong as in the lower grades, but it is still 
expressed by a number. These older children feel that the 
movies could be more educational and recommend that the movies 
should portray things that are real. They request that the 
shows be more natural and less imaginary. There are a great 
many statements that the movies would be improved by the elim¬ 
ination of crime and the coarser elements. There is a feeling 
among a few that our pictures should show more of Canada and 
of real life in Canada. This seems to be a genuine desire for 
a truly educational type of picture. 


Answers Typical of the High Schools

CHAPTER IV 


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 

Socio-Economic Status and Intelligence Quotient. 

Before we proceed to the detailed examination of the 
data so far presented it is necessary to indicate two other 
sources of the information which was used in the interpret¬ 
ation of the replies to the questionnaires. 

The first is the Intelligence Quotients of the children 
auestioned. The Superintendents of the Edmonton School Board 
were kind enough to grant access to the files on which are 
recorded the Intelligence Quotients of the children attending 
at the time when the questionnaires were given. From this 
source the Quotients of 380 of the 432 Edmonton children were 
obtained. As this was considered a large enough group for this 
purpose no attempt was made to get similar information from 
Calgary. 

The test used for Grades VI, VII, and VIII was the 
“Multi-mental". According to studies made by W. D. Race under 
the direction of Dr. H. E* Smith correlation between the Stan¬ 
ford revision of the Binet Test and this Multi-mental test is 
as indicated in the following table.

The test used for the High School students was the 
"Otis A”. For two groups of Grade VIII pupils, Race found 
the correlation between Otis and Multi-mental to be as 
follows: 

i. r»r0.66i 0.02 N*322 

ii. r-- +0.58 ? 0.03 N-282 

C. B. Willis, also under the direction of Dr. H. E. Smith, 
correlated Otis scores with Terman scores and found a cor¬ 
relation of 0.70 for 184 children in Grades IX to XII., 

The graphs and tables which follow show the distri¬ 
bution of the scores obtained from the School Board.

The second source of additional information is a 
modification of the Sims Score Card for Socio-Economic Status 
given to 146 of the Edmonton children. As this questionnaire 
was not given in the same session as the movie questionnaires, 
it was impossible to find many of the children in groups large 
enough to justify the Principal of the school granting the 
necessary time. Some, however, from each of the Edmonton 
schools considered in this report were obtained, so the sample, 
though small, is used to reveal whatever tendencies can be dis¬ 
covered. Care was taken in the administration of the question- 
naire in an effort to obtain uniformity of interpretation by 
the children, and each question was made clear before it was 
answered. 

One interesting feature of the results is that the med¬ 
ian for the Edmonton homes is 4.5 points higher than that for 
686 New Haven homes. Though the method of scoring in both 
cases is, as far as can be ascertained, the same one would 
hesitate to conclude that the difference between the medians 
represents a real difference between the socio-economic groups. 
Unfortunately the ratings of no other such groups are avail¬ 
able for comparison. 

As a matter of interest a correlation coefficient be¬ 
tween Socio-Economic Status and Intelligence Quotient was 
obtained for 124 cases in which Multi-mental score and Socio- 
Economic Status were both available. The result was r-*0.04 
±0.06. Were it not for the abnormally high P.E., it might 
be inferred that there is a zero correlation between the two. 





38 


Since other studies have found correlations of +0.25 and even 
higher, it must be concluded that this sample is not adequate 
for treatment by fine statistical methods. 

Following are a graph and a frequency distribution 
table of the ratings discovered.

CHAPTER V 


ANALYSIS OF DATA 

In the present chapter the data so far presented will 
be examined in detail. The method will, in general, be to 
take each of the questions of the "objective" questionnaire 
in order and examine the answers, especially with reference 
to all other data with which they can profitably be comoared. 

The first question has to do with the ranking of the 
movie in order of preference along with reading a book and 
playing games. Taking all the grades together it is obvious 
that the movie certainly takes first place. The figures are 
as follows: 



Boys 

Girls 

Read a book 

26.6 % 

40.2$ 

Go to a movie 

40.9 

41.4 

Play games 

32.5 

17-4 


Girls apparently are, on the whole, almost as fond of reading 
books as they are of going to a show. When the data is sep¬ 
arated according to Grades it is discovered that in Grades VI 
and VII the movie gets nearly 50 % of the votes, but in the 
higher grades the proportion of votes for games by the boys 
and for books by the girls continually increases until in High 
School the movie in both cases is relegated to second place. 

An interesting relation between this order of preference 
and frequency of attendance is shown in the following table. 

The figures indicate percentages of the column totals, which 
are indicated in the table opposite the letter *N*.

From this we see that of those who prefer to read a hook 
38% go to the movies very seldom, 26% go once a week, and less 
than six percent go more often. Of those who prefer to play 
games 451 go very seldom and 21% go once a week. Of those who 
prefer the movie, however, only 9% go very seldom, 54% go once 
a week, and 14% go more often than that. 

A similar comparison between this question and number 4, 
which has reference to physical ailments and nervous fright as 
results of the movie, does not reveal enough to justify includ¬ 
ing the table here; but one important observation may be made. 
Those who prefer the movies supply more than half those who 
declare that the movie has none of these evil effects; those 
who prefer books make most complaints, and those who prefer 
games make least. From this is it fair to infer that the kind

42 


of exercise eyes get in games is a "better preparation for 
going to the movies than is that obtained from reading books? 
The suggestion provides a subject of investigation for opti¬ 
cians . 


A two-way table showing the relation between the parts 
of this question and Intelligence Quotient revealed nothing 
extraordinary. Apparently there is no direct tendency for 
either high or low I. Q. to be associated with any one of the 
preferences. 

The second question asks for the frequency of attendance 
at the movies. These are the results for the whole group 
studied: 


Very seldom 
Once a month 
Twice a month 
Once a week 
Twice a week 
Three times a v/eek 
More than three 

times'a week

These proportions are very nearly the same throughout 
all the grades, except for a slight tendency for the younger 
children more than the older ones to attend once a week or 
more. As the frequency of attendance will be contrasted with 
each part of the questionnaire in turn nothing need be said 
about them here. 

The following table shows the relation between Socio- 


Economic Status and frequency of attendance. 


There are no 





43 


important differences between the sexes so only the totals 
are given.

In this figure the asterisks represent the column 
means, and the line through them might be t ermed a tendency- 
curve. It is not connected with the means of the columns for 
‘very seldom* and 'more than 13 times a month' because those 
columns cannot be given numerical values. If the mean of 
column ' 13 * "be ignored because of low frequency it will be 
seen that there is a distinct tendency for the children from 
the homes high on the Socio-Economic scale to go more often 
than those from homes lower on it. 

Less relation is apparent between frequency of attend¬ 
ance and Intelligence Quotient. Following is a figure showing 
the Public School pupils so distributed. The High School group 


is similar.

46 


From the distributions and means here shown it can be 
seen that there is a slight tendency for the mean Intelligence 
Quotient to drop with increasing attendance. Seagoe (cf. Chap¬ 
ter II) found that inferior children were more fond of the 
movies; and this study would tend to bear out that conclusion 
unless it be contended that the number of cases is not large 
enough to give signif icance to the d rop of the mean in the M 13 1 * 
column. However, the drop of the mean from 108 in the 11 2 M 
column to 104 in the M 8 M , would lend some supoort to the re¬ 
liability of the depressed curve in the higher frequencies. 

Question three asks why the children do not attend 
oftener. The distribution of answers for the group follows. 


My church or parents think it is 

wrong 

Boys 

12.1$ 

Girls 

5 - 9 % 

My parents cannot afford to give 

me the money 

29.0

9-5 

8.8 

I am not allowed to go alone 


5.0 

12.1 

I cannot find time 


26.2 

30.0 


All these reasons lose their deterring force in the 
higher grades, except the last. In Grade VI it gets 10$ of 
the votes while in the High School it gets 4o$. It is dif¬ 
ficult to understand why the first is a greater deterrent 
with boys than with girls. 

Comparison with frequency of attendance reveals that 
of those who go very seldom 40$ do not go oftener because 
they do not like the movies very well. It is possible that 
this is a case of “sour grapes”, for of those who go once 
a week or more the only important deterring factors are time 




































47 


and money. This is reflected again in the contrast with 
Socio-Economic Status. In the higher class homes time is 
the most important limiting factor, while in the lower ones 
lack of money and dislike are the largest. 

The fourth question asked if the children felt any 
illness or nervousness after attending the movies. Of 671 
pupils, only 75^ report that such is the case with them, but 
these make nearly two complaints each, most of which consists 
of pains in the eyes and head. There are no great differences 
between the grades; and between the boys and girls the only 
noticeable difference is that a larger proportion of the boys 
report sleeplessness as a result. This introspective report 
agrees with the mechanical measurements of “tossing" made by 
the Motion Picture Research Council (cf. Chapter II). Cross 
comparison of the parts of this question with frequency of 
attendance, with companionship at the movies, and with pre¬ 
ferred emotional appeal failed to elicit any interesting rela¬ 
tions. 

When asked who usually pays the admission price, 57 7° 
of the boys and 2Qfi of the girls reply that they pay their 
own, while 40^ of the boys and 65fi of the girls get the money 
from their parents. This is roughly the same in all the grades. 
When compared with the Status index of the home it is seen that 
in the lowest homes the proportion of children who pay their 
own way is much higher; in the “median” homes it is about the 
same as the average for the group; and in the highest class of 
home the proportion tends to drop a little. There seems to be 





48 


no significant relation between the source of admission money 
and the frequency of attendance. The last two statements would 
lead one to wonder whether or not those who can least afford 
to spend money on pleasures are, in many cases, in most urgent 
need of education as to the relative values of the things money 
will purchase. 

In the hope of finding out what influence companionship 
had upon the children attending the movies, they were asked 
who usually goes with them. Of the boys 51$ go with other 
boys of their own age, and 22$ go alone; while 57$ of the 
girls go with girls of the same age, and only 5$ go alone. As 
is to be expected, it is almost wholly the Public School child¬ 
ren who go usually with their parents, but it is the parents 
of the homes at or below the median home rating score who most 
usually go with their children. Though the data are scanty 
they prompt the query, "Does this indicate more concern for 
their children or a lack of other spare time pleasures?" 

There is no evident tendency for a direct relation 
between the companionship and the frequency of attendance; but 
it is noticeable that of those who usually go with parents a 
larger proportion ha.ve the picture chosen by their parents 
than is the case with thoe e who go with any other company or 
alone. However, of those who do go usually with parents 55$ 
think that they themselves most often choose the picture. This 
is quite understandable when we reflect that the parents who 
do not go with their children are more likely to exercise care 
in giving permission to go to the movies, whereas those who go 













r ; • 




49 


often themselves would more readily go wherever the children 
wish. It would not be wise, however, to draw any sweeping 
conclusions from this observation. 

When comparisons were made between companionship and 
the preferred content, preferred emotional appeal, and child¬ 
ren's estimate of educational value, no clear differences 
could be detected between those attended by parents and those 
in other company or alone. The reasons for preferring a fav¬ 
orite actor or actress are about the same regardless of com¬ 
panionship; but when asked whether or not they have imitated 
actors or actresses 65% of the boys who go with girls of their 
own age and 75% of the girls who go with boys of their own age 
reply in the affirmative; while the proportion in the total is 
abput equal for r, ye s “ and for u no". Why should young people 
of this age who go to the movies with the opposite sex have a 
greater tendency to imitate actors and actresses? Only spec¬ 
ulation is possible regarding the answer. 

The eighth question asked who usually chooses the movies 
the children see. When frequency of attendance is contrasted 
with the answers, it is revealed that in the case of those who 
go once a week or more 83% choose their own movies, while of 
those who go very seldom only 50% do so. On the whole parents 
choose 20% of the shows children see, and the children them¬ 
selves choose 75%. When they do so the tendency is for them 
to make their selection on the basis of their evaluation of 
the actors. The more often they attend the more is this the 
case. The younger they are the more they discuss the show with 















■ 











- 











50 


parents, and the older the more with others of their own age. 

No comparisons with other answers were made with re- 
soect to question number 11 (favorite show), but a study of 
the lists (cf. Chapter III) calls forth a few comments. Both 
boys and girls give the highest number of votes to Ben Hur, 
but on no other picture are they in such agreement. Boys alone 
vote for Hell's Angels, Wings, Dracula, and Frankenstein; while 
girls alone vote for Viennese Nights, Merely Mary Ann, and 
Delicious. In general, the lists show that the boys think that 
the best shows have to do with travel, aeroplanes and war, while 
the girls prefer Light Operas, Comedies, and Children's Stories. 

The lists of disliked shows (cf. Chapter III) reveal 
that of all pictures Frankenstein was the most disappointing; 
but, from the boy's point of view, what he calls "love-sick 
novels" are almost equally disliked. Both boys and girls unite 
in condemning murder stories, tragedies, and depressing pic¬ 
tures . 

Question 13 asks the child to indicate "what kind of 
picture" he likes best. The percentage of replies for each 
answer is given below.

The long feature picture is most certainly the first 
choice, and comedy the second. The boys more than the girls 
prefer the newsreel and the animated cartoons. These pro¬ 
portions remain fairly constant throughout the Grades. When 
compared with frequency of attendance it was noticed that 
comedy and cartoons receive the largest proportions of votes 
from those who go to the movies very seldom. As frequency of 
attendance increases these rapidly give way to the long feat¬ 
ure picture which in the total of all who attend once a week 
or more receives almost 50% of the votes. In the comparison 
with Socio-Economic status no noticeable differences could be 
discovered: the proportions of those in each status class 

voting for each part of this question are almost the same. 
Comparison with Intelligence Quotient showed that the means 
and distributions of votes for e ach answer are quite similar 
to those for the total group, except that the mean I. Q. for 
those voting for ’newsreel’ is only 86. No child with I. Q. 
of 100 or more voted for this answer. 

The preferred contents of the movies are worthy of 
notice. The percentages of choices, first andsecond choices 
grouped together, for each suggested answer are as follows:

In general, Cov/boy and Western Stories are the most 
popular among both boys and girls in almost the same propor¬ 
tion. Love pictures, aeroplanes etc., war, and gangsters are 
the next, but follow far behind. This applies to all the 
Grades. The boys of Grades VI and VII show preference for 
the Cowboy picture distinctly, but that oreference gives way 
gradually to aeroplanes etc. In Grades VIII, IX, and X the 
last mentioned actually exceeds the Cowboy picture and in the 
total of all Grades almost equals it. The girls of Grades VI 
and VII have a similar preference for the Cowboy film, and 
place war, gangster and animal pictures next; but in the higher 
Grades all these give way to the love picture. The boys, in 
general, show much more preference for the pictures of war, 
gangsters, aeroplanes, and others that depict gripping, danger¬ 
ous action; while the girls prefer that which the boys place 
lowest of all-—the love picture. However, both boys and girls 
show an increasing interest in the love picture as the fre¬ 
quency of attendance increases. Of those who go very seldom 
10^ of the girls and 1 % of the boys vote for this type, while 





















. 

' ~ ... ■; - -- - ' 












53 


of those who go once a week or more 24$ of the girls and 5$ 
of the hoys prefer it. Study of two-way distribution between 
Socio-Economic status and preferences in this question does 
not reveal any distinguishable tendency for either higher or 
lower class homes to influence the children in any special 
way in the choice of pictures. 

When votes for the answers to this question were com¬ 
pared in a two-way table with Intelligence Quotient it was 
apparent that in the Public School the distributions and the 
means of the votes for each answer were comparable with those 
of the whole group, except that the mean I. Q. for those who 
voted for “children of our country and other lands” was 112. 
The votes are nearly all from girls; the boys almost com¬ 
pletely avoid the answer. In the High Schools also all the 
I. Q. means cluster about the general me an (i.e. 105) except 
those for the children who vote for “Cowboys and Western 
Stories” and for "Love Pictures”. Those means are respect¬ 
ively 102 and 103 while all the others are 105 or more. The 
differences, however, are not great enough to justify any 
sweeping conclusions. 

Question 16 asked for the preferred emotional appeal. 
The results follow.

Quite obviously excitement, teaching, and laughter 
are what the children like in shows. Fright and sadness are 
'’enjoyed" by a few but most of the votes for these occur in 
the second choices. Apparently they like fright and sadness 
best when they are secondary elements in the show. Of the 
girls 9% like sad shows but only 2% of the boys do so. The 
following table showing the relation between frequency of 
attendance and preferred emotional apoeal is interesting. 
Boys and girls are grouped together. The numbers represent 
percentages of the total votes for each frequency 'class', 
and those totals are indicated in the table opposite the 
letter 'N'.

For those who go very seldom the teaching quality of 
a picture appeals more strongly than either laughter or ex¬ 
citement, but for those who go once a week or more excite¬ 
ment has the strongest appeal. Not only does the desire to 
be taught and to laugh decrease but the desire to be excited 
and frightened increases with increasing attendance. This 
must not be interpreted to mean that any particular child 
would, with increased attendance, nrefer excitement and 
fright to education and laughter; it only means that in this 
group this difference is noticeable between those who go very 
seldom and those who go more often. Even this fact, however, 
is disappointing; it is unfortunate that frequent attendance 
should not instill a more praiseworthy desire, but when it is 
kept in mind that the aopeal of the movies is largely to the 
emotions it is readily understood why the intellectual inter¬ 
est flags while the emotional appeal increases. 

From a comparison with companionship it was observed 
that those who go with parents tend to value teaching content 
a little more, while those who go with their own age and sex 
tend more toward excitement. Those who go with the opposite 
sex of their own age quite definitely prefer excitement to 
either laughter or teaching value. Socio-Economic status ap¬ 
pears to have no relation to the emotional anneal preferred: 
that is, neither high nor low status is associated with any 
one of the answers to the question. 

Contrast of I. Q. with preferred emotional anneal 
reveals that higher I. Q. in the High Schools seems to be 










56 


associated with greater preference for educational and 
frightening pictures. The mean I. Q. for those in the High 
Schools who vote for * fright* is 117, while that for those 
giving each of the other answers is at or very near 105, which 
is the mean for the group. 

The nineteenth question was framed in the hope of find¬ 
ing out what the children think they learn from the movies. 

The percentage of votes for each suggested answer is indicated 
in the following list.

"How people live and act" is quite definite3.y at the 
head of the list, especially with the girls, and when this is 
combined with the first two it is evident that, in the opinion 
of the children, they learn a great deal about conduct. Whe¬ 
ther what they learn is ethics, or etiquette, or prudence, or 
social poise, we cannot say but it does seem certain that, at 
least in the realm of the ideology of conduct, children are 
willing pupils of the screen. Boys more than girls say they 
learn Geography, History and things commonly included under 
the title “Nature study 11 from the movies. The constant refer¬ 
ence to the value of the newsreel on the "essay” sheet would 
strengthen the impression here that the cinematograph could be

This seems to indicate that the more frequent is the 
attendance the less is the opinion that the movies teach the 
academic kind of knowledge and the more widespread the idea 
that their educational value is ethical. This will be appar¬ 
ent if the reader will notice that the first two and the 
fourth rows of percentages increase toward the right (i.e. 
with increasing attendance) and the last three decrease to¬ 
ward the right. 

A contrast between this question and that concerning 
companionship revealed that the child’s conception of what 
the movies teach is not affected by his companion. It was 
noticed, however, that those who go alone rate the academic 
value higher and the social knowledge value lower. No start¬ 
ling relation exists between I. Q. and the answers to this 
question, but there is a slight tendency for the children 
of higher I. Q. to think that the teaching of the movies is 
less in the subject of conduct and more in the academic realm. 
Comparison with Socio-Economic status brings no result worth 
remarking; the distributions and means of the status scores 
of those voting for each answer are nearly the same. 

As an attempt to confirm the results of the previous 
question, number 21 asked what else the children think the 
movies teach. These are the proportions of votes for each 
suggested answer. 

Boys Girls 

To be popular 20.2% 28.8% 

To do wrong and not to be caught 23*6 15*2 

To be honorable and do right 56.2 56.0 























59 


“To be honorable and do right" receives more than half 
the votes in the case both of boys and of girls, and the more 
often they attend the greater is the proportion of votes for 
this answer. A larger percentage of girls than of boys vote 
for "To be popular", and a larger percentage of boys than of 
girls vote for "To do wrong and not to be caught." 

It is interesting to note that though "To be honorable 
and do right" is first in every Grade, second place is clearly 
held among Grades VI to VIII boys by "To do wrong and not to 
be caught"; and that in Grades IX and X second place is held 
by "To be popular". The same change is evident among the girls, 
with the difference that it occurs a year earlier. 

As was noted previously, the answers to this question do 
not agree with the answers to the "essay" question which asked 
"What harmful effects do you think they have?" Though many 
indicated in their answers to the latter question that they 
thought the moral influence of the movies upon other children 
might be bad, a large proportion of the same children vote for 
"Do right" in this question. The reason for the difference, I 
think, is that the "objective" question was interpreted as re¬ 
ferring personally to the one who was answering. Apparently a 
good many children are quite willing to admit that there are 
immoral influences on the screen, but they do not admit that 
those influences touch them. 

Two questions of a psychological nature present them¬ 
selves. The first is: Are the children rationalizing? It is

possible that some screen conduct is recognized by them as 
bad and yet has no evil influence upon them; but it is also 
possible that the deeds or words or attitudes of the actors 
and actresses are construed as right after they have been 
adopted by the child. The second question is: What is the 
memory effect? If the children see in the movies things which 
are either immoral or suggestive, what difference will it make 
to them in later life when the actual visual images have gone 
but the unconscious influence continues? Forman in reporting 
the studies of the Motion Picture Research Council says that 
children are incapable of emotional detachment. If he is 
right then we have in the cinema all the elements necessary 
for the building up of a vast supply of conscious and uncon¬ 
scious tendencies to react after the manner of screen conduct 
when the child in later years meets the intricate situations 
of life. It is still possible, however, that Forman is wrong, 
and that, as the children would have us believe, they are 
moved to virtuous actions even after seeing shows which they 
know might have evil results in other children.' 

Favorite actors and actresses are numerous. The four 
most favored actreses with the number of votes for each are 
shown below.

Many reasons are given for preferring these actors 
and actresses, but half the children say they make their 
choice on the basis of histrionic ability. This proportion 
holds for both boys and girls and in all the grades; and fre¬ 
quency of attendance has little influence upon it. 

Conscious imitation of actors and actresses is admitted 
by about half the boys and about half the girls. The fraction 
is higher among those who go oftener; and, as was noted above, 
it is markedly higher among those who attend the movies with 
children of their own age and opposite sex. 

The relation of many of the parts of the questionnaire 
to Socio-Economic status has been indicated, but a few words 
are in order as to the general tendencies shown by the status 
scores. It is apparent that there is a relation between home 
rating and frequency of attendance. The higher the status 
score the more frequent is attendance. The mean status score 
for those who attend once a month is 13 and that for those who 
attend twice a week is 21, while the mean status score for the 
whole group is 14.5. Frequency of attendance for those whose 
home status is near the mean is just below twice per month.

Contrast of Home Status with reasons for not attending 
more often shows that the mean Socio-Economic status scores 
for children who say that there are religious or financial 
factors acting as deterrents are low, while the mean for those 
who mention time as the limiting factor is above the mean for 
the group. Children from the homes graded lower, more than 
those from those graded higher, tend to earn their own admis¬ 
sion money. There is a slight tendency shown for the parents 
of the homes rated below the mean to go more often with their 
children to the movies. No relation could be discovered be¬ 
tween home rating score and preferred type, content or emo¬ 
tional appeal, and likewise none between that score and the 
child’s estimate of the substance taught by the movies. 





CHAPTER VI 


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

Further studies following this investigation would 
gain by strengthening the method in various places. At least 
two things could be done to insure more reliable results. 

One would be to insert in the ”objective" questionnaire parts 
which were identical or very similar or at least of such a 
nature that what determined the answer in one case would also 
determine it in the other. Then comparison of the answers 
given would give an indication of the reliability of the 
child’s answers. A second way of determining the value of 
results would be to give the same questionnaire to the same 
children at an Interval of, say, six months, after which time 
it could be assumed that the child would have forgotten most 
of what he had written on the previous occasion. These two 
additions to the method would give ways of testing the sin¬ 
cerity of the children and the reliability of their answers. 

It is not implied in the previous paragraph that the 
results of the present study are unreliable; on the contrary 
all the clues that were available pointed to the conclusion 
that the answers were worthy of consideration and amenable to 
simple statistical treatment.

Particular 'Conclusions have been indicated in the body 
of the report and will not be repeated here, but certain general 
remarks are in order. 

The cinema is an educational force to be reckoned with. 
The screen can probably, in its fascinating way, impart more of 
knowledge and attitude to childrens minds in the short period 
of two hours than can any other single factor in our civiliz¬ 
ation. The estimates of the children indicate that the academic 
value, even as the movies are today, is considerable, and the 
writer joins heartily with many of them in asserting that there 
is probably no more effective way of teaching history, geography, 
and current events. The same method could, no doubt, be used 
for much more of human knowledge. The influence is not limited 
to mental content but extends to motivation and attitudes. 

Three observations, made before, may be repeated here: over 
half of the children are of the opinion that it is in the 
realm of conduct that the movies teach them most; a large pro¬ 
portion say that there are influences in the cinema which might 
direct other children to wrong conduct; and almost all of this 
latter group (and over half of the whole group) say that the 
personal result is virtuous activity. The three statements 
can hardly be harmonized. However, whether they are harmonized 
or not, they are convincing evidence, to the writer at least, 
that the cinema has a greater part in the molding of the lives 
of children than society should leave in the ungoverned hands 
of an industry organized for monetary profit. 

Censorship has, no doubt, done a great deal to delete

injurious parts and, perhaps, indirectly has improved the qual¬ 
ity of the movies produced. In fact there are those who con¬ 
tend that censors have had the interests of children so much 
at heart that they have removed the dramatic elements which make 
the plots appeal to adults. Their recommendation is that there 
be two classes of theatres or programmes: one for children and 
one for adults. It cannot be said that it is good to have an 
institution which makes ethical standards depend upon age. It 
is doubtful if society can successfully teach that virtue is its 
own reward if it recognizes an institution which implies that 
what is wrong for children will be right when they have become 
adults. Perhaps we can get some help from the analagous history 
of the stage. Improvement there was due not to having special 
performances for children, and not only to censorship, but to 
a public opinion which eventually demanded a higher type of 
programme. If it be true that popular interest in amateur 
dramatization was one of the large factors in creating a demand 
for good drama, then I think we may infer that the best way to 
create a popular demand for worthy movies is to take them into 
our educational system and use them to the best advantage. That 
this is financially impossible is very probably true at present; 
but small beginnings would soon commend themselves so highly 
that the use of the cinema in schools would, in my opinion, rapid¬ 
ly increase. It seems fair to expect two advantages: the dimin¬ 
ution of the glamor of screen conduct, and the development of a 
taste for good films. 

In the meantime, in order that the cinema should be a 
commendable element in educating and motivating children for life,

censorship seems advisable and classification of programmes 
and theatres may be a temporary necessity. If these measures 
are adopted in conjunction with the use of movies in the 
schools for both recreation and education, we may hope for an 
enlightened and trained public opinion which will demand high 
quality in the cinema.
