1. Introduction 

Spectroscopic research, which has been so 
intensively pursued during the past thirty years or so, 
and which has provided such a wealth of information 
concerning the structure and mechanics of the atom, 
has until recently been mainly concentrated on the 
compilation of wave-length data, expressing the 
positions of spectral lines, and on the discovery and 
interpretation of regularities in these data. It is 
in this way that much of our knowledge of the arrange¬ 
ment of the electrons within the atom has been gained, 
and the majority of the more important atomic energy 
levels have been located. 

According to the Quantum theory a given kind 
of atom possesses only certain discrete characteristic 
energy levels and when changing from higher to lower 
energy levels light is emitted whose wave length is 
inversely proportional to this energy difference. It 
is found that sometimes the spectral lines produced 
fall closely together in small groups, such as the two 
well known yellow sodium lines. Such structure is 
called fine, or multiple structure. Such fine 
structure is evidently due to small changes in wave 
length caused by small changes in energy differences. 
Thus we find groups of energy levels in the atom lying 
very close together. 

However, lines which appear quite sharp in a 
spectrum obtained with a spectrograph of low dispersion.

when examined by apparatus of greater dispersive power 
such as a Fabry-Perot interferometer or a Lummer- Gehrcke 
plate, break up into a number of components. This is 
called Hyperfine structure. In terms of energy level 
diagrams hyperfine structure in a spectrum line is due 
to minute differences between energy levels of a group, 
attributed to the effect of the nucleus on the energy 
of the atom. However, experimental work has shewn 
that two types of hyperfine structure exist, one due to 
nuclear magnetic and mechanical moment, and a second 
due to isotope effects. In some elements hyperfine 
structure alone is observed, in others isotope structure 
alone is observed, and in still others both are 
observed. 

Although there is yet much to be learned from 
an experimental and a theoretical standpoint, 
considerable progress has been made in the analysis and 
interpretation of hyperfine structure. Hence we might 
say the modern trend in spectroscopy is from the study 
of the macro-structure of Spectra to their micro¬ 
structure. 

The term analysis of singly-ionized thallium 
over a region of 7,000 A to 2,200 A is fairly complete, 
and the magnitude of the hyperfine separations,together 
with the general simplicity of the patterns has resulted 
in <iuite a number of investigations. The spectrum of 
singly ionized thallium has been investigated by Rao, 




-3- 


Naryan and Rao (16), by McLennan, MoLay and Crawford 
(17) and by Smith (18). A further analysis was done 
by McLennan, McLay and Crawford (19) and extended by 
Smith (20), not only increasing the number of known 
terms of singly ionized thallium but also revealing 
the fine structure character of some of the lines. 

Later, McLennan and Crawford (21) from an observation 
of the intensities and separations of the components 

gave 

of the hyperfine multiplets^an interpretation of the 
hyperfine structure of singly ionized thallium, consis¬ 
tent with the F ^election rule, the (JF) intensity rule, 
and the value 1= i for the nuclear moment, was 
deduced. Schuler and Keyston (EE) observed the 
existence of isotope shifts in some of the hyperfine 
spectral levels of Tl. ; II. McLennan, McLay and Crawford 
(15) compared the numerical results, as shown on the 
previous paper (El) with the theory. 

A further analysis of the hyperfine structure 
of singly ionized thallium is presented in this report.

Theory of Hyperfine Structure 

The hyperfine structure of energy levels and 
spectral lines may be interpreted as the interaction 
of the nucleus of an atom and its surrounding electrons. 
In order to understand the origin of hyperfine 
structure of the spectra it is primarily necessary to 
have a clear understanding as to how fine structure 
multiplets arise. 

Term Notation : The following notation is used : 

£ — the orbital quantum number, 
s — the electron spin quantum number, 
the inner quantum number, which 
is obtained by the vectorial 
addition of 1 and s, i.e. j may 

take the values j L+ s| ,|£+- s ~ll- 

-|1 - a|. 

Different electrons possess different £ values, taking 
any of the values 0, 1 , 2, 3, 4, etc. For a given 
total quantum number n, the eccentricity of the orbit 
in which the electron moves depends on the value of £. 
Electrons for various £ values are usually designated 
by the small letters s, p, d, f, etc., to which 
correspond the values L- 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. Atomic 
states corresponding to similar £ values are 
designated by means of the capital letters 3, P, D, 

F, etc. An atomic state is virtually a description 
of the energy and position of the optical electron, 
and the different states, or different energy values, 
which make up all the energy levels out of which the 
spectrum arises* are called terms. In describing

a term the j value is written to the right as a 
subscript, and the multiplicity of the term is 
written as a super-script on the left of the term 
designation. For example, consider the term 
6s6p 3 D 3 , which indicates two valency electrons 6s 
and 6p. We have a triplet D term with a j value 
equal to three. 

When an electron is excited and lifted 
up to a high orbit, it tends to fall back to a 
lower orbit. The transitions allowed are subject 
to the selection principle that 

A j = ± 1 or 0 with j = 0—^ 0 forbidden 

Ae. = ± i. 

Fine Structure : 

The study of the terms of a one electron 
atom, that is an atom with one valence electron 
such as, the alkalies, sodium, potassium, etc. is 
easily examined. However in discussion of spectra 
produced by atoms which have two or more valence 
electrons the task becomes more difficult, since 
the valence electrons interact with each other. 

Sach of the valence electrons possess a spin angular 
momentum sh_ and an orbital angular momentum Lh- 
where 1 may have any of the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
etc. These vectors may combine in a variety of ways, 
and one may distinguish two extreme types of coupling 
called LS (Russell Saunders 1 coupling) and (jj) 




- 6 - 


respectively. In the vector notation small letters 
are used to represent specific angular momenta for 
individual electrons, and capital letters for 
resultant sums. 

In L.S. coupling all the £ values form a 
resultant L and the s values a resultant S which 
then combine to form J. This simply means that 
when the interaction between different electrons of 
a configuration is very large compared with the 

an cl 

interaction between the spins of each electron w ith 
its own orbital motion, one speaks of Russell Saunders' 
coupling. 

In (jj) coupling the £ and s of each electron 
combine to form a resultant j for each electron, and 
then all the j values form a resultant J. That is, 
when the interaction between the spin of each electron 
with its orbital motion is large compared with the 
interaction between the various electrons, one speaks 
of (jj) coupling. 

The theory for fine structure shows that 
multiplet separations are due to the energy of 
interaction between the spin and orbital motions of 
the electrons (l). It can be shown that, in LS 
coupling, the interaction energy between the resultant 
angular orbital momentum L is given by E, when 
E = A. LS. cos. (SL) 
where A= the interaction constant. 







. 



-7- 


The interaction energy between two vectors is propor¬ 
tional to the cosine of the angle between these vectors, 
and it can be shown that the above expression is 
equivalent to : 

E = A [j(J+ 1) - L(L+1) - S(S-m]-(1) 

/ 

This formula expresses the Lands Interval Rule, and 
from it the ratio of the intervals in a multiplet can 
be calculated. If the energy difference between two 
levels of the same multiplet is taken, one having a 
total moment J and the other (J - 1); it can be seen 
that 

E (J) - E (J - 1) = A x J 
The subsequent intervals are thus proportional to 
the larger value of J corresponding to one of the two 
adjacent levels. This simplified form of the Lande 
rule is true,for all cases in which strict LS coupling 
takes place. While the ratio of the intervals 
between the terms is a function of J, their actual 
separations depend upon the value of the interval 
factor A. This factor A depends upon the distance 
of the electron from the nucleus, the degree of 
penetration of the orbit, the screening effect of the 
other electrons, and the interaction energy between 
the electrons themselves. The interval factor, 
therefore, differs for different multiplets, usually 
diminishing as the orbital number of the optical 
electron increases.

Hyperfine Structure 

Two types of hyperfine structure occur in 
line spectra and these arise from entirely different 
causes. The first type is due to the fact that the 
nuclei of atoms have the property of a spin. The 
other type is called the isotope type due the exist¬ 
ence of isotopes. 

Nuclear spin and Interaction of Nuclear and Electron 
Magnetic Moments 

Associated with the nucleus we have a 

nuclear spin quantum number designated by I, the 

mechanical moment of momentum of the nucleus being XI? . 

£TT 

Goudsmit revealed that a new quantum vector, F, had 
to be added to the vector model of the atom (3). 

This vector F is the resultant obtained when the 
mechanical moment vector of the nucleus denoted by 
I is combined with the total mechanical moment vector 
J, of the extranuclear electrons. The different 
values of F correspond to the different hyperfine 
structure levels, 

F= (1+ J), (14 J - 1) -(I - J). 

The number of hyperfine structure levels is given by 
either (21+ 1) or (2J+1) according to whether I or 
J is the smaller of the two. This rule shows that if 

1 eve/ 

the "3“ values of a line are known to be large, the 
nuclear spin may be determined directly from the 
number of lines or $n the pattern. For allowed 

transitions between sets of levels the selection rules 









-9- 


for F in hyperfine structure are just the same as 
those for J in fine .structure, viz., 

A F =±1 or 0 with F= 0—^0 forbidden. 

The separationSin hyperfine structure are 
due to the interaction energy between the nuclear 
moment and the total extranuclear moment. The 
interaction energy between the two vectors I and J 
is dependent upon a number of factors. Firstly 
it is the value of the magnetic moment that deter¬ 
mines the interaction energy of I and J. The nuclear 
magnetic moment = I . g (I), so that g(X) the 
nuclear constant is the ratio of the magnetic to the 
mechanical moment when quantum units are used. The 
second factor affecting the interaction energy is the 
nuclear charge, for the higher the degree of ionization 
the greater is the coupling energy between the extra- 
nuclear electron moment J and the nuclear spin I. A 
third factor is the eccentricity of the orbit of the 
optical electron. It can be seen that s-electrons 
will penetrate the inner shells to a greater extent 
than p-electrons, hence the coupling energy of an s 
electron will generally be much greater than that of 
a p-eleetron. 

One-electron spectra 

Calculations of the nuclear interaction 
with one valence electron have been made by Fermi (4) 
Gasimir(5) Hargreaves*6) Breit(7) and Goudsmit(8).

The coupling between I and j may be 
considered as consisting of two parts. I couples with 
the orbital angular moment of the electron, that is (IL) 
coupling takes place, and I couples with the electron 
spin so that (IS) coupling also occurs. When these 
two effects are added the total interaction energy 
between nucleus and electron is obtained (9). The 
result shows that the energy E is given by the 
expression : 

E = JJj. cos. (IJ) ... (2) 

which reduces to the form —i

This is identical with equation (1) if we replace F, 

j and I by J, L and S. Hence the Lande Interval 

rule holds for hyperfine structure, and this has been 

strongly supported by experimental observation. As 

an example consider the 6^ term in the bismuth atom 

where J= 1 and the observed value of 1= 9/2. The 

allowed values of F are 11/2, 9/2 and 7/2. According 

to the interval rule the difference between these 

levels should be in the ratio of 11 to 9, that is 

1.222. The observed ratio of the intervals is 1.483 
to 

ssd 1.214 which is 1.222, hence is in excellent 
agreement with the interval rule. (10)

The interval factor A can be approximately 
calculated for the simple case of one electron spectra* 
It is found that A is proportional to :

where Z^; and z are respectively the effective electric 
charges of the nucleus in the inner and outer portion 
of the penetrating orbit, and n is the effective 
quantum number. 

Case of two s-electrons : 

For more complex configurations, as an example 
consider two s-electrons, the interaction energy may be 
calculated completely in terms of each of the electrons. 
Casimir showed that in the particular case of an 
s-electron, the interaction energy is given by : 

E = AIs. cos. (Is). 


Following Casimir, Goudsmit has calculated the interaction 
energy for an atom which has two valence s-eleetrons (9). 
If the subscripts denote the two electrons, the inter¬ 
action energy is given by : 

E = a* Is* Cos. (Isj'4 a^Is* Cos. (Is*).(4) 

Here a 4 and a^ are the numerical proportionality factors 
for each electron respectively. 

(4) reduces to an expression of the form 

E = Ij:. cos. (Ij) IOA Cos (s,j)-f- Cos.(s A |) 

Li ^ J 

Comparing this with the previous expression equation (l) 

E = Alj cos. (Ij)

An s-electron and a non-s-electron 

In the case of an s-electron and an arbitrary 
other electron the evaluation of als.cos.(Is) depends 
on the type of coupling of the quantum vectors of the 
extranuclear electrons. For Russell Sanders coupling:

Where s represents the total spin momenta, and s^the 
spin moment of the s-electron. In this expression the 
interaction with the s-electron above is taken into 
account and the interaction with the other electrons 
is regarded as negligible.

of the levels of complicated electron configuration 
in different types of coupling have been deduced by 
Groudsrait (8). His method is that of the invariance 
of energy sums. Having considered the interaction 
of a magnetic nucleus and an electron in an s-state 
let us now consider the ease of a non-s electron. 

The method used by Goudsmit is as follows : 

The interaction between the electrons is 
thought to be removed by the application of a 
fictitious very strong magnetic field, then each 
electron can be treated as independent of the others. 
Applying a magnetic field just uncouples the nuclear 
spin from the rest of the atom, giving each an 
independent projection on the field direction M x and Mj. 
The interaction between the nucleus and the valence 
electron is given by 


E- A( j)M x Mj 

A is the separation constant which governs the magnitude 

of the hyperfine multiplet of the particular level after 

the magnetic field is removed. The levels of the 

hyperfine multiplet are given by 

E = A(i) Ij. cos. (Ij) 

- A (j) FlF- 1) - 1(1+1) - j( j +1) 

2 


In the classical theory the interaction between 
a single non-s electron and a nuclear magnetic moment 


consists of two parts. The nuclear magnetic moment 






-15- 


is acted upon by a magnetic field caused by the orbital 
motion of the electron and also by a field produced by 
the electron spin. The expression for this interaction 
energy is (Ref: 3) pa^e 


E = E t +- E s = a 11 cos. (It) - Is cos. (Is) 
+■ 31s cos. (I«.) cos. Us) 


E^and E s represent the interaction energy due to the 


orbit„motion of the valence electron and the spin of the 
electron respectively. 


/v-denotes the radius vector eonfeMlng the nucleus with 


the electron. 

Neglecting all interactions between the quantum vectors 
and since the nuclear, the orbital and the spin moment 
have projections U x m c and irrespectively on the direction 
of the fictitious magnetic field and the vectors I, l and 
s will have independent Larmor precessions about the 
field direction the cosine terms of the preceding 
equation may be expanded. The resulting expression is 



( 10 ) 


This expression is valid only for non-s electrons. 

The application of the sum rule and equation 
(10) to the case of a single electron provides a very 
simple derivation of the results obtained by Fermi, 
Gasimir, Hargreaves and Breit using quantum mechanical 
methods. The resulting expression is

Eyperfine structure for extreme (jj) coupling 

In LS. coupling it is only possible to give 
the sum of the interval factors for all the terms of a 
multiplet group which have the same $ value. For example, 
the D terms which arise from an sd electron configuration 
are 3 D 5 fD» , 3 D, and . The interval factors for the 3 ]), and 
3 D 3 terms can be calculated, but only the sum of the 
interval factors for the two terms 3 B ;l and 1 D x is obtained

since they have identical $ values*. For spectra 
which show (jj) type of coupling the interval factor 
for every term is given separately. 

When the spin and orbit of an electron are 
coupled, the interaction with the nuclear magnetism 
is given as 


E = a 1 Ij JL cos. (I jj or a^Ij^cos. (I jj 
where a 4 or a^depends on whether one considers the 
state with £+ % or the one with j = t £ -J) * For 
several electrons the total interaction with the nucleus 
is 


E = y a^Ij^ cos. (I H .(13)

to one of the form, 

E = AIJ cos. (IJ)

a single electron, the values of g to be used are those

Isotope Effect 

Besides hyperfine structure due to a nuclear 
magnetic and mechanical moment, a second hyperfine 
structure due to the different isotopes of the same 
chemical element is also found. Hyperfine structure 
is observed only in the cases of isotopes with odd 
mass number, since isotopes with even mass number have 
either a zero mechanical moment or zero magnetic 
moment. In elements such as mercury and thallium 
where isotope structure is present, it is found that 
relative shifts of a set of terms belonging to one 
isotope are practically the same as the relative 
shifts of the same levels in another isotope. Because 
there are no combinations between the levels of one iso¬ 
tope and those of another, one cannot say how much one 
system has been shifted from the other,but only how 
levels shift relative to others. The relative shifts 
where observed are found to be approximately proportional 
to the mass differences. The suggestion that isotope 
shift may be due to a change in the feydberg constant 










-19- 


is occasionally bat not always in agreement with 
experiment. Attempts to calculate isotope 
displacements in heavy elements have been made by 
Breit. These calculations, based upon a change in 
the size of the nucleus, are in fair agreement with 
the relative shifts observed in mercury,thallium 
and lead.

of helium at a pressure of about 0.7 cm., of Hg. The 
arrangement is shown in fig. (l). The pyrex glass 
tube of length 30 cms. and internal diameter 4.6 cms. 
had an aluminium anode and a molybdenum cathode of 
length 7 cms. and a diameter of 1.7 cms. The helium 
was circulated through the discharge tube by means of 
two mercury pumps in tandem and cleaned by passing 
through charcoal immersed in COg snow. The relatively 
high pressure of helium was used to keep the Thallium 
vapour from diffusing out of the cathode. Both the 
pyrex tube and water bath were provided with quartz 
windows to let through the ultra-violet light.

The discharge was excited by applying a voltage 
of about 800 volts supplied by a D.G. generator in series 
with about 900 ohmsthe current through the tube being 
normally 0.24 amps. 



Fig. 2 

The light from the cathode was condensed on 
to the reflecting prism of the Lummer Gehrcke plate by 
means of a quartz lens L-^, and the fringes formed were 
focussed on the slit of a Hilger,Spectrograph by a 
quartz fluorite lens of focal length 23 cms. The 
plane of the Lummer plate was horizontal, i.e. 
perpendicular to the slit of the spectrograph. 

The Lummer plate, its adjustable holder, and 
Nicol prism, in the case of the quartz plate, were housed 
in a double-walled box made of rt ten-test ,? , the windows 
of which were formed by the quartz condensing lens L-j_, 
and the quartz fluorite projecting lens Lg, the latter 
being rigidly attached to the spectrograph. The 
interferometer system and the spectrograph stood on a 
rigid steel plate. The discharge tube, circulating 
pumps, purifying tubes and helium reservoirs, formed a

oomplete unit rigidly attached to the top of a table of 
adjustable height. The whole system travelled on 
wheels along a track permitting the maintenance of the 
alignment of the tube with the optical system. Hence 
the relative position of the source with respect to 
the Lummer plate and spectrograph could be adjusted 
at will. 

Since temperature changes tend to broaden 
the spectral lines due to a change in thickness of the 
Lummer plate, also changing refractive indices of the 
plate, it was essential to maintain the temperature of 
the spectrograph and the interferometer as constant as 
possible, especially when long exposures of ten hours* 
duration or more were made. For this purpose two 
mercury contact thermostats were used. One of these 
kept the room temperature constant with a maximum 
variation of about 0.5° C, and the other maintained the 
temperature of the box constant* The amplitude of the 
variation of the air temperature in the box being 
about 0.2° G, the temperature changes in the Lummer 
plate itself would probably bf less than this. 

Two glass Lummer plates of length 13 and 20 
cms. , with respective thicknesses 0.4872 and 0 
cms. and two quartz Lummer plates of length 13 cms., 
and respective thicknesses 0.4493 cms. and 0.5872 cms. 
were used. The optic axis of the 4 m.m. quartz 

lummer plate was parallel to the long edge of the

plate, while the 6 m.m. quartz plate had its optic 
axis at right angles to the long edge. A nicol 
prism with its short diagonal horizontal was inserted 

between the condensing lens and plate so that the 

the 

light travelled through the plate as A ordinary rayfc 
in the 4 m.m. quartz plate, and as the extraordinary 
ray for 6 m.m. plate. 

The Lummer plate was always adjusted to give 
simultaneously the fringes from both the top and bottom 
of the plate. The adjustment of the angle of incidence 
of light on the reflecting prism of the Lummer plate to 
obtain symmetry between the two sets of fringes was 
found to be very critical. 

For the shorter wave length region that is 
the violet and ultra-violet region Eastman 33 plates 
were used and Process panchromatic plates for the 
largerXregions. The photographic plates were 
developed by means of Agfa-fine grain developer and 
fixed with a special acetic acid fixing solution. 

The fringes were measured on a comparator.

Method of Measuring up the fringe pattern produced 
by Lummer plate. 

To carry out the analysis the procedure is as 

follows : 

The fringes produced by plates of different thicknesses 
are photographed in succession, the coarse structure 
being dispersed in a horizontal direction by a prism 

wirh wide. s>l'K 

spectrograph^and the hyperfine structure vertically 
by means of the interferometer. We thus obtain on the 
photographic plate wide images of the slit correspond¬ 
ing to the spectral lines, which are crossed by the 
horizontal fringes of the hyperfine structure. 

A precise method of measuring the photographic 
fringe patterns produced by Lummer plates is due to 
McLennan and McLeod (12), in which the geometrically 
central line of the double fringe patterns is taken as 
the line of reference in the measurements. This exact 
formula permits of the use of the fringes that emerge 
from the plate at nearly grazing direction, for which 
the dispersion is the greatest.

Experimental Results 

The observations and results of this 
investigation are presented in the following pages. 

The line spectra for thallium was obtained for the 
range of approximately 7,000 A to 3,000 A. 

An interpretation of the hyperfine structure 
patterns obtained,was as follows. The transitions 
allowed between hyperfine multiplets were calculated 
according to the selection rules A f = ±1 or 0. 

In most cases investigated all of the expected 
components were not found. The relative intensities 
of the expected hyperfine components were calculated 
by means of the intensity formulae derived by Hill(K) 
and these intensities compared with the observed 
intensities, thus enabling us to recognise the various 
components. However, on some of the plates, the lines 
of the hyperfine pattern were found to overlap, while 
on other patterns^more than the expected number of 
components were found due to isotope shifts of the 
energy levels.

According to the theory of hyperfine structure 
four components are expected for this pattern. Only 
two components were observed, with a very faint trace 
of a third component, when the 4 ra.m. quartz Lummer 
plate was used. Table I presents the observations

This particular level was investigated by 


means of the two lines 3364 and 3320. In the case of 
the line 3364, only two of the components were resolved 
and the pattern obtained was mixed with that of the 
line 3365. However, the separation of the components 
of these two transitions were found respectively. 

Using the separation value which was obtained for the 
6s6d 3 D 3 level, the value of the 6s6f l F 5 level was found. 

The line 3320 is one of the triplet, 3320, 
3321 and 3322, hence the pattern obtained in this case 
was very complex. Nine components were found, 
although three of these components could not be 
measured throughout the whole of the patterns obtained.

Each of the lines of this triplet involved the level 
6s6d 3 D which had been measured by Schuler^ lienee the 
determination of the separation of the other respective 
levels could be found. In the case of the line 3320 
a value of the separation for the level 6s6f'F 3 was found. 
6a6f 3 g, 

The separation of this level was obtained from 
the lines 3321 and 3365, whose particular hyperfine 
patterns have already been mentioned. The line 3365 
involved the level 6s6d 3 D a . 

6s6f 3 F, 

This level was examined by means of the lines 
3291 and 3322. The hyper fine pattern for the line 
3291 revealed two components. The separation between 
these components was found and using Schuler's value of 
.^ukM J for the 6s6d 3 D, level the separation for 6s6f 3 F R 
was determined. 

6s6f 5 F 4 

The separation of this level was determined 
by an examination of the line 3369. Only two components 
were resolved, and their separation was found. Knowing 
the separation of the 6s6d 3 D 5 level the separation of 
the 6s6f 3 F 4 level was found. 

6a7d 3 

An examination of the line 6181 yielded the 
separation of the level 6s7d 3 I>3 - Only two components 
were resolved. Schuler f s value of 3 -U 12 f 0r the 6s7p 3 B^ 
level was used in the derivation of the result.

6s9sfs t 

The investigation of this level was done 
by means of the two lines 4274 and 3837. Of the 
four components expected for the 4274 classification, 
only two were resolved. Taking Schuler’s value of 
3.472 cms. L . for the 6s7p 3 P^level which occurs in 
this transition the separation of the 6s9s 3 S 1 level 
was determined. 

Since the classification of the line 3,837 
is 6s7p 3 P c> — 6s9s*S t the level 3 P*has no hyperfine 
splitting and only two hyperfine components are 
expected. Hence the hyperfine separation of the 
level 6s9s 3 S a was determined directly. 

This level separation was measured by Mr. 
Smith using the line 3869 whose classification is 
6s7p 3 P 1 - 6s9s 3 S a . The four components as expected 
were all resolved on four plates, two were very strong 
but the others were weak although measurable. Hence 
measurements of the hyperfine separations of both the 
6s9s 3 S ± and 6s7p‘ 5 P 1 levels were obtained. The observed 
values were 4.550 eras ~ ± ror the 6s9s 3 S 1 level, and 
4.000 ems* 1 , for the 6s7p 3 P L level separation. 

From a consideration of the observed 
separations of the terms as shown in table II, the 
interaction coefficient A may be determined. The 
results are summarized in the following table ;

Thallium is the element of atomic number 81, 
possessing two isotopes of atomic weights 203 and 205, 
and occupying a position in the sixth row, third 
column of the periodic table of the elements* Singly 
ionized thallium is a two electron system hence the 
general theory developed by Goudsmit, can be applied 
in the interpretation of its hyperfine structure* The 
following discussion will deal with the application of 
both (SL) coupling, and (jj) coupling to several terms.

In applying the formulae to the observed 
structure of the states 6s6d, 6s7d and 6s8d 
configurations, fairly consistent results are obtained. 
The values of a are derived from the formulae (1) and 
(3) since they involve terms independent of the coupling. 
The value of the term a is very small in comparison with 
the value of b, hence it may be neglected, resulting in 
the values shown for b in the third column of each 
table. In each table it is noticed that the values 
of b from equations (1) and (3) are in good agreement, 
furthermore the value of b is seen to increase with 
increasing (quantum number of the d electron, which may 
be explained as a decrease of the screening effect of 
the outer electrons on the inner 6s electron. The 
values of b obtained from equations (2) are not in very 
good agreement with those from equations (1) and (3). 

6snf 

s and f electron configurations give rise to 
the spectral states, represented as 3 F + , 3 F 3 , *F 3 , and 3 F* . 
These configurations are treated in tables IV and V in a 
manner similar to those of the 6snd configuration.

6a 7 s and 6s9s 

When for a two electron system, both electrons 
are in S-orbits, both may couple strongly with the 
nucleus and contribute appreciably to the splitting. 

Two equivalent s-electrons give rise to two spectral 
states 3 S, and*S 0 . The term'S 0 exhibits no fine structure 
since its J value is zero. Since the nuclear spin 
quantum number I of thallium is one half, two hyperfine 
levels are found hence the state 3 S 1 is split into two 
levels with F values of 3/E and 1/E. The value of the 
interval factor Af^J may be expressed as in equation 
( 6 ) of the theory viz: 

A ft>j) = i (& 4s + a qs ) 

McLennan and McLay and Crawford (15) made an estimate of 

-1 -1 
0.196 cm"* .x for a qs of T1 II, hence a 6s = 5.870 cms *b 

They also found that a-, s = 1.S3

A change of the values of b from 5.876 for the 6s 
electron to 0.196 for the 9s electron, indicates a 
rapid decrease in the coupling with the nucleus with 
increasing total quantum number. The higher value of b 
for the 6s9s configuration shows clearly how the

soreening effect of the outer electron on the inner 
6 s electron decreases with increasing principal 
quantum number. However such a rapid change of values, 
is rather strange. 

(jj) coupling 

In tables VII, VIII, IX and X are shown the 
terms, the observed separation factors, and the values 
in terms of the factors for the individual electrons 
expected if the coupling were («jj). Since the 
coupling is not strictly (jj), only the summation 
relations will be considered in each case.

The contribution of the non-valence electron to the 

/> 

interaction energy in each case may be regarded as 
negligible in comparison with the contribution of 

el 

the valence s-ectron. 

Hyperfine structure analysis, besides 
revealing features of the interaction of the nucleus 
with the extra-nuclear electrons, constitutes a 
critical test of the correctness of the term 
classification. The classification is excellently 
confirmed if, for all the classified transitions, the 
observed hyperfine structure agrees with that predicted 
by attributing to each term, specific hyperfine 
structure intervals and F values. The present 
analysis confirmed all the previous classifications 
which were investigated.

Move the adjustment arm olookwise to a point at whioh the oontaot arm fails 
to swing aoross the gap between oontaots when ourrent is applied to the 
field. Then gradually move the adjustment arm baok (oounter-olookwise) 
somewhat past the point at whioh the magnet, when energised, oan pull the

quires more power than when the gap is narrow. The pull-on oontaot should 
always be so adjusted that when the field is energised the armature is pull¬

contact socket, such as the RCA-type UT-541. The socket should be 
mounted so that the tube will operate in a vertical position with 
the base down. 

The ambient temperature of the 872 should not be les3 than o°C 
(32°F) and not more than 50°C (i22°F). The ambient temperature is 
the temperature of the air which,coming into contact with the heated 
parts of the tube, carries off its heat. This temperature is to be 
measured by means of several thermometers placed at a distance of a 
few inches from the base. If the tube is used in a location where 
the circulation of air is restricted, the temperature should be tak¬ 
en adjacent to the filament base and with the thermometer shielded 
so that the effects of directly radiated heat are eliminated. If 
forced-air cooling is U3ed, the ambient temperature is to be mea¬ 
sured by a thermometer in the cooling-air stream before the air 
reaches the tube. The useful life of this tube may be seriously af¬ 
fected if the temperature range of operation is exceeded. Forced vent¬ 
ilation may be necessary to prevent exceeding the maximum allowable 
temperature under all conditions. In any case, adequate circulation 
of air is necessary and forced ventilation may be desirable from the 
standpoint of tube safety factor and life. When operated under load, 
RCA-872 has a characteristic blue glow. In service the bulb will 
eventually darken. This blackening is normal and is not an indica¬ 
tion of the end of tube life.

The coated filament is intended for a-c operation from a sec¬ 
ondary winding of a power transformer. This winding, provided with 
a center-tap or center-tap resistor, should supply at the socket 
terminals the rated voltage of 5.0 volts under average operating 
conditions. The filament voltage, measured at the tube terminals, 
should not vary more than plus or minus 5 per cent from the rated 
value. This tolerance should include the effects of regulation 
caused by transmitter-modulation load as well as the normal power- 
supply regulation. All connections in the filament circuit should 
be of low resistance and of adequate current-carrying capacity. 

A filament voltmeter should be connected permanently across the 
filament circuit at the socket terminals so that the filament volt¬ 
age can be maintained at 5.0 volts. Caution should be observed when 
measuring filament voltage because the filament circuit is at high 
Potential . 

When an RCA-872 is first placed in service, its filament should 
be operated at normal voltage for approximately 15 minutes without 
plate voltage in order to distribute the mercury properly. This 
procedure need not be repeated unless, during subsequent handling, 
mercury is spattered on the filament and plate. 

The filament should always be allowed to come up to operating 
temperature before plate voltage is applied. Ordinarily, this may 
be accomplished by pre-heating the filament for 30 seconds. In radio 
transmitters during "standby" periods, the filament should be keptat 
its rated voltage to avoid delay in "coming back". If this is not 
done, the filament should always be pre-heated for approximately 30 
seconds each time the plate voltage is applied. 

Shields and r-f filter circuits should be provided for the 872 
if it is subjected to extraneous high-voltage or high-frequency 
fields when in operation. These fields tend to produce breakdown 
effects in mercury vapor and are detrimental to tube life and per¬ 
formance. External shielding is employed when the tube is in proxi¬ 
mity to high-voltage, high-frequency fields. R-f filters are employed 
to prevent damage caused by radio-frequency currents which might 
otherwise be fed back into the rectifier tube. 

APPLICATION 

As a single-phase or multi-phase rectifier, RCA-872 should be 
operated under conditions such that the maximum rated values under 
CHARACTERISTICS are not exceeded. Maximum Peak Inverse Voltage and 
Maximum Peak Plate Current are the fundamental limitations in the 
operation of this tube. See definitions, page 3. 

Rectifier circuits particularly suited for use with the 872 are 
shown on page 5. A summary of the approximate conditions which can 
be obtained from the use of these circuits is shown in TABLE I. These 
values are based on sine-wave input and the use of a suitable choke 
preceding any condenser in the filter circuit. Each tabulated value 
of d—c voltage is the effective d—c output voltage from the rectifier

tube(s). Caving to the low tube-voltage drop of approximately IS 
volts, the only reduction in rectified voltage when the load is in¬ 
creased is due to the drop in the transformer and filter windings. 
In the case of the single-phase full-wave (Fig. 2) and three-phase 
full-wave (Fig. 5) circuits, two 872's are used in series. These 
two circuits are desirable where higher d-c voltages are required. 
In the three-phase full-wave circuits, six-phase wave form is ob¬ 
tained. 

Filter circuits of either the condenser-input or the choxe- 
input type may be employed. If the condenser-input type of filter 
is used, special consideration must be given to the instantaneous 
peak value of the a-c input voltage which is about 1.4 times the RMS 
value as measured with an a-c voltmeter. It is important, therefore, 
that the filter condensers (especially the input condenser) have a 
sufficiently high breakdown rating to withstand this instantaneous 
peak value. With the condenser-input type of filter, the peak plate 
current of the tube is considerably higher than the load current. 
When choke input to the filter is used, the peak plate current is 
substantially reduced. This type of circuit is preferable from the 
standpoint of obtaining the maximum continuous d-c output current 
from the 872 under the most favorable conditions. 


Maximum peak inverse voltage Is the highest peak, voltage that a rectifier tube 
can safely stand In the direction opposite to that In which It is designed to 
pass current. It Is the safe arc-back limit with the tube operating within 
the specified temperature range. The relations between the peak Inverse volt¬ 
age, the d-c output voltage, and the RMS value of a-c Input voltage, depend 
largely upon the Individual characteristics of the rectifier circuit and the 
power supply. The presence of line surges, keying surges, or any other trans¬ 
ient, or wave-form distortion may raise the actual peak voltage to a value 
higher than that calculated for sine-wave voltages. Therefore, the actual In¬ 
verse voltage and not the calculated value should be such as not to exceed the 
rated maximum peak Inverse voltage for the rectifier tube. A cathode-ray 
oscillograph or a spark gap connected across the tube Is useful In determining 
the actual peak Inverse voltage. In single-phase, full-wave circuits with 
sine-wave Input, the peak Inverse voltage on a rectifier tube Is approximately 
1.4 times the RMS value of the plate-to-plate voltage applied to the tube. In 
single-phase, half-wave circuits with sine-wave Input and with condenser Input 
to the filter, the peak Inverse voltage may be as high as 2.8 times the RMS 
value of the applied plate voltage. In polyphase circuits, the peak Inverse 
voltage must be calculated for the Individual case. 

Maximum peak plate current Is the highest peak current that a rectifier tube 
can safely stand In the direction In which It Is designed to pass current. The 
safe value of this peak current In hot-cathode types of rectifiers Is a func¬ 
tion of the electron emission available and the duration of the pulsating cur¬ 
rent flow from the rectifier tube during each half cycle. In a given circuit, 
the value of peak plate current Is largely determined by the filter constants. 
If a large choke Is used In the filter circuit next to the rectifier tube(s) , 
the peak plate current Is not much greater than the load current; but If a 
large condenser Is used In the filter next to the rectifier tube(s) , the peak 
current Is often many times the load current. In order to determine accurately 
the peak current In any circuit, the best procedure usually Is to measure It 
with a peak-indicating meter or to use an oscillograph.
