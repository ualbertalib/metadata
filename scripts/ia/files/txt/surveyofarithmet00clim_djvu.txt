AC KNOWLEDGEMENTS 


The writer wishes to acknowledge the assistance and 
guidance of many people who aided him in the preparation of 
this report. The Alberta Committee on Educational Research 
gave financial support to the project. Members of the 
Faculty of Education directed and carried out the testing 
program. Department of Education officials gave their per¬ 
mission to carry out the testing in various schools of the 
province, and arranged for machine scoring of the papers. 

Many superintendents, principals and classroom teach¬ 
ers gave of their time and organizing ability to administer 
the tests used in the study. Clerical workers in the Faculty 
of Education were painstaking and accurate in their compil¬ 
ation of raw data. Members of the staff of the Education 
Library have been most co-operative at all times. 

The members of the thesis committee, Mr. Hodgson, 

Mrs. Rust, Mr. Sparby and Mr. Evenson, have been most helpful 
with kindly and constructive criticism and suggestion. Dr. 

G. M. Dunlop and other members of the Faculty of Education have 
given freely of technical assistance and steady encouragement. 

To all of these the very sincere thanks of the writer 


are offered.

SYNOPSIS 


This thesis, "A Survey of the Arithmetical Achieve¬ 
ment of Grade Five Pupils in Alberta Schools”, is the report 
of an effort to determine the present status of arithmetic in 
Alberta by testing a sample of the grade five pupils from 
each of four different types of schools. An intelligence 
test (Otis Quick-Scoring) and a standardized arithmetic test 
(Iowa Every-Pupil Test of Basic Arithmetic Skills) were ad¬ 
ministered to almost one thousand pupils. The results of the 
tests were studied with the object of finding whether there 
is equality of arithmetical achievement among the children 
from different types of Alberta schools; whether the achieve¬ 
ment of Alberta pupils compares favorably with that of sim¬ 
ilar pupils elsewhere; and whether boys and girls achieve 
equally well in arithmetic. 

When the mean arithmetic scores of the four sub¬ 
samples were compared it was found that the rank order of 
achievement, high to low, was urban, graded rural, town, un¬ 
graded rural and that the mean differences were large enough 
in nearly every case to be statistically significant. The 
intelligence test results paralleled the arithmetic findings. 

The urban, town, and graded rural samples were found 
to have higher median scores on Part III of the arithmetic

test than the published norms for that part. In other 
respects the Alberta medians suffered somewhat by comparison 
with the norms of the test employed. 

Although the girls appeared to be somewhat superior 
to the boys in mean intelligence, as measured by the Otis 
test, the boys showed some superiority in mean arithmetic 
scores. An exception to this was found in the ungraded 
rural sample, where the girls scored somewhat higher than the 
boys. Over the entire sample no significant difference 
between the achievement of boys and girls was found in any 
part of the test. 

It was concluded that the educational opportunities 
of rural children are considerably lower than those of 
children in centralized and urban schools. Certain recom¬ 
mendations are offered, which, if implemented, may tend to 
equalize educational opportunities for nearly all of the 
pupils of the province.

CHAPTER I 


THE PURPOSE OE THE STUDY 

This thesis is the report of a normative-survey type 
of research carried out for the purpose of determining the 
status of arithmetic in Alberta schools. The study was con¬ 
cerned specifically with grade five pupils and it attempted 
to find answers for the following questions: (1) Is there 
equality of achievement in arithmetic among the grade five 
pupils of urban, town, graded rural, and ungraded rural 
schools in Alberta? (2) Does the achievement in arithmetic 
of Alberta grade five pupils compare favorably with that of 
similar pupils in other parts of the country? (3) Are there 
any significant differences between the arithmetical achieve¬ 
ment of boys and the arithmetical achievement of girls in the 
grade five classes of Alberta schools? 

I. NORMATIVE-SURVEY RESEARCH 

The normative-survey type of research used in this 

study is described by Good, Barr, and Scates as 

. . . concerned with ascertaining the conditions which 
prevail in a group of cases chosen for study, and is es¬ 
sentially a method of quantitative description of the gen¬ 
eral characteristics of the group. 1

The same authors suggest that this type of research may be 
very valuable in helping to solve some of the practical prob¬ 
lems of school administrators. The data derived from such 
research are practical because they represent field situa¬ 
tions, and they are usually presented in the language of the 
man in the field. 2 It is hoped that this study may provide 
answers for the questions suggested earlier in this chapter; 
that findings of value to educational workers may be made; 
and that the data accumulated may be of use to other inves¬ 
tigators. The normative-survey seems particularly suitable 
for the purposes cited above, since 

. . . people now demand information about present activ¬ 
ities while that information can still be used to guide 
them in formulating policies and working out plans for 
development in the immediate future. 3 

II. PREVIEW OF THE THESIS 

Chapter II of this report contains a critical review 
of literature related to: (l) the use by others of the test¬ 
ing instruments employed in this investigation; (2) the find¬ 
ings of other researchers regarding uniformity of achievement 
in different types of schools; and (5) the effects of sex 
differences upon arithmetical achievement. Chapter III out¬ 
lines the sampling technique used in the selection of pupils

for the survey, and describes the procedures used in putting 
the data into usable form. The plan of the statistical work 
is also indicated. In Chapter IV the measuring instruments 
which were used are described and evaluated. Chapters V, VI, 
VII, and VIII present the data of the study and the statis¬ 
tical findings, while Chapter IX summarizes the conclusions 
which have been reached and lists recommendations to those 
engaged in educational work. The Bibliography lists refer¬ 
ence material which was found valuable in the preparation of 
the report. Finally, the Appendix contains copies of cor¬ 
respondence relating to the selection of the sample. Copies 
of the tests used will also be found in this section.

CHAPTER II 


RELATED READINGS 

This chapter records the results of a search of edu¬ 
cational literature relating to the subject of this thesis. 
Special attention was given to articles which reported sur¬ 
veys of arithmetical achievement in different types of schools 
Several writers had reported on the use of the Otis Quick- 
Scoring Mental Ability Tests. A number of investigators had 
made use of the Iowa Every-Pupil Test of Basic Arithmetic 
Skills. Their reports were located and given close study. 

The summary of the readings is presented in three parts: In¬ 
telligence, Arithmetic Surveys, and Sex Differences. 

I. INTELLIGENCE OF URBAN AND RURAL PUPILS 

John T. Wahlquist^ conducted an extensive survey of 
education in Utah in 1926. He found that the mean intelli¬ 
gence quotients of rural children in grades three, four, and 
seven were considerably lower than those for urban children 
in the same grades. A correlation coefficient of .37 between 
intelligence scores and achievement scores was found. The

Children," Elementary School Journal., 27: 682-34, 1926-27.

consideration of accomplishment ratios showed, hov^ever, that 
children from the rural schools were making more satisfactory 
academic progress than were the urban children. 

The authors of a study of rural children in Indiana 
concluded that ordinary group tests did not give rural child¬ 
ren a fair chance because of the verbal nature of such tests. 

It was suggested that ”... performance tests and material 

2 

more relevant to their environment are needed • • •” With 
this conclusion in mind, Clairette P. Armstrong* * 5 carried out 
an experiment comparing a rural-village sample of 115 pupils 
between the ages of nine and fourteen, in grades four to 
eight, with a sample of 328 pupils in New York City, at the 
same age and grade levels. (A rural-village was one situated 
in a rural community, and having fewer than 2500 inhabitants). 
Tests used were: The Otis Intermediate Group Test, form A; 
the Army Individual Performance Scale; and The Army Beta Test. 
The results of the testing prompted the investigator to state 
as follows: 

The data from this study lead to the conclusions that

rural-village and urban children do not differ in intel¬ 
ligence, either verbal or concrete, if of American par¬ 
entage, of equivalent occupational class, and of equal 
school opportunity. 4 5 6 


A comparison of the brightness of country and city 
high school pupils was carried out by Hinds.'*' The sample 
groups came from one city, six towns employing between twelve 
and twenty teachers, two small towns where there were seven 
and nine teachers, and four rural schools. The Otis Group 
Test, form A, was used for the purpose of gathering median 
indices of brightness for the four groups. The rank order 
(highest first) was found to be: city, large towns, small 
towns, rural. Twenty-three and one-half points on the index 
of brightness scale separated the rural and the city sample. 
The investigator concluded: 

All of the available evidence points to the conclusion 
that the mental traits, whatever they may be, which are 
measured by the Otis Group Test, exist to a less degree 
in the average rural child than in the average child of 
the city. 


Still another study comparing the abilities of urban 
and rural children was conducted by Eugene L. Shepard, who

measured nonverbal abilities. 7 In his study, fifty-seven 

boys and the same number of girls from two small rural cities 

in Kansas were matched child-for-chiId with children from a 

representative school in New iork City. All of the subjects 

were eleven, twelve, or thirteen years of age* The matching 

was based on occupational level of the parents, chronological 

age, sex, and birthplace (American or foreign). Shepard was 

attempting to test the following hypothesis: 

Mental and physical differences between children from di¬ 
verse culture groups may result, in part, from the type 
and variety of environmental contacts and stimulations 
which are common to the geographical section of the 
country. 8 

The investigator believed that verbal tests could not measure 
all of the traits and abilities which comprise general abil¬ 
ity. For his experiment, five tests were used. These were: 
Minnesota Assembly Tests; Minnesota Spatial Relations Test, 
in two parts; Minnesota Paper Form Board Tests; Kwalwasser- 
Dykema Music Tests; and Otis Quick-Scoring Mental Ability 
Test, Bet© A. Urban pupils attained higher means on Spatial 
Relations Error Scores and on the Otis Test. On three of the 
other four tests, the rural pupils had significantly higher 
means than did the urban pupils. In summing up the results

of the experiment, Shepard stated: 

From the results of this study there is an indication 
that the common assumption that one regional group is in¬ 
tellectually superior or inferior to another is unjusti¬ 
fied. Rather, the performance of the different groups 
should be evaluated in terms of the degree to which they 
possess specific traits and abilities. The study sup¬ 
ports previous investigations in finding urban children 
superior verbally. Mechanically, however, rural children 
score higher than similar urban groups. It is possible 
to assign the reasons for such differences to environmen¬ 
tal demands and practice. 9 


In summarizing the findings of the investigators cited 
in this section it becomes apparent that the use of a group 
verbal test to measure general ability may produce results 
which are misleading or are subject to misinterpretation. 

This is particularly to be expected if the test is used with 
groups having wide differences in their environment and ex¬ 
perience. G-avinehuk^^ studied the relation between the re¬ 
sults of intelligence tests and academic achievement. He 
concluded that many group tests, of which the Otis is one, 
may be depended upon to provide a prediction of the probable 
rate of a pupil’s progress through school. On this basis, 
the educator’s use of group tests for measuring brightness 
appears to be justifiable.

II. ARITHMETIC SURVEYS 


Undoubtedly many investigations similar to the present 
survey of arithmetical achievement have been made. Unfortun¬ 
ately, few of these have been reported in educational publi¬ 
cations. The testing program instituted by the Curriculum 
Branch of the Alberta Department of Education resembles the 
present study in several details. That part of the program 
dealing with arithmetic accuracy and arithmetic problems is 
reviewed here. 

An arithmetic test prepared by the Curriculum Branch 
was given a pilot run with three hundred pupils representing 
a cross-section of the grade six school population of the 
province. The results of the test were found to have a co¬ 
efficient of .75 when correlated with the Stanford Intermed¬ 
iate Arithmetic Test, form D. The locally prepared test was 
then administered to the complete grade six population of the 
province, in the middle of March, 1947. 

The same test was administered to a sampling of grade 
six pupils in 1953. The pupils were selected from five cities 
and four divisions or counties. Mearly one thousand urban 
children and the same number of children from the counties 
or divisions were tested. At the same time, a test used in 
British Columbia was administered. In all cases, urban

10 


samples scored significantly higher than the others. When 
the pupils were further classified and given percentile rank¬ 
ing based on their mean arithmetic scores, the order was 
urban, town, village, ungraded rural, correspondence branch. 

The evidence presented in Chapter VI of this present 
study appears to corroborate the findings of the Department 
of Education. As the population of the various districts is 
reduced, arithmetical achievement suffers a corresponding de¬ 
cline. 

III. DIFFERENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEX 

The statistical and educational records of 338 high 

school students, accumulated over a period of five years, 

provided the raw material for a study made by Lund.- 1 * 1 He 

found that boys do a little better in arithmetic than girls, 

although over the whole high school curriculum the girls are 

slightly superior. He suggests, 

That girls between the ages of nine and fifteen should 
tend on the average to surpass boys may be due entirely 
to the fact that they mature earlier than boys. ... It 
is possible that the mastery of girls is more verbal or 
rote and less logical than that of the boys . . .

By way of contrast, Stroud and Lindquist, in a study 
made during the years 1932 to 1939, found that high school 
boys were superior in most subjects. The study of Stroud and 
Lindquist involved a sampling of the tests of fifty thousand 
pupils in twenty-six projects carried out over the eight-year 
period. The Iowa Every-Pupil Tests of Basic Skills were used 
by the same two investigators in another testing project, 
this time with a large sample in grades three through eight. 

It was found that the girls had somewhat higher means in most 
tests in all grades except in Basic Arithmetic Skills. In 
grade four the girls were slightly ahead in Arithmetic but 
they were behind in other grades. The differences between 
the performances of girls and boys were not significant at 
any grade. 

Willard G. Olson says, in part, "A fairly constant 
finding in the elementary grades is that . . . boys tend to 
show superiority in arithmetic. . . . Many of the differences 
reported between boys and girls are in one sense probably not 
sex differences but maturity differences." 14 This statement is 
in agreement with that of Lund, quoted on the previous page.

In a project carried out for The Alberta Teachers’ 
Association, Sansom 1 ^ tested grade ten students to determine 
whether their preparation for high school was improving or 
declining during the years 1943 to 1948. Every type of 
school in which grade ten was taught was tested. No signifi¬ 
cant differences in the mathematical achievement of girls 
and boys were observed during the period mentioned, although 
ff In an earlier study . . . the boys stood well ahead of the 
girls and the boys’ lead tended to increase with the dif¬ 
ficulty of the problem.” 16 

The final references in this section on sex differ¬ 
ences are also to studies made in Alberta. The Department of 
Education Surveys of 1947 and 1953 reported no significant 
differences in arithmetical achievement which might be at¬ 
tributable to sex. Tanner 17 tested 217 girls and 210 boys in 
Edmonton grade five classrooms. Three tests were administer¬ 
ed: an arithmetic problem test then in common use; a test

ferences was stated as follows: "All lines of evidence ex¬ 
amined point to one conclusion, that the boys excel in both 
types of problem solving, although the degree of superiority 
is not outstanding, t,xo 

The authors cited in the foregoing section are in gen¬ 
eral agreement that there is little, if any difference in the 
arithmetical abilities of girls and boys. Where small dif¬ 
ferences are found, they usually tend to favor the boys. The 
suggestion has been made that if slight superiority of the 
boys is found, it is often in the area of problem-solving. 

If the studies reviewed in this chapter have provided 
valid findings, and if the sample used by the present inves¬ 
tigator is typical, then certain outcomes of this survey may 
be forecast. It may be expected that urban pupils will show 
higher mental ability, as measured by the Otis Quick-Scoring 
Test, than other parts of the sample. There is likelihood 
that better mean scores in arithmetic will be earned by urban 
pupils and that those in ungraded rural schools will achieve 
least well. There is little probability that significant 
differences in the arithmetical achievement of boys and girls 
will be noted.

CHAPTER III 


THE RESEARCH DESIGN 

Representatives of the Committee on Educational Re¬ 
search, Faculty of Education, University of Alberta, working 
with this writer, decided that for the purposes of this sur¬ 
vey one thousand grade five pupils randomly chosen from four 
categories of Alberta schools would constitute a suitable 
sample. The method of securing the sample, the method of 
collecting the data, and the statistical procedures will be 
discussed in this chapter. 

I. SELECTION OF THE SAMPLE 

Schools were classified as urban, town, graded rural, 
and ungraded rural. A description of each classification 
follows: (l) urban—those found in the cities of the prov¬ 

ince; (2) town—those located in the independent towns listed 
in the Annual Report of the Department of Education, 1953.^" 
(No town in which fewer than 200 pupils were enrolled was 
considered). (3) graded rural—-centralized divisional 
schools at which at least three hundred children from farm 
homes were in attendance; (4) ungraded rural--one-teacher

rural schools. 

In determining which cities, which towns, and which 
school divisions should be selected for testing, random sam¬ 
pling procedures were employed. It should be noted that 
Tt . . . a random sample is one selected in such a fashion 
that every member of the population has an equal chance of 
being chosen.” 2 It is believed that the techniques used were 
adequate for obtaining representative samples in each classi¬ 
fication. In the matter of securing an unbiased cross sec¬ 
tion of a larger group, Garrett states as follows: 

The criteria for randomness in a sample are met when (l) 
every individual (or animal or thing) in the population 
or supply has the same chance of being chosen for the 
sample; and (2) when the selection of one individual or 
thing in no way influences the choice of another. 3 

The samples chosen, totalling nearly one thousand pupils from 

one hundred grade five classes, meet as closely as possible 

the criteria of randomness cited. 

II. COLLECTION OF THE DATA 

When the sample had been determined, sufficient copies 
of the following materials for each pupil in each class chos-

en were forwarded: Otis Quick-Scoring Mental Ability Test, 
Beta, Cm; Iowa Every-Pupil Test D—Basic Arithmetic Skills-- 
Form 0; answer sheets suitable for machine scoring; and the 
personal data sheet. The tests, administered early in May, 
1955, were returned to the University of Alberta, where they 
were scored. The test results and various data from the per¬ 
sonal data sheets were tabulated on assembly sheets. These 
provided the raw material for subsequent work. 

III. STATISTICAL PROCEDURES 

In order to determine the status of arithmetical 
achievement and to determine to what extent sex may be a fac¬ 
tor, it is necessary to compare the means and variabilities 
of the total scores and sub-scores in each of the categories 
of schools in the sample. These must be sub-divided according 
to sex. Thus, for each of the categories of schools, tally 
sheets were prepared for: Total Iowa score; Total Iowa, boys; 
Total Iowa, girls; Part I; Part I, boys; Part I, girls; Part 
II; Part II, boys; Part II, girls; Part III; Part III, boys; 
Part III, girls. 

From the data on the tally sheets, means and standard 
deviations for each of the sections mentioned above were com¬ 
puted. fhe study of the differences between various pairs of 
means comprises the major part of the chapters in which data 
are presented.

IY. SUMMARY 

This chapter has described how the cases needed for 
the survey were selected by random sampling methods from four 
categories of schools.; The method of accumulating the data 
to be used in determining the status of arithmetical achieve¬ 
ment of Alberta pupils in grade five has been outlined. 
References have been made to the methods of processing the 
raw data. The next chapter will introduce, describe, and 
evaluate the testing instruments which provided the basic raw 
data for the study.

CHAPTER IV 


THE TESTING INSTRUMENTS 

In this chapter will be presented an evaluation of the 
testing instruments used in the research study. They were: 
The Otis Qjiick-Scoring Mental Ability Tests, Beta Test, Form 
Cm for Grades Four to Nine, 1 and The Iowa Every-Pupil Tests 
of Basic Skills, New Edition, Test D: Basic Arithmetic Skills 
Form 0, Advanced Battery, for Grades Five to Nine. 2 These 
will be referred to in the following pages as "The Otis Test" 
and "The Iowa Test", respectively. 

I. THE OTIS TEST 

The Otis Q,uick-Scoring Mental Ability Test: Beta, 

Form Cm, is classified as a self-administering group verbal 
test and requires thirty minutes of writing time. Although 
group tests permit of uniform administration and are practi¬ 
cal and economical, their verbal aspect may handicap subjects 
who have ear or eye defects. Those who have reading dif-

ficulties, or are not familiar with the English language may 

also find themselves at a disadvantage. Cronhach states: 

The group test is based on the assumption that every per¬ 
son understands tile nature and purpose of the testing and 
wants to do his best; wherever these ideal conditions are 
not met results are invalid. 

The author, Arthur S. Otis, states that it is impos¬ 
sible to measure mental ability with complete accuracy, but 
that in the preparation of his test n . . . the aim has been 
for the most part to choose that kind of question which de¬ 
pends as little as possible on schooling and as much as pos- 

4 

sible on thinking.” A reliability coefficient of .96 is 
claimed as the result of correlating two forms of the test. 
Other coefficients resulting from the use of the Spearman- 
Brown formula are cited. This latter method of gauging the 
consistency of a test is not favored by Cronbach, who indi¬ 
cates that inflated coefficients often result from the use of 
the split-halves method with a speeded test. A measure of 
the test’s validity, i.e., the degree to which it measures 
what it purports to measure, was obtained by correlating Otis 
results with those of the eight sections of the Stanford

Achievement Test, Form J. These results, obtained from four 
hundred subjects in grade five, range from .564 and .673 for 
arithmetic computation and arithmetic reasoning respectively, 
to .827 for word meaning. Similar coefficients were obtained 

a 

with the same number of pupils in grade eight. 

Scoring of the Otis test may be done by mechanical 
means or by the use of a specially prepared stencil which is 
so designed that only correct responses are visible when the 
stencil is placed over the answer sheet. Conversion of raw 
scores into Beta Intelligence Quotients is accomplished by 
first determining from a table the normal score corresponding 
to a given chronological age. The amount by which the test 
score exceeds or is less than the normal score is added to or 
subtracted from one hundred to give the Beta I.Q. 

The Otis test appears to meet the criterion of useful¬ 
ness required for this survey. It is not too long; it may 
be administered by relatively untrained personnel; scoring 
of the test is easy; the cost, about twelve cents per pupil, 
is reasonable; and its degree of reliability and validity 
make it a suitable instrument for measuring brightness, or 
for predicting the probable rate of a pupil’s progress 
through school.

II. THE IOWA TEST 

Test D: Basic Arithmetic Skills—Form 0, Advanced 
Battery, is part of the complete battery of Iowa Every-Pupil 
Tests of Basic Skills which are designed to measure skills 
basic to language, arithmetic, reading, and work-study. Test 
D is given in three parts: Part I, Vocabulary and Fundamental 
Knowledge; Part II, A. Whole Numbers and Fractions, and B. 
Percentage and Decimals; Part III, Problems. The total 
working time of sixty-eight minutes may be broken convenient¬ 
ly into two sessions. The Examiner 1 s Manual 7 gives clear and 
adequate directions for the administration of the test and, 
in addition, contains certain suggestions for remedial work. 
Included is a classification of each item of Part I of the 
test in terms of the skill tested by each. The skills are: 

Reading and writing numbers; knowledge of common qualita¬ 
tive measures; knowledge of numerical facts, terms, and 
symbols; knowledge of common geometric figures and terms; 
ability to estimate or describe quantitatively; ability 
to compare the size of numbers and fractions; knowledge 
of the number system; knowledge of common processes. 8

makes a number of comments, of which these are quoted: 

The items in Part il are computational examples involving 
whole numbers, fractions, decimals . . . and percentage. 

. . . The examples are . . . within the area of school 
utility, except for a few posers included in order to 
test adequately the pupils who are unusually skillful in 
computation . . . The problems in Part III are concerned 
with more plausible and more practical situations than 
are frequently utilized. Isolated problems and related 
problems are both presented, 9 


The Iowa answer papers may be machine scored or marked 
by hand. A special answer sheet is available if tests are to 
be machine scored. As in the case of the Otis test, hand 
scoring is facilitated by the use of a specially prepared 
stencil. Tables are provided in the manual^ for converting 
raw part scores and raw total scores into grade-equivalent 
scores. Grade-equivalent scores may be converted into per¬ 
centile ranks, and age-equivalents to grade-equivalents by 
using other appropriate tables. 

Use of the Iowa test for the grade five sample of the 
present study seems satisfactory. No pupil was able to 
answer all of the questions on any part, and only eighteen 
out of nine hundred seventy-five scored zero on any part. 

One reviewer in an earlier edition of buros suggested that

the Advanced Battery might not be suitable for grade five 
pupils. 11 Test D was not specifically mentioned. Other com¬ 
ments from the same source are of interest. William A. 
Brownell, Chairman, Department of Education, Duke University, 
Durham, North Carolina, says, 

. . . the items intended to test vocabulary and fundamen¬ 
tal operations are well selected. The examples of Part 
II seem to agree with common school practice for the 
grades 5 to 9. The verbal problems (Part III) relate to 
common experiences of children and to common social ap¬ 
plications . . . The Advanced Battery is to be commend¬ 
ed ... 12 


Leroy H. Schnell, Department of Mathematics, State 
Teachers* College, Indiana, Pennsylvania, states with refer¬ 
ence to Part I of the Iowa test: 

. . . this part of the test will be heartily approved by 
teachers who believe that much of the difficulty which 
children encounter in arithmetic is due to lack of under¬ 
standing of the basic meanings and concepts. 1,5 

He speaks disparagingly of the commonly-held belief that the 

pupil who can obtain correct answers must necessarily 

understand the processes and concepts involved, and he 

asserts further, ”... tests which require pupils to

compare numbers, and which make an effort to determine their 
understanding of basic concepts, should have a salutary ef¬ 
fect on arithmetic instruction." 14 


For the purposes of the present survey, Test D appears 
to have been a good selection. Its cost was reasonable; ad¬ 
ministration time was not unduly long; the instructions were 
clear and concise; and graphic representations of the score- 
frequencies are quite symmetrical. The comment of Gustave J. 
Froelich, Assistant Director and Assistant Professor, Bureau 
of Institutional Eesearch, University of Illinois, Urbana, 
Illinois, suitably sums up this chapter: 


Some features of the Iowa tests may limit their use. The 
norms were based on a Midwestern population; the majority 
of the schools in the standardization sample were from 
Iowa . . . Taken as a whole, the Iowa liverjr-Pupil Tests 
of Basie Skills represent one of the best series available 
for measuring many fundamental skills. They deserve 
careful consideration in any school system which is plan¬ 
ning a systematic evaluation program. 15

III. COMPARISON OF STANDARD DEVIATIONS 

Before proceeding to test the mean differences for 
significance, it is in order to test the standard deviation 
differences for significance so that it may be stated with 
confidence whether or not the four sub-samples come from the 
same homogeneous population. Table III, page 27, displays 
the data used in comparing standard deviations of various 
samples with each other. The critical ratios and levels of 
significance are indicated.

letter in column (4) indicates that the difference is in 
favor or the sample designated. The following formulas were 
employed: 




(N is the number of cases in the sample; and Mg are the 
means of the two samples under consideration). 

The pair of samples having the smallest combined N is 
found in row f, graded rural-ungraded rural, where the com¬ 
bined N is not quite 400. From a t-table it may be seen that 
for 400 degrees of freedom a critical ratio larger than 1.97 
would not occur through chance or sampling errors in more 
than five cases in one hundred, and a critical ratio larger 
than 2.59 would not be expected to occur more than once per 
hundred times, if the true difference were zero. 3 " 

Examination of Table IV, page 28, reveals that, with 
the exception of town-ungraded rural (row e), the critical 
ratios indicate highly significant mean differences. The 
conclusion must be accepted that the differences in mean in¬ 
telligence scores are real differences: they are of such mag¬ 
nitude that they would not likely have occurred by accidents

of chance or sampling errors. The critical ratio in the case 
of the difference between town and ungraded rural (Table IV, 
page 28, row e) is shown to be slightly significant at the 
.05 level. The difference is real, but as yet unexplained. 

Table IV, page 28, may be summarized as follows: in 
respect of the mean scores obtained on the Otis Intelligence 
test,, the urban sample is shown to be superior to the graded 
rural, town, and ungraded rural samples; the graded rural 
sample is superior to the town and ungraded rural samples; 
the town sample may be slightly superior to the ungraded 
rural sample. 

Reasons for the differences in intelligence are diffi¬ 
cult to determine. The author of the Otis test states, in 
part, ” . . . any test which involves the use of language can 
measure mental ability only to the extent to which we may as¬ 
sume that pupils of the same age may have had approximately 
the same opportunity to learn.” 2 T. J. Reid, after a study 
of current writings on the subject, was able to state with 
confidence, ”... there is . . . adequate evidence to sug¬ 
gest that children of foreign parentage suffer a definite 
handicap in English Language achievement.” 3 (footnote, p. 31),

Reid’s survey of other studies, and the results of his own, 

prompted him to make this statement: 

Though the degree of correlation between intelligence and 
language achievement varies from one investigation to an¬ 
other, nevertheless, a substantial positive correlation 
does exist in every case. However, it is of importance 
to note that this relationship appears to maintain re¬ 
gardless of the geographic or ethnic areas from which the 
pupils being tested are chosen. 3 4 


A check of the sub-samples of the present study was 
made to determine the proportion of pupils in each sub-sample 
claiming a language other than English as the language of the 
home. 7.4 percent of the urban sample, 29.4 percent of the 
town sample, 18.2 percent of the graded rural sample, and 13.5 
percent of the ungraded rural sample indicated that the lan¬ 
guage of their homes was other than English. The apparent 
preponderance of the second language in the town sample seems 
to have been caused by the fact that from the eight towns in 
the sample, the randomization scheme selected three in which 
the school population was predominantly French and in which 
the French language was the language of the home. 

The extent to which the differences in I.Q. between 
samples may affect the Iowa test result cannot yet be

sults of the Iowa arithmetic test. 




CHAPTER VI 


PRESENTATION OE DATA CONTINUED 

This chapter begins a presentation of data basic to 
the main phase of this thesis, viz., a study of the results 
of the Iowa Every-Pupil test to determine if there is equal¬ 
ity of achievement in arithmetic among the grade five pupils 
of urban, town, graded rural, and ungraded rural schools in 
Alberta. 

The reader will recall that the Iowa Every-Pupil Test 
D: Basic Arithmetic Skills, Form 0, Advanced Battery, is in 
three parts. Maximum raw scores are: Part I, Vocabulary and 
Fundamental Knowledge, 40; Part II, Whole Numbers, Fractions, 
Percentage and Decimals, 33; Part III, Problems, 31; Total, 
104. Throughout this chapter Iowa scores will be designated 
"Part I", "Part II", "Part III", and "Total" respectively. 

The first major section of the chapter will be concerned with 
Iowa Total scores; other sections will deal with part scores. 
Tables will be used to show: distribution of pupils to whom 
the Iowa Test was administered (Table V, page 34); comparison 
of the standard deviations of the sub-samples as a test for 
homogeneity of variance (Table VI, page 35); and comparison 
of the mean Iowa scores of the sub-samples (Table VII, page 
36).

I. DISTRIBUTION 

Table Y, below, shows the distribution of pupils to 
whom the Iowa Test was administered in urban, town, graded 
rural, and ungraded rural schools. It will be noted that the 
figures therein do not correspond exactly with those in Table 
I, page 25. Inasmuch as the Otis Test and the Iowa Test were 
not administered on the same day, absenteeism could account 
for the small differences which appear.

The table may be interpreted as follows: (l) there is 
no difference in the achievement of urban pupils and graded 
rural pupils; (2) the achievement of urban pupils is superior 
to that of town and ungraded rural pupils; (3) town pupils 
are superior to ungraded rural pupils; (4) the achievement of 
graded rural pupils surpasses that of town pupils and ungrad¬ 
ed rural pupils. In order of superiority of achievement the 

























37 


four sub-samples would rank thus: urban, graded rural, town, 
ungraded rural. 

III. IOWA PART I: VOCABULARY AND FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE 

It is of interest to know whether mean scores in Parts 
I, II, and III of the Iowa test differ significantly from 
sample to sample as did the mean scores of the Iowa Total 
test. The check for homogeneity of variance of the sub¬ 
samples, Part I, revealed that the standard deviation of the 
ungraded rural sample was significantly different, at the .01 
level, from that of the town sample and from that of the 
graded rural sample. These samples may be from different 
populations. However, the difference between the means of the 
town sample and ungraded rural samples was non-significant, and 
the difference between the means of the graded rural and un¬ 
graded rural samples was barely significant at the .05 level. 
Other comparisons of means showed that: (l) the urban sample 
was superior to the town, graded rural, and ungraded rural 
sample, and (2) there was no real difference between the means 
of the town and ungraded rural samples. 

A tabular representation of the findings relative to 
mean differences which are outlined above, is given in Table 
VIII, page 38.

is ability on the whole test, A different order is found 
when the means of Part II of the test are compared.

of the standard deviations of the four sub-samples (not tab¬

the urban sample is significantly higher than the means of 
the town and ungraded rural samples; (3) the graded rural 
mean was significantly higher, at the .01 level, than the 
means of the town and ungraded rural samples; (4) the mean of 
the town sample was significantly higher, at the .05 level, 
than that of the ungraded rural sample; (5) the difference 
between the means of the urban and graded rural samples was 
too small to be significant; (6) the rank order, high to low, 
is: graded rural, urban, town, ungraded rural. 

V. IOWA PART III: PROBLEMS 

The results of Part III of the Iowa test (see Table X, 
page 41), show some of the characteristics of the section on 
whole numbers, fractions, percentage and decimals. Graded 
rural means are higher than urban means, though not signifi¬ 
cantly. Highly significant differences at the .01 level exist 
between urban and ungraded rural, between town and ungraded 
rural, and between graded rural and ungraded rural, with the 
difference in favor of the first named in each case. The 
superiority of the urban sample over the town sample, and that 
of graded rural over town, were almost significant at the .01 
level. Critical ratios of 2.59 would have been significant. 
The test for homogeneity of variance revealed no significant

Table XI, below, presents in condensed form a composite 
of Tables VII, VIII, IX, and X. The significance, if any, of 
the difference between means of each combination of sub-sam¬

ungraded rural scores throughout, and better than the graded 
rural score on Part I; (2) graded rural mean scores were 
higher than town means except on Part I, and were higher than 
ungraded rural mean scores in every case; (3) the town means 
were higher than the ungraded rural means except on Part I, 
where there were no significant differences; (4) again with 
the exception of Part I, urban and graded rural mean scores 
did not differ significant!y. 

These findings make it possible to state, with some 
degree of confidence, that there is inequality of achievement 
in arithmetic among the grade five pupils in urban, town, 
graded rural, and ungraded Alberta schools. 

In almost every instance the rank order of the sub¬ 
samples, based on Iowa mean scores, is: urban, graded rural, 
town, ungraded rural. It will be noted that this is the same 
order as for the Otis intelligence test (see page 26). Suc¬ 
cess with the Iowa test, as well as with the Otis test, de¬ 
pends to some extent upon the ability of the pupil to inter¬ 
pret the printed word. This fact may help to explain the ap¬ 
parent correlation between intelligence scores and arithmetic 
scores. An intelligence test score, however, is often affect¬ 
ed by a child's experiences. Test makers may unwittingly 
handicap rural children by failing to include proportionate 
numbers of items which fit rural situations.

The following are suggested as possible reasons for 
the lower ranking of the ungraded rural sample: unfamiliar¬ 
ity with test-writing techniques; lower intelligence as meas¬ 
ured by the Otis intelligence test; irregular attendance at 
school because of inclement weather, impassable roads, long 
distance from school, or pressure of domestic and other duties; 
inadequacy of instruction attributable to distribution of the 
teacher’s time over many grades, or to poor qualifications of 
the teacher, or to inability of the district to provide a 
person with any teaching qualifications. The factors enumer¬ 
ated illustrate some of the educational disadvantages to 
which children in ungraded rural schools are subject. 

As far as can be ascertained, the disproportionate 
number of bi-lingual pupils in the town sample is the major 
factor to be considered in accounting for the position of 
this group on the ranking scale. 

The position of the graded rural sample, second only 
to the urban sample, may reflect some of the advantages which 
the centralized schools are able to provide for their rural 
children. .Regular attendance is possible; schools are ade¬ 
quately equipped, and staffed with qualified teachers; the 
number of grades per teacher is not large. These factors 
place the educational advantages of the pupil in the graded 
rural school on a par with those of the urban pupils.

CHAPTER VII 


ALBERTA RESULTS COMPARED WITH IOWA NORMS 

Chapter VI was concerned with the question of whether 
there is equality of arithmetical achievement among the grade 
five pupils of urban, town, graded rural, and ungraded 
schools of the province. A second phase of the study to de¬ 
termine the status of arithmetic in Alberta schools is that 
of comparing the results from the Alberta samples with the 
norms of the Iowa test. This chapter will attempt to find 
out if the achievement of the pupils tested in the present 
investigation compares favorably with that of the standard¬ 
ization sample of the Iowa test. 

Certain difficulties attended this task. No means or 
standard deviations for the standardization sample were avail¬ 
able and grade-equivalent scores had been converted into per¬ 
centiles. In addition, the median grade-equivalent in the 
Iowa study was 5.9, while that of the Alberta study was 5.8. 

It was thus necessary to establish approximate standard de¬ 
viations for the Iowa Total and for Parts I, II, and III of 
the test. 

Since it is knovvn that approximately 68 percent of the 
cases in a normal distribution are to be found under that 
portion of the normal curve contained by one standard devia-

tion to the right and to the left of the mean, grade-equi¬ 
valents for percentile 84 and percentile 16 were found from 

Table II of the Examiner’s Manual 1 2 and converted into raw 

2 

scores in the table headed "Form 0". The difference be¬ 
tween the two raw scores was halved to give an approximate 
standard deviation. Repetition of this procedure gave ap¬ 
proximate standard deviations as follows: for the total Iowa 
score, 10.8; for Part I, 5.29; for Part II, 5.45; and for 
Part III, 3.98. Median scores for the parts of the Iowa test 
were taken as those corresponding to the 5.8 scores from the 
same table. Thus median Iowa scores were considered to be: 
Total, 30; Part I, 10.5; Part II, 11; Part ill, 9.5. Refer¬ 
ence to the Manual of General Information 3 discloses that the 
number of pupils in the standardization sample was approxi¬ 
mately eight thousand. Material is thus at hand with which 
to test for significance the differences between the medians 
of the Iowa sample and the medians of the corresponding parts 
of the test for the whole Alberta sample and for the sub¬ 
samples urban, town, graded rural, and ungraded rural.

ratios may not be completely reliable. Examination of Table 
XIII shows that, in the twenty comparisons made: (1) the Al¬ 
berta medians were inferior to the standardization medians in 
eleven instances; (2) in six cases there were no significant 
median differences; and (3) in three cases, on Part III of the 
test, the Alberta medians were significantly superior to the 
standardization sample medians. 

It should be noted that: 

The schools involved in the Iowa programs are located 
in communities that range in population from a few hun¬ 
dred to more than 200,000, the majority numbering be¬ 
tween 1,000 and 50,000. All are graded public schools; 
no one-room rural schools are included. 

In answering the question implied at the beginning of 
this chapter it would appear that the achievement of the Al¬ 
berta pupils as represented by this sample was inferior to 
that of the grade five pupils used in formulating the Iowa 
norms. This statement must be qualified by reference to the 
quotation immediately above. There is no readily available 
method of assessing the effect upon the Iowa norms of intro¬ 
ducing into the sample a group of children from ungraded one- 
room schools proportionate to the ungraded rural group of the 
Alberta sample.

CHAPTER VIII 


SEX DIFFERENCES 

The third of the questions presented at the beginning 
of this study was: "Are there any significant differences be¬ 
tween the arithmetical achievement of boys and the arithmet¬ 
ical achievement of girls in the grade five classes of Al¬ 
berta schools? This chapter presents the findings pertaining 
to that question. 

The distribution of pupils who wrote the Otis Quick- 
Scoring Test of Mental Ability, Beta, is shown in Table I, 
page 25. The Beta Intelligence quotients of the girls were 
higher than those of the boys for each of the sub-samples and 
for the total sample. However, the differences were not sig¬ 
nificant except in the ungraded rural sub-sample and in the 
total sample. The girls’ mean I. Q., ungraded rural sub- 
sample, was 3.75 points higher than that of the boys. This 
difference was significant at the .05 level. The difference 
in the total sample was 2.55 points, significant at the .01 
level. The girls appear to be somewhat superior to the boys 
in mean intelligence as measured by the Otis Quick-Scoring 
Test of Mental Ability, Beta. 

The apparent superiority in intelligence is not re¬ 
flected in the girls’ scores on the arithmetic test. It is

interesting to note that of the fourteen items in which the

in the case of the girls, four of the items demonstrating 
superiority were in the ungraded rural sub-sample. Table

The findings presented in this chapter relative to the 
arithmetical achievement of boys and of girls may be stated 
as follows: based on the results of the use of the Iowa Every- 
Pupil Test of Basic Arithmetic Skills, Eorm 0, Advanced, with 
four samples of grade five pupils (l) the girls in the ungrad¬ 
ed rural sample were slightly, but not significantly, superior 
to the boys; (2) the boys of the urban sample had significant¬ 
ly better mean scores than the girls; (3) except for the urban 
sample, there were no significant differences between the 
arithmetical achievement of the boys and the girls.

CHAPTER IX 


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

The Otis Q,uiek>Scoring Test of Mental Ability, Beta, 
Form C, was administered to nearly one thousand grade five 
children from various types of Alberta schools. The mean 
intelligence quotient, as measured by this instrument, was 
found to be 101.47, with standard deviation 12.49 and stan¬ 
dard error of the mean .599. The four sub-samples have 
been shown to belong, statistically, to the same homogeneous 
population. Significant differences exist between the mean 
intelligence scores of urban and rural children. The ap¬ 
parent superiority of the urban sample may be affected by a 
number of factors. City pupils may be more accustomed to 
the use of standardized tests, and their familiarity with 
test procedures may tend to raise their scores. One of the 
limitations of any group verbal test is that it cannot test 
all of the factors which make up general intelligence. Thus 
the pupil whose experiences have been more manual and mani¬ 
pulative than verbal may be unable to achieve as well as his 
urban counterpart on a verbal test. Selective migration may 
also contribute to the differences observed. The test results 
indicate that the probability of academic success of the child 
in a single-teacher school is somewhat less than that of a 
child in an urban school.

When the Iowa Every-Pupil Test of Basic Arithmetic 
Skills was used as a measuring instrument, the results in¬ 
dicated that there is not equality of achievement among the 
children of the four sub-samples urban, town, graded rural, 
and ungraded rural. Except for the difference between mean 
scores on the whole test of the urban and graded rural sam¬ 
ples, the differences are all significantly large. Inequal¬ 
ities of arithmetical achievement as indicated may be due to 
inequalities of intellectual capabilities and to inequalities 
of educational opportunity. Little difference exists between 
the means of urban and graded rural samples. Equality of 
educational opportunity may be indicated in this one instance. 

Insofar as it is possible to make statistical compar¬ 
isons of Alberta means with those of the standardization sam¬ 
ple, it seems valid to draw the following conclusions: 

(1) On the total Iowa test, Alberta medians did not differ 
from the Iowa medians; 

(2) The medians of the Alberta sample were somewhat lower 
than the Iowa medians on Parts I and II of the test, but 
were significantly higher on Part III; 

(5) Medians of the ungraded rural sample were significantly 
inferior to those of the Iowa standardization sample in 
all sections of the test. (No pupils from rural schools 
were included in the standardization sample).

The findings of this study respecting sex differences 
in arithmetical achievement are not at variance with those of 
other studies. The hoys of the urban sample were significant¬ 
ly superior to the girls on mean total score and mean Part 
III score. They showed a tendency to be superior on Parts I 
and II. Otherwise, no significant differences between the 
arithmetical achievement of boys and girls were observed. 

As a result of this survey, the writer makes the fol¬ 
lowing recommendations: 

(1) A program to develop standardized Alberta tests, or to 
obtain Alberta norms for good achievement tests already 
available, is needed. 

(2) Every effort should be made to increase the supply of 
well-qualified teachers for all of the classrooms in the

NORMATIVE SURVEY r 'F ACHIEVEMENT IN ARITHMETIC 


61 


GRADES V & VIII IN ALBERT A SCHOOLS 


I. Introduction - A comparative study of arithmetic achievement 
as measured by the Iowa Every Pupil Test in 
Arithmetic (5-9), of a random sampling of 
approximately one thousand Grade V pupils and 
one thousand Grade VIII pupils in four types 
of Alberta schools. 


II. Objectives 


III. Method 


- 1. To determine the status of arithmetic 

achievement in Alberta schools. 

2. To correlate intelligence, measured by the 
Otis Quick-Scoring Test, with arithmetic 
achievement in subtest and total scores in 
the four types of schools. 

3. To determine whether sex is a factor in 
arithmetic achievement by comparing the means 
of girls 1 and boys* subtest and total scores« 

- 1. A sample of 2000 pupils - 1000 in Grade V, 1000 

in Grade VIII drawn randomly so as to reflect 
accurately provincial achievement in arithmetic. 

2. The tests used will be the Iowa Every Pupil 
Tests in Arithmetic, 

3. A one-page questionnaire will be filled in by 
each pupil. 

U. The random sample chosen is as follows: 

(a) Calgary - 300 - Grade V-l50, Grade VIII-150 

(b) Edmonton - 180 - Grade V- 90, Grade VIII- 90 

(c) Camrose - 60 - Grade V-30, Grade VIII-30 

(d) Red Deer - 60 - Grade V-30, Grade VIII-30 

(e) Calgary Separate - 60 - Grade V-30, Grade VIII-30 

(f) Edmonton Sep. - 60 - Grade V-30, Grade VIII-30 

(g) Town group - I|00 - Grade V-200, Grade VIII-200 
Randomly selected by classroom from towns 
having 200 pupils enrolled, all resident in the 
town. 

(h) Graded Rural - 1+00 - Grade V-200, Grade VIII-200 
Randomly selected from divisions which had 

a minimum of 300 pupils conveyed, 

(i) Ungraded rural - U00 - Grade V-200, Grade VIII-200 
Randomly selected from randomly chosen 
superintendencies drawn from the entire province. 


IV. Administration of Tests - Last part of March or early part of April.

FACULTY OF EDUCATION 



EDMONTON, ALBERTA 
CANADA 


March 18, 1955 


The Faculty of Education and the Alberta Advisory 
Committee on Educational Research are sponsoring research 
in the arithmetic field and wish to secure Alberta data 
based on a sampling of urban, town, village and ungraded 
schools. We hope to have Iowa Every-Pupil Tests of 
achievement in Arithmetic and the Otis-Quick Scoring Mental 
Ability Test administered in March or early April to Grade V 
and Grade VIII pupils of representative schools and are 
asking for your cooperation. 

You will note that your trca has been selected 
for testing purposes as part of a representative sample of 
the schools of the Province. The Department of Education 
is particularly interested in the project and has-assured'- 
us of its wholehearted cooperation. 

It will require approximately two hours to administer 
the tests. In return we will mark all tests and supply you 
with a statement of results for your school records. We hope 
that you and your Board will cooperate with us in this project. 

In order to get the study under way would you please 
complete and return the enclosed questionnaire? If your 
answer is favorable we will forward testing materials and 
instructions in the near future. 

Hoping for your cooperation, I am 

Yours sincerely,

To Cooperating Principals, Superintendents and Teachers: 

It has been most gratifying to receive a constant stream 
of letters offering willing cooperation in the University 
sponsored arithmetic research project. 

The study is designed to gather an authoritative body of 
information concerning achievement in arithmetic in Alberta. 
The sample of 2000 is large enough to justify confidence in 
the results. It is distributed throughout four groups: 

Urban, the Town, the Graded Rural, and the Ungraded Rural 
sections of the school population. The sample is randomized 
in such a manner as to insure that the results will reflect 
accurately provincial achievement in arithmetic. 

This is the second major study of its kind in Alberta, 
and we are delighted that you have agreed to cooperate toward 
its completion. We hope that the results will constitute a 
contribution to education in the province. The plan is to 
complete the marking early in May, the statistical analysis 
early in 1956, and then to make the final reports widely 
available. 


Yours sincerely, 




Velma I. Miller 



W. Eric Hodgson

SUGGESTIONS TO CITY SUPERINTENDENTS 


1. Rooms should be randomly selected* 

2, Every pupil in the rooms chosen should be 
tested. 

3« Rooms with only one grade be chosen. ' 

1*. Principals of cooperating schools be given 
the enclosed questionnaires for completion. 

This will speed up the operation. 

5. In the case of your city ( ) 

you. will note that we will require approximately 
Grade V pupils 
Grade VIII pupils.

SUGGESTIONS FOR RANDOMIZING GRADED RURAL 


1. In the case of your division or county we 

will ask you to choose approximately 
grade V pupils and grade VIII pupils. 

2. For this group our concern is with the 
centralized school. We are anxious to 
get a sample from those pupils who are 
conveyed and thus hope you may randomize 
rooms from your larger centralizations. 

3. We request that rooms with not more than 
two grades be chosen. 

k, Every grade V or grade VIII pupil in the 
room selected should be tested. (We 
realize that this will include some pupils 
who are not conveyed). 

3. We would ask that principals of cooperating 
schools be given the enclosed questionnaire. 
This will speed up the study. 









QUESTIONNAIRE TO SUPERINTENDENTS.

research sponsored by the Faculty of Education and the 
Alberta Advisory Committee on Educational Research. Yes No 


2. The schools which I have chosen randomly are listed below in the order 
drawn for testing purposes. (An easy way to randomize is to place 
numbers representing each of the eligible rural schools in a bowl 
and draw by chance until the required number of pupils in each grade 
has been drawn).

To: Rural Teachers Taking Part in the Study: 

It occurs to us that teachers may be apprehensive concerning 
the use of the results of the arithmetic study. Certainly you 
are entitled to know how the results will be used. Let us say, 
right now, that our treatment of the data will not permit 
invidious comparisons of individual teachers or schools. 

The rural school, with small numbers in each of the grades 
tested, may have very high or very low scores, as a single 
brilliant or poor pupil, or a pupil with a language handicap,' 
will exert an extraordinary influence on the average of a par¬ 
ticular school. We realize, also, that some rural schools have 
privileged populations of high socio-economic status, while 
others lie in marginal areas where poverty and a low standard 
of living are present. Too, there is the influence of racial 
origin and language spoken in the home. All such factors may 
affect the standing of pupils in a rural school favorably or 
adversely. 

Everyone concerned with the studv realizes that such ex¬ 
treme differences exist, and is fully aware that such differences 
in achievement as are revealed by the study are the result of 
economic, social, linguistic and cultural factors, and are in 
no way attributable to the present teacher. 

We wish to recommend that you read carefully the instructions 
concerning pupils to be tested, and methods of administration of 
tests, and that you follow the instructions with meticulous care, 
in order that the results will present an accurate picture of the 
situation. 

In return we pledge ourselves to make our analyses of the 
resulting data only in large groups or samples in which the iden¬ 
tity of the individual schools is completely lost. No statistics 
will be computed in t erm s of individual schools . 

A final word. The excellent cooperation we have received 
assures us that our study is going to be a marked success. We 
could not ask for better support. We sincerely hope that every 
one of the cooperating teachers is going to share our pride in 
the study, warmed by the realization that together we are making 
a significant contribution to educational research in Alberta. 


Tours sincerely,

This is a test to see how well you can think. It contains questions of different kinds. Here are three 
sample questions. Five answers are given under each question. Read each question and decide which 
of the five answers below it is the right answer. 

Sample a: Which one of the five things below is soft ? 12345 

© glass © stone © cotton © iron © ice. W jj I |[ \\ 

The right answer, of course, is cotton; so the word cotton is underlined. And the 
word cotton is No. 3; so a heavy mark has been put in the space under the 3 at th^ 
right. This is the way you are to answer the questions. 

Try the next sample question yourself. Do not write the answer; just draw a line 
under it and then put a heavy mark in the space under the right number. 


Sample b: A robin is a kind of — e 7 s 9 10 

© plant © bird © worm © fish © flower.... I! II II II jj 
The answer is bird; so you should have drawn a line under the word bird, and bird is 
No. 7; so you should have put a heavy mark in the space under the 7. Try this one: 

Sample c: Which one of the five numbers below is larger than 55 ? n 12 13 14 15 

@ 53 @48 © 29 © 67 © 16.jj li ii ii ii 

The answer, of course, is 57; so you should have drawn a line under 57, and that 
is No. 14; so you should have put a heavy mark in the space under the 14. 

The test contains 80 questions. You are not expected to be able to answer all of them, but do the best 
you can. You will be allowed half an hour after the examiner tells you to begin. Try to get as many 
right as possible. Be careful not to go so fast that you make mistakes. Do not spend too much time 
on any one question. No questions about the test will be answered by the examiner after the test begins. 
Lay your Dencil down. 

Do not turn this booklet until you are told to begin.

IOWA EVERY-PUPIL TESTS OF BASIC SKILLS 
New Edition 

TEST D: BASIC ARITHMETIC SKILLS —FORM O 

ADVANCED BATTERY —GRADES 5-6-7-8-9 

By 

H. F. Spitzer, in collaboration with Ernest Horn, Maude McBroom, H. A. Greene, and E. F. Lindquist (General Editor), all of the 
College of Education, State University of Iowa, with the Assistance of the Faculty of the University Experimental Schools. 


Directions: The other side of this page is an answer sheet on which you will mark your answers to all of the questions in this 
test. To use this answer sheet, you will have to tear it off. Do this now, tearing very carefully along the perforation at the 
left-hand side of this page. 


Each question in Part I of the test is followed by four possible answers, only one of which is correct or definitely bettei 
than any of the others. To answer a question, first decide which is the best answer, then iook at the rows of boxes under 
Part I on the answer sheet and find the row of boxes numbered the same as the question. Then place an X in one of these 
four boxes, as follows: 

If you think the first answer is best, mark the first box in the row. 

If you think the second answer is best, mark the second box in the row. 

If you think the third answer is best, mark the third box in the row. 

If you think the fourth answer is best, mark the fourth box in the row. 

Mark only one box in each row. If you change your mind about an answer, erase your first mark very thoroughly. 

Directions for Parts II and III of the Test will be given to you after you finish Part I. 

Answer the questions in all parts of the test in the order in which they are given, but do not linger too long over difficult 
questions or problems. Skip them, and return to them later if time permits. If you do skip any questions, be sure to skip 
the corresponding boxes on the answer sheet also. 

Do not begin work until you are told to do so.

^fictions: In this section are a number of examples which you are to solve. On the answer sheet, after the num- 
of each example, you will find three possible answers and an N. The N means that the correct answer for the 
hple is not given on the answer sheet. 

ou are to do your work right on this page. First solve the example. Then turn to the answer sheet and find 
number of that example. Compare your answer with those given on the answer sheet. If one of the three 
vers given is exactly like your own, place an X in the box in front of it. If none of the three answers given is 
yours, place an X in the box in front of the N. Do not rework a problem simply because your answer is not 
any of those given on the answer sheet. Instead, mark the box in front of the N and go on to4he next ex¬
