ABSTRACT 


High concentrations of solanine in potatoes give 
them a bitter flavour and may even produce toxic symptoms if 
consumed. Though high solanine content is well-known to be 
associated with greening from exposure to light, investigations 
have shown that dangerously high solanine concentrations do 
occur in Netted Gem potatoes that are of excellent appearance 
and that show no visible greening* 

To study the effect of certain field cultural 
practices on the occurrence of solanine in Netted Gem potatoes, 
two factorial experiments were designed in three replicates 
and continued for two seasons. The factors studied were two 
depths of planting with three levels of hilling, and two dates 
of planting with single and multiple eyes. 

The cold ethanol extraction method used on the 
1950 tuber samples was an arduous procedure giving unsatisfactory 
results, in which no treatment trends were evident. Dabbs’ 
acidified ethanol Soxhlet extraction method applied to the quick- 
frozen 1951 samples not only reduced extraction time but gave 
satisfactory checks.

terized both split-plot factorial experiments in 1951- In

one factorial it reached the 5 per cent level of significance, 
which indicated, in this experiment at least, that the variabil¬ 
ity of uncontrolled environmental factors in the field was 
greater than that due to the cultural treatments studied * In 

effect, though variance due to an interaction of planting dates 
with eye number was quite marked, the conclusion is that the 
cultural treatments studied made no significant difference in 
the occurrence of solanine in the tubers under the conditions 
of the experiment * 

Concomitant tuber yield studies showed that: 

(1) Normal planting gave consistently but not sig¬ 
nificantly greater yields than late planting 
in both years* 

(2) No consistent differences existed in the yields 
obtained from single-eye and multiple-eye seed- 
pieces* 

(3) Shallow planting resulted in yields equal to, 
or greater than, deep planting* Differences 
were not significant. 

(4) There was no difference in yield between no 
hilling, low hilling or high hilling treatments.

INTRODUCTION 


Reports of bitter flavor in table potatoes 
are received by the Horticulture Division of the University 
of Alberta, Department of Plant Science, every year. These 
reports do not appear to be confined to any particular time 
of year nor to a particular area. The bitterness appears 
to be found mainly in the variety Netted Gem, which is the 
most widely grown variety in Alberta at the present time* 
This is a report of a study of the influence of certain 
cultural practices on solanine content in the Netted Gem 
variety* 


REVIEW OF LITERATURE 


History and Importance of the Variety Netted Gem 

Before Luther Burbank left New England for 
California, where he became famous as a plant breeder, he 
had already selected a white-skinned potato which became 
known as Burbank’s Seedling (25) • The selection was made 
from an open-pollinated Early Rose potato, a pink-skinned 
variety. From the relatively smooth-skinned Burbank’s

Seedling, a mutation or seedling arose which was deeply netted 
or darkly russeted. The latter became known as a distinct 
variety, and is now very widely grown under several names, 
including Russet Burbank, Idaho Russet, Idaho Baker, and Netted 
Gem (25, 4$)• It is now the leading variety for seed certi¬ 
fication in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan (12). 

It is also the foremost potato variety in the four Northwestern 
States, as is shown in Table I, the figures for which were 
taken from the American Potato Yearbook 1951 (11).

From the above facts it is clear that the 
economic importance of the Netted Gem variety is indisputable* 
What, then, are the qualities or factors contributing to its 
universal popularity in the West? 

In Alberta, though far from being an ideal 
potato, the Netted Gem has several characteristics which make 
it a difficult variety to replace* It is scab-resistant, an 
important attribute in high-lime prairie soils. Its attrac¬ 
tive shape and skin color, together with its shallow eyes and

short-season characteristic, combine to give it a good 
appearance when well-grown. The variety appears well-adapted 
to irrigation and keeps well in storage. In fact, Wright and 
Whiteman ( 56 ) found that Russet Burbank required an average of 
thirteen weeks to sprout even when stored at 50° F. In Idaho, 
it is highly esteemed as a baking potato (4$), while in a test 
of the chipping quality of 33 Maine-grown varieties Netted Gem 
was one of the eight varieties that produced chips of outstand¬ 
ing attractiveness whether the tubers were stored at 40° F, 
then conditioned at 70° F, or whether stored at 55° F (57)* 

The above characters, together with its popularity 
in Idaho, and the resultant demand for Canadian Certified Seed, 
have firmly entrenched the Netted Gem variety in the Alberta 
potato-growing industry. Alberta growers of certified seed 
supply seedstocks to the commercial grower at home and abroad. 
How much the ff popularity tf of the Netted Gem variety in Alberta 
is attributable to consumer preference, and how much it has been 
thrust upon the consumer by the seed growers who cater primarily 
to the export trade in seedstocks and use the home table market 
as an outlet, for surpluses, is a matter for conjecture. 

The above arrangement would be ideal if Alberta- 
grown Netted Gems were always of top table quality. In these 
latitudes the variety is medium to late in season and there¬ 
fore does not always attain top quality in mealiness. Its

greatest fault, however, in this province at least, appears to 
be the pronounced bitterness which the tubers often develop at 
sometime during their growth and storage* 

It is well-known that sunburn or greening will 
cause potatoes to develop a bitter flavor* Blodgett and 
Rich (1949) (6), in a complete survey of potato abnormalities 
in the Pacific Northwest where the Netted Gem variety is a 
leader, make one reference to bitterness in the variety; i.e., 
"where visible greening has occurred from exposure to natural 
or artificial light of tubers in the field• " In stressing 

its importance, they say only a trace of greening is sufficient 
cause for rejection of affected tubers as culls, since the 
whole tuber carries the bitter flavor* Numerous other workers 
also mention bitterness in potatoes in association with green¬ 
ing (30, 35). 


The problem in Alberta, however, is more compli¬ 
cated by the fact that extreme bitterness is found in Netted 
Gem tubers showing absolutely no sign of visible greening. 

Sometimes, accompanying the complaints received 
concerning bitter potatoes, are reports of sore throats or 
sickness after eating such potatoes. Experience gained in 
this study confirms the findings of many of the German workers 
that such bitterness in the potato is due to an abnormally high 
solanine content (9, 42, 47).

Solanaceous Alkaloids (23) 

The potato ( Solarium tuberosum ) belongs to the family 
Solanaceae . It is interesting to note that the Solanum genus 
supplies the name for the family as a whole. The significance 
of this is not known, but the family is noted for the variety 
of alkaloids found in its various species. It is not surprising, 
then, that the potato contains an alkaloid-like substance 
solanine. Other alkaloids found in members of the Solanaceae 
family are nicotine from Nicotiana spp., atropine from the dead¬ 
ly night-shade Atropa belladonna , "daturine”* from Datur a 
stramonium , the Jimson weed. The belladonna dilates the pupils 
of the eyes, was formerly used by women for that purpose and 
so derived its name. tf Daturine ff is effective as "knock-out” 
drops, and was formerly used by thieves to stupify their vic¬ 
tims and by magicians to produce fantastic visions. Other 
members of the family containing notably poisonous alkaloids 
are Black Henbane ( Hyoscyamous niger ), Bittersweet or Woody 
Nightshade ( Solanum du1camara ), and Black Nightshade ( Solanum 
nigrum ). One might speculate that the common name for the 
family, Nightshade, had its origin in the mystery and super¬ 
stition associated with the witchcraft that was practised under 
cover of darkness by medicine men, alchemists and sorcerers 
who used the alkaloids of the various members of the family to 
work their charms.

Definition, Occurrence and Metabolism of Alkaloids 

As indicated above, the plant alkaloids include 
many substances which are physiologically active in higher 
animals — substances which we know as drugs such as morphine, 
and quinine, and mildly active stimulants such as nicotine and 
caffeine ($). 

Alkaloids are complex cyclic compounds contain¬ 
ing nitrogen that are produced only in certain species of plants. 
They are especially common in members of the Solanaceae, 
Papaveraceae, Leguminosae, Ranunculaceae, Rubiaceae and 
Apocynaceae. Species of plants which contain one alkaloid 
are very likely to contain others* Most alkaloids are white 
solids, and as the name indicates, all are basic in reaction 
(19, 36). In fact, the term alkaloid literally means alkali- 
resembling substance (37) ? since compounds of this type have 
properties similar to those of the alkalies in being able to 
form, with acids, salts that are usually soluble in water* 

Miller (37) states that alkaloids may occur in the cell sap of 
the young parenchyma, or may be stored in older tissue in the 
leaves, stems and roots. 

According to Bonner (£), it has been demonstrated 
by reciprocal grafts of tomato top on tobacco root and tobacco 
top on tomato root that the alkaloid nicotine is synthesized 
in the root of the tobacco plant. From there the alkaloid

appears to be transported through the xylem to the leaves, 
where it sometimes constitutes up to &fo of the dry weight. 

The physiological role of the alkaloids in plants, 
if any, is unknown (3, 36 ). Some believe they arise in the 
formation of proteins, while others consider they result from 
the disintegration of proteins (37)♦ Whether they function 

actively in nitrogen metabolism in the species in which they 
are found, or whether they are only metabolism by-products is 
not known♦ The latter role is the most commonly accepted one 
(36), In any event, their synthesis is dependent directly or 
indirectly on the photosynthetic mechanism* Miller (37) cites 
Emde as having stated that photosynthetic activity of plants 
in general decreases as one progresses from equator to poles, 
and that alkaloid production of plants decreases concurrently, 
so that the maximum of plant alkaloids is produced in the tropics 
while plants of polar regions produce none. 

The alkaloids are usually found in plant tissues 
in the form of salts of organic acids; e.g., malic, citric, 
succinic, oxalic, tannic, etc. (19, 36). The alkaloid solanidine, 
however, is found in the potato tuber combined with three sugars 
to form the glycosidal alkaloid solanine (19, 23, 45, 55)* 

According to Brautlecht and Getchell (10), the 
tuber juice is acid. They cite Robertson and Smith as having 
observed a pH range for potato juice of 5.5 to 6.2 for varieties

grown in the British Isles, Solanine would probably be 
soluble at this pH. 


Glycosides 

From the foregoing account of the occurrence 
of solanidine, it can be seen that solanine may also be classed 
as a glycoside; i.e., a compound formed by the reaction between 
one or more sugars and one or more compounds which are not 
sugars. Glycosides probably occur more widely in plants than 
do alkaloids, but like the latter are never present in large 
quantities. They also resemble alkaloids in many other re¬ 
spects: they are crystalline, colorless and bitter; their role 
in the metabolism of plants, if any, is also obscure. They 
are usually soluble in water or alcohol ( 36 ). 

Solanine. Solanidine and Solanthrene 

A knowledge of the chemistry of solanine is 
important in order that intelligent analytical work be carried 
out. In the past, there was much disagreement as to the chemi¬ 
cal formula of solanine. Henry (23) has compiled seven alterna¬ 
tive formulae with nearly as many different melting points pro¬ 
posed by the earlier workers in the field. There is now fairly 
unanimous agreement as to the molecular formula, but differences 
in classification still remain. In various texts and papers,

it is referred to as a glucoside, glycoside, gluco-alkaloid 
or glycosidal alkaloid* These are differences in name only. 

The complex is unaffected by alkalies ( 26 ), even 
when boiling (5), but when warmed with acids it is hydrolyzed 
into the base solanidine and one molecule each of dextrose, 
rhamnose, and galactose (19, 23, 55)* In fact, Soltys and 
Wallenfels (47), in Germany, report that the acid hydrolysis 
of solanine not only results in solanidine but some of the 
solanidine is itself dehydrated to form another alkaloid 
solanthrene, with the result that solanidine and solanthrene 
are formed in the ratio of three to one. These workers also 
state that Bergel and Wagner showed that solanidine consists of 
one (see Fig. 1), and solanthrene consists of two, double bonds. 
Wolf and Duggar (55) also confirmed the presence of solanthrene 
in the hydrolysis products of solanine. They, too, believed 
it to result from the dehydration of solanidine. 

The empirical formula of solanine is now regarded 
as being (45), and that of solanidine ^27^43^

able evidence, believe that solanidine has one or other of 
structures illustrated in Fig* 1. Fig. 1 (a) is that proposed 
by Soltys and Wallenfels, while Fig. 1 (b) is that proposed by 
Clemo et al* It is evident that the structure of the nitrogen- 
containing portion of the molecule is still in doubt.

Figure 1 , 

Two suggested structural formulae for solanidine: 

(a) by Soltys and Wallenfels, (b) by Clemo et al. 

After Gortner (19) . 

Solanine is insoluble in water (5), or practically 
so, and is insoluble in ether, chloroform, benzene and petroleum 
spirit (5, 23)® It is only slightly soluble in cold ethyl 
alcohol (23); perhaps somewhat more soluble in hot alcohol 
(5, 23)* Either hot ethyl (23) or amyl alcohol (5) may be 
used to extract solanine from plant tissues, or to dissolve 
the pure crystals* It also dissolves readily in most acids, 
including nitric (23), sulphuric (23, 42), acetic (15, 42), and 
citric (32)* Its basic properties are so weak that it is 
scarcely alkaline to litmus (23)* Solanine does not reduce 
Fehling’s solution (45), but will reduce certain other copper 
compounds (15) and sodium thiosulphate solutions (45)* These 
reducing properties were used by Rooke et al (45) and Conner 
(15) in hydrolytic methods of determination of solanine in 
potatoes.

Physiological and Pharmacological Action of Solanine 

The following extract from Allens Commercial 
Organic Analysis (5) very aptly describes the taste of solanine 
and some of its reported effects: 

"Solanine is odorless when dry, but when moist 
exhales an odour recalling that of potatoes while cooking. The 
taste of solanine is somewhat bitter and pungent. It leaves 
in the pharynx a persistently acrid sensation . Solanine is 
poisonous, producing in dogs and cats violent vomiting, followed 
by somnolence and sometimes accompanied by paralysis of the 
lumbar muscles. One grain killed a rabbit in six hours, and 
a J-grain is strongly nauseating to a man. Solanine is stated 
by Sardas to be an excellent neurotic sedative ........ ff 

Also, quoting Henry (23)? in the Plant Alkaloids: 

,f The solanines are stated to resemble the saponins 
in action and are described as protoplasmic poisons and potent 
hemolytics. Their effects are met with only in cases of 
poisoning by potatoes, which from faulty cultivation or storage 
or some other cause contain more than usual traces of solanine, 
but in quite a number of cases of mass potato poisoning the 
symptoms, while severe, have not proved fatal. The symptoms 
of solanine poisoning are headache, nausea, emesis (vomiting) 
and gastritis. With sufficiently large doses parenchymatous 
nephritis and haemoglobinurea, and even central nervous paralysis

and cardiac arrest, may ensue* It is also a local irritant*” 

Lepper (32) recommends adsorption on animal char¬ 
coal as a suitable treatment for solanine poisoning. 

Rochelmeyer (44) states that while solanine itself has a 
stimulating effect, solanidine is regarded as responsible for 
the toxic effect. 

Normal and Abnormal Solanine Content in Potatoes 

Gortner (19) states that potatoes normally contain 
about 0.024 part of solanine per 1000 (i.e*, 2.4 mg. per 100 gm*). 
Bomer and Mattis (7) found normal potatoes to contain 2.0 to 
£.9 mg. $*solanine. They suggest that 20 mg. per cent is the 
upper limit of safety for food, and that 27.7 to 5$*3 mg. per 
cent caused poisoning. That these latter figures lie within 
the range sufficient to cause poisoning was confirmed by Harris 
and Cockburn (21), who found a solanine content of 41 mg. per 
cent in a sample of potato believed to have caused the death of 
a five-year old boy in Glasgow. Postmortem examination showed 
death to be due to strangulation of the bowel, which might have 
been caused by extreme retching or vomiting. Alfa and Heyl (2) 
also report outbreaks of illness traced to use of potatoes all 
grown in one district, the tubers showing a solanine content 
of approximately 10 to 40 mg. per cent. 

* Mg. % (per cent) means mg. per 100 gm. fresh weight 
unless otherwise stated.

As will be seen later, the usefulness of some

results of Mayfield et al (35) are the only ones which are open 
to serious question.

Varietal Differences 

Morgenstern (3$) analyzed 12 table varieties 
and found an average solanine content of 12.5 mg* per cent, 
while seven stock-feeding varieties averaged only 5*$ mg, per 
cent. He found that "yellow" varieties contained less solanine 
than "red* or "blue" varieties. Thirteen samples of "yellow 11 
tubers averaged 7.3 mg. per cent solanine, whereas eight samples 
of "red" tubers averaged 11.9 mg. per cent. "It seems," wrote 
Morgenstern, "that the higher amounts of solanine in table 
potatoes may contribute to their flavor as the fodder varieties 
are lower in solanine but flat in flavor." Dominion Potato 
Inspector, Mr. J. W. Marritt, of Edmonton, Alberta, expressed 
the same idea to the author in conversation. He believes that 
certain amounts of solanine may be necessary for quality of 
flavor in the table potato. 

Fellenberg (17) reported the solanine content 
of "Yellow Mouse" and "Danish" potatoes were 2.6 mg. per cent 
and 5*7 mg. per cent, respectively. Lampitt (29) found that 
the amount of solanine in sprouted seed potatoes varies with 
the variety, and that free solanidine occurs in the sprouts of 
some varieties but not in others. 

Wolf and Duggar (55), in a survey of the solanine 
content of 32 potato varieties grown in the United States, also 
found evidence that solanine content varies with the variety

(see Table III)* They state, further, that analysis for 
solanine content of varieties is of little comparative value 
unless tuber size is taken into account, because within a variety 
they found that total solanine content increases with the tuber 
size (at least up to 135 gm.) but solanine concentration de¬ 
creased. In this connection, Braun (9) reports that samples 
of the same variety often give different values, but that high 
solanine content was often associated with certain varieties, 
especially with the variety "Ovalgelbe 

Some of the varietal results obtained by Wolf 
and Duggar (55) are reproduced below in Table III. Unfortunate¬ 
ly, samples were not drawn from one locality but from two.

Factors of the Cultural Environment 
Soils, Fertilizers and Moisture 

Morgenstern (3$) reported in 1907 that humus, 
moisture and potash diminished the solanine content of the tubers, 
but that dry sandy soils, phosphoric acid, and especially 
nitrogen, increased their solanine content. On the other hand, 
Pallman and Schindler (41) found in 1942 that fertilizing, par¬ 
ticularly with high dosages of nitrogen and potassium, had no 
effect except on the solanine content of young tubers. Other 
workers (7, 9, 32) report that fertilizers have no effect.

The above evidence is contradictory, probably be¬ 
cause none of the nutrient levels were determined before the 
fertilizers were applied. 

Minor elements also play an important part in the 
potato plant metabolism. Brautlecht and Getchell (10) believe 
that magnesium plays a vital role in the carbohydrate metabolism 
of the potato. They report that it is found more abundantly 
in potatoes than is calcium, and soils are depleted of it more 
rapidly. The tops, leaves and vines, contain about five times 
as much magnesium as the tubers. The high concentration in 
the potato leaves is associated with the chlorophyll. It is 
suggested that the magnesium may function in the formation of 
the carbohydrates. It is further suggested that sunburned 
potatoes, with a green skin and a green color often extending 
to a considerable extent into the potato, may possibly involve 
a lack of conversion of chlorophyll to starch or a change from 
starch to sugar to chlorophyll. 

If Brautlecht and Getchell are correct in their 
assumptions, it seems logical that adequate amounts of available 
magnesium may be a necessary prerequisite to normal metabolism 
of solanine in the potato, and that abnormal chlorophyll forma¬ 
tion in the tuber is in all likelihood accompanied by or sub¬ 
stituted with solanineformation.

That mineral deficiencies do not necessarily ex¬ 
hibit external symptoms was shown by Hayman (22) who reports 
increased yields of potatoes grown in the Red River Valley by 
applying zinc-containing dusts and sprays to vines that showed 
no external symptoms of zinc deficiency* 

Date of Planting and Maturity 

Unripe tubers are generally reported to have a higher 
solanine content than mature ones (32, 3$)* Wolf and Duggar 
(55), however, presented evidence (see Table III) to show that 
there is no obvious correlation between time of maturing and 
solanine content. Small tubers are usually reported higher in 
solanine than large ones (7, 32, 3$)* Morgenstern (3$) reasoned 
that this difference is due to the greater peel area per total 
volume. The tendency reported by Clark (13) for the smaller 
tubers to be found on the upper stolons may also be a factor. 

Braun (9) reports that no correlation between solanine content 
and planting date could be demonstrated. 

Climate 

According to Arutyunyan (4), the solanine content 
of Armenian potatoes amounts to 0*010 to 0.014 per cent of dry 
weight depending upon climatic conditions. He maintains that 
the solanine content of potatoes grown in mountainous sections

with temperate climate is always less than that of those grown 
in hot climates. In the latter case, summer cultivation of 
the potato field is recommended to reduce solanine content. 

Environment or Heredity ? 

Gortner (19) claims that the alkaloidal content 
of plants may be increased or decreased by appropriate selection 
of strains, by plant breeding and by fertilization (especially 
with nitrogen and phosphorus). He cites the nicotine content 
of tobacco as an instance of an alkaloid that has been increased 
by plant breeding and manuring. Loustalot and Winters (33) 
found that the roots and stems of plants of Cinchona ledgeriana 
grown at high nitrogen level contained higher amounts of total 
alkaloid than did those plants grown at lower nitrogen levels, 
while total alkaloid and quinine sulphate in roots of seedlings 
groxm in medium and high soil moisture were significantly higher 
than those in roots of seedlings grown in low r soil moisture (34)* 
Evidently, then, in certain instances environment plays the 
greater role. Solanine-rich potatoes as seed have been found 
to produce tubers of normal solanine content (7, 53)> though in 
some cases it took two seasons for the proportion to reach 
normal (29). 

There seems reason to believe, on the other hand, 
that the solanine content of potatoes may be reduced by breeding

and subsequent selection to a point where no further trouble 
would occur with poisoning or bitterness. 

Light and Photoperiod Effect on Plants and Tubers 

Wolf and Duggar (55) at the University of Wisconsin, 
in a study of solanine synthesis and distribution, found that 
"in the growing shoot with adequate supply of carbohydrates the 
synthesis of solanine is apparently independent of light, although 
light affects the distribution of the glycoside. In etiolated 
plants, there is a fairly uniform distribution between tops and 
roots, whereas in light a larger proportion remains in the tops. 
The photoperiod influences both the distribution and the synthesis 
of solanine. Plants about ten weeks old display a higher con¬ 
tent of solanine under a day-length of eighteen hours than 
plants of similar age under a ten-hour day. Furthermore, the 
alkaloid concentrates in the tops of long-day plants. In 
general, the data obtained confirmed the view that solanine 
occurs commonly in highest concentration in those organs and 
tissues where metabolic activity is greatest." Lampitt et al 
(29), working in England in 1943, reached the same conclusion 
and stated it thus: "The very large amounts of solanine found 
in the sprouts of potatoes is perhaps most interesting as an 
indication of the metabolic changes which take place when the 
resting stage gives place to the active growing stage."

The solanine content increases when potatoes are 
exposed to daylight (3$)* sunshine (19, 32) or ultra-violet 
light (4, 15)* Lepper (32) found the highest solanine content 
(55.7 mg. per cent) in the small green tubers of the Voran variety. 
Irradiation by sunlight increased slightly the solanine content 
in a strongly green potato, but storage reduced the increased 
solanine content obtained by irradiation* Sunburned potatoes 
are known to have as high as mg. per cent solanine (19)* 

Bomer and Mattis (7) reported no increase in solanine content 
in old potatoes after exposure to light for 7-10 weeks, while 
young potatoes with and without tops attached developed large 
amounts of solanine on exposure to light. This seemed to be 
related to formation of green color, which occurs much more 
readily on immature or ff young-mature fr than on T bld-mature? T tubers, 
when they are exposed to light. 

In experiments with the effect on the potato tuber 
of different wave-lengths of light, Conner (15) found that rays 
from the blue end of the spectrum (ultra-violet rays of about 
0.3 /i) were most effective for solanine formation but did not 
cause greening; whereas the yellow-red end of the spectrum was 
efficient for glucose synthesis, caused greening, but did not 
result in significant increases in solanine.

that diseases such as rust, soft rots and rhizoctonia do not 
affect the solanine content of tubers* However, some potato 
diseases, such as those caused by viruses, probably were not 
recognized at that time* No recent information is available 
on the effects of viruses or other potato diseases on the amounts 
of solanine present* It is possible that solanine bitterness 
may be a non-parasitic physiological disease or disorder itself, 
to which the variety Netted Gem is highly susceptible* In fact, 
the susceptibility of Netted Gems to solanine bitterness in 
Alberta closely parallels that of the variety Ontario for in¬ 
ternal necrosis under Wisconsin conditions* Larsen and Albert 
(31) for five years studied at digging time the incidence of 
internal necrosis, a non-parasitic physiological disorder. They 
found that varieties differ in their susceptibility* Some are 
entirely free, some show it in an intermediate degree, others 
are highly susceptible to it. The variety Ontario is the only 
one which develops it on muck soils in Wisconsin* It is note¬ 
worthy that in the 1949 season Ontario was the only variety 
which exhibited extreme susceptibility over a wide range of 
conditions and soil types in Wisconsin. 

Morgenstern (3$) noted that potatoes damaged in 
the soil had slightly more solanine than undamaged tubers in 
the soil. This phenomenal suggests the idea that damage to the 
tops by hail or frost might cause increases in the solanine of 
the tuber.

Factors of the Storage Environment 

While the present investigation is primarily con¬ 
cerned with the effect of field cultural practices, a study of 
the reaction of the potato to the storage environment may throw 
some light on its reaction to the field environment* Further- 

9 

more 5 the amount of solanine in the stored tuber is the sum of 
these two reactions* 

Morgenstern (3$) reports that the solanine content 
of tubers is unaffected by long storage, while 30 years later 
Naumov (39) of the U*S.S*R* reports increases in storage at 
low temperatures but a decrease if stored at 5° - 7° 0 
(40° - 44° F approx*), the decrease amounting to 50 per cent if 
the tubers are washed before storage* Wolf and Duggar (55) 
report that storage of the tubers at 4° - 5° 0 for long periods 
after harvest does not appreciably affect the solanine content 
of the varieties they tested, but analyses .should be made within 
six or seven months because a slight rise is observed beginning 
in April or May* They state , further, that when solanine con¬ 
tent is determined on a fresh weight basis, any water loss from 
the tuber leads to an apparent increase in solanine. Morgenstern 
was more accurate when he attributed the apparent increase to 
loss of water and carbon dioxide because of respiration and 
transpiration. 

In this connection, the work of Treadway et al . 

(52) is most interesting. They studied the effect of storage

at 34° to 60° F on composition* They found that the loss of 
carbohydrate material and of moisture occurs at about the same 
rate so that the percentage solids remains at the original level* 
They cite Appleman as having found that three processes occur 
in the potato: (a) respiration which consumes sugar by converting 
it into carbon dioxide and water; (b) conversion of starch to 
sugar by amylolytic enzymes; and (c) conversion of sugar to 
starch (presumably by starch synthesizing enzymes). At low 
temperatures sugars increase and starch decreases; at higher 
temperatures sugars decrease as a result of respiration and 
starch synthesis. 

Alexander et al (1) encountered bitterness in the 
flavor of potato chips made from Katahdin variety, kept under 
low temperature storage conditions from October to February and 
March. Along with this bitter flavor were flavors described 
as sweet and burned by the judges. All were associated with 
excessive accumulation of reducing sugars. As progressive con¬ 
ditioning lowered the sugar content, the sweet and burned flavors 
disappeared, but the bitterness persisted in many lots. There 
were, however, fewer reports of bitterness among the french fries 
made from the mealy potatoes than from the less mealy. Condi¬ 
tioning was done by storing at 70° - 75°F for periods varying 
from one to ninety-one days. Reducing sugars were estimated 
by a picric acid coloration method.

The influence of light has been dealt with, in 
part, under cultural environment* It seems reasonable to be¬ 
lieve that there is an interaction between the factors of light, 
temperature and humidity of storage, as well as varietal in¬ 
heritance* This problem will be dealt with under the next 
heading* 

Development of Greening and Acrid Flavor in Potatoes 

Mayfield et al (35), in studying the effect of 
winter storage on palatability and nutritive value of potatoes, 
noted that a greenish-yellow color developed in the flesh of 
Netted Gem potatoes when kept in a cool, damp, dark cellar 
(37°“ 46° F) ? and that this change in color was accompanied by 
an acrid flavor* The change was noted in January and became 
more marked as storage advanced. These observations were made 
over a period of seven years. The Bliss Triumph stored during 
three seasons in the same cellar varied in flesh color change 
from year to year, sometimes remaining white and at other times 
becoming greenish-yellow, but with this change in color did not 
develop an acrid flavor* 

In a warm, dry storage cellar kept at 55° - 60° F 

with subdued light (another part of the same experiment), neither 
Netted Gem nor Bliss Triumph potatoes showed any indication of 
developing an acrid flavor* Although they withered and sprouted, 
their tissue retained its normal color and normal potato flavor.

Regarding light, etc., Mayfield says that in the cool and damp 
storage the temperature, humidity, light and ventilation were 
under control. The warm, dry storage was described as typical 
home basement storage, with light and ventilation supplied by 
a north basement window and no attempt made to control tempera¬ 
ture or humidity. The writer’s interpretation is that the 
cool, damp storage had no light , and the warm, dry storage had 
subdued light . 

Mayfield and her co-workers, already cited, made 
an analysis for solanine content periodically in the two vari¬ 
eties. Solanine content was found to be about the same for 
each variety. It was lowest a month before harvest (1.4 - $ mg. 
per cent), and highest on May 1st after seven months’ storage 
(51 ” 57 mg. per cent). It was found that though Netted Gem 
tuber flesh developed much more color and acrid flavor than that 
of Bliss Triumph variety, it contained no more solanine. Thus 
it would appear that tuber flesh color and even acrid flavor 
may not be connected directly with solanine content. 

However, since Mayfield’s figures for solanine con¬ 
tent are so far out of line with those usually quoted for normal 
potatoes (see Table II), it may well be that nob much confidence 
can be placed in her conclusions. A gravimetric method of 
analysis was used, and it seems doubtful if pure solanine was 
measured.

Mayfield’s maximum percentages appear to be 
dangerously high (cf. the upper limit for safety for food, set 
at 20 mg. per cent by Bomer and Mattis), but she reports feeding 
rather large amounts of potatoes where the solanine content was 
relatively high to rats and guinea pigs in the course of vitamin 
tests without any toxic symptoms attributable to solanine. 

In this connection, Hansen (20), after chemical 
and biological studies, came to the conclusion that ’’alleged 
solanine poisoning cannot be attributed to solanine, but to some 
form of bacterial toxin. The evidence leading to this con¬ 
clusion is that in the gastro-intestinal tract solanine undergoes 
hydrolysis with the formation of solanidine, which is practically 
insoluble and consequently not absorbed into the blood stream.” 

It should be pointed out that solanidine is a 
sterol derivative, and though sterols generally are insoluble 
in aqueous solutions, one of them, at least, (cholesterol) is 
found in quantity in the blood stream. Schoenheimer ( 46 ) has 
shown that cholesterol is a sterol of animal origin; is synthe¬ 
sized in the animal body; and also may be absorbed as an ester 
reaching the blood stream via the thoracic lymph. There is the 

4 

possibility that other sterols or their derivatives may be ab¬ 
sorbed from the intestinal tract, as esters of fatty acids. 
Certainly, cholesterol is soluble in bile, which is some reason 
to believe that solanidine is also soluble in bile and may be 
absorbed as a fatty acid ester into the blood stream. However, 




2 $ 


Hansen’s conclusions that solanidine is not absorbed in the 
intestinal tract seems to be verified by Schoenheimer (46), who 
has presented very convincing evidence that plant sterols are 
not absorbed as esters in the thoracic lymph duct* Schoenheimer 
admits that his experiments involved the use of chemical methods 
which might introduce slight experimental errors. For this 
reason, he could not rule out the possibility that there might 
have been absorbed the minutest traces of plant sterols which 
were not detectable by the methods used. 

Working on what he termed ’’greening in potatoes,” 
and which he differentiated from ’’sunburn,” Larsen (30), of Idaho, 
attributed greening to chlorophyll formation but did not correlate 
it with palatability or solanine content. Chlorophyll formation 
was shown to be closely correlated with visible greening, and 
green and blue screens were found effective in reducing it. 

Little or no greening was found to take place below 40° F. 

Tubers of the variety Netted Gem were found to develop slightly 
but significantly less chlorophyll upon exposure to light than 
did tubers of the variety White Rose. The maturity of tubers 
at harvest, and exposure to sunlight immediately after digging, 
had no effect on the amount of greening taking place upon sub¬ 
sequent exposure to artificial light. Most rapid formation of 
chlorophyll occurred at the highest temperature tested (6£° F) 
at the light intensity used (9 foot-candles). 





29 


In 1950, the author (27) conducted some preliminary 
storage trials with Netted Gem potatoes which included three 
storage temperatures without light and some with subdued light. 
Degree of bitterness was tested by tasting the pressure-cooked 
tubers. It was not found that greening appreciably Increased 
the bitterness, but it was found that greening produced of itself 
another off-flavor distinct from the bitterness ascribed to 
solanine. Hilton (24) concluded from the data on these trials 
that, in general, low temperature storage maintained or caused 
more bitterness in the variety than storage temperatures at 
10° G or above. 

The evidence, therefore, regarding the effect of 
temperature on solanine bitterness seems to be: (a) that the 
higher storage temperatures are likely to be least favorable for 
the development of bitter or acrid flavor, and, therefore, possibly 
solanine; and (b) that subdued winter daylight of low intensity 
may not favor its development either. These conclusions seem 
to be supported in whole or in part by the reports of Naumov (39), 
Mayfield (35) and Hilton (24)* The apparent increased bitterness 
in certain varieties of potatoes stored at low temperatures may 
be due, not to any greater synthesis of solanine, but to the 
splitting-off of the reducing sugars - glucose, galactose and 
rhamnose, leaving the alkaloid solanidine, which may give a 
greater apparent bitterness to the flavor.

Distribution of Solanine in the Potato Tuber 

The proportion of solanine present in the eyes 
of the potato is greater than that in the skin, which, in turn, 
is greater than that in the flesh (1$, 19 ? 29). Sprouts contain 
much greater quantities than either peel or eyes (2$, 33), and 
it may be significant that sprouts contain notable quantities 
of solanidine (29). Fischer and Thiele (13), using a blood- 
gelatin test, found solanine principally in the first ten cells 
of storage tissue® 

Summing up their findings in England, Lampitt et al . 
(29) report: "Apparently, during storage, and presumably as 

a first stage in sprouting, the solanine content of the eyes in¬ 
creases, and then as sprouts develop, decreases, while that of 
the flesh remains unchanged throughout. The solanine and 
solanidine content of the peel and flesh decrease when potatoes 
develop sprouts in the dark, at both 30° C and 4° C, but little 
change occurs at room temperature in daylight. In the dark, 
at 4° C (approx. 33° F), where little or no sprouting was evident, 
a decrease in the solanine content of the whole tuber occurs, 
whereas under other conditions of storage described the total 
solanine increases." 

Distribution of Solanine in the Entire Potato Plant 

Table IV shows the distribution of solanine in 
the parts of the potato tubers and plants as found by Lampitt

The Effect of Cultural Practices on Yields 
Tuber-Bearing Parts, Tuber Formation and Rate of Growth 

An understanding of how tuber formation occurs is 
useful in a study of this nature for two reasons♦ It is an aid 

in interpreting yield differences from cultural treatments, and 
it is a guide in taking field samples for solanine analyses. 

Clark (13) gives an excellent description of the tuber-bearing 
parts. 

The tubers are borne on underground stems, commonly 
called stolons, which are modified branches arising from nodes 
of the main stem, and are normally situated below ground. The 
development of the buds into stolons rather than leaf-bearing 
branches depends largely upon certain definite environmental 
conditions, chief among which is the exclusion of light. Accord¬ 
ing to De Vries quoted by Clark (13), each axillary bud of the 
stem of a potato plant has the capability of developing, accord¬ 
ing to the conditions which surround it, into either a leafy stem 
or a tuber-bearing stolon. Clark states, further, that this 
was substantiated by Franz, who claims that if the lower buds 
are exposed to light, green shoots will generally develop instead 
of stolons; likewise, the upper axillary buds will develop into 
stolons instead of green shoots, if light is excluded early 
enough.

The arrangement of stolons on the stalk is 
generally five-ranked, though there are many exceptions to this 
which are attributed to the failure of some nodes to develop* 

This same arrangement occurs with the leaf scales on the stolons* 
The stolons terminate with leaf scales which are strongly re¬ 
curved, usually at an angle between 90° and 1$0°. 

The stolons start comparatively early in the 
growth of the plant, usually within a week or ten days after 
the plants have appeared above ground, the stolons of the early 
varieties appearing a little in advance of those of the late 
ones* Under normal conditions of growth, the stolons should be 
well started by the time the plants have reached a height of 
four inches* 

The length of the stolons is subject to great 
variation, ranging from less than an inch to lengths equalling, 
or occasionally exceeding, l£ inches. While there is much vari¬ 
ation within the variety, and, in fact, the individual plant, 
there is a fairly well-defined relationship between stolon length 
and variety* Stolon length is greater under conditions of long 
days, while tuberization is delayed. 

Clark (13) studied tuber formation and rate of 
growth under irrigation for two years with the late variety 
Rural New Yorker at Greely, Colorado* He reports that practical¬ 
ly the entire crop of tubers was set at the beginning of the

period of tuber development, probably within the space of a 
very few days. The time of beginning of the tuber formation 
was found to coincide very closely with the end of the period 
of flower-bud development. 

The rate of growth was found to be very rapid 
during the early part of the period of tuber development. Maxi¬ 
mum rate of growth of tubers was found to occur about the last 
of August or first of September, which was approximately SO days 
after planting, at which time nearly one-third of the total 
period of tuber development had elapsed. In both years, there 
was a progressive increase in weight per hill and in average 
weight per tuber throughout the entire period of the investiga¬ 
tion. Differences in the sizes of tubers in the individual 
hill were attributed largely to an unequal rate of growth, 
rather than to differences in the age of the tuber. The weight 
of tuber did not appear to be correlated with the length of 
stolon on which it is produced, but there was a tendency toward 
a decrease in size of tuber on the upper stolons. While Clark 
( 13 ) found that a small increase in the weight of tubers occurred 
after the vines had been killed by frost; he cites Follstad 
as having obtained results that showed an average gain in weight 
17 days after the death of the foliage of 26.4 per cent or 57 
bushels per acre under Wisconsin conditions.

Tuber Yield as Affected by - 

(1) Number of Byes in Seed-Pieces 

In studying the influence of the number of eyes 
in the seed set upon the yield of potatoes, the U.S.D.A. publi¬ 
cation from the Office of Horticultural Investigations by Stuart 
et al (50) is of special interest. Although this publication 
is twenty-eight years old, the literature review extends back 
to 17?6; that is, almost another 150 years. In 24 out of 32 
reports reviewed in which single eyes were used, in comparison 
with multiple-eye sets, the results from the multiple-eye sets 
were better. 


Judging from the context of most of the reports, 
the lower yields from the single eyes was attributable, in part 
at least, to the smaller piece of tuber that may be associated 
with the single eye. To cite a specific example, Anderson in 
1776 as quoted by Stuart et al. (50) reported one-eye sets from 
the apical and basal portions of the tubers showed an increase 
of more than 123 per cent in favor of the basal eye sets. As 
more one-eye sets can be made from the apical end than from the 
basal end, presumably the one-eye sets from the apical portion 
of the tubers were smaller than those from the basal portion, 
for one of Anderson’s conclusions was that the weight of the crop 
is always in some measure influenced by the weight of the seeds 
planted. This principle was clearly illustrated in his results, 
where large whole tubers (average weight 6 0 5 oz.) from which all

but one eye had been removed outyielded the one-eye sets 
(average weight 0.13 oz.) from the basal parts of large tubers* 

The above results were confirmed by Zavitz, who 
is also quoted by Stuart et al (50). Zavitz, in a 5-year test, 
showed that increasing the weight of single-eye seed-pieces 
from 1/16 oz. to 2 oz. gave progressive yield increases from 
46*2 to 132.7 bushels per acre, even after seed used was deducted. 
But he also found that for a given seed size increasing the 
number of eyes from two to five gave increased yields. On the 
other hand, Schollander, as cited by Stuart et al .(50) in a 
summary of a five-year yield study of large and small whole tubers, 
large halves, and of large three-eye, two-eye and one-eye pieces, 
reports that large one-eye sets came first in yield of merchant¬ 
able tubers, and second only to large whole tubers in total 
yield. It is noteworthy that the large one-eye sets outyielded 
the large two-eye and three-eye sets on both points. 

From the foregoing, there would seem to be fairly 
general agreement that the size of seed-piece is a factor affect¬ 
ing yield, but there is less agreement as to how much yield is 
affected by the number of eyes. However, Thompson (51), who 
also reviews the work of Zavitz and others, concludes that yield 
is influenced mainly by the size of seed-piece irrespective of 
the number of eyes, and that therefore the question of number 
of eyes becomes of only minor importance. Thompson (51) says that

Whipple thinned plots of several varieties in Montana to one 
stalk per hill and reported a very small increase in marketable 
yield, with practically no difference in total yield* Thompson 
(51) concludes, therefore, that the most important factor in 
cutting seed appears to be that of obtaining a sufficiently 
large piece to insure at least one vigorous stalk* 

Wakankar (54), working in India, studied the 
effect of size of seed-piece and number of sprouts on the result¬ 
ing potato crop. He used whole seed tubers 40 grams in 

weight, but limited the number of sprouts to one, two and three, 
respectively, in six replicates each, with the tubers planted 
a foot apart. The results showed that keeping the seed size 
constant, the yield, total number of tubers produced, and their 
individual size are affected considerably by the number of 
sprouts per hill. With one sprout to each hill, the total 
number of tubers formed and the yield in each hill is less, but 
the individual size of the tubers produced is increased. On 
the other hand, when three sprouts are kept to each hill, the 
total yield and the number of tubers formed is increased, but 
their relative size is reduced. 

However, comparing the 3 >-ields from seed-pieces 
with one sprout but differing in weight, i.e. 10, 20, 40 grams, 
had no significant effect on the total yield, the total number 
of tubers, and the individual size of the tubers produced* 




Wakankar (54) concludes that large seed-pieces 
give higher yields because of their capacity to produce more 
sprouts (stems) per hill. Even a single eye may often produce 
more than one sprout or stem, especially if the seed-piece is 
large® 

(2) Planting Date 

Thompson (51) states that, if possible, potatoes 
should be so planted as to bring the period of blossoming and 
tuber setting during a time when weather conditions are optimum. 
This period, he says, is usually about six weeks after normal 
planting date. He cites the work of Erwin and Rudenick and that 
of Bushell, a?ll working in Ohio, and the consensus seems to be 
that normal planting time gives better yields than early or late 
planting. Rich (43), in a five-year study with Green Mountain 
potatoes in Rhode Island, reports potatoes planted April 25, 

May 5, 15 and 25, produced yields and percentages of No. 1 
potatoes in descending order. 

(3) Depth of Planting and Degree of Hilling 

There appears to be a paucity of literature dealing 
with these factors. However, Thompson (51) covers these factors 
very neatly in one paragraph, which is quoted here in full: 

?f Depth of planting varies mainly with soil type and 
with the system of culture. Although 4 inches is about average, 
the depth is commonly more shallow on heavy soils and deeper on

light soils♦ Irrespective of depth planted, tubers tend to 
develop at the 4“inch depth* This is due to the fact that 
conditions of soil moisture and temperature are optimum for 
growth at this depth* On heavier soils, the seed is commonly 
planted quite shallow, and a system of gradual-to-steep ridging 
is practiced during the growing season* This provides against 
injury to the crop from excessive rainfall and makes digging 
easier. Extreme ridging is practiced chiefly in Maine, western 
New York, in the South, and in irrigated sections of the West. 
Elsewhere more nearly level culture is practiced. In regions 
where soil is light and rainfall is likely to be insufficient, 
ridging is sometimes overdone with the result that the soil 
dries out and growth is retarded at midseason. t?

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 


Experimental Desi.gn 

The study of the effect of field cultural practices 
upon the occurrence of solanine in the potato tuber appears to 
be a subject upon which no reliable information is available* 
Consequently, it was decided to study the influence of a number 
of possible factors. With this idea in view, two factorial 
designs were set up side by side, each in three replicates. The 
experimental unit was a 30-foot row with a guard row on each side 
receiving the same treatment. Thus each treatment row was 
separated from another treatment by the two guard rows. Seed- 
pieces were planted by hand a foot apart in furrows 36 inches 
apart and plowed under. The rows ran north and south. Repli¬ 
cates numbered also from north to south. Guard hills at each 
end of the treatment row were discarded to minimize border effects. 
Though the occurrence of solanine in the tubers under differing 
cultural practices was the primary objective, concomitant yield 
results were recorded and assessed. 

(1) Experiment to study the effects of normal and 
late planting, and single and multiple-eye 
seed-pieces, on tuber yields and solanine con¬ 
tent. 

The field plot consisted of a split-plot arrange¬ 
ment in which normal and late planting occupied the main plots

at random within each replicate, and randomly arranged were 
the sub-plots of two types of seed-piece, single and multiple 
eyes, respectively. 

Planting dates were: normal, May 1$, 1950, and 
May 22, 1951; late, June 9, 1950, and June 11, 1951• 

(2) Experiment to study the effects of deep and 
shallow planting, and degrees of hilling, on 
tuber yields and solanine content. 

Again the field plan consisted of a split-plot 
arrangement. Two depths of planting random!}/- arranged in each 
replicate comprised the main plots. The latter were subdivided 
into three sub-plots of randomly arranged degrees of hilling, 
designated no hilling, low hilling, and high hilling. 

Although the designation, deep planting, was used, 
deeper than normal planting was not intended. The term ff normal 
planting depth" was not used so as to avoid confusion with 
"normal planting date Tf used in the other experiment. 

Shallow planting was achieved by raking the soil 
back into the furrow to a depth of about three inches. The soil 
was a typical Edmonton clay loam. Plots were rolled with a 
land packer after planting, and given one shallow cultivation 
shortly after emergence. Thereafter, weeds were eliminated by 
scraping the surface with a sharp hoe. Hilling was done by 
manual labor with the hoe on July 24 and July 25 in 1950, and

on approximately the same dates in 1951* The intent was to 
hill after tuber formation was assumed to have taken place. 

Preparation of the Seed-pieces 

Tubers of the variety Netted Gem were cut into 
seed-pieces in the normal manner. All seed-pieces were kept 
fairly uniform in size and averaged about two ounces. Each 
seed-piece contained two or more eyes except where single-eye 
pieces were desired, in which case seed size was maintained 
equal to that of multiple-eye pieces but the number of eyes were 
reduced to one. No preference or bias was shown toward apical 
or basal tuber parts for either single or multiple-eye seed- 
pieces. 

Second generation certified Netted Gem seed was 
used in 1950, and third generation of the same stock was used 
in 1951• The first year the seed-pieces were treated with 
fermate. No treatment was applied to the seed the second year. 
There was a rather high incidence of leaf roll and mosaic the 
first year, but with careful roguing almost no disease appeared 
during the second year. 

Methods of Taking Field Samples 
(a) For Yield Data 1950 and 1951 

The treatment rows were dug with digging forks

and total yield in pounds taken on the 30 -foot row less the 
guard hills at each end* In 1950, yields were based upon a 
possible 2$ hills, while in 1951 they were based on 27 hills, 
as 31 seed-pieces were planted in the 30-foot row the second year 
instead of 30 pieces as in 1950* Yields were recorded to the 
nearest half-pound in 1950, and to the nearest pound in 1951* 

Due to the above differences and to the facts that the trials 
were at two different locations in the two years and that 
rogueing increased the "missing hill" counts in 1950, a combined 
analysis of variance was not attempted* 

(b) For Solanine Analysis 

Before any potatoes were picked up, 20 to 30 tubers 
ranging in size from approximately 3 ounces upward were taken 
at random from the dug roxtf, placed in a cotton sack, labelled 
inside and out and weighed with the remainder of the row* The 
samples were promptly stored in a cool root cellar the same day 
as dug* 

Selection and Preparation of Tubers for Solanine Analyses 

In 1950, the majority of samples to be analyzed 
remained in storage until March, when it was decided to quick- 
freeze representative samples for analysis throughout the spring 
and summer months* Consequently, six 4-ounce tubers of each

treatment were washed and allowed to dry* They were then 
quartered with peel intact, put through a food chopper, and 
minced in a Waring Blendor for not more than two minutes* Quad¬ 
ruplicate samples of 150 grams each were carefully weighed into 
previously labelled and waxed paper-cup containers, lids put on, 
quick-frozen and stored until required* 

A somewhat better procedure was followed in 1951* 

The tubers were dug on October 3, and to prevent the cultural 
treatment effects from being complicated by a long storage 
history, samples were quick-frozen a month after digging as follows 

The sample taken in the field was emptied out and 
the tubers grouped according to their respective sizes. The 
number of tubers selected to make up the sample for analysis was 
limited by the volume of potato material that could be efficient¬ 
ly minced at one time in the Waring Blendor. As this amount 
appeared to be the equivalent of three to four tubers, a total 
of seven tubers was selected at random from the representative 
size groups. That is, if there were three size groups - small, 
medium and large - and more tubers appeared in the small group, 
then selection was made as follows: two large, two medium and 
three small* These tubers were halved longitudinally, and the 
one half of each tuber was discarded. The remaining seven 
halves were prepared as before except that they were minced for 
five minutes, weighed in quadruplicate 25-gram samples in small 
numbered aluminum cans, quick-frozen and stored.

TUBER YIELDS 


Tuber Yields as Affected by Normal and Late Planting 

with Single and Multiple Eyes 

The data for 1950 are presented in Table V accord¬ 
ing to treatments and replicates, while Table VI summarizes the 
same results according to treatments only* The split-plot 
factorial analysis of variance for these data is presented in 
Table VII. Data for 1951 are similarly presented in Tables 
VIII, IX and X, respectively. 

Discussion 


It has been pointed out that single eyes can pro¬ 
duce more than one sprout or stem. In these experiments, then, 
where seed-pieces were of relatively the same size, their ability 
to produce optimum number of sprouts would be about the same 
regardless of the number of eyes in the seed-piece* The result 
could have been that there was relatively little difference be¬ 
tween the number of sprouts developed by some single-eye and 
some multiple-eye seed-pieces. Although no counts were taken 
of the number of stems in the field from single and multiple 
eyes, it was observed that some of the single-eye seed sets pro¬ 
duced more than one stem. 

It seems possible, therefore, that any yield dif¬ 
ferences that might theoretically have occurred between single

stems and multiple stems from single and multiple eyes, respec¬ 
tively, were modified in practice by the equal weights of the 
seed-pieces tending to result in (1) some single eyes producing 
multiple stems, and (2) some multiple eyes producing single stems 

The only consistent trends for the two years was 
that planting at normal time, May 1$ - 20, gave higher yields 
than late planting, June 9-11* The increased yields due to 
normal planting date did not prove significant in either of the 
two years* 

Tuber Yields as Affected by Shallow and Deep Planting 

with High, Low and No Hilling 

The data for 1950 are presented in Table XI accord¬ 
ing to treatments and replicates, while Table XII summarizes 
the same results according to treatments only* The split-plot 
factorial analysis of variance for these data is presented in 
Table XIII. 

Discussion of 1950 Results 

Inspection of the yield results summarized in 
Table XII shows certain interesting but rather unimportant trends 
In what was a relatively dry growing season, neither shallow 
planting nor high hilling appeared to have a depressing effect 
on mean yields. In fact, a tendency for the reverse seemed to 
exist.

Though drying-out of the soil due to extreme 
ridging would be expected to occur as Thompson (51) says it does 
where rainfall is light, such a process, if it occurred, was 
not reflected in lower yields. The trenches left from the 
ridging may have served as catch basins for the sudden heavy 
rains that fell late in the season, i.e. in August. 

The slightly higher mean yield from the shallow 
planting (Table XII) cannot be explained on this basis, however. 

It might be partly explained on the basis of earlier emergence 
and better capitalization on the early spring moisture at planting 
time. However, increases due to high hilling over no hilling, 
and those due to shallow planting over deep planting were very 
slight, and probably can most safely be attributed to chance. 

The split-plot factorial analysis of variance 
table shows that the treatments studied had no significant 
effects on yield. (Table XIII.) 

Discussion of 1951 Results 

As can be seen by inspection of Table XV, shallow 
planting again showed a higher yield trend. This variance due 
to planting depth, though fairly high, was not significant 
(Table XVI). 

In the 1951 season of well-distributed rainfall 
throughout the growing season, the no-hilling treatment gave

the highest mean yield« Why the low hilling showed a trend for 
lower yields in both deep and shallow planting cannot be explained, 
unless this type of hilling tended to cut more feeder roots under 
the particular conditions of the 1951 season.

SOLANINE DETERMINATIONS 

METHODS OF ANALYSIS 

A different method was used each of the two years 
to extract solanine from the frozen potato tissue samples. 

Once the solanine was obtained, however, the same colorimetric 
method was used each year for its estimation. To gain an under¬ 
standing of methods of extraction, and to appreciate some of 
the difficulties inherent in such studies, a brief review is 
necessary. 

Fluorescence of Potato Tissue in Ultra-Violet Light 

Dabbs (16) attempted to estimate solanine in pure 
solution or in tissue slices by fluorescence in ultra-violet 
light. He noted that all tuber slices showed slight fluores¬ 
cence and that the region of maximum fluorescence was immediately 
under the tuber skin. However, he reports it was impossible 
to estimate differences in intensity of fluorescence. 

Fluorescence c£ tuber slices and potato extracts 
evidently can be caused by several things. Allan (3) found 
fluorescence to occur in the presence of leaf roll virus, and 
it is also known to occur in the presence of Corynebacterium , 
Fusarium and Pythium species of organisms. Newton and Jones 
(AO) report that frost or low temperature injury to potatoes can 
be detected by the fluorescence of the tuber slices under ultra¬ 
violet light, but they found acetone extracts of both normal 
and frozen potato tissue to be fluorescent. This latter effect

may have been due to the solubility' of both solanine and 
solanidine in acetone* The former, however, precipitates out 
first, and, in fact, the preferential solubility of solanidine 
over solanine in acetone makes it possible to separate the two 
and isolate them in the pure state* Dabbs did not try acetone 
extracts, but it is unlikely that such extracts would show dif¬ 
ferences in fluorescence in relation to solanine content* The 
use of ultra-violet light for estimation of solanine can be dis¬ 
counted for two reasons. Not only does it fail to give dif¬ 
ferences in intensity of fluorescence (16), but also it is not 
specific for solanine only (3, 40)* 

Chemical Analysis and Colorimetric-Estimation 

Many methods of solanine analysis in potato plants 
and tubers have been developed in the past. All of them are 
long and involve many steps for its extraction and estimation. 
The earlier workers such as Morgenstern (33), 1907? and Bomer 
and Mattis (7), 1924? used a gravimetric determination, extract¬ 
ing with dilute acetic acid solutions and expressing the extract 
with hydraulic pressure* Lepper (32), in 193&? used a gravi¬ 
metric analysis involving the use of a dilute citric acid solu¬ 
tion* 


According to Pfankuch (42), 193$? the gravimetric 
method of Bomer and Mattis was the standard method up to that 
time* His chief criticism of the method is that it is a long

and tedious one designed to yield only pure solanine. It now 
appears, as Wolf and Duggar (55) have shown, that the most serious 
fault of this method was the arbitrary application of a solubil¬ 
ity correction of 2.75 mg. solanine per 100 ml. of alkaline 
filtrate without checking the pH of the latter. Wolf and 
Duggar showed, in 1946, that no correction factor for solubility 
need be made if solanine were precipitated from an alkaline 
solution above a pH of 9«3* Frequently, with the method of 
Bomer and Mattis, the correction factor exceeded the amount of 
solanine actually recovered. 

Connor (15), in 193$, used an acetic acid extrac¬ 
tion method. The crude solanine precipitate is hydrolyzed 
with hydrochloric acid and the amount of solanine determined by 
a titrimetric determination of reducing sugars split off by 
hydrolysis. To this was : added a solubility correction factor 
of 25 mg. per litre of filtrate. The method has two important 
limitations. It can only be used on relatively high concentra¬ 
tions of solanine solutions (at least 30 mg. per cent), and it 
determines only solanine but not solanidine and solanthrene* 

The food technologist, however, is interested in determining 
total alkaloids. 

Also in 193$* Pfankuch, by adopting Alberti ? s 
sulphuric acid-formaldehyde color reaction to estimating solanine 
by colorimetry, overcame two difficulties at once: a solution 
of impure solanine can be used, from which the total alkaloids

solanine, solanidine and solanthrene can be determined quite 
accurately in amounts within concentrations of 10 to 50 mg. per 
cent, without reference to a curve. With concentrations above 
50 mg. per cent, dilution is recommended for better accuracy. 
Pfankuch (42) states that either acetic acid or dilute sulphuric 
acid can be used successfully as solvents. A light-colored 
filter, wave length 530 mu is used because it does not interfere 
with possible yellow colors in the solution. 

Pfankuch (42) states that the prescribed formalde¬ 
hyde concentration has to be used very accurately as its in¬ 
fluence on the intensity of the color is tremendous, stronger 
concentration giving a deeper color. Though he was satisfied 
with the accuracy of the colorimetric method of determining 
total alkaloids, Pfankuch was not satisfied with extraction 
methods available at that date. He also used a solubility cor¬ 
rection factor of 2.5 mg. per 100 c.c. filtrate. 

Rooke e t al .(45) , working in England in 1943, made 
a critical experimental study of available methods up to that 
date, and finally adopted a modified Pfankuch extraction tech¬ 
nique using a solubility correction factor of .2 mg. per 100 ml. 
filtrate. Dabbs (16), in 1951, recognizing the importance of 
the discovery by Wolf and Duggar (55) that solanine is insoluble 
in aqueous solutions above pH 9#3, adopted Rooke 1 s method of 
extraction but used the method of Wolf and Duggar for adjusting

the pH to 10.2 - 10./+ before precipitation. The resultant 
method he has termed the Standard Analytical Method. It in¬ 
volves no correction for solubility of solanine in the alkaline 
filtrate. Since this method was used for solanine extractions 
of the 1950 samples in the experiments described herein, it is 
outlined in detail below under the headings, ’’Cold Ethanol 
Extraction Method” and ’’Colorimetric Estimations.” 

Cold Ethanol Extraction Method 

1. To thoroughly minced samples (100 - 150 gms.) 
of material add 150 ml. of 95 per cent ethanol, 
followed by 3 c.c. glacial acetic acid. 

2. Stir well and keep 1$ hours with occasional 
stirring. 

3. Filter on a Buchner (Whatman’s #4 paper). 

4. A further two similar extractions of the residue 
are made with 150 ml. of 64 per cent ethanol 
(but no acetic acid). 

5. Combined extracts are concentrated under re¬ 
duced pressure to approximately 50 ml. 

6. 5 gm. of Na 2 S 0 ^ are added and the mixture warmed 
in a water bath for about one-half hour. A 
flocculent precipitate (mostly protein) forms. 

7. The mixture is cooled, 2 ml. of 20 per cent 
H2S0^ added, and is filtered on a Buchner 
(Whatman’s #4 paper). The residue is washed

with about 10 ml* of water* 

£>• The filtrate plus washings is adjusted to pH 
of 10*0 - 10.4 with concentrated NH^OH. 

9. The solanine is precipitated by digesting in 
a water bath for 20 - 30 minutes. 

10. Filter through Whatman T s #42 paper and wash 
the precipitate with about 10 ml. of 2 per cent 
ammonia• 

11. The precipitate is dissolved in three or four 
20 ml. increments of 0.5 per cent acetic acid, 
and made carefully to volume in a 100 ml. 
volumetric flask. 

As stated above, this method was used in the 
analysis of the 1950 samples, but with slight modifications. 
After the filtrate plus washings is adjusted to the pH 10,0 - 
10.4 with concentrated NH^OH, it is transferred to a 250 ml. 
centrifuge flask, digested as above, and cooled. The precipi¬ 
tate is centrifuged for 20 minutes. Decant the filtrate as 
much as possible without disturbing the precipitate. The above 
modification was adopted to save time and difficulties in fil¬ 
tering where large amounts of filtrate are present. 

Colorimetric Estimations 

Colorimetric estimations of the total solanine*

collectively, and is hereafter designated as solanine.

present were then made according to Pfankuch T s method (42) as 
modified by Wolf and Duggar (55)• This method is briefly as 
follows: 

1. Three millilitres of the .5 per cent acetic 
acid solution are measured out by precision 
pipette into a 50 ml. Erlenmeyer flask. 

2. Six millilitres of concentrated sulphuric acid 
(C. P.) are added drop by drop while swirling 
the Erlenmeyer in an ice-bath. 

3. The yellow solution which forms is allowed to 
stand for one minute. 

4. Then three millilitres of 1 per cent formaldehyde 
are added drop by drop with cooling in ice-bath 
as before. 

5. With the addition of the formaldehyde, the 
yellow color changes to orange, then red, and 
finally to violet-red. 

6. Forty to fifty minutes after the last drop of 
formaldehyde is added, the maximum per cent 
absorption is read from the Fisher Electro¬ 
photometer, using a green filter with maximum 
light transmission at 525 mu. 

Pfankuch (42) and Rooke et al (45) used a filter 
with maximum light transmission at 530 mu, while that employed 
by Wolf and Duggar (55) allowed maximum transmission at 540 mu.

All these workers allowed 90 minutes to elapse before taking 
readings. However, Dabbs (16) found maximum absorption to 
occur between 40 - 50 minutes after adding the last drop of 
formaldehyde, so readings were taken at that time. 

Calculations 

Two colors are run for each extraction and each 
extraction is done in duplicate so that at least four absorption 
readings are obtained for each sample. The mean of these four 
readings is converted to mg. solanine by multiplying by a 
Calibration Factor previously calculated with a pure solanine 
solution of known concentration. The Calibration Factor used 
was 0.4266, and the calculation is made on the basis of 100 gms. 
fresh weight of tuber. 

Soxhlet Extraction liet hods 

Before proceeding to the method used on the 1951 
samples, it will be necessary to mention briefly the method 
published by Wolf and Duggar (55) in 1946. Essentially, it is 
as follows: 


After three 1-hour extractions with .25 per cent 
acetic acid, the combined extracts are made slightly ammoniacal 
as soon as prepared to prevent enzyme activity, and a bit of 
diatomaceous earth added.

The extract is evaporated to dryness, then they 
proceed to re-extract the crude dried extract in a Soxhlet with 
95 per cent ethanol for two l$-hour periods, regrinding the 
residue once between extractions. They state that Bomer and 
Mattis extracted in this manner for tw r o 5-hour periods regrind¬ 
ing the residue once, while they report Valentin reground the 
residue three times for a total of 12 hours of Soxhlet extrac¬ 
tion. 


Dabbs (16) conceived the clever idea of using 
acidified ethanol for a single Soxhlet extraction period of 18 
to 20 hours on a 25 gm. sample of the fresh tuber material. 

Only 5 drops of glacial acetic acid are added to 125 ml. of 95 
per cent ethanol. This method w T as used for the 1951 samples. 

In other ways, the method for obtaining the 
protein-free precipitate from the crude extract is essentially 
the same as described for the cold ethanol extraction method, 
except proportionally smaller amounts of reagents are used, 
fewer transfers are required, and the precipitate is made up to 
only 50 ml. Though Dabbs (16) claimed to be able to complete 
an extraction in duplicate and run the color determination in 
24 hours, the procedure followed in the work outlined here allowed 
the solanine to precipitate overnight in the refrigerator, and 
also allowed the washed precipitate and filter-paper to become 
absolutely dry before making up to volume for colorimetric 
estimation. Also solutions of solanine and of 1 per cent

formaldehyde reagent were not allowed to stand longer than 
overnight prior to making determinations, and preferably were 
made up the same day. 


SOLANINE RESULTS - 1950 

The long method gave unsatisfactory results. It 
required about 5 ^ days to complete duplicate analyses on one 
sample, and when more samples were run simultaneously a longer 
time elapsed. Repeated analyses often failed to give satis¬ 
factory checks. 


Results obtained are tabulated in Tables XVII 
and XVIII. No treatment trends are evident from the data. 

No analysis of this data has been attempted as it was felt that 
too much uncontrolled error existed in many cases between in¬ 
dividual estimations on a single sample. It Is believed that 
due to the method employed, the extraction of many samples was 
either incomplete or there was a loss of solanine by decomposition 
when the extract was allowed to remain in an acid condition for 
long. Wolf and Duggar (55) made the dilute acetic acid extracts 
ammoniacal as soon as prepared. A similar procedure with the 
acidified cold ethanol extracts might have given more uniform 
results for the 1950 samples.

SOLANINE RESULTS - 1951 

Estimated Solanine Concentrations Resulting from Normal and 

Late Planting; with Single and Multiple Eyes 

The data for 1951 are presented in Table XIX 
according to treatments and replicates, while Table XX summarizes 
these results according to treatments only# 

Discussion 


Two features of this data are worth noting: 

(1) The rather consistent trend toward different 
solanine concentrations for each replicate, regardless of cul¬ 
tural treatments# 

(2) The tendency for late-planted multiple eyes to 
yield tubers with less solanine and for normal-planted multiple 
eyes to yield tubers with more solanine. In other words, the 
additional shading that may have been provided by multiple-eye 
sets over that provided by single-eye sets, while it appears to 
have resulted in slightly lower mean solanine concentrations in 
late plantings, showed a reverse tendency in normal plantings. 

The above-mentioned features are accented in the split-plot 
analysis of variance table (Table XXI), where the tendency for 
the single eyes to behave in a manner opposite to the multiple- 
eyes, results in a mean square of zero for eyes alone but a rather

large variance due to interaction between eyes and dates of 
planting. The latter variance is not significant, however, nor 
is the variance due to replicates. 

Estimated Solanine Concentrations Resulting from 
Shallow and Deep Planting with High. Low and No Hilling 

These data are presented according to treatments 
and replicates in Table XXII and summarized according to treat¬ 
ments only in Table XXIII. 

Discussion 

The tendency for solanine concentrations to vary 
more with the replicate than with the treatment is even more 
marked/,in the previous experiment. In fact, the split-plot 
factorial analysis of variance table (Table XXIV) shows the 
variance due to replicates significant at the 5 per cent level. 

Two other less notable trends are the higher solanine concentra¬ 
tions found in the shallow planting, especially with no hilling, 
though deep planting showed a similar trend. 

The results of this experiment are just the opposite 
to what was expected. It was thought that replicate variation 
would be small, but that treatments which caused or allowed tubers 
to form and remain close to the surface of the soil would result 
in significantly higher solanine concentrations due to less soil

coverage on the tubers and consequent greater solanine synthesis 
from solar radiation* 

Solar radiations, especially if high in ultra¬ 
violet light could conceivably cause higher solanine concentra¬ 
tions in the growing potato tubers, as Conner (15) has shown 
that solanine synthesis does occur in tubers exposed to ultra¬ 
violet light, without the concurrent greening* One would expect 
to find solar radiations high in ultra-violet energy in regions 
of clear skies, especially at higher altitudes where less filter¬ 
ing from the atmosphere occurs* 

Depth of soil cover, type of soil and amount of 
shading by the potato tops also could be factors which might in¬ 
fluence the amount and quality of solar radiations which the 
growing tubers may receive* 

Table XXIII shoT^s that a slight increase in the 
mean solanine concentration occurred in the shallow-planted sets 
that received no-hilling treatment. Deep-planted sets similarly 
treated were scarcely affected. In the remaining plots of the 
experiment where hilling was practiced, the mean solanine con¬ 
centrations for shallow planting was no greater than for deep 
planting* Nor was there any difference between low hilling 
and high hilling* 

These effects result in variation due to hilling 
being noticeable but not significant (Table XXIV).

Conclusions 

On the basis of the significance of replicate 
variance in the latter experiment, it is concluded that replicates 
receiving the same cultural treatments show significant differences 
in solanine content* Therefore, the cultural treatments studied 
did not have as great an effect on the occurrence of solanine in 
the tubers as did other conditions of the environment* The 
high replicate variance indicates that the soil environment may 
be a much more decisive factor in affecting solanine concentra¬ 
tions than was hitherto supposed. The outcome of the experiment 
stresses the importance of having uniform field conditions on 
which to apply the experimental design* 

The factorial experiments have shown that the cul¬ 
tural practices studied are not major factors in the occurrence 
of solanine in growing potatoes. Except for the early and late 
planting, these factors were designed primarily to check on the 
possible effects of solar radiation upon solanine synthesis in 
the potato tubers. 

It was found, in the 1951 season, under Edmonton 
conditions, that with normal soil cover and top growth the effect 
of solar radiation on solanine synthesis in the tubers is negligible. 
It was also found that the more immature tubers from the late 
planting do not contain more solanine than the more mature tubers 
from normal planting.

The discussion could be terminated conveniently 
at this point. However, a further dissertation is presented 
(see page 75) with the hope that it may provide valuable clues 
for the ultimate solution of the problem of solanine bitterness 
in table potatoes.

OTHER FACTORS OF THE ENVIRONMENT 


Solanine is undoubtedly present to a more or less 
degree in potatoes everywhere. It is also quite evident that 
certain conditions of growth and storage result in the occurrence 
of higher concentrations. Obviously, there must be some specific 
factor or combination of factors of the environmental field con¬ 
ditions that contribute to higher solanine concentrations in the 
tubers. Rather than a combination of factors, it may sometimes 
be the result of a succession of factors or conditions. The 
reason why some potatoes f? become tf bitter in storage is very like¬ 
ly due to a higher-than-normal initial solanine content, plus a 
normal synthesis or accumulation in storage. Occasionally, 
samples are extremely high in solanine when dug. The literature 
relating to the effect of storage has been reviewed. It is be¬ 
yond the scope of this study to delve into the causal factors 
of apparent solanine synthesis in storage. 

Why, then, do some potato samples contain too much 
solanine when dug? The problem must be tied up with the nitrogen 
and carbohydrate metabolism of the potato plant. 

Biochemical and Physiological Considerations 

Street and co-workers (49) made a study of the 
nature and distribution of nitrogen in the potato plant. They 
state that solanine is part of the possible mobile nitrogen.

This mobile nitrogen, that form most actively involved in trans¬ 
location, they classified as "other nitrogen." "Other nitrogen" 
equals total non-protein nitrogen minus the sum of ammonia, amide, 
amino and nitrate nitrogen. The basis for their belief that 
"other nitrogen" is the mobile form in the potato was that they 
found what they called a positive concentration gradient increas¬ 
ing as they progressed from roots to stems to petioles to leaves. 

"Other nitrogen" is quantitatively an important 
fraction of the non-protein nitrogen in all parts of the plant. 

It is complex in composition and will include: 

polypeptide and peptide nitrogen; 

purine nitrogen, i.e. xanthine, hypoxanthine, 
quanine, adenine; 

nitrogen of the simple bases - choline, cadaverine, 
narcotine, acetylcholine; 

non-amino nitrogen of arginine, histidine, proline 
and tryptophane; and 

total solanine nitrogen, which is quantitatively 
an unimportant fraction of this mobile 
nitrogen. 

Choline makes up an important part of the simple 
natural bases in the potato, and it is postulated that it functions 
in biological methylations generally, and alkaloidal synthesis 
particularly.

Street and co-workers (49), to convert solanine to 
solanine nitrogen, multiplied by the factor .016. In fact, they 
say that the values recorded for solanine content, if expressed 
in terms of nitrogen, represent only a very minute fraction of 
the "other nitrogen.” 

Conversely, then, only 1 mg. of choline nitrogen 
or any other fraction of mobile nitrogen, if entirely converted 
to solanine nitrogen in solanine will become 62.5 mg. solanine, 
which is two to three times the upper limit of safety and which 
is about ten times that normally found in potatoes. So it can 
readily be seen that the slightest physiological unbalance could 
readily produce very high solanine with resultant bitterness in 
potatoes. 


This physiological upset might conceivably be caused 
by some environmental factor or factors which may be difficult 
or impossible to control under field conditions. In the Wetted 
Gem variety there may be a genetical predisposition towards this 
upset, say under certain conditions of the environment, expecially 
at a certain developmental stage* 

The manifestation of the physiological upset is 
large amounts of solanine in the potatoes when dug. Whether the 
disorder involves abnormal synthesis of solanine in the tuber or 
translocation of excessive amounts to the tuber is of little con¬ 
cern at the moment. The net result is the same. Such physiolog-

ical disturbances may be caused by a number of factors: 

(a) Mechanical injuries caused by frost and hail . 

There is evidence that the occurrence of damage to 
the plants from summer hail and frost increases the incidence of 
solanine in this variety especially* Frequently, when the history 
of a bitter sample is investigated, it is found that one or both 
of these phenomena are involved* That frozen tops can cause 
higher solanine in the tubers is more than mere speculation, as 
seen by Table XXV-, which shows the results of successive solanine 
determinations on samples of Netted Gem potatoes taken at weekly 
intervals from September 3 to October 1.

The most noteworthy thing about the data is that 
little or no solanine was found in the potato samples taken before 
the killing frost on September 22. Samples taken on September 
24, two days after the killing frost, had a heavy protein precipi¬ 
tate and solanine was found in both samples in some quantity for 
the first time. However, two out of three of the samples taken 
a wwek later showed decreased solanine content again. The higher 
solanine in the third sample may be related, in part, to the 
small number of tubers in the hill and small total yield of the 
hill. It also may be related to proximity of tubers to the sur¬ 
face. It was noted that one tuber was sunburned at the tip. 

What caused the sudden rise in solanine in the tubers after the 
killing frost is difficult to say, unless the solanine moved down 
from the frozen tops by simple diffusion. Two other possibilities 
are that it was translocated from the unfrozen portion of the 
stem that was protected by soil, or that it moved out of the 
roots into the tubers. 

That a killing frost appears to cause sudden in¬ 
creases in solanine concentration of tubers attached to frozen 
tops has been demonstrated. Whether this sudden rise is only 
temporary is uncertain. (Table XXV.) Light summer frosts and 
hail damage to the tops could conceivably Cause even a greater 
physiological upset because the plant remains alive. A succession 
of such phenomena is not unknown and might result in a highly 
abnormal cumulative concentration of solanine in the tubers.

(b) Mineral deficiencies or nutritional unbalance . 

A physiological disturbance caused by a lack of a 
major or minor element or an excess of one in relation to avail¬ 
ability of others is not impossible. In fact, the high replicate 
variance, especially in the hilling experiments, points rather to 
a difference in available nitrogen or other major element (e.g., 

P or K)* Since nitrogen is directly involved in the formation 
of the solanine molecule, it seems the most likely of the three. 

As with the Nicotiana spp. and Cinchona ledgeriana , high nitrogen 
levels may result in higher alkaloid production in the potato. 

I . 

It must not be assumed at once, however, that excess 
nitrogen is the cause of abnormal solanine in the tuber. A sample 
of very bitter tubers was received from Leedale, Alberta, in 
October, 1951> which were reported to have caused sore throats 
when eaten. Analysis showed an estimated solanine content ranging 
from 50 - 63 mg. per 100 gm. This concentration is dangerously 
high. A quick soil test of available nutrients revealed that the 
soil in which the potatoes were grown was abnormally high in phos¬ 
phorus and relatively high in potash. The figures in p.p*m. for 
the three major elements N, P and K were 1, 10 and 35, respectively. 
Compare this with other random analyses of garden soils of 6 - 0.5 
- 30, or 5 - 0.5 - 5, analyzed at the same time. The disproportional 
amounts of available major elements merit closer study as possible 
factors contributing to solanine bitterness in Netted Gem potatoes.

The history of the potato crop in question was 
normal otherwise, except that hail damage had been suffered during 
the season. 


These two bits of evidence lend strong support to 
the theory of a physiological disturbance caused by mechanical 
injuries or nutritional unbalance or a combination of the two.

GENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


Netted Gem potatoes were grown for two seasons in 
two split-plot factorial field cultural experiments. The factors 
studied were normal and late planting with single and multiple 
eyes, and deep and shallow planting with three levels of hilling. 

Yield data and tuber samples for solanine analysis 
were taken each year at digging time. To offset any complication 
of solanine results by different storage histories, the 1951 tuber 
samples were minced in a Waring Blendor and quick-frozen one 
month after digging. 

A modification of the cold alcohol extraction method 
of Rooke was used on the 1950 samples, but was found unsatisfactory. 
The new acidified ethanol Soxhlet extraction method of Dabbs proved 
very satisfactory with the 1951 samples. No solubility correc¬ 
tion factor was used in either method; the pH of the solanine 
filtrate being adjusted to 10.2 to 10.4 after the method of Wolf 
and Duggar. 


It is possible that the cold ethanol extraction 
method (modified Rooke method) might have given more reliable 
results if the combined extracts had been made alkaline as soon as 
prepared, as Wolf and Duggar did with the dilute acetic acid 
extraction. 

Solanine concentrations were estimated colorimetrical- 
ly with a Fisher Electrophotometer from a 0.5 per cent acetic acid

solution of the final precipitate according to the method of 
Pfankuch as modified by Wolf and Duggar. 

No treatment or other trends were evident in the 
solanine results for 1950• The 1951 samples showed an average 
solanine concentration in mg. per 100 gms. fresh weight of £,34 
- £.40 for the two experiments. These results compare very well 
with figures reported by other reliable sources, but were higher 
than those reported for the variety under Wisconsin conditions. 

A statistical analysis was made of the solanine 
estimations for the 1951 treatments. A marked, though not sig¬ 
nificant, interaction existed between the time of planting and 
number of eyes in the seed-pieces. Lower mean solanine concentra¬ 
tions were found in the tuber samples from multiple eyes planted 
late and single eyes planted at normal time. 

A high replicate variance for solanine concentration 
was found in both experiments in the 1951 season. In the depth 
of planting experiment with three levels of hilling, there were 
significant differences in solanine concentration between replicates. 

Normal planting gave consistently, but not signifi¬ 
cantly, greater yields than late planting both years. No con¬ 
sistent differences were found in the yields obtained from single 
and multiple eyes. Shallow planting gave yields equal to or 




34 


greater than deep planting, though differences were not significant. 
Depth of hilling had no effect on yield either of the two years. 

On the basis of the experiments reported herein, it 
is concluded that the cultural treatments studied had no significant 
effect on the occurrence of solanine in Netted Gem potatoes, nor 
upon the tuber yields. 

On the basis of the significant replicate variance 
for solanine concentrations, it is further concluded that the 
uncontrolled factors of the environment in one experiment had a 
greater influence upon the solanine concentrations than did the 
cultural practices studied. 

It is established that solanine, if present in the 
tuber in sufficient amounts, results in a bitter flavor. It is 
suggested that solanine bitterness may be a non-parasitic physiolog¬ 
ical disorder, to which the Netted Gem variety is extremely sus¬ 
ceptible. It is postulated, with some supporting evidence, that 
such a physiological disorder might result from a nutritional 
unbalance, or from mechanical injuries as from frost or hail or 
both. 

It is shown that if as minute a quantity as only 
one mg. of nitrogen is entirely converted to solanine nitrogen, 
it will result in 62.5 mg* of solanine, so that a normal balance 
in the carbohydrate-nitrogen metabolism of the potato plant is 
extremely important.

APPENDIX I 

Potato Taste Panel 

A taste test was conducted on potato samples from 
cultural treatment lots selected for their representative solanine 
levels based on chemical analysis. The purpose was to determine 
if there was any correlation between the estimated solanine and 
degree of bitterness. Two tubers were pressure-cooked from each 
treatment, skins intact, then sampled for bitterness. In spite 
of the fact that the chemically analyzed samples were quick- 
frozen in November, while the taste-tested tubers were cooked on 
March 17, there was a marked correlation between estimated solanine 
and apparent bitterness. The results of the taste panel are 
shown in Table XXVI.

APPENDIX II 


Solanine Analyses on Tubers from a 

Potato Fertilizer Experiment 

Materials and Methods 

In 1950, potato samples were taken at digging time 
from the treatment rows of a fertilizer trial at the Provincial 
Horticultural Station, Brooks, Alberta, The land is a sandy 
loam which had been in alfalfa hay production for the two previous 
seasons. All crops on this land are irrigated, the potatoes 
having received two irrigations in 1950. The pipe and furrow 
method of irrigation was used. Planting was done on June 5, and 
samples were dug October 4« 

Four 6-ounce tubers were selected from each treat¬ 
ment, minced in the Waring Blendor and frozen in quadruplicate 
150-gram samples in November, 1950. The frozen samples were not 
analyzed until February, 1952, when they were thawed and 25-gram 
samples extracted in duplicate by Dabbs 1 acidified ethanol Soxhlet 
extraction method. The solanine was estimated colorimetricall}/ 
as previously described. The results are tabulated in Table 
XXVII.

* All estimates of solanine are expressed in milligrams

Discussion and Conclusion 

An analysis of variance of the data treated as a 
randomized block design (which it was) showed no significant dif¬ 
ferences in solanine concentrations for treatments or replicates. 
Results are in agreement with those of most other workers (7, 9, 32) 
inasmuch as the fertilizers used had no effect on the solanine 
content of the tubers. These conclusions should not be accepted 
as final. The results of this and other experiments previously 
discussed indicate the desirability of conducting further studies 
on the effect of nutrition on solanine in potatoes, especially 
where the relative availability of the major elements required 
for growth is known and correlated with solanine content of the 


tubers
