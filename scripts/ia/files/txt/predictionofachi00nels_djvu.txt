CHAPTER I 

THE PROBLEM 

The prediction of achievement at the university level is an 
important problem. In recent years overcrowded conditions in most 
faculties have made it advisable to take measures which would insure 
that the most promising candidates be admitted. Predictive studies 
can provide fairly reliable estimates of student abilities, capaci¬ 
ties, and previous academic achievement and their relation to 
expected attainment in university. Such studies thus give substan¬ 
tial aid in the selection of prospective candidates. They also 
provide a basis for the guidance of the individual 1 s studies into 
those channels which will yield him the greatest return for Iris 
efforts. 

Limited facilities have made it necessary to restrict regis¬ 
tration in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Alberta. 

As a result the faculty has had recourse to admissions based on 
academic standing in the matriculation courses of the Grade XII 
examinations. It has been felt that other criteria might profit¬ 
ably be added. A more objective means of selecting prospective first 
year engineering students would conceivably eliminate many of those 
who are at present unable to meet academic standards and perhaps 
even those who lack sufficient interest to maintain their grades. 

An attempt will be made in the present study to provide a more 
suitable means for screening prospective first year engineering 
candidates. The main problem will be to find to what extent certain

individual performance records can be used to predict academic 
achievement in first year engineering® It is further hoped that on 
the basis of this study worthwhile suggestions may be made for the 
guidance of future first year engineering students® 

Academic achievement can never be predicted with perfect ef¬ 
ficiency. In the first place, the tests upon which prediction is 
based do not give a complete picture of the quality or qualities 
which they are designed to measure. Further, there is often consi¬ 
derable variation in the performance of an individual on the same 
test at different times® These are merely limitations inherent in 
the measuring instruments themselves. Added to this there is no 
method at present available to control and evaluate motivation® 
Temporary emotional disturbances and many other subtle personality 
factors which affect performance tend to make individual prediction 
uncertain. Thus general trends should b© sought in predictive 
studies and individual predictions should be made with caution.

CHAPTER II 


RELATED STUDIES 


Prediction of achievement at the college level is usually based 
on one or several of the following types of measuring devices: 

a. Aptitude tests 

b. Tests of mental ability 

c. Achievement records and tests 

i. High school averages 

ii. Previous college records 

iii. Achievement tests* 

The correlation coefficients which have been reported by various 
investigators for each of these categories appear in the tables below* 
Unless the prediction is concerned with achievement in engineering 
the school and faculty are not given.

High school averages were reported as the best single criterion 
of college achievement by Edds and McCall (7), Cohen (4), Jones and 
Laslett (ll), Schmitz (lo) and Crawford (5). It was further stated 
by Crawford that high school averages are the most suitable index of 
motivation at present available. However, Douglas (6), Cohen (4), 
Byrns (3), Jones and Laslett (ll), Vaughn (16), and Wagner (19) 
suggest that letter gradings for high school courses are not suffi¬ 
ciently accurate for predictive studies. Thurber (15) states that 
two-fifths of college students in the sophomore year were found to be 
in the same quartile as they were when they left high school. In a 
study by Crawford (5) it was found that more than two-thirds of the 
individual predictions, made on the basis of high school averages, 
differed by not more than four points from the student’s actual 
grade-point average. Byrns (3) reports that predictions for students 
of low academic standing are more valid than those made for above 
average freshmen. The minimum high school requirement is attacked 
by Bolenbough and Proctor (l), Douglas (16), and Sorenson (14)| 
who say that it permits as many inferior students as superior to 
enter college. 

The best prognostic value was found by Feder (9), Hurd (10), 
and Wakeman (£0) to be in those aptitude and achievement tests based 
on the subject in which the prediction is required. Further, Edmiston 
(8) reports that the most valuable aptitude tests are those which are 
based directly on ?/ork to come. Vaughn (17) and members of the 
Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education are at present 
constructing and validating the first form of an engineering aptitude 
test for high school students who wish to begin engineering study.

Lingren (l£) states that interest inventories are not likely to be 
of any value in the prediction of academic achievement but that they 
may be useful as an interviewing aid* 

Summary 

Findings of investigators who have conducted studies con¬ 
cerned with the prediction of college achievement follow. 

t 

a. The best basis for the prognosis of first year college 
grades is the student 1 s previous record of academic achievement, but 
correlations seldom exceed 0.70. 

b. Aptitude tests prove most valuable as predictors when 
they are based directly on the work for which the prognosis of 
aptitude is required. 

c. Investigators have found that high scores on predic¬ 
tive instruments do not predict academic success to the extent that 
low scores predict failure. In other words, a prediction of failure 
may be made with more confidence than one of success.

CHAPTER III 

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 

1. GENERAL DESIGN 

Immediately after registration in the 1948-49 session, pros¬ 
pective first year engineering students at the University of Alberta 
were given four tests designed to measure individual abilities, ap¬ 
titudes and interests. The present study has been conducted to 
determine the value of these tests and of high school averages for 
predicting achievement in first year engineering. In treating the 
problem it was felt that each of the following factors should be 
given consideration: 

a. The relationship between each test of the battery, which 
is made up of the predictive tests given and the high school averages, 
and the criterion of achievement in first year engineering. 

b. Appropriate statistical measures to check the signi¬ 
ficance of the relationships. 

c. The order of merit of the tests for predicting achieve¬ 
ment in first year engineering. 

d. A possible combination of test scores, with suitable 
weighting, to give a composite score which would predict academic 
achievement in first year engineering more efficiently than any one 
test of the battery.

e. Possible alterations in the test battery, on the basis 
of previous related studies and present findings, which would likely 
increase its value as a predictive instrument. 

f. Use of the predictive test results for the selection 
and guidance of future first year engineering students. 

2. THE TEST BATTERY 

The battery to be evaluated is made up of data from high school 
records and from the four tests administered to first year engineering 
students at the beginning of the session. The results from these 
four predictive tests were compiled under the direction of Dr. H. E. 
Smith, Faculty of Education, University of Alberta. This set of tests 
was made up of the following: 

a. Thurstone 5 s Psychological Test of Mental Ability 

b. Iowa Physics Aptitude Test 

c. Iowa Mathematics Aptitude Test 

d. Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest Inventory. 

There are scores available for eleven different categories of the 
Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest Inventory. Of these only those under 
the headings ! Level of Interest 1 , * Computational 1 , and 'Scientific 5 
were used in this study, since they were considered most closely 
related to the engineering curricula. Thus the raw scores from the 
four tests made up six separate sets of data. The seventh set of data 

consisted of the arithmetic means of the individual Grade XII mathe- 

% 

matics and science scores (Algebra 2, Trigonometry and Analytical 
Geometry, and two of Chemistry 2 , Physics 2, and Biology 2).

Since the space taken by table headings must be limited, the 
tests of the battery will be referred to in headings as follows: 

High school mathematics-science averages by H,S,A., Iowa Physics 
Aptitude test by I.P.A., Iowa Mathematics Aptitude by I.M.A., 

Thurstone’s Psychological Test of Mental Ability by T.P.T., and 
Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest Inventoiy by O.I.I. 

3* ACHIEVEMENT RECORDS 

Four sets of achievement tests were given to first year engineers 
throughout the session; two mid-term (November and February) and two 
term tests (Christmas and Final), The subjects Chemistry 40, Drawing 
4, Mathematics 21, Mathematics 22, and Physics 21 were tested in the 
mid-term examinations. An additional subject. Drawing 2, was included 
in the Christmas and Final examinations. 

For the purposes of this study the criterion of academic achieve¬ 
ment in first year engineering will be the arithmetic mean of the 
scores obtained by each student in the six courses of the final examina¬ 
tions. However, it is felt that the Christmas averages may be useful 
as a check on the criterion. Since Drawing 2 was omitted from the 
mid-term tests and since these tests are usually of a less searching 
and comprehensive nature, the results from them have not been used 
in this study. 


4. THE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS 

First year engineering students who met the following require¬ 
ments made up the experimental group for this study:

a. The student must have written all the predictive tests 
at the beginning of the session. 

b. He must have written all tests in the Christmas and 
Final set of examinations. 

c. He must have written his Grade XII examinations in 
Alberta schools. 

d. He must have taken only first year engineering courses. 

Altogether there were one hundred seventy-six students registered 
in first year engineering and of these one hundred sixteen qualified 
for inclusion in the experimental group* For the purposes of this 
study, it is assumed that the sampling distribution of final average 
scores for first year engineering students is normal. It is further 
assumed that the distribution of final average scores obtained by 
the experimental group is representative of those obtained by all 
first year engineers in the final examinations. 

If this distribution is fitted to a normal curve and chi-square 
calculated, it is found that a value of chi-aquare at least as great 
as that obtained here could be expected in approximately sixty per¬ 
cent of all samples (N s 116), drawn at random from a normal mi verse.

The results of this test give no reason to suspect the hypothesis 
that this distribution is representative of final average scores 
obtained by all first year engineering students* 

5. STATISTICAL PLATT 

The statistical procedure followed in the attempt to solve the 
problem and validate the results is given below. 

a. The means and standard deviations for all sets of data 
were computed. 

b. The product-moment correlation coefficients between 
each of the predictive tests and both sets of data for academic 
achievement were then calculated and their significance checked. It 
is assumed that the relationship which existed,, if any, bet?/een the 
various predictive tests and the criterion was linear and that the 
results are derived from a random sample of a normal universe. 

c. In the case where the correlation coefficients between 
a particular predictive test and the Christmas averages differed 
from that found for the same test and the final averages, an appropri¬ 
ate test for the significance of the difference was applied. This 
procedure was intended to serve as a check on the criterion, final 
averages. 

d. Appropriate tests of significance for the difference 
in correlation coefficients found between each useful test of the 
battery and the criterion of achievement were applied.

3. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS 

The decision as to whether or not the correlation coefficients 
are significant will be based on the tenets of the null hypothesis* 

If the T ratio* the correlation coefficient divided by the standard 
error of the correlation coefficient, exceeds 2*5 the null hypothesis 
will be rejected. A T ratio of 2,5 is roughly the 1% level of sig¬ 
nificance* If the T ratio lies between 2 and 2.5, the significance 
of the correlation coefficient will be considered doubtful* For a 
T ratio of less than 2, which is approximately the 5% level of sig¬ 
nificance, the null hypothesis will be accepted as tenable. In other 
words, a value of less than 2 for the T ratio will indicate that the 
correlation coefficient cannot be considered significantly different 


from zero

CHAPTER V 


SIGNIFICANCE OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS 

The general formula by which the signifance of differences 

w 

between correlation coefficients is general a calculated (l) could 
not be used here* In this study the sample is dependent and in an 
cases one array is common to the two sets of bi-variates* An ap¬ 
propriate test for these conditions is discussed fully in Peatman 
(l), pages 420-22* In order that this test may be used it is neces¬ 
sary that the correlation coefficients between each pair of predic¬ 
tive tests and between the achievement tests be found* These coef¬ 
ficients are shown in the table below.

The same courses were tested on the Christmas and final examina¬ 
tions; therefore both measurements of achievement are directly 
comparable. The differences for correlation coefficients found 
between a predictive test and the Christmas averages and between 
the same test and the final averages will be tested. This will 
serve to indicate whether there are any significant trends in the 
magnitude of the correlation coefficients between the various predic¬ 
tive tests and achievement tests given at different times. The 
results of this procedure are shown in the table below.

Since the final marks are the criterion of success or failure 
in the Faculty of Engineering, the average of these scores have been 
taken as the criterion of achievement in first year engineering for 
the purposes of this study. To find the order of merit of the pre¬

Summary 

1* None of the predictive tests, when correlated with the 
Christinas averages, yields a correlation coefficient significantly 
different from that found for the same test on the final averages. 
Thus, assuming that these achievement tests are equally valid, there 
is no significant trend in the magnitudes of any of the correlation 
coefficients for the period between the tests. 

Z . The correlation coefficient found between the high school 
average scores and the criterion is significantly greater than the 
correlation coefficients for the criterion and the Iowa Mathematics 
Aptitude test and Thurston© f s Psychological test® For the experimen¬ 
tal group, the linear relationship between scores on the Iowa Physics 
test and final averages was found to be significantly greater than 
that between scores on the Thurston© Psychological test and the final 
averages® Any other comparison of the predictive tests indicates 
that the correlation coefficients with the criterion are not signifi¬ 
cantly different from each other,

CHAPTER VI 

METHODS OF MAKING THE PREDICTION OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT 
1. THE PROBLEM OF PREDICTION 

The correlation coefficients which have been found reveal only 
the extent to which the tests of the battery and the criterion of 
achievement in first year engineering are related* To make an esti¬ 
mate of expected average scores in first year engineering the equa¬ 
tion of the regression line of the final average scores on the pre¬ 
dictive test scores must be obtained. An inspection of the scatter 
diagrams in the appendix will, reveal that there is wide variation 
of the obtained scores from this regression line. The greater this 
variation the more caution must be used in predicting a final average 
score. 

It is usually possible to Increase predictive efficiency by 
finding multiple correlation coefficients between a combination of 
two or more predictive tests and the criterion. Generally speaking 9 
these coefficients will be larger than the linear correlation coef¬ 
ficients found between any one test used in the combination and the 
criterion. A composite weighted score for the combination can be 
found for each individual and the regression equation can be found 
for this group. The estimate of a final average score from this 
equation may be made with more confidence than one made on the basis 
of marks obtained in only one of the predictive tests.

Zo REGRESSION EQUATIONS OF SINGLE PREDICTORS 

In order that the final average score in first year engineering 
may be estimated from the score on any of the predictive tests, the 
regression equations have been calculated* The following table shows 
the required regression equation, the standard error of estimate, and 
the predictive efficiency for each test of the battery* Since none 
of the categories of the Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest Inventory 
was found to have any predictive value, they will not be included*

An example will serve to illustrate the use of the regression 
equation in making an estimate of the expected final average score in 
first year engineering. The regression equation for predicting the 
final average score from high school averages is: 0.96Xg - 9.0. 

Suppose an individual has a high school mathematics-science average 
of 85. This number is substituted for Xg in the regression equation. 
Thus the estimated final score in first year engineering, X^, is 
72.6. Approximately 68$ of all such predictions could be expected 
to fall within the limits 62*6 to 82.6 providing all cases in the 
particular column in the scatter diagram are distributed normally. 

An estimate on the basis of high school averages could be considered 
to be 25$ more efficient than a guess. This measure of predictive ef¬ 
ficiency, first used by C. Hull, is the proportionate reduction of 
error of estimate from the maximum error observed when the correla¬ 
tion is zero.-*-

3. USE OF MULTIPLE CORRELATION IN PREDICTION 

An attempt has been made to increase the predictive efficiency 
of the test battery by combining pairs of predictive tests using the 
multiple correlation technique outlined by Peatman (l), pages 482-85, 
The results of this procedure are shown in the table below,

The highest predictive efficiency obtainable by this procedure 
is given when the results of the Iowa Physics Aptitude test and the 
high school averages are combined. If the results of each of these 
tests are expressed as standard measures, the weights required for 
the scores on each test to give a linear correlation coefficient 
of 0,71 may be calculated.'*’ The procedure indicates that the indivi-

dual standard score on the Iowa Physics Aptitude test should be 
given approximately three-fifths as much weight as those of the high 
school averages 

Providing the distribution of scores on each test is nearly 
normal, the original scores will be approximately proportional to 
the standard scores. Thus only a small error will be introduced 
if the original scores are given their found weights and the sum 
of these taken as the predictive scores. If it is assumed that the 
distributions of scores on the Iowa Physics Aptitude test and the 
high school averages approach the normal form the original scores on 
each may be weighted in the following manner: high school averages 
multiplied by 1, and the Iowa Physics Aptitude test scores by 0.6 
The set of data obtained by this procedure for the experimental group., 
when correlated with the final average scores, yields a coefficient 
of 0.70. The regression equation for predicting final average 
scores was found to be: X^> = 0.87Xg - 16.0. The procedure as outlined 
here saves the labor of transforming scores to their standard form 
and, providing the distribution of scores on each test does not de¬ 
viate too far from the normal form, gives only a slightly smaller 
correlation coefficient than that obtained by multiple correlation.

Summary 

1. High school mathematics-science averages were found to be 
the best single predictor of final average scores in first year en¬ 
gineering. A prediction made on the basis of high school mathematics- 
science averages in approximately 25% better than a guess. 

2. The highest multiple correlation coefficient for any two of 
the predictive tests with the criterion was found when high school 
mathematics-science average scores and Iowa Physics Aptitude test 
scores were combined. The predictive efficiency of the combination 
is approximately 29% better than a guess.

CHAPTER VII 

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS 

1* CONCLUSIONS 

The general conclusions which may be drawn from the findings 
of this study follow. 

a. The categories, 'Level of Interest', 'Scientific*, 

and 'Computational* of the Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest Inventory 
were found to have no value in predicting subsequent academic achieve¬ 
ment of the experimental group. 

b. High school mathematics-science averages and the Iowa 
Physics Aptitude test were found to be the best individual tests of 
the battery for predicting academic achievement in first year engin¬ 
eering. 

c. For this group, a prediction made on the basis of the 
weighted scores of the high school mathematics-science averages and 
the Iowa Physics Aptitude test combined is approximately Z9% better 
than a guess. This was the highest predictive efficiency found for 
the battery. 

d. A prediction of academic achievement in first year 
engineering based on high school averages alone was found to be 
approximately ZS% better than a guess.

2 . IMPLICATIONS 

This study is the first of its kind to be conducted in an atteiipt 
to find the value of predictive tests in forecasting academic achieve¬ 
ment in first year engineering at the University of Alberta, The number 
of cases in the experimental group was small and the procedures used 
were elementary* It has* however, been quite definitely established 
that the Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest Inventory should be deleted 
from the test battery. The findings also indicate that high school 
averages predict achievement in first year engineering as well as do the 
scores on any of the other predictive tests used and better than most 
of them. 

This study has not established whether or not a minimum high school 
average for admission to the Faculty of Engineering would reduce fail¬ 
ures* An inspection of the scatter diagram in the appendix for the 
high school mathematics-science averages and final average scores in 
first year engineering suggests that further study with more cases may 
reveal important implications in this connection. 

Although it is beyond the scoye of this particular study, it might 
be suggested that investigations in the future attempt to use multiple 
correlation techniques to find a weighted composite score for all tests 
of the battery* This would increase the overall predictive efficiency 
of the battery and would simplify measures taken to predict academic 
achievement. 

The findings of this study make it possible to estimate roughly 
academic achievement in first year engineering, given scores from the 
predictive tests. These estimates are useful for guidance purposes, 

but are not sufficiently accurate to reveal clearly which candidates 
will be successful in the freshman year.
