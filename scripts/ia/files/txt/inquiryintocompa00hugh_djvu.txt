This study must acknowledge the great help rendered by 
Prof* H.T. Sparby, Prof* H*C* Melsness and Prof. R.E. Rees* 

Without their understanding advice and painstaking revision the 
study would never have been completed. 

The contribution of Mr. D.J. Forrest, B.Sc., who spent many 
hours in checking the accuracy of the calculations, was invaluable. 

Grateful acknowledgment must go to the ministers of the various 
Departments of Education for their courtesy in providing copies of 
the annual reports of their departments. In addition, special 
mention must be made of the kindness of the Ministers of Education 
of the provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland in providing unpublished 
statistics regarding enrolment and expenditures for education in 
their provinces. 

Finally, a great debt must be acknowledged to Kenneth F. Argue 
whose earlier studies were responsible for suggesting the fields of 
this investigation, and the methods of research which have been used.

SYNOPSIS 


The author’s primary aim in this investigation was to contribute 
to the research which must be done before it can be established 
whether or not a need exists for Dominion aid to education. This 
has been done by measuring the educational "loads” of the Canadian 
provinces and the ability of the provinces to finance adequately 
the educational systems which they must provide. 

It was found that Newfoundland was facing a greater educational 
load by a larger margin than any other province and that the other 
Maritime provinces are carrying a load much heavier than any other 
part of Canada with the possible exception of Saskatchewan, Alberta 
and Quebec have heavy loads in comparison with Ontario, Manitoba 
and British Columbia, though their loads are substantially lighter 
than those of the Maritimes. British Columbia has the lightest load 
of any Canadian province by a significant margin. 

It was further found that the Maritimes have a very low ability 
to finance education as compared to other parts of Canada, Quebec 
and Saskatchewan have substantially less ability than any of the 
other provinces with the exception of the Maritimes, Manitoba has 
a comparatively high ability while Alberta, Ontario and British 
Columbia appear to have a high ability to finance education as comp¬ 
ared to that of the rest of Canada, 

The limited scope of this investigation and the relative nature 
of the figures arrived at, make it impossible to conclude with 
certainty that Dominion aid for education is necessary it Canada. 
However, results of this study do lend a great deal of support to such 
a conclusion. When it can be shown, for example, that a province which

is responsible for educating 5.8% of the children in Canada has 
only 3.6% of the total personal income of Canada, it would seem 
that there should be some additional source of revenue for that 
province*

CHAPTER I 


introduction 

1. GENERAL 

As many areas of Canada face the problem of modernizing and 
extending their educational systems, and as all areas face rapidly 
increasing costs of education, it is becoming ever more frequent to 
hear educational authorities call for Dominion aid to education as 
the only hope of meeting their responsibilities. Many widely known 
organizations, notably the Canadian Teachers* Federation, are carry¬ 
ing on more or less organized campaigns with a view to persuading a 
large body of electors to demand that Dominion aid be provided. No 
study of the scope of this one can hope to determine whether such aid is 
necessary, or how much must be provided if it is necessary. However, 
information regarding the financial abilities of the Canadian provinces 
to support public enterprises such as education, is essential to object¬ 
ive thinking about these questions. For this reason the following study 
has been undertaken. 

Argue aptly states the problems of Canadian educators in the field 

of public support of education when he says: 

...Educationists can, of course, answer (when asked what 
should be done in Canada) ’American authorities have 
recommended this or that technique to meet the American 
counterpart of the Canadian dilemma.* But such answers 
will not entirely suffice. While American experience is 
highly relevant, American counsel invaluable, and American 
research studies basic to an attack on Canada’s problem, 
still Canadians must make their own studies, scrutinize 
their own statistics, and work out their own solutions if 
they are to measure up to the national educational respons¬ 
ibility which is theirs.

This study will scrutinize Canadian statistics with a view to 
clarifying some of the issues involved in the current controversy over 
Dominion aid to education. It is not proposed to debate the legal aspects 
of whether or not the B.N.A. act permits such aid; nor is it proposed to 
solve the problem of how such aid might be administered. Rather it is the 
intention here to inquire into one or two aspects of the whole educational 
finance picture, with the hope that the resultant findings may aid further 
studies and thus contribute to the settling of the controversy. 

It might be well at this point to acknowledge the existence of a 
body of opinion among some members of the general public that there is 
not a direct relationship between the quality of education and the amount 
of money spent upon it. While this may be true of certain classrooms, 
certain schools, or even of certain localities, it is felt that in gen¬ 
eral there is very little validity in this opinion. It is maintained 
here that the level of expenditure of some provinces must be raised if 
Canadian boys and girls are all to have equal educational opportunities. 
Certainly such equal opportunities cannot be said to exist when the per 
pupil expenditure on education in Canada varies from little more than 
fifty dollars to more than two hundred dollars. 

Argue has this to say: 

It is the common assumption of our thinking about value and 
quality, namely, that you generally get just about what you 
pay for; that in education as elsewhere, you get value in 
proportion to price. That there are certain exceptions to 
this assumption can no more be denied than its general soundness* ^ 

Mort states; 

There is undoubtedly a high degree of association between the 
amount of money spent and both the quantity and quality of the 
instructional materials and staff provided. * 2 


1* Ibid. pp. 2-7. 

2. Paul H. Mort, Financing the public schools of Maine , the Maine 
Finance Commission, 1934, p.64. 






(3 


Englehardt and Englehardt sum up the situation as follows: 

Every aspect of education is related to cost, and say what 
one will, support will be gained, increased and retained only 
as the public is willing to see that the product bears a def¬ 
inite relationship to the cost, and that it is being bought 
at market prices. 1 

This study takes the considered opinion of these authors, based on 
research and experience, as its justification for having compared the 
quality of education of the provinces exclusively from the viewpoint of 
financial statistics. It maintains that the ability of the provinces to 
educate their boys and girls adequately is directly proportional to their 
ability to spend adequate sums on education. 


2. RELATED RESEARCH 

Between 1941 and 1945 Argue published the results of three invest¬ 
igations into various aspects of the financing of education in Canada 2 * 

In view of the fact that this study was suggested by Argue f s previous 
work in this field, it would be well to summarize here the conclusions 
of his research: 

1. Education in the Dominion as a whole should receive twice as 
much financial support in 1945 as it was receiving in 1941. 

2. Ability to finance education at adequate levels varied widely 
from province to province, and there was a clear indication of a need 
for Dominion equalization grants to the provinces, 

3. As a means of removing or greatly lessening the inequality in 
Canadian education three administrative and financial adjustments or 
reforms were recommended:

Bureau of Publications, Teachers' College, Columbia University, 1927, p.889.

(a) For the municipality or small district: larger units 
of administration. 

(b) For the provinces: sound equalization schemes supported 
by adequate provincial fluids. 

(c) For Canada as a nation: Dominion equalization aid for 
education.^-* 1 2 * 3 

Many authorities have written on the topic of equalization of 
educational costs. Since the general treatment of the subject as given 
by Mort and Reusser 4 would seem to have included the best features of 
most of the plans, those authors will be used for reference here. They 
sum up their proposals thus: 

The current pattern calls for the setting of a satisfactory 
minimum or foundation programme below which no locality will 
be allowed to go and to which any district would be permitted 
to add. In addition, it calls for the sharing of the support 
of the foundation programme in such a way that the burden 
shall fall upon people in all localities equally according 
to their power to pay taxes. It further demands that the 
burden of the property tax that supports local initiative 
shall not be greater than the burden on other types of taxes. 

In the light of the fact that some states do not have the 
power to provide an adequate minimum programme, there is a 
growing realization of a national interest in the establish¬ 
ment of a national minimum programme and in so sharing the 
cost as to make it available in all states. 5

Mort and Reusser have evolved the following formula for distributing 
state aid to education^: 

State aid for ) (number of ) (unit cost ) (local contribution 

a given school) s (units of ) X (of the ) - (at a uniform rate 

district ) (educational) (foundation) (in accordance with 

(need in the) (programme ) (ability to pay. 

(district ) 

Mort and Reusser have suggested that the unit cost b,e about 
$2,000 per weighted elementary classroom of twenty-nine elementary pupils 2 
This figure was based on costs ten or more years ago, and would be entirely 
inadequate now, as it would not even pay the teacher’s salary in many 
cases. Before the problem of Dominion aid to education can be settled in 
Canada some basic foundation programme of the type recommended by Mort and 
Reusser must be laid down and its cost calculated for each area of the 
Dominion. A study which would result in such data would seem to be a need 
in Canada in the near future. 

The formula given above is simple but there might be value in stating 
it in words. Briefly, the plan is this: 

(a) . Decide what educational expenditure per unit of educational 

need isnecessary in order to maintain the minimum defensible 
standard of education in a state (province). 

(b) Using the unit cost of the foundation programme and the number 
of units of educational need in the district, calculate the 
total cost of providing the foundation programme for that 
district. 

(c) Adopt a standard assessment within the province for all local 
administration units, and a standard tax rate* 


1. Ibid. , p.407 

2. Ibid. , p.407 







(6 


(d) The difference between the total cost of the foundation 


programme and the money raised in the district by the uniform 
rate is the amount which must be provided by the state. 


Extending the principle of equalization to apply to federal partic¬ 


ipation would not seem to necessitate any essential variation of the 
formula on page 5. Basically such a formula would be: 


Federal 

Contribution 


Units of 
educational 
= need in the 
province

- (at a uniform 
(rate in aeeord- 
(ance with 
(ability to pay 


Local 

contribution 
f at a uniform 
rate in accord 
ance with 
ability to pay 


As Mort and Reusser point out: 


The chief differences between the measure of educational 
need for school districts and for states are: 


1. A measure usable in a Federal law can utilize a density 
measure to take care of both the small class and of trans¬ 
portation corrections. 

2. There is considerable justification for the use of 
census data rather than attendance data. 

The measure of ability, however, must be radically different. 
Within the states the local tax system is set by the state. 
The federal government has no such control over state tax 
systems. Therefore, while presumably there is uniformity of 
tax systems among school systems, there is no such uniformity 
among states. To obtain a fair measure of ability of the 
states to support education, it is necessary to use some uni¬ 
form tax plan as a basis of an estimate" 1 . 


3. THE PROBLEM 

In order to provide a conclusive answer to the question of the nec¬ 
essity of Dominion aid to education it would appear that answers would 
first have to be obtained to the following questions: 

1. What is a defensible minimum programme for Canadian schools? 

2. How many units of educational need are there in each province? 


1. Ibid. , p.490 





(7 

3. How much will the minimum programme cost per unit of educ¬ 
ational need? 

4. What is the ability of each province to pay for education? 

5. What discrepancy, if any, exists between the ability of each 
province and its need? (Units of educational need X cost 
per unit of need.) 

This study will limit itself to attempting to find an answer to 
questions M 2" and "4 tt . It is hoped that a contribution may thus be 
made which will be of value in solving the larger problem of dominion 
aid to education. Certainly this problem cannot be solved until the 
educational load of each province and the ability of each province to 
pay taxes for education have been established.

4. PLAN OF PROCEDURE 

It has been found necessary to select the year 1949 and to collect 
data for that year. This has been made necessary by the fact that the 
departments of education of the various provinces do not report at a 
uniform time. The above year is the last for which complete data for 
all the provinces are available. 

This is to be a comparative study. It is hoped to give an accurate 
picture of the educational load and the ability to finance education for 
each province, stated as a comparison with all the other provinces. No 
attempt can be made in this study to make an absolute statement that the 
ability of a certain province is exactly so much* Since British Columbia 
is the province which spends the most on education per unit of educational 
need that province will in all cases be used as the base from which to 
compare the load and ability of each of the others. 

The educational load will be presented, firstly, on the basis of 
actual enrolment; secondly, on the basis of weighted pupils, as defined 
later, and finally on the basis of potential weighted pupils. 

Ability will be investigated from several viewpoints: 

1. Personal income behind each unit of educational need. 

2. Total provincial and municipal revenue behind each unit 
of need. 

3. The comparative share of each province of certain basic 
economic data. (Total Retail Sales, Total Personal Income, Total Net 
Production as a combined total.) 

Finally, the totals of the factors mentioned in "3” above will be 
used to investigate the relationship between the actual taxation in each 
province as compared with the potential taxation if all the provinces

taxed themselves at the rate of British Columbia. This should give an 


indication as to what extent the provinces are undertaxing themselves, 
or overtaxing; but it must be emphasized that this, too, will be a 
comparative measure and not an absolute onp.

5. DEFINITION M) DELIMITATION OF TEEMS. 

1. Education: In this study the term education is used to refer to the 

instruction provided in publicly controlled and publicly supported 
day, elementary and secondary schools. 

2. Elementary Grades : Grades 1 to 8 inclusive. 

3. Secondary Grades : Grades 9 to 12 inclusive. 

4. Educational Need : The educational need of a province refers, in gen¬ 

eral, to the total number of children to be educated in that 
province. Three measures of need are employed in this study: 

(1) the number of pupils enrolled in school; (2) the number of 
"weighted" pupils; and (3) the number of "potential" weighted 
pupils. 

5. Weighted Pupil: This is a unit of educational need which takes into 

account the higher costs of educating secondary school pupils as 
compared with elementary school pupils. The secondary school 
enrolment is multiplied by an appropriate figure and then added 
to the elementary school enrolment to obtain the total number of 
weighted pupils. 

6. Potential Weighted Pupil: This is a unit of educational need which 

takes into account not only the pupils in attendance at school, 
but also those who should be in school. The procedure in deter¬ 
mining the number of potential weighted pupils is explained in 
Part 10 of Chapter 2. 

7. Educational Load: The educational load of a province refers to the 

educational burden which must be carried by each adult in the 
province if the educational needs of that province are to be met. 
One common measure of educational load is the number of children 
per adult in a province. The load may also be expressed in 
terms of the number of adults behind each pupil enrolled. 

8. Total Revenue: For purposes of convenience the term "total revenue" 

is used to refer to the combined provincial and municipal reveme s 
of a province. 

9. Economic - Activity Total: For purposes of convenience this express¬ 

ion has been coined to refer to the total production, retail 
sales, and personal income in a province. 

10. Ability: The ability of a province to support education will be 

expressed in terms of some financial unit, such as total revenue, 
per unit of educational need*

CHAPTER II 

THE EDUCATIONAL LOADS OF THE VARIOUS CANADIAN PROVINCES 
1. EDUCATIONAL NEED AND EDUCATIONAL LOAD 

The term "educational need" is a standard term used extensively 
by Mort and other authorities in their writing about the financing of 
education. Educational need is the name given to the total job to be 
done in a given educational administrative area. Stated simply, the 
educational need of a state or province is the total number of children 
to be educated. 

Argue has introduced the term "educational load"* 1 -* He defines 
load as the number of children to be educated per standard unit of 
population. He uses as his standard unit of population 1,000 adults, 
and bases his comparisons of the need of provinces for financial aid 
on the number of children per 1,000 adults. 

A few words would appear to be needed at this point about the 
relative value of the "need" and "load" concepts. To begin with, load 
cannot be established without first determining need. Secondly, the 
purposes which the two concepts serve are entirely different in that: 

(a) "Need" can be used to calculate the total cost of a found¬ 
ation programme, while "load"cannot. 

(b) "Load" is really a better indicator of relative need for 
help, i.e., "load" is really a kind of measure of ability. This can be 
seen if "load" is considered as an ability indicator in terms of the 
number of adults per child. Thus it may quite readily be compared with

"financial ability" which is also an ability indicator in terms of 
the number of dollars per child. 

In this study, educational need will be established and used as 
the basis for the calculation of educational load. Educational load 
will then be used in developing various comparisons of the ability of 
the provinces to support education. 

2. MEASURES OF EDUCATIONAL NEED 

The adoption of suitable measures of educational need for this 
study has presented a problem of no mean proportion. Mort 1 2 , in 
appraising several measures of need, says that each should be evaluated 
in terms of: 

1. The equitableness with which it takes into account the var¬ 
iation in cost due to the variation in size of school. 

2. The equity with which it treats districts facing the same 
conditions. 

3. The degree with which it takes into account that high school 
education is more expensive than elementary education. 

Mort in another publication has devised a measure of educational 
need based on average daily attendance, which takes into account the 
cost effect of: 

1. The relative number of children attending at the elementary 
school level as opposed to the high school level. 

2. The degree of density or sparsity of population. 

2 

3. The variation of price or cost of living in the various states .

(15 


Mort's measure has the great advantage of using a uniform measurement 

of the educational task facing each state• As Norton and Norton says 

One child does not necessarily mean the same thing in one 
state as it does in another in terms of financing a given 
type of educational opportunity 1 • 

In this study educational need is measured in terms of: 

(a) Number of pupils enrolled. 

(b) Number of weighted pupils. 

(c) Number of potential weighted pupils. 

It is felt that,while straight enrolment figures have been found 
inadequate in themselves as a measure of educational need, there is value 
in comparing the enrolments as a measure of the actual need in terms of 
pupils coming to school in the various provinces. Furthermore,the figiures 
for enrolment are the basis for calculating indices of load which will be 
presented. While the number of children 5-17 years,as given by census 
data,has been used by some writers,such a measure of need has been 
discarded in this study because the use of such data necessitates several 
assumptions.Some of these assumptions ares 

1. That children five years of age should be in school. 

2. That a child's schooling should end at seventeen years. 

5•That at some arbitrarily fixed age within the above limits 
children should be classified as secondary school students.If 
such an assumption is not made, it becomes impossible to 
allow for the increased cost of secondary education when 
calculating educational need.

5. WEIGHTING- FOR THE GREATER COST OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 
The weighted pupil represents an attempt to take into account the 
relatively higher cost of educating a high school pupil as compared with 
that of educating an elementary school pupil.Some years ago Mort found 
that secondary education cost 1.7 times as much per pupil as elementary 
education.^ There is some indication at present that the difference in 
cost is decreasing because of the introduction of the single salary 
schedule and the increase in qualifications of elementary teachers. 

However,no definite evidence of this decrease is as yet available® 
Unfortunately,Ontario is the only province which publishes educational costs 
separately for secondary and elementary sections.For the school year 1948-49, 
the last for which data are available,Ontario’s outlays, after subtracting 
capital expenditures made from current revenue,are as follows}

Thus,Ontario spent 1.75 times as much per pupil on secondary 
education as it did on elementary education in 1948-49.In view of this fact, 


1. Mort, op.cit . 

2. Department of Education, Annua l Report, Province of Ontario ,1951 






















(15 

decided to use the 1.7ratio for the purposes of this study. Accordingly, 
throughout this section, the data as reported for secondary school 
enrolment, has in each case been multiplied by 1.7. The result may be 
said to represent the high school pupils as weighted pupils. 'When the 
total of weighted pupils has been added to the enrolment figures for 
elementary schools, the total educational need for each province in 
terms of elementary pupils or their equivalent will have been established. 

4. JUSTIFICATION OF THE USE OF ENROLMENT DATA 

The adoption by this study of enrolment data rather than that of 
average daily attendance may be questioned. This course is defended 
on the following grounds: 

1. Average daily attendance is greatly affected by inclement 
weather conditions, bad road conditions, sickness. These 
are likely to vary widely from province to province, 
particularly road conditions. 

2. Teaching staff and classroom space as well as many other 
items of educational expense must take into account enrol¬ 
ment rather than average daily attendance. 

3. The only really significant part of the difference between 
enrolment and average daily attendance is represented by 
"drop-outs". 

4. It is to be presumed that a progressive philosophy of educ¬ 
ation has reached at least the top levels of educational 
administration in all of the Canadian provinces; and that, 
therefore, all provinces to a varying but large degree realize 
their obligations to provide more years of schooling per pupil 
and to reach all sections of their educable youth.

For the above reasons and in the face of disagreement by some 
authorities, this study will be confined to enrolment data in con¬ 
sidering educational need, 

5. URBAN-RURAL POPULATION RATIO 

It is not considered practical to attempt a weighting to offset 
differing urban-rural population ratios. Up-to-date statistics necessary 
for such a weighting are not at present available. The great shifts in 
population which have evidently taken place since the last Dominion-wide 
census would seem to make the use of 1941 census data for this purpose 
open to question. Nor is such a weighting considered of as great signif¬ 
icance for this investigation as it is in American studies whose purpose 
was to establish forraulae for equalization programmes within individual 
states. Nevertheless, it will be found that the calculations which result 
in the potential weighted pupil as a unit of educational need will have 
indirectly made some allowance for this factor. 

6. ESTABLISHMENT OF DATA FOR THE TOTAL NUMBER 
OF ADULTS IN EACH PROVINCE 

The establishment of a reasonably accurate figure for the total 
number of adults for each province posed a problem of no mean pro¬ 
portion. After much consideration it was decided to establish the 
number of adults by simply subtracting from the census estimates for 
the total population of each province the number of people in the age 
groups 0 - 19 in each province. The data were secured from the Dominion 
Bureau of Statistics 1 publication, "Census and Estimated Populations of 
Canada and the Provinces by Age and Sex Group, 1949”.

This'procedure requires only one assumption, namely that boys aid 
girls should stay in school until they are nineteen. Since the normal 
age for finishing high school is usually accepted as being eighteen, and 
since the population in the age group 0-19 contains only those who 
are not yet 19§, and since the addition of Grade XIII in some provirces 
and the custom of taking Grade XII in two years in others has extended 
the high school leaving age by at least a year, it would seem that this 
age group could be said to represent those who are not yet adults. 

This is further strengthened by the fact that educationists generally are 
advocating secondary education for all boys and girls. Hence this age 
group may be said to represent those who should be in school in each 
province plus the pre-school age children#

7. MEASURES OE EDUCATIONAL LOAD 

Since the entire adult population of a province is the real 
source of the tax monies which support education, the use of the 
number of adults behind each child enrolled would seem to be a good 
practice in measuring educational load. True, businesses pay taxes too, 
and governments contribute, but it is not hard to see that in the final 
analysis all taxation has its source in the adult population, who either 
directly or indirectly pay the taxes. 

.Argue measures educational load in terms of: 

1. Number of children 5-17 years per 1,000 adults. 

2. Birthrate per 1,000 population. 

3. Number of children enrolled per 1,000 adults. 

4. Number of children per 1,000 adults. 

5. Percentage rural population to urban population*^*. 

.This study has adopted the following measures of educational load: 

1. Number of adults per pupil enrolled. 

2. Number of adults per weighted pupil. 

3. Number of adults per potential weighted pupil. 

.....It is felt that "educational load" in itself is a valuable indicator 
of the relative needs of the provinces for Dominion assistance. If invest¬ 
igation reveals, for example, that Province "A" has 2 adults tos\g>port 
each child to be educated, while Province ”B" has 4 adults to do the same 
job, it is obvious that the adults in Province "A" are facing a task just 
twice as great in providing adequate education for its children. Of 
course, other factors must be taken into account before this need for 
assistance can be accurately compared. For example, the income of the 
1. Kenneth F. Argue, op. cit. , pp.2-7.

. 







' 







i J 








(20 


adults in Province "A" may be substantially greater than that of the 
adults in Province "B". In other words, financial statistics must be 
combined with the data for educational load before a really good 
determination of the need for assistance can be made. However, it 
is maintained that, lacking any financial statistics, educational load 
in itself is a useful indicator of the relative needs of the provinces 
for Dominion assistance. 

Possibly sane justification is needed for the use of the "number 
of adults behind each child" as a unit of load, rather than "number of 
children per adult". While it is admitted that a comparison is easier 
to make when the latter unit is used, the necessity which exists for 
combining measures of educational load with financial data in order to 
arrive at satisfactory measures of financial ability makes the former 
unit more useful. It will not be too hard to interpret the comparisons 
made with the unit "number of adults behind each child" if it is remem¬ 
bered that an inverse relationship exists between the number of adults 
behind each child and the educational load. This is clearly shown by 
means of indices of load which have been presented. 

Table III shows the number of adults behind each child enrolled.

8. EDUCATIONAL LOAD EXPRESSED IN TERMS 
OF THE NUMBER OF ADULTS BEHIND EACH CHILD ENROLLED 

According to the indices of load established by Table IV 
it is clear that the Province of Newfoundland has the greatest educ¬ 
ational load with Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and 
Saskatchewan being next in that order. Alberta and Quebec have loads 
only slightly lighter. Ontario and Manitoba might be said to have 
comparatively light loads while British Columbia is shown as having by 
far the lightest educational load of any of the Canadian provinces. 

It should be mentioned here that the fact that British Columbia 
is shown in this comparative index as having the lightest load 
does not in itself indicate that this load is necessarily light. It 
might be so hegvy as to be nearly unbearable. Nor does Newfoundland's 
position as the province bearing the heaviest educational load positively 
indicate that the province's load is too heavy. That can only be deter¬ 
mined by an inquiry into the abilities of the provinces to support educ¬ 
ation. Such an inquiry will constitute a later section of this study. 

The indices established are only one indication of comparative 
educational load, and are based exclusively on enrolment figures without 
any attempt having been made to take into account the relatively higher 
cost of secondary education. The method to be used for weighting for 
this factor has been explained earlier in this section. The next few 
tables will establish a further set of indices of educational load tfiich 
takes into account this higher cost of secondary education#

9. EDUCATIONAL LOAD AS ESTABLISHED 
BY USE OF THE WEIGHTED PUPIL 


(25 


While the indices of load as given in Table VI do not cease any 
great change in the relative positions of the various provinces as given 
in Table IV, it is significant that, in weighting for the greater cost of 
secondary education, the calculations have tended to reduce the spread 
between the highest and lowest index of load and to make a)me changes in 
the relative positions of the provinces. Newfoundland is still shown as 
having the greatest educational load by a good margin with Nova Scotia 
and Prince Edward Island and Alberta in the Very High Load classification. 
Saskatchewan’s drop to a position slightly below that of Alberta is worthy 
of note. Both of these provinces now are shown with a comparatively high 
load. Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec are shown with fairly light loads with 
British Columbia again having the lightest load. The considerable dec¬ 
rease in the indices as compared to that of British Columbia is mainly 
to be attributed to the fact that the latter province has the greatest 
proportion of its total enrolment represented by secondary school pupils. 
This is shown in Table V, Column 5. 

A study of Table V, Column 5, is likely to cause doubt that even 
the weighting for secondary school costs has given a true indication of 
the comparative loads of the provinces. When the total enrolment rep¬ 
resented by secondary school pupils varies within the country from less 
than 8$ in Quebec to more than 25$jn British Columbia, some further 
consideration of the problem would seem to be indicated.

10* THEORY OF THE POTENTIAL WEIGHTED PUPIL 

Accordingly, the results of a further study are given* This further 
study undertakes additional weighting with respect to secondary education. 
It assumes that whatever the reason for the varying secondary-elementary 
enrolment ratio, the present progressive philosophy of education would 
suggest the desirability of as many students as possible receiving some 
secondary education. It further assumes that it would not be unreasonable 
to assert that the secondary-elementary enrolment ratio for British 
Columbia would not be considered too high to set as the aim of the rest 
of Canada. Therefore, the number of potential secondary school pupils 
which each province would have were its secondary-elementary enrolment 
ratio equal to that of British Columbia, is shown. The latter province 
shows that its secondary school enrolment represents 26% of its elem¬ 
entary enrolment. This figure has been applied to the elementary enrolment 
of each of the other provinces. The resulting figures have been multiplied 
as before by 1.7 to adjust for the greater cost of secondary education. 
Finally, a new set of indices of load have been calculated with these new 
data. Table VII shows the results of these further calculations. 

In view of the widespread agreement among laymen and educators about 
the desirability of more education for everyone who is capable of profit¬ 
ing by it, it is felt that this further study is essential. TUr thermo re, 
part of the explanation of the varying secondary-elementary enrolment 
ratios, a large and important part, no doubt lies in the varying relations 
of urban to rural population in the various provinces. This last set of 
indices, therefore, may well make an important adjustment for this factor 
which has, up to this point, been neglected for reasons explained earlier.

11. EDUCATIONAL LOAD AS ESTABLISHED BY USE OF THE 
POTENTIAL WEIGHTED PUPIL 

It is felt that of the measures of educational load given, that 
in Table VI is the least reliable even though it does take into account 
the greater cost of educating a secondary school pupil. It is less rel¬ 
iable because it weights the indices in favour of those provinces which 
are providing the most secondary education at present. In other words, 
the element of performance enters to such an extent as to cast doubt on 
its reliability as an accurate measure of load. The first measure, as 
given in Table IV, is incomplete in that it takes no account of the 
greater cost of secondary education. The measure, as given in Table VIII, 
on the other hand, takes this last factor into account and, in addition, 
goes a long way toward eliminating the factor of performance by admitting 
that most provinces have a potentially greater secondary school load than 
their actual secondary school enrolments would seem to indicate. Too, as 
was pointed out before, the methods used in calculating this set of in¬ 
dices tend to make some adjustment for varying urban-rural population 
ratios, a factor which authorities hold to be important. For the above 
reasons this study will consider that the measures of educational load 
based on the potential weighted pupil are the ones most likely to give a 
clear picture of the situation across Canada. 

The question will probably arise as to what extent account should 
be taken of students who are obtaining their secondary education in 
private schools. This study takes the position that it is the constit¬ 
utional responsibility of each province to provide education for its 
boys and girls, and that the educational need of a given province must

other words, the fact that one or more provinces may have substantial

numbers of pupils in private schools can have no significance in 
calculating the total educational need of those provinces* 

12. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS OF THIS SECTION 

1* Newfoundland is facing an educational load' very much greater 
than that of any other province. 

2. The other Maritime provinces are carrying a load much heavier 
than those of other parts of Canada except, possibly, Saskatchewan. 

3. The educational loads of Alberta and Quebec appear to be 
classifiable as heavy in comparison to those of Ontario, Manitoba 
and British Columbia. 

4. Ontario and Manitoba, while they are carrying educational 
loads significantly higher than that of British Columbia, have loads 
of very moderate proportions as compared to those of the provinces 
mentioned in 1, 2 and 3. 

5. British Columbia has the lightest educational load in Canada 
by a significant margin. 

In conclusion, it would seem advisable to reiterate the statement 
made near the beginning of this section that it has not been established 
that any province has in reality a light load nor that any province has 
a load which is too heavy to bear. It has been established, however, 
that the loads of some of the provinces are double or, in some instances 
more than double, the loads of other provinces. It remains for the 
section on ability to attempt to determine what the rektionship is in 
each province between the actual educational need and the financial 
ability to meet this need*

CHAPTER III 

THE ABILITY OF THE CANADIAN PROVINCES 
TO FINANCE EDUCATION 

1. MEASURES OF ABILITY TO FINANCE EDUCATION 

Burke 1 2 3 discusses the problem of devising a reliable measure of 

ability to finance education and gives the opinions of a number of the 

more recent writers on the subject. Since Burke's book is very new and 

presumably up-to-date and since he states that its publication was 

strongly encouraged by Mort, a review of his findings together with the 

references given by him would seem to be of value at this stage. Burke 

suggests that for larger units of government it is possible to construct 

2 

an index of tax-paying ability from basic economic statistics. Cornel 
developed a formula based on total population, motor vehicle registrations, 
production, number of residence telephones, savings deposits and postal 
receipts. Bacon^ developed techniques for measuring fiscal capacity of 
counties in terms of incomes. Burke points out that a clear-cut defin¬ 
ition of tax-paying ability is not easy to make. Limitations of data, 
weighting of factors and keeping the index up-to-date, he says, 
present great but not unsurmount able technical difficulties. He mentions 
the Alabama index which is based on the percent of the total state sales 
tax paid, passenger automobile licences paid, state personal income tax 
paid, assessed valuation of public utilities, farm income, and value 
added by manufacture, all weighted according to a prescribed form.

Other states have adopted similar methods. Mort 1 originally took the 
stand that, provided different areas had assessments made on an equal¬ 
ized basis, relative ability to finance education could be measured by 
the relation between their property assessments. However, Mort has 
since compiled an index in which are included value added to raw pro¬ 
ducts by manufacture, farm cash income, postal receipts, retail trade, 
net income from #5,000 - 25,000, net incomes over #25,000, urban popul¬ 
ation, motor vehicle registration and total population 2 * Norton and 
Norton 3 suggest a similar list. Argue uses the following measures: 

1. National wealth per census child, 5-17 years. 

2. National wealth per child enrolled. 

3. Share of national income behind each child of school age. 

4. Share of national income behind each child enrolled. 

5. Taxable income per child enrolled. 

6. Taxable income behind each child of school age. 

7. Amount of net national production behind each child of school 
age and behind each child enrolled. 

8. Total provincial and municipal revenue behind each child 
enrolled and behind each child of school age 4 . 

While previous studies have pointed the way, it is hoped to 
devise a somewhat different approach from any suggested by the experts. 
There are good reasons for this. Firstly, most of the American studies

Publications, Teachers* College, Columbia University, 1926, pp.16-20.

have as their objective the equalization of the educational burden 
within states and, thus, were meant to devise some method of estimat¬ 
ing taxpaying ability of local educational areas. Secondly, the problem 
of weighting the various factors used in the .American studies is, in 
itself, an undertaking of a large scope. This study will adopt some of 
the measures advocated by Argue and mentioned on the previous page* 
However, it is judged unnecessary to carry out all the comparative 
measures he used. Some have been adopted when they add to the picture 
of comparative ability which is being built* 

Since measures of ability of the Canadian provinces to pay for 
education are necessarily comparative and since ability to pay for 
education cannot really be separated from taxpaying ability in general, 
this study proposes to go beyond Argue*s techniques in an attempt to 
obtain comparative measures which will provide a basis for more 
objective decisions* A few types of basic economic data will be used 
in an attempt to judge the total taxpaying ability of the provinces.

2. ABILITY AS REVEALED BY PERSONAL INCOME 
BEHIND EACH POTENTIAL WEIGHTED PUPIL 


(36 


It will be noted that two measures of educational need have been 
discarded, as far as the calculations in this section are concerned. 

For reasons which have already been given it is felt that the potential 
weighted pupil represents the most accurate measure of educational need. 
Accordingly, this measure will hereafter be used exclusively when a 
measure of need is required. 

According to Table X, the Maritimes would appear to have very low 
ability ih comparison with other parts of Canada. Quebec and Saskat¬ 
chewan, while they show ability considerably greater than that of the 
Maritimes, seem to be in a class which might be called medium low. Alberta 
and Ontario are comparatively high in ability while British Columbia has 
the highest ability of any of the Canadian provinces. 

3. ASSUMPTION REGARDING QUEBEC'S MUNICIPAL REVENUE 

The next section of this investigation into ability will inquire 
into the field of provincial and municipal revenue as an indication 
of the extent to which the provinces are capable of supporting education. 

It will be noted that data for the municipal revenue of Quebec have 
been given in Table XI although that province does not report its 
municipal revenue. In order that some indication might emerge as to 
Quebec's ability it was thought advisable to assume that it would not 
be unreasonable to fix that province’s municipal revenue at a figure 
equal to its provincial revenue. The fact that the two sums are 
nearly equal in the case of Ontario influenced the decision to make

(37 


this assumption. Certainly Quebec T s municipal revenue could not be 
said to be more than its provincial revenue in the light of the rel¬ 
ationship which exists between the two in the other provinces. If 
anything, this treatment will over-estimate rather than under-estimate 
Quebec f s ability*

4. TOTAL PROVINCIAL AND MUNICIPAL REVENUE 
AS A MEASURE OF ABILITY 


(40 


Tables XI and XII investigate the ability of the provinces to 
support education as shown by the total of their combined provincial 
and municipal revenue. Since education is paid for from these funds, 
it is relevant to inspect the public funds when seeking an indication 
of the ability of the provinces to pay for education. 

Table XI gives the data regarding provincial and municipal revenue. 
It will be noted that municipal revenue is not given for Newfoundland. 
Newfoundland was so newly a province in 1949 that the gathering of 
statistics there had not progressed to the extent that it had in other 
provinces. 

Table XII gives an index of ability for each province based on 
the amount of provincial and municipal revenue received by each prov¬ 
ince. On the basis of this criterion the previous conclusion about 
the low ability of the Maritimes seems to be Confirmed. These 
provinces on the average have only about one-third of the ability of 
British Columbia. Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan are grouped in 
what might be called the medium ability bracket. The low position of 
Ontario here is thought-provoking. It certainly indicates that the 
ability of this province, at least, should be investigated.further. It 
suggests that it would be most advisable to enquire into the taxation 
structures of the provinces in order to obtain an index based on the 
amount of revenue which each province might have if it taxed itself up 
to the level of its ability. This index is based only on the actual 
revenue obtained by the taxation level and methods in use at present.

Alberta appears to have about the same ability on this index as on 
the last one. It is necessary to exercise care in thinking about 
Alberta's revenues which even in 1949 were very much swollen by fees 
arising from the development of the oil industry. It is open to question 
whether all of this revenue should be considered as ordinary revenue since 
it represents the realization of cash from an exhaustible resource. How¬ 
ever, these revemes had not risen by 1949 to their present huge size. 
Perhaps this fact will make the calculations regarding Alberta more accur¬ 
ate than they would be if they were based on revenues for a later year.

5, PRESENT EXPENDITURE PER PROVINCE ON EDUCATION 
COMPARED WITH EXPENDITURE NECESSARY TO 
REACH BRITISH COIBMBIA'S EXPENDITURES PER PUPIL ENROLLED 

Table XIII gives the amount now being spent on education by each 

oi the provinces and the expenditure per enrolled pupil which these 

amounts represent. The low per pupil expenditures of the Maritime 

provinces and of Newfoundland would seem to reflect the low ability 

to pay which previous investigations have indicated. It is interest- 

ing to note that the per pupil expenditure of the Maritimes on the 

average is little more than one-third that of British Columbia and not 

a great deal more than one-half that of Alberta. 

Table XXV shows the expenditure which each province would have to 
make on education to equal the ,$203 per enrolled pupil now being devoted 
to this purpose by British Columbia. A ccmparison of the amounts now 
being spent, as given in Table XIII with the amounts needed as shown in 
Table XIV, will bring to light a number of interesting facts. The Mari¬ 
times generally would obviously have to increase their expenditures by 
100-200 percent. Quebec would have almost to double its present expend¬ 
iture while Ontario would have to make a 75 percent increase. The 
prairie provinces would have to make corresponding substantial increases. 

Perhaps it should be stated here that it is not being advocated that 
all provinces must spend at the rate being maintained by British Columbia 
in order to attain a desirable standard of education. However, it is 
suggested that some equalization needs to be carried out when the expend¬ 
iture per pupil enrolled varies within a country as greatly as it does 
in Canada. It is the purpose of this section to discover to what extent 
this equalization can be carried out by the unaided efforts of the var¬ 
ious provinces, and to what extent they are incapable of carrying it out.

6. POSSIBILITY OF THE OTHER PROVINCES REACHING B.C. *S EXPENDITURE 

PER ENROLLED PUPIL 

BY DEVOTING MORE OF THEIR TOTAL REVENUE TO EDUCATION 

Tables XV and XVI seek to further this investigation into the 
ability of the provinces to finance education by discovering to what 
extent the financing of education would use provincial and municipal 
funds if each province were to spend per enrolled pupil that sum now 
being spent by British Columbia. Table XV indicates that the Maritime 
provinces would have to devote to education one-half or more of their 
total revenues as opposed to the one-sixth to one-quarter which they 
are at present using for this purpose. It could probably be argued with 
justice that no province could devote such a large share of its total 
revenues to education. Ontario, Manitoba end Saskatchewan would ach¬ 
ieve the same result by devoting one-third of their revenues to educ¬ 
ation. This is probably more than a province could be expected to do. 
They are devoting approximately one-fifth of their revenues to this 
purpose now. Alberta would have to use about a quarter of its reven¬ 
ues as opposed to about one-sixth at present. It is worth noting that 
there is no significant difference between the fraction being used for 
education by Ontario and British Columbia. Yet this fraction results in 
a per pupil expenditure more than 40% greater in the latter province. 
This fact would seem to strengthen the evidence in favour of invest¬ 
igating the taxation structures of the provinces. 

Table XVI shows the percent of total personal income now being 
devoted to education and the percent which would have to be used for 
this purpose were all provinces to increase their expenditure per 
pupil enrolled to that now being maintained by British Columbia. It

(48 


is interesting mainly in that it reveals that the percentage would have 
to he decidedly higher in the Maritimes than it would be anywhere else. 

It, thus, further proves the comparatively low ability of that section 
of the country. 

7. THE NEED FOR A FURTHER MEASURE OF ABILITY 
TO FINANCE EDUCATION BASED ON 
TOTAL TAXPAYING ABILITY 

It has become increasingly clear as this investigation has pro¬ 
ceeded that a reliable measure of the ability of the provinces to supp¬ 
ort education cannot be separated from a measure of their ability to 
pay taxes in general. It is unlikely that any province would increase 
its taxation as sharply as some would have to,to reach British Columbia's 
standard of expenditure and then devote the whole proceeds of such an 
increase to education. Therefore, it would seem logical to devise some 
measure of total taxpaying ability and proceed from that to a measure of 
ability to pay for education. In an attempt to devise an equitable means 
of measuring total taxpaying ability, it has been decided to take the data 
for three basic economic activities: net production, total retail sales, 
and total personal income, and to combine these into what will here¬ 
after be called an economic activity total. This total cannot have any 
objective meaning as a total and is not intended to have such a meaning. 
These basic economic data do have one thing in common: each is an in¬ 
dication of what is happening in the financial life of the province con¬ 
cerned. Net production is an indication of the wealth which is being 
produced within a province; total retail sales indicate how much money 
people in a province have to use; total personal income is a concrete 
indication of the amount of money all of the people of a province have

received during a given year. It has been decided to use composite totals 
obtained by adding these three factors in the hope that such a multiple 
use of data, each of which is a good indication in itself of financial 
standing, may smooth out many of the inequalities which might show up 
when one factor is used to the exclusion of the others*

8. ABILITY AS ESTABLISHED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY TOTAL 

The conclusions to be drawn from the data presented in Tables 
XVII - XIX are based on the assumption that the other provinces would 
not be unduly burdening themselves if they were to increase their rate 
of taxation until their total revenue bore the same relationship to 
their economic activity total as does that of British Columbia. It is 
aumitted that the poorer provinces might find this difficult but at 
least the assumption will provide a working basis for judging to what 
extent, if any, the various provinces are under-taxing themselves. 

Table XVIII shows that British Columbia's total provincial and 
municipal revenue is 5.7 fo of its economic activity total. Table XIX 
shows what this revenue would be for each of the other provinces if 
they taxed themselves at such a rate that their revenues were 5.7% 
of their economic activity totals. It also shows the added revenues 
which would result. An interesting outcome of these calculations is 
shown in the case of Alberta. On the basis of this criterion, Alberta 
is already over-taxing itself by more than fourteen million dollars 
annually. There is very little doubt that this seeming over-taxation 
can be attributed to the suras added to total revenue by the oil boom. 
Prince Edward Island would apparently be able to increase its total 
revenue by more than a million dollars while Ontario could find the 
huge sum of 241 millions. All the other provinces would seem to be 
able to add substantial amounts to their revenues.

9, POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL REVENUE FOR EDUCATION 

It would be absurd to suggest that these additional revenues which 
Table XIX suggests might be raised should all go to the support of educ¬ 
ation. Desirable as that might be, it is certain that all the other 
needs of the government departments would claim a share. The best that 
might be hoped for is that each would continue to contribute to education 
a percentage of its total provincial and municipal revenues not less 
than it is now contributing. 

Since British Columbia has been used as a standard thus far it 
is considered advisable to continue this practice throughout. Accord¬ 
ingly, it is being assumed that the percentage of total revenue being 
devoted to education by that province would be a reasonable percentage 
for the other provinces to contribute if they were to tax themselves as 
heavily as British Columbia is doing. This course has the added advant¬ 
age that, since British Columbia's percentage is now one of the lower 
ones, it is less likely that the ability of any province will be over¬ 
estimated. 

Table XX shows the amounts which would be realized in this event. 

This table reveals that all the provinces would realize substantially 

increased educational funds under the conditions under which the table 

was calculated* with the exception of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Alberta. 

Table XXI gives the amount of money which each province would have 
to spend on education in order to attain British Columbia's expend¬ 
itures per potential weighted pupil. The figure of #177 per potential 
weighted pupil was obtained by dividing British Columbia's actual 
expenditure by the number of such pupils in that province.

10* INADEQUACY OF THE POSSIBLE 
ADDITIONAL REVENUE EUR EDUCATION 

A comparison of the amounts which would be made available for 
education as given in Table XX, Column 2, with those which would be 
necessary in order to enable the other provinces to educate the pup¬ 
ils who should be in school at the rate being maintained by British 
Columbia as given in Table XXI, Column 2, is now necessary. Prince 
Edward Island would still be faced with a deficit of more than two 
and one-half millions. Nova Scotia T s deficit would be more than 
seventeen millions. New Brunswick would be short fifteen millions. 
Quebec would need another sixty-three millions and even Ontario would 
be several millions short. In fact, Alberta is the only province 
which would come close to realizing the amount needed. 

At first sight this would seem to be a very serious situation, 
indeed. Caution must be observed, however, in interpreting the 
results of these calculations. To begin with, there is no proof that 
British Columbian ratio of educational expenditure to total revenue 
(18.5$), which has been used to calculate the amount of funds needed, 
is the right ratio. Perhaps twenty percent, or even twenty-five per¬ 
cent, would be a reasonable rate. Most provinces are devoting more 
than eighteen and one-half percent of total revenue to education at 
present. It is obvious that exhaustive research would have to be 
conducted into the whole basis of provincial and municipal financing 
in order to determine what the percentage should be. Secondly, it 
might be argued that it is unreasonable to expect all of the provinces 
to attain the standard of educational expenditure which the province

(58 


spending the most finds itself capable of maintaining, or even that 
other provinces might get the same value for less money. It is admitted 
that there might be justice in this position. Accordingly, a further 
calculation was undertaken. 

It would be a tenable position, it is believed, to assert that 
while it may be unreasonable for each province to be expected to spend 
per pupil on education what the highest province is spending, the lowest 
province should not be spending less than three-quarters as much per 
unit of educational need. Table XXI shows the sum which each province 
would have to spend on education if it were to spend at three-quarters 
of British Columbia’s rate per potential weighted pupil ($177 x 3/4 * $133). 
It will be seen from these calculations that the Maritimes would face 
a substantial though reduced deficit, as would Quebec. Ontario would 
seem to be able to carry this expenditure and have a surplus. The 
prairie provinces with the exception of Saskatchewan appear able to 
finance these amounts, with Alberta having a substantial surplus. 

One more table will complete this section on the ability of the 
provinces to support education. Table XXIII will seek to compare each 
province’s share of Canada’s (1) total net production; (2) total per¬ 
sonal income; and (3) economic-activity total, with each province’s 
share of Canada’s total educational needs.

11. NEED FOR DOMINION AID TO EDUCATION AS SHOWN BY 
EACH PROVINCE’S SHARE OF THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF CANADA 
COMPARED WITH ITS SHARE OF CANADA’S ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES TOTAL 

The data presented in Table XXII are considered to be of very great 
importance in the development of this study. Every other index of 
ability which has been presented has been exclusively comparative. That 
means that no positive statement can be made as to the actual ability of 
the provinces to support education, at least on the basis of previous cal¬ 
culations. It is held that Table XXII does give an indication of ability 
which is not entirely comparative. For example, when it is found that 
Newfoundland, with less than one percent of the country’s net production 
has to meet three and one-quarter percent of the country’s educational 
needs, it should be a supportable position to insist that the ability of 
that province is much below the educational job which it has to do. It. 
follows from this statement that there is a need for aid from somewhere, 
if the boys and girls in Newfoundland are to be educated as they should 
be. It is hard to imagine such aid coming from a source other than the 
Dominion government; hence, it would seem that some evidence of a need 
for Dominion aid to education has been established by Table XXII. This 
table is particularly valuable in that it has given, for the first time 
in this study, a partial measure of Newfoundland’s ability to finance 
education. 

A glance at the rest of Table XXII will reveal that the situation 
already discussed with reference to Newfoundland is substantially the 
same in the other Maritime provinces. Quebec would appear to oe in a 
reasonably equitable position. Ontario’s share of Canada’s economic 
activity total is substantially greater than its share of Canada’s 




(61 

educational needs. Saskatchewan, on the other hand, enjoys a smaller 
fraction of the economic activity total than its fraction of Canada's 
educational need. Alberta seems to have the ability to carry its 
educational load while British Columbia shows considerably greater 
ability than its need would seem to indicate was necessary* 

12, A SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS OF THIS SECTION 

1. The Maritime provinces seem to have a very low ability to 
finance education when compared to that of other sections of this 
nation.. 

2. The ability of Quebec and Saskatchewan appear to be 
substantially lower than that of any other provinces except the 
Maritime s. 

3. Manitoba would seem to have fairly high ability in compar¬ 
ison with the provinces mentioned in 1, 2 and 3. 

4* British Columbia, Ontario and Alberta have the highest 
ability in Canada by a wide margin. 

5. Manitoba, Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia could be 
said to be capable of carrying their present educational loads if the 
data in Table XXII is a fair indication, as it is believed to be. 

6. Strong evidence of the need for Dominion aid to education 
would seem to have emerged from the data in Table XXII though this 
one table is hardly sufficient to substantiate such need. There 
would appear to be very little doubt, however, that the Maritimes 
are badly in need of sane outside aid if they are to carry their 
share of the country's educational need*

CHAPTER 17 

CONCLUSION 

1. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS OF THIS INVESTIGATION 
At the beginning of this report it was stated that its 
purpose was to contribute to the general research which must be 
done before a final decision can be made as to the necessity for 
Dominion aid to education. This wa3 to be accomplished by inquir¬ 
ing into the educational load being carried by each Canadian prov¬ 
ince and by assessing in a comparative way the abilities of the 
provinces to carry the educational responsibilities which they face. 

It is felt that this objective has been accomplished and that it 
would be in.order at this point to summarize the results of the 
investigation.lt would appear that the following conclusions are 
justified* 

1. Newfoundland’s educational load is much greater than that 
of any other province,The other Maritime provinces have substant¬ 
ially greater loads than those of the rest of Canada with the possible 
exception of Saskatchewan. Thus,it would seem that the four most 
easterly provinces as a group are faced with the greatest task of any 
part of the country in adequately providing for the education of 
their boys and girls® 

2®Saskatchewan has,comparatively speaking, a very heavy load 
and can be placed next to the Maritimes in this respect. 

^©Alberta and Quebec,while their loads are significantly less 
than those of the Maritimes,must be classed as having heavy loads in 
comparison with British Columbia and Ontario as well as Manitoba.

(63 


4. Ontario and Manitoba are carrying loads of very reasonable 
proportions as compared to the provinces already mentioned, while 
British Columbia has by far the lightest educational load of any 

of the Canadian provinces, 

5. The Maritime provinces seem to have a very low comparative 
ability to pay for education. The ability of Quebec and Saskatchewan, 
while higher than the Maritimes, is substantially lower than that of 
any other part of Canada. 

6. Manitoba apparently has a fairly high level of ability as 
compared to the provinces mentioned in (5) above. 

7. British Columbia, Ontario and Alberta would seem to have 
the highest level of ability of the Canadian provinces with their 
abilities probably being ranked in the order given, with British 
Columbia highest. 

8. British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Manitoba might be 
said to be capable of meeting their present needs. This must be 
qualified by saying that it is true only if British Columbia which 
has been used as the yardstick, is not facing too great a load nor 
taxing itself at too high a rate. 

9. Strong evidence of the need for Dominion aid to education, 
particularly in the Maritimes, would seem to be indicated by 

Table XXII though such a need cannot be said to be positively estab¬ 
lished by the findings of one aspect of an investigation. There would 
appear, however, to be very little doubt that the Maritimes, at least, 
must have some outside aid if they are to Jeep up to the standards of 
the other provinces in the matter of the support of education.

2. SUGGESTED FIELDS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH 

Finally, it would seem to be in order to list a few topics 
requiring more research which would have to be investigated before the 
need for Dominion aid to education could be established or denied. 

1. It is essential that the nature of a basic minimum programme 
of education for the country as a whole be established and that the 
cost of such a programme be calculated. 

2. Research is needed to establish what weighting should be 
given to varying urban-rural population ratios in the different 
Canadian provinces in order that educational needs may be more accur¬ 
ately assessed. 

3. Some method must be devised to reduce the assessments of 
property in the various provinces to a common level in order that 
this source of taxation might be more accurately compared. 

4. Some method is needed to assess the effect, if any, on the 
financial needs of the educational units in the different provinces, 
of regional variations in cost of living. This might be tied to a 
larger investigation into the adjustments necessary in the amounts 
of money needed for education for each point of increase or decrease 
in the cost of living index. 

Undoubtedly, there are many other topics which would be valid 
subjects for research. These are presented as a few, the need of 
which has become evident during the course of this investigation.
