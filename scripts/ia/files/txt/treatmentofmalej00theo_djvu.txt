ABSTRACT 


The purpose of this study was to trace the develop¬ 
ment and evaluate the methods that are being used at the 
present time for treating juvenile delinquents in Great 
Britain, the United States, and Canada* The methods 
used in Alberta were considered at some length and an 
attempt was made to evaluate them. 

The treatment of the juvenile delinquent is closely 
related to the principle of reformation in criminology, 
which is a comparatively recent concept* The growth of 
this concept, which has superseded the ideas of revenge 
and retribution, has been reflected in the methods devel¬ 
oped for the purpose of rehabilitating delinquent youth. 

The methods used today for treating delinquents claim 
varying degrees of success. Many of them are proving to 
be out of date and must be improved if they are going to 
achieve their original objective. Recent progressive dev¬ 
elopments and improvements in the treatment of delinquent 
children are proving to be highly successful. This study 
indicates that many of the methods used in Alberta fall 
below the standards of similar methods in other areas. 
Suggestions have been made as to the ways in which the 
delinquency treatment facilities of the province could be 
improved.

HISTORY 

In primitive society tne problem of tiie delinquent 

child did not assume serious proportions. The peculiar 

filial relationship which was centered around a patriarch, 

the overruling authority in all matters of behavior and 

conduct, was in itself an insurance against the frequent 

occurrence of delinquent acts. Primitive man roved about 

in small family groups which consisted of an authoritarian 

father, one or more submissive mates, and their children. 

In such a family group the father was honored, feared, and 

obeyed without question. The problem 01 the delinquent 

child would arise when a member of the family group would 

disobey the father and would rebel or attempt to usurp 

1 

the father’s powerful authority and rule . 

The Old Testament is one of the best sources of inform¬ 
ation on this early patriarchal society. According to 

Hastings, "the position of children was one of complete sub- 

2 

ordination to the parents" » There is ample evidence to 
indicate the presence of a strong filial relationship with 
the father possessing the supreme authority in all matters. 
The account of Abraham taking nis son Isaac to tne altar 
(Genesis 22) and the sacrifices of children by their parents

to the god, Molech, (Leviticus 18:21; 20:2-5; II Kings 
23:10; Jeremiah 32:35) indicates that the father had the 
power of life and death over nis children. A limit to this 
power is set forth in Deuteronomy 21:18-21, where the elders 
of the city exercise the right to punish a disobedient son. 

If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son 
which will not obey the voice of nis father, or the 
voice of his mother, and that when they have chast¬ 
ened him, will not hearken unto them: Then shall his 
father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him 
out unto the elders of ms city, and unto the gate 
of his place; And they snail say unto the elders of 
his city, “This our son is stubborn and rebellious, 
he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a 
drunkard. And all the men of nis city shall stone 
him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put 
evil away from you; and all Israel shall hear and 
fear « 1 

Any child that would curse or smite his father or mother 
was to be put to death (Exodus 21:15-17) while children 
not showing due respect to their parents were accursed® 

In the Book of Broverbs parents are urged to use care up 
to the point of severity in the upbringing of their child¬ 
ren, (3:12; 15:24; 15:5; 22:6; 29:15). 

These frequent exhortations seem to indicate that the 
presence of delinquent, most usually disobedient, children 
was not uncommon in early nebraic society. The family 
organization, however, made children wholly dependent upon 
their parents. In the opinion of Bastings, this would tend 
to produce an “intensely strong sense of the closeness of 
the filial bond ana a horror oi any violation of it“ hence

detering a cnild from disobedience or delinquent behavior • 
The ideas of retaliation and vindictiveness were like¬ 
wise a characteristic of the "lex talionis" of tne rvoman 
raw. The power of control over tne family was vested in 
tne father ana Known as "patria potestas". It extended 
to decisions of life and death over children as well as 
slaves. In all instances, the judgment of tne patriarch 

was absolute and final, there being no appeal from his 
2 

decision • 

The result of tne judgments of the patriarchs event¬ 
ually became established through oral or written traditions 
and the large body of judgments led to the codes which were 
transplanted on tablets. The Twelve rabies from the homan 
Law form an ancient ana admirable example of such a code. 

The eighth table of the noman aw known as "d© 
delictu " makes reference to a different form of punishment 
to be provided for youths under the age of puberty, oec- 
tion nine of the table reads as follows: 

"Whoever by night furtively cuts or causes to 
be grazed crops by ploughing shall be devoted to 
ueres and put to death if he is an adult, or if he 
is under the age of puberty shall be flogged at tne 
discretion of the praetor ana made to pay double 
value as damages". 

Section fourteen of the same table reads as follows: 

"A thief taken in the act must be beaten... 
Youths are only to be beaten with rods at the dis¬ 
cretion of the magistrate, and condemned to repair 
the damage".

The law dealing with homicide, "Lex Cornelia de 
Secariis et Veneficiis" makes no clear statement as to the 
age a child becomes a human being for the purpose of coming 
under the law. The above two sections of the eighth table 
indicate that some awareness of the difference between 

1 

adult crime and the delinquency of juveniles was present . 

The ideas of Roman Law formed a basis for the laws to 
be used in Great Britain. In Britain, the punishment of 
adult criminals was severe and cruel, intending to show 
the depravity of the criminal and thus deter others rrom 
crime, l-rom the time of Athelstane and Alfred the u-reat 
a few legal enactments concerning children under twelve 
appeared on the statute books. These laws did not pro¬ 
vide any real protection for the children and merely in¬ 
tended to soiten the penalties ror those under the age of 

2 

twelve, xhese laws were frequently disregarded . In the 
time of the norman ana oaxon kings cruel punishments were 
exacted without aiscrimination as to age. As the punish¬ 
ment or criminals usually rollowed established precedents 
there was nttic progress made in any attempt to change it. 

In the Miaaie .ages there is some indication of the 
desire to uisorimmate between the adult criminal and the 
young delinquent, in the rear .books of rdward I a judgment

for burglary was spared to an individual of the age of 
twelve years. There was some recognition that young 
offenders could be reformed to subsequently be fit to 
return to society as useful citizens, but in the years 
that followed,tne principle of awarding different forms 

of punishment or treatment for juvenile offenders seems 

1 

to be lost sight of • 

The primitive spirit of retaliation and revenge 
governed the punishment of the criminal until close to 
the nineteenth century, capital laws were applied equal¬ 
ly to men and women. There was little discrimination made 
on grounds of age. loung adolescent offenders as well as 
children under twelve could be and were sentenced to 
death and executed, hadzinowicz writes, "The law on this 
subject was briefly as foilov/s: No child under seven 
could be pnnished for any capital offence, but children 
of fourteen years of age and over were by law presumed 
to possess complete capacity of discerning between good 
and evil, and could subsequently be subjected to capital 
punishment, nowever, even children between seven and 
fourteen years of age could also be sentenced to death, 
for although in principles they were "doli incapax”, it 
was held that strong evidence of malice might "supply

age” . Even during tne first half of tne nineteenth 

century there was little done to provide for special 
treatment of juvenile offenders, although the idea was 
beginning to take root. Juveniles were arrested by the 
same police officers, they were tried in tne same criminal 
courts, sentenced under tne same criminal lav/s and com¬ 
mitted to the same jails as were adult criminals* 

The workhouse system provided an important impetus 
to the idea that specialized,, segregated, treatment for 
young offenders should be provided in some form, The 
workhouse system developed during the years 1550 to 1700 
and represented what could be termed a transition stage 


1* Radzinowicz, L. : A History of English Criminal Law, p. 11 

2* An example of this is cited in Poster’s Crown Law, 3rd 
edit* 1792, p. 72, where a case of a ten year old boy was 
reported by the bury Summer Assizes of 1748* The boy, 
William York, was sentenced to death after he was con¬ 
victed of murdering a five-year old girl. The evidence 
showed that the boy had taken the girl out of her bed, 
carried her to the dungheap, stabbed her to death with 
a knife, and buried her. After the act he washed him¬ 
self thoroughly. At the court he denied committing the 
murder but later admitted it. The presiding judge asked 
other judges as to whether the boy should be put to death. 
It was decided that the punishment should be death for the 
boy "unless there remaineth any doubt touching his guilt". 

3. J.A.F. Watson in his booklet British Juvenile Courts, 
reports that the death sentence for a minor offence was 
recorded as late as 1833" when a boy of nine was convicted 
at Old Bailey of putting a stick through a shop window and 
though afterwards reprieved was likewise sentenced to be 
hanged by the neck until he was dead.... In 1831 a thirt¬ 
een year old boy was hanged for theft."

between the ancient and the modern prisons* Various cities 

throughout the continent of Europe had workhouses or houses 

of correction for "disobedient children", "lazy boys and 

1 

girls" and "frivolous and insolent" men • 

It was in 1677 that Filippo Franci established a House 
of Refuge for poor boys in Florence. This is perhaps the 
first known provision of its kind that was made for under¬ 
privileged children. The House, an outgrowth of charitable 
work, provided for the supervision of children by "prot¬ 
ectors". The institution also had a special "correction 
department" for unruly boys. Parents placed their boys 
in this House and paid for any correctional treatment 
that may have been given by the "protectors". The descript¬ 
ions of this early House would tend to suggest that the 
"correctional treatment" was little more than of a disciplin¬ 
ary character. 

In 1704, Pope Clement XI inaugurated the era of reform- 

2 

ation by founding the Hospital of St. Michael at Rome . The 

inscription placed over the door reads as follows; 

"For the correction and instruction of 
profligate youth that they, who when idle were 
injurious, may when taught become useful to the 
State". 

The idea of this Hospital was probably taken from the 

3 

Florentian House of Refuge . In the institution there were

fifty to sixty"criminal boys" for whom "sixty single cells 

in three tiers, one above tne other, ten cells in each row, 

on two sides of a spacious nail lignted by three large win- 

1 

dows, one at the end and one at each side", were provided . 
The youths were segregated in their ceils at night and did 
group work during the day in the spacious hall* Talking 
seems to have been completely disallowed when the boys were 
together* In the nail where they worked was placed the 
inscription: 

"It is of little advantage to restrain by 
punishment unless you render them good by discipline.” 

It should be noted that this Institution was not entirely a 

juvenile reformatory and had departments for orphan boys, 

for the aged and the crippled. 

The development of institutions such as the hospital 

did not progress quickly until almost a century later when 

numerous institutions were set up throughout the continent. 

In 1813, Johannes Falk founded a reformatory at Wimmar, 

Germany, for children of criminals and delinquent children. 

here provision was made to give "useful” employment to the 

inmates, in 1819 an institution was founded In herlin which 

was to care for "beggar boys, poor girls, and other destitute 
2 

children" . in 1823 this institution was adapted with a 
reformatory department as well, in the same year an asylum 
for orphans and children of vagabonds and convicts was estab-

lished in hhenish Prussia, in 1820 institutions similar to 

1 

the one at Wimmar were rounded in Erfurt and Ascherslaben . 
The growth of these institutions was rapid and by 1826 they 
were established in nerlin, lvieite.i, nreslau, Danzig and other 
cities in Europe, m 1833 a reform school for children known 
as the haune naus was founded near Hamburg* 

The school farm for juvenile offenders iaiown as "la 
colonie agricole" was started at Mettray, Trance in 1839 
and was opened in 1840. The motto of the farm was; "The 
moralization of youth by tne development of the soil". The 
development of this school farm was sponsored by a philan¬ 
thropic organization called the "Societe Paternelle". 
According to Keckless, "this was probably one of tne most 

signal experiments in children^ institutions, setting tne 

2 

general pattern for modern juvenile handling" . Within 
the next eleven years some fifty-one such farm colonies for 
juveniles were in operation in j? ranee and of these four 
were state-controlled. 

by the middle of the nineteenth century many of the 
European continental countries had inaugurated tne principle 
of reformation to some degree in their methods for handling 
juvenile offenders. Although many of the methods used may 
seem strikingly inadequate in comparison with the provisions 
made for treating youthful offenders in the twentieth century,

the nineteenth century has the nonor of having taken one of 
the first progressive steps in the direction of penal reform 
and tne recognition of the need for treating juvenile del¬ 
inquents separately from adult criminals. 

In U-reat Britain tne history of correctional institutions 
for juvenile offenders can be traced to private organizations 
which were founded during the last half of the eighteenth 
century, fhe Marine Society, founded in 1756, and the Phil¬ 
anthropic society, founded In 1788, gave special attention 
to the children or convicts, and occasionally boys who were 
sentenced to imprisonment or transportation were committed 
to the care of these societies, in 1818, the founding of 
the bagged Schools in .London, provided many poor children 
of the slum areas with food, clothing and shelter for the 
night. Although children were allowed to enter and leave 
of their own accord many of them were brought to these 
schools in the first instance by the police. 

in 1818 an institution for the care of delinquent 
children was established in Warwickshire, inis was probably 
the first imglisn institution based on the principle of ref¬ 
ormation as opposed to the idea of plain punishment. It 

consisted of a farm colony at Stre11on-on-bunsmore where 

1 

about twenty boys were received from neighboring jails • 

The first official attempt to separate adult and youth-

rul male offenders was made in 1838, at Parkhurst prison, 
on tne Isle of Wight, hoys between the ages of ten and 
eighteen, and occasionally some eight and nine years of 
age, were sent to the prison which was essentially penal 
in character, making use of rigorous discipline imposed 
by armed guards. The system was an unduly repressive one. 
Outdoor industrial employment was combined with school and 
religious instruction in an attempt to assist in the ref- 
ormation of the delinquent boys. The prison atmosphere 
proved to be incompatible with the attempt at treatment and 
the experiment was ended m 1864. 

Between 1848 and 1853 reform schools under the auspices 
of private organizations were established at Redhill in 
Surrey, in Birmingham, and at hingswood near Bristol. In 
1854 an Act of Parliament empowered the courts to send 
young offenders to these institutions providing they were 
imprisoned for a period of fourteen days before going to 
the school. ‘The Act also provided for the payment by parents 
to partially cover the cost of the child’s maintenance in 
the school. This Act led to the establishment of reform 
schools in all parts of England and within the next three 
years one or more reformatories had been opened, or were to 
be opened, in thirty-three out of the forty-two counties*. 

Tiie supervision of these schools was entrusted to the Home 
Office in 1860. 

In 1899, an Act of Parliament abolished the compulsory

period of imprisonment which had preceded a child’s entrance 
into a reform school. The last vestige of the idea of the 
value of imprisonment as a deterrent factor in reducing crime 
was finally cut away in the handling of juvenile offenders. 

By the twentieth century Great Britain was well on the 
way to providing treatment facilities for its juvenile 
offenders. The Childrens Act of 1908 was a highly progressive 
measure which provided for the setting up of juvenile courts 
from which the public was excluded. It also stated that no 
child under fourteen years was to be imprisoned, and a child 
under sixteen could be imprisoned if the court was able to 
certify that he was unruly and depraved. The establishment 
of "remand” homes for the purpose of detaining youth await¬ 
ing the disposal of their cases was also a new feature of 
the so-called "Children’s Charter”. 

The Children and ioung Persons Act of 1933 superseded 
the Act of 1908 and extended the jurisdiction of the juvenile 
courts to deal with boys and girls up to their seventeenth 
birthday. 

The treatment facilities established by these acts for 
the delinquent youth in Great Britain were the outgrowth of 
two centuries of untiring work by private and public organ¬ 
izations that were convinced that the principle of reform¬ 
ation must supersede that of retaliation and retribution. 

Curing the early years of the nineteenth century there 
was no provision made for the separate treatment of juvenile

offenders in the united states, uhildren were prosecuted 
by the adult courts and were imprisoned with adults. There 
are few statistics available which .pi show what type of 
crime or misdemeanor the children were guilty of in these 
early years of the period. There is evidence that many 
were of a minor nature, such as the running away of appren¬ 
tices who were tired of working for tneir masters, many 

children were picked up by the police and thrown into the 

1 

common jails where they were Kept with adults . 

in 1825, the Society for the keformation of Juvenile 

■Delinquents in kew lork Uity opened the Tirst nouse of 

kefuge. m this nouse, care was to be provided for ”neg- 

lected boys'* as well as those charged with petty crimes. 

in the opinion of Teeters, this was the first institution

anywhere to which children were committed by the court • 
in 1826, noston established a part of its old nouse 
of uorrection for juveniles, in 1828, Philadelphia had 
established a nouse of reformation to eliminate the plac¬ 
ing of juvenile offenders in walnut Street Prison. Sim¬ 
ilar nouses were established by 1854 in new Orleans, uin- 
cinnati, and .Baltimore.

The program, training, ana treatment varied widely in 
these early douses of refuge, otern discipline, confinement, 
and industrial word: were supposed to lead these cnilaren 
into -ways of usefulness ana virtue 1 *. At lMew lorK and 
Boston an attempt was made to inaugurate a type of honour 
system, a child sent to one of these institutions stayed 
there for an indeterminate period of time. After he had 
completed the specified training he was apprenticed out in 
the free community, remaining under the school*s super- 
vision until he reached maturity. These institutions were 
local in character, managed ana supported through private 
organizations. 

Towards the middle of the nineteenth century the move¬ 
ment for the provision of otate care ror young offenders 
was well under way. In 1847 the first otate institution 
was established at westboro, Massachusetts, and was called 
the lyman ochool ror Boys. The first training school Dased 

on a cottage plan was established by the otate of Ohio in 

1 

1856 and was Known as the ohio ice form ochool • The main 
impetus for the introduction of the cottage system seems 
to nave come from *la colonie agricoie" at mettray in 
Trance. These state schools were to serve the delinquents 
sentenced by the courts, rhe new plan involved a certain

alteration or the program for the delinquent children, The 
objectives of discipline, correction and "reformation" were 
kept in principle, aithougn the method of treatment that 
characterized the majority of the schools stressed segre¬ 
gation, military discipline, hard work, and academic and

by 1900 there were some sixty-five reformtories for 

juveniles in the united States including private and public 

institutions, in 1935 there were one hundred and eleven 

state institutions for juvenile offenders, fifty two of 

which were for boys, fifty for girls and nine for both 

boys and girls, There were institutions of this type in

all states as well as in the District of uolumbia. 

The first reformatories in the united States were 
greeted with a flush of enthusiasm and generous support. 

Ihe ideal of reformation had been the dominating motive 
in the minds of those men who founded these institutions. 
Moreover, the leadership of the institutions was of an 
unusually high quality and the boys showed their superiors 
due respect at all times, it was not long, however, before 

/ 

a spirit of indifference crept into the management of these 
institutions. This resulted in the training schools and 
reformatories for the youthful offenders becoming juvenile

deadening routine and repression, several of tnese instit¬ 
utions were considered with distrust by the public. 

in Canada, the principle of reformation in dealing with 
juvenile offenders followed a line of development similar 
to that of ureat Britain. The criminal courts considered 
the child over seven years of age as competent to commit 
crime and to be tried and punished in the same manner and 
according to the same principles as a mature adult, ohortly 
before the beginning of the twentieth century there is a 
record of a child of eleven who was sentenced to serve 

three years in dorchester Penitentiary for committing a 

1 

theft • 

In 1908, the principle of reformation involved in the 
trial and punishment of delinquent children was recognized 
in Parliament,, This act was called the juvenile delin¬ 
quents Act and was based to a certain extent on the exp¬ 
eriments in creat Britain and. the united states. The Act 
was revised in 1929. 

This was not the rirst time that the government had 
administered legislation concerning the method or handling 
delinquent children. In 1894, the Ontario Children*s Aid 
Societies obtained an enactment in parliament providing for 
the trial of juvenile offenders to be held in camera. This 
legislation also provided for the detention of delinquent

children apart from adult prisoners charged with criminal 
offences or serving prison sentences. This measure applied 
to the wnole of the dominion. 

±n Ontario, when a boy or girl under tnirteen years 
of age was charged with an offence within the province, 
the court was supposed to notify the children's Aid society 
before the child was brought berore the judge. After 
such notification, the Society would attempt to investigate 
the case and make a report on the home environment, the 
neighborhood, and the possible needs of the child. The 
legislation also provided for the placement of ciiildren in 
foster homes or industrial schools as an alternative to 
sentences involving imprisonment in jails. 

The Juvenile delinquents Act of 1908 could be put 
into force in any province by proclamation. The province 
concerned would first have to pass an Act providing for 
the establishment of juvenile courts and provisions for 
detention facilities for children. Under the Act a "child" 
is any boy or girl, apparently or actually, under the age 
of sixteen years. &y proclamation of the uoveraor-in- 
council, any province may direct that the term "child" 
shall mean any boy or girl, apparently or actually, under 
the age of eighteen years. The provinces of British Col¬ 
umbia, Alberta and wianitoba have passed legislation in this 
latter regard*

investigate tne .Penal System of Canada, tne juvenile 
Delinquents Act was based on the following principles: 

"1. A child ought not to be treated as an adult even 
though it breaKs tne law. Although a child over 
the age of seven years is regarded as capable of 
committing crime, it ought not to be held as 
strictly accountable for its actions as an adult. 

2. incarceration of children awaiting trial ought 
to be permitted in detention homes properly 
arranged for the purpose. 

3. .Probation is a more effective method of dealing 
with juvenile offenders than imprisonment. 

4. where probation fails, children ought to be 
detained in industrial schools or reform schools 
for education, training and reformation, and not 
sentenced to prison for punishment. 

5. Children put on probation ought to be under the 

supervision of trained probation officers. Where 
probation officers are not appointed, a voluntary 
committee of citizens should be available to 
assist and advise the court.” 1 


In the more thickly populated areas of Canada juvenile 
courts have been established and probation services have 
been worked out. xviany centres have guidance, psychiatric, 
and social work services which assist the courts in making 
studies of the children that have been apprehended, in 
less populated areas these services are not available and 
the juvenile court judge may be a local Justice of the Peace 
or a Police magistrate who disposes of the juvenile cases 
brought before him as he best sees fit. The existence of 
many large, sparsely settled areas throughout the dominion 
adds to the problem of providing adequate facilities for 
handling juvenile offenders.

Apart from the general provisions made for the treatment 
of juvenile offenders under the juvenile uelinquents Act, 
each province establishes its own delinquency services, as 
would be expected, this arrangement leads to a diversity 
of treatment methods used from province to province. On 
the whole, extensive use is made or probation services in 
most provinces. All provinces, with the exception of 
Prince hdward island and Alberta, have industrial or fram¬ 
ing schools for their juvenile offenders.

TEE RISE OF THE JUVENILE COURT 




22 


THE RISE OF THE JUVENILE COURT 

It would be beyond the scope of this thesis to give 

an adequate treatment of the history and development of 

1 

the juvenile court « The legal precedent for the court 
was implicit in the philosophy of "parens patriae" where 
the state would assume the responsibility for protecting 
or guarding a child suffering from disability or hardships. 
In England this arrangement, made in the interests of the 
welfare of certain children, was in practice as early as 
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. 

The establishment of the juvenile court did not take 
place until the latter part of the nineteenth century. 

The main impetus came from an increasing public awareness 
that bringing a child before the existent criminal courts 
was not in the best interests of the child 1 s welfare. In 
the United States, various improvements had been made in 
criminal court procedure for delinquent children during 
the latter half of the last century. In Canada, the 
Federal legislation of 1894 provided for separate children’s 
hearings. These modifications of administering justice 
were local however, and the distinction of being the first

country to establish separate children*s courts must go 
to Australia where such courts were established early in 
the 1890's to "avoid as far as possible, the surroundings 

of the police court" and the detrimental effects they may 

1 

have on children » 

the establishment or juvenile courts in Chicago and 
uenver in 1899 represented a radical departure ±rom the 
traditional ways or dealing with juvenile offenders, 
t>udge ren nindsay, of the Denver court, has the honour of 
being the first man to call delinquent children ?i wards" 
of the state, rather than considering them "enemies" of 
society. Although the fact that the establishment of special 
children's courts first took place in Australia must not 
be overlooked, it was the establishment of tne juvenile 
court in the united states several years later, that is 
more frequently cited as the important landmark in juvenile 
court historyo 

rhe childrens Act of 1^08 and the Juvenile x/elinquents 
Act of the same year provided for the establishment of 
juvenile courts in ureat Britain and uanada, respectively. 

The early juvenile courts attempted to make tne folio?/** 
ing provisions in tne interests of the juvenile offender: 

(1) separate hearings for all juvenile offenders. 

these hearings were to tame place apart from the 
criminal court, ana the public, with the except¬ 
ion or parents and witnesses concerned, was to 
be excluded*

(2) The court hearing was to be an informal procedure 

(3) Probation services were to be established in con¬ 
nection with the court. 

(4) Detention facilities were to be established for 
the juvenile offenders, xhese were to be sep¬ 
arate from those detention quarters used for 
adults awaiting trial or the places where del¬ 
inquents were already imprisoned. 

(5) Physical and psychological services were to be 
made available to the court. 

With the exception of some of the better juvenile courts 
many of the early courts fell snort of providing all of 
the above facilities for those juvenile offenders who 
came under their jurisdiction. 

The methods and proceedings of the juvenile courts 
were in many instances strikingly similar to those of the 
criminal courts.. This can be explained on the basis of 
the historical development of the juvenile court. Sher¬ 
wood Norman, commenting on the functions of the juvenile 
court, writes, "Many states still nave juvenile court laws 
which are little more than buds of the criminal court tree 
...The early juvenile courts had to pick u* judges and pro 
bation officers where they could, and consequently many of 
them are administering juvenile justice with a criminal 
flavor...We find that there is much lip service given to 
treatment and to meeting the child’s needs^hile the crim¬ 
inal court philosophy,if not its trappings,hangs like a 

cloud over the juvenile court and the law enforcing and 

1 

corrective machinery it must use” .

In estimating the value of tne juvenile court as it 
exists today, most authorities would not quarrel with the 
underlying principles upon which it was established, how¬ 
ever, in the past half-century many of the principles have 
not been followed to their conclusion, with the result that 
improvements in juvenile court procedures and methods have 
been at a minimum. 

The court, as it exists today, extends its jurisdid- 
tion unnecessarily to cases which could be: handled more 
adecuately outside the court, providing the necessary fac¬ 
ilities were available. It is not beyond doubt, that the 
exposure of a child to the court atmosphere and procedure 
may be a traumatic experience for the child, it is not 
fair that a child should be labelled 'delinquent 11 merely 
for appearing in the juvenile court, because there are no 
clearly defined statutory limits, the juvenile courts have 

in many instances attempted to broaden their area of 

1 

jurisdiction • 

The majority of courts are not adequately provided 
with treatment facilities for tnose cases that they attempt 
to handle, in principle, there is an effort made to 
individualize treatment, individualization of treatment 
involves extensive use of a variety of facilities in order 
that each delinquent’s needs are dealt with constructively, 
it is not uncommon to find juvenile courts recommending 
a course of action which is typical of punitive rather than

reformative attitude towards the juvenile offender, because 

the facilities for treatment available to the court are not 

sufficiently varied, iviorrnan reports that because of a 

lack of proper facilities some 40,000 children or more are 

1 

detained annually in jails . 

Another criticism directed at the juvenile court of 
the present day is the frequent attempt to handle a large 
number of unofficial cases through an inadequate probation 
staff. Many judges feel it an honour to show as few cases 
of delinquency as possible in their annual reports and 
therefore attempt to handle the less serious cases through 
a method of unofficial probation. This practice is quest¬ 
ionable whereever the probation staff is already doing a 
too-distended and too-diluted job. similarly, many judges 
feel that it is unwise to commit a large number of juvenile 
offenders to institutions or training schools, even in 

instances where the situation would warrant such committals. 

2 

This tends to increase the burden on the probation staffs • 
The judges of many juvenile courts are not adequately 
trained for their position. The judge, must be capable in 
legal procedure and the interpretation of the law. This 
enables him to pass a verdict on a child 1 2 s behavior and 
classify it as delinquent or non-delinquent, if the child 1 s

behavior is found to be delinquent*the judge must attempt 
to discover the possible reasons for the particular form 
or expressed behavior. This demands some knowledge of the 
social sciences such as sociology, child psychology, and 
child welfare, naving evaluated the child*s personality 
and discovered the needs and social requirements>the judge 
must then decide upon the treatment facilities that he must 
use for the child. 

In the juvenile courts of the present day the inform¬ 
ation gathered during a pre-hearing investigation is used 
in the court. Some of this information may be used as a 
basis for adjudication. This procedure is questionable, 
especially where the pre-hearing investigation brings into 
court information that might be loosely gathered, and may 
consist of opinion, gossip, slander or prejudice, unless 
the judge is trained in the social sciences it is not 
probable that he will be able to Interpret the information 
that a social worker, psychologist, and psychiatrist may 
give to the court, and which they alone are qualified to 
interpret. This lack of qualifications on the part of the 
judge has led some authorities to propose that the functions 
of the judge should not. extend beyond legal matters, and 
that decisions relating to the treatment of the juvenile 
offender should be in the hands of properly qualified people.

iciary, and of the administrative machinery for the treatment

limited to ascertaining guilt or innocence...Once the 
fact of penal offence has been established, the court having 
served as safeguard for citizen’s rights and of public 
interest, the offender should become subject under certain 
general regulations, such as the theory of habeas corpus, 
to an administrative macninery independent of the courts 
and entrusted with the task of custody, education, rehab¬ 
ilitation, and eventual release of the offender...The 
personnel provided for carrying through such a system for

suitable for the purpose.. .This group of persons .should be 
trained in educational case work, mental hygiene, and voc¬ 
ational adjustment. They are not to be guards and police¬

should exercise complete and exclusive jurisdiction over 
persons adjuged delinquent by due process of law in the 
courts of the land. It should be the privilege and the 
legal iright of the correctional body to utilize any resources,

teen ana twenty-one in the estate of JMew xork, Jtiarrison 
expresses a similar view to the above, he states, "The 
criminal courts do not possess the technical services for 
examination and studv of offenders which are required for 
making a scientific, thorough diagnosis, at the outset, as 
a basis of determining what Kind of correctional treatment 
shall be followed in each ease. xet the die of treatment 
must be cast under present procedures immediately after

failure, the court has to choose between taking a chance 
in giving him more rope on probation or sending him to an 
institution which may appear to be an equally hazardous 
course, rhe correctional institutions are powerless to 
revise sentences so as to meet situations reflecting im¬ 
provement or failure on the part of offenders during

treatment" . .although these authors make specific reference 
to the conditions prevailing in the criminal courts, the 
opinions expressed are equally relevant to the juvenile 
courts as in many areas the jurisdiction of the latter ex¬ 
tends over children up to eighteen years of age.

Terences in the degree oT success that is attained by tde 
juvenile court as reported "by different research workers 
must be attributed in part to the different criteria used. 
The criterion of success may in itself be largely reponsible 
for the results that are claimed, in many instances, the 
criterion is merely the negative one of recidivism recorded 
over a period of one to five years. This criterion gives 
us no information as to the adequacy of an individual’s 
adjustment after his court appearance, it only indicates 
that the individual has not appeared in the same court a 
second time, moreover, it does not take into account in¬ 
stances where an individual may have lapsed into further 
delinquencies but has not been apprehended, .because of 
the limitations of the criteria based on recidivism, the 
results of success that are claimed should be interpreted 
with caution. 

Early studies undertaken at tiie Boston Juvenile aourt 
between the years 1906 and 1911 indicates that during the 
five-year period 34/b of the juvenile offenders were re¬ 
turned to the court a second time. In the subseauent five 

1 

years 29 fo were appearing in court for the second time .

Boston Juvenile court and who had been referred to the

88. Z°/o were apprehended and appeared in court for the second 
time in the first five years after the post-treatment period . 

In interpreting the above results one should Keep in 
mind that success often depends on the way the treatment 
that was recommended was carried out. if tne facilties 
used by the court for treating an individual offender are 
inadequate the juvenile court is not condemned because it 
recommended the particular form of treatment. 

The routine procedures that are followed by some of 
the juvenile courts in dealing with delinquent children 
may account for the high degree of recidivism, in a 
survey of the data presented by healy and bronner it was 
discovered that one juvenile delinquent appearing before 
the Chicago court was committed to probation a total of 
seven times and appeared in court a total of fourteen 
times before he was sentenced to a penitentiary . 

The results of the classic studies quoted above 
indicate that the juvenile court and the treatment fac¬ 
ilities at its disposal could be used to better advantage 
in the rehabilitation of juvenile offenders. The high degree 
of recidivism reported in the Gleuck studies signifies that

THE DEVELOPMENT Off PROBATION 




34 


THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROBATION 

The derivation of the word probation from the Latin 
"probo", meaning, "I prove", gives some idea of the origin¬ 
al meaning of the term, .briefly, it was a measure by which 
an individual would be given a second chance to prove his 
worth in the society in which he lived, and whose laws ne 
had transgressed. This practice was rooted in early jud- 
icial procedure where the magistrate, confronted by an 
individual whose case demanded mercy, would in instances 
bind him over "to be of good behavior" or "to Keep the 
peace 11 . This provided for a partial and conditional form 
of liberty, with some degree of supervision. Other legal 
forms of leniency, such as the suspended sentence or of the 
suspended execution of the sentence, which relied on the 
future good behavior of an individual, are also the early 
and primitive counterparts of the probation system of today. 

Probation, or a form of probation, was in practice 
long before statutory provision was made for it. The work 
of the Marine Society, which was established in mngland in 
1756, made provision for the supervision of boys by the 
Society as an alternative to committing them to the exist¬ 
ent penal institutions, in the united States, the work of 
Peter Oxenbridge ihacher provided impetus to the practice 
of probation. Thacher, a judge of the criminal court, ut¬ 
ilized an unofficial form of probation by placing juvenile 










- 35 


offenders under tne supervision of constables, sheriffs, 
or other persons. The offender was placed on probation 
before the sentence was passed, if his behavior proved 
to be satisfactory he was returned to the court, where he 
was given a suspended sentence or his case was dismissed. 

The two men who perhaps are most frequently quoted 
as being the pioneers of the probation system are lohn 
Augustus, a boston shoemaker, who began his unpaid pro¬ 
bation with adults and delinquent youth in 1841, and 
Kufus book, who began his work twenty years later in the 
same city, luring the period from 1841 to 1859, Augustus 

1 

had ‘'saved” from jail about 2000 men, women, boys and girls . 

Statutory provision was made for probation for the 
first time in the Massachusetts Act of 1869. The first 
statutory provision made in England was the probation of 
Offenders Act of 1907. 

Although in principle, probation has been used widely 

in treating juvenile offenders, there is no clear definition 

of the term available at the present time. Although the 

word appears in the statutes, it is seldom, interpreted 

there, very often, definitions of the term vary and tend 

to reflect a worker's experience, his views, and his phil- 
2 

osophy . however, most workers agree on the principle of

probation and the ways in which it is used with juvenile 
offenders. 

In the first place probation implies a certain amount 
of supervision and guidance given to the juvenile offender 
by trained workers of the juvenile court. 

in the second place, the method of probation used with 
delinquent children implies some degree or self-rehabilit¬ 
ation . 

±n the third place, emphasis is placed on the use of 
facilities within the community which can be used in an 
attempt to rehabilitate the individual child. 

xhe legal aspect of probation is involved in the 
suspension or a sentence. This makes it possible for the 
child to remain at home or in a foster home, rather than 
being committed to an institution. 

Probation is not, as public opinion would have it, a 
method of unsystematized lenient dispostion by the court. 
The individual must prove to the court that he can adjust 
in a socially acceptable manner. The child does this with 
the help of his family, the community, and the supervision 
of the probation officer. xhis does not mean that the per¬ 
iod of probation consists of a dominating authority order¬ 
ing and forbidding the delinquent child. 

m describing the use of probation with delinquent 
children one writer states, "Probation offers the delin¬ 
quent a maximum chance for reabsorption into normal com- 






37 


munity life; it promises a framework for individualization 

of treatment, the avoidance of imprisonment, so injurious 

to self-respect and so fraught with the danger of intens- 

1 

ifying criminal habits" ♦ Young expresses a similar opin¬ 
ion when she writes, "...the primary purposes of probation 
are to keep the offender in his own hone or community, if 
the situations warrant it, to avoid the stigma and the dis¬ 
advantages of institutional commitment, and to train and 

re-educate him in a ’normal* environment and within ’normal* 

2 

social relations" * 

During the period of probation,guidance and super¬ 
vision are carried out by the probation officers. It is 
generally admitted by all authorities writing on this 
aspect of delinquency treatment, that the personnel involved 
in carrying out probation work should be specially trained. 
The understanding of child problems and the possible psychol¬ 
ogical and sociological factors responsible for them demand 

specialized training* 

American 

In 1945, a/committee of the Professional Council of 
National Probation and Parole Association formulated the 
"Standards for Selection of Probation and Parole Officers" 
after consulting with many administrators in the correct¬ 
ional field. As a minimum of training the "Standards" rec¬ 
ommend a bachelor’s degree from a college or university of

courses in social sciences; one year ol paiu full time

individual must possess goou. character and a balanced 
and emotionally stable personality. 

it was not expected that these ‘'Standards' 1 would be 
accepted immediately by agencies or courts involved in 
probation worn, it is not uncommon to line statutes tnat 
are silent about the quaiiric&tions or probation on leers, 
merely stating that they should be "Discreet persons of 
reputable character”. The committee did not wish to sug¬ 
gest that all untrained probation workers should be re¬ 
placed by trained personnel for it realized that there 
were in many communities individuals, who were doing suc¬ 
cessful work, after qualifying and gaining professional 
competence through self-educationand assimilated experience. 

frequently, in small towns and rural areas it is com¬ 
mon to find interested lay citizens who offer their services 
voluntarily for the purpose of supervising youngsters placed 
on probation in their community. These individuals can 
offer beneficial probation service to children in remote 
places in tne country, who would not otherwise receive any 
close supervision during the period of probation. There 
should be some attempt made at the dareful selection of 
these citizens for probation. The service of volunteers 




- 39 


should not be used however, where the services of fully 
qualified, full-time probation officers are vitally needed, 
even thougn volunteer services may be more expedient from 
the standpoint of economy. 

In the studies on the results of probation used with 
delinquent children the uleucks report that some officers 
had a higher proportion of successful cases than others. 
a survey of the qualifications of the probation officers 
indicates that those who were better qualified through 
training or experience had a higher proportion of successes 
than those who were less qualified. Although some of the 
difference might have been due to the factor of more 
intensive work with the delinquents under their care, the 
results tend to indicate that trained personnel have a 
greater capacity to influence the juvenile offender. 

Although emphasis in recent years has been placed on 
the training of probation officers,It is not uncommon to 
find agencies and public departments that give very little 
consideration to the training of the people they appoint to 
work as probation officers. One writer, in describing the 
probation officers found in many agencies today, states, 

"For the most part they are harrassed men of small abilities 
doing a haphazard job, and like everyone else, attempting 
to justify their work by impressive figures or stacks of 
reports. Of If they are not this, they are bombastic pol¬ 
iticos for whom the atmosphere of the courtroom is a stage

in which they perform in self-delusion that their role 
is one of importance. The position of parole or probation 
officer is a grand repository for party spoils, to be dis¬ 
tributed to minor ward organizers and vote getters and 
membership in the niwanis, the notary, the Llks, and the 
iViasons, is a more important qualification than training 
in social worh or a degree from a university” . 

The juvenile offenders that are placed on probation 
must be carefully selected, une author writes, "The suc¬ 
cess of probation depends first upon the wise selection of 

2 

cases for this type of treatment” . before a child is 
placed on probation in his own home the court or agency 
concerned should be certain that the home conditions are 
sufficiently conducive to the proper upbringing of child¬ 
ren. The neighborhood and its possible beneficial or det¬ 
rimental effects on the child’s behavior must also be 
considered, probation should not be used in those instances 
where the child is in need of treatment which can only be 
provided through institutionalization. Probation cannot 
be handed out automatically in all cases where the child 
has committed nis first serious offence or has been brought 
before the court for the second or third time. From what 
has been stated above it can be seen that probation as a 
form of treatment for the delinquent child depends on care-

ful selection of cases and is to be used in conjunction 
with other methods of treatment which should be available 
to the court. 

•rhe success of probation depends to a certain extent 
upon the amount of supervision and guidance that the pro¬ 
bation officer can give to each juvenile offender placed 
under him. The heavier the case-load, the less intensive 
will be the work of the probation officer with each indiv¬ 
idual child, most authorities recommend that for effective 
probation work the probation officer should not nave more 
than fifty cases under his supervision at any one time® 

The form of guidance given by the probation officer to 
the cases under his supervision may have a direct influence 
upon the success of probation. The probation officer may 
personally contact the child and the family at regular 
intervals. This would provide an opportunity for the 
family and child to discuss any difficulties that may arise 
during the period of probation, it would also provide 
the probation officer with an opportunity for estimating the 
improvement in the child* s adjustment. On the other hand, 
the probation officer, because of a heavy case-load may be 
able to do little more than contact the family b t letter, 
and check each child’s record at intervals, on the basis 
of letters received from the child or his family. The 
ability of the probation officer to procure the assistance 
of community agencies in helping in the delinquent’s rehab- 









- 42 


ilitation may also bear some relationship upon the degree 
of success# 

In studies of the results of probation, success or 
failure has usually been measured by the rate of recidivism, 
in post-treatment cases# as stated above, this criterion 
is inadequate, and the results based on it must be inter¬ 
preted witn caution. 

Monachesi did some work at the university of Minnesota 

on the results of probation with 1,515 cases of which 896 

were juveniles, his results suggest that the success of 

probation depends to a large extent on the initial selection 

1 

of cases for this form of treatment . 

In the early report of the clerk of the Juvenile Court 

of Cook-County, in Illinois, the number of juvenile offenders 

that had passed through the court and placed on probation was 

recorded, The records indicated the delinquents who appeared 

before the court a second, third, fourth, or more times. 

between the period 1901 - 1914, healy and jsronner reported 

that of all cases placed on probation 57f® had returned to 

the j‘uvenile court, i-aking the reports as a whole it can 

be said that one in every three cases placed on probation 

appears before the court a second time; one in eight cases 

a third time; and several individual delinquents return 

2 

to the court up to nine times # 

In the third follow-up study of ”500 criminal careers”,

tile Gleucks, report tiiat "despite tne smallness or numbers 
among tne probation successes...those who succeeded were 
on the whole more advantaged than those who failed; and 
this by virtue of better parentage on the one hand and of 

better sturf in tne maKe-up of orfenders tnemselves on

the other" • 

in an earlier study of one thousand juvenile delinquents, 

tne Gleucks report that of 532 delinquents placed on prob- 

2 

abtion or parole, 86 . 8/0 returned to tne court . 

The different results reported by the various workers 
in the field would suggest that there is a possibility that 
different criteria of success are being used. The class¬ 
ic studies of the GleucKs seem to have been more thorough, 
and correlations or the success of probation and such 
factors as the home economic situation, education of the 
child, school truancy and others have been attempted in 
an effort to establish "prediction tables". Another reason 
for the difference in results may be due to the fact 
that the period in which the success is estimated may vary. 
Some results indicate the degree of recidivism during the 
period of probation while others are indicative of recid¬ 
ivism during the post-treatment period. 

As a method of treating juvenile delinquents probation 
has been described as one of the "most important milestones

in the progress of penology" . Although the above studies 
show that many individuals do not benefit from this form 
of treatment, it should be remembered that many juvenile 
offenders are spared the experience of being committed to 
an institution, furthermore, probation should prove of 
greater value in treating juvenile offenders as the prob¬ 
ation officers become better trained for their work, as 
case loads are reduced and the methods of probation are 
improved.

FOSTER 


HOME PLACEMENT 




46 - 


FOSTER - HOME PLACEMENT 

The placement of children in foster homes has been 
practised widely in Europe for many generations. In Scot¬ 
land, there is a record of a delinquent child being placed 
in a foster home around 1750. France, being an agricultural 
country, favored foster-home placement in the case of neg¬ 
lected or destitute children. Delinquents in Germany were 
placed in selected foster homes in rural areas. The idea 
of foster-home placement was not considered too favorably 
in England, where institutionalization of neglected, des- 

1 

titute, or delinquent children seems to have been preferred . 

In the United States and Canada the characteristics 
of frontier life often led to the placement of children in 
foster homes, irecuently these homes were managed by 
relatives of the child concerned. One of the results of 
these early foster-home placements has been the development 
of a highly favorable attitude towards this form of treat¬ 
ment in these countries. Foster-home placement is therefore 
widely used in connection with treating juvenile offenders, 
even though other forms of treatment, such as that provided 
in an institution would prove to be of greater therapeutic

value to some delinquents. 

In using foster-home placement for the delinquent child 
an attempt is made to provide a "natural" family setting, 
where a child f s delinquency is related to the situational 
factors of his own home environment, the change may be very 
beneficial. Placement in a foster home provides a greater 
degree of intimacy for the child than is possible in a large 
institutional or group setting. Workers favoring foster¬ 
home placement for delinquent children stress the fact 
that institutional life is characterized by artificialities, 
and recommend the use of roster homes to a greater extent 

before institutional treatment is considered for any young 
1 

person. however, roster homes have definite limitations, 
and should not be used in instances where the individual 
case warrants treatment which can only be provided by in¬ 
stitutions. lor example, it would be unwise to use foster¬ 
home placement in the case of a child that presented ser¬ 
ious behavior problems and ?/as in need of prolonged ther¬ 
apy, . 

One of the main difficulties encountered with using 
foster-home placement is the lack of good, trained foster 
parents through whom some effective treatment of the del¬ 
inquent might be possible. The foster home is too unspec¬ 
ialized if any therapy is needed, success in treating the

delinquent cnild may depend to a large extent on the 
available treatment facilities in the community which can 
give assistance to the roster parents. 

roster-home placement cannot be applied to all del¬ 
inquents. m the case of the dull normal group of child¬ 
ren who present behavior problems, it might be distinctly 
more advantageous for the children to go to an institution 
where there is an organized and active program, a controlled 
environment, and devices for assisting them in learning the 
rudiments of socialized living. 

in attempting to establish criteria which could be 
used in considering the possible success of a delinquent 
cnild placed in a foster home, carl nogers has established 
a series of significant indices, .before considering foster¬ 
home placement for a child the following factors should be

studied : 

1. The child’s behavior patterns. 

2. The child’s stability.

over the age of thirteen relatively unfavorable. 

5. Heredity, relative freedom from defects, such as 
mental disease, epilepsy, etc. 

6. Attachment to his own family, the best results 
being obtained where a child is not too attached 

to his parents, where he feels rejected and unhappy. 

7. intelligence, average or close-to-average intellig¬ 
ence being desirable rather than extremely high, or 
worse, extremely low mentality.

Many agencies placing children in foster homes would 
claim that the above standards are too high, nowever, most 
of them would agree with the principles underlying these 
standards. 

to be adequate, loster-home placement ror the delinquent 
child necessitates intensive social case work before and 
after placement. According to one writer, r, In general, the 
best place for a child is within his own family. The maj¬ 
ority of parents, even under the most trying conditions are 
able to loom after their children and give them the security 
and protection they need for their wholesome development, 
but some parents, either because of their own physical, 
mental or emotional incapacities, or because of circum¬ 
stances beyona their control rail in this important task... 
sometimes it is to the child’s best interests to remove him 
from his own home and to place him elsewhere, mis may be 
in an institution or in a family home where the foster par¬ 
ents can give him care ana affection, the discipline and 

training he failed to get from his own family, to decide 

1 

to remove a child from his home is a momentous step.” 

Another writer, commenting upon the use of foster-home 
placement for delinquent children, writes, "Where the home 
is highly faulty in many directions no kind of treatment 
(in that home) will probably be successful. There isn’t

much sense in treating a malaria patient in a mosquito- 
infested. swamp and there is just as much sense in treating 
a highly vulnerable child in the same environment that 

made him highly vulnerable in the first place, and that will 

1 

re-infest him,," 

The family from which a child is to be taken for 
placement in a foster homemust be treated with greatest 
respect. The removal of a delinquent child from a family, 
even when it is evident that the family has failed to ful¬ 
fill its function adequately, is a serious step, for it may 
mean that the home will be broken up, never again to be re¬ 
constructed as a unit, as a direct consequence of the place¬ 
ment. All authorities agree that the work should be under¬ 
taken by qualified, trained personnel and should not be done 
haphazardly. 

Before the delinquent child is to be placed in a foster 
home a definite attempt should be made to know the problem 
and all its relevant factors. The delinquent should be ex¬ 
amined physically, psychologically, and sociologically. An 
attempt should be made to ascertain the motivating causes 
of the delinquent behavior. After such an investigation has 
been made the plan for treatment should be outlined and the 
selection of an appropriate foster home should be made* 

One of the greatest difficulties in using foster-home 
placement with delinquent children is the selection of the

right kind of home for each juvenile offender, homes 
should be classified according to economic standing, loc¬ 
ation, educational facilities, church affiliation, com¬ 
munity and recreational services, members in the foster 
family, and other factors which may be of importance in 
attempting to treat the child. 

In connection with the location of a home, there is 
little justification for the old, but still prevalent, 
assumption that the country is the best place for every 
delinauent boy. to take a ooy from a city atmosphere and 
place him on a farm is not the most advisable, especially 
if a thorough investigation into the farm background is not 
made before tne placement. Too commonly the choice of a 
foster home is made on the basis of letters received by 
agencies supervising placement, asking for M a suitable boy 
to do chores”. Although annual departmental reports of 
such agencies might be highly complimentary, there is no 
way of telling how successful or unsuccessful such place¬ 
ments are. undoubtedly, many boys remain where they are 
placed, others return to tne court eventualljr and are 
sentenced for further behavior difficulties, while many 
leave the farm foster homes, leaving no record behind them. 

In using foster-home placement for delinquent children 
there is a good deal of effort present which passes under 
the name of social case work, and to which people contrib¬ 
ute most generously, but which in the end leaves the del-

inquent child little better than he was at the start. 

"When the task is one of developing the happiness and 
future welfare, out of the entangled life of a delinquent 
child, it is too great a work to be entrusted to inexper¬ 
ienced workers. 

The principles underlying foster-home placement, though 
in themselves sound, have suffered many abuses because of 
the crudeness with which families have been selected and 
the delinquents placed, historically, the neglected, des¬ 
titute or delinquent child was placed in any home that 
would accept him. The crudeness of such placements had 
carried over into the social agencies of today, it is not 
uncommon to find delinquent children in need of institutional 
treatment placed in foster homes, merely because of the 
lack of institutional facilities. Where the therapy of 
skilled workers is needed, it is wrong to place the del¬ 
inquent child in a foster home. As one writer states, 

"Foster parents are not trained in psychology or psychiatry, 
hor would we want them to be. They are parents. They are 
people who have achieved a successful living of their own 

lives and who want to share their lives and homes with a 

1 

child” . After commenting on tne limitations of foster 
homes as far as providing therapy for the delinquent child

is concerned, one autnor states, "At most one may say, 
straining accuracy somewnat, that under circumstances of 

ideal foster domes and institutions, it would generally 

1 

be more desirable to try foster-dome placement first" . 

Studies of tne outcome of foster-dome placement have 
shown a digder proportion of successes than is to be found 
by using other forms of treatment, however, there dave 
been very few long-term studies made of tde delinquents 
placed in foster domes wdicd would compare with the work 
done by the Gleucks on tde results of institutional treat¬ 
ment methods, it must also be stated that during tde early 
years of tde juvenile court, tde probation system and var¬ 
ious institutional forms of treatment tde first outcome 
studies were unusually favorable towards tne particular 
method considered. Upon closer examination of the data 
through prolonged studies, much of the earlier work nas 
been contradicted . 

The classic study of Healy, nronner, naylor, and 
Murpny of delinquent children placed in foster nomes in¬ 
dicates a high degree of success as a result of this form 
of treatment. According to their results, of 501 delinquents, 
consisting of recidivists as well as first offenders, almost 
85 % ceased to be delinquent under foster-dome care. The

501 cases were handled by the Judge mker foundation Clinic 
in boston over a period of eight years and became the basis 
for the appraisal of foster home outcomes. 

Of the 501 cases, 286 were males and 215 females. The 
number of first offenders was 104 or 20^> of the total group, 
whereas the repeaters totalled 300 or 60 u /o of the group. 
Children who had problems of personality but were non-del¬ 
inquent totaled 71 or 14 °/o of the group, and individuals 
with problems of habit, but non-delinquent totalled 26 or 
6 J /<> of the total, sixty-six percent of the group were of 
normal mentality, while ±0fi were defective mentally. One 
per cent of the group was psychotic and 23 jo of the del¬ 
inquents had abnormal or peculiar personalities. 

The delinquent behavior manifested by the above group 
consisted of stealing, running away, truancy, and sexual 
offenses. Of the non-delinquent group there were 20$> 
presented problemsof habit and personality. 

The criteria of success and failure were defined as 
follows: "Success, most conservatively stated, means that 
the individual, whether presenting behavior, personality, 
or habit problems, has made a steady gain in his ability 
to master his difficulties and maintain his position as a 
desirable member of a family and of a community. We have 
not meant by success that the problem individual has be¬ 
come a person without blemish, or, that once placed, he 
has become suddenly transformed. Such a metamorphosis

occurs but rarely. Many of tne individuals whom we have 
called successes have shown some relapses, but these re¬ 
currences were at increasingly great intervals, so that the 
individual could be maintained in a foster home and seemed 
to be progressively conquering his faults. Practically 
speaking, they are cured cases in the foster home. The 
failure group represents those whose delinquencies persist 
or whose personality difficulties remain or increase, or 

whose habits are largely unmodified so that they do not 

1 

adjust satisfactorily to conditions in family life” . On 
the basis of this criterion almost 85 fo of the total group 
considered were successes. 

in- interpreting the results of the above study several 
factors should be kept in mind, in the first place, the 
children were appraised during the treatment period. At 
the time of appraisal they were under the guidance of the 
foster home parents, nuring this period the services of 
the ulinic staff members were available to the foster par¬ 
ents. in the second place, infractions of the children 
during their stay in the foster home were not considered 
as relapses indicative of recidivism, if these relapses 
had been considered as failures the percentage of successes 
would be lowered considerably, in the third place, the 
cases chosen for foster-home placement were carefully sel-

56 


elcted. The Clinic had at its disposal other available 

methods of treatment for those delinquents whom it did not 

deem advisable to place in foster homes. In the fourth 

place, one author feels that the results reported reflect 

at least in part an unusually intensive treatment of the 

1 

cases rather than an ordinary foster-home program . In 
the fifth place, thecriterion of success that is used has 
a direct effect on the results. Other workers, using 
different criteria would report different results. 

In contrast to the results mentioned above, the Gleuck 
study of "One Thousand Juvenile Delinquents”, reports a 
success rate of only 15% among the delinquents placed in 
foster homes. However, it should be stated that the Gleuck 
study was made on only 41 placements. 

Foster-home placement, in spite of its limitations, can 
be used for treating juvenile delinquents, providing ad¬ 
equate facilities and trained personnel are available. 
Wherever agencies or courts lack the facilities and person¬ 
nel to carry out foster-home placement adequately, as well 
as in those instances where the delinquents stand In need 
of skilled therapy, foster-hfome placement should be used 
with discretion. The case studies reported by Saj^les are 
indicative of the need for many varied facilities, as well 

as trained personnel in any attempt to use foster-home nlace-

THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION 

OF JUVENILE DELINQUENTS 






58 


THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION 
OF JUTE NILE DELINQUENTS 

The early institutions that made special provisions 
for delinquent or neglected children were founded mainly 
by philanthropic organizations. They were paternal in 
character and attempted to give protection and guardian¬ 
ship to the children, in the administration of these 
institutions it was not uncommon to find a definite break 
made with the philosophy of punishment ana a sincere effort 
directed towards correction and reformation by training. 

With the establishment of government and state-run instit¬ 
utions for juvenile offenders, there was a return to the 
penal or semi-penal atmosphere in many industrial schools 
and reformatories, one author describes the conditions of 
these later institutions as follov/s: "The institutional 
routine practically paralleled the routine of adult prisons - 
march formations, state clotnes, looms, bars on windows, 
silence rules, mess, required labor, corpora.! punishment, 
demerits for transgression of rules and so forth,*..The 
juvenile reformatories had so strayed from their original 
guardianship purpose and spirit that judges, police, public 
and offenders, looked upon them as penal institutions, while 
social workers were seeking to find means and ways of hand¬ 
ling delinquent children without institutionalizing them

and of softening the penal discipline and primitive atmos- 

T_ 

phere of the juvenile correctional schools' 1 . it was not 
until 1930 or so, that a renaissance in thought about ref¬ 
ormation and a return to the original concept of training 

£ 

and rehabilitation tooK place in the united States . in 
Great .Britain, the efforts to improve institutional treat¬ 
ment for delinquent children and young adults led to the 
development of the approved Schools and the borstal System 
in the early years of the twentieth century. 

The judge of the juvenile court is the person who in 
most instances, must decide on the basis of the evidence 
submitted to him, the way in which a child can best be 
treated. In the united States and Canada, the commitment 
of a delinquent child to an institution is not seriously 
considered until other possible methods for dealing with 
the offender have been tried or given consideration, it 
is generally agreed, that before committal to an institut¬ 
ion should take place, an attempt should be made to return 
the child to his home with, or without, supervision, place 
him on probation, or place him in a foster home. After all 
the possibilities have been given consideration, the case 
might still warrant placement in an institution for juvenile 
offenders. The carerul use of the power to commit a young 
offender to a reformatory is wise, as it attempts to avoid 


1. ixeckless, w. U., op. cit., p. 353.

- 60 


much of the stigma and contamination that a child may suffer 
unnecessarily as a direct result of institutionalization. 

The court, in most instances, has a double duty to 
fulfill, if the offence or misdemeanor is sufficiently 
serious, and is in the nature of such acts as armed burg¬ 
lary, robbery, assault or homicide, the motive of protect¬ 
ing society must take precedence. The court may therefore 
deem it necessary to commit an individual to an institution 
in order to protect society, even though it is probable 
that probation or foster-home placement would provide for 
quicker rehabilitation of the child. On the other hand, 
the court must always seek to protect the juvenile offender 
from unnecessary commitment to an institution. 

There are several advantages of institutional treat¬ 
ment for juvenile delinquents which shall be mentioned here. 
In the first place, institutionalization incapacitates an 
individual for a period of time and in this way provides a 
period of security for the community. This apparent virtue, 
which is related to the concept of protecting society, is 
not a positive one as far as the treatment of the offender 
is concerned. 

Secondly, many delinquent children require a close 
degree of expert supervision, guidance and therapy which 
cannot be provided by other forms of treatment and can only 
be made available in institutions. It is therefore advant¬ 
ageous to have these children committed to institutions where 


I

such, services are available, rather than attempt to treat 
them by using probation or foster-homeplacement. An ex¬ 
ample of this is the case of the dull normal or mentally 
defective delinquents for whom foster homes are difficult 
to find and treatment by means of probation is inadequate. 

The organized life in the institution, the possibility for 
intensive and prolonged training, and the group social 
setting may prove of great value in assisting this group 
of delinquents in developing socially acceptable behavior 
patterns. 

In the third place, many institutions can provide an 
intensive program of academic and social training. Instruct¬ 
ion in technical subjedts can easily be provided in instit¬ 
utions which are divided into units or departments. This 
makes it possible for the young offender to choose those 
subjects of greatest interest to him and for which he may 
have special ability. Where the cottage system of insti¬ 
tutionalization is used good results may be obtained in 
social training. Administered properly, such training 
affords an individual the opportunity to assume responsib¬ 
ility, to work co-operatively, and to practise the basic 
rules of citizenship. Individual and group recreation 
provides an individual with the opportunity for learning 
to play individually as well as compete with others. 

The results of institutional training indicate that 
many institutions fail to reform juvenile offenders. This

62 


failure is not inherent in the principle of institutional¬ 
ization hut is due to several factors characterizing many 
institutions. 

in the first place, many institutions are characterized 
by traditional punitive methods. Uorporal punishment, in 
the form of "bends”, "squats”, whipping, strapping, com¬ 
bined with solitary confinement on an inadequate diet are 
examples of retributive methods still in practice. In 
large institutions which are frequently filled to cap¬ 
acity, there is need for a certain degree of regimentation, 
which in itself is repressive and unwholesome for personality 
reformation. 

A second unfavorable characteristic of institutions 
is the monotonous, daily routine. A rigid routine does not 
enable a child to plan for himself or to regulate his own 
behavior. It is not uncommon for children whose physical 
cares and economic wants are met in rigid ways to become 
creatures of habit and fall into an infantile dependence. 

The development of social maturity and social responsibility 
depends upon a weaning away from reliance and dependency 
upon others. The opportunity for developing self-control 
and self-confidence is impossible under a regime where an 
individual can make nodecisionsfor himself. With but few 
exceptions, institutional training does not develop within 
the child the character structure necessary for socialized 
living. Noticeable improvement among institutionalized del-

inquents in the ability to assume responsibility, to prac¬ 
tice self-control and to possess self-confidence is often 
due to maturation and not to institutional training. 

The significance of associations formed in an instit¬ 
ution cannot be over-emphasized. One of the basic reasons 
for segregating the young offender from the adult criminal 
was to prevent the possible harmful effects of association 
with a group of rt hardened criminals M . However, the assoc¬ 
iation of a large number of emotionally unstable and mal¬ 
adjusted personalities who have committed delinquencies 
is capable of having similar unwholesome effects on the 
individual delinquent. Within an institution the delinquent 
associates with boys of varied habits. Some of his assoc¬ 
iates may be more experienced in delinquent behavior than 
he is. The development of a delinquent f, code of ethics” 
takes placd within ifcost institutions. The associations, 
friendships, loyalties, and shared attitudes toward author¬ 
ity may do permanent harm in confirming a juvenile delin¬ 
quent’s antisociality. 

Some of the dangers of institutional association could 
be averted if a rigid classification system was adopted 
whereby juvenile offenders could be segregated on the basis 
of age, intelligence, number of delinquencies, kind of del¬ 
inquency, etc., In this way it would be possible to have 
the population in an institution or units of an institution 
more homogeneous. Although this would not remove entirely 





64 


the possible harmful effects of association, it would tend 
to minimize these effects, 

A major handicap of the large, mass congregate instit¬ 
utions is the difficulty of establishing an adequate rehab¬ 
ilitative regime for all of its youth. Any form of treat¬ 
ment should be related and adapted to the needs of the 
individual delinquent. Where large numbers of youth are 
present within an institution it is not lively that indiv¬ 
idual treatment can be arranged, ideally, the institution 
should be divided within itself in order to provide a suf¬ 
ficient variety of treatment for groups of oifenders under 
different classifications. Such intra-institutional indiv¬ 
idualization is handicapped wherever there is a shortage 
of trained personnel on the institutional staff, or wnere 
the structural arrangement of the institution cannot be 
altered readily. 

The child’s initial institutional experience may be 
permanently harmful to the child’s further personality 
development. The child upon entering an instituion for the 
first time may feel unusually insecure, anxious and dis¬ 
turbed emotionally. To alleviate the possible harmful 
effects of the experience of entering an institution for 
the first time the child should be prepared beforehand. 

This preparation can taxe place at a classification or 
special reception center. At tne present time this is done 
in very few instances. 


i/j; 






- 65 


If the cnild feels anxious about entering an instit¬ 
ution for the first time, it is also likely that he will 
experience similar feeling upon his return to the communi¬ 
ty and society. The child could re-enter society with 
greater confidence if the period of institutionalization 
was followed up by superivison and guidance after release. 

In Great .Britain, this is done in the case of boys re¬ 
leased from Borstal institutions, and is considered as 
important in the reformation of young offenders, as the 
training they receive in an institution. Institutional 
treatment assumes that the child’s delinquent conduct is 
caused by factors within the child himself. It tends to 
overlook the possible causes within the child’s environ¬ 
ment. If the causes of the deviant behavior are rooted in 
the child’s environmental situation, the possibility of 
relapse into further delinquency is great if guidance and 
supervision are not provided the child upon his release 
from an institution. Evidence, suggesting the need for 
careful supervision following the period of institutional 

training, is given in a delinquent’s "own story” taken 

1 

from one of Shaw’s case studies » 

Most authorities mention the importance of the train¬ 
ing and quality of the institutional personnel, frequently, 
the view is expressed that no form of institutional treat-

ment ever rises above the quality, training, and morale 
of the staff members. It is generally conceded that it is 
men and not walls that help the male juvenile offender in 
developing adequate, socially acceptable modes of behavior. 

The income level of institutional workers is not sufficiently 
attractive for trained workers to enter the field. Referring 
to the need of more trained institutional staff members in 
present day institutions,Tappan states: "The nature of 
institutional work with delinquents is such as to attract 
an excessive proportion of men and women who have them¬ 
selves failed in the wider community: often inadequate 
personalities with insecurities and reactive aggressions, 
sadists, domineering power seekers, guilt-ridden moral 

1 

masochists, and dependent and regressive social isolates" . 

These unfavourable characteristics, prevalent in many 

institutions, have a significant bearing on the eventual 

outcome of the juvenile offenders receiving institutional 

treatment. Lindner, describing the undesirable aspects of 

institutional treatment as it exists today, concludes, "It 

is a tribute to the many children who have passed through 

these places (detention homes, reformatories, institutions) 

without ill effects that thejr have escaped one of two things, 

the flowering of a criminosis or the development of pernicious 
2 

character traits" . The serious attempt to improve institut-

ional treatment, making it more compatible with the prin¬ 
ciple of reformation, has led to a greater degree of success 
in the rehabilitation of delinquent youth. Before such an 
attempt can be undertaken, both government and the public 
must be aware of the inadequacies and limitations of many 
of the existent institutions for treating juvenile offenders. 
Research studies attempting to discover the success 
of institutional treatment with juvenile offenders indicate 
that between 65 and 85 percent of the boys who have spent 
some time in reformatories, industrial schools, or train¬ 
ing schools, have returned to the court. The extensive 
studies made by the Gleucks, who followed up the history 
of the offenders committed to the Massachusetts Reformatory 
over a period of fifteen years after their discharge, show 

that only 22.6 percent refrained from criminal activities 

1 

after the institutional period . 

Realy and Bronner followed up the careers of 420 

youths of whom 311 had been committed to institutions. 

Their studies indicate that 70 per cent of the cases com- 

itted to institutions were failures, while only 34 per cent 

2 

of those who had not been committed failed . 

Bowler and Bloodgood made a study of 751 boys committed 
to reformatories. Their study indicated that 32 per cent 
of the boys made a generally good adjustment after a period

of five years or more. The remainder of the boys made 
1 

poor adjustments • 

The study by Norman Fenton at the Whittier School in 

California, indicated that of 400 boys who had entered the 

institution between 1928 and 1930, 28 per cent had made a 

satisfactory record up to 1933, 18 per cent had clearly 

failed, and no prediction could be made concerning the 

2 

remainder at that time , 

One of the results of the failure of many institutions 
to rehabilitate delinquent youth has been the attempt to 
develop more adequate institutions for this purpose. The 
following chapter will consider the developments in the field 
of institutional training over the past fifty years which 
have had greater success in the attempt to treat juvenile 
offenders*

NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN INSTITUTIONALIZATION

NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN INSTITUTIONALIZATION 

A. The Borstal System in England 
In 1895, the departmental committee on prisons sub¬ 
mitted a report to the Home Secretary which stressed that 
there were a large number of youths or young adults in 
prison who were not provided with opportunities for reform¬ 
ation. One of the direct results of this report was the 
experiment at Bedford Prison where "younger lads" were 
segregated from the older members of the prison population. 
In 1902, at .Rochester an experiment in treating "juvenile 
adults", consisting of young men from all over England who 
had received sentences longer than one year, was begun. By 
1907, a certain degree of modified training was used for 
young men at Dartmoor and Lincoln. The Prevention of Crime 
Act, passed in 1908, gave formal recognition to Borstal 
training for young adults. This Act enabled the Prison Com¬ 
missioners, "To establish Borstal institutions, that Is 
to say places in which young offenders, whilst detained, 
may be given such industrial training and other instruction 
and be subjected to such disciplinary and moral influence 

as will conduce to their reformation and the prevention of 

1 

crime". Under the provisions of the Act the Borstals were

to be operated and controlled by the state, through the 
Prison Commissioners,a department of the Home office. 

The Prison Commissioners fully realized that the Bor¬ 
stals should not be used in cases where the offender was 
not in need of long institutional treatment. At the same 
time they deemed it essential that some form of training 
should be established for youth who through frequent del¬ 
inquencies would drift into the ranks of the persistent 
offender. The object of the Borstal system was and is, 

"the all-round development of character and capacities - 
moral, mental , and physical, and vocational - with part¬ 
icular emphasis on the development of responsibility and 
self-control, through trust increasing with progress. 

This conception requires conditions as unlike those of a 
prison as is compatible with compulsory detention. Res¬ 
ponsibility and self-control are virtues which can only 
be attained by practicing them, and they cannot be practiced 

without opportunity for self-determination appropriate to 

1 

the stage of development reached". 

In order to prevent unnecessary commitment to Borstal 

the Criminal Justice Act of 1948 gave "effect to the view 

that persons under 21 ought hot to be sent to prison if 

2 

any other course can be properly adopted". This Act pro-

vided for the setting up or Remand and Detention Centers 
for persons 14 - 21 years of age. The Detention Centers 
provide for a form of treatment which consists of educational 
and remedial provisions combined with strenuous work, for 
a period varying from three to six months. These centers 
are separate from prisons and are used in place of committal 
to Borstal where it is felt that the prolonged training 
in Borstal is not necessary. 

Under the Criminal Justice Act the youth may be sen¬ 
tenced simply to "Borstal training" without any specific¬ 
ation of period. By the operation of the second schedule of 
the Act, the period is in effect four years from the date 
of the sentence, divided into two parts. The first part, 
which may not be less than nine months nor more than three 
years, is a period of controlled freedom within a Borstal 
institution. The Prison Commissioners determine the first 
part of the sentence and review the case of the inmate. 

They order his release as soon as they are satisfied with 
the progress of his training. The supervision that is 
given an individual, after he is released from a Borstal, 
represents the second part of the period of Borstal train¬ 
ing. 

The initial step in Borstal training is the classifi¬ 
cation which takes place in one of the two Reception Cen¬ 
ters for boys, located at Latchmer House, Kingston as well 
as in a separate wing of Wormwood Scrubs Prison. Classifi-

cation ensures that "in the light of his (a boy’s) char¬ 
acter, and capacities he may be sent for training to the 
Borstal best suited to his character and requirements". 

Boys are sent to the classification centers within a week 
or so from the time they have been sentenced. 

A.t the Reception Centers boys are carefully observed 
over a period of two months as to their social, psycholog¬ 
ical, educational, and vocational characteristics. From 
the classification center a boy goes to one of the thirteen 
institutions for which he has been selected as suitable 
on the basis of age, character and capacities, as well as 
maturity. Of the thirteen institutions for the training 
of boys, four are security buildings, seven are situated 
in camps or adapted country houses, one is a specially 
built Bor&tal of the open type, and one is an old prison 
with an outlying camp. A correctional Borstal for abscond¬ 
ers and others who misbehave seriously is situated in a 
separate wing of Wandsworth Prison. A Recall Center at 
Portsmouth exists for the further training of boys recalled 
from supervision. 

The treatment at a Borstal is described as follows in 
2 

the Statutory Rules: 

The objects of training shall be to bring to 
bear every influence which may establish in the 
inmates the will to lead a good and useful life 
on release, and fit them to do so by the fullest 


1. Ibid. p. 59 

2. Ibid. p. 60 







74 


possible development of their character, capacities, 
and sense of personal responsibility• 

Methods of training may vary as between one 
Borstal and another, according to the needs of 
the different types of inmate allocated to them. 

The Borstal system requires that each person be dealt 
with individually. # In so far as it is able to do so it 
recognizes every lad as an individual in his own right and 
treatment as far as possible is adapted to the individual. 
The attempt at individualizing treatment demands personnel 
trained for the task and enthusiastic about the work. T, The 
Borstal system has no merit apart from the Borstal staff. 

It is men and not buildings who will change the hearts of 

1 

misguided lads”. The selection and training of the staff 
is of great importance in the ultimate results of Borstal 
treatment for young adults. 

The Borstals are organized in Houses where about 
fifty boys are kept. This division makes it possible for 
closer individual study, personal training, and leadership* 
Each House has a Housemaster and a House staff. The House 
organizes its own program as it best sees fit and there 
is no standardized program applying to all the houses. 

The training in a Borstal is not compatible with 
close "safe-custody” and it is not uncommon that a fair 
number of boys should abscond. This group is usually less

than twenty per cent of the total Borstal population. The 
boys are deterred from running away for after they are 
rearrested they are punished and suffer delay in the date 
of their final release from Borstal* 

The training consists of an exacting program of a 
strenuous day of work on the land or in the workshop, reg¬ 
ular physical training, and usually an active evening 
devoted to handi-crafts, gymnastics, and recreation. There 
is a quiet hour provided for reading and writing. 

The boys within the Bostals are taught the fundamentals 
of good craftsmanship and hard work. The work may consist 
of maintenance duties, vocational training, in one of the 
eleven trades, labouring work in the workshops or on the 
farms * 

There is an educational program which attempts to 
continue the education of the inmates. In planning ed¬ 
ucation, less emphasis is placed on formal and academic 
work than on general and cultural knowledge such as art, 
music, hobby work, dismission groups, etc. 

An attempt is made to provide adequate facilities for 
spare time for all boys in the Borstals. . Tnis involves 
the participation in the activity of the surrounding com¬ 
munity as well as inviting the community to participate 
in Borstal activities. Each institution has a library, 
indoor and outdoor games, its own clubs and camps* 

Provision is made for religious instruction with a

resident Chaplain of the Church of England in attendance* 
Ministers and priests of other churches provide religious 
instruction for the hoys of other denominations. 

All the boys have the opportunity to go hone on leave 
for a period of five days, during their training. This 
helps a boy in re-establishing contact with hiw family and 
friends* 

The release of an individual from a Borstal is given 
great care and consideration. The boy's progress in the 
system is observed and recorded so that if he fails he 
may be reclassified at any time and sent to another Bor¬ 
stal. After what is felt to be an appropriate period of 
time, each boy is considered by the institution board pre¬ 
sided over J>y its governor, and the case is submitted to 
the Board of Visitors if found eligible for release. Upon 
reviewing the case, the Board makes recommendations to 
the Prison Commissioners for release under supervision* 

Upon release from a Borstal a boy is placed under the 
care of the central After-Care Association. This part of 
the training has been described as of equal importance 
to the first part of institutional training. The Assoe- 
iaton seeks to find each boy employment, helps him with 
regard to lodgings and outfits, and arranges generally 
through its local agents, who are usually the probation 
officers for superivison, assistance and advice. The 
Association keeps in touch with the family and the boy

during the training period. After release, the Assoc¬ 
iation assumes full charge of the period of supervision. 

It is felt that without the close supervision there would 
be many more failures than there are, and hence great 
importance is placed on this aspect of the training. 

Occasionally a boy fails to comply with the conditions 
of his release, and in such cases the Association notifies 
the Prison Commissioners. The Commissioners consider the 
possibilities for recall. If the boy is recalled he may 
be committed to the Kecall Center for a period up to six 
months, here the program consists of firm discipline, hard 
work, and strict routine, in cases where the boy con¬ 
tinues his behavior of breaking the law the boy is commit¬ 
ted to a Prison. 

B. The Approved Schools 

The Borstal institutions are used for boys between 
the ages of 16 - 21. Where long term institutional treat¬ 
ment is required for children under the age of 17 they 
may be sent to the Approved Schools. These schools are 
the direct descendants of the older industrial schools 
and reformatories. Many of them are managed by voluntary 
bodies and local authorities, but they are all supported 
financially by the state. 

The 149 Approved Schools in England and Wales are 
classified on the basis of the age of the children they 
can receive. Boys under thirteen are admitted to junior

schools; those under fifteen are admitted to the inter¬ 
mediate schools and the senior schools admit boys over 
15, but under 17. Besides this classification according 
to age, the Approved Schools are also classified accord¬ 
ing to tne religious persuasion of the children committed, 
Protestant, Roman Catnolic, or Jewish. 

In recent years the schools have been built around 
a cottage system where children are grouped in cottages 
that are structurally separate. At the different age 
levels there are different provisions made for education, 
with the juniors receiving primary academic instruction 
and the intermediate and senior boys receiving more tech¬ 
nical and industrial training. 

Legally, the court has the power to commit a child 
to any school in the appropriate age group if there is a 
vacancy. This is seldom done and the Home Office usually 
suggests the suitable school, to which the court, upon 
approving the suggestion, sends the child. 

The realization that a delinquent child should be 
sent to a school suited to his needs is of great importance. 
Before children can be sent to one of the schools they 
are classified with care at one of the classification cen¬ 
ters. At these centers the children are observed by a 
skilled staff who make recommendations as to the school 
to which a particular child should be sent. 

The child 1 s length of stay at an Approved School is

not decided by the court. The length of the period of 
confinement depends on his behavior and progress and fre¬ 
quently upon the suitability of the home to which he shall 
be returning after discharge. The school authorities 
usually set the date when the child will leave the school, 
although the Home Secretary can intervene in this matter. 

The length of time spent at an Approved School is between 
two to three years, the latter being the maximum period 
of detention. In special short term schools the children 
cannot be detained for a longer period than nine months. 

The Approved Schools offer a variety of vocational 
training facilities for the older boys. There are special 
farm schools; training in carpentry, metalwork, and machine 
production is provided in some schools. There are also 
nautical schools for boys as well as special hostels 
attached from which older children may go out to daily work 
in the community. This diversity of training provided 
by different schools enables the Home Office to send a 
child to the place where his needs can best be met. 

Upon release from an Approved School there follows 
a period of close superivison under an after-care organ¬ 
ization which provides a specially appointed welfare officer 
to supervise the child. If no welfare officer is avail¬ 
able, the local probation officer usually undertakes the 
task of supervising the child that has been discharged 
from an Approved School.

results or .borstal training 

According to Healy ana Alper, "no thoroughgoing, 

scientifically oriented study or the after results of 

1 

.borstal treatment has ever been made". The results that 
are available merely indicate the percentage or youths 
reconvicted after their release rrom the borstal institu¬ 
tions* There has been no study undertaken of individuals 
released from .borstals over an extended period or time which 
would compare favourable witn the rollow-up studies made 
by the Gleucks. it is only an intensive roliow-up study 
over a long period of time which would indicate how many 
youths receiving .borstal training do become good and use¬ 
ful citizens or society, un the basis of the number of 
reconvictions of youth released rrom .borstals, results 
tend to indicate that the treatment is more successful 
than is the case of institutional treatment in the united 
States. However, these results give no indication of the 
kind of adjustment that the offender achieved after his 
release from the institution. The possibility also exists 
that a certain number of the young offenders may have com¬ 
mitted further delinquencies but were not arrested again. 

The following table indicates the number of reconvict¬ 
ions of boys released from Borstal institutions during the 

2 

years 1942 to 1946 :

The above 

results 

show that 

approximately 50 per 

cent 


of the boys receiving Borstal training are not reconvicted. 
If those that are reconvicted once only are added to this, 
over 70 per cent of the boys do not revert to a life of 
crime within the specified period of time. Compared to 
the 65 to 100 per cent failure of the institutions of the 
United States to rehabilitate youthful offenders, the res¬ 
ults of the Borstal system are impressive. As stated pre¬ 
viously, a long-term study of the boys released from Bor¬ 
stals may change the above figures significantly. 

There are several features of the Borstal system which 
may account for the statistically higher degree of success 
of this form of training than is found in institutions in 
other countries. The Borstal institutions are small in 
size. This makes for the possibility of providing a greater 
degree of individual treatment. Each boy can be considered 
on the basis of his needs. The small institutions can vary 
their program and the boys may be sent to the institutions 
where their needs can best be met. Large institutions on

the other hand are handicapped in their attempt to indiv¬ 
idualize treatment. Mass custody is possible only with 
a certain degree of regimentation. Provisions for the 
individualization of treatment could be made by dividing 
large institutions into different departments in the attempt 
to meet the needs of different boys. Most institutions find 
that it is impossible to do this under existing arrangements. 

The Borstal system in England is especially adapted 
to the country where it originated, in England there is 
a large concentration of delinquent youth within a com¬ 
paratively small geographic area, it is possible to have 
a series of small graded institutions throughout the 
country* Geographic conditions enable a boy from any part 
of the country to receive the benefits of the most approp¬ 
riate institution. One of the major difficulties in est¬ 
ablishing the Borstal system of training in Canada, or a 
system which would duplicate it, is presented by the geo¬ 
graphic factor. 

Another aspect of the Borstal system which makes for 
success in rehabilitating delinquent youth is the practice 
of a long term sentence, it is well-nigh impossible to 
train boys adequately during a short period of time. In 
countries where legislation exists to the effect that the 
court must fix the sentence of all offenders, it is talikely 
that the same results could be obtained. Legislation pro¬ 
viding for a modified form of an indeterminate sentence is

a necessity in any attempt to introduce the principles 
underlying the Borstal system into present day institutions 

The classification system that is used is of great 
importance as it attempts to fit the boy into the insti¬ 
tution best suited to his needs. The classification system 
depends however, on the availability of a diversity of 
institutions to which boys can be sent. 

The intensive work done by the After-care Association 
must be given credit for assisting many juvenile offenders 
in re-establishing themselves in society. Any attempt to 
establish a Borstal system of training in other countries 
would have to seriously consider the development of some 
form of follow up supervision, in England the work of the 
Association is considered of equal importance to the train¬ 
ing that the Borstal institutions provide. 

The Borstal system which has evolved in England over 
the last forty-three years is one of the best known methods 
for treating youthful offenders. Where other institutional 
methods have failed to achieve success in reducing rec¬ 
idivism, the Borstal system of training has been successful 
Although many of the underlying principles of the Borstal 
system apply to youth in all countries,it is doubtful if 
the; system could be introduced in a country such as Canada 
without extensive modification and adaptation.

C. The California Program 
for Treating Young; Offenders 

The adoption of the Youth Authority Act by Calif¬ 
ornia in 1941 provided for important innovations in the 
treatment of young offenders between the ages of 16 and 
21. This Act was modelled on the Youth Correction Author¬ 
ity Act drafted by the American Law Institute as a result 
of action taken on a report by the Delinquency Committee 
of the Community Service Society. 

The Act removed from the judges the power to pre¬ 
scribe treatment in state institutions under the 
auspices of the Youth Authority. This power was placed 
in the hands of an administrative agency charged with 
the responsibility for treatment of young offenders. 

The Act was originally designed to meet the needs of the 
older adolescent group, although later changes extended 
its jurisdiction to offenders up to the age of 21. 

For male offenders between the ages of 16 and 21, the 
Youth Authority conducts four forestry camps. The Youth 
Authority has complete responsibility for a young man under 
its care from the time of commitment to the time of final 
discharge. This makes for the possibility of having an 
integrated program of diagnosis, institutional treatment, 
and parole. 

The camps provided for the young offenders are small 
in size, making for the possibility of a good classification

program ana of a greater degree of individualization of 
treatment than can be found in large institutions. Each 
camp has a capacity for housing from fifty to seventy boys. 

It provides educational and vocational facilities. Vocational 
opportunities are made available through work camps, and 
academic instruction is provided by holding classes two 
nights a week. 

The camps run by the Authority have no standardized 
program. During the day the campers are for the most part 
out in the forest, stringing telephone line for the forestry 
service, making fire breaks, and working on other similar 
worthwhile tasks. 

The camp is administered by a superintendent and a 
staff of supervisors. To insure itself against what is 
known as the "institutional freeze", there is frequent 
interchange of superintendents and the personnel of the 
camps through transfer and promotion. 

At the camp the supervisors work with the young men. 

They participate with the young offenders in their rec¬ 
reational activities as well as at mealtime, when all dine 
together. If necessity demands it, the supervisors can be 
firm with the youngsters, but although they attempt to keep 
watch over the group, they do not regiment the individuals 
at the camp in the interests of custody. The camps are 
minimum security institutions and all work is done in an 
atmosphere of relaxed custodial supervision.

At the camps, there is no psychiatric guidance or 
treatment based on an up-to-date knowledge of cause and 
effect in human behavior. The treatment is mainly der¬ 
ived from a program which places emphasis on voluntary ad¬ 
justment to the situation. The power of human relation¬ 
ships to aid the offender is used by the staff in assist¬ 
ing the offender to adjust to the situation rather than 
conform through fear to a set of rules that is character¬ 
istic of mass custody institutions. The delinquent is 
often surprised to find that the atmospheie of the camp is 
not one of retaliation and punishment. 

The camps are financed by the State Forestry Division. 
The funds expended on the Forestry Camps would be spent 
in the interest of conservation whether or not the camps 
were in existence. The forestry personnel find the camps 
a relatively economical, inexpensive way to get work done, 
and at the same time provide for the rehabilitation of 
youthful offenders. 

Under the treatment program, of the Youth Authority, 
statistics indicate a higher degree of success with young 
offenders than is found in the mass custody institutions 
of New York State. Estimating success on the basis of the 
number of individuals violating their parole, of the 1,298 
young male offenders released on parole from California 
institutions dealing with the 16 to 21 age group, 30 per 
cent violated their parole. Comparable figures for the

State of New York indicate that of 823 young offenders 
released on parole from Coxsackie and Elmira in 1948, 

1 

48 per cent were returned that year as parole violators . 

The setting up of the Youth Correction Authority in 
California represents a significant development as it 
takes from the judges of the courts the power to prescribe 
treatment for the young offender. This abrogation of the 
court’s power has been recommended by various authorities 
over a period of years, mainly for two reasons. In most 
instances, the judges of the juvenile and criminal courts 
are not trained adequately to prescribe a wise course of 
treatment for a youthful offender. Through the establish- 
ment of a group of trained workers, diagnostic, institutional, 
and parole or probation services can be prescribed and 
integrated for each individual offender. 

D. The Establishment of a 
Reception Center In New York 
The Reception Center at the Elmira Reformatory in New 
York was established in 1945. At the center an attempt is 
made to study delinquent youths and to determine the causes 
of their behavior as well as make recommendations for treat¬ 
ment. it attempts to classify and group certain types of 
offenders on the basis of a thorough knowledge of the 
offender. After classification at the Center, the youths 
are sent to institutions which can provide the special form 
of treatment recommended for them.

The procedure at the Center is divided into three 
phases - orientation, psychological testing and study 
observation. Through this procedure the Reception Center 
attempts to accomplish four things basically. These are: 

(1) to study all the significant factors in each case; (2) 
to recommend the institution to which the inmate should be 
sent; (3) to recommend a suggested treatment program; and 
(4) to start the boy thinking straight and to get him in 

proper frame of mind to take advantage of opportunities 

1 

offered in the transfer institutions. 

The greatest obstacle facing the Reception Center 
in its attempt to accomplish the above objectives is the 
lack of specialized institutions making provisions for 
special training of youth. Most of the institutions avail¬ 
able to the Center are general in character. Elmira and 
Coxsackie, two of the available institutions, receive 75 
per cent of the 16 to 21 year-old committed offenders. 

Both institutions are large and frequently overcrowded* 
Because of their size there is a necessary degree of custod¬ 
ial regimentation* 

The Reception Center, using these facilities, is hamp¬ 
ered in prescribing a form of treatment which would meet the 
needs of each individual. An attempt is made to make the 
population of these institutions as homogeneous as possible, 

1. Tappan, P. W., op. cit., p. 484. 




'X 






o h IS .? 




... .’ 1 ' .t ’

although conditions of overcrowding make this aspect of 
the Center’s work difficult. 

The personnel of the Reception Center consist of a 
psychiatrist, psychologist, academic and social adjustment 
instructors, vocational instructors, chaplain, physician, 
social worker, parole officer, and a physical education 
instructor. Each member of the staff makes an appraisal 
of every individual offender and all reports are discussed 
by the staff before an individual is recommended for treat¬ 
ment. The Center has the power to prescribe the treatment 
for an individual, having taken this aspect of jurisdiction 
from the judges. 

The Center, however, cannot get far ahead of the 
institutions it serves. The establishment of a Center 
without a diversified system of treatment facilities, has 
been questioned although it does define clearly what types 
of treatment facilities are needed. The Center represents 
a significant advance in the attempt to adapt treatment for 
young offenders to the causes of their delinquency and 
the needs of their personalities. 

This brief discussion of some of the recent develop¬ 
ments in institutionalization indicates that improvements 
made in institutional programs and classification procedures, 
have tended to produce a higher degree of success in rehab¬ 
ilitating delinquent youth than is the case with the older, 
but less developed, methods. The preceding chapter pointed

out the limitations of many of the existing institutions 
used for re-training offenders. This chapter suggests that 
if a good system of classification is adopted, and a variety 
of institutional training facilities developed, greater 
success is attained in the re-training and re-educating of 
the young offender. 








THE TREATMENT OF JUVENILE DELINQUENTS 


IN VARIOUS CANADIAN PROVINCES 







92 


THE TREATMENT OF JUVENILE DELINQUENTS 

IN VARIOUS CANADIAN PROVINCES 


The Juvenile Delinquents Act of 1929 

The Juvenile Delinquents Act of 1929 is the fundamental 
statute making provision for the handling and the disposition 
of juvenile delinquents. Within the meaning of the Act, 

"juvenile delinquent" refers to "any child who violates any 
provision of the Criminal code, or of any Dominion or Prov¬ 
incial statute, or of any by-law or ordinance of any mun¬ 
icipality, who is guilty of sexual immorality or any sim¬ 
ilar vice, or who is by reason of any other act to be com¬ 
mitted to an industrial school or juvenile reformatory under 

1 

the provisions of any Dominion or Provincial statute" • 

The Act requires that all juvenile delinquents must be 
brought before the juvenile court for trial, and no child 
under the age of fourteen years can be sent to the criminal 
court. Where a child is brought before the criminal court, 
and the justice discovers that the child is under the age 
of sixteen, he snail direct that the individual be taken to 
the juvenile court, in british Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, 

1. Statutes of Canada, 1929,p. 204* 















95 


and Quebec, the jurisdiction of the juvenile court extends 
to all boys and girls, actually or apparently under the age 
of eighteen. 

The trials of all children brought before the juvenile 
court are to take place without publicity. They are to be 
separate and apart from the trials of other accused persons. 
While awaiting trial no child can be detained in a gaol or 
place where adults are imprisoned or awaiting trial. Child¬ 
ren are to be detained only in a detention home or a shelter 
that is used exclusively for delinquents. 

m the case of a child adjudged to be a juvenile del¬ 
inquent under the provisions of the Act, the court may take 
one or more courses of action. Such action is to be carried 
out after the court has examined the circumstances of the 
case and feels that the action taken is in the best interests 
of the child. The possible courses of action provided under 
the Act are as follows: 

(a) suspend final disposition; 

(b) adjourn the hearing or disposition of the case 
from time to time for any definite or indefinite 
period; 

(c) impose a fine not exceeding twenty-five dollars 
which may be paid in periodical amounts or 
otherwise; 

(d) commit the child to the care or custody of a 
probation officer or any other suitable person; 

(e) allow the cnila to remain in its home, subject 
to the visitation of a probation officer, such 
child to report to the court or to the probation 
officer as often as may be required; 

(f) cause the child to be placed in a suitable fam¬ 
ily home or foster home, subject to the friendly 
supervision of a probation officer and further 
order of the court;

(g) impose upon the delinquent such further or other 
conditions as may be deemed advisable; 

(h) commit the child to the charge of any children’s 
aid society, duly organized under an Act of the 
legislature of the Province and approved by the 
Lieutenant-Governor in Council, or, in any munic¬ 
ipality in which there is no children’a aid soc¬ 
iety, to the charge of the superintendent, if 
one there be; 

(i) commit the child to an industrial school duly 
approved by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. 1 


Under Section 25 of the Act, it is "unlawful to commit 

a juvenile delinquent apparently under the age of twelve 

years to any industrial school, unless and until an attempt 

has been made to reform such a child in its own home, or in 

a foster home, or in charge of a children’s aid society, or 

of a superintendent, and unless the court finds that the 

best interests of the child and the welfare of the community 

2 

require such commitment” • When a juvenile delinquent is 

convicted and sentenced he shall not be incarcerated in any 

3 

penitentiary or institution where adults are imprisoned • 

The Juvenile Delinquents Act is an "enabling” statute, 
and "shall be liberally construed to the end that its 
purpose may be carried out, to wit: 

That the care and custody and discipline of a 
juvenile delinquent shall approximate as nearly as 
may be that which should be given by its parents, 
and that as far as practicable, every juvenile del¬ 
inquent shall be treated not as a criminal, but as 
a misdirected and misguided child, and one needing 
aid, encouragement, help and assistance," 4

The Administration of the Juvenile 

Delinquents Act in Canada 

The compromise arrangements between the provincial 
and federal authorities in the administration of the 
Juvenile Delinquents Act in Canada has led to an uneven 
development of juvenile delinquency treatment services 
across the Dominion. Most provinces put the Act into 
force in one of the two ways possible, and developed their 
treatment facilities independently of developments in 
sister provinces. There was no sincere attempt made to 
co-ordinate the treatment provisions for delinquents in 
order to make them uniform across Canada. Jn those 
provinces where the Federal Act has not been put into 
force, arrangements to secure its benefits have been made 
by specific cities, towns or municipalities. This has led 
to the inevitable result of an uneven development of spec¬ 
ial services for juvenile delinquents within provinces 
themselves. 

The situation in respect to the administration of the 
Juvenile Delinquents Act in Canada was reviewed by the Can¬ 
adian Welfare Council in 1936 and a brief was submitted to 
the Royal Commission investigating the Canadian penal system 
at that time* In referring to the administration of the 
Act in each province the Council stated: 

In Quebec, special legislation embodied in 

Revised Statutes of 1925 established, for the City 









96 


of Montreal, a court of record called the Juvenile 
Delinquents Court, the jurisdiction of which might he 
extended to any territory on the Island of Montreal, 
when satisfactory arrangements had been concluded with 
the municipalities concerned for the establishment and 
maintenance of the Court and of detention homes and 
other facilities, as defined in the Juvenile Delinquents 
Act of Canada. The judge was to be appointed and his 
salary payable by the Province and the Courts, so 
constituted, to have the powers conferred on them by 
competent jurisdiction, presumably by the Juvenile 
Delinquents Act* 

Thus, the benefit or privileges of a Juvenile 
Court under present Quebec legislation, in terms 
of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, is only available, 
under prescribed conditions, to any municipality on 
the Island of Montreal* 


In Nova Scotia, the Province enacted special 
legislation providing for the establishment of Juv¬ 
enile Courts within defined limits. Under this leg¬ 
islation Juvenile Courts have been set up in the City 
of Halifax and the Counties of Pictou, Cape Breton, 
Hants, King’s and colchester. 


In the Province of New Brunswick there are no 
legislative enactments, actually in force, providing 
for the establishment of Juvenile Courts. There is 
but one Juvenile Court of a sort in existence in the 
City of Moncton where, utilizing section 43 of the 
Juvenile Delinquents Act, provision was made for 
hearings under the Juvenile Delinquents Act of Can¬ 
ada by a Magistrate of the Moncton Police Court, 
by special proclamation of December, 1939* 


Where there is no Provincial enactment in Prince 
Bdward Island, the Juvenile Delinquents Act has been 
pro'claimed by Federal proclamation, under Section 43, 
in both unarlottetown and Summerside, while the 
Lieutenant-Governor may appoint commissioners to hear 
and determine complaints against juvenile offenders 
apparently under the age of eighteen years, under the 
Children’s Protection Act. 


In British Columbia, a Provincial measure, enacted 
first in 1918, carries practically the same clause as 
the Ontario measure and provides for the establishment 
and proclamation of Courts throughout the Province as 
may be decided. A special committee, appointed by the

Attorney General of the Province, has recently 
made submissions to the Provincial Government of 
British Columbia on the whole system and set-up 
of Juvenile Courts in that Province, 


In Manitoba, a provincial system of Juvenile 
Courts is set up under relevant sections of the Child 
WelfareAct. Under this legislation Juvenile Courts 
covering the entire area of the Province have been 
set up for the Winnipeg area, Brandon and the east¬ 
ern judicial district, Dauphin and the northern 
judicial district, while the probation system in 
connection with these Courts is provincial, with 
a chief Probation Officer, provincially appointed, 
supervising local services. 


In Alberta, a provincial enactment provided 
for the naming of Commissioners, appointed under 
the Children’s Protection Act of the Province, 
as Judges of the Juvenile Court for any place to 
which they were appointed, while Police Magistrates 
and District and Supreme Court Judges were to be 
ex officio Juvenile Court Judges in their respective 
districts, unless they were unwilling so to act. 
Where there was no Commissioner, no other person 
might act, except by his written request, or on 
the request of the Attorney-General, or the Super¬ 
intendent of Neglected Children for the Province, 
Upon the request of the latter, any Justice of 
the Peace in the Province might also act tinder this 
special legislation. 


In Saskatchewan, the enactments governing 
Juvenile Courts are contained in the Child Welfare 
Act, by which the Lieutenant-Governor in Council 
may appoint special magistrates to act as Juvenile 
Court Judges, with salaries presumably paid by the 
Province. One Juvenile Court Judge has been so 
appointed, with a Court in Regina bjrfc empowered to 
hold sessions of such a Court in any locality in 
the Province, or, in any case, on request of the 
Superintendent of Child Welfare. 


The Province of Ontario enacted a provincial 
measure (R.S.O. 1927, Chapter 35) providing for the 
establishment of a Juvenile Court in every city, 
town and county in which the Federal Act had been 
or might be proclaimed. The development of such 
Courts within Ontario under this legislation has 
been uneven, however, and at the present time such 




98 


Courts exist in eighteen cities, towns, counties 
or districts, covering fifty-two per cent of the 
population, therefore leaving over forty-seven per 
cent of the population, and by far the greater 
geographical area of the Province, without the 
benefits of this special legislation of service. 
Juvenile Courts do exist, however, in six of the 
largest cities in the Province« 1 


Since the report of the Canadian Welfare Council, 
improvements have been made in the provisions for handling 
and treating the juvenile delinquent in various provinces 
in Canada. There has been an attempt made to extend the 
services of the juvenile court system to areas needing it; 
additional provisions have been made for probation services 
attempts have been made to incorporate or develop nev^ meth¬ 
ods in institutionalization. This development varies from 
province to province and can best be described as uneven. 

The following account of the treatment services in 
eight Canadian provinces will bring to light some of the 
new legislative provisions that have been made as well as 
recent developments in treatment practices. The treatment 
services in Alberta will be described in detail in the 
next chapter. No attempt will be made to discuss the pro¬ 
visions made for treating delinquents in Newfoundland, Can¬ 
ada’s newest province.

.British Columbia 

In British Columbia, separate provision for the detent¬ 
ion and training of juvenile delinquents began in 1890, 
when a juvenile reformatory for boys was established at 
Victoria, virtually an annex to one of the provincial 
jails* In 1905, this was replaced by the "Provincial 
Industrial School and Boys 1 Home" located at Point Grey, 
near Vancouver. In 1921, the school was moved to its 

present site at Port Coquitlam, close to the Essondale 
1 

mental hospital . 

The juvenile court system dates from 1910, when the 
province adopted the necessary legislation to authorize 
the formation of juvenile courts, in conformity with the 
provisions of the Dominion Juvenile Delinquents Act. 

Juvenile courts were established in Vancouver in the same 
year, and in victoria soon after. Other municipalities 
gradually established juvenile courts or made provisions 
for the handling of juvenile delinquents. The obligation 
of providing the necessary physical facilities, such as 
detention homes, and paying the salaries of the probation 
officers and personnel associated with the courts, was 
placed upon the municipalities within which the new courts 
were given jurisdiction. The juvenile court judges were 
authorized to appoint the necessary probation officers. 

In the small towns and the sparsely settled areas of 
the Province it was difficult to implement the existing

legislation regarding juvenile courts. Many areas made 
no provisions for probation services for juvenile delinquents* 
In a report presented to the Department of the Attorney- 
General on June 25,1943, Magistrate H. S. Wood of Van¬ 
couver, stated, "that a programme of probation should greatly 
reduce committals to Industrial Schools and Penal Instit¬ 
utions...We found that in most places there was no real 
programme of probation, and no probation officers, and in 
some places the word was new to those concerned. The 
Magistrates generally were loath to commit to institutions, 

but very often owing to lack of other remedy they felt 

1 

that there was no alternative" • 

In 1936, an Advisory Committee on luvenile Delinquency 
recommended to the government that the province should take 
over the full responsibility for the operation of juvenile 
courts and the probation services. This would tend towards 
greater uniformity as the administrative and financial res¬ 
ponsibilities would be taken from the control of separate 
municipalities. The Committee also proposed the appoint¬ 
ment of a senior juvenile court judge to be assisted by a 
small number of deputy judges presiding over courts in dif¬ 
ferent areas. This would lead to an extension of a uniform 
court service to areas which were not served and at the 
same time were too small to operate their own juvenile courts. 


1. Ibid. p. 164

No action had been taken on the recommendations by 1949• 

The institutional services for juvenile delinquents 

were described in 1944 by Cassidy to be "far from satis- 
1 

factory" • "The Boys’ Industrial School should be moved 

from Port Coquitlam to a more desirable site, where it 

2 

would not be situated next door to a mental hospital" . 

An attempt to provide treatment for young offenders was 
made with the establishment of an open-type Borstal 
institution at New Haven in the late thirties. This 
institution was closed in 1942, but has been re-opened 
since. 

In 1948, the Probation Act was passed, placing all 
probation services under the Department of the Attorney- 
General. This Act makes provision for the appointment 
of Probation officers whose duties are to prepare Pre“ 
Sentence Reports for the courts and to take over super¬ 
vision of persons placed on probation. All members of 
the staff appointed by the Department are graduates of a 
School of Social Work and have post-graduate degrees or 
their equivalent. This legislation has led to the extension 
of probation services throughout the province and is in 
line with the recommendations made by the Advisory Committee 
on Juvenile Delinquency in 1936* 

According to the Report of the Social Welfare Branch

the conditions at the Boys’ Industrial School had not 
improved substantially by 1949 and could still be des¬ 
cribed as "far from satisfactory". The Superintendent 
of the School reported that, "the buildings are being used 
to a capacity far beyond normal housing and to the place 
where there is no available desk-space for necessary sten¬ 
ographic help and some senior officials. With the develop¬ 
ment of the Mental Hospital and the Home for the Aged, 
our buildings and grounds have gradually become surrounded, 
it is becoming more obvious that many of our boys require 
custodial care and training in an area providing maximum 
security. This condition is accentuated by the increasing 
number of A.W.O.L* s, who, upon return, must of necessity 
be placed in the open dormitory from which they ran away. 

Unfortunately, many of them are responsible for additional 

1 

delinquencies while A.W.O.L." . 

Although the services of the Child Guidance Clinic 
are available to the School, because or the many appoint¬ 
ments, less than 25 per cent of the boys in the School can 
benefit from them. In addition, inadequacies on the staff 
make it impossible for the School to follow the recommend¬ 
ations made by the Clinic in many of the cases. 

In his report the Superintendent of the industrial 
School writes, "Although, as a school, we are endeavoring

Branch of tne Department of Health and Yfelfare, March 31,

to keep abreast of new developments in the treatment and 
training of our lads, we are aware that under the present 
circumstances a certain amount of regimentation has, of 
necessity, crept in. We do, however, realize that most 
delinquent children are in need of specialized care. Their 
futures are in jeopardy just as much as those who are 
physically ill or handicapped, and while the treatment is 
vastly different, nevertheless it is just as important. 
Success means the return to normal living and good citizen¬ 
ship, while failure may result in a life of crime with all 

1 

its attendant misery and expense” . This keen awareness 
of the limitations and deficiencies of the treatment pro¬ 
vided in the Industrial School suggests that improvements 
in the institutionalization of delinquent in British Col¬ 
umbia are not far off. Plans for a new boys’ shhool, which 

has been functionally designed as a treatment center, have 

2 

been formulated by the Social Welfare Branch . 

British Columbia has attempted to provide facilities 
for treating young offenders between the ages of 16 and 
23. An open-type Borstal Institution is operated under 
the Department of the Attorney-General at New Haven. At 
the present time, when a young offender is referred to the 
Probation branch of the Department and appears to be un¬ 
suitable for treatment by probation, he is remanded to the

Provincial Gaol, where a Clinic team of a psychiatrist and a 
psychologist interview him. The team assesses the suitability 
of the candidate for training in an open institution such as 
New Haven. If he is considered suitable from the standpoint of 
the possibility for reformation, and a sufficiently good sec¬ 
urity risk for an institution of the open type, recommendation 
is made accordingly. The sentences to the institution are on 
an indeterminate basis, and all offenders are released on par¬ 
ole. While on parole supervision is attempted by the Borstal 
Association of the Probation branch, depending on the area 
where the inmate is going to reside. 

In February, 1950, the Attorney-General’s Department 
opened a new treatment unit for young offenders in a sep¬ 
arate building within the ground of the Provincial Oakalla 
Prison Farm. This unit is to be used for young offenders 
in the age group between sixteen and twenty-three. The 
unit is designed for greater security but will attempt to 
offer facilities for treatment similar to those at New 
Haven. Sentences to this unit of the institution will be 
on a definite basis and release will be by expiration of 
the sentence. The new unit, although legally a part of 
the Provincial Gaol is to be separately administered and 
will have its own staff. It is proposed that a treatment 

approach should be used with the inmates within the unit 

1 

at Oakalla, rather than that of pure custody .

This brief survey of the provisions made by the 
province of British Columbia for the treatment of juvenile 
delinquents and young offenders indicates that there are 
attempts made to improve the existing facilities and also 
to establish more progressive and adequate ones. To 
attempt a critical evaluation of the methods used in 
British Columbia would require an intensive long term study 
of the outcomes of the delinquents receiving the different 
possible forms of treatment. Although such an evaluation 
is beyond the scope of this thesis, it can be predicted 
that the methods used in British Columbia are at least rel¬ 
atively as successful as amilar methods are in other parts 
of the country. 


Saskatchewan 

In Saskatchewan, the treatment of juvenile delinquents 
is organized under several government agencies. Up to the 
beginning of 1944 there was a poor integration of the wel¬ 
fare services. The delinquency services were divided between 
the Department of Public Works which looked after the oper¬ 
ation of the jails, the Department of Education, which had 
major responsibility for the operation of the Boy’s Indus¬ 
trial School, and the Bureau of Child Protection, which gave 

some supervision of the Boys’ Industrial School and of the 

1 

juvenile probation system .

In a brief prepared by the Community Council of Saska¬ 
toon, and submitted to the provincial government in March, 
1942, serious sriticisms were directed at the administration 
of the dhild welfare and juvenile delinquency services. 

Among the twenty specific complaints were lack of personnel 
standards for child protection workers engaged by the prov¬ 
incial government and the children’s aid societies, and the 
unnecessary scattering of the responsibility for juvenile 
delinquency services among several government agencies. 

From within the province, frequent criticism was made reg¬ 
arding the unenlightened administration of the Boys’ Indus¬ 
trial School and the incompetent and inadequate juvenile 
probation work done by the children’s aid society officials 
and the police. 

Under the provisions of the Child Welfare Act, the 
Lieutenant-Governor in Council could appoint special mag¬ 
istrates to act as juvenile court judges. At the time of 
the investigation of the Canadian penal system by the Royal 
Commission one judge of the juvenile court had been appointed, 
with the power to hold court sessions any place throughout 
the province. 

The growing public criticism of the adult and juvenile 
delinquency services led to the setting up of a Royal Com¬ 
mission in 1946, headed by Dr. S. R. haycock, for the purpose

of investigating the Saskatchewan penal system. This Com¬ 
mission made an investigation into the training school fac¬ 
ilities available for juvenile delinquents. The Commission 
reported that the provisions for the treatment of the adult 
offender in the province were far from satisfactory, but 
that for the child offender they were worse. 

The Commission investigated the Industrial School for 
Boys in Regina where delinquent boys up to the age of sixteen 
years had been committed. The investigation revealed that 
at times boys placed in the School were not delinquent, but 
were out of the control of their parents. This produced a 
situation where several children in little need of institut¬ 
ional training lived in intimate association with lads who 
were delinquent to a lesser or greater degree. Classifica¬ 
tion on the basis of age was poor and it was not uncommon 
for young boys to be living with older and quite mature adol¬ 
escents. The Commission felt that only those boys who had 
been committed to the Industrial School by the juvenile 
courts should be admitted to the institution. 

The structure of the Industrial School for Boys was 
an unattractive red brick building erected in 1882 for the 
purpose of serving as an Indian residential school. It 
was located a short distance from Regina. The interior of 
the building was unattractive and depressing. The Commis¬ 
sioners wrote: "Its walls, and ceilings, its floors and 

1 

stairways show the inevitable signs of its sixty-four years".

Many of the conditions in the school were not conducive 
to the welfare of the children. Many of the facilities 
were "cramped". The rooms were badly furnished, the dorm¬ 
itories were unattractive, the dining-room was in need of 
new chairs, the toilet and washrooms were unattractive and 
exposed, providing no privacy for the boys. The Commission¬ 
ers summed up the conditions of the Boys 1 Industrial School 
in the following words: "The Boys 1 Industrial School brings 

to mind some of the schools described by Charles Dickens. 

1 

It belongs to another and less enlightened day". 

In its recommendations the Commission emphasized the 
need for duly trained and qualified personnel for any pro¬ 
gram of retraining delinquent youth. Other recommendations 
were: a classification program set up for each school; prov¬ 
isions for adequate educational training, with training 
planned so as to suit the abilities, interests, and needs 
of the pupils; special consideration should be taken of a 
child 1 s ability to learn, and assistance provided to slow- 
learning children; an extension of the manual pre-vocational 
training; a well-planned program of recreation; as well as 
such matters as mail and visits, food and methods of serving 
it, sanitation, health, discipline, chaplain services, dis¬ 
charge and after-care. These recommendations could apply to 
many of Canada 1 s institutions for juvenile delinquents a

The Commission recommended the establishment of a 
new cottage-type institution on a site carefully chosen, 
preferably parkland or in an environment of natural beauty# 
It should not be too far from a large urban center, for 
then there would be additional difficulty in obtaining 
professional consultants whenever required. 

Following the recommendations of the Commission, the 
correctional institutions were taken out of the jurisdiction 
of the Department of the Attorney-General and placed under 
the Department of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation. Under 
this Department a Director of Corrections was appointed 
to supervise the jails and the Boys’ Industrial School. 

In 1947, the structure housing the Boy’s industrial 
School was destroyed by fire and the School was moved to 
temporary quarters in an H-type hut, one mile from the old 
school site. Approximately eighteen months after the fire, 
a new school was opened in the City of Regina. The School, 
situated in Regina, made it possible for the boys within 
the School, to receive the benefits of additional technical 
training; it provided them with easy access to the museum 
and the library; it provided for the availability of prof¬ 
essional services; and enabled the boys to have access to 
the city’s recreational facilities. The new location of 
the School represents an interesting development and a 
change from the widely accepted view that the best place 
for a correctional institution is outside the city limits,

usually in the country* 

The new school is a one-storey, light colored brick 
building containing five dormitories, making it as sim¬ 
ilar as possible to a cottage-type structure. Each dorm¬ 
itory has its own washroom and shower facilities as well 
as a fireplace. There is, in addition, a complete laundry 
in the school, a four-bed hospital, dispensary, six rooms 
for detention purposes, staff and administrative rooms, 
modern equipped kitchen, dining room, workshop and two 
classrooms. The building incorporated some of the best 
principles in modern architecture. A large up-to-date 
gymnasium has been provided for the boys. No doors which 
admit individuals to the building are locked at any time. 
The School is a minimum security institution. 

The School day is divided into two parts, each part 
designed to meet the needs of the boys and to provide the 
maximum opportunities for treatment. The personnel consist 
of a staff of eighteen, eight of whom are trained for the 
task of re-educating delinquents. The School uses the 
resources of the Mental Health Clinic for diagnostic work* 
The recommendations for treatment are followed up by the 
Superintendent, who is a professionally trained social 
worker, and the Treatment Supervisor, who is an educational 
psychologist. Within the institution corporal punishment 
is never used and the detention rooms are used only when a 
boy becomes a danger to himself or to some other person.

A Review Board composed of five staff members evaluates 
the progress of a boy and interprets to him his develop¬ 
ment. After a boy has spent a sufficient length of time 
in the Industrial School he is considered for parole. 

Before parole is granted a member of the Department of 
Social Welfare visits the boy’s home and reports on the 
home conditions. The lad, upon being sent home is visited 
by the social worker, onee a month, for a year. If there 
is difficulty found in the home environment, or if the 
boy’s behavior shows little improvement he may be returned 
to the School* 

The above changes have incorporated many of the 
recommendations made by the Royal Commission investigation 
in 1946* It is difficult to ascertain the degree of success 
that the School training can effect as no follow-up studies 
have been made of the boys who have received treatment in 
the new institution. The number of boys in the School over 
the past three years has ranged from thirty to fifty. This 
is a small number to be institutionalized, and the increased 
opportunities for individualization of treatment, with the 
added benefits of qualified personnel,would lead one to 
predict a comparatively high degree of success. 

Another recent development in Saskatchewan’s delinquency 
services involves a limitation set on the power of the 
juvenile court to prescribe treatment in the case of 
a delinquent. If a boy brought before the juvenile court

is found guilty of an offence, a Committee consisting of 
the Director of Corrections, the Director of the Child 
Welfare Branch, and two or three other workers in the 
welfare or correctional field discuss the boy’s condition 
and decide as to what should be done. The Committee can 
use three possible methods for disposition; (1) probation 
in the boy’s home, (2) making the boy a ward of the govern¬ 
ment and placing him in a foster home, or (3) committing 
him to the Boy&’ School for an indeterminate period of time. 

There is no special provision made in Saskatchewan 
for the treatment of the young offender, and all persons 
above the age of sixteen go to the criminal court, 

Manitoba 

In Manitoba, the juvenile courts handle delinquents 
up to the age of eighteen years. The juvenile court system 
is administered and financed almost completely by the prov¬ 
incial government, with but little participation on the 
part of municipalities. In 1944, there were three juvenile 
court districts, each under a juvenile court judge, who 
had the assistance of deputy judges. The courts have 
$heir full-time probation staffs. The wide use of the 
probation system is a characteristic of Manitoba’s method 
for handling delinquents. In describing the delinquency 
services in Manitoba, Cassidy writes: "In Manitoba, 
there is an effective juvenile probation programme covering

the larger part of the province 

On the staff of the juvenile court at Winnipeg, there 
are at the present time three men probation officers and 
two women working in that capacity. The practice followed 
in this court in dealing with a juvenile delinquent in¬ 
volves making a thorough Pre-Sentence investigation into 
the circumstances of the offence and the background of 
the juvenile. This is done before a recommendation is 
made to the juvenile court as to the best disposition of 
the case* Remands are granted for a sufficient length of 
time in order that the probation staffs may get the nec¬ 
essary information about the individual. The information 
is obtained from all sources which raijght lead to relevant 
material on the case. The services of the Ghild Guidance 
Clinic are available for children attending school, and 
the services of the assistant provincial psychiatrist are 
available for those juveniles who have left school. 

The greater number of the juvenile delinquents brought 
before the court are placed on probation to one of the five 
probation officers. Occasionally some other person may 
undertake the supervision of a juvenile delinquent, although 
this practice is followed only in the minor cases. The 
probation officer may, or may not, impose regulations on 

o 

the child during the period of probation.

If a boy is found to be unsatisfactory for probation 

he can be committed to the Manitoba Home for Boys. This 

is one of the few training schools in Canada that has 

1 

achieved a good reputation . 

Ontario 

The Province of Ontario leads her sister provinces 

in the development of adequate training school and pro- 

2 

bation services for its juvenile delinquents . By 1937, 
Ontario had established eighteen juvenile courts, and 
judges for these courts were appointed by the Lieutenant- 
Governor in Council. The juvenile courts utilize pro¬ 
bation and foster home placement in the disposition of 
the delinquents. Welfare agencies, such as the children’s 
aid societies have played an important part in Ontario’s 
attempt to rehabilitate delinquent juveniles. The greatest 
inadequacy of the Ontario system is the lack of a uniform 
juvenile court system throughout the province, and a great 
need for the extension of court services to outlying areas* 

The available services reach approximately half of the 
3 

population . 

In connection with the Ontario provisions for train¬ 
ing schools for delinquent youth, the Training Schools Act

p. 346*

of 1939, provided for the establishment of provincial 

training schools, the purpose of which is to, "Provide 

the boys or girls therein with a mental, moral, physical, 

1 

and vocational education, training and employment". The 
schools, called the "Ontario Training Schools" may be 
established by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council and the 
cost of maintaining the schools is to be paid out of the 
revenues appropriated by the legislature. At the present 
time, Ontario has Training Schools at Bowmanville, Galt 
and Guelph, which are operated under public auspices. Two 
boys Training Schools, located at Toronto and Alfred, 
have been established under the private auspices of the 
Roman Catholic Church. 

The judge of the juvenile court may commit a boy or 
girl to a Training School if he feels that it is exped¬ 
ient to do so on the basis of available knowledge. In 
most instances, a sincere attempt is made to put the 
child on probation or place him in a foster home. When 
such attempts lead to failure and relapse into further 
delinquency, the child is committed to one of the Training 
Schools. 

Upon committal to the Training school a boy becomes 
a ward of the school until the age of eighteen. The Min¬ 
ister of the Department of Keform Institutions, which

administers the Schools, may terminate the length of stay 
of a boy at a School at any time. 

An Advisory board of five members meets at the call 
of the Minister and acts in an advisory capacity to him. 

This board visits and inspects the various training schools 
and investigates the conditions of the boys. During these 
visits the board reviews the progress of each boy and 
considers his improvement morally and scholastically, his 
recreation and work at some occupation, as well as matters 
relating to wardship, care, health, conduct, and discipline. 
The board also designates foster homes for children who 
are about to leave the Training Schools. 

Any commitment to the Training School is indeterminate, 
that is, for an indefinite period of time until the boy 
or girl is eighteen years of age. it is felt that if the 
child has not been trained into desirable habits by that 
age, there is little use of him remaining any longer in 
the Training School. The length of time spent by a boy 
in a Training School depends on the progress he makes at 
the school. 

The Training School program makes an appeal to the 
majority of delinquent boys who are dull normal or close 
to borderline in intelligence, because of the great emphasis 
that is put on handicrafts for at least part of the time. 
This group is definitely non-academic. However, the 
tendency of the judges to commit mentally defective children 



117 


to the Training Schools, rather than placing them in 

institutions for the mentally defective, accounts for a 

high percentage of such children in the Training Schools. 

Of 619 hoys and girls in residence on March 31, 1949, some 

1 

17 per cent were definitely defective mentally . There 
is a widespread need for special institutions for the 
mentally defective adapted to deal with their handicaps 
and use knowledge and techniques to develop such children 
to the utmost of their capacity. Such schools would re¬ 
lieve the responsibility placed upon the Training Schools 
which are not in a position to provide specialized train¬ 
ing and would enable the mentally defective to return to 
his community as a useful citizen. 

The Boy T s Training Schools at Bowmanville and Galt 
attempt the training of many of their staff members. This 
is done in order to improve the quality and morale of the 
staff. 

A recent idea inaugurated in the Schools is the Home 
Contact Plan, whereby Placement Officers visit the homes 
to which the boys are going to return. These visits pre¬ 
pare the home for the return of the boy. After boys are 
returned to their homes or placed in foster homes, they 
receive supervision to help them re-establish themselves 
in their community.

The Ontario Training Schools are used with different 
groups of delinquent boys, and mention should be made of 
the differences that exist between the schools. The 
school at Bowman ville is used for older delinquent boys, 
usually between the ages of fourteen and eighteeen. A 
description of the school program indicates a sincere 
attempt on the part of the administrators to re-train 
and reform delinquent youth. 

The program of the school is three-fold centering 
around house life, school work and recreation. The boy, 
living in a house group, must learn to live with others, 
although he has the opportunity to be alone if he so de¬ 
sires at times. The school work is divided into vocational 
and academic sections and as many boys as possible receive 
formal education. The boys usually attend classes for 
half a day and receive instruction in one of the vocational 
shops during the other half of the day. Boys unable to 
take further educational training because of the lack of 
ability are assigned to one of the vocational work shops 
or maintenance duty full time. The shopwork instruction 
is offered in the following subjects: sheet metal, carpentry, 
motor mechanics, machine shop work, shoe repairing, bartering, 
greenhouse gardening, arts and crafts. Provisions are also 
made for hobby classes. 

In Physical training and recreation there is a co¬ 
ordinated program and instruction is provided in gymnastics,

swimming and life-saving, team games and competitions such 
as track and field. The school program also includes leaders 1 
camps, bugle band engagements, professional entertainment, 
glee clubs and religious services. 

The boy, upon admittance is classed a Junior and has 
his first interview with the Board after four months of 
training. If progress is favorable he is promoted to the 
Intermediate Class for four months. At the end of eight 
months of training the boy has his second interview where¬ 
upon if satisfactory progress is reported he enters the 
Senior Class. After twelve month’s time he is recommended 
for graduation if considered ready. The progress of a 
boy is reviewed by a Staff Review Board which meets weekly. 

If he leaves the School, the Placement Officers and the 
Advisory Board follow up his adjustment until the age of 
eighteen when wardship is terminated. 

The school at Galt offers similar training for boys 
under fourteen years of age. The program is centered around 
academic, residence, and recreational training, although 
the academic aspect is stressed more, and specialized train¬ 
ing is provided for those who are retarded or dull and 
find it difficult to follow usual class room procedure. 

If the boys do not respond to treatment at either 
one of the above schools, they are sent to the Guelph 
Training School for boys which is a special branch of the 
Guelph Reformatory. The boys in this school are usually

those who present distinct disciplinary problems. The 
program consists of education along academic lines, and 
emphasis on learning to work is great. One half of the 
school day is devoted to classes and another half to hort¬ 
iculture and gardening during the summer months. Physical 
training and recreation provide an important part of the 
training and competent training instructors handle this 
aspect of the program. Organized games are stressed in 
the school program and cultural development is encouraged. 

In 1947, Ontario opened a new reformatory at Brampton 
for the training of young male prisoners sixteen to twenty- 
five years of age. These prisoners were specially chosen 
from the Guelph reformatory for intensive courses in academic 
and vocational work. At Brampton, all must take further 
schooling, after assignment to a course is made on the basis 
of aptitude studies. The average length of stay in the 
institution is nine months and training is given in cook¬ 
ery, motor mechanics, machine shop, radio, metal work, 

1 

welding, construction, carpentry, painting and decorating . 

There are private training schools for boys at 
Toronto and Alfred which are operated under the denominat¬ 
ional auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. These schools 
admit boys of the Roman Catholic faith and place a greater 
emphasis on the religious aspect of the training program 
than is found in the public training schools.

Personal Communication, January 30, 1951.

Many of the boys committed to the Training Schools 

have committed previous offences and have been on probation 

or in foster homes. Approximately 49 per cent of the boys 

have been in court one or more times prior to commitment• 

More than half of the boys committed appeared in the court 

for the first time, During the fiscal year ending March 

31, 1949, for which the above figures are given, 133 boys 

had returned from placement, making up 33 per cent of the 
1 

total group . The fact that approximately 17 per cent of 
the boys in the schools are mentally defective may account 
for higher recidivist rates 0 

For the period, February 3, 1947, to March 31, 1950, 

578 youths had been released from the reformatory at 
Brampton, and a careful record kept of all of them. As 
of March 31, 1950, 80 per cent or 478 were profitably 

2 

employed and had shown no further relapse into delinquency <, 
This remarkable success ratio should be interpreted with 
caution as it is the result of a follow-up study done over 
a comparatively short period of time. Furthermore, it 
might be doubted that the success is due to the training 
of the reformatory alone, as nine months is hardly sufficient 
time for re-training delinquent youth. It should be rem¬ 
embered also that the cases for this training were carefully

selected and represented perhaps a group of youths who 
could he reformed without intensive training over an 
extended period of time. 

From the above accounts of the training schools for 
juvenile delinquents in Ontario, it is evident that the 
problem of providing adequate facilities for delinquents 
is attempted. The success of the methods used can only 
be ascertained through studies over a period of time, but 
from a standpoint of principles derived from studies of 
other systems of known success, Ontario seems to be in¬ 
corporating progressive and up-to-date methods for the 
treatment of juvenile offenders. 

Quebec 

In Quebec, there is a division of child welfare ser¬ 
vices between private agencies and publicly operated insti¬ 
tutions. This has resulted in a lack of uniformity in juv¬ 
enile delinquency services throughout the province. At the 
time of the Royal Commission investigation of the Canadian 
penal system, the juvenile court system was seriously inad¬ 
equate. In 1944, there was no general system of public or 
semi-public agencies comparable to the children’s aid soc¬ 
ieties in other provinces, to protect children in the 
poor families, to arrange for foster-home placement, or 
to deal with the problems of adoption of children. The 
lack of such agencies resulted in the committal of many

children to institutions, whereas in other provinces they 
would be enabled to live in family homes. In reviewing 
the child welfare system in Quebec, Cassidy writes: M As 
of December 31, 1939, there were 2,051 children in the 
industrial schools of the Province and 926 in the reform¬ 
atory schools, a total of 2,977, while the total number 
in all Canadian institutions for juvenile delinquets was 
4,880. Thus Quebec, with about 30 per cent of the population 

J 

of Canada,had more than 60 per cent of the delinquent children 
in institutions. In Ontario, whose population is somewhat 
smaller than that of Quebec, the number of young delinquents 
in provincial training schools was 615 at the end of 1939. 

Out of 2,051 children in the Quebec industrial schools at 

the end of 1939, 73 were less than six years of age and 

1 

about half were less than ten years of age n . 

At the present time, two departments and many private 
agencies are concerned with the prevention of delinquency 
and the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents, Under 
the Department of the Attorney-General there are four Soc¬ 
ial V/elfare Courts. The Court at Montreal has four judges 
and a probation staff; the Court in Quebec, established 
in 1940 has two judges and a probation staff. On August 
16, 1950, Social Welfare Courts were established at Three 
Rivers and at Sherbrooke, each having one judge. The

jurisdiction of this Department extends over two detention 
homes for hoys located at Montreal and Quebec. 

The Department of Social Welfare and Youth has jur¬ 
isdiction over a Child Aid Clinic, which was established 
in Montreal in 1947 and is composed of social workers, 
psychologist, psychiatrist, doctors, and guidance officers; 
it administers the Youth Aid Service, which is in charge 
of scholarships and guidance clinic, an employment bureau, 
technical schools, arts and crafts schools. This Depart- 
ment also administers the Youth Protection Schools. 

The Social Welfare Courts, representing a new develop¬ 
ment in Canadian court system, were established by an Act 
of the provincial legislature passed on April 5, 1950 and 
which came into force on October 1, of the same year. When 
a child, or a boy or girl actually or apparently under the 
age of eighteen years violates the law, he is brought before 
the Social Welfare Court by a police officer specialized 
in the handling of juvenile delinquents. The judge, before 
considering the offence, refers the child to a group of 
specialists. The Child Aid clinic studies all the possible 
factors in the situation and relates them to the child. 

These studies are centered around the social, the medical 
and the psychological aspects of the child. After this 
study, a complete report including suggestions as to the 
method of treatment is sent to the judge. The judge has 
recourse to three methods of disposing with the case; (1) 
send the child to an appropriate institution if the report 
reveils that the child is mentally defective, (2) place

him on probation, and (3) advise the Minister of Social 
Welfare and of Youth to admit him to a Youth Protection 
School• 

Under the Youth Protection Schools Act, which came 
into force on Uctober 1, 1950, the Minister of Social 
Welfare and Youth has named three schools for delinquent 
boys, which are to fulfil the functions of the Act. 

These are located at Mount St* Antoine, Boscoville, and at 
Shawbridge. Under Section 2 of the act, any school may 
become a Youth Protection School, after the minister of 
the Department of Social Welfare and Youth has investigated 
the circumstances and conditions of the school. The schools 
are classified by the minister under Section 8, of the Act 
so as to provide for the "proper segregation of the children, 

taking into account their sex, age, religion and nhysical 

1 

and intellectual development, and their antecedents"• 

The Youth Protection Schools vary in capacity from 
15 to 400 and attempts are being made to obtain trained 
personnel. At the Schools, provisions are made for medical 
care, recreation, discipline, social work and education. 
Children, are admitted to the Schools under Section 15, 
of the Act which reads as follows:

When a child, apparently or actually more 
than six and less than eighteen years old, is 
particularly exposed to moral or’ physical dangers 
by reason of his environment or other special 
circumstances, and therefore requires to be pro¬ 
tected, any person in authority may bring him 
before a magistrate. 

The latter shall then investigate the 
particular circumstances in which the child is 
placed. 

Notice of such investigation and of the time and 
place where it will be held must be given to 
the parents, tutor or those in charge of the child; 
the latter are entitled to be heard and to submit 
any evidence which the magistrate deems relevant. 

Such notice may be given to them and proof there¬ 
of may be mad e orally. 

If the magistrate is convinced that the best 
interest of the child requires his admission to 
a school, he shall make a report to the minister 
accordingly, giving his reasons therefor. He 
shall at the same time send him an authentic copy 
of the child’s act of birth if it can be obtained; 
if not, he shall indicate the age of the child as 
he has been able to establish it by other evidence 
or his apparent age. 

He shall decide according to the evidence adduced 
before him and shall also mention in his report 
the place where the child is domiciled. 1 

The minister, receiving the necessary information decides 

in accordance with it, the school to which a child shall 

2 

be admitted under Section 18 of the Act. 

Under Section 40 of the Act, the minister, when he 
deems it in the interests of a child, may recommend to 
the Lieutenant-Governor his final discharge from the school. 
This is usually granted. The Act makes no provision for 
follow-up supervision of the child upon release, which may

represent a serious inadequacy in the provisions of the 
new delinquency services. 

It would he difficult to estimate the success in 
rehabilitating delinquent boys, that will be effected when 
the functions of the recent legislation are fulfilled. 

The slow development of improvements provided for in 
the recent legislation is indicative, in part, of the dif¬ 
ficulties oi improving delinquency treatment facilities 
where they are badly scattered between many private welfare 
agencies and government departments. 

The Maritimes 
Nova -.scotia 

In Nova scotia, juvenile delinquency comes under the 
Children’s protection Act and the Director of child Wel¬ 
fare is responsible for the administration of the delin¬ 
quency services. The juvenile court system operates under 
the provisions of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, and child¬ 
ren’s aid societies are found throughout the province to 
assist the courts in the handling of delinquent children. 

There are six juvenile courts located in the follow¬ 
ing judicial districts: the city of Halifax, County of 
Pictou, county of Cape Breton, county of Hants, county of 
Kings, and County of Colchester. 'The juvenile courts are 
characterized by serious deficiencies in their probation 
services. In the Annual Peport of the Director of Child 









- 128 


Welfare for the fiscal year ending November 30, 1949, 
the Judge of the juvenile court of the County of Cape 
Breton, writes: "The suspended sentence or release on pro¬ 
bation is a very dangerous proceeding unless the Court 
has competent probation ufficers to deal with each case, 
uur governments, from the highest to the lowest have 
adopted the part of the idea which costs the country or 
locality nothing, but balk at the real essential thing, 
that of providing the uourts with competent Probation 
Staff and facilities for dealing with delinquents and pre¬ 
delinquents". 

"The vital factor in controlling juvenile delinquency 

is the Probation Officer. Pre-delinquents and children 

appearing before the Court for the first time must be 

given follow-up treatment in order to prevent recurrence. 

It is folly to bring a boy before the Court and tell him to 

go home and not to do it ag in. He must be followed up. 

With one probation officer, most time is taken up with 

investigation, rather than with probation service. An 

attempt was made to establish a voluntary probation service, 

but its results did not justify its continuation. You can- 

1 

not get something for nothing." 

The report from the juvenile court at Halifax indicates 
the need of extended probation services as well as an

observation home where delinquents could be classified and 
recommendations made to the court as to the possible best 
course of treatment. 

There are two reformatories for delinquent boys in 
the province, the St. Patrick’s Home, which is a private 
institution for Roman Catholic boys, and the Nova Scotia 
School for Boys, which is publicly operated and non- 
denominational. Delinquent boys are committed to these 
schools by the juvenile courts or by a judge or magistrate 
under the provisions of the Prisons and Reformatories Act. 
The report of the Superintendent for the Nova Scotia School 
for Boys indicates that conditions of overcrowding are pres¬ 
ent and there is a need for additional probation services 

1 

for supervision after release. At this school boys spend 
about eighteen months and receive training in academic work 
and in the mechanical arts department. Some of the boys 
are placed in foster homes upon release from the school, 
but this is not common. 

There is a need for improving the existing delinquency 
treatment facilities in the province of Nova Scotia, espec¬ 
ially along the lines of probation and institutionalization, 
furthermore some form of treatment facilities should be made 
available for young offenders (above the age of sixteen) 
who are frequently committed to the prison.

JMew Brunswick 

In this province, delinquency services come under 
the auspices of the Department of Health and Social Ser¬ 
vices, in 1944, there were only two juvenile courts 
operating in the province, at Moncton and St* John. There 
was no organized probation service for juvenile delinquents 
The Hoys’ Industrial school at St. John is an institution 
for delinquent boys and is operated by the provincial gov¬ 
ernment. Boys paroled from the school, and not residing 
in the area close to the school, receive no supervision 
whatsoever upon their release* 

Prince Edward Island 

In the province of Prince Edward Island, the del¬ 
inquency services come under the Department of the Attorney 
General* There are children’s aid societies in Charllotte- 
town and in Summerside. Juvenile courts can be proclaimed 
in areas in the province, as no provincial legislation has 
been enacted for establishing courts in the province* 

Prince Edward island has no institutions for delinquents, 
and sends boys who must be institutionalized to the reform¬ 
atories in nova scotia or new Brunswick, at the expense 
of the province.

treating juvenile delinquents across Canada brings to 
light several characteristics of the conditions in 
existence. In many provinces, delinquency services fall 
under the jurisdiction of different departments, in the 
past this has led to difficulties of administration and lack 
of uniformity in the services provided. One of the trends 
in recent legislation has been to combine these services 
under one department or place them in closely related 
departments. The juvenile court system, in some of the 
most advanced provinces, serves little more than half of 
the population. There is a need, for the extension of 
these services in order that a larger number of delinquents 
will receive their benefits. Some provinces are making 
sincere efforts to improve this aspect of the delinquency 
services. One of the inadequacies of the juvenile delin¬ 
quency treatment facilities in Canada is represented by 
the poorly developed probation services. In some areas, 
probation personnel are poorly qualified for the task 
that they are responsible for doing. On the whole, there 
is a significant trend in various provinces to improve 
the institutions for juvenile delinquents, and efforts 
are being made to keep up with newest developments in 
institutionalization. With but few exceptions, the prov¬ 
isions in Canada for the young'off ender are grossly inad¬ 
equate, and the recommendations made by the Royal Commis¬ 
sion of 1938 have, as yet, not been followed on a national

scale to provide treatment for the offender between the 
ages of sixteen and twenty-five. 

The varied provisions for treating delinquent youth 
in Canada are in many respects seriously deficient and 
inadequate. Because of geographic difficulties, many 
children do not receive the benefits of the juvenilecourt 
system or of probation personnel. Provisions for instit¬ 
utional treatment vary from province to province. It is 
interesting to note however, that a sincere effort is being 
made to improve treatment facilities for delinquents in 
several provinces. Before such improvements are under¬ 
taken thefce is usually some recognition of the limitations 
and short comings of many of the existing delinquency

THE TREATMENT OF JUVENILE 


DELINQUENTS IN ALBERTA

Statutory Provisions 

In the Province of Alberta, there are three basic 
legislative enactments which deal specifically with the 
problem of juvenile delinquency. A brief discussion of 
these statutory provisions is helpful, if not necessary, 
for an understanding of some of the characteristics of 
the delinquency services throughout the province. 

The Juvenile Delinquents Act of Canada 

In 1914, Alberta passed legislation bringing into 
force The Juvenile Delinquents Act of 1908 for the whole 
province. This Act, revised in 1929, remains the fund¬ 
amental enabling statute. 

The Child Welfare Act of 1944 

This provincial Act, which consists of four parts, 
makes specific provisions for neglected and dependent child¬ 
ren, juvenile courts, the adoption of children, and child¬ 
ren of unmarried parents. 

The second part of the Act makes provisions for the 
setting up of juvenile courts, the appointment of juvenile 












135 


court judges, clerks of the juvenile courts, records, pro¬ 
bation officers, a Juvenile Court Committee, and detention 
homes. The Act, is similar in many respects, to the exist¬ 
ing legislation in other provinces across Canada, and to¬ 
gether with The Juvenile Delinquents Act of Canada, pro¬ 
vides the essential and necessary legislation for dealing 
with juvenile delinquents. 

The Juvenile Offenders Act of 1945 

The purpose of the Juvenile Offenders Act of 1945 is 
questionable, as the above two Acts provide the necessary 
legislation for dealing with juvenile delinquents. Nec¬ 
essity for this subsequent legislation might have arisen 
because the functions within the meaning of The Juvenile 
Delinquents Act of Canada, had not been fully developed. 

The provincial Act has created a special class of children 
designated as "juvenile offenders ?T . The definition of this 
term differs somewhat from the definition of "juvenile 
delinquent” as given in the Dominion statute*. 

Since the intent and purpose of The Juvenile Offenders 

Act seem to contravene that of the Dominion legislation 

1 

the constitutionality of the Act has been questioned . The 
powers vested in officials dealing with offenders are 
beyond the limitations set forth by the Dominion Act, and

thus disregard the safeguards that the latter Act makes 
for the protection and welfare of delinquent children* 

In discussing the Alberta statutory provisions and 
particularly The Juvenile Offenders Act, one study reports: 
"In dealing with Juvenile Delinquency in Alberta therefore, 
it is necessary to keep in mind that the emphasis in this 
province with regards to delinquency is now more on the 

Q. ’ 

implementation of justice through a makeshift and haphazard 
medium of detention, gaols and probation, rather than on 
rehabilitation of delinquent children through the utiliza¬ 
tion of courts, training schools and general case work. 

The Juvenile Offenders Act seems to have been designed to 

justify this system of handling delinauents and to ease the 

1 

conscience of its administrators"* Further discussion 
of the statutory provisions, undertaken in the subsequent 
sections of this chapter, will deal with the reasons for 
the opinions expressed above which tend to question the 
constitutionality of The Juvenile Offenders Act of Alberta.

study of child welfare conditions in Alberta. The Order 
attempted to enlist the co-operation of the provincial 
government in the study, but after extensive correspondence 
and interviews with government officials of the Welfare 
Department, the attempt ended in failure. Although govern¬ 
ment assistance and co-operation were refused for the 
study, the Order proceeded with plans to undertake such a 
survey, and appointed Dr. Charlotte Whitton as director 
of a study group for the purpose. 

The Deputy Minister of Welfare then wrote to all the 
secretaries of the municipalities in the province, stating 
that the government was not taking part in the study. By 
Quoting Section 69 of The Child Welfare Act, this letter 
conveyed the impression that the Department was opposed to 
the study committee. Moreover, it implied that any inform¬ 
ation given to the committee would be treated as an offence, 
punishable as such. Carried to its logical conclusion, the 
letter threw a screen of secrecy around the operations of 
the Child ?Jelfare Department, and definitely hampered the 
work of the committee undertaking the study for the I.O.-^.E. 

Increasing publicity given to the I.Q.D.E. study by 
the press, and the frequent reports of statements and 
addresses, as well as the circulation of a booklet entitled, 
"Summary of Findings and Recommendations" published by the 
I.O.D.E., resulted in the appoihtment of a Royal Commission, 
having a two-fold purpose, in the first place, the Commis- 






- 138 - 


sion was "to investigate the said charges, allegations and 
reports relating to the uhild Welfare branch of the Depart¬ 
ment of Public Welfare and officials thereof as contained 
in the articles, editorials, and newspaper reports? and 
secondly, "to investigate any other specific charges which 
may at any time be disclosed or submitted to the Commission 
relating to the child Welfare branch of the Department of 
Public Welfare, which, in the opinion of the commissioners, 

properly come within the scope of the commissioner’s in- 
1 

vestigations". The commission carried out investigations 
for the above purposes between duly 12, 1947 and December 
3, 1948. Before witnesses could be heard by the commission 
the l.O.D.E. published and circulated a complete report of 
its study, entitled, "Welfare in Alberta". The report of 
the Royal commission was not submitted until December 1948* 
The l.O.D.b. study and the Koyal commission report 
made several recommendations with regard to juvenile del¬ 
inquency and the need for improving delinquency services 
in the province was emphasized 0 

The following are the recommendations of the I.O.D.E, 
study which refer specifically to the handling of male 
juvenile delinquents in the province. 

n l. The vesting of responsibility for the system of 
Juvenile Courts (and family or social Courts as 
developed) in the Department of the Attorney-

Welfare : p. 2.

General, and the appointment of all judges (or 
presiding officers of such courts who might more 
appropriately be called magistrates) from per¬ 
sons well qualified by social work training and 
character but also trained in the law. 

2 0 The development of these Courts on a circuit basis 
with a small central probation staff supervising 
local effort. 

3. The appointment of all probation officers from a 
panel of approved candidates, selected by the 
Civil Service Commission with the advice of a 
board, representative of the Departments of the 
Attorney-General and Public Welfare. 

4. Stipulation in the Statute that any child appre¬ 
hended under The Juvenile Delinquents Act must 
be brought to hearing before the Judge, whether 
in Court or in chambers, or informally, within 

a specified time. 

5. The provision of adequate temporary detention 
quarters at appropriate centres throughout the 
Province and the location of centralized obser¬ 
vation and clinical facilities at two centers, 
one in the Worth and one in the South, at Ed¬ 
monton and at Calgary, with capital cost shared 
by the municipalities and by parents voluntarily 
placing children under observation. 

6. The provision of small training schools for long 
term commitment and training along five lines: 

(a) A boys’ school, offering agricultural, bus¬ 
iness and industrial training of a practical 
nature. A 

7. The development of an adequate field service, in 
collaboration with all existing local agencies, 
public or voluntary, to assure: 

(a) More effective preventive work with the del¬ 
inquent’s own home and family. 

(b) Continuous work with the home from which the 
delinquent has been removed, looking to effect¬ 
ive re-establishment of proper relationships 
upon completion of his or her period of train¬ 
ing, etc® 

(c) The most careful selection of all family homes 
for placement of delinquents from the angle of 
suitability in aiding in training and adjust¬ 
ment of the boy and girl, rather than the ec¬ 
onomic or ’’work” value of the latter. 

A The other four recommendations of this section refer 

spedifically to girls who are not considered in this study.

S. Fullest exchange of all essential records and data 
among all those with a responsible interest in the 
case and registration of all such cases in the 
Social Service Exchange. 

9. Consideration by the Family Bureaus in Calgary and 
Edmonton of the development of special case work¬ 
ers in both agencies, assigned primarily to work 
with (1) ’teen-age boys and young men, (2) X 

10. The association of the Province of Alberta with 
the other two Prairie Provinces in working out, 
in collaboration with the Dominion authorities, 
the development of co-operative plans for the 
long term custody, training, placement and after¬ 
care, along lines ocomparable to the Borstal 
principle, of older boys and youths who occupy 
the young man’s land between juvenile delinquents 
and adult offenders”. 1 


The Royal Commission, after investigating and con¬ 
sidering the many representations made to it, on behalf 
of the problem of juvenile delinquency services in Alberta 
made the following recommendations: 


1. That the Juvenile court judges should be selected, 
appointed and paid by the Department of the 
Attorney-General. 

2, That detention facilities should be modernized. 

5. That delinquent children should be held in det¬ 
ention homes as short a time as possible, and 
that in this connection the Superintendent of 
Child Welfare should not exercise the powers 
vested in him under The Juvenile Offenders Act, 
Section 16, clause (h). 

4. That adequate institutional training facilities 
should be established under the direct supervision 
of the Child Welfare Branch.

5* That the Child Welfare Commission should develop 
a system of help and placement of delinquents who 
pass the age of 18 years, especially in instances 
where it appears that such help is necessary* 

6. That the field service of the child Welfare .branch 
be placed in the hands of a trained staff, which 
should be available to delinquents and their fam¬ 
ilies* 

7. Eoster homes, usually on farms, where delinquent 
boys are placed should be thoroughly investigated 
as to their suitability, and a system of post¬ 
placement visitation should be developed* 

The discussion of the use of foster homes took place in the 

Commissions considerations of such homes for neglected and 

non-delinquent children, but the recommendations are equally 

applicable to the farm work homes where delinquent children 

are placed as an alternative to placement in an institution* 

The recommendations of these two studies were not as 

extensive as they might have been for two reasons; (1) the 

1*0.D*E* study was done without the co-operation of the Child 

Welfare Branch and was therefore limited in the information 

that was necessary for a thorough investigation of delinquency 

services, and (2) the Royal Commission was restricted in its 

investigations by the clearly defined purpose for which it 

was set up* The Commission was not able to discuss the 

I.O.D.E* charges regarding the constitutionality of the 

legislation, as this was beyond the scope of their investigation* 

The subsequent discussion will attempt to incorporate 

the findings of the 1*0.D*E. study and the Royal Commission 

investigation, m audition, mention will be made of new

developments in delinquency services in Alberta since 1948* 
Juvenile Courts in Alberta 

The juvenile court system in Alberta dates back to 
1913, when The Juvenile Courts Act was passed in the leg¬ 
islature, setting up courts in every village having over 
five hundred people, and every town and city. The court 
had the authority over the area designated to it, as well 
as over any additional area assigned to it by the Lieutenant- 
Governor in Council. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council 
could also establish juvenile courts, in any municipality, 
district, or portion of the province, whenever the need 
for such courts became apparent. 

The Commissioners appointed under The Childrens Prot¬ 
ection Act of Alberta, police magistrates of any city or 
town, District Court judges, and every Supreme Court judge, 
the latter only if willing to do so, could, act as judges 
of the juvenile court. 

The juvenile courts established under the Act came 
within the meaning and for the purpose of The Juvenile 
Delinquents Act of 1908, and had all the powers vested in 
the courts under the Dominion Act, as well as power to try 
any child charged with an offence against the laws of 
Alberta, and to deal vjith truants and offenders under The 
Truancy Act. 

The Juvenile Courts Act of 1922 was basically the 
same as the Act of 1913. In 1935, the Act of 1922 was

repealed, and assent was given to The Juvenile Courts 
Act of 1935. Under this Act the juvenile courts were 
established within the meaning and purpose of the Federal 
Juvenile Delinquents Act of 1929, and had all the powers 
vested in the courts by that Act. 

The Juvenile Courts Act of 1942 made the same prov¬ 
isions as the Act of 1935. In 1944, following an inquiry 
by a provincial committee into the child welfare services, 
The Child Welfare Act was passed. This Act repealed The 
Juvenile Courts Act of 1942, and incorporated the legisla¬ 
tion dealing with the juvenile courts. 

The specific methods used for appointing juvenile 
court judges resulted in a lack of uniformity in the 
juvenile court system in Alberta. 

Before the appointment of two full-time judges for 
the province, there were no less than seventy-eight appoint¬ 
ees with powers to act as juvenile judges, and of these, 

1 

four were in Admonton and three in Calgary. The first 
full-time juvenile court judge in Alberta was appointed in 
July, 1945, to serve Calgary and the area south of ned 
Deer. On January 1, 1946, a full-time judge was appointed 
for Admonton and the area north of Red Deer. Although 
criticism had been directed for some time at the lack of 
legal Qualifications of the juvenile court judges before 


1. Welfare in Alberta : The Report of a Study Undertaken 
by the I.O.D.E., Alberta, 1947, p. 138. 





144 


1945, the men appointed as full-time judges had no legal 
1 

training * However, one of the men had had previous court 
experience. 

In Alberta, the juvenile courts, unlike the courts in 
most other provinces, have been closely related to other 
branches of child welfare administration. The appointment 
of the two provincial juvenile court judges to the Child 
Welfare Commission under the chairmanship of the Super¬ 
intendent of Child Welfare, seems to bear out this relation¬ 
ship , 

In representations made to the Royal Commission of 
1948, the claim was made "that the practice whereby judges 
of the Juvenile Courts are members of the Child Welfare 

4t 

Commission and retained employees of the Department of 

Public Welfare is derogatory to the principles of an 

independent judiciary and to the impartial handling of 

either the social or legal aspects of causes in child and 

family welfare; that, on the contrary, such judges ought 

to be Qualified in the law as well as in social practice 

and should be appointed by and responsible to the Attorney- 

2 

General in the province . 


1. Edmonton Journal, February 5, 1943; Mr. A.W. Hobbs, 
Calgary juvenile court judge asserted that judges act¬ 
ing without remuneration were not advisable. 

Ibid. August 17, 1943: Mr. A.W. Hobbs, criticized the 
method for obtaining juvenile court judges and felt that 
they should be legal men trained for their service.

Welfare, p. 42*

in this connection, the finding of the uommission 
reads as follows: "This Commission is of the opinion that 
the Judges of the Juvenile Court should, in an admin¬ 
istrative sense, be completely independent of the Child 
Welfare .branch. They should have legal training or be 
exceptionally qualified by experience so that they may 
not only administer justice, but appear to administer it, 
and be capable of following the procedures of the Juvenile 
Delinquents Act, 1929 (Canada), and of observing it in 
letter and spirit. Logically, since they are a part of 
the adiainistration of justice, they should be appointed by 
and subject to, the administration of the Department of 
the Attorney-General. They should be engaged on a sal¬ 
ary basis. We can see nothing in this arrangement which 
would prevent the closest co-operation between the Juv¬ 
enile Court Judge and the officials of the Child Welfare 

Branch, where such co-operation is in the interests of 

1 

the children". 

Before discussing the methods of disposition .used by 
the juvenile courts, mention should be made of the fact that 
in Alberta, by a proclamation of the Governor-in-Council 
in 1932, the jurisdiction of the juvenile courts was ex¬ 
tended to children, actually or apparently, under the age 
of eighteen. Although, it can be argued that the raising 
of the age limit is in the best interests of a group of 

young offenders who otherwise would be sent to criminal

court and possibly jail, one should not overlook the added 

burden such an extension makes on existing detention and 

treatment facilities. There is evidence to suggest that 

the increased difficulties brought about by the extension 

of the jurisdiction of the juvenile courts to those under 

eighteen was recognized by workers in the province, within 

1 

a few years after it had been brought into effect. After 

considering many conflicting representations in connection 

with the raising of the age limit of those coming under 

the jurisdiction of the juvenile courts across Canada, 

the Royal Commission investigating the Canadian penal 

system reported : ”YourCommissioners are definitely of the 

opinion that the jurisdiction of the juvenile courts should 

be limited to children below the age of sixteen years. The 

methods of dealing with children, and the characteristics 

of the court that should be applied to children of this age, 

are entirely different from those which ought to be applied 

to young persons between sixteen and eighteen years. The 

problem of detention homes and training schools would be 

clearly aggravated, and, in our opinion, has been aggravated 

2 

where the age limit has been increased”. Although Alberta 
has raised the age limit and extended the jurisdiction of

the. juvenile courts, there has been no attempt made to 
adapt detention or training facilities accordingly. 

When a child that has been apprehended is brought 
before the court and found guilty of an offence, the 
.juvenile court judge may take one or more courses of action 
as provided in The Juvenile Offenders Act. A survey of 
the Annual Reports of the Department of Public Welfare 
indicates that the methods of disposition used most fre¬ 
quently are: (1) warnings, (2) imposing fines, restitution 
and costs, (3) placing a child on suspended sentence, and 
(4) placing a child on probation. The course of action the 
juvenile court judge may take is determined in part by the 
information gathered during the pre-hearing investigation, 
usually carried out by a probation officer, as well as 
reports from the Child Guidance Clinic, if the boy is sent 
to such a clinic for observation and testing. The period 
of investigation and observation of the child is limited 
by Act, to twenty days, during which time the child is 
detained in a properly established detention home. One 
of the weaknesses of the juvenile court system in Alberta 
is the lack of a sufficient number of detention homes to 
provide for segregating boys of different ages, as well as 
keeping separate boys detained before their hearing from 
boys already adjudged delinquent and waiting the disposition 
of their cases. In the case of those children who persist 
in further delinquencies and do not respond to warnings,

probation, or the placement in foster homes under the super¬ 
vision of probation officers, they are made wards of the 
government. As a ward, the child is removed entirely from 
the dare and custody of his parents or guardian, and such 
care and custody is vested in the Superintendent of Child 
Welfare. 

Methods Used With Delinquents Made Wards 

As a ward of the government, the child may be 
placed in a detention home to await the disposition by the 
Superintendent. Two other courses of action are available, 
the placing of a child in a foster home, or in a farm home 
to work. These methods are used as an alternative to commit¬ 
tal to an institution, which Alberta does not have. The 
use of the latter two methods shall be considered in detail 
in the next section. 

The clause in The Juvenile Offenders Act enabling a 
judge to "commit the child to a detention home to await dis¬ 
position by the Superintendent of Child Welfare" can easily 
be abused. There is evidence that juveniles have been 
detained unnecessarily by the Superintendent. The Royal 
Commission investigating Child Welfare in Alberta, reported 
that, "juveniles have been left in confinement in detention 
homes, both before and after their hearings in Juvenile 
Court, for longer periods than are consistent with their

1 

rights”. An important provision of the Dominion Juvenile 
Delinquents Act specified that the court may "commit the 
child to an industrial School duly approved by the Lieuten¬ 
ant.-Governor in Council". The Dominion Act clearly defined 
"industrial home" and provisions for its establishment are made 
under the Prisons and Keformatories Act of Canada. Under 
special amendments of this Act, the commitment of a child 
to an industrial home is reasonably specific and well safe¬ 
guarded. In Alberta, however, there is no definition of 
"industrial home" in the statute, and furthermore no such 
home exists. As detention homes are established under the 
provisions of The Juvenile Delinquents Act, the safeguards 
applying to industrial homes are not applicable to them. 

This situation makes it possible for the Superintendent to 
detain children for any length of time, even if such det¬ 
ention is not in the best interest of their welfare. More¬ 
over, under the provisions of Section 69 of The Child Wei* 
fare Act, information about the child kept in detention 
can be withheld from any person seeking it, even though that 
person may be a parent or guardian. The Royal Commission 
of 1948, was not empowered to discuss existing legislation 
in its investigation, although it strongly recommended that 
the powers given to the Superintendent under The Juvenile 
Offenders Act should not be used.

A ward of the government, upon reaching the age of 
eighteen, no longer comes under the jurisdiction of the 
juvenile court or the Child welfare branch. The findings 
of the Royal Commission indicated that no provision was 
made for the supervision of delinquent boys after they 
reached the age of eighteen. Wards were simply dropped 

from the rolls of the child welfare Branch, "to sink or 

1 

swim". No assistance was given a ward in his readjustment 
to society or the community to which he might go. Lacking 
such superivison, a delinquent, left entirely on his own, 
is more likely to commit further offences than one who is 
closely supervised for some time. As has been noted in 
preceding chapters the success of various forms of treat¬ 
ment depends, in part, upon the follow-up supervision that 
can be given to the delinquent child or young offender dur¬ 
ing the post-treatment period. Such supervision requires 
additional staff members to do the work. Since the Royal 
Commission investigation, there is no evidence pointing 
to a substantial improvement in the post-treatment services 
for delinquents.

of farm work homes has been practiced widely in the prov¬ 
ince for over twenty years. The system, consisting of 
a panel of foster homes, usually on farms, where delinquent 
boys can be placed, has been highly praised by the officials 
of the Child Welfare Branch. The authorities have pointed 

out that substantial savings in public funds effected by

the practice of foster-home placements . 

The claim has also been made that the system has been

unusually successful in relcaiming delinquent youths . The 
system was highly praised by the Canadian Royal Commission 
investigating the penal system in 1938, when it reported 
that, "The authorities in Edmonton, Alberta, have evolved 
a scheme as an alternative to training schools that has 
had considerable success. In co-operation with the Child¬ 
ren’s Aid Society d»f Alberta, they have prepared a panel 
of foster homes. These homes are thoroughly inspected and 
well supervised, and are usually situated on a farm some 
distance from the city. When it has been decided that juv¬ 
enile delinquents should be removed from the surroundings 
of their delinquency, they are put in one of these foster

homes on probation and under supervision. The judges of 
the juvenile court and the children’s aid authorities of 
Alberta report that marked success has attended this treat¬ 
ment. They also report that they have no difficulty in 
obtaining a sufficient number of suitable foster homes to 
meet their requirements, in many cases youths so dealt 
with have been able to save substantial sums of money and 
have ultimately succeeded in establishing themselves in 
life. We are advised that the success of this system in 
Alberta has been due to the very strict character of the 

supervision exercised over the youths and over the homes 

1 

in which they have been placed.” ±n spite of the high 

praise accorded the system of foster-home and farm work 

placements in Alberta, there is evidence suggesting that 

the limitations of the system were realized by individuals 

2 

within the province • 

A Committee, set up in 1943 to investigate child wel¬ 
fare in Alberta, did not recommend any specific changes in 
the widely used child placing system. The practice of 
placing a large number of delinquent children in foster 
homes was not questioned seriously until the l.O.D.E. study 
of 1947. The study claimed that the whole field of foster-

home placement for neglected and delinquent children, the 
system of home finding, child placing, and the subsequent 
supervision of the children was not properly organized* 

In a brief submitted to the Royal Commission invest¬ 
igating welfare in Alberta in 1948, the Children*s Aid 
Department of the City of Calgary pointed out that, f, No 
fault can be found with the foster-home principle, especially 
if such homes are carefully selected and supervised. They 
are an important and valuable part or any child welfare 
programme, particularly when used for the care of neglected 
or delinquent children of tender years. But we are con¬ 
sidering here, the problem of the habitual delinquent or 
semi-habitual delinquent between the ages of twelve and 
eighteen years. Many have become **very tough kids** and 
ordinary probation and other remedial measures have failed 
entirely. To place this type of boy, and to a lesser degree, 
girl in a foster home is, in our opinion, just the height 
of folly. 

**In what mysterious way the farmer, or foster parent 
is to achieve the redemption of this type of delinquent 
child is hard to understand. It would indeed be almost 
a modern miracle if they did succeed where parents, teachers, 
church leaders, police, probation officers and other inter¬ 
ested individuals all have tried and failed. The plain 
truth is that many boys and girls run away repeatedly from 
these farms and foster homes, often committing thefts or

other types of offences before or aftrr leaving. They then 
reappear in their own home localities, but, being afraid of 
apprehension, do not go home. They lead a nomadic sort of 
life for a time, living by begging or stealing until they 
are finally hunted down and returned by the police or juv¬ 
enile officers to the custody of the Provincial Superintendent 

of Child Welfare. Then very often this performance is re- 

1 

peated over and over again” • The brief revealed that there 
were sixty-four boys, who were wards or presumed to be wards 
of the government, who had run away from foster or farm work 
homes and had been apprehended in the city of Calgary in a 
period of eighteen months. Some of the boys had run away 
from these homes as many as five or six times, and odd cases 
ran away as many as seven and nine times”. 

In another brief, presented to the Royal Commission 
by the Edmonton Council of Social Agencies, general views 
regarding the practice of the foster home and farm work 
home placement system in Alberta were expressed : ”Most 
child welfare experts would agree that many delinquents 
would benefit greatly from placement in foster homes under 
given circumstances. However, it has been found from ex¬ 
perience in most places where foster home placement of del- 
in auents has been tried that the amount of staff work re¬ 
quired for the skilful selection and supervision of such

homes, on any wide scale, is great, and from an administrative 
point of view is not practicable...No agency in the City 
at the present time is prepared or equipped to find suitable 
family foster homes and provide the amount and kind of int¬ 
ensive supervision and case-work service which would be 
required for the adequate care of delinquents, presenting 
as they do, special and complex problems requiring much more 
patience and understanding than the average foster parent 
would ordinarily bring to the situation,..A good training 
school may be considered costly, but foster home care for 

this group of children, to be good, is likely to prove even 
1 

more so" • 

The Royal Commission investigated the foster-home and 
farm work home systems and made several specific recommend¬ 
ations, The Commissioners urged that steps should be taken 
to widen the foster home service and to improve it by making 
a systematic search for suitable foster homes throughout 
the province, and that these homes should be thoroughly 
inspected and approved as suitable for children. An agree¬ 
ment in writing should be obtained from the foster parents, 
outlining in detail their rights and responsibilities. The 
need for frequent visitation of homes should be undertaken, 
boarding ho^es being visited at least bi-annual}.y and the 
work homes visited more often. The Commissioners felt that

with the exception of a few cases, the farm work home, where 
the child is expected to return work or services should be 
abolished* 

The investigation revealed that the foster home system 
as it existed in 1947 was poorly organized and seriously 
understaffed, m its findings the commission reported: "It 
is clear from the evidence and a perusal of the various files 
that there is no systematic search for suitable homes, in 
fact, the Branch is not staffed to undertake tnis work, 
foster homes at present are found mainjy in two ways: first, 
by casual contacts made by branch officials in various com¬ 
munities; and, secondly, by means of letters written to the 
branch by persons who desire to taice children into their homes* 

"Perusal of the files placed before us shows no records 
or reports of personal inspections of foster homes before 
placements, in several cases where people had written in to 
the Branch seeking children, a form of questionnaire and an 
application form was sent out. The application is in the 
form of a printed letter, which, on acceptance, purports to 
be an agreement as to the care of the child. It falls short, 
we think of being that sort of agreement which is necessary 
to fully outline the rights and duties of the foster parents 
and the Branch, and which is necessary to protect the interests 
of child and foster parents. In some cases, too, references 
were requested, and form questionnaires were sent out to those 
references, in the opinion of your Commissioners these form reports

from references so obtained are of very little value* No 

such long range investigation, your Commissioners consider, 

can or should supplant a careful personal inspection of some 
1 

qualified worker” • 

The Commission found that the system of post-placement 
visiting was far below recognized standards. Wards placed 
in the city of Edmonton, were visited once a year or less 
frequently, while wards placed outside of Edmonton, in 
homes fairly close to the city were seldom visited. In the 
more outlying areas the files had no records of wards being 
visited. 

In a preceding chapter, it was stated that the success 
of foster-home placement depends to a degree on the amount 
of post-placement supervision and guidance. Delinquent 
children, coming from bad home conditions, and whose del¬ 
inquency may in part be attributed to these conditions, need 
supervision and guidance. Parents, receiving such children 
into their homes could benefit from the advice of a trained 
and qualified worker doing post-placement visitation. The 
Commission reported that, "In several files there is evidence 
that the foster parents had great difficulty in adjusting 
the child to the home, and wrote in repeatedly reporting the 

facts, and, finally, had to return the child to the Denart- 

2 

ment, but no visits were made in these cases” •

During the past three years the Child Welfare Branch 
has continued the use of the foster home system as a method 
of handling juvenile delinquents made wards of the govern¬ 
ment. There is no evidence to suggest that improvements 
along the lines recommended by the Royal Commission have been 
made in connection with foster home placements, in select¬ 
ing homes for delinquent youths, questionnaires are sent 
out to prospective foster parents, and information about a 
home is gathered through this method. 

The divergent views expressed above, by the two Royal 
Commissions, investigating the same aspect of delinquency 
services in Alberta, indicates that the Canadian Roy^l Com¬ 
mission was poorly informed if not largely misinformed of 
the foster home placement system used in Alberta. At the 
time of the investigations carried out by this Commission, 
press reports would indicate that the foster home and farm 
work home placement system in Alberta was enthusiastically 
endorsed by officials of the child welfare administration, 
and enjoying an unusual wave of popularity. 

During the course of the present study, it was learned 
that the supervision of approximately one hundred and fifty 
delinquent boys, presumably wards of the provincial govern¬ 
ment, placed in foster homes and on farm work homes, had been 
assigned to a provincial Director of Boys 1 Activities who 
was appointed in the spring of 1950. Part of the duties 
of the Director, who is a former policeman, consist of plac-

ing and supervising the boys under his care in suitable 
homes* The heavy case load that the Director carries would 
suggest that only a minimum of supervision, if any at all, 
can be given by him, to the boys in his care throughout the 
province. Much of the supervision and guidance is attempted 
through correspondence. It was also learned, that no boy 
is kept on a farm if he does not make a satisfactory adjust¬ 
ment or proves to be unruly. In such cases a boy is usually 
moved to another farm home. The best principles of foster¬ 
home placement discourage the frequent change of homes in 
connection with delinquents. Moreover, before boys are 
taken from one home and placed in another home adequate 
investigation should be made to ascertain the reasons for 
the unfavourable adjustment. This requires intensive work 
done by qualified personnel, who have some understanding of 
the personality and social requirements of delinquent boys. 
It is clearly evident that the present Director is handi¬ 
capped in doing much work with individual cases because of 
the large number of boys placed under his control. The 
Director is responsible for doing probation work of an 
especially difficult kind. In spite of the recommendations 
of the Royal Commission of 1948, emphasizing the need for 
improving personnel in the Child Welfare Branch, the above 
appointment suggests that the recommendations have not been 
followed. In this connection, Cassidy’s words are not 
irrelevant: "Probation service is social service of a part-

in his own work, is no more equipped for it than he is for 

accounting, or public health, or teaching, or other profes- 

1 

sions for which he has not been trained” . 

In closing, mention should be made of the frequent 
statements made by officials of the child welfare admin¬ 
istration, regarding the nigh degree of success that the 
foster home system has enjoyed in Alberta. It would be 
difficult to substantiate such statements without a study 
over an extended period of time, of the adjustment of the 
boys who had been placed in foster homes or farm work 
homes# Such a study has not been carried out. Moreover, 
on the basis of the standards set by different authorities, 
and described in a preceding chapter of this thesis, one 
would be led to suggest that the Alberta system, with its 
low standards, would not be as successful as similar methods 
used in other areas are, especially when the standards set 
by the latter are considerably higher. It must be remembered 
that boys who have run away from foster or farm worK homes, 
but have not reappeared in court, have been termed successes. 
There is no evidence available regarding tne present adjust¬ 
ment of such hoys. There is the possibility that they have 
committed further offences, btit have not been apprehended. 

The complete absence of any supervision given to the boys

after they pass their eighteenth birthday and cease to be 
wards of the government, results in a failure to reveal the 
possible adjustment of these boys in their post-treatment 
period. Because of these discrepancies in the system, the 
reports by child welfare officials of the success of the 
foster home and farm work system can be regarded only as 
expressions of opinion, unsubstantiated by accurate stat¬ 
istics. 


Probation in Alberta 

The Juvenile Courts Act of 1935, required that every 
city or town having a population of five thousand or over, 
appoint and pay one or more persons to be probation officers 
within the specific area designated, this provision placed 
a greater responsibility on the muneipalities than had pre¬ 
viously been the case. Before 1935, probation officers were 
members of the children’s aid societies, inspectors appointed 
under the provisions of the Childrens Protection Act, or 
persons appointed by the judge of the juvenile court with 
the approval of the Superintendent of Neglected Children. 

This provision of the Act of 1935 was incorporated into 
the Child Welfare Act of 1944. However, probation officers 
could also be appointed by the judge of the juvenile court, 
subject to the approval of the Superintendent of Child Wel¬ 
fare. Probation officers appointed in this manner, are to 
act voluntarily, unless remuneration is provided by municipal 
authority or in some other way.

The duties of the probation officer are assigned by 
the judge of the particular court to which he is attached 
and may involve pre-hearing investigations, care and custody 
of a child before and after a court hearing, visiting a child 
that has been returned to its home, supervising a child that 
has been placed in a foster home, and any other duties that 
may arise and which the probation officer could do in connection 
with juvenile court procedure. 

The method of probation is commonly used by the juvenile 
court judges in the disposition of juvenile delinquents. 

However, with but few exceptions, probation staffs are inad¬ 
equately trained or qualified for the task they are appointed 
to do. There is no province wide system whereby probation 
services could be organized. Cassidy reported that in 
Alberta, "Organized probation service is very slight and is 

scarcely specialized at all, usually being provided by the 

1 

police" • In 1943, the committee investigating the prov¬ 
incial child welfare services, reported: "If the probation 
system is to function properly it is obvious that each city 
and town must fulfil its obligation under The Child Vfelfare 
Act and The Juvenile Courts Act, to appoint a sufficient 
number of probation officers to adequately take care of pro¬ 
bation work in the city and town, and it is necessary that 

2 

competent and well-trained probation officers be appointed".

In its recommendations to the Royal Commission, the 
Edmonton Council of Social Agencies indicated that the pro¬ 
bation staffs should be substantially strengthened in the 
city, in order to do probation work adequately. Many of the 
probation officers because of the heavy case loads, could 
not give the required attention to the individuals placed 
under their supervision. Furthermore, the difficulties of 
the probation staffs were increased as they were also res¬ 
ponsible for work with neglected and non-delinquent children. 

In 1948, the Royal Commission emphasized the need for 
a larger number of trained personnel in the Child welfare 
Branch of the Department of Public Welfare, The recom¬ 
mendations made by the Commission are equally applicable to 
the personnel of probation staffs. The rapid growth of the 
population iB most towns and cities in the province has 
increased the necessity for strengthening probation staffs 
throughout the province, in numbers as well as in quality. 

The success of this method of treating delinquents 
depends in part on the quality of the personnel and the amount 
of time given to each delinquent put on probation. There 
are no statistics available which would indicate the success 
of probation in this province. However, the lack of properly 
trained personnel, the heavy case loads, poor organization 
in probation services, all tend to suggest that probation in 
the province, is perhaps less successful than in areas where 
it has been more highly developed and organized.

the degree of success that can be expected from this method 
of handling delinquents, i\io such study has as yet been 
made, however, this should not prevent the improvement of 
the existing probation services, where it is clearly in¬ 
dicated that such improvements are a necessity. 

institutionalization in Alberta 

Most authorities on juvenile delinquency, express 
the opinion that the use of special institutions for 
certain groups of juvenile delinquents or young offenders, 
is a necessity in any adequate delinquency treatment program. 
In Alberta, there has been a general reluctance on the part 
of the provincial child welfare authorities to establish 
treatment facilities in the nature of training schools or 
reformatories for the delinquent youth of the province. 

Under special arrangements with the province of Man¬ 
itoba, Alberta secured the benefits of institutionalization 
for a certain number of delinquent boys, by placing them 
in the Manitoba Home for Boys at Portage la Prairie. In 
1920, thirty-four delinquent boys from Alberta, were com¬ 
mitted to the Home at Portage la Prairie • The province 
paid the full cost of maintaining the boys committed to 
this school by the juvenile courts. The provisions for

institutionalization, made under these arrangments, did 
not lessen the need for an institution within the province. 

And an editorial in one of Edmonton’s papers, written over 
fifteen years ago, expressed the view that: "Alberta, in 
the twenty years of its life as a province had sidestepped 
the problem of corrective punishment for juveniles who 
persist in criminal activities, it has avoided the expense 
of building and maintaining a properly equipped industrial 
home or reformatory by making an arrangement with the prov¬ 
ince of Manitoba, under which Alberta boys may be sent to 
1 

the reformatory". As the practice of placing juvenile del¬ 
inquents in foster homes and farm work homes became more 
common, there was a gradual reduction in the number of 
boys committed to the institution at Portage la Prairie, 
until such committals were abandoned completely. This 
left the province with the alternative of placing all del¬ 
inquent boys who had been made wards of the government in 
foster homes or farm work homes. Where the boys were over 
fourteen years of age, and were seriously delinquent, they 
were brought before the criminal court and sentenced to 
prison, after it had become evident that they would not 
respond to the treatment prescribed by the juvenile court. 

The enthusiastic support given to the foster-home and 
farm work home placement system by the provincial authorities, 
discouraged any attempts of establishing an institution for

boys within the province. The limitations of the system 
that was used were not clearly recognized, and the child 
welfare administration consistently opposed proposals sug¬ 
gesting that an institution for delinquents should be est- 

1 

ablished, under provincial auspices. 

The lack of some form of institutional facilities to 
provide specialized therapy for delinquent boys became evident 
when it was realized that foster homes were not prepared to 
give such therapy for delinquent boys. In 1944, one writer 
stated: "The lack of training schools for delinquent boys 
and girls had led to some difficult problems. It has been 
necessary to detain some unstable juveniles in mental 
institutions, while in some cases the courts had no altern¬ 
ative but to commit young people to the provincial jails* 

At the other end of the scale, some difficult children 

2 

who should be in institutions are kept in foster homes” . 

The Children’s Aid Department of the City of Calgary, 
in a brief submitted to the Royal Commission of 1948, 


1* Edmonton Journal, January 20, 1938: Mr. T. R. Blaine, 
Superintendent of Child Welfare reported that: ”With- 
out a reform or industrial school of any kind in the 
province, year after year the system has proved to be 
the ’bright light of Canada’”. 

Ibid. August 27,1942: Mr. Blaine deblared that, ”Re- 
form schools are just breeding places for young crim¬ 
inals and we can do without them”. 

Ibid. February 4, 1943: Mr. C.B. Hill, assistant 
supervisor of child welfare, speaking to a meeting of 
provincial child welfare officers in Edmonton, asserted: 
”since 1931, we have found the Alberta system of farm 
placement the best yet devised. If a boy is a failure 
on the first farm we send him to another, and keep doing 
that until he finds the place he is happy and ready to 
co-operate.

stressed the need for establishing training school fac¬ 
ilities for delinquent children under the direct supervision 
of the provincial Child Welfare Branch, It was recommended 
that staffs for such schools should be properly qualified 
and trained for doing institutional work. The brief also 
recommended the setting up of some form of institution for 
training young offenders between the ages of sixteen and 
twenty-one for whom foster-home placement was difficult. 

It was felt that some agreement should be worked out between 
the three Prairie Provinces whereby two institutions could 
be built and operated along lines similar to the Borstal 
institution in England to deal with the older group of 
offenders# 

The Edmonton Council of Social Agencies, in its brief, 

recommended "that the Department and the Government of 

Alberta seek active support of appropriate officials in the 

other Provinces directed towards obtaining institutional 

training facilities along the lines of Borstal schools, 

1 

in the upper age range, (16 - £3 years)"• The Council also 
recommended that training schools should be established 
for juvenile delinquents, to be viewed not as a last resource 
in delinquency treatment, but as a place where delinquents 
could be re-educated. 

There were no institutional training facilities avail-

able for delinquent boys in July 1947, when the hoyal Com¬ 
mission undertook the investigation into the child welfare 
services in Alberta. During the investigation, by an Order- 
in-Couneil, provision was made for a few delinquent boys 
in a special ward of the Provincial Mental institute at 
Oliver. The Commissioners found that there were no other 
private or public institutional training facilities for 
boys, and entire reliance was placed on the foster-home and 
farm work home system. They reported that, "the increasing 
emergence of a type of tough, hardened, delinquent boy of 

urban origin is rapidly breaking through the system and 

1 

disclosing its inadequacies"• There was in their opinion, 
a group of approximately one hundred delinquents ranging 
from eight to eighteen years who had failed to respond to 
the treatment provided by the existing facilities. These 
boys had been warned, received suspended sentences, placed 
on probation, fined, made wards of the government, placed 
on farms, etc., but there was no sign of improvement in 
their behavior. 

The Commissioners recommended the extended use of 
psychiatric services throughout the province to detect 
behavior problems in children at an early age. Besides, 
it was strongly urged that institutional training facilities 
for delinquents should be made available, the training adapted

to two delinquency age groups, (a) those between eight and 
fourteen years, and (b) for boys up to the age of eighteen. 

The Commission recommended that the schools should be 
operated by the Child Welfare branch, it also revealed, 
that for various reasons, the branch has maintained the 
position that institutions should be operated by private 
agencies rather than the state. 

In 1938, the Royal Commission investigating the Can¬ 
adian penal system recommended that serious consideration 
should be given to the setting up of specially adapted 
Borstal units in various provinces across Canada, This 
Commission felt that it was feasible to establish such 
a unit to serve the three Prairie Provinces. ±n the spring 
of 1948, representatives of the Attorney-Generals’ and child 
welfare departments of these provinces met for the purpose 
of discusssing the proposed Borstal unit. It was decided 
to make representations to the Dominion government asking 
that the government would establish such a unit. Before 
the meeting of these representatives the Department of 
Public 'Welfare had announced plans to the effect that a 
f50,000 structure would be built at the Provincial Mental 
Institute at Oliver for the purpose of treating a certain 
group of delinquents. In 1948, after it had become evident 
that the proposed Borstal unit for the prairies would not 
be established in the near future, the Department established 
a ward for incorrigible juveniles in a new unit of the

Provincial Mental institute. The new unit had been designed 
to house mental defectives, 

The practice of committing young delinquent boys to 
a ward of a mental institution is questionalbe, it is true 
that at the ward the boys may receive the benefits of the 
hospital's psychiatric service and may be kept under close 
observation. This does not eliminate the need for special 
educational and vocational training facilities which may be 
difficult to provide in a mental institution. The ward is 
poorly adapted for the purposes of re-educating children* 

The atmosphere of a mental institution, where some association 
with people suffering from varying degrees of mental ill¬ 
ness is inevitable, is not conducive to any child's welfare 
and may be an extremely disturbing experience for a child, 
no matter how incorrigible he might be. Moreover, it has 
been learned that the use of outdoor recreational facilities 
for the delinquent boys is limited, because of the dangers 
of absconding. Evidence seems to suggest that the ward, 
poorly adapted and situated, should be abandoned, and train¬ 
ing facilities in line with the Royal Commission investigation 
should be established. 

In conclusion, mention should be made of the problem 
of the young offender in Alberta. This group of offenders 
between the ages of sixteen and twenty-four constitute a 
large portion of all convicted and sentenced criminals . In

Alberta, the young offender, who passes beyond the juris¬ 
diction of the juvenile court, either through age or serious¬ 
ness of his offence, is sentenced to one of the two prov¬ 
incial jails. If his sentence is longer than two years he 
is committed to the federal penitentiary at Prince Albert. 
Although many improvements in prisons have been brought 
about within the last decade, the need for special institutions 
specifically designed for the task of re-educating and re¬ 
forming the young offender is still present. Alberta should 
take steps in establishing such an institution, keeping in 
mind the principles and aims of reformation. 

Discussion 

In recent years, Alberta has shown remarkable progress 
in developing many public services. This progress however, 
has not been characteristic of the existing delinquency 
treatment services. The need for improving the existing 
treatment facilities., as well as developing additional ones, 
for juvenile delinquents and young offenders, is evident 


indictable crimes were committed by youths between the 
ages of 16 and 21 years. In 1947, more than a third 
(58.8%) of all indictable crimes were committed by 
young people between the ages of 16 and 24 years. In 
1948 almost 40% of all indictable crimes were committed 
by young people between the ages of 16 and 24 years.

in the above survey of methods now in practice. 

Improvements in the present methods should be in line 
with principles derived from well-developed treatment 
methods of reputed success, which have been used in other 
areas over a period of years. This means, that instead of 
adopting, without modification, some treatment method of 
known success, Alberta must develop her own facilities for 
treating delinquents. These facilities must be adapted 
to a province, which on the one hand is characterized by 
a large, predominantly agricultural, sparsely settled 
area, and on the other, by a repidly growing population in 
many villages, towns and cities. These characteristics 
add to the difficulty of establishing an adequate and 
uniform program of delinquency treatment services. 

On the basis of recent progressive developments and 
the results obtained by using proven and well-estbalished 
methods of treating delinquents in other areas, several 
improvements may be suggested which if implemented, would 
raise the present low standards of Alberta’s treatment 
facilities. 

A significant characteristic of the existing provisions 
for treating delinquents is the reliance placed on the pub¬ 
lic administration of the treatment facilities. In most 
provinces, there are children’s aid societies and many 
private welfare organizations which assist in the treatment 
of delinquent youth. In Alberta, such societies and organ-

izations are virtually non-existent. The centralization 
of the treatment facilities in one public department can 
be used to great ddvantage in providing a uniformity of 
service, as has been shown in England. Under such a 
system, careful records of delinquents can be kept without 
difficulty over an indefinite period of time, and follow¬ 
up studies could ascertain the degree of success of a part¬ 
icular form of treatment. 

It must be remembered however, that in any overly 
centralized system of treatment facilities there are cer¬ 
tain obvious dangers. In the first place, there is always 
the possibility of inefficiency and inadequacy in much of 
the service that a centralized publicly controlled system 
provided. Although such a system may be highly successful 
in the early stages of its administration, it can easily 
become out-dated if it fails to keep up with progressive 
developments in the field of treatment. Generally,if a 
publicly controlled system is characterized by low stand¬ 
ards from the beginning, efforts to effect improvements are 
frequently opposed by the administrators, and attempts 
are directed at maintaining the status quo. 

In a centralized system, legislative safeguards in 
the administration of delinquency services may be necessary 
for the protection of the child and the smooth running of 
the department concerned. In Alberta, Section 69 of The 
Child Welfare Act can be used to conceal all the records

of the delinquents that pass through the juvenile courts. 
Combined with sections of The Juvenile Offenders Act of 
Alberta it vests unusual powers in the Superintendent of 
the Child Welfare Branch, and makes it impossible for 
individuals to question those powers. No legal safeguards 
should be used to shroud the publicly administered system 
in a veil of secrecy. Progress in developing more adequate 
facilities, has depended in many areas, on constructive 
public criticism and the results of the investigations of 
individuals sincerely interested in the task of rehabilit¬ 
ating and treating delinquent youth. 

At the present time, Alberta’s legislative provisions 

enable a judge of the juvenile court to prescribe various 

courses of action when confronted with a delinquent child* 

This power to prescribe the treatment of a delinquent 

countries 

child, has, in some , passed from the jurisdiction of 

the judge, to a committee of qualified personnel who make 
a thorough diagnosis of each delinquent. On the basis of 
this diagnosis, they recommend a course of action which 
they feel is most likely to effect a change in the behavior 
of a delinquent child. The function 6f the juvenile court 
judge is therefore reduced to ascertaining the guilt of an 
individual, and in some instances, to sentencing the del¬ 
inquent for the period of time that the committee recom¬ 
mends. This arrangement is closely related to the idea of 
treating and rehabilitating a delinquent child and is less

concerned about seeing that the punishment is fitted to 
the offence. 

The diagnosis and classification of a delinquent child 
by a committee of qualified personnel represents a recent 
development in improving the initial step in the treatment 
of the delinquent. Necessary legislative provisions could 
establish such a committee which would assume the respon¬ 
sibility for the diagnosis, classification and recommend¬ 
ations for treatment. The classification system used by 
the English Borstal System, the Youth Correction Authority 
of California, and the Reception Center at Elmira in New 
York are the best examples of this recent development, and 
can be used as models for setting up a system of class¬ 
ification in Alberta. During the course of study it was 
learned that Saskatchewan has already taken a step in 
this direction. Alberta*s improvements in delinquency 
treatment services may well begin by making provision for 
a similar classification system* 

In order to carry out the treatment prescribed by a 
classification committee, a variety of training facilities 
is required. As no single cause was responsible for the 
delinquency of every child, all children who are delinquent 
cannot be expected to respond to the same form of treatment* 
Because of this, the reliance that has been placed by prov¬ 
incial officials on foster-home and farm work home placements

for treating delinquent boys has not been justified. In 
an earlier section it was pointed out that the system of 
foster-home and farm work home placements had not proved 
adequate for treating every delinquent boy. This system 
should be used only in those instances where it will meet 
the requirements of a delinquent boy. Other methods of 
treatment are required which will provide therapy of a 
specific kind, which is not available in a foster home. 

The continued use of foster homes for those boys who may 
benefit from such placements, demands that improvements 
should be made in the system to meet certain well-estab¬ 
lished standards. Such improvements ftould include the 
careful selection of foster homes after they have been 
thoroughly inspected, pre-placement work, and post-placement 
guidance and supervision to both, child and foster parents* 
To effect these improvements additional qualified person¬ 
nel are required to do the intensive case work that has 
proved to be a necessity in foster-home placement. 

The wide use of probation is highly commendable, 
especially where the probation officers are well-qualified 
by training or experience. British Columbia has set certain 
minimum standards for all probation officers appointed by 
the Probation Branch of the Attorney-General’s Department. 

No such standards for probation have been set by Alberta* 

The system of appointing probation officers throughout the 

province has resulted in a variety of qualifications of the

individuals attempting to do probation work. Difficulties 
in establishing uniform probation services are encountered 
because of geographic factors. At the present time much 
of the probation work in the outlying areas is carried on 
by the Inspectors of the Child Welfare Branch, who have 
other duties as well. In 1947, none of these workers employed 
by the Child Welfare Branch had special training to equip 
him for the work of probation. A circuit probation staff 
of qualified personnel could do the field service that is 
now done by the Inspectors. In British Columbia, such a 
staff of probation officers to do field service has proven 
highly satisfactory. ±n improving probation services in 
Alberta, it should be remembered that the case load of each 
probation officers should enable him to provide each del¬ 
inquent child in his care, with individual attention, super¬ 
vision and guidance. 

The rapid expansion of many towns and cities has res¬ 
ulted in a need for strengthening probation staffs, m 
those places where it is deemed feasible, permanent staffs 
should be appointed to carry on the wor^ or probation. 

For an adequate delinquency treatment program some form 
of institutional training for juvenile delinquents is a nec¬ 
essity. ideally, several small training schools, classified 
according to the nature of the training they provide and the 
age group of the boys they admit, would be most desirable, 
however, a single institution, built along modern lines

ana structurally designed to provide for the possibility 
of a varied form of training is perhaps most feasible. 

Such an institution could provide the specialized therapy 
that is needed by many delinquents, and which is not 
available in a foster home, in connection with an institu¬ 
tion for juvenile delinquents, Saskatchewan seems to have 
made considerable advances in recent years and may provide 
a model for an institution in Alberta. Such an institution 
would receive many of the boys who are now sentenced to 
the ward at the Provincial Mental Institute at Oliver, and 
could provide them with adequate training in a more whole¬ 
some environment. 

In connection with institutionalization, legislation 
should make provisions for a form of modified, indeterminate 
sentence to be used with juvenile delinquents. The length 
of time spent in an institution by a boy, should depend 
more on the progress that ne makes in the school, than on 
an initially fixed sentence. 

When a boy is released from an Institution he should 
be closely supervised during the post-treatment period. For 
such supervision, permanent mumbers of the probation staff, 
or qualified persons in the community who are keenly inter¬ 
ested in such work should be recruited. 

Alberta requires institutional facilities for older 
seriously delinquent boys, who are frequently sentenced to 
jail. The failure of the three Prairie Provinces to reach

an agreement adapted to the young offender group does not 
lessen the need for such an institution. The attempt to 
establish an institution in Western Canada for the hardened 
young offender should not be hampered by minor provincial 
differences. 

During the course of this study, Alberta announced plans 
and is now in the process of building an institution of min¬ 
imum-security type for a selected group of young offenders. 
This represents a significant advance in the attfflmpt to re¬ 
habilitate delinquent youths. However, training facilities 
will still be required for those young offenders who must 
be kept in a maximum-security institution. 

These suggested improvements in the existing facilities, 
as well as the suggested additional facilities are basic to 
an adequate delinquency program for the province. As has 
been indicated earlier, Alberta’s provisions for the treat¬ 
ment of juvenile delinquents and young offenders fall below 
the standards of many of the other provinces*

APPENDIX A

APPENDIX A 

The original purpose of this study was to attempt an 
evaluation of the methods of treating juvenile delinquents 
and suggest necessary improvements in the delinquency 
services of Alberta. Several difficulties were encoutered 
during the course of the study which will explain in part 
the virtual absence of statistical data that are usually 
a characteristic of studies such as this. 

This study was undertaken during one University session. 
The time available made it largely impossible to do follow¬ 
up studies of former delinquents who had received the ben¬ 
efits of one or more of the methods of treatment used in 
Alberta. To attempt an evaluation of such treatment methods 
as probation, warnings, suspended sentences, foster-home 
placement, farm work home placement, etc., between the 
years 1944 to 1949 would necessitate an extensive follow-up 
study of approximately 2500 juvenile delinquents. 

Early in the study it was discovered that juvenile 
court files give a minimum of information which would be of 
assistance in evaluating a particular method of treatment. 
Furthermore, as no cross-check is made between criminal 
court and juvenile court files, the criminal court records 
would have to be studied for the same period of time to 
discover whether or not a particular individual lapsed into 

further criminal activity after the treatment period recommended

by tiie juvenile court was over. 

All juvenile court records are kept by the Super¬ 
intendent of Child Welfare, and are not available for 
investigation without the explicit written authorization 
of the Minister of Public Welfare. Although no formal 
attempt was made to receive access to these files, inform¬ 
ation received from various officials indicated that perusal 
of juvenile court records would not be feasible. 

In the attempt to use statistical data in the course 
of the study, it was discovered that for several reasons, 
the statistics given by the Department of Public Welfare 
as well as the Judicial Branch of the Dominion Bureau of 
Statistics were of limited value. The Dominion Bureau 
gives figures for all juvenile delinquents up to the age 
of sixteen, which are reported by the juvenile courts. 
Delinquents above the age of sixteen are included in the 
statistics for criminals and are not separated by age 
groups for each province. The statistics of the Department 
of Public Welfare are given for delinquents up to the age 
of eighteen. Another difficulty is encountered in the fact 
that all juvenile courts do not make annual reports to the 
Dominion Bureau of Statistics, furthermore, the Dominion 
Bureau gives figures for all delinquents for the statistical 
year, which ends September 30th, whereas Departmental fig¬ 
ures within the province are given for the fiscal year end¬ 
ing in March.

When the difficulties of the proposed study became 
apparent, an attempt was made to evaluate the Alberta 
treatment methods on the basis of the success of similar 
methods used elsewhere. These methods were surveyed in the 
literature and a study was made of the statistical data 
which Showed the success of various forms of treatment. 
Several classic studies have been made attempting to 
evaluate delinquency treatment methods. On the basis of 
these studies, an attempt was made to estimate the degree 
of success that the methods used in. Alberta could be ex¬ 
pected to have, taking into consideration the standards 
that have been established in the province. r+ 

The provincial authorities have praised their Alberta 
method of treating juvenile delinquents highly, as is in¬ 
dicated in frequent press reports and statements issued by 
departmental officials. On the whole, the annual reports 
on delinquency in Alberta, as recorded in the Annual state¬ 
ments of the Department, convey the impression that the 
delinquency treatment services in the province are highly 
successful. These reports, unlike those in other provinces, 
are highly complimentary of the methods in use in the prov¬ 
ince, and are never critical of some of the limitations of 
existing facilities. 

It should be remembered that frequent statements 
issued by provincial authorities as to the relative merits 
of a particular form of treatment are based largely on

impression rather than on statistical data. Some of the 
information used in this study to discover the success of, 
and standards set by the various methods of treatment, was 
drawn from other studies and sources which were considered 
to be reliable. The Department could not give statistical 
information as to the number of recidivists among those who 
had been placed in foster homes, the number of boys who had 
left farm homes and left no record behind them, or the num¬ 
ber of boys who had been sentenced to jail since the term¬ 
ination of their treatment period. Som of the information 
given by the Departmental officials was contradictory when 
it was of a statistical kind. 

A copy of a questionnaire submitted to Mr. C. B. Hill, 
the provincial Superintendent of Child Welfare, and partially 
answered by Mr. A. H. Miller, the Deputy Minister of the 
Department of Public Welfare during an interview, is enclosed 
in Appendix B. Another list of questions which was answered 
by Mr. MacDaughton, the provincial Director of Boys 1 
Activities is given in Appendix C. 

Interviews with child welfare officials and the juvenile 
court judges in both, Ddmonton and Calgary were helpful in 
the attempt to evaluate the methods used and to determine 
the standards of these methods. Much of this information 
consisted of opinion and impressions rather than data sub¬ 
stantiated with statistics. However, these interviews were 
helpful in determining the standards of the work carried on

in Alberta. Several progressively minded individuals ex¬ 
pressed their regret at the low standards and inadequacy of 
the present delinquency treatment services. 

The factors mentioned above set definite limits to the 
scope of this study, in reviewing the research studies 
undertaken in other areas which proposed to evaluate sim¬ 
ilar treatment methods it was not uncommon to find contra¬ 
dictory results reported by different workers, in part, 
this is due to different criteria of success used in dif¬ 
ferent studies to evaluate the same method or methods of 
treatment. Frequently, a specific line of interest of a 
worker favouring one treatment nethod will result in a 
reported high degree of success. Other methods prove 
equally successful on the basis of criteria used by the 
individuals ravouring them. All research attempting to 
evaluate a particular method of treatment is limited by 
the factor of individual personality differences. This 
means, that in certain cases, such factors as maturation 
and growth of the individual, rather than a particular 
form of treatment have been responsible for the success. 
This sets a limit to the possibility of predicting the ab¬ 
solute success of a particular method of treating juvenile 
delinquents.
