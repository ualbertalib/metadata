ABSTRACT 


The cShief aim in this work is to show the governmental growth 
of a new province. The organization of the departments is the first 
concern, hut to understand the reasons for many developments a 
certain amount of background information must he known. 

As an introduction the first chapter is devoted to the events 
leading up to provincial status for the horth-west Territories, and 
the existing government, structure is briefly outlined* After 1905 
there was a period of about two years during which the government 
completed its original organization and established a systematized 
method of operation. By 1912 one cabinet had been replaced and a 
general reorganization was commenced. Two new departments were 
established to handle the complex administration of municipal affairs, 
railways and telephones. The influences exerted by the war, the 
United Farmers of Alberta, and various other factors were extensive, 
and during its last years the government was attempting to retain 
popularity by increasing its services, but at the same time huge 
deficits were being built up. A Public Health Department was estab¬ 
lished and other social services were added with the hope that the 
electorate would remain in the fold. The entry of the U.F.A. into 
the political field for the 1921 election resulted in the defeat of 
the Liberals. 

During the entire 1905-21 period as new functions were assumed 
by the departments they are indicated in the text and in the last 
appendix the final organization of the government in 1921 is shown 
in chart form to bring together all the preceding information.

PREFACE 


This thesis is presented with the hope that it will provide a 
groundwork for a hitherto neglected field—the organization and 
structure of the Alberta government. Unfortunately, in many 
respects it has turned out to be a rather negative field. The Depart¬ 
mental Annual Reports are practically the only source of organization¬ 
al data; therefore where these ore incomplete, or noh-existent, gaps 
necessarily^ occur. The worst offenders were the departments of the 
Attorney General and the Treasurer, which kept no annual records, and 
the Department of Railways and Telephones, which issued brief uninform¬ 
ative reports. The Public Accounts offered some hopes in the early 
stages, but the confusion and lack of consistency evident from year to 
year makes them of little value to show developments over the sixteen 
year period.

North West Territories

Acquisition of provincial status

In 1670 King Charles II granted to the Hudson's Bay Company 
the lands known as Rupert's Land and the North-West Territories. 
Provision was made in the British North America Act whereby, on 
request from the Canadian houses of Parliament, these lands might 
be admitted to the Union. After the payment of £3,000,000, certain 
land concessions and taxation guarantees, the Hudson's Bay territor¬ 
ies were turned over to the Dominion of Canada in 1870. This event 
was the start of the process by which the North-West Territories 
developed from personal rule to responsible government. 

For the first few years government was of a temporary nature. 

The Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba exercised an autocratic rule 
directed by the Secretary of State for the provinces. In the Domin¬ 
ion legislative session of 1872 an act was passed by which the North- 
West Territories were to be ruled by the Lieutenant Governor of Manit¬ 
oba and a council of eleven members, who were duly appointed and 
gazetted in 1873 as the first North-West Council. 

In 1873 the Act was amended to permit the Governor in Council 
to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the North- 
West Territories. Although understood to be merely provisional, the 
council did much to establish the policy which would prevail in the 
Territorial government. During the same year the North-West Council 
was increased from eleven to twenty-one. 

The meetings of the Council in this early period were held in 
camera due to the unstable condition of the country. Among the most 
urgent matters dealt with were measures providing for a police force 
and a degree of prohibition to combat the rising lawlessness which 
had gradually arisen because of the former lack of any law agency.

In 1875 Sir Alexander MacKenzie, the B:ime Minister of Canada, 
introduced a bill at Ottawa for the organization of the North-West 
Territories. It provided for a separate Lieutenant Governor and a 
council of five members. On October 7, 1876,the bill became law and 
the Territories received their own Lieutenant Governor, David Laird, 
who was to establish the council of the Territories. This council 
was to be nominative at first but to become partially elected in due 
time. During its existence, which was until 1887, the Council gave 
government similar to that of a Crown Colony; it was empowered to 
provide for the administration of justice, for popular representation, 

for creation of an elected Assembly, and to recommend judicial appoint- 

1 

ments. In 1881 the first elected member representing a district was 
admitted to the Council. This was the primary step in the transition 
to a legislative assembly. 

By the North-West Territories Act of 1888, the Territories receiv¬ 
ed a measure of responsible government. The North-West Council was 
replaced by the Legislative Assembly of the Territories, a twenty-two 
member body, elected from nineteen electoral districts. The Lieutenant 
Governor, who had formerly presided over the Council, gave his place 
to a speaker chosen from the Assembly by its own members. The Assembly 
was empowered to control electoral proceedings except the regulations 
respecting elections, and to direct territorial and municipal taxation. 
As well as these specific powers a number of other matters of local or 
private territorial concern became subject to control by ordinances 

1* Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, and Stipendary Magistrates.

of the Assembly. Members were to be elected for three years subject 
to earlier dissolution by the Lieutenant Governor. The act also prov¬ 
ided for a four man advisory council to be chosen from the Assembly by 
the Lieutenant Governor who, acting with it, would form the executive 
in financial matters. The functions of the advisory council resulted in 
a divergence of views between the Lieutenant Governor and the Assembly 
in 1889 and 1890. The Assembly wanted to achieve control over all 
financial matters by assuming final responsibility for all actions 
taken by the council in this regard. The Lieutenant Governor would not 
permit the council to tender advice on the expenditure of Dominion 
grants. The outcome was the replacement of the advisory council by a 
four man executive committee chosen by the Lieutenant Governor. This 
was later improved when the executive committee was appointed on the 
floor of the house. 

Difficulties in its construction and limitations in its power were 
soon felt by the new legislature. The problem of the liquor question 
was demanding immediate attention but the authority to initiate a 
plebiscite between prohibition and sale by license was beyond the con¬ 
stitutional powers of the Assembly. Pear of conflict between the 
Dominion immigration policy and local affairs was prevalent. The 
Territories could not charter railways, administer criminal justice 
or borrow money upon their sole credit. All the territorial assets 
were in the hands of the Dominion, leaving the Territories in a state of 
almost complete dependency. 

In the period from 1892 to 1897 the Territories made some progress 
toward attaining a responsible government. In 1897, by Dominion 
legislation, an executive council replaced the executive committee. 

This council was chosen from a legislative body made up entirely of

elected members and each member of the council was forced to stand for 
re-election upon his appointment. 

She restrictions imposed by territorial status remained a sore 
point with the North-West Territories. Their aspirations for autonomy 
were provoked still further by financial difficulties. The executive 
council was therefore the leader in the agitation for constitutional 
change. In many respects the autonomy demands ran parallel with those 
which had been presented to the English parliament in the fight for 
Dominion status. These arguments were met by the same answers and 
reluctance from the federal government. One particularly aggravating 
matter was that since the Territories, like Manitoba, were not given 
control of their natural resources or public lands, they deserved better 
terms in their annual subsidy. All arguments were to no avail, the 
Dominion government continued placidly ignoring them, as governments 
often do when no danger threatens them. 

The Premier of the Territories, Mr. F. ¥. G. Haultain, was the 
spark from 1898 on, in setting the stage for provincial status. All 
informed observers, including the Dominion government, could see that 
a state was being reached in which positive steps toward autonomy would 
be imperative. The temper of the Territorial Government and the 
accompanying financial crises were such that responsible legislature and 
executive, and the power to borrow and assume other provincial rights, 
could not be delayed much longer. 

The successful Pominion immigration policy created new problems 
for the executive council. Instead of going to established settlements 
the newcomers settled in new areas, along projected railway lines or in 
low-priced undeveloped areas; this created new problems in municipal

costs which the Territorial revenues could not handle. Although the 
Dominion grant was doubled it remained hopelessly inadequate. 

It was felt in the Territories that until autonomy was won, a solid 
front should be presented to the Dominion. Party politics were suppress¬ 
ed in the desire to unite for a common aim. Regardless of these binding 
influences such disagreements as opposition to a westward expansion of 
Manitoba, and unsettled opinion as to whether one, two or three provinces 
should be established, could not be kept quiet. These difficulties and 
the burning separate school question were taken by the Dominion as 
reasons not to rush into autonomy measures. After the long yeqrs of 
inaction the issue eventually was faced squarely on February 31, 1905, 
when Sir Wilfred Maurier brought down his measure for granting provincial 
autonomy to the Territories. The Bill provided for the division of the 
Territories into two provinces, Saskatchewan and Alberta. Ownership of 
the Grown Lands was to remain vested in the Dominion. 

The financial arrangements proposed to grant: 

$ 50,000 per province for civil government 

200,000 capitation allowance (to increase pro-rata until the pop¬ 
ulation reached 8,000,000) 

405,375 debt allowance 
_ 375.000 in lieu of public lands 

$1.030,575 total, plus an additional $62,500 per province per year 
for five years for construction of buildings and public works. 

The section dealing with the school system was so controversial 
that before it was settled it almost caused a split in the Dominion 

2. This was to continue as a problem long after Alberta be cane a Province.

cabinet* The agitation in the form of religious feeling and sectarian 
passion, resolutions of lodges and societies and newspaper discussions, 
reached such a pitch that Sir Wilfred Laurier finally introduced a 
compromise clause. The original draft Bill provided for the establish¬ 
ment and maintenance of separate schools. The final Bill, however, did 
no more than enact that rights and privileges in this matter already in 
force should be continued# 

Besides the strictly religious feelings aroused by the educational 

clauses there was another perhaps more important underlying principle 

involved* By its wording the Bill appeared to be imposing a separate 

school system upon the Territories, not merely crystallizing existing 

arrangements* In an open letter to the Prime Minister, Haultain contended 

that the question at stake was not the religious rights of minorities 

4 

but the constitutional rights of provinces* Throughout the controversy 
the residents of the Territories, who were most directly concerned, 
remained comparatively disinterested* With the exception of editors and 
politicians they were satisfied with the existing arrangements and 
governing body, and were content to let the future iron itself out* 

Although the fi&ht continued, the new clause served to reunite the 
Cabinet, and on July 5, 1905,the Bill was passed by the house of Commons 
and on July 20 by the Senate* On August 25, Mr* G* H* V* Bulyea was 
gazetted Lieutenant Governor of Alberta and on September 1, the provinces 
of Alberta and Saskatchewan came into existence. 

The Ordinances of the ETorth-West Territories in effect prior to 
the acquisition of provincial status made the following provision for 
the executive body: The Executive Council of the Territories was to be

a body appointed by the .Lieutenant Governor and removable at his 
pleasure. This council was given the power to advise and aid the 
Lieutenant Governor in performing any function formerly within the 
jurisdiction of the Lieutenant Governor and Executive Committee* By 
forcing the members of the council to submit to re-election upon 
accepting office the principle of responsible government was achieved* 

The ordinance dealing with the public service provided that the 
Territorial Public Service would consist of the Clerk of the Legislat¬ 
ive Assembly, the Territorial Auditors and the members of the following 
departments: 

(a) Office of the Executive Council. 

(b) Department of the Attorney General* 

(c) Department of the Territorial Secretary. 

(d) Department of the Treasurer. 

(e) Department of Public Works* 

(f) Department of Agriculture• 

(g) Department of Education* 

(h) Offices of the Legislative Assembly. 

The department heads normally were to be the members of the 
Executive Council presiding over the departments assigned to them* 

Their duties were to oversee and direct department employees, to 
have general control and to perform other duties assigned by the 
Lieutenant Governer in Council. In the absence of the department 
heads their duties were to be assumed by the deputy or assistant, 
unless an acting head was appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in 
Council. 

The departments were to be organized in a hierarchy of rank 
under the department head as follows:

It lay within the power of the lieutenant Governor in Council 
to divide any department into as many divisions as appeared most 
convenient for efficient functioning of the service. 

Attorney General f s Department: Under the terms of the Attorney 
General's Ordinance the functions of the Attorney General were as 
follows: to assume charge of the legal matters of the Territorial 
Government; to tender advice to the lieutenant Governor; the Legis¬ 
lative Assembly and the department heads; to be responsible for all 
instruments issued under the Territorial seal; to conduct and regulate 
all litigation for or against the G rown or any public department within 
the jurisdiction of the Legislative Assembly; to superintend the 
administration of justice in matters within the authority of the 
Territories. 

The expenses for the eight months ending August 31, 1905,amounted 

to $5,937.86 of which $5,053.33 went toward salaries and $884.53 

4 

comprised additional expenses. There were seven members on the staff 
during this period. 

The Territorial Secretary's Department was set up by the Territorial 
Secretary's Ordinance. The department was to be headed by an 
appointed member of the Executive Council, whose duties were to be 
the same as those assigned by law or ouston to the Provincial Secret¬ 
ary or Registrar in the provinces. Ee was to be keeper of the

Territorial seal, to issue all letters patent, commissions and 
other documents and to countersign all except those countersigned 
by the Clerk of the Executive Council. He was to he keeper of all 
registers and archives of the Territories. 

As the Territorial Registrar the Secretary was assigned the 
duty of registering all instruments of summons, commissions, letters 
patent, writs and other instruments and documents issued under the 
seal of the Territories. His signature was to serve as proof of the 
existence and legality of such documents. Any copy of a document which 
he had officially signed was to he equivalent to the original in anjr 
court in the Territories. 

The Secretary^ Department was comparatively small, being 
composed of the Assistant Secretary and two clerks who received a 
combined salary of $1989.99 for the year 1904, during which period 
the miscellaneous expenses were only $119.01. 

The Department of Agriculture was granted the power to administer 
matters classified as agriculture, statistics and the public health, 
including hospitals. It was empowered to institute enquiries and 
collect facts and statistics relating to agriculture, manufacturing 
and other interests of the Territories and to adopt measures for 
circulating and disseminating these to promote territorial progress. 

The enforcement of ordinances relating to agriculture, statistics 
and public health was also a duty of the department. 

All officers of all agricultural societies, municipal councils, 
local improvement districts, school boards, public institutions, 
incorporated companies and all public officers of the Territories 
and all medical practitioners and veterinary surgeons were legally 
bound to answer promptly all communications from the department and

to collect and report facta according to departmental instructions. 

The amount of work and the staff of the Department of Agriculture 

were approximately doubled between 1899 and 1904. The permanent staff 

in 1899 consisted of one chief clerk, two accountants, one clerk in 

charge of branch records, one clerk in charge of correspondence records, 

one stenographer and occasional extra assistants. The Territorial 

inspector of Noxious weeds was employed inside to some extent on 

5 

administration of the Noxious Weeds Ordinance. By 1902 it was evident 
that departmental reorganization would be necessary in the near future 
to alleviate the increasing difficulties being encountered in attempts 
to combine the outside, or technical and the inside, or administrative 
duties. It was stressed that the line between the technical and admin¬ 
istrative branches must be more sharply drawn and the deputy relieved 
of the bulk of the outside work in order to free him to devote individual 
attention to administrative affairs, which would include providing 
adequate technical assistance. This recommendation was followed the 

ensuing year when a Superintendent of Fairs and Institutes was appointed 

6 

to assume some of the technical burdens. It was also suggested that 
the Department publish a quarterly official journal for general distrib¬ 
ution. 

The Depa r tment of Tublie Works was headed by a Commissioner who was 
to administer the department and manage and direct the construction, 
heating, lighting, furnishing, maintenance and repair of all government 
buildings. He was to direct all public works; the issue of all maps and

plans needed by the government in the North-West Territories, all 
questions of road allowances, crossing of roads by irrigation ditches, 
canals* etc., and various other duties assigned by the Lieutenant 
Governor in Council. 

The demands made upon the department were extensive and increasing. 

under the provision of the new Local Improvement Ordinance, which 

gave increased powers to local organization, it appeared certain that 

minor work^s would be carried out at a local level, leaving more 

important works to the department. 

Between 1898 and 1903 the expenditures of the department increased 

7 

from $129,046 to $392,220—a growth of 188.44^. As well as being 
faced with this tremendous increase in expenditures to keep pace with 
the growth of the country, the works of previous years became a charge 
on the department in providing repairs and maintenance. In an effort 
to meet these conditions the department was reorganized by delegating 
specific work to certain members of the staff, thus training each in 
a special line to promote greater efficiency and promptness in depart¬ 
mental administration. The six primary divisions were: 

(1). The Gorrespondence Branch, with a staff of four headed by a clerk 

handled most of the correspondence, which as early as 1903 amounted to 

8 

140,929 communications fcr the year, or 463 per day. The correspondence 
work was eased considerably by the formation of two' subdivisions to 
handle two increasingly complex ordinances. The administration of the 
Coal ^-ines Regulation Ordinance was complicated enough to justify 
the formation of a new branch under the direct supervision of the 
Deputy Commissioner. In addition to the administrative staff an

inspector was employed to enforce compliance with the law and 
promotion of safety measures. Examinations to determine the 
qualifications of miners were conducted hy this branch. The Steam 
Boilers Ordinance similarly .commenced operations as a branch, with 
a clerk in charge of administration and four inspectors in the field 
to inspect the growing numbers of boilers and to conduct examinations 
among the steam engineers of the Territories. 

(2) . The Accountants Branch was staffed by one accountant in charge, 
one assistant accountant and one clerk. They handled all department¬ 
al financial transactions, which included the collection of the 
department revenue, paying for work in Large Local Improvement 
Districts, collection of overdue taxes in Small Local Improvement 
Districts and payment to the proper districts. Of the total amount 
dealt with through the books of the department during 1903 and 1904, 
only about 3.3% was expended for the departmental administrative 
staff. This small percentage was attributed by the Deputy Commission¬ 
er to efficient administration in the affairs of the department, 

9 

not to low pay rates. The possibilities of understaffing or over¬ 
spending were not discussed. 

(3) . The Surveys Branch was divided into two parts—the inside 
division staffed by one surveyor and two clerk-stenographera, and 
the outside division which consisted of eight district surveyors 
and engineers. The branch was responsible for planning, conducting 
and recording surveys throughout the Territories and for arranging 
rights of way for road allowances and other matters related to the 
work of surveying.

(4) * The Engineering Branch fill’od a position of major importance 
to the department* In charge was an engineer with a draughtsman 
for his chief assistant* Clerks were made responsible for the 
keeping of general records, road improvements and boring records, 
and fireguard records; routine clerical work was handled by a 
stenographer* The major works dealt with by this branch under the 
Territorial regime were bridges and roads, which included both 
construction and maintenance* A Drainage Ordinance, passed in 1903, 
took into account the necessity of assessing the lands adjacent to, and 
receiving benefits from,ditches and drains, in order to make these 
beneficiaries pay a fair share of the costs of such works* To carry 
out all the duties stipulated by the ordinance a drainage engineer 
was appointed* 

(5) * The Local Improvement Branch operated under the supervision 

of a chief clerk, and was staffed by one cashier, one accountant, 

nine clerks and two stenographers* The staff was constantly being 

increased, but was nevertheless hard pressed to keep up with its 

duties. By the Start of 1904 there were 456 Small Local Improvement 

10 

Districts in existence. They were organized to carry out local 
improvements such as grading, clearing and fireguarding roads, build¬ 
ing and repairing bridges, culverts and dams^ filling sloughs. They 
also collected land taxes and statutory labor in commutation of taxes* 

(6) . ‘The Irrigation Office was staffed by two engineers, one draught- 
sman and one clerk* The correspondence and office work consisted 
chiefly of receiving applications for water rights, recording licenses 
of occupation for rights of way for irrigation works over Crown Lands, 

10. Districts were organized voluntarily during 1890-96; by 
compulsion for 1897-1901; by subdivision in 1902.

and recording returns respecting hydrographic records. By 1903 

there were, in the Territories, 167 canals and ditches that extended for 

480 miles, 4,125,000 acres susceptible of irrigation from canals 

and ditches, and 163 water rights recorded for power and other purposes. 

T he Department of Education Was created by the School Ordinance 

of 1901. It was presided over by a Commissioner, who was a member 

of the executive council and who alone had executive power, although 

he was advised and assisted by a five man education council. The 

department was given the control and management of all kindergarten 

schools, public and separate schools, normal schools, teachers* 

institutes, and the education of deaf, deaf mute and blind persons. 

The Commissioner, with the approval of the Lieutenant Governor 

in Council,was given the power to regulate the department in all 

matters pertaining to the operation, construction and maintenance of 

schools, and to provide and control teacher training and other matters 

regulating teachers. The Department of Education in 1903 had the 
11 

following staffs

school districts, alterations in their boundaries, supply of 
teachers, debentures, and kindred subjects* The rush of settle¬ 
ment and consequent increase in demands for education, and the 
importance of prompt attention to enquiries pertaining to early 
organization of schools made it necessary to confine departmental 
activities to these matters and other essential routine work. Other 
important considerations were, therefore, necessarily neglected. 
l*he organization of school districts was increasing so rapidly 
that the department felt a strain on its capabilities. The number 
of new districts formed per year increased from a previous maximum 

of 51 in 1899 to 83 in 1901, 119 in 1902, 166 in 1903, and 237 in 

12 

1904; a total of 743 districts had schools in operation in 1904. 

‘l r o cope with increased burdens and responsibilities the office staff 
was increased in 1903, additional .Normal Schools were created, new 
inspectors were hired and legislative provision was made for increased 
school grants. 

The treasury Department was to have th© management and control of 
the revenue and expenditure of the Territories under th© direction 
of the Treasurer. The territorial accounts were to be kept in the 
‘treasury Department under the control of the Treasurer, subject to 
orders of the Lieutenant Governor or Order-in-Council. 

The department, under direction of the Treasurer, was to prepare 
and submit to the Legislative Assembly at the end of each fiscal year 
a statement of the public accounts showing the revenues and expendit - 
ures of the Territories for the year and the state of the general revenue 
fund and all trust and special funds under the management of the 
Territ orial G overnment.

The existing territorial government structure was able to 
provide a small hut experienced group to carry on both Legislative 
and Executive functions in the new provincial governments. The 
existence of a working government helped to alleviate the difficult¬ 
ies which would have been encountered in attempting to set up 
departments with no precedents to use for guides. As conditions 
were, the provinces were able to make the change with a minimum of 
upheaval, although the extra work involved was at times extensive.

CHAPTER II 
Alberta, 1905-11 

Organizational period 1905, 1906, 1907 
Establishment of departments on more permanent basis 
Upset of Rutherford government 




18 


During the Liberal regime in Alberta from 1905 to 1921, 

the electorate acquired, a political point of view which has 

served to lower the old line parties into a position of secondary 

importance in provincial affairs* The period may be divided 

1 

into three clear-cut divisions from a political viewpoint. The 

years 1905-09 were placid and reasonably progressive under the 

administration of the Rutherford government* In 1910 the Alberta 

and Great Waterways Railway incident ended the restraining influence 

of Premier Rutherford, and allowed the more radical tendencies of 

the province to acquire a foothold* The third period, from 1911 

to 1921, is one of Liberal decline* Since the railway incident 

2 

and the resultant split in the party dragged on until 1912, the 
period of crisis could also be considered to have lasted until that 
year, when the cabinet schism was healed and Libera,! power appeared 
to be on the ascent again* 

•A similar chronological division could hardly be made of the 
Executive branch of the government# This resulted from the constant 
ly increasing burden of government, which made it essential that 
departments continue to expand and fulfill their functions despite 
political fluctuations* As well as the normal growth there was an 
increase in the demands of the farmers, which forced great develop¬ 
ment of the executive functions during the years of the most rapid 
political decline of the Liberal party# By the time the trouble

of 1910 arose the government had succeeded in creating a solid 
institutional framework upon which new duties could be safely super¬ 
imposed as the need arose* Development continued comparatively 
smoothly through the upheaval, and it was not until May 4, 1912, 
that any important departmental reorganization took place, although 
the cabinet had been completely replaced in 1910. 

The most important background forces at work during the Liberal 

3 

regime were tremendous population growth until 1914, the overwhelmingly 
agrarian economy, based almost excusively on wheat, problems incurred 
by the war such as loss of markets and immigrants, demand for wheat etc. 
and finally the rising strength of the U.I.A. 

In 1905 with a Liberal government in Ottawa and G. H. V. Bulyea 
as the new Lieutenant Governor of Alberta, it was not unexpected when 
the leader of the provincial Liberal party was called upon to form the 
first government of the Province. On September 9, 1905,the first Alberta 
government was gazetted as follows: 

Hon. A. C. Rutherford—Prime Minister, Minister of Education and 

Provincial Treasurer 

Hon. C. W. Cross—Attorney General 

Hon, W. H. Cushing'—Minister of Public Works 

Hon* W. T, Einlay—Minister of Agriculture and Provincial Secretary. 

Hon, L. G. DeVeber —Minister without Portfolio 
Judicial administration was led by the Hon. A. L. Sifton, Chief Justice. 

Of thaee men. Cross, Sifton and Rutherford were to rank far above 
the others in future political affairs. The former two retained

positions of influence almost to the end of the Liberal regime. 

Mr. Rutherford was a solid, successful Strathcona lawyer who 
was to be expected to conduct his party with reserve and honesty. 

Mr. Cross was a young, capable Edmonton attorney who had been active 
in local politics, and who commanded a wide and loyal following. 

The new government was not without experience; Rutherford, Firifey 
and DeVeber had been active in the territorial government; Cross and 
Cushing had political backgrounds obtained in local politics in Calgary 
and Edmonton. The civil service was formed around a nucleus of former 
territorial employees, but because of the distance- from Regina few of 
the territorial government employees, especially in the lower salary 
brackets, could be moved to Edmonton. Those who were transferred, usually 
with substantial promotions, provided an experienced foundation to which 
additional staff members could be added as required. Deputies wer$ 
appointed in each of the departments of Public forks, Education, Agric¬ 
ulture, Attorney General, Provincial Secretary. A clerk of the Executive 
Council, a Provincial Auditor and a Chief Clerk of Public Works were also 
appointed• 

Following the formation of the cabinet the government immediately 
plunged into electioneering activities. As an existing government the 
Liberals were at a decided advantage. They emphasized their desire to 
develop provincial resources and maintain political stability, and on the 
negative side they claimed that the opposition was bent upon a disturbing 
period of race and creed agitation, and constitution&l conflicts. The 
Conservatives, under the leadership of R. B» Bennett, desperately groped 
for some campaign issues and finally came up with a resolution 
favouring freedom and control of public lands*, subsequently they made

a charge that the Liberals were guilty of gerrymandering constit¬ 
uencies, and that, through a partisan Lieutenant Governor, a govern- 

4 

ment had been appointed that was controlled by Federal authorities. 

There had been a gradual backsliding from Haultain*s policy of 
ignoring party issues in the provincial field. DeVeber and a number 
of prominent members of both parties deprecated party politics, but 
they were overruled by the more eager politicians of the province. 
During the first Alberta Liberal Convention, in August 1905, it was 
decided that party politics would be followed with a clear enunciat¬ 
ion of party policy, and that candidates would be placed in every 
constituency for the coming elections* The challenge was accepted 
by the Conservatives and party strife entered the Alberta political 
arena. 

The result of the ©lection was a Liberal landslide* They had 

5 

23 members elected, generally by healthy majorities# Only two 
opposition members were elected, a Conservative and an Independent. 

The defeat of the Conservative leader, R. B. Bennett, was on© of the 
major blows to that party. The attempt to explain the election out¬ 
come provoked an interchange of conflicting ideas. Frank Oliver*s 
Ed mon ton Bulletin stated on November 21, that the election revealed 
that the school and Land clauses were not of sufficient public concern 
to override other really important matters. This was denied by the 
Conservatives, who contended that these issues had been sidetracked 
by the conflict between north and south over the location of the 

4 • Can adian Annual Review , 1905, £.239, (henceforth C.A.R.) . 

5. These majorities were smaller in Southern Alberta, the stronghold 
of Conservatism.

capital. In all probability, judging from the previous unconcern, 
of the public toward the school question, this wag not important 
enough to override the advantage held by the Liberals in already 
being in power. There were no grounds for throwing out the Liberals, 
who had so far committed no evil, and who were making an acceptable 
start in organizing a new government. 

The four months remaining in 1905 were not especially notable 
for progressive government activity. The political contest took a 
good deal of attention and the departments were all busy with reorgan¬ 
ization and training new staffs. To a large extent therefore, the 
departmental programs formulated and commenced at the beginning of 
the year were carried out with no attempt to introduce innovations. 

In 1906, with the elections disposed of, the government was able to 
commence work virtually unhampered by opposition in view of its 133—2 
majoriti^. Policy was one of quiet work along constructive lines. 

Much legislation was'necessary, and public departments, institutions, 
buildings and a general system of administration had to be built up 
in detail. Besides the three previously mentioned cabinet members 
there were seven members of the new assembly with legislative experience 
in the Territories. The uncomplicated political atmosphere during the 
years 1906-09 made possible a gradual growth sufficient to enable the 
government to handle the increasing demands of the electorate as far 
as physical limitations permitted. 

The addition of the organizational activities to the routine duties 
of all departments meant that 1906 and 19 07 were exceptionally b^usy years, 
during 1908, most of the original stabilizing process was completed 
and from then until 1912 the chiSf concern wag with consolidation 
and normal growth. The development of the departments in

their formative years is presented below, covering the time from 
the inauguration of the province until 1912, during which year a 
general reorganization was made. 

THE DEPARTMENT Off AGRICULTURE 

The staff in September 1905, consisted of the Deputy Minister 

and two clerks, whose principal duties were to systematize and 

arrange the files and records forwarded from Regina, and to make 

plans for the methods of conducting new work. Reports fro®, the 

various branches were received and tabulated and as far as possible 

everything was arranged for the extensive activities planned for 

1906. By the first of 1906 the office staff had been increased to 

six clerks and during the year the total number of regular employees 
6 

reached *87. The work throughout the year dealt primarily with the 

large scale organization necessary to carry out the government’s 

agricultural policies. Ten new branches were organized, eight of 

which continued under their own branch heads. The early work of the 

Department can be best estimated by looking at the Ordinances which 

7 

it had to administer in 1906. These were as follows: 

1. Pound District Ordinance 

2. Stray Animals Ordinance 

8 

3. Entire Animals Ordinance 

4. Stock Inspection Ordinance 

5. Herd Ordinance 

6. Horse Breeders Ordinance

The structure of the Department was fairly solidly established 

by 1907 and operations could be conducted by the various branches 

wit& little of the prevailing confusion of the earlier years. The 

9 

branches existing in 1907 were as follows* 

The Deputy Minister*s Office handled all activities which were not 
assigned to other branches. Much of this work was miscellaneous 
and not readily classifiable, but in all cases was closely related 
to that of the branches. Distinction was often made arbitrarily to 
conform to the capacity of the branches, which were often hampered 
by space limitations and awkward office arrangements. As well as 
directly supervising the work of this “general H office, the Deputy 
Minister waa responsible to the Minister for all the functions of 
the section heads below him in the hierarchy of the Department. By

A clerk to be known as the Statistician was placed in charge 
of all agricultural statistics, births, marriages and deaths. The 
vital statistics system was revised and re-indexed to improve access 
ibility. Another clerk was assigned responsibility for all work 
relating to Stray and Entire Animals, Pound, Herd and Bull Districts 
and the Horse Breeders Ordinance. His duties also included the 
considerable task of organizing a new departmental library and all 
the functions that would normally fall to a qualified librarian. 

The Dairy Commissioner was appointed on March 1, 1906, to operate 
from Calgary, and with his duties assigned to him in advance. For 
some years the Dominion Department of Agriculture had supervised a 
number of cooperatively owned creameries in Alberta after they had 
begun to collapse under private ownership. Upon receiving notice 
that such assistance would be discontinued on May 1, 1906, a convent¬ 
ion of delegates from the creameries requested that the province 

assume this function. The request was granted and the 12 creameries

concerned were taken over, under the control of the former Dominion 
superintendent, who also agreed to take charge of all government dairy 
work. Hy the end of 1906 there were eighteen government and twenty-four 
private creameries, producing 1,960,000 pounds of butter. Seven cheese 
factories and numerous private dairies completed the commercial dairying 
industry of the province. 

The Chief Inspector of Noxious Weed s fulfilled a function that 
is fundamental to any department of agriculture. He was appointed 
on April 1, 1906, to see that vigorous measures were enforced to 
combat the ever-present weed menace. The first measures taken by 
the new chief inspector were to divide the province into suitable 
inspection districts, completely reorganizing the inspection system. 
Twenty-seven new men were appointed to bring the inspection staff 
to forty-two. 

The Chief Game and Hire Guardian were faced with a problem in 
enforcing the Game Ordinance. On January 1, 1907, there were 218 game 
guardians in the province, as well as all the members of the Royal North¬ 
west Mounted Police who had equal powers. The police were efficient in 
enforcing compliance but the other guardians were not on salary, and 
for various reasons, often personal in nature, were reluctant about 
laying charges. A start was made, therefore, toward obtaining 
full-time, salaried guardians. It was also decided that these 
same men could also be appointed a,s prairie fire rangers and

arrangements were made with the Saskatchewan Department of Agric¬ 
ulture to continue the Registration of brands in Regina until other 
arrangements were made. Since three quarters of the recorded brands 
were held in Alberta, the Saskatchewan government agreed to the 
removal of the brand office to Medicine Hat and the continuation 
of a joint office. A new Recorder of Brands was appointed for both 
provinces. His staff was occupied throughout the first year in re¬ 
indexing and dividing the records of the two provinces. The task 
of consolidating records was difficult and time consuming, since 
in 1906 there were 31,000 brands recorded and the work of the office 
had increased by W% over any previous year. 

Poultry Branch . Educational work was the main concern of this 
branch which commenced operations following the appointment of a 
Poultry Superintendent on July 1, 1906. Awards were placed and 
poultry shows and institute meetings were provided with educational 
poultry exhibits. A marked emphasis was placed upon increasing 
correspondence which dealt with requests for advice on general poultry 
raising problems as well as queries as to markets and suppliers of 
poultry and eggs. A poultry bulletin was first published iri 1907. 

Superintendent of ffairs & Institutes . A strong departmental 
policy was that of making available to the farmer information as to 
the latest and most advanced methods of pursuing his work and 
preparing and marketing his products. With such knowledge it was 
presumed that the farmers could make the best possible use of their 
resources in any situation. In keeping with this theory a progress¬ 
ive educational policy was followed. The work of the Superintendent 
was to arrange for qualified speakers for stock judging schools,

institute meetings and various other gatherings which could assist 
the farmers. 

Provincial Health Officer . The first of three branches of the 
Department of Agriculture to enter into the field of public health, 
which curiously was given to the department, was this office. Early 
in 1906 the department appointed a Public Health Officer, who immediately 
began to organize his branch. He was unable to proceed as fuljy as 
was desirable due to the limitations imposed by the Public Health 
Ordinance, under which the Dominion government undertook the work 
of stamping out contagious diseases. A few amendments were made in 
the Ordinance and during the year a completely new Public Health Act 
was drafted, suitable to the requirements of the province. A large 
part of the time of the Provincial Health Officer in 1907 was taken 
up with the Provincial Board of Health in drafting rules and regulat¬ 
ions for the carrying into effect of the Public Health Act. The 
Provincial Board of Health was itself formed on July 26, 1907* under 
the provisions of the new act. 

Sanitary Engineer . In connection with the care of the public 
health, problems respecting the water supply, sewage disposal, plumbing 
etc.,had arisen, and with a continued rapid population growth in 
prospect, the need for a proper solution for these matters was urgent. 

It wax therefore decided that a sanitary engineer was essential. A 
qualified engineer waa accordingly employed and immediately made a 
member of the Provincial Board of Health so his experience could be 
utilized by that body. Rules and regulations pertaining to sanitary 
engineering were drafted for the Board of Health; water supply, sewage 
and sewage disposal problems of various cities were investigated and 
future requirements considered. Advice on sewage disposal was freely

given to private firms and individuals and several plans for the 
disposal of trade wastes were considered and approved* 

Director of the Provincial Laboratory * During 1906 Alberta 
shared the expenses and facilities of the former Territorial 
Bacteriological Laboratory at Regina* By early 1907 it was seen 
that the large quantity of work and the delays in receiving returns 
from the examination of water, swabs and other specimens were 
sufficient grounds to justify the establishment of a laboratory in 
Alberta. Provision was made for this in the budget and a bacteriol¬ 
ogist and analyst was selected who later became Director of the 
Provincial Laboratory. In his first report the Director enumerated 
the functions the laboratory should fulfill as a branch of the 
Department of Agriculture. It was,he said, primarily to carry on 
work and investigate problems in the interests of the public health, 
the administration of justice and the agricultural welfare of the 
province. Its duties would thus include examinations to aid in 
the diagnosis of contagious and infectious diseases in man; chemical 
and bacterial examination of public milk supplies; examination of 
foodstuffs suspected of being injurious to health if used for food; 
investigation of subjects relating to agriculture; analysis of liquor 
and medico-legal examinations for the Attorney General’s Department. 
He said that the requirements for these purposes would be developed 
in the order of the urgency and the extent of the interest involved. 
Public and provincial matters would be done gratuitously and as an 
accomodation to interested parties the laboratory would also make 
examinations of pathological fluids and tissues from cases of non- 
contagious diseases, for which a small fee would be charged.

Live Stock Commissi oner. During 1906-07 a Chief Stock Inspector 
was employed to visit and instruct local inspectors and to see that 
butchers were keeping the necessary records of brands as required by 
the Stock Inspection Ordinance. On May 20, 1908, a Provincial Live 
Stock Commissioner was appointed whose duties were, in particular, 
to assist the farmers and small stockmen in marketing their livestock; 
to ascertain as far as possible the difficulties in the way of small 
stockmen and to assist in removing them; to attempt to improve general 
livestock conditions in Alberta. 

Other Ac ti viti e s in Agricul t ure 19 06-11. In 1906 legislation 
introduced by the Minister of Agriculture proposed to establish 
stringent stock inspection in order to check the growing cattle 
rustling industry in the south of the province. Its most widely 
felt regulation provided that a person having cattle in transit 
must possess either a Brand Recorder’s certificate or a bill of sale 
from the vendor. 

Numerous allegations had been made that P. Burns and Company 

of Calgary had a monopoly or combine which virtually controlled the 

“10 

western beef industry. The Calgary Heral d of August 3, 1906, said 
that the allegations "may or may not be true:'’; however^ it was 
certain that many smaller operators had been absorbed by under sellings 
It was also said that freight rates favored the large dealers. Burns 
in particular having their own sidings and volume enough to take 
entire freight cars for bulk shipments. Conditions of this nature 
prevailed in all four western provinces. On October 12, the Alberta 
government gazetted an Inter-Provincial Commission in conjunction

with Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British Columbia. The duties of 
this Commission were to inquire into, investigate and report upon 
the purchase and sale, both wholesale and retail, of sheep, cattle 
and meat in the province and in the West generally; to investigate 
the industry or trade connected therewith and the conditions affect¬ 
ing or regulating the prices and to look into the existence of any 
possible combination in restraint of trade in these matters. The 
Beef Commission was, in fact, attempting to find out why prices were 

rising to the consumer and decreasing to the producer. Eventually 

11 

only Alberta and Manitoba agreed to go into the inquiry. 

The results found after examining extensive evidence gave a 
thorough picture of the industry in the province. The grievances 
of the large rancher—raising 300 to 2,000 cattle yearly— included 
delays, car shortage, lack of feeding facilities and rough treatment 
of animals by the railways; dishonest commission merchants; uncertain 
British market; generally deteriorated meat caused by the long train 
haul. Small producers were troubled by shipping discrimination, 
absence of assured safety for cattle and difficulty in disposing of 
small lots. The Report was made public on December 26, 1907, and 
some of the major findings were a decline in Alberta f s sheep 
industry; dissatisfaction amongst pork producers owing to la&k of 
confidence in the market: lack of progressiveness of stock-men 

generally; heavy losses of small shippers; an unsatisfactory system 

12 

of brand inspection. The final decision of the Commission was 
that no combine existed.

By 1908 the first wave of organizational activity had died 
down to he replaced by a completing and rounding out period. When 
the Hon. W. T. Finlay resigned as Minister of Agriculture in 1909 
the department had achieved stability in its functions and increased 
its staff from three to over fifty members. 

The U.F.A. was organized at Edmonton on June 14-15, 1909,by 
the union of the Alberta Farmers* Association and the Canadian Society 
of Equity, with a total membership of 5,000. Among the Resolutions 
passed was one urging the government to establish a pork-packing 
industry as advised by the Alberta Pork Commission. On July 3, 1908, 
the Commission had been appointed to inquire into the pork industry^ 
its marketing cohditions and handling, and in general to report on 
the best means of ensuring a fair price for the producers. Early in 
1909 the Commission reported that farmers could not receive a fair 
price for hogs, and often could not receive any price at all and 
could overstock the market with ease, while 75$ of the cured meat 
sold was imported. They concluded that when a sufficient number of 
producers could give assurance that they could supply at least 50,000 
hogs per year to the plant, the government should furnish money to 
build, equip and operate a government pork-packers establishment, 
which would take the hogs, pay up to two thirds of estimated value 
at delivery, place them on the market at regular intervals, and pay 
the producer the balance, less service charges. Early in 1910 the 
Premier announced that the recommendation would be followed providing 
sufficient animals were guaranteed. 

The most significant expansion in the department during 1910

was the organization of the Publicity Bureau early in the year. It 
served as a large scale replacement for the immigration and coloniz¬ 
ation activities whic& had formerly been carried out as part of the 
general office work. Its purpose was primarily to induce settlers 
to locate in Alberta. Offices were opened in Winnipeg, Toronto and 
Montreal and a number of special commissioners were sent to the 
United States. As well as these personal contacts, advertisements 
were placed in newspapers, journals and magazines, and special 
exhibit displays were sent to various exhibitions. In all, about 
12 tons of advertising matter were distributed during the year. 

in 1910 the Alberta government was beginning to have the 
dawning realization that to compete in the world market only high 
grade goods could reasonably be expected to sell at fair prices. In 
an effort to test this theory the government began & trend toward 
encouragement of high quality production, un© of the pioneer, 
efforts was made by the Dairy Commissioner's Branch, which was very 
active in 1910. A number of creameries, in cooperation with the 
government, adopted a system of cream and butter grading and a 
quality basis payment for butter and cream, whereby producers who 
furnished higher grade products received an added premium. Part XI 
of the Dairymen's Act was passed during the 1910 Session and bolster¬ 
ed the new policy still more. Provision was made for the organiz¬ 
ation, registration and management of cheese manufacturers assoc¬ 
iations and for the appointment of Dairy Inspectors. It provided 
standards for sampling and testing milk and cream and for records 
to be kept and statements to be rendered to patrons by cheese fact¬ 
ories and creameries, in connection with these tests. The proper 
observance of the Dairymen f s Act would help to ensure fair treatment

for patrons, fair competition and better quality product. 

It was suggested by the Deputy Minister, in 1910, that a 
number of the local cooperative creameay associations could well 
undertake a larger share of the local management of their creameries 
as those "government" creameries became debt free. This would give 
them a better knowledge of the creamery business and prepare them 
to take full control as was intended when the department first 
took over the work. In 1911, government operation of creameries was 
finally discontinued completely. The government, however, offered 
to continue the marketing of butter not only for cooperative cream¬ 
eries, as in the past, but also for private creameries. 

13 

The new Public Health Act became law on June 9. The adminis¬ 
tration of Public health matters was greatly facilitated by the new 
regulations and the work and responsibilities of the Public Health 
branch were greatly increased. In view of the erection of rural 
municipalities and the power granted them by the Rural Municipalities 
Act to care for contagious, infectious and communicable diseases 
under the supervision of the Provincial Medical Officer of Health, 
it was essential that the Public Health Act be amended to provide 
for local boards of health in rural municipalities. Little friction 
was encountered in enforcing the new laws. Among other changes the 
former Provincial Health officer was renamed the Provincial Medical 
Officer of Health* 

From a study of the work carried out by the Department of 
Agriculture it is evident that its policy was directed along three 
main avenues. First in importance was the promotion of the professed 
departmental policy to aid the agricultural interests of the province.

Toward this end were directed the energies of the inspection and 
educational branches, which were primarily classified on a function*- 
al basis, with an agricultural clientele. The branches were decen¬ 
tralized to a considerable degree; the Dairy Commissioner had his 
headquarters in Calgary and operated along specialized lines unhamp¬ 
ered by the Edmonton office except for directions as to general 
policy. Similar conditions could be found in the Brands Office in 
Medicine h a t and the various inspection branches @hich were necessarily 
widely dispersed throughout the province. The second major function 
of the department was in providing and enforcing regulatory measures 
necessary as a complement to the educational services. The third 
policy involved control of the public health, which was foisted upon 
this particular department for no apparent reason. It would appear 
that the Department of Public works or the Provincial Secretary*s 
Department would have been able to handle this function with etual 
justification; as it was, the control of public health matters by 
the Department of Agriculture did not prove to be permanent. 

THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 

In a young, developing country opening to waves of immigration 

and demands for new facilities, a virile and progressive policy is 

required to keep the old residents satisfied and to attradt the new, 

14 

by providing evidence that their basic requirements will soon be 

met. The brunt of these demands fell on the Public Works Department 

which was, therefore, basically a service department. To this extent 

the Department of Public Works was the most important in the province. 

its primary functions were the construction and maintenance of roads,

ation of the Local Improvement Act. By 1911 the Telephones and 
Municipal Affairs "branches had grown so much that they could not 
he efficiently handled as mere branches, so they were given depart¬ 
mental status along with the rapidly growing job of railway admin- 
15 

istration • 

In the first annual report of the provincial Department of 
Public Works the cry was taken up for increased accommodation. 

The Deputy Minister supported the demands of most of the other 
departments when he stated that existing office space was inadequate 
and new temporary arrangements were essential while the proposed 
Provincial Buildings were being constructed. One of the foremost 
concerns of the department was to provide roads and bridges. The 
increase in settlement along the new railway lines and the movement 
of farmers and grain growers into areas formerly occupied by 

16 

cattlemen in southern Alberta led to a wide call for improvements. 
The policy in regard to roads and bridges became quite firmly estab¬ 
lished. Permanent bridges were constructed as often as possible 
and roads were built with a view to the future needs of the province, 
with efforts being made to construct new lines on a permanent basis 
whenever conditions were suitable. The increase in traffic in the 
older settlements was making frequent improvements necessary and 
permanent standards could not always be attained. 

The provincial department continued the Territorial policy of 

maintaining branches for simplicity of administration in an arrange- 

■ 

ment similar to that of the Department of Agriculture. The following 

_ 

15. Railways & Telephones were combined in one department, Municipal 
Affairs became an independent department--see infra;,pp.40-43,64 ff.

branches existed or were formed during 1906 and 1907: 

Correspondence Branch 
Accounts Branch 
Engineering Branch 
Surveys Branch 
Local Improvement Branch 
Steam Boilers Act 
Coal Mines Act 

The Correspondence B ranch , under the supervision of a chief 

clerk, assumed the burden of handling the correspondence of the 

department* This increased from a total of 104,700 communications 

17 

(incoming and outgoing) in 1906, to nearly 397,000 in 1911. 

The Steam Boilers Act was administered by a clerk in charge 

of office work, and outside inspectors whose duties were to inspect 

and classify steam boilers throughout the •orovince and to enforce 

18 

conformity with the Steam Boilers Inspection Act, by prosecution 
if necessary. General activity between 1906 and 1911 in the province, 
which directly involved this branch, included erection of large 
buildings, plant additions, new industries, coal mines, power plants 
for small towns, increase in settled areas and particularly the 
inflow of "new traction outfits" for threshing. This increase in 
the number of steam boilers caused the branch to grow from one 
clerk-administrator and two inspectors in 1906, to one clerk, one 
inspector and one stenographer for administration, and four District 
Inspectors with three Assistants in the field in 1911. As well

as its inspection duties the "branch was responsible for the exam¬ 
ination of steam boiler engineering candidates and issuing certificates 
of various grades; a function similar to that performed by profession¬ 
al associations to keep professional standards high* 

The Accountants Branch which did all the departmental account¬ 
ing, remained fairly constant in duties and staff from 1906 to 1911* 

The accountant in charge was assisted by one to four clerks, and 
normally an assistant accountant* 

The Engineering Branch * Office work consisted of preparing plans 
etc*, for the construction of bridges, roads and ferries. Outside 
work included the actual construction and maintenance of these works* 

In this, as in many other branches it is difficult to keep track of 
its development due to sketchy records. It evidently began as a 
separate branch, but after the first year merged into the general 
office under the direct control of the Deputy Minister. Owing to 
the continuing extension of railways and the influx of population, the 
work of the Department in construction and maintenance of public 
works was constantly increasing and the staff connected with these 
functions was usually under pressure to keep up with demands. To 
maintain close coordination the branches of the Department of Public 
Works were under relatively rigid control of the Deputy Minister, 
thus allowing limited discretionary powers among branch heads* The 
predominantly engineering character of the work of the department 
made the arrangement largely in accordance with the specialization 
of personnel, although the purposive allocation of duties could not 
be overlooked.

The Surveys .branch * In this office instructions were 
prepared for district surveyors, engineers reports were record¬ 
ed and plans were filed in the Land Titles Office* Titles 
received for roads, and lands required for public buildings were 
examined and recorded, claims for compensation for lands required 
for right of way etc,,were settled, and old, unused roads were 
re-transferred* 

The Local I mprovement Branch was responsible for the admin¬ 
istration of the .Local Improvement Act, the Village Act and that 
part of the School Ordinance relating to the collection of arrears 

of school taxes in rural school districts, and later the Educational 
19 

Tax Act. All of these dealt largely either directly or indirectly 
with the taxation of occupied lands in the province, which meant 
that the increase in settlement, the continued transfer and re¬ 
transfer of lands and the growth of business centres along new rail¬ 
way lines greatly increased the work of this branch. 

The Local Mines Act * The Mines branch existed solely to 
administer this act, which involved responsibility for inspection 
of mines, and enforcement of government regulations as well as 
encouragement toward voluntary safety measures. Examinations were 
conducted for mine managers, pit and lire bosses. The branch grew 
from one clerk-stenographer in 1906,to one head office clerk and 
five outside inspectors in 1911. 

The Architectural Branch emerged in 1907 as a separate section 
employing one architect, seven draughtsmen and one stenographer* 
Working in conjunction with a structural section they made working 
drawings and details, specifications and estimates in connection with

new and uncompleted work each year. They dealt chiefly with nublic 

20 

huildings, which at that time were being built in large quantities. 

The Telephone Branch is deserving of a somewhat more detailed 
study for two reasons. First, because it was to expand to the status 
of a full department within a few short years, second, because of the 
new idea that found expression in Alberta's entry into the telephone 
field. 

Early in 1906 the government was urged to take action along 

the lines of telephone ownership or government control. A policy 

of telephone construction and operation was decided upon and construct* 

ion on several lines was started. An Act introduced by Mr. Gros^, 

21 

and assented to on M S y9, 1906, empowered municipalities to establid'i 
and operate telephone systems in the province as a complement to the 
preceding vote of $25,000 for preliminary work toward the establish¬ 
ment of a government-owned long distance service. The act empowered 
any municipality to carry on the telephone business in the same 
manner as a private company. Telephone accounts were to be kept 
separately from other municipal accounts. Councils were given 
expropriation powers and authority to cross any land and put lines 
and poles wherever they were deemed advisable. All officers were to 
be appointed and dismissed by the Councils. Special assessments 
could be made by the municipalities for the establishment of the 
systems. 

Before leaving for England in May 1907, Premier Rutherford, 
in a speech to the Strathcona Board of Trade, stated that the

government action in telephone construction and ownership was the 

first in the Dominion and that he hoped to create a uniform municipal 

system throughout the province. Previous to that the Minister of 

Public Works said in reference to the established Bell Telephone 

Company, that it was the function of the government to protect the 

people from such monopolies, and this could only he done by regulation 

in the form of government competition, which would ensure low rates 

22 

and proper service. He further stated that the government wanted 

the farmers to have the business advantages of a system of municipal 

telephones. In another address, to the Canadian Club in Calgary, on 

April 11, he dedlared cheap phones for farmers and settiers--"The 

union of the province by cords of copper"—to be the special policy 

23 

of the government. 

Preliminary negotiations with the Bell Telephone Company for 
purchase of its Albeita interests were attempted, without success, 
in 1907. Government action In carrying out its telephone policy had 
by 1908, however, made the Bell Company realize that the government 
system was to be real competition, not just a foil. On Janua 
Mr. Cushing presented another bill to the Legislature for the 

ion and operation of a telephone and telegraph system in the province 

24 

as a public work. By June 30, 1907, $284,244 had been invested in 
the system and he proposed an expenditure of $350,000 to be obtained

by borrowing on debentures. The government system was being 
operated under the direct control of the Department of Public Works, 
with rates which compared favourably with those of the Bell system. 

Mr • Cushing*s bill passed with no argument except that the project 
might better be operated under the management of an independent 
commission. Negotiations were reopened with the Bell Company, and 
on April 20, the sale was donfirmed at a purchase price of $675,000. 
The government took over on May 1, 1908. 

During April of 1908 a Manager Engineer was appointed mnd the 
Telephone Branch of the Department of Public Works officially came 

25 

intb being to proceed with all the telephone work of the department. 
The acquisition of a system larger than the entire former government 
system created problems which are understandable* The difference in 
methods and organization necessitated a slow cautious period of 
familiarization and standardization. In the first 9 months after 
the purchase the toll business increased from $5,770 to $8,370^"an 
increase of practically 45%* By February, 1909, there were in 
operation 1,842 miles of long distance lines, 724 miles of rup&l 
lines and 75 toll stations, as well as 46 other stations with toll 
line connections. 

Throughout the ensuing years the telephone system was extended, 

26 

’•as rapidly as was consistent with good business management.” Rapid 
progress was made in expansion; by December 31, 1911,there were 4,195 
wire miles of toll lines connecting 195 offices and 4,925 miles of 
rural lines servicing 3,784 rural subscribers and 10,852 exchange

At this point the Department of Public Works turned control of the 
provincial telephone system over to the new department of Railways 
and Telephones. 

PR OVINCIAL SECRE TARY’S DEPA RTMENT 
In the first annual report of the Department of the Provincial 
Secretary, it was stated that, despite inadequate Territorial reports, 
enough evidence was available to warrant the statement that the 
business transacted by the Alberta department between August 1905, 
and December 1906, was infinitely greater than that done in the entire 
North-West Territories for any similar period. This increase was 

28 

felt to be ample jaistification for the claims for provincial rights. 

The work of the department for 1905-06 could be broadly covered 

by the following list: issuance of certificates under the department- 
29 

al seal, issuance of marriage, auetioneers and peddlers licences; 
issuance of commissions appointing Justices of the Peace, Notaries 
Public and Commissioners for Oaths; issuance of proclamations; 
administration of a number of Ordinances such as the Livery Stable 
Keepers Ordinance and Cemeteries Ordinance entailing purely adminis¬ 
trative work, which was unrecorded; incorporation of butter and 
cheese manufacturing companies under the Dairymen f s Ordinance. 

During 1906 the Automobile 4c t was placed on the Statutes to 
be administered by the Secretary's Department. As well as providing 

27• Department of Railways and Te l ephon es, Ann ual Rep or t, 1912. 

28. It failed, however to convince many astute critics or to persuade 
them that two provinces were justified, 

29. Documents so certified were unchallenged and accepted throughout 
Europe and the United States.

for the licensing of vehicles it regulated their speed and operation. 

A provincial library was established in 1906 and a start was made in 
accumulating reports from foreign countries, encyclopedias and the 
foremost Dominion newspapers and publications. The administration 
of the Veterinary Surgeon’s Ordinance was transferred in May, 1906, 
from the Secretary’s Department to the combined control of the Veterin¬ 
ary Surgeon’s Association and the Department of Agriculture as a means 
of providing more efficient enforcement of the Act. 

The Deputy Provincial Secretary held the position of Registrar 
of Joint Stock Companies. His duties in this capacity were extensive, 
but could be conducted completely independently of the rest of the 
departmental business. A large number of new companies were being 
formed in the province, as well as the numerous foreign corporations 
establishing branch offices in Alberta. The law provided that all 
companies must register, but they were generally reluctant to do so; 
consequently the Registrar was frequently forced to resort to threats 
of legal action to enforce conformity. 

The activities of the department during the final four months 
of 1905, all of 1906 and a good deal of 1907 were mostly organizational, 
and in many cases a lack of any purpose or system seems evident. The 
department was unable to establish any permanent structure because 
of the very nature of its duties. In any government there are always 
miscellaneous functions to be carried out and new activities arising 
which cannot be assigned readily to any existing department. The 
responsibility for these often temporary functions fell to the 
Secretary’s Department, which carries a burden somewhat like the 
British Home Office. It is also true that the initial work in 
establishing a new department is difficult, and considering that 








45 


the department was staffed by only the Deputy Minister and one clerfc 

in cramped quarters until 1907, it appears that a creditable job was 

done. The need for more assistance was felt from the beginning but 

the total permanent staff never exceeded four until after 1912. In 

1906 the Secretary stated that the difficulty encountered in running 

the department stemmed from a lack of clerical assistance, which was 

30 

a direct outcome of the lack of adequate accommodation. In subsequent 

years temporary help was hired to keep the work up to date. 

The offices of the department were moved in 1907 from Jasper 

Avenue to the Terrace Building, on the property allocated for Provincial 

Government buildings. The accommodation problem was not relieved but 

the distance of the new location from the city business centre made 

an appreciable difference in the number of personal calls and a 

corresponding lightening of the burden of the department. The 

necessary change to mail communication was a twofold improvement-mail 

could be handled more rapidly and was less likely to go unrecorded. 

The year 1908 was one of economic pessimism, marked by a temporary 

31 

financial and commercial depression throughout the world. The 
departmental revenue consequently showed a marked decline. During 
1909 there was a decided upswing in business trends and the department 
had its most profitable year to that date. Outside capital returned 
in a larger and more constant flow than at any previous time. The 

following table of the departmental revenue serves to indicate the

Obviously, until 1912 the major portion of the income was from 
fees collected in conformity with the Companies Ordnance f and the 
Foreign Companies* Ordinance. The remainder was made up chiefly of 
licenses and other fees which were sporadic and less remunerative. 

A number of acts passed between 1905 and 1909 regarding the registrat¬ 
ion of fraternal and other organizations were made the responsibility 

32 

of the Department, although they were of minor significance both as 

to revenue and administrative load. The departmental administrative 

expenses—salaries, travelling and office expenses —rose to about 

#5,000 by 1908, remained fairly constant through 1911, reached to 

33 

over #7,000 in 1912 and soared to over §13,000 in 1913.

it received jurisdiction over the care and maintenance of prisoners 
and the insane. The Provincial Gaol at Lethbridge and the Hospital 
for the Insane at Ponoka were opened in July and 165 mental patients 
were immediately transferred from Brandon. The year 1911 ended the 
first period of gradual growth of the department. By then some of 
its functions had increased in complexity and importance to such an 
extent that the Secretary’s Department was ready for the general 
government reorganization of 1912. 

D EPARTME NT OP E DUCATI ON 

As with the other departments, the Department of Education 
adopted many of the territorial government *s regulations and administrat 
ive precedents to avoid serious disruption during the transitional 
period. To replace the old records, information concerning existing 
school districts and their debenture indebtedness was computed from 
territorial records and official gazettes. All teachers qualified 
under the territorial government were invited to submit their csrtificat 
es to be registered and validated as provincial licenses. 

One of, the first concerns of the department was in connection with 
the organization of new school districts. Practically all new districts 
were organized upon the request of residents of those districts. Any 
three potential ratepayers of a proposed school district could form 
a committee to undertake the preliminary steps as outlined in the 

34 

School Ordinance, providing there were twelve children aged 5-16, 
and at least four residents owning land which would be liable for 
assessment. Once these terms were met, if a majority at a meeting 

34. An amendment in 1908 reduced this requirement to eight children.

of ratepayers were in favor, trustees could "be elected and returns 
made to the government of the entire procedure. If all the require¬ 
ments of the School Ordinance were fulfilled the Minister of Education 
would then give his official order for erection of the district and 
notice would appear in the Official Gazette. If the residents failed 
to take the initiative it wag within the power of the Minister to do 
so provided an area contained at least 20 school-age children, 20 
potential tax payers and 6,000 acres of assessable land. 

The department was becoming increasingly active in the organ¬ 
ization and maintenance of foreign schools, one of the largest of 
which was in the Ruthenian colony ei ast and north-east of Edmonton. 

One man was occupied full time in assisting non-English settlers in 
the establishment of school districts throughout the province. He 
concerned himself with the organization of districts, erection of 
schools, employment of teachers, as well as routine work involving 
levying of taxes. When necessary he could act as Official Trustee, 
performing all the duties of a school board and its officers; in 
certain cases he would exercise an oversight of district work until 
elective boards were able to assume administrative control in accord¬ 
ance with the School Ordinance and departmental regulations. 

Bach year between 1906 and 1911 the number of districts organ¬ 
ized exceeded the total for all previous years. In conformity with 
railway plans and development the greatest activity in organization 
again was shown along new and proposed lines, although many schools 
were also established in more remote areas. In 1908 it was necessary 
to remove some of the restrictions to the establishment of school 
districts by lowering the required number of resident children from 
12 to 8.

The revenue for the maintenance of schools was derived from two 

sources, government grants and local taxation. In rural districts the 

grants were based on acreage, the maximum being ten cents per acre 

taxation. The sbhool grants were statutory and paid upon a basis set 

by the School Ordinance. Taxpayers seemed to be more willing to spend 

for school purposes. In 1910 authorization was given for the issue 

of over #^000,000 in school debentures; in this and several other 

instances the government had to restrain school districts from raising 

35 

as much money as their optimism suggested. If these debenture by-laws 

had been unpopular the Ordinance required that they be submitted to a 

poll upon the demand of a small group of ratepayers. The rarity of 

any such polls indicated that the taxpayers favored educational spending

ATTORNEY GSlffERAL'S DEPARTMENT 

The foregoing departments made available a certain amount of 

public information in the form of their annual reports. The remainder 

which includes the Treasurers and Attorney General's Departments, 

and the Provincial Auditor, made no such reports. As a result there 

is a gap in information pertaining to the general activities of these 

departments, although an idea of their staffs and expenses can be 

37 

obtained from the Public Accounts. Departmental policy is difficult 
to determine except by perusal of the actual work turned out, if and 
when this is available. 

Fortunately, in his Budget Speech, delivered on February 22, 1909, 
Premier Rutherford presented a review of the work of the Attorney, 
ieneral's Department for the preceding three and one half years. It 
is from his speech that the following is chiefly obtained. 

37. But only an idea unless one is able to interpret the bewildering

The work before the 1906 session consisted largely of organ¬ 
ization and foundation work in preparation for the legislation of 
the first session. Apart from this, the most important thing 
accomplished by the department was the compilation of the consolid¬ 
ation of the Ordinances of the North-West Territories for 1898-1905. 

This work was indispensable to the legal profession and valuable to 
the public. 

In 1907 the outstanding task performed was the taking over of 

the land registration system from the Dominion government and the 

operation of it by the province. The new provincial judicial system, 

as enacted in the legislation of 1907, was established, introducing 

the district court system to Alberta. Two new judicial districts 

were formed, In Wetaskiwin and Lethbridge, and court offices were 

opened in each place with the necessary officials. Additional 

accommodation was provided for the Land Titles Offices in Edmonton 

and Calgary and the work of these offices was brought up to date 

by the employment of night staffs. 

The department continued to work in cooperation with the B.N.W. 

M.P., which had been retained by the province. A great deal of time and 

energy was expended to carry the ever-increasing burden of the 

administration of justice, the extradition of alleged criminals and 

the trial of all offenders. The insane of the province were looked 

39 

after by the Attorney General’s Department, and after the new 
Dominion Immigration Act of 1907 the Attorney General diligently 

39. Until transferred to the Provincial Secretary’s Department 

in 1911.

insisted upon the deportation of all persons covered by the act, 
thereby saving the province a good deal of money. 

In 1908 a completely new and simplified small debt procedure 
was promulgated by the government after being prepared by the Attorney 
General’s Department. By means of the new arrangement many persons 
were able to seek recourse through the courts, a procedure which 
was previously made difficult because of the expense and delay under 
the old system. 

The liquor license branch was a small part of the department 
with an active future ahead. Another important function was the 
establishment of Sheriff’s Bailiffs and Process Issuers in the Province 
by the Inspector of Legal Offices. Practically all legislation intro¬ 
duced to the House had been revised by the department and as a result 
most Statutes were carefully drawn and legalistic;?* 

One more or less independent body that was responsible to the 
Attorney General was the office set up to deal with neglected children. 
The former Superintendent of the Alberta Industrial School submitted 
his first report as Superintendent of Neglected Children for the year 
1909, and subsequently he presented biennial reports. The Children’s 
Protection Act, which was introduced in 1909 to replace the Industrial 
Schools Act, provided for departmental officers whose duties were to 
investigate and give appropriate warning in any cases of abused or 
neglected children. If the warning was not heeded the child could be 
placed in a shelter and by a Court Order could be made the ward of the 

department. Provision was also made for the investigation of potential 

40 

adopters and the placing of children in satisfactory homes.

The organization of the Department in 1906 was as follows: 



Hew government activities had been commenced in several fields 
with varying degrees of success and affecting the province in many 
different ways although they did not all directly alter the organization. 
In Hay 1907, Premier Rutherford stated that inquiries had indicated that 
hy 1908 there would he about 60 to 70 pupils ready to matriculate in 
arts, and 8 to 10 in engineering in the province. As a result, during 
the March Session the government voted #150,000 for a site for the pro¬ 
posed university* On January 1, 1908, Dr. H* H. Tory was appointed 
president and on July 1 a faculty of four professors was appointed. 
Teaching began on September 23 with forty students in attendance, and 
the formal inauguration took place on October 13. 

The organization of the Alberta judicial system was completed in 
1907 as a result of legislation which created a Supreme Court of five 
judges with certain defined jurisdiction and five District Courts to 
deal with specified matters of minor importance of under $400 claim 
value. Surrogate Courts similar to those of Ontario and Manitoba

and provincial .Law Society were established. 

During the Session of February 1908, two important labor meas¬ 
ures were passed. An amendment to the Coal Mines Act limited the 
underground working time to 8 hours in each 24 hour period and added 
other safety regulations; the second was the passing of the Workmen’s 
Compensation Act. 

The Rutherford government conducted public affairs during 1909 

without an apparent cloud in its sky. The provincial election 

campaign centred around a battle of personal popularity rather than 

a wide disparity of political ideals. The Liberals were favoured 

by the absence of any scandals, lack of opposition and strong support 
42 

from the press. The Conservative opposition was disorganized and 
unprepared for an effective campaign. R. B. Bennett made the most 
vigorous opposition speech; basing his attack chiefly on the geograph¬ 
ic rivalry between Calgary and Edmonton he claimed government favorit¬ 
ism toward Northern Alberta. The election resulted in the defeat of 
A. . Robertson, the Conservative leader and the d e facto assumption 
of the leadership by Bennett. The new House was composed of 37 
.Liberals, 2 Conservatives, 1 Independent Conservative and 1 Socialist. 

'There was not a shadow evident of the troubles which were destined 
to shatter the party in 1910. During its regime the Rutherford

government had made some notable achievements, the moat outstanding 

of which was the work of the Attorney General, C. W. Cross. He 

apparently solved the irksome problem of forcing the C.P.R. to pay 
43 

taxes; he smashed a strong lumber combine, freeing the settlers 
from the high priced monopoly of building materials; he gave Alberta 
the reputation of being a model province in law and order; finally 
he abolished saloons and enforced the Dominion Government Lord’s Day 
Act • 

As early as 1909 the government was taking a stand in regard 
to social legislation. On January 7 a deputation appeared requesting 
amendment of the Workmen’s Compensation Act on the grounds that 
it was ultra vires, class legislation, and injurious to capitalists 
and employers—especially coal operators. Other complaints were made 
against the policy of equal payments to good and poor workers, and of 
allowing foreigners to go abroad and spend their indemnities in 
Hungary and Italy. Still other complaints were made that the act 
was socialistic. The government, however, refused to take action 
and the Act remained unchanged. 

The year 1910 opened in the same quiet manner as the other four 
years of Rutherford rule. The Legislative session was opened on 
February 10 by Lieutenant Governor G. H. V. Bulyea with a Speech from 
the Throne in which he referred to the large incoming population and 
the consequent work involved, particularly the task of carrying out 
the railway expansion that had been authorized in 1909. He also 

43. A later decision of the Privy Council quashed his plan and by 
1912 he was searching for a new solution. C.A.R . 1911, p. 592-93*

mentioned his gratification with the expansion of schools and progress 

of higher education. Shortly thereafter a publicity commissioner 

and promoter of immigration was appointed. Later in the year the 

announcement was made that the $26,000,000 C.P.R. tax exemption 

44 

issue would be carried to the Privy Council. 

It is not possible to describe the developments of the govern¬ 
ment of Alberta without mention of the influence exerted by the 
constant influx of population and the growth in the number of 
settled areas. The attempts of the Public Works Department to 
provide works along the new railway lines, the trouble encount¬ 
ered by beef farmers in shipping their products and the influx of 
new companies to the grov^ing towns, all hinge about the railroads, 
which were the primary link connecting the West with the rest of 
the world. Railway extension was not only a key factor in indirectly 
forcing rapid government development, it was also a potential 
destroyer of the government if not handled correctly, because 
of the huge sums of money involved. In view of the importance of 
the railroads in promoting settlement and development, and the 
political crisis brought about in 1910, it is essential that the 
background in this matter be discussed in greater detail. 

Throughout 1908 the importance of railway development was 
receiving increasing attention. On November 27, in the Edmonto n 
Bulletin , Mr. Rutherford was quoted as follows: "I have now decided 
upon a policy of railway extension throughout the Province...I intend 
to establish a Department of Railways and to make it one of the most 
important departments of the government and one which I will personally

look after,.*."Three reasons for railroad expansion were given; inadequacy 
of service, need for competition and a means of attracting settlers. 

The great question in the province in regard to railway construction 
"became the center of contention in the 1909 session of the Legislat¬ 
ure, when the Premier’s general statements of 1908, regarding govern¬ 
ment aid, were developed. Numterous delegations approached the govern¬ 
ment during j anus^ry and February from all parts of the province, 
requesting a general increase in railway facilities. Railways were 
badly needed, but companies hesitated to build without some assist¬ 
ance such as a guarantee of the bonds. The policy of the Rutherford 
government was announced in the Legislature on February 24 in three 
series of resolutions and three succeeding bills, which passed in 
due course. 


‘Ilie announced policy involved a total of 1,761 miles of railway 
with $25,343,000 as the amount of the government guarantee given to 
bonds of the C.N.R., Grand Trunk Pacific, and the Alberta and Great 
Waterways Railway. In the C.N.R. measure the guarantee was #13,000 
per mile with 4% interest on the bonds; the security was a first 
mortgage with the privilege of adding 12,000 per mile to the guarantee, 
subjedt to the subsequent approval of the Legislature. The terms for 

the G.T.P. were the same. The totaii mileage contemplated for these 

' 

two companies was 796. 

Following their successful campaign of 1909 the Liberals comm¬ 
enced the first session of the Second Legislature on February 10, 

1910, with an appearance of serenity. With minor exceptions the 
entire session warn concerned with the Alberta^and Great Waterways 
Railway question and the concurrent political crisis. Events occur rid 
at an alarming rate and almost before he knew what was happening

Premier Rutherford had submitted his resignation. 

On May 26 Mr. A. L. Sifton, Chief Justice of Alberta undertook 

to form a Ministry, and on June 3, 1910, it was announced as follows; 

Hon. A. L. Sift on--Premier, Provincial Treasurer, Minister of Public 

Works 

Hon. C. R. Mitchell—Attorney General and Minister of Education 

Hon. A. J. McLean—Provincial Secretary 

Hon. D. Marshall—Minister of Agriculture 

Several miscellaneous activities of some significance occurred 

during 1910. A resolution calling for the acquisition by the 

province of the control of public resources was withdrawn when the 

Premier stated that the government was preparing to negotiate in 

this direction. The provincial Conservatives attempted to rebuild 

themselves at a convention in Calgary in July. Mr, Bennett declined 

the leadership and Mr. E. Michener of Red Deer was then chosen. The 

Peace River country was receiving much attention and publicity with 

immigrants steadily working northward where farming possibilities 

were .seen to be immense and where prospectors were actively studying 

the country. The Alberta mining industry was showing signs of 

becoming one of Western Canada*s most important developments; output 

from Alberta*s 150 coal mines was estimated at 13,000 tons per day 

and the Dominion official statistics showed total Alberta mineral 

production for 1910 to be #7,876,458, an increase of #1,800,000 over 
46 

1909.

In 1911 the Sifton ministry had continued political difficulties 
to meet within its own party ranks. The railway situation remained 
conspicuous throughout the year. In an address to the Legislature 
Mr. J. L. Cote stated that municipalities, railways and highways 
were the shortest route to the hearts of all Albertans, an extreme 
statement perhaps, but one containing a good deal of truth as eviden¬ 
ced by government policy which was shaped largely in answer to the 
demands of the electorate. The big political event of the year was 

the reconciliation between the government and Mr. Cross and his 12 
47 

followers. This enabled the Liberals to face the world as a united 
party once more. With the party split officially healed, the way 
was clear for the necessary Cabinet changes of 1912 and the utilizat¬ 
ion of the most highly qualified men available. 


47. Mr. Cross had not been included in the new Sifton Government of 

1910.

Reorganization, 1912 

Formation of Department of Railways and Telephones, 
and Municipal Affairs.

.tieorganization 1912. The 1912 session of the Alberta legislature 
Was notable chiefly for the actions taken to bring about the long 
overdue government reorganization. The Public Works Department was 
becondng too cumbersome for efficient administration and it was 
seen that the administration of railways, telephones and municipal¬ 
ities called for departmental status. The Statute Act was amended to 
increase the number of government departments from four to eight 
and two new departments were immediately formed—the Department of 
Railways and Telephones , and the Department of Municipal Affairs. 

The consequent need for new cabinet ministers was used to the best 
possible advantage by Premier Sift on when he appointed C. W. Cross and 
J. R. Boyle. The long-lived antagonism between Cross and the govern¬ 
ment had been a serious political problem for the Liberals and 
the return of the popular Edmonton lawyer as Attorney General brought 
an official return to party unity. J* R. Boyle’s appointment as 

Minister of Education served to soothe still more of the electorate 

1 

in view of his strong attitude about the A. & G. W. affair. 

Several developments were made in the Provincial Secretary’s 
Department as a result of the 1912 session. The M otor Vehicles Act 
was strengthened by the addition of safeguards regarding adequate 

lightening of vehicles, carrying license plates, licensing chauffeurs, 

2 

registration of dealers and specific speed limits. # The Theatres Act 

1* Boyle had been one of the leaders of those opposed to the 
Rutherford railway policy. 

2* Rate of speed not to exceed 1 mile in 4 minutes in city town 
or village and 1 mile in 6 minutes when turning corners.

provided for the control, licensing and regulation of theatres, 

entertainment halls and cinematographs, with power to appoint 

3 

censors and inspect films. A still further increase in the 

load carried fcy the department was incurred when the Corporation 

Taxation Act and the Railway Mileage Tax Act were transferred to 

the Secretary from the Treasurer^ Department. These two acts were 

primarily responsible for the unprecedented revenue increase shown 

4 

by the department. A secondary cause for the revenue growth was 
the constant increase in automotive traffic and the more stringent 
licensing regulations. Revenue from the provincial gaols was also 
beginning to increase in 1912. 

In several respects agricultural conditions had been changing 

to the detriment of many farmers, with the result that more action 

was being taken by the government. The constant inflow of settlers 

to former ranching areas wg,s unfortunate inasmuch as a good deal 

5 

of ranchland was completely unsuited for grain crops. Consequently 
the cattle industry was declining and exports to Britain had almost 
stopped. The government expressed alarm at the obsession of the 
settlers for one-crop farming. The Deputy Minister of Agriculture, 
addressing a meeting at Red Deer, said that Alberta was "wheat crazy" 
and he went on to state: "Where mixed farming obtains the farmers meet 
their obligations better, the merchants are better off and the 
country more successful in every way. At Macleod, where grain

growing obtains almost wholly, the farmers are half a million 
dollars in debt to the merchants and the merchants have asked the 

6 

government to help them in some way by encouraging mixed farming." 

The Provincial Livestock Inspector urged similar views constantly 

during the year. A Central Alberta Development League publication 

carried the warning: "A wheat harvest is either a feast or a famine. 

6a 

The farmer either makes a fortune or he loses one." 

Duncan Marshall, the Minister of Agriculture, expressed his views 
on March 1, in a talk given at Macleod. 'We know," he said, "that 
if the farmer goes int© mixed farming he will be depending upon his 
market, and if the government find that agricultural interests are 
injured by middlemen paying prices that are out of proportion to the 
prices they obtain from the consumer, the government will take a 
personal interest and take steps to assure the farmer the proper treat¬ 
ment. We hope before the summer is over to have seven experimental 
farms in operation in the province. We shall soon have a herd of 
dairy cattle on each of those farms which will be operated along the 

general lines of mixed farming. The department will also build three

Agricultural Schools during the present summer." 

The hopes of the Minister were almost realized in 1912, when 

six demonstration farms were opened. Their objectives were described 

8 

in the first report of the Superintendent of Demonstration Farms.

.Primarily, they were to work out in practical demonstration, on a 
farm conducted as any first class, progressive farmer would conduct 
his own "business, the results of the experiments made on the Dominion 
experimental farms in the province* The second aim was to make these 
farms the "bases of schools of agriculture, three of which were already 
under construction at Clareshoim, Olds and Vermilion* In connection 
with the farms these schools proposed to offer full courses in 
agriculture and domestic science* Diplomas from the schools would 
serve as admittance to the proposed Provincial Agricultural College 
which would offer the degree of Bachelor of Scientific Agriculture* 

The overall aim of these educational branches of the department was 
to bring agricultural education af close as to the farmers 

and to act as a link between the men on the land and the larger, cent¬ 
ral agricultural college* From the small schools and the demon-strati on 
farms short agricultural courses, institute meetings, seed fairs, 
weed inspection, extension work etc*, could be centred* 

Activity in the Department of Education continued throughout 
1912 with no unusual developments* Similarly, the Public Works 
Department showed no great changes beyond a reduction in the work 

and staff caused by the loss of the Municipal Affairs and Telephones 
9 

branches, and a subsequent reduction in the work and aize of the 
correspondence branch* One technical triumph was noted in the 
report of the Steam Boilers branch, which proudly stated; "An inno¬ 
vation was made during the year by the purchase of three Ford, 
single-seated "Roadster" automobiles...the teams previously

used, being dispensed with* The superiority of these autos over 

the teams has been amply demonstrated by the increase in the 

10 

number of boilers inspected." 

Following the tradition of several of the older departments 

the new Department of Railways and Telephones left no records of 

its early organization, although it explicitly enumerated the mileage 

of railway lines and telephone poles in the province. The department, 

headed by "Premier Sifton, assumed control of the telephone system 

on January 1, 1912, and during the year the physical plant and services 

were increased approximately 75 %• The following chart indicates the 

11

The scarcity of competent and efficient telephone construction 
men was acute. When an official of the department was sent Bast to 
engage as many men as possible he failed to hire even one. Labor 
shortage, equipment delays and bad weather combined to delay the 
proposed work, but by the end of the season the results were not too 
far behind earlier plans. 

It was decided in 1912 to reorganize the telephone system in 
several different ways. The province would be divided into three

districts instead of the existing five, each district to have a 

responsible local representative to represent the system ih all 

routine matters* Lines of authority, responsibility and routine 

therefore would be more clearly defined* The Plant and Accounting 

branch was to reorganize to the standard accounting system of the 

American Telephone and Telegraph Company; the Stores branch was to 

be reorganized to improve promptness* 

ho relevant information is available as to the organization or 

activities of the Railway branch in its first year, but by 1913 

the administrative staff of the entire department was composed of 

the Deputy Minister, one railway engineer and his assistant, one 

12 

secretary and one clerk. 

The beginning of 1912 marked the start of a new era in the 

municipal affairs of the province. The creation of the Department 

of Municipal Affairs, headed by the Hon. Chas. Stewart, made Alberta 

13 

the third province in Canada to have such a department. It assumed 
responsibility for the administration of the Town Act, the Rural 
Municipality Act, the Village Act and the Local Improvement Act* 

In addition it acted as a collection agency by becoming responsible 
for levying and collecting local improvement taxes in unorganized 
areas and the taxes levied under the Education Tax Act on lands 
outside of organized school districts; it also assisted villages, 
rural school districts and local improvement districts in the collect¬ 
ion of tax arrears.

The new Rural Municipality Act gave .Local Improvement Districts 
power to apply for incorporation as Rural Municipalities with wider 
powers; by September, 108 petitions had been received and 18 new 
municipalities organized* Its provisions represented an attempt 
to effect a general organization of municipal government throughout 
the province with 227 municipalities coming under its operation by 
the close of the year. A mass of details was provided as to laws 
and matters of local administration. As in the Town Act land was 
liable to assessment and taxation whether occupied or not. 

The Town Act made several material changes in the law under 
which towns could carry on business. The incorporation of new 
towns, the establishment of new villages and the organization of new 
municipalities,as well as providing information and advice, bulked 
large in the duties of the department. The Act provided for all 
matters of government and boundaries, polling and elections, duties 
of councils, assessment, taxation and finance, highway and local 
improvements. For all practical purposes the single tax on land 
values in incorporated towns and future rural municipalities, was 
established in 40 Alberta towns. The future minimum size for incorp¬ 
oration of towns was set at 7,000 population. 

In his first report the Deputy Minister gave a concise survey 
of provincial municipal activities and difficulties. In part, his 
statement reads as follows.w e will have to meet a great variety 
of problems. We have ubban municipalities in the agricultural parts 
of the province where there is a steady growth and where real estate 
has more or less fixed value. We have urban municipalities with 
large populations in mining areas where the growth and business of 
the town is subject to sudden changes and where there can be no

fixed value to the land as the existence of the town depends entirely 

on the operation of the mines. Then again, we have towns aiming to be 

industrial centres with their problems, towns that are fast becoming 

14 

railway centres with troubles of their own...." 

The staff of the department was very modest in 1912, when it only 

employed the Deputy Minister and one stenographer. By the following 

14a 

year, however, it had grown to the following establishment: 

Deputy Minister 
Chief Clerk 
Cashier 
Auditors (4) 

Clerks and Stenographers (36) 

E lection 1913 . The last year of relatively uncomplicated, 
routine operations enjoyed by the Sifton government was 1913. A 
recession and war in 1914 and the inevitable upheaval which followed 
meant that government activities, particularly spending upon anything 
not directly connected with the war effort, were kept to a minimum. 

The general election of 1913 was again more a battle of organ¬ 
ization and personalities than a fight along party lines. The premier 
was a capable administrator, but he was not a persuasive politician. 
Although their new leader, Mr. Edward Michener was an earnest and 
respected man , the Conservatives missed the leadership of R. B. Bennett,

14a. Establishment derived from the 1913 estimates. Estimates are 
used to indicate establishment rather than Public Accounts because of 
the high rate of turnover indicated by the latter, whereas the estim¬ 
ates show the actual requirements--usually the actual salary expenditure 
is close to the estimate.

who had been elected to the Dominion Parliament in 1911. They were 
also hampered by a lack of funds, by the government majority of 34 
to 7, and by the unknown conditions of 15 new seats. On the other 
hand the government was shackled to the still active spectre of the 
A. & G. W. affair, which was something to warm the hearts of the 

opposition. The alleged differences between Sifton and Cross were 

% 

also fully taken advantage of, to the detriment of the Liberals. 

Amon€ the electioneering items was a letter published by James Bower, 
former president of the U.F.A.,which illustrates the government reaction 
to the demands of the farmers. ’’The farmers,” he wrote, "applied 
for a packing plant. The government agreed to provide the funds if 
the farmers would agree to provide the hogs. The farmers applied 
for demonstration farms with schools attached. These have been 
instituted. The farmers applied for a Hail Insurance Bill, a 
Cooperative Bill and an Elevator Bill. These have all been made 

law and, I am informed, approved of by the Farmers Executive. Then 

15 

there is the Direct Legislation Bill which means, in effedt, the 

15a 

freedom of the people to govern themselves.” 


15. Direct Legislation was enacted Mardh 25, 1913 so far as the 
Initiative and approval of the legislation by the electors under 
the Referendum was concerned, but the Recall was not included and 
the Opposition, though approving the Bill in principle, declared 
its conditions impracticable. The measure provided that a petition 
signed by not less than 10$ of all voters at the previous general 
election and not less than 5% of voters in each electoral division 
at the same general election could be presented if a Referendum was 
desired on any Bill. The same percentage held for presentation of 
petitions for the Initiation of legislation. Petitions for the taking 
of a Referendum could be presented within 90 days of the close of 
a session, but such Referendum was to apply only to such Acts of 
which the coming into force was deferred by the Legislature for 90 
days after the session ended. The Initiative could not be requisit¬ 
ioned for ”any grant or charge upon the public revenue” and the Act 
was to come into force after Proclamation.

The Hon* C. w. Cross declared in Edmonton on April 9, that he 
stood by his workmens Compensation Act, which had been criticized 
because 25 cases had come into the courts, although hundreds of 
cases had been dealt with promptly* he also mentioned legislation 
he had introduced which had given practical prohibition in rural 
areas and shortened the legal hours for bars* Premier Sifton's 
campaign was based upon his political record* A certain amount of 
stress was placed upon the A. & G. W* affair and the position held 
by each candidate as an individual, but as parties, neither the 
liberals nor the Conservatives offered any solution to the problem* 

The election was held on April 17, 1913, and as finally announced 

16 

the results showed 38 Liberals and 18 Conservatives elected* The 
Conservatives were not far behind in the number of votes cast and 
the rising anti-government feeling was indicated by the fact that 
there were more votes cast against the government than for it* The 
causes of the results were not numerous. Reciprocity probably held 
many rural Liberals who feared the Conservative attitude toward the 
agriculturists 1 "freer trade" policy. The support of the U.F.A., the 
comparative strength of the Liberal organization, the favorable seat 
distribution, and especially the lack of any one outstanding issue 
seem to have been the chief factors contributing to the Liberal 
victory. 

16. Hr. Rutherford, as an Independent Liberal Candidate in opposition 
to the Government, was defeated in Strathcona by his Conservative 
opponent•

During its three year tenure of office the Sifton government 

had faced a good many varied difficulties which were, for the most 

part, satisfactorily overcome* In 1913 the railway problem presented 

new and awkward phases and unpleasant general financial conditions 

17 

were arising. The former Sifton met with special legislation, the 
latter by two successful visits to England where he had floated a loan 
for #5,000,000 in connection with expenditures ujbon telephone exten¬ 
sion and the building of public roads. The sale of bonds was at 97 
or a little over 4$. At the same time an extension was obtained on 
the Treasury Bills in connection with the A. & G. W. loan of <£1,500,000 
at 5f$. Following the elections he returned to London where he 
secured a 5 year lease for offices to house a government representative 

who would encourage immigration to Alberta and provide information 

18 

to the British public. He also arranged for another renewal of 
the temporary A. & G. W. loan. 

The death of the Provincial Treasurer, the Hon. Malcolm Mackenzie, 
on March 15, brought about several changes in the cabinet. Mr. Sifton 
assumed the vacated post on March 26, and held it until November 28, 
when G. R. Mitchell became Treasurer* Charles Stewart became Minister 
of Public Works to replace Mitchell, and Stewart in turn, was succeeded 
as Minister of Municipal Affairs by Wilfred Gariepy, an eloquent and 
cultured French Canadian who was a new member of the Legislature. 

17. See Appendix—I& AA »& G* W . Affair. 

18. Upon his return to Alberta he announced that an Agent General 
would be appointed.

The department most “before the public in 1913 was that of the 
Hon. Duncan Marshall, Minister of Agriculture. The new Parliament 

19 

buildings opened in that year and the department was able to move in. 

The increased accommodation made it possible to regroup 
correlated lines of work. For seme years the Deputy Minister*s office 
had been compelled to handle several routine functions which should 
have been passed on to the branches. Although the general office 
had always handled a number of these matters it was not desirable 
that the chief permanent administrator of the department should 
have his office tied down to specific chores which would divert his 
attention in some degree from higher policy matters. 

One of the first changes was to transfer the duties of collect¬ 
ing crop statistics from the direct supervision of the Deputy Minister 
to the publicity Bureau. This was done because the compilation of 
statistics was more closely associated with the work of the Publicity 
Commissioner than w T ith the predominantly administrative work of the 
Deputy. The crop statistics fell into two divisions, Meteorological 
reports and crop conditions. The meteorological information was 
received from the Dominion Meteorological Office at Toronto and was 
largely the work of a corps of volunteer observers in the province, 
it had been started by the territorial government and continued to 
provide the province with detailed weather information. The section 
dealing with crop statistics provided an account of crop yields, 
results of weather conditions, frosts, droughts, etc. 

19. Both the new Parliament Building and Government House were 

opened in 1913.

A second reallocation was the gathering of all work pertaining 
to livestock and making it the diredt responsibility of the Livestock 
Commissioner. The enrolment of stallions under the Horse Breeders 
Ordinance and the supervision and admihistration of the Herd, Entire 
Animals and Stock Inspection Ordinances were transferred from the 
general office. As well as assuming those new duties the Livestock 
branch managed to bring to a successful conclusion a problem in 
which it had been involved for some time. For several years the ship¬ 
pers of livestock had been dissatisfied with the service they were 

20 

getting from the railways. Box cars were substituted for stock, 
cars, long delays were common and often animals went without feed 
or water for up to sixty hours; timetable information was not readi&y 
available and there were numerous complaints of overcharging. In 
1911 a set of remedial regulations had been submitted to the Board 
of Railway Commissioners. On June 31, 1913, after continued comp¬ 
laints and government pressure, the regulations were accepted, with 
slight modifications, by the railway companies* 

The final agricultural achievement of the year was the opening 
in .November of the three schools of agriculture# The whole system 
was based upon those of Germany and Denmark, with a Board of 

Agricultural Education formed by a representative body of agricult- 

21 

urists and other prominent Albertans. The schools were to deal 
with field husbandry, veterinary science, farm mechanic^, dairying, 
poultry raising, horticulture, farm management, and a wide list of

subjects under the heading domestic science. The membership for 
the three schools was 125 students for the first term. 

Educational conditions in 1913 were improving owing to the 
unusual amount of legislation being enacted which directly or 

22 

indirectly affected the operation and administration of schools. 

Such measures as the new Grants Act and amendments relative to school 
libraries, treasurers bonds, consolidation of schools, truancy and 
compulsory education naturally caused a marked increase in the depart¬ 
mental correspondence and investigation, while the extensive recent 
legislation respecting rural municipalities, villages and towns 
inevitably gave rise to complications between school boards and 
municipal councils, the adjustment of which required patient and 
tactful cooperation between the Department of Education and the 
Department of Municipal Affairs. 

The Hon. «J • R. Boyle initiated, during the year, a new plan for 
the sale of school debentures. He decided to make his department 
a sort of clearing house for the sale of such securities with the 
debentures made payable on December 1, no matter when issued. The 
debentures were to be forwarded to the Minister, who would negotiate 
with possible investors in the province or elsewhere. Another plan, 
which was enacted during the first session of the year, made the 
first statutory provision for the complete consolidation of school 
districts. If a majority of ratepayers in two or more contiguous 
districts favored consolidation the Minister could order consolidation 
upon the request of the school boards concerned.

Two matters which required constant attention were the problem 

of keeping school attendance at a maximum and attempting to maintain 

23 

a suffieient teaching staff for the province. The West was still 

dependent upon the United kingdom and Eastern Canada for the majority 

of its teachers. To meet the requirements of Alberta schools about 

24 

700 trained teachers were required per year. A good deal of attention 
was given to the Compulsory Attendance Law; of 10,201 cases of truancy 
dealt with 8,866 pupils were returned to school * On December 8 the 
Minister stated to the press that "school attendance is compulsory"^ 
Towns and cities were required to employ truant officers and the dep¬ 
artment enforced attendance of children aged 7 to 14 in villages and 
municipalities, a matter which was formerly handled by the Superinten¬ 
dent of Neglected Children. 

Organizational activity was still under way in the Department of 
Municipal Affairs in 1913. The 55 rural municipalities which had 
been organized in 1912 came into existence in December of that year 
and.carried on business for the first time during the ensuing months. 
Many problems naturally arose, some of which were normal to any growing 
municipality, but a large number were related to the immaturity of 
the new organizations and la&lc of experience a@ong those in charge. 

In a tour of new municipalities the Deputy Minister expressed pleasure 

23o Salaries had largely increased since 1905. For first class 
certificates males*incomes increased from $741.08 in 1905 to $1,013.46 
in 1912; females from $715.63 to $739.13; 2nd class certificates, males 
from $620.90 to $776.49; females $572.10 to $697.27. 

24. In 1913 certificates granted were: first class 154; second class 
424; 3rd. class 212. Of these 790, only 311 were Alberta students.

at the results obtained after only one year. The Town Planning Act 
was passed on March 25, 1913, and placed in the hands of the Municipal 
Affairs Department. It gave ample power to deal with any situations 
liable to come before the department in connection with town planning. 

Of the remaining departments that kept records, Public Works and 
Railways and Telephones did very little in 1913 beyond the routine 
work of other years. The Secretary’s Department expanded considerably 
to cope with the rapidly increasing complexity of its duties. Admin¬ 
istrative expenses for the department more than doubled over 1912 
and a separate division had to be set up to handle the Motor Vehicle 
Act. Administration of the new Theatres Act added still another 
potentially important function to the department. 

Boom. War and Recession—1914 . Alberta f s most sensational topic 
in late 1913 and early 1914 was a bri$f, but spectacular, flurry in 
oil. Drilling had been going on for some time in the vicinity of 
Calgary and on October 7, 1913, near Okotoks, a well came in contain¬ 
ing natural gas and crude petroleum. By November 15, 16 new companies 
had been formed. Although warnings were issued by boards of trade 
there was no check to the excitement and everyone wanted to file 
claims "everywhere or anywhere," to join or form companies, to invest 
money, little or much in any concern which proposed to hunt for oil. 

By the end of the year the fetfer spread to .Lethbridge, Medicine Hat 
and Edmonton, where numerous companies were organized to explore the 
Peace River area in search of oil and tar sands. The modest Okotoks 
discovery was supplemented on May 15, 1914, by a gu^nj of high grade 
oil on the property of the Calgary Petroleum Products Company, at 
the Discovery Well, commonly called the Dingman Well. Among the 
well known men associated with the company were A. W. Dingman and

W. S. Herron, promoters, and the Hon. J. A. Lougheed, H. 33. Bennett 

and 0. G. Devenish of Calgary as shareholders. At that time there 

were about twenty legitimate concerns in the field with drilling 

outfits at work, making geological reports etc.; immediately hundreds 

of other syndicates began to advertise and sell stock with no more 

than vague intentions. Enthusiasm reached almost hysterical proportions., 

In one day it was reported that 100 offices were 'opened, stock selling 

for ten cents in the morning reached fifty cents by night, and waste- 

25 

paper baskets were sometimes brought into use as cash registers. 

Each new spout of oil from the Dingman brought a fresh rise in stock 
prices and an added inrush of speculators. On June 10, the Calgary 
Stock Exchange was formed with forty seats at fSOO per seat. By 
July the rush of easy money was beginning to slacken and business began 
to return to a stable working basis; the war exerted an overwhelming 
damper on speculation and on Sfovember 12, speaking in Hew York, Mr. 

Sift on declared that the Calgary oil boom was over. 

The government maintained its position in 1914 with a minimum 
of political grief although the general atmosphere in the province 
was one of economic pessimism. The partial recovery from the 1913 
recession had turned out to be very brief and general activity * 
fell off again in 1914. The government was not as downhearted as 
might ha^ve been expected however, because of the disposal of the 

more politically unpleasant aspects of the A. & G. W. problem and 

26 

the consequent improvement of government financial conditions, 
furthermore the outbreak of war brought on a party truce which lasted 
until 1916. Some of the members enlisted and the province was generally

less concerned with local politics than with wider issues. A 
provincial .Liberal convention was interrupted by the war and a 
resolution was passed which stated that party action would be abandoned 
due to the larger crisis. 

labour problems were prominent throughout the year. On January 
2, in Calgary, the Industrial Workers of the World clashed with the 
police, and 600 men in Edmonton were prepared to march to their rescue. 
The lethbridge District of the-United -^ine Workers of America passed 
a resolution endorsing socialism. There were said, to be 15,000 un¬ 
employed in the chief western centres during the winter of 1913-14 and 

27 

this gave the I.W.W. their opening. One member in Calgary was convicted 
of sedition; in Edmonton a deputation to the city council demanded meals, 
clean beds and work at not less than thirty cents per hour. The Govern¬ 
ment also received a resolution from the Alberta Federation of Labour, 
and several deputations including one from the cities of the province, 
all asking primarily for measures to relieve unemployment distress. 

Despite the gloomy outlook there were certain events which, seen 
in retrospect, indicated that a recovery might well be on its way. 

united States immigrants brought in an estimated 00,000 ,000 during

1913. The C.P.R. irrigation workw at Bassano were inaugurated on 
April 25, opening up 1,000,000 acres of fertile land. On September 1

at Vancouver and Prince Rupert engendered a feeling of optimism with 
regard to the great potential saving in freight rates on grain. 

These matters, of course, were of concern mainly to Alberta and the 
West, but in the foreground of the entire economy was the war and its 
assurance of markets. 

The year and its events affected the government departments in 

various ways. Most profoundly altered was the Provincial Secretary’s 

Department. The unprecedented number of companies formed in 1913-14 

28 

caused a considerable increase in both work and revenue. In 1913, 

583 companies were incorporated with a stated capital of $69,041,715 
and 201 extra-provincial or foreign companies were registered with 
a total capital authorized of $232,767,702. At the start of 1914 
there were 2,823 exclusively Alberta companies under incorporation 
with a capitalization of #347,174,573, and of outside corporations 
doing business in the province 787 with $880,416,002 authorized 
capital. By October 1914, 502 more companies with a capitalization 
of #383,093,000 were incorporated. 

This department expanded more in 1914 than it had in all the 
earlier years of its existence. The revenue had increased from 
approximately $280,000 in 1912 to over #515,000 in 1914; administrative 
salaries had grown from just over $7£)0Q to over $20,000. Nearly half 
of the revenue increase was from the exceptional increase in incorp¬ 
oration fees, nevertheless there were substantial increases evident 
in other incomes, particularly corporation taxes and income from the 

Theatres Act. In 1913 it had been necessary to set up a new branch 

29 

to administer the Motor Act, and in 1914 another, larger branch,

employing two censors and a small clerical staff, was erected to 

handle the Theatre Act. The removal of these rapidly growing duties 

from the direct supervision of the Deputy Provincial Secretary enabled 

him to give more time to the Remaining diversified duties of his office. 

The Public Works Department restricted its work in 1914 and 

several projects were deferred. Railway and Telephone activities went 

on as usual and the department responsible made no departure from 

routine duties. Besides the Secretary’s Department, agricultural and 

educational conditions were such that the departments concerned were 

presented with several new jobs. Both of the latter two departments 

were affected by the above mentioned events--the outbreak of war, 

financial stringency, drought in some areas, high prices of farm 

30 

products and the “back to the land movement. “ 

The financial stringency and the collapse of the building boom 

brought about a considerable change in the agricultural population 

of the province. Real estate and speculation had, for several years, 

attracted farmers to the cities, but by 1914 most of them were back on 

the farms. This increase in farm population was also felt by the 

Department of Education when the school population shifted from 

31 

urban to rural schools. 

The academic staff of the University numbered 40 in 1914; there 
had been 30 graduates, and construction was under way on the Arts 
building. On April 14, it was announced that a provision of #20,000

had been made for the purchase of additional laboratory equipment* 

At about the same time an arrangement was made between the Department 
of Agriculture and the University of Alberta whereby the Provincial 
laboratory was placed within the bacteriology department of the 
University. 

There were several other new developments in Alberta Agriculture 
in 1914. The first Provincial Veterinarian was appointed to lecture 
at agricultural schools, to investigate disease outbreaks not covered 
by the Dominion Governments Animal Contagious Disease Act, and to 
look after the health of livestock on the demonstration farms. The 
three agricultural schools awarded diplomas to the graduates of the 
first two year term in 1914. 

In his report for the year the Deputy Minister noted a consider¬ 
able change in the nature of farm work. The department was happy to 
see that farming was fast becoming a mixed and diversified system* 

The number of milch cows had been increased by an influx of 10,000; 
hogs were increasing by leaps and bounds, with &igh prices being 
realized; poultry interests were increasing even faster, although 

2,000,000 dozen eggs per year were still being imported; giore vegetables 

32 

small fruit etc.,were also being grown* 

The abnormal financial conditions interfered with progress 
in some municipalities to some extent, but the total disturbance was 
not too drastic. In 1914 two new acts, the Wild Lands Tax Act and 
the Timber Areas Tax Act were placed on the Statutes to be administered 
by the Municipal Affairs Department. The former aroused much interest 
as it affected about 20,000,000 acres in the province* It imposed a 
tax on lands, unused and uncultivated and held by their owners for 


merely speculative purposes , al though the C.P.R. and other lands

CHAPTER IV 


War Period, 1915-18 

Slow-down in non-war activities 
Changes in work of departments 







82 


W ar Per i od, 1915-18. In 1915, Alberta following the precedent 
of the rest of the world, realized that all activities would have to 
be sublimated to the needs of the war effort. The following few years 
therefore, were marked by a further falling off in investment and 
speculation and a continued difficulty in obtaining loans, an almost 
total halt to railway construction by 1917 and shelving of a good 
many other projedts such as telephones and public works, and a negative 
attitude in most departments toward expansion of activities. 

On the brighter side, the war proved to be a distinct shot in 
the arm to Alberta’s struggling economy. Economic recovery began 
about one year after the start of hostilities as a result of large 
war expenditures, increasing prices, munitions orders and the demand 
for wheat. The Autumn of 1915 brought the greatest wheat crop in the 
history of the province at a most opportune time. The unprecedented 
demands for food throughout the world made itself felt in Alberta by 
a continued expansion in agricultural production and a rise in agricult¬ 
ural prices. The annual value of agricultural products approximately 

doubled between 1915 and 1920, raising agriculture to the foremost 

1 

rank of provincial industries. 

Of the political issues faced during the war the subject of 

2 

prohibition was by far the most long-lived and difficult. The 
Attorney General’s Department had charge of liquor licenses and there¬ 
fore bore the brunt of the Conservative’s attacks, which were many. 

The Legislative session which opened on February 24, 1916, was occupied 
for a time exclusively with Opposition charges relating to liquor 
licensing. It was alleged that it was a topic of common knowledge. 

1. Agricultural prices declined after 1917, 

2. See Appendixpi, Prohibition.

that improper .relations existed between officials and agents of the 

government and the Liquor License Branch of the Attorney General’s 

Department on the one hand arid the licensees of the province on the 

other. The allegations were that the licensees, by the coercion of the 

agents of the government, had offered large sums of money which went 

into the pockets of the agents or were used for the general advantage 

of the government. In the words of Dr. G. D. Stanley (Conservative): 

"The amounts are so large and the payments are so frequent that it 

creates a grave public scandal, and one that not only tends to corrupt 

the public life of the province, but renders largely inefficient this 

department of the government. In view of the fact that a new Liquor Act 

is about to be placed on the statute books it is especially necessary 

that this department should be free from corrupt influences." After 

considerable by-play in this matter charges were not proved and the 

3 

regular business of the Session was commenced. 

Later in the Session opposition members Ewing and Michener 
proposed that the government should adopt "a system of Civil Service 
based solely upon qualification and merit and permanently maintained 
independent of political party influence,"' but the government amend¬ 
ment to this proposal, which declared that appointments "should continue" 

3a 

under the conditions specified passed after long debate on April 6. 
Several amendments to the amendment were rejected, one denouncing 
severely any civil servant who would make a party use of his department, 
and another Censuring Ministers for alleged encouragement of employees 
in political campaigns. On April 22, the Calgary Board of Trade asked 
the Dominion and provincial governments for a civil service reform 
which would eliminate politics from the service. This awakening

realization of a need forreform was finally applied "by the government 

in 1918, when several actions were taken in regard to the Civil 

Service• In November 1918, Premier Stewart announced that the 

government had been looking into the facts as to Civil Servants 1 

salaries and decided to set apart $30,000 to be expended under 

regulations and in bonuses to members of the Civil Service who had 

been employed continously since 1917 at a salary of not more than 

$110*00 per month* In the Legislative Session of 1918 the Public 

Service Act was passed, to regulate the Public Service generally, to 

divide it into graded classes, fix a scale of salaries and provide 

for an Efficiency Officer to supervise the service* 

The decision of the Liberal government to hold a general election 

in Alberta in 1917 was perhaps a surprise and certainly a distasteful 

4 

prospect for the Conservatives. They realized that circumstances 
did not favor them and they claimed that the middle of a war was no 
time to appeal to the people as the opposition would support all war 
and other u reasonable H policies* The unsavory events of the pasts 
such as the A* & G. W. Railway episode* had been more or less forgotten 
by the public* With unusual strength of mind Sift on had refused 
Commissions in respect to several inquiries demanded by the opposition, 
such as liquor license payoffs and railway guarantee investigation* 
Government legislation had been voluminous and on the whole popular, 
and the Farmers were generally inclined to support the Liberals, who, 
also, had always made the most of reciprocity and free trade issues 
in their provincial contests*

When the elections were still pending the government arranged, 
by special Legislation, to re-elect the 12 members overseas. Much 

legislation demanded by the U.F.A. and Women :# s Organizations had 

5 

also been granted. The spectre of Conscription and the known 
opposition of Laurier toward it exerted a significant influence on 
the foreign-naturalized vote of the province. Railway and telephone 
expansion had always been a strong plank in the government platform; 
the final bulwarks of Liberal's strength were the astute management 
and organization given by Cross, while the binding effect of Gariepy 
held the French vote. 

The foremost appeal made by Michener in the election can best 

be summed up in his own words: 11 1 denounce the effort of the Sift on 

government to hive the soldier vote as a deliberate plot to give 

5a 

greater weight to the enemy alien electorate of this province." He 
claimed that 34,659 fighting men and nurses overseas had been 
practically hived into 2 seats arbitrarily created by the Legislature 
and that this left the province at the mercy of the enemy aliens or 
other "foreign-saturated" voters. Conservative opinion was in favour 
of disfranchising alien enemy voters. 


5. The Tiqual Suffrage Act, March 1, 1916, provided that a,ny man or 
woman 21 years of age, being a British subject, resident for one year 
in the province and 3 months in an electoral district, could vote in 
that district for the provincial Legislature. Women received the same 
political rights as men and could be elected to the Legislature or 
become Ministers of the Crown. It was estimated that there were 6 
women for 10 men in Alberta. This Act further pleased the women, who 
were already happy about the government Prohibition policy.

The election was held June 7, 1917, and changed the party 

standings very slightly. Elected were: Liberals 34, Conservatives 19, 

6 

Independents 3, (normally government supporters). A notable election 

was that of Mrs. Louise C. McKinney, President of the W.C.T.U. and a 

on-Part is an, who left her resignation in the hands of the League, 

to be used for purposes of "recall" if she ever differed from them, 

or her electors-- or some of them* 

In the meantime Premier Sift on had been engaged in a matter of 

far more significance to Canada as a whole* Ke had been taking an 

active role in the Western Conference and the problem of the Union 

Government. Although he favoured the idea of a Liberal or non-political 

chief he finally agreed, with a number of other Liberals, to join 

the Borden government. On October 13, he was worn in as Federal 

Minister of Customs, an action which was most damaging to the Alberta 
7 

Liberal party. 

Upon his resignation as Premier, the Lieutenant Governor called 
on the Hon. Charles Stewart, Minister of Public Works, to form a 
government. On October 16, the new Ministry was sworn in as follows, 
with G. P. Smith, a member of the house since 1909, as the only new 

Minister: 

Hon. Charles Stewart—-Premier, President of Council, Minister of 

Railways and Telephones 

Hon. A. J. McLean—Minister of Public Works 

Hon. J. R. Boyle, K.CMinister of Education 

Hon. C. W. Cross, K.C.— Attorney General

Following the change intthe government and his successful 

reelection, Mr. Michener also retired to accept a seat in the Senate. 

General political conditions were relatively unchanged for the next 

year, the government having 34 supporters with 234 opposition. The 

next important and surprising change in the Liberal ranks came on 

August 22, 1918, when it was announced that the Premier had asked 

Cross for his resignation. Shortly thereafter it appeared that the 

Order-in-Council appointing Mr. Cross had been formally rescinded. 

Fo reasons were given or correspondence published but it was believed 

to be a result of the fi&Jit made by Cross to hold Liberalism for

Laurier against the Union Government in 1917. Thu^, after membership 

in the Alberta government since 1905 and a general expectation that 

he would some day be premier, Mr. Cross retired* In the alterations 

made necessary the dismissal of Cross, the Cabinet was thoroughly 

shuffled. The new composition was as follows: 

Hon. C. Stema^t—Premier, President of Council, Minister of Railways 
and Telephones 

Hon* J. R. Boyle, K.CAttorney General 
Hon. G. P. Smith—Minister of Education 

8. L. G. Thomas., on.cit „p424—After Sift on's resignation, party 
faction reappeared. Frank Oliver and his many friends in the A&berta 
cabinet, joined for the first time by Cross, supported Laurier and 
his opposition to conscription. Those members of the Alberta liberal 
party were therefore not on the best of terms with the pro-conscript¬ 
ion and pro-union members.

Hon. J. L. Cote—Provincial Secretary 

Hon. A. G. MacKay—^Minister of Municipal Affairs and Public Health 
Hon. C. R. Mitchell, K.C.—Provincial Treasurer. 

During the changes the Hon. W. Gariepy had acted as Provincial 
Secretary for a month, but resigned for business reasons. Two new 
ministers appeared-- J. JL. Cote, the former Iff. L. A. for Grouard, and 
A. G. MacKay, M.L.A. for Athabasca, one time leader of the Liberal 
Opposition in Ontario and a highly capable man. 

The first session of the fourth Legislature was notable mainly 
for the presence for the first time in the history of English instit¬ 
utions of two women members in the House—Mrs!. L. C. McKinney and 

9 

Miss Roberta MacAdams, A new opposition leader, Mr. George Hoadley, 
had been elected at a Caucus of 19 Conservative members shortly 
before the Session. 

During the war period several events took place that cannot be 
neatly labelled under the name of progress, politics or administrative 
developments. In view of their general interest they are mentioned 
here in a miscellaneous grouping. In 1915 there had been a slight 
flurry about the foreign born and the bi-lingualism question. 

According to the 1910 census there were 83,114 French, German and 
Austrians out of a total population of 374,663, so the problem was 
present even before the heightened patriotism of wartime. Both the 
government and opposition were firm in their resistance to any 
encroachment of bilingualism into the school system. The general 
attitude of the foreign population both in this and other war 
matters was not actively hostile however.

Oil interests of the province again aroused discussionin 1915, hut 

there were no further tendencies toward a "boom and there were few left 

of the earlier maximum of 500 companies in and around Calgary. On 

July 5, the provincial government appointed a Commissioner to 

investigate the promotion, management and record of the boom oil 
10 

companies* Some varied irregularities were uncovered bjit the Court 

of Appeal decided that the inquiry was illegal and it ceased operations. 

By 1916 the results of the A. & G. W. Building program were 

Becoming clear, 650 miles of railway had Been completed in the North 

rty McArthur and on November 11 McArthur informed the Edmonto n Bulletin 

that in the current year the total tonnage shipped from Edmonton to 

the North via his railroad amounted to over 40,000 tons compared with 

the old time round-aBout shipment of 1500 tons per year. The total 

railway mileage in the province on December 31, 1916,was 4,566 with 

the breakdown as follows: C.P.R.— 19SO miles, C.N.R. — 125 0 miles, 

G.T.1.— 707 miles, Edmonton Dunvegan & B.C.—417 miles, A.& G.W*—223 

miles, Central Canada Railway-*49 miles. During 1916 the increase 
11 

was 143 miles. 

A matter of great public interest in 1917 was the retirement 
of the R.N.W.M.P. from all civil duties after 43 years of continuous 
service throughout the West, in bot& military and civil work. The 
work of organizing a provincial force was commenced and on February 5 
the Premier announced that the Alberta Provincial Police Force had

teen estatlished ty urder-in-Council and would te administered ty 
a Commission, which would "...he in entire and absolute control of 
the law enforcement of the province, ho member of the government 
nor any member of the Legislative Assembly will take any part in 
recommending the appointment of any official of any kind. The Super¬ 
intendent of the Force will, consequently te appointed by the Commission, 

11a 

and all his subordinates...." On March 1, 96 men of the authorized 

150 were sworn in. It was estimated that the new force would cost 

12 

$250,000 per year. Four R.H.W.M.P. veterans were appointed Inspectoral 
The force was to be a foot force except for a few mounted sections. 

The departments of the government became less or more active 
during the war, depending upon their functions. The trend was away 
from construction and toward increasing production and raising the 
government revenue, and by 1918 toward an increase in social services. 

To the extent that these ambitions were realized therefore, the depart¬ 
ments of Public Works and Railways and Telephones generally declined 
in importance, the Department of Agriculture advanced to the front 
rank, the Department of Education staggered along as best it could and 
the Secretary’s Department was aggrandized a good deal in 1918 with 
respect to its performance of social functions. 

The Public orks Departmen t gradually cut down in most activities 

until 1917, when high prices of material and the labor shortage forced 

13 

cancellation of all works except those of absolute necessity. In

in the armed forces.

conformity with the overriding need for increased production a 

Drainage Act was passed in 1916, and following amendments thereto 

in 1917 a new Drainage Branch was organized in the Public Works 
14 

Department. The purpose of the Act was to bring more land under 
cultivation in certain wet areas* During the year several petitions 
were received requesting organization of areas as drainage districts; 
in one case it was expected that tenders would be called for and work 
commenced in 1917, and several others were nearly as advanced. 

The drainage problem was further simplified in 1917 by the 
passage of the Reclamation Act. Formerly the ownership and control 
of all lakes and marshes were vested in the Cro¥/n in the right of 
Canada, while control of the drainage land was vested in the Crown in 
the right of the province. This divided jurisdiction interfered with 
drainage of swamp lands, but under the Reclamation Act provision was 
made whereby Vacant Dominion lands included within a Drainage District 
could be purchased from the Dominion by the province and when 
reclaimed, sold?with the proceeds from the sale to be applied to the 
cost of the drainage work. Provision was also made for drainage of 
Dominion lands in connection with the construction of highways, for 
the construction of small drainage projects to be dealt with by the 
Dominion government and for drainage projects initiated by the 
Dominion government under the Provincial Drainage Act. 

The jurisdiction of the department was further increased in 1918 
by the assumption of control over the Hospital for the Insane at 
.roftoka, the Lethbridge Gaol and the Fort Saskatchewan Gaol, all of

which previously had teen the responsitility of the Provincial 
Secretary’s Department. A new Hosi>ital for Returned Soldiers was 
also taken over ty the Department of Public Works when it opened on 
March 14, under the supervision of Dr. D. L. Dick, Medical Superinten¬ 
dent, with thirty-five resident patients. By the end of the year there 

had been 111 patients admitted, four probated and two deaths, leaving 

15 

105 still resident. 

To better enable the department to regulate the growing mining 

industry of the province the Mines Act was amended during the 1918 

.Legislative session. The principle changes made provision for bringing 

all operations incidental to the extraction of coal within the scope 

of the Act, and for requiring monthly reports as to output and 

operations, instead of yearly as formerly. An amendment was also made 

giving the lieutenant Governor in Council power to grant leases for 

mining coal under road allowances, to make arrangements for the 

installation and operation of mine rescue stations to make regulations 

regarding wash houses and emergency hospitals. This is just one aspect 

of the growing concern for social services in 1918. 

R ailways and Teleph o nes. There is little to report of activities 

in this department. By 1917 extension work had borne to a complete stop 

16 

in the telephone branch, and railway construction was very small. As 
well as the pressing need to cut dowh unessential services the reasons 
given for stoppage of telephone extension were labor shortage, material

shortage and price increases. During 1917 Mr* Michener, who was 

still opposition leader at that tim^,expressed doubt as to the 

telephone system being a revenue producing utility. In reply the 

Premier declared that the system was not only paying maintenance and 

a portion of the interest charges on the bonds, but had a surplus of 
17 

some $40,000. Other opposition charges criticized both the lar&e 
expenditures on railway extension and the insufficient extension being 
carried out. By 1918 not only was new construction being minimized 
but even maintenance was reduced to the least possible level to 
avoid diversion of capital and labor from essential war needs. Alberta, 
in common with the whole world was marking time in normal industry 
through the war years. 

E ducatio n. This Department felt that it cculd afford retrench¬ 
ment less than any other branch of the public service and accordingly 
maintained its functions at as high a level as conditions would permit. 

During 1916 preparations were made for the re-education and vocation- 

18 

al .training of the partially disabled returning soldiers. The 
Dominion Government through the Military Hospitals Commission, 
approached the department with a view to securing its advice, cooperat¬ 
ion and assistance. The Provincial Director of Technical Education 
was appointed District Vocational officer to organize and develop 
the special service as quickly and effectively as possible. The 
teacher shortage was constantly becoming more serious, showing a 

17. Cf. E. . Hanson, ou.cit . , If depreciation allowance had been 
included the surplus would have become a deficit.

decrease in the number of student teachers from 601 in 1915 to 438 

19 

in 1916 and 331 in 1917. 

In 1918 the School Law received the following amendments: 

1. Made it compulsory for hoards of trustees in town schools to emplcy 
a doctor to inspect or supervise inspection of pupils once a year. 

2. Raised compulsory age limit from 14 to 15 years. 

3. Fixed minimum yearly salary of $840 for teachers in ungraded 
schools in an attempt to influence students to become teachers. 

4. Provided for an initial grant in library books to each school 
upon its establishment. 

The first annual report of the home for Mentally Deficient Children 
was submitted to the Minister of Education for the year 1918. A house 
was obtained in Edmonton and after extensive changes and rearrangements 
by the Department of Public Works the building was ready for occupancy 
by November 1. A staff was procured under the direction of a Super¬ 
intendent and by the year's end there were 16 patients. 

The Provin c ial Sec re tary's D e partmen t remained quite active since 
it was, to a considerable degree, a collecting department and was 
directly involved in the scramble for additional government revenue. 

In 1915 the total revenue of the department fell off by approximately 
^155,000 because of the decrease in incorporation fees. Following 1915 
the number of companies taking out licenses never reached the peaks 
set earlier. Routine administration remained fairly constant until 
1918 except for the operation of the Theatre Act and the ^otor Vehicles

Act, which were rapidly growing in complexity, in cost and in income. 

In the 1916 legislative Session an Act was passed providing for the 

taxation of theatre and moving picture admissions; the Corporation 

Taxation Act was amended so as to apply to all companies operating 

20 

in the province, including those under Dominion charter. The 
income received from the Theatre Goers Taxation Act, which was placed 
under the control of the Secretary, along with a revenue increase from 
the Railway Tax Act and the constantly expanding corporation taxes 
and motor vehicle receipts, served to put the 1916 departmental revenue 
higher than that of any previous year. 

In 1918 the department relinquished administrative control of 
several functions. On December 8, 1917, by Order"in“Council the 
administration of Gaols and Prisons Act was transferred to the 
Department of Public Works to date from January 1, 1918. A second 
Order-in-Council, September 24, 1918jtransferred the administration 
of the Vital Statistics Act to the Municipal Affairs Department. The 
final transfer was made effective on October 1, when the control of 
the Marriage Ordinance was given to the Municipal Affairs Department. 
Despite the loss of these functions, which the previous year had 
yielded over $80,000 revenue, the department registered an increase 

in revenue of over #250,000 in 1918, which put it over the #1,000,000 

21 

figure for the first time . 

20. But exempting the Farmers* Cooperative Elevator Company.

approximately #42,000 over 1917, and Motor Vehicle Act— increase of 
approximately #365,000. Provincial Secretar y y s Ann. R ep1917-18.

The Public Accounts for 1918 divided this department’s 
expenditures into two principal sections, General Departmental 
expenditures, which remained within the Civil Government expenditures 
of the Public Accounts and General Administration, to which the 
administrative expenditures of the Corporation Taxation Act and 
Motor Vehicles Act were transferred. To a large extent the year 1918 
established the department in the position it was to retain for the 
remainder of the Liberal period. 

Municipal Affair s. As one of the newer departments the Department 

of Municipal Affairs was still in its infancy when the war commenced 

and therefore was unable to settle back and let a well—established 

institutional frame carry it through the war years. The serious 

problems facing the department were made known more fully when the 

•Minister presented his report for 1914 to the Legislature in March 

1915. Among other things, financial conditions were discussed? "This 

state of affairs may be traced to two conditions—the unusual money 

stringency and the rather too optimistic spirit that prevailed in 

some of these mumicipalities in past years, inducing them to incur 

very large liabilities, while the most of our urban municipalities 

will be able to weather the financial storm, it would appear advisable 

that some action be taken in the near future whereby more control will 

be exercised by some central authority to prevent the incurring of 

a large indebtedness which will afterwards form too heavy a load for 

22 

the municipality to carry," 

Following Mr. Gariepy’s reference to these municipal conditions 
the Premier introduced in the Legislature, late in March, a Public 
Utilities Act. This important measure provided for the appointment

of a permanent, non— partisan Commission to be composed of three mem¬ 
bers under 70 years of age, appointed by the government for 10 years 
and removable only by the Lieutenant Governor or by an address from 
the Legislature. The duties of the Board were to include: 

.(1). Supervisory jurisdiction otfer Public Utilities, with power to 
make such orders regarding equipment, appliances, safety devices, 
extension of works or systems that might be necessary for the safety 
or convenience of the public, or for the proper carrying out of any 
contract, charter or franchise involving the use of public property 
or rights. 

(2). Power to make enquiry into the merits of any application by 
a local authority for permission to raise money by debenture or upon 
the security of stock, and the power to grant or refuse such permission. 

Public utilities of cities or towns were to be exempt unless a 

by-law was passed asking for inclusion. Government utilities such 

as telephones and railways under provincial charter came under the 

Act. The Board was vested with judicial powers and no appeal was 

given as to matters of law or fact. Authority was given to supervise 

the borrowing power and policy of municipalities of all kinds and 

even to override city charters or town acts in the matter of sinking 

funds. The measure passed in due course and in October the Commission 

was appointed, with G. H. V. Bulyea, the retiring Lieutenant Governor, 

23 

as Chairman. By 1916 the Deputy Minister declared that many municip¬ 
alities had learned the hard way the necessity of getting their

M. D. of Banff--a member of the ©Id Uorth-Wewt Council in 1889-92 
and of the Assembly until 1900.

business on an absolutely solid foundation. They had been forced 
by this time to the realization that, conditions being what they 
were, to keep on a solid footing they must keep expenditures to the 
minimum necessary to carry on municipal business, in contrast to the 
overfree spending of earlier years. 

A large deputation representing rural interests, Labor bodies 
and other interest groups waited upon Mr. Gariepy on October 28, 1916, 
to urge that a provincial system of public hospitals be established, 
which would include all public hospitals then operating; that the 
province be divided into hospital districts or are^s so arranged 
that hospitals could be established within reasonable reach of all; 
that all hospitals should conform to a provincial standard and be 
erected and equipped under government supervision and inspection, 
and standards for nurses, together with provision for their training; 
that the services of each hospital be available to the residents of 
the district without fees; and that hospitals be better equipped, 
operated and maintained by a tax on the land and other natural resourc¬ 
es. The Minister promised that the Cabinet would seriously consider 
the matter. 

During the 1918 session of the 4th Legislature an Act was passed 
which authorized the Minister of Municipal Affairs to divide the 
province into hospital districts under certain limitations as to 
petitions and number of voters requesting such districts; to fix the 
number of members of the hospital boards and to appoint a proportion 
of them to act with these boards and the Board of Utility Commissioners-

subject to the ratepayers approval— in selection of sites and 
construction of hospitals. 

Several amendments were made to the Town, Village and Rural 
Municipality Acts in the 1918 session. Provision was made by which 
town councils could be dismissed under certain conditions and summer 
resorts could be established as villages; the Rural Municipality and 
Local Improvement Acts were amended so the former Small Local Improve¬ 
ment Districts were done away with and each Local Improvement District 
bedame what was to be called a Municipal District and the former Rural 
Municipalities became Rural Districts, so that the only type of rural 
organization with local self government remaining were Municipal 
Districts. Portions of the province not included within boundaries 
of a city, town, village or municipal district were divided into 
districts known as Improvement Districts which had no self-government. 
All taxes except school taxes within organized school districts were 
levied and collected by the department and the administration of 
affairs in connection with road building, public health and so on, 
was run directly by the Provincial government. 

When the Hon. A. G. MacKay took over as Minister of Municipal 

Affairs in August 1918,he received control not only of the department 

as formerly constituted, but shortly received the added responsibility 

of administering the Public Health Act, the Municipal Hospitals Act, 

the Vital Statistics A.®t, the Marriage Ordinance and control of matters 

25 

pertaining to fublic health nursing. He took on these duties just

in time to get in on the influenza epidemic in October, which greatly 

increased his responsibilities and the importance of Public Health* 

The Public Health Branch of the Department of Municipal Affairs was 

nominally still a branch of the Municipal Affairs Department, but it 

had almost full departmental status in 1918 and was created as such 

the following year. The department came as close as possible to being 

organized along the lines of specialists working toward the promotion 

of the public health* With the exception of the Statistics Branch 

all sections of the department were directed toward actively improving 

26 

health conditions in the province. The activities of this department 
were preventive as well as curative and it operated as such by means 
of increasing sanitations, improving housing conditions, disseminating 
monthly bulletins to publicize the laws, which were rigidly enforded. 
Other important health work along the same lines included medical 
inspection of schools, organization of municipal hospitals, special 
grants to induce medical men to settle in isolated districts, provision 
for looking after the feeble minded and fighting venereal diseases. 

In 1917-18 a new service was added in the form of medical services for 
the care of soldiers # children • Included in the public relations work 
of the department were the showing of health films and exhibits, issuing 
free pamphlets and vaccines. 

The Public ^Health program formulated by the Provincial Board of 

Health the previous year was elaborated in 1918. A prominent item in 

27 

the program was the appointment of 5 .Public HealthHurses. After

receiving special training at the University from Public Health 
specialists these nurses were placed, at various points in the province* 

A laboratory technician wag hired in October to make tests in connect¬ 
ion with the increasing concern about venereal diseases* Early in 
the year two sanitary inspectors were appointed and joined later by a 
third. Owing to the war the department operated with a shortage of 
medical inspectors, and local doctors often had to be engaged to cope 
with infectious diseases* 

Health conditions during 1918 were a matter of great concern to 
the entire government and activity in the health branch was of the 
highest degree of importance. Early in the year smallpox broke out 
and before the epidemic was over it had become probably the worst out¬ 
break in the history of the province with hundreds of cases being 
28 

reported* This outbreak, serious though it had been, was overshadowed 

by the widespread and serious influenza epidemic of October and 

November, which showed 9,206 cases on November 4 and 11,997 by November 
29 

11. Drastic measures were necessary and were accordingly taken; 

public meetings were banned and masks were ordered for barbers, dentists 3 

food handlers, etc* One concurrent aspect of the trouble occurred when 

the demand for liquor and nurses outstripped the supply. The formeas 

prescribed and urgently called for, providing the opportunity for 

many unscrupulous druggists to raise the price greatly in an attempt 

to equate supply and demand. Since available stocks in Canada were 

30 

nearly depleted the problem became acute.

A griculture Department . With the growing concern over the 

importance of increasing agricultural production, the Department of 

Agriculture suffered no decline in activity during the war. The 

salary expenditure of the department increased, in fact, by more 

31 

than 50% in 1915 over 1914. 

The increasing activity of women in public affairs was noticeable 

in the strides being made by the Women’s Institutes of the province. 

Originally under the direction of the Superintendent of Fairs and 

Institutes, by 1915 they had advanced to such an extent that it was 

necessary to provide them with their own superintendent. Although the 

expenses incurred to administer these branches brought on a good deal 

of criticism of the government, it was probably a practical political 

expedient in view of the forthcoming Equal Suffrage Act. The objective 

of these Women’s Institutes was the improvement of social conditions in 

rural and other communities by means of the study of home economics, 

child welfare, disease prevention and other social problems. Their aims 

were to be put into effect by utilizing the Institutes as social centres, 

encouraging -and improving agriculture and agricultural conditions, 

and conducting educational work to further these aims. In general they 

wanted to better home conditions and increase the general fund of health, 

comfort and efficiency. The Institutes increased from 42 branches with 

1,400 members early in 1915 to 135 branches and 3,700 members by late 
33 

1916.

The Publicity Commissioner reported a decided decrease in 
immigration in 1915. The decline had started in 1014, when there 
was a 6% decrease compared to the previous year. The 1915 total 
was a further decrease of 1% compared to 1914. This meant a virtual 
elimination of recent Europeans as a factor influencing the population 
of Alberta., except in natural increase, at which they more than held 
their own. During 1915 however, there were about SO,000 new settlers 
from elsewhere in North America, about 75^ of which were from the 
United States. 

The recording of Vital Statistics was shifted from the office 

of the Deputy Minister to the Medical Officer of Health in 1915 and 

34 

at the same time the latter was made Deputy Registrar General. 

A system of district agents was established by the department 
early in 1916. Men representing the department were stationed at 
Vermilion, Stony Plain, Olds, Sedgewick and Glaresholm. Their work 
for the first year was confined to publicizing themselves, chiefly 
by organizing and supervising boys and girls clubs. The aim was to 
extend departmental activities to assist farmers in their agricultur¬ 
al society work, community center activities, marketing and various 
other functions. The agents were all agricultural graduates with 
extensive farm experience, who could act as on-the-spot representatives 
of the government to encourage the farmers to bring in their problems. 

A few of the many services they were to perform were carrying out 
noxious weed tests, butter fat tests, collecting samples of water for

the provincial analyst and reporting disease outbreaks to the provin¬ 
cial veterinarian* 

The election in 1917 was, to a considerable degree, hinged 
upon the the agricultural policy of the government. After his 
election Premier Stewart credited the Grain Growers organization 
with being a large factor in returning a Liberal government* 

The campaign for increased production was in full swing by 
1917 and the efforts of all branches were directed towa 2 & this end, 
with a consequent increase in work* 

A new system in poultry and egg marketing had, for some time, 
been developing in the province* In 1914 the Dominion Government 
had provided a permanent representative in Alberta in an attempt 
to develop a nation-wide egg marketing service. For two years 
thereafter the province assisted, but soon decided that it would 
have to become more intimately associated with the work if any 
substantial assistance were to be rendered. After negotiations 
with the Dominion Livestock Branch a plan wag agreed upon whereby 
each government would be equally represented on the staff and each 
government would share equally in financing and administration. An 
**Egg Marketing Service” was organized in June 1917, under the direct¬ 
ion of a Poultry Marketing Commissioner and during the remainder 

of the year 182 shipments of eggs were received and marketed for 

35 

20 odd farmers 1 organizations. This service was to be continued 
under the joint supervision of the two departments of agriculture

until the farmers themselves were able to take direct charge of the 
management. At the station, egg shipments from any farmers organ¬ 
izations would be accepted, candled, graded and marketed, and the 
selling price, less operating charges, returned to the shipping 
association• 

A number of new departures in connection with livestock 

conditions in the province were initiated by the Livestock Commiss- 

36 

ioners Board in 1917. These innovations were: 

1* Organization of Breed Associations for the three leading beef 
breeds of cattle* 

2. Government assistance to settlers in purchasing female cattle. 

3. The movement of sheep by rail from the prairies to the Forest 
Reserves for summer grazing. 

4. Establishment of Pig feeding compet limns for children by the 
Swine Breeders' Association at Edmonton. 

5. Holding a baby beef competition at the Calgary fat stock show. 

6. . Entrance of an Alberta herd of cattle at the Chicago International 
Fat Stock Show. 

7. Supplying brood sows to farmers at cost. 

Two other items of interest regarding the agriculture department 
in 1917 were, first, the completion of arrangements with the Dominion 
Census Office, by the Publicity Commissioner, whereby closer cooperat¬ 
ion would be attained and future provincial reports would be identical, 
and released simultaneously with those of the Dominion department;

second was a change of major importance--the transfer of the Public 
Health Branch to the Department of Municipal Affairs. 

The influenza epidemic of 1918 forced the agricultural schools 

to close for the term. This closure, when added to the already 

decreased attendance brought on by the war, curtailed a good deal 

of the departments educational program. The unoccupied and well 

qualified agriculture instructors were available, however, for other 

duties and 16 men were recruited from the teaching staffs to act as 

agricultural representatives. On March 12, the Minister had announced 

a new plan for increasing production. The province was divided into 

16 districts, each in charge of an agent and the whole coordinated with 

the department and aided by a $25,000 grant from the Pood Board. The 

Representatives went out to attempt to prepare more land for crops in 

1919. The results were good in general, although after the first two 

months, when conscription came in, the zeal of the farmers was some** 

37 

what dampened. The patriotic instincts of Alberta farmers and the 
added, appeal of the current high prices for farm products were sufficient 
incentives to increase the amount of land being broken. 

Several important provisions were added to the Dairymen’s Act 
in the amendment carried in the 1918 Session, It had been seen 
years earlier that the demand for Western Canada’s dairy products 
was governed largely by world market conditions andtherefore 
Alberta dairymen were faced with the problem of securing and holding

foreign markets* This necessitated a continued attempt to stabilize 
the commercial side of the dairy business* The additions to the 
Act were such as to encourage efficiency in the handling and manu¬ 
facture of the products, to promote fair competition among manufacurers 
and to help to provide a true recognition of the interests of the 
dairy farmers. Specifically the regulations provided for the examinat¬ 
ion and licensing'of testers of milk and cream in creameries, cream 

38 

stations and cheese factories. Later, regulations were made to 

establish commercial grade standards and grade descriptions of cream. 

The work of the Seed and Weed Branch had by 1918 expanded to 

include such functions as supervision of field crop competitions 

and seed fairs, distribution of seed grain and supervision of weed 
39 

inspection. In addition other educational work along the most 
necessary and practical lines possible was carried out.

Post Wa r Period 1919-21. Although the Armistice was si pried on November 11, 

1918, the inferences and renercussions of the wait continued to be felt through¬ 
out the world. The defeat of the Central Powers, the impoverishment of most of 
Europe and the widespread unrest and economic disenuilibrium precluded hopes for 
any immediate return to normal peacetime conditions. The financial shock of the 
transition to peace proved to be as difficult to surmount as the change to a war 
footing four years earlier. 

In theory, Alberta appeared to be in a strong economic position in 1919. 

With only 7,000,000 acrea of land under cultivation out of an estimated 80,000,000 

acres of good farm land, Alberta had the basis for an ever-increasing production 
1 

and prosperity. Combined with the rich, rolling prairies and great grazing 

districts were considerable quantities of white spruce and puihpwood; extensive 

potential water power: numerous lakes well stocked with fish; plentiful supplies 

2 

of grain and vast coal reserves; immense resources of bituminous sands along 
the Athabasca Paver and gypsum along the Peace River; natural gas and great 
potential oil fields. large irrigation works aided farm production in the south 
and immigrants were beginning to pour into the north country. With all the ro- 
tential of the Province the population was little over half a million with, in 
1918, a production of grain, hay and root crops valued at $128,596,000; animals 
slaughtered and sold worth $50,000,000; dairy and other products valued at $35,575,000. 
Despite this bright picture it must be noted that the economy of any state or 
province depending largely upon export markets cannot achieve a satisfactory 
degree of stability. This is especially true in Alberta, where the product

is predominantly wheat, and therefore is dependent upon favorable weather and 
where transportation charges are excessively high in proportion to the value of 
the goods shipped. 

When all factors are taken into consideration it is not surprising that the 
years 1919, 1920 and 1921 brought about such a decided shift in the political 
makeup of the Province. When the post-war recession proved to be such a hardship 
for Alberta farmers they began to look for a new road to salvation. The diff¬ 
iculties being encountered by the railways, the financial troubles of the muni¬ 
cipalities and the lack of success in negotiations with the Federal government to 
obtain the provincial natural resources did nothing to add to the peace of mind 
of the government. In a desperate endeavour to remain in power the Liberal party 

grew constantly more radical in its attempt to placate the farmers, knowing that 

3 

it was entirely dependent upon them for reelection. The farmers of Alberta were 

believed to be "the most independent, the freest thinking and most radical of the 

" 4 

entire West. In 1919 they appeared to have made up their minds to fight the old 
line parties unitedly as far as Dominion politics were concerned and their entry 
of a .candidate in the provincial by-elections indicated that they were not beyond 
fighting the Stewart government,, The formation ox a U.F.A, political association, 
"to inspire and supervise political constituencies of the province," obviously 
threatened the Stewart government, though there was as yet no absolute breach 
between the government and the U.F.A. as an organization. 

In the Cochrane by-election the decision of the U.F.A. to enter a candidate 
filled the Premier with amazement. Upon receiving the news he said: "Every cent 
I own is in my-farm. I went into the Legislature to further the agricultural 
interest of the province and accordingly my own. It has been my fight ever since

I became -aMinister to see that the farmers of the province were having 

5 

a square deal and I think I have done this with some success.” He had 
always sympathized with the U.F.A. On no occasion had that organization in 
any representation to the government been turned down and generally its 
recommendations had been accepted. 

The U.F.A. platform at Cochrane revolved around the proposed attempt 
to replace the existing government from the throne” with a ’government from the 
people”. They desired a government organization to be based on groups of 
lawyers, doctors, storekeepers, farmers, etc., with representatives in pro¬ 
portion to their numbers, and power based upon the alignment of groups. The 
U.F.A. did not directly attack the legislation or policy of the government, 
and its President, Mr, Wood, stated that Premier Stewart was honorable, upright 
and doing the best he could under the existing political set-up. The subsequent 
election of the U.F.A. candidate on November 3, 1919, by a vote of 729, to 584 
for the Liberal, was a shock to the government and served as a warning of what 
might happen on a province-wide scale. 

• The political alignment of the Province became well established in 1920. 
Although there was only one U.F.A. representative, the future of the government 
was in the hands of those behind that member, and the Legislature was running 
into its fourth year. Premier Stewart made his feelings plain in January when, 
in an address to the Canadian Club at Edmonton, he expressed his lack of faith 
in any class government, and later in Calgary when he stated his complete 
unwillingness to consider a coalition with any other party. 

Events detrimental to government hopes for reelection seemed to pyramid 
at an alnaming rate after the war. Besides the drifting toward active political

action by the U.F.A. there were other damaping happenings. The prohibition 

6 

problem was further aggravated by the influenza epidemic. The revenue of 

the government was becoming less and less adeeuate as expenditures continued 

to mount. The government attempted to avoid the unpleasant duty of imposing 

new taxes and increasing old ones, preferring to borrow and hope that economic 

development would provide the increase in revenue, but it had been necessary to 

add some taxes including the 1917 Amusement tax, the general land tax in 1918, 

a tax on coal production, and several others. The economic expenditnres, many 

of dubious value, with which the government was burdened—telephones, railways, 

roads, police, social legislation, agricultural relief, etc.—were added to 

reluctantly and almost wearily in 1920, when the deficit was at a peak of 

7 

$8,000,000 and in 1921 at $16,000,000. Pressure from the electors and fear of 
the U.F.A. had become too strong to permit any retrenchment. Even as they were 
vainly striving to recapture popular support the Liberals were helping to strength¬ 
en the charges current that they were recklessly extravagant. They were faced with 
a dilemma that they failed to solve. 

Probably the most damaging of all to Liberal hopes was the trend in 
agricultural conditions. Originally and to a large degree Alberta was a ranching 
country. When agriculture began to grow and develop, settlement and farming 
went together. Many of the farms which spread to the south were entering an. 
area best fitted for grazing, and which without irrigation, was not well adapted 
for agriculture, consequently extreme difficulties were encountered in bad years 
by many Alberta farmers. There had been no really good crop year since the war 
and in 1921 the low point was reached. A good start was spoiled by dry and hot

spells, widespread bail, abnormal insect pests and bad soil drifting. Added 
difficulties appeared in the form of falling prices and a new tariff which 
excluded cattle from the United States market. In his report the Deputy 
Minister of Agriculture described 1921 as one of the most difficult years ever 
experienced by the Alberta farmers; as well as the above mentioned troubles 
were high freight-rates, complete crop failure in parts of the south and high 
prices for many farming requirements. 

From the first of the year it was fairly obvious that the TJ.F.A. would 
oppose the Stewart government at the next election. A resolution passed at 
the Convention of January 18-21 decided in favour of province-wide participation 
in provincial politics. On July 1, the U.F.A. headqtiarters issued a Declaration 
of Principles in which it was stated that the existing political confusion in 
Canada was largely brought about through dissatisfaction with the party system, 
and that since the representatives and the electors were not closely enough 
connected the people desired a greater measure of self government. To correct 
this state of affairs the U.F.A. proposed to emphasize stability of organization 
by requiring each elected representative to be answerable directly to the 
organization in the constituency that elected him. There was no formal leader 
of the Farmers in the campaign, although, to all intents and purposes, President 
H. W. Wood held that position. He was not a candidate but toured the province 
making speeches and assisting in organization. An unofficial alliance existed 
between l a bour and the Farmers. Conditions in the province were evidently unusual and 
a matter of bewilderment to the Liberals. Speaking in Edmonton on July 4? 

Mr. Stewart said that his meetings had been sympathetically received but he 
added: ’’There is a situation in the cities and in the province that I cannot 
describe. Apparently in Calgary every species of opinion is being represented 






113 . 


by a candidate. In city and country there is an unsettled condition, an idea 

that some change may be made, but as too well thought out, concentrated opposit- 

8 

ion it does not seem in evidence.” 

It has been stated that even before the 1921 elections were called the old 

9 

parties were in full retreat. The Conservative party split into two factions, 

one calling itself Independent Conservatives and grouped around George H 0 adley. 

Their influence remained in the towns and cities but was negligible in the rural 

districts. The Moderates and Prohibitionists remained as slight factors especially 

among women voters. The Campaign was not fought on the issue of personalities 

except for Mr. Stewart, who was pitting his great popularity against the powerful 

10 

organization represented by the U.F.A. It was to StLewart's credit that the 

Farmers' candidates hardly ever attacked his government as such, and he was the 

only candidate elected by acclamation. ‘When the votes were counted however, 

the feelings of the voters were finally shown; to quote Mr. Thomas again: "When 

a new and indiginous movement ( the U.F.A. ) appeared, the only answer by the 

Liberals was appeasement and when the new movement decided to adopt direct action 

” 11 

the Liberals were powerless to resist. 

The standings of the various political groups before and after the elections 
11a 

were as follows:

A meeting of the 38 U.F.A. representatives was called for July 26, at Calgary. 

It was announced that the president H. W. Wood, Herbert Greenfield, 0. L. McPherson, 

George Hoadley and d . E. Brownlee were nominated for the leadership. Mr. Wood 

declined and spoke in favour of Brownlee, who also withdrew when he heard some 

objection to a lawyer. Mr. Greenfield who was then elected, was described by the 

Calgarv Albertan (Lib) as: !, A strong, sane, vigorous, well informed farmer, British 

born and British educated, Canadian trained, he has had extensive experience in 

two provinces. A resident for some years in Ontario, a pioneer in the North of 

Alberta, one of the homesteaders himself, he knows well the trials and troubles of 

the thousands of pioneers in the provinces, and the problems of the hundreds of 

12a 

thousands who are not pioneers.” 

During the declining years of the liberal Government there was a decided change 
in the emphasis given to the relative importance of the departments. The Department 
of Public Works and its offshoot, Railways and Telephones, which had held such 
an important place during the first few years of Alberta*s history, were keeping 
their activities to a minimum, the ’’catch-all”, Secretary’s Department continued

relatively uncharged after the war, as did the Department of Education, while 
activities in the Department of Agriculture were necessarily of continued import¬ 
ance. The most important and rapid developments occurred in the field of social 
services as represented by the appearance of the Public Health Department and the 
general swing toward public welfare activities, which were largely introduced in 
answer to the demands of the organized farmers. 

The Department of Public Works was slightly busier in 1919 than in previous 
years, but it was not until 1921 that construction was resumed on an anpreciable 
scale. In that year most branches reported a considerable general increase in 
activities. The work and staff of this Department had been gradually growing 
after the war as a result of the Increased need for consultation and construct¬ 
ion services in connection with work undertaken by other departments. 

One continual worry to the Public Works Department had been tho problem of 
maintaining coal production, which averaged only about 50 % of the capacity of 
Alberta's mines. In June the Stewart government appointed a commission to enquire 
into the coal industry of the province. The report, made public on December 30, 
stated that many Alberta mines operated only six months or less per year and that 
more continuous operation would reduce the price to consumers and assure steadier 
employment. It criticized methods of settling disputes, living, housing, sanitary 
and other technical matters. On April 26, 1920, the department turned the 
administration of the Mines Branch over to the Provincial Secretary's Department, 

The Department of Railways and Telephones resumed construction and prepara¬ 
tion for construction in 1919 for the first time since the early war years, but 

high costs minimized such work. Little headway was made in railway construction 

13 

in 1920; nevertheless the Department h„d a trying year. The railway question,

always acute in Alberta, developed a new difficulty in the form of rapidly 
increasing operating costs, which developed into huge deficits over most of the 
country. This factor was particularly damaging, to the sparsely populated lines 
in the North, which operated at an increasing loss until 1920, when the accumul¬ 
ated deficit reached such a large amount that the railway companies could no longer 
carry on operations. On July 28 the announcement was made that the possession and 
control of the A. & G. W. had been formally assumed by the provincial government 
and a new company had been formed with Premier Stewart as president, four other 
ministers as directors, and the Deputy Minister of Railways as secretary of the 
board. The Premier explained that, although control had not been obtained by 
foreclosure proceedings, the government had secured a proper transfer of stock 
and would exercise full control over the system both in operation and extension, 
with an option given to J. D. McArthur for the re-purchase of the system at any 
time within the next seven years upon repayment to the Province of all expendit¬ 
ures incurred. The amount of the Province's indirect liabilities in this respect 
was about $7,000,000. In addition to this transfer the C.P.R. assumed responsib¬ 
ility for the management and operation of the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British 
Columbia Railway for a period of five years. 

Railway construction remained small in 1921, but activity remained high in 
the government operated lines and those lines in which the government was heavily 
interested. The northern lines required further large sums to be brought to 
completion and placed in a Condition which would permit economical operation. 

Legislation was passed authorizing loans to the amount of $4?700,000 to several 

small companies, and there were advances made amounting to $4>334>811.16 to 

the E. D. & B. C., Central Canada Railway, Lacombe and North Western and the A.&

Telephone construction was resumed on a larger scale in 1921. The rural 

branches added 2,050 miles of poles and 4*449 subscribers. Long distance lines 

13b 

were increased by 482 pole miles and 6,524 wire miles. A new automatic exchange 
was completed in Calgary and one was commenced at Lethbridge. Business fell off 
during the last two or three months of the year and caused some concern. The 
system was looked over carefully and at all possible spots operating expenses 
were cut. A revision of wage schedules was made to commence January 1, 1922, to 
reduce the payroll by approximately 10$. It was stated in the annual report of 
the Department that the general business depression was the principal cause of 
the loss of revenue. Undoubtedly however there was a general tightening of 
government expenditures by the U.F.A. in an attempt to cut the overwhelming deficits 
being incurred. 

As stated above, the Provincial Secretary’s Department had practically no 
14 

changes after 1918. The one exception was when the administration of the Mines 

Act was assumed by the Department upon the authority of an Order in Council dated 

April 29, 1920. This made the Secretary, in effect, Minister of Mines, although 

departmental status was not immediately forthcoming for the branch. Administration 

of the Act was important because of the difficulties being encountered in maintaining 

15 

production and markets and the labour troubles current , As a revenue producer, 
the Mines Branch was only exceeded by the receipts under the Motor Vehicles and 
Corporation Taxation Act. In 1918 the Motor Vehicles Act revenue had risen 
to over 50$ of the income of the Department and in 1920, when the %nes Branch

at Winnipeg for #9.75 per ton, compared to $12.75 to $15.50 for Alberta coal. 
Production in Alberta, according to federal figures, was valued at $29,458,531 
compared to $33,586,456 in 1920. Total tonnage dropped from 7,010,845 to 5,989,736. 
At the close of 1921 there were 12,201 mine employees. C.A.R ., 1921, p. 322.

was taken over, these three branches supplied over 75$ of the departmental 

revenue. The administrative staff of the Department was apportioned in accord- 

16 

ance with the comparative revenue producing ability of the various branches. 

An effort was made in 1919 to raise the qualifications and increase the 
number of teachers becoming available in Alberta. The first was done by increas¬ 
ing the Normal School teacher training course from four to eight months, the 

second bv the announcement that the government would make loans to all Qualified 

17 

student teachers in financial need. This loan provision immediately brought 
about a 40$ increase in Normal School attendance. The opening of a Normal School 
in Edmonton in January 1920, with a class of 110 students, was an incentive to 
northern students to train as teachers. 

A further lift to educational standards was obtained in 1919 when the School 
Grants Act was amended to increase materially the grants for secondary education 
to schools which would provide for the teaching of non-resident students. It was 
hoped in this way to make it possible for farm children to receive a more equal 
opportunity for education. 

A comparison of education facilities between December 31, 1906,and December 
31, 1920,was printed in the Department’s annual report for 1920. There were 602 
school districts in the Province on the earlier date and 3,533 on the later— 
an average of over 200 formed per year. Four consolidated schools were organized 
in 1920 to make a total of 67, The remainder of the table is as follows:

T.hs 1921 recession, the collapse in prices of farm products, and general 

18 

deflation were not so detrimental to education as might be imagined. The period 
of adjustment brought with it, as a natural conseauence, the curtailment of exp¬ 
enditures by corporations and individuals, which, in turn, brought stagnation in 
business and industry, and unemployment. The formerly heavy demand for the services 
of jroung boys and girls dropped, and being unemployed, many young people returned 
to their studies. The increase in all high and continuation schools in the Province 
was very large. 

The Department of Agriculture established a Soil Investigation branch of the 

19 

Schools of Agriculture in the Spring of 1919. With headquarters at Olds this 
branch secured laboratory facilities at the Olds, Vermilion and Claresholm schools. 
Experiments included work with rotations, cultural methods and application of 
manure. The varying soil types in different areas made a decentralization of 
stations desirable and the linking of field investigation with the school laborat¬ 
ories made for a highly scientific caliber of work. 

The Winter of 1919-20 was the start of the most trying period experienced in 
Alberta agriculture to that time. A heavy snowfall early in October caught a good 
deal of the crop in stook and the continued snowfall and severe winter added to 
the feed shortages in some areas, giving rise to a critics1 condition. The 
Department imported hay from the other provinces to be sold at cost, but the stock

losses were still heavier than in any previous year. Relief, in the form of 
household necessities was provided to some families. Considerable work in connect¬ 
ion with the free transportation of haying outfits, livestock and feed was handled 
by the Seed and Weed branch. 

Despite the bad year the demand for greater educational facilities remained 

high. Three new Schools of Agriculture were commenced in the Summer of 1919 and 

completed in the Autumn of 1920. The Province was divided into six school areas 

with the schools and the demonstration farms in each to be managed together under 

the direction of a superintendent. The Peace River work was to be directed from 

20 

Grand Prairie by the former Livestock Commissioner. 

Although agricultural production was good in all but some southern areas in 

1920, the existing difficulties were heightened by a great slump in the prices of 

all farm products, especial3.y cattle and sheep. Dairy products remained an 

exception and the total dairy production was valued at $34,000,000, an increase 

for the year of 10 %, brought about chiefly by the continued rise in price of 

21 

creamery butter and dairy products. 

Conditions in 1921 deteriorated still more. Prices for most farm products took 
another serious drop with no corresponding decrease in the price of household- 
necessities and farm equipment. Bank policy generally restricted loans. As a 
result most farmers were forced to reduce their scope of operations. The high 
freight rates were lowered slightly but expenses were still excessively high, 
especially to grain farmers. 

Agricultural incidents of 1921 included the establishment in Edmonton of a 
cooperative Potato Marketing Association under the direction of the Poultry and 
Egg Marketing Commissioner; transfer of the office of the Dairy Commissioner from

Calgar 3 r to Edmonton for departmental convenience; formation of Women*s 

Institute branches, making a total of 330 in Alberta with approximately 13,300 
22 

members. An agricultural service far beyond the capabilities of the department 

was performed for the farmers of southern Alberta by Mr. C. M. Hatfield, a 

California, rainmaker. For a. fee of $8,000, for two months operation, he agreed 

to provide rain in the vicinity of Medicine Hat. After being deluged for about 

a month the farmers banded together to request a. few days respite, confident of 

23 

his ability to stop as well as start the rain. ^o additional information is 

available as to his operations in Canada. 

The drought conditions elsewhere in the south of the Province accentuated the 

importance of the irrigation work, which had been pursued for about two years, and 

accelerated the popular movement for additional works. Southern Alberta was anxious 

for a positive government irrigation policy, but the Stewart government in 1920 

was definitely afraid of a problem involving the 1,500,000 acres of land which would 

benefit by irrigation, at an estimated cost of $100,000,000. Earlier tentative 

legislation had failed because of the inability of the Lethbridge Northern Irrigation 

24 

District to sell its bond issue. In April the provincial government decided to 

guarantee principal and interest of the bonds of the Lethbridge Northern District, 

25 

a policy that was supported practically unanimously by the Legislature. 

By the end of 1921, in addition to the existing 361,000 acres of C.P.R. 
irrigation works and the Canada L^nd and Irrigation System of 50,000 acres, there

should let the contract for construction,and exercise general supervision of the 
trustees. The district to be dealt with comprised 104,758 acres, water to be obtained 
from The Old Man River.

was a completed Taber system of 17,000 acres under the Alberta Act, with the 

Lethbridge Northern’s proposed 105,000 acres, the United Irrigation District of 

23,000 acres and the South Macleod Irrigation District of 50,000 acres, under way. 

In view of the phenomonal growth reported in the Municipal Affairs Department 

the 1921 report contained a summary comparing the existing duties with those of 

1912. In 1912 the Department had been responsible for the administration of four 

acts, and various other duties, chiefly in the tax field. In 1921 the acts giving 

scope to the work of the Department numbered 19 besides several other acts of 

general import with which the Department was concerned.

The 1912 correspondence amounted to 88,340 communications received and 

149 ,889 dispatched; in 1921 it was, respectively 64 ,358 and 198 , 698 . The 

Correspondence branch in 1921 kept a book of original entry for all cash coming 

in by mail, amounting to $2,524,199.36. The collections in 1912 had amounted to 

$294,429.03. The approximate revenue of the Department as late as 1914 was only 

27 

$110,000, while in 1921 it was $2,571,000. 

Under the provisions of the Municipality Act three travelling Municipal 

inspectors were attached to the Department. For convenience the Province was 

divided into three p ? rts, e (? ch inspector being responsible for the annual inspect-

auditors were examined by the inspectors, and special reports were made and sent 
to the mayor or reeve concerned and to the Department. These inspectors were 
actually advisors to the municipalities and occupied an important position in 
obtaining maximum efficiency in the work of the Department. 

A special officer was also employed by the Department to check all reports 
and audits of municipalities. His work enabled the Department to decide intelli¬ 
gently as to the efficiency of auditors and was meant to protect the municipalities 
by assuring correct financial statements. 

A Tax Commissioner and a special inspector were employed to assist the 
deputy minister in the work of administration. The commissioner hiad special 
control over taxation and the special inspector assisted the Deputy in all other 
administration. 

By 1921 the Department had become responsible for levying and collecting all 
taxes, other than school taxes and irrigation rates, in all of the improvement 
districts of the Province. The territory covered by this assessment was in 215 
improvement districts and included the levy and collection of the Wild Land Tax. 

This required a number of assessors to travel over the territory early in the year 
and remain in the office for the remainder of each year. The Department supervised 

all the municipalities in the province in regard to the levy and collection of 

- 

the Wild Land tax. This reouired a number of assessors to travel over the territory 
early in each year. The Department supervised all the municipalities in the Prov¬ 
ince in regard to the levy, collection and transmittance to the Department of 
all taxes levied on behalf of the Province. In addition to putting through tax 
recovery proceedings for taxes levied by itself, the Department acted in the same 
respect for irrigation districts and all school districts levying taxes in improve¬ 
ment districts. 

As well as these executive employee© there were two advisory bodies within 
the Department. The Municipal Finances Commission appointed in 1919 was composed 





124 . 


of three judges and one other member. Its duties consisted of examining various 
applications and recommendations and making reports on them in relation to the 
financial situation of the municipality concerned. 

An Assessment Equalization Board was appointed in April 1920 and commenced 
preliminary work in visiting urban municipalities and searching records of 
assessment and land values. Preparations were made toward formulating a more 
equitable system of assessment which it was hoped would be accepted by the 
government. 

The Department of Public Health was small but attained a high status in its 

first year. The act creating the Department was passed at the 1919 session of the 

Legislature, with A. G. MacKay as the first minister, heading the second provincial 

30 

Department of Health in Canada. 

Mr, MacKay commenced the expansion of his Department during the Legislative 
session March 18, when he presented amendments to the Public Health Act. The 
changes provided that in future local boards of health would be held responsible 
for local health precautions; restaurants and public food dispensers would be 
more rigidly supervised; local health boards would be compelled to report to the 
provincial Department so that a staff of sanitary and health inspectors could 
energetically follow up complaints and enforce health regulations; undertakers were 
to be licensed and their fees regulated; vaccinations were to be made compulsory 
except where distances were prohibitive. On March 27 the legislation was further 
explained and amplified into the basis of a system of state fostered, and protected 
public health; the above Acts were placed under the jurisdiction of the Department 
and steps were taken to assemble qualified officials.

the collection, tabulation a.ndidissemination of information relating to public 
health throughout Canada.

The new Department was responsible for the administration of the following 
acts: the Public Health Act, the Public Health Nurses Act, The Registered Nurses 
Act, the Municipal. Hospitals Act, the Vital Statistics Act, the Hospitals Ordinance, 
the Venereal Diseases Prevention Act, the Medical Profession Act, the Dental Assoc¬ 
iation Act and the Marriage Ordinance. The establishment for the first year called 
for a Deputy Minister, three medical officers of health, one sanitary engineer, two 
sanitary inspectors, two clerk-stenographers. 

At this time there were 49 hospitals in the Province under government super¬ 
vision, receiving grants of $100,000 per year. The Minister expressed his opinion 
that ten more hospitals would be established within the year and a number of new 
districts would be formed; that the health inspection of public schools would be 
urged and carried out at least once annually with specially trained nurses to be 

made available by the government for this purpose; that the problem of infant mort¬ 

ality would be tackled by providing housekeepers and nurses; and that tuberculosis , 
of which there were over 3,000 cases, would be combatted by building a sanitarium 
at Bowness—mainly for soldiers for 5 years, and later to become provincial property 

The sudden death of Mr. MacKay, on April 24, 1920, was a decided loss to the 

government. Not only had he made vast strides in his own departments, but he was 

also considered a likely candidate for future party leadership and, it was hoped, 
for the office of Premier, On April 30 he was replaced by C. R. Mitchell, the 
Provincial Treasurer, who was assigned the duties of Minister of Health and Minister 
of Municipal Affairs in addition to his own Department. Since he was forced to 
retire in August 1921, it is obvious that these two departments were quite unsettled 
in their leadership during these years. 

By 1920 there were seven separate branches or divisions in the Department, and 

31 

in 1921 the first detailed reports were submitted, as follows:

The Provincial Board of Health was the technical adviser of the Department 
on matters of public health. It was composed of the Provincial Medical Officer 
of Health, the Provincial Sanitary Engineer and the Provincial Bacteriologist. 

The Board dealt with regulations for the improvement of sanitary conditions as 
proposed by the Sanitary Engineer, and general betterment of provincial health 
conditions. In 1921 the power of the Board was increased, by the' passing of an act 
which gave it power to make rules and regulations for the licensing, construction, 
maintenance, operation and inspection of, and provision for medical attendance at, 
Maternity Homes, together with the licensing of midwives. The Chairman of the Board 
was the Provincial Medical Officer of Health, who was also personally in charge of 
the conditions in the Province respecting infectious and contagious diseases. In 
1921 the Provincial Medical Officer of Health also assumed the duties of Deputy 
Minister, thus centralizing these three important functions and preventing a possible 
clash of personalities. 

Provincial Sanitary Engin eer. The basic work of this branch was the same 
as that donducted in the past. A great deal of work properly belonging to local 
boards was being done by the Department. Experience had shown that where drastic 
steps were necessary to "obtain sanitary conditions the local boards would not take 
such steps so the Province, in the interests of the general health, and to assist 
the local board, had undertaken the supervision of this work. 

Director of Provincial laboratory . (Provincial Bacteriologist). The 
laboratory was operated by the University of Alberta with a grant mid by the 
Province, for which the University maintained and operated the laboratory and 
examined all specimens submitted, free of charge. The importance of laboratory 
research for advancement in public health work was being realized more and more, 
and the laboratory was attempting to increase its work in this respect. 

Public Health Nursing Branch . This branch had been making slow progress 
since its formation in 1918 with a staff of four nurses. By the end of 1921 
there were seventeen on the staff. The work of the branch consisted of school

health inspection, child welfare and baby clinics, lecture work, public health 
exhibits and district nursing. 

The Municipal Hospitals Branch was intended to investigate territories 
which were proposed as Municipal Hospital Districts. Financial conditions had 
retarded, to some extent, much expansion in this respect. 

Venereal Diseases Branch. Clinics were maintained at Edmonton, Calgary, 
Lethbridge and Medicine Hat. Technical literature was sent to physicians and 
non-technical literature was distributed to the general public. The work 
of this branch was developed along four general lines: (l) Treatment of the 
infected. (2) Education of the infected. (3) Education of non-infected. (4) 
Examination of nolice court cases. 

Vital Statistics Branc h. The Vital Statistics Act was amended in 1921 to 
make the Deputy Minister of Health,Registrar General and to. authorize the 
amointment of a deputy with specific powers to give burial permits and enforce 
registration. The administration of the Act in Calgary was changed by placing 
the registry office under a full time departmental employee.

CHAPTER VI 

Summary 

'5 

. 


































128 


The executive branch of the Alberta government is modeled 
on the British cabinet system—each department is headed by a 
cabinet minister, who is appointed by the Prime Minister and who 
must be elected to the Legislature. The province commenced its 
operations in 1906 with six departments: Agriculture, Education, 

Public Works, Secretary, Attorney General and Treasurer. All the 
departments were relatively small at that time, and their functions 
were, in many cases, not definitely settled. During the ensuing years 
changes were made as a result of conscious planning and in answer to 
the numerous demands of the electorate. 

The Department of Public Works was fundamentally intended to build 
and maintain the public works of the province. Hoads, bridges, ferries 
and public buildings constituted the bulk of these, with other less 
basic requirements, such as telephones appearing from time to time. As 
well as these activities there were other matters assigned to the 
department for varying periods. Examples of duties coming under the 
latter category were the administration of municipal affairs, inspect¬ 
ion of mines and steam boilers, with certain licensing and regulatory 
powers. In most cases, when these auxiliary functions grew too burden¬ 
some, they were transferred elsewhere to a,void any possibility of 
inadequate performance of these or the primary duties of the department. 

In view of the several relatively unconnected functions to be 
performed, the department was organized by dividing the duties into 
branches, organized according to their individual purposes. The 
correspondence and accounting branches were able to handle all the work 
of the department in respect to their own lines, but the other branches 
operated on a more vertical plane, each independent of the other branches, 
but subordinate to and coordinated by the Deputy Minister.

The widespread area covered by the public works of the province 
influenced the organization of the department to a large degree. 

Roads, bridges etc., had to be carefully planned to give the greatest 
benefit with the least protest; inspection duties were often inadequate 
because of the mileage to be covered, particularly before the general 
use of the automobile. Finally, the staff was often kept to a 
minimum because of the revenue problems of the government. 

The Department of Agriculture had, as its central policy, the duty 
of developing first class farming conditions through educating the 
farmers of the province. The early years of the department saw its 
organization developed almost entirely around this one policy. Branch¬ 
es were formed, each making its individual efforts along some purposive 
line, such as dairying, weed prevention, etc. The only departure from 
the singularly agricultural activities lay in collecting vital statis¬ 
tics, and the provincial health services which, curiously, were handled 
by the department for several years in the branches of the Provincial 
Health Officer, Director of the Laboratory, and the Sanitary Engineer. 
With these exceptions, the department was organized along lines similar 
to the Department of Public Works, with branches operating to carry 
out specific purposes. 

A greater degree of administrative decentralization was 

necessary in the Department of Agriculture to maintain contact 

between responsible representatives and the individual farmers in 

all the scattered farm areas of the province. For this reason the 

department was decentralized considerably, especially in its agricult- 

1 

uaal schools, which naturally had to go to the people. This was also 

1. Decentralized is used here chiefly as a synonym for the deconcentrat 

ion of administration although there was also a certain amount of 
administrative discretion allowed to the branch head.

true of inspection services for dairying, weeds, "brand recording and 
the like. 

It is probably valid to say that the Department of Agriculture 
made the greatest gains in importance of all the departments during the 
liberal regime. In 1905 the frontier nature of the province, and the 
predominantly ranching activities of the largest group of the settlers, 
made other agricultural progress a matter of secondary concern. As the 
wheat farmers began to equal and surpass the ranchers, both in mmbers 
and in influence, their demands became mandatory upon the government not 
only with reppect to the Department of Agriculture, but in all aspects 
of government. 

The Department of Education was in a better position to correlate 
all its staff in an organized body to carry out its more straightforward 
task— the control of all educational matters in the province, with the 
exception of the agricultural schools. The department was organized on 
a functional basis determined by the tasks to be performed, and it was 
able to carry on with relatively few disruptions or unusual circumstances 
arising. 

When the province was organized the system of school administration 
previously in use was' continued . As settlements were made school district 
were organized. As fresh settlers arrived and took up homes beyond the 
boundaries of the original districts they found distances to the earlier 
schools too great, and had to organize their own new distriqts. Parents 
on the borders of the old districts were faced with the question of 
whether to enter the new district and help with the higher cost of new 
buildings or to stay with the old district and let their children have 
long walks to school. In most cases the purse strings proved stronger 
than the apron strings and the long walks continued. This resulted in

a system of districts in which those first formed were large, composed 
of good land and having low rates of taxation; the newwr districts, on 
the other hand$ were often formed from left over areas, meaning poorer 
lands with fewer settlers and thus higher taxation rates. The situation 
was far from being equitable. 

Provision for secondary education in the rural districts was 

far from adequate. One room schools could not provide it, and climatic, 

geographic and economic conditions made the establishment of many 

consolidated schools impossible. Rural high schools were a help but 

local districts were slow to see this and consequently only 16 rural 

2 

high school districts were organized in 16 years. Many local districts 
considered that their duties were fulfilled when they made grade eight 
available, and they were reluctant to pay fees for students attending 
more advanced schools in other villages or towns. School boards were 
also faced with difficulties in obtaining mutual cooperation because 
of local antagonisms, thereby adding to the difficulties of rural 
pupils. Although little progress was made in this direction there was 
a growing concern to see that the rural child received as much opportun¬ 
ity for education as his urban counterpart. 

The Provincial Secretary, as mentioned previously, was not bound 
to any rigid pattern of duties. Beyond the fundamental purposes of 
the department its responsibilities ranged all the way from issuing 
marriage and peddlers* licenses to the administration of the provincial 
gaols and the mental hospital. By 1921 the branches in charge of the 
Motor Vehicles Act, the Coal Mines Act, the Theatre Act and the Corp¬ 
oration Taxation Tax Act had grown so large that they dwarfed the 
general office, which handled the administration of all other matters 
under the direct supervision of the Deputy Secretary.

The newer departments of Municipalities and Railways and 
Telephones were set up in 1912 along somewhat different lines from 
the older departments. The assumption of the telephone system of 
the province and the operation of railway lines meant that to a 
large extent the Department of Railways and Telephones functioned 
along lines similar to private enterprises with the Minister carrying 
out the government’s policy. 

The provincial government had changed by 1921 from a small tody 
hesitantly attempting to satisfy the essential needs of a few settlers, 
to a large organization entering constantly into the fields of public 

welfare and operation of outlie services. The total administrative 

3 

expenses amounted to $121,792 in 1906 and $730,784 in 1921, and this 
is not a true indication of the growth, since, as functions grew, 
they were transferred from the section of the Accounts listed as Civil 
Government, to other sections, meaning that all administrative costs 
would not te lumped together. The growth of expenses and salaries 

was' finally brought to a temporary halt by the U.T.A. government in 

4 

1922 in an attempt to stop the constantly grc?/ing deficits.

A. &. (r, W. Affair 

To understand the A. and G. W. matter fully the earlier events 
must be known. Since 1905 the M .L..A-; for the Peace River district 
had been struggling to attain a railway service between Edmonton 
and Athabasca Landing. In 1905 he obtained a Dominion charter for 
a line from Edmonton to Fort McMurray, which was purchased in 1908 
by W. R. Clarke, an American railroad promoter. This charter was 
later abandoned by Clarke, who then negotiated with the Alberta govern¬ 
ment and made arrangements under which the Rutherford government agreed 
to back bonds to the extent of $20,000 per mile for a, maximum of 
350 miles.' 1 " The bonds bore interest at 5% for a fifty year term. They 
were to be sold, the proceeds to be credited to the Alberta govern¬ 
ment, and the A. & G. W. Company to be paid on progress certificate 
as the work proceeded, with no payment until the first 10 miles were; 
completed. Bonds of $400,000 were also guaranteed for the construct¬ 
ion of terminals at Edmonton. 

The bonds were sold by Clarke to the J. P. Morgan Company of 
New York and London, at par; they in turn sold them in London at 110 
for a $740,000 profit. Feeling ^rew strong in Alberta and there was 
a general impression that provincial interests were being insufficient¬ 
ly safeguarded. In protest W. H. Cushing submitted his resignation, 
and on February 17, 1910, it was accepted. A group of Liberal 
’•insurgents”, supported by the Edm onton Bulletin and the Calgary 
Albertan , pointed out the weakness and looseness of construction 
of the contract. R. B. Bennett spoke for five hours on March 2, 
in a speech of unmercifully critical analysis; among his charges he 
stressed the sloppy construction of the guarantee provision and failure 
to safeguard provincial interests. He alleged that, of the difference

between par and the 110 received by the Morgana, Clarke and his 
colleagues had pocketed between #250,000 and $300,000. A Royal 
Commission was hurriedly appointed to investigate whether any members 
of the government were interested, to their advantage, in the railway 
matter. Shortly thereafter Premier Rutherford submitted his resig¬ 
nation and the Lieutenant Governor called upon the Hon. A. L. Sift on 
to form a new government. The Royal Commission closed on July 7, 1910, 
and on November 10 a majority report signed by Chief Justice Harvey 
and Justice Scott, and a minority report signed by Justice Beck were 
submitted to the Legislature. The majority report considered the 
government mildly censurable in some of its arrangements and actions; 
it accepted the denial of Rutherford and Cross as to any personal 
interest in the enterprise and stated that the evidence did not indi¬ 
cate any such interest. The minority report exonerated the govern¬ 
ment and criticized Mr. Cushing for his charges and attitude in the 
affair. The Liberal Lethbridge Herald and Ca lgary A lbertafi^and the n 
C onservative Edmonton Journal and Calgary jieraid considered that the 
report indirectly condemned the Rutherford government. 

On June 3, the new Sift on ministry was announced, and the new 
Premier stated that, in general, his policy would follow that of his 
predecessor. In 1911 the railroad policy of the new government was 
to lead to more problems of a legal nature. On November 24, 1910, 
the Premier introduced a Bill based on the failure of the A. & G. W. 
Company to proceed with the enterprise. The result was legislative 
cancellation of the project and arrangement on the grounds that the 
company had defaulted in the payment of interest. The Sifton govern¬ 
ment then intended to use the money for other general purposes of 
provincial development. The Morgan interests and the Engliah bond

holders contended that the money should revert back to them if not 
used for the purpose intended. The result was a complex situation 
involving suits against the government. The railway, construct ion, 
and supply companies involved made claims for damages. The Royal 
Bank brought suit for reimbursement of money paid out in connection 
with the project and for accraed and accruing interest. In all, the 
claims amounted to about $3,500,000, of which $2,500,000 was for the 
construction company. 

It was not until 1913 that the A. & G. W. affair was finally 
settled. By that time it had caused the downfall of the Rutherford 
government, created a long legal dispute and entailed difficult 
financial obligations. In summary, the circumstances leading up to 
the lawsuit were: proceeds of the 50 year, 5% bonds were deposited 
as follows, Royal Bank of Canada at Edmonton—$6,000,000, Dominion 
Bank $1,000,000, Union Bank $400,000. Upon taking office, Sifton 
passed a bill declaring that the railway company had defaulted, and 
that the province, while ratifying and confirming the guarantee, 
would consider the whole $7,400,000 with accrued interest “...a part of 
the general revenue fund of the province•.." and free from any claim 
of the A. & G. W. Company. At the same time the province undertook 
financial responsibility to the bondholders and agreed to indemnify 
the railway company from claims made under the Ifoonds• Varied litigat¬ 
ion followed the refusal of the banks to accept the Act, and disputes 
arose between the government bondholders, promoters, contractors etc. 

On November 4, 1911, the Alberta Supreme Court decided in favor 
of the government as against the Royal Bank, which was representing

all three banks. A succeeding appeal to the Supreme Court of 
Canada en banc sustained the decision of April 13, 1912, and the 
case then went to the Privy Council. In the meantime the government 
was unable to draw on the money, though on the strength of its 
future convertibility large sums had been borrowed in London. On 
January 31, 1913,the final decision in favor of the Royal Bank, 
was given by the Judicial Committee. The judgement was a hard blow 
politically. It left the government with a large temporary indebt¬ 
edness; it gave the opposition a good political weapon; it involved 
interest payments on the original bonds and on other loans; finally 
it delayed still further the plan to extend the railway into the 
Borth. Discussion, both in public and in the ensuing session contin¬ 
ued hotly. The Conservative Edmonton Jo urna l alleged that the 
interest payments for the years 1910, 1911 and 1912 had come to 

a total of $1,110*000 and that the decision left the people in 

2 

an unpleasant financial position. 

The 1913 election was conducted without any specific pledge 
as to government railway policy. With the opening of the new Legis¬ 
lature in September, Mr. Sift on proposed his solution. He had 
recently consulted with Mr. McArthur, the original contractor, and 
under the new plan the A. & G. W. project was to proceed, managed 
by McArthur and associates, on terms satisfactory to the banks and 
bondholders. A new ^ct was passed, repealing the 1910 Act, but 
continuing the government bond guarantee. The Bill passed its third 
reading on October 11, and shortly thereafter the $7,400,00 was 
transferred to the credit of J. D. McArthur and Company, who 
immediately commenced construction.

APPENDIX 3 


Pr ohibi t ion 

Temperance matters were much discussed in 1914. On one hand the 
government received a deputation of Mayors, who protested the results 
of legislation which had deprived the municipalities of the right to 
collect liquor licenses, and demanded the right to impose additional fees 
and to collect a moiety of all penalties imposed. On the other hand 
the liquor traffic was much denounced by such organizations as the 
Alberta Temperance and Moral Reform League, the Temperance Reform League 
the Grand Lodge of the Independent Order of Good Templars and the U.F.A. 

On October 12, the government was presented with a politically 

unpleasant fact; a petition signed by 23,000 qualified electors, T/o 

over the requirements of the Direct Legislation Act. The delegation, 

1 

which numbered 150, made vigorous speeches demanding action. On 
October 19, the Legislature, without discussion, passed a Prohibitory 
Liquor Act as recommended by the temperance interests, subject to 
approval in a referendum on July 21, 1915--a majority vote to decide 
the issue and if favourable the Act was to come into operation on 
July' 1, 1916. The Act was based on the Manitoba measure of 1900 
and it provided for the prohibition of the sale of intoxicating 
liquors within the province for beverage purposes, thereby cutting 
off bars and licensed clubs, liquor shops, railway dining cars, etc. 

The residue of the traffic—i.e. the demands for intoxicating liq¬ 
uors for mechanical, scientific, medicinal and sacramental purposes— 
was to be in the hands of the government and it was to be the duty 
of the government to appoint salaried vendors, thus removing the 
element of private profit from the trade. Vendors were to be per¬ 
mitted to sell only for the above purposes and then only on the affi¬ 
davit of the purchaser or on the prescription of a physician. The

possession limit per resident was set at one quart of spirits and 
two gallons of malt liquors. 

The Alberta Temperance and Moral Reform League took organization 
in hand and early in 1915 began a vigourous campaign, On July 21 
the act was approved and prohibition carried by a large majority. 

The total vote was 97,453 - with 58,295 for, and 37,509 against;only 

1 

14 out of 55 districts had majorities against. 

The principal measure dealt with in the 1916 Session of the 

2 

Legislature was the Prohibition Act. Although it had been urged that 
the Act, as drafted by the Temperance and Moral Reform League, 
contained serious defects and was unworkable, the Prohibitionist 
forces held a meeting in Red Deer and decided against any changes. 

The Legislature therefore, was practically stripped of its power in 
this respect. The original bill had passed with little study or 
debate and the people had voted according to their inclinations with 
little interference except from those who wanted the act put through. 
The important provisions wese those declaring: 

1. All liquor of over 2\% alcohol content to be considered intox* 
ieating. 

2. It was to be an offense against the Act for any person to have 
in a dwelling house over one quart of spirits and two gallons 
of malt liquor. 

3. Unlawful for persons residing in apartments, boarding houses 
or anywhere other than their own private dwelling to have 
liquor on the premises. 

4. Vendors to be appointed by the government to sell liquor to

those allowed to obtain it on affidavit. Vendors to be salaried 
officials and not to sell to persons other than doctors, druggists, 
veterinary surgeons, etc. 

5. .Liquor manufactured and stored within the province could be shipped 
out of the province, and from points outside to points inside. 

This Sale of Intoxicating Liquors Act was passed without comment 
or amendment except for one grammatical correction and the removal of 
the quantity restriction on the amount of sacramental liquor allov>/ed 
clergymen. On July 1, the Act commenced operation and 70 retail 
houses, 55 wholesale firms and 12 clubs lost their right to sell liquor. 
Results were varied. On:the one hand, during the first months public 
drunkenness was much lessened and merchants’ collections were reportedly 
better; on the other hand liquor imports greatly increased and much 
money left the province, liquor went into the homes and enforcement 
difficulties were foreseen. 

It was not long before the forebodings became facts. In 1918 

legislation was passed empowering the police to arrest, without a 

warrant, any person violating the liquor Act. The influenza epidemic 

heightened the already difficult problem of enforcing Prohibition. 

Illicit sales in 1919 were estimated at $3,500,000; legal sales for the 

3 

same year were an estimated $2,150,000. In January, 1919 the Edmonton 
drug stores sold 214,999 ounces of liquor, and the Calgary stores sold 
119,255 ounces. 

By 1920 it was evident to all that the Liquor Act was a mixed 

blessing. The Alberta Social Service League declared that a great 

change had taken place; drunkenness had decreased, children were better 

4 

fed and clothed, crime had lessened, poverty and bad debts had become 
almost unknown, and savings accounts had increased. Speaking before the

Legislature in March, 1920, the Attorney General said that consumption 
had dropped and sobriety had increased* He also showed a less desirable 
side in the form of numerous bootleggers and illegal distillers who 
were almost impossible to suppress. In August a referendum was held 
on whether liquor imports should be prohibited. The Prohibitionists 
won with a Yl% majority, but since less than half of those entitled to 
vote had done so, Mr. Boyle resignedly pointed out that the result did 
not promise "effective enforcement of a coercive law." 

The prohibition of liquor imports did not have the desired effedto 
In 1921 Premier Stewart admitted that enforcement was most difficult 
and that neither Prohibition organizations nor the Moderation League 
were satisfied. As an indication of the seriousness of the situation, 

Mr. Boyle, the Attorney General, presented to the Legislature a survey 
of the Provincial situation in regard to transactions for 1920. Convict¬ 
ions under the law came to 3,480, the second highest of the provinces. 

It was estimated that the profits made by the 250 druggists amounted to 
$69.6,074; the 5 04 doctors in the province had issued approximately 
531,168 prescript ions for liquor at about two dollars each, for a 
profit of $1,063,336. Added to these totals Mr. Boyle estimated a profit 
made by 1,779 bootleggers of $1,779,000 and a profit of $1,140,000 to 
the estimated illegal still operators. In comparison to these startling- 
examples of enterprise was the total net profit to the government of 
$1,596,204 with an offset in expenditure of $1,405,510 for the adminis¬ 
tration of justice, which was chiefly an attempt to enforce the Liquor 
3 

Act. These figures were presented in an attempt to show the difficulty 
in enforcing without an espionage system, an act which did not receive

the support of the public• Among the convictions obtained ih 1920 
were two chiefs of police, who were retained in office by their 
town councils after their convidtions; the Mayor of a town was 
also convicted on a charge of bootlegging. Amendments to the Act 
were passed tightening up the law all along the line; in particular 
penalties were increased and drugstores were to be more closely 
restricted by prohibiting the stores themselves from handling liquor 

4 

sales for six months after an offence, or one year for second offenders. 

With the change of government there was no accompanying solution 
to the problem of enforcing the liquor laws. More amendments 
were made in 1922, but pressure was growing stronger for an entirely 
new approach to the problem. R. C. Edwards, the famed publisher 
of the Calgary Eye Opener and Conservative member for Calgary, declared 
that, “Che half of the population of Alberta is trying to get liquoy, 
and the other half is trying to keep them from it. It is like a 

game—if you get it you win and if you don f t, you lose. You can't 

4 a 

expect to enforce any act with half the population against it.“ 

During 1922 and 1923 a ballot was prepared to be submitted to 
the voters, giving four options, ranging from continuation of the 
existing legislation to government control and sale of all liquors. 

The vote was taken on Movember 5, 19J23, and resulted in 61,780 votes 

4. The former law only provided for infractions by the individual 
and after a few fines, druggists had conceived the idea of hiring 
a clerk, often an oax-bartender, to handle the liquor trade.

On May 10, 1924, the new Alberta liquor Act went into effect, 
with 20 vendors of beer and 2 liquor stores in Calgary and Edmonton. 
The administration of the liquor Act was to be under a Commission, 
with a manager in charge of the liquor trading business and one 
in charge of licenses, private vendors and clubs. This marked the 
entry of the Alberta Government into the liquor trade on a large 
scale for the first time. The results of Prohibition were proven 
to be undesirable and the system, brought in as a replacement has 
remained, with few changes, to the present day.
