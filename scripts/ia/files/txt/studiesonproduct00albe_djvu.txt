STUDIES ON THE PRODUCTION OE 2,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL 
EROM WHEAT BY AEROBACILLUS POLYMYXA 


Albert William Jackson 


INTRODUCTION 


Owing to the loss during the present war of the 
main producing areas of natural rubber the United Nations 
were forced to seek other sources of supply. Two general 
methods for overcoming the shortage were suggested. These 
were the production of synthetic rubber and the utiliza¬ 
tion of the latex of certain quick-growing plants. 

The main processes for the production of syn¬ 
thetic rubber require butadiene as a basic substance. 
Butadiene can be produced from a variety of compounds - e.g 
2,3-butylene glycol, ethyl alcohol and some of the constit¬ 
uents of natural gas. It is also obtained as a by-product 
in the cracking and refining of petroleum (9). 

The study of the production of 2,3-butylene 
glycol was undertaken mainly because of its possible 
conversion to butadiene. In addition the "laevo" form 
of 2,3-butylene glycol in water solutions has been shown 
to have definite possibilities as an anti-freeze (10). 

Certain species of bacteria produce 2,3-butylene

glycol (referred to hereafter as glycol) as a fermentation 
product. Among these species are Aerobacillus polymyxa 
(Prazmowski) Donker producing the "laevo" form, and 
Aerobacter aerogenes producing a mixture of "dextro" and 
"meso” forms in relatively large amounts by the fermenta¬ 
tion of carbohydrates. The former is able to ferment 
starch. Since cereals contain large amounts of starch 
the Aerobacillus fermentation has been suggested as a 
means of producing glycol and of reducing the wheat surplus. 

The Aerobacter fermentation on the other hand 
requires a simple carbohydrate in addition to continued 
aeration during fermentation. It is also particularly 
sensitive to contamination by other organisms. These are 
handicaps to the adaptation of this fermentation to the 
commercial production of glycol. 

Organisms of the Aerobacillus type, in addition 
to possessing starch hydrolyzing enzymes, do not require 
aeration during fermentation. Because of this there is 
less opportunity for contamination in the Aerobacillus 
than in the Aerobacter fermentation. 

Early in 1942 the Department of Field Crops of 
the University of Alberta, co-operating with the National 
Research Council Laboratory, Ottawa, began a war emergency 
research project designed to study the possibility of 
utilizing wheat in the production of glycol using 
Aerobacillus polymyxa .

PREVIOUS WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA 


Not all phases of our work on the Aerobacillus 
fermentation are included in the present report. The early 
work conducted in this laboratory dealt with the following: 

1. The isolation of active starch-hydrolyzing and 
glycol-producing strains of A. polymyxa from 
different sources and the improvement of these 
strains by re-selection from the original isolates 

3. The determination of the suitability of various 
wheat fractions as nutritional supplements for 
A. polymyxa in starch fermentations; 

3. The perfection of methods for the comparative fer¬ 
mentation of a large number of grain samples and 
the determination of the relative values of dif¬ 
ferent grades, varieties, etc., of wheat for 
glycol production. 

A major part of our previous work was devoted to 
the third sub-project. 

Results of work referred to in sections 1 and 3 
above are to be found in progress reports submitted to the 
National Research Council by this laboratory (7). A des¬ 
cription of the equipment and the methods devised to 
carry out the fermentations referred to in Section III may

and the glycol and ethanol yields obtained from the various 
grain samples in the latter (17), Section I. 

OBJECTS OE THE PRESENT INVESTIGATIONS 


The objects of the present investigations were 
as follows: 

1. (a) To continue the work of endeavoring to obtain 

strains of A, polymyxa having superior glycol- 
yielding ability to those now available by the 
improvement of existing strains and by further 
isolation from local source material; 

(b) To study the cultural characteristics of the 
higher-yielding strains, and to determine if they 
belong to a single group or if they have any 
property or properties in common by means of which 
they may be quickly identified; 

2* To study the nutrition of A. polymyxa , especially 
its nitrogen and growth factor requirements with 
the aim of using the Aerobacillus fermentation to 


produce glycol from more or less pure wheat starch

PASTEURIZATION IN THE ISOLATION AND 
IMPROVEMENT OF A, POLYMYXA 


Effect of Pasteurization upon the Glycol-yielding 
Ability of A, polymyxa Strains 

Introduction 

The spore-forming bacteria( Clostridium aceto - 
butylicum), used in the commercial production of acetone 
and butanol, were observed by Weyer and Rettger (21) to 
become sluggish in action and to produce reduced yields 
of solvents after being transferred on the usual culture 
medium for some time. It was found (21) that pasteurizing 
such cultures increased their activity. This treatment 
removed the non-spore-bearing forms which are poor solvent- 
producers. The strains producing the highest yields of 
solvents were the most heat-resistant spore-bearing isolates. 

Similarly in the present work reduction in the 
glycol yields obtained from various strains of A. polymyxa 
had been noted after continued transfer on a peptone-wheat- 
agar medium. It was decided to attempt the activation of 
these organisms by pasteurization, using the following methods. 

Methods 


Spore-containing culture was transferred from agar

slants to sterile 0*9 percent NaCl solution in small diameter 
(14 mm.) Pyrex test-tubes. These were heated in a water hath 
at temperatures of 65°, 75° or 85° C for 10 minutes and then 
cooled. A non-pasteurized control was held at room tempera¬ 
ture. 

The effect of heat upon the material prepared in 
the manner described above was studied by two methods: 

(a) The spore-suspension was used to inoculate duplicate 
150 c.c. lots of 8 percent wheat mash which were 
then fermented and the resulting mixtures analyzed 
for glycol and reducing sugar; 

(b) One loopful of the spore-suspension was added to 

10 c.c. of neutral red agar containing starch. This 
was then poured into Petri plates. Aerobacilli 
usually absorb the red dye (15). It was observed 
that the addition of starch to this medium gave it 
a further advantage in that active starch hydrolyzers 
could be selected from among the Aerobacilli which 
dad not absorb the dye. 

After incubation for 48 hours to 72 hours at 30° C, 
colonies judged to be Aerobacillus colonies were picked from 
the plates and transferred to test-tube lots of sterile 6 
percent wheat mash. These were placed in an oven held at 
50° C. At the end of 48 hours* incubation the contents of 
actively fermenting tubes were used to inoculate 8 percent 
wheat mashes which were treated as in method (a).

The wheat mashes were prepared by cooking 1 to 
1*5 litre batches of mash in a hot water bath at the tempera¬ 
ture of boiling water and cooking was continued for 50 minutes 
with constant stirring. At this time CaCOg at the rate of 
0*5 gm. per 100 c.c. water in the mash was added and uniformly 
dispersed by further stirring. The cooked mash was dispensed 
in 150 c.c. lots into 250 c.c. flasks which were then bunged 
and autoclaved at 15 lb. steam pressure for 30 minutes. 

After cooling the mash, the inoculum prepared in 
(a) and (b) was added and dispersed by shaking the flasks. 

The inoculated flasks were placed in a cabinet held at 35° C 
for 8 to 12 hours, then removed to a cabinet held at 30° C 
for the remainder of the fermentation period. Analyses of 
the spent mashes were made after 72 hours* fermentation. 

Results 

Strain U.A.500 

Results obtained in two tests on 8 percent wheat 
mash using method (a) and organism U.A.500 are given in 
Table I. 

Cultures from the spores resistant to 85° C produced 
higher yields of glycol than those from spores subjected 
to pasteurization at 65° C or those from unpasteurized 
controls. The tests show that consistent increases in 
glycol yield can be obtained by this procedure. 

There is little or no trend in the ethanol yields

trations showed no consistent trends, although there 
was some tendency for organisms to respond to pasteur¬ 
ization at either 65° or 85° C. 

The Application of Pasteurization to the 
Isolation of A. polymyxa Strains 


Introduction 

The results just reported indicate that pasteur¬ 
ization of a culture increases the glycol yield obtained 
from the subsequent fermentation of 8 percent wheat mashes. 

Stanier and co-workers (15) included pasteuriza¬ 
tion of source material in their method of isolating high 
glycol-yielding strains of A. polymyxa . They concluded 
that pasteurization was an essential part of the procedure 
on the basis of the high percentage of ac tive isolates 
which they were able to obtain by its inclusion. However 
no direet comparisons were made of the number or yielding 
ability of isolates obtained from pasteurized and non- 
pasteurized source material, nor was the effect of various 
temperatures of pasteurization reported. 

On the strength of the trends recorded in the 
previous section and the observations of Stanier et al ( 15 ) 
it was decided to study the value of pasteurization in

isolating high-glycol-yielding strains of A. polymyxa from 
soil and other sources. 

Method 

With the following modifications the method used 
was that described as method (b) in the previous section. 

Material for pasteurization was prepared by adding 
1 c.c. of a 1 to 100 dilution of source material in water to 
5 c.c. of sterile water in test-tubes. 

Pasteurization of these tubes was carried out at 
the following temperatures: 65°, 80° and 96° C. A 
non-heated control was included in the test. 

The 8 percent wheat mashes were replaced by 15 
percent mashes which were prepared by a method somewhat 
similar to that described for the preparation of the less 
concentrated ones. However, in addition to the increase in 
concentration, the following changes were made in the prep¬ 
aration of the mashes. Owing to the almost solid nature 
of the cooked, non-liquefied 15 percent wheat mashes, pre- 
liquefaction was found necessary. Malt extract was used 
to liquefy the starch. Special equipment which was designed 
and constructed for the preparation of uniform mashes for 
routine fermentations was used in these studies. A full 
description of the methods and equipment used in the prep¬ 
aration of 15 percent wheat mashes is to be found elsewhere. (1?) 

Cultures were preserved by making loop transfers

In two tests out of three, pasteurizing at 65° C 
for 10 minutes was most satisfactory from the viewpoint 
of the highest glycol-yielding strain selected. In the 
third test pasteurizing at 96° C for 20 minutes was most 
satisfactory from this viewpoint. 

The percentage of active glycol producers among 
those selected from the dilution plates is generally 
higher in the pasteurized series than in the controls. 
However this trend varied considerably in different tests. 

Comparative Glycol Yields Obtained from 
Various A. polymyxa Strains 


Introduction 

Part of the work undertaken was that of isolating 
further high-glycol-yielding strains of A. polymyxa . The 
glycol yields of sane of those obtained are given in 
Table IV. Two National Research Council isolates are in¬ 
cluded for comparative purposes. One (C42(2)) is a phage- 
resistant culture, and the other (C47(2)) is one of the 
better glycol-yielding strains in the N.R.C. collection 
made available for this work. 

Method 


Comparative yields were obtained from the fermen-

tation of 15 percent wheat mashes prepared by the method 
described in the previous section. 

Inoculum was prepared as follows: A loopful of 
bacteria from a slant culture was transferred to 10 c.c. 
of sterile water in a test tube. Following dispersion of 
the cells in the water by shaking the tube, the contents were 
transferred to 100 c.c. of 15 percent wheat mash. After 
incubation at 55° C for 24 hours, 5 c.c. of the actively 
fermenting mixture were used to inoculate 150 c.c. of the 
15 percent wheat mash. 

Results 

The comparative glycol yields from fermentation 
of 15 percent wheat mashes by some of the better isolates 
obtained in this work and two of the N.R.C. isolates are 
given in Table IV. 

Glycol yields obtained from the U.A. strains 
listed show that by the use of the pasteurization method 
described earlier it is possible to isolate comparatively 
high-glycol-yielding A. polymyxa strains from soil and 
rotting wood. 

The yield of the isolates obtained in this work 
compares favorably with that of the best glycol-yielding 
strains among the N.R.C. isolates.

Discussion 

The value of pasteurization in improving the 
glycol-yielding ability of isolates and as apart of the 
procedure for isolating high-glycol-yielding strains from 
source material has been studied* 

The results of experiments dealing with pasteur¬ 
ization of sources of bacteria show that no one temperature 
is consistently more effective than another in the isola¬ 
tion of high-yielding strains. The effect of pasteurization 
upon the strains U.A.350 and U.A.500 may help to explain 
this lack of consistency. Larger yields of glycol were 
obtained in the subsequent fermentation where cultures of 
U.A.350 were heated to 65° C rather than to 85° C, or where 
no heat treatment was applied. In similar tests strain 
U.A.500 produced highest yields of glycol after pasteuriza¬ 
tion at 85° C. The isolation of higher-glycol-yielding 
strains from material pasteurized for 10 minutes at 65° C 
rather than at 96° C in the first two tests may indicate 
that strains resembling U.A.350 were predominant in the 
source. On the other hand the superiority of material heated 
to 96° C for 20 minutes, as observed in the third test, may 
be due to the presence of strains resembling U.A.500.

MORPHOLOGICAL, BIOCHEMICAL AND CULTURAL 
CHARACTERISTICS OF A, POLMA 


Introduction 

After drawing attention to the confusion which 
existed concerning the identity and differentiation of the 
species in the genus Aerobacillus , Porter, McCleskey and 
Levine (12) made a study of the morphology, biochemistry 
and cultural characteristics of over eighty strains of 
this organism. 

They concluded that the facultative, spore-bearing 
bacteria which ferment carbohydrates with the production 
of acid and gas and possess the following characteristics 
may be classified as Aerobacillus polymyxa : 

Rod-shaped, spore-bearing cells, Gram negative 
in young cultures; 

No spores produced on glucose agar; 

Produce moderate, spreading, transparent growth 
or raised slimy colonies on glucose agar; 

Colonies may be round or amoeboid, convex or 

flat; 

May or may not liquefy gelatin; 

Many reduce cooked potato to a soft pulp in 
48 hours at 57° C; 

Grow well at 20° but slowly, if at all, at 42° C;

Produce acetylmethylcarbinol; 

Reduce nitrates to nitrites; 

Produce neither acid nor gas from rhamnose or 
sorbitol. 

Stanier et al (15) studied the morphology and 
the biochemical and cultural characteristics of a number 
of A. polymyxa strains which produce relatively high yields 
of glycol in wheat fermentations. Their description agrees 
generally with that of Porter et al (12) with the following 
exceptions: 

Rhamnose was fermented by about half of their 
isolates,and strains which had been carried in pure culture 
for seme time showed a tendency to be non-spore-forming. 

They noted that colonies of various strains of 
A. polymyxa differed with respect to form* consistency, 
surface and elevation. Furthermore good differentiation 
with respect to colony form and dye adsorption was obtained 
on neutral-red agar. 

Upon analyzing the various types observable on 
neutral-red agar it was found that they fell into five 
main groups. The "Classification of Aerobacillus Variants” 
as proposed by Stanier et al (15) is as follows: 

I Colonies fiat, usually small and inconspic¬ 
uous with matt surface. On neutral red agar 
colored very pale pink. Consistency butyrous, 
easily emulsified. 

II Small heterogeneous group, colonies large or 
small mucoid, smooth or rough all character-

ized by the fact that they do not absorb 
color from neutral red agar, 

III Colonies very opaque, milky, raised and 
entire, usually of soft consistency but not 
easily emulsified. Light pink color on 
neutral red agar. Two sub-groups. 

Ill A Smooth 

III B Rough 

IV Colonies smooth and glistening, some convex, 
others raised and flat on top, and yet others 
have a raised edge and flat sunken centre. 

All absorb dye from neutral red agar with 
great intensity and become dark red. Four 
sub-groups. 

IV A Smooth with raised edges and sunken centre. 

IV B Convex and very smooth with a tendency to 
be mucoid. 

IV C Slightly raised with flat surface, smooth 
but never mucoid. 

IV D Miscellaneous unclassified forms of IV. 

V Colonies convex, rough and glistening with dark 
red color on neutral red agar. Two sub-groups. 

V A Colonies secreting a tough, tenacious slime. 

V B Colonies secreting a soft slime. 

In the present studies several characteristics 
exhibited by a number of A. polymyxa isolates obtained her© 
and elsewhere were observed and recorded with the idea in 
mind that high-glycol-yielding strains may have some distin¬ 
guishing characteristic in common which might be used in 
their identification and isolation.

Petri plates containing moist filter paper and after surface 
inoculation with bacteria were incubated at 30° C for 72 
hour s♦ 

The following strains of A. polymyxa were compared 
with respect to all characters studied: U.A.634, U.A.641, 
U.A.643, U.A.650, U.A.651 and U.A.652. Strains C42(2), 

C47(2} and C56(2) were similarly compared except with respect 
to colony characters. Those which were compared with respect 
to colony characters include all the U.A. strains obtained 
during the course of the pasteurization studies reported in 
a previous section. These include the U.A. strains mentioned 
above. 

Results 

Morphology 

Cultures of all strains studied contained rod¬ 
shaped cells of varying length. 

Some spores were formed on the wheat-peptone-agar 
slants but not on potato-dextrose-agar. Spores were 
located terminally. 

Young cultures (18-24 hr.) growing on W.P.A. were 
Gram negative.

Potato rotting 

All strains tested rotted uncooked potato slices 
reducing them to a pulp in less than 72 hours at 
50° 0. There was considerable variation in the color 
of the resulting pulp (see Figure 5), but as far as 
this has been studied these variations did not appear 
consistent enough to be depended upon in differentiat¬ 
ing between high- and low-yielding isolates. 

Acetylmethylcarbinol formation 

All strains tested produced acetylmethylcarbinol 
when grown in wheat mashes as well as in the regular 
peptone-glucose medium. This substance was detected 
by the method of O’Meara (11).

all strains reduced the nitrate to nitrite. 

Temperature relations 

None of the strains tested grew on W.P.A. medium 
at 45° to 45° C in 48 hours. However, after incubation 
for 96 hours good growth of strains U.A.651 and U.A.653, 
slight growth of seme others and no growth of 047(2) 
was observed. Again no differentiation between the 
high- and low-glycol-producing members of the group 
could be detected. 

Discussion 

A study of some morphological, biochemical and 
cultural characteristics of a number of strains of 
A. polymyxa yielded information which may be of use in 
further work. 

The depression of spore-formation by glucose which 
is reported in this paper and was also observed by Porter(12) 
and co-workers is of importance in pasteurization studies. 

Some evidence is presented to indicate that high- 
glycol-yielding strains of A. polymyxa may be isolated from 
neutral red agar plates by selecting from the colonies which 
have the characteristics of group XIXB. However, further 
study will be necessary before this method can be applied 
with certainty.

GROWTH FACTOR REQUIREMENTS OF 
A. PQLYMYXA 


The growth factor requirements of a number of 
strains of A, polymyxa have been determined by Katznelson (8) 
who showed that biotin was the only growth factor essential 
for all strains studied* Thiamin added in addition to biotin, 
produced irregular increases in the growth of these strains, 
which were divided into three groups on the basis of their 
reaction to this factor. Some were stimulated, others in¬ 
hibited by thiamin. One strain was indifferent to this 
substance. Panthothenic and nicotinic acid, inositol, 
riboflavin and pyridoxine were not essential and produced 
no regular effects upon growth. 

Since nothing was known concerning the growth fac¬ 
tor requirements of several of the isolates included in the 
present study it was thought important to obtain this infor¬ 
mation. This was considered ©specially necessary in view 
of the fact that it was proposed to investigate pure starch 
as a substrate for glycol production. 

Five strains were selected from among the isolates 
being used in the fermentation studies. These strains 
differed in several important characteristics such as phage 
resistance, glycol-yielding ability and CaCO s requirement. 
Strain C42(2) was included for its phage resistance, C47(2), 
U.A.634, U.A.641 for high-glycol-yielding ability and C56(2)

for low CaC05 requirement* 


Method 


The method used was essentially that employed by 
Katznelson (8)* This consisted in growing the organisms 
in a chemically defined substrate containing the necessary 
organic and inorganic substances. 

All glassware coming into contact with the medium 
was carefully cleaned with a dichromate cleaning solution 
and distilled water was used throughout the experiments. 

The basal medium used was that developed by 
Katznelson (8). The constituents are as follows: 

4‘ ’ 

KgHP0 4 1.0 grams CaClg 0.1 grams 


KH 2 P0 4 1.0 " KeS0 4 .7H 2 0 0.01 w 

MgS0 4 • 7H2Q 0.2 « MnS0 4 .4K 2 0 0.01 tt 

NaCl 0.1 " ZnS0 4 0.1 " 

Distilled water - 1000 ml. 

Heat to boiling and filter 

Glucose - 5 grams 

pH adjusted to 6.8 with 1.0 N NaOH 

Double strength medium was prepared and to it 
was added glutamic acid to give a concentration of 0.05 grn. 
per litre in the final medium. Growth factors were added 
as described in detail later. Distilled water was then 
used to bring the solution to the desired strength. The 
medium was dispensed in 10 c.c. lots into clean tubes which

were then bunged and autoclaved at 15 lb* steam pressure 
for 20 minutes. 

Inoculum was prepared by suspending the bacteria 
in 10 c.c. of sterile 0.9 percent NaCl solution in a test 
tube. One £ mm. loopful of bacteria, obtained from a 24- 
hour-old agar-slant culture, was suspended in the saline 
solution by shaking. One similar-sized loopful of the 
suspension was used to inoculate each tube of medium. 

After 72 hours’ incubation at 55° C, growth was 
recorded by a method similar to that employed by West and 
Lochhead (20) and by Katznelson (8). This consisted of 
rating the growth by observation of the clouding that 
occurred in the medium, using a scale of cloudiness ranging 
from 0 to 5. 

When the effect of growth factors other than 
biotin was being studied (8) biotin was added at a uniform 
concentration of 0.5 micrograms per litre of medium. This 
concentration was used in all the work reported here. The 
other growth factors were added in amounts found satisfactory 
by Katznelson (8). These factors were added as follows: 
Thiamin 200 micrograms per litre 

Pantothenic acid 200 ” M ” 

Nicotinic acid 200 " ” " 

Inositol 50 milligrams " " 

Biotin was supplied as a concentrate containing 
20 micrograms per c.c., thiamin as the chloride, and

Results 


A summary of the average results obtained in two 
experiments conducted in triplicate is given in Table VI. 

Biotin was found essential for growth of all 
strains used. 

The presence of thiamin in addition to biotin 
increased the growth of four out of five strains over that 
obtained with biotin alone. 

Each of the following, namely pantothenic acid, 
nicotinic acid and inositol, when used with biotin, had an 
effect similar to but less marked than that produced by a 
combination of thiamin and biotin. 

The addition of pantothenic acid, nicotinic acid 
and inositol singly to a medium containing biotin and thiamin 
produced uniformly heavy growth of bacteria, generally in 
excess of that obtained in the presence of biotin and any 
other single growth factor. 

No single growth factor, nor any pair of growth 
factors tested produced growth in the absence of biotin.

THE NITROGEN REQUIREMENTS OF A, POLYMYXA 


Introduction 


The use of whole wheat as a source of fermentable 
carbohydrate for the Aerobacillus fermentation did not appear 
to be entirely satisfactory from either a technical or an 
economic viewpoint. Technically the chief difficulty 
centered about the removal of the non-fermentable soluble 
and insoluble materials from the beer and the drying of 
this residue, Furthermore the degradation of the unused 
portion of the wheat protein to a by-product of question¬ 
able food value for livestock appeared to be a distinct 
economic disadvantage. 

It was under these conditions that early in our 
studies of A, polymyxa we were assigned the task of devel¬ 
oping a fermentation process for the production of 
2,5-butylene glycol from pure wheat starch. 

The replacement of gluten with a soluble 
nitrogenous substance in the fermentation mash would 
obviously overcome the main technical difficulties. The 
practicability of such a procedure depends to a large 
extent upon the outcome of studies on the nutrition of 
the organism, with special emphasis on the nitrogen 
requirement. The availability and cost of the alternate

nitrogen source must also be considered. 

There is little published information on the 
nitrogen requirements of A. polymyxa . Tilden and 
Hudson (16) found a starch peptone medium more suitable 
for the growth of A. polymyxa and production of amylase 
than a mineral starch medium. Katznelson (8) demonstrated 
that peptone, tryptone and yeast extract were suitable 
sources of nitrogen for A. polymyxa (Peoria strain No. 510*). 
However, without growth factors ammonium sulfate, urea and 
potassium nitrate were not utilized, nor was a vitamin-free 
casein hydrolysate a suitable source of nitrogen, when added 
to a pure salt and glucose medium. In previous work it 
was found that wheat germ is a suitable source of nitrogen 
when added to a starch medium (7); that small quantities 
of urea added to a wheat germ supplemented starch medium 
increase the glycol yield; and that other protein-containing 
fractions of the wheat kernel used as nutritional amendments 
to pure starch, e.g. bran, shorts, feed and white flours, 
also increase the yield of glycol (15). Bran and shorts 
used singly (15) were inferior to wheat germ as a supple¬ 
ment to starch medium, whereas white feed flours were 
s cine what better than bran and shorts but not superior to 
wheat germ at the concentrations used. Stanier et al (14) 
report slow fermentation of white flour by A. polymyxa but 
sane increase in rate of fermentation and yield of glycol 
was obtained when this medium was supplemented with yeast

extract. It would appear that the A. polymyxa strains so 
far studied require a proteinaceous nitrogen source to 
support the fermentation of starch. In order to determine 
the nitrogen requirements of a number of A. polymyxa 
strains and other glycol-producing isolates the following 
tests were carried out. 

Nitrogen requirements of A. polymyxa for 
the fermentation of starch 


Introduction 

Although wheat germ has been shown (15) to be a 
suitable nutritional amendment to starch for fermentation 
by A. polymyxa , at the concentration required to produce 
maximum yields of glycol this material could not be used 
economically on a commercial scale. 

In order to obtain some general knowledge of 
the nitrogen requirements of A. polymyxa it was decided 
to determine the ability of a number of isolates to 
utilize urea and ammonium sulfate, as well as wheat gluten 
and starch wash-liquor. The effect of growth factors in 
combination with the various nitrogen sources was also 
studied.

Materials and methods 

Description of wheat-flour fractions used as supple¬ 

ments to starch 

Liquid gluten 

It was found in the course of these studies that 
wheat gluten freed of starch hy washing, and stored 
at low temperatures (10° C) to prevent destructive 
bacterial growth became quite liquid after a period 
of two to three weeks* This liquid gluten could be 
dispensed by the use of a pipette or graduated 
cylinder, and by shaking in water a suspension of 
the material was easily prepared. Gluten prepared 
in this way did not contain a detectable amount of 
reducing sugar when tested with Benedict’s solution* 
Nitrogen analysis by the Kjeldahi method showed a 
concentration of 35 to 45 mg. per c.c. for different 
batches. Gluten prepared from freshly milled flour 
and from new wheat liquefied more readily than that 
prepared from old flour. Excessive washing lengthened 
the time necessary for liquefaction to take place. 

Starch wash-liquor 

Starch wash-liquor used in these studies was 
obtained in the process of washing starch from wheat

gluten, as carried out in the laboratory. Flour was 
mixed with sufficient water to produce a thick dough. 
After allowing this to stand for one and one-half to 
two minutes, the starch was washed by hand from the 
gluten with distilled water. The starch was obtained 
in a water-suspension from which after a period of 
a few hours the former separated by sedimentation. 

The starch-free liquid remaining after sedimentation 
was removed by decantation and stored at low tempera¬ 
tures for future use. This liquid will be referred to 
as starch wash-liquor. 

Where three litres of water were used in washing 
the starch from 1000 gm. of flour the nitrogen concen¬ 
tration in the starch wash-liquor was found to be on 
the average 0.7 mg. per c.c. of liquid (nitrogen 
determined by the Kjeldahl method). 

This liquid has been observed to possess quite 
marked starch liquefying power when added to gelatin¬ 
ized starch at 60° to 70° C. Furthermore, the liquefied 
starch appears to be less satisfactory for the 
Aerobacillus fermentation than the non-liquefied, 
cooked starch. Hence precautions must be taken to 
prevent this action of the starch wash-liquor. 
Liquefaction is prevented by adding the wash-liquor 
after preliminary cooking of the starch-water suspen¬ 
sion at 80® C and by maintaining the medium at this

temperature for 10 to 15 minutes after addition of 
the wash-liquor. 

The studies to be reported were carried out on a 
6 percent starch medium. Starch at this concentration 
produces a medium which, after cooking, can be dispensed 
into flasks or test-tubes with comparative ease. Higher 
concentrations were found to be too thick for ease of 
handling and hence could not have been used without some 
such treatment as liquefaction by the use of malt or malt 
extract, which probably would have interfered with the 
interpretation of the results. Where liquid gluten or starch- 
wash-liquor was used sufficient distilled water was added 
to bring the concentration of starch in the medium to 6 
percent. All media contained 0.25 percent CaCOg and 6 per¬ 
cent starch. This will be referred to as "basal" medium. 

Media not containing wash-liquor were prepared by 
cooking the complete medium (basal + nitrogen source) for 
20 minutes at 80° C in a steam bath. Where wash-liquor was 
used, the precautions referred to in the preceding section 
were observed. The cooked medium was dispensed into test-tubes 
in 12 to 15 c.c. lots. The tubes were bunged and autoclaved 
at 15 lb. steam pressure for 20 minutes. Inoculum was pre¬ 
pared by suspending a 5 mm. loopful of bacteria obtained 
from a 24 to 56 hour old slant in 10 c.e. of sterile 0.9 
percent NaCl solution. One similar-sized loopful of the 
suspension was added to each tube of medium and the inocu-

lated tubes were incubated for the first 24 hours at 35°C, 
then transferred to a cabinet held at 30° C for the remain¬ 
der of the fermentation time. At the end of 72 and 96 hours 
of fermentation the extent of starch hydrolysis was determined 
by the use of Lugol f s iodine, as an indicator for the presence 
of starch. 

It was considered that the qualitative suitability 
of a starch medium could be determined by the complete 
hydrolysis of the starch when inoculated with A. polymyxa 
strains. This procedure was decided upon as suitable for 
preliminary studies with relatively large numbers of 
organisms, keeping in mind that a medium in which complete 
hydrolysis of the starch was obtained would be worthy of 
further study, but one in which this was not obtained would 
be unsuitable for the fermentation from an industrial viewpoint. 

Results 


The reaction of a number of organisms to various 
nitrogen-containing compounds is given in Table VII. The 
results are averages of three similar experiments. 

Complete hydrolysis of the starch was obtained in 
the presence of liquid gluten by all the strains of A. polymyxa 
tested.

urea were not satisfactory nitrogen sources. 

The control tubes containing starch wash-liquor 
were not fermented by A. polymyxa . 

Addition of biotin, thiamin and nicotinic acid 
had no effect on the rate of fermentation of starch in 
these tests, nor was yeast extract beneficial in this 
respect. 


The Amino Acid Requirements of A. polymyxa 


Introduction 

The amino acid requirement of many species of 
bacteria has been determined. Studies of this kind have 
dealt with a variety of bacteria including soil-borne 
species as well as several species used in commercial fer¬ 
mentations. 

It has been shown by Weizmann (19) that 
Clostridium acetobutylicum requires asparagine as a nitrogen 
source and will not grow without biotin in the medium. 
Andersen and co-workers (1) demonstrated that three species 
of Lactobacillus »namely L. mannitopeous , L. buckneri and 
L. lycopersici , all require the amino acids cystine and 
threonine. In addition tryptophane was found essential for 
L. buckneri . 

West and Lochhead (20) found that 44 percent of 
the bacteria which they isolated from the rhizosphere of

cultivated plants required some combination of amino acids 
for their growth* Purthermore biotin and thiamin were 
the most generally essential growth factors. 

Since A. polymyxa is widely distributed in soil 
(12 ? 7) and responds generally to biotin and thiamin the 
results obtained by West and Lochhead (20) appeared to be 
particularly suggestive. It seemed that this organism 
might have a specific amino acid requirement. It was 
decided to investigate this possibility. 

Method 

The method consisted of adding amino acids singly 
to the synthetic medium used in the growth factor studies 
and observing growth after inoculation and incubation, as 
described in the section dealing with this work. 

Glutamic acid was replaced by each of the amino 
acids referred to in the results. All amino acids were 
added in the amounts used by West and Lochhead (20), namely 
0.05 gm. per litre of medium. 

A number of growth factors were added in order, 
that there should exist in the medium a growth-factor supply 
more similar to that present in wheat than would be the 

\ 

case were biotin and thiamin alone supplied. Wheat has 
been shown (2) to contain the following growth factors: 
nicotinic acid, biotin, pantothenic acid, inositol and

thiamin, as well as others. Growth factors were added 
in the amounts used in the study of the requirement of 
these substances by A. polymyxa reported in a previous 
section of this paper. The following factors were added 
to the "basal" medium, namely biotin, thiamin, nicotinic 
acid, pantothenic acid and inositol. 

The utilization of amino acids by these strains 
in a reduced growth-factor medium was then studied. Biotin 
and thiamin were added to the medium. The amino acids 
added were those which supported the most luxuriant growth 
in the more complete growth-factor medium. 

Results 

Amino acid requirements of A. polymyxa in the presence 

of biotin, thiamin, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid 

and inositol 

Results obtained in these studies are summarized 
in Table VI'II. Each growth rating is the average of 
two tests conducted in triplicate. 

It is apparent that A. polymyxa exhibits no very 
specific amino acid requirements, being capable of 
making growth to a greater or lesser extent on all 
but five of eighteen amino acids included in the study. 

Marked and abundant growth was obtained where the 
following amino acids forming the sole source of nitrogen

growth of A, polymyxa compared with that obtained 
in the presence of the more complete factor environ¬ 
ment* 

Strain C47(2) showed most reduction in growth 
as a result of removal of nicotinic acid, pantothenic 
acid and inositol* No growth of this organism was 
obtained in medium containing alanine or cystine and 
only a trace in the presence of serine. 

Growth of all strains in the presence of thiamin, 
biotin and a mixture of the amino acids included in 
the study, was uniformly abundant* However no growth 
was observed when the growth factors were withdrawn. 

Inorganic Nitrogen and Urea as Nitrogen 
Sources for A* polymyxa 


Introduction 

The non-specific nature of the amino acid requirement 
of A* polymyxa suggested the possibility that some nitrogen- 
containing substances other than protein or protein deriva¬ 
tives might be utilized by this organism* A test was there¬ 
fore conducted to determine the suitability of ammonium 
sulfate, potassium nitrate and urea in this regard.

Method 

The above named salts were used singly to replace 
the amino acids in the basal synthetic medium used in the 
previous studies on nitrogen requirements of A. polymyxa . 
The usual amounts of biotin, thiamin, nicotinic acid, 
pantothenic acid and inositol were used. The procedure 
followed was that described in the section dealing with 
growth-factor requirements. 

All growth ratings were made following two 
successive transfers in the medium. 

Results 


A summary of the results obtained in two consecu¬ 
tive trials conducted in duplicate is presented in Table X.

Two strains of A. polymyxa . namely C42(2) and 
U.A.652 showed consistent ability to utilize ammonium 
sulfate as a source of nitrogen. Although some growth 
was occasionally made at first by other strains, no 
growth was recorded after the first transfer in this 
medium. 

No strains produced growth with urea or potassium 
nitrate as sources of nitrogen. 

Training of A. polymyxa to Utilize 
Ammonium Sulfate 


Introduction 

It was noticed in the course of previous work 
that preculturing A. polymyxa on a glucose-salts-growth- 
factor medium with glutamic acid as a source of nitrogen 
had some effect upon the ability of these bacteria to 
utilize ammonium sulfate. Although most of the literature 
on the subject of training deals with organisms exhibit¬ 
ing scene specific amino acid requirement, reference to 
some of this work may be of value. 

According to Gladstone (6) Knight defines train¬ 
ing as the "derivation of cultures having simpler nutrient 
requirements from cultures with a more complex nutrition." 

Fildes et al (5) states that strains of 
Bact. typhosum normally requiring specific amino acids,

©specially tryptophane, could be trained to dispense with 
this substance and utilize ammonia as a source of nitrogen* 
These workers also demonstrated that at least part of the 
training to dispense with a supply of tryptophane was due 
to acquired ability to synthesize this essential amino 
acid. A recent review of this subject is given by Gale (5). 

Since, as has been shown in this paper, A. polymyxa 
does not appear to have specific amino acid requirements, 
it must be capable of synthesizing all the necessary amino 
acids which go into the make-up of its protein and enzymes. 
This has been shown in the case of strains C42(2) and 
U.A.652 which utilize ammonium sulfate as a sole source 
of nitrogen. 

Training of a number of strains to utilize 
ammonium sulfate should be a contribution to the develop¬ 
ment of a process for the conversion of pure starch to 
glycol. 

Method 

Generally the method consisted of preculturing 
a number of strains in glutamic acid medium and comparing 
the ability of normal and "trained” strains to utilize 
ammonium sulfate as a source of nitrogen. 

Basal medium containing biotin and thiamin in 


the usual amounts, as described in the section dealing 
with growth-factor requirements, was used throughout these

tests with the exception of controls in which growth factors 
were omitted. 

The training medium contained 0.05 gm. glutamic 
acid per litre as a source of nitrogen. The medium used 
for comparison of "trained” and normal strains contained 
0.1 gm. (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 per litre. 

The procedure followed for the inoculation of 
the training medium and the ammonium sulfate medium with 
the normal trains was that described for the experiments 
referred to above. Inoculum containing the "trained" 
strains was prepared by adding two loopsful of the train¬ 
ing medium in which the bacteria had grown for 72 hours 
to 10 c.c. of sterile 0.9 percent NaCl solution. 

Growth in the ammonium sulfate medium was recorded 
after incubation for 48 hours at 55° C. The results given 
are those observed in the third generation in this medium. 

Results 

Table XI contains a summary of the average results 
obtained in two tests. 

All "trained" isolates grew well in the medium 
containing ammonium sulfate as a source of nitrogen and 
in the presence of biotin and thiamin. No growth was 
obtained in the absence of the growth factors. 

Five of the nine strains tested failed to make

The Effect of Liquid Gluten on the Glycol and Ethanol 
Yields of A. polymyxa Starch Fermentations 


Introduction 

The effect of the concentration of nitrogen upon 
the yield of products obtained has been studied for a number 
of fermentation processes. Studying the effect of carbo- 
hydrate-protein ratio upon the yields of products in the 
acetone-butanol fermentation, Fulton et al (4) showed that 
a low C:N ratio favors increased yields of acetone and 
decreased yields of ethanol. A high C:N ratio has the 
opposite effect upon the yield of solvents. Tan Niel (18) 
found that the propionic acid - acetic acid ratio in the 
propionic acid fermentation was influenced by the concen¬ 
tration of nitrogenous material in the medium. A high 
concentration of peptone was shown to be associated with 
a high propionic acid - acetic acid ratio, whereas a low 
concentration of peptone was associated with a low ratio. 

Having found gluten to be a suitable source of 
nitrogen for the Aerobacillus fermentation of starch it 
was decided to investigate the effect of gluten concentra¬ 
tion on the yield of products formed. 

Methods 


The medium used contained the following substances

at the concentrations given per 100 c.c. of liquids and 
water: starch, 6 gnu; CaCOg, 0.25 gm.; starch wash-liquor, 

10 c.c.; liquid gluten in different concentrations. The 
latter, when added, was estimated to contain approximately 
50 percent water. Gluten concentration varied as indicated 
on the graph in the following section. The starch, liquid 
gluten, and water mixture was cooked for 10 minutes in 
a steam bath at the temperature of boiling water. At the 
end of this period starch wash-liquor was added and cook¬ 
ing was continued for a further period of 15 minutes. 

CaCOg was then added and dispensed throughout the medium 
by thorough stirring. 

This medium was dispensed into 250 c.c. flasks 
in 150 c.c. lots. The flasks were then bunged and auto¬ 
claved at 15 lb. pressure for 30 minutes. 

Inoculum was prepared by transferring the 
bacterial growth from, a 24- to 36-hour-old agar slant to 
100 c.c. of sterile water. The contents of the flask were 
then shaken cautiously to bring about uniform dispersion 
of the cells in the liquid. This suspension was immediately 
added at the rate of 5 c.c. per 150 c.c. of medium, and 
distribution of the bacterial cells was obtained by shak¬ 
ing the inoculated flasks. Fermentation was carried out 
at 35° C for the first 8 to 12 hours, and at 30° C for the 
remainder of the fermentation period. This fermentation 
was found to be somewhat slower than that of whole wheat,

and consequently 96-hour periods were used instead of the 
usual 72 hours used for wheat. 

Results 

The general effect of gluten on glycol and alcohol 
yield is shown by the accompanying graph (Figure 4). Each 
point represents an average of two tests conducted in 
duplicate. 

Concentration of gluten in the medium had an effect 
on the glycol - alcohol ratio as shown in the accompanying 
figure. 

Increasing gluten concentration up to 600 mg. of 
nitrogen per 100 c.c. of medium caused a continued increase 
in glycol yield. 

The addition of 0.5 to 1 c.c. of liquid gluten 
per 100 c.c. medium caused alcohol to reach a concentration 
of just under 1 percent. This did not increase with 
further additions of gluten up to 12 c.c. per 100 c.c. of 
medium.

appeared to have some effect on starch fermentations by 
A, polymyxa . To determine the effect upon yield of glycol 
the following test was conducted* 

Method 


The media used were similar to those in the 
previous experiment, and were prepared in the same manner* 
Liquid gluten and ammonium sulfate were added in the amounts 
indicated in the tabulation of results. Inoculum was pre¬ 
pared by suspending the bacteria in sterile water and the 
conditions of temperature for incubation were followed as 
in the previous experiment. Analysis for glycol and alcohol 
were made after 96 hours* fermentation. 

Results 

Table XII is a summary of the results obtained, 
with the phage-resistant strain 042(E) and the high-glycol- 
yielding strain U.A.634. 

Glycol yields obtained from these strains indicate 
that ammonium sulfate is utilized by both. 

The optimum ammonium sulfate concentration shows 
a tendency to decrease as the gluten concentration increases. 

Generally higher yields are obtained where gluten 
plus ammonium sulfate at 0.01 percent is used, rather than 
gluten alone.

Discussion 


Although ammonium sulfate alone does not appear 
to he a satisfactory source of nitrogen for A* polymyxa in 
wheat starch fermentations, yet glycol analyses of the 
fermenting media show that this nitrogen source is utilized 
to seme extent by this organism, furthermore, in the 
presence of gluten increased yields of glycol are obtained 
in starch fermentations from the addition of small amounts 
of ammonium sulfate. However, the optimum ammonium sulfate

is lower where gluten is added to the medium than where 
it is absent. This indicates that under the conditions 
of these experiments gluten is the preferred source of 
nitrogen for A. polymyxa . 

Since both C42(2) and U.A.634 respond to ammonium 
sulfate in the starch fermentations and only the former 
has been shown to consistently utilize this source in 
studies where it formed the only source of nitrogen, some 
modifications of the latter strain must take place when 
grown in starch medium containing at least traces of amino 
nitrogen, which enables it to utilize ammonia nitrogen. 

That a change of this kind may take place has been shown 
in the study on the training of A. polymyxa to utilize 
ammonium sulfate. Such behavior might explain the increases 
in glycol yield obtained where ammonium sulfate is added 
to the starch medium.

SUMMARY 


1. Pasteurization of strains of A. polymyxa can 
be used to increase their glycol-yielding ability in the 
fermentation of 8 percent wheat mashes. 

2. Pasteurization of source material was shown to 
be an aid in the isolation of high-glycol-yielding strains 
of A. polymyxa . 

3. Soil and rotting wood were found to be good 
sources of A. polymyxa isolates. 

4. Strains of A. polymyxa from Alberta sources com¬ 
pared favorably in glycol production with those isolated 
elsewhere. 

5. A large proportion of the high-glycol-yielding 
isolates of A. polymyxa obtained in the pasteurization 
studies fell into a single group based on dye absorption 
and colony characters. 

6. The strains studied do not form spores on glucose- 
agar medium. 

7. All strains grown on non-cooked potato slices 
rotted this material in less than 72 hours at 30° C. 

8. Biotin was the only growth factor found essential

for all strains tested. 

9. Improved growth over that obtained with biotin 
alone was obtained where biotin plus any one of the fol¬ 
lowing growth factors was present in the medium: thiamin, 
pantothenic acid, nicotinic acid or inositol. 

10. Optimum growth was obtained when a mixture of 
biotin and thiamin plus one of the following was present 
in the medium: pantothenic acid, nicotinic acid or 
inositol. 

11. A form of liquid gluten apparently formed by 
enzymatic action at low temperature proved to be one of 
the most suitable sources of nitrogen for A. polymyxa in 
the fermentation of wheat starch. 

12. Under the same conditions ammonium sulfate and 
urea did not support complete hydrolysis of the starch 
by A. polymyxa . 

15. The addition of the growth factors biotin, 

nicotinic acid and thiamin to the above media did not 
improve growth in the presence of either gluten, ammonium 
sulfate or urea. 

14. A. polymyxa does not exhibit any very specific 


amino acid requirements

15* In a medium containing glucose, salts, and the 

growth factors hiotin, thiamin, nicotinic acid, pantothenic 
acid and inositol, good growth was made by A. polymyxa 
where the following amino acids, used singly, were the 
source of nitrogen: glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine, 
serine and leucine, 

16. Under these conditions meagre and inconsistent 
growth was obtained with cystine, cysteine, phenylalanine, 
methionine and isoleucine, 

17. The following amino acids were not utilized by 
A. polymyxa : lysine, tryptophane, histidine, proline and 
tyrosine. 

18. Amino acids supporting good growth in the above 
medium did so in the presence of a reduced growth-factor 
supply including biotin and thiamin only. 

19. In the complete growth-factor medium in which 

the amino acids were replaced by ammonium sulfate, potassium 
nitrate and urea, none of the strains tested utilized the 
latter two sources of nitrogen, and only two strains, namely 
C42(2) and U.A.652, utilized ammonium sulfate. 

20. A number of strains of A, polymyxa were trained 
to utilize ammonium sulfate by preculturing in a medium 
containing glutamic acid as the sole source of nitrogen.

21. Within the range studied, increasing protein 
nitrogen in the form of liquid gluten increased the yields 
of glycol from wheat starch, 

22. The C:N ratio of the medium had an effect upon 
the ratio of ethanol to glycol. Increasing nitrogen 
concentrations causedan increased glycol - ethanol ratio. 

23. In starch media containing liquid gluten and 
ammonium sulfate the former source of nitrogen was preferred 
by A.polymyxa ,
