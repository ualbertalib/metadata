THE PROBLEM 


The general problem undertaken was an 
engineering and economic evaluation under Alberta 
conditions of the Pidgeon process (26) for the 
manufacture of carbon black from natural gas. 
Specifically, this investigation was to have dealt 
with: 

(1) the design of equipment using commercial 
size refractory tubes 

(2) the testing of the equipment design and 
materials of construction 

(3) the collection of fundamental data on 
the gas phase decomposition of natural 
gas under controlled conditions 

(4) evaluation of the carbon black produced 

Due to the failure of the available refractory 
tubes, only the first two parts of the investigation were 
carried out.

SUMMARY 


This investigation involved the design and con¬ 
struction of pilot plant equipment for the engineering and 
economic evaluation of the Pidgeon Process for the manufacture 
of carbon black from natural gas. 

The process, investigated on a laboratory scale by 
Dr. L. M. Pidgeon for the National Research Council in 1935 
involves the thermal decomposition of natural gas in externally 
heated refractory tubes. The essential feature of the process 
is the use of permeable refractory tubes through the walls of 
which a certain amount of inert gas is allowed to pass. By this 
means the deposition of carbon black thereon is prevented. 

In the laboratory scale equipment yields as high as 19 pounds 
of good quality carbon black per thousand cubic feet of natural 
gas were obtained. 

An extensive literature search was carried out to 
obtain information on equipment design, operating conditions 
and the fundamental characteristics of carbon black. These 
characteristics ares pH, surface area, structure, roughness 
factor and surface activity. The most important factors affect¬ 
ing these characteristics are reaction temperature-and contact 
time at this temperature. 

A furnace and auxiliary equipment designed for reactor 
tubes with an inside diameter up to 3 inches and a length of 
4 feet, were built. Permeable aluminum oxide reactor tubes with 
inside diameters of 2 and 3 inches and wall thicknesses of 





























































































































' 





















l/2 and l/4 inches respectively were tested but no results 
were obtained due to the failure of the reactor tubes. Each 
of the three tubes fractured after a short time at high tempera 
tures. 

No definite conclusions regarding the feasibility 
of the process can be made from the information obtained. 
Further tests should be carried out on more suitable reactor 
tubes.

I. INTRODUCTION 


The past decade has seen a tremendous increase in 
the production of synthetic organic chemicals using natural 
gas as the raw material. Natural gas, remarkably versatile in 
its applications, is available in large volumes at low cost. 

Each of the basic reactions, such as decomposition, oxidation, 
nitration, halogenation, pyrolysis and several others, gives 
rise to a family of primary organic chemicals which in turn 
are the building blocks for numerous other chemicals and 
products. 

In Alberta, despite large and growing reserves of 
natural gas, the development of a chemical industry using natural 
gas has been very slow, A synthetic ammonia plant was built 
during World War II and a petrochemical plant is now under 
construction in Edmonton, One other plant, which will utilize 
hydrocarbon gases as the basic raw material, has been proposed. 

It is well known that, the most serious deterrent to the estab¬ 
lishment in Alberta of further natural gas utilization processes 
such as a carbon black Industry, has been the comparatively small 
market within economic reach. This situation, however, is slowly 
changing and even today serious consideration is being given 
to the establishment of plants for the manufacture of a wide 
variety of products. 

The Research Council of Alberta and the Department 
of Chemical Engineering of the University of Alberta have 
jointly inaugurated a long term research program on the industrial

utilization of natural gas. The principal objectives of this 
program are the technical investigation and commercial evaluation, 
under Alberta conditions, of certain hydrocarbon processes and 
the development within the Province of a center of knowledge 
concerning the current developments in this field. 

The engineering and economic evaluation of the 
Pidgeon Process (26} for the manufacture of carbon black from 
natural gas undertaken in this investigation, is one phase of 
this program. 

Carbon black, a generic term covering an important 
group of industrial carbons used chiefly as reinforcing agents 
in rubber and as coloring pigments in paints and inks, is 
produced from natural gas, oil enriched gas or oil. It has been 
used in the manufacture of inks and paints since the sixteenth 
century B.C. In 1910, an English rubber firm (33) investigating 
a large number of compounds as fillers for rubber, discovered 
the reinforcing properties of carbon black. At the present 
time 90 % of all the carbon black produced is being used in the 
compounding of rubber. The United States, with its immense 
gas reserves, became the chief supplier of the world’s carbon 
black requirements. 

Carbon black is produced by three main processes 
involving the thermal decomposition of natural gas and the 
collection of the resulting carbon black. The processes vary 
in the way in which decomposition is accomplished. The physical 
and chemical properties of the carbon black depend largely upon 
the environment of the carbon particles immediately after the

decomposition of the hydrocarbon. The three processes are the 
Channel Process (19), the Furnace Combustion Process 0.1), and 
the Furnace Thermal Process 0-1) • 

The channel process, which accounts for about half 
of the total production, gives a high quality carbon black 
suitable for compounding in natural rubber. However, the yields 
are very low, 1.5 to 2.25 pounds of carbon black per thousand 
cubic feet of natural gas. The furnace combustion and thermal 
processes, although giving much higher yields, produce a carbon 
black of a different quality. The yields range from 4 to 16 
pounds, depending on the grade being produced. As the quality 
of furnace and thermal black is made to approach that of channel 
black, the quantity recovered becomes only slightly more than 
the recovery in the channel process. 

Much research work has been done and is being done on 
these processes to improve yield and quality of the carbon 
black produced. The channel process seems to have reached the 
zenith of its technical development, but the furnace combustion 
and thermal processes are relatively new - their products being 
best suited for compounding in synthetic rubbers. 

A large number of patents for carbon processes have 
been issued. Most of these have to do with variations of the 
furnace combustion process. There are three other methods on 
which some development work has been done. One of these processes 
(25) involves the high temperature, normal pressure decomposition 
of natural gas in an electric arc with rapid quenching to prevent 
polymerization of the low molecular weight hydrocarbons formed.

The main products of this process are carbon black, acetylene, 
ethylene and hydrogen. This process is not suitable for Alberta 
because of the lack at present of cheap electric power. Another 
method (34) involves the explosion of a mixture of acetylene and 
natural gas or refinery gases with a limited amount of air. Due 
to the present high cost of acetylene, this method does not appear 
economically feasible. A third method, the Pidgeon Process (26) 
investigated on a laboratory scale, shows some promise. The 
process was suggested by Dr. L. M. Pidgeon for the National 
. Research Council some fifteen years ago. In his preliminary 
investigation. Dr. Pidgeon claimed a recovery of 19 pounds of 
carbon black per thousand cubic feet of natural gas. The carbon 
content of one thousand cubic feet of gas is about 32 pounds. 

The carbon black was found to be similar to good grade thermal 
blacks. 

There are several important factors to be considered 
in the proposal of a carbon black process suitable for develop¬ 
ment under Alberta conditions. 

The carbon black industry is in a state of rapid 
technological development. The introduction of several new 
synthetic rubbers has necessitated the development of new grades 
of carbon black. New compounding techniques such as the 
introduction of carbon into rubber in the latex stage (called 
masterbatching), has led to the development of oil black, the 
best suited for this purpose. Oil black is made by modified 
furnace combustion black processes, such as the Phillips 
Petroleum Company’s process,* using catalytic cycle stock or

other cheap oils. The best location for a furnace oil black 
plant would be right next to a synthetic rubber plant, since 
the carbon black could be transported by pipeline in the form 
of a water slurry and incorporated directly into the latex. 

This would save a great deal on handling costs. 

The Canadian consumption of carbon black amounts to 
about 50,000,000 pounds annually (6). Probably one half of this 
consists of three grades of channel black and the rest consists 
of about six different grades of furnace black. By present 
methods of production, a plant to supply Canadian needs, would 
involve a plurality of small units. It has been suggested (37) 
that a furnace black plant is economical to operate only if it 
produces over 12,000,000 pounds of carbon black per year. There 
is little possibility of entering the world market because of 
the high cost of transportation from Alberta to the seaboard. 

The policy of the Alberta government which operates 
through the Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board, would 
prohibit the installation in Alberta of any natural gas consuming 
industry which does not make reasonably effective use of the 
natural gas raw material. It is understood that the Conservation 
Board take the view that channel black plants with their low 
conversion efficiency do not represent efficient utilization of 
natural gas. The policy, however, is not one which automatically 
prohibits carbon black manufacture, but which will require carbon 
black production by an efficient process. 

The laboratory scale investigation of the Pidgeon 
process indicates that good grades of carbon black can be

produced with a high recovery. Further investigation of the 
process may reveal that by varying the conditions of the 
decomposition reaction several grades of carbon black can be 
produced with the same equipment.

II. FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CARBON BLACK 

Extensive electron microscope studies of carbon black 

(8) (9) have revealed the particles to be essentially spherical 
in shape. In carbon blacks made by certain methods, the 
particles appear to have varying tendencies to link up into 
chainlike structures (9). This effect is most pronounced in 
acetylene black and is least evident in the case of thermal 
blacks. High electrical conductance is associated with this 
structure. 

X-ray diffraction work (7) has indicated the carbon 
black particles to be mainly crystalline in nature with some 
amorphous particles blended in. Particle size is in the range 
5 to 35 millimicrons for channel black, 50 to 80 millimicrons 
for furnace black and 100 to 300 millimicrons for thermal black 

(9) . The particles of a given sample of carbon black are not 
of a uniform diameter but show a distribution in size. Channel 
blacks are the most uniform and furnace thermal blacks show the 
greatest variation. 

Carbon black consists chiefly of carbon with combined 
hydrogen and oxygen in varying amounts (14) depending on the 
method of manufacture. The hydrogen present in carbon black is 
residual hydrogen from the hydrocarbon raw material. It is 
presumably bonded to the carbon atoms in the quasi-graphitic 
lattice structure by true valence bonds. The oxygen present In 
carbon black is chemisorbed on the particle surface in the form 
of carbon oxygen complexes whose structure is still the subject 
of speculation. The amount of oxygen present appears to have

The scale of available types and grades of carbon 
black ranging from the finest channel black to the coarsest 
thermal black is termed the "Carbon Spectrum". The behavior of 
any of these carbons can be rationalized on the basis of three 
fundamental properties (SI); 1. pH* 2. Surface* 3. Structure 

pH: When a sample of carbon black is mixed into 
distilled water or a neutral salt solution* a definite* reprod¬ 
ucible pH is established. The pH properties of carbon blacks 
were first described In 1937 (36). This investigation revealed 
that pH values ranged from 2.5 to 11.0 depending on the grade

of carbon black and its method of manufacture. Low or acid pH 
was shown to be intimately related to the volatile matter 
(C x Oy complexes) on the carbon surface. No explanation has 
been offered to account for high or alkaline pH other than the 
absence of volatile matter. 

This volatile matter was found to be responsible for 
the strongly selective adsorptive behavior of l, acid u reinforcing 
carbons for alkaline substances and for alkaline rate of cure 
accelerators used in natural rubber compounding. pH is the 
preferred index to the rate of cure of carbon-rubber compounds. 

Surfaces For years the reinforcing action of carbon 
black in rubber was ascribed to the finess of the black used. 

The conjecture as to the size of carbon black particles was 
dispelled in 1940 (8) by the use of the electron microscope. 

The carbon black particles could now be seen and measured. 

Based on these more precise size measurements, it was 
found that surface area across the carbon spectrum ranged from 
1 to 32 acres per pound of carbon black. With this information 
the role played by particle surface in the reinforcement of 
rubber was rationalized. It was shown In 1942 (9) that carbon 
surface plays a dominant role in such reinforced rubber proper¬ 
ties as plasticity, hardness, modulus, energy, tensile strength 
and rebound resilience. 

Structure: Anomalies in the behavior of certain 
blacks having essentially the same pH value and surface area led 
to the introduction of the structure concept in 1942 (3, 9, 30, 
35). The electron microscope revealed that the anomalous

behavior of these blacks was intimately associated with 
recognizable differences in their agglomeration and dispersion 
habits. The ’’low” anomalous carbons displayed a low degree of 
agglomeration in the dry state with a high degree of dispers- 
ability in the mixed condition. The ’’high” anomalous carbons 
on the other hand, showed a striking agglomeration habit in the 
dry state which took the form of a branched network rather than 
a clustered structure. 

Dispersion tests revealed that the network type of 
agglomeration was very resistant to dispersion. In some cases 
the network structures were present after extensive milling. 

The property of carbons involving agglomeration habit with a 
corresjjonding wide variation in dispersion behavior was simply 
referred to as ”structure”. All carbons were described as having 
varying degrees of structure. Structure provides the index to 
anomalies in modulus, hardness, extrusion and related properties 
in rubber. 

Closer study of the three fundamental characteristics 
of carbon blacks revealed further anomalies. The measurement 
of total particle surface by nitrogen adsorption isotherms 
(13, 27) and recognition of differences between electron micro¬ 
scope and nitrogen surface values, led to the introduction of 
’’roughness factor” ( 2 ) as a possible new dimension of carbon 
black. This provided a quantitative measure of surface roughness 
or extension present, a property measurably affecting rate of 
cure when existent to any appreciable degree.

carbons in various rubbers by their fundamental characteristics 
seemed adequate until the development of fully reinforcing 
furnace combustion blacks and the introduction of "cold" rubber. 
"Gold rubber" is the term applied to a GR-S type of synthetic 
rubber produced by the polymerization of butadiene and styrene 
in a continuous process at a temperature of 41° F. Ordinary 
GR-S is primarily a copolymer of butadiene and styrene prepared 
at 122° F in a batch process. 

Preliminary studies in "cold rubbers" consistently 
revealed significant differences between these carbons in the 
development of hardness properties that could not be adequately 
explained by their dimensional properties. Failure to resolve 
this modulus difference by exhaustive tests on the carbons, 
which revealed in the electron microscope as well as in other 
dimensional tests, substantial equality in fineness and structure, 
led to an investigation of various factors that contribute to 
the development of hardness properties in rubber compounds as a 
possible clue to this anomaly. In 1949, the Research Laborat¬ 
ories of Columbian Carbon Company (4 , 26, 32) showed that there 
was a new reinforcing element in cold rubber treads, viz. the 
carbon gel complex. This concept evolved out of "bound rubber" 
studies. Bound rubber refers to solvent insoluble rubber in 
association with carbon black. Carbon black gel complex or more 
simply carbon gel, refers to all the benzene insoluble rubber 
formed in unvulcanized carbon black rubber compounds. Although 
particle size, as well as structure influence carbon gel 
formation, a new property__o-f carbon black was indicated.

viz*, surface activity. 

Through the evaluation of these basic carhon black 
properties by simple laboratory tests (31) and by recognition 
of the effects of these properties in the behavior of carbons 
in rubber, it is possible to predict fairly closely the 
behavior of any carbon of the spectrum in a rubber.

III. CARBON BLACK PROCESSES 


Carbon black is the product of the thermal 
decomposition, at high temperatures, of gaseous or liquid 
hydrocarbons. Natural gas, from which most of the carbon black 
is produced, consists primarily of methane and ethane, the two 
most stable hydrocarbons. 

The thermal decomposition of methane and ethane has 
been widely investigated but there has been little agreement as 
to reaction rates and the mechanism of decomposition. 

Egloff (12) lists 45 investigations of the thermal decomposition 
of methane and 21 for ethane. While free energy data indicate 
that methane is unstable above 575° C (16), it is generally- 
agreed that the decomposition of methane proceeds at an appreciable 
rate only at temperatures above 800° C. 

The decomposition of methane Into its elements accord¬ 
ing to the equation 

CH a -C + 2H P (1) 

attains equilibrium only when a catalyst Is present® Y/ithout a 
catalyst, equilibrium is not realized but the nature of the 
retarding force is not known. Table II shows the composition 
of equilibrium mixtures of methane and hydrogen at atmospheric 
pressure in contact with carbon as observed by Coward and 
Wilson (10).

Investigations of the effects of catalysts on 
decomposition reaction have revealed two types of action; 
specific catalytic action and a surface action. Silica at 
times appears to retard and at other times to accelerate the 
decomposition reaction. The presence of a hot surface appears 
to facilitate the reaction but does not make it approach 
equilibrium more closely than a gas phase reaction. The carbon 
deposited on a surface is crystalline in nature and is of little 
commercial value. 

Most carbonaceous materials, notably graphitic carbon, 
metals such as aluminum, cobalt, nickel and iron, and compounds 
such as calcium oxide, zinc oxide, nickel oxide, aluminum 
chloride and potassium hydroxide catalize the decomposition 
reaction. These catalysts lower the temperature of the reaction 
to the range 300° to 800° G. However, as in the presence of 
a hot non-catalytic surface, the carbon is deposited on the 
catalyst in a crystalline form. 

The heat of reaction for the thermal decomposition 
of methane into carbon and hydrogen has been given by Parks

where Ah = calories per gram mol

The reaction does not appear to proceed directly to 
the formation of carhon and hydrogen. Under certain conditions 
investigators have obtained traces of unsaturated hydrocarbons 
such as acetylene, ethylene, propylene, benzene, napthalene 
and tarry materials. This indicates the possibility of partial 
dehydrogenation with the formation of free radicals. The free 
radicals unite to produce the unsaturated hydrocarbons which 
then break down into carbon and hydrogen. Certain grades of 
carbon black produced at lower temperatures contain substantial 
amounts of tarry materials. 

The decomposition of methane and ethane by partial 
combustion, as in the channel and furnace combustion processes, 
is not the result of preferential oxidation of the hydrogen 
of the hydrocarbons, but is due to the thermal cracking of the 
hydrocarbon in the oxygen free zone of the flames. 

The fundamental characteristics of carbon black, 
surface area, pH, structure, roughness factor and surface 
activity for a given feedstock depend upon the following factors 

(1) Reaction temperature 

(2) Time of contact 

(3) Conditions after particle formation 

These factors are described for the individual processes later 
in this section.

The surface area, a measure of particle size, depends 
upon the length of time the carbon black particles are exposed 
to high temperatures. Particle size is also somewhat affected 
by the molecular weight of the hydrocarbon. The pH of carbon 
black is associated with the C x Oy complexes formed on the 
surface of the carbon particle by the reaction of HgO, COg and 
Og with the carbon. At higher temperatures, reaction of the 
carbon particle surface with these oxidizing gases is rapid but 
the carbon complexes tend to be driven off almost as fast as 
formed, carrying away as mono- and dioxides. This results in 
an extension of specific surface presumably due to the etching 
of the carbon particle surface to produce irregularities. 

Surface extension is indicated by the value of the roughness 
factor. No explanations have been advanced for the conditions 
affecting structure formation and surface activity. 

THS CHANNEL PROCESS 

In the channel process the high temperature and heat 
requirements are obtained by the combustion of natural gas in a 
small uninsulated diffusion flame. The oxygen for combustion 
is supplied by diffusion through the invisible outer layer of 
carbon dioxide. The combustion in the outer layer supplies 
the heat required to thermally decompose the natural gas in the 
inner core of the flame into carbon and hydrogen. The sudden 
cooling to prevent agglomeration and combustion of the incan¬ 
descent carbon particles is accomplished by impinging the flame 
on a relatively cool surface; 8 to 10 inch standard iron 
channels are used for this purpose. The temperatures range from

1,000° C to 1,200° C in various parts of the diffusion flame* 

The channels are maintained at a temperature of about 500° C. 

An almost unlimited volume of air is supplied but the conditions 
are adjusted to prevent complete combustion. 

The period of time from the formation of the carbon 
particles to the sudden cooling by impingement is less than 
0.1 seconds (29). Little time is available for particle growth 
after nucleuses formation, hence the small particle size of 
channel black. For several seconds after deposition on the 
channel, the carbon black is exposed, at 500° G, to an 
atmosphere containing C02, H 2 O, O 2 resulting in the formation 
of C x Oy complexes on the particle surface. Apparently oxygen 
is added until the surface is almost saturated. This treatment 
does not result in surface development to any great extent® 


THE FURNACE COMBUSTION PROCESS 

In this process natural gas is burned with insuffic¬ 
ient air in a special furnace. The air and gas are injected 
into the fire chamber in alternate layers that are in laminar 
flow; combustion takes place in the diffusion layers at the 
interfaces. Only about 50%> of the air theoretically required 
to burn all of the natural gas raw material to carbon dioxide 
and water is injected. All of this air is consumed rapidly 
by combustion to carbon mono- and dioxides and water in the first 
10 % to 20% of the furnace length. The flames may be described 
as nonpremixed flames burning in a mildly turbulent insulated 
enclosure. The unburned portion of the natural gas is almost

completely decomposed into carbon and hydrogen. 

The black made in this process is exposed to 
temperatures of 1,100° to 1,400° C for 1 to 5 seconds (29). 

At this temperature level, reactions between the carbon black 
particles and C0 2 and HgO occur at a rapid rate, resulting in 
an extension of specific surface. The C x 0^ complexes formed 
on the particle surface are driven off because of the high 
temperature. 

The relatively long contact time (i.e. retention time 
in the furnace at high temperature) results in a wide particle 
size distribution because nucleuses can continue to form during 
the period in which particles are growing in size. The hot 
carbon particles may act as a catalyst in the decomposition 
of more of the hydrocarbon gas. 

The mean particle size, pH value, roughness factor, 
and structure are all affected by the retention time in the 
firechamber and the firechamber temperature. 

The off-gas carrying the carbon black is quenched to 
about 210° G with water spray and the carbon black is collected 
in cyclones after agglomeration in an electric precipitator. 

TKB FURNACE THERMAL PROCESS 

In the furnace thermal process the heat fcrr decomposi¬ 
tion is supplied by the preheated refractory materials with 
which the furnace is packed. The refractory material is pre¬ 
heated to 1,200° to 1,400° C. During the decomposition cycle 
the refractory is allowed to cool to about 900° C. 

The retention time in the furnace is 3 to 4 seconds 
(34) and during this time about of the hydrocarbon gas is

decomposed. More than half of the carbon formed is deposited on 
the refractory surface and the rest is carried in suspension by 
the off-gas. The carbon formed by decomposition on the refractory 
surface is crystalline in nature and even if it was recoverable, 
it would be of no commercial value. It is burned during the 
heating cycle to supply part of heat required for preheating 
the refractory packing of the furnace. 

Part of the off-gas is sometimes recycled. It acts 
as a diluent for the decomposing natural gas. This dilution 
is so effective that it may reduce particle size to about one 
fifth of that produced by a straight run (18). 

Particle size and other properties are affected by 
the retention time, the gas velocity past the refractory packing, 
the way the refractory packing is arranged and the degree of 
dilution. Since there is no H 2 O, GOg or Og present during- 
decomposition, pH and the roughness factor remain substantially 
constant for each particle size. Very little structure is 
apparent in carbon black produced by this process. 

As the off-gas leaves the furnace, it is quenched to 
about 210° C with water spray. The carbon black is collected 
with a combination of electric precipitators and cyclones or 
by means of bag filters. 

THH PROPOSED PIDGEON PROCESS 

The essential feature of the Pidgeon process 
investigated on a laboratory scale, is the use of a refractory 
tube through the walls of which inert gases are diffused by 
means of a pressure differential to form a layer on the inside

20 


wall of the tube. The purpose of this layer is to keep the 
decomposition reaction entirely in the gas phase. Deposition 
on the walls of the tube is undesirable because carbon black 
is a good insulator and the black formed on a hot surface is of 
no value. 

The energy required for decomposition of the hydro¬ 
carbons is supplied by conduction and radiation through the 
walls of the tube. Flue gases from the furnace firechamber 
serve as the diffusing gas. 

In this process time of contact and reactor tube 
temperature can be closely controlled. The presence of HgO* 

CO 2 and O 2 in the diffusing flue gas makes the carbon black 
particles subject to after-treatment resulting in variation in 
pH and roughness factor. 

The carbon black produced by this process with 
laboratory scale equipment had properties midway between those 
of channel and thermal black. The contact times used ranged from 
0.1 to 1.2 seconds at temperatures of 1*360° to 1,390° G.

IV. THE PIDC-EON PROCESS - A REVIEW OF PIDGEON 'P WORK 

In the carbon black production method (26) investigated 
on a laboratory scale by Dr. L. M. Pidgeon for the National 
Research Council in 1955, a "wall-free n reaction space was 
provided by diffusing inert gases through the wall of a 
permeable refractory tube. Dr. Pidgeon used a Norton Alundum 
tube, 15 inches long, 1 inch in diameter, with a wall thickness 
of l/8 of an inch. The tube was heated in a gas fired furnace; 
the flue gas serving as the inert gas. The diffusion rate of 
the flue gas was controlled by varying the pressure across the 
wall of the tube. The furnace was operated at atmospheric 
pressure and a vacuum was maintained in the tube by means of a 
vacuum pump. The carbon black was collected on a cloth filter 
after the cooling of the cracked gas by means of water cooled 
baffles. 

The tube was protected from direct flames by a 
periclase plate placed between the burners and the tube. The 
outside temperature of the tube was measured with a l, Pythagoros n 
tube shielded platinum, platinum-rhodium thermocouple for the 
lower range of temperatures and an optical pyrometer for the 
higher temperatures. No attempt was made to measure the tempera¬ 
ture of the gas during thermal decomposition. 

Before each run the tube was calibrated for variation 
of rate of diffusion with differential pressure. The minimum 
rate of diffusion required to keep the carbon black from coating 
out on the walls of the tube was determined experimentally for

The yields listed in Table III are based on the volume 
of inlet gas. Yields are usually stated for the total volume 
of gas which includes both the reaction gas and the gas required 
for heating. 

The composition of the off-gas depends upon a number 
of factors; the degree of decomposition of the inlet gas* the 
diffusion to inlet gas ratio* the composition of the flue gas* 
the composition of the inlet gas and reactions taking place 
between the flue gas and the gas in the reactor tube. Several 
reactions are possible and the relative rates at which these 
reactions take place have a bearing on the composition of the 
off-gas.

Calculations of the 

heat 

available from 

the off-gas 


show that with proper design and facilities for heat exchange 
it may be possible to supply the heat requirements with the 
off-gas. For example; on off-gas of the composition shown in 
column 1, Table IV, has a heating value of about 190 Btu per 
cubic foot. To produce this off-gas, 57$ of the inlet gas was 
decomposed and the ratio of inlet gas to diffusion gas was 0.6. 

The heat requirement for 37$ thermal decomposition of one cubic 
foot of the gas is about 21 Btu at 1,400° C. The theoretical 
flame temperature for the off-gas is about 1,680° G and the heat 
available at 1,400° G is 58 Btu for each cubic foot of inlet gas. 
In actual practice, the theoretical flame temperature would not 
be attained and the available heat would be cut down by heat 
losses. (See Appendix D) 

Figure I, a plot of Pidgeon’s data, indicates an optimum 
time of contact for greatest yield. The inlet gas rate to 
diffusion gas rate ratio appears to have little effect over a 
limited range on the yield at the same contact time. This optimum 
time of contact is probably an individual characteristic of each 
tube size. Sufficient data were not available to show the effect 
of time of contact on the heating value of the off-gas.

The carbon black produced in Dr. Pidgeon f s 
investigation showed rubber reinforcing properties very similar 
to those of furnace thermal black. A full investigation of the 
effects on yield and properties of different times of contact, 
dilution of the inlet gas and reaction temperature was not made. 

There are so many factors affecting this process that 
data acquired on small scale apparatus cannot be extrapolated 
for use in the design of commercial equipment. The results of 
Dr. Pidgeon’s investigation show that the process has 
possibilities and merits investigation on a larger scale.

V. EQUIPMENT DESIGN 

The evolution and development of a process may be 
divided into five distinct stages: 

(1) Laboratory stage 

(2) Small sized model 

(3) Large sized unit 

(4) Semicommercial plant 

(5) Commercial plant 

The correctness of the technical principle of the process and 
the commercial soundness are tested in the first stage. 

Assuming that the laboratory stage yields favorable results, 
development passes to the small sized model. The purpose of this 
stage is to determine the optimum operating conditions, to evalu¬ 
ate the properties of the products and to obtain design data for 
a full sized unit. A preliminary investigation of the economics 
of the process is also made at this stage® 

This investigation of the Pidgeon process represents 
a stage intermediate between the small sized model and the large 
sized unit. The equipment was designed to allow use of commercial 
size reactor tubes and standard materials in its construction. 

The essential requirements of the equipment may be 
stated as follows: 

(1) a means of heating the reactor tube and providing 
inert gases for diffusion into the tube 

(2) a method of applying a pressure differential 
across the walls of the tube to provide the 
driving force for gas diffusion

(3) provision for reactor tube temperature 
measurement 

(4) a means of supplying and metering natural gas 
to the reactor tube 

(5) a method of quenching the off-gas to prevent 
agglomeration of the carbon black 

(6) provisions for the collection of the carbon black 

(7) provisions for the measuring and controlling of 
flowrates, temperatures and pressures 

The first step in the design was the choice of a 
reactor tube diameter. Commercial tubes were available in 
diameters of 1, 2 and 3 inches. The equipment was designed for 
a 3 inch diameter tube, but provisions were made for the testing 
of 1 and 2 inch diameter tubes. The tubes were obtained from 
the Norton Company of Worcester, Mass. This firm also supplied 
the tubes for Dr. Pidgeon’s investigation. 

The Norton Alundum HA 1139 permeable aluminum oxide 
tubes were 3 feet long and had an inside diameter of 3 inches 
and a wall thickness of l/4 of an inch. The diffusion rate 
through walls of the cold tubes was of the order of 0.5 cubic 
feet per minute per square foot under a pressure differential 
of 2 inches of water. 

It was decided that a furnace in which the reactor 
tube is horizontal would be the easiest to build. A minimum 
fire chamber length of 2 feet necessitated the extension of the 
3 foot reactor tube. This was accomplished by cementing into 
one end of the reactor tube a Norton Alundum RA 1139 tube

18 inches long with an inside diameter of 2 inches and a wall 
thickness of 3/8 of an inch. To maintain a pressure differential 
of several inches of water between the reactor tube and the 
furnace firechamber, two methods were available; pressurization 
of the furnace or application of a vacuum to the reactor tube. 
Both of these methods were incorporated into the design. 

Pressurization of the furnace necessitated the 
construction of airtight steel shell over the brickwork of the 
furnace (See Figures III and IV). The case consisted of 16 gauge 
black iron sheets spot welded to 1 inch angle iron frames. 

The panels were bolted together with 1/4 inch machine bolts. 
Rubber gaskets were used at all joints. The base of the furnace 
consisted of a l/4 inch steel plate mounted on a channel and 
I-beam framework. 

Preliminary operation showed that it was necessary to 
pressurize the space between the case and brickwork to prevent 
overheating of the case by hot flue gas leakage from the fire- 
chamber . 

To make the reactor tube and furnace firechamber 
pressure control more versatile,, jet ejectors were Installed on 
the flue gas and off-gas discharge lines (See Figure V). These 
ejectors consisted of a 2 inch 90° elbow and a ventuni section 
with a throat diameter of 1 inch and wall to axis angles of 
7° and 15°. A section of 1/4 inch standard iron pipe reaching 
within l/2 inch of the throat was used as the nozzle. These jet 
ejectors were found to have a large capacity and at no load 
developed 24 inches of water_vacuum with a line air pressure of

40 psi. It was found that the furnace operated more evenly if 
the firechamber was maintained at atmospheric pressure. The 
pressure differential across the walls of the tube was obtained 
by putting a vacuum on the reactor tube by means of the jet 
ejector. 

Fire brick able to operate continuously at temperature 
of 1,600° C was necessary for the firechamber. For insulation 
a inch layer of insulating firebrick and a 3 inch layer of 
A.P. Green block insulation were used. A.P. Green Fire Brick Go 
Ltd. products; Mex-ko fire brick, G-23 insulating fire brick 
and Sairset high temperature mortar were used in the construc¬ 
tion. Special shapes were made from plastic firebrick. The 
brickwork is shown in Figures VIII to X. 

To prevent flames from impinging directly on the tube 
and to provide for a more even temperature distribution along 
the reactor tube, silicon carbide plates 8 x 24 x 1 Inches were 
installed between the burners and the tube.(See Figure X). 

Dr. Pidgeon's investigation showed that 0.1 seconds 
was about the minimum time of contact for the flame temperatures 
obtainable with an air-natural gas fuel mixture which was not 
preheated. 

The heat requirements for the 3 inch reactor tube 
were calculated on the basis of 60 % decomposition of natural 
gas, a contact time of 0.1 second and the flue gas diffusion 
rate used in most of Dr. Pidgeon’s runs (See Appendix A-l). 

The heat output required to supply 12,000 Btu per hour at 
1,400° G for decomposition and to allow for heat losses was

calculated to be 100,000 Btu per hour. Four Eclipse Fuel 
Engineering Company #2HBA burners and a #44-14LP proportional 
mixer with a 1 inch zero gas governor were used to supply the 
heat load. Air and natural gas for the proportional mixer were 
obtained from existing laboratory service mains. 

No arrangement for venting high temperature gases 
existed in the laboratory making it necessary to cool the flue 
gases before venting to the outside through uninsulated iron 
pipe. Cooling of the flue gases to 200° C was accomplished by 
water spray in a cooling tower of 5 inch steel tubing 5J- feet 
long (See Figure XI). Three Spraying Systems Co. #1/8 G-Gl 
nozzles were used to handle the 21.5 gallons of water required 
for cooling. To make certain that no water was sprayed into the 
furnace through the 4 inch diameter ceramic flue lining 
(Norton Alundum) the spray tower was offset. The water cooled 
jacketed offset elbow was made of stainless steel because of the 

t 

possibility of corrosion. The nozzles were connected to a line 
filter in the water supply line by means of copper tubing. 

Water at 20 psi from the laboratory service main was used to 
supply the spray system. A warning system consisting of contact 
points in the quench unit drainage sump, a relay, a panel light 
and a bell was incorporated into the unit to warn of jflooding 
(See Figure XII). 

The furnace was lit by means of a spark gap on a 
wand inserted into the furnace through lighting ports. The ports 
were lined with 1 inch inside diameter aluminum oxide tubes 
(See Figure X). High voltage current for the spark gap was

supplied by an induction coil drawing current from a six-volt 
storage battery. Valves on the manifold leading to the burners 
permitted lighting of each burner individually. 

The diffusion rate of the flue gas into the reactor 
tube was controlled by varying the pressure in the firechamber 
and tube. The pressures were varied by means of the jet ejectors 
on the flue gas and off-gas exhaust lines and by a butterfly 
valve on the flue gas exhaust line. 

The natural gas supply for the reactor tube was 
obtained from the laboratory service main. Since the main 
pressure was only 9 inches of water, it was necessary to compress 
the gas. A 3 inch bore, 3j inch stroke Curtis compressor driven 
by a 1 horsepower electric motor was used. The gas was passed 
from the compressor through an oil removal filter to a 6 cubic 
foot surge tank (See Figure XIII). The oil removal filter was 
packed with 1 foot of l/4 inch raschig rings, 6 inches of glass 
wool and 6 inches of granulated charcoal. From the surge tank, 
the gas was passed through a pressure reducer and into a 
rotameter for flow rate measurement. The compressor was switched 
on and off by a pressure switch actuated by surge tank pressure. 
Air and nitrogen lines were Installed to purge the reactor tube. 
The compressor crankcase was vented to the outside through 
l/4 inch pipe. 

The surface temperature of the reactor tube was 
measured with a Leeds Northrup #8621 optical pyrometer through 
quartz window pyrometer ports. Quartz windows were used because 
of their low radiation absorptivity. Temperature measurements

were made on the section of reactor tube in the fire chamber 
at 3, llj and 20 inches measured from the outlet end. Three 
aluminum oxide tubes of 1 inch jnside diameter, running through 
the steel case insulation and brickwork served as the sighting 
tunnels. The opening at the top of each tube was sealed off by 
means of a special flange mounted quartz window holder 
(See Figures IV. and XIV). To cool the pyrometer ports and to 
help keep the inside of the quartz windows from being coated with 
dust, compressed air was blown into each port just below the 
quartz window. 

To quench the off-gas immediately after its exit from 
the reactor tube, a water spray tower type of quench unit was 
used (See Figures XV and XVI). This unit was made from 16 gauge 
stainless steel sheet. Stainless steel was necessary to prevent 
corrosion and contamination of the carbon black with Iron oxide. 
The cooling was accomplished in a spray chamber 6 inches in 
diameter, 3 feet high, equipped with 2 Spray Systems #l/8 GG1 
nozzles. A flood warning system similar to that in the flue 
gas quench unit was installed. The design calculations are 
shown in Appendix A-3. 

Originally a collection system involving the agglomera¬ 
tion of the carbon black with high frequency sound and its 
collection with a cyclone was considered, however, the high cost 
of a suitable sound generator necessitated the abandonment of 
this scheme in favor of a bag filter unit. 

The bag filter unit consisted of a cylindrical sheet 
metal housing containing three glass cloth bags 6 inches in

diameter and 2 feet long (See Figures XVI and XVII). The bags 
were made of National Filter Media Go. style G201 glass cloth. 

The tops of the bags were attached by means of coil springs to 
a shaking mechanism consisting of a three arm spider mounted on 
a crank having a 2 \ inch turning radius. The crank was turned 
by means of a belt drive from a motor mounted Graham Variable 
Speed Transmission. The bottoms of the bags were fixed over 
holes in a horizontal plate (See Figure XVIII). The collected 
carbon black dropped into a conical storage section. 

To simplify operation of the unit all controlling* 
measuring and Indicating devices were grouped together on one 
control panel (See Figures XIX and XX). The controlling and 
measuring means for each stream and variable are listed in Table V. 
A schematic diagram of the complete pilot plant unit is shown 
in Figure XXI. a Meriam u manometers were used to measure pressures 
and pressure differentials. The two rotameters used were Fischer 
and Porter Flowrators., Standard globe* plug-disc gate and needle 
valves were used for flow and on-off control. Copper tubing 
l/4 inch in diameter was used throughout for pressure connections. 
Orifices were supported in gasket type standard pipe unions. 

The control panel was built as a complete unit so that If 
necessary* it could be moved after disconnection of service lines. 

The changing specific gravities of the natural gas, 
off-gas and flue gas* made it necessary to measure their specific 
gravity periodically. The three sample lines were connected 
through valves to a common manifold on the control panel. From 














































































53 


the manifold a single line was connected to an Acme Gas Gravity 
Balance. A compressor was installed on the off-gas sample line 
to facilitate the collection of a sample for heat of combustion 
evaluation.

VI. EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM 

The experimental program was planned with a view 
of obtaining the following information: 

(1) the effects of the process variables 

(2) the optimum operating conditions, for several 
natural gas compositions, in relation to yields 
and desirable properties of the carbon black 
produced 

(5) design data - suitable materials for equipment 

construction 

- equipment capacities 

- heat requirements 

- special problems encountered 

- design recommendations 

The process variables may be listed as follows: 

(1) reactor tube temperature 

(2) retention time of the natural gas in the reactor 
tube (time of contact) 

(3) ratio of reaction gas rate to diffusion gas rate 

(4) reactor tube diameter 

(5) composition of natural gas feed 

The time of contact is a superficial characterization 
because the rate at which the natural gas is heated to the 
decomposition is unlikely to have much effect on the yield and 
properties of the carbon black. Since the natural gas is not 
heated to the decomposition temperature instantaneously upon 
entering the reactor tube, the same results should be obtainable

with a high tube temperature and a short time of contact as with 
a lower temperature and a longer contact time. 

The evaluation of the process required data on the 

following: 

(1) Effect of reactor tube temperature on yield, 
carbon black properties and the composition and 
heating value of the off-gas. 

(2) Effect of contact time on yield, carbon black 
properties, composition and heating value of the 
off-gas and reaction gas to diffusion gas ratio. 

(5) Effect of reactor tube diameter on the maximum 

reaction gas to diffusion gas ratio and heat load 
transmitting capacity. 

(4) Effect of varying reactor feed gas composition 
on yield, carbon black properties and off-gas 
heating value. 

The tube temperature was varied by adjusting the air 
to gas ratio and the feed rate of the fuel mixture. 

The time of contact depended upon the natural gas inlet 

rate and the reaction gas to diffusion gas rate ratio. 

To keep the heating value of the off-gas at a maximum 

a minimum dilution of the off-gas by diffusing flue gas was 

necessary. The minimum flue gas diffusion rate required to keep 
the carbon black from coating out on the wall of the tube was 
determinable only by trial and error. The best indication of the 
deposition of carbon black was a rise in tube temperature, all 
other conditions remaining constant. Oxidation reactions in

the reactor tube were kept to a minimum by maintaining the 
oxygen content of the flue gas as low as possible. 

The heat load transmitting capacity for each tube 
size was determinable only by trial and error. The many 
indeterminate factors involved, such as the effect of the hot 
diffusing flue gas, the thickness and properties of the tube 
surface gas film, the temperature of the natural gas undergoing 
endothermic reaction ahd the degree of radiation absorption of 
the reacting gas and carbon particles make it impossible to 
calculate heat transfer rates accurately. Most of the heat 
energy was transmitted by radiation from, the tube walls. 

The carbon black yield was determined by a material 
balance on the process. 

The evaluation of the properties of the carbon black 
samples as reinforcing agents in rubber was to be done by the 
Rubber Laboratory of the National Research Council at Ottawa. 
The Research Laboratory of the Columbian Carbon Company at 
Brooklyn, N.Y. was to do the dimensional evaluation of the 
carbon black samples. 

The composition of the gas supply to the reactor tube 
was to be varied by recycling part of the off-gas or by the 
addition of hydrogen. Dilution with hydrogen or recycled 
off-gas will have an effect on the carbon black particle size 
and other properties.

VII . EXPhiRl^-tiKTAL RliiSULTS AM' DISOli:-i;jIO!! 

No results were obtained in this investigation 
because each of the three available reactor tubes fractured 
after a few hours of heating. Several spare reactor tubes 
were ordered but did not arrive until seven months after the 
order was placed. Earlier, the construction of the furnace 
was held up because the burners and the proportional mixer 
were delivered three months after the promised date of delivery. 
As a result of these delays, no time was available for further 
tests. 

After some modification, the furnace operated smoothly 
and good control of reactor tube temperature and pressure and 
firechamber pressure was possible. A maximum reactor tube 
temperature, 1388° C, was obtained with a fuel mixture contain¬ 
ing about 1 0/o excess air. It Is probably possible to raise this 
temperature by the use of other air to gas ratios and by reduc¬ 
ing to a minimum the pyrometer port cooling air rate and the 
furnace jacket pressurizing air rate. 

The Leeds Northrup #8621 optical pyrometer was found 
to give fairly consistent temperature readings. Radiation 
absorption by the quartz windows of the pyrometer ports had 
negligible effect on the temperature readings. 

TLST NUMBER I . 

A 3 inch inside diameter reactor tube was installed 
in the furnace. The packing glands on the adaptor plates, 
through which the tube passed, were packed with slag wool insul¬ 
ating cement.

The furnace was lit and the temperature was brought 
up to 870° C in three hours using two burners. The other two 
burners were lit and the temperature was brought up to 1,090° C 
in two hours. To check the operation of the furnace at s higher 
chamber pressure, the butterfly valve on the flue gas line was 
partially closed to increase the firechamber pressure to 
10 inches of water. At this pressure it was found that the fuel- 
mixture did not burn evenly, resulting in an oscillation of 
firechamber pressure. The amplitude of this oscillation was 
about 8 inches of water at a mean firechamber pressure of 
10 inches of water. Soon after this oscillation started, an 
oscillation in reactor tube pressure was noticed. This indicated 
a fracture of the tube. The fracture was found to be at a point 
lying directly beneath the flue gas outlet of the furnace. At 
first, it was thought that a leak in flue gas quench unit had 
caused the fracture, but close investigation did not reveal any 
leaks. 

A test carried out on a section of the fractured 
tube showed the binder used in the construction of the tube, 
to be plastic at a temperature of 1,400° C. At this temperature 
the tube had little tensile and crushing strength. 

It Is believed that the fracture was caused by the 
tension exerted on the tube by the furnace jacket when the 
firechamber pressure was increased. The end panels of the 
furnace jacket were not rigid enough to prevent distortion 
with increasing pressure.

TEST NUMBER 2. 

The second reactor tube, also a 3 inch inside 
diameter tube, was mounted similarly to the first except that 
the packing was left out of the packing gland on the inlet side 
of the tube. This permitted the inlet end of the tube to slide 
freely through the adaptor plate when thermal expansion took 
place and when any distortion in the furnace jacket occurred. 

The furnace was heated to about 870° G in 4 hours 
using 2 burners and to 1,340° G in an additional 2 hours using 
4 burners. After heating the tube at this temperature for about 
2 hours, a fracture was noticed. Removal of the tube from the 
furnace revealed fractures at each end of the section in the 
firechamber. To test further the high temperature character¬ 
istics of the tube, it was reinstalled in the furnace. The 
outlet end was fixed to the furnace jacket by the packing in 
the adaptor plate packing gland and at the other end a turn- 
buckle and spring arrangement for applying a small compressive 
force on the tube, was installed. The furnace was heated slowly 
to 1,260° C and kept at this temperature for 3 hours. The 
furnace was allowed to cool slowly and the tube was removed. 

A large number of cracks 1 to 2 inches long running along the 
tube from each fracture was observed. During the heating of 
this tube a flow of air (about 400 cu. ft. per hr.) was main¬ 
tained through the tube to provide a heat load. The tube 
pressure was kept at 1 to 2 inches below that of the firechamber. 
It is thought that the longitudinal cracks were caused by the 
higher temperature at the fracture due to hot flue gas leakage

into the tube. 

The fractures occurring at the points of highest 
temperature gradient indicate the inability of the material 
from which the reactor tubes were made to withstand thermal 
shock. 

TEST NUMBER 5 . 

The third tube failed similarly to the second tube. 
This tube had an inside diameter of 2 inches and a wall thick¬ 
ness of l/2 inch. 

Great care was taken in the installation of this 
tube to insure that the inlet end of the tube was free to move. 
The preliminary heating of the furnace was carried out very 
slowly; the tube temperature reached 480° G in 4 hours, 

870° C in 12 hours end 1,390° C in 36 hours. 

The fracture in the tube was first noticed after the 
pressure of the air supply to the proportional mixer had dropped 
due to the switching off of one of the air supply compressors. 

In two hours the tube temperature had dropped from 1,590° C to 
about 1,040° G. The fracture occurred at a point 6 inches from 
the inlet end of the section in the firechamber. 

The tests carried out indicate that the reactor tubes 
manufactured from Norton Alundum mix number RA1139 are not 
resistant to thermal shock and are structurally weak at high 
temperatures. 

Before these tubes were ordered, inquiries were made 
to the Norton Company and they recommended the RA-1139 mixture 
for our particular application.

Recently enquiries were made to the Carborundum 
Company, another leading manufacturer of ceramic products. 

They stated that their aluminum oxide and silicon carbide 
permeable media would not withstand the high temperatures in¬ 
volved and had low resistance to thermal shock. They also 
stated that their regular silicon carbide refractory material 
would withstand the operating conditions but that this material 
had a low permeability; the diffusion rate was about 0.003 cu. 
ft. per min. per sq. ft. per inch of water differential. The 
aluminum oxide tubes used had a permeability such that the 
diffusion rate was about 0.5 cu. ft. per min. per sq. ft. per inch 
of water differential for a l/4 inch thick wall. These tubes 
probably could not be used because of the difficulties involved 
in obtaining a high enough pressure differential across the 
tube wall. However, tests may show that the surface effect of 
silicon carbide tubes on the thermal decomposition of a hydro¬ 
carbon gas is less than the surface effect of aluminum oxide 
tubes and therefore, a smaller diffusion rate would be necessary 
to prevent carbon black deposition on the tube wall.

VIII. GKNKKAL 'DISCUSSION 

The tests outlined in the previous section show that 
the permeable aluminum oxide tubes tested are unsuitable for 
high temperature work* The fracturing of the 2 inch inside 
diameter tube with a 1/2 inch wall suggests that heavy walled 
tubes may not be the answer to the problem. However, further 
tests should be carried out on tubes with heavier walls to 
provide a definite answer* It may be possible to use the avail¬ 
able aluminum oxide tubes with 1/4 and l/2 inch walls if a 
small compressive force is applied continuously on the tubes* 
This may be accomplished by fixing one end of the reactor tube 
and attaching springs between the other end and the furnace 
jacket. 

Permeable silicon carbide tubes, which are at present 
commercially available, will not withstand high temperatures 
and thermal shock. Dense silicon carbide tubes able to operate 
under these conditions do not have a high enough permeability 
for use in the Pidgeon Process. However, these tubes should be 
Investigated further. It is possible that the surface effect 
of silicon carbide on the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbon 
gases is much less than that of aluminum oxide. 

A continuous gas generator (17) developed by the 
Gas Machinery Go. of Cleveland, Ohio, makes use of impermeable 
silicon carbide tubes 28 feet long. The primary purpose in 
the development of the generator was the production of high 
purity hydrogen from the complete thermal decomposition of

hydrocarbon gases. The carbon black, produced as a by-product, 
was evaluated by carbon black producers and rubber companies 
who gave it a market value of per pound. No mention was 
made of the deposition of carbon black on the tube walls but 
apparently this problem was not serious. 

The calculations carried out in Appendix D show that 
by the use of heat exchange equipment and by keeping the 
dilution with inert gases to a minimum, the off-gas can supply 
the heat requirements of the process. In the hypothetical case 
chosen about 82 Btu are available from the off-gas produced by 
the decomposition of 60% of each cubic foot of entering methane. 
About 34 Btu at 1,400° G are required for the thermal 
decomposition of 60$ of each cubic foot of entering methane. 

Several other methods for the production of carbon 
black from natural gas which would provide good control of 
temperature and contact time are listed below. 

(1) A furnace in which compartments are separated 
by permeable refractory plates could be used. Heat for the 
thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons would be supplied by 
combustion in alternate compartments. Diffusion of hot flue 
gases through the permeable refractory plates from the combustion 
compartments to the reaction compartments would prevent the 
deposition of carbon black on the plates. A pressure different¬ 
ial across the plates would provide the driving force for 

gas diffusion. 

(2) Another method would involve the use of glow 
tubes to heat a decomposition reaction chamber. Combustion in

these permeable refractory tubes would supply the heat and the 
diffusion of flue gases through the walls of the tubes would 
prevent deposition of carbon black. 

(3) A variation of the furnace thermal process could 
also be used. This method would have the advantage of a 
constant reaction chamber temperature. The furnace would be 
compartmented by thin refractory walls. Combustion in alternate 
compartments would supply the heat requirements. The carbon 
black deposited in the reaction compartments would be burned 
periodically by the injection of air. 

This investigation of the Pidgeon Process on a 
pilot plant scale has not been carried out far enough for a 
definite conclusion to be reached regarding the feasibility 
of the process. 

Silicon carbide and heavy walled aluminum oxide tubes 
should be investigated. This work can be carried out at a 
reasonable cost with the present equipment.

EQUIPMENT DESIGN CALCULATIONS 


(l) Calculation of Heat Requirements 

The following calculation of the heat requirements 
for the 3 inch reactor tube is based on Chi sec. retention 
time, 60% decomposition, and a flue gas diffusion rate such 
that the ratio of inlet to diffusion volume is 0.6 for the 
1 inch diameter tube.

V F = 20 x 0.049

V n = 1.6 x 0.563 + 0.563 

1.13 

= 1.4 ft®/sec. & 1,4000 c 

The feed rate at 60° F is 353 cu. ft. per hour 
The heat of formation of methane is given by Parks (20) as 
AH = -15,450 - 11.IT * 0.0081T 2 - 0.0000012T 3 

where H = calories per gram mol 
T - temperature °K 

AH <§ 1,400° C = -16,960 calories per gram mol 

Converting to Btu per cu. ft. of methane <§ 60° F 
AH ~ -80.5 Btu per cu. ft. methane 

The heat required for 60/ decomposition at a contact time of 
0.1 seconds is 

353 x 0.6 x 80,5 = 17,070 Btu per hour (§ 1,400° C 
Heat is also required to preheat the incoming gas to the 
decomposition temperature. 

For the purpose of calculating approximate heat losses by 
conduction from the furnace, a cylindrical cross-section was 


assumed

Air film coefficient h = 0.86 Btu/(hr) (sq. ft.)°F (22) 

The resistance to heat transfer, of the sheet metal furnace 

case will be small and may be disregarded. 

The overall coefficient was calculated to be 0.162 

based on the logarithmic mean area of the cylinder (17.6 sq.ft.)

Approximate heat loss by conduction through brickwork 
is 13,040 Btu per hour. With an overdesign factor of over 3, 
the heat requirement will be approximately 100,000 Btu per hour.

OPERATING TECHNIQUE 

(1) Turn off all flow rate control valves on the instrument 
panel, 

(2) Turn on all service main valves. 

(3) Switch on flood warning system. 

(4) Turn on offset elbow jacket cooling water. 

(5) Open fully the gate valves on the fuel mixture lines to 
the burners on the pyrometer port side of the furnace. 

Close the valves on the fuel mixture lines to the other 
two burners. 

(6) Unscrew the lighting port plug on the pyrometer port side 
of the furnace and pull out the ceramic plug. 

(7) Turn on the furnace jacket pressurizing air and the 
pyrometer port cooling air to give differentials of about 
5 and 4 inches of mercury respectively. 

(8) Turn on the flue gas quench unit water spray. The differ¬ 
ential across the orifice should be about 20 cm. of carbon 
tetrochloride under water. 

(9) After making sure that the plug cock on the natural gas 
supply line to the proportional mixer is closed, open the 
air supply valve to the proportional mixer until a pressure 
differential across the orifice of about 4 cm. is obtained. 

(10) Open completely the mixture control needle valve on the 
proportional mixer.

(11) Insert the spark gap wand into the lighting port and switch 
on the induction coil. 

(12) Open the plug cock on the natural gas supply line to the 
proportional mixer. 

(13) If the furnace does not light within about 30 seconds, 
close the gas supply plug cock and allow the furnace to 
be purged with air before attempting to light up again. 

This procedure is necessary to prevent ignition of the 
large volume of explosive mixture in the furnace. 

(14) When the furnace is lit, adjust the flue gas ejector air 
supply to obtain a vacuum of about 2 inches of water in 
the furnace firechamber. 

(15) Replace the plugs in the lighting port. 

(16) Allow the furnace to warm up slowly up to 1,600° P over a 
period of 2 to 3 hours at the original settings and then 
adjust the fuel mixture to the proper proportions for 
stoichiometric combustion. 

(17) Turn on the reactor tube air purge until a scale reading 
of 2 is obtained on the flowrator. 

(IS) Allow the furnace to warm up for 6 to 8 hours and then 

turn on the other two burners one at a time. Adjust the 
air rate to the proportional mixer to obtain a differential 
of about 12 cm. of mercury. Adjust the mixture pressure 
at the burner heads to the same value by means of the gate 
valves on the manifolds. 

(19) Adjust the quench water rate to keep the quenched flue gas 
temperature at about 200° C.

(20) Adjust the offset elbow cooling jacket water rate so that 
the water comes out at about 200° F. 

(21) Adjust the pyrometer port cooling air rate to get a differ¬ 
ential of 6 inches of mercury* 

(22) Adjust the furnace jacket pressurizing air rate until the 
jacket pressure is just slightly above the firechamber 
pressure• 

(23) Vi/hen the operating temperature has been reached, turn off 
the reactor tube air purge and calibrate the reactor tube 
for diffusion rate vs* pressure differential across the 
tube wall using a 1/4 inch orifice installed in the off-gas 
exhaust line. Vary the pressure differential across the 
tube wall by adjusting the air supply to the flue gas and 
off-gas jet ejectors, 

(24) Flush out the natural gas supply surge tank by opening the 
purge line valve and running the compressor. 

(25) Close the purge line valve and let the pressure in the 
surge tank build up until the compressor is switched off 
by the pressure switch. The pressure switch should be 
set to maintain a pressure of 40 to 60 psi in the surge 
tank. 

(26) Purge the reactor tube and system with nitrogen to prevent 
the possibility of explosion when the natural gas is 
introduced. 

(27) Set the natural gas rate to the reactor tube at the required 
valve and adjust the firechamber and reactor tube pressures

by means of the jet ejectors until the required pressure 
differential is obtained. 

(28) Turn on the off-gas quench water if required. It was found 
that the off-gas was cooled sufficiently by heat losses in 
the quench unit making it necessary to use water spray. 

(29) Keep a constant check on reactor tube temperatures. A 
rase in temperature may indicate a coating out of the 
carbon black on the tube wall. If carbon black has coated 
out, purge the system with nitrogen and burn the carbon 
black by introducing air to the reactor tube. 

(30) Turn on the bag filter shaking mechanism intermittently 
to shake out the collected carbon black. 

(31) On completion of the run, remove the carbon black by taking 
off the blanking plate on the bottom of the conical 
storage section of the bag filter unit. 

An oscillation in the zero gas governor of the prop¬ 
ortional mixer may start under certain conditions. This can be 
stopped without shutting down the furnace by cutting down the 
air rate to the furnace until a differential of about 5 cm. is 
obtained and opening wide the mixture control needle valve on 
the proportional mixer. When the oscillation has stopped, 
increase the air rate and slowly adjust the mixture control 
needle valve until the proper air to gas ratio is obtained. 

The line filters on the quench water supply lines 
should be cleaned before each run.

APPENDIX C 


EQUIPMENT CONSTRUCTION PROBLEMS 

This section was included to acquaint the reader 
with some of the problems encountered in the design, con¬ 
struction and operation of the equipment and how these problems 
were solved. 

Special refractory shapes such as streamlining liners 
for the burner tunnels and angle bricks for supporting the dome 
of the furnace, were made from plastic firebrick. These special 
shapes appear to have stood up very well under high temperature 
service. Expansion joints were not employed in the brickwork 
but no serious cracks have developed so far. 

The silicon carbide plates used to prevent flame 
impingement on the reactor tube were mounted in slots milled 
in the brickwork. Space was provided for the expansion of the 
plates. The slots were milled in the bricks with a l/2 inch 
,, carbo-ioy tt masonry drill. 

The holes for the pyrometer ports were drilled through 
the brickwork, with a special cutter, after the construction of 
the dome. The cutter consisted of a 4 inch section of 1 inch 
diameter iron pipe with l/2 inch teeth cut into one end. The 
cutter was mounted on a l/2 inch diameter rod. The teeth on the 
cutter were case hardened in an acetylene atmosphere after 
heating to yellow heat. A jig made out of iron pipe was used 
in the drilling of the holes to make certain that the axis of 
the holes intersected the centerline of the reactor tube. Eefore

drilling with the cutter, l/4 inch guide holes were drilled, 
using the jig and a 1/4 inch "carboloy" masonry drill. 1 inch 
inside diameter alundum tubes were cemented into the brickwork 
to act as liners for the pyrometer ports. 

The furnace lighting ports were drilled and lined in 
a similar manner. 

Several methods, including a gas flame and a hot 
filament, were tried as a means of lighting the furnace. The 
use of an electric arc was the only successful method. 

A spark gap mounted on a length of l/4 inch pipe 
provided the arc. A piece of 14 gauge copper wire insulated 
with a length of porcelain thermocouple insulator running through 
the pipe provided the other electrode. High tension current 
was obtained from a Model T Ford ignition coil hooked up to a 
six-volt storage battery. 

The flue gas outlet of the furnace was made by 
chipping out a hole in the dome and lining it with a 12 inch 
length of alundum tube, having a 4 inch inside diameter and a 
l/2 inch wall thickness. The tube was cemented in so that it 
extended above the brickwork into the flue gas quench unit. The 
annular space between the tube and the walls of the well in the 
top of the steel furnace case was packed with slag wool insulat¬ 
ing cement. 

In the first firing of the furnace, overheating of 
the pyrometer port quartz window mountings and certain spots 
on the furnace case, was encountered. This was found to be due 


* 






.J- i i ;• .. 




' 










j ...• . :: ;"j 








- xiv - 

to leakage of hot flue gases into the space between the furnace 
case and the brickwork. Leaks in the steel furnace case and 
the above atmospheric pressure in the firechamber increased the 
leakage. This condition was remedied by continuously blowing 
compressed air into the furnace case to maintain the pressure 
in it above the firechamber pressure. 

Compressed air was also blown into the pyrometer 
ports just below the quartz window mountings to assist in keep¬ 
ing the quartz windows cool and clean. 

Preliminary heating runs with the furnace revealed 
uneven burning in the firechamber with a resulting oscillation 
in firechamber pressure. At the higher firechamber pressures, 
the pressure varied as much as 10 cm. of water. At the higher 
fuel rates, the pressure drop in the flue gas exhaust system 
prevented lowering of the firechamber pressure, making an 
evacuation system necessary. The jet ejectors described in the 
equipment design section and shown in Figure III, were built 
after considerable experimenting with throat diameters, wall 
to axis angles and jet nozzle position. The installation of 
these ejectors on both the flue gas and off-gas exhaust lines, 
made possible good control of firechamber and reactor tube 
pressures. The lower firechamber pressure eliminated most of 
the pressure oscillation. 

The danger of explosion of the fuel mixture in the 
cold furnace when starting up, made it necessary to prevent any 
leakage of natural gas into the firechamber. The proportional 
mixer does not operate properly at low air rates such as are 





- XV - 


encountered when turning on the air supply to the mixer. This 
made it necessary to cut off the gas supply until the air rate 
reached the proper value. A plug cock was installed in the gas 
supply line to permit rapid turning on of the gas supply. 

Under certain corriLtions an oscillation was set up 
in the diaphram of the zero gas governor of the proportional 
mixer, resulting in a continuously varying air to gas ratio 
and uneven burning. This condition was remedied by the instal¬ 
lation of a l/64 inch orifice in the l/4 inch diameter pressure 
feedback line between the throat of the proportional mixer 
venturi and the underside of the zero gas governor diaphram. 

The design of the manifold used to distribute the 
fuel mixture from the proportional mixer to the burners resulted 
in an uneven supply to the respective burners. Gate valves to 
adjust the fuel mixture pressure at the burner head were instal¬ 
led to equalize distribution. The burner head pressure was 
measured with a mercury manometer. 

The flue gas quench unit sump was drained through a 
3/4 inch pipe drainage system, having a hydraulic leg of 20 
inches. Preliminary tests showed the draining capacity to be 
too small because of air locks in the vertical leg. This was 
eliminated by running a l/4 inch pipe from the top^of the vertical 
leg back to the spray chamber at a point above the sump, A 
flood warning system (described in the design section and shown 
in Figure X) was thought necessary because any water draining 
into the firechamber would cause serious damage.

The original reactor tube was permeable along its 
entire length. Since diffusion of flue gases into the reactor 
tube was required only along the hot section in the firechamber, 
the tube was made impervious at each end by painting it with a 
sodium silicate solution. A 25 inch section was left permeable 
(See Figure V). 

The inlet end of the reactor tube was connected to 
the natural gas supply line by a length of rubber hose. This 
end remained cool enough to prevent scorching of the rubber. 

The outlet end of the reactor tube was cemented into a stainless 
steel collar connected to the off-gas quench unit by a special 
flange connection (See Figure XIII). 

A clearance of l/8 inch was provided between the 
brickwork in the ends of the furnace and the reactor tube to 
ensure free movement of the tube during thermal expansion. The 
joints between the reactor tube and the adapter plates of the 
furnace case were sealed by means of packing glands. The annular 
space formed by the reactor tube and a section of pipe brazed 
to the adaptor plate was packed with an insulating cement 
(slag wool). The packing was compressed by a follower held down 
by 4 studs. The packing at the inlet end was left loose to 
allow the tube to move freely during expansion. 

The Curtis compressor used to compress the gas supply 
to the reactor tube was of the type ordinarily used for 
compressing air. It was necessary to plug several holes in the 
head and base of the compressor to prevent gas leakage. To 
carry off any gas blown past the piston into the crankcase.

the crankcase was vented to the outside of the building through 
a l/4 inch pipe. 

A safety pressure relief valve installed on the gas 
supply surge tank was also vented to the outside. The surge tank 
was also provided with a blowdown line to the outside of the 
building so that gas in the tank at the completion of a run could 
be bled off. 

The compressor was of the splash lubrication type 
making an oil separator necessary to prevent contamination of 
the compressed gas by oil. An oil removal unit consisting of 
a 2 foot piece of 4 inch pipe, packed with 1/4 inch raschig rings, 
glass wool and granulated charcoal, was installed. Tests with 
this type of oil removal filter revealed that practically all 
the oil vapor was removed. 

The filter bags of the bag filter unit were shaken 
by the motion of the crank mounted on a shaft passing through 
the top of the filter housing. The top of a globe valve brazed 
to the filter housing acted as the bearing and seal for the 
shaft. The springs used to attach the bags to the arms of the 
spider, gave an extra snap to the shaking motion and relieved 
some of the strain on the bags. The springs were attached to 
bolts passing through the tops of the bags and two dished aluminum 
washers. The bottoms of the bags were attached by clamps to 
flanges welded to a fixed plate in the filter housing. 

Pressures not requiring continuous measurement were led 
through plug cocks to a common manifold connected to a manometer 
of the correct pressure range.

Continuous temperature readings of the quenched flue 
gas and the off-gas were obtained by installing thermocouple 
type aircraft engine cylinder temperature indicators. 

To measure accurately the pressure differential 
(a maximum of 3 inches of water) across the orifice in the 
off-gas exhaust line, a multiplying manometer was required. 

The use of an inclined water manometer would have necessitated 
its mounting on a separate panel. A vertical two fluid type of 
multiplying manometer was used. Airtight brass pots with an 
inside diameter of 3 inches were connected to the top of a mano¬ 
meter. The manometer tubing had an inside diameter of about 
0.13 inches. The two fluids used were water and toluene. A 
multiplication of .about 7.3 was obtained. The manometer was 
calibrated against an inclined water manometer. All orifices 
and rotameters were calibrated before installation. 

Originally a calibrated conductivity cell was to be 
used to measure the gas to air ratio in the fuel mixture, 
however, this method had to be abandoned in favor of direct 
measurement of the gas and air stream because of wide variations 
in the natural gas composition.

Mean specific heat (60 - 3000° P) for the flue gas is 
0*023 Btu/cu. ft.(°F) 

For 1 cu. ft. of methane entering the reactor tube, there are 
2.48 cu. ft. of off-gas and 3.43 cu. ft. of flue gas when the 
off-gas is burned with the volume of air required for 
stoichiometric combustion.

For 60% decomposition of 1 cu. ft. of methane into carbon and 
hydrogen at 1,400° C (2552° F) 34 Btu are required 
(See Appendix A-l). 

The theoretical heat available at 1,400° C from the volume of 
off-gas produced by the decomposition of 60% of 1 cu. ft. of 
methane (inlet gas/diffusion gas - 1.13) 

= 3.43 x 0.023 (3600 - 2552) 

= 82.7 Btu 

The theoretical flame temperature would not be reached in 
practice because part of the heat would be used up, in the 
decomposition of HgO and COq.
