CHAPTER 1 
THE PROBLEM 

Mathematics is basic to modern society. The working citizen must 
be quick and accurate in computation. It is desirable for him to under¬ 
stand problems, to analyze accurately, and to reason deductively and in¬ 
ductively in the field of mathematics. The cultured citizen requires a 
knowledge of mathematics to make him more fully aware of the contribution 
of mathematics to the development of modern society. The democratic 
citizen needs as extensive an appreciation as he can get of the work of 
his fellow citizens, not the least of whom are the mathematicians, the 
scientists, the engineers, and the accountants. Ideally every pupil is 
potentially a working, cultured, democratic citizen. 

All aids to the successful teaching of arithmetic are therefore im¬ 
portant. How often is a child’s slow progress in arithmetic based on lack 
of mathematical ability, and how often on specific weaknesses caused by 
failure to master particular topics in his earlier work? Any expedient 
which will assist a teacher in an attempt to determine the reason for a 
child’s inability to master his work is worthy of attention. A carefully 
prepared arithmetic survey test is one device which may be used to advantage 
in such an undertaking. Its worth is indicated in several ways. 

To begin with the general score obtained by pupils from a survey test 
gives the teacher some indication of each child’s strength or weakness in 
arithmetic. This knowledge is of particular value at the beginning of a 
term. At that time the class can be divided into two or more groups

according to their ability and development, and instruction adjusted 
to the specific needs of each group. By making this arrangement flex¬ 
ible each child can advance to the better group as soon as he reaches 
the required level of proficiency. 

A survey test is not properly a diagnostic test. However, if it is 
organized into suitable sub-divisions, the component scores that make up 
the total survey score have value for diagnosis and remedial work. They 
may indicate broad areas of weakness though it is not their function to 
locate specific difficulties. For that purpose a teacher should administer 
a diagnostic test to determine the specific weakness and then outline 
remedial work to overcome it. When this work is satisfactorily completed 
another form of the survey test should be administered as a measure of the 
effectiveness of the program. 

An equally important function of the survey test is to determine the 
need of preventive x^ork. If it reveals a persistent general weakness in 
an arithmetical process improvement should result if attention is directed 
to the grade or the area where the process is first taught. Where the 
difficulty appears in just one school it may be the result of careless 
teaching. Stress laid upon the initial teaching of the topic in question 
may lessen or even eliminate further failures in it. Should the same 
weakness be found in several schools other causes must be sought • Is the 
topic being taught too early in the grade system? Is it one whose diffi¬ 
culties which, though not apparent to the adult mind, still require re¬ 
cognition by the teacher? Or is it one whose inherent difficulty will 
prove a challenge to the alert teacher and research worker? In any event 
the survey test serves to concentrate the attention of the administrator

on processes needing investigation, 

A properly constructed survey test exhibits several essential fea¬ 
tures* From the standpoint of validity the test “must parallel the 
teaching of the subject” ^ and must be based upon the textbook or the 
textbooks used. It should separate the poor students from the good ones* 
Although the test should be adequate in its sampling of the subject it 
must include only the more important aspects of that subject* Skilled 
and experienced teachers should select the test items from those topics 
which not only “fit the main objectives of the course”^ but which have 
the “biggest residual social value”3 # The test questions should be 
written in ”clear, simple English”^ and be arranged in ascending order 
of difficulty so as to secure maximum pupil interest and effort* Finally 
an arithmetic test is of little value without well authenticated norms 
appropriate to the local situation. 

There are already a number of tests available for survey purposes. 
Why,, then, prepare another? Most of these tests possess certain weak¬ 
nesses which make them more or less unsuitable for evaluating progress 
in arithmetic in the Edmonton Public School system* One outstanding 
weakness is common. The norms of achievement which accompany the tests 
have not been established on the data secured from our local school 
population. Most tests have no sub-section designed for testing the 
pupil achievement in vocabulary and fundamental knowledge. Others focus 
attention solely upon computation. Many fail to give any data on the 
reliability and validity of the test. In a few of them inaccurate and 
misleading statements occur.

Because of the known defects in presently available tests it was thought 
advisable to prepare another survey test. It was hoped that this test, on 
the whole, might be prepared in a form which would be more suitable for use in 
the Edmonton schools than any of the current ones. Since it would be pre¬ 
pared by Edmonton teachers the questions selected would be based either upon 
the textbooks in current use here or upon the main topics as outlined in our 
course of studies. Norms obtained after the administration of the test to 
our local pupil population would be more accurate for rating pupil progress 
locally. 

The purpose of this study, then, has been to plan and prepare an arith¬ 
metic survey test for use in the Edmonton Public Schools from grade four 
through eight. This test is designed to contain the essential features, 
cited above, of an ideal survey test. At the same time it is a serious 
attempt to evaluate the understanding on the part of pupils of elements of 
arithmetical knowledge ^ since these elements are progressively being more 
widely accepted as legitimate outcome^of instruction.

There are eleven reputable survey tests in arithmetic widely used on 
the continent today. They are listed below. An evaluation could be made of

mainly to the special defects or limitations found in each.

Two defects are common to all these tests insofar as use in the Edmonton 
Public School System is concerned. Firstly, none of them has its items based 
directly on the Alberta courses in arithmetic. Secondly, the norms are not 
determined on the Edmonton school population. 

Regarding the Analytical Scales of Attainment W J. Osburn reports that 
the “authors seem to have largely avoided such genuine quantitative relations 
as may be found in ratios, proportions, and series. The test seems to be a 
measure of arithmetic information. Its validity for quantitative relation¬ 
ships seems very doubtful ...... 

... The Vocabulary tests are open to question“•6 

Reporting on this same test G. M. Wilson says that “the general conclusion 
must be that the coverage of fundamental processes is inadequate for the diagno¬ 
sis of difficulties and, therefore as a guide for teaching. The test can be 
used for only very general classification.“^ 

The Progress Tests in Arithmetic Processes and the Progress Tests in 
Problem Solving by Leo J. Brueckner are evidently designed to measure pupil 
attainment by months. Since the proposed test is to include only the more importan 
aspects of arithmetic neither of the above sets of tests can fulfill that 
requirement. 

In the Compass Purvey Tests there is careful grading for difficulty and 
careful distribution with respect to use of basic number facts. But Brownell 
suggests that “only the traditional outcomes of arithmetic instruction are 
measured and these imperfectly. That is to say, the emphasis is almost wholly 
upon computation*'. ^ There are few verbal problems. Neither has an attempt 
been made to “get at arithmetical meanings or at social significance which 
children attach to the number ideas and skills which they possess."^ There 
is no information on the reliability of the test nor on the procedures used in 
the validation of the items. Its values would be chiefly in "securing a rough

measure of attainment in computational skills only”, ^ 

According to the manual which accompanies the Dominion Tests , they were 
designed primarily to ”provide a reliable measure of achievement in arithmetic 
computation over a wide range of grades and ages”. ^ Thiele points out, how¬ 
ever, that the net result of focusing attention solely upon arithmetic comput¬ 
ation can have only one outcome, and that is to make arithmetic a mechanistic 

drill subject. He also says that there are dangers in making wide use of a 

12 

test in which arithmetic computation alone is measured. 

The Iowa Every-Pupil Test in Basic Arithmetic Skills and Basic Study Skills 
is ”a departure from the traditional type of measurement in arithmetic which is 
usually restricted to abstract computation and problem solving” .^-3 William 
Brownell finds that the vocabulary and fundamental knowledge section of the test 
”represents a serious attempt to evaluate the understanding of elements of arith¬ 
metical knowledge which are being steadily more widely accepted as outcomes of 
14 

instruction.” Although the items of the computation section are of the 

standard variety there appears to be one serious weakness in them. Undue stress 
has been put on denominate numbers. Seven out of eighteen questions in that 
section have been devoted to computation in this particular area. Although the 
manual accompanying this test is otherwise complete and helpful it lacks the 
data on the validity and the reliability of the tests. Leroy H. Schnell suggests 
that the test can serve excellent purposes when ”the advanced battery is extended 
in scope to sample more of the work of the upper grades and the inaccurate and 
misleading statements are corrected”. ^ 

Of the Metropolitan Achievement Tests Harry Grove Wheat says that they 
”give a measure of achievement in general .... They are useful in determining 


quickly but roughly the classification of a large group of pupils. In the case

of a small group of individual pupils, they do not reveal as much as the 
teacher can discover through careful observation. M ^ 

The arithmetic section of the Stanfo rd Achievement Test s has t wo 
parts, - arithmetic reasoning and arithmetic computation. No part of 
either battery is devoted to the testing of arithmetic vocabulary or funda¬ 
mental knowledge. Three questions of the arithmetic reasoning section of 
the test for the intermediate grades are repeated in the test for the 
advanced grades. This is a weakness if the tests are to be given in con¬ 
secutive years to a grade six and a grade seven class. There is no 
evidence that the items of the test are arranged in their order of diffi¬ 
culty. 

C. L. Thiele, reporting on the Progressive Achievement Tests says 
that the arithmetic tests of this battery n are wholly inadequate as measures 
of the principles and generalizations of arithmetic ..... In view of the 
sampling methods alone, it would be difficult to accept the tests as mea¬ 
sures which indicate the educational status of an arithmetic program, or 

to the extent to which both groups and individuals have mastered larger 

17 

topics and specific skills in arithmetic." ' 

As has already been suggested each test mentioned above has certain 
defects or limitations which make it unsuitable for extensive use in the 
Edmonton Schools. It was tho.ght advisable therefore to construct another 
test in which the objectionable features referred to would be eliminated. 
Then, too, the norms of achievement obtained from it would have real meaning 
for teachers and administrators using the test.

CHAPTER III 
FLAMING THE TEST 

This test was planned to embody the characteristics of a good survey- 
test discussed in the first chapter. Some other general considerations 
were regarded as being of prime importance. To make the test valid it was 
decided that the questions should be of sufficiently wide range to include 
work from grade four through grade eight and to cover the minimum require¬ 
ments of these grades in vocabulary work, computational skills and problem 
solving. To arrange the test items in ascending order of difficulty the 

method of scaling items which employs the sigma of the distribution as the 

18 

unit of 1 ’ measurement was used. The sigma units or sigma deviation scores 

were found by dividing the deviation of the score of each item from the 
mean by the standard deviation. These, then, constitute a means of measure¬ 
ment of item difficulty in terms of the variability of the group. This 
procedure was chosen as it has been shown that when the ability being 
measured is assumed to be normally distributed, sigmas rather than percen¬ 
tage differences are the better indices of differences of difficulty. ^9 
A second reason for its selection was that with the variability of the 
sample used as a scaling unit the test items can be spaced at definite 
points along a difficulty scale. For convenience in scaling by this method 
negative three times sigma was used as an arbitrary zero point from which 
performance could be measured. 

To facilitate administration it was decided to construct the test in 
alternative and comparable forms. Since this was primarily to be a survey, 
not a diagnostic test, the score would give a child’s general level of 
attainment in arithmetic. Diagnosis, however, would be possible to the 
degree to which the test is divided into components. 




- 10 - 


Most current tests have no section evaluating arithmetic vocabulary 
and fundamental knowledge. The first sub-section of this test was devoted 
to this Important phase of instruction. The remaining two sub-sections 
tested computation and problem work. Since the problem sub-section aimed 
at testing reasoning ability the problems offer the student little comput¬ 
ational difficulty. The number of items in each sub-test was limited to 
approximately thirty-five to permit the time of administration not to 
exceed thirty minutes. 

A committee of teachers was formed for the purpose of constructing 
the test and administering it in its preliminary stages. In preparation 
for this work they examined a chart organizing by topic and grade the 
subject matter required by the Alberta course of study. Each sub-test con¬ 
tained many items ranging in difficulty from very easy to very hard. These 
sub-tests were given to small samples averaging forty pupils. 

The percentage of pupils passing each item was computed. Those items 

which were answered, correctly by eighty-five per cent or more of the 

pupils were rejected as being too easy. Items which were answered correctly 

by fewer than fifteen per cent were eliminated as being too difficult. The 

eighty-five per cent and fifteen per cent limits were chosen because this 

20 

wide range of difficulty is the one recommended by test makers. 

The relative difficulty of the remaining test items was then calculated 
in terms of their distance from the mean in sigma values. These difficulty 
ratings were next converted to revised sigma values by reference to a scale 
which used the arbitrary zero as the reference point, and the items were 
then rearranged in order of difficulty.

As the test was to be prepared in alternative forms twice as many 
questions as were required for each sub-test were selected from the re¬ 
maining items. A consolidated test was made up of these in order to 
determine their difficulty rating after all grades had attempted to solve 
them. 

From the data secured in the consolidated test the relative difficulty 
of each item was calculated again in terms of the sigma distance from the 
mean and the distance from an arbitrary zero point. Items were then arranged 
in ascending order of difficulty in each of the two forms of the sub-tests. 

The completed survey test in its three sub-sections and in its two 
forms A and B was given next to a sample of Edmonton Public School pupils, 
this sample consisted of five hundred students chosen by using the method 
of random numbers. Four classrooms for each of the five grades and twenty- 
five pupils from each of these classrooms were selected. No pupils or 
classes taking part in any of the preliminary work were used in this sample. 
Form A. was administered towards the end of the ninth month. Each sub-test 
was given on three successive days. One week later Form B was administered 
to the same group of pupils. 

In the following chapter detailed results obtained from the adminis¬ 
tration of Form A only are given. The Form B results are not tabulated 
because they parallel closely those of Form A.

CHAPTER V 

EVALUATION OF THE TEST 

In a good survey test the increment in learning from grade to 
grade is assumed to be relatively constant. Therefore the median 
scores by grades obtained from either of the sub-tests or from the 
total achievement of the complete test should appear graphically in 
an approximately straight line. 

An attempt will now be made to evaluate the test with respect to 
the constancy of the increment in learning as indicated by the differ¬ 
ences between the median scores for successive grades. This evaluation 
will consider the data secured from the administration of Form A of 
the test and will deal with the three sub-tests and the test as a whole. 
Only the data concernin the whole test will be considered in the case 
of Form B. 

As the test was first administered towards the end of the ninth 
month of the school year each grade median is designated by a symbol 
to indicate this. The symbol lw9 is to be interpreted as the ninth 
month in the fourth grade. The other symbols are read in a similar 
manner. 

Table V tabulates by grades the median scores of each sub-test 
of Form A as well as the differences between these medians.

From this table we see that in the Vocabulary and Fundamentals sub- 
test the median difference between the grade iw9 and grade 5.9 results is 
5.U. A slightly larger difference is shown between the grade 5*9 and the 
grade 6.9 results where the difference is 7.2. There is a very definite 
drop from this figure at the grades 6.9 and 7.9 levels. The difference 
here is 2.2. A still further decline is shown between the grade 7*9 
and the grade 8.9 medians where the difference is 1.3. 

Figure 1 is a graph of the median scores by grades of each sub-test. 
The vertical axis indicates the score in questions correct. The hori¬ 
zontal axis shows the grades. For ease of comparison the graphs of 
the three sub-tests are constructed on the same sheet. The Graph of 
the Vocabulary and Fundamentals test is shown in red; that of the 
Computation test is in greeny the Problem test is pictured in blue.

For the grade 6.9 median on the Vocabulary and Fundamentals 
sub-test the graph shows a slight deviation upward from the expected 
median which may have resulted from the questions selected being 
relatively easy for the average grade 6.9 student. 

There is an indication that the items on this sub-test were not 
selective enough at the grade 7.9 level. Evidently there were an 
insufficient number of easy items of strictly grade seven difficulty 
to raise the median of the class to its proper level and yet be dis¬ 
criminative enough to prevent most of the grade six pupils from solving 
them. 

This appears to be true of the grade eight questions as well. 

There were too few easy items that grade 8.9 pupils could solve which 
were sufficiently difficult for the grade 7*9 pupils. 

The graph shows that the greatest deviation from linearity in the 
Vocabulary and Fundamentals sub-test of Form A was at the grade 7*9 
and 8.9 levels. 

Of the three sub-tests of Form A the greatest variation in in¬ 
crement from grade to grade is shown in computation. The median differ¬ 
ence between the grade U.9 and the grade 5*9 medians on this test is 
U.35. The difference between the grade 5*9 and the grade 6.9 medians 
is 13.5* This difference is slightly more than three times the differ¬ 
ence between the medians of the two previous grades. It is obviously 
too great a difference to approach linearity.

An abrupt change is noticed again between the grades 6.9 and 

7.9 medians. The grade 7.9 median drops to a point 0.1 below that 
of the grade 6.9 group. Although the difference of 2.8 between the 
grades 7.9 and 8.9 medians is considerably larger than the difference 
between the grades 6.9 and 7.9 medians it still is slightly low. 

Graphically the grade medians of this sub-test are shown in green 
in Figure 1. The extreme deviations of the grade 6.9 median would in¬ 
dicate that the questions selected on the computation sub-test are too 
easy for grade 6.9 students. Since the grade 8.9 median is slightly be¬ 
low what was expected it would seem that there are insufficient easy 
items of grade eight level chosen for this sub-test. Such wide diff¬ 
erences as noted in the computation sub-test no doubt have a definite 
effect on the total score and the median score of each grade. 

The problem test medians of Form A show fairly even differences 
between grades. There is a difference of 3.92 between the grade U.9 
and the grade 5.9 medians. A slight increase over this is shown 
between grade 5.9 and grade 6.9 groups as their median difference is 
U. 96 • There is a slight decrease in this to a difference of 2.01 
between the grades 6.9 and 7.9 medians. T’lie difference between the 
grade 7.9 and the 8.9 medians is 2.62. The data from this sub-test 
would indicate that a comparatively good selection of items for each 
grade was made for the problem sub-test. 

Figure 1 shows the graph of these medians charted in blue. The 
grade 6.9 median is slightly above while the grade 7.9 and the grade 

8.9 medians are slightly below what might be considered a ”best- 
fitting”line for the median scores of the Problem, sub-test.

No attempt has been made in this study to tabulate the data 
of each sub-test of Form B. Nevertheless a careful study of the 
data of "orm B revealed the same general weaknesses in it as are 
found in Form A. 

Table VI gives the medians and the median differences by grades 
of the composite scores for both forms of the test. The information 
as to Form A or Form B is listed under their respective headings.

The difference between the medians of the composite score of 
the grade lw9 and 5.9 groups on Form A is 1U.1. Between grade 5.9 
and grade 6.9 groups the difference is 2U.9* This difference is unduly 
large. There is a very definite drop to a difference of U• 7 between the 
grade 6.9 and the grade 7.9 medians and a slight rise to a difference of 
7.6 questions between grade 7.9 and grade 8.9 medians. 

Figure 2 shows this graphically with the Form A medians drawn in 
red. Since the median of the composite score of the grade 6.9 class 
is relatively high it is evident that the questions selected for this 
class on the three sub-tests were too easy. There is an indication 
from the medians of the grades 7.9 and 8.9 composite scores that the 
questions selected for these grades were too hard. 

A comparison of the median differences b 3 r grades of the composite 
scores in both Form A and Form B shows that considerable care was 
taken in equating the items for the alternate forms of the test. The 
difference between the median scores of grade U.9 and grade 5.9 groups 
is 1U.1 in Form A and 15.7 in Form B. The differences between the 
grades 5.9 and the grade 6.9 medians are 2lw9 and 23.5 Tor Form A and 
Form B respectively. At the grade six and seven levels the choice 
of questions is not quite so good since the difference between the me¬ 
dians of the grade 6.9 and 7.9 groups is U.7 Tor Form A and 1.5 Tor 
Form B. For the Grade 7.9 and the grade 8.9 medians a difTerence oT 
7.6 is indicated in Form A and one oT 9.8 in Form B. 

The graph in Figure 2 illustrates this Tact. Form B medians are 
shown in green. There is evidence that the two Terms are comparable 
in difTiculty. Only at the grade 7.9 level does there appear to be 
any appreciable divergence in the diTTiculty oT the questions selected. 
Even this is slight however as the diTTerence between the medians oT 
the composite scores is only a matter of 2.9 questions.

The over-all picture as given by the results obtained from the 
test suggests that the items it contained were not selective enough 
at the grades 6.9* 7.9 and 8.9 levels to insure a relatively constant 
increase in the differences between the median scores from grade to 
grade. There is evidence of a decided increase in the differences 
between the median scores at the grade 6.9 level and a definite 
falling off at both the grade 7.9 and the grade 8.9 levels. This 
fact is true of each of the sub-tests as well as the test as a whole. 
However the data does reveal the fact that questions on the alternate 
and comparable forms were carefully and accurately selected. 



CHAPTER VI 


PLANNING THE REVISION OF FORM A 

The results of both forms of the original test were unsatis¬ 
factory since linearity was not achieved when the various median scores 
were graphed. In the Vocabulary and Fundamentals sub-test of Form A 
the graph deviated from linearity at the grades 6.9, 7.9 and 8.9 levels. 
There was a wide deviation in the Computation test results of this form 
at the grade 6.9 level and a slight deviation at the grade 8.9 level. 

The deviation from linearity is least in the Problem sub-test of Form A 
with the grade 6.9 median slightly above and the grades 7.9 and 8.9 
medians slightly below the expected medians for these grades. In the 
graph of the composite score medians of this form of the test the deviation 
from the expected median is greatest at the grade 6.9 level with less 
deviation at the grade 7 *9 and 8.9 levels. As the results of Form B 
parallel closely those obtained in Form A they were not tabled nor graphed. 

Because of these unsatisfactory results it was decided to revise 
Form A of the test to get a more constant increment in achievement from 
grade to grade. 

The original data of each sub-test of Form A were then carefully 
studied and items which might have been responsible for the erratic 
behaviour of the different graphs deleted. Among the reasons for questions 
being discarded were the failure of a question to discriminate between 
grade levels, the possibility of a student guessing the correct answer 
either by the manipulation of numbers or by the chance offered by a 
multiple choice question, the fact that a question did not discriminate 
well or that it discriminated only fairly well and at the same time 
used an undue amount of space on the test paper, the possibility of a 
question being obsolete or impractical, and the awkwardness of putting 
a question on the test paper because it was accompanied by a rather 





- 27 - 


involved diagram. The items which had discriminated well between the diff¬ 
erent grades were retained* 

To replace the deleted problems others of approximately similar 
difficulty were needed. To secure such problems a supplementary test 
was prepared* 

Since the grades four and five results on the original test had 
proven fairly satisfactory it was felt that questions used on the supple¬ 
mentary test should be prepared for grades six, seven, and eight only. 

In the preparation of this supplementary test an attempt was made to 
keep the questions as strictly as possible to new material listed in the 
curriculum for grades seven and eight* By this procedure it was hoped 
that the grade six medians would be lowered and the grades seven and 
eight medians would be raised to a level that would show approximately 
equal increments between these three grade medians* 

This supplementary test was given to three hundred pupils, one 
hundred in each of grades six, seven and eight. The schools from which 
these pupils were chosen and the pupils whose marks were used in recording 
the data of the supplementary test were selected by the method of random 
numbers• 

The data secured from this test were critically reviewed. Then 
questions which discriminated most effectively between the pupils of grades 
six and seven and seven and eight were chosen from it* The selected 
questions were substituted for the ones previously deleted from the 
original test. This resulting test was called the Edmonton Survey Test 
in Arithmetic Form A, Revised* 

Table VII shows the grade attainment of each item that was deleted 
from Form A, Test 1, Vocabulary and Fundamentals. Column one indicated 
the rank of each question deleted. Column two shows the number of pupils 
from grade four that obtained the correct answer for each question in

column one. The succeeding columns give the results obtained in grades five, 
six, seven and eight respectively. The total number attempting each question 
is shown in the last row.

At this point a prediction was made of the median scores of each sub¬ 
test, and of the medians of the composite scores by grades of Form A of the 
revised test. The reason for doing this was to judge as nearly as possible 
the results that might be expected when the revised test was given to another 
sampling of pupils. If graphing the predicted median scores indicated that 
these scores had satisfactory linearity the test could be assumed to be in a 
form which would produce reliable results if applied to the entire school 
system. 

Accordingly the median of each sub-test was adjusted downward in 
proportion to the value of the questions deleted from the original test and 
upward according to the value of each question that was added from the 
supplementary test. The values of the questions deleted were determined from 
Table VII, Table IX, and Table XI while the values of those added were 
determined from Table VIII, Table X, and Table XII. To illustrate how the 
adjustments to the median scores were determined the median score of the 
grade 6.9 group on the Vocabulary and Fundamentals sub-test will be used. 

This score as read from Table V is 26.1. From Table VII the number of pupils 
at the grade 6.9 level getting question number eighteen right is 85. This 
is .85 of all the grade 6.9 group of pupils taking the test. Similarly the 
fraction of the grade 6.9 pupils who solved each of the questions in Table 
VII was computed. The sum of all these fractions is 5*57« As all these 
questions were deleted 5»57 was subtracted from 26.1 leaving a median of 
20.53. In table VIII the sum of all the fractions indicated under the 6.9 
group is .97. This is added to 20.53 to make a median of 21.50 which is the 
predicted median score for the grade 6.9 group as given in Table XIII.

The data of Table XIII shows the predicted median scores and 
median score differences of the three sub-tests of Form A, revised. Column 
one indicates the grade. Column two gives the predicted median of each 
grade on the Vocabulary and Fundamentals test. In column three are listed 
the differences between these medians. Column four and column six list the 
medians of the Computation test and the Problem test respectively. In 
column five and column seven are listed the median differences for the 
respective tests. The last row of the table shows the total number of 
questions on the new test. The total now stands at ninety-four questions 
instead of the original one hundred and five.

By observing the differences between the predicted median scores 
of the Vocabulary and Fundamentals test it is clearly seen that differences 
are relatively equal as they vary only from U.66 between the grade U.9 and 

5.9 groups to 2.12 between the grade 7*9 and 8.9 groups. 

There is not quite as much uniformity between the differences of 
the predicted median scores of the Computation test. At the grade 5.9 and 

6.9 level the difference is predicted as 6.92 which is a deviation upward. 

In the case of the Problem sub-test there is a decided return to uniformity. 
The differences here vary from 2.97 between the grade U.9 and grade 5.9 
levels to Ai.57 between the grade 5.9 and grade 6.9 levels. 

Figure 3 represents the results which were obtained when the 
amended test data were graphed.

Table XIV gives the predicted medians of the composite scores 
of Form A, revised and the differences between these medians. These medians 
were obtained for each grade by adding the median of each sub-test together. 
Their differences as listed under column three show a relatively constant 
difference between the respective grades.

a form which will indicate a relatively constant increment in learning 
from grade to grade.

CHAPTER VII 

FINAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE TEST 

When the revision of Form A of the test was completed it was mimeo¬ 
graphed in the final form and given to another sample of five hundred 
pupils towards the end of the fourth month of the school year. This 
sample was chosen in the same way as the first and consisted of one 
hundred pupils from each of the five grades selected by the method of 
random numbers. 

Tables XV to XVII give the pupil attainment on the revised test 
Form A. Note that the number of questions on the Vocabulary and Fundamentals 
test and the Computation test total thirty-four for each test while those 
for the Problem test total twenty-six. These tables are to be read in the 
same manner as Tables I to III.

CHAPTER VIII. 

EVALUATION OF THE DATA RESULTING FROM THE 
FINAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE TEST. 

Table XIX shows that in the Vocabulary and Fundamentals 
sub-test the median differences between the grade 4*4 and the grade 
5*4 results is 3*85. The median difference between grade 5*4 and 
grade 6*4 groups is 3*75* Between grades 6.4 and 7.4 levels the 
difference is 3.78 while that between grades 7.4 and 8.4 results is 
3.40. These differences are approximately the same.

Results obtained in the Computation sub-test are a decided 
improvement over those received from the original test. The difference 
between the grade IwU and the grade 5-U results is 3*78. Between grade 
5.1l and grade 6 .U levels the difference is 5.06. This difference is the 
largest of any in this sub-test. Between the grades 6 J 4 . and 7*h levels 
and grades 7.U and 8 J 4 . results the differences are It. 23 and U.50 respect¬ 
ively. These figures are evidence that the Computation sub-test now 
shows uniform increments in achievement at successive grade levels. 

Of the three sub-tests the results from the Problem section are 
least satisfactory. The difference of 1.92 between the grade h*k and 5.U 
levels is the least. The 3.52 difference between the grade 5*U and 6.1* 
results approximates that of 3*53 between the grades 6 .It and 7*lt groups. 
Between the grade 7*It and 8 .It results a difference of 6.07 is noted. 

The graph of Figure 5 illustrates these facts* Note that since 
the revised test of Form A was given late in the fourth month of the 
school year the median results on this graph have been plotted at the 
fourth month levels. The revision for the Vocabulary and Fundamentals 
sub-test appears to be entirely satisfactory. An adjustment in Hie 
Computation sub-test might be made at the grade six level to lower the 
median results slightly. In the Problem sub-test it is evident that too 
many difficult problems have been retained at the grades five 9 six ^ and 
seven levels as the graph is depressed at these points.

From Table XX we observe that the differences between the medians 
of the total scores are relatively equal. Between the grade four and the 
grade five medians the difference is 9.30. The difference between 
the grade five and the grade six medians is 12*65 while that between 
grade six and grade seven is 12*12 and between grades seven and eight 
is 13*97* The greatest variation in these differences is shown at the 
grade four and five levels. The last three differences show a very 
close approximation to each other.

This fact is borne out when the graph of Figure 6 is studied. 

It is evident that although the graph is depressed slightly at the grade 
five, six, and seven levels, there is a decided improvement in its 
linearity as compared with the graph of the medians of the total scores 
of the original test.

CHAPTER IX 
NORMS 

1. GRADS SCORE NORMS 

The two sets of norms which seem most widely used for expressing 
pupil achievement on survey tests are the grade score norms and the percen¬ 
tile norms. 

The grade score norm indicates achievement in terms of the rate of 
progress through the grades of the average child. For example, if a pupil*s 
raw score shows a grade score of 6.8 it means that this child obtained a 
score that the average child would get if he had been in grade six for eight 
months. 

As the grade score norms may also be charted for each sub-test, they 
are useful for diagnostic purposes. If a child is below the average grade 
attainment in one of the sub-tests he may be given remedial treatment in an 
effort to overcome his weaknesses and deficiencies in the indicated area. 

Since the test was administered to the sample of five hundred at the 
end of the fourth month five absolute positions at which to fix the grade 
norms were secured. To obtain grade norms between these absolute scores 
two methods were used. By a process of interpolation in terms of equal 
monthly increments the grade scores between the fixed points at the 1*.U, 

5*U, 6.U, 7.U, and 8.U levels were computed. Through examination of the ten¬ 
dency of the data and employment of extrapolation the grade scores were 
extended to 3.0 and 9.0. Assuming linearity by a M best-fitting** line for 
the median scores of each sub-test and for the medians of the composite 
scores the grade norms were also obtained from a graph. The intervening 
scores between the luU and 8.U medians were read directly from the graph. 
Beyond these scores they were extrapolated to the 3.0 and 8.10 or 9.0

scores. No scores are shown beyond the 3*0 and 9«0 terminals. A score 
below the 3»0 level is meaningless in so far as this test is concerned 
because the work below that level is too elementary for our consideration. 
Past the 9*0 point the content continuum is broken due to the work in 
mathematics in grade nine being concerned chiefly with algebra and geometry. 

Figure 7 and Figure 8 are the graphs showing the "best-fitting” lines 
for the median scores of the sub-tests and for the medians of the composite 
scores respectively. 

Table XXI lists the raw scores and their grade score equivalents on 
the three sub-tests. Table XXII gives the composite raw scores with their 


grade score equivalents

2. GRADE PERCENTILE NORMS 


The percentile scores permit the teacher to determine a pupil*s 
relative position with respect to the position of all other pupils in a 
particular grade. If, for example, a pupil makes a test score which 
exceeds precisely seventy-five per cent of the scores of his class, he is 
said to have a percentile rank of seventy-five in that test. 

Percentile scores are also useful for dividing a class simply and 
easily into two, three or more groups for the express purpose of doing 
special or remedial work. If it were desired to divide the pupils into 
three groups, a convenient method would be to find the 33rd percentile 
score and the 6?th percentile score. Into the lowest group would go all 
those whose scores were less than the 33rd percentile score, into the top 
group all those whose scores exceeded that of the 67th percentile score, 
and the remaining pupils would be left in the middle group. 

Another use of percentile ranking of pupils is in the letter rating 
for report card purposes. If it is desired to give a five-letter rating, 
such as H, A, B, C, and D, to pupils on the basis of scores in a test, 
this may be done by giving those pupils who exceeded the 90th percentile 
score a letter rating of H, those whose score fall between the 70 and 90 
percentiles a rating of A, those in the middle forty per cent with scores 
lying between the 30 and 70 percentile a rating of B, and so on as shown 
in Table XXIII which is based on current practice in the Edmonton Public 
School system.

As with the grade norms the percentile norms were based on the 
administration of the test to a sample of five hundred children in grades 
four to eight at the end of the fourth month. Teachers must be advised 
that percentile norms will indicate a lower standing if the test is 
administered earlier in the year, and will show a higher ranking if the 
test is administered later in the year. For this reason the grade score 
norms are perhaps more valuable for general use. It must be remembered 
that percentile norms are completely valid only for the time in the school 

year at which they were computed . 

Table XXIV shows the percentiles by grades of the composite scores. 
These percentiles are based on one hundred pupils in each grade group.

CHAPTER X 

THE RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY 
OF FORM A, REVISED. 

21 

The reliability of a test depends upon the consistency with which it 
measures what it is supposed to measure. A perfectly reliable test would give 
nearly the same results every time it was given. Although this ideal is often 
approached it is very seldom completely achieved not especially because the test 
falls short of perfection? tut because of the variations in the pupils measured 
and the variations in the methods of test administration. A reliable test is 
comparatively free from chance errors of measurement, and scores obtained on 
it are relatively invariable and dependable. If a pupil makes a score of 65 
on a reliable test we feel certain that this score shows very closely what his 
true ability is. If he made the same score on an unreliable test it would be 
neither invariable nor dependable because it would be subject to large errors 
of measurement. Subsequent testings of an unreliable test would produce re¬ 
sults which would reveal many discrepancies between scores obtained by the 
same pupils on different occasions. 

Four procedures are widely used for determining test reliability. These 
are the test re-test, the equivalent forms, the split^half, and the "rational 
equivalence" methods. Fairly dependable estimates of the reliability of test 
scores may be obtained by making use of any of these procedures. 

The test re-test method is the simplest one for determining the reliabil¬ 
ity of scores since the test is given and then repeated on the same group of 
pupils. A correlation between the two sets of scores obtained is calculated 
and the reliability is thus established. As no re-test was given on the Revised 
Test, Form A, this method of checking its reliability was not possible. 

The equivalent forms method involves computation of a correlation bet¬ 
ween parallel or alternate forms of a test. This procedure establishes a meas¬ 
ure of the self-correlation of the test and can be used on tests for which

- 61 - 


alternate forms are available. As Form B was not revised the use of this 
method for determining the reliability of Form A was impossible. 

Although the split-half method is generally regarded as the best one 
for estimating test reliability it could not be used for this administ¬ 
ration of the test. At the time of the testing no record was made which 
would give the proportion of the group answering each test item either 
correctly or incorrectly. 

s Since the Revised Test, Form A, is a composite of the original Form A 
together with items drawn from the supplementary test it was more practic¬ 
able to employ the ’’rational equivalence” method for estimating reliability. 
This seems justified on theoretical grounds^ as this method always tends 
to underestimate the reliability coefficient. For this estimation Froe- 
lich’s^ simple adaptation of the ’’rational equivalence” formula was used. 

« reads: no^ - M(n-M) 

r= 

<T (n-1) 


in which: 

r * reliability of the whole test; 

n » number of items in the test; 

era standard deviation of the test scores; 

M = the mean of the test scores. 

Data were available which made it possible for substitutions to be 
made in the above formula. These data were: 

n = 9h items. 

5= 16.9 
M = U0.81 

The reliability coefficient of the whole test as determined by the above 
formula is .95. Even though this formula gives a satisfactory estimate of 
the test’s reliability it underestimates to a slight degree that which would 





' 








• . . 






- 62 - 


be obtained if the split-half technique were used. This figure is to be 
considered as one of interim value only. In a later revision of the test 
it is hoped that the estimate of reliability will be computed by more 
searching methods. 


VALIDITY 

The validity of a test is defined "as that aspect of a test which 
insures that it will actually measure what it claims to measure." 2 ^ 

Validity is an important function of a good test for unless a test is valid 
it serves no useful purpose. A test must be valid for the purpose for which 
it is to be used. The Edmonton Arithmetic Survey Test is designed to 
assist teachers in determining whether a child is strong or weakln the 
subject, to indicate broad areas of weakness in order that specific dif¬ 
ficulties may later be located by diagnostic testing, and to concentrate 
the attention of the teacher on processes needing investigation. 

Before discussing the validity of this test it is first advisable 
to make a distinction between logical or content validity and statistical 
validity. A test is said to possess high content validity when each item 
in it has been drawn from unquestionably important material in the subject 
field. A test is said to possess high statistical validity when it dif¬ 
ferentiates to a high degree between those who know more and those who 
know less. In other words, a valid test will arrange the students in order 
of their knowledge of the subject. The content validity of a test is 
determined by the selection of questions, but the statistical validity can 
be discovered only from the data obtained by trying out the test. 

Long and Sandiford 2 ^ offer the following suggestions for safeguarding 
the validity of a test. 

1. The examination should be designed to measure a specific ability. 

2. The examination should be based upon the curriculum which the 
teachers have been following. The curriculum is considered to be 





. 

■ 














. 
























. 


* 

. 

. 











































. 







. 

. 









- 63 - 

a very fair common ground, Tor each teacher is supposed to have 
covered the course therein specified. 

3. The examination should be based upon the text books the pupils 
are supposed to have studied. 

ll. The examination should be a fair sampling of the subject. The fair¬ 
est example is one that covers the entire course. Objective tests 
are able to provide a more adequate sampling than that obtained 
by essay-type tests. 

5* The examination should be limited to the more important aspects 
of the subject. This selection is not an easy one and some of 
the ways in which it is attempted are: 

(a) a consensus of opinion from experienced teachers; 

(b) a study of old examination papers on the subject will pro¬ 
vide a list of important topics; 

(c) topics should fit the main objectives of the course; 

(d) important topics are those which have the greatest residual 
social values. Topics which prove their worth in the after¬ 
life of the individual are more important than those which 
are never used. 

6. The examination questions should be worded in clear, simple 
English, ambiguity of statement and faulty sentence structure 
should be avoided. 

7. The examination should be designed to encourage the pupil to 
do his best. The highest validity is secured by a steady per¬ 
formance on the part of the pupil. The steadiest performance 
is probably obtained when the pupil is working at his maximum 
capacity. Arrangement of the questions in order of increasing 
difficulty is perhaps the best method of securing the pupil 1 s 


interest and effort.

The Revised Test, Form A, possesses high content validity for the purposes 
mentioned above as it parallels the teaching of arithmetic for the grades tested 
and is based upon the textbooks in current use in the Edmonton schools. The 
items of sub-tests are a fair sampling of the subject matter and are limited to 
the more important aspects of arithmetic. They are written in clear and simple 
English without ambiguity of statement or faulty sentence structure. To encour¬ 
age maximum pupil interest the items are arranged in ascending order of difficulty. 
For class ratings well authenticated norms appropriate to the local situation are 
provided. 

In order to understand the full significance of a test score it is necessary 
to know what performance the score predicts and how well it predicts that perform¬ 
ance. This can be determined adequately only after an administration of the test 
and a statistical analysis of the results. 

The usual method of obtaining the statistical validity of a test is by the 
comparison of its results with those of an acknowledged independent criterion. 

A criterion is an objective measure in terms of which the value of the test is 
estimated or judged. The comparison is made by finding the coefficient of correl¬ 
ation between the two series of marks obtained when the test results and the criteric 
results are secured from the same group of subjects. A high correlation between 
a test and a criterion is evidence of validity provided the test and the criterion 
are both reliable. But before accepting criterion correlations, we must know the 
reliability of the test and if possible the reliability of the criterion. Common¬ 
ly used criteria against which to rate the test are school marks in the subject, 
average school marks, teachers’ estimate of pupil ability and another established 
test. 

The project of computing the statistical validity of the Revised Test, Form 
A, was not undertaken. No reliable criterion with which to judge the value of the 
test was immediately available. It is hoped that in a later revision of the test 
it may be validated against an acknowledged independent criterion.

CHAPTER XI 

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

I. Conclusions Concerning Forms A and B 

1* The revised Form A of the Arithmetic Survey Test appears to be 
ready for use in the Edmonton School System. It has been demonstrated to 
test adequately the continuum of arithmetical knowledge in three major areas* 

2. Plans should be made by the Director of Elementary Education for 
the organization of data resulting from the periodic use of the test with 
a view to continuing evaluation of its efficiency and in preparation for 
further revision. 

3. While the writer feels that the test will function satisfactorily 
in its present form, there is some basis for the belief that in the Com¬ 
putation sub-test the grade six level of difficulty is slightly lower than 
it should be and that the Problems test is somewhat hard at the grade five, 
six, and seven levels. These should be singled out for special study, as 
test data accumulate. 

U. Since Form B was not revised it is not suitable for testing pur¬ 
poses. To prepare Form B for use a supplementary test must be administered 
to a properly chosen random sample and be of sufficient size to furnish an 
adequate number of items of suitable difficulty. 

5. When Form B has been completed, following the procedure estab¬ 
lished in Form A, it should be administered to a properly chosen random 
sample selected from the grades concerned. It must be further revised 
until the forms are so equated that the same norms may be employed. 

II. Recommendations for Committees Attempting Construction of 

Tests in Other Areas 

1. The committee charged with the preparation of the test should be 
adequate in size and be composed of members possessing sound basic training

.

in statistics. In future ventures of this kind more effort should be made 
to distribute the responsibility in such a way that the directing committee 
will be free to concentrate upon problems of procedure. 

2. The classroom teachers in the school system should be advised 
well in advance concerning the nature of the test, its value to the teaching 
staff, and the cooperation which is required from them. 

3. The preliminary work of creating items should be given greater 
emphasis. It is highly desirable that the original pool of items should 
be approximately double the number required in the two final forms of the 
test. It will prove economical if those preparing items give greater 
thought to achieving a wider range of difficulty as items otherwise tend 
towards the mean. In the present study the author would have saved much 
time and work had the preliminary pool of items been adequate in number 
and quality.

MANUAL OF DIRECTIONS TO ACCOMPANY THE EDMONTON ARITHMETIC SURVEY TEST 


Preparation of the Test . 

Since 19U9 a committee of Edmonton teachers, in cooperation with 
the administration, have been engaged in the preparation of an arith¬ 
metic survey test for use in the Edmonton Public Schools. 

Revisions were made during the time when the test was used in 
mimeographed form. Medians, grade scores and percentile norms were 
calculated on the basis of results secured from a random sample of 
100 pupils from each of the five grades for which it was designed. 
Printed forms of the test will be available henceforth to all teachers 
in grades four to eight. 

Purpose of the Test. 


The Edmonton Arithmetic Survey Test was carefully constructed to 

serve several purposes: 

1. The test is designed to assist the teacher to determine whether 
a child is weak or strong in arithmetic. 

2. The test is diagnostic in a broad sense only. If a Yfeakness is 
indicated in one of the sub-tests specific difficulties may be lo¬ 
cated when a complete program of diagnostic testing is undertaken. 

3. The test is useful in determining the need for preventive work. 

It may direct attention to the grade or area where a persistent 
general y/eakness in arithmetical processes occurs. 

k. The test is standardized for the Edmonton Public School system. 

The teacher is thus able to tell where her class stands with reference 
to other classes in the city. 

5. The test provides the pupils with a motive for better work. 

Nat ure of the Test . 

The items in each sub-test are arranged in ascending order of 

difficulty. By this arrangement each child is permitted to work up 

to his level of ability. 

Test 1. Vocabulary and Fundamentals. This sub-test contains thirty- 
four questions. Many of them are of the multiple choice type. 

Test 2. Computation. There are thirty-four questions in this sub¬ 
test which covers basic computational work for the grades concerned. 

Test 3. problems. The Problems sub-test has twenty-six items. As the 
emphasis is intended to be on thought processes the numbers used 
have been kept small purposely.

Reliability 


The reliability of the Edmonton Arithmetic Survey Test was 
estimated by Froelich’s simple adaptation of the "rational equiva¬ 
lence" formula. Although this formula underestimates the reliability 
as determined by the split-half technique it does give a satisfactory 
estimate. The reliability coefficient was calculated to be .95>. 

Validity 


The Edmonton Arithmetic Survey Test possesses a high degree 
of content validity. The items it contains parallel the teaching of 
arithmetic for the grades tested and are a fair sampling of the sub¬ 
ject-matter that is outlined for each. To encourage maximum pupil 
interest items found in each of the sub-tests are arranged in ascend¬ 
ing order of difficulty. Well authenticated norms appropriate to the 
local situation are provided. 

As no reliable criterion with which the judge the value of the 
test was immediately available no attempt was made to compute the 
statistical validity of the test. It is hoped that in a later revision 
of the test it may be validated against an acknowledged independent 
criterion. 

Administration of the Test 
I, When to Administer 


The time for giving the test is left to the discretion of the 
teachers since circumstances vary considerably from class to class. 

If teachers vd.sh to use the results along with other information for a 
mid-term report or classification, towards the end of the fourth month 
seems a good time to give the test. Diagnostic work may be done early 
in the term should the test reveal broad areas that are weak. If a 
general picture of achievement on the year’s work is desired probably 
the best time to give the test would be toward the end of the ninth 
month when the year’s work is completed, 

II. How to Administer 


A. Instruction to Teachers. 

In general, observation of the ordinary precautions which 
apply to tests of this nature will be sufficient. The following 
special instructions should be noted: 

1, Each sub-test requires about thirty to thirty-five minutes 
to complete. Arrangements should be made to give Test 1 at 
one sitting. Test 2 at another sitting on the following day, 
and Test 3 at a final sitting on the third day. 

2. Since these tests are designed as ’power’ tests no parti¬ 
cular time limits have been set for them. Permit the class 
to work for a reasonable length of time or until or more 
of the pupils have finished. Give NO help to the pupils once 
they begin the test.

3. Pupils are to -write their answers directly on the test 
papers. Calculation and rough work should also be done on 
the test papers in the space provided but scratch pads should 
be available for those who need them. 

B. Instructions to Pupils. 

The teacher should read the following sets of instructions to 
the pupils just before they give each sub-test, 

1. For Test 1. - Vocabulary and Fundamentals, say, u We are 
now going to have an arithmetic test. We want to see how 
well you know the meanings of words and principles in arith¬ 
metic. Many of the questions in this test are followed by 
four possible answers. Only one of these answers is correct. 
Put the answer you think is correct in the space at the right 
of the page. Do as many as you can. Work carefully but do not 
waste time, M 

2. For Test 2. - Computation, sa3?-, j, In this arithmetic test we 
have some questions we want you to do. They are easy at first 
and gradually get harder, When I tell you to begin I want 

you to begin with the first question, go on to the next and so 
on until you can do no more. You are not timed but the test 
mil stop when most of* the class have finished. Reduce all 
fractions to their simplest form. Put your answers in the 
proper place at the right of the page.” 

3. For Test 3« - Problems, say, ,r We are now going to see how 
well we can solve problems in arithmetic. Read carefulljr each 
one before you attempt to find the answer. Then place your 
answer in the proper place at the right. Be sure to reduce 
all fractions to their simplest form. As the questions are 
arranged from very easy to very hard begin at the first ques¬ 
tion, go right on to the next and so on until you can do no 
more. Work quickly but carefully. 


Directions for Scoring . 

Scoring keys are provided in the manual. 

1. No credit is deducted if dollar, cent or denominate number signs 
are omitted but decimal signs must be correct^ placed. Fractions 
must be expressed in lowest terms, except in division questions. 

2. Give one point credit for each answer in all sections of the test. 
The possible score for Test 1 is 3k, for Test 2 is 3k and for Test 
3 is 26. The total possible score is Rii. 

3. Pupils may help the teacher mark the papers from grade five up but 
the papers should be carefully checked to insure accuracy of results. 

1*. After the papers are marked the results should be entered in the 
spaces provided in the SCORE SUMMARY. The profile graph of GRADE 
EQUIVALENT should then be completed.

Interpretation of Results. 


Results secured from a random sample of 100 pupils from each 
grade of four through eight of the Edmonton Public Schools were used 
to compile the tables of medians, grade norms and percentile norms 
appearing in the manual. These results were obtained toward the end 
of the fourth month. 

1. Table of Medians . By consulting the table of median results for 
a particular grade the teacher is able to compare the achievement 
of her class with the achievement of the total population for her 
grade in each sub-section as well as in the composite scores. 

2. Table of percentiles . The median results give the teacher an es¬ 
timate of the "average" achievement of pupils in the system as a 
whole. The percentile tables provide additional information. 

From them the teacher can determine a pupil’s r elative position 
with respect to all other pupils for a particular grade. 

Percentiles are not to be confused with percentages. A percen¬ 
tile ranking of 75 on a given test indicates that a pupil’s score 
exceeds 75 per cent of the scores of all pupils taking that test. 
However this percentile rank of 75 does not mean that the pupils 
had 75$ of the questions on the test correct. Such a rank, there¬ 
fore, cannot b e u sed as a percentage mark in the usual way. 

3. Grading of pupils . Teachers may wish to use the results of these 
tests along with other evidence as a means of grading their pupils. 
In that connection, it is suggested that the following formula be 
used with the table of percentiles for each grade.

It. T able of Grade Norms . The table of grade norms was calculated on 
the data received when 100 pupils from each of the five grades 
took the test at the end of the fourth month. 

The grade score norm indicates achievement in terms of the rate 
of progress through the grades of the average child. For example, 
if a pupil’s raw score shows a grade score of 6.8 it means that this 
child obtained a score that the average child would get if he had 
been in grade six for eight months. The grade norms help the teacher 
to locate broad areas of weakness. Specific difficulties of indivi¬ 
dual pupils may later be located by diagnostic testing. 

5 • H ow to Draw a Profile Graph . 

After all information is recorded in the score summary, it can 
easily be interpreted by drawing a profile graph. A dot is placed 
on each of the horizontal lines at the point which indicates the 
particular grade score for each sub-test or for the total score. The 
position of these dots may be measured or estimated from the grade 
equivalent scale at the top of the chart. A vertical line is then

drawn to indicate the standard or norm against which the pupil's 
scores are to be interpreted. The usual standard would be the 
normal grade standard, representing the median of achievement of 
pupils at the same point in the grade in which the tested pupil 
is now enrolled. For example, if a pupil took the survey test 
upon entrance to the sixth grade, the vertical line would be 
drawn at 6.0 in the grade scale. If he took the test after having 
been in the grade five months, the vertical line would be drawn at 
a point halfway between 6.0 and 7*0. 

The accompanying illustration shows a sample profile of a 
pupil in the sixth grade. The vertical line is drawn at 6.5 indi¬ 
cating that the pupil took the tests in the middle of the sixth 
grade.
