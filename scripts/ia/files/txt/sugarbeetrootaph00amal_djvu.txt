ABSTRACT 


Information is presented on synonymy, distribution, 
economic importance, life history, habits, and control 
of Pemphigus betae Doane in southern Alberta, Galls 
formed by P^ betae and by three other species of aphids 
that infest poplars in. Alberta are described. Preliminary 
information is given on the influence of soil type, soil 
temperature, and varietal differences. The effect of sugar, 
nitrogen, and moisture content of the sugar beet on the 
sugar beet root aphid infestation is also discussed. The 
spring migrant form of P^ b etae is important because it 
initiates the apterous summer infestation that does the 
damage to the sugar beet crop. Some of the apterous adults 
that are present on the beet during the summer overwinter 
in the soil in the beet fields, but they can be controlled 
by thorough fall or spring cultivation. Two species of 
Diptera, a chloropid and a syrphid, were found to be 
important in the reduction of the JP. betae population in 
Alberta,

THE SUGAR BEET ROOT APHIS , 
PEMPHIGUS BETAE DOME, IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA 

INTRODUCTION 


Although the sugar beet root aphid, Pemphigus betae 
Doane, has been present for several years it was not until 
194-9 that it was considered an important pest of sugar 
beets in southern Alberta. The tonnage and sugar content 
of the beets was much lower than normal that year owing 
to the aphid infestation. The losses due to £. betae were 
further increased by a dry season and an early frost. 

P. b etae became important in the sugar beet growing 
areas of the western United States shortly after the turn 
of the century. In Montana it was reported in some years 
to have reduced yield by 30 per cent and reduced the sugar 
content by two per cent (13-16). It has been shown recently 
that R. betae can transfer the virus disease known as curly 
top from one plant to another (6). 

Since very little work had been done in Canada on 
this insect a study was begun in 1950 on life history, 
ecology, distribution, economic importance, and control of 
P. betae.

LITERATURE REVIEW 


All sugar beet root aphid work of importance has 
been reviewed. At the beginning of each section literature 
pertaining to the section is briefly presented. A review 
of literature on production of winged and sexual forms of 
aphids generally is also included, as this has a bearing 
on the problem of sugar beet root aphid infestation in 
southern Alberta. 

SYNONYMY 

Baker (38) considered Pemphigus betae Doane to be 
a form of Pemphigus balsamiferae Williams or Pemphigus 
populivenae Fitch. This view was upheld by Lange (73) 
in 1939 when he stated Pemphigus balsamiferae was commonly 
considered a synonym of Pemphigus betae. Maxon and Knowlton 
(8?) in 1929 claimed ]?. balsamif erae was the spring form 
of Pj> betae . 

Gillette and Bragg (49) in 1915 stated that galls 
of P^ betae had been called P_, balsamif erae and Pemphigus 
populicaulis Fitch. The latter, they claim, is confined 
to the eastern United States. 

P. b etae Doane and Smynthrodes betae West (now Forda 
betae (West) were thought to be synonymous until Baker (5)

separated the two species in 1919* He found P. betae 
Doane to have more slender antennae with the spine-like 
hairs less prominent, and segment five of the antennae 
longer. 

P. balsamiferae was described by Williams in 1890 
and specimens were deposited in the U. S. National Museum 
labelled 6/24/90. However this description was not pub¬ 
lished until 1910 (128). The description of JP. b etae 
was published by Doane (35) in 1900. Therefore, under 
the law of priority (Article 25)? P. betae is the valid 
name of the species and balsamiferae is reduced to 

synonymy. 

Not all reports of P^ beta e on sugar beets and other 
hosts are necessarily correct (83, 119)* P. betae has 
been confused with JP. populimonilis Riley and FW populi - 
transversus Riley (73) and P . populivenae Fitch (38).

obsolete* Apterous individuals yellowish, sometimes so covered 
with the whitish secretions as to make them appear almost 
white; legs, antennae, distal half of back, and a rather 
large spot on the dorsal aspect of the head, very dark brown; 
eyes very small, almost black; the white flocculent secretion 
is confined to the last three segments of the abdomen, and is 
often 1 mm* long, sometimes even longer. 

Larvae, like the apterous individuals, only more slender, 
and in the earlier stages with only' five joints to the 
antennae, the last of which is the longest.’ 1 


DISTRIBUTION 

P, b etae Doane occurs in most states west of the 
Mississippi. Its distribution is roughly correlated with 
that of the narrowleaf poplar, Ponulus angustifolia ( 83 ). 

In Canada sugar beet root aphids have been reported 
from southern Alberta ( 78 , 79 ? 126), southern British 
Columbia (79)? southern Ontario (79) and several 
localities in Quebec (79)* 


ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE 

During the period from 1909 to 1920 the sugar beet 
crop in irrigated districts of Montana was reduced in 
many fields by 30 per cent in tonnage and two per cent 
in sugar content (13-16). Periodically P^ betae has been 
reported as the most serious threat to the sugar beet 
industry in Oregon (9) ? Utah (57* 58), Washington (9 ? 89 ), 
and California (39) • 

In southern Alberta local losses in tonnage 
and sugar content have occurred frequently between 1929

and 1951, attributed to the activity of P. betae ( 126 ). 
In 1949 the damage was so severe that Canadian Sugar 
Factory officials requested the Dominion Department of 
Agriculture to initiate a research project on b etae 
in southern Alberta irrigated districts. 

LIFE HISTORY AND HABITS 


The following account of life history is essentially 
that of Parker (93)* The fall migrants fly from the 
summer host to the native poplars, Populu s balsamifera 
and Populus a ngustifolia . and apparently prefer trees on 
which the leaves are yellow to those with green leaves 
or without leaves. 

The aphids usually alight on the leaves, then 
immediately start moving down the stem to the main branches 
and to the trunk, where some enter suitable cracks, while 
others continue to the ground and conceal themselves among 
leaves, or in the soil around the base of the tree. Once 
hidden they produce four to seven yellow nymphs. 

These nymphs which are the sexual forms, are mostly 
female. The female is nearly twice the size of the male 
and contains a single large egg, which shows plainly 
through the body wall. Both sexes have rudimentary mouth 
parts and they do not feed. The nymphs pass through four 
stadia in approximately four days.

Sexual activity is not shown until the fourth stadium, 
when the aphids mature. Then the males crawl blindly 
about attempting to copulate with any female they can 
find© Seven to twelve days after birth the female deposits 
a single pale yellow egg, and dies. Sometimes death occurs 
before the egg is extruded, in which case the walls of 
the abdomen gradually shrink away leaving the egg exposed. 
Normally a mass of bluish-white threads are secreted 
in which the egg rests after deposition. 

The eggs laid by the sexual females remain in the 
crevices of the bark until the following spring. Early 
in April they become darker in color, and eye spots appear. 
A dark spot is also seen on the abdomen. 

Hatching of the eggs of betae starts when the 
weather begins to warm up. The shell splits near the 
cephalic region and the first instar aphid forces its 
way out by expansions of the body. 

The nymphs, which later become stem mothers, crawl 
up the trees and cluster upon the expanding buds. As 
soon as the leaves unfold, feeding begins, generally on 
the upper sides of the leaves in the angle between the 
midrib and the first or second vein. The resulting 
gall first starts as a depression at the point of attack, 
which gradually deepens and is finally closed from above 
by the growth of the leaf. The opening is an obscure

narrow slit parallel with the midrib or one of the 
large veins. Stem mothers give birth to young early 
in June. The number of young averages 75? however it may 
be as high as one hundred and seventy-two. 

All progeny of the stem mother develop wings and 
leave the galls during the later part of June and most 
of July. These winged aphids are the spring migrants 
which fly to the summer host and produce young on the 
leaves. The nymphs wander around on the leaf of the 

i. 

summer host for a short time, then go down the leaf stalk 
to the root where they are seen during the summer as the 
apterous parthenogenetic forms. 

During the summer wingless viviparous females alone 
are produced. This method of reproduction continues until 
fall and appears to be checked only by cold weather, lack 
of food, and unfavorable soil conditions. 

From midsummer until fall a portion of the progeny 
of the wingless viviparous females develop wing pads, and 
when fully grown acquire wings and fly to the winter host. 
Parker claims that water content of the soil has much to 
do with the number of winged forms produced. If the soil 
is kept moist or rootlets of the host plant are succulent, 
few winged aphids are produced. However, if the soil becomes 
dry and the rootlets tough, production of migrants is

greatly accelerated. Gillette and Bragg (49) claim 
that only half of the summer forms migrate. Most 
writers agree that there is not a total migration. 

Lange (72, 73) claims that there are no sexual 
forms in California. Essig (39) stated that fall migration 
occurs at approximately the same time as in Alberta, but 
in California no galls are formed and the fall migrants 
are probably only a means of dispersing the population 
of aphids. 

Maxon (84) stated that aphids could migrate from 
beet to beet in the field, and that the infestation could 
be increased from 68 to 100 per cent in two weeks by 
irrigation and other factors. 

Paddock (91) stated that in Texas the host relation¬ 
ship of P_. betae is completely reversed. Alate viviparous 
females are found on turnip foliage in October and apterae 
feeding on its roots during the winter. The alates were 
found again in March and produced young which spent the 
summer in galls on cottonwood trees. Eggs were not found. 

In other species of migrating aphids, for example, 

Aphis rumicis L., there are three forms of alate partheno- 
genetic females, namely migrants, dispersal forms, and 
sexuparae. These females resemble each other morphologically 
but differ in their relation to the migrating habit. 

Sanderson (106), Doane (35)? and Essig (39) suggest that

dispersal forms of the aphid occur. Other workers report 
only two forms: spring migrants, and fall migrants which 
are the sexuparae. Parker (93) stated that the fall 
winged forms could not possibly start a winter colony but 
he gives no evidence for this statement. 

FALL AND WINTER PERIOD 

Fall migration 

In southern Alberta the overwintering eggs and 
the sexuales have not been found. It has been observed 
however that the fall migrants fly from the beets to the 
poplars from September to November. In Alberta, the 
number of migrants formed varies between plants and 
between fields* 

Object: 

To determine the effect of temperature on 
the length of life of fall migrants of betae . 

Methods and materials: 

Fall migrants were placed in cheesecloth 
covered vials at constant temperatures ranging from 
0 to 25° C. in five degree intervals. The vials were 
kept in darkness and at a constant relative humidity 
of 60%. At each temperature two hundred aphids were 
used in ten replicates of twenty. The twelve hundred 
aphids used in the experiment were collected on the

same day and all had emerged from the soil during the 
previous twelve hours* 

Results: 

The results which are shown in Figure 1 
indicate that within the limits of the experiment the 
fall migrants live longer at the lower temperatures. The 
experiment also shows that fall migrants can withstand 
temperatures as low as 0° C. The aphids were completely 
inactive at 0° C. and had to he warmed up slightly to tell 
whether they were alive or dead. Obviously this affected 
the results at this temperature. 

The production of sexuales has been studied by many 
workers in the past. Phillips (100) working with 
Macrosiphum granarium (Kby.) in 1916, stated that cold 
weather favored the production of sexual forms. Uichanco 
( 125 ) believed development of sexuales was brought about 
by cold and lack of food. Shull (112) moved winged mothers 
from low to high temperatures and found that they produced 
gamic daughters at first, but gradually, over a period of 
ten days changed completely to the production of partheno- 
genetic daughters, while similar females continued at low 
temperatures yielded almost exclusively gamic offspring. 
Wadley (129) could not induce production of sexuales 
in Rhopalsiphum prunifoliae by cold treatment.

Davidson (20-22) brought forward the view that food 
controlled gamic reproduction, but had no experimental 
proof for his statement. Wadley (129) was not able to 
induce R. prunifoliae to produce sexual forms by starvation 
or artificial colonization on the winter food plant. 

Marcovitch (8l) was able to get the strawberry 
root louse, Aphi s farbesi Tenn., to produce sexual females 
in spring by exposing the plants on which they were 
feeding to eight hours of light a day. Davidson (28) was 
able to get adults of Aphis rumicis to produce sexuales 
by supplying the same light duration as Marcovitch. 

Object: 

To find a method of handling that will cause 
migrants to produce sexuales. 

Methods and Materials: 

Aphids were kept at temperatures of 25°, 20°, 
and 15° C. in glass vials covered with cheesecloth. Two 
series of eighty aphids each were used at each temperature 
in four replicates of twenty. The first series was started 
on October 17> and the second on October 2?. On October 30 
the experiment was repeated using temperatures from 0 to 25° C. 
in five degree intervals. In the last series ten vials 
were used, each containing twenty aphids. In all these 
tests the aphids were kept in the dark. In the first two

series no attention was paid to humidity, but in the last 
part of the experiment the humidity was kept at 60% by 
keeping the vials in a desiccator, partially filled with 
sulfuric acid and water* 

Results: 

No sexuales were produced under the conditions 
used in this experiment. In these tests the moisture 
available to the aphids would be less at the higher tempera¬ 
tures. The saturation deficiency should have been constant 
rather than the relative humidity* 

Object: 

To determine whether the fall migrants had already 
produced young or whether this species dispensed with the 
production of sexuales in this area and the migrants produced 
haploid eggs themselves* 

Methods and Materials: 

At the same time as the previous series of tests 
were being run another sample of the population was 
dissected. 

Results: 

In the twenty aphids examined, three to six young 
were found in each at various stages of development. This 
suggests that the fall migrants cannot produce eggs, but 
can produce live young if reared under the proper conditions.

Aphids in the soil 

According to Parker (93) some of the aohids 
overwinter in the soil in Montana. 

Object: 

To determine whether _P. betae overwinters 
in the soil in southern Alberta. 

Methods and materials: 

Fields were located where a heavy infestation 
had been recorded the previous year. The soil in these 
fields was carefully examined in April and early May for 
overwintering adults. 

Results: 

In 1950 and again in 1951 fields were found 
in the Lethbridge Northern Irrigation District which 
contained overwintering aphids. These aphids were found 
only in fields that had not been cultivated the previous 
fall. The aphids were not present in large numbers but 
could have formed a nucleus for an outbreak; they were 
found in cracks in the soil and were associated with 
secondary roots or some other organic matter*

population is of economic, importance in the irrigated 
areas of southern Alberta• 

Methods and materials: 

Fields that contained overwintering aphids 
were carefully examined from the time that the aphids were 
found, until a crop was sown. 

Overwintering aphids were placed in soil in 
pots. For a period of two weeks the soil in these pots 
was cultivated. 

Results: 

In fields that were fall cultivated it was not 
possible to find an overwintering aphid population in the 
following spring. One week after spring cultivation no 
aphids were found in fields that had contained an over¬ 
wintering population earlier in the season. 

By mechanical agitation of the soil in the pots 
in the greenhouse overwintering aphids were totally 
destroyed. This experiment indicates that the over¬ 
wintering aphid population can be controlled by thorough 
spring or fall cultivation• The aphids are probably 
destroyed by desiccation, starvation, and mechanical 
injury.

SPRING AND SUMMER PERIOD 

Spring migration 

In the spring of 1950 and 1951 galls of P^ betae 
were found on Populus angustifolia . Populus balsamifera , 
and one specimen of Populus trichocarpa . These galls were 
formed by the same means as described by Parker (93)• 

Object: 

To establish the period of emergence of migrants 
and number of young produced in galls caused by jh b etae 
and jh populicaulis . 

Methods and materials: 

A survey was undertaken to find trees in 
irrigated districts and along river banks that had produced 
galls caused by the two species of aphids. The galls were 
examined from time to time, and when winged migrants were 
reaching maturity the galls were covered by small clip 
cages (see appendices page 79). 

The cages were emptied regularly and the number 
of aphids emerging from the galls were counted. 

Results: 

The period of emergence of fh betae was from 
June 21 to July 20 in 1950 and from June 30 to 
August 7 in 1951. The number of young emerging from 
each gall averaged 25 with a maximum of sixty-four. This 
was much lower than the number obtained by Parker (93)•

The period of spring migration of R. populicaulis 
was much longer than that of JP^ betae extending from June 
28 to September 22 in 1950. The number of young emerging 
from one gall averaged 60 but the maximum was as high as 
one hundred and forty. 

Object: 

To determine the effect of temperature on rate 
of emergence of the spring migrants from galls caused by 
Pemphigus populicaulis Fitch. 

Methods and materials: 

Leaves of Populus sargent i i that had galls 
caused by P^ populicaulis were removed from trees in the 
Picture Butte irrigation district on August 12. The galls 
were placed on moist blotting paper in jars covered with 
cheesecloth and kept at constant temperatures from 25 to 5° C. 
in five degree intervals. Records of emergence from galls 
were taken. The experiment was run twice. Ten galls were 
kept at each temperature in each test. 

Results: 

The effect of temperature on emergence is shown 
in Figure 2. This experiment shows that an increase in 
temperature reduces the number of days for total emergence 
of the migrants from the galls. A cool spring and summer

would thus extend the duration of migration from these 
poplar galls. 

Under field conditions the number of aphids 
migrating daily from one gall varied considerably even 
though the temperature on some days was the same. 

Object: 

To determine whether there is a variation in 
the number of aphids emerging daily from galls kept at a 
constant temperature. 

Methods and materials: 

Fifty JP. populicaulis galls were taken from 
Populus sargentii in the Picture Butte irrigation district 
on the same day. These galls were kept on moist blotting 
paper in jars covered with cheesecloth, at constant 
temperatures of from 5 to 25° C., in five degree intervals. 
There were ten galls at each temperature. Records of 
emergence were made daily for nineteen days. 

Results: 

The results which are shown in Table 1 indicate 
that under conditions of constant temperature there is 
considerable variation in daily emergence of the migrants 
from galls caused by Pemphigus populicaulis .

Aphids on beets 

The summer infestation of the root aphids on beets 
in Alberta is similar to that described by Parker (93) 
in Montana. 

Much work has been done on the influence of light, 
temperature, and nutrition on rate of reproduction of 
aphids. Davidson (20-22) and Evans (40) noted that plants 
grown under poor light conditions produced fewer aphids

than those grown under normal light conditions. Ewing 
( 41 - 44 ) noted that fewer aphids were produced at lower 
temperatures. 

Davidson (20-22) found that the rate of reproduction 
of Aphis rumicis varied on different plants, and even on 
different varieties of the same plant. Evans (40) did 
not find any correlation between soluble sugars in cabbage 
and rate of reproduction of the aphid, Brevicoryne 
brassicae L. He did find however that under late summer 
conditions of light, the rate of reproduction is positively 
correlated with the nitrogen content of the host plant, 
and, in particular, with the protein content, Evans (40) 
also noted that the pH of cell sap of eleven varieties 
of trees was positively correlated with fecundity of the 
aphids. Creighton (18) noted that zinc and copper deficient 
plants seemed to meet the requirements of certain aphids. 
Haseman (54) showed that deficiencies in the plant of iron, 
calcium, potash, phosphorus, magnesium or nitrogen reduced 
the number of offspring produced by female aphids. 

Since £. betae is difficult to observe during the 
summer because it lives under the ground, there are no 
records of frequency of reproduction or the number of 
progeny from one female. When lambsquarters was found 
to be infested in the field it was noted that the 
infestation was lower than on beets in the immediate vicinity.

This suggests that aphids do not reproduce as rapidly 
on this host as on the beet. 

METHODS OF DISPERSAL 

The aphids are dispersed in southern Alberta by 
wind, irrigation water, flight, and movement through cracks 
in the soil. Chittenden (9) claimed ants aided in 
dispersal, but this has not been observed in Alberta. 

HOSTS 


WINTER HOSTS 

Workers in United States found that Populus 
angustifolia . the narrowleaf poplar, and Populus balsamifera 
the balsam poplar, were the only poplar species that could 
serve as the winter hosts of P. betae (4-5, 4-7, 85* 86, 93) • 
In Texas, Paddock (91), found that P. betae overwintered on 
turnip root So 

In California this species does not require a primary 
host (38). The fall migration which occurs at the same 
time as in Alberta appears to be only a means of dispersal. 

Object: 

To determine the winter hosts of Ih betae . 

Methods and materials: 

During the springs of 1950 and 1951, poplar trees

in shelter belt and river areas near irrigated districts, 
were examined for galls formed by R. betae. 

Results: 

The following species of poplar were found to 
have betae galls: Populus angustifolia James, 
narrowleaf poplar; Populus trichocarpa Torr. and Gray, 
black cottonwood; Populus balsamifer a L., balsam poplar* 

P. betae galls were not found on Populus acuminata Rydb., 
lanceleaf poplar; Populus s argentii Dode., plains cottonwood. 
Many hybrids of the above species of poplar were found* 

Some of these hybrids had galls, but most of them were free 
of infestations. In connection with these studies three 
other species of Pemphigus were found to be forming galls 
on poplars along the river banks or in shelter belts. 

Pemphigus p opulicaulis Fitch was found to cause 
galls to be formed on: Populus angustIfolia * Populus 
balsamifera . Populus sargentii * Populus trichocarpa * and 
Populus acuminata . 

Pemphigus populimonilis Riley was found to cause 
galls to be formed only on Populus angustifolia . 

Pemphigus populitransversus Riley was found to 
cause galls to be formed only on Populus sargentii .

claim that all the reported cases of infestation of beets 
and other hosts by JP^ betae do not necessarily refer to 
this species. Some of the plants may not, therefore, be 
hosts of betae because of errors in identification of 
the aphids.

Methods and materials: 

Plants were dug up in the field and examined 
for root aphid infestations. 

Plants were grown in pots in the greenhouse 
and apterous forms of the aphid placed on the soil in 
the pots. 

Results: 

Winged root aphids collected from sugar beets, 
lettuce, and lambsquarters were identified as JP* betae . 
Apterous aphids were obtained from dandelions, alfalfa, 
and red root pigweed but no winged forms, so identification 
was not obtained, Goldenrod, stinkweed, Russian thistle, 
Canadian thistle, wild barley, flax, and roadside grasses 
were found to be free from infestations*

thistle, flax, and wheat were grown. It was not possible 
to get infestations of P_. betae established on any of these 
plants. 

TYPES OF INJURY 


DAMAGE TO BEETS 

The sugar beet root aphid sucks the juice from the 
root hairs as well as from the tap root. The presence 
of a few aphids on the roots of a beet may not result in 
any change in appearance of the foliage. However, as 
the numbers increase, the leaves become flaccid and pale 
in color, the beet root shrivels and becomes spongy. 
Finally, if infestation is severe, the leaves wither, and 
the plant dies. 

In 1939 Bennett and Wallace (6) showed that betae 
was even more important than formerly supposed. In some 
of their experiments it was noted that betae transmitted 
the virus disease curly top. 

EFFECT OF FROST ON INFESTED BEETS 

In 1949 it appeared that sugar beet plants that were 
infested with sugar beet root aphids were more severely 
damaged with frost than those in the same field that were 
not infestedo

Object: 

To determine the effect of aphid infestation 
on the extent of frost damage to sugar beet leaves. 

Methods and materials: 

An impartial observer was asked to pick ten 
beets that appeared to show the most severe frost damage 
and ten which showed the least damage in two fields. 

These beets were then dug and examined for root aphid 
infestations• 

Infested and uninfested beets were transplanted 
from laboratory plots to pots and placed at temperatures 
of -10, -15, and -20° C. The beets were examined for 
frost damage. 


Results: 

Field No. 1 
Severe frost damage 

Light frost damage 

Field. No. 2 
Moderate frost damage 

Very light frost damage 


9 heavily infested 
1 uninfested 

7 lightly infested 
3 uninfested 


2 lightly infested 
8 uninfested 

10 uninfested 


Field observations indicate that a severe infestation 
increases frost damage. There was no apparent difference

between severity of frost damage on infested and uninfested 
beets in the temperature rooms* The infested beets were not 
however supporting a heavy root aphid infestation. The 
laboratory experiment would thus suggest that an infestation 
of sugar beet root aphids would not increase visible frost 
damage. 

GALL FORMATION 

Comparison of galls produced by P* betae and three 

other species . 

The common galls on poplars in southern Alberta that 
might be mistaken for R. betae galls are those caused by 
Pemphigus populimonilis Riley, Pemphigus populitransversus 
Riley, and Pemphigus populicaulis Fitch. Therefore, a 
description and pictures of these galls are presented. 

Species Host Description of Gall 

Pemphigus Populus The poplar leaf usually 

populimonilis < has a bead-like row of 



galls down each side of 
the midrib. These galls 
open on the upper surface 
and are formed by an 
invagination of the leaf. 


Pemphigus 

populitransversus 


Populus The galls are roughly 

sargentii spherical and vary in 

size from 1/4 to 3/4 inch 


in diameter. These are 
formed somewhere along 
the petiole, usually at 
the junction of the 


petiole and the blade.

in diameter. The gall 
which is between the 
petiole and blade of the 
leaf is formed by the 
twisting and swelling of 
the petiole to form a 
pocket with a long 
angular slit.

are 1/4 to 1/2 inch 
deep, and 1/2 to 3/4 
inch long. More than one 
gall may be formed on a 
leaf. 


Variations in P. betae gall formations on poplar leaves . 

. The galls of JP. betae are not always formed singly on 
the poplar leaf as generally described in the literature. 
During the summer of 1951 leaves showing various combinations 
of Pjj. betae galls were collected and some are reproduced in 
the photographs on the following pages. Other leaves were 
found on which there was a gall caused by JP. populicaulis 
at the base of the blade and one caused by P. betae part way 
up the midrib of the same leafo

Preliminary studies of gall formation 

In the Lethbridge Northern Irrigation District 
galls formed by Pemphigus betae could not be found within 
several miles of most of the sugar beet root aphid infested 
fields. Galls were found only along the banks of the Old 
Man River on Populus balsamifera and Populus angustifolia . 
Throughout the irrigated district Populus sargentii 
is prevalent in the shelter belts, and galls formed by 
Pemphigus populicaulis and Pemphigus populitransversus were 
observed on this species of poplar close to infested fields. 

This suggests that there might be more than one 
species of aphid infesting beets, or that the same species 
might be forming different types of galls by feeding at 
different places on the trees. 

Object: 

To determine the relationship between gall formation 
and feeding of P^ betae and populicaulis at different 
parts of the leaf. 

Methods and materials: 

Aphids that were starting to form .P. betae galls 
were transferred from their position next to the mid vein, 
and placed at the junction of the petiole and the blade. 

Aphids that were starting to form P^ populicaulis galls were 
transferred from their position at the junction of the blade 
and the petiole, and placed part way up the leaf blade next

to the mid vein® Transfers were also made to other leaves. 
Populus balsamifera was used as the test species of poplar® 

The aphids, after being removed from their initial site, were 
retained in the second position by the leaf clip cages. The 
experiment was carried on during the last week in May 1951. 

Results: 

All attempts to get the aphids to form a second 
gall failed. Present observations indicate that either the 
aphids did not feed after being transferred, or they lost 
the ability to cause gall formation when moved to another 
leaf, or another part of the same leaf® 

The stem mothers of many species of aphids produce 
only thirty young. In galls of P^ betae and JP. populicaulis 
there are often many more than thirty spring migrants pro¬ 
duced. 

Object: 

To determine whether the stem mother produces all 
the young that are in the galls caused by fh betae and 
P* populicaulis o 

Methods and materials: 

The small clip cages were placed over galls in 
which all aphids, except a single mature migrant, were removed®

In other cages where a large number of young were present, 
all but the stem mother were removed. Ten galls of £. betae 
and ten of populicaulis were used for the test with mig¬ 
rants; ten populicaulis were used for the stem mother test* 

Results: 

No young were produced in any gall by the spring 
migrants. This was not expected for it would appear that 
they should produce woolly apterous forms at least. It is 
possible that the cages might have some influence on the 
reproduction of the migrants. The stem mothers in all cages 
continued to produce young. 


REARING 


IN THE GREENHOUSE 

During the summer of 19?C greenhouse cultures 
were readily established by two methods: galls containing 
migrants were brought into the greenhouse, the summer apterous 
forms were put in pots containing beets. At first consider¬ 
able difficulty was encountered in getting the aphids to 
reproduce rapidly. This was overcome by placing the pots 
in a dish which was filled with water regularly, the amount 
being not quite sufficient to wet the soil to the surface. 

Thus a moisture gradient was available to the aphids. This 
method was satisfactory until fall. 

In fall and again in March a large number of mig¬ 
rants appeared in the culture. In the greenhouse the fall

migration occurred at the same time as the fall migration 
from beets to poplars in the field. The spring migration 
from the pots appeared at approximately the same time as 
the spring migration in California, and at the same time 
as the migration of Pemphigus populitransversus . from 
crucifers to poplars, in Colorado. 

Usually in collecting aphids, the soil was examined, 
and the aphids picked up with a camel hair brush. When in¬ 
festation was high, some of the root hairs and aphids were 
brought to the surface of the soil by covering it with 
boards. When the boards were lifted, the aphids were 
readily collected to be used in experiments. 

ARTIFICIAL FEEDING 

It was difficult to study the root aphid readily 
when it was feeding on the beet root. To facilitate work 
on aphid diseases, nutrition, and wing formation, it was 
decided to test various artificial means of feeding the 
aphids. 

The following methods have been tried without success 

1. Pieces of sugar beet root were supplied on moist blotting 
paper. 

2. Aphids were kept on a layer of plaster of paris in tins 
and were supplied with moisture and geminating beet 
seeds• 

3. Aphids were placed in vials which contained sugar 
beet root hairs on moist blotting paper.

5. Aphids were put in petri dishes, the bottoms of which 
were moistened with a solution of glucose. 

6 . Aphids were put on blotting paper covered with the 
extracted juice of the sugar beet. 

7. Ground up beets were put in agar plates and aphids 
placed on the plates. 

8 . Aphids were kept on plates of agar containing sucrose 
and beet juice. (The bacteria on the aphids contaminated 
the sterile plates.) 

9. The aphids were put in tins in which small tubes were 
placed. These small tubes contained honey or juice 
extracted from the beet root, and the open end was 
covered with the outer beet leaf membrane or outer 
beet root membrane.

The galls were those formed by F\ betae, p opulimonilis 
and populitransversus ♦ Two replicates were rim in each 

plot using each species, and two caged beets were left as 
checks. 

Results: 

No infestations of the sugar beets were obtained 
when galls of populicaulis or jP_. populitransversus were 
employed. The checks were also free from root aphids. Only 
one out of the six caged beets became infested with ]\ betae . 
These results suggest that betae migrants are the only ones 
that infest spigar beets. 

EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ON ROOT APHIDS 

TYPE OF SOIL 

In the Taber area of southern Alberta the very light 
soils were generally free of infestations and the district as 
a whole had a much lighter infestation of sugar beet root 
aphids than any other district. 

Object: 

To determine whether sugar beets grown in each of 
the three common types of soil in the irrigated districts of 
southern Alberta can be readily infested with sugar beet root 
aphids#

Methods and materials: 

The leaves were removed from 60 beets grown in 
laboratory plots. The beets were then washed to remove any 
aphid infestation and transplanted into sterilized soil in 
pots, in a greenhouse. Twenty beets were planted in each of 
the three types of soil: sand, clay loam, and heavy clay. 
Twenty-five apterous sugar beet root aphids were put on top 
of the soil next to the growing beet. The beets were dug and 
checked for infestation after six weeks. 

Results: 

Every beet was found to be infested with the root 
aphids. This indicates that sugar beets grown in these three 
types of soil can become infested with root aphids, and that 
soil texture is not an important factor in preventing such 
aphid infestations* 

TEMPERATURE OF SOIL 

Object: 

To determine the effect of high temperature on 
sugar beet root aphids. 

Methods and materials. 

Twenty four beets that had been grown in pots in 
a greenhouse were placed in a room where the temperature was 
kept above 90° F. The plants were grown under artificial 
fluorescent light of an intensity of 300 foot candles and

were watered regularly by placing water in a dish under 
the pots. 

Fifty apterous aphids were placed on the soil 
around the plants. The plants were then allowed to grow for 
three weeks. 

Results: 

The beets grew normally but when examined they 
were completely free from aphid infestations. At the end 
of the experiment the temperature was found to be 88° F. 
just below the soil surface. Aphids had been kept at 
temperatures lower than 90° F. and under the same conditions 
of light and moisture. This test y^ould indicate that a 
constant temperature of 90° F. would prevent root aphids from 
becoming established on sugar beets. 

LIGHT VARIATIONS 

Causes of migration 

Much work has been done on the effect of various 
factors on wing production in aphids. Many workers considered 
only one factor important and disregarded others. 

Ewing (43), Wadley (129), Ackerman (1), and Call (8) 
found temperature influenced wing formation. Ackerman (1) 
noted that certain ranges of temperature were more likely to 
produce winged forms than others; optimums for high wing 
production were 16° C. and 24° C. to 26 ° C., and for low wing 
production 12° C. and 18° C. to 20° C. teen aphids that have

been living at a particular temperature are transferred to 
a new temperature, they produce a higher percentage of winged 
forms during the first two or three weeks than they do later« 

A period of three to ten days must elapse before the effect 
of temperature changes on wing production becomes noticeable, 

Marcovitch (81) and Shull (110-113) found that light 
influenced wing formation, Shull (110-113) showed that aphids 
produced winged offspring when they were reared in inter¬ 
mittent light (8 hours of light alternating with l6 hours of 
darkness). Intermittent light of low intensity required a 
longer period to induce complete wing production than did 
light of high intensity. Shull reared aphids whose previous 
offspring were all winged because they were developed in 
intermittent light and moderate temperature (20° C.). When 
these aphids were placed in continuous light, wings were 
suppressed in 50% of the offspring in three days. High 
temperature (30° C.) applied to similarly reared aphids 
suppressed wings in 50% of the offspring in one day. 
Temperatures lower than 30° C. (29°, 28°, 27° and 26° C.) took 
progressively longer to produce the same effect. 

Shull (110), Y/adley (129), Gregory (50), Mason (82), 
Davidson (20-22), Ackerman (1), and Heinhard (100) noted 
that the parentage of the aphid was important as a factor in 
wing formation. Apterous aphids have a greater tendency to 
produce alate offspring, and alate aphids generally produce 
larger number of apterous progeny.

Baker and Turner (3) pointed out that the 
percentage of winged forms varies in different strains, 
and may be a heritable character. 

Davidson (20-22) found that changes in the 
composition of plant sap induced wing production. Gregory (50), 
Wadley (129), and Ackerman (1) found that starvation caused 
apterous aphids to produce alate offspring while starvation 
of winged parents caused a decrease in the production of 
alate offspring. Evans (40) showed that under late summer 
conditions of light, the formation of wings is negatively 
correlated with the nitrogen content of the host plant, and, 
in particular, with the protein content. Haseman ( 55 ) stated 
that wing formation in the field as well as the laboratory is 
due to the chemical composition of the plant which the aphid 
consumed. 

Davidson (20-22), Woodworth (132), Neils (88), 

Shinji ( 109)5 and Ackerman (1) found that growing plants in 
certain chemicals caused the aphids that were feeding on them 
to produce winged progeny. 

Prevention of migration 

In the greenhouse used for rearing the aphids the 
only apparent variable factor at the time of spring migration 
was the duration of light. The temperature and moisture 
conditions were constant, and overcrowding did not occur. In 
an attempt to prevent migration the duration of light was

increased by using fluorescent lamps to supplement daylight* 
The culture was maintained. It cannot be stated definitely 
that the light was the factor responsible for preventing 
migration, as a total migration never appears to occur in 
the field. The maintenance of the culture may have been 
due to a build up of infestation by the aphids that would not 
have migrated under any conditions. 

NUTRITIVE QUALITY OF SUGAR BEETS 

ObJ ect: 

To determine relationship between nitrogen, 
sugar, and moisture content and liability to infestation 
by aphids. 

Methods and materials: 

During the summer, twenty-four sugar beets were 
grown under varying conditions of light, nutrition, moisture, 
and temperature. After the beets were growing well, root 
aphids were released on them. The plants were then left for 
six weeks. Only eleven of the beets were large enough for 
analyses of the desired factors. Nitrogen was estimated by 
the micro-Kjeldahl method using a five to ten milligram 
composite sample of the root. The total sugar analysis was 
done on a twenty gram sample by a polarographic method at 
the Canadian Sugar Factory Chemistry Laboratory at Taber, 
Alberta. The moisture content was determined by weighing the

might be the reason Parker ( 96 ) obtained an increase in 
sugar content of the beets that were irrigated most 
frequently. 

The results in this experiment are only an 
indication, for the sample size was inadequate, and the 
infestation was extremely variable* Modifications of 
light, moisture, temperature, and nutrition cause a 
variation in the sugar, nitrogen, and moisture content of 
sugar beets* The methods of analysis appeared to be 
satisfactory, 

VARIETAL DIFFERENCES

CONTROLLING FACTORS 

BIOLOGICAL 

Predaceous insects 

Numerous predators are influential in the 
control of b etae . The most important is the chloropid, 
Chloropisca glabra Meig. ( 83 , 95? 117)* The coccinellids 
Hippodamia convergens Guerin, Scymus collaris Meish and 
Scymus appaculus have also been reported as being 
predatory on the aphids (11, 83 ). Reduvicolis ferus was 
reported to be feeding on autumn migrants of the sugar 
beet root aphid (14). The syrphid Syrphus p auxillus has 
been observed feeding on summer aptera in the soil ( 83 )# 

In Alberta large numbers of Chloropisca glabra 
were found to be reducing jP. betae populations on the 
beet roots* 

A number of syrphid larvae were found in galls 
of ILl betae . These larvae were fed on live aphids in the 
laboratory for several weeks, but only one larva pupated 
and the adult did not emerge from the pupal case* These 
larvae controlled the aphids in several hundred galls of 
both betae and JP^ populicaulis in the St. Mary f s and 
Old Man River areas. 

Two other insects were found to be predatory on 
the aphids in the galls. One is a small hemipteran, which

has been tentively identified to the genus Anthocori s* and the 
other is a coccinellid larva* 

Pathogenic microorganisms 

Maxon ( 83 ) reported that the fungus, Empusa aphidis 
(Hoff*) aided in controlling the sugar beet root aphids* 
Certain microorganisms appeared to reduce the 
population in the greenhouse* Three fungi and one bacterium 
were isolated from aphids that had died. These were cultured 
on potato dextrose agar. 

Object: 

To determine if microorganisms isolated from dead 
aphids are primary pathogens of JP. betae 0 

Methods and materials: 

Three methods of inoculation were used for these 

tests * 

1) Potato dextrose agar plates were covered with a 
suspension of organisms and aphids placed in them* 

2) Aphids were placed in sterile petri dishes and 
covered with a suspension of organisms. 

3) Aphids were dropped into the disease organism 
suspensions, then taken out and placed in dry 
sterile petri dishes. 

Distilled water was used in the checks. 

The aphids were collected from greenhouse cultures 
and washed for several minutes in sterile distilled water to

reduce number of surface contaminants before being used 
in the tests* 

Results: 

In these tests the aphids died as rapidly in the 
checks as in the treated dishes. The aphids were not fed 
because a method of artificial feeding had not been developed 
and it was not possible to observe them on their natural host* 

In the galls, many specimens of both JP* betae and 

* 

P. po pulicaulis were apparently destroyed by a microorganism* 

The galls contained partly decomposed aphids and a fungus 
growth which may have been secondary. 

ARTIFICIAL 

Irrigation 

A modification of irrigation practices has been 
recommended as the main method of root aphid control since 
the work of Parker (94, 96). He recommended frequent irrigation, 
four to six times a year, starting with an early irrigation 
in mid-June. Parker (94, 96), Hansen (51? 52), and Cooley (15) 
have shown that these practices reduce infestations and increase 
sugar content and yield. 

In the Lethbridge Northern Irrigation District and 
in the St. Mary*s River District, fields were observed where 
infestations were heavy, even though as many as six irrigations

had been applied. In these areas it would appear that frequent 
irrigation did not control infestations. 

Two farmers in the L.N.I.D. have not been troubled 
with root aphid infestations in their fields, although their 
neighbors* fields have been infested. Both men irrigate and 
cultivate their fields earlier and usually more frequently 
than their neighbors. In the spring of 1951 two experiments 
were set up on fourteen farms to test the effects of early 
irrigation and early cultivation on root aphid infestations. 
These experiments were abandoned owing to heavy rains during 
the period from June 15 to August 1 when irrigations and culti¬ 
vations were to have been done. 

Crop rotation 

Dustan ( 36 ) and Sanderson (106) recommend crop 
rotation as a control measure. Maxon ( 83 , 84) however stated 
that hibernating aphids are a source of infestation but that 
rotations are of no value. 

Rotations in the irrigated areas of southern Alberta 
did not appear to prevent or reduce infestations. Beets were 
grown in fields that had contained infested beets the previous 
year. Some of these fields had a lighter infestation than 
fields that had been summerfallowed the previous year while 
others were more severely infested. Some farmers interviewed 
claimed that they had encountered a greater infestation in 
fields that had been growing alfalfa prior to beets.

Observations in 1950 indicated that there was no apparent 
difference in the infestation in the fields that had grown 
alfalfa and those that had grown other crops the previous year c 

Cultivation 

Field observations indicate that early and frequent 
cultivations reduce the level of infestations* A thorough 
spring or fall cultivation destroys most of the overwintering 
root aphids in the field. Most farmers in the irrigated 
districts of southern Alberta cultivate thoroughly in the 
spring, consequently the overwintering population would 
seldom be of any importance in this area* 

Location of field 

Both Maxon (84) and Dustan ( 36 ) recommend planting 
susceptible crops at some distance from cottonwoods as a 
means of control. 

This is probably not important in irrigated areas of 
southern Alberta because the sugar beet root aphid galls are 
only found on poplars along the river banks. The aphids are 
thus often at a distance from the fields they infest. The 
aphids are generally distributed over the whole area growing 
sugar beets, so that growing beets at different places on the 
farm would probably neither reduce nor prevent infestations* 

Weed control 

Dustan (36) recommends control of secondary hosts as 
a means of control of the aphids.

In one field examined, lambsquarters became infested 
before the beets and acted as a centre for a local infestation, 
thus its control may aid in reducing infestations. 

Ant control 

Chittenden (9) recommends breaking up ants* nests 
as an aid in control of root aphids, because ants act as dis¬ 
tributing agents. This does not seem important in southern 
Alberta as ants have not yet been found associated with _P. betae 
in the field. 

DISCUSSION 

In life history studies, two important parts of the 
life cycle were not established: site of oviposition and pro¬ 
duction of sexuales. The studies on predators should be con¬ 
tinued because predation may be one of the main reasons that 
P. betae has not severely damaged crops several years in suc¬ 
cession in southern Alberta. The reports (79* 126) in the past 
indicate that this insect is very troublesome for one to two 
years, then it disappears as a major pest in the irrigated 
areas, to return again a few years later. Additional information 
should be obtained on the syrphid larvae that are destroying 
aphids in the galls. The small hemipteran and the coodnellid 
larvae that were killing the aphids are being identified to 
species. A study should be made on their life histories*

It should be pointed out that in the temperature 
experiment with fall migrants the saturation deficiency should 
have been constant rather than the relative humidity. In the 
experiment the aphids at the higher temperatures were subject 
to a much greater moisture loss than those at lower temperatures* 
Much information could be obtained on migration, 
production of sexes and natural control of jFh b etae if an 
artificial feeding medium could be developed* 

The secondary hosts of JP*. nopulicaulis and P, 
nopulitransversus are not known in this area. As these 
aphids are present on poplars and are closely related 
to _Pj. betae further investigations on their host relationship 
may lead to further information on the sugar beet root aphid 
problem. No secondary host has been recorded for JP. populicaulis * 
Results of the experiment on nitrogen, sugar, and 
moisture content of the beets indicated that there was no 
correlation between these factors and the root aphid infestations* 
This work should be carried further and done on a much larger 
scale* 

Variety studies were of little value because of the 
low aphid infestation* These should be repeated since there is 
a possibility that some resistance might be shown by certain 
varieties* 

A thorough study of control methods was not attempted. 
Work should be started on the effect of systemic insecticides 
and chlorinated hydrocarbons on the root aphids. Studies should

SUM RY 


The sugar beet root aphid is present in Alberta 
throughout the sugar beet growing area. 

Secondary hosts were found to be sugar beets, lambs- 
quarters, and lettuce. 

The number of days for total emergence of alates from 
galls of p opulicaulis is negatively correlated with temperature 
under laboratory conditions. 

The primary hosts of jF\ betae were found to be 
Populus angustifolia . Populus balsamifera and rarely Populus 
trichocarpa . 

Galls caused by Pemphigus populicaulis . Pemphigus 
pppulitransversus . and Pemphigus populimonilis may be mistaken 
for those caused by P_. betae . 

The galls of betae were first noticed to be forming 
on May 22. The flight of the spring migrants extended from 
June 20 to August 7 * The flight of the fall migrants extended 
from September 4 to October 30. 

Some apterous forms of JP^ betae overwinter in the soil 
in sugar beet fields in southern Alberta. The overwintering 
populations are not generally economically important because 
thorough spring or fail cultivation can control this form. 

Field observations indicate that early and thorough cultivation

of the beets during the summer aids in controlling the in¬ 
festation of £. betae. In this area the spring migrant is the 
form that usually produces the economically important summer 
infestation on beets 0 

No correlation was found between sugar, nitrogen, 
and moisture content of the sugar beets, and the extent of sugar 
beet root aphid infestation. 

Rotations are of little value as a control measure 
for the root aphids. Contrary to work done by Parker in 
Montana, frequent irrigation did not aid in controlling the 
root aphids. 

A measure of biological control is effected by the 
following predators: Chloropisca g labra Meig. (Chloropidae, 
Diptera), a species of Syrphidae (Diptera), Anthocoris 
species (Anthocoridae, Hemiptera), and certain Coccinellidae 
(Coleoptera)•

APPENDICES 


DEFINITION OF TERMS 

Fundatrices or stem mothers 

Apterous or alate viviparous parthenogenetic females 
hatching from overwintering eggs on the primary host. 

Sugar beet root aphid stem mothers are wingless. 
Fundatrigeniae 

Apterous or alate, viviparous, parthenogenetic females 
arising from fundatrices. 

Spring migrants 

Alate, viviparous, parthenogenetic females arising from 
stem mothers and migrating from the primary to secondary 
host. Spring migrants of the sugar beet root aphid are 
fundatrigeniae♦ 

Alienicolae. seconds or summer forms 

Apterous, viviparous, parthenogenetic females born on the 
secondary host and comprising several to many generations. 
Sexuparae or gynoparae 

Apterous or alate, viviparous, parthenogenetic females 
that are offspring of the alienicolae, and which give 
birth to apterous or alate sexuales. The sexuparae of 
P. betae are winged and produce apterous sexuales. 

Fall migrants 

Offspring of the aliencolae that migrate from the

secondary to the primary host. Sugar beet root aphid 
fall migrants are the sexuaparae. 

Sexuales or sexes 

Male and female progeny of the sexuparae, either born 
on the secondary host, whence they migrate to the 
primary host, or on the primary host. They usually do 
not feed at all, develop rapidly and mate. The females 
lay one to several eggs which overwinter. Both adults 
normally perish before winter. The sugar beet root 
aphid sexes are born on the primary host, and the female 
lays one egg only.
