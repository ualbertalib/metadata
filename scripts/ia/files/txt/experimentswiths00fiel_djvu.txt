SmaiAEY OF IIWESTIGATION 


This research has been divided into two parts, 

A and B. 

Part A consists of an investigation into certain 
peculiar diurnal variations which Y/ere observed by 
a previous experimenter in the radiation from a 
five-meter radio osciallator. A repetition of his 
experiments, and their subsequent analysis shov/ed 
that his results might be explained by variations in 
the input and in the surrounding temperature. 

These factors were then investigated, and found 
to be of importance with certain vacuum tubes, while 
Y/ith others their effect on the radiation was neg¬ 
ligible, providing the tubes were operated at rated 
filament current in all cases. An explanation is 
given. 

Certain peculiarities in Y/ave-length measure¬ 
ments on Lecher-wires are recorded, and the best 
method for making these measurements is pointed out. 

Part B is an account of attempts that Y/ere made 
with certain vacuum tubes to produce wave-lengths 
below five meters. By ordinary methods, using sev¬ 
eral different circuits, the lov/ limit for strong 
oscillations was found to be about 1.61 meters. 













It was then discovered that by using a com¬ 
bination of A.Co and D.C, for the plate supply, stronger 
and more stable oscillations were produced than v/ith 
pure D.C. It was found possible to produce shorter 
wave-lengths with this combination than with D.C. 
alone. 











FART A 


The Effect of Different Conditions on Short 
V/ave Electromagnetic Radiations. 


INTRODUCTION 

The subject of electromagnetic wave propagation 
has been responsible for a great many investia^ions, 
and a number of theories have been suggested to 
explain the various phenomena involved. Based upon 
the explanations put forv/ard by Kennelly and Heaviside 
who postulated an ionized layer of gas in the upper 
atmosphere, theories of reflection were developed 
and contributions made by many physicists and en¬ 
gineers. More recently a refraction theory has 
been suggested by Hoyt Taylor and Hu^flburt ^^^and 
by means of this theory the peculiai?ities of short¬ 
wave and long-wave radio transmission have received 
a satisfactory explanation* 

Although the behaviour of Electromagnetic waves 
after they leave the oscillator has received such 
a great deal of attention, very little experimental 
evidence has been forthcoming as to the effect on 
the oscillator itself of varying intensities of

of light, changing conditions of temperature and 
humidity, etCo At first thou^t one might not ex¬ 
pect these quantities to have any effect at all, or 
at least not a measurable one. However, one or two 
experiments which have been performed in the past 
would seem to indicate that such effects may occur 
and may in some cases be quite considerable. 

Guyer and Austin record some experiments 
which were carried out at 5 meters, and state that 
temperature and humidity, varying from day to day, 
affected the frequency of the oscillator to some 
considerable extent. To quote from their report: 

"The frequency variation by temperature and humidity 
was proved by placing one of the transmitters under 
a glass jar and introducing a small amount of sul¬ 
phuric acid..,". It is to be noted that they did 
not observe (or at least, did not mention) any var¬ 
iation in radiated energy, the effect being a shift 
in frequency only. 

G.H. West working on a wave-length of 5.17 

meters, claims to have observed a considerable change 
in radiated energy with variations in the intensity 
of light falling on the transmitter. The radiation

The radiation was at a maximum in the middle of 
the day, fell off in the afternoon, and became a 
minimum when darkness fell (the assumption is that 
the input was maintained constant during the course 
of the experiment)• He found also that the daylight 
radiation value could be obtained at night by arti¬ 
ficially illuminating the oscillator; so that arti¬ 
ficial light and sunlight were equally effective in 
producing a noticeable change in the radiated energy. 

The frequency shift with variations in the tem¬ 
perature and humidity, noticed by Guyer and Austin, 
might be accounted for by, 

(a) temperature and humidity changes affecting 
the dielectric constant of the condenser (air being 
the dielectric), and 

(b) temperature changes conceivably affecting 
the diameter of the heavy copper v;ire (used for coils 
and wiring) sufficiently to cause a noticeable fre¬ 
quency change. 

The phenomenon observed by West is, however, not 
so easily explained; in fact, that visible light can 
in any v/ay affect the generation of electromagnetic 
waves of such a different frequency is almost incon¬ 
ceivable. Imagine for a moment, however, that some

part of the transmitter is absorbing energy from 
the incident light and emitting it at the wave¬ 
length at which the oscillator is v/orking (in V/est’s 
case, 5,17 meters)* This would explain West’s ob¬ 
servations, and would be classified as a fluorescent 
effect. In fluorescence, a molecule (or single atom) 
absorbs light at one frequency and emits it at the 
same or some other frequency. In this case we might 
imagine the re-emission to be occurring at a lov/er 
frequency. For this absorption and re-radiation to 
take place, the absorbing molecule must have a char¬ 
acteristic frequency corresponding to the absorbed 
light and a characteristic frequency corresponding 
to that of the re-radiation. But even the molecular 
rotation and vibration spectra do not give wave¬ 
lengths longer than the long infra-red --- certainly 

none in the vicinity of 5 meters - and therefore 

molecular absorption and re-radiation cannot be used 
to explain West’s results. So that, on modern theories 
of physics, the results which West claimed to have 
obtained are quite inexplicable. 

Hence it was decided to repeat the experiments 
that C^E. V/est had conducted, and determine if his 
variations in radiation were not really due to some

Other disturbing factor, the effect of which might 
or might not have been isolated before* 

TPIE OSCILLATOR 

Since the effects mentioned above were all not¬ 
iced with the transmitters working at about five meters, 
and since there was a possibility that freciuency might 
have something to do with the results obtained, it 
was decided to build a transmitter to operate at about 
that wave-length* 

An examination of the literature revealed the 
(4) 

fact that the circuit ' ‘ shown in Figure 1 is one 
of the most stable and easily adjusted at ultra- 
high freq.uencies, and an oscillator using this cir¬ 
cuit was accordingly constructed*

The transmitter, when constructed, was found 
to oscillate very freely over the entire condenser 
scale. 

IvTEASURING TIIE WAVE-LENGTH 

To measure the wave-length of the generated 
waves, a Lecher-wire system was set up (see 
Fig. 2), and several methods of procedure were 
adopted. The condenser was inserted to tune the 
system to resonance, the resonance point being 
indicated by a kick of the plade milliammeter. 

Method 1. 

A neon glow-lamp, made by the General Electric 
Company, was suspended from the two wires and moved 
along them until a potential anti-node was reached. 
The tube then glowed brightly. A piece of wire, 
forming a short-circuiting bridge, was moved to 
various positions on the wires. When at the point 
(0,) , the tube glowed brightly as before. This in¬ 
dicated that (a) was a potential node. Moving the 
wire a centimeter or less from position (a) caused 
the tube to go out, A second wire was laid at (b)

and adjusted so that the tube still glowed brightly. 

(b) was then also a potential mode. Since the anti¬ 
node, as determined by the glov;ing tube, was nearly 

mid-way betv/een (a) and (b)-two nodes-it 

was a sumed that the distance (a) to (b) was half 
a wave-length. This distance was about five metere, 
so the complete wave-length was taken as 2 x 5 = 10 
meters. 

This value for A did not seem quite right, 
as the lengths of rods used, by comparison with the 
results of previous investigators would indicate 

a wave-length of only about half that: or five meters. 
For instance, consider the oscillator employed by 
Gill and Donaldson. They were using rods 161 cm. 
long, which gave them a v/ave-length of 8.25 meters; 
and they estimated that a reduction of X in the 
length of the rods would reduce the v;ave-length by 
about 4X. This was found by them to be roughly true 
experimentally. In our case, the rods were 86 cm. 
long; that is, X - 75 cm. The expected reduction in 
wave-length would then be 4X - 4 x 75 cm. - 3.00 
meters. In other v/ords, our transmitter might be 
expected to radiate on about 8.25 - 3.00 - 5.25 meters.

different grid-to~plate capacities of the tubes used; 
but this factor would hardly change the wave-length by 
lOO^b. 

It therefore seemed probable that there was 
something wrong with the Lecher-v/ire measurements, 
and they were accordingly repeated. 

The tube (Tj^) was placed at an antinode, and 
point (a) found as before. This time (a) was only 
some 100 cms. from T^, whereas previously it had been 
nearly 250 cms. from the tube. The second point (b) 
was found at a distance of 206 cms. from (a). 

It was decided to use a second neon tube (T^), 
which was available, and block off another half wave¬ 
length. So T2 was placed as shown, and a third 
shorting bridge adjusted at a point (c) (Fig. 3). 

It was then found that whereas distance a-b was about 
206 cms., distance b-c was about 226 cms., both dis¬ 
tances representing presumably half a wave-length. 

A fourth piece of wire was placed across the 
two Lecher wires, and v/hen adjusted to the po<gition 
(d), both tubes still glowed steadily. At this stage, 
therefore, there v;ere shorting wires at ^,b,c,d 
(presumably nodes), and neon tubes at T^^ and Tg 
(assumed to be antinodes)•

An attempt was then made to bring the wires at 
(b) and (d) together. It was found that the distance 
b-d could be decreased from its original value of 
about 20 cm. to zero, though moving the v;ires from 
(b) and (d) made the glow-tubes very unstable. That 
is to say, if the wires were in some other position 
(say b» and d^), the voltage at and Tg apparently 
dropped very nearly to the critical voltage of the 
tube. By "critical voltage" is meant the minimum 
value which will cause a discharge through the tube. 

An investigation into the voltage distribution 
along the wires was next attempted. Positions (a) 
and (b) for the shorting wires (tube as before) 
Y/ere found by adjustment. The second tube, and 
wires (c) and (d) were left off. The glow-tube 
was then moved along the wires, first tov/ards (a) 
and then towards (b) . By estimating the voltage 
from the brightness of glow of the tube, the shape 
of the voltage curve along the v/ire was plotted 
(fig. 4). An examination of this curve and of the 
ones in the succeeding figures will show that Y/hile 
none of these curves are pure sine graves, they are 
of a complex type such as would be formed by a 
number of the odd harmonics (3rd., 5th., 7th., etc.)

impressed on a fundamental sine wave. Whether 
these harmonics were actually present or not is not 
definitely assured, becau-se of the presence of other 
peculiarities in the Lecher-wire system (see next 
paragraph). 

Using two tubes and three shorting bridges, the 
bridges were placed at nodes, and the antinodes were 
examined with the neon tubes. A curve such as Figure 
5 resulted. Note that using the two tubes and three 
shorting wires gives a different distance from node 
to node than was obtained v/ith one tube and two 
bridges* It was also noticed that if the nodes were 
found at some other part of the Lecher-wire system 
(which was about ten meters long), the distance from 
node to node was different. Compare figures 4, 4a, 

5, which were obtained at different places on the 
wires. 

These results led to the belief that the neon 
tubes and shorting bridges might form resonance 
circuits superimposed on the fundamental Lecher 
wire circuit of such a character that the nodes 
varied with the part of the Lecher system upon which 
the extra circuit was imposed. 

That these glow-tubes really had some effect 

on the system was proven by noting the effect that one

glow-tube had on the other. With both tubes off 
maximum voltage points far enough so that they were 
glowing unstably, occasionally one would go out* It 
was started again by discharging on to it a small 
electrostatic charge (the operator v/ould slide on 
the floor and accumulate a charge, and.then discharge 
it on the tube by touching the glass with his finger) 
As soon as the tube burst into a glow, the second 
tube would in many cases go out. -By starting the 
second tube as the first one had been started, the 
latter would likewise go out. That is, the tubes 
had a reciprocative action. 

It was thought that the tubes might be working 
as condensers, though of course the capacity would 
be very small. The electrodes in the tubes are semi¬ 
cylinders, with a fairly large area; so to reduce 
any capacitance effect, only one of these electrodes 
was used, and for the other electrode a piece of 
wire was tied with string to the outside of the bulb, 
just touching it at the top. Any condenser effect 
was thus reduced to a negligible quantity. There 
was no perceptible improvement in the standing wave 
Bystem. Hence any effect that the tubes have on 
the oscillations must be due to their conducting 
properties. 







12 


Method 2 

For this method, one of the glow-tubes was con¬ 
nected at the end of the wires. Assuming that the neon 
tube did affect the standing waves on the wires, by 
placing it on the end a constant end effect was intro¬ 
duced, v/hich did not affect the waves on the rest of 
the wires. 

Using the shorting bridges as before, points 
were found (nodes) where the presence of these bridges 
did not cause the tube to cease glowing. By this 
method it was found possible to place the bridges 
accurately to v/ithin one or two centimeters* A 
sample of the readings obtained is as follows,- 

Dist. between 1st. and 2nd. nodes ^ 254 onis. 

" " 3nd. " Srd. ” (s^) = 35X "_ 

X ^ 506 " 

It will be noticed that this wave-length is con¬ 
siderably greater than would be indicated by the re¬ 
sults of Method 1, and is a further indication of the 
disturbing effect of the glow-tubes when placed be¬ 
tween the shorting bridges. 

Method 5 

It was thought that greater accuracy might be 
obtained by replacing the glow-tube by a thermo¬ 
galvanometer. Accordingly, a galvanometer was don- 












13 


nected across the far end of the wires* In tuning 
the circuit now, the proce^dure was to adjust the 
condenser until a maximum current flowed through 
the galvanometer. There wl.s then at this point 
a current loop, corresponding to a voltage node. 

This represented resonance for the circuit, just 
as in Method 2, where the voltage antinode at the 
end of the wires was indicated by the tube glowing. 
In this case, adjusting a shorting bridge to 
a nodal point caused an abrupt rise in galvanj- 
ometer current^ This rise was so sudden that the 
bridge was easily placed to an accuracy of a milli¬ 
meter, A piece of light string was knotted to one 
of the v;ires at the nodal point, and a second node 
was found with the bridge as before, Four of these 
points were found, and the half-wave lengths, as 
measured on the wire, all agreed to a small fraction 
of a centimeter. No attempt was made to record 
wave-lengths to an accuracy greater than one centi¬ 
meter, as such was not required; but it would 
seem quite easy to obtain wave-lengths to a milli¬ 
meter, accurately.

To determine the effect of the blocking con¬ 
denser (C, Fig. 1) on the wave-length, a number of 
measurements were made on the Lecher wires, and a 
curve was plotted of wave-lengths against condenser 
readings (Fig. 6). The shortest wave-length obtain¬ 
able was 5.01 meters, and the longest about 6.5 meters. 
To obtain longer waves, the rods v/ould have to be 
lengthened; and for shorter waves, the reverse is 
true. In the transmitter as constructed, the con¬ 
denser v;as connected to the end of the rods, but if 
there had been a need for greater variation in wave¬ 
length than was obtainable merely with the condenser, 
it could have been obtained by having the condenser 
attached to sliding clips on the rods, as the wave¬ 
lengths of the oscillations are fixed by the lengths 
of the rods, the capacity of the tube and the capacity 
of the blocking condenser. If that had been done, 
however, it should be mentioned that the overhanging 
rods would have formed a coupled circuit, which 
would have affected the frequency of the oscillations 
whehever it approached resonance with the oscillating 
circuit. 

The importance of the length of the rods in 
fixing the wave-length will be realised when we again 

mention the fact (4) that a change of Z in this length

changes the wave-length by 4X. 

Vfave-meter method 

Just after the above measurements had been taken, 
a General Radio Company wave-meter was procured. 

This wave-meter is constructed as shov/n in Fig. 7, 
consisting simply of an inductance and capacity in 
series. The range of the meter is approximately 4.5 
to 6 meters. 

As no indicator accompanies this instrument, a 
neon tube was connected across the condenser plates 
to indicate resonance. The oscillator was set going, 
and the wave-length measured with the Lecher wires. 

The result of this measurement was 5.02 meters. The 
wave-meter was then adjusted until the neon tube 
glowed most brightly. A glance at the calibration 
chart showed the condenser setting to correspond to a 

wave-length of 4.5 meters - quite a difference. 

This is another indication of the effect of the glow- 
tube on an oscillating circuit. 

Another method was then adopted. A single turn of 
wire was connected to a thermo-galvanometer and placed 
in inductive relation to the single loop on the wave- 
meter. Resonance was indicated by a very abrupt rise 
in the galvanometer reading. When the wire v/as not 
placed too close to the wave-meter coil, no perceptible

disturbing effect on the wave-meter circuit was ob¬ 
served; that is, the resonant frequency of the wave- 
meter remained for any condenser setting as indicated 
by the wave-meter chart, and was not changed to some 
other value by the proximity of the wire. This was 
checked by reading the wave-length at two points 
(5.02 and 5.32 meters), first with the Lecher wires 
and then with the wave-meter. The agreement was per¬ 
fect. 

ANTENNA OR RADIATING SYSTEM 

Replacing the Lecher v;ires, which had been loosely . 
coupled to the rods and means of a wire loop, 

and fixed upright a foot or so away from tlie transmittert 
They formed an aerial and counterpoise system. 

The oscillator was set going, and allowed to 
come to equilibrium. To measure and detect any rad¬ 
iation changes, the wavemeter and thermo-galvanometer 
were placed near enough to the aerial system to get 
a fairly large reading on the galvanometer, so that 
changes v/ould be more easily observed. Using the 
wavemeter in this way, a good idea is obtained of any 
change in radiated energy, as well as any frequency 
variation. 

A few experiments were carried out with the 
antenna and counterpoise rods. Eor instance, it was 








found that varying the distance between the tops of 
the rods (they were pivoted at the bottom) affected 
the frequency of the oscillator to some extent* 

Also, placing the rods side by side is not a very 
efficient method of obtaining good radiation* This 
is to be expected, because the magnetic and electric 
fields starting from the two rods tend to become 
cancelled (the field from one rod by the field from 

are 

the other). If the rods at right angles, the 

radiation is increased about tenfold, and remains 
approximately the same when they are placed in line. 

A long brass cylinder happened to be nearby, 
and this was placed over one of the rods to see how 
the radiation would be affected. V/ith the cylinder 
touching the rod, the radiation was considerably 
reduced* With the cylinder and rod insulated by 
means of two thicknesses of paper, the radiation 
was the same with and without the cylinder on the 
rod, and no distortion of the field was observed* 
Hence the cylinder, when insulated from the rod, 
apparently had no effect* 

It has been stated in some articles on short 
waves that aerial and counterpoise rods should be 
polished. Accordingly, a heavily insulated wire 
was substituted for one of the brass rods. There

was no noticeable decrease in radiation, 

EFFECT OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHT 

A 400-watt projection lamp was placed at the 
focus of a large reflector, and the beam of light 
turned on various parts of the transmitter. This 
was tried at different times in daylight and in the 
dark, but there was no detectable change in the 
radiation. 

Once, when the light was playing on the aerial 
system, a rise of 5-10% was observed in the galvan¬ 
ometer reading. Upon turning out the light, the 
reading slov/ly went back to normal. U en the light 
was turned on, the needle took two or three minutes 
to rise; and when the light was turned off, the needle 
fell back during two or three minutes, the movement 
being very slow. It was suspected that this might 
be a heat effect, and upon examination it was found 
that the thermo-galvanometer (which was in a black 
case) was right in the path of the beam from the 
reflector; and ?7as absorbing enough heat rays to 
cause a noticeable change in the galvanometer read¬ 
ing. 

An arc, dissipating about 400 wats, was next 
tried, as it was thought that the ultra-violet light, 
v/hich is emitted in larger quantities from an arc

than from an incandescent lamp, might cause suf¬ 
ficient ionization to affect the radiation. The 
result of this experiment was, however, negative, 
no effect being observed. 

The antenna rods were blackened with a mixture 
of pulverized carbon and oil, and light was projected 
on them. No variation in radiation occurred with 
and without light on the rods. 

EFFECT OF DAYLIGET 

Following an experimental method of V/est, a 
flashlight bulb was used for the wavemeter indicator 
instead of the galvanometer. The oscillator was set 
going in daylight, the ¥;avemeter placed at such a 
distance from the transmitter that the bulb glowed 
very faintly, and the aj^paratus left until about an 
hour after dark. At that time the bulb showed as 
much light as ever. There had not been any par¬ 
ticular drop in radiation with the going down of the 
sun. This was repeated several times, without any 
change being observed* 

NEW TRiiNSMITTER BUILT 

\lhen illuminating the oscillator with the in¬ 
candescent lamp, it was noifc possible to focus the 
beam on more than a small section of it at one time, 
because of its extended construction, necessitated

by the long straight rods. It was therefore decided 
to build a more compact transmitter. 

The second transmitter employed two coils about 
8 cm. in diameter, of 1-|- turns each, instead of the 
two rods previously used. The circuit was essri^tiaily 
the same as before, except that the negative of the 
filament^was connected to t e negative of the plate 
supply, (i nstead of 1/(t the positive ) This transmitter, 
like the first one, oscillated freely over the whole 
condenser scale, the minimum wavelength obtainable 
(about 4.6 meters) being slightly lower than Irith 
Oscillator #1. 

FURTHER SXPERILIENTS WITH LIGHT 

Using the nev/ transmitter, the effect of light 
was tried as before, but no difference could be de¬ 
tected between radiation in a beam of light and rad¬ 
iation in the dark. 

The experiments up to this point had all been 
carried out in a building #iich is of steel con¬ 
struction, and in a room which is therefore prac¬ 
tically surrounded by steel. Although no reason 
was apparent why the surrounding metal should can¬ 
cel any light effect, such an effect itself is 
inexplicable, and therefore the apparatus was moved 
to another building. This building is of wood and 













and well away from most of the other University 
buildings, so it answered the purpose admirably 


21 


As a further improvement, a vernier device was 
put on the waveraeter condenser, to make sure that 
absolute resonance was actually being obtained. This 
is really necessary at 5 meters, because the reson¬ 
ance curve is very steep* The capacity effect of 
the human body affects the wavemeter quite considerably, 
so an extension system, by means of which the wave- 
meter could be accurately tuned v/ith the observer 
several feet away, was also attached* For a des¬ 
cription of these attachments see Figure 8. 

The oscillator was started up one afternoon at 
about two o’clock, and readings were taken for several 
hours* Table I shows the results obtained. It will 
be noticed that there was a gradual drop as the day 
wore on.

and the galvanometer watched for any variation. No 
change was noticed until the 300-watt lamp (now being 

used instead of a 400-v/att) v/as placed very near- 

almost touching - the plate and grid coils. The 

result of this v;as a gradual increase in wave-length 
of the oscillations as the coils heated up, but there 
was no increase in radiated energy, as nearly as could 
be determined. This increase in wave-length is pro¬ 
bably due to expansion of the coils under the action 
of heat. 

It was next decided to make an all-day run of the 
transmitter, from before sunrise till after sunset, 
as it was thought that this would bring out clearly 
any diurnal variation in radiation. Accordingly, such 
a run v/as made. Readings were taken at intervals of 
from ten minutes to about half an hour, from 6:30 B.M.+o

An examination of the graph shows a drop till a 
little while after sunrise, a fairly steady line 
during the day, and the beginning of a rise again 
after sunset. That is, instead of an increase in 
radiation with daylight, this graph would indicate 
the reverse to be true. 

Another interesting observation is that at 6.50 
A.M. and at 10:00 A^M. the plate readings v/ere both 
30.7, but the radiation was much different in the two 
cases. Also, comparing the readings at 10:00 A.M. 
and 6:00 P.M., the one with the larger radiation had 
a low^er plate current, the wave-length being the same 
in the two cases. 

An afternoon run was again made and continued 
until after 8:00 P.M., to determine if the radiation 
would increase with night-fall, as might be expected 
from Figure 9, No particular increase was, however, 
noted. 

A further series of observations, over a whole 
day, were taken, this time from 6:20 -^.M. till 7:20 
P.M. Fignre 10 shows the results of this run 
graphically.

Cn the same sheet v/ill be noticed another curve 
for an afternoon run taken the following day. 

Several more runs were made, but the results 
were not definite enough to warrant the formation 
of any conclusions either for or against diurnal 
variations, 

VARIATION OF RADIATED EilERGY Y/ITEI INPUT VAKIATIONS 

It was then decided to exaraine the effect on 
radiated energy of changes in the input, to de¬ 
termine if such changes might be large enough to 
account for the fluctuations in output. 

The filament current and plate voltage - both 

from storage battery supply - had been kept as con¬ 

stant as possible, the variation being determined by 
the accuracy v/ith which the plate TOltmeter and 
filament ammeter could be read. It was estimated that 
the potential could be read to within one volt, and 
the current to within 2/100 of an ampere. Using 
235 volts on the plate, with a possible variation of 
plus or minus one volt; and v/ith 1.60 amperes on the 
filament, plus or minus less than 2/100 ampere, the 
variation in voltage would be maximum, and in 

amperage 2,505b, maximum, or a total expected variation 
in input of 3,355^, 








No data on the operation of the 205 D vacuum 
tube was on hand, but information available re¬ 
garding another tube (UX 210) employing an oxide- 
coated filament, shov/ed that for this tube a var¬ 
iation of about 5^ from rated filament voltage 
(corresponding to about the same variation from 
rated current) caused a >^ariation in output of not 
more than 1^. The UX 210 was operating in this 
case at rated plate voltage. The 205 D was running 
at considerably under rated voltage (235 instead of 
350). This fact should tend to make a variation of 
filament current for the tube used cause even a 
smaller variation in output than is (quoted above 
for the UX 210, for the reasons given in the next 
paragraph. 

If the plate voltage is sufficient to cause 
nearly all of the electrons emitted from the filament 
to go to the plate a slight increase in filament 
current, resulting in increased electron emission, 
should result in an increased plate current (hence 
greater radiation), due to nearly all the extra 
emitted electrons feeing attracted to the plate. If, 
however, the voltage is considerably below the sat-

all the emitted electrons; and an increased electron 
emission will therefore affect the plate current con¬ 
siderably less than in the first case discussed, be¬ 
cause the plate voltage is not in a position to take 
full advantage of the extra electron emission. 

However, we may make allowances for the dif¬ 
ferences in construction of the UX 210 and the 205 D, 
and assume that changes in filament current will 
affect our tube, not less, but more (say five times 
as much] than the 210 was affected in the case quoted. 
That is, assume that the radiation of the circuit 
using the 205 D is affected five times as much as 
the radiation of the circuit which used the UX 210. 

We then reach the conclusion that a 2^/o variation 
in filament current should not affect the output by 
more than 

In the case of plate voltage variations, the 
limit was only about 0.85^, and we should not ex¬ 
pect this to affect the output by more than two or 
three percent, if as much as that* 

From the above discussion, it will be seen 
that the fluctuations in output due to input variations 
were not expected to be more than 5^. Such var¬ 
iations would not account for the changes in rad¬ 
iation as actually found to occur, so to make 

quite sijire that nothing was being overlooked, it 




27 


it v/as decided to measure experimentally the rad¬ 


iation changes with different input values. 

number of readings were taken and two graphs 


plotted, one of radiation against filament current 
(plate voltage ■ onstant), and the other of radiation 
againslTplate voltage (filament current constant). 

See Figures 11 and 12. The latter graph was about 
as expected, but the former v/as somewhat startling. 

A change of in filament current (from the normal 
value) gives rise to a change in radiation of 13.6%. 
That is, our expected error in filament input was 2i%; 
and this v/ould, on the basis of Figure 12, give us 
a difference in radiation of about 27%. 

In the light of this information, no faith 
could be placed in the curves obtained of diurnal 
variation of radiation, and additional runs v/ere 
therefore made using an improved techniq.ue. 


IIvIFROVED IvETIIOD OF KSEPINa IPPUT CONSTANT 


It was first necessary to obtain a more accurate 
method of keeping the filament current constant. 

This v/as accomplished by,- 

(1) pasting a duplicate scale on the glass 
above the ammeter scale, to avoid parallax, 

(2) reading the meter with a magnifying glass, 

fixed above the meter,_^and _ - _ -

(3) using a rheostat of two resistances in 
parallel, one resistance being about five ohms, and 
the other about 100 ohms. 

To take a reading, the observer moved his head 
to and fro until his right eye was in such a position 
that the two scales appeared to coincide; and then he 
brought the needle to the line on the scale indicating 
1,60 amps, (which was the current used, being the 
normal value for the tube). A rough adjustment was 
obtained with the low resistance, and a fine adjust¬ 
ment with the high resistance. 

By this method, it was estimated that the current 
could be kept constant with an error not greater 
than 0.001 ampere. This corresponds to a variation 
in output of 1.4^ (see Fig. 11)o By exercising 
more care in reading the plate voltmeter, variation 
due to this cause could be kept within one volt 
(corresponding to an output change of about 2fo) , so 
that the total variation in radiation due to input 
changes could noly be kept within about 3-|^. 

It is felt that previous investigators in this 
field have probably not paid sufficient attention 
to the fluctuations mentioned above and for which 
corrections were subsequently mdde; so that some 
of the effects which have been noticed were in all 







probability really due to this cause. 

CHECKS ON DITONAL VAKIATION OF iLaDIATION 

With possible errors now inside reasonable 
limits, another afternoon run was made. Figure 13 
shows the result of this run, and indicates that 
there was a slight drop near sunset, though the 
esti lated possible error would about cover this 
variation. 

Accordingly, to see if there were really a drop 
dur to the rising of the sun, as was indicated by 
the first all-day run (Fig. 9), the oscillator was 
started just after midnight and allowed to run until 
ten o’clock in the morning. The graph of this is 
given in Fig. 15, and shows that the radiation was 
practically constant for the whole period. 

To make a final check on any sunset effect, 
a run was made just before noon. A graph of this 
I run is on Fig. 14. 

AFFECT OF TEIvIPERATURE CHANaSS 

It will be noticed (Fig. 14) that the radiation 
steadily increased over a period of three hours, 
i This increase was observed while the run was in 
I progress, and an explanation was sought. It had 
; been noticed that the temperature near the oscil¬ 
lator was going up slowly, and in the period,

; twelve o’clock to three o’clock, the increase was 
some ten degrees centigrade* The idea suggested 
itself that temperature might be the disturbing 
factor, and to test it out the door was opened. 

The room temperature rapidly dropped, and as it 
did so, the radiation dropped likewise. A drop of 
20^ C. caused a decrease in radiation of from 64 
to 44, wave-meter galvanometer readings, or a drop 
I of 31^. 

It might be mentioned here that rising tem¬ 
perature had been checked against radiation once be¬ 
fore, but this T/as done prior to the improved tech¬ 
nique, and no connection between the two had been 
observed. The reason must be of course that such 
effect was obscured by the fluctuations due to var- 
j iations in input. 

j It was thought that the observed variation in 

j output due to temperature changes might be accounted 
I for by one of two things: the thermo-galvanometer 
I might possibly be affected by the temperature drop, 

I and might be indicating a radiation drop where none 
existed; or, in view of the great sensitivity of 
I the output to slight changes in filament current 
; (and therefore filament temperature), a change in the 
temperature surrounding the vacuum tube might be 










affecting the output to the extent observed in the 
experiment* 

To check the first possibility, the oscillator 
was set going, and the reading of the galvanometer 
noted* The case of the galvanometer was insulated 
from temperature changes by packing it around with 
cotton batting, and the temperature of the room 
was varied some 20^ C* The galvanometer reading 
was found to fluctuate as it had done before* 

Keeping the temperature of the room constant, 
the 300-watt lamp was placed against the galvanometer 
and the outside of the cotton now surrounding the 
case heated 25^c.o3? so above the temperature of the 
room* Practically no increase in the reading took 
place. This demonstrated that the indicating in¬ 
strument was not responsible for the observed fluc¬ 
tuations. 

To determine if the temperature surrounding 
the vacuum tube were the important factor, the 300- 
watt lamp was placed near the tube. The galvanometer 
reading began almost immediatd.y to increase, going 
up steadiy as the surrounding air heated up. Upon 
removing the lamp, the reading dropped again* This 
was tried several times, with identical results*

It thus seems apparent that all variations 
in output noticed in the course of these experiments 
may be ascribed to one factor, namely, the abnormal 
sensitivity of the vacuum tube to small changes in 
filament temperature. These changes in filament 
temperature were caused by, first, small fluctuations 
in filament current, and second, changes in room 
temperature. 

FURTFIER STUDY OF SENSITIVITY OF OSCILIATOR TO INPUT 

VARIATIONS 

It was then decided to investigate further the 
peculiar way in which the radiation responded to 
such small changes in filament current, to ascertain 
if such were due to the very high frequency of the 
I oscillations or merely to some peculiarity of the 
I vacuum tube employed. 

Accordingly, an oscillator was constructed, 
using the familiar Hartley circuit (see Rig. 21}, 
which oscillated from about 75 meters to 200 meters. 

■ Curves were then plotted of radiation against fil- 
: ament cin^rent for two wave-lengths, one about 80 
meters and the other about 190 meters. Two other 

' 205 D tubes were procured,and similar curves for 

1 

I these plotted at 5, 80 and 190 meters. These six 
curves are shown on Figures 16,17 and 18. The

; vacuum tube which had been used throughout the ex¬ 
periments, and which has had the greatest number of 
hours service is called Tube #1* Tube #2 has not had 
quite as much wear as #1, and Tube #3 is new. 

Referring to the graphs, the following points 
may be noted: 

1* Each curve has a steep portion, which for 
the older tubes is at a higher value of filament 
current. Remembering that these filaments are 
oxide-coated, this simply means that as a tube ages, 
a higher filament temperature is required for a 
given electron emission. Therefore, if an exper¬ 
imenter requires his output to be independent of 
small filament changes, it is not sufficient to 
work at rated current, unless he is sure that this 
value of current is on the flat part of the Radiation 

- Filament temperature curve. With a new tube 

rated filament current is good enough, but with an 
: old tube, it is not. 

; 2. The shape and position of these curves are 

j not independent of frequency. The 190 meter curves 
; are flatter, and in general give a greater radiation 
for a given filament current. The 80 meter curves 
I have a part of their length where they are steeper 
I than the others. This fact is brought out by the

curves of Figure 19, which are the slopes of the 
Radiation-filament-teraperature curves plotted against 
temperature* The 5 meter curves have a tendency to 
be concave downward over their whole course, while 
the other curves have each a point of inflexion* 

These facts are interesting, though of no par¬ 
ticular practical importance if the tubes are operated 
on the flat part of the curves, since here the dif¬ 
ferent wave-lengths give coincident curves* 

FREQUSNCY VARIATIONS WITH FimiSNT CURKSI^ CKAMGES 

The subject of the freQ.uency of a triode os¬ 
cillator and its dependence on filament current and 
plate voltage has recently been thoroughly studied 
by several investigators • It has been shown that 
for some values of plate voltage, grid voltage and 
filament current, small changes in these quantities 
lead to large frequency variations. For other values, 
the variations are negligible. 

Upon varying the plate voltage of our five- 
j meter oscillator from 218 to 253, a very slight in- 
: crease in wave-length was noted at the higher vol¬ 
tages. Over the entire range of filament current, 
however, no detectable wave-length change was found, 
j Henceg, for the_oscillator_as_used_in_this_research^_ 

(8) Se^llartyn, Phil. Mas.^TNov. 27., who has sat- 
isfactorily explained these variations*

the frequency changes duB to filament and plate 
input variations were negligible. This means that 
the transmitter was operating on the flat parts of 
D.l'o Ilartyn’s frequency variation curves* 

OF RESULTS 

1. Contrary to C.K. West’s results, light has 
been found to have no perceptible effect on 5-meter 
radio waves. Ilis results may be explained in tv;o 
ways: 

a. The importance of input variations was pos¬ 
sibly not fully recognized, and he was unv/ittingly 
working on the steep part of the Radiation-filament- 
current curve. 

b* The temperature of the environment varied 
considerably, and the result was the same as if the 
input had fluctuated in value. YiTest’s transmitter 
v/as probably exposed to sunlight, so that in the middle 
of the day the temperature and radiation v/ere at a 
maiimum, while towards evening they dropped off to 
j a minimum. This seems likely, since West found that 
in using artificial light he had to have a parabolic 
reflector almost enclosing the oscillator; that is, 
he had to heat up the vacuum tube to get his supposed . 
j ’’light effects*^. 













2. It has been found that the viriation of 
radiated energy with filament uui’rent fluctuations 
may be very considerable, even when working at the 
rated value of filament current. 

It is thus shown that it is important in cer¬ 
tain cases to make sure that the tube is operating 
on the flat part of the Radiation-filament-current 
curve.

Pi\RT B; The Generation of Tfaves Shorter than Five 
Meters# 

INTRODUCTION 

The production of continuous electromagnetic 
waves, of length about the order of one meter or less, 
is of i iportance for two reasons; in the first place, 
a study of the properties of these very short radio 
waves is of considerable interest in itself; and 
secondly, by their aid, it is possible to investi¬ 
gate certain theories as to the constitution of matter; 
for example, the Debye dipole theory has been, and is 
now being investigated by this method# 

‘i'hese very short waves have been produced by 
several groups of investigators, located in Germany, 

Japan and England.Their results v/ere, however, 
obtained with tubes whose construction is somewhat 
different from those commonly psed on this continent; 
and it was thought worth while to investigate the 
possibilities of the low-power vacuum tubes which 
a,re available here, to try out different circuits, and 
deterraine what might be done v/ith them in producing these

The chief difference between the foreign and 
our own tubes is that the former have the plate, and 
very often the grid leads brought out through horns 
in the side of the glass. The latter, on the other 
hand, have the plate and grid leads running side by 
side to the base. The result is that the leads in 
our own tubes are longer, and the plate-to-grid 
capacity is considerably higher. Hence, these tubes 

I on account of their higher internal inductance and 

i 

I capacity, are not as well suited for short-wave 

} 

; production as those of foreign make. But in any 
! case, it was decided to see what could be do‘Qi with 
I them.

As a starting point the circuit used in os-

and grid rods were succe:ssively shortened, until the 
, set refused to oscillate further. It was found that 
different-sized choke coils had to be used to main- 
! tain the strongest oscillations at any particular 
wave-length^ Table I giving the values which have

The limit of this circuit seemed to be about 
2,0 meters. Below that^point the oscillations were 
very feeble, and were not detectable at 1.9 meters. 

At this stage the length of the rods was about 8cms. 

Several 205 D vacuum tubes were tried in the 
above circuit but there was not much difference in 
their behaviour. 

A U V 202 was next used, and was found to go 
dovm to about 1.7 meters, below which point it Y/ould 
not oscillate stably. 

CIRCUIT EIvIPLOYINa ELECTROSTATIC COUPLINa 

The circuit shown in Figure 22 was next tried. 

This circuit was designed to utilize electrostatic 
coupling in the tube between the plate and grid; but 
it is to be noted that with our tubes some magnetic 
coupling between the plate and grid leads is un¬ 
avoidable, as they parallel each other through the 
tube base,

This circuit gave much stronger oscillations 
than the previous one; and it was possible to go down 
to about 1.6 meters with it. 

CIRCUIT OF EARKlIiiUSSN AID ICURZ 

TRe circuit (see Rig. 23) of Barlihausen and Kurz 

( 12 ) 

has been used for the production of waves as short 
as 24 cm., so an attempt was made to obtain oscil¬ 
lations by this method. 

It will be observed that this circuit has a high 

positive potential on the grid, and a negative po- 

tnetial on the plate, instead of the usual arrangement. 

The oscillations take place between the plate and the 

grid, and are independent of the external circuit. 

C13) 

Schebe ' found, however, that by coupling to the 
tubej^circuit consisting of two parallel wires, shunted 

-fo 

by a bridge and connectedy^plate and grid, respec¬ 
tively, a considerable increase in the strength of the 
oscillations occurred. For certain positions of the 
bridge the radio-frequency current was a maximum, 
i It was also found that, whereas the plate milliam- 
meter in general shov/ed no deflection, when maximum 
; oscillation current occurred the plate current rose

I to quite a pronounced value* The plate current may 
then be used as a measure of the strength of the 
"Barkhausen - Kurz" oscillations, as these have been 
named. 

Using this circuit, therefore the bridge was 
moved along the v/ires, and the plate milliammeter 
watched for any deflection. At one point a slight 
movement of the needle was observed, the grid volt- 
I age being about 90 and the plate voltage zero. This 
indicated that weak oscillations were occurring , 
but attempts to strengthen them by readjusting the > 
bridge failed. Other plate and grid voltages were 
tried, but no better resuitswere obtained, so it 
was decided to leave this circuit and try to develop 
the electrostatic coupling method further. 

PRODUCTION 0? EAPllONICS . 

Since the limit of the electrostatic coupling 
method appeared to be about 1.6 meters, it was de¬ 
cided to attempt to increase the harmonics generated, 
to see if they could be made strong enough to be 
utilizable. 

As increased plate voltage is usually successful 
in bringing out the harmonics, th.’ s method was tried, 
with a large grid bias being employed to keep down 
the plate current.

For reception of these short waves, as well as 
for their measurement on Lecher '‘^ires (see page44) 
it is desirable to have the radio frequency output 
modulated to an audio-frequency note. 

It, therefore, seemed possible that both these 
functions (first, production of harmonics; second, 
modulation of output) might be performed by using 
an alternating poirential on the plate, either alone 
or in series with the normal D,C. val\>e, Ihe second 
method has most to commend it, and therefore the 
normal value of 360 volts D.C, was used, with 100 
volts, 200 cycles, in series with it. 

To measure the harmonics, an antenna made up of 
telescoping brass rods with a thermo-galvanometer in 
the middle, was constructed and connected to the 
oscillating circuit in the manner shown in Figure 21, 
This type of antenna should pick up most energy from 
the mian circuit when it is half a wave-length long. 
The voltage distribution is then as shown in the 
diagram. It was thought that as the length of the 
antenna was successively lengthened or shortened a 
series of maxima v/ould occur in the galvanometer 
readings, as the antenna-length became a half-wave 
for each of the harmonics.

I Upon taking a number oij'readings, however, it 

was fo nd that maximum current occurred v/hen the 
antenna was about 53 cm. long (see Fig, 24). The 
current dropped off gradually as the antenna was 
shortened or lengthened from this value and no oth-r 
maxima at all were detectable. From this result we 
might be led to believe that the fundamental WQve- 

our 

length was 2x53 - 106 cms (assumingj^half-wave antenna 
to be working properly as such), and that the harmonics 
were all so weak as to be negligible, However, the 
wave-length had just previously been measured on the 
Lecher-wires as 183 cms., so something seemed wrong. 

It might be well here to mention how, in this case, 
the Lecher|\measurements had been made. 

Iki^CHER-UIRS 11SASUREI.IBNTS 

The shortest wave-lengths obtained in this re¬ 
search had not been measured directly but had been 
approximated by extrapolation on an improvised wave- 
meter. At the lowest wave-length reached, however, 
i it was desirable to obtain an absolute measurement 
of the wave. 

It “’as not possible to use the thermo-galvan- 
I ometer method with the Lecher-wires as insufficeint 
radio-frequency energy v;as produced to give a good 
galvanometer reading. Hence a vacuum tube detector,

(See ffig. 25), was used as an indicator. This ex¬ 
plains one of the reasons why a modulated radio¬ 
frequency current was desired, as mentioned on page (4X \ 
Using the^condenser at the generator end of the 
Lecher vmres, the system was tuned to give a maiiimum 
noise in the phones. A shorting bridge was u ed, 
j as in the previous measurements, to indicate points 
of minimum voltage, at which points the noise in the 
phones was a maximum. The nodes were not well de- 

! 

fined, however, and although ty/o half-waves v/ere 
picked out, one 92 cms. and the other 91 cms. 1 ng, 
it was felt that the resultant wave-length (183 cms.) 
might possibli^ be in error.

Since the Lecher-wires gave the wave-length as

I decided to investigate the ws^ve-length and the pro-

I therefore, it is possible to measure wave-lengths 
v/ith an accuracy dependent upon the sharpness of 
the resonance curve. 

'For the linear oscillat6vn the telescoping 
antenna, with the galvanometer in the center was used; 
and a straight piere of wire, 53 cm. long, was con¬ 
nected to the transmitter for the radiating system. 

The oscillator was started, the telescoping rod 
placed about 30 cm. from the antenna, and a resonance 
curve for the rod was plotted (see Fig. 24). The 
peak of the curve corresponded to the rod length of 
76-|- cms., which represents a wave-length of 1.61 
meters. The harmonics were searched for by contin¬ 
uously shortening the rod, but for lengths corres¬ 
ponding to hal^ a wave-length for the various har¬ 
monics, no trace of maxima occurred in the galvan¬ 
ometer readings. 

It v/as therefore concluded that the fundamental 
wave-length was 1.61 meters, and that the harmonics

observed. It was tliought that this might be due merely 
to the increased voltage, which would occur for the 
peaks, though the average voltage would be the B.c. 
value. If increased voltage v/ere the determining 
factor, therefore, a direct voltage equal to the peak 
value of the plus D.C. should result in even 

greater radiation than the combination voltage, 
since the higher voltage is then continuously sus¬ 
tained instead of being reached only momentarily 
two hundred times a second. 

Accordingly a direct voltage was applied to the 
plate equal to the peak voltage previously used. 

The resulting antenna current was not as great as 
before, instead of being greater. 

Follov/ing this a number of readings were taken 
of antenna current corresponding to different com¬ 
binations of and D.C. plate supply. Curves 

were plotted, which are shoYm on Figure 20. The 
curves represent the follov7ing plate combinations,—

peak values of a.C.

voltage, on the antenna current, the total peak 
voltage being kept constant at 430* 

^hese graphs indicate that a combination of A.C. 
and D.C. plate supply produces considerably stronger 
oscillations than does pure D.C. on the plate. It 
also appears that the proportion of ^^,0, to D.c. 
is of importance, there being a certain value of A.C. 
for a given peak voltage which will give best results. 

To bring out the effect of combination plate 
supply in a slightly different way, the dimensions 
of the oscillator were reduced till with pure D.C. 
on the plate the circuit would not oscillate at 
all. Upon using a combination, however, strong 
oscillations again occurred. 

It was observed, too, that even when oscillations 
■could be produced with D.C. alone, they v/ere not 
as stable as with D.C. plus A.C* That is, any dis¬ 
turbing influence in the proximity of the oscillator, 
such as a wave-meter or the human hand^would cause 
the plate milliammeter to go up as much as 10 milli- 
amperes^and sometimes cause oscillations to cease 
entirely. V/ith D.C, plus -^.C,, however, such in¬ 
fluences affected the meter by only a milliarapere 
or so, and the oscillations were not easily damped 
out.

SmUvIARY OF RESULTS 


!• Several short wave circuits have been in¬ 
vestigated, using two types of vacuum tubes, the 
205 D and the UV 202<, It appears as though the 
^electrostatic coupling” circuit will give best 
results with these tubes. The lov;est wave-length 
attained with pure C.G. supply was about 1.61 meters. 

2<, The discovery has been made that a com¬ 
bination of A.G. and B.G, on the plate of the vacuum 
tube is much more effective in producing very short 
waves than is pure D.C. The oscillations produced 
are stronger and more stable, and it is possible 
to go to lower limits with this combination than 
with the ordinary method. 

In conclusion, the author wishes to thank 
Dr. H.J. I'lacleod for his help and a number of 
suggestions which he made during the course of this 
I research. 

AcknoY/ledgement is also made to the National 
Research Goimcil for a Bursary under which the above 
work was carried out.

NOTE 1 

Further work which was carried out after the 
completion of this thesis showed that curve P. , Pig. 20, 
Plate.XII was in error, as it should lie above and not 
Ibelow cur-ve E. Therefore, with the ranges of A.C. and 
Id. C. so far employed, we are not yet justified in 
'assuming that the curve of output against different 

I 

proportions of A.C. has a maximum point, as would be 

iindicated by Pig. 26, Plate XII.

! 

Experiments which have just been performed with 
160 cycle as well as 200 cycle A.C. seem to show that 
; frequency may be of some importance in using combinations 
I of A.C. and D.C. plate supply, as the §00 cycle curves 
indicate a slightly gneater output than the 60 cycle 
ones. 

Hov/ever, these and other matters are now being 
investigated by the v/riter, and will be cleared up in 


due course.
