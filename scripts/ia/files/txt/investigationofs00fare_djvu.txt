CHAPTER I 


THE PR0BLEI4 AND ITS LIMITS 

The unrestricted pass mark in Grade Nine 

I 

!Social Studies is a B standing. The examining 

I 

I board determines this pass mark by assuming that 
jwithin;-' fairl3r narrow limits a given percentage 
I of the candidates will receive a grading below B. 
iExperience has shown that 30% of the candidates 
jfall below the B rating. The lower limit of the B 
I group is determined by graphing the scores of a 

I 

I selected sample of 1,000 papers, and transmuting 

I these scores to a range of zero to one hundred. 

i 

(All candidates whose transmuted score was below 

I 

45 received a grading of C or less. The 
examination^ board have selected specific city 
and to^vn schools which they consider t^^'pical, and 

a fixed proportion of the sample of 1,000 cases is 
drawn from these schools. Every tenth paper from 

rural schools is selected to make up the balance. 
For the examination in Social Studies written in 
June, 194^, the raw score at the lower limit of 
the B zone was 43 marks out of a possible mark 


1 






V 




2 


of 100. 

The purpose of the following study was 
to determine the level of achievement of those 
candidates who were placed at the lower limit of 
the B group by a process of statistical measure- 
jment. The level of achievementto be expressed 
as objectively as possible, in order that it may 
be compared with the level achieved by candidates 
who receive the sajne statistical grade at a 
future examination. Such comparisons at periodic 
intervals will indicate, within broad limits, 

■whether the pass mark is, in fact, remaining 
constant. 

Since the material outlined in the 

Course of Studies for Grade IX is suggestive and 
Inot prescriptive, and since the body of material 
used aa a basis for study is not standard in all 
classrooms, it was not practicable to express the 

level of achievement in terms of definite percentages 
of the factual material, vocabulary, and general¬ 
izations covered by the course. The study will 


show what details of the course were actually tested,

and, by extension, the extent to which the general 
objectives of the course have been tested. The 
sources of the details tested by examination will 
|be shown, in order to indicate the adequacy of the 

jprescribed minimum library. The analysis of 

! 

candidates^ responses will include the percentage 

of correct responses made on each objective item; 

j 

‘the distribution of errors; the extent of the 
errors which were made. 

The quantitative averages will not be 
used to determine to what degree the six general 
aims of the course have been realized. The 
examination paper is not designed to measure in 
quantitative terms the progress made toward the 

realization of general objectives. In other words,the 
study is non-statistical. Its purpose is to des- 
cribe to what extent the details of the test paper 

were mastered by the average candidate. Nothing 
more precise than an arithmetical average is used 
throughout. There is no attempt to claim validity 

or reliability for these results. The results 
should be viewed as a description of the average

CHAPTER II 
RELATED STUDIES 

A number of investigations to determine 
achievement of candidates on Social Studies 
examinations set by the Alberta Department of 
Education have already been carried out. Although 
no study has been confined to the determination of 
the pass standard set by a specific group of B 
students, certain general conclusions v/ere reached 

by these studies. These conclusions v^lll be found 
useful in checking the findings of this more 

restricted, but more detailed, investigation. 

Mr. Edwardh^s general conclusions v/hich 

relate to achievement in Social Studies 3, were , 

t 

|in part, as follows: 

i 

I 

j (1) The knowledge of Canadian history was 
j very inadequate. 

(2) The knowledge of the three groups (B, 

C, D) appeared to be vague and unrelated. 

(3) All groups did better than average on the 
essay question. 

(4) Questions such as "multiple choice" and

matching ones, in which the student did 
not have to write his ideas, achieved a 
higher attainment, not only this, but 
they encouraged guessing, 

(5) The students appeared to have a super- 

I ficial knowledge of events. Although in 

i 

! 

i many cases they had memorized certain 

i 

I facts, they seemed unaware of the casual 

! nature of event^, 

j Mr, Edwardh’ study gives no detailed 

analysis of errors, and these general conclusions 

j are based on the percentage of correct responses. 

I 

I Mr, Watkin*s^ study is related directly 

to achievement in Grade IX Social Studies, His 
general conclusions regarding student mastery of 
the course content follow: 

’^The standard of achievement is highest 
on problems - which have a very definite 

ccirelation with Science, Health, or Junior 
Business^^,

^^Prohlems dealing with current history- 
rank second in achievement^^. 

”The problem constituting a review of the 
Morld economic and geographic factors ranks third.^ 
^^Poorest achievement is found on purely

^^historical^ material. This part covers Canadian 
and British history, and consequently it is of 

primary importance”. 

The following quantitative scores on the 
objectives of the course of studies in use in Alberta 

schools in 1941 Wert given by Mr. Watkin-^* The questions 
were assigned to a given objective if the material 
tested, was in large part related to the general area 
with which the objective is concerned. 

I An analysis of six hundred answer papers 

dravm from the whole range of marks gave the 
following percentage of marks attained.

The objectives of the 1941 course are as 

[follows: 

I (1) To facilitate an understanding of our social 

i 

! and economic realities; in other words to 

( acquaint the students with enough historical 
and geographical facts to enable them to 
comprehend at their level our present-day 
economic and political institutions and 
practices, (ranked fourth, score 3^*3%)

(2) To develop the ability to see both sides 

of the question, and to think independently 
on the basis of facts. (Ranked fifth; score

(3) To induce an attitude of fair-mindedness, 
and a desire to co-operate with others in 
the welfare of the community, (ranked third 

score 44.0/^) 

(4) To train students in the use of efficient 
methods for securing and organizing 

information that is available in reference 
books, atlases and charts; and to extend 
their use of such tools as pictures, 
diagrams, maps, graphs and statistical 
data. (Ranked first; score 5^.3^) 

(5) To develop an appreciation of Canadian 
culture. (Ranked last; not tested) 

(6) To make clear to students the effect of 

mechanization on the production of goods 

and services, and on developments in 
transportation and communication.(Ranked

(7) To help students understand the 

contributions of explorers, frontiers¬ 
men and statesmen to the grovjth and 
development of Canada and the British 
Commonwealth; and to understand the con¬ 
tribution made by Canada to the trade of 
the Commonwealth and the World. (Ranked 
seventh; score 23.5%) 

{S) To foster an attitude of tolerance and 
respect for world peoples, and a sym¬ 
pathetic understanding of their social and 
economic problems. (Ranked sixth; score 
31 . 6 /.) 

Mr. Watkin comments on these general results^ 

^^Best results are being achieved on the objectives ... 
involving the teaching of ;. factual material. 

^Independent thinking, or reasoning ability 
ranks second .. .. 

"Poorest results are found on the objectives 
relating specifically to Canada".

Discussing the testing of objectives, Mr, 
Burke points out that the 1941 examination paper in 

Social Studies 3 over-stressed factual material^, 

^^^hat only one objective (the accumulation 
of factual material) is measured. 

”That the paper does nothing to defeat the 
^^craramer^^, but, rather, his activity is encouraged 
Mr, Barones general conclusions regarding 
the quality of answers in Grade Xli are as follov7s:7 
^General knowledge of historical detail 
increases with proximit^^ in time.” 

^Knowledge of Canadian History appears to 

be poor.” 

”l/^here the student is not required to write 
out his statements or ideas, greater success is 

achieved.” 


”Graph reading is ”easy” provided that no 
recall of detail is necessary.”

in industrialized Canada. 

To develop the ability for critical thinking 
about social problems. 

To foster an appreciation of our Canadian 
heritage of free institutions and the 
democratic way of life. 

To inculcate ideals of conduct, attitudes 
and beliefs suited to a democracy v/ith a 
Christian background. 

To promote an understanding of other peoples, 
their problems and viewpoints. 

To facilitate the growth of skill in using 
social studies material such as source books, 
maps, charts, etc.

Current Events 


(1) To introduce to students outstanding persons 
in the news. 

(2) To extend knowledge of places around which 
current interest has focussed attention 
during the year. 

(3) (In bold-face type) To understand that a 
current event is frequently symptomatic of 
an underlying social problem not yet solved. 

(4) To learn to read the daily newspaper critically 
and with wider understanding.

CHAPTER III 

HOW THE DATA TORE SECURED 
Three hundred examination papers were 
selected. The minimum raw score for a B standing in 
Social Studies was 43. All papers written in June, 

I 194@ which received a raw score of 43 were selected. 

I Every third paper of raw score 44 was selected 

! 

1 until a total of 300 papers was obtained. There were 

235 papers with a raw score of 44. Table IV shows the 
distribution of raw scores in the selected sample.

I to fill in all blanks. The same condition holds true 
I of question 10, where 20 blanks are provided, but only 
; 14 are to be filled. The examiner‘ gave credit for 


I the first 20 responses in question 1, and for the 

I first 14 responses in question 10. For the purposes 

[ 

j of this study a correct response was credited wherever 

I 

I it was given by the candidate. ViHiere mechanical errors 

i 

were made by the markers, these were ignored. The 
candidate was credited with the response actually made, 


I and no attempt was made to determine what the raw 

I score for any given paper should have been if no 

I 

j mechanical marking errors had occurred. 


j In every case, except in questions 1 and 

I 10, the possible aggregate is taken as 300 correct 

! responses, per item. 

In question 1, 120 candidates answered 
more than the required 20 items. It was assumed that 

these candidates attempted 2^ items. Therefore, the 
possible aggregate for question 1 was taken to be

(120 X 2^) plus (1^0 X 20) equals 6,960 responses. 
Similarly in question 10 the possible aggregate was 

taken to be (124 x 20) plus (176' X 14) equals 
4,944 responses. 

In order to give credit for partial accuracy, 
a schedule of reasonable responses was drawn up for 

certain items in questions 4 and 6(b). k reasonable 
response is one which is not absurd or contradictory. 
Those responses v/hich were clearly absurd or con-» 

tradictory were termed guesswork. 

The follov/ing excerpt from the examination 
will serve to explain the meaning of the letters

is a polar projection with 24 meridians labelled 
from A to X.

The itemized tabulation of additional 
creditable responses and the categories under which 

they are credited is given in Appendix V, 

Reasonable responses are not used in com- 
puting the initial over-all achievement on factual 
items, but they are useful in indicating the extent 

of pure guessworks 

The examination paper was compared with 
the course outline to determine the extent of coverage 
of the material outlined and of the immediate problem 
objectives. The course of study is divided into 
seven major problems, and each of these is divided 

into sub-topics. Table VII shows the marks allotted 
to each sub-topic of the course.

Each of the 7 major problems in the course 
of study has a number of immediate objectives. The 
extent to which the examination paper tests these 
objectives even in part, is given in Table XI,^

to be made regarding the mastery of the material 
outlined under any one of the major problems* 

No statement can be made concerning the measure 
of achievement on any of the objectives listed 
for the individual problems. 

For example, problem II lists 40 areas 
of study, but only 7 of these are touched upon by 
the examination paper. These 7 areas are not tested 
in a detailed manner. Therefore, in Table XI the 
problem objectives are listed as being tested in 
part. 

The adequacy of the prescribed minimum 
library as a source of factual material required 
to ansv/er the items on the examination paper is 
indicated by Table XII.

It should be noted that one topic listed 


for the essay in question eleven is covered by the 
special bulletin ”0n The Alberta Health Horizon” 
issued by the provincial Department of Health. This 
bulletin is probabl 3 ^ available in a majority of Alberta 
classrooms. 

The factual material required by question 
four is fully covered in Denton and Lord’s geography. 

















- 35 - 


The type of map used, the polar projection, is 
specifically prescribed for problem VII of the 
course, while the great circle concept involving 
shortest air-routes over the poles is central 
to the whole problem outlined under part VII. 

It is entirely probable that the few gaps in 
text book coverage were filled in by 
specialized drills on these points.

CHAPTER IV 

THE ORGANIZATION OF THE DATA 

The objective items on the examination 
paper are grouped under four main headings: 

(a) Factual material which could be answered by- 
memory, and which could have been acquired by drill 
and summarization of text-book material* (b) Items 
testing the understanding of specific technical 
terms, (c) Items testing the application of 
generalizations to a given problem. (d) Current 
events which could not have been prepared for by 
drills* 

There is considerable overlapping in 
this classification because of the wording of the 
items. For example, item nine of question 6(b) 
asks the candidate to locate, on the map provided, 
a port famous for nitrates. This item can be 
answered from memory as a fact in commercial 
geography. It belongs therefore, under classification, 
(a) The technical term, port, limits the range of 
possible answers, and, therefore, the item appears 
ander classification (b). The nature of the product, 
















- 37 - 

nitrates, demands that it be located in a dry area. 
For this reason the item is included under class¬ 
ification (c). It cannot be determined from 
evidence on any individual paper whether or not 
the student considered the qualifying force of the 
technical term, and the generalisation, in 
answering correctly. This study will assume that 
the student, when answering correctly, understood 
the significance of all the words contained in 
the item. 

The items relating to factual material 
are further subdivided into historical and 
geographical items. The historical items are 
defined for the purpose of this dbudy as those 
items which require a knoxfledge of past events, at 
least on the level of recognition and recall. These 
events are such that they would not likely be found 
in the reading of daily press or current periodicals. 
Historical items are grouped in the analysis as 
biographical, political, chronological and mis¬ 
cellaneous items. Biographical items are those in 
which any personas name is mentioned. If the item

involves time sense, the item is classed as 
chronological. Items concerned with political 
institutions or international relations are 
grouped as political-historical items. A mis¬ 
cellaneous group serves to cover items not 
applicable to the other sub-classifications. 

The geographical items are subdivided 
into four groups. Those items which ask the 
student to locate a country, city or area named 
in the item are grouped under place location(map). 
Items locating areas according to altitude, 
vegetatioh, etc. are grouped under physical 
geography. Items locating exports are grouped 
under commercial geography. Items dealing with 
climate, seasonal changes, and time zones are 
grouped under general geography. 

The technical terms contained in the 
examination items are grouped into political, 
economic, scientific, geographical, and sociolog¬ 
ical classifications. Certain items in question 
three and question eight are included although they 
are not used in any answer. The assumption is made

that a candidate who left these items blank, 
or unused, did so because he knew the terms did 
not apply to the data given. Only those terms 
which qualified the choice of a correct answer 
were included. For example, in question two the 
first item reads, ”The Statute of Westminster was 
signed’^. Statute is clearly a technical term, 
but taken by itself in this particular instance, 
its meaning does not assist in selecting the 
correct response. It was not included in the 
list for that reason. Item four of question two 
reads, ^^Woraen were given franchise in England 
Since this item cannot be answered intelligently 
without understanding the term franchise, this 
item was included under the classification, 
technical terms, political. 

The generalizations involved are not as 
clear cut as they should be for an accurate 
measurement of the group’s achievement in applying 
generalizations to particular problems. Items 
dealing with standard time, seasonal changes and 
commercial geography were selected because they 














- 40 - 

are most clearly designed to test the application 
of generalizations. 

The complete analysis of the objective 
items is given in Appendix IV. The following table 
shows the achievement of the group according to the 
proposed classification. Percentages show only 
correct responses. No adjustment has been made at 
this point for answers which are partially correct.

CHAPTER V 

ACHIEVfflENT IN FACTUAL MATERIAL 

From Table XV we find that on the basis of 
correct responses the achievement of the group was 
43•5^ in factual material dram from history, 54*1^ 
in factual material drawn from current events, and 
35 * 25 ? in factual material drawn from geography. The 
average raw score on the 300 papers without deducting 
spelling errors was 47.9^ 

i “ Biographical Facts 
The percentage of correct responses on 33 
items was 51*^^. Twenty-eight of the 33 items are 
concentrated into question 1, A full measure of the 
knowledge of the group cannot be given because only 20 
items had to be answered. It is probable that rel~ 
atively few additional correct responses would have 
been given if all candidates had,attempted 2^ items, 
because only 7 candidates made full marks on 
question 1. 

The items in question 1 can be grouped into 
3 areas of cultural activity. The invention of

Five items from question 2 contain names 
of persons, but knovnledge about the man is not 
essential to the correct placing of the event in 
historical time. The name could, however, be used 
by the critical student as additional evidence for 
determining the answer. 

For these 5 items the correct response 
was given in 15.7^ of the cases. The total of 
non-attempts for these items Vv^as 736 or 49.2^ of 
the possible aggregate. The correct response for 
the whole of question 2 was 15.3?^, while the correct 
response for the non-biographical items was 15.1fo. 
The biographical clue did almost nothing tovmrds 
raising achievement on chronological items. 

ii - Chronologi cal Facts 
If question 2 is judged purely/' as a test 
of time sense, the achievement is extremely low. 
Correct responses averaged 15.3^. The examiner 
assumed that the time sequence in Canadian history 
was well known. The evidence of previous invest¬ 
igations into achievement in Social Studies in the 
province makes the assumption a rash one. The low 





: 4 ' 












- 4 ^ - 

percentage of correct scores may indicate that the 
periods chosen were not well known. The class¬ 
ification of errors shows that except for very 
recent items the sense of depth in past time is not 
at all acute. This is brought out clearly in Table 
XX.

responses were one period removed, that is in

answers were one period removed from the correct 
period, but in the case of 6 out of 12 items there 
were two periods which have to be accounted for, 
one before and one after the correct time period. 
The general vagueness of the time sense 
is also shown by the fact that 15 of the l6 items 
























- 49 - 

were placed in each of the seven possible time 
periods. 

The distribution of errors does show 
some grasp of chronology for which the markers 
could not give credit. Nine items show a definite 
symmetry of responses about the correct period. 

The responses for item two will illustrate the 
extent of this symmetry which shows an idea of 
chronological time not precise enough to receive 
credit. The correct response is 2*

iii ~ Political Facts 
It is possible that question two could 
have been considered by the candidate as an 


itemization of a series of political facts. Two of 
the items relating to Burma and Ceylon were recent 
enough to be studied on the current events program. 

























- 50- 


The remaining 14 items are studied in connection 
with political history. The achievement of the 
group was 13.0 per cent as compared with 15.3 per 
cent on question 2 as a whole. The lack of orien¬ 
tation is particularly significant in that S of 
the items are concerned with the progressive 
evolution of the British parliamentary system and 
of dominion status^ The percentage achievement on 
these S items was 14.25^. It cannot be assumed that 

i 

this figure represents an accurate measurement of 

the group^s understanding of how self- government 

grew, but it does show that few candidates were able 

no use a systematic outline of political develop- 
! 

ment as an aid to correct chronological arrangement 
of the items. For example, ^7 candidates answered 
that women received the franchise before the B.N.A. 
Act was passed. This figure represents 53f» of the 
attempts made on item 4. Again, 11$ of the responses 
jto item 16 showed Canada refusing to accept 
reciprocity from United States before the passing of 
the B.N.A. Act. The correct responses to item l6 
totalled only Vi$ of the attempts on that item.

The examination did not provide any direct 
need for reproducing political historical facts* 

By inference from question two it would appear that 
the group as a whole has only a slight command of 
political facts when required to use them as a 
means for solving a specific problem. 

Miscellaneous Facts 
Question 9 deals v/ith the conduct of a 
public meeting under rules of parliamentary pro¬ 
cedure. The achievement of the group on these 
five items was well above the average for the whole 
paper (59.1^ as compared to 47.9?^). The most sig¬ 
nificant item was item 5 concerning the role of the 
chairman. The emphasis in Social Studies methodology 
is on group procedure of a democratic nature. Only 
22$ answered this item correctly, but 37^ considered 
it the chairman^s duty to lead the discussion. This 
suggests that the idea that the chairman plays a 
I dominant role in group work is widespread. 

iv - Current Events Material 
An extract from Table XV shows the achieve¬ 
ment on current events was as follows: 













- 52 - 


Items Correct Percentage 

44 6573 54.1 

This achievement was higher than that on 
any other group of factual items, and was above the 
achievement for the whole paper. The significance 
of the identification of photos is hard to establish. 
It appears to be an index familiarity with news¬ 
papers and magazines through an emphasis on eye- 
mindedness. The result shows that the habit of 
looking at the newspaper has been established. But 
no attempt was made to test what ideas had been 
formed about the reasons why these persons were 
j worth knov/ing, Wcien this superficial test is 
i eliminated the achievement in current events is sub-

One item, number 20, in question 6(b) was 
devoted to current events (Location of Dominion of 
Pakistan) l6l correct responses were given, and an 
additional 55 responses placed Pakistan in the general 
area of India. 

Question 7 dealt specifically with, current 




















- 33 - 

problems in inter-national relations. The examiners 
were lenient, in that they accepted any relevant 
statement of fact, or any current opinion as an 
argument. The pattern of achievement scores throws 
some light on the attitudes of the group,

in the pupilmind about basic forces and issues 
in world relations. The word most commonly used 
to describe groups of persons acting for or against 
peace was simply ^^people^^. Russia was named 
specifically as an obstacle to realizing disarma¬ 
ment, as a potent objector to a permanent military 
union of Britain and America. Otherwise the 
language of the candidates was not specific; 
distinct areas, nations, pressure groups, and 
traditions in international relations were not 
named, much less discussed. The whole question was 
answered by what can be described only as a 
fumbling attempt. 

Question ^ was designed to test the 
significance which the candidates attached to 
specific news items. On 13 items the correct res¬ 
ponses totaled 55/J of the possible aggregate. 

Five items were not relevant to any situation listed 
in column A of question and should have been left 
blank. The group left these items blank in 49.55^ 
of the cases. The following table shows the most

Two items in question 2 v/ere concerned with 
the recent change in status of Ceylon and Burma. 

The results show that almost one-third of the can¬ 
didates realized that self government has been 
broadened in the British Empire since 1939.

the lack of mastery of chronology shown by question

Items 9 and 10 of question 4 are unsuitable 
because the places named are not on the map provided. 

The pupil has to project both map and meridian to 
arrive at a correct solution. Adjusting for 12 
items, and adding 103 correct responses for item 3, 
j question 6 (b), (testing for Asia), the percentage of 
correct responses is raised to 40.3• The best item 
vv/as a Canadian item (Great Bear Lqke). The poorest 
item concerned the International Date Line(abstraction), 
The difficulty experienced in question 4 should not 
have been increased by the use of the polar projec- 
tion map, because this map is specified for use in 
problem VII of the course. Moreover, none of the 
basic texts uses such a projection. The areas 
shown makes Europe and Asia appear as an indeter- 
minate mass. It would appear from the very small 
sampling which the examiination effected that the

The errors listed in Table XXVI show con-= 


fusion concerning the objective facts about seasonal 
changes in the southern hemisphere. There is a lack 
of clarity concerning the conditions necessary to 
produce prevailing winds and rainy seasons. Since 
only three alternatives were offered the average of 
correct responses on the bases of chance should be 
100. The actual average for the 5 items was 139.

When credit is given for a reasonable 
answer, the percentage of admissible responses is 
49.5^ of the possible aggregate, and 56*6^ of the 
attempts actually made. The group^s grasp of de¬ 
tailed fact xfas not sufficient to allow the can¬ 
didates to answer the items with the degree of 
precision (recognition of a labelled area) which 
the examination demanded.

The examination items in this category 
required careful study to enable a correct response 
to be made. The distribution of staple raw materials 
was most thoroughly tested. The ^ items show an 
average of 160 guessed answers per item. This score 
indicates that a significant percentage of the can¬ 
didates are answering from rote memory, and that they 
make no use of basic facts of commercial and indust¬ 
rial geography to assist them in determination of 
productive areas for specific products.

for item ten (an area producing great numbers of 
beef cattle) was as follows:

Item 10 was selected for detailed analysis 
because ranching is a part of the Albertan enviro- 
ment and, therefore, to a certain degree familiar to 
the candidates. When an unfamiliar agricultural 
environment is selected for study, the amount of 
guessing increases. Items 11 and 12 deal with the 
location of areas producing palm oil and bananas. 
Combining the responses for the 2 items, it was 
found that ^5 correct responses were given, 352 
responses placed the areas within the tropical zone, 
and 17^ responses placed the areas outside the 
tropics. Therefore less than one-quarter of the 
group which recognized palm oil and bananas as 
tropical products could locate them properly within 
the tropical zone. There appeared to be a general, 
idea about the tropics as an area different from the 
temperate zones in temperature and rainfall, but 
there was strong evidence that the tropical zone is 
undifferentiated within its limits, according to the 
ideas of the candidates. Some evidence in support 
of this statement is given in the Table below:

Objective III Appreciation of Canadian heritage 
of free democratic institutions: 

This objective was very lightly tested. The 
chronological arrangement of items in question two 
throws some light on the group^s grasp of the 
order of development of these institutions. Taking 

5 

the responses of the group as a whole for the eight 
items concerned, only 14.2^ of the responses placed 
these items in their proper time period. 

When the individual papers were checked for 
the achievement on the 8 items dealing with demo¬ 
cratic institutions, the following information 
appeared:

Thus only 1^ of the 300 candidates could 
place correctly four or more of these items. The 
result of this check on individual achievement made 
it clear that most candidates had an inadequate 
grasp of thi^ steps by which democratic institutions 
developed. Such development is clearly a part of 
our democratic heritage. The extent of the dis¬ 
orientation was emphasized by the glaring errors.

as a problem-maker for peaceful nations. Too little

was tested to enable any rating to be made on this 
Objective. 

Objective VI - Use of maps, charts and source- 
books. 

Map mastery, at the level of recognition of 
labelled areas was tested. An organized idea of the 
hemisphere, climatic zones, vegetation 3ones and wind 
belts was not shown by more than tv/o-thirds of the 
candidates. No definite statement can be made as to 
what the group could find on a fully detailed map, 
but the inference v/as clear that a great majority 
would not know what to look for, nor where the con¬ 
centrate their search. It was clear from question 
2 that time charts have not been used enough to 
become functional in the candidates’ thinking. 

The fact that seventy-five out of a hundred 
marks on the paper couM have been earned by a care¬ 
ful study of text book material means that the can¬ 
didates could obtain a B standing by earning slightly 
under two-thirds of these marks. There appeared to 
be a premium on text-book study, memorization of bits 
and pieces of factual detail, and note-taking. 










- go 


The strong emphasis on text-book material does

CHAPTER VI 

ACHIHVEPIENT OH TECHNICAL TERJHS 

The percentage of correct responses for 
49 items containing technical terms was 42.5'^. The 
items selected were those in which the technical 
term was vital to the selection of a correct res¬ 
ponse. A detailed list of the 49 items and their 
associated terms is given in Appendix IV. 

From selected items in questions 4 and 
6 (b) a further study of tei?ms can be made.

Responses were classed as not admissible 
on the following bases: 

(1) Tropical: North of the Tropic of Cancer; 

South of the Tropic of Capricorn 

(2) Jungle ~ As above - but restricted to wet 

lowland areas, 

(3) Tundra - Restricted to arctic or sub-arctic 

areas, 

(4) Port - Obviously inland 

(3)Southern North of the equator as marked on 
Hemisphere - the map, 

t6)Eastern Restricted to meridians east of 
Hemisphere - 0° (G) and west of 180°(S) 

The fact that 34.55^ of the responses were 
inadmissible shows that the candidates were not. 
using these terras to limit the range of possible 
answers. Since these terms are simple and basic, the 
implication was that examination excitement prevented 
the pupil from examining the test item and their 
response critically, or that the habit of using 
terms precisely has not been established; There 
was an error in the map used in question 6 (b), 
















- ^3 - 

when the correct response accepted for item seven 
was actually in the northern hemisphere (J). No 
dodbt this error added to the general confusion. 

Question 3 shows that about 50 candidates 
did not realize that a given term cannot have two 
separate and destinct definitions. The number of 
duplications appearing on the 300 papers was 62. 

The results of questions 3, 4, and 6(b) 
cast doubt on the ability of the group to use 
critical thinking when faced v«rith an examination 
problem. 

Adding those responses from the selected 
items in Table XLII which were incorrect as to fact, 
but admissible on the basis of the understanding 
of technical terms involved, the percentage of 
achievement is raised to 46^.

The examination of errors on items con¬ 


taining technical terms v/hich appeared in questions 
other than question 3 leads to the conclusion that 
many errors were made because of careless and in¬ 
complete reading, of the item« The best evidence is 
given by a comparison of the errors made in question 
6(b) on the items dealing with ports and exports as 
shown in the following table:

The variation in correctness in dealing with 
ports suggests that the term was skipped over in the 
reading, while the close correspondence in dealing 
v/ith exports suggests that the term was noted and 
considered when selecting the response. 

Therefore the results of items containing 
technical terms can be considered as indicating 
comprehension of the meaning of the terms used only 
when the attention of the candidates is forcibly 
drawn to the term as was the case in question 3. 

The percentage of correct responses here was 55%^ 
Because of reading errors tM'B figure will be used as 
the indicated achievement of the group on comprehension

of technical terms. The balance of the items 
serve to indicate the uncritical thinking of the 
candidates as a group.

CHAPTER VII 

THE ACHIEVE'MENT ON GENERALIZATIONS 

To arrive at a quantitative measurement 
of the achievement of the group on generalizations , 

26 items containing clearly defined generalizations 
from geography were selected from questions four 
and six. The percentage of correct responses to 
these items was 29.3^. The generalizations involved 
are given in Appendix IV. 

The extent to v/hich the correct general¬ 
izations have been made is not fully shown by the 
percentage of correct responses. A study of the 
errors made on each item shows more clearly what 
generalizations have been made, and in some instances 
the error is such that it shows that no generalization, 
has been made. 

The following detailed analysis of the 
responses made to item one of question 4 will serve 
to illustrate how the data for Table XLVI were 
secured. From the table of generalizations in 
Appendix IV the following information can be secured; 
Generalization, short title and Item. 












- - 

Generalization number 1 is as follows: 
Zero degrees longitude is a base line, arbitrarily- 
selected for convenience, from which to measure 
standard time, and geographical position east and 
west. Short title, ^measurement’^, Question 4, 
item 1, 

The following responses indicate that 
generalization number one was made, although the 
actual selection made was not always correct,

The map provided in question 6(b) was 
drawn on a very small scale. It was possible to 
take any of the indicating lines as being specific, 
or merely as pointing out a general area. For 
example, L could have been taken as ^outh Africa 
in general, as the South African veldt, or as the 
Kalihari desert. P could have been taken as Chile, 
Valparaiso, or the Andes mountain chain. R could 
have been taken as the coastal ]plain of Honduras, 
as the intermediate temperate area, or as the moun¬ 
tainous area of Central America. The possibilities 
of various interpretations, all of which have been 
allowedjexplains the apparent contradictions con¬ 
tained in Table XLVII. The map suffers from a lack 
of objectivity. 

There is no evidence that the items which were 
not attempted were left blank because of shortage of 
time. Some students prefer not to make wild guesses. 

The generalizations listed above, if made, would be 
expected to lead the candidates to make an attempt 
rather than leave a blank.

ment on generalizations are summarized below:

CHAPTER VIII 
THE CONTENT OF THE ESSAYS 
The first topic in Question 5 was ^^¥hat 
the School Does For Modern Society^’^. Fifteen essays 
were selected which had received the average mark 
of 5. Nine of the essays stressed what the school 
does for the individual, and only inferred what 
benefits the school confers on society. Only one 
essay showed that the writer was aware that the 
proper relationship of the school and society was 
a pressing present-day problem. 

The following table shows the kinds of 
detail that were used in developing the topic.

There were many differences in the over¬ 
all quality of the essays. The following essay is the 
poorest one of the selected group from the standpoint 
of English usage and facility of expression. It is 
quoted to show the minimum achievement which was 
allowed to earn a B standing. The follov/ing is a 
verbatim transcript of the v/ritten work of candidate 
#4421: 

^^ipJhat the School does for Modern Saceity. 

The school in Canada, United States and forgein 
country's have been a great help to modern society. 

By biulding school it does not only learn 
people but also keeps youngsters and older children 
off streets and from turning juviniles. Schools also 
prepare childern for working jobs in later years such 
as lawyers, doctors, etc, and also severl other trades 
The building of schools has been done for the children 
to modernize them and learn them to carry on in social 
and public life. Schoels is one of the best societys 
ever found

This essay is admittedly below average in 
English, but the details used, and their development 
is typical of the essays as a whole. 

The second topic in question 5 is ”How 
Music Helps to Break Down Racial Prejudice^^. Seven 
essays were read. The marks assigned were 4 and 5- 
The essays as a group stressed that music is enjoyed 
by all, and that musical talent in production and 
composition has been displa^^ed* by individuals from 
every race and of every nationality. The end 
product of musical appreciation is often a higher 
regard for the way of life of people who are 
different from ourselves. The following table 
gives the frequency of details used in developing 
the topic.

ago is till in use in some countries. These are 
mostly great syrnphanies written by prominent men. 

Men such as Schubert are still very prominent in the 
world of music, and will continue to be for some 
time. So through the world of music a lot of racial 
prejudice has been broken down’^. 

(Mark assigned: 5) 

Note that only one specific name has been 
identified, that of Schubert. 

The third topic in Question 5 is "l^Jhy a 
Modern Community Should Provide Opportunities for 
Expression Through Drama”. Fourteen essays were 
read which were assigned a mark of 5 or 4 by the 
examiners. One essay was completely off the subject. 
The development of latent talents was stressed along 
with the development of facility in the use of 
language and the development of self-confidence, in 
the individual. The emphasis was laid upon drama as 
a service that should be provided by the community 
for the individual member. The following table shows

poorest of the selected essays in this group. The 
examiner gave it 4 marks. 

^^In this modern world things are changing 
very fast, nev; inventions and new improvements in 
life. So if a community is to keep up with modern

this. One way is to have dramas or plays to v/hich 
people enjoy and take interest to^ Communities 
before doing this must be well organized to take 
opportunity that arrises. These would the city 
home and the farm. Through drama country folks 
could gain knowledge how to raise better crops, 
newer ways of farming and better methods. To the 
city people drama would show opportunities in 
business jobs which may deal with local affairs as 
well as abroad.’^ 

The fourth topic in question 5 was ^^The' 
Importance of Religious Faith in the Attainment of 
Individual HappinessThe result of the survey 
of 22 essays with the mark of 5 and 6 shov/s that the 
subject was given a varied treatment. Most can¬ 
didates stressed the importance of going to Church, 
rather than the importance of religious faith. 

Twelve candidates did not discuss faith at all, but 
did discuss membership in a cburch-going group. The

relevant details;

mentioned. In order to give a clearer picture of 
the quality of the essays, 3 of them are given in 
full below. 

Candidate #3076 (6 Marks) 

^^Religious faith is something that most 
individuals want, but can not obtain it. If it is 
obtained in the very early stage will play an im¬ 
portant part of one^s happiness. Some people have 
not yet had the slighest idea how religion may 
over come their trans-gressions. IJhen one decides 
to go through Christian Bible School, it is off 
faith which help him to go through this work. Also 
those having the habit of drinking, it may be over¬ 
come by attending church and believing in faith. 

When one^s life grows dim the importance 
of religious faith should be at hand to guide him 
were ever he believed in.'^ 

Candidate #579^ (5 Marks) 

'•All people are religious in there own way.

not be happy or have fun if they had to go by some 
one else^s religion. People do not all think the

same of it. Some will not go to a movie and are 
happy by being that wa^^ while others would say you 
could not have fun if you didn’t. It is the same 
with dancing and gambling in any way such as at the 
races of any kind. Some attend church every Sun¬ 
day and give a share of their earnings while others 
go the odd time and give but are yet happy in their 
ways. No matter what you believe you can always 
get individual happiness.” 

Candidate #52Sl (6 Marks) 

”Vifhen v/e first go to church no matter what 
religion we learn who our Gretor is and the rules 
he want us to obey in other words, ten conmients. 

(Do not steal - obey parnets, protect neighbors 
property, do onto to other as you would have them 
do onto you,” All rules in Church are very necessary 
in life of a community. ¥e have to believe the thing 
that science has not solved by spirital means. Waen 
we learn and obey all rules in church we will have 
no jails and inform schools. We will have less 
worries and be happier. We believe that the Lord 
love all races and symapathize our fellowmen. 








- 106 - 


Religion makes each individual happy, which in turn 
makes a happy nation^^. 

The topics in question 11 were taken 
directly from problem 5. The great majority selected 
topic one (209). The first topic was ^How modern 
conveniences are relieving women from much of the 
drudgery of housework.’^ The candidates were directed 
to follow the plan given below: 

Title 

^Paragraph 1 should describe conditions as they were 
in the past. Paragraph 2 should show the situation 
as it is now, because men have tried to attack their 
social problems intelligently. Paragraph 3 should 
suggest the possibilities for further improvement 
in social living.” 

Fifteen essays with a mark of nine were 

t 

read. The emphasis on mechanical labor-saving 
devices i-^^as overwhelming. The past was pictured as 
drab and much more backward than our parents would 
care to admit. Most of the candidates could see no 
limits to the possibility of improvements through 
science and invention. The reader is left with the

The essay written by candidate #5241 is 


quoted below. The essay is typical as far as devel- 
oprnent of the topic is concerned, but the English 
is below average to a small extent, (9 Marks) 




















10 ^ 


^^How Modern Conveniences are Relieving Women from 
much of the Drudger^'- of Housework^M 

^^Living conditions in the past years were 
very bad for example. There were no electrical 
equipment (lights stoves etc) Light was optained 
from a candle or lamp. Water was carried a great 
distance from a dirt^^ well. The food was cooked 
over an open fire. There was no beds. The people 
slept on a pile of straw. Washing was done by hand. 

Today mb have electric lightsj stoves 
refrigiators, irons, washing machines, vaccum 
cleaners, running water, air conditioning everything 
that could be wished for. 

In the future 3 /ears the housewife will have 
more and more things to help her in her household 
chores. Work which is work now will be play tomorrow 
if science keeps on inventing knew and more help ful 
workers. 

The second topic v/as ^Recreation for the 
Whole Family^M Twelve papers were read with marks 
of eight or nine assigned by the examiner. Only one 
paper suggested that modern forms of recreation were 
splitting up the family. The essays as a group laid 












- 109 “ 


strong emphasis upon providing playgrounds and 
communitj^ centres where individuals could find the 
type of recreation that he enjoys most. The

Candidate #1352 received eight marks for 


the following essay, which is typical of the twelve

essa^^s which were read. 

^^Recreation for the whole Famil}^’' 

^^Lcng ago the fathers and mothers had no 
time to play and fun with their, children. The 
children had to play i\dth their friends, and if they 
live far away from the people they have to play 
alone. 

Now adays the parents don^t have to work so 
hard so they can devote part of their time to 
recreation. Some of the kinds of recreation is: 
gulfing and pla^/ing ball. They could go on hikes, 
or swimming. There are quite afew parks to take 
children around to. If the parents are busy the 
children usuall37- have some kind of toys to amuse 
themselves with. One of the most pleasantest things 
a family could do is go on a sight seeing trip. You 
could go to the lake of beach or even to the country. 

In the future the parents will be able to 
devote more time to recreation than they do now. 

There mil be new parks being built so that the 
children and parents can see and enjoy.

The third topic in question 11 was ^^Health 
Services in Alberta'^ Ten essays were read. Again, 
in this group, past conditions were described as 
being very bad. The essays, as a group, emphasized 
the improvement in training of doctors and nurses, 
the advances made in scientific treatment, in pro¬ 
viding equipment, and in developing preventive 
drugs. The emphasis for the future was on greater 
availibility through mobile clinics and govenment 
hospitals in, rural areas. The following table shov/s

The following essay received 9 marks. 

This essay is more objective than the majority of 
those which were read. 

Candidate #6431 

^^Health Services in Alberta^’ 

^^The health conditions of the past have been 
poor in Alberta due to the lack of doctors, medical 
eo^uipment, and hospitals. The doctor in the community 
had to go around to the homes and inspect the health 
conditions. 

At the present, people needing medical 
attention are taken into a modern hospital or sanit- 
orium to be treated with up-to-date medical instru¬ 
ments and medicine used by a well educated doctor. 

Now, different doctors specialize on certain diseases, 
or an organ of the body. V/ith the use of sceintific 
inventions the diseases are prevented by vaccination 
which is one more advantage of our modern health 
system. 

In the time to come, with the help of more 
sceintific expiriments and inventions, the health 
conditions in Alberta are promised to be much better 







- 113 


than they are now. If more vaccines are made and 
put into use it will greatly reduce and greatly 
improve health conditions. 

The content of the essays which received 
average marks shows that the candidates have certain 
glaring deficiencies. Their cormiiand of English is 
not complete enough to allow them to express their 
ideas clearly and distinctly. The ideas themselves 
are not clear-cut. The language is non-specific 
and full of generalities. The past is looked upon 
as an era of almost primitive backwardness, while the 
present is accepted quite uncritically as an obvious 
improvement. The future holds the promise of un¬ 
bounded progress based on scientific advancement. 

This lack of objectivity and critical mindedness 
shows that these candidates have not yet achieved any 

( 

Iclear understanding of their cultural heritage or the 
world in which they live. Only two essays suggested 
that an3^ serious problems remain to be solved, and 
none suggested that future society might not be able 
to solve them satisfactorily. The content of the 
essays suggests that only a bare beginning has been 












- 114 - 

made toward achieving the general objective of an 
understanding of social life in industrialized 
Canada and an appreciation of our Canadian heritage* 
The lack of precision in factual detail, coupled 
with an inability to express themselves clearly, 
would suggest that these candidates cannot yet do 
any critical thinking about social problems. It 
is clear from an examination of individual papers 
that certain candidates did in fact receive a B 
grading without showing evidence of critical 
thinking in answering the essay question. The 
essays quoted speak for themselves on this point. 

The following table is a summary of the 
I incidence of the principal deficiencies discussed 
in the previous paragraphs. The total number of 
essays checked for questions 5 and S was 95• By 
extension it may be inferred that the number of 
essays considered to be adequate is the reverse of 
the following tabulation.

SUMI4ARY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS 
Sximmary 

The quantitative measures of achievement 
based on the responses to objective items are given 
in Table LVII. The final measures of achievement in 
factual material are obtained by averaging the per¬ 
centages listed in Table XXXVII.

PERCENTAGE OF POSSIBLE ACHIEVSl^/IMT 


Historical fact

Technical terms 

55.0% 

Generalizations 

k5.1% 


The final score for technical terms was 
taken from the results of question 3, because the 
other items were not emphatically directed toward 
a consideration of the terms involved. That the 
reading of the candidates was faulty is objectively 
shown by the fact that l\.0fo of them failed to follow 



















- 117 - 

the limitation set in the directions to questions 
1 and 10. Since it appeared impossible to dis- 
entangle reading oversights from misunderstanding 
of the terms involved, only question 3 was retained 
as an index of achievement on technical terms. 

The positive measure of achievement in 
making correct generalizations was made up from 
subject matter in geography. Certain other 

I 

evidence should be added to indicate the broad 
generalizations that the candidates made in other 
fields. It is clear from questions 1 and 11 that 
the importance of science, especially in the field 
of mechanical invention, is clearly grasped by the 
majority of candidates. There is little evidence 
- to show that they have grasped the social implica¬ 
tions of the scientific advances, except that we 

! 

depend on modern transportation and communication 
for the smooth working of our industrialized society, 
Generalization concerning other people and our re¬ 
lations with them as far as question 7 indicates, 
has been too broad to allow any real objectivity. 

The same tendiancy toward over-simplicati6n is 










- llg - 


reflected in the responses dealing v/ith the physical 
and commercial geography of the tropics and the 
southern hemisphere.

General Conclusions 

lo The border-line B student is handicapped 

in expressing his ideas by a lack of mastery of 
English. 

2. He has not learned to use all the data 
given on an examination. 

3. He has insufficient command of factual 
material to alloxY him to check the accuracy of his 
responses. 

4. The habit of critical examination of the 
selection of a correct response is not established. 
Slightly over half the responses were not critically 
examined. 

5. Orientation in respect to past events, and 
their order of occurrence is the weakest point in 
the achievement. 

6. Current events which are symptomatic of 
unsolved problems are not as well mastered as are 
the names of persons and places, the significance 
of which was not tested, 

7. The investigation bears out the weakness in 
Canadian and British history, as far as the border- 







f* 






- 122 


line B students are concerned, xvhich other in¬ 
vestigations have emphasized. 

The results of this investigation shovf 
that the border-line B student has made very slight 
progress toward achieving the general objectives. 

The following reasons are given in support of this 
statement: 

(a) There is an over-emphasis on scientific 

invention, and an under emphasis on the 

social problems faced by an industrialized 
society, 

(b) Lack of factual knowledge about Canadian 
and British history.makes any real 
appreciation of our Canadian heritage 
unlikely, 

(c) The frequency of guessing coupled with the 
large number of absurd responses shows 
that critical thinking is not being done on 
the problems posed by the examination itself, 

(d) The skill of the candidates in using maps, 
as shovm by their attempts to interpret the 
maps on the examination paper, is not highly 

developed.

(e) The results obtained from question 7 

indicates a l^ck of lastual detail about 
international problems* 

9. The essay questions show that the candidates 

have an emphatic belief that communities must, and 
can, work together for more comfortable homes, im¬ 
proved community services, and broader horizons for 
all. The underlying philosophy of a Christian and 
democratic society accepted by the candidates. 

Implications 

In order that a comparative study can be 
made at a later date, it is suggested that an exam- 

f 

ination strictly comparable to the 194^ paper be 

designed with the same weight given.toleach category 

; 

of objective items. 

It is suggested further that the marking 
s^T-stem be extended to give a bonus for critical 
responses and a penalt^r for patently absurd responses. 
The follov/ing concrete application of the 
last suggestion is offered for the last 2 items of 
question 4*

Items both correct - bonus 3 

Items reversed - bonus 2 

Items misplaced - bonus 1 

Miscell8n.eous responses- 0 

Adjacent meridians 

selected - penalty 1 

Identical meridian 

selected - penalty 2 

Such an extension of marking, where 
complete objectivity is possible, would give 
proper weight to the ability to do critical 
thinking.
