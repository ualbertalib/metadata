THE MEASUREMENT OF DROUGHT RESISTANCE IN WHEAT BY FIELD 
AND LABORATORY METHODS 


H. B. Peto 


I. INTRODUCTION 


The economic importance of resistance to drought 
has furnished the main incentive for scientific investigation 
of the problem. In the semi-arid regions of the United 
States and Canada, where moisture is generally the most 
important factor limiting plant growth, plant breeders are 
giving a great deal of attention to the development of drought 
resistant wheat varieties. However, little progress has yet 
been made in this direction. 

In Russia, the breeding of drought resistant 
wheats has been in progress for a longer period of time, and 
several new wheat varieties, superior also in yield and quality 
to the old Russian varieties have been produced. 

In 1929 a breeding investigation of drought 
resistance was commenced at the University of Alberta, 

Edmonton. New varieties were introduced from Russia and 
crossed with local varieties. The Fg hybrids obtained from 
these crosses have been used in the present investigation 
which was begun in October 1935, and has been

continued up to the time of writing* The aim has been to 
develop methods of measuring drought resistance in wheat, 
which will aid in the selection of new varieties capable 
of yielding a satisfactory crop under conditions of limited 
moisture supply* 

This investigation follows three lines of procedure 

1* The carrying on of field tests as a means of 
selecting varieties with regard to their yield 
under drought conditions. 

2* The development of laboratory methods which 
will differentiate varieties highly drought 
resistant from those non-drought resistant, and 
thus improve the general level of the material 
subjected to field tests. 

5. The study of characters which may be later 

shown to b© genetically associated with drought 
resistance, such as, number of stomata per unit 
area of leaf surface, number of tillers per 
plant and height* 

In the following pages the experiments are grouped 
according to the particular aspect of the subject to which 
they pertain.

II. REVIEW OF LITERATURE 


From a review of the literature on the physiology 
of drought resistance it seems that certain morphological 
and physiological changes run hand in hand when plants are 
exposed to drought. Maximov (8) believes that morphological 
changes are associated, for the most part, with physiological 
changes which are brought about in response to drought, and 
that these physiological characters are the basis of drought 
endurance. Briefly, Maximov believes that true resistance 
lies in the inherent ability of the plant cells to with¬ 
stand drought without much injury. 

A review of a few experiments which might bear 
out Maximov’s hypothesis would not be out of place. Accord¬ 
ing to Maximov (8), Tumanov carried out a wilting experiment 
with eight varieties of wheat which he believed varied in 
their drought resistance. The results indicated that the 
resistant varieties had a survival percentage of not less than 
80, whereas the susceptible varieties had a survival percent¬ 
age of about 50. 

The problem of drought resistance is greatly 
aggravated by the presence of two kinds of drought: soil 
drought and atmospheric drought. Tumanov (18), working 
with cereals, soybeans, alfalfa and sorghums, studied

tiie effects of soil drought when watering was stopped at 
the shooting stage in cereals, and at the flowering stage 
in the dicotyledons. The degree of drought resistance 
was measured by the number of dead leaves after eight days 
with no available water* The percentage survival of leaves 
varied from 0 in oats to 84 in alfalfa. The percentage of 
dead leaves was not always found to be a good criterion 
of drought resistance as the resistance varied considerably 
in the different plant organs. For example, a lower drought 
resistance was found in the aerial parts of alfalfa than 
in the root-crown and roots. 

Kondo (6), working with soybeans and sunflowers, 
also studied the effects of soil drought and showed that 
plants subjected to wilting in the later stages of develop¬ 
ment suffered more from loss of leaves than plants in the 
early stages. The greater the loss of leaves, the greater 
the depression of yield. It was found that the stage of 
development of the plant played an important part in the 
resistance to dehydration. 

The effect of atmospheric drought has been studied 
under controlled conditions by T. A. Krasnoselsky -Maximov 
(7). The plants were exposed to an artifical dry wind 
at 18 - 26 % relative humidity, a temperature of 40 - 45° C, 
a soil moisture of 60 % of its water holding capacity, and

a wind velocity of 5 metres per second. The usual time 
for the experiment was eight hours. It was found that 
wheat plants suffered from dry wind differently at different 
stages of growth. The injury was greatest at the time of 
earing and flowering, less at the stage of milky ripeness 
and least of all at waxy ripeness. The absolute dry 
weight of the grain increased as exposure to the dry wind 
was delayed. When the leaves were removed more water 
entered the inflorescence, thus giving a higher grain weight. 
Kondo, on the other hand, found that a lower seed yield 
and total yield of soybeans and sunflowers corresponded to 
the loss in leaf surface. 

Maximov found that the greater the soil drought 
at the time of exposure to the dry wind, the greater was 
the injury. At a soil moisture of 20 $ of its water holding 
capacity the lower leaves were killed by soil drought and 
the upper leaves and inflorescence by the dry wind. While 
at 40 $ of the moisture holding capacity death of the lower 
leaves occurred, thus putting them out of competition for 
water and consquently the inflorescence and upper leaves 
went without injury for some time. At 60 % moisture, the 
lower leaves took all the moisture from the soil, thus 
resulting in injury to the upper leaves and inflorescence. 

With reference to Maximov’s statement that "the 
only true criterion of drought resistance is the ability 
of the plant to resist severe dehydration of its cells

without injury”, the question arises as to what might be 
the inherent properties of resistant plants that allow 
them to withstand desiccation of their cells without 
injury. 

Newton and Martin (10) have made physico-chemical 
studies of drought resistance in a number of crop plants. 
The two principle methods were to determine the osmotic 
pressure and the bound water content of the tissue fluids. 
The osmotic pressure of the tissue fluids was found to 
vary with the physiological scarcity of water, but was not 
considered a reliable index of drought resistance. Bound 
water content gave satisfactory results, as it was possible 
to arrange a number of cultivated wheats and grasses in 
order of their drought resistance. These authors suggest 
that it is the high colloidal content of plant cells, which 
reduces the abstraction of water from them. They also 
hypothesize that this may account for the lack of injury 
shown in some plants and not in others under severe drought 
conditions* 

Yasilev (19) concludes that the accumulation of 
soluble carbohydrates by the plant, under conditions of 
insufficient water supply, is a means of increasing its 
drought resistance. The expenditure of reserve carbohy¬ 
drates, with permanent wilting, is one of the immediate

action of sugars against desiccation is analogous to their 
protective role in plants exposed to frost.

III. LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS WITH THE DROUGHT MACHINE 


REVIEW OF LITERATURE 

One of the first methods of measuring drought 
resistance by artificial means was developed in Russia by 
Dr. T. A. Krasnoselsky-Masimov of the Institute of Plant 
Industry in Leningrad (1, 7). He constructed a glassed- 
in cabinet with a rotating table to test plants for 
resistance to •windburn". The table had a capacity of six 
pots. The wind velocity was approximately three metres 
per second, with a temperature of 37 ** 39° C. and a relative 
humidity of about 16 - 18 

Shirley (13,14) has described an apparatus the 
construction of which is somewhat like that of Maximov’s 
for testing the drought resistance of conifers. 

Hunter, Laude and Brunson (5) made a simple heat 
chamber with thermostatically controlled heating units. A 
constant motion of air and uniformity of temperature were 
maintained by means of a small electric fan. Tests were 
made with 14 - day old corn seedlings. They were placed 
in the heat chamber and exposed to a temperature of 114° F. 
for hours. Essentially the same order of relative

resistance was obtained with seedlings as was noted for the 
plants in the field. 

Bayles and co-workers (2) by means of a heating unit, 
fan and revolving table were able to produce artificial 
drought conditions in the greenhouse. Eight varieties of 
wheat at the shooting stage were exposed to a current of air 
at a temperature of 92° to 98° F. for 24 hours. Differences 
in the amount of injury between the varieties Baart and 
Hope^for example, were clearly demonstrated, but smaller 
differences between other varieties were not so clearly 
brought out. 

In 1952 a drought machine (Fig. I) was constructed 
at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, under the direction 
of Dr. 0. S. Aamodt. ais machine was patterned after the 
one built by Maximov.

DEVELOPMENT OF METHODS AND CONSTRUCTION OF EQUIPMENT 

When the present investigation was begun in the 
fall of 1935 some alternations in the drought machine were 
found to be necessary before satisfactory results could be 
expected. 

The velocity of the wind in the cabinet varied 
from six to twelve miles per hour. Thus, a uniform treat¬ 
ment could not be assured for all varieties, even though 
the pots were periodically moved from one location to 
another in the cabinet. There was also difficulty in main¬ 
taining a constant air temperature in the machine. As air 
was drawn in from the room, the temperature in the cabinet 
was readily affected by the room temperature. Several hours 
were needed to heat the greenhouse before an experiment 
could be started. 

A considerable amount of time was spent at the 
outset of this investigation remodelling the drought machine 
to overcome the above mentioned difficulties. A picture 
of the remodelled machine is shown in Fig. II. 

The following improvements have been made. First, 
uniform conditions for all plants have been secured by means 
of an endless chain to which 25 pots are fastened. The 
endless chain is kept in constant motion and all the pots

make one complete revolution in six minutes. Second, a 
return air flow has been constructed which makes it possible 
to keep the greenhouse at ordinary temperatures during the 
course of an experiment. The temperature can now be raised 
to the desired level in six or seven minutes, which mater-

ially reduces the cost of operation. Third, a method of 
watering was devised, whereby the pots were watered from 
below by means of shallow trays. This method proved to 
be very satisfactory, as a more uniform distribution of 
moisture was obtained in all the pots at the time of water¬ 
ing. The porosity of the pots varied considerably and as a 
result evaporation is greater from the surface of some pots 
than from that of others. To overcome this the pots were 
painted on the outside with asphaltum. 

EXPERIMENT I. 

Methods 

The first experiment made in the drought machine 
was, primarily, a test of methods; the purpose of which was 
to determine the optimum duration of treatment necessary for 
the greatest varietal differentiation. Three treatments were 
used, each one included the same twenty-five varieties* 
replicated six times. The material consisted of eight variet¬ 
ies from Russia, ten standard local varieties and seven hybrids 
(three Fg Caesium x Marquis, two F^ 1-28-60 x Milturum .0321, 
one Fg Reward x Caesium and one Fg Marquis x Caesium)• 

Five seeds were planted in each pot, and the number 
of seedlings was reduced to three shortly after emergence. 

* The term "varieties" includes all hybrids and varieties 
used in the following experiments.

The seeds were germinated in a controlled temperature 
chamber. A constant temperature of 9° C. was maintained 
until the seedlings were all showing above the soil. Then 
the temperature of the chamber was slowly increased for 
two days to 20° C. Gn the third day the pots were trans¬ 
ferred to outside benches for the remainder of the growing 
period. 

Scre@ned-in cabinets (Fig. III.) were built on 
the benches to protect the plants from winds and heavy 
rains. Cotton covers were made for these cabinets (Fig. IV*) 
in order to shade the plants in very hot weather. 

The treatments In the drought machine were delayed 
a few days longer than was intended owing to harvesting 
operations at Brooks. Many of the plants were at the 
heading stage when treated. 

The temperature varied not more than a degree 
above or below 110° F. throughout the treatment in the 
drought machine. The relative humidity varied from 17 - 
23 always decreasing with length of run, and all the 
plants were exposed to the same wind velocity (approximate¬ 
ly 6 miles per hour) as a result of the endless chain. The 
soil temperature increased slowly as the test proceeded, 
but never reached the temperature of the atmosphere. The 
highest reading recorded for soil temperature was at the

end of an 18-hour run when it reached 100° F. 

The plants were watered in the trays just before 
going into the drought machine and again immediately after 
removal* 

A survival reading was taken on each run exactly 
two weeks from the time it was removed from the machine* 

The basis of calculation of the survival index was as 
follows: 

0 = completely killed* 1 = culm almost killed, pract¬ 
ically all leaves damaged. 

2 = stem and leaves con- 5 = slight damage to leaves 
siderably damaged* and stem. 

4 = no damage.

the pot and an average percentage survival per pot was

point to note is that the statistical analysis of the results 
(Table II) reveals highly significant differences between the 
general mean* of varieties* In the individual analysis for 
the 6, 12 and 18 hour runs, (Tables III, IV and V) the 
varianoe due to varieties significantly exceeds that due to 
error in the 6 and 12-hour runs only, the excess being great¬ 
er in the 6 hour run* The necessary significant differences 
are 12.2 and 10.8 for the 6 and 12 hour runs respectively. 

The replicate differences were highly significant for all 
runs. The reason for these differences are discussed under 
the next heading. 

DISCUSSION OF THE DIURNAL EFFECT 

Very marked differences in the survival values were 
noticed between replicate tests, and it seemed quite evident 
that these differences varied according to the time of day 
at which the plants were treated in the drought he chine. 

For example, the total survival of all varieties for each 
six-hour run when plotted showed that considerable injury 
occurred during the test made in the morning hours from 
5 a.m. to 11 a.m., and less injury in the afternoon, evening 
and night tests. (Fig. V). The four periods of the day were 
designated A. (5 a.m. to 11 a.m.), B. (11 a.m. to 5 p.m.), 
C. (5 p.m. to 11 p.m.) and D. (11 p.m. to 5 a.m.).

In the 12-hour run a more pronounced contrast was 
shown between the day and nigit tests. The injury during 
the D A period was definitely greater than that during the 
B C period. 

In the 18“hour run the injury was greatest when the 
number of hours of daylight exceeded the number of hours 
of darkness*

in the 6, 12 and 18-hour drought machine

RELATIONSHIPS BETHSEEN RUNS 

The relationships between survivals in the 6, 12 
and 18-hour runs were determined by means of the correlation 
coefficient. The results are summarized in Table VI. The 
relatively low coefficients for the 12 and 18, and 6 and 18 
hour rims are probably the result of severity of the injury 
sustained in the 18 hour run.

EXPERIMENT II. 

Methods 

A number of Russian varieties were included in this 
experiment on the recommendations of Dr. G. K. Meister of 
Saratov, U. S. S. R., who visited the laboratory at the 
University of Alberta during the summer of 1956. The varieties 
he suggested, not included in the last experiment, were Lutescens 
.062, Erythrospermum .0841, Graecum .0283, Albidum .0604 and 
Melanopus .069. The 25 varieties in this run consisted of 
10 varieties from Russia, 9 standard local varieties and 
6 hybrids. 

With the help of Dr. C. H. Goulden of the Dominion 
Rust Laboratory, Winnipeg, the experiment was planned in such 
a manner as to take into account the diurnal variation in the 
analysis of variance. The day was divided into four 6-hour 
periods represented by the letters A B C D, and four different 
combinations of runs were made up for each treatment as 
represented in Diagram 1.

contained A and the latter runs that did not. 

The runs were arrangsd in the order given (Diagram 2), 
in which the 9 days required to complete the 6 replications 
were divided into three groups of 3; each 3-day period gave 
2 complete replications. The X f s and Y*s were alternated, 
there being an equal number of X and Y types of each length 
of run. This was indicated in Diagram 1 under the heading 
"Frequency"• Con^quently, in disregarding the difference, 
say, between the 12-hour runs B C and C D a direct comparison 
could be made between X and Y types.

The same conditions were maintained in the second 
experiment as in the first, the machine was operated continuous¬ 
ly in order that all the material would he tested at as nearly 
the same stage of development as possible. This time, however, 
the plants were watered 6 hours before being transferred to the 
drought machine, and again 12 hours after removal from it. 

RESULTS 

Mean survival indices for the different varieties 


in the 6, 12 and 18-hour runs together with a general mean 
for each variety are recorded in Table YU. The varieties 
are ranked according to the general mean survival.

Comparing the mean survival values of Table Til 
and Table I, Milturum .0521 was second highest in both cases, 
Red Bobs 222 and 1-28-60 x Milturum .0521 (H-29-46) occupied 
an intermediate position, while Hordeiforme .0189 and Iumillo 
were consistently low in both experiments. This does not 
necessarily mean that Milturum .0521 is definitely more 
drought resistant than Hordeiforme .0189 and Iumillo, but 
these experiments do show that varieties react differently 
to treatment in the drought machine. This point will be 
discussed more fully later, in relation to the correlations 
made between the runs of these experiments. 

A complete analysis was calculated from the data 
obtained and is presented in Table Till. Individual 
analysis for each length of run is presented in Tables IX, 

X and XI.

Statistical analysis of the results (Table VIII) 
reveals highly significant differences between the general 

JZ.L 

means of varieties* A difference of 1® units between 
means corresponds approximately to the 5 fa point. The inter¬ 
action of the varieties and runs was employed as a measure 
of the error of varietal comparisons. The variance for 
X Y which measura the difference between runs containing 
morning periods and those that do not, is, as expected, 
quite significant. The interaction X Y x runs, also is 
significant. 

Considering the individual analysis for each 
length of run (Tables IX, X and XI), the F value for varieties 
was the largest for the 6“hour run. This indicates that this 
particular length of run is the most efficient for class¬ 
ifying varieties on the basis of response to artificial drought. 

DISCUSSION OF THE DIURNAL EFFECT 

The effect of time of day on survival is graph¬ 
ically represented in Fig. VI. Three replicates of each run 
contained the A period (X) and three did not (Y)• In Fig. 

VI each point represents the total survival of one replicate. 

The depressing effect of the A period on survival is quite 
apparent in the upper section of the figure representing 
the 6“hour runs.

The drop of the curve in the D period for the 
6-hour run, however cannot be explained. The C D period in 
the 12-hour run showed a low survival index, but it is 
doubtful whether any significance can be attached to this 
value at present, as no runs were made during the same 
period in the first experiment with which to compare it.

Each point represents the total survival for one replicate. 

Apart from the two differences mentioned, the same 
conclusion can be drawn here as fran Experiment I, 
namely, that there is a definite diurnal effect. The period

of the day that brings about the greatest injury in the 
drought test is the morning period from 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. 
Considerably less injury occurs in the afternoon, evening 
and night periods. In the 12 and 18-hour runs the position 
of A in the run is important. When A is present at the 
beginning of a run the plants suffer greater injury than 
when it is in the middle or at the end*

buted to the severity of these runs. General observations 
during the runs also bear out this point, 

SUMMARY 

The results so far secured indicate that varietal 
differences with respect to treatment in the drought machine 
are highly significant, and that there is a correlation 
between the 6-hour runs in the two experiments. 

The presence of a diurnal effect has been definitely 
established; greater damage resulted from tests made during 
the morning hours from approximately 6 a.m, to 12 noon, than 
during any other period of the day. To establish the cause 
of this diurnal variation would in itself necessitate a 
distinct research project. It is sufficient here to notice 
this effect, and plan the experiments in such a way as to 
take this phenomenon into account.

IV. LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS WITH SUGAR SOLUTIONS 

REVIEW OF LITERATURE 


According to Timofeeva (17), wheat varieties can 
be classified with respect to drought resistance on the 
basis of seedling tolerance to sugar solutions• His work 
is based on two theories: 

(1) That drought resistance is conditioned by 
the capacity of the protoplasm to withstand 
strong water deficiency (Maximov). 

(2) That a cell can withstand plasmolysis without 
losing its viability (Tumanov). 

Timofeeva subjected wheat seedlings to sugar 
solutions of varying concentrations (from a 1-molar solution 
to a saturated solution). He found that a greater percentage 
of drought resistant varieties survived than did those 
which were non-resistant. 

Ohga (11), using a similar method to that of 
Timofeeva, found that when the young seedlings are placed 
in a sugar solution of higher molecular concentration than 
that necessary to plasmolyzd the cells, they wilt at first, 
but recover and continue to live. 

It might be interesting to note another artificial 
method used in measuring drought resistance. Bolsunov (5),

Snoep (16) and Pavlov (12) have studied the effect of 
germinating seeds in sugar and salt solutions. Bolsunov, 
working with wheat, has germinated seed in solutions of 
concentrations of 10 to 15 atmospheres. He found that 
the plants which showed the highest survival in these 
solutions gave the greatest yield in the field. Aamodt 
and his assistants in 1954 (unpublished), at the University 
of Alberta have shown that some varieties germinate more 
rapidly than others in different concentrations of sodium 
chloride, potassium chloride and sucrose. 

Skazkin (15), on the other hand, disagrees with 
this last method. He states that the method of germinating 
seeds in sugar solutions does not give a true indication 
of the osmotic pressure of the seed, nor does it give a 
reliable figure for the variety which is constant over a 
number of years. The figure, moreover, is not directly 
correlated either with drought resistance, cold resistance, 
yield or earliness. 

The present study is based on the work of Timofeeva, 
the aim being merely to test out this artificial method 
of selecting drought resistant varieties.

DEVELOPMENT OF METHODS AND CONSTRUCTION OF EQUIPMENT 

A considerable amount of time was spent at tbe 
outset of this phase of the investigation in developing a 
satisfactory method of testing the young seedlings in 
sugar solution. It is not necessary to mention all the 
different methods tested, but rather to point out the main 
difficulties encountered and the final method adopted. 

The various details of the investigation are discussed 
under separate headings as follows: 

1, Elimination of molds, 

2, Degree of concentration . 

3, Stage of development of plant before treatment* 

4, Effect of nutrients in the sugar solution, 

5, Duration of sugar treatment and outline of 

standard method adopted. 

Elimination of Molds 

Probably one of the most important difficulties 
that had to be overcome was the elimination of molds during 
the sugar treatment. Sugar being a favorable medium for 
the growth of fungi made the problem of elimination more 
difficult. Molds persisted, even though all the solutions 
and equipment were sterilized and the seed was surface-

sterilized for 2 minutes in mercuric chloride (1-1000). 

As the seed used in these experiments was 
quite wrinkled, it was felt that a longer period of 
surface-sterilization in mercuric chloride was necessary. 

A preliminary test was made merely to indicate whether or 
not the duration of treatment in mercuric chloride could 
he increased without impairing gemination. 

Eight duplicate lots of 100 seeds of Reward 
wheat were counted out and each duplicate lot was exposed 
to a different period of time in mercuric chloride (1-1000). 
The seeds were then germinated and counts made. The results 
of the germination test are presented in Table XIV.

The results indicate that the duration of treat¬ 
ment of seed in mercuric chloride for surface-sterilization 
can be increased to 20 or 30 minutes without affecting the 
percentage germination. However beyond 30 minutes there 
seems to be a slowing up as well as a decrease in germinat¬ 
ion. 

In the experiments that followed, all the seeds 
were surface-sterilized for 20 minutes. As a result of this 
treatment all signs of molds were completely eliminated. 

Degree of Concentration 

Timofeeva (17} claims that concentrations of 
the sugar solution above 1 molar do not affect the relative 
behavior of drought resistant and non-drought resistant 
varieties. Any concentration above the point of "incipient 
plasmolysis" ensures plasmolysls of all cells and thus water 
is withheld from the cells of all varieties to the same 
extent. 

A 2-molar solution of sucrose was decided upon 
as this concentration is sufficient to withhold water from 
the roots. 

Stage of Development of Plants before Treatment 

An experiment was carried out in which the wheat

seedlings were exposed to sugar treatment at two stages of 
development, namely, 6 and 8 days from the time the seeds 
were placed in the germinator* 

Duplicate lots of 25 seeds were counted out for 
two varieties, Marquis and Milturum *0321, Each lot of seed 
was surface-sterilized and washed in distilled water* The 
seeds were germinated between sterile blotters at a temper¬ 
ature of 15 to 17° C* After 6 days in the germinator the 
roots had reached a length of about one inch, and the 
eoleoptiles £ inch* Then one-half of the young seedlings 
were transferred from the blotters to wire meshed screens, 
and the roots immersed in a 2-molar sugar solution for 
4 days* The other half of the seedlings were allowed to 
germinate for 10 days before being exposed to the same sugar 
treatment* The roots in this case were 5 inches and the 
stems 4 inohes long* 

After the sugar treatment, the roots were washed 
in distilled water and the young seedlings planted in pots 
and grown in the greenhouse at approximately 60° C* Two 
weeks after planting a survival percentage was taken.

The results in Table XV indicate that the treat¬ 
ment of the plants germinated for 6 days was not drastic 
enough and that of those germinated for 10 days probably too 
drastic. There should be an optimum stage of development 
for the best varietal differentiation somewhere between these 
two treatments. Possibly the best time would be from one 
to two days after the coleoptiles have reaohed a growth of 
from ^ to •§■ inch in length, and the roots approximately 
1 inch in length. A shortage of wire screens prevented the

duplication of tests. 

Effect of Nutrients in the Sugar Solution 

Dr, A. G, McCalla suggested a factor which had 
not previously been considered, namely, the starving of plants 
during treatment. 

Two tests were made to see whether or not 
nutrients showed any effect when present in the sugar solution. 
Twelve varieties were planted in duplicate. The seed was 
surface-sterilized for 20 minutes, washed in sterile distilled 
water and germinated on screens in moist sand. Each screen 
contained 25 seeds, and the number of seedlings was reduced to 
20 shortly before the sugar treatment. When the seedlings 
were ready for treatment the sand was removed from under the 
screens ^nd the sugar solution poured into trays containing 
these screens. Sufficient solution was used to immerse the 
roots. 

One lot of seed was treated in a 2-molar sugar 
solution to which was added nutrient solution. The nutrients 
were made up as follows:

One-quarter of this amount (3*5 oc) was added 
to each litre of sugar solution* In order to allow for the 
addition of 3*5 cc of nutrient per litre, 5 oc sugar solution 
were first removed. This replacement takes care of the 
difference in molarity between the sugar solution and the 
nutrient solution. 

The second lot of seed was treated in sugar solution 
only. After 8 days of treatment the screens were removed from 
the sugar solution, washed In sterile distilled water and the 
young seedlings planted in sterilized sand to whioh complete 
nutrient solution was added in the required amounts. After 
two weeks growth in sand a survival percentage was taken. 

The results presented in Table XVI show that 
the presenoe of nutrients does have an effect. That is, 
greater survival of the seedlings was noticed when nutrients 
were present in the sugar solution. 

A second experiment was made in order to check these 
results. This time more screens were available, so that 25 
varieties could be tested in duplicate. These additional 
data also indicate the effect of nutrients in sugar solution 
during a treatment. Over 4 times as many plants survived 
from the sugar solution plus nutrient (13 plants) as from 
the sugar solution alone (3 plants).

experiment was very low. This can be accounted for by the 
extremely hot weather during the experiment. 

In explaining the above phenomenon one would be 
inclined to conclude that the roots absorb the nutrients 
from the sugar solution. However, from the work of 
Timofeeva and from observations made here, it seems 
improbable that wheat plants are able to absorb nutrients 
from a 2-molar sugar solution. A more feasible explanation 
would be that nutrients are leached from the roots when the 
young seedlings are placed in the highly concentrated sugar 
solution. This leaching, however, does not occur, or occurs 
to a lesser degree, when nutrients are already present in 
the solution. 

Duration of Sugar Treatment and Outline of 
Standard Method Adopted. 


As duration of treatment in the sugar solution 
is the last factor to be considered, it is now possible 
to outline a standard method of treatment. 

Two durations of treatments were tested in this 
experiment, viz. 4 and 8 days. The same twenty-two 
varieties were used here, as were included in Experiment II 
(drought machine). 

The seed was carefully surface-sterilized in

sterile distilled water. The sugar solutions and remaining 
equipment were also sterilized. The seeds were counted 
out in duplicate lots of 25 and the number of seedlings 
wfs thinned to 20 shortly before treatment. They were then 
germinated on specially constructed soreens (4 n x 4 H ), the 
latter being arranged in trays (Figure VII).

A layer of moist sand was placed in the trays underneath 
the screens. The trays in turn were covered with moist 
blotting paper. When the young seedlings had reached a 
length of about one inch (Fig. VIII), a sufficient amount 
of a 2-molar solution of sucrose was poured into the 
trays to submerse the roots.

A slightly higher significance with respect 
to varietal difference was obtained in the 4-day than in 
the 8-day period. However, when an additional test was made, 
using the 4*day treatment, very little injury was noticeable. 
A further study of this point is necessary before any def¬ 
inite conclusion can be made* 

SUMMARY 


In summing up the results of this phase of the 
investigation the important points are as follows: 

1* The infection of seeds by molds during a sugar 
treatment has been completely eliminated by 
increasing the duration of surface-sterilization 
of the seed In mercuric chloride (1-1000) to 
SO minutes, and by carefully sterilizing all 
solutions and equipment. 

2* The optimum stage of development of seedlings 
for treatment in the 2~molar sugar solution,is 
that at which the young stems have reached a 
length of J to inch and the roots approximately 
one Inch* 

5. There is a greater survival of seedlings when 
nutrients are present in the sugar solution than 
when they are absent.

V. NUMBER OF STOMATA PER UNIT LEAF AREA 

REVIEW OF LITERATURE 

Miller (9) states tliat "the number of stomata per 
unit of leaf surface is, within certain limits, a character¬ 
istic of the particular species or variety of plant under 
consideration." 

There seems to be contradictory evidence as to 
whether environmental conditions influence the number of 
stomata per unit area of leaf surface. According to Miller (9), 
Salisbury concludes that the number of stomata per unit 
surface is mainly dependent on the humidity of the environ¬ 
ment, high frequencies being associated with dry exposed 
conditions, and low frequencies with humid conditions. Miller 
recorded the number of stomata per unit area of various 
agricultural plants in the field for several years. Wheat 
had more stomata on the upper surface of the leaves than on 
the lower, while the majority of the species had more on the 
lower than the upper side. The average number of stomata 
per square inch of leaf surface for wheat was approximately 
26,000 on the lower and approximately 37,800 on the upper side. 

According to Miller, Ickerson states that there is 
an inverse relation between the number and size of stomata of

a given type, that is, they are smallest when they occur in 
the largest numbers. The number of stomata varies on the 
different leaves of the same plant and on different parts of 
an individual leaf. Miller (9) cites Yapp, Ray and Salisbury 
as stating that the upper leaves have more stomata per unit 
area than the lower, Zalenski established a rule ("Zalenski's 
Law") as pointed out by Maximov (8) that the anatomical 
structure of the individual leaves of one and the same shoot 
is a function of their distance from the root system. 

The number of stomata per unit leaf surface varies 
for different regions of the same leaf. Salisbury found 
that there was a high frequency at the leaf tip, low frequency 
at the base and intermediate between the base and apex. He 
also noted that the number of stomata per unit area increased 
from the midrib toward the margin. He believes that the 
increase in frequency of stomata on the various parts of the 
plant is determined by the water relations. Conditions favor¬ 
ing high rates of transpiration favor high stomatal frequency,

made at the time of heading, using on the microscope a low 
power objective with a No. 10 ocular. The area under magnif¬ 
ication was 2.73 sq. mm. Five counts were taken on the upper 
side of the top leaf of each plant, to one side of the midrib. 
These counts were made at approximately the same distance 
from the base of each leaf, this distance being determined 
by placing the base at the left hand edge of the microscope 
stage.

The mean values show a wide range of frequencies 
from 114 to 226. That is, the number of stomata per unit 
area of Hordeiforme .0189 is twice that of 1-28-60 x Milturum 
•0521 (H-29-9). 

Statistical analysis of the data by the variance 
method (Table XXII) reveals highly significant differences 
between varieties. A difference of 23 stomata between means 
corresponds approximately to the 5% point. The error involved 
in the determinations is comparatively small except in the 
case of certain hybrid strains which were, in all probability 
segregating.

S. E. of single observation = 19.1

S. E. of difference of any two varieties = 11.5 

Significant difference = 25.0 

In order to see whether the counts varied in the 
later stages of development of the wheat plant, readings ?/ere 
taken from the same Caesium plot, at late boot, heading 
and 5 days after heading. Ten readings were taken at each 
stage of development and are given as follows: 

Mean 

Late boot - 159-143-187-176-145-156-157-179-189-170 = 167 

Heading - 199-158-175-141-164-170-161-172-160-142 = 164 

Eive days 

after heading - 163-142-179-146-172-184-158-183-187- 

169 = 168 

These data would seem to show that the stomatal 
number per unit area does not vary from the late boot stage 
until after heading. 

Stomatal counts were mad© in the laboratory in the 
winter of 1935-36, on a number of the 75 varieties that had 
been tested in the field. The purpose was to see whether there 
was sufficient correlation to justify laboratory measurements. 
The same range of stomatal frequencies existed between the 
varieties tested in the laboratory as for those tested in 
the field. However, no correlation was found between the mean 
varietal frequencies for the two methods. The difference in 





67 


the environmental conditions between the laboratory and field 
may be the cause of this lack of correlation. The light 
conditions in the greenhouse for the months of January and 
February were very poor and the plants in general were small 
and weak* Field observations using the same 81 varieties 
should be repeated in the summer of 1937, before any definite 
conclusions can be made.

VI. FIELD EXPERIMENTS AT BROOKS AND EDMONTON 

RESULTS 

The final selection of drought resistant varieties 
must he based on field trials* These are expensive, time 
consuming and, at best, only a few hundred strains can be 
tested at one time. A further difficulty lies in the fact 
that yield tests conducted under dry conditions are much 
more subject to experimental error than are similar tests 
conducted under more humid conditions. 

Last year the field test at Brooks, Alberta, was 
exposed to very severe drou^it conditions. There was little 
or no stand on certain parts of the field. As a result 
great variations were found between the yields of individual 
plots. 

In 1937 the field trial will be mad© at Castor, 
Alberta, where less sever© drought conditions are prevalent. 

Yield, height and protein data were obtained from 
the 75 varieties grown at Brooks in triple rows replicated 
5 times, and tillering, height and stomatal date were obtained 
from the same strains grown at Edmonton (height and stoma tal 
tests in single rows, and tillering test in double rows).

In the tillering test at Edmonton the gevefcty- 
five varieties were planted in duplicate rows. The seed was 
spaced uniformly three inches apart in the row. The mean 
number of tillers varied according to variety from 7.9 to 
17*9. In the analysis of the data by the variance method 
the significant difference of 4.1 corresponds approximately 
to the 5 f 0 point. 

In order to test the significance of the 
yield data in Table XXIII an analysis was made using the 
variance method.

Significant differences were found between 
varieties. However, owing to the complete destruction 
by drought of part of column I* and considerable injury 
to column V, it seemed advisable to analyse the data in 
two additional ways, in one case omitting column I, and 
in the other column I and V. The analyses of these data 
are included in Tables XXY and XXVI.

In analysing the data when column I was 
omitted (Table XXV) the V value did not exceed the 5 % 
point, and when both columns I and V were omitted 
(Table XXVI) the F value was equal to the 5 # point* 
Therefore the greatest varietal significance was obtained 
when the complete data were used.(Column I to V inclusive.)

VII, CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS 

As already indicated, one of the main purposes 
of this investigation is that of the identification of one 
or more characters associated with high yield under conditions 
of limited water supply. 

The relationships between several characters 
were determined by means of the correlation coefficient. 

The results are summarized in Table XXVIII.

Considering the above correlations there are 
some indications that tillering capacity and height under 
Edmonton conditions are both associated with yield at 
Brooks. The tillering capacity of wheat plants may be 
important. Some plant breeders have selected on the basis 
of low tillering capacity. The reason for this is to be 
found in the fact that many tillers are arrested in their 
development, especially under dry conditions. Their 
production, therefore, is assumed to involve a loss to the 
general economy of the plant. It is reasonable to suppose, 
that branching above ground may be associated with extensive 
root development. If so, discarding lines characterized 
by extensive tillering may involve selection in the wrong 
direction. There is a highly significant correlation between 
the heights of varieties at Edmonton and Brooks. The level 
of significance falls well within the 5 point. As expected, 
the height and yield at Brooks are correlated. The protein 
content of the varieties grown at Brooks is negatively 
correlated with height and yield. 

The survival values obtained from the 4-day sugar 
run indicate a positive correlation with yield at Brooks and 
negative correlation with the morning period treatment made 
in the drought machine. This treatment on the other hand, 
shows a positive correlation with tillering at Edmonton.

DISCUSSION 

It has been the aim of this investigation to 
develop methods useful in selecting wheat varieties for 
drought resistance and to identify as many characters as 
possible that are associated with yield under drought 
conditions. The methods of classification described in 
this paper are of little importance in themselves, but by 
considering them as a whole they may indicate one or more 
characters associated with yield under conditions of limited 
moisture supply. The error in the Brooks test in the summer 
of 1956 was so great that close relationships could not be 
expected. In spite of this some indications of success were 
evident. There was a significant relationship between tiller¬ 
ing at Edmonton and yield at Brooks. Lines with twelve or 
more tillers per plants at Edmonton yielded fifteen percent 
more at Brooks than did lines with eleven tiller or less. More¬ 
over, height of plant at Edmonton was weakly associated with 
yield at Brooks. 

The drought machine and sugar tests have been considered 
largely from the standpoint of methods. However, certain interest¬ 
ing relationships were found from the data obtained. Highly 
significant differences were established between varieties in 
both these laboratory tests. High associations were

found between the three drought runs ( 6, 12 and 18-hour) 
in Experimentn and between the 6-hour runs of Experiment 
I and II^ The 6-hour run indicated, from the results obtained, 
that this particular length of run is the most efficient for 
classifying varieties on the basis of response to artificial 
drought. The point has not been reached where it can be 
said that certain varieties are drought resistant and others 
non-drought resistant. However, some associations have 
been indicated between characters studied in the field with 
those studied in the laboratory. Tillering at Edmonton is 
weakly associated with the morning test in the drought 
machine, and this in turn is negatively correlated ?/ith the 
4«day sugar treatment. The yield at Brooks,on the other 
hand, indicates a positive correlation with the 4-day sugar 
test. 

It must be kept in mind that correlation 
coefficients should be considered only as indicative of 
certain relationships. These relationships even though only 
indicative, facilitate selection of the material subjected 
to field tests.

VIII. SUMMARY 

The remodelling of the drought machine has 
led to a marked reduction in experimental error. Uniform 
wind conditions haYe been secured for all plants by means 
of an endless belt to which the pots are fastened. A 
return air flow has been constructed, which facilitates a 
temperature control within the range of one degree. 

The results so far secured, all indicated 
that varietal differences with respect to treatment in the 
drought machine are highly significant. The relationships 
existing between the various runs (6, 12 and 18-hour), and 
between the 6,-hour runs of different experiments have been 
discussed. The presence of a- diurnal effect has been 
established; greater damage resulted from tests made in 
the drought machine during the morning hours from approx¬ 
imately 6 a.m. to 12 noon than during any other period of 
the day or night. 

A method of testing the tolerance of young 
wheat seedlings to sugar solutions has been outlined with 
the hope that wheat varieties may be classified according 

to drought resistance by this means. The results so far 

( 

indicate that varietal differences with regard to tolerance 
do exist. Higher significance with respect to varietal 
difference was obtained in the 4-day than in the 8-day

period* The relationships between the two laboratory methods 
and the field tests have been dealt with* 

The possible utility of several characters has 
been investigated* The number of stomata per unit area has 
been determined in pentuplioate for 81 varieties. The mean 
values ranged from 114 to 226. Statistical analysis of 
the results reveal highly significant differences between 
the general means of varieties: a difference of 25 stomata 
corresponds approximately to the 5 per cent point. As the 
above measurements were taken in the field, a duplicate 
test was also made in the greenhouse last winter for the 
sake of comparison. The results from this test were unsatis¬ 
factory as growth of the plants was considerably retarded 
by the poor light conditions in January and February. The 
plants in general were small and etiolated. 

Coefficients of correlation between various other 
characters, especially yield, height, tillering, protein 
content, are given and discussed.
