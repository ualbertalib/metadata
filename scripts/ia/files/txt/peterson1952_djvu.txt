ABSTRACT 


Aerobic spore-forming bacteria failed to reduce 
the severity of attack on wheat seedlings by Ophiobolus 
graminis , Fusarium culmorum and Helminthosporium sativum 
under the conditions of greenhouse experiments, in spite 
of the fact that they showed marked antagonism towards these 
fungi on potato dextrose agar. On the basis of these 
results, it appears possible that microorganisms other than 
spore-forming bacteria may be responsible for the suppres¬ 
sion of these pathogenic fungi in natural soil. Results 
similar to those obtained with the spore-forming bacteria 
were obtained with several actinomycetes studied. 

By means of a sensitive-microorganism technique, 
the persistence in soil of streptomycin and actidione was 
determined. Streptomycin was immediately inactivated in 
soil, whereas, actidione was found to remain in an active 
state for about a week. This method appears to be- 
applicable to other water soluble, filterable antibiotics.

ANTIBIOTIC ACTIVITY OF CERTAIN SPORE-FORMING 
BACTERIA AND OTHER MICROORGANISMS AGAINST 
SOME PLANT PATHOGENIC FUNGI IN THE SOIL 


Edwin A. Peterson 


INTRODUCTION 


A number of microorganisms have been reported to 
exhibit antagonism towards various root-disease fungi. How¬ 
ever, little attention has been given to the activity of 
aerobic spore-forming bacteria as antagonists of these patho¬ 
gens in the soil. Yet, these spore-formers are widely 
distributed in soil and several are known to possess definite 
antibiotic properties. It was thought that a special study 
of such spore-forming bacteria might yield results which would 
help to explain the suppression of plant pathogenic fungi in 
normal soils. 

Although several antibiotics have been isolated in 
pure form and have been found to be antagonistic to plant

pathogens, there is relatively little information available 
on the behavior of such substances in the soil. If anti- 
biotics are to find a place in the control of plant diseases 
caused by soil- and seed-borne plant pathogens, it is 
likely that ability to persist in the soil will be a 
character of considerable importance in determining their 
usefulness• 


OBJECTIVES 


The investigations reported here have been 
divided into two parts. Those covered under Part I were 
undertaken in an attempt to determine the importance of 
aerobic spore-forming bacteria, including strain A 32 of 
Bacillus subtilis Cohn, emend. Prazmowski and Bacillus 
polymyxa (Prazmowski) Migula, as antagonists of the cereal 
root-disease fungi Ophiobolus graminis Sacc., Fusarium 
culmorum (W. G. Sm.) Sacc. and Helminthosporium sativum P.K.B. 
in soil. Another objective was to study the effects of 
several actinomycetes on these fungi. Included among the 
former was Streptomyces griseus (Krainsky) comb, nov., an

organism known to produce the antibiotics streptomycin 
and actidione on suitable media. 

Under Part II, studies on the persistence in the 
soil of two purified antibiotics, streptomycin and actidione, 
which are known to be active against certain seed-borne 
pathogens, are reported. Microorganisms used to measure 
antibiotic activity were B. subtilis (A32), sensitive to 
streptomycin, and Polyspora lini Lafferty, sensitive to 
actidione»

PART I 


Previous studies on antibiosis at this laboratory 

In 1931, Henry (11) reported that the growth of 
HeIminthosporium sativum in sterilized soil was largely 
suppressed by the addition of a small amount of unsterile 
soil. He found that bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi each 
had a suppressing effect on this pathogen in soil and 
reduced the severity of root infection caused by it. Fungi 
were more effective than the bacteria and actinomycetes, 
but a mixture of all these organisms had the most pronounced 
effect. According to Ludwig and Henry (17), recontamination 
of sterilized soil, previously infested with the TT take-all Tt 
fungus Ophiobolus graminis , by the addition of a small 
quantity of unsterilized soil resulted in a marked reduction 
in severity of wheat seedling infection by that fungus. They 
found that the saprophytic soil fungus Trichoderma viride 
became rapidl}^ dominant in the recontaminated soil and 
concluded that it probably played an important role in the 
suppression of the pathogenic fungus.

Other work at this laboratory has indicated that 
the soil microflora may be of considerable importance in the 
suppression of certain seed-borne plant pathogens. Henry 
and Campbell (13) found a high percentage infection of flax 
seedlings by Polyspora lini, the fungus causing the "browning" 
disease, when infested seed was sown in sterilized soil. 
However, when similar seed was sown in natural soil, the 
percentage of seedling infection was significantly lower. 

They obtained similar results with the "anthracnose" pathogen 
Colletotrichum lini .

AND BACILLUS POLYMYXA (A.T.C. 7070) AGAINST 
0PHI0B0LUS GRAMINIS , FUSARIUM CULMORUK AND 
HELMINTHOSPORIUM SATIVUM 


Introduction 


Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus polyrnyxa are each 
known to produce a number of antibiotic substances (5, 8, 16, 
20). One of these substances produced by B. subtilis . 
namely, subtilin, was first described by Jansen and Hirschman 
(16) who found it to be antagonistic to Gram-positive 
bacteria chiefly, but also to a number of pathogenic fungi. 
The action of subtilin on Xanthomonas translucens . the seed- 
borne agent of bacterial-stripe of barley, was studied by

Goodman and Henry (10). They found that subtilin reduced 
infection of barley by X. translucens when applied to seed 
that had been artificially infested with this pathogen. 

During further work with the bacterial stripe 
organism, Goodman (9) observed that a medium staled by a 
strain (A 32 ) of B. subtilis , isolated from soil, reduced the 
severit}?- of bacterial stripe of barley seedlings when used 
to treat seed that had previously been infested with X. trans ¬ 
lucens . However, he concluded that the active substance 
produced by B. subtilis (A32) was different from subtilin 
since methods for the isolation of pure subtilin were in¬ 
effective when applied to the A32 cultures. Apparently A32 
does not produce subtilin. 

In view of the known antibiotic activity of the 
spore-forming bacteria B. subtilis and B. polymyxa and of 
their occurrence in soil, studies were undertaken to determine 
their effects on the growth of the root disease fungi 
Ophiobolus graminis , Fusarium culmorum and Helminthosporium 
sativum on an agar medium and on the ability of these fungi 
to attack wheat seedlings in sterilized soil.

Pure Culture Studies 


Methods 

Three series of 6 Petri plates containing potato 
dextrose agar were inoculated with the test fungi; one series 
with 0. graminis (No. 77), one with F. culmorum (F) and one 
with H. sativum (No. 6). In each plate there was planted 
a small portion of an agar slant-culture of one of the 
pathogenic fungi. The plates were kept at room temperature 
for several days until the fungus colonies reached a 
diameter of about 2 cm. Each series of plates was then 
divided into two groups. In one, the plates were streaked 
with B. subtilis (A 32 ) at a distance of about 3 cm. from 
the edge of the fungal colonies, in the other, with B. polymyxa 
(A.T.C. 7070) in a similar manner. After incubation for 
an additional 7 days, ratings for degree of antagonism, based 
upon the width of the zone of inhibition between the fungus 
and the bacterium, were made. 

Results 


As shown in Table I, B. subtilis (A32) exhibited 


marked antagonism to the three root-rot fungi when tested on

Greenhouse Studies 


An attempt was made to determine whether B. subtilis 
and B. polymyxa could influence the severity of attack by 
Ophiobolus graminis , Fusarium culmorum and Helm!nthosporiurn 
sativum on wheat seedlings in sterilized soil. 

Methods 

Inoculum of the pathogenic fungi was produced by 
growing them on Edmonton black soil plus 10 percent cornmeal 
(by weight). Erlenmeyer flasks (200 ml.), each containing 50 
gm. of soil cornmeal mixture plus 30 ml. of distilled water, 
were sterilized for 3 hours at 15 pounds steam pressure. A 
culture was started by transferring a small portion of a young 
fungus colony from a potato dextrose agar slant to a flask of 
the soil-cornmeal medium. Where a bacterium was to be included 
in addition to the fungus, 1 ml, of a 1 : 1,000,000 dilution 
of the bacterium in water was added to each flask at the time 
the fungus was added. All flasks were incubated at room 
temperature for 4 weeks. After 3 weeks, flasks were sampled 
to determine the presence of the organisms added. At the 
end of 4 weeks, flasks containing contaminants were dis¬ 
carded. Flask contents were cut up into small particles with

a sterile spatula. This inoculum was then added to 4 TT 
pots containing a 3 : 1 mixture of Edmonton black soil and 
sand, which had been sterilized for $ hours at 15 pounds 
steam pressure, at the rate of one flask per pot. To each 
pot were added, at the inoculum level, 25 Red Bobs wheat 
seeds which had been previously surface sterilized by 
immersion for 3 minutes in a 1 : 1000 mercuric chloride 
solution and rinsed in sterilized water. About an inch of 
sterilized soil was used to cover the seed. The pots were 
randomized on a greenhouse bench and watered, each with 
200 ml* of sterilized distilled water. During the period 
of the experiment, the pots were watered with sterilized 
distilled water as required and a greenhouse temperature 
of approximately 20°C. was maintained. 

After 4 weeks, the plants were removed from the 
pots and soil was washed from their roots with running 
water. The height of each plant was measured, from the 
seed to the tip of the longest leaf. Severity of infection 
was determined by examination of each plant (the portion 
extending an inch on either side of the point of seed 
attachment) and assigning to it a numerical rating of from 
0 to 5 based on the amount of necrosis present. The ratings 
for each pot were converted to the percentage of the maximum 
rating that was possible *

Results 

When sampled after 3 weeks it was found that in 
flasks to which bacteria and a fungus had been added, the 
bacteria had multiplied tremendously. The fungi in all 
flasks had penetrated throughout the medium except in those 
to which 0. graminis (No. 77) had been added along - with 
B. subtilis (A 32 ). Here the development of the fungus 
0. graninis was greatly reduced. 

Summarized infection and height data are presented 
in Table II.

Except for 0. graminis in the presence of B. 
subtil!s (A 32 ), no statistically significant differences 
in the degree of infection between the bacterial treatments 
and the controls were obtained. 


Discussion 


The striking reduction in severity of infection 
by 0. graminis in the presence of B. subtills (A32) as 
compared with the fungus alone may be accounted for by the 
fact that growth of the fungus in flasks to which A 32 had 
been added was greatly reduced. Consequently, only a 
limited amount of inoculum, as compared with that in control 
flasks containing the fungus alone, had been produced by the 
time of seeding. 

A possible explanation of the results with 0. 
graminis is that this fungus, normally a slow growing 
organism, was unable to compete with the rapidly multiplying 
bacteria for available food. Moreover, considering the 
antagonistic action of B. subtilis (A32) against 0. graminis 
on potato dextrose agar, perhaps products of bacterial 
metabolism, possibly antibiotics, may have directly

inhibited the development of the fungus under the conditions 
described. However, the fact that F. culmoruni and H. 
sativuni appeared to be unimpeded in their development in 
the presence of A3 2 suggests that these fungi, because of 
their ability to grow rapidly, were able to compete 
successfully with the bacterium. 


ANTIBIOTIC ACTIVITY OF MISCELLANEOUS ISOLATES OF 
SPORE-FORMING BACTERIA FROM LOCAL SOILS 
AGAINST QPHIOBOLUS GRAMINIS , FUSARIUM CULMORUM 
AND HELMINTHOSPQRIUM SATIVUM 


Introduction 


It has been reported that certain bacteria, 

Bacillus spp. in particular, have an appreciable inhibitory 
effect on various soil-borne plant pathogens under certain 
conditions. According to Waksman (20), Novogrudsky ob¬ 
served that certain bacteria were able to destroy and 
dissolve the mycelium and spores of different phytopathogenic

fungi both in artificial media and in soil. He reported 
that Fusarium graminearum in sterilized soil caused the 
death of wheat plants grown in it, whereas in the presence 
of lysogenic bacteria, the pathogen was much less active. 
Furthermore, the addition of bacteria to unsterilized TT flax 
sick Tf soil infested with F. lini markedly reduced the per¬ 
centage of wilted flax plants. 

Anwar (1) conducted experiments to determine the 
survival of H, sativum and F. lini in soil. In pure 
culture work, he found that soil isolates of B. subtilis 
were antagonistic to both fungi. When steamed soil was 
infested with inoculum of H. sativum , grown on a wheat-oat . 
mixture, and seeded with barley, the resulting plants were 
severely diseased and yield was significantly reduced. 
However, after infesting steamed soil with a mixture of 
inoculum of H. sativum and inoculum of certain isolates of 
B. subtilis , also grown on a wheat-oat mixture, the barley 
plants grew almost as well as plants in non-infested soil 
and yield was not lowered significantly. Moreover, in field 
tests, barley in rows inoculated with the root-rot fungus 
and B. subtilis grown on a wheat-oat medium, showed a much 
lighter infection than the barley in rows inoculated with 
the fungus alone. No control of flax wilt, following the 
addition of F. lini and B. subtilis to soil, was obtained.

Cordon and Haenseler (7) isolated a strain of 
Bacillus simplex which was found to produce a thermostabile 
substance that inhibited growth and even caused the death 
of Rhizoctonia solani . When the substance was added to 
soil, marked control of seed deca^r and damping-off of 
cucumbers and peas was observed. 

Since in the previous section it was shown that 
B. subtilis (A32) and B. polymyxa (A.T.C. ?070) are 
generally ineffective as antagonists against 0. graminis , 

F. culmorum and H. sativum in sterilized soil, it seemed 
advisable to determine how other aerobic spore-forming 
bacteria in the soil behave towards these pathogens. For 
this purpose, isolations were made from a large number of 
soil samples collected from the main soil zones and from 
widely separated localities in the province of Alberta 
during the summer of 1950. 

Isolation of Spore-forming Bacteria 


Spore-forming bacteria were readily obtained by 
subjecting a soil suspension to pasteurization, thereby 
eliminating non-spore-forming bacteria, actinomycetes and 
fungi. Approximately 1 gm. of soil from each sample was 
suspended in 10 ml. of distilled water in a test tube.

The tubes were immersed in water at temperatures ranging 
from $0° to $3°C. for a period of 10 minutes and then 
immediately cooled. One ml. quantities of the pasteurized 
suspensions were mixed with approximately 10 ml. lots of 
potato dextrose agar in plates. The plates were incubated 
at room temperature for 4 days when bacterial transfers 
from individual colonies were made to potato dextrose 
agar slants, one to each slant. All isolates were sub¬ 
jected to pasteurization and reisolated to eliminate any 
possible non-sporing contaminants. 

Pure Culture Studies 

Methods 

Petri plates containing potato dextrose agar were 
inoculated with the test fungi 0. graminis (No. 77), F. 
culmorum (F) and H. sativum (No. 6) as previously described. 
The plates were incubated at room temperature for several 
days until the fungus colonies reached a diameter of about 
2 cm. Duplicate plates of each fungus were treated, each 
with a bacterial isolate. The bacterium was streaked on 
the surface of the medium on two opposite sides of the 

fungus colony and at a distance of about 2 cm. from its edge.

Plates were incubated for an additional 7 days at room 
temperature whereupon ratings of the degree of antagonism, 
based on the width of the zone of inhibition, were made. 

B. polymyxa (A.T.C. 7070) and several named 
strains of B. subtilis including A32 were also tested at 
the same time and under the same conditions as the above 
isolates for comparative purposes. 

Results 


As shown in Table III, a relatively high 
proportion of the spore-forming bacterial isolates ex¬ 
hibited varying degrees of antagonism towards the three 
root-rotting fungi when tested on potato dextrose agar. 

Out of a total of 66 isolates tested, 51 were antagonistic 
to 0. graminis (No. 77), 40 to F. culmorum (F) and 36 to 
H. sativum (No. 6). In addition, it was found that 31 
isolates were antagonistic to all three of these fungi.

Greenhouse Studies 


A number of the spore-forming bacterial isolates 
included in the test reported in Table III were selected 
for study in sterilized soil on the basis of their marked 
antagonism towards Ophiobolus graminis , Fusarium culmorum 
and Helminthosporium sativum on potato dextrose agar. 

Also included, for comparison, were three spore-formers 
of known identity, namely, B. subtilis (A32), B. subtilis 
(N.R.C. No. 4) and B. polymyxa (A.T.C. 7070). 

Methods 


Four-inch pots containing a 3 : 1 mixture of 
Edmonton black soil and sand were sterilized for 3 hours 
at 15 pounds steam pressure. Fungus inoculum, grown in 
flasks on a sterilized soil-cornmeal mixture, was added 
at the rate of 1 flask per pot. After seeding with 25 
Red Bobs wheat seeds, previously surface sterilized with a 
1 : 1000 mercuric chloride solution, 50 ml. of a heavy 
bacterial suspension was distributed uniformly over the 
inoculum and seed by means of a pipette. Control pots 
received fungal inoculum, seed and 50 ml. of sterile 
distilled water in place of the bacterial suspension. Seed 
was covered with about an inch of sterilized soil.

The experiment included 4 pots for each of 11 
bacterial treatments and 4 pots for a sterile water (control) 
treatment* The pots were randomized on a greenhouse bench 
and were watered, each with 200 ml* of sterile distilled 
water. During the course of the experiment, pots were 
watered as required. The greenhouse temperature varied 
between 20° and 25°C. 

Four weeks after seeding, plants were removed from 
the pots and the soil was washed from their roots with 
running water. The height of each plant was measured and 
disease severity was determined as previously described. 

Results 

Results summarizing the effects of spore-forming 
bacterial isolates on 0. graminis (No. 77) were to be 
reported at this time. However, a number of marked dis¬ 
crepancies in the data make them unreliable. Considerable 
variation of the same treatment, with regard to severity of 
infection occurred among replications, namel}?-, from 0 to 
40 percent. Moreover, controls (the fungus alone) showed 
an unusuall}^ low degree of infection as compared with normal 
infection of wheat seedlings by 0. graminis observed in 
previous tests where similar techniques w r ere employed.

For these reasons the results are considered to be unreliable 
and hence, are omitted. It may, however, be mentioned 
that there was no indication of inhibition of 0. graminis 
(No. 77) by any of the bacterial isolates tested. 

The tests involving F. culmorum (F) and H. sativum 
(No. 6) were uniform with regard to replications and the 
data are summarized in Table IV, 

The spore-forming bacterial isolates tested 
showed little, if any effect on the infection of wheat 
seedlings by F. culm or urn (F) or H. sativum (No. 6) under 
the conditions of the outlined experiments. It may be 
noted (Table IV) that although the differences obtained were 
not significant, as determined by an analysis of variance, 
there appears to be a tendency for slight inhibition of 
F. culmorum by two isolates, namely, culture numbers 13a - 
50 and 32 - 50 as compared with the fungus alone. On the 
other hand, there appears to be some stimulation of this 
fungus by isolates 13b - 50, 41 - 51 and 42 - 51. There 
also appears to be a slight tendency for reduction in the 
severity of attack by H. sativum in the case of several 
isolates, but again, these differences, as compared with this 
fungus alone, are not statistically significant.

Discussion 


The results of the agar plate tests suggest a 
relatively large proportion of the spore-forming bacteria 
may be potential antagonists of Ophiobolus graminis , 

F. culmorum and Helminthosporium sativum in the soil. 

Yet, in spite of their marked antagonism (with the exception 
of B. polymyxa A.T.C. 7070) towards these fungi on potato 
dextrose agar, the spore-forming isolates used in green¬ 
house studies had little inhibitive effect on the ability 
of the pathogenic fungi to attack wheat seedlings under the 
conditions described. These observations are in agreement 
with those of Broadfoot (4) who emphasized that the 
antagonism of a saprophytic microorganism to a plant 
pathogen on artificial media is not a reliable indication 
of the effect it may have on the parasitic activity of the 
same pathogen in the soil.

ANTIBIOTIC ACTIVITY OF A MIXTURE OF SPORE-FORMING 
BACTERIA FROM THE SOIL AGAINST 
OPHIOBOLUS GRAMINIS AT DIFFERENT SOIL TEMPERATURES 


Introduction 


Since various aerobic spore-forming bacteria are 
known to occur in soils, there is a possibility that these 
organisms, as a group, may influence the activity of certain 
soil-borne plant pathogens. As previously mentioned, 

Henry (11) found that a mixture of soil fungi was more 
effective in suppressing Helminthosporium sativum in soil 
than a mixture of either bacteria or actinomycetes. In 
view of these results, it would be of interest to know 
what-effects a mixed population of spore-forming bacteria 
might have on root-disease fungi in the soil. 

The question of soil temperature may be of 
importance in determining the activity of spore-forming 
bacteria. Soil temperature is always a factor influencing 
the development of plant diseases caused by soil-borne 
plant pathogens. In addition to its effect on the hosts 
and on the parasites, temperature may affect the development 
of soil microorganisms which are naturally antagonistic to

such pathogens and hence, indirectly alter the parasitic 
activities of these pathogens. 

Henry (12) studied the influence of soil tem¬ 
perature on the reaction of wheat seedlings to Ophiobolus 
graminis . He found that in sterilized soil the fungus 
caused severe damage at temperatures ranging from 13° bo 
27°C. However, in unsterilized soil, while damage was 
severe at temperatures below 20°C., a marked reduction of 
damage occurred at temperatures above 20°C. Although 
most of the seedlings grown in sterilized soil were dead 
after 25 days at 27°C., the seedlings grown in unsterilized 
soil at the same temperature were almost as vigorous as 
those of the non-inoculated controls. 

In the following investigation the effects of 
a mixture of spore-forming bacteria, common to Edmonton 
black soil, on the ability of 0. graminis to attack wheat 
seedlings in sterilized soil were studied at several 
different soil temperatures*

Greenhouse Studies 


Methods 

Fungus inoculum was grown on a soil-cornmeal 
medium as previously described. A mixture of spore-forming 
bacteria from soil was obtained as follows. Ten gm. of 
Edmonton black soil were added to 100 ml. of distilled 
water, shaken vigorously for about 3 minutes and alloitfed 
to settle for 1 hour. The soil suspension was then added 
to test tubes at the rate of 10 ml. per tube. The tubes 
were immersed in water at a temperature of S0°C. for 10 
minutes then immediately cooled. The pasteurized soil 
suspension was added to small Erienmeyer flasks containing 
50 gm. of sterile Edmonton black soil (approximately 30 
percent moisture content) at the rate of 1 ml. per flask. 
After 9 da 3 /s incubation at room temperature, flasks were 
sampled to determine the presence of the bacteria added 
by streaking soil particles on the surface of potato dextrose 
agar. 

Gallon crocks containing a 3 : 1 mixture of 
moist Edmonton black soil and sand were covered with sev¬ 
eral thicknesses of newspaper and sterilized for 12 hours 
at 15 pounds steam pressure. After cooling, $ crocks were

placed in each of 4 controlled temperature tanks at the 
temperatures 15°, 20°, 25° and 30°C., respectively. 

Seeding was delayed for 24 hours to allow soil temperatures 
to become constant. The paper coverings were left on the 
crocks until the time of seeding to minimize contamination. 
The crocks in each tank were divided into 2 series. In one 
series, each crock received 1 flask of fungus inoculum and 
1 flask of bacterial inoculum. In the other, the control 
series, each crock received 1 flask of fungus inoculum and 
1 flask of sterilized soil in place of the bacterial in¬ 
oculum. The crocks were then seeded at the inoculum level 
with 25 Red. Bobs wheat seeds, previously surface-sterilized 
with a 1 : 1000 mercuric chloride solution. Seed was 
covered with about an inch of sterilized soil and all 
crocks were watered with approximately 200 ml. of sterile 
distilled water. 

During the period of the experiment, the crocks 
were watered as required. Temperatures were maintained 
by thermostat control. 

After 4 weeks plants were removed from the crocks 
and their roots were washed in running water. The height 
of each plant was measured and ratings of the severity of 
disease were made as described previously.

Results 


Agar plate tests indicated that the spore-forming 
bacteria had increased greatly in numbers in the flasks 
of sterilized soil when the soil was sampled after 9 days. 

The summarized height and root infection data are 
given in Table V. No statistically significant differences 
between the reaction of wheat seedlings to 0. graminis 
(S.P. -1) in the presence of the spore-forming bacteria 
and their reaction to the pathogenic fungus alone were found 
at any temperatures used. The fungus caused severe damage 
to the seedlings at the temperatures 15°, 20° and 25°C. At 
30°C., plants appeared vigorous and normal in size. Al¬ 
though on most of the plants grown at 30°C. the seminal 
roots and sub-coronal internodes showed severe lesioning, 
vigorous secondary roots that were almost free from in¬ 
fection had developed at the crowns. This was not observed 
on plants grown at the three lower temperatures.

Discussion 


Under the conditions of this investigation, the 
mixture of spore-forming bacteria used had little, if any 
effect on the ability of 0. graminls (S.P.-l) to attack 
wheat seedlings. Moreover, it is interesting to note that 
this strain of the fungus exhibited marked parasitic 
activity in sterilized soil over a relatively wide range of 
temperatures and that it was not appreciably suppressed by 
the bacteria at any of the temperatures tested. 

The increased vigor of the plants grown at 30°C., 
as compared with those grown at the lower temperatures, 
suggests that this temperature closely approaches the 
upper limit for parasitic activity by 0. graminis (S.P.-l). 

In view of these results and those reported by 
Henry (12), it seems possible that microorganisms, other 
than the aerobic spore-forming bacteria, are involved in 
the suppression of Ophiobolus graminis in natural soils.

ANTIBIOTIC ACTIVITY OF CERTAIN ACTINOMYCETES 
AGAINST OPHIOBOLUS GRAMINXS t FUSARIUM 
CULMQRUM AND HELMINTHQ5P0RIUM SATIVUM 


Introduction 


Many actinomycetes, antagonistic to bacteria, 
fungi and other actinomycetes in artificial culture have 
been isolated from soil (2, 20). Although they occur abun¬ 
dantly in various soils, there is little knowledge of 
their role as antagonists there. 

Cooper and Chilton (6) studied the antibiotic 
activity of a large number of actinomycetes, isolated from 
the sugar-cane soils of Louisiana. They found that an 
average of 23.A percent of their isolates were antagonistic 
to Pythium arrhe nomanes in pure culture. Similarly, 

Meredith and Semeniuk (IB) found that 21 percent of 
actinomycetes which had been isolated from Iowa soils were 
antagonistic to Pythium graminicola . However, they reported 
that when spores of a species of Streptomyces were added to 
unsteamed soil, there was no apparent effect on the growth 
of soil fungi.

In the present studies, experiments were made to 
determine the antagonism of a number of actinomycetes isolated 
from soil against the root-disease fungi Ophiobolus graminis , 
Fusariurn culmorum and Helminthosporium sativum in pure 
culture. Furthermore, an attempt was made to determine 
their ability to antagonize 0. graminis and H. sativum in 
sterilized soil. 


Pure Culture Studies 


A relatively large number of actinomycetes, 
isolated from soil, are maintained as part of the stock 
culture collection of this laboratory. These were tested 
for antagonism against 0. graminis , F. culmorum and H. 
sativum in pure culture. 

Methods 


The methods used for determination of the an¬ 
tagonism of actinomycete isolates against the pathogenic 
fungi 0. graminis , F. culmorum and H. sativum were essentially 
the same as those previously described for the testing of 
spore-forming bacterial isolates. Potato dextrose agar was

selected as a culture medium on the basis of preliminary- 
tests with some of the actinomycetes. The pathogenic fungi 
grew well on this medium and the antagonistic effects of 
certain actinomycete isolates on them were easil}^ recognized. 

Three series of Petri plates containing potato 
dextrose agar were inoculated with the pathogenic fungi, 
one series with 0. graminis (S.P.-l), one with F. culmorum 
(F) and one with H. sativum (No. 6). In most cases, a 
single streak of spores from each actinomycete isolate 
was made on the surface of the agar in 2 plates of each 
series, at a distance of 3 cm. from the fungus inoculum. 
However, a number of the isolates did not sporulate in 
culture. Here, bits of mycelium were used to make the 
streaks. Plates were kept at room temperature for 10 days 
and counts were made of the isolates that were antagonistic 
to each of the fungi. 

Results 

Although some of the actinomycetes tested did not 
grow satisfactorily.on potato dextrose agar, out of a total 
of 44 isolates that did grow on this medium, $ were antagon¬ 
istic to 0. graminis, 5 were antagonistic to F. culmorum 
and 13 were antagonistic to H. sativum.

Greenhouse Studies 


Two actinomycetes were selected, on the basis of 
their pronounced antagonism towards 0. graminis and H. 
sativum in pure culture, for study in sterilized soil. In 
addition, Streptomyces griseus (A.T.C. 10137) was included 
in this study. However, since this species failed to 
grow on potato dextrose agar, its effects on the pathogenic 
fungi in pure culture were not determined. 

Methods 

The procedure followed in this experiment was the 
same as that described for the studies with isolates of 
spore-forming bacteria. Fungus inoculum was grown on a 
soil plus 10 percent cornmeal medium. Actinomycetes were 
grown on a glycerol-yeast extract medium* described by 
Bottcher and Conn (3), solidified b}r the addition of agar.

The experiment was conducted in 2 series of pots 
containing a sterilized mixture of soil and sand, one series 
for each of the pathogenic fungi, 0. graminis (S.P.-l) and 
H. sativum (No. 6). Each series included the following: 

(a) 3 pots containing fungus inoculum for each of 3 
actinomycete treatments, 

(b) 3 pots containing fungus inoculum for a sterile 
water control treatment, 

(c) 3 pots containing sterilized soil-cornmeal medium 
(non-inoculated) for a sterile water control 
treatment• 

Fungus inoculum was added at the rate of one 
flask per pot. After seeding with 25 surface sterilized 
Red Bobs wheat seeds, an actinomycete spore suspension was 
distributed uniformly over the seeded layer, by means of a 
pipette, at the rate of 50 ml. per pot. Control pots each 
received 50 ml. of sterile distilled water. Seed was then 
covered with about an inch of sterilized soil. Pots of 
each series were randomized on a greenhouse bench and watered, 
each with 200 ml. of sterile distilled water. During the 
experiment, the greenhouse temperature was maintained at 
approximately 20°C.»and pots were watered as required.

After 4 weeks plants were removed from the pots 
and notes were taken on heights and severity of root 
infection. 

Results 

Height and root infection data are summarized in 
Table VI.. Differences between the actinomycete treatments 
and the sterile water treatment of infested soil were not 
statistically significant. Similar results were obtained 
for both 0. graminis . (S.P.-l) and H. sativum (No. 6), 

Severe damage was caused by each of the pathogenic fungi. 

It may be seen in Plate I, Figures 1 and 2, that all 
plants grown in infested sterilized soil were severely 
stunted as compared with the vigorous plants grown in 
uninfested sterilized soil.

Discussion 


Although the actinomycetes used in these studies 
were antagonistic.in pure culture to Ophiobolus graminis 
and He1minthosporium sativum , they showed little, if any 
influence on the parasitic activity;- of these pathogens 
towards wheat seedlings under the conditions described. 

Generally, actinomycetes grow slowly in the soil* 
Ludwig and Henry (17), were unable to show the presence of 
actinomycetes until & days after sterilized soil was re¬ 
contaminated with a small amount of normal soil. This 
slow growth of the actinomycetes might explain the absence 
of their influence on the pathogenic fungi in soil.

PART II 


THE BEHAVIOR OF CERTAIN PURIFIED ANTIBIOTICS 
FROM STREPTOMYCES GRISEUS IN THE SOIL 


Introduction 


The value of an antibiotic for the control of 
soil- or seed-borne plant pathogens might well depend 
largely on its ability to remain in an active state when 
in contact with soil. According to Weindling et al (21), 
the persistence of antibiotics in soil depends on such 
factors as their stability, adsorption, and resistance to 
decomposition by the soil microflora. Siminoff and 
Gottlieb (19) pointed out that antibiotics such as strepto¬ 
mycin and subtilin, whose reactions are on the alkaline 
side of neutrality, are adsorbed and effectively inactivated 
by colloidal complexes such as clays and soil organic matter, 
and thus are probably biologically inactive in the soil. 

In the following studies an attempt was made to 
determine the persistence of antibiotic activity in the 
soil of two purified antibiotics, namely, streptomycin and

actidione. These two antibiotics have previously been used 
in seed treatment investigations at this laboratory. 
Streptomycin was found to be ineffective for the control 
of covered smut of oats when used in liquid form for treat¬ 
ment of infested seed (15) • On the other hand, actidione 
yielded promising results in smut control, both in liquid 
and dust form (14)* Complete control of covered smut of 
wheat was obtained when infested seed was immersed in a 
10 ppm. solution of actidione for 1 minute. Furthermore, a 
finely divided clay dilution of this antibiotic also effect¬ 
ively controlled covered smut of wheat when used to treat 
infested seed. 

More recently, it was noticed that actidione, 
when diluted with the clay, lost little, if any activity 
after 9 months storage in rubber-stoppered test tubes at 
room temperature.

Seedling Technique 


Phytotoxicity of certain concentrations of 
streptomycin and actidione have been observed on numerous 
occasions at this laboratory during seed treatment in¬ 
vestigations both in the greenhouse and in the field. 

Wheat seed soaked in harmful water solutions of streptomycin 
gave rise to a high percentage of albino seedlings. 

Similar solutions of actidione markedly reduced gemination 
of the soaked seed. On the basis of these observations, 
an experiment was conducted to determine whether the harmful 
effects of streptomycin and actidione on wheat seedlings 
might be used to indicate the persistence of these compounds 
in the soil. 

Methods 


A quantity of Edmonton black soil was adjusted to 
a moisture content of 30 percent and .added to Petri plates 
at the rate of 50 gm. per plate. The plates were divided 
into two groups, one group was sterilized for 2 hours at 
15 pounds steam pressure, the other was left unsterilized. 
Each group was separated into four series of 10 plates each, 
which received the following treatments:

series 1, 20 ml. of a 10,000 ppm. sterile water 
solution of streptomycin per plate; 

series 2, 20 ml. of a 5,000 ppm. sterile water 
solution of actidione per plate; 

series 3, 20 ml. of a 1,000 ppm. sterile water 
solution of actidione per plate; and 

series 4, 20 ml. of sterile distilled water 

per plate. 

One plate in each series of the two groups 
(sterilized and unsterilized) was seeded immediately with 
25 Red Bobs wheat seeds, previously surface sterilized with 
a 1 : 1000 mercuric chloride solution. The remainder of 
the plates of each series was similarly seeded periodically, 
beginning after an interval of 3 days. As the experiment 
progressed, the interval between seedings was extended. 

All plates were kept at room temperature during 
the course of the experiment. Sterile distilled water was 
added to the plates regularly to maintain the soil moisture 
content. In an attempt to minimize contamination and to 
prevent rapid drying of the soil, the plate covers were 
left on until emergence of the seedlings was noticed. 
Percentage emergence was recorded 14 days after seeding.

Results 

Wheat seedlings grown in soil to which a solution 
of streptomycin had been added appeared to be normal, as 
compared with those grown in untreated soil. In view of 
the high concentration of streptomycin used, the results 
suggest that this antibiotic was immediately inactivated 
in the soil. As shown in Table VII, germination of wheat, 
seeded up to 60 days after a solution of actidione had been 
added to sterilized soil, was completely inhibited. With 
reference to the lower concentration of actidione in un- 
sterilized. soil, complete inhibition was apparent for only 
6 days. Wheat sown 9 days after the addition of this anti¬ 
biotic to unsterilized soil resulted in a very limited 
germination, but seeding 14 days after the addition of the 
antibiotic resulted in little, if any effect on germination 
as compared with control plates. It may be noted that the 
inhibitory effect of the higher concentration of actidione 
was maintained in unsterilized soil somewhat longer than 
that of the lower concentration. 

The results for actidione (1,000 ppm.) in un¬ 
sterilized soil are illustrated graphically in Figure 1.

Sensitive-microorganism Technique 


A number of difficulties were encountered while 
using the seedling method for the determination of anti¬ 
biotic persistence in soil. Considerable attention was 
required to prevent rapid drying of the soil contained in 
shallow Petri plates. Germination of wheat seeds was not 
always uniform in the different control plates. Plates 
containing sterilized soil became contaminated with various 
fungi after a short time on a laboratory table. In an 
attempt to overcome these difficulties, a bacterium, sensi¬ 
tive to streptomycin, and a fungus, sensitive to actidione 
were used to measure antibiotic activity of these compounds. 

Methods 

A quantity of Edmonton black soil was adjusted to 
a 25 percent moisture content and was added to test tubes 
at the rate of 5 gm. per tube. The tubes were plugged with 
cotton and one half of them was sterilized for 1 hour at 
15 pounds steam pressure while the other half was left 
unsterilized. The two groups (sterilized and unsterilized) 
were each divided into two series of 10 tubes. One series 
of each group received a 10,000 ppm. sterile distilled

water solution of streptomycin at the rate of 2 ml. per 
tube. The other series of each group received a 1,000 ppm. 
sterile distilled water solution of actidione at the rate 
of 2 ml. per tube. 

One tube from each series of the two groups was 
tested for antibiotic activity immediately and then at 
intervals over a period of 50 days. Antibiotic activity 
was determined as follows. The contents of a tube were 
extracted with 10 ml. of distilled water by vigorous 
shaking for 3 minutes. The water extract was then filtered 
through a Seitz bacterial filter. A one-half inch sterile 
absorbent paper disc was saturated with the filtrate and 
placed at the center of a Petri plate on the surface■of a 
potato dextrose agar dilution of the sensitive organism. 
Duplicate plates were used for each filtrate. Plates were 
incubated at room temperature for 4 days and the widths 
of the inhibition zones were measured. 

Of several bacteria tested for sensitivity to 
streptomycin, B. subtills (A32) was selected as a suitable 
test organism on the basis of its rapid growth and wide 
zone of inhibition by this antibiotic. Similarly, Polyspora 
lini (194-b) was selected from a number of fungi tested for 
sensitivity to actidione. Since this strain of P. lini

sporulates profusely on potato dextrose agar, heavy spore 
suspensions were readily obtained for preparation of the 
agar test plates. 

It was thought that filtration might result in 
a decrease in activity of one or both antibiotic solutions 
and hence, influence the accuracy of results. This possibi¬ 
lity was investigated. A 10 ml. aliquot of a 10,000 ppm. 
sterile distilled water solution of streptomycin was filtered 
through a Seitz bacterial filter and tested for antibiotic 
activity against B. subtilis (A 3 2) by the paper disc 
method. Similarly, a 10 ml. aliquot of 1,000 ppm. sterile 
water solution of actidione was filtered and tested against 
P. lini (194-b). The activity of the filtrates of each 
antibiotic was compared with the activity of similar unfiltered 
solutions. As shown in Table VIII no difference between 
filtered and unfiltered solutions was found for either strepto¬ 
mycin or actidione. This experiment was repeated with almost 
identical results. Both antibiotics, in water solution, 
evidently pass freely through a Seitz filter. Hence, this 
type of filter can be used safely to remove microorganisms 
from such solutions.

Results 

As shown in Table IX, the filtered water ex¬ 
tracts from tubes containing sterilized soil and from 
tubes containing unsterilized soil to which streptomycin 
had been added, failed to inhibit B. subtilis (A32), 
even when tested immediately following the addition of the 
antibiotic * 

Antibiotic activit 3 r of actidione in sterilized 
soil remained constant for at least 50 da}?*s (the period 
of the experiment). However, in unsterilized soil, activity 
remained constant for only 6 days. A slight decline in 
activity was apparent at 9 days and by the end of 17 days 
only a trace of inhibition of the sensitive fungus was 
noticed. The results for actidione are illustrated graphi¬ 
cally in Figure 2.

Discussion 


The results of the seedling and sensitive- 
microorganism techniques indicate that streptomycin was 
immediately inactivated when added to soil* This is in 
agreement with the work of Siminoff and Gottlieb (19)* 

On the other hand, actidione appears to maintain a high 
proportion of its activity for at least 9 days in normal 
unsterilized soil and for a considerably longer period 
in sterilized soil* The apparent decline of antibiotic 
activity of actidione in unsterilized soil after about a 
week is believed to be the result of decomposition of this 
compound by the soil microflora. 

The sensitive-microorganism technique for the 
determination of antibiotic persistence in soil was found 
to be more sensitive and easier to use than the seedling 
technique. It should be possible, by the sensitive- 
microorganism method, to determine quickly whether other 
water-soluble filterable antibiotics may persist in soil.

GENERAL DISCUSSION 


In pure culture studies, a high proportion of 
aerobic spore-forming bacteria isolated from a number of 
different soils showed marked antagonism towards the root- 
disease fungi Ophiobolus graminis , Fusariun culmoruia and 
Helminthosporium sativum. let, under the conditions of 
the greenhouse studies, the spore-formers used, including 
strains of Bacillus subtilis , failed to reduce the severity 
of attack by these fungi on wheat seedlings grown in steri¬ 
lized sqU. From these results, it would appear that spore¬ 
forming bacteria have little to do with the suppression of 
such pathogens in natural soils. This might well be the 
case in view of the results of Henry (11), who found that 
fungi were more effective in suppressing H. sativum than either 
bacteria or actinomycetes. On the other hand, Anwar (1) 
reported that certain B. subtills isolates could reduce 
the severit}^ of disease of barley caused by H. sativum in 
the greenhouse and in the field. It should, however, be 
noted in Anwar’s experiments that inoculum of both the 
pathogenic fungus and the bacteria was increased on a 
wheat-oat medium. Fungus and bacterial inocula were then 
mixed and added to the soil. It seems possible that toxic

products resulting from bacterial growth in the wheat-oat 
mixture might have been responsible for the suppression 
of this fungus. 

In the studies reported here, the individual 
spore-forming bacteria used were added to the soil at the 
time of seeding as a spore suspension. Hence, some time 
would be required before accumulation of toxic products 
would be sufficient to influence the pathogenic fungus. 

This might possibly account, at least in part, for the 
lack of agreement between these results and those reported 
by Anwar (1). 

In an experiment in which a mixture of spore¬ 
forming bacteria were increased on and added to sterilized 
soil along with the pathogen 0. graminis there was no 
apparent influence on the parasitic activity of the fungus 
towards wheat seedlings. This lends support to the results 
of tests with individual spore-forming bacteria which have 
indicated that these organisms, when present in soil which 
has not been enriched with organic matter, are not very 
active in the suppression of 0. graminis . 

The effects of several actinomycetes on the fungi 
0. graminis and H. sativum in sterilized soil were very 
similar to those reported for the spore-forming bacteria. 

A possible explanation of the results with the actinomy¬ 
cetes is that the pathogenic fungi, each being well

established in the soil-cornmeal medium and in the vicinity 
of the germinating seed, may have been able to gain entrance 
and cause infection in host tissue before the actinomycetes 
had developed sufficiently to influence fungal growth. 

Of two methods used to determine the persistence 
of streptomycin and actidione in the soil, namely, the 
seedling technique and the sensitive-microorganism technique, 
the latter proved to be the most practical as a laboratory 
procedure. The sensitive-microorganism technique may 
also be applicable to other water soluble, filterable 
antibiotics. 

If antibiotics are to find a place in the control 
of soil- and seed-borne plant pathogens, their ability to 
remain in an active state for some time may be an important 
character. Considering that seedlings are most susceptible 
to infection by certain microorganisms during the interval 
between germination and emergence, it seems likely that if 
adequate protection can be provided at this time, the chances 
for the production of healthy plants would be greatly in¬ 
creased. Since the antibiotic activity of actidione is 
maintained in the soil for several days whereas that of 
streptomycin is not, the former antibiotic may have a wider 
field of usefulness than the latter in the control of 
plant disease.

SUMMARY 


1. Two spore-forming bacteria of known identity, 
namely, Bacillus subtilis (A32) and Bacillus polymyxa 
(A.T.C. 7070) were tested for antibiotic activity 
against Ophiobolus grandnis , Fusarium culmorum and 
Helminthosporium sativum on potato dextrose agar and 
in sterilized soil. 

2. B. subtilis (A32) was antagonistic to 0. graminis , 
F. culmorum and H. sativum while B. polymyxa (A.T.C. 
7070) failed to inhibit 0. graminis and Id sativum 

and only slightly inhibited F. culmorum on potato 
dextrose agar. 

3 . B. subtilis (A32) suppressed 0. graminis t but 
had no apparent effect on the growth of F. culmorum 
and H. sativum on a sterilized soil-cornmeal medium. 

B. polymyxa (A.T.C. 7070), on the other hand, had no 
effect on the growth of any of these fungi on this 
medium. 

A« Out of 66 isolates of^spore-forming bacteria 

obtained from different local soils, 31 were antagon¬ 
istic to 0. graminis , 40 were antagonistic to F. 
culmorum and 36 were antagonistic to H. sativum on 
potato dextrose agar.

5. A number of individual spore-forming bacterial 
isolates failed to reduce the severity of attack by 
0. graminis , F. culmorum and H. sativum on wheat 
seedlings grown in sterilized soil under the conditions 
of the greenhouse experiments, 

6. A mixture of spore-forming bacteria isolated from 
a sample of Edmonton black soil, had little if any 
effect on the ability of 0. graminis (S.P.-l) to 
attack wheat seedlings at the temperatures 15°, 20°, 

25° and 30°C. 

7. Infection of wheat seedlings by 0. graminis 
(S.P.-l) occurred at 15°, 20°, 25° and 30°C., the 
most severe damage being caused at 15°, 20° and 
25°C. However, plants grown at 3C°C. showed severe 
lesioni'ng of seminal roots and sub-coronal internodes 
but vigorous secondary roots that were almost free 
from infection developed at their crowns. 

Out of 44 actinomycetes isolated from soil and 
tested on potato dextrose agar, $ were antagonistic 
to 0. graminis , 3 to F. culmorum and 13 to H. sativum . 
Three isolates were antagonistic to all three fungi. 

The persistence in soil of the antibiotics 
streptomycin and actidione was measured by a seedling

method and by a sensitive-microorganism method. The 
latter was found to be the more practical as a 
laboratory procedure. 

10. Streptomycin was immediately inactivated when 
added to soil. 

11. Actidione retained a high proportion of its 
activity for 9 days in natural soil and for at least 
50 days in sterilized soil.
