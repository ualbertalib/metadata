INTRODUCTION 


Paraffin hydrocarbons of low molecular weight are 
available in tremendous quantities, and the problem of 
their utilization has not yet been solved satisfactorily. 

The problem of transportation limits the use of 
these gases as fuels. The possibility of chemical 
conversion to useful liquid products, easily transportable, 
offers a field of investigation. 

The most promising reactions of hydrocarbons from 
the point of view of economic investigations, may be 
classified as follows: 

1* Pyrolysis. 

2. Halogenation. 

3, Oxidation. 

Pyrolysis of the lower homologues of the gaseous 
hydrocarbons requires high temperatures. However, as the 
molecular weight increases, cracking takes place at suc¬ 
cessively lower temperatures. The ultimate products of 
pyrolysis are carbon black and hydrogen or water. Control¬ 
led pyrolyses will yield acetylene, olefines and aromatibs, 
to the extent of 12 per cent or so of the methane. The 
process is not economical, but is sometimes used as a

source of hydrogen. 

The higher homologues of the gaseous paraffins may 
be pyrolyzed readily to form olefines as one of the main 
products. These olefines can be polymerized either sim¬ 
ultaneously or individually to produce naphthenes, aroraat 
ics and other high molecular weight hydrocarbons. The 
largest percentage of the olefines are at present poly¬ 
merized to produce motor fuels, and low boiling point 
hydrocarbon fractions, which are used as solvents in the 
chemical industries. 

Perhaps the greatest success in the manufacture 
of chemical compounds from natural gas has resulted 
from chlorination. The commercial preparation of mono- 
chloro-methane is now being carried out successfully. 

This compound may be hydrolysed to produce methanol, 
but it is also of use itself, as a refrigerant, and in 
the d^e stuff industry. Other chlorination products 
such as chloroform and carbon tetrachloride can be made, 
but not cheaply enough as yet, to compete with other 
established methods for preparing them. various chlor¬ 
inated derivatives of pentane have been made on a commere 
ial scale, usually with subsequent conversion to amyl 
acetate, for use as a solvent. 


Oxidation is a promising reaction in view of the 





- 3 - 


number of reactions possible, and the variety of useful 
products such as alcohols, aldehydes, acids and resins that 
may be produced. Investigations have been made not only 
with a view to improving the yields of useful products, 
but also with a view to obtaining information regarding 
the mechanism of oxidation of hydrocarbons. The results 
of previous investigations are reviewed briefly in the fol¬ 
lowing section.

LITERATURE REVIEW 


The oxidation of hydrocarbons has attracted con¬ 
siderable attention not only because of its practical 
importance, but also because of its scientific interest. 

The most important and comprehensive investigation 
has been carried out by .bone and various collaborators, 
since about 1900, irrom results of his early investiga¬ 
tions, (Z ) Bone proposed the "Hydroxylation Theory" 
of the course of the oxidation of hydrocarbons. Accord¬ 
ing to this theory, the hydrocarbon molecule is oxidiz¬ 
ed in a series of consecutive operations, in which oxygen 
is gradually introduced into the molecule, and distribut¬ 
ed between carbon and hydrogen. The stages may be rep¬ 
resented as follows: HgG

The early researches did not provide much evidence 
for the Hydroxylation Theory, Bone and Drugman (3 ) 
found water and formaldehyde among the first oxidation 
products of methane, below its ignition point. Methanol, 
the primary product postulated by the Hydroxylation

Theory, was not found. .Bone and Wheeler H > obtained 
considerable quantities of formaldehyde, with water 
and a small amount of formic acid, which provided further 
evidence for the hydroxylation theory. No methanol 
could be detected however. 


A characteristic of all direct oxidation experi¬ 
ments on methane and other gaseous hydrocarbons, at 
atmospheric pressure, is the production of aldehydes. 

To explain this, certain investigators postulated the 
initial formation of a peroxide, by the direct addition 
of an oxygen molecule to a hydrocarbon molecule, follow¬ 
ed by decomposition to aldehyde and water, thus:

The peroxide theory has received considerable sup¬ 
port in the past, but the evidence for it has all been 
obtained from investigations of the combustion of high¬ 
er hydrocarbons. Callender (/£ ) , Brunner and Rideal(^ ) 
and Dumanois (14 ) favor this theory in connection with 
the combustion of gasoline hydrocarbons. 





-6- 


Egerton (/£ ) believes in the formation of a tempor¬ 
ary peroxide, which can decompose to form aldehyde and 
water molecules, these product molecules being in a high 
energy state, and able to activate other fuel molecules 
or oxygen molecules, and so initiate a reaction chain* 

Edgar ( /5 ) in studying the oxidation of octanes and 
similar hydrocarbons, found evidence for peroxide form¬ 
ation doubtful; neither did Edgar find evidence of al¬ 
cohol formation. At least for these higher hydrocarbons, 
the results suggested that oxidation to aldehyde and 
water is the primary step; each succeeding step consist¬ 
ing of the oxidation of the aldehyde to the next lower 
aldehyde, with formation of carbon dioxide. 

Thompson and Hinshelwood {2V) suggest that while 
"the first stage of the reaction is the formation of 

an unstable peroxide---- there is no doubt that 

bone f s interpretation of the complete course of oxid¬ 
ation as a process of successive hydroxylation is essen¬ 
tially correct. 0 and that "the two views are not incom¬ 
patible, and a combination of them suggests an explan- 
ation of the facts. 

However, in no case has evidence of peroxide formation 
been obtained before the formation of aldehydes, towards 
the end of the induction period. The appearance 01 




- 7 - 


peroxides concomitant with aldehydes is of less sig¬ 
nificance, because aldehydes form peroxides fairly read¬ 
ily. Furthermore, peroxides have not been found at all 
in investigations carried out on simple hydrocarbons. 

j?or these reasons, Bone is rigidly opposed to the theory 
that peroxides are formed as an initial step in the 
combustion of hydrocarbons, at least with respect to the 
lower members. 

Further evidence for the Hydroxylation Theory was pro¬ 
vided by Layng and Sonkup ) who oxidized methane in 
the presence of oxides of nitrogen, and obtained small 
quantities of methanol, the primary product in Bone*s 
Eydroxlation Theory. Catalysts such as copper, silver, 
oxides of these metals, barium oxide, platinum oxide 
and activated charcoal, all proved unsatisfactory on the 
basis of hydrocarbon consumed and products obtained. 
Small amounts of nitrogen oxide were found to promote the 
oxidation reaction. Auxiliary catalysts used with the 
nitrogen oxide appeared to have little effect. Methyl 
nitrite was found to have a promoting action on the 
partial oxidation of hydrocarbons. 

Bibb and Lucas (/ } obtained fair yields of form¬ 
aldehyde in the partial oxidation of natural gas by air, 
using nitric acid as a catalyst. 







-8- 


None of the oxidation processes at atmospheric 
pressure have resulted in production of appreciable 
quantities of methanol. Uristesco (/5 ) has reported a 
process at atmospheric pressure, and relatively low 
temperature, giving large yields of methanol by the 
oxidation of methane. The procedure described eonsists 
of bubbling gas mixtures through boiling water, contain¬ 
ing submerged catalysts. fields as high as 57 fo are 
reported, upon passage of a mixture of three parts air 
to one methane, through the apparatus containing lead 
oxide, with copper oxide as supplementary catalyst. 

Good yields of ethanol are reported, using a gas mixture 
of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. An attempt to duplicate 
the results was unsatisfactory, ( 2 . 3 ) 

On the whole, investigations have shown conclusiv¬ 
ely that yields of methanol or formaldehyde of commerc¬ 
ial interest, cannot be obtained at atmospheric pressure. 

Writing the reactions of Bone’s Hydroxylation 
theory stoichiometrically, it is seen that methanol and 
formic acid are produced with a decrease in volume, 
whereas formaldehyde involves an expansion: 

(1) 2 GH 4 s- Op-- 2 OH g OH 

(2) 2 CHgOH+Og-2GHgO 2 H^O 


(3) 2 CHgG+Qg - 2 HCOOH 








- 9 - 


Hence, the effect of increasing the pressure in the re¬ 
acting system would be to favor the survival of methanol 
and formic acid, at the expense of the formaldehyde. 

For the purpose of raising the yield of methanol in this 
way, and also to obtain further information into the 
oxidation mechanism of hydrocarbons, work at high pressures 
was initiated by various investigators. 

Yoshikawa {Z(.) investigated the pressure range 
12 to 100 atmospheres, using a flow method. He found 
an increase in pressure favored survival of methanol. 

Newitt and Haffner {'%) using a static method, 
obtained small yields of methanol. The effect of increas¬ 
ing the pressure from 48 to 150 atmospheres was to in¬ 
crease: (1) the rate of reaction for any given tempera¬ 

ture, (2) the amount of methanol and formaldehyde in 
the product, and (3) the ratio of methanol to formal¬ 
dehyde in the product. 

Pechler and Reder [Z/) carried out a series of flow 
experiments at 100 atmospheres pressure, using various 
concentrations of oxygen. Yields of alcohol cased on 
total carbon burned were as high as 22.3^>. 

Newitt and Szego [19 ) carried out a systematic 
investigation, with the object of discovering the oxder

of formation of various oxidation products, and the 
optimum conditions for their survival, A flow method 
was used, and the temperature, pressure, rate of flow 
and oxygen concentration adjusted to obtain the optimum 
survival of useful products. Pressures up to 50 atmos¬ 
pheres, and temperatures between 290 degrees C. and 
340 degrees C., were examined. Investigations were made 
on methane and on ethane. By diminishing the inlet 
oxygen concentration, the yield of alcohol was raised 
to 50 io of the methane burned, or to 60^ of the ethane 
burned. Ho unsaturates nor peroxides ?/ere found. 

These experiments and those of other investigators, 
demonstrated that a low oxygen concentration is necessary 
for good yields of useful products. 

Boomer and Broughton ) passed mixtures of oxygen 
and natural gas, at pressures from 100 to 130 atmospheres, 
and at various temperatures between 300 and 350 degrees, 
over various catalysts. The production of methanol, 
with small amounts of formaldehyde and formic acid was 
observed. Yields of these three products as high as 
37 °/o of the carbon oxidized were obtained. With an 
empty steel reactor of reaction space 7.5 cc, the 
oxidation proceeded rapidly and to completion, giving 
carbon oxides and water. Using oxide catalysts in the 





- 11 - 


reactor, barium peroxide, vanadium pentoxide or blue 
tungstic oxide, gave no appreciable yields of useful 
products. Copper and silver were more efficient in the 
production of methanol, but these two cannot be compared 
since the forms of the catalysts were different. 

Wiezewitch and ifrolich f Z5) oxidized under pres¬ 
sure various natural gases with oxygen, in contact with 
various catalysts, and determined the optimum conditions 
for the survival of useful products. They found that 
yields were high only if oxygen concentration was low. 
.Metallic catalysts, e.g. calcium, chromel, silver and 
aluminum gave better results than empty tubes. 

Boomer and Thomas ( ) passed mixtures of natural 

gas substantially methane, and air in various proper- 
tions, over catalysts and determined the effects of the 
variables, composition, pressure, temperature and space 
velocity. Mixtures containing 3 to 15>o oxygen as air 
were used. Temperatures between 350 degrees and 500 
degrees, pressures between 140 and 230 atmospheres, 
were examined. Methanol was the principal product and 
yields as high as 74> on the basis of carbon oxidized 
were obtained. Copper was the principal catalyst used. 

They concluded that the yield of useful products depends 
primarily on the catalyst, the oxygen concentration, 




- 12 - 


and the temperature. The effect of time of reaction 
and of pressure, within the limits studied, was small. 

They concluded that the action of the catalyst was two 
fold: (1) to provide a surface easily oxidized and 
reduced and (2) to aid in the dissipation of the heat 
of the reaction. They believed gas phase reactions and 
lack of temperature control to be detrimental. 

Boomer and Thomas (% ) carried out similar investi¬ 
gations using mixtures of pure methane containing some 
nitrogen, and oxygen. As for the experiments on natural 
gas, survival of useful products decreased as oxygen 
concentration was raised. The percentage of carbon 
oxidized showed a maximum, and the yield of useful prod¬ 
ucts began to fall off rapidly, at about oxygen. 

The effect of pressure was not the same as for natural 
gas, for which it had little effect between 140 and 250 
atmospheres. With pure methane, the yield passed through 
a maximum at 184 atmospheres pressure, for low oxygen 
concentrations; for high oxygen concentrations pressure 
had little or no effect. Temperature showed a maximum 
yield at about 450 degrees 0. The effect of rate of flow 
was not significant over the range examined. The above 
observations were made using a copper catalyst. 

Experiments were also made using an empty reactor, 



- 13 - 


and catalysts of glass, Ni-Cr steel, and silver. As for 
natural gas, the yields using an empty reactor were poor, 
and varied erratically. Glass was as good a catalyst 
as copper, which was not expected because the poor heat 
conductivity of glass would make temperature control poor. 
It was suggested that the reaction took place on the 
copper walls of the reactor, and the glass acted merely 
to suppress undesirable gas phase reactions. Ni-Cr steel 
gave poor yields and control was difficult. This was 
expected since it is difficultly oxidized and reduced. 
Silver was similar to copper, as might be expected from 
the similarity of the two metals in other respects. 

The form of these catalysts was not the same and a 
comparison of them may be open to question. 

On the theoretical side, Norrish (20} has proposed 
a theory to explain the minor products of the reaction, 
and the kinetics of the reaction, more satisfactorily 
than Bone's Kydroxylation theory. 

Norrish assumes as primary reactions: 

0 1- CX 4 —> GHg- 4-HgO 
CH 2 : + Og —*CHgO 1- 0 

a chain reaction, which may be terminated by either 



























- 14 - 


of two ways: 

0 + GH 4 + X —^GH 3 0H + X ' 

0 -i- surface —^ J-Og 
where X is a third molecule. 

From these equations it is seen that an increase in 
pressure favors the survival of methanol since a ternary 
collision is required for its formation. A reasonable 
explanation of the predominance of aldehydes at low 
pressures is given by the theory. Norrish also claims a 
satisfactory interpretation of the kinetic data on oxid¬ 
ations of hydrocarbons. 

boomer and Thomas (K ) propose a theory for the mech¬ 
anism of the reaction^ combining features of both Boners 
Hydroxylation theory, and of Norrish f s chain reaction 
theory. 

Evidence is offered for the occurrence of two primary 
reactions, (1) a surface reaction between methane and oxygen 
resulting in formation of methanol, and so desirable and 
(2) a homogeneous gas phase reaction, between oxygen 
and methane, resulting in formaldehyde and gases, and so 
undesirable. 

lor the surface reaction the oxygen may be absorbed 
on the catalyst surface, or combined with it: 














- 15 -

GH 4 4- Os -t5>0H 3 0H 

GH 4 + CUgO —?€H 3 0H 4- 2Cu 

The methanol may survive or proceed to formaldehyde and 
formic acid, by Bone f s mechanism through further oxidation. 
This reaction is required by Bone as the first stage in 
the oxidation of methane; it is also postulated in Norrish’s 
theory, occurring as a chain breaker. 

The homogeneous reaction is taken from A/orrish *s 
theory as: 

CH 4 +- C^-p-GEz : +- HgO (2) 

CHg: + G.-^CHgO +" 0'*' (3) 

a chain reaction that is broken by (1J above. The occur¬ 
rence of the following reactions are postulated also: 
nCHg: {CHg)n (4) 

CHgO -—£>00 4 Hg (5) 

CHgO +h0 2 —CO 4- HgO (6) 

all of which are known to occur in other work, 

The present investigation is a continuation of that 
made by Boomer and Thomas, The optimum conditions of 
oxygen concentration, pressure and temperature, as found 
by them, have been used; and various metals in the same 
form used as catalysts, in an attempt to find the oest 
catalyst for the survival of methanol.

The theory for the mechanism of the reaction, as 
proposed by then.has been used in an attempt to explain 
the observations made.

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 


M ATERIALS 

Natural gas from the Viking field was used. The 
composition of this gas determined by ordinary combustion 
analysis was approximately: 


ch 4 

90.8$ 

G 2 H 6 

3.5 $ 

N 2 

5.7 $ 


Higher hydrocarbons such as propane were present in small 
amounts, and are included in the ethane figure. The 
gas was odorized with mereaptans and alkyl disulfides. 

The higher hydrocarbons and the sulfur compounds were 
removed by a method of purification, which is described 
in a later section. 

The oxygen used was the commercial gas obtained from 
liquid air and compressed in steel cylinders. 

Catalysts were used in two forms, viz., in the form 
of blocks about 3/16” square and 3/32” thick, and in 
the form of gauze. The reactor, which is described in 
detail in a later section, was tubular in shape, with a 
smaller tube, the thermocouple well, entering one end and 
















- 18 - 


projecting half-way into the reactor. Rings of gauze 
were punched out of a sheet to fit snugly into the 
reactor and pass over the thermocouple well. These 
rings were packed into the reactor up to the level of the 
thermocouple well; the remainder of the reactor was pack¬ 
ed with gauze discs. The gauze used was about 60 mesh, 
the diameter of the wire being about 0.006 inch. 

For both forms of catalyst, the original metal was 
copper. To obtain other surfaces, the copper blocks, 
or discs and rings punched from copper gauze, were elect¬ 
roplated with the desired metal. In the form of blocks, 
copper and nickel surfaces were investigated; in the form 
of gauze, copper^silver, nickel and zinc surfaces were 
investigated. 


The solutions used for electroplating were chosen 
from those suggested by Blum and Hogaboom 3 ) * Their 
compositions and the operating conditions recommended 
are as follows:

until a fine grained, adherent deposit was obtained. 


At the points where the wires of the gauze crossed, 
plating did not occur and copper was left exposed. 

The inside of the reactor also was copper plated, but

APPARATUS 

Gas Purification System 

The method used was essentially that described by 
Boomer^ Johnson and Thomas ( 9 j• The apparatus is shown 
in Figure 1 « The process consisted essentially of 

cracking the higher hydrocarbons and sulfur compounds 
and then removing the undesired products of the reactions. 

The flow of gas was controlled by observing the 
flowmeter, A, and manipulating the inlet stopcock. 

The gas was passed through a calcium chloride drier B, 
to a f tT quartz tube G } heated to 825° G over a length 
of 12 inches, in which conversion of the ethane, heavier 
hydrocarbons and sulfur compounds in the natural gas 
to liquids, methane, olefines, hydrogen, and hydrogen 
sulfide occurred. The gas then passed through a glass 
wool filter D, to remove most of the tar, through a soda- 
lime tower E. to remove sulfur compounds, and to an 
activated charcoal absorber F, which removed the heavier 
hydrocarbons to a great extent. The gas was next scrub¬ 
bed by sulfuric acid in the tower, G, holding about 
400c,c. concentrated sulfuric acid containing about Ufa 
silver sulfate as catalyst. The acid was heated to 70°G 
with a gas burner. Continuous circulation of hot sulfuric

acid was obtained by the glass and mercury pump tf, as 
shown. The olefines were removed in this scrubber. The 
sodium hydroxide scrubber H, removed any sulfur dioxide 
produced by the reduction of the sulfuric acid in the 
scrubber or by oxidation of the sulfur compounds. The 
gas was then passed over 2 kilograms of copper oxide 1, 
at 300°C., which oxidized the hydrogen and carbon mon¬ 
oxide to water and carbon dioxide. The bulk of the water 
was retained in the water trap, after which the gas was 
led through a smaller copper oxide tube at the same 
temperature, to remove the last traces of hydrogen. A 
soda lime tower removed carbon dioxide produced over the 
copper oxide. 

The temperature of the pyrolysis furnace was main¬ 
tained by means of an automatic controller. The temper¬ 
atures of the copper oxide furnaces were controlled man¬ 
ually^ through rheostats in the power supply. 

No ethane nor heavier hydrocarbon was present in 
the gas purified in this manner. The gas did contain 
about 0.$ of olefines. This gas was used for some of the 
earlier experiments; for later experiments an attempt was 
made to decrease the olefines surviving, by modifying 
the apparatus. A second pyrolysis furnace, also heated to

- 24 - 


825 ° G, followed by an activated charcoal absorber, was 
used before the gas entered the sulfuric acid scrubber* 
In this furnace some of the olefines was polymerized 
to heavier hydrocarbons, which were removed by the char¬ 
coal absorber. In addition, the gas was scrubbed by a 

cu' :d 

second sulfuric^scrubber of similar design, and placed 
directly after the first scrubber* With these additions 
the gas contained 0.1 to 0 , 2 % opines. 

The purified gas was stored in water sealed gas 
holders. About 6 % oxygen was added to the gas in the 
holders, from a cylinder ofccmpressed oxygen gas* 

The mixture was pumped through a large steel bottle 
containing calcium chloride to remove water, and into 
the high pressure storage system. 

The high pressure storage system was of such cap¬ 
acity that the pressure drop during an experiment was 
relatively small^about 50 pounds per square inch. 

Reaction System 

The reaction system is shown diagranimatically 
in Figured. From the high pressure storage the gas 
passed through two steel bottles A and B containing 
calcium chloride and activated charcoal respectively.

The calcium chloride removed the last traces of water; 
the activated charcoal removed heavy hydrocarbons aris¬ 
ing from oil vapor in the compressor, etc, A contin¬ 
uous sample of the in-let gas was drawn off through 
the heated expansion valve C, into the constant head 
sample bottle D. A record of the pressure during a run 
was obtained by means of the recording pressure gauge,E. 
This gauge was calibrated by comparison with a dead 
weight piston gauge. The gas mixture was passed through 
the reactor E, directly to the bottom of the water- 
cooled high pressure condenser G. The gases leaving 
the high pressure condenser were expanded to atmospheric 
pressure through the heated expansion valve H. The 
condenser G was chromium plated on the inside, the 
expansion valve was bronze, and all tubing after the 
reactor was copper to resist corrosion by the products 
of the reaction. The removal of methanol, formaldehyde 
formic acid, and water from the off-gas was completed 
by means of the ice condenser J, the water scrubber K, 
and the calcium chloride tube L. The flovjmeter N, 
indicated the rate of flow of the off-gas. The total 
volume of gas passed was recorded by the calibrated 
wet test-meter 0. A continuous sample of the off-gas 
was obtained in the constant head sample bottle M. 





- 27 - 


The reactor E, is shown in detail in Figure 3 . 

The main body,B,of the reactor was constructed of high 
nickel-chromium steel. All other parts were cut from 
chrome-molybdenum steel bar. The inlet tube A,and clos¬ 
ure D, were cooled by running water in the tube H; the 
outlet tube,F, was similarly cooled by running water in 
the tube J*. Both the closure D, and outlet tube F, were 
fitted with a lining of glass tubing. Consequently, the 
reacting gases were at reacting temperature only in the 
catalyst chamber or when in contact with glass. The in¬ 
terior surfaces of the reactor were copper-plated so that 
the reacting gases did not come in contact with ferrous 
surfaces. The reactor was heated electrically as shown. 
The temperature was obtained by means of a calibrated 
Iron-Constantan thermocouple placed in the thermocouple 
well y G. The temperature was measured by means of a 
potentiometrie type of recording temperature controller 
which maintained the temperature constant to within two 
degrees. The catalyst was placed in the space of 


volume 12.7cc.

PROCEDURE 

After a new catalyst had been placed in the reactor 
and the reacting system re-assembled, traces of oil were 
removed by drawing petrol ether through the inlet-gas 
sampling valve C, through the reacting system, and out 
through the valve at the bottom of the high pressure 
condenser G. Air was drawn through to remove the ether 

vapors. 

The catalyst was then activated by alternate oxida¬ 
tion and reduction at the temperature at which the cata¬ 
lyst was to be investigated, viz,, 450°C. Air was used 
to oxidize the catalyst; hydrogen and methanol vapor 
were used as a reducing agent. 

In every experi.in.ent, after the pressure, temperature 
and rate of flow of off-gas had reached the steady state 
desired, the reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 to 
50 minutes before the experimental observations were 

necessary 

begun. This procedure wasn't: allow the catalyst to 
reach a steady state. Then the high pressure condenser 
was blown out; the gas meter was read, and the recovery 
system was connected to the expansion valve. The expan¬ 
sion valve was set with reference to the flow-meter. 

The inlet gas sample bottle was connected, and after the 
air had been swept from the recovery vessels, the off-gas 

















-30 


sample bottle was connected. The gas samples were col¬ 
lected over an aqueous solution of 20 fo sodium sulfate and 
5 °jo sulfuric acid. This solution did not dissolve signif¬ 
icant amounts of any of the constituents of the gas 
sample. The rate of flow of this solution from the sample 
bottles 5 and consequently the rate of sampling during 
and experiment^ was kept constant by means of a constant 
head aspirating device. In this manner representative 
average samples of inlet and off gases were obtained. 

At the conclusion of an experiment, the volume of 
the off gas sample was observed, and added to the reading 
of the gas meter. 

The liquid products were blown out of the high pres¬ 
sure condenser into the recovery vessels. The gain in 
weight of each item in the recovery system, and the total 
volume of off-gas were recorded. The efficiency of this 
recovery system had been demonstrated by Thomas (£3 ). 

The contents of the high pressure condenser, ice 
condenser and water scrubber were added to a 100ml. vol¬ 
umetric flask and made up to 100 ml, with distilled 
water. Aliquot portions were taken for the analysis 
of methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid. 

Samples of the inlet gas and of the off gas were 
analysed.

ANALYTICAL METHODS 

All analyses were made in duplicate. 

Gas analyses were carried out in a Burrell improved 
type of Bureau of Mines apparatus. Carbon dioxide was 
determined in potassium hydroxide solution, olefines 
in fuming sulfuric acid, and oxygen in potassium pyro- 
gallate solution. Carbon monoxide and hydrogen were 
determined by combustion over copper oxide, and paraffin 
hydrocarbons by combustion with oxygen over a heated 
platinum filament. 

The analyses of liquid products were made accord¬ 
ing to the technique developed by Boomer and Broughton 4, /o) 

Methyl Alcohol 

Methyl alcohol was converted into methyl nitrite, 
which was carried by a stream of inert gas into an acid¬ 
ified solution of potassium iodide. Hydrolysis of the 
methyl nitrite took place, the nitrous acid liberated 
reacting with the hydriodie acid, forming free iodine. 

The iodine was then titrated against a standard solution 
of 0.1,M sodium thiosulfate. Calculations were made on 
the basis that one molecular weight of sodium thiosulfate 
is equivalent to one molecular weight of methyl alcohol,

A five ml. aliquot of the diluted condensate was 
used for this determination. 


Formaldehyde 

Formaldehyde was determined by Romijn’s cyanide 
method (2Z) which is specific for this compound* A 
10 ml. aliquot of the diluted condensate was treated with 
an excess of 0.1N. potassium cyanide solution. A soluble 
addition product of formaldehyde and potassium cyanide 
forms, one molecule of formaldehyde combining with one 
molecule of cyanide. The excess potassium cyanide was 
determined an follows: After the sample had been treated 
with potassium cyanide it was washed into a flask con¬ 
taining a measured amount of 0.1N. silver nitrate solution. 
The excess cyanide precipitates as AgCN. This precipitate 
was filtered off, and the excess silver nitrate in the 
filtrate determined by titration against 0.1N. potassium 
thiocyanate, using ferric alum indicator. From the 






- 33 - 


above data, the amount of potassium cyanide which had 
been removed by formaldehyde could be calculated. 

Formic Acid 

A 10 ml. aliquot of the diluted condensate was used 
to determine formic acid. An excess of Q.05N. sodium 
hydroxide was added, and the sample heated to boiling to 
expel carbon dioxide. At the same time if any copper 
formate was present, a precipitate of copper hydroxide 
was obtained. This was filtered off, and the filtrate 
was back titrated with 0.05N. sulfuric acid. 

The pipettes and burettes used in the above deter¬ 
minations were calibrated, and the solutions which were 
likely to change in concentration, such as sodium 
thiosulfate and potassium cyanide, were checked from 


time to time.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 


The primary purpose of this investigation was an 
endeavor to find a better catalyst than copper blocks 
for the production of methanol by the direct oxidation 
of methane under pressure. The optimum conditions of 
temperature, pressure and oxygen concentration as found 
by Boomer and Thomas ( IT] were used in all experiments. 
These optimum conditions were determined using copper 
blocks as catalyst; they may not necessarily be the 
optimum conditions for the other catalysts examined. 

The present investigation however, attempts only a 
preliminary survey of some possible catalysts. 

Surfaces of copper, silver, nickel and zinc were 
investigated in the form of gauze. In all cases copper 
surfaces were present however, since the walls of the 
reactor were copper plated. Also, some copper was left 
exposed on the gauze when it was electroplated with the 
metal being investigated. 

A series of experiments was made using copper 
blocks, in order to compare the efficiency of the gauze 
form of catalyst with the block form. 


Nickel also was examined in the form of blocks, as

well as gauze. 

All calculations of yields based on 100 litres 
of inlet gas at jn.T.P. The ratio of the volume of inlet 
gas to off-gas varied so that yields cannot be compared 
on the basis of the off-gas volume. Since the volume 
of in-gas was not measured directly, the volume conversion 
factor between the inlet gas and the off-gas was found 
by using a carbon balance, as described by Broughton (i° ). 
The total carbon content of the liquid products and the 
off-gas Vi/as calculated. From this quantity, and the 
carbon content of the in-gas, the volume of in-gas which 
had entered the reactor was calculated. This method 
assumes of course, that all the carbon entering the 
system was accounted for in the products. The analytical 
methods were confirmed by Boomer and Thomas (7 ) by 
ultimate analysis for carbon and hydrogen, and a carbon 
balance was believed to be reliable. However, they 
found that on the basis of a carbon balance the other 
elements involved did not show a good balance. The 
nitrogen balance and the hydrogen balance were fairly 
good, but the oxygen balance showed very great discrep¬ 
ancies. The same errors are present in this investigation. 
It has also been reported by Wiezewitch and Frolich [ZS). 
No explanation has been found.

Runs 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 show the results using 
copper blocks as catalyst. For the same conditions Boomer 
and Thomas ( 8 ) obtained yields of about 60 °/6 methanol 
on the basis of carbon oxidized. From the low yields 
of Runs 9 and 10 it was suspected that the catalyst was 
poisoned. Therefore, the reaction system was cleaned 
with petrol ether and the catalyst was reactivated. 

The yield was increased somewhat, as shown by Runs 12, 

13 and 14, but was still below that obtained by Boomer 
and Thomas. It is suggested that the relatively high 
concentrat ion of olefines in the in-gas may act as a 
poison. In subsequent experiments, gas containing less 
olefines was used. These experiments were carried out 
at different rates of flow. It is apparent that within 
the range examined, space velocity did not exert any 
significant effect on the yield of methanol. 

Runs 15 and 16 were made with the reactor packed 
with copper gauze. The survival of methanol was less 
than for the copper blocks. The catalyst was re-act- 
ivated in an attempt to raise the yield of methanol* The 
yield was improved, as shown by Runs 18, 19 and 20, and 
appeared to be steady. The yield was still considerably 
below the yield using copper blocks. This was not ex¬ 
pected.

According to the theory for the course of the reaction 
proposed by Boomer and Thomas (S ), methanol is formed 
by a surface reaction, and the homogeneous gas phase 
reaction is detrimental, leading to carbon oxides and 
water. The weight of copper used as catalyst form of 
blocks was 56 grams, the gauze catalyst weighed only 
58 grams. Hence there was more free space in the reactor 
when gauze was used, and therefore, more opportunity for 
detrimental homogeneous gas phase reactions. Blocking 
off part of the reactor with solid discs, thereby decreas¬ 
ing the free space might increase the survival of methanol. 

It is also probable that the larger surface area 
of the gauze promotes more rapid reaction, and consequently 
there is more heat liberated per unit of mass of copper, 
than is the case with copper blocks. Therefore, the 
conduction of the heat of the reaction away from the sur¬ 
face is probably not as rapid with the gauze as with the 
blocks, and consequently the surface temperature may be 
high. A lack of temperature control is probably respons¬ 
ible in part, for the decreased survival of methanol 
when gauze was used. 

The conclusion must be that gauze is not the best 
form of catalyst. Catalysts should be compared under 
optimum conditions, differences in their behavior being

most marked under the most favorable conditions, under 
unfavorable conditions all of the catalysts may be expected 
to approach the same inefficient state. Nevertheless, 
the results obtained using one of the metals in the form 
of gauze should be comparable with the other investigations 
made under the same conditions. A rating of the metals 
as catalysts is probably justified. 

Huns 21, 22 and 25 were made using the silver gauze 
catalyst in the reactor. fhe yield of methanol was lower 
than was obtained using copper in the same form, .boomer 
and broughton { fa) and boomer and Thomas [8~ ) found silver 
to be as good a catalyst as copper. However, in both of 
these previous investigations, the form of the silver 
catalyst was not the same as the copper catalyst \^ith which 
it was compared, in vidw of the fact that the form of 
the catalyst appears to exert considerable influence 
on the survival of methanol, comparison of silver and 
copper in the previous investigations is probably not 
justified. 

Tor the surface reaction boomer and Thomas ( S') 

ti 

consider that, oxygen may be absorbed on the catalyst 
surface or combined with the catalyst, for example, as 
suprous oxide---------. The surface reaction may be

On this basis, silver and copper should have similar 
properties as catalysts, since both are easiljr oxidized 
and reduced. However, silver can dissolve more oxygen 
than copper, and it is possible that the increased con¬ 
centration of oxygen in the surface promotes further 
oxidation, resulting in carbon oxides and water. The 
lower yields with silver in the present investigation may 
be explicable on this basis. 

Using the same principles, an explanation may be 
offered for the low yields observed with the zinc catalyst, 
used in nuns 27, 28 and 29. Zinc does not dissolve ap¬ 
preciable amounts of oxygen and very little activated 
oxygen will be available for reaction from this source. 
Furthermore zinc oxide when formed is stable. Reversible 
oxidation--reduction of zinc does not occur under the con¬ 
ditions of these experiments. Consequently, the mechanism 
proposed for the production of methanol is not possible and 
if it is the correct mechanism, little or no methanol 
should be produced with this catalyst. 

It will be observed that in the three runs made with 
zinc, Numbers 27, 28 and 29, the yields of methanol were 




- 43 - 


respectively 16.0%, 13.0% and 1.5%. It is suggested 
that during the first two runs the oxidation of zinc 
was not completed but that late in the second run or 
early in the third, the zinc had become completely 
oxidized. In the first two runs, the zinc surfaces still 
present may have promoted methanol formation. In the 
third run, only a zinc oxide surface was present, which 
was inert, or promoted only complete oxidation to carbon 
oxides and water. 

When removed from the reactor, the catalyst was a dark 
brown color, fhe deposit present was completely soluble 
in 2 N. HCl, indicating that it was not carbon, and leaving 
the possibility that it was zinc oxide, perhaps mixed 
with copper or copper oxide. 

In all other cases, the catalyst when removed from 

the reactor was quite bright. When gauze was used, there 
* •> 

were ripple marks on the layers of the gauze near the gas 
entry to the reactor, such as might be caused by the cor¬ 
rosion of a liquid. It is possible that most of the reaction 
occurred in this part of the reactor. 

The results of the investigations of the nickel cata¬ 
lysts are particularly interesting. Runs 24,25 and 26 
offer a comparison of nickel in the form of gauze with

other catalysts. It will be observed that the yield of 
methanol is slightly higher than for copper gauze. (Runs 
18, 19 and 20). Runs 30 and 31 were made with nickel 
blocks. These were obtained by electroplating the iden¬ 
tical copper blocks used in Runs 12, 13 and 14. compar¬ 
ing the two forms of copper and nickel, these catalysts 
are in order of effectiveness:- copper blocks, nickel 
blocks, nickel gauze and copper gauze. x he range of 
yields as per cent of carbon oxidized is from over 43% 
to 30%. The two gauze catalysts gave very similar yields 
suggesting that the form of catalyst is the predominat¬ 
ing influence. The specific influence of the metal is 
subordinated, as has been discussed above, by the detri¬ 
mental effect which results from too much surface per 
unit of mass. With blocks, a better form of catalyst, 
the specific influence of the metal is more apparent. 

Rickel undergoes oxidation and reduction with an 
ease which is intermediate between copper and zinc, 
furthermore, the overvoltage of oxygen on nickel, being 
quite low, suggests that the metal is a fair solvent 
for the gas. In these respects, it appears to satisfy 
the conditions favoring methanol production almost as 
well as does copper. Tor this reason it is not surpris¬ 
ing that it is quite similar to copper as a catalyst.

Nickel appears to promote more reaction than any 
of the other catalysts in that more methane is attacked 
to form partially oxidized products. In both gauze and 
block form, the percentage of carbon oxidized is higher, 
for the same initial oxygen concentration, than with the 
other catalysts. While more carbon is oxidized over 
copper blocks in experiments 9 and 10, it must be borne 
in mind that the yields of methanol are verylow. Nick¬ 
el shows for equal amounts of carbon oxidized a greater 
production of useful products than either silver or 
zinc and is equal to or better than copper. Comparing 
experiments lousing copper blocks^ and 50^using nickel 
blocks^l.51% and 1.52% respectively, of the carbon enter¬ 
ing the system is recovered as useful products. The 
total carbon oxidized is respectively 5.3$>and 4.09%. 

The production of carbon monoxide and hydrogen is relativ 
ely large over nickel; this result might be expected 
in view of the well-known activity of nickel in promot¬ 
ing reactions like the water gas and related equilibria. 

It is possible that the nickel catalyst may be modified 
to promote formation of methanol from this carbon mon¬ 
oxide, uertainly ? there is a possibility of great improve 
ment in the action of nickel and the possibility of a 
greater yield than with copper. It appears to be worthy 
of further study.

Since it is more active than copper, the optimum 
temperature for it may be below the optimum for copper. 
The effect of oxygen concentration, pressure and rate 
of flow may also be different. A knowledge of the effect 
of these variables on the yield might aid in explaining 
the similarity of the two forms of nickel, whereas a 
difference was observed with copper. In any case, under 
its optimum conditions nickel might be expected to be 
considerably better than copper. The conditions chosen 
for the series of experiments reported were those most 
favorable for the copper catalyst, and will not neces- 
sarilv be the best conditions for nickel* Further 
studies of nickel and possibly of alloys of nickel and 
copper^ should be made. The promoting effect of one of 
these metals on the other may result in better yields 
than that obtainable by either metal alone.

CONCLUSIONS 


The gauze form of catalyst has been compared with 
massive blocks for copper and for nickel. The massive 
blocks appear to be somewhat superior to gauze for the 
conditions under which the comparison was made. 

Nickel, silver, zinc and copper have been compared 
as catalysts in the form of gauze. None was found to 
be a good catalyst; nickel was best, with copper nearly 
as good. In the form of blocks } nickel and copper have 
been compared, Gopper was somewhat better. 

Although under the conditions examined none of the 
catalysts is good, it is Relieved that nickel is worthy 
of further investigation. It was superior to the other 
catalysts in promoting the most extensive oxidation of 


carbon.
