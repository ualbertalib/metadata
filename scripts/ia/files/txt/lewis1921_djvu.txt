FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS 
OF 


SOME OF THE PROPERTIES OF ALBERTA COALS, 

PART I. - 

Introduction . 

Very little work has been done on the investigation of 
Alberta lignites. The Department of Mines, Ottawa, and the 
United States Bureau of Mines have issued reports on the invest! 
gation of some of the properties of coals, but only brief refer- 
ences are made to lignites, and no reference at all is made to 
their storage possibilities. The bituminous and anthracite 
coals have so far claimed the attention of the coal investigator 
These coals have almost completely monopolised the shipping mar¬ 
kets of Canada and the United States, because of their higher 
calorific value and lower moisture content. 

The principal lignite fields of Canada are found in Alberta 
This coal supplies nearly all local demands, and, when used near 
the source of supply, is a very satisfactory and economical fuel 
for domestic as well as for power plant use* The increasing 
use of automatic stokers for boilers permits power plants to 
bum even the poorer grades of lignites very satisfactorily. 

As Alberta has an almost unlimited supply of this fuel, and 
but small demand, the Provincial Government has set about 










- 2 - 

investigating the possibilities of widening the coal market, 
and, as one means to this end, has established the Industrial 
Research Department at the University of Alberta, 

In October, 1920, tests were commenced in a preliminary 
way on storage, screening and weathering of Alberta coals 
by Mr. R, T, Hollies, under the supervision of Professor N. C, 
Pitcher. This work was taken over by the writer in October, 

1921. 

The results of the first year’s work were not entirely 
satisfactory, and showed the necessity of improved methods for 
carrying out the storage and screening tests. These improvements 
are described below. 

The methods of storage, screening and testing first used 
by the Department have been fully described in previous reports,' 
As much of the work on storage and screening carried out 
since October, 1921, has been of a routine nature following the 
lines described in the above reports, little emphasis is laid 
upon it in the present report. The difficulties to be overcome 
and the inaccuracies found are, however, discussed, and their 
bearing on the improved methods adopted is fully considered. 
Tables and curves illustrating the results of this routine work 
are only included when essential to an appreciation of the new 
wo rk.

Acknowledgement s . 

The writer wishes to acknowledge the helpful advice and 
kindly suggestions given him by Professor Stansfield, Research 
Engineer in Fuels, and by Mr. R. T. Hollies, Assistant Research 
Engineer in Fuels. Also, Mr. N. C. Pitcher, Professor of 
Mining Engineering, Mr. A. E. Cameron, Associate Professor of 
Mining Engineering, and Dr. K. A. Clark, of the Industrial 
Research Department, have at all times shown great interest in 
the work, and have always been ready to help with any diffi¬ 
culties that might arise. 

In research work, particularly in untrodden fields, the 
results at first obtained are seldom of a nature that give 
complete satisfaction; fortunate is the investigator who has 
so thoroughly grasped the situation as to obtain ideal results 
on his first attempt. The research work carried on by the 
writer, although on previously laid out lines, has proved no 
exception to the rule. The investigations of Mr. Hollies had 
not been carried on long enough to give many definite results. 
The continuation of this work along the same lines has now 
given sufficient results to enable some conclusions to be drawn. 

Results of Storage Tests . 

In the three methods of storage employed — M open,*’ 

”pit, H and w shed” -- the results on lignites graphically shown 
in plates I., II., III. and IV. clearly indicate that, for 








- 4 


small storage lots, the “open” storage is unsatisfactory, par¬ 
ticularly for the larger sizes of R.O.M., lump and egg. As 
Mr. Hollies pointed out, the smaller sizes store much better. 

The lots stored outside for one year are little more than a 
heap of dust, so completely do the lumps disintegrate when wea¬ 
thered. The results of pit and shed storage are much better. 
They show less the effects of weathering and consequent disin¬ 
tegration. 

The chemical properties of lignites when stored, in marked 
distinction to the physical condition mentioned above, show 
little change. Thus, the calorific values did not appreciably 
drop during the period of observation. This is shown graphi¬ 
cally in plates V. and VI. 

On examining the chemical results obtained, it will be 
noted that in many cases they are somewhat erratic. For example, 
after storage for one month the coal shows a higher calorific 
value and a lower ash content (see plates V., VI., VII., and 
VIII.). After storage for a longer period, a smaller screening 
loss appears than on the shorter period of storage (see plates 
I., II., III. and IV.). 

These discrepancies can be explained. In Alberta lignite 
coals there are lumps ranging from ten to one hundred and fifty 
pounds. When sampling a storage lot of coal (originally 1,000 
pounds in weight) one wheelbarrowful of about 250 pounds is 
taken. If a large lump of 150 pounds forms part of the sample, 



- 5 - 


the consequent result will be a very high percentage of lump; 
and if the lump is particularly pure coal the proximate analysis 
will show a high calorific value and a low ash. In coal that 
has a rock parting, a piece of this parting frequently adheres 
to one of the large lumps; the ash will then be abnormally in¬ 
creased and the calorific value greatly reduced. 

The same errors which have masked the chemical changes in 
the coal have also affected the results of the physical tests 
on the coal. The physical changes are so comparatively large, 
their tendency is clearly shown in spite of these errors. As 
an example of how chemical errors occur, in the Foothills 
coal, which ran 48 per cent, lump, pieces of rock occasionally 
were seen adhering to the large lumps. To test the effect of 
this on the accuracy of sampling the lump coal, two gross samples 
of about 800 pounds each were taken. In one sample a piece of 
rock (evidently a parting) was noted adhering to a large lump. 

In the other no parting was seen. After crushing, quartering 
and grinding in the ordinary way, two bottled samples were pre¬ 
pared for analysis. The sample containing the rock (a) showed 
an ash of 14.1 per cent., while the other sample (b) gave an 
ash of 10.6 per cent., each primary sample having been taken 
with equal care. The following table will show the actual 
results obtained with different sizes of this coal. (See next 
page.) The totals of columns 4a and 4b should be identical and 
equal to the percentage of ash in the R.O.M. if all the sampling 
were correct. Actually, column 4a, including the lump sample

with an ash content of 14.1$»totals to 13*34$, giving an error 
of 1.44$; while column 4b, with the lump sample of 10.6$ ash, 
totals to 11.66$, showing an error of 0.24$, which is a very- 
close check. This shows that the sample of lump containing the 
rock was less representative of the total. 

Experiments such as the above have led to the preparation 
of rules with regard to the minimum weight of a sample under any 
specified condition. Thus, in Bulletin 116, United States 
Bureau of Mines, a sample containing individual pieces of coal 
with a square inch surface should not be less than 1,000 pounds. 
Samples containing lumps with individual pieces averaging four 
square inches to a face (which is small for Alberta lignites) 
obviously should be much larger. The conclusion drawn in the 
above Bulletin was for the sampling of bituminous coal. The 


















- 7 - 


results obtained in the tests of this Department show that the 
percentages of rock and extraneous matter contained in a bituminous 
coal is much higher than in a lignite coal. In the latter the 
impurities are much more evenly distributed throughout the 
coal substance. The following table of results will show this.

The typical bituminous coal chosen, "Blue Diamond", showed 
an ash variation in the different sizes of from 1 7-5 to 25 * 4 %, 
while with the typical lignite this was only from 10.5 to 14 . 4 $. 
As in the cases tabulated on page 6, the total of column* **$ ash 
in R.O.M. due to each size” should equal the corresponding 
percentage in R.O.M. Actually, the error in the first case is 



























- 8 - 


2.18$, and in the second case only 0.12$. In general, no sample 
of bituminous coal obtained showed a close check, while every 
sample of lignite coal obtained checked to within one per cent. 
The large error in bituminous coal is due to a high percentage 
of extraneous matter, and the consequent errors in sampling 
which are difficult to overcome. 

Size of Storage Lots . 

From the considerations above, it is clear that larger 
lots must be stored if greater accuracy is to be obtained. In 
the past a single car load lot (of 30 tons) has been obtained 
of each coal. Carrying out the extensive program planned, it 
was impossible to set aside more than 1,000 pounds for the 
storage test on each size. To increase the storage lots, either 
the program must be curtailed, or several carloads must be ob¬ 
tained of one variety. But to store coal in such quantities is 
beyond the storage facilities of this Department. 

Proposed New Plan of Storage Work . 

Discussing the matter with Professor Stansfield and Mr. 
Hollies, it was agreed to continue the work at the University 
on its present scale with such improvements as could be made, 
but to regard it as only preliminary to work on a much larger 
scale to b© carried out later in cooperation with the operators 
and dealers. Only in this way can results be obtained to 
approximate those obtained in commercial storage. 

The plan suggested is to have storage heaps of coal for

each particular district, preferably from the largest producing 
mine. The coal operator might provide the ground space, and 
sell the coal to the Department at pithead price; then after 
the storage tests are complete he might buy the coal back at 
a reduced rate for local consumption. Tt was suggested that in 
each district heaps of 20 tons of R.Q.M. be put out at such 
times as would permit the sampling of different periods of stor¬ 
age to be made at one time. For example, the coal might be 
stored as follows:- 

20 tons stored, January 1st, 1922; 

20 tens stored, January 1st, 1923; 

20 tons stored, June 1st, 1923; 

20 tons stored, December 1st, 1923- 
Samples taken in January, 1924, would represent the products 
of one month, six months, one year and two years storage periods. 

It was decided to continue the present scale work, as the 
results obtained have some intrinsic value; but, more especially, 
because the experience gained with this work will save many 
mistakes when the larger scale work is undertaken; and the 
mistakes on a large scale are inevitably costly. 

Improvements in Storage Work . 

A number of galvanized iron cans with a capacity of 300 
pounds of coal have been purchased for the open storage work; 
while sacks containing 125 pounds.are used for pit and shed 
storage. For each period test, one can from the open, two 








. 


. 











. , . .. £ •

- 10 


sacks each from pit and shed are taken. Four period tests of 
one month, six months, one year and two years, are made on each 
of the five sizes (R.O.M., Lump, Egg, Nut and Pea) for each of 
the three methods of storage ("open", "pit” and "shed"). Henc$, 
for every carload of lignite coal received for testing, sixty 
samples are stored; this requires twenty cans for the open, 

40 sacks for the pit, and 40 sacks for the shed. 

To obtain a fair sample for each period test on any size, 
the cans and sacks are filled as follows. Five cans and sixteen 
sacks are set up in a row, on© shovelful of coal is put in each 
can and in each pair of sacks in rotation until the last sack 
is reached; then repeat with can number 1, until the required 
amount is obtained. The fifth can is tested as a standard on 
the coal as stored. 

Under the first system, approximately 1,000 pounds were 
stored in each of the three places, open, pit and shed, and ap¬ 
proximately 250 pounds were teJcen by shovelling for each period 
test. 

The present system has many advantages over the old, in 
that every sample is carefully weighed before and after storage, 
and so shows any change in weight due to oxidation or loss of 
moisture. This sample will more nearly approximate one chosen 
from a large storage heap, as only a relatively small surface 
is ez posed to the air; while, under the old system, the sample 
taken amounted to little more than what would be obtained from

taking the weathered portion from the outside of a large 
storage heap. 

Summary & Conclusion . 

The storage of coal in small lots has reached a point 
where the results obtained will warrant some conclusions being 
drawn and suggestions made to revise and improve the present 
conditions. 

1. At the end of one year the coal stored in the M open M 
is little more than a heap of dust, so thoroughly has it disin° 
tegrated by weathering. The calorific value, and the ash content 
have not changed appreciably. 

2. Coals stored for one year in the pit and shed show- 
less disintegration as a result of weathering. Their calorific 
value and ash content have not changed appreciably. 

3« The sizes, R.O.M., Lump and Egg, should b© stored in 
larger lots if a fair test is to be made on the physical and 
chemical change in the coal on storage. 

4. A new method of storage has been commenced. Coal re- 
ceived by the Department is now stored in cans and sacks. By 
this method the sampling is done in the laboratory before the 
coal is stored and should give a much fairer test of the physical 
and chemical change in the coal due to storage. 

5* Large scale storage in cooperation with the operator 
and large coal dealer is proposed and a scheme submitted. 

6. In conclusion it might be stated that the consumer 

















11a. - 


and operator can store the Alberta lignite coal for at least 
one year in the open,pit or shed without an appreciable loss 
of calorific value or increase of ash content. The results as 
to weathering are so erratic that no definite conclusions can 
be drawn, other than to say that the nut and pea coals show 
less disintegration in one year * s storage than the R.O.M., 
lump and egg.

PART II.- 
HEAVY SOLUTION TESTS. 

Intro duct ion . 

In comparing coals, the general procedure is to make a 
comparison on an ash-and-moisture-free basis. This method was 
employed for comparing all the different samples of different 
coals in the different periods of storage, and the results were 
found to be unsatisfactory. 

The ordinary method of working to an ash-free basis makes 
the tacit assumption that coal is composed of combustible matter 
of uniform heat value, associated with a varying amount of 
mineral matter. A consideration of this method led to the con¬ 
clusion that the combustible matter associated with mineral 
matter in what is known as ”bone coal” is probably far inferior 
in heat value to the combustible matter in the pure coal. This 
suggested the possibility of arriving at a more satisfactory 
comparison,by, for example, comparing coals on a bone-free 
basis, rather than on an ash-free basis. The first step to be 
taken was to compare the calorific values of the combustible 
matter in different portions of coal* 

It will be seen that, as the investigation proceeded, a 
method of attack differing from either of the above was found 
to be more satisfactory. 
















- 







































- 13 - 


Heavy Solutions . 

To compare coals on a bone-free basis it is necessary to 
separate a coal into the two parts (pure coal and bone coal) 
and to separately determine the calorific value and ash content 
of each product* Then, knowing the calorific value and ash 
content of pure coal, and the calorific value and ash content 
of bone coal, it is possible to compute the calorific value of 
a coal to a bone-free basis*. 

To separate a coal into the two parts (bone coal and 
pure coal), the fact that the bone content of coal has a higher 
specific gravity than pure coal is used* Then it follows that 
if a coal were placed in a solution of the correct specific 
gravity, the pure coal would float and the bone coal would 
sink* This principle has been used to separate pur© coal from 
bone coal by coal investigators for some time, but the process 
was found to be very slow and not very satisfactory* 

In ordinary practice, samples of coal ground to any desired 
size are placed in a series of solutions of suitable specific 
gravities, which may vary from 1.2 to 1*5* The float on the 
lighter solutions contains very little ash, and is taken to 
represent pure coal, while the sink in the heavier solutions is 
high in ash and is taken to represent bone coal. The coal, 
after being placed in the solution, is left standing for some 
hours to permit the heavier particles to settle* The float 
is then removed by skimming. This disturbs the sink, so.that

the mixture is again left to settle and again skimmed. This 
is repeated until nothing floats, then the remaining liquid is 
poured out and the sink is obtained. 

After discussing the above slo?7 method with Professor 
Stansfield it was decided to design a vessel in which, when the 
first separation was made complete, the float could be sealed 
off from the sink, then poured out and filtered. With this idea 
in view, four centrifuge cups were designed to fit the available 
centrifuge machine. The design was limited by the following 
conditions. The cups were to be made to fit the rings of the 
centrifuge machine, and the minimum weight of the coal sample 
was to be 25 grammes (which occupies approximately 40cc«). 

The capacity of the cup was to be such that the entire sample 
could be held either above or below the centre, and leave 
sufficient room for a parting, clear of either sink or float. 

Design of Centrifuge Cup . 

The cup is made in the form of a cylinder, 15*2cm. long, 
with a diameter of 3»6cm. , this being the diameter necessary 
to fit the rings of the centrifuge machine. The parting is mad© 
by means of a ring and a double cone fitting, as shown in the 
accompanying section. The slope of the sides of the cone 
and ring are made 60° to insure against particles lodging 
on the surface of either. The thickness of the ring and the 
diameter of the cone are calculated to jointly occupy a mini- 






.

mum of space. The cone is raised and lowered by a threaded 
rod (a), which passes through a metal strap (b) and enters the 
cone at the apex (K). The metal strap is fastened to the top 
of the cup by means of two set-screws (c) and (d). 

Loading the Centrifuge Cup . 

A solution which has no chemical effect on the coal is 
prepared of the desired specific gravity. In this work two solu¬ 
tions were used: one of calcium nitrate, with, at the tempera¬ 
ture cf the laboratory, a maximum specific gravity of 1.56; and 
one of calcium chloride with a maximum specific gravity of 1.4. 
The desired specific gravity was obtained by diluting one of 
the above solutions with water. A sample of 25 grammes of coal, 
ground to pass a 14-mesh screen, is placed in the cup, and 
then the metal strap (b), with the cone (K) raised clear of the 
centre ring (Fig.2) to permit a free passage of liquid and coal 

















:

to and from the bottom of the cup, is adjusted as shown in 
Fig.2. The remaining space is then filled with the liquid to 
within one centimeter of the top. 

Four cups are filled in this manner, each with a solution 
of different specific gravity, then placed in the rings of the 
centrifuge machine. 

The Centrifuge Machine . 


•<> 


The centrifuge machine consists of a small electric motor 
with a vertical shaft projecting upwards. On this is mounted 
a plate with arms (Figs.4 and 5)» Each arm contains a slot 
in which is placed a ring, held in position by two screws 
which are threaded through the arm and enter a recess in the edge 
of the ring, thus permitting only a vertical rotation of the 
latt er. 

The cups, which are in a vertical position when at rest, 
are so placed that their centre of gravity is below the ring. 

In motion the cups take a horizontal position and the bottoms 
of the cups are thrown to the outside of the circle of rotation. 
By the use of the machine, which rotates at 1150 R.P.M. , a 
complete separation is made in seven minutes. Fifteen minutes 
is adopted as a standard time.

When the machine comes to rest, the cups again take up 
their vertical position and, by means of the milled head on the 
threaded rod (a) in Fig.l, the cone (K) is screwed down on the 
ring (H) and so makes a water-tight joint. The cups are then 
removed from the machine, the float poured out and filtered; 
after which the cone is removed and the sink is filtered. 

The following coals have been subjected to the heavy solu¬ 
tion tests: 

(1) Drumheller, Monarch Mine, R.O.M. and lump; 

(2) Pembina, R.O.M. after one year in shed storage; 

(3) R.O.M. as above, followed by exposure in an open 
oven to a temperature of 110© for 90 hours; 

(4) Blue Diamond, R.O.M. after two month’s storage in 
the open.

Method of Calculating to a Bone-Free Base . 


From the above results the calculation of the calorific 
value of a coal to a bone-free base is made as follows? 

1st, Given the Ash on a dry basis as, say, 12J&; 

2nd, " " Cal.Val. M * 9 " M 11,000 B.T.U. 

Let x = the Calorific Value of the coal to a bone-free base,. 

Let a = % pure coal in the sample. 

Let b = % bone coal in the sample = 100 - a. 

From Table V. , page 18, above, the sink containing 43*9$ 
ash, which has a B.T.U. of 6510, is considered as bon© coal, 
and the float containing 4.4/£ ash is considered as pure coal* 
Then, from the above, 4,4 a + 43*9(100 - a) - 12.0 
a - 82.8/* 

b * 100 - a = 100 - 82.8 = 1?.2/ 

That is, the sample of coal chosen contains 82.8/ pure 
coal and 1?.2/ bon© coal. 

Since the Calorific Value of bone coal is 6,510, the 

















20 


calorific value of pure coal is x (B.T.U.)> and the calorific 
value of the sample of coal chosen is 11,000 B.T.U., 



11,000 B.T.U. 


whence x =

and Bone-and-Moisture-Fre & Basis . 

In the following table, the determined calorific value 
is shown of a number of samples, arranged in order of their

better than the standard ash-free basis. It was found, however, 
that from the results of the heavy solution tests it was possible 
to calculate with surprising accuracy the calorific value of 
other samples of a coal when their ash and moisture content were 
known. For example, from Table III., page 17, the sink containing 
43.2$ ash, has a calorific value of 6,420, and was considered 
as bone coal, and the float, containing 5*9$ ash, which has a 
calorific value of 12,280, was considered as pure coal. Using 
the above as a base, the calorific values of five samples of 
screened coals were computed and compared with the actual 
calorific values determined. The results check to within an 
error of one half of one per cent.*, as shown by Table XX.,below.

Method of Computing; the Calorific Value of a Coal 

From The Results of Heavy Solution Work . 

The computed calorific value of the coal is obtained as 

follows. 

Given the ash content of a coal is, say, 11.3^, (Table IX.). 






























- 22 


Let a = $ pure coal in sample * 

Let b = $ bone coal in sample = 100 - a, 

From Table III., page 17, above, pure coal has an ash 
content of 5«9$> with a calorific value of 12,280 B.T.U.» while 
bone coal has an ash content of 43»2$ with a calorific value of 
6,420 B.T.U. 

Then, from Table DC., above, the total ash content of FUO.M. 
is equal to 11.3$. 

Therefore, 5*9 x a * 43»2(10Q-a) ■ 11*3 
37-3 a - 3,190 
a * 85*6$ 
b - 100 - 85.6 ^ 14.4$ 

The calorific value of coal containing 100$ pure coal is 
12,280 B.T.U., and the calorific value of coal containing 100$ 
bone coal is 6,420 B.T.U., 

Then a coal containing 85 . 6 $ pure coal will have 85.6 12280 

100 9 1 '

and also as it contains 14.4$ bone coal will ha.ve 14.4 . 6420

Therefore computed B.T.U. of sample above = 10540+930 « 11,470 B.T.U.

bone coal and pure coal against their ash contents, the calori¬ 
fic value of any other value of intermediate ash content should 
lie on the straight line joining these two points, and this is 
found to be the case. Thus, from the heavy solution table, 

Table III., above, obtained from the Drumheller R.O.M., a straight 
line curve is obtained by plotting the calorific values against 
the ash. Then, from the curve* the calorific value for any 
Drumheller coal containing any percentage of ash can be obtained. 
For example, in Table 2X? in the column headed, "Heavy.Solution 
Curve, B.T.U.," the calorific values taken from the curve on 
Plate 9 &re a very close check on the computed and determined 
values. The same thing is shown on a coal of a different type 
in the following table.

As in Table IX., page 21, it will be noted that in no case 
is the error greater than one per cent, and in twelve out of the 
fifteen samples the error is less than one half of one per cent. 
The possibilities of error are more likely to occur in the 
determined calorific value than in the calorific value obtained 
from the curve. For, unless the ash, moisture and calorific 
value are obtained on the same day, the moisture content of 
the finely powdered coal may change considerably in the bottle 
containers. The usual practice is to obtain the ash and moisture 
content of coal samples almost immediately and, at a later date, 
to determine the calorific value of the samples. In fact it is 
not always possible to determine the calorific value on the same 
day the ash and moisture content are obtained, and in the inter¬ 
vening time the coal may take up moisture. 

The following table will show the absorption of moisture 
by six samples of air-dried lignite coals left in glass-stoppered 
bottles for fifteen days.

The moisture content of the coal, in the third and fourth 
columns of the above table, was obtained by further drying in 
an oven (in the presence of carbon dioxide gas) at a temperature 
of 106°C. for one hour and noting the loss in weight. 

The average increase in the six samples is shown to be 
four-tenths of one per cent., while the maximum increase is 
eight-tenths of one per cent* 

Effect of Increase in Moisture on Calorific Value of a Coal . 

The following example will show how the change in moisture 
will affect the calorific value of a coal. 

Let the moisture content equal 8^« 

Let the calorific value equal 10,800 B.T.U. 

The calorific value to a dry basis would be 11,740 B.T.U. 

Suppose the calorific value of 10,800 B.T.U. was obtained 
15 days after the moisture content had been obtained, and in the 
meantime the moisture had increased to a minimum of 8.4^, or a 
maximum of 8.8$, then the calorific value to a dry basis, as 
a minimum would be 11,790 B.T.U., as a maximum 11,840 B.T.U., 
which shows an error in one case of 50 B.T.U., and in the extreme 
an error of 100 B.T.U* The error in either case is distinctly 
above the working error of the calorimeter. 

By using the Heavy Solution Curve to obtain the calorific 
value, the error due to a subsequent change in moisture would be 
eliminated and at the same time many days labor in calorific

determination would be saved. When the calorimeter is used, 
the curve acts as a fairly accurate and quick means of detecting 
large errors in the determined results* 

Original Reason for Commencing Heavy Solution Work* 

When starting the heavy solution work the original idea 
was to use the results to compute storage samples to a bone-free 
basis for comparison. This implies that the bone coal would not 
change its calorific value on storage. To check the above assump¬ 
tion, a sample of Pembina R.Q.M. after one year’s storage was 
subjected to a' temperature of 11Q°C. in an open oven for 90 hours. 
This was regarded as the equivalent of very extreme weathering 
conditions. This test proved, as shown by curve sheet (Plate 11), 
on which are plotted the heavy solution curves of the coal before 
and after subjection to the above test, that the calorific value 
of both bone coal and pure coal deteriorates on weathering. 


Calorific Value on an Ash-Free Basis . 

^ V^ xtv 

The standard method to compare the calorific value of a 
coal is on the ash-and -moisture "free basis. In this Department 
the above method was used in an effort to get a constant relation 
with which to compare the calorific value of the stored coal. 

The results obtained did not check, and, as is shown by the 
heavy solution curves, plates 12 and 13 , the results, for a large 
range of ash content, do not check. The follow ing argument will 





V 









r.uc 















- 27 - 


show'why a comparison on this basis will give unsatisfactory 
results and is incorrect. 

Graphic Computation of Calorific Value 

on an Ash-and-Moisture-Free Basis . 

The heavy solution curve is a straight line, and, when 
produced to meet the axis at zero calorific value, does not pass 
through the point of 100$ ash, but meets the base, in the case 
of Drumheller coal, at the point of 85$ ash. In the case 
of other coals the corresponding point lies between 85$ and 
91$ ash. In the curves on Plates 12 and 13, the ordinary calo¬ 
rific value to an ash-fre© base can be obtained graphically by 
joining the point of 100$ ash with any desired percentage of 
ash on the heavy solution curve, and producing the line to cut 
the vertical axis. This point will give the required calorific 
value. Thus it will be seen that for varying percentages of 
ash a wide range of calorific values will be obtained. 

Ordinary Method of Computing to an Ash-Free Basis . 

Let the percentage of ash in a coal » 20$ 

Let the calorific value of the coal = 10,100 B.T.U. 

Then the calorific value to an ash-free base will be IQO . 10,100 

100-20 1 

= 12,630 B.T.U. 

By this we assume that a coal can be obtained with 100$ ash.

But, by the heavy solution curves of Drumheller, Pembina and 
Brule coals, 100$ ash is a theoretical and not a practical 
value. So long as there is combustible matter in the coal 
there must be heat formed on burning. 

It is possible that if a high enough percentage of ash could 
be obtained that the curve would continue in a straight line to 
almost meet the base at the practical point of no calorific 
value, and would then curve abruptly to meet the true zero 
calorific value at the 100$ ash point. The heat given out by 
the coal with an ash greater than 85$ would be negligible. 

New Method of Computing the Calorific Value 

to an Ash-and-Moisture-Free Basie . 

For the Monarch coal, 85$ is a point of practical zero 
calorific value; hence, to compute this coal to an ash-free 
base, a correction of 15 $ must be mad©, and the computation 
must be made with 85$ as the point of zero calorific value 
and not the point of 100$ ash as zero calorific value. 

Then the computation will be as follows. 

Let the ash content of a coal be 20$. 

Let the calorific value of a coal be 10,100 B.T.Ui 

Then the calorific value of the coal to an ash-free base 

will be _ 85 10,100 « 13,210 B.T.U. 

85 - 20 l 

Computations made with this correction will check with the 
























29 


values obtained from the heavy solution curve* 


Practical Application of the Solution Curve to the Laboratory * 

curve 

The heavy solution/can be used here to show the change 
in the calorific value of the coal after storage* For example, 
fifteen samples of Drumheller coal, Monarch mine, were stored 
as detailed on pages 9 and 10 above* After one month’s storage 
the calorific value of each sample was determined by the calo¬ 
rimeter and the calorific value corresponding to the percentage 
of ash content of each sample was taken from the heavy solution 
curve of the original coal, plate 9, The change in calorific 
value can be obtained by comparing the results in the following 
table.

value from the heavy solution curve (fourth column, above), 
shows an actual increase in every instance. 

The coals in the above table were carefully weighed befoEe 
and after one month's storage. The total moisture content of 
each sample was obtained. In the following table appear five 
of the above coals (open storage of R.O.M., lump, egg, nut and 
pea) which were chosen to show the change in weight due to 
oxidation and weathering. The results are somewhat erratic, 
which may be accounted for by the fact that the scales avail¬ 
able for weighing storage samples are not sufficiently accurate 
to show a slight change in weight.

In the above table the R.O.M. and Pea show losses in weight 
while the lump, nut and egg show slight increases in weight, but 
in every case there is an increase in calorific value, as shown 


















- 31 - 


by Table XII., above, which cannot be accounted for by the change 
in weight. The increase in calorific value is too regular and 
too marked to be due to errors in sampling or analysis, A 
probable reason could be suggested for this increase, but until 
further work is done, discussion on this point is premature. 

Commercial Application of Heavy Solution Curves . 

In most mining districts it is a comparatively easy matter 
to obtain the moisture and ash content of a coal, but to obtain 
the calorific value entails great difficulties and expense, 
besides requiring a skilled operator. If a heavy solution curve, 
as above, were obtained for a particular mine, then, knowing 
the moisture and the ash contents of the coal, the calorific 
value could be obtained directly from the curve within a maximum 
error of one-half of one per cent, on a coal with a calorific 
value of 12,000 B.T.U. 

Summary & Conclusions . 

1. A centrifuge cup has been designed by which the float 
can be sealed off from the sink and each product immediately 
obtained, without recourse to the usual slow method of settling 
tanks. 

2. The original idea, to compute the calorific value of 
a coal to a bone-free base, had to be abandoned as a result of 
a test which shows that bone as well as pure coal deteriorates 
on subjection to very extreme weathering conditions. 










- 32 - 


3. The heavy solution work for each district shows a linear 
relation between the calorific value and ash content of the coal. 
Each particular district requires its own heavy solution curve. 

4. The heavy solution curve can be o f practical use to 
large coal handlers and coal operators, to obtain quickly and 
accurately the calorific value of a coal. In the laboratory the 
curve can be used to show a change in the calorific value or 
ash content of a stored coal; also as a quick means of detecting 
a gross error in the determination of the calorific value or 
ash content. 

5. The heavy solution curve proves that, for the coals 
tested, a comparison of their calorific value cannot be made 
on the standard ash-and-moisture-free basis.
