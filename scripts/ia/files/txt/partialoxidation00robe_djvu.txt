Partial Oxidation of Butane 

Abstract 

Preliminary laboratory scale tests on the partial oxidation 
of butane have yielded the following results: 

1. The peak of the reaction, as indicated by the peak in the 
temperature of the reacting gases at various positions in the reactor, 
tends to alter position with a change in the time of contact* The 
presence of an induction period in the reaction is indicated by the 
time lapse between the introduction of the butane and the peak of the 
reaction* This period appears to be independent of the gas velocity, 
and to be of the order of 0.75 seconds. The indicated period of in¬ 
duction may be appreciably longer than the true one because of the time 
necessary to vaporize the butane which is introduced in the liquid 
phase. 

2. The percent of the carbon reacted that appeared as formal¬ 
dehyde, and as acetic acid, decreased rapidly with an increase in the 
time of contact. 

3* Acetaldehyde, acetone and methanol yields vary with contact 
time and all pass through a maximum. This indicates that they are 
intermediate products formed in the oxidation of butane to carbon 
oxides and water. 

4* The percent total carbon converted per pass reaches a 
maximum at a reaction time of 3 seconds, but this phenomenum is likely 
due to changing flow characteristics, the cause for which is inherent 
in the design of the reactor.

As a result of these preliminary tests certain changes in 
both the analytical technique and in the equipment design are re¬ 
commended for future experimental work. 

The reaction was carried out in a homogeneous gas phase within 
a 22 foot long helical coil constructed of 1/k inch I.P.S. type 304, 
stainless steel. The reactor was surrounded by a boiling bath of 
Aroclor 1254 at a temperature of 700° F. 

The inlet gas composition was as follows: 

(Volume Percent) 

Steam 6% 

Oxygen 5% 

Butane 2.5$ 

Nitrogen 86.5$ 

The pressure was maintained at 150 psia, and only the time of 
contact was varied from 0.8 seconds to 6 seconds.

Introduction 

The project upon which this report is based consisted of pre¬ 
liminary laboratory scale tests on the partial oxidation of butane. 
This project is part of a long term research program, initiated by 
the Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering of the University 
of Alberta, focused on the utilization of natural gas. The present 
work was carried out in the Department of Chemical and Petroleum 
Engineering, but was sponsored by the Research Council of Alberta. 

Butane is but one of the hydrocarbons present in natural gas, 
so let us examine the wider picture. 

With the discovery of oil and natural gas in Turner Valley, 
Alberta became the only major Canadian producer of petroleum. In 
the early years of the field®s production effective conservation 
methods were not practised. A large proportion of the natural 
gas accompanying the oil in production ms wasted, and thus a 
resource with a large market value was lost forever. 

In 193S the Provincial Government enacted legislation empower¬ 
ing the Alberta Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board to 
control the production of the Province ! s gas and oil resources. 

From the start of its production the recently discovered Leduc- 
Woodbend field has been produced by methods aimed at conservation 
of both the petroleum and the natural gas. 

The gas produced with the oil is at present gathered, and after 
processing at the Devon gas recovery plant, is used to supply the 
City of Edmonton. By-products from the gases treated, such as

propane and pentanes plus, are at present being marketed. The 
butane also produced will soon find a market with the completion 
in Edmonton of the petrochemical plant discussed later. 

It is believed that had the Turner Valley field been produced 
by conservative methods the ultimate future recovery of oil would 
have been greater and the present costs of production somewhat 
lower. 

Recent legislation by the Provincial Government has restricted 
the export of gas from the Province until such time as reserves are 
proven sufficient to meet the estimated future needs of Alberta. In 
all probability, the gas when exported will be stripped of its pro¬ 
pane and butanes plus, as well as its sulfur content. 

Besides being burned as fuel the lower paraffins making up nat¬ 
ural gas may form the starting point for the manufacture of a host 
of valuable chemical products. 

There are three major processes by which chemicals may be made 
from natural gas. These are: 

1. Pyrolysis 

2. Chlorination 

3. Oxidation 

Pyrolysis of paraffin gases yield mainly unsaturated compounds, 
both cyclic and non-cyclic which must be processed further to give 
saleable products. 


Chlorination processes give primarily glycols and chlorinated 
solvents. These must be marketed in competition with other established

processes. 

The partial oxidation of natural gas, on the other hand, yields 
directly a variety of products such as alcohols, aldehydes and ke¬ 
tones, and a variety of organic acids and esters. These are all 
easily marketable, and their production seems to have the most to 
offer gas-rich Alberta. 

The production of chemicals by the partial oxidation of natural 
gas is not a new idea. Until recently, however, the practical de¬ 
velopment was barred by technical problems. The higher hydrocarbons, 
saturated, non-saturated, or aromatic, can all be easily oxidized 
with good yield. Difficulty is encountered with the lighter paraffins. 
With a decrease in chain length the conditions required to initiate 
the reaction become more extreme. At the same time the increase of 
the free energy indicates an increasing tendency for the reaction to 
rush to completion once started. It is not surprising then that 
earlier workers, using batch processes, accomplished little more than 
the production of water and carbon oxides. They failed because of 
the difficulties involved in controlling the time of reaction and 
temperature.

In 1925 J. C. Walker of Cities Service Oil Co. discovered 
that the corrosion of pipe lines by gas containing quantities of 
oxygen could be minimized by heating the gas under pressure. The 
oxygen reacted with the surrounding gases and the formation of liquid 
oxygenated products resulted. The first commercial oxidation plant 
for the production of chemicals from natural gas was built by Cities 
Service at Tallent, Oklahoma in 1926. This plant has since been

expanded and three additional plants built. 

When Cities Service built their first plant very little was 

known of the mechanism of the oxidation reaction or the factors 

which influence its course. Some limited work had been done by 

( 2 ) 

Bone and co-workers around the turn of the century but the re¬ 
sults had been inconclusive. To date very little additional exper¬ 
imental data has been published. Some experimenta.1 data for methane 

(3) 

oxidation has been published by Boomer, but beyond this, little 
or no information is available that would be of aid in the design of 
a process. 

Celanese Corporation has recently entered the field with a large 
plant located at Bishop, Texas. They have made strides in accurate 
reaction control by such means as diluting the gas stream with nit¬ 
rogen and steam, and possibly by the use of selective catalysts. 
Celanese is at the present time building a butane oxidation plant in 
Edmonton for the production of cellulose acetate, and other products. 
The corporations which have processes utilizing oxidation must 
have accumulated detailed data. However, this detailed information 
is not released and the processes themselves are protected by patent. 

The proposed work on the partial oxidation of butane is one 
step toward filling the need for published fundamental data in this 


field

Literature Review 


(11) 

In 1934 Wiezevich and Frolich of the Standard Oil 
Development Company published some results of a pilot plant study 
of the oxidation of the lighter paraffin hydrocarbons (methane to 
pentane). The data published were extremely limited in scope. The 
products reported identified in the oxidation of n-butane were: 
acetaldehyde methyl alcohol 


propionaldehyde 
acetone 
acetic acid 
propyl acetate 


ethyl 
isopropyl 
n-propyl 
and isobutyl 


The reaction temperature was found to decrease with increased 
pressure, from 255°C« at 33 atm. to 210° at 160 atm. The effect 
of increased pressure was to favor higher alcohols and aldehydes 
over the lower alcohols and acids found at lower pressures. 

From the large number of products formed it would be 
surmised that the number of reactions possible must also be large 
and the oxidation mechanism extremely complex. This is found to 
be the case. Since the beginning of this century and indeed before 
that, mapy theories had been proposed in an endeavour to explain 
both the analytical and kinetic data of the reaction. The more 
important of these will now be discussed. 

The earliest workers proposed that CO and E^O were the 
initial products of combustion formed, with the hydrogen 

preferentially oxidised to the carbon*

A later concept of Kersten's (^ was that the C was oxidized 
preferentially* 

But by far the majority of the early work was done by 
Bone^ and collaborators around 1900, and this led to the pro¬ 
position of the Hydroxylation Theory which considered that 
oxidation was a chain reaction involving hydroxylated compounds 
which could be broken in a number of ways to give varying end 
products.

Evidence of the validity of his chain reaction concept 
was had in the presence of an induction period found in the slow 
combustion of hydrocarbons (time required for the concentration of 
chain carriers i.e. 0 to be formed). However, the mono and dihy«= 
droxylated compounds could not be isolated from the lower paraffins 
at that time. 

Callendar, Bruner and Rideal working on the oxida¬ 

tion of longer hydrocarbons and "knocking” in gasolines, enunciated 
the Peroxide Theory stating that the primary products of combustion 
were not hydroxylated compounds but rather stable alkyl peroxides 
or dialkyl peroxides which then could decompose to form aldehydes 
and ketones.

In the ease of the lower hydrocarbons these peroxides 
could not be isolated and on this basis the theory was much 
criticized, 

Edgerton (6) proposed the formation of an unstable 
activated peroxide which could decompose to give a stable peroxide 
or other product. In effect an energy chain reaction. 

Neither Bone’s Hydroxylation theory nor Edgerton’s 
modified peroxide chain theory explained certain kinetic data^ 
notably the extreme inhibiting effect of surface area on the slow 
combustion. 

In 1935 Norrish (8) introduced the concept of the free 
radical chain carrier in a modification of the Bone hydroxylation 
chain theory* Belchetz had demonstrated the formation of free 
radicals by hydrocarbons but as they are produced only at extreme¬ 
ly elevated temperatures they can play no part in the actual 
initiation of the reaction. Norrish postulated that the oxidation 
would proceed in the following manner®

rather through the formation of an hydroperoxide may lead to either 
an aldehyde or a ketone depending on the hydrocarbon. The initia¬ 


tor in this case is an OH radical, which view Lewis also holds. 
His mechanism for isobutane will be considered in detail both 
because it is detailed for butane and because it is the most 
recent published, ‘^he bands which are susceptible to pyrolytic 
cracking are the bands also attacked by oxygen.

The various processes for the production of chemicals by the 
partial oxidation of hydrocarbons were developed with a view to 
commercial application. Detailed data of both yield and reaction 
conditions are therefore secret. Some generalized data however have 
been reported. 

08 ) 

Wirges has published a summary of the various factors which 
influence the reaction and the approximate values of these variables 
that have been used in commercial oxidation processes. 

In general the yields increase proportionately with an increase 
in pressure. The pressures above 400 to 500 psia, are more favorable 
to alcohol rather than aldehyde production. In a methane rich gas an 
increase in pressure from atmospheric to 250 psig, resulted in a 96% 
increase in the carbon converted to formaldehyde, while only increasing 
the conversion to CO 2 by 50%. 

In general the yields are higher with a lower reaction tempera¬ 
ture, but the lower limit of the preheat required is set by the 
temperature required to initiate the reaction. Richer feed gas and 
higher pressures may be accompanied by a decrease in the preheat tempera¬ 
ture necessary. The oxidation may take place at a temperature of 600 - 
1000 F.j the preferred temperature is usually in the range of 840 to 
880 F. The preferred reaction temperature varies inversely as the make up 
gas B.T.U. content, pressure, and contact time. 

Satisfactory yields are obtainable from the oxidation reaction 
without the use of catalysts. However, many catalysts known to favour 
dehydration, dehydrogenation, or oxidation, including platinum, chromium, 
manganese, iron, nickel, vanadium, chromium, and molybdenum have also

been used successfully. 

The time of reaction employed may vary with the conditions; it 
being affected by temperature, pressure and catalyst. The time is 
usually in the range of to 2 seconds. The use of too small a time 
of contact results in incomplete conversion, while the use of an ex- 
cessively long time causes decomposition of the alcohol and aldehyde 
products.

Design of the Equipment 

The Process 

The original design for the oxidation process was carried 
out by D. B. Robinson, and D. Quon of the Department of Chemical 
and Petroleum Engineering of the University of Alberta, They 
also completed the specifications for, and ordered, the major 
parts of the apparatus. 

The oxidation was to be carried out by bringing the liquid 
butane into contact with oxygen diluted with a large volume of 
nitrogen and steam. Arrangements were made to enable the tempera¬ 
ture of the reaction, the reaction pressure.and the time of 
reaction to be varied. Provision was also to be made to cool the 
gases immediately following the reaction to a low enough tempera¬ 
ture to prevent further decomposition of the products. The 
oxygenated products were than to be stripped from the reaction 
gases. 

The temperature of the reacting gases was to be kept as 
uniform as possible during the reaction despite the highly 
exothermic characteristics of the oxidation. It was thought that 
this could best be done by surrounding the reactor with a bath of 
some liquid which could be boiled at the desired temperature. 

The heat transfer was to be made as efficient as possible by 
maintaining turbulent flow of the gases in the reactor. 

The time of reaction was to be varied by changing the space 
velocity of the gases passing through the reactor. The length of

the reactor was to be such that turbulent flow could be maintained 
at all desirable reaction times. The times of contact designed 
for were from 0.5 seconds to 3 seconds. 

The gases were to be cooled following reaction by quenching 
with a stream of water; then further cooled by a water jacketed 
condenser followed by bubbling the gases through their own 
condensate. The condensate was water of reaction and the condensed 
diluent steam and quench water, and the contact was supplied in an 
ice-jacketed absorber. The gases were then to be reduced to 
atmospheric pressure and stripped of any remaining oxygenated 
material in a packed tower. The final absorption liquid was to 
be water or possibly some basic solution to facilitate stripping 
of the acids. 

The entire process stream in the pressurized part of the 
process was expected to be corrosive. For this reason all piping 
and metal in contact with the stream was to be fabricated from 
type 30i| stainless steel. A schematic diagram of the process is 
shown in figure 1 .

Design and Assembly of the Equipment 

Water and Butane Storage and Measurement 

It was necessary to charge both the butane and the water 
for quenching purposes and for diluent steam into the high 
pressure process stream. Rather than pump them it was decided 
to store and meter them at a constant pressure that was 
substantially higher than the reaction pressure. This was 
accomplished by storing them under compressed nitrogen which was 
introduced to the top of the storage vessels from a large ballast 
tank. The pressure was adjusted in this ballast tank by bleeding 
in nitrogen from a high pressure cylinder. The details of the 
vessel construction are shown in figure 2 , and the assembly of the 
metering system in figure 11 . 

Rotameters were used to meter the butane and the two water 
streams. The needle type control valves were placed downstream 
from the meters. The rotameter capacities were as follows; 

butane.. 33 cc./min. 

water (steam) 26 cc./min. 
quench water.. 37 cc./min. 

All interconnections between storage vessels, rotameters, 
and the reaction stream, were of ^ in, O.D. copper tubing using 
brass flare type fittings. 

The preheater, the reactor, high pressure condenser, and all 
piping connecting them were standard 4 in, type 30 i* stainless

steel pipe* The piping was joined together with standard stainless 
J in. screwed fittings* The butane and the two water streams were 
introduced into the reaction stream through stainless steel sprays 
which screwed into the standard J in. pipe fittings* The detail 
of these sprays is shown in figure 6 * These stainless sprays 
were connected to the copper lines by \ in. brass flared fittings* 
The Reactor, ate Jacket, and Condenser 

Two possible designs were considered for the reactor. One 
consisted of a straight condenser type design with the reacting 
gases flowing in the annulus, and the boiling liquid contained 
in the inner pipe. This design was discarded in favour of a 
helical reactor coil constructed of \ in. standard type 301+ stain¬ 
less steel. The helix contained 22 feet of pipe and the coil was 
1 *. inches in diameter, ^ive thermocouple wells were inserted in it. 
Two of these were located in pipe crosses screwed to the ends of the 
coil with the wells projecting down the axis of the pipe. Three 
more were screwed into \ inch standard type 30i| stainless steel 
couplings which had been welded at equally spaced intervals into 
the coil during its fabrication. The ends of the coil were welded 
into the J inch mild steel top of the reactor jacket with 6 inches 
of the ends protruding, '^he design of the coil is best seen in 
plate 1 * 

The thermocouple wells, illustrated in figure 5 * were made of 
i inch O.D. stainless steel tube welded shut at one end. The 
tubes were run through holes drilled in \ inch standard stainless

pipe plugs and silver soldered to the plugs* ^he wells entering 
the ends of the coil extended some 8 inches down the pipes* The 
three wells which were located in intermediate positions were so 
constructed that the tip of the well, when in position, was 
approximately on the center line of the pipe* These three wells 
had also to be secured to the jacket lid with vapor-proof seal, 
to prevent loss of liquid from the bath* This was accomplished 
by fastening the J inch tube well to a brass l/8 pipe to l/k O.D. 
tube coupling* This coupling was first screwed from below into 
holes drilled and tapped in the lid. An additional thermocouple 
well was added to measure the temperature of the bath liquid 
and was fastened to the lid in the same manner. The details of 
these well fittings are best seen in plate 2 * 

A number of liquids for the reactor bath were considered. 

Among them were sulfur, molten lead, mercury, and a variety of 
Dowtherm (dipheny l), the boiling point of which had been raised 
by chlorination. It was decided to use one of the latter marketed 
under the trade name of Aroclor 12$h by Monsanto, At normal 
pressure this compound had a boiling point between 695 F. and 
710 F. depending upon the degree of degradation brought about by 
prolonged boiling. 

The reactor jacket was constructed of standard 6 inch mild 
steel pipe. The initial design called for the J inch steel end 
plates to be sealed to the end flanges by means of a gasketed joint. 
The Aroclor however could not be contained by any of the gasket

materials locally available. The end joints were then modified to 
have a machined ridge on the plate seating on a machined brass 
face on the flange. This modification is shown in the details of 
the jacket in figure 3 . The reactor jacket was equipped with an 
1800 watt 110 volt Chromel A resistance winding controlled by 
means of a 2000 watt rheostat. The purpose of this winding was to 
heat the Aroclor to the boiling point and supply additional heat to 
keep it boiling uniformly during the reaction if required. 

The original design called for the Aroclor to be condensed 
by means of a water jacketed reflux condenser. This condenser was 
fabricated of 3/4 inch pipe and screwed into a tapped hole in the 
jacket lid. Both the cooling area and the crossection for vapor 
flow were too small and the condenser was found to flood. A new 
condenser was designed, figure 8 . based on the maximum possible 
heat load from both the windings and the burning butane. A 
smaller heat transfer coefficient than that used in the initial 
design, was found applicable (20 BTU/hr Ft^F.). Because the 3/4 
inch hole in the lid of the jacket could not be enlarged with¬ 
out dismantling the entire apparatus, the condenser was used as 
a through-put condenser. The condensate was returned through a 
-J- inch pipe to the bottom of the jacket. This arrangement was un¬ 
satisfactory because the amount of cold Aroclor returned to the 
bottom of the jacket was sufficient to prevent boiling. To 
alleviate this condition the condenser was rearranged as an offset 
reflux condenser which still returned the condensate to the jacket

bottom but this time without cooling it. To compensate for heat 
losses in the return line and also to render the material standing 
in the line fluid enough to flow at the start of circulation, a 
300 watt winding was placed around the line. A Bunsen burner 
playing on the bottom of the jacket was also found to be an aid 
to uniform boiling. 

One difficulty experienced however was that the Aroclor 
tended with time to deposit a hard black crystalline material 
which effectively blocked the elbows of the return line. 

The Preheater 

The preheater consisted of a 7 foot length of \ inch standard 
stainless steel pipe bent in the form of a U. The U was 1* inches 
in diameter and the length of the arms approximately 1|2 inches* 

(see figure h )• The initial design called for one winding of 
Chromel A, 1800 watts at 220 volts, insulated from the pipe with 
alumdum cement. An additional identical winding was later added 
as it was found the one did not have sufficient capacity* The 
preheater was contained in a sheet metal shell which was filled 
"Zonolite”, an expanded mica insulation. In operation, one winding 
was controlled by meais of a 2000 watt furnace transformer which 
could deliver from 25 to 195 volts. The other winding was 
switched in directly on 220 volts when needed. 

The High Pressure Condenser and Absorber 

The high pressure absorber was merely a water jacketed 3 foot 
section of the \ inch standard stainless steel pipe leading from

the reactor to the high pressure absorber, The details of it 
are shown in figure 7 # 

The high pressure absorber has been termed ’’ice-pot” in 
several of the drawings because it was surrounded by a jacket 
that could be filled with ice* In practice the ice was not used 
however* It was fabricated of type 30U stainless steel accord¬ 
ing to the details of figure 9 * Its prime purpose was to separate 
the gas stream, which then passed through the pressure relief 
valve, from the condensed quench water, steam diluent, and water 
of reaction. 

Periodically during a run the liquid was discharged from the 
absorber through a J inch O.D. stainless tube line and a needle 
valve to the liquid collection system. 

All the screwed J inch stainless fittings were joined using 
a high temperature red lead base pipe compound. The graphite base 
ones tended to become porous at the elevated temperatures involved. 
Particular difficulty was found in making a screvred joint tight to 
the Aroclor vapour, and for this reason no effort was made to 
operate the bath at other than atmospheric pressure* 

The Absorption Column and the Gas and Liquid Sampling Systems 

The low pressure absorption column consisted of a U foot 
length of 3 inch I.D. pyrex tube with the ends sealed by large 
rubber corks. (See Figure 10 ). Through the bottom end the gases 
from the pressure relief valve were led to contact water on the 

column’s \ inch Raschig ring packing. The pressure relief valve

was set to maintain the desired pressure in the reactor* The 
stripping water was collected in a liquid product bottle. This 
bottle was connected to the inlet gas line to the column both 
to equalize the pressure and to return to the column any gases 
which might come out of solution* This occurred when liquid was 
discharged into the collection bottle from the high pressure 
condenser. 

Water was supplied to the top of the column through a 
rotameter from either of two 15 liter constant head bottles 
mounted above the column. The off-gas sampler was of the constant 
head type to obtain a proportional sample. The solution used was 
50 % glycerin in water, acidified with 5$ H Cl. 

The Input Gas Metering System 

A premixed gas consisting of approximately 5$ oxygen by 
volume was purchased in cylinders at a pressure of about 2100 
pounds. Three tanks were connected in parallel and the gas was 
drawn off through a manifold to a pressure reduction valve where 
the pressure was reduced to 300 psia. A rotameter having a 
capacity of 5*5 standard cubic feet per minute was used to meter 
the gas. The needle control valve was downstream from the meter 
so that the meter was kept under constant pressure. The gas was 
lead to the inlet of the preheater by means of \ inch O.D. copper 
tubing. The rotameter was protected front and rear by suitable 


screens.

The Off-gas Meter 

The off-gas was metered by a positive displacement type 
Iron Case meter calibrated to read to the nearest hundredth of a 
cubic foot, T he stripped gas was lead through -J inch steel pipe 
to the meter from the absorption column, and discharged to the 
atmosphere through a length of 2 inch pipe. 

General Assembly 

The i inch stainless steel high temperature lines, reactor 
jacket, and condenser leads, were insulated with 1 inch 
Magnesia block as seen In the overall view of the equipment in

The pressure gauges were all calibrated by means of a dead 
weight tester. The quench water rotameter, which was the only one 
not supplied with a calibration by the manufacturer, was calibrated, 

A front view of the control panel in plate shows quite 
prominently the 8 point Brown recording potentiometer which was 
used to record the temperatures from the various points indicated 
in figure 11 . Plate g shows a rear view of the control panel,

Operation of the Unit and Product Analysis 

Preliminary Runs 

The preliminary runs on the apparatus were made using an impure 
butane obtained from the Devon gas recovery plant, This gas contained 
as impurities quantities of isobutane, pentanef and propane, as well 
as some sulphur. The final runs were made using substantially pure 
n-butane purchased from Phillips Petroleum Go,• The preliminary runs 
were of importance because they supplied quantities of liquid product 
and of gas with which to develop analytical technique. The experience 
gained in the operation of the apparatus was also of value and it was 
during these runs that most of the equipment revisions were made. 

Because the results of the runs depended so much on the 
analysis technique employed, a detailed discussion of the methods 
used will be discussed. 

Analytical Technique 

The possible products formed in the oxidation could include 
all the following which have from one to four carbonsj aldehydes, 
ketones, alcohols, and organic acids; plus the various possible 
esters, A thorough survey of the literature did not repeal any 
systematic quantitative chemical method for the analysis of such a 
complex mixture, particularly when in a dilute aqueous solution. The 
use of the mass spectrograph seemed to be the only exact method, but 
for the preliminary work particularly, the expense of such an analysis 
was not justified. 

A combustion analysis for total carbon was thought possible, 
but a closer examination indicated that with a dilute water solution 
the precision obtainable would be poor. Other physical methods for det-

ermining^ the molar concentration of the solution were discarded for a 
similar reason. 

As there was a Podtielniak Hypercal fractionating column avail¬ 
able in the department, it was decided to attempt a distillation of 
the liquid products. The column as shown in Plate 6 is 2.5 cm. in 
diameter and is rated at 100 theoretical plates. To enable the detec¬ 
tion of acetaldehyde which boils at about 19 C., the cooling system of 
the apparatus was modified in the following manner. 

A circulating constant temperature water bath was constructed and 
was connected to the condenser head, side arm cooler, and receiver 
cooler in series. By filling this bath with ice, it was found poss¬ 
ible to circulate ice water to the column at a temperature of 6 C.. 

The details of this system are shown in Figure 29 . 

From a preliminary run on the impure butane a large sample of 
liquid was obtained and four liters of this were charged to the 5 
liter pot of the column. This first fractionation was carried out 
very slowly and some 100 cc. of oxygenated product were obtained. 

With the column shut back on total reflux at nights, the analysis took 
5 days. In addition, familiarity with the operation of the column, 
was gained. 

The large diameter of the column made the separation of small 
fractions very difficult, and in many cases only an inflection in the 
boiling point curve was detected. To identify more closely the cuts 
obtained in the distillation, an Abbe Type refractometer was used and 
the water was used to control the prism temperature to 25 plus or minus 
0.1 degrees Centigrade. See Plate 7 * 

It was found difficult to determine formaldehyde by a distillation 
technique because it came over as a gradually weakening solution of

formalin# An attempt was made to identify the components of the 
solution whose boiling points were above that of water. This was 
done by first distilling over all the water and then forcing the 
products over by means of a still higher boiling "chaser”. This 
method met with no success partly because the glass condenser tubes 
would not handle water vapour readily and partly because the time 
required to distil over some 3 liters of water was excessive* It was 
decided then to determine formaldehyde by one of the specific chem¬ 
ical methods, and to determine the higher boiling organic acids by 
titration of the free acid. 

To make the operation of the Hypercal a little less tedious a 
microswitch was arranged on the scale of the Brown recording poten¬ 
tiometer. This switch actuated a relay, which cut the column back 
on total reflux and at the same time switched on a warning light, 
when the head temperature had risen to any predetermined point. The 
details for this system and the circuit diagram of the water bath are 
found in Figure 30 . 

Detailed Operation of the Hypercal Fractionation Column 

An accurately measured volume of the liquid product from the 
oxidation was charged to the pot of the column. This volume was 
usually between 2 and 3 liters, and the actual quantity was det¬ 
ermined by the estimated strength of the solution. In some of the 
runs, the liquid product obtained was less than this, and in these 
cases only enough of the product to use in the chemical analysis 
was retained and the rest was charged. 

The behavior of a typical analysis was as follows:

The water bath was filled with ice and when the circu¬ 
lating water had reached a temperature of 10 C. or less, the 
charge was brought to a boil. The distillation rate control 
was set at a column pressure differential of 1mm. of Hg. This 
controlled the reflux rate at about 2 drops per second as ob¬ 
served at the column head. The column was then allowed to run 
at total reflux for one half an hour to reach equilibrium. 

By this time, the head temperature had dropped to 19 C., 
the boiling temperature of acetaldehyde. The microswitch 
cut-off was set to 20 C. and the intermittant take-off mech¬ 
anism started. The take-off rate was about 0.2 cc. of product 
every 10 minutes, using a timer setting of 1 sec. in 5 min.. 
When some 2 cc. of acetaldehyde had been taken off, the tem¬ 
perature rose sharply and the receivers were changed. For the 
entire distillation the pressure was atmospheric. 

When the head temperature had risen to the boiling point 
of propionaldehyde, the column was shut back on total reflux 
and preflooded. When the temperature had again stabilized, 

i 

the ice water was cut off and tap water from the mains sub¬ 
stituted as cooling medium. The bath was then drained of ice 
water and set to supply controlled water to the refractometer 
at 25C.. 

The distillation was then continued. A small inflection 
in the curve was noted for propionaldehyde and the receiver 
was again changed at 5U C. The small cut of 0.5 cc was check-

ed for the refractive index and was estimated to be propionalde- 
hyde with some traces of acetaldehyde. As the temperature con¬ 
tinued to rise very slowly toward 60 C., the color of the pro¬ 
duct was noticed changing from colorless to light yellow. The 
receiver was changed and the U c.c. of product was estimated 
by the refractive index to contain 70% acetone and 30% metha¬ 
nol. The refractive index versus volume composition curve for 
acetone methanol was determined experimentally and is shown in 
figure 31* 

The curve now flattened and remained steady at 6l C. The 
microswitch was set at 63 C. and the distillation allowed to 
proceed without supervision. 

When the signal light indicated that the head temperature 
had again started to rise, the receivers were changed and the 
refractive index indicated a composition of 70% methanol and 
30% acetone. However, it had been previously determined that 

1 

when the yellow color of the product was appreciable, the re¬ 
fractive index was usually high. The long flat plateau at 
the methanol boiling point seemed to indicate that this was the 
case and the composition accepted was 90% methanol and 10 % 
acetone. 

The product was then taken off more slowly yet and the 
cut taken at 80 C. This cut of 1 cc. seemed to be predomin-

antly ethanol, though now somewhat deeper yellow in color. 

From BO C, to 92 C., the pressure differential in the column 
rose steadily for the same rate of reflux accompanied by a rise in 
the heat input required to maintain this rate of influx. 

The differential now required was B mm, of Hg. and the control 
variac setting had to be changed from 40 to 60, The low control was 
changed also and kept at 15 volts below the other. The product with¬ 
drawn became lighter in color and the viscosity of it increased no¬ 
ticeably. The 1 cc. of product withdrawn was estimated to be mainly 
propanol. The yellow color noticed in all the products above acetone, 
could not be separated nor could its origin be traced since all the 
expected products are colorless. 

The product produced while the boiling point gradually rose to 
that of water, was determined by refractive index measurements to be 
a progressively weaker formalin solution. At this point, the transi¬ 
tion from organic vapours to water vapour in the condenser head could 
easily be distinguished. The pot liquor remaining had changed in 
color from a very pale to quite a deep yellow. The odor had also ch¬ 
anged from the sharp stinging odor of aldehyde to the sweetish smell 
of the esters.

Chemical Analysis for Formaldehyde 


The analytical technique used was a modification of Romijn's 


# 


Potassium Cyanide method which is specific for formaldehyde in the 
presence of other aldehydes and ketones. Twenty five cc. of the ori¬ 
ginal liquid sample were diluted to 100 cc. and a 10 cc. aliquot part 
used in the analysis. 

Free Acid Determination 

The titration for the free acid was made using a Coleman Ph. 
meter as illustrated in plate 8* The solutions determined in some 
cases, were yellow in color and thus the use of an indicator would 
have been difficult. In addition the Ph. of the end point differed 
with solutions and this would have made the proper choice of the in¬ 
dicator uncertain. 

Discussion of the Liquid Analysis 

From the above description of the distillation and the chemi¬ 
cal analysis of the liquid products, it is clear that oxygenated pro¬ 
ducts present will be reported as varying amounts of the following: 


Formaldehyde 


Acetone 


Acetic Acid 


Methanol 


Acetaldehyde 


Ethanol 


Propionaldehyde 


Propanol

From this group, many of the possible products are 
missing. In fact, some products, such as the butyl alcohols, 
will not be accounted for at all. Other products, such as but- 
yraldehyde, would be reported as some other compounds, in this 
case as either ethanol or propanol. Also all the organic acids 
will be reported as acetic acid. 

But, even if the major yields are in those products grouped 
above, the analysis may still be widely in error if the component 
is present in only small amounts or if the solution is extremely 
dilute. 

If the solution is too dilute, there is the possibility 
that a larger volume of the solution could be concentrated by 
means of the Hypercal and the concentrate redistilled. 

The Off-gas Analysis 

The off-gas analysis was run in a three-pipette standard 
type Orsat apparatus, and a standard method was utilized. 

However, the results that were obtained were not as good as were 
expected. In the earlier runs, using the constant head propor¬ 
tional sampler, the combustion analysis was very erratic. This 
may have been due to inexperience at this point on the part of 
the operator, but was most likely caused by the absorption of 
the butane by the rubber tubing and the rubber corks. Whenever the 
gas sample had been allowed to stand for any length of time in the 
sampler before analysis, the results were low.

In the report of the analysis only three components are given: 

c,o 2 

02 

Total Carbon — reported as butane. 

The reasons for this seemingly incomplete analysis are as 
follows: 

1. Unsaturates could not be determined in the presence of butane 
by sulphuric acid. 

2. Upon oxidation of the gas over copper oxide, there was an 
expansion noted, which indicated that the gashes at this 
point contained carbon in an oxidizable form. Thus the hy¬ 
drogen present could not be determined, nor consequently the 
percentage of CO. Total carbon could be obtained, however, 
from the amount of CO 2 formed. 

3. The slow oxidation was not thought to be reliable for the spec¬ 
ific identification of the various hydrocarbons because of the 
possible presence of partially oxidized materials. However, 
the analysis was exact for the determination of total carbon, 
which for lack of specific identification, was reported as 
butane. 

A further discussion of the reliability of the analysis is 
presented in the discussion of the results.

Operation of the Unit 


Several hours before the commencement of a run, the re¬ 
actor jacket heater was turned on and the Aroclor allowed to 
come to the boil. Just before the Aroclor started to boil, 
however, the condensate return line heater was turned on. 

This was done to lower viscosity of the material standing in 
the line and to allow free circulation of the condensate. 

Before starting the run proper, the absorption column 
was preflooded by completely filling it with water. The water 
was drained but the packing was still kept wet by adjusting 
the water flow rate to the column to that maintained during 
the run* 

This done, the preheater was next brought to temperature 
by turning on both windings and allowing a small flow of gas 
through the apparatus. This was done so that the outlet ther¬ 
mocouple of the preheater would register the approximate tem¬ 
perature of the heater. When the temperature, thus recorded, 
had reached about 1000 F., the gas flow rate was increased to 
that desired during the min and, at the same time, the water 
input for the diluent steam was adjusted. The temperature of 
the gases was now roughly adjusted by means of the preheater 
transformer so that the reading of the #2 thermocouple was 
approximately ?80 F. The #2 thermocouple, from reference to 
figure 11, is noted to be the first temperature recorded in

the reactor. This point is immediately below the entrance of the bu¬ 
tane. 

The butane was then admitted in the desired amount and the start 
of the reaction was noted by a sharp rise in several of the reactor 
temperatures above the temperature of the boiling bath, that is above 
700 F.. The preheat temperature was then readjusted to maintain the 
minimum temperature in the reactor at 700 F.. This might require the 
#2 thermocouple to read higher than 700 because, usually the butane 
was not completely vapourized by this point. 

The conditions were then kept as steady as possible until the 
reaction had reached steady state as indicated by steady reaction 
temperatures. The high pressure condenser was then blown out and the 
quench water turned on in sufficient amount to lower the gases temper¬ 
ature as indicated by thermocouple #7, to below 300 F. 

The run was now under The time was taken along with the 

off-gas meter reading. The liquid collector was simultaneously con¬ 
nected, and the gas sampler was started. During the run, the rota¬ 
meters had to be constantly checked, and the pressure regulator on 
the input-gas rotameter had to be continually readjusted as the gas 
pressure in the high pressure cylinders fell off. The reaction pres¬ 
sure which was set by means of the pressure relief valve below the 
high pressure condenser, remained stable and did not have to be ad¬ 
justed so long as the gas flow was kept constant. 

The unit was kept in operation either until 3 liters of liquid 
sample were collected (including that discharge from the high press¬ 
ure condenser at intervals during the run), or until forced to stop 
by running out of compressed gas in the cylinders.

At the finish of the run, the high pressure condenser was comp¬ 
letely discharged into the liquid collection bottle. Then sirftultan- 
eously the off-gas meter reading was taken, the time was taken and 
the liquid collector and the off-gas sampler were disconnected. The 
run now over, the heaters were turned off, the butane turned off, 
the two water streams turned off, and finally the input gas turned 
off and the pressure in the reactor released.

Experimental Results 

The butane oxidation apparatus was designed to enable control 
to be exercised over the four key factors controlling the reaction. 

These were; time of contact, temperature, pressure, and composition of 
the reacting gas. The apparatus was not designed to study the effects 
of catalysis, or surface effects, on the oxidation. 

Because the time available was only sufficient to make prelim¬ 
inary runs, it was decided to vary only the time of reaction. Prelim¬ 
inary work with impure butane had indicated that a reaction could be 
sustained with a reaction temperature of 700 F., and a pressure of 
100 psig. Therefore, it was planned to make runs at 100 psia and 700 
F., varying the contact time from 0.5 to 3 seconds. With the pure N- 
butane, however, it was found that the reaction could not be initiated 
at 100 psia, but only at 150 psia or higher. The capacity of the rota¬ 
meters limited the reaction time to a minimum of 0.8 seconds at this 
pressure, so it was decided to attempt runs at 0.8, 1.5* 2,3* and 6 seconds. 

It was arbitrarily decided to maintain the steam concentration 
in the gas stream to 6 % by volume, which is believed to approximate 
commercial conditions. The premixed nitrogen and oxygen had been or¬ 
dered at % oxygen, but when the tanks for the runs were delivered 
they were found to contain 5.3^ oxygen. Therefore, this concentration 
was used in making the runs. It was also decided to admix the oxygen 
and the butane in the ratio of one mole of butane for two moles of 


oxygen

To determine the flow rates for a run, the following procedure 
was followed: 

1. The reaction tune was chosen, 

2. The total molar flow rate was computed. These calculations 
were based on the total length of the reactor coil, and the cross-sec¬ 
tional area for gas flow. The gases were considered to behave ideally, 
and previous calculations had indicated that the pressure drop through 
the reactor was negligible compared to the total pressure. 

3. The moles of steam, moles of butane, and moles of nitrogen 
plus oxygen, were computed, fixing the butane concentration at one 
half that of the oxygen on a molar basis. 

Results of the Tests 

The data from the various runs has been compiled in tables one 
to five. In part (a) of the table is shown the average temperatures 
recorded by each of the thermocouples in the reactor. The numbering of 
the positions is consecutive in the direction of flox^r, and the the mo- 
couples are equally spaced along the reactor. The mean deviation from 
the average temperature is also given and this is an indication of the 
temperature stability. In most cases this temperature instability is 
caused by overshooting in the manual control of the preheat tempera¬ 
ture. Because of the limited amount of nitrogen and oxygen in the 
three tanks, some runs were of necessity begun before true steady 
state conditions were reached. Particularly was this true in the case 


of the runs of short reaction times

Part (b) of the table contains the computed analysis data and 
the calculated percent yields. The total number of moles of the indi¬ 
vidual components was calculated from the chemical and distillation 
analyses, and based on the liquid product obtained during a run. The 
total moles of the off-gas components were in a similar manner based 
on the total off-gas measured during the run. The moles of carbon 
and oxygen (Oq), were calculated from the number of moles of indivi¬ 
dual components. A carbon balance was obtained by comparing the total 
carbon contained in the product and off-gas streams with the measured 
input carbon calculated from the butane flow rate. The oxygen totals 
do not represent a balance since no account was made of the oxygen con¬ 
tained in the water formed by the reaction, which was not measured acc¬ 
urately. A hydrogen balance could not be obtained, partly because of 
the unknown quantity of the water of the reaction, but also because 
hydrogen was not analyzed in the off-gas. A nitrogen balance was ob¬ 
tained by comparing the off-gas nitrogen as calculated from the residue 
in the Orsat analysis, with the amount of nitrogen present in the input 
gas. 

The data will now be examined run by run. 

Run 6-2 

The temperature stability obtained during this run was only fair 
as seen from table 1-a . The charge to the Hypercal was Isjr liters but 
the product was in a reasonably concentrated solution, thus giving a 
fairly precise distillation analysis. The gas analysis showed good

reproduceability. The carbon balance was good, and the nitrogen ba¬ 
lance fairly good* In this run, failure to keep the Aroclor at the 
bottom of the reactor jacket boiling resulted in the temperature fall¬ 
ing below that necessary to initiate the reaction. The temperature of 
the gases did not reach the reaction temperature until the gases had 
passed some one third of the way through the reactor. Thus the true 
time of reaction was of the order of 1 to 1.5 seconds, and not 2 sec¬ 
onds as derived from the gas velocity. 

Run 3-3 

The reaction time for this run was 3 seconds. The temperature 
stability was the best of any of the runs made; the mean deviation from 
the average temperature never exceeding 5 degrees. The solution ob¬ 
tained was quite concentrated and 2 liters were charged to the Hyper- 
cal. This contained the largest amount of oxygenated material of all 
the runs to be distilled in the Hypercal and thus gave the most exact 
liquid analysis. One thing marred this run however, and that was the 
failure to get a reasonable carbon balance. The butane contained in 
the off-gas ran some three times as high as the total butane in the 
input gas. 

There are several possible reasons for this: 

One possibility arises because the pressurizing line closely 
connects the butane storage tank with the water storage. There is a 
chance that when the butane tank was being charged, some butane found

its way to the water tank and formed a floating layer on the water. 
When the water level in the tank became quite low, (as it did because 
near the first of the succeeding run the tank went dry) the butane was 
discharged through both the quench water rotameter and also the dilu¬ 
ent steam meter. This would greatly increase the butane concentra¬ 
tion, not only in the reaction gases but more especially in the off¬ 
gases, since the reaction was being quenched by a stream of pure bu¬ 
tane. 


The second possibility for error lies in the Orsat analysis. 

In view of this discrepancy the data of run B-3 would seem to be 
worthless. It has been plotted in the following yield curves, however, 
since there are indications in the literature that the inlet butane 
concentration is not critical. Nevertheless this increased butane 
concentration may account for some of the maximum yields for various 
components that were observed at the 3 second reaction time. 

Run B-4 

The temperature stability during this run was quite poor. 

The analysis data however were good because 2-J- liters of a quite con¬ 
centrated product were obtained during the run. The nitrogen balance 
was not as good as desired showing an error of 5$. The carbon balance 
was better than could be expected on the basis of the nitrogen balance. 
The time of reaction (1.5 seconds), was short and the volume of gas 
available for the run was too small, allowing insufficient time for 
the apparatus to reach steady state, thus accounting for the poor tern-

perature control. 

Run B-5 

The tine of reaction here was very short, (0.8 Seconds) and 
even though three tanks of nitrogen and oxygen were completely used, 
the run was still rushed and the temperature stability only fair. 

The passage of the gases through the reactor was very rapid and con¬ 
sequently the product was in a very dilute solution. Too, because 
the run had to be necessarily short, only a small quantity of solu¬ 
tion was obtained during the run. The total quantity obtained was 
ij- liters of which 1300 cc. were charged to the distillation column. 
The Hypercal analysis yielded results that were at best uncertain, 
and the proportions of each component had to be mainly estimated by 
the refractive index. The analysis for formaldehyde and the titra¬ 
tion for free acid were reduced slightly in precision but were still 
quite accurate. The gas analysis was very consistant but the nitro¬ 
gen balance was low. The carbon and the oxygen balances were quite 
good, and the balance in the oxygen substantiated the low percent 
conversion as indicated by the product analysis. 

Run 33-6 

The temperature stability obtained here was very good. The 
rate of product formation was very slow due to the low rates of flow, 
and the solution thus obtained was very dilute. However, a suffi¬ 
cient volume (3 liters) was distilled to yield a quite accurate

analysis. The gas analysis was consistent but the carbon balance 
arrived at was poor. The nitrogen balance too, was only fair. 


T he Plotted Data 

Figure 14 is a plot of the gas temperature within the re¬ 
actor and is interesting for a number of reasons. It can be noted 
that in the cases of the 0.8, 1.5? and 2 second, nominal contact 
times, the temperature falls during the first quarter of the passage 
through the reactor. This indicates that the butane is not complete¬ 
ly vapourized until as much as a quarter, and possibly even a third 
of the nominal reaction time is over. Probably then the true time 
of reaction for at least part of the butane is less than the indi¬ 
cated time of contact. This is particularly true in the case of the 
2 second run (run B-2) since the temperature falls considerably below 
that required to sustain any reaction; the temperature required to 
initiate the reaction at these pressures and concentrations of re¬ 
acting gases seemed to be of the order of 650 F. In this case most 
certainly the true time of reaction is below the nominal time of 2 
seconds as indicated by the gas velocity. It is more likely of the 
order of 1 to 1.5 seconds. 

The probable truth of this statement is indicated by an ex¬ 
amination figure 13 which shows the percent of carbon reacted per 
pass through the reactor for the various times of contact. The re-

acted carbon as plotted in the succeeding curves is the carbon con¬ 
tained in the analysed liquid product and the carbon oxides in the 
off-gases. It is not the difference between the butane in the inlet 
gas stream, and that butane analyzed in the off-gas. 

Figure 14. also shows that, for the 0.8 second contact time 
the reaction peak , as indicated by the peak in the reaction gas 
temperature, is not reached before the reaction is stopped by quen¬ 
ching. With a reaction time of 1.5 seconds the peak is found in the 
midsection of the reactor, the gases subsequently losing heat to the 
boiling bath and cooling. A reaction time of 3 seconds shows the re¬ 
action peak occurring at the first quarter of the reactor. A time 
of 6 seconds finds the peak occurring at or before the tip of the 
first thermocouple well. 

The curve of percent of total carbon reacted per pass,(figure 
13) shows the low conversion which could be expected for 0.8 second 
time of reaction, and the marked increase in conversion which accom¬ 
panies a longer contact time. However, it also shows a decrease in 
the total conversion at a 6 second reaction time which is not expec¬ 
ted. This may be accounted for by the existence of streamline flow 
in the reactor gases at the low space velocities associated with this 
contact time. 

Figure 15 shows the percent of the carbon reacted that appears 
as liquid product. The curve shows a distinct maximum occurring at

between 1.5 and 2 second reaction time. A possible explanation for 
this may be found if we assume the existence of an induction period 
in the butane oxidation, during which time the concentration of the 
chain carriers whose subsequent reactions give rise to the formation 
of liquid products, is being built up. The evidence is not clear 
however, and this suggestion must be considered to be nothing more 
than a supposition. 

Since Figure 16 is really a complement to Figure 15 and shows 
the corresponding minimum percentage of CO 2 at a reaction time of 2 
seconds. 

Figures 17 to 24 show the percent of the total carbon reacted 
which appeared as the various identified products. The data for for¬ 
maldehyde, and the titration for the free acid which was subsequent¬ 
ly reported as acetic acid, are likely to be the most accurate. For¬ 
maldehyde particularly should be reliable since it was based on a spe 
cific chemical analysis, run in triplicate, and showing a reproduce- 
ability of better than 3 parts in 1000. However, it must be realized 
that since the yield percentages are based on the total carbon con¬ 
version, the CO 2 analysis played a part in it. The uncertainty in¬ 
troduced by the CO 2 would not seriously affect the overall yield data 
for the other components. 

Figure 17 shows that the percent yield of formaldehyde drops 
with an increase in the reaction time. This is expected since the

formaldehyde is possibly the least stable of the components, A high 
yield for the low time of reaction is also to be expected in view of 
the part formaldehyde is thought to play in the initiation of the re¬ 
action chain. 

In figure 18 the acetic acid percent yield is also shown to 
drop with increasing reaction time. This would seem to indicate ei¬ 
ther that the acetic acid is relatively unstable at elevated tempera¬ 
tures or that the possibility of the formation of esters of the acid 
in the gas phase is increased with an increase in the time of con¬ 
tact. There is no evidence to support this statement so it must be 
considered a supposition only. 

Figure 19 shows the yield of acetone going through a maximum 
at a reaction time of 3 seconds. This is to be expected since the 
latest views on the reaction mechanism seem to hold that the formation 
of acetone is a secondary reaction preceded by several reactions in¬ 
volving various free radicals and other chain carriers. The yield 
might be expected then to drop after a maximum was reached and the 
acetone continues to be degraded eventually to CO 2 and water. 

This maximum which might be expected of methanol is also ob¬ 
served in figure 20. The maximum appears at a lower reaction time 
than that of the acetone and this might be explained on the basis 
that methanol is the product of the reaction of two of the more pri¬ 
mary chain carriers, the OH and the CH 3 .,

Figure 21 indicates that the acetaldehyde yield also goes 
through a maximum at the same time of reaction as the acetone. This 
also indicates that the acetaldehyde is the result of a secondary re¬ 
action which continues with further time of contact to decrease the 
yield. 


Propionaldehyde as indicated by figure 22 , climbs steadily with 
increase of reaction time. No explanation is offered for this, other 
than the uncertainty in the analysis. 

Figure 23 shows a minimum yield for ethanol falling between 1.5 
and 3 seconds time of contact. No basis for this is predicted by the 
assumed reaction mechanism, and any explanation is attributed to err¬ 
ors in the analysis. Because of the small quantities of material 
available for the analysis at the 0,8 and 6 second reaction^times 
the chance of a relatively large percentage error is very high, par¬ 
ticularly when one considers that the component reported as ethanol 
in the distillation analysis, could have represented a variety of 
products ranging from ethyl acetate to isobuteraldehyde. 

pV*o pa. n o I 

The yields reported for ppop 4 o na! 4ehyde seem to be relatively 
independent of time of reaction, as shown in figure 24, but in view 
of the very small percentages involved and the correspondingly small 
quantities distilled the chance for error is large.

acetone, and methanol, plotted as the percent of the carbon in the an¬ 
alyzed liquid product alone, instead of the percent of the total re¬ 
acted carbon. The curve shapes are little different from the previous 
curves so no further mention will be made of them. 

CONCLUSIONS 

Although some of the analytical results may be open to question, 
nevertheless some valid conclusions may be reasonably drawn. 

These are: 

1. The reaction peak as indicated by the peak in the tempera¬ 
ture of the reacting gases, may change position in the reactor with 
change in time of reaction. The temperature data seems to indicate 
that the time of induction before this peak is reached is approxima¬ 
tely independent of the gas velocity and is of the order of 0.75 sec¬ 
onds. 

2. Both the formaldehyde and the acetic acid percent of the 
total carbon reacted decrease rapidly with an increase in reaction time. 

3. Acetaldehyde, acetone, and methanol, yields go through a’ 
maximum indicating that they are intermediate products formed in the 
oxidation of butane to carbon oxides and water. 

4. The percent total carbon per pass reaches a maximum at a 
reaction time of 3 seconds, but that this phenomenum is likely due to 
changing flow characteristics, the cause for which is inherent in the 


design of the reactor.

Recommendations for further ' ork 

As a result of these preliminary tests certain changes in both 
the analytical technique and in the equipment are recommended in fut¬ 
ure experimental work. 

The present reactor design is suitable for investigating the 
effect of pressure, inlet gas composition, and temperature, (with some 
modification of the reactor jacket) but it suffers from one disadvan¬ 
tage when studying the effect of the time of contact, with the pre¬ 
sent reactor the only way of varying the time of reaction is by varying 
the space velocity and hence the Reynold's number of the reacting gas 
stream. This change in the flow characteristics and turbulence of 
the gas stream may have an important effect on the reaction rate. One 
method of controlling the Reynold's number of the flowing gas inde¬ 
pendently of time ofcontact is by the use of a variable-length reactor. 
This would also assist in permitting a narrower range of molal flow 
rates so that the absorption column could be operated near its opti¬ 
mum liquid flow ra.tes at all times. 

If the gas flow rate is to be held constant, an absorption col¬ 
umn can then be designed to operate close to the flood point. Be¬ 
cause the resistance to mass transfer is primarily resident in the 
gas film, a column near flooding will give better absorption with 
smaller water flow because of the smaller chance of channelling. The 
absorption column used in this preliminary work seemed to pass some 
aldehyde vapour, particularly when the yields were high and the gas

velocity also high. 

The difficulties experienced in obtaining a tight seal against 
Aroclor vapour suggests the use of only one joint, instead of the two 
in use at present. Also a metal gasket might be used, such as corru¬ 
gated copper. The condenser should be reflux in nature, and welded 
joints are recommended with a plug in the cold end of the condenser 
well above the vapour line to permit clearing the vapour line of ob¬ 
structions. The present recycle system offers difficulties in pre¬ 
heating the returning liquid to its boiling point, with a tight sys¬ 
tem the pressure of the bath can be varied easily, allowing accurate 
control of the boiling temperature of the Aroclor bath. It should 
also be noted that while Aroclor and its vapours are non-corrosive, 
there tends to be a slow decomposition at the boiling temperature 
and in the presence of air, liberating hydrochloric acid vapour. 

On the whole the principleof controlling the reaction temper¬ 
ature by means of a boiling bath appears to be sound. It is in the 
analysis of the products with particular reference to the gas analysis 
where improvement must be made. 

The distillation analysis of the liquid products, particu¬ 
larly for the alcohols, which are difficult to distinguish chemi¬ 
cally, seems to be workable. ¥ith modifications such as a prelim¬ 
inary separation of aldehydes as, for example, the solid hydrazones, 
the method might well prove wholly satisfactory for the lower boil¬ 
ing components. Separation of the higher alcohols, the various or-

ganic acids, and high boiling esters may well prove troublesome. 

The gas analysis in this preliminary work caused the most 
difficulty. Some of this difficulty might be overcome by stripping 
out all the condensible hydrocarbons in a freezing thimble, using 
liquid air or dry ice as the coolant. 

The acceptable answer to the problem of analysis may lie in 
a chromatographic absorption separation, or possibly distillation 
coupled with infrared spectrophotometry, or in the last analysis 
the only suitable method may be by mass spectrography. 

In any case before a comprehensive series of tests can be 
carried out the indicated problems above will have to be solved. 
This work has only pointed the way toward further development.
